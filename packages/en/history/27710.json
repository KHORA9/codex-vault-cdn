Although Great Britain, first in the field, had\r\nthen, after about twenty-five years' work, expended nearly 300 millions\r\nsterling in the construction of 8300 miles of railway, it has, during the\r\nlast seventeen years, expended about 288 millions more in constructing\r\n7780 additional miles.\r\n\r\nBut the construction of railways has proceeded with equal rapidity on the\r\nContinent.  France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland,\r\nHolland, have largely added to their railway mileage.  Austria is\r\nactively engaged in carrying new lines across the plains of Hungary,\r\nwhich Turkey is preparing to meet by lines carried up the valley of the\r\nLower Danube.  Russia is also occupied with extensive schemes for\r\nconnecting Petersburg and Moscow with her ports in the Black Sea on the\r\none hand, and with the frontier towns of her Asiatic empire on the other.\r\n\r\nItaly is employing her new-born liberty in vigorously extending railways\r\nthroughout her dominions.  A direct line of communication has already\r\nbeen opened between France and Italy, through the Mont Cenis Tunnel;\r\nwhile another has been opened between Germany and Italy through the\r\nBrenner Pass,--so that the entire journey may now be made by two\r\ndifferent railway routes (excepting only the short sea-passage across the\r\nEnglish Channel) from London to Brindisi, situated in the south-eastern\r\nextremity of the Italian peninsula.\r\n\r\nDuring the last sixteen years, nearly the whole of the Indian railways\r\nhave been made.  When Edmund Burke, in 1783, arraigned the British\r\nGovernment for their neglect of India in his speech on Mr. Fox's Bill, he\r\nsaid: \"England has built no bridges, made no high roads, cut no\r\nnavigations, dug out no reservoirs. . . .  Were we to be driven out of\r\nIndia this day, nothing would remain to tell that it had been possessed,\r\nduring the inglorious period of our dominion, by anything better than the\r\nourang-outang or the tiger.\"\r\n\r\nBut that reproach no longer exists.  Some of the greatest bridges erected\r\nin modern times--such as those over the Sone near Patna, and over the\r\nJumna at Allahabad--have been erected in connection with the Indian\r\nrailways.  More than 5000 miles are now at work, and they have been\r\nconstructed at an expenditure of about 88,000,000 pounds of British\r\ncapital, guaranteed by the British Government.  The Indian railways\r\nconnect the capitals of the three Presidencies--uniting Bombay with\r\nMadras on the south, and with Calcutta on the north-east--while a great\r\nmain line, 2200 miles in extent, passing through the north-western\r\nprovinces, and connecting Calcutta with Lucknow, Delhi, Lahore, Moultan,\r\nand Kurrachee, unites the mouths of the Hooghly in the Bay of Bengal with\r\nthose of the Indus in the Arabian Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the first edition of this work appeared, in the beginning of 1857,\r\nthe Canadian system of railways was but in its infancy.  The Grand Trunk\r\nwas only begun, and the Victoria Bridge--the greatest of all railway\r\nstructures--was not half erected.  The Colony of Canada has now more than\r\n3000 miles in active operation along the great valley of the St.\r\nLawrence, connecting Riviere du Loup at the mouth of that river, and the\r\nharbour of Portland in the State of Maine, _via_ Montreal and Toronto,\r\nwith Sarnia on Lake Huron, and with Windsor, opposite Detroit in the\r\nState of Michigan.  During the same time the Australian Colonies have\r\nbeen actively engaged in providing themselves with railways, many of\r\nwhich are at work, and others are in course of formation.  The Cape of\r\nGood Hope has several lines open, and others making.  France has\r\nconstructed about 400 miles in Algeria; while the Pasha of Egypt is the\r\nproprietor of 360 miles in operation across the Egyptian desert.  The\r\nJapanese are also making railroads.\r\n\r\nBut in no country has railway construction been prosecuted with greater\r\nvigour than in the United States.  There the railway furnishes not only\r\nthe means of intercommunication between already established settlements,\r\nas in the Old World; but it is regarded as the pioneer of colonization,\r\nand as instrumental in opening up new and fertile territories of vast\r\nextent in the west,--the food-grounds of future nations.  Hence railway\r\nconstruction in that country was scarcely interrupted even by the great\r\nCivil War,--at the commencement of which Mr. Seward publicly expressed\r\nthe opinion that \"physical bonds--such as highways, railroads, rivers,\r\nand canals--are vastly more powerful for holding civil communities\r\ntogether than any mere covenants, though written on parchment or engraved\r\non iron.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States were the first to follow the example of\r\nEngland, after the practicability of steam locomotion had been proved on\r\nthe Stockton and Darlington, and Liverpool and Manchester Railways.  The\r\nfirst sod of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway was cut on the 4th of July,\r\n1828, and the line was completed and opened for traffic in the following\r\nyear, when it was worked partly by horse-power, and partly by a\r\nlocomotive built at Baltimore, which is still preserved in the Company's\r\nworkshops.  In 1830, the Hudson and Mohawk Railway was begun, while other\r\nlines were under construction in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New\r\nJersey; and in the course of ten years, 1843 miles were finished and in\r\noperation.  In ten more years, 8827 miles were at work; at the end of\r\n1864, 35,000 miles; and at the 31st of December, 1873, not less than\r\n70,651 miles were in operation, of which 3916 had been made during that\r\nyear.  One of the most extensive trunk-lines is the Great Pacific\r\nRailroad, connecting the lines in the valleys of the Mississippi and the\r\nMissouri with the city of San Francisco on the shores of the Pacific, by\r\nmeans of which it is possible to make the journey from England to Hong\r\nKong, via New York, in little more than a month.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe results of the working of railways have been in many respects\r\ndifferent from those anticipated by their projectors.  One of the most\r\nunexpected has been the growth of an immense passenger-traffic.  The\r\nStockton and Darlington line was projected as a coal line only, and the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester as a merchandise line.  Passengers were not\r\ntaken into account as a source of revenue, for at the time of their\r\nprojection, it was not believed that people would trust themselves to be\r\ndrawn upon a railway by an \"explosive machine,\" as the locomotive was\r\ndescribed to be.  Indeed, a writer of eminence declared that he would as\r\nsoon think of being fired off on a ricochet rocket, as travel on a\r\nrailway at twice the speed of the old stagecoaches.  So great was the\r\nalarm which existed as to the locomotive, that the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Committee pledged themselves in their second prospectus,\r\nissued in 1825, \"not to require any clause empowering its use;\" and as\r\nlate as 1829, the Newcastle and Carlisle Act was conceded on the express\r\ncondition that the line should not be worked by locomotives, but by\r\nhorses only.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Liverpool and Manchester Company obtained powers to\r\nmake and work their railway without any such restriction; and when the\r\nline was made and opened, a locomotive passenger train was advertised to\r\nbe run upon it, by way of experiment.  Greatly to the surprise of the\r\ndirectors, more passengers presented themselves as travellers by the\r\ntrain than could conveniently be carried.\r\n\r\nThe first arrangements as to passenger-traffic were of a very primitive\r\ncharacter, being mainly copied from the old stage-coach system.  The\r\npassengers were \"booked\" at the railway office, and their names were\r\nentered in a way-bill which was given to the guard when the train\r\nstarted.  Though the usual stage-coach bugleman could not conveniently\r\naccompany the passengers, the trains were at first played out of the\r\nterminal stations by a lively tune performed by a trumpeter at the end of\r\nthe platform; and this continued to be done at the Manchester Station\r\nuntil a comparatively recent date.\r\n\r\nBut the number of passengers carried by the Liverpool and Manchester line\r\nwas so unexpectedly great, that it was very soon found necessary to\r\nremodel the entire system.  Tickets were introduced, by which a great\r\nsaving of time was effected.  More roomy and commodious carriages were\r\nprovided, the original first-class compartments being seated for four\r\npassengers only.  Everything was found to have been in the first instance\r\nmade too light and too slight.  The prize 'Rocket,' which weighed only\r\n4.5 tons when loaded with its coke and water, was found quite unsuited\r\nfor drawing the increasingly heavy loads of passengers.  There was also\r\nthis essential difference between the old stage-coach and the new railway\r\ntrain, that, whereas the former was \"full\" with six inside and ten\r\noutside, the latter must be able to accommodate whatever number of\r\npassengers came to be carried.  Hence heavier and more powerful engines,\r\nand larger and more substantial carriages were from time to time added to\r\nthe carrying stock of the railway.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the trains was also increased.  The first locomotives used\r\nin hauling coal-trains ran at from four to six miles an hour.  On the\r\nStockton and Darlington line the speed was increased to about ten miles\r\nan hour; and on the Liverpool and Manchester line the first\r\npassenger-trains were run at the average speed of seventeen miles an\r\nhour, which at that time was considered very fast.  But this was not\r\nenough.  When the London and Birmingham line was opened, the mail-trains\r\nwere run at twenty-three miles an hour; and gradually the speed went up,\r\nuntil now the fast trains are run at from fifty to sixty miles an\r\nhour,--the pistons in the cylinders, at sixty miles, travelling at the\r\ninconceivable rapidity of 800 feet per minute!\r\n\r\nTo bear the load of heavy engines run at high speeds, a much stronger and\r\nheavier road was found necessary; and shortly after the opening of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester line, it was entirely relaid with stronger\r\nmaterials.  Now that express passenger-engines are from thirty to\r\nthirty-five tons each, the weight of the rails has been increased from 35\r\nlbs. to 75 lbs. or 86 lbs. to the yard.  Stone blocks have given place to\r\nwooden sleepers; rails with loose ends resting on the chairs, to rails\r\nwith their ends firmly \"fished\" together; and in many places, where the\r\ntraffic is unusually heavy, iron rails have been replaced by those of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nAnd now see the enormous magnitude to which railway passenger-traffic has\r\ngrown.  In the year 1873, 401,465,086 passengers were carried by day\r\ntickets in Great Britain alone.  But this was not all.  For in that year\r\n257,470 periodical tickets were issued by the different railways; and\r\nassuming half of them to be annual, one-fourth half-yearly, and the\r\nremainder quarterly tickets, and that their holders made only five\r\njourneys each way weekly, this would give an additional number of\r\n47,024,000 journeys, or a total of 448,489,086 passengers carried in\r\nGreat Britain in one year.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to grasp the idea of the enormous number of persons\r\nrepresented by these figures.  The mind is merely bewildered by them, and\r\ncan form no adequate notion of their magnitude.  To reckon them singly\r\nwould occupy twenty-five years, counting at the rate of one a second for\r\ntwelve hours every day.  Or take another illustration.  Supposing every\r\nman, woman, and child in Great Britain to make ten journeys by rail\r\nyearly, the number would greatly fall short of the passengers carried in\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nMr. Porter, in his 'Progress of the Nation,' estimated that thirty\r\nmillions of passengers, or about eighty-two thousand a day, travelled by\r\ncoaches in Great Britain in 1834, an average distance of twelve miles\r\neach, at an average cost of 5s. a passenger, or at the rate of 5d. a\r\nmile; whereas above 448 millions are now carried by railway an average\r\ndistance of 8.5 miles each, at an average cost of 1s. 1.5d. per\r\npassenger, or about three halfpence per mile, in considerably less than\r\none-fourth of the time.\r\n\r\nBut besides the above number of passengers, over one hundred and\r\nsixty-two million tons of minerals and merchandise were carried by\r\nrailway in the United Kingdom in 1873, besides mails, cattle, parcels,\r\nand other traffic.  The distance run by passenger and goods trains in the\r\nyear was 162,561,304 miles; to accomplish which it is estimated that four\r\nmiles of railway must have been covered by running trains during every\r\nsecond all the year round.\r\n\r\nTo perform this service, there were, in 1873, 11,255 locomotives at work\r\nin the United Kingdom, consuming about four million tons of coal and\r\ncoke, and flashing into the air every minute some forty tons of water in\r\nthe form of steam in a high state of elasticity.  There were also 24,644\r\npassenger-carriages, 9128 vans and breaks attached to passenger-trains,\r\nand 329,163 trucks, waggons, and other vehicles appropriated to\r\nmerchandise.  Buckled together, buffer to buffer, the locomotives and\r\ntenders would extend from London to Peterborough; while the carrying\r\nvehicles, joined together, would form two trains occupying a double line\r\nof railway extending from London to beyond Inverness.\r\n\r\nA notable feature in the growth of railway traffic of late years has been\r\nthe increase in the number of third-class passengers, compared with first\r\nand second class.  Sixteen years since, the third-class passengers\r\nconstituted only about one-third; ten years later, they were about\r\none-half; whereas now they form more than three-fourths of the whole\r\nnumber carried.  In 1873, there were about 23 million first-class\r\npassengers, 62 million second-class, and not less than 306 million\r\nthird-class.  Thus George Stephenson's prediction, \"that the time would\r\ncome when it would be cheaper for a working man to make a journey by\r\nrailway than to walk on foot,\" is already verified.\r\n\r\nThe degree of safety with which this great traffic has been conducted is\r\nnot the least remarkable of its features.  Of course, so long as railways\r\nare worked by men they will be liable to the imperfections belonging to\r\nall things human.  Though their machinery may be perfect and their\r\norganisation as complete as skill and forethought can make it, workmen\r\nwill at times be forgetful and listless; and a moment's carelessness may\r\nlead to the most disastrous results.  Yet, taking all circumstances into\r\naccount, the wonder is, that travelling by railway at high speed should\r\nhave been rendered comparatively so safe.\r\n\r\nTo be struck by lightning is one of the rarest of all causes of death;\r\nyet more persons are killed by lightning in Great Britain than are killed\r\non railways from causes beyond their own control.  Most persons would\r\nconsider the probability of their dying by hanging to be extremely\r\nremote; yet, according to the Registrar-General's returns, it is\r\nconsiderably greater than that of being killed by railway accident.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable safety with which railway traffic is on the whole\r\nconducted, is due to constant watchfulness and highly-applied skill.  The\r\nmen who work the railways are for the most part the picked men of the\r\ncountry, and every railway station may be regarded as a practical school\r\nof industry, attention, and punctuality.\r\n\r\nFew are aware of the complicated means and agencies that are in constant\r\noperation on railways day and night, to ensure the safety of the\r\npassengers to their journey's end.  The road is under a system of\r\ncontinuous inspection.  The railway is watched by foremen, with \"gangs\"\r\nof men under them, in lengths varying from twelve to five miles,\r\naccording to circumstances.  Their continuous duty is to see that the\r\nrails and chairs are sound, their fastenings complete, and the line clear\r\nof all obstructions.\r\n\r\nThen, at all the junctions, sidings, and crossings, pointsmen are\r\nstationed, with definite instructions as to the duties to be performed by\r\nthem.  At these places, signals are provided, worked from the station\r\nplatforms, or from special signal boxes, for the purpose of protecting\r\nthe stopping or passing trains.  When the first railways were opened, the\r\nsignals were of a very simple kind.  The station men gave them with their\r\narms stretched out in different positions; then flags of different\r\ncolours were used; next fixed signals, with arms or discs of rectangular\r\nor triangular shape.  These were followed by a complete system of\r\nsemaphore signals, near and distant, protecting all junctions, sidings,\r\nand crossings.\r\n\r\nWhen Government inspectors were first appointed by the Board of Trade to\r\nexamine and report upon the working of railways, they were alarmed by the\r\nnumber of trains following each other at some stations, in what then\r\nseemed to be a very rapid succession.  A passage from a Report written in\r\n1840 by Sir Frederick Smith, as to the traffic at \"Taylor's Junction,\" on\r\nthe York and North Midland Railway, contrasts curiously with the railway\r\nlife and activity of the present day:--\"Here,\" wrote the alarmed\r\nInspector, \"the passenger trains from York as well as Leeds and Selby,\r\nmeet four times a day.  No less than 23 passenger-trains stop at or pass\r\nthis station in the 21 hours--an amount of traffic requiring not only the\r\nutmost perfect arrangements on the part of the management, but the utmost\r\nvigilance and energy in the servants of the Company employed at this\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nContrast this with the state of things now.  On the Metropolitan Line,\r\n667 trains pass a given point in one direction or the other during the\r\neighteen hours of the working day, or an average of 36 trains an hour.\r\nAt the Cannon Street Station of the South-Eastern Railway, 627 trains\r\npass in and out daily, many of them crossing each other's tracks under\r\nthe protection of the station-signals.  Forty-five trains run in and out\r\nbetween 9 and 10 A.M., and an equal number between 4 and 5 P.M.  Again,\r\nat the Clapham Junction, near London, about 700 trains pass or stop\r\ndaily; and though to the casual observer the succession of trains coming\r\nand going, running and stopping, coupling and shunting, appears a scene\r\nof inextricable confusion and danger, the whole is clearly intelligible\r\nto the signalmen in their boxes, who work the trains in and out with\r\nextraordinary precision and regularity.\r\n\r\nThe inside of a signal-box reminds one of a pianoforte on a large scale,\r\nthe lever-handles corresponding with the keys of the instrument; and, to\r\nan uninstructed person, to work the one would be as difficult as to play\r\na tune on the other.  The signal-box outside Cannon Street Station\r\ncontains 67 lever-handles, by means of which the signalmen are enabled at\r\nthe same moment to communicate with the drivers of all the engines on the\r\nline within an area of 800 yards.  They direct by signs, which are quite\r\nas intelligible as words, the drivers of the trains starting from inside\r\nthe station, as well as those of the trains arriving from outside.  By\r\npulling a lever-handle, a distant signal, perhaps out of sight, is set\r\nsome hundred yards off, which the approaching driver--reading it quickly\r\nas he comes along--at once interprets, and stops or advances as the\r\nsignal may direct.\r\n\r\nThe precision and accuracy of the signal-machinery employed at important\r\nstations and junctions have of late years been much improved by an\r\ningenious contrivance, by means of which the setting of the signal\r\nprepares the road for the coming train.  When the signal is set at\r\n\"Danger,\" the points are at the same time worked, and the road is\r\n\"locked\" against it; and when at \"Safety,\" the road is open,--the signal\r\nand the points exactly corresponding.\r\n\r\nThe Electric Telegraph has also been found a valuable auxiliary in\r\nensuring the safe working of large railway traffics.  Though the\r\nlocomotive may run at 60 miles an hour, electricity, when at its fastest,\r\ntravels at the rate of 288,000 miles a second, and is therefore always\r\nable to herald the coming train.  The electric telegraph may, indeed, be\r\nregarded as the nervous system of the railway.  By its means the whole\r\nline is kept throbbing with intelligence.  The method of working the\r\nelectric signals varies on different lines; but the usual practice is, to\r\ndivide a line into so many lengths, each protected by its\r\nsignal-stations,--the fundamental law of telegraph-working being, that\r\ntwo engines are not to be allowed to run on the same line between two\r\nsignal-stations at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen a train passes one of such stations, it is immediately signalled\r\non--usually by electric signal-bells--to the station in advance, and that\r\ninterval of railway is \"blocked\" until the signal has been received from\r\nthe station in advance that the train has passed it.  Thus an interval of\r\nspace is always secured between trains following each other, which are\r\nthereby alike protected before and behind.  And thus, when a train starts\r\non a journey, it may be of hundreds of miles, it is signalled on from\r\nstation to station--it \"lives along the line,\"--until at length it\r\nreaches its destination and the last signal of \"train in\" is given.  By\r\nthis means an immense number of trains can be worked with regularity and\r\nsafety.  On the South-Eastern Railway, where the system has been brought\r\nto a state of high efficiency, it is no unusual thing during Easter week\r\nto send 600,000 passengers through the London Bridge Station alone; and\r\non some days as many as 1200 trains a-day.\r\n\r\nWhile such are the expedients adopted to ensure safety, others equally\r\ningenious are adopted to ensure speed.  In the case of express and mail\r\ntrains, the frequent stopping of the engines to take in a fresh supply of\r\nwater occasions a considerable loss of time on a long journey, each\r\nstoppage for this purpose occupying from ten to fifteen minutes.  To\r\navoid such stoppages, larger tenders have been provided, capable of\r\ncarrying as much as 2000 gallons of water each.  But as a considerable\r\ntime is occupied in filling these, a plan has been contrived by Mr.\r\nRamsbottom, the Locomotive Engineer of the London and North-Western\r\nRailway, by which the engines are made to _feed themselves_ while running\r\nat full speed!  The plan is as follows:--An open trough, about 440 feet\r\nlong, is laid longitudinally between the rails.  Into this trough, which\r\nis filled with water, a dip-pipe or scoop attached to the bottom of the\r\ntender of the running train is lowered; and, at a speed of 50 miles an\r\nhour, as much as 1070 gallons of water are scooped up in the course of a\r\nfew minutes.  The first of such troughs was laid down between Chester and\r\nHolyhead, to enable the Express Mail to run the distance of 841 miles in\r\ntwo hours and five minutes without stopping; and similar troughs have\r\nsince been laid down at Bushey near London, at Castlethorpe near\r\nWolverton, and at Parkside near Liverpool.  At these four troughs about\r\n130,000 gallons of water are scooped up daily.\r\n\r\nWherever railways have been made, new towns have sprung up, and old towns\r\nand cities been quickened into new life.  When the first English lines\r\nwere projected, great were the prophecies of disaster to the inhabitants\r\nof the districts through which they were proposed to be forced.  Such\r\nfears have long since been dispelled in this country.  The same\r\nprejudices existed in France.  When the railway from Paris to Marseilles\r\nwas laid out so as to pass through Lyons, a local prophet predicted that\r\nif the line were made the city would be ruined--\"_Ville traversee_,\r\n_ville perdue_;\" while a local priest denounced the locomotive and the\r\nelectric telegraph as heralding _the reign of Antichrist_.  But such\r\nnonsense is no longer uttered.  Now it is the city without the railway\r\nthat is regarded as the \"city lost;\" for it is in a measure shut out from\r\nthe rest of the world, and left outside the pale of civilisation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking of all the illustrations that could be offered\r\nof the extent to which railways facilitate the locomotion, the industry,\r\nand the subsistence of the population of large towns and cities, is\r\nafforded by the working of the railway system in connection with the\r\ncapital of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe extension of railways to London has been of comparatively recent\r\ndate; the whole of the lines connecting it with the provinces and\r\nterminating at its outskirts, having been opened during the last thirty\r\nyears, while the lines inside London have for the most part been opened\r\nwithin the last sixteen years.\r\n\r\nThe first London line was the Greenwich Railway, part of which was opened\r\nfor traffic to Deptford in February 1836.  The working of this railway\r\nwas first exhibited as a show, and the usual attractions were employed to\r\nmake it \"draw.\"  A band of musicians in the garb of the Beef-eaters was\r\nstationed at the London end, and another band at Deptford.  For\r\ncheapness' sake the Deptford band was shortly superseded by a large\r\nbarrel-organ, which played in the passengers; but, when the traffic\r\nbecame established, the barrel organ, as well as the beef-eater band at\r\nthe London end, were both discontinued.  The whole length of the line was\r\nlit up at night by a row of lamps on either side like a street, as if to\r\nenable the locomotives or the passengers to see their way in the dark;\r\nbut these lamps also were eventually discontinued as unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAs a show, the Greenwich Railway proved tolerably successful.  During the\r\nfirst eleven months it carried 456,750 passengers, or an average of about\r\n1300 a-day.  But the railway having been found more convenient to the\r\npublic than either the river boats or the omnibuses, the number of\r\npassengers rapidly increased.  When the Croydon, Brighton, and\r\nSouth-Eastern Railways began to pour their streams of traffic over the\r\nGreenwich viaduct, its accommodation was found much too limited; and it\r\nwas widened from time to time, until now nine lines of railway are laid\r\nside by side, over which more than twenty millions of passengers are\r\ncarried yearly, or an average of about 60,000 a day all the year round.\r\n\r\nSince the partial opening of the Greenwich Railway in 1836, a large\r\nextent of railways has been constructed in and about the metropolis, and\r\nconvenient stations have been established almost in the heart of the\r\nCity.  Sixteen of these stations are within a circle of half a mile\r\nradius from the Mansion House, and above three hundred stations are in\r\nactual use within about five miles of Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate this vast traffic, not fewer than 3600 local trains are\r\nrun in and out daily, besides 340 trains which depart to and arrive from\r\ndistant places, north, south, east, and west.  In the morning hours,\r\nbetween 8.30 and 10.30, when business men are proceeding inwards to their\r\noffices and counting-houses, and in the afternoon between four and six,\r\nwhen they are returning outwards to their homes, as many as two thousand\r\nstoppages are made in the hour, within the metropolitan district, for the\r\npurpose of taking up and setting down passengers, while about two miles\r\nof railway are covered by the running trains.\r\n\r\nOne of the remarkable effects of railways has been to extend the\r\nresidential area of all large towns and cities.  This is especially\r\nnotable in the case of London.  Before the introduction of railways, the\r\nresidential area of the metropolis was limited by the time occupied by\r\nbusiness men in making the journey outwards and inwards daily; and it was\r\nfor the most part bounded by Bow on the east, by Hampstead and Highgate\r\non the north, by Paddington and Kensington on the west, and by Clapham\r\nand Brixton on the south.  But now that stations have been established\r\nnear the centre of the city, and places so distant as Waltham, Barnet,\r\nWatford, Hanwell, Richmond, Epsom, Croydon, Reigate, and Erith, can be\r\nmore quickly reached by rail than the old suburban quarters were by\r\nomnibus, the metropolis has become extended in all directions along its\r\nrailway lines, and the population of London, instead of living in the\r\nCity or its immediate vicinity, as formerly, have come to occupy a\r\nresidential area of not less than six hundred square miles!\r\n\r\nThe number of new towns which have consequently sprung into existence\r\nnear London within the last twenty years has been very great; towns\r\nnumbering from ten to twenty thousand inhabitants, which before were but\r\nvillages,--if, indeed, they existed.  This has especially been the case\r\nalong the lines south of the Thames, principally in consequence of the\r\ntermini of those lines being more conveniently situated for city men of\r\nbusiness.  Hence the rapid growth of the suburban towns up and down the\r\nriver, from Richmond and Staines on the west, to Erith and Gravesend on\r\nthe east, and the hives of population which have settled on the high\r\ngrounds south of the Thames, in the neighbourhood of Norwood and the\r\nCrystal Palace, rapidly spreading over the Surrey Downs, from Wimbledon\r\nto Guildford, and from Bromley to Croydon, Epsom, and Dorking.  And now\r\nthat the towns on the south and south-east coast can be reached by city\r\nmen in little more time than it takes to travel to Clapham or Bayswater\r\nby omnibus, such places have become as it were parts of the great\r\nmetropolis, and Brighton and Hastings are but the marine suburbs of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe improved state of the communications of the City with the country has\r\nhad a marked effect upon its population.  While the action of the\r\nrailways has been to add largely to the number of persons living in\r\nLondon, it has also been accompanied by their dispersion over a much\r\nlarger area.  Thus the population of the central parts of London is\r\nconstantly decreasing, whereas that of the suburban districts is as\r\nconstantly increasing.  The population of the City fell off more than\r\n10,000 between 1851 and 1861; and during the same period, that of\r\nHolborn, the Strand, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, St. James's,\r\nWestminster, East and West London, showed a considerable decrease.  But,\r\nas regards the whole mass of the metropolitan population, the increase\r\nhas been enormous.  Thus, starting from 1801, when the population of\r\nLondon was 958,863, we find it increasing in each decennial period at the\r\nrate of between two and three hundred thousand, until the year 1841, when\r\nit amounted to 1,948,369.  Railways had by that time reached London,\r\nafter which its population increased at nearly double the former ratio.\r\nIn the ten years ending 1851, the increase was 513,867; and in the ten\r\nyears ending 1861, 441,753: until now, to quote the words of the\r\nRegistrar-General in a recent annual Report, \"the population within the\r\nregistration limits is by estimate 2,993,513; but beyond this central\r\nmass there is a ring of life growing rapidly, and extending along railway\r\nlines over a circle of fifteen miles from Charing Cross.  The population\r\nwithin that circle, patrolled by the metropolitan police, is about\r\n3,463,771\"!\r\n\r\nThe aggregation of so vast a number of persons within so comparatively\r\nlimited an area--the immense quantity of food required for their daily\r\nsustenance, as well as of fuel, clothing, and other necessaries--would be\r\nattended with no small inconvenience and danger, but for the facilities\r\nagain provided by the railways.  The provisioning of a garrison of even\r\nfour thousand men is considered a formidable affair; how much more so the\r\nprovisioning of nearly four millions of people!\r\n\r\nThe whole mystery is explained by the admirable organisation of the\r\nrailway service, and the regularity and despatch with which it is\r\nconducted.  We are enabled by the courtesy of the General Managers of the\r\nLondon railways to bring together the following brief summary of facts\r\nrelating to the food supply of London, which will probably be regarded by\r\nmost readers as of a very remarkable character.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the railways to the south of the Thames contribute\r\ncomparatively little towards the feeding of London.  They are, for the\r\nmost part passenger and residential lines, traversing a limited and not\r\nvery fertile district bounded by the sea-coast; and, excepting in fruit\r\nand vegetables, milk and hops, they probably carry more food from London\r\nthan they bring to it.  The principal supplies of grain, flour, potatoes,\r\nand fish, are brought by railway from the eastern counties of England and\r\nScotland; and of cattle and sheep, beef and mutton, from the grazing\r\ncounties of the west and north-west of Britain, as far as the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, which have, through the instrumentality of railways, become\r\npart of the great grazing grounds of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nTake first \"the staff of life\"--bread and its constituents.  Of wheat,\r\nnot less than 222,080 quarters were brought into London by railway in\r\n1867, besides what was brought by sea; of oats 151,757 quarters; of\r\nbarley 70,282 quarters; of beans and peas 51,448 quarters.  Of the wheat\r\nand barley, by far the largest proportion is brought by the Great Eastern\r\nRailway, which delivers in London in one year 155,000 quarters of wheat\r\nand 45,500 quarters of barley, besides 600,429 quarters more in the form\r\nof malt.  The largest quantity of oats is brought by the Great Northern\r\nRailway, principally from the north of England and the East of\r\nScotland,--the quantity delivered by that Company in 1867 having been\r\n97,500 quarters, besides 24,664 quarters of wheat, 5560 quarters of\r\nbarley, and 103,917 quarters of malt.  Again, of 1,250,566 sacks of flour\r\nand meal delivered in London in one year, the Great Eastern brings\r\n654,000 sacks, the Great Northern 232,022 sacks, and the Great Western\r\n136,312 sacks; the principal contribution of the London and North-Western\r\nRailway towards the London bread-stores being 100,760 boxes of American\r\nflour, besides 24,300 sacks of English.  The total quantity of malt\r\ndelivered at the London railway stations in 1867 was thirteen hundred\r\nthousand sacks.\r\n\r\nNext, as to flesh meat.  In 1867, not fewer than 172,300 head of cattle\r\nwere brought to London by railway,--though this was considerably less\r\nthan the number carried before the cattle-plague, the Great Eastern\r\nRailway alone having carried 44,672 less than in 1864.  But this loss has\r\nsince been more than made up by the increased quantities of fresh beef,\r\nmutton, and other kinds of meat imported in lieu of the live animals.\r\nThe principal supplies of cattle are brought, as we have said, by the\r\nWestern, Northern, and Eastern lines: by the Great Western from the\r\nwestern counties and Ireland; by the London and North-Western, the\r\nMidland, and the Great Northern from the northern counties and from\r\nScotland; and by the Great Eastern from the eastern counties and from the\r\nports of Harwich and Lowestoft.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, also, 1,147,609 sheep were brought to London by railway, of\r\nwhich the Great Eastern delivered not less than 265,371 head.  The London\r\nand North-Western and Great Northern between them brought 390,000 head\r\nfrom the northern English counties, with a large proportion from the\r\nScotch Highlands.  While the Great Western brought up 130,000 head from\r\nthe Welsh mountains and from the rich grazing districts of Wilts,\r\nGloucester, Somerset, and Devon.  Another important freight of the London\r\nand North-Western Railway consists of pigs, of which they delivered\r\n54,700 in London, principally Irish; while the Great Eastern brought up\r\n27,500 of the same animal, partly foreign.\r\n\r\nWhile the cattle-plague had the effect of greatly reducing the number of\r\nlive stock brought into London yearly, it gave a considerable impetus to\r\nthe Fresh Meat traffic.  Thus, in addition to the above large numbers of\r\ncattle and sheep delivered in London in 1867, the railways brought 76,175\r\ntons of meat, which--taking the meat of an average beast at 800 lbs., and\r\nof an average sheep at 64 lbs.--would be equivalent to about 112,000 more\r\ncattle, and 1,267,500 more sheep.  The Great Northern brought the largest\r\nquantity; next the London and North-Western;--these two Companies having\r\nbrought up between them, from distances as remote as Aberdeen and\r\nInverness, about 42,000 tons of fresh meat in 1867, at an average freight\r\nof about 0.5d. a lb.\r\n\r\nAgain as regards Fish, of which six-tenths of the whole quantity consumed\r\nin London is now brought by rail.  The Great Eastern and the Great\r\nNorthern are by far the largest importers of this article, and justify\r\ntheir claim to be regarded as the great food lines of London.  Of the\r\n61,358 tons of fish brought by railway in 1867, not less than 24,500 tons\r\nwere delivered by the former, and 22,000 tons, brought from much longer\r\ndistances, by the latter Company.  The London and North-Western brought\r\nabout 6000 tons, the principal part of which was salmon from Scotland and\r\nIreland.  The Great Western also brought about 4000 tons, partly salmon,\r\nbut the greater part mackerel from the south-west coast.  During the\r\nmackerel season, as much as a hundred tons at a time are brought into the\r\nPaddington Station by express fish-train from Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe Great Eastern and Great Northern Companies are also the principal\r\ncarriers of turkeys, geese, fowls, and game; the quantity delivered in\r\nLondon by the former Company having been 5042 tons.  In Christmas week no\r\nfewer than 30,000 turkeys and geese were delivered at the Bishopsgate\r\nStation, besides about 300 tons of poultry, 10,000 barrels of beer, and\r\nimmense quantities of fish, oysters, and other kinds of food.  As much as\r\n1600 tons of poultry and game were brought last year by the South-Western\r\nRailway; 600 tons by the Great Northern Railway; and 130 tons of turkeys,\r\ngeese, and fowls, by the London, Chatham and Dover line, principally from\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOf miscellaneous articles, the Great Northern and the Midland each\r\nbrought about 3000 tons of cheese, the South-Western 2600 tons, and the\r\nLondon and North-Western 10,034 cheeses in number; while the\r\nSouth-Western and Brighton lines brought a splendid contribution to the\r\nLondon breakfast-table in the shape of 11,259 _tons_ of French eggs;\r\nthese two Companies delivering between them an average of more than three\r\nmillions of eggs a week all the year round!  The same Companies delivered\r\nin London 14,819 tons of butter, for the most part the produce of the\r\nfarms of Normandy,--the greater cleanness and neatness with which the\r\nNormandy butter is prepared for market rendering it a favourite both with\r\ndealers and consumers of late years compared with Irish butter.  The\r\nLondon, Chatham and Dover Company also brought from Calais 96 tons of\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nNext, as to the potatoes, vegetables, and fruit, brought by rail.  Forty\r\nyears since, the inhabitants of London relied for their supply of\r\nvegetables on the garden-grounds in the immediate neighbourhood of the\r\nmetropolis, and the consequence was that they were both very dear and\r\nlimited in quantity.  But railways, while they have extended the\r\ngrazing-grounds of London as far as the Highlands, have at the same time\r\nextended the garden-grounds of London into all the adjoining\r\ncounties--into East Kent, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, the vale of\r\nGloucester, and even as far as Penzance in Cornwall.  The London, Chatham\r\nand Dover, one of the youngest of our main lines, brought up from East\r\nKent in 1867 5279 tons of potatoes, 1046 tons of vegetables, and 5386\r\ntons of fruit, besides 542 tons of vegetables from France.  The\r\nSouth-Eastern brought 25,163 tons of the same produce.  The Great Eastern\r\nbrought from the eastern counties 21,315 tons of potatoes, and 3596 tons\r\nof vegetables and fruit; while the Great Northern brought no less than\r\n78,505 tons of potatoes--a large part of them from the east of\r\nScotland--and 3768 tons of vegetables and fruit.  About 6000 tons of\r\nearly potatoes were brought from Cornwall, with about 5000 tons of\r\nbroccoli, and the quantities are steadily increasing.  \"Truly London hath\r\na large belly,\" said old Fuller, two hundred years since.  But how much\r\nmore capacious is it now!\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking illustrations of the utility of railways in\r\ncontributing to the supply of wholesome articles of food to the\r\npopulation of large cities, is to be found in the rapid growth of the\r\ntraffic in Milk.  Readers of newspapers may remember the descriptions\r\npublished some years since of the horrid dens in which London cows were\r\npenned, and of the odious compound sold by the name of milk, of which the\r\nleast deleterious ingredient in it was supplied by the \"cow with the iron\r\ntail.\"  That state of affairs is now completely changed.  What with the\r\ngreatly improved state of the London dairies and the better quality of\r\nthe milk supplied by them, together with the large quantities brought by\r\nrailway from a range of a hundred miles and more all round London, even\r\nthe poorest classes in the metropolis are now enabled to obtain as\r\nwholesome a supply of the article as the inhabitants of most country\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nThese great streams of food, which we have thus so summarily described,\r\nflow into London so continuously and uninterruptedly, that comparatively\r\nfew persons are aware of the magnitude and importance of the process thus\r\ndaily going forward.  Though gathered from an immense extent of\r\ncountry--embracing England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland--the influx is\r\nso unintermitted that it is relied upon with as much certainty as if it\r\nonly came from the counties immediately adjoining London.  The express\r\nmeat-train from Aberdeen arrives in town as punctually as the Clapham\r\nomnibus, and the express milk-train from Aylesbury is as regular in its\r\ndelivery as the penny post.  Indeed London now depends so much upon\r\nrailways for its subsistence, that it may be said to be fed by them from\r\nday to day, having never more than a few days' food in stock.  And the\r\nsupply is so regular and continuous, that the possibility of its being\r\ninterrupted never for a moment occurs to any one.  Yet in these days of\r\nstrikes amongst workmen, such a contingency is quite within the limits of\r\npossibility.  Another contingency, which might arise during a state of\r\nwar, is probably still more remote.  But were it possible for a war to\r\noccur between England and a combination of foreign powers possessed of\r\nstronger ironclads than ours, and that they were able to ram our ships\r\nback into port and land an enemy of overpowering force on the Essex\r\ncoast, it would be sufficient for them to occupy or cut the railways\r\nleading from the north, to starve London into submission in less than a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nBesides supplying London with food, railways have also been instrumental\r\nin ensuring the more regular and economical supply of fuel,--a matter of\r\nalmost as vital importance to the population in a climate such as that of\r\nEngland.  So long as the market was supplied with coal brought by sea in\r\nsailing ships, fuel in winter often rose to a famine price, especially\r\nduring long-continued easterly winds.  But now that railways are in full\r\nwork, the price is almost as steady in winter as in summer, and (but for\r\nstrikes) the supply is more regular at all seasons.\r\n\r\nBut the carriage of food and fuel to London forms but a small part of the\r\nmerchandise traffic carried by railway.  Above 600,000 tons of goods of\r\nvarious kinds yearly pass through one station only, that of the London\r\nand North-Western Company, at Camden Town; and sometimes as many as\r\n20,000 parcels daily.  Every other metropolitan station is similarly\r\nalive with traffic inwards and outwards, London having since the\r\nintroduction of railways become more than ever a great distributive\r\ncentre, to which merchandise of all kinds converges, and from which it is\r\ndistributed to all parts of the country.  Mr. Bazley, M.P., stated at a\r\nlate public meeting at Manchester, that it would probably require ten\r\nmillions of horses to convey by road the merchandise traffic which is now\r\nannually carried by railway.\r\n\r\nRailways have also proved of great value in connection with the Cheap\r\nPostage system.  By their means it has become possible to carry letters,\r\nnewspapers, books and post parcels, in any quantity, expeditiously, and\r\ncheaply.  The Liverpool and Manchester line was no sooner opened in 1830,\r\nthan the Post Office authorities recognised its utility, and used it for\r\ncarrying the mails between the two towns.  When the London and Birmingham\r\nline was opened eight years later, mail trains were at once put on,--the\r\ndirectors undertaking to perform the distance of 113 miles within 5 hours\r\nby day and 5.5 hours by night.  As additional lines were opened, the old\r\nfour-horse mail coaches were gradually discontinued, until in 1858, the\r\nlast of them, the \"Derby Dilly,\" which ran between Manchester and Derby,\r\nwas taken off on the opening of the Midland line to Rowsley.\r\n\r\nThe increased accommodation provided by railways was found of essential\r\nimportance, more particularly after the adoption of the Cheap Postage\r\nsystem; and that such accommodation was needed will be obvious from the\r\nextraordinary increase which has taken place in the number of letters and\r\npackets sent by post.  Thus, in 1839, the number of chargeable letters\r\ncarried was only 76 millions, and of newspapers 44.5 millions; whereas,\r\nin 1865, the numbers of letters had increased to 720 millions, and in\r\n1867 to 775 millions, or more than ten-fold, while the number of\r\nnewspapers, books, samples and patterns (a new branch of postal business\r\nbegan in 1864) had increased, in 1865, to 98.5 millions.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate this largely-increasing traffic, the bulk of which is\r\ncarried by railway, the mileage run by mail trains in the United Kingdom\r\nhas increased from 25,000 miles a day in 1854 (the first year of which we\r\nhave any return of the mileage run) to 60,000 miles a day in 1867, or an\r\nincrease of 240 per cent.  The Post Office expenditure on railway service\r\nhas also increased, but not in like proportion, having been 364,000\r\npounds in the former year, and 559,575 pounds in the latter, or an\r\nincrease of 154 per cent.  The revenue, gross and net, has increased\r\nstill more rapidly.  In 1841, the first complete year of the Cheap\r\nPostage system, the gross revenue was 1,359,466 pounds and the net\r\nrevenue 500,789 pounds; in 1854, the gross revenue was 2,574,407 pounds,\r\nand the net revenue 1,173,723 pounds; and in 1867, the gross revenue was\r\n4,548,129 pounds, and the net revenue 2,127,125 pounds, being an increase\r\nof 420 per cent. compared with 1841, and of 180 per cent. compared with\r\n1854.  How much of this net increase might fairly be credited to the\r\nRailway Postal service we shall not pretend to say; but assuredly the\r\nproportion must be very considerable.\r\n\r\nOne of the great advantages of railways in connection with the postal\r\nservice is the greatly increased frequency of communication which they\r\nprovide between all the large towns.  Thus Liverpool has now six\r\ndeliveries of Manchester letters daily; while every large town in the\r\nkingdom has two or more deliveries of London letters daily.  In 1863, 393\r\ntowns had two mails daily from London; 50 had three mails daily; 7 had\r\nfour mails a day _from_ London, and 15 had four mails a day _to_ London;\r\nwhile 3 towns had five mails a day _from_ London, and 6 had five mails a\r\nday _to_ London.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the railway mail train, as of the passenger train, is\r\nits capacity to carry any quantity of letters and post parcels that may\r\nrequire to be carried.  In 1838, the aggregate weight of all the evening\r\nmails despatched from London by twenty-eight mail coaches was 4 tons 6\r\ncwt., or an average of about 3.25 cwt. each, though the maximum contract\r\nweight was 15 cwt.  The mails now are necessarily much heavier, the\r\nnumber of letters and packets having, as we have seen, increased more\r\nthan ten-fold since 1839.  But it is not the ordinary so much as the\r\nextraordinary mails that are of considerable weight,--more particularly\r\nthe American, the Continental, and the Australian mails.  It is no\r\nunusual thing, we are informed, for the last-mentioned mail to weigh as\r\nmuch as 40 tons.  How many of the old mail coaches it would take to carry\r\nsuch a mail the 79 miles journey to Southampton, with a relay of four\r\nhorses every five or seven miles, is a problem for the arithmetician to\r\nsolve.  But even supposing each coach to be loaded to the maximum weight\r\nof 15 cwt. per coach, it would require about sixty vehicles and about\r\n1700 horses to carry the 40 tons, besides the coachman and guards.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the financial management of railways, there can\r\nbe no doubt as to the great benefits conferred by them on the public\r\nwherever made.  Even those railways which have exhibited the most\r\n\"frightful examples\" of financing and jobbing, have been found to prove\r\nof unquestionable public convenience and utility.  And notwithstanding\r\nall the faults and imperfections that have been alleged against railways,\r\nwe think that they must, nevertheless, be recognised as by far the most\r\nvaluable means of communication between men and nations that has yet been\r\ngiven to the world.\r\n\r\nThe author's object in publishing this book in its original form, was to\r\ndescribe, in connection with the 'Life of George Stephenson,' the origin\r\nand progress of the railway system,--to show by what moral and material\r\nagencies its founders were enabled to carry their ideas into effect, and\r\nwork out results which even then were of a remarkable character, though\r\nthey have since, as above described, become so much more extraordinary.\r\nThe favour with which successive editions of the book have been received,\r\nhas justified the author in his anticipation that such a narrative would\r\nprove of general, if not of permanent interest.\r\n\r\nThe book was written with the concurrence and assistance of Robert\r\nStephenson, who also supplied the necessary particulars relating to\r\nhimself.  Such portions of these were accordingly embodied in the\r\nnarrative as could with propriety be published during his lifetime, and\r\nthe remaining portions have since been added, with the object of\r\nrendering more complete the record of the son's life as well as of the\r\nearly history of the Railway system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n

COAL-FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no quarter of England have greater changes been wrought by the\r\nsuccessive advances made in the practical science of engineering than in\r\nthe extensive colliery districts of the North, of which\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne is the centre and the capital.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the Romans planted a colony at Newcastle, throwing a\r\nbridge across the Tyne near the site of the low-level bridge shown in the\r\nprefixed engraving, and erecting a strong fortification above it on the\r\nhigh ground now occupied by the Central Railway Station.  North and\r\nnorth-west lay a wild country, abounding in moors, mountains, and\r\nmorasses, but occupied to a certain extent by fierce and barbarous\r\ntribes.  To defend the young colony against their ravages, a strong wall\r\nwas built by the Romans, extending from Wallsend on the north bank of the\r\nTyne, a few miles below Newcastle, across the country to Burgh-upon-Sands\r\non the Solway Firth.  The remains of the wall are still to be traced in\r\nthe less populous hill-districts of Northumberland.  In the neighbourhood\r\nof Newcastle they have been gradually effaced by the works of succeeding\r\ngenerations, though the \"Wallsend\" coal consumed in our household fires\r\nstill serves to remind us of the great Roman work.\r\n\r\n                   [Picture: Map of Newcastle District]\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the Romans, Northumbria became planted by\r\nimmigrant Saxons from North Germany and Norsemen from Scandinavia, whose\r\nEorls or Earls made Newcastle their principal seat.  Then came the\r\nNormans, from whose _New_ Castle, built some eight hundred years since,\r\nthe town derived its present name.  The keep of this venerable structure,\r\nblack with age and smoke, still stands entire at the northern end of the\r\nnoble high-level bridge--the utilitarian work of modern times thus\r\nconfronting the warlike relic of the older civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe nearness of Newcastle to the Scotch Border was a great hindrance to\r\nits security and progress in the middle ages of English history.  Indeed,\r\nthe district between it and Berwick continued to be ravaged by\r\nmoss-troopers long after the union of the Crowns.  The gentry lived in\r\ntheir strong Peel castles; even the larger farm-houses were fortified;\r\nand bloodhounds were trained for the purpose of tracking the\r\ncattle-reavers to their retreats in the hills.  The Judges of Assize rode\r\nfrom Carlisle to Newcastle guarded by an escort armed to the teeth.  A\r\ntribute called \"dagger and protection money\" was annually paid by the\r\nSheriff of Newcastle for the purpose of providing daggers and other\r\nweapons for the escort; and, though the need of such protection has long\r\nsince ceased, the tribute continues to be paid in broad gold pieces of\r\nthe time of Charles the First.\r\n\r\nUntil about the middle of last century the roads across Northumberland\r\nwere little better than horse-tracks, and not many years since the\r\nprimitive agricultural cart with solid wooden wheels was almost as common\r\nin the western parts of the county as it is in Spain now.  The tract of\r\nthe old Roman road continued to be the most practicable route between\r\nNewcastle and Carlisle, the traffic between the two towns having been\r\ncarried along it upon packhorses until a comparatively recent period.\r\n\r\nSince that time great changes have taken place on the Tyne.  When wood\r\nfor firing became scarce and dear, and the forests of the South of\r\nEngland were found inadequate to supply the increasing demand for fuel,\r\nattention was turned to the rich stores of coal lying underground in the\r\nneighbourhood of Newcastle and Durham.  It then became an article of\r\nincreasing export, and \"seacoal\" fires gradually supplanted those of\r\nwood.  Hence an old writer described Newcastle as \"the Eye of the North,\r\nand the Hearth that warmeth the South parts of this kingdom with Fire.\"\r\nFuel has become the staple product of the district, the quantity exported\r\nincreasing from year to year, until the coal raised from these northern\r\nmines amounts to upwards of sixteen millions of tons a year, of which not\r\nless than nine millions are annually conveyed away by sea.\r\n\r\nNewcastle has in the mean time spread in all directions far beyond its\r\nancient boundaries.  From a walled mediaeval town of monks and merchants,\r\nit has been converted into a busy centre of commerce and manufactures\r\ninhabited by nearly 100,000 people.  It is no longer a Border fortress--a\r\n\"shield and defence against the invasions and frequent insults of the\r\nScots,\" as described in ancient charters--but a busy centre of peaceful\r\nindustry, and the outlet for a vast amount of steam-power, which is\r\nexported in the form of coal to all parts of the world.  Newcastle is in\r\nmany respects a town of singular and curious interest, especially in its\r\nolder parts, which are full of crooked lanes and narrow streets, wynds,\r\nand chares, {4} formed by tall, antique houses, rising tier above tier\r\nalong the steep northern bank of the Tyne, as the similarly precipitous\r\nstreets of Gateshead crowd the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nAll over the coal region, which extends from the Coquet to the Tees,\r\nabout fifty miles from north to south, the surface of the soil exhibits\r\nthe signs of extensive underground workings.  As you pass through the\r\ncountry at night, the earth looks as if it were bursting with fire at\r\nmany points; the blaze of coke-ovens, iron-furnaces, and coal-heaps\r\nreddening the sky to such a distance that the horizon seems to be a\r\nglowing belt of fire.\r\n\r\nFrom the necessity which existed for facilitating the transport of coals\r\nfrom the pits to the shipping places, it is easy to understand how the\r\nrailway and the locomotive should have first found their home in such a\r\ndistrict as we have thus briefly described.  At an early period the coal\r\nwas carried to the boats in panniers, or in sacks upon horses' backs.\r\nThen carts were used, to facilitate the progress of which tramways of\r\nflag-stone were laid down.  This led to the enlargement of the vehicle,\r\nwhich became known as a waggon, and it was mounted on four wheels instead\r\nof two.  A local writer about the middle of the seventeenth century says,\r\n\"Many thousand people are engaged in this trade of coals; many live by\r\nworking of them in the pits; and many live by conveying them in waggons\r\nand wains to the river Tyne.\"\r\n\r\nStill further to facilitate the haulage of the waggons, pieces of\r\nplanking were laid parallel upon wooden sleepers, or imbedded in the\r\nordinary track, by which friction was still further diminished.  It is\r\nsaid that these wooden rails were first employed by one Beaumont, about\r\n1630; and on a road thus laid, a single horse was capable of drawing a\r\nlarge loaded waggon from the coal-pit to the shipping staith.  Roger\r\nNorth, in 1676, found the practice had become extensively adopted, and he\r\nspeaks of the large sums then paid for way-leaves; that is, the\r\npermission granted by the owners of lands lying between the coal-pit and\r\nthe river-side to lay down a tramway between the one and the other.  A\r\ncentury later, Arthur Young observed that not only had these roads become\r\ngreatly multiplied, but important works had been constructed to carry\r\nthem along upon the same level.  \"The coal-waggon roads from the pits to\r\nthe water,\" he says, \"are great works, carried over all sorts of\r\ninequalities of ground, so far as the distance of nine or ten miles.  The\r\ntracks of the wheels are marked with pieces of wood let into the road for\r\nthe wheels of the waggons to run on, by which one horse is enabled to\r\ndraw, and that with ease, fifty or sixty bushels of coals.\" {5}\r\n\r\nSimilar waggon-roads were laid down in the coal districts of Wales,\r\nCumberland, and Scotland.  At the time of the Scotch rebellion in 1745, a\r\ntramroad existed between the Tranent coal-pits and the small harbour of\r\nCockenzie in East Lothian; and a portion of the line was selected by\r\nGeneral Cope as a position for his cannon at the battle of Prestonpans.\r\n\r\nIn these rude wooden tracks we find the germ of the modern railroad.\r\nImprovements were gradually made in them.  Thus, at some collieries, thin\r\nplates of iron were nailed upon their upper surface, for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the parts most exposed to friction.  Cast-iron rails were also\r\ntried, the wooden rails having been found liable to rot.  The first rails\r\nof this kind are supposed to have been used at Whitehaven as early as\r\n1738.  This cast-iron road was denominated a \"plate-way,\" from the\r\nplate-like form in which the rails were cast.  In 1767, as appears from\r\nthe books of the Coalbrookdale Iron Works, in Shropshire, five or six\r\ntons of rails were cast, as an experiment, on the suggestion of Mr.\r\nReynolds, one of the partners; and they were shortly after laid down to\r\nform a road.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, a cast-iron tramway, nailed to wooden sleepers, was laid down at\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk's colliery near Sheffield.  The person who designed\r\nand constructed this coal line was Mr. John Curr, whose son has\r\nerroneously claimed for him the invention of the cast-iron railway.  He\r\ncertainly adopted it early, and thereby met the fate of men before their\r\nage; for his plan was opposed by the labouring people of the colliery,\r\nwho got up a riot in which they tore up the road and burnt the\r\ncoal-staith, whilst Mr. Curr fled into a neighbouring wood for\r\nconcealment, and lay there _perdu_ for three days and nights, to escape\r\nthe fury of the populace.  The plates of these early tramways had a ledge\r\ncast on their edge to guide the wheel along the road, after the manner\r\nshown in the annexed cut.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: Flange rail]\r\n\r\nIn 1789, Mr. William Jessop constructed a railway at Loughborough, in\r\nLeicestershire, and there introduced the cast-iron edge-rail, with\r\nflanches cast upon the tire of the waggon-wheels to keep them on the\r\ntrack, instead of having the margin or flanch cast upon the rail itself;\r\nand this plan was shortly after adopted in other places.  In 1800, Mr.\r\nBenjamin Outram, of Little Eaton, in Derbyshire (father of the\r\ndistinguished General Outram), used stone props instead of timber for\r\nsupporting the ends or joinings of the rails.  Thus the use of railroads,\r\nin various forms, gradually extended, until they were found in general\r\nuse all over the mining districts.\r\n\r\nSuch was the growth of the railway, which, it will be observed,\r\noriginated in necessity, and was modified according to experience;\r\nprogress in this, as in all departments of mechanics, having been\r\neffected by the exertions of many men, one generation entering upon the\r\nlabours of that which preceded it, and carrying them onward to further\r\nstages of improvement.  We shall afterwards find that the invention of\r\nthe locomotive was made by like successive steps.  It was not the\r\ninvention of one man, but of a succession of men, each working at the\r\nproper hour, and according to the needs of that hour; one inventor\r\ninterpreting only the first word of the problem which his successors were\r\nto solve after long and laborious efforts and experiments.  \"The\r\nlocomotive is not the invention of one man,\" said Robert Stephenson at\r\nNewcastle, \"but of a nation of mechanical engineers.\"\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances which led to the rapid extension of railways in\r\nthe coal districts of the north tended to direct the attention of the\r\nmining engineers to the early development of the powers of the\r\nsteam-engine as a useful instrument of motive power.  The necessity which\r\nexisted for a more effective method of hauling the coals from the pits to\r\nthe shipping places was constantly present to many minds; and the daily\r\npursuits of a large class of mechanics occupied in the management of\r\nsteam power, by which the coal was raised from the pits, and the mines\r\nwere pumped clear of water, had the effect of directing their attention\r\nto the same agency as the best means for accomplishing that object.\r\n\r\nAmong the upper-ground workmen employed at the coal-pits, the principal\r\nare the firemen, enginemen, and brakes-men, who fire and work the\r\nengines, and superintend the machinery by means of which the collieries\r\nare worked.  Previous to the introduction of the steam-engine the usual\r\nmachine employed for the purpose was what is called a \"gin.\"  The gin\r\nconsists of a large drum placed horizontally, round which ropes attached\r\nto buckets and corves are wound, which are thus drawn up or sent down the\r\nshafts by a horse travelling in a circular track or \"gin race.\"  This\r\nmethod was employed for drawing up both coals and water, and it is still\r\nused for the same purpose in small collieries; but where the quantity of\r\nwater to be raised is great, pumps worked by steam power are called into\r\nrequisition.\r\n\r\nNewcomen's atmospheric engine was first made use of to work the pumps;\r\nand it continued to be so employed long after the more powerful and\r\neconomical condensing engine of Watt had been invented.  In the Newcomen\r\nor \"fire engine,\" as it was called, the power is produced by the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere forcing down the piston in the cylinder, on a vacuum\r\nbeing produced within it by condensation of the contained steam by means\r\nof cold water injection.  The piston-rod is attached to one end of a\r\nlever, whilst the pump-rod works in connexion with the other,--the\r\nhydraulic action employed to raise the water being exactly similar to\r\nthat of a common sucking-pump.\r\n\r\nThe working of a Newcomen engine was a clumsy and apparently a very\r\npainful process, accompanied by an extraordinary amount of wheezing,\r\nsighing, creaking, and bumping.  When the pump descended, there was heard\r\na plunge, a heavy sigh, and a loud bump: then, as it rose, and the sucker\r\nbegan to act, there was heard a croak, a wheeze, another bump, and then a\r\nstrong rush of water as it was lifted and poured out.  Where engines of a\r\nmore powerful and improved description are used, the quantity of water\r\nraised is enormous--as much as a million and a half gallons in the\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe pitmen, or \"the lads belaw,\" who work out the coal below ground, are\r\na peculiar class, quite distinct from the workmen on the surface.  They\r\nare a people with peculiar habits, manners, and character, as much as\r\nfishermen and sailors, to whom, indeed, they bear, in some respects, a\r\nconsiderable resemblance.  Some fifty years since they were a much\r\nrougher and worse educated class than they are now; hard workers, but\r\nvery wild and uncouth; much given to \"steeks,\" or strikes; and\r\ndistinguished, in their hours of leisure and on pay-nights, for their\r\nlove of cock-fighting, dog-fighting, hard drinking, and cuddy races.  The\r\npay-night was a fortnightly saturnalia, in which the pitman's character\r\nwas fully brought out, especially when the \"yel\" was good.  Though\r\nearning much higher wages than the ordinary labouring population of the\r\nupper soil, the latter did not mix nor intermarry with them; so that they\r\nwere left to form their own communities, and hence their marked\r\npeculiarities as a class.  Indeed, a sort of traditional disrepute seems\r\nlong to have clung to the pitmen, arising perhaps from the nature of\r\ntheir employment, and from the circumstance that the colliers were among\r\nthe last classes enfranchised in England, as they were certainly the last\r\nin Scotland, where they continued bondmen down to the end of last\r\ncentury.  The last thirty years, however, have worked a great improvement\r\nin the moral condition of the Northumbrian pitmen; the abolition of the\r\ntwelve months' bond to the mine, and the substitution of a month's notice\r\nprevious to leaving, having given them greater freedom and opportunity\r\nfor obtaining employment; and day-schools and Sunday-schools, together\r\nwith the important influences of railways, have brought them fully up to\r\na level with the other classes of the labouring population.\r\n\r\nThe coals, when raised from the pits, are emptied into the waggons placed\r\nalongside, from whence they are sent along the rails to the staiths\r\nerected by the river-side, the waggons sometimes descending by their own\r\ngravity along inclined planes, the waggoner standing behind to check the\r\nspeed by means of a convoy or wooden brake bearing upon the rims of the\r\nwheels.  Arrived at the staiths, the waggons are emptied at once into the\r\nships waiting alongside for cargo.  Any one who has sailed down the Tyne\r\nfrom Newcastle Bridge cannot but have been struck with the appearance of\r\nthe immense staiths, constructed of timber, which are erected at short\r\ndistances from each other on both sides of the river.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Coal-Staith on the Tyne]\r\n\r\nBut a great deal of the coal shipped from the Tyne comes from\r\nabove-bridge, where sea-going craft cannot reach, and is floated down the\r\nriver in \"keels,\" in which the coals are sometimes piled up according to\r\nconvenience when large, or, when the coal is small or tender, it is\r\nconveyed in tubs to prevent breakage.  These keels are of a very ancient\r\nmodel,--perhaps the oldest extant in England: they are even said to be of\r\nthe same build as those in which the Norsemen navigated the Tyne\r\ncenturies ago.  The keel is a tubby, grimy-looking craft, rounded fore\r\nand aft, with a single large square sail, which the keel-bullies, as the\r\nTyne watermen are called, manage with great dexterity; the vessel being\r\nguided by the aid of the \"swape,\" or great oar, which is used as a kind\r\nof rudder at the stern of the vessel.  These keelmen are an exceedingly\r\nhardy class of workmen, not by any means so quarrelsome as their\r\ndesignation of \"bully\" would imply--the word being merely derived from\r\nthe obsolete term \"boolie,\" or beloved, an appellation still in familiar\r\nuse amongst brother workers in the coal districts.  One of the most\r\ncurious sights upon the Tyne is the fleet of hundreds of these\r\nblack-sailed, black-hulled keels, bringing down at each tide their black\r\ncargoes for the ships at anchor in the deep water at Shields and other\r\nparts of the river below Newcastle.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary observations will perhaps be sufficient to explain the\r\nmeaning of many of the occupations alluded to, and the phrases employed,\r\nin the course of the following narrative, some of which might otherwise\r\nhave been comparatively unintelligible to the general reader.\r\n\r\n                         [Picture: Coal Waggons]\r\n\r\n                  [Picture: Wylam Colliery and Village]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nWYLAM AND DEWLEY BURN--GEORGE STEPHENSON'S EARLY YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colliery village of Wylam is situated on the north bank of the Tyne,\r\nabout eight miles west of Newcastle.  The Newcastle and Carlisle railway\r\nruns along the opposite bank; and the traveller by that line sees the\r\nusual signs of a colliery in the unsightly pumping-engines surrounded by\r\nheaps of ashes, coal-dust, and slag; whilst a neighbouring iron-furnace\r\nin full blast throws out dense smoke and loud jets of steam by day and\r\nlurid flames at night.  These works form the nucleus of the village,\r\nwhich is almost entirely occupied by coal-miners and iron-furnacemen.\r\nThe place is remarkable for its large population, but not for its\r\ncleanness or neatness as a village; the houses, as in most colliery\r\nvillages, being the property of the owners or lessees, who employ them in\r\ntemporarily accommodating the workpeople, against whose earnings there is\r\na weekly set-off for house and coals.  About the end of last century the\r\nestate of which Wylam forms part, belonged to Mr. Blackett, a gentleman\r\nof considerable celebrity in coal-mining, then more generally known as\r\nthe proprietor of the 'Globe' newspaper.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to interest one in the village itself.  But a few\r\nhundred yards from its eastern extremity stands a humble detached\r\ndwelling, which will be interesting to many as the birthplace of one of\r\nthe most remarkable men of our times--George Stephenson, the Railway\r\nEngineer.  It is a common two-storied, red-tiled, rubble house, portioned\r\noff into four labourers' apartments.  It is known by the name of High\r\nStreet House, and was originally so called because it stands by the side\r\nof what used to be the old riding post road or street between Newcastle\r\nand Hexham, along which the post was carried on horseback within the\r\nmemory of persons living.\r\n\r\nThe lower room in the west end of this house was the home of the\r\nStephenson family; and there George Stephenson was born, the second of a\r\nfamily of six children, on the 9th of June, 1781.  The apartment is now,\r\nwhat it was then, an ordinary labourer's dwelling,--its walls are\r\nunplastered, its floor is of clay, and the bare rafters are exposed\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson, or \"Old Bob,\" as the neighbours familiarly called him,\r\nand his wife Mabel, were a respectable couple, careful and hard-working.\r\nIt is said that Robert Stephenson's father was a Scotchman, and came into\r\nEngland as a gentleman's servant.  Mabel, his wife, was the daughter of\r\nRobert Carr, a dyer at Ovingham.  When first married, they lived at\r\nWalbottle, a village situated between Wylam and Newcastle, afterwards\r\nremoving to Wylam, where Robert was employed as fireman of the old\r\npumping engine at that colliery.\r\n\r\n [Picture: High-street House, Wylam, the Birthplace of George Stephenson]\r\n\r\nAn old Wylam collier, who remembered George Stephenson's father, thus\r\ndescribed him:--\"Geordie's fayther war like a peer o' deals nailed\r\nthegither, an' a bit o' flesh i' th' inside; he war as queer as Dick's\r\nhatband--went thrice aboot, an' wudn't tie.  His wife Mabel war a\r\ndelicat' boddie, an' varry flighty.  Thay war an honest family, but sair\r\nhadden doon i' th' world.\"  Indeed, the earnings of old Robert did not\r\namount to more than twelve shillings a week; and, as there were six\r\nchildren to maintain, the family, during their stay at Wylam, were\r\nnecessarily in very straitened circumstances.  The father's wages being\r\nbarely sufficient, even with the most rigid economy, for the sustenance\r\nof the household, there was little to spare for clothing, and nothing for\r\neducation, so none of the children were sent to school.\r\n\r\nOld Robert was a general favourite in the village, especially amongst the\r\nchildren, whom he was accustomed to draw about him whilst tending the\r\nengine-fire, and feast their young imaginations with tales of Sinbad the\r\nSailor and Robinson Crusoe, besides others of his own invention; so that\r\n\"Bob's engine-fire\" came to be the most popular resort in the village.\r\nAnother feature in his character, by which he was long remembered, was\r\nhis affection for birds and animals; and he had many tame favourites of\r\nboth sorts, which were as fond of resorting to his engine-fire as the\r\nboys and girls themselves.  In the winter time he had usually a flock of\r\ntame robins about him; and they would come hopping familiarly to his feet\r\nto pick up the crumbs which he had saved for them out of his humble\r\ndinner.  At his cottage he was rarely without one or more tame\r\nblackbirds, which flew about the house, or in and out at the door.  In\r\nsummer-time he would go a-birdnesting with his children; and one day he\r\ntook his little son George to see a blackbird's nest for the first time.\r\nHolding him up in his arms, he let the wondering boy peep down, through\r\nthe branches held aside for the purpose, into a nest full of young\r\nbirds--a sight which the boy never forgot, but used to speak of with\r\ndelight to his intimate friends when he himself had grown an old man.\r\n\r\nThe boy George led the ordinary life of working-people's children.  He\r\nplayed about the doors; went birdnesting when he could; and ran errands\r\nto the village.  He was also an eager listener, with the other children,\r\nto his father's curious tales; and he early imbibed from him that\r\naffection for birds and animals which continued throughout his life.  In\r\ncourse of time he was promoted to the office of carrying his father's\r\ndinner to him while at work, and it was on such occasions his great\r\ndelight to see the robins fed.  At home he helped to nurse, and that with\r\na careful hand, his younger brothers and sisters.  One of his duties was\r\nto see that the other children were kept out of the way of the chaldron\r\nwaggons, which were then dragged by horses along the wooden tramroad\r\nimmediately in front of the cottage-door.  This waggon-way was the first\r\nin the northern district on which the experiment of a locomotive engine\r\nwas tried.  But at the time of which we speak, the locomotive had\r\nscarcely been dreamt of in England as a practicable working power; horses\r\nonly were used to haul the coal; and one of the first sights with which\r\nthe boy was familiar was the coal-waggons dragged by them along the\r\nwooden railway at Wylam.\r\n\r\nThus eight years passed; after which, the coal having been worked out,\r\nthe old engine, which had grown \"dismal to look at,\" as one of the\r\nworkmen described it, was pulled down; and then Robert, having obtained\r\nemployment as a fireman at the Dewley Burn Colliery, removed with his\r\nfamily to that place.  Dewley Burn, at this day, consists of a few\r\nold-fashioned low-roofed cottages standing on either side of a babbling\r\nlittle stream.  They are connected by a rustic wooden bridge, which spans\r\nthe rift in front of the doors.  In the central one-roomed cottage of\r\nthis group, on the right bank, Robert Stephenson lived for a time with\r\nhis family; the pit at which he worked standing in the rear of the\r\ncottages.\r\n\r\nYoung though he was, George was now of an age to be able to contribute\r\nsomething towards the family maintenance; for in a poor man's house,\r\nevery child is a burden until his little hands can be turned to\r\nprofitable account.  That the boy was shrewd and active, and possessed of\r\na ready mother wit, will be evident enough from the following incident.\r\nOne day his sister Nell went into Newcastle to buy a bonnet; and Geordie\r\nwent with her \"for company.\"  At a draper's shop in the Bigg Market, Nell\r\nfound a \"chip\" quite to her mind, but on pricing it, alas! it was found\r\nto be fifteen pence beyond her means, and she left the shop very much\r\ndisappointed.  But Geordie said, \"Never heed, Nell; see if I canna win\r\nsiller enough to buy the bonnet; stand ye there, till I come back.\"  Away\r\nran the boy and disappeared amidst the throng of the market, leaving the\r\ngirl to wait his return.  Long and long she waited, until it grew dusk,\r\nand the market people had nearly all left.  She had begun to despair, and\r\nfears crossed her mind that Geordie must have been run over and killed;\r\nwhen at last up he came running, almost breathless.  \"I've gotten the\r\nsiller for the bonnet, Nell!\" cried he.  \"Eh Geordie!\" she said, \"but hoo\r\nhae ye gotten it?\"  \"Haudin the gentlemen's horses!\" was the exultant\r\nreply.  The bonnet was forthwith bought, and the two returned to Dewley\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nGeorge's first regular employment was of a very humble sort.  A widow,\r\nnamed Grace Ainslie, then occupied the neighbouring farmhouse of Dewley.\r\nShe kept a number of cows, and had the privilege of grazing them along\r\nthe waggon-road.  She needed a boy to herd the cows, to keep them out of\r\nthe way of the waggons, and prevent their straying or trespassing on the\r\nneighbours' \"liberties;\" the boy's duty was also to bar the gates at\r\nnight after all the waggons had passed.  George petitioned for this post,\r\nand, to his great joy, he was appointed at the wage of twopence a day.\r\n\r\nIt was light employment, and he had plenty of spare time on his hands,\r\nwhich he spent in birdnesting, making whistles out of reeds and scrannel\r\nstraws, and erecting Lilliputian mills in the little water-streams that\r\nran into the Dewley bog.  But his favourite amusement at this early age\r\nwas erecting clay engines in conjunction with his chosen playmate, Bill\r\nThirlwall.  The place is still pointed out where the future engineers\r\nmade their first essays in modelling.  The boys found the clay for their\r\nengines in the adjoining bog, and the hemlocks which grew about supplied\r\nthem with imaginary steam-pipes.  They even proceeded to make a miniature\r\nwinding-machine in connexion with their engine, and the apparatus was\r\nerected upon a bench in front of the Thirlwalls' cottage.  The corves\r\nwere made out of hollowed corks; the ropes were supplied by twine; and a\r\nfew bits of wood gleaned from the refuse of the carpenter's shop\r\ncompleted their materials.  With this apparatus the boys made a show of\r\nsending the corves down the pit and drawing them up again, much to the\r\nmarvel of the pitmen.  But some mischievous person about the place seized\r\nthe opportunity early one morning of smashing the fragile machinery, much\r\nto the grief of the young engineers.\r\n\r\nAs Stephenson grew older and abler to work, he was set to lead the horses\r\nwhen ploughing, though scarce big enough to stride across the furrows;\r\nand he used afterwards to say that he rode to his work in the mornings at\r\nan hour when most other children of his age were asleep in their beds.\r\nHe was also employed to hoe turnips, and do similar farm-work, for which\r\nhe was paid the advanced wage of fourpence a day.  But his highest\r\nambition was to be taken on at the colliery where his father worked; and\r\nhe shortly joined his elder brother James there as a \"corf-bitter,\" or\r\n\"picker,\" to clear the coal of stones, bats, and dross.  His wages were\r\nthen advanced to sixpence a day, and afterwards to eightpence when he was\r\nset to drive the gin-horse.\r\n\r\nShortly after, George went to Black Callerton to drive the gin there; and\r\nas that colliery lies about two miles across the fields from Dewley Burn,\r\nhe walked that distance early in the morning to his work, returning home\r\nlate in the evening.  One of the old residents at Black Callerton, who\r\nremembered him at that time, described him to the author as \"a grit\r\ngrowing lad, with bare legs an' feet;\" adding that he was \"very\r\nquick-witted and full of fun and tricks: indeed, there was nothing under\r\nthe sun but he tried to imitate.\"  He was usually foremost also in the\r\nsports and pastimes of youth.\r\n\r\nAmong his first strongly-developed tastes was the love of birds and\r\nanimals, which he inherited from his father.  Blackbirds were his special\r\nfavourites.  The hedges between Dewley and Black Callerton were capital\r\nbird-nesting places; and there was not a nest there that he did not know\r\nof.  When the young birds were old enough, he would bring them home with\r\nhim, feed them, and teach them to fly about the cottage unconfined by\r\ncages.  One of his blackbirds became so tame, that, after flying about\r\nthe doors all day, and in and out of the cottage, it would take up its\r\nroost upon the bed-head at night.  And most singular of all, the bird\r\nwould disappear in the spring and summer months, when it was supposed to\r\ngo into the woods to pair and rear its young, after which it would\r\nreappear at the cottage, and resume its social habits during the winter.\r\nThis went on for several years.  George had also a stock of tame rabbits,\r\nfor which he built a little house behind the cottage, and for many years\r\nhe continued to pride himself upon the superiority of his breed.\r\n\r\nAfter he had driven the gin for some time at Dewley and Black Callerton,\r\nhe was taken on as an assistant to his father in firing the engine at\r\nDewley.  This was a step of promotion which he had anxiously desired, his\r\nonly fear being lest he should be found too young for the work.  Indeed,\r\nhe used afterwards to relate how he was wont to hide himself when the\r\nowner of the colliery went round, in case he should be thought too little\r\na boy to earn the wages paid him.  Since he had modelled his clay engines\r\nin the bog, his young ambition was to be an engineman; and to be an\r\nassistant fireman was the first step towards this position.  Great\r\ntherefore was his joy when, at about fourteen years of age, he was\r\nappointed assistant-fireman, at the wage of a shilling a day.\r\n\r\nBut the coal at Dewley Burn being at length worked out, the pit was\r\nordered to be \"laid in,\" and old Robert and his family were again under\r\nthe necessity of shifting their home; for, to use the common phrase, they\r\nmust \"follow the wark.\"  They removed accordingly to a place called\r\nJolly's Close, a few miles to the south, close behind the village of\r\nNewburn, where another coal-mine belonging to the Duke of Northumberland,\r\ncalled \"the Duke's Winnin,\" had recently been opened out.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Newburn on the Tyne]\r\n\r\nOne of the old persons in the neighbourhood, who knew the family well,\r\ndescribes the dwelling in which they lived as a poor cottage of only one\r\nroom, in which the father, mother, four sons, and two daughters, lived\r\nand slept.  It was crowded with three low-poled beds.  The one apartment\r\nserved for parlour, kitchen, sleeping-room, and all.\r\n\r\nThe children of the Stephenson family were now growing apace, and several\r\nof them were old enough to be able to earn money at various kinds of\r\ncolliery work.  James and George, the two eldest sons, worked as\r\nassistant-firemen; and the younger boys worked as wheelers or pickers on\r\nthe bank-tops.  The two girls helped their mother with the household\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOther workings of the coal were opened out in the neighbourhood; and to\r\none of these George was removed as fireman on his own account.  This was\r\ncalled the \"Mid Mill Winnin,\" where he had for his mate a young man named\r\nCoe.  They worked together there for about two years, by twelve-hour\r\nshifts, George firing the engine at the wage of a shilling a day.  He was\r\nnow fifteen years old.  His ambition was as yet limited to attaining the\r\nstanding of a full workman, at a man's wages; and with that view he\r\nendeavoured to attain such a knowledge of his engine as would eventually\r\nlead to his employment as an engineman, with its accompanying advantage\r\nof higher pay.  He was a steady, sober, hard-working young man, but\r\nnothing more in the estimation of his fellow-workmen.\r\n\r\nOne of his favourite pastimes in by-hours was trying feats of strength\r\nwith his companions.  Although in frame he was not particularly robust,\r\nyet he was big and bony, and considered very strong for his age.  At\r\nthrowing the hammer George had no compeer.  At lifting heavy weights off\r\nthe ground from between his feet, by means of a bar of iron passed\r\nthrough them--placing the bar against his knees as a fulcrum, and then\r\nstraightening his spine and lifting them sheer up--he was also very\r\nsuccessful.  On one occasion he lifted as much as sixty stones weight--a\r\nstriking indication of his strength of bone and muscle.\r\n\r\nWhen the pit at Mid Mill was closed, George and his companion Coe were\r\nsent to work another pumping-engine erected near Throckley Bridge, where\r\nthey continued for some months.  It was while working at this place that\r\nhis wages were raised to 12s. a week--an event to him of great\r\nimportance.  On coming out of the foreman's office that Saturday evening\r\non which he received the advance, he announced the fact to his\r\nfellow-workmen, adding triumphantly \"I am now a made man for life!\"\r\n\r\nThe pit opened at Newburn, at which old Robert Stephenson worked, proving\r\na failure, it was closed; and a new pit was sunk at Water-row, on a strip\r\nof land lying between the Wylam waggon-way and the river Tyne, about half\r\na mile west of Newburn Church.  A pumping engine was erected there by\r\nRobert Hawthorn, the Duke's engineer; and old Stephenson went to work it\r\nas fireman, his son George acting as the engineman or plugman.  At that\r\ntime he was about seventeen years old--a very youthful age at which to\r\nfill so responsible a post.  He had thus already got ahead of his father\r\nin his station as a workman; for the plugman holds a higher grade than\r\nthe fireman, requiring more practical knowledge and skill, and usually\r\nreceiving higher wages.\r\n\r\nGeorge's duty as plugman was to watch the engine, to see that it kept\r\nwell in work, and that the pumps were efficient in drawing the water.\r\nWhen the water-level in the pit was lowered, and the suction became\r\nincomplete through the exposure of the suction-holes, it was then his\r\nduty to proceed to the bottom of the shaft and plug the tube so that the\r\npump should draw: hence the designation of \"plugman.\"  If a stoppage in\r\nthe engine took place through any defect which he was incapable of\r\nremedying, it was for him to call in the aid of the chief engineer to set\r\nit to rights.\r\n\r\nBut from the time when George Stephenson was appointed fireman, and more\r\nparticularly afterwards as engineman, he applied himself so assiduously\r\nand so successfully to the study of the engine and its gearing--taking\r\nthe machine to pieces in his leisure hours for the purpose of cleaning\r\nand understanding its various parts--that he soon acquired a thorough\r\npractical knowledge of its construction and mode of working, and very\r\nrarely needed to call the engineer of the colliery to his aid.  His\r\nengine became a sort of pet with him, and he was never wearied of\r\nwatching and inspecting it with admiration.\r\n\r\nThough eighteen years old, like many of his fellow-workmen, Stephenson\r\nhad not yet learnt to read.  All that he could do was to get some one to\r\nread for him by his engine fire, out of any book or stray newspaper which\r\nfound its way into the neighbourhood.  Buonaparte was then overrunning\r\nItaly, and astounding Europe by his brilliant succession of victories;\r\nand there was no more eager auditor of his exploits, as read from the\r\nnewspaper accounts, than the young engineman at the Water-row Pit.\r\n\r\nThere were also numerous stray bits of information and intelligence\r\ncontained in these papers, which excited Stephenson's interest.  One of\r\nthese related to the Egyptian method of hatching birds' eggs by means of\r\nartificial heat.  Curious about everything relating to birds, he\r\ndetermined to test it by experiment.  It was spring time, and he\r\nforthwith went a birdnesting in the adjoining woods and hedges.  He\r\ngathered a collection of eggs of various sorts, set them in flour in a\r\nwarm place in the engine-house, covering the whole with wool, and then\r\nwaited the issue.  The heat was kept as steady as possible, and the eggs\r\nwere carefully turned every twelve hours, but though they chipped, and\r\nsome of them exhibited well-grown chicks, they never hatched.  The\r\nexperiment failed, but the incident shows that the inquiring mind of the\r\nyouth was fairly at work.\r\n\r\nModelling of engines in clay continued to be another of his favourite\r\noccupations.  He made models of engines which he had seen, and of others\r\nwhich were described to him.  These attempts were an improvement upon his\r\nfirst trials at Dewley Burn bog, when occupied there as a herd-boy.  He\r\nwas, however, anxious to know something of the wonderful engines of\r\nBoulton and Watt, and was told that they were to be found fully described\r\nin books, which he must search for information as to their construction,\r\naction and uses.  But, alas! Stephenson could not read; he had not yet\r\nlearnt even his letters.\r\n\r\nThus he shortly found, when gazing wistfully in the direction of\r\nknowledge, that to advance further as a skilled workman, he must master\r\nthis wonderful art of reading--the key to so many other arts.  Only thus\r\ncould he gain an access to books, the depositories of the wisdom and\r\nexperience of the past.  Although a grown man, and doing the work of a\r\nman, he was not ashamed to confess his ignorance, and go to school, big\r\nas he was, to learn his letters.  Perhaps, too, he foresaw that, in\r\nlaying out a little of his spare earnings for this purpose, he was\r\ninvesting money judiciously, and that, in every hour he spent at school,\r\nhe was really working for better wages.\r\n\r\nHis first schoolmaster was Robin Cowens, a poor teacher in the village of\r\nWalbottle.  He kept a night-school, which was attended by a few of the\r\ncolliers and labourers' sons in the neighbourhood.  George took lessons\r\nin spelling and reading three nights in the week.  Robin Cowen's teaching\r\ncost threepence a week; and though it was not very good, yet George,\r\nbeing hungry for knowledge and eager to acquire it, soon learnt to read.\r\nHe also practised \"pothooks,\" and at the age of nineteen he was proud to\r\nbe able to write his own name.\r\n\r\nA Scotch dominie, named Andrew Robertson, set up a night-school in the\r\nvillage of Newburn, in the winter of 1799.  It was more convenient for\r\nGeorge to attend this school, as it was nearer to his work, and only a\r\nfew minutes' walk from Jolly's Close.  Besides, Andrew had the reputation\r\nof being a skilled arithmetician; and this branch of knowledge Stephenson\r\nwas very desirous of acquiring.  He accordingly began taking lessons from\r\nhim, paying fourpence a week.  Robert Gray, the junior fireman at the\r\nWater-row Pit, began arithmetic at the same time; and Gray afterwards\r\ntold the author that George learnt \"figuring\" so much faster than he did,\r\nthat he could not make out how it was--\"he took to figures so wonderful.\"\r\nAlthough the two started together from the same point, at the end of the\r\nwinter George had mastered \"reduction,\" while Robert Gray was still\r\nstruggling with the difficulties of simple division.  But George's secret\r\nwas his perseverance.  He worked out the sums in his bye-hours, improving\r\nevery minute of his spare time by the engine-fire, and studying there the\r\narithmetical problems set for him upon his slate by the master.  In the\r\nevenings he took to Robertson the sums which he had \"worked,\" and new\r\nones were \"set\" for him to study out the following day.  Thus his\r\nprogress was rapid, and, with a willing heart and mind, he soon became\r\nwell advanced in arithmetic.  Indeed, Andrew Robertson became very proud\r\nof his scholar; and shortly after, when the Water-row Pit was closed, and\r\nGeorge removed to Black Callerton to work there, the poor schoolmaster,\r\nnot having a very extensive connexion in Newburn, went with his pupils,\r\nand set up his night-school at Black Callerton, where he continued his\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nGeorge still found time to attend to his favourite animals while working\r\nat the Water-row Pit.  Like his father, he used to tempt the\r\nrobin-redbreasts to hop and fly about him at the engine-fire, by the bait\r\nof bread-crumbs saved from his dinner.  But his chief favourite was his\r\ndog--so sagacious that he almost daily carried George's dinner to him at\r\nthe pit.  The tin containing the meal was suspended from the dog's neck,\r\nand, thus laden, he proceeded faithfully from Jolly's Close to Water-row\r\nPit, quite through the village of Newburn.  He turned neither to left nor\r\nright, nor heeded the barking of curs at his heels.  But his course was\r\nnot unattended with perils.  One day the big strange dog of a passing\r\nbutcher espying the engineman's messenger with the tin can about his\r\nneck, ran after and fell upon him.  There was a terrible tussle and\r\nworrying, which lasted for a brief while, and, shortly after, the dog's\r\nmaster, anxious for his dinner, saw his faithful servant approaching,\r\nbleeding but triumphant.  The tin can was still round his neck, but the\r\ndinner had been spilt in the struggle.  Though George went without his\r\ndinner that day, he was prouder of his dog than ever when the\r\ncircumstances of the combat were related to him by the villagers who had\r\nseen it.\r\n\r\nIt was while working at the Water-row Pit that Stephenson learnt the art\r\nof brakeing an engine.  This being one of the higher departments of\r\ncolliery labour, and among the best paid, George was very anxious to\r\nlearn it.  A small winding-engine having been put up for the purpose of\r\ndrawing the coals from the pit, Bill Coe, his friend and fellow-workman,\r\nwas appointed the brakesman.  He frequently allowed George to try his\r\nhand at the machine, and instructed him how to proceed.  Coe was,\r\nhowever, opposed in this by several of the other workmen--one of whom, a\r\nbanksman named William Locke, {26} went so far as to stop the working of\r\nthe pit because Stephenson had been called in to the brake.  But one day\r\nas Mr. Charles Nixon, the manager of the pit, was observed approaching,\r\nCoe adopted an expedient which put a stop to the opposition.  He called\r\nupon Stephenson to \"come into the brake-house, and take hold of the\r\nmachine.\"  Locke, as usual, sat down, and the working of the pit was\r\nstopped.  When requested by the manager to give an explanation, he said\r\nthat \"young Stephenson couldn't brake, and, what was more, never would\r\nlearn, he was so clumsy.\"  Mr. Nixon, however, ordered Locke to go on\r\nwith the work, which he did; and Stephenson, after some further practice,\r\nacquired the art of brakeing.\r\n\r\nAfter working at the Water-row Pit and at other engines near Newburn for\r\nabout three years, George and Coe went to Black Callerton early in 1801.\r\nThough only twenty years of age, his employers thought so well of him\r\nthat they appointed him to the responsible office of brakesman at the\r\nDolly Pit.  For convenience' sake, he took lodgings at a small farmer's\r\nin the village, finding his own victuals, and paying so much a week for\r\nlodging and attendance.  In the locality this was called \"picklin in his\r\nawn poke neuk.\"  It not unfrequently happens that the young workman about\r\nthe collieries, when selecting a lodging, contrives to pitch his tent\r\nwhere the daughter of the house ultimately becomes his wife.  This is\r\noften the real attraction that draws the youth from home, though a very\r\ndifferent one may be pretended.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson's duties as brakesman may be briefly described.  The\r\nwork was somewhat monotonous, and consisted in superintending the working\r\nof the engine and machinery by means of which the coals were drawn out of\r\nthe pit.  Brakesman are almost invariably selected from those who have\r\nhad considerable experience as engine-firemen, and borne a good character\r\nfor steadiness, punctuality, watchfulness, and \"mother wit.\"  In George\r\nStephenson's day the coals were drawn out of the pit in corves, or large\r\nbaskets made of hazel rods.  The corves were placed together in a cage,\r\nbetween which and the pit-ropes there was usually from fifteen to twenty\r\nfeet of chain.  The approach of the corves towards the pit mouth was\r\nsignalled by a bell, brought into action by a piece of mechanism worked\r\nfrom the shaft of the engine.  When the bell sounded, the brakesman\r\nchecked the speed, by taking hold of the hand-gear connected with the\r\nsteam-valves, which were so arranged that by their means he could\r\nregulate the speed of the engine, and stop or set it in motion when\r\nrequired.  Connected with the fly-wheel was a powerful wooden brake,\r\nacting by pressure against its rim, something like the brake of a\r\nrailway-carriage against its wheels.  On catching sight of the chain\r\nattached to the ascending corve-cage, the brakesman, by pressing his foot\r\nupon a foot-step near him, was enabled, with great precision, to stop the\r\nrevolutions of the wheel, and arrest the ascent of the corves at the pit\r\nmouth, when they were forthwith landed on the \"settle board.\"  On the\r\nfull corves being replaced by empty ones, it was then the duty of the\r\nbrakesman to reverse the engine, and send the corves down the pit to be\r\nfilled again.\r\n\r\nThe monotony of George Stephenson's occupation as a brakesman was\r\nsomewhat varied by the change which he made, in his turn, from the day to\r\nthe night shift.  His duty, on the latter occasions, consisted chiefly in\r\nsending men and materials into the mine, and in drawing other men and\r\nmaterials out.  Most of the workmen enter the pit during the night shift,\r\nand leave it in the latter part of the day, whilst coal-drawing is\r\nproceeding.  The requirements of the work at night are such, that the\r\nbrakesman has a good deal of spare time on his hands, which he is at\r\nliberty to employ in his own way.  From an early period, George was\r\naccustomed to employ those vacant night hours in working the sums set for\r\nhim by Andrew Robertson upon his slate, practising writing in his\r\ncopy-book, and mending the shoes of his fellow-workmen.  His wages while\r\nworking at the Dolly Pit amounted to from 1 pounds 15s. to 2 pounds in\r\nthe fortnight; but he gradually added to them as he became more expert at\r\nshoe-mending, and afterwards at shoe-making.\r\n\r\nProbably he was stimulated to take in hand this extra work by the\r\nattachment he had by this time formed for a young woman named Fanny\r\nHenderson, who officiated as servant in the small farmer's house in which\r\nhe lodged.  We have been informed that the personal attractions of Fanny,\r\nthough these were considerable, were the least of her charms.  Mr.\r\nWilliam Fairbairn, who afterwards saw her in her home at Willington Quay,\r\ndescribes her as a very comely woman.  But her temper was one of the\r\nsweetest; and those who knew her were accustomed to speak of the charming\r\nmodesty of her demeanour, her kindness of disposition, and withal her\r\nsound good sense.\r\n\r\nAmongst his various mendings of old shoes at Callerton.  George was on\r\none occasion favoured with the shoes of his sweetheart to sole.  One can\r\nimagine the pleasure with which he would linger over such a piece of\r\nwork, and the pride with which he would execute it.  A friend of his,\r\nstill living, relates that, after he had finished the shoes, he carried\r\nthem about with him in his pocket on the Sunday afternoon, and that from\r\ntime to time he would pull them out and hold them up, exclaiming, \"what a\r\ncapital job he had made of them!\"\r\n\r\nOut of his earnings by shoe-mending at Callerton, George contrived to\r\nsave his first guinea.  The first guinea saved by a working man is no\r\ntrivial thing.  If, as in Stephenson's case, it has been the result of\r\nprudent self-denial, of extra labour at bye-hours, and of the honest\r\nresolution to save and economise for worthy purposes, the first guinea\r\nsaved is an earnest of better things.  When Stephenson had saved this\r\nguinea he was not a little elated at the achievement, and expressed the\r\nopinion to a friend, who many years after reminded him of it, that he was\r\n\"now a rich man.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after he began to work at Black Callerton as brakesman, he had a\r\nquarrel with a pitman named Ned Nelson, a roistering bully, who was the\r\nterror of the village.  Nelson was a great fighter; and it was therefore\r\nconsidered dangerous to quarrel with him.  Stephenson was so unfortunate\r\nas not to be able to please this pitman by the way in which he drew him\r\nout of the pit; and Nelson swore at him grossly because of the alleged\r\nclumsiness of his brakeing.  George defended himself, and appealed to the\r\ntestimony of the other workmen.  But Nelson had not been accustomed to\r\nGeorge's style of self-assertion; and, after a great deal of abuse, he\r\nthreatened to kick the brakesman, who defied him to do so.  Nelson ended\r\nby challenging Stephenson to a pitched battle; and the latter accepted\r\nthe challenge, when a day was fixed on which the fight was to come off.\r\n\r\nGreat was the excitement at Black Callerton when it was known that George\r\nStephenson had accepted Nelson's challenge.  Everybody said he would be\r\nkilled.  The villagers, the young men, and especially the boys of the\r\nplace, with whom George was a great favourite, all wished that he might\r\nbeat Nelson, but they scarcely dared to say so.  They came about him\r\nwhile he was at work in the engine-house to inquire if it was really true\r\nthat he was \"goin to fight Nelson?\"  \"Ay; never fear for me; I'll fight\r\nhim.\"  And fight him he did.  For some days previous to the appointed day\r\nof battle, Nelson went entirely off work for the purpose of keeping\r\nhimself fresh and strong, whereas Stephenson went on doing his daily work\r\nas usual, and appeared not in the least disconcerted by the prospect of\r\nthe affair.  So, on the evening appointed, after George had done his\r\nday's labour, he went into the Dolly Pit Field, where his already\r\nexulting rival was ready to meet him.  George stripped, and \"went in\"\r\nlike a practised pugilist--though it was his first and last fight.  After\r\na few rounds, George's wiry muscles and practised strength enabled him\r\nseverely to punish his adversary, and to secure an easy victory.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance is related in illustration of Stephenson's personal\r\npluck and courage; and it was thoroughly characteristic of the man.  He\r\nwas no pugilist, and the very reverse of quarrelsome.  But he would not\r\nbe put down by the bully of the colliery, and he fought him.  There his\r\npugilism ended; they afterwards shook hands, and continued good friends.\r\nIn after life, Stephenson's mettle was often as hardly tried, though in a\r\ndifferent way; and he did not fail to exhibit the same resolute courage\r\nin contending with the bullies of the railway world, as he showed in his\r\nencounter with Ned Nelson, the fighting pitman of Callerton.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Colliery Whimsey]\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Stephenson's Cottage at Wallington Quay]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nENGINEMAN AT WILLINGTON QUAY AND KILLINGWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson had now acquired the character of an expert workman.\r\nHe was diligent and observant while at work, and sober and studious when\r\nthe day's work was over.  His friend Coe described him to the author as\r\n\"a standing example of manly character.\"  On pay-Saturday afternoons,\r\nwhen the pitmen held their fortnightly holiday, occupying themselves\r\nchiefly in cock-fighting and dog-fighting in the adjoining fields,\r\nfollowed by adjournments to the \"yel-house,\" George was accustomed to\r\ntake his engine to pieces, for the purpose of obtaining \"insight,\" and he\r\ncleaned all the parts and put the machine in thorough working order\r\nbefore leaving it.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings he improved himself in the arts of reading and writing,\r\nand occasionally took a turn at modelling.  It was at Callerton, his son\r\nRobert informed us, that he began to try his hand at original invention;\r\nand for some time he applied his attention to a machine of the nature of\r\nan engine-brake, which reversed itself by its own action.  But nothing\r\ncame of the contrivance, and it was eventually thrown aside as useless.\r\nYet not altogether so; for even the highest skill must undergo the\r\ninevitable discipline of experiment, and submit to the wholesome\r\ncorrection of occasional failure.\r\n\r\nAfter working at Callerton for about two years, he received an offer to\r\ntake charge of the engine on Willington Ballast Hill at an advanced wage.\r\nHe determined to accept it, and at the same time to marry Fanny\r\nHenderson, and begin housekeeping on his own account.  Though he was only\r\ntwenty-one years old, he had contrived, by thrift, steadiness, and\r\nindustry, to save as much money as enabled him to take a cottage-dwelling\r\nat Willington Quay, and furnish it in a humble but comfortable style for\r\nthe reception of his bride.\r\n\r\nWillington Quay lies on the north bank of the Tyne, about six miles below\r\nNewcastle.  It consists of a line of houses straggling along the\r\nriver-side; and high behind it towers up the huge mound of ballast\r\nemptied out of the ships which resort to the quay for their cargoes of\r\ncoal for the London market.  The ballast is thrown out of the ships'\r\nholds into waggons laid alongside, which are run up to the summit of the\r\nBallast Hill, and emptied out there.  At the foot of the great mound of\r\nshot rubbish was the fixed engine of which George Stephenson acted as\r\nbrakesman.\r\n\r\nThe cottage in which he took up his abode was a small two-storied\r\ndwelling, standing a little back from the quay with a bit of garden\r\nground in front. {33}  The Stephenson family occupied the upper room in\r\nthe west end of the cottage.  Close behind rose the Ballast Hill.\r\n\r\nWhen the cottage dwelling had been made snug, and was ready for\r\noccupation, the marriage took place.  It was celebrated in Newburn\r\nChurch, on the 28th of November, 1802.  After the ceremony, George, with\r\nhis newly-wedded wife, proceeded to the house of his father at Jolly's\r\nClose.  The old man was now becoming infirm, and, though he still worked\r\nas an engine-fireman, contrived with difficulty \"to keep his head above\r\nwater.\"  When the visit had been paid, the bridal party set out for their\r\nnew home at Willington Quay, whither they went in a manner quite common\r\nbefore travelling by railway came into use.  Two farm horses, borrowed\r\nfrom a neighbouring farmer, were each provided with a saddle and pillion,\r\nand George having mounted one, his wife seated herself behind him,\r\nholding on by his waist.  The bridesman and bridesmaid in like manner\r\nmounted the other horse; and in this wise the wedding party rode across\r\nthe country, passing through the old streets of Newcastle, and then by\r\nWallsend to Willington Quay--a ride of about fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson's daily life at Willington was that of a steady\r\nworkman.  By the manner, however, in which he continued to improve his\r\nspare hours in the evening, he was silently and surely paving the way for\r\nbeing something more than a manual labourer.  He set himself to study\r\ndiligently the principles of mechanics, and to master the laws by which\r\nhis engine worked.  For a workman, he was even at that time more than\r\nordinarily speculative--often taking up strange theories, and trying to\r\nsift out the truth that was in them.  While sitting by his wife's side in\r\nhis cottage-dwelling in the winter evenings, he was usually occupied in\r\nstudying mechanical subjects, or in modelling experimental machines.\r\nAmongst his various speculations while at Willington, he tried to\r\ndiscover a means of Perpetual Motion.  Although he failed, as so many\r\nothers had done before him, the very efforts he made tended to whet his\r\ninventive faculties, and to call forth his dormant powers.  He went so\r\nfar as to construct the model of a machine for the purpose.  It consisted\r\nof a wooden wheel, the periphery of which was furnished with glass tubes\r\nfilled with quicksilver; as the wheel rotated, the quicksilver poured\r\nitself down into the lower tubes, and thus a sort of self-acting motion\r\nwas kept up in the apparatus, which, however, did not prove to be\r\nperpetual.  Where he had first obtained the idea of this machine--whether\r\nfrom conversation or reading, is not known; but his son Robert was of\r\nopinion that he had heard of the apparatus of this kind described in the\r\n\"History of Inventions.\"  As he had then no access to books, and indeed\r\ncould barely read with ease, it is probable that he had been told of the\r\ncontrivance, and set about testing its value according to his own\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nMuch of his spare time continued to be occupied by labour more\r\nimmediately profitable, regarded in a pecuniary point of view.  In the\r\nevenings, after his day's labour at his engine, he would occasionally\r\nemploy himself for an hour or two in casting ballast out of the collier\r\nships, by which means he was enabled to earn a few extra shillings\r\nweekly.  Mr. William Fairbairn of Manchester has informed us that while\r\nStephenson was employed at Willington, he himself was working in the\r\nneighbourhood as an engine apprentice at the Percy Main Colliery.  He was\r\nvery fond of George, who was a fine, hearty fellow, besides being a\r\ncapital workman.  In the summer evenings young Fairbairn was accustomed\r\nto go down to the Quay to see his friend, and on such occasions he would\r\nfrequently take charge of George's engine while he took a turn at heaving\r\nballast out of the ships' holds.  It is pleasant to think of the future\r\nPresident of the British Association thus helping the future Railway\r\nEngineer to earn a few extra shillings by overwork in the evenings, at a\r\ntime when both occupied the rank of humble working men in an obscure\r\nnorthern village.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairbairn was also a frequent visitor at George's cottage on the\r\nQuay, where, though there was no luxury, there was comfort, cleanliness,\r\nand a pervading spirit of industry.  Even at home George was never for a\r\nmoment idle.  When there was no ballast to heave out at the Quay he took\r\nin shoes to mend; and from mending he proceeded to making them, as well\r\nas shoe-lasts, in which he was admitted to be very expert.\r\n\r\nBut an accident occurred in Stephenson's household about this time, which\r\nhad the effect of directing his industry into a new and still more\r\nprofitable channel.  The cottage chimney took fire one day in his\r\nabsence, when the alarmed neighbours, rushing in, threw quantities of\r\nwater upon the flames; and some, in their zeal, even mounted the ridge of\r\nthe house, and poured buckets of water down the chimney.  The fire was\r\nsoon put out, but the house was thoroughly soaked.  When George came home\r\nhe found everything in disorder, and his new furniture covered with soot.\r\nThe eight-day clock, which hung against the wall--one of the most\r\nhighly-prized articles in the house--was much damaged by the steam with\r\nwhich the room had been filled; and its wheels were so clogged by the\r\ndust and soot that it was brought to a complete standstill.  George was\r\nalways ready to turn his hand to anything, and his ingenuity, never at\r\nfault, immediately set to work to repair the unfortunate clock.  He was\r\nadvised to send it to the clockmaker, but that would cost money; and he\r\ndeclared that he would repair it himself--at least he would try.  The\r\nclock was accordingly taken to pieces and cleaned; the tools which he had\r\nbeen accumulating for the purpose of constructing his Perpetual Motion\r\nmachine, enabled him to do this readily; and he succeeded so well that,\r\nshortly after, the neighbours sent him their clocks to clean, and he soon\r\nbecame one of the most famous clock-doctors in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIt was while living at Willington Quay that George Stephenson's only son\r\nwas born, on the 16th of October, 1803.  The child was a great favourite\r\nwith his father, and added much to the happiness of his evening hours.\r\nGeorge's \"philoprogenitiveness,\" as phrenologists call it, had been\r\nexercised hitherto upon birds, dogs, rabbits, and even the poor old\r\ngin-horses which he had driven at the Callerton Pit; but in his boy he\r\nnow found a much more genial object for the exercise of his affection.\r\n\r\nThe christening took place in the school-house at Wallsend, the old\r\nparish church being at the time in so dilapidated a condition from the\r\n\"creeping\" or subsidence of the ground, consequent upon the excavation of\r\nthe coal, that it was considered dangerous to enter it.  On this\r\noccasion, Robert Gray and Anne Henderson, who had officiated as bridesman\r\nand bridesmaid at the wedding, came over again to Willington, and stood\r\ngodfather and godmother to little Robert,--so named after his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nAfter working for several years more as a brakesman at the Willington\r\nmachine, George Stephenson was induced to leave his situation there for a\r\nsimilar one at the West Moor Colliery, Killingworth.  It was not without\r\nconsiderable persuasion that he was induced to leave the Quay, as he knew\r\nthat he should thereby give up the chance of earning extra money by\r\ncasting ballast from the keels.  At last, however, he consented, in the\r\nhope of making up the loss in some other way.\r\n\r\nThe village of Killingworth lies about seven miles north of Newcastle,\r\nand is one of the best-known collieries in that neighbourhood.  The\r\nworkings of the coal are of vast extent, and give employment to a large\r\nnumber of work-people.  To this place Stephenson first came as a\r\nbrakesman about the beginning of 1805.  He had not been long in his new\r\nplace, ere his wife died (in 1806), shortly after giving birth to a\r\ndaughter, who survived the mother only a few months.  George deeply felt\r\nthe loss of his wife, for they had been very happy together.  Their lot\r\nhad been sweetened by daily successful toil.  The husband was sober and\r\nhard-working, and his wife made his hearth so bright and his home so\r\nsnug, that no attraction could draw him from her side in the evening\r\nhours.  But this domestic happiness was all to pass away; and George felt\r\nas one that had thenceforth to tread the journey of life alone.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: West Moor Colliery]\r\n\r\nShortly after this event, while his grief was still fresh, he received an\r\ninvitation from some gentlemen concerned in large spinning works near\r\nMontrose in Scotland, to proceed thither and superintend the working of\r\none of Boulton and Watt's engines.  He accepted the offer, and made\r\narrangements to leave Killingworth for a time.\r\n\r\nHaving left his little boy in good keeping, he set out upon his long\r\njourney to Scotland on foot, with his kit upon his back.  While working\r\nat Montrose he gave a striking proof of that practical ability in\r\ncontrivance for which he was afterwards so distinguished.  It appears\r\nthat the water required for the purposes of his engine, as well as for\r\nthe use of the works, was pumped from a considerable depth, being\r\nsupplied from the adjacent extensive sand strata.  The pumps frequently\r\ngot choked by the sand drawn in at the bottom of the well through the\r\nsnore-holes, or apertures through which the water to be raised is\r\nadmitted.  The barrels soon became worn, and the bucket and clack\r\nleathers destroyed, so that it became necessary to devise a remedy; and\r\nwith this object the engineman proceeded to adopt the following simple\r\nbut original expedient.  He had a wooden box or boot made, twelve feet\r\nhigh, which he placed in the sump or well, and into this he inserted the\r\nlower end of the pump.  The result was, that the water flowed clear from\r\nthe outer part of the well over into the boot, and being drawn up without\r\nany admixture of sand, the difficulty was thus conquered. {38}\r\n\r\nBeing paid good wages, Stephenson contrived, during the year he worked at\r\nMontrose, to save a sum of 28 pounds, which he took back with him to\r\nKillingworth.  Longing to get back to his kindred, his heart yearning for\r\nthe son whom he had left behind, our engineman took leave of his\r\nemployers, and trudged back to Northumberland on foot as he had gone.\r\nWhile on his journey southward he arrived late one evening, footsore and\r\nwearied, at the door of a small farmer's cottage, at which he knocked,\r\nand requested shelter for the night.  It was refused, and then he\r\nentreated that, being tired, and unable to proceed further, the farmer\r\nwould permit him to lie down in the outhouse, for that a little clean\r\nstraw would serve him.  The farmer's wife appeared at the door, looked at\r\nthe traveller, then retiring with her husband, the two confabulated a\r\nlittle apart, and finally they invited Stephenson into the cottage.\r\nAlways full of conversation and anecdote, he soon made himself at home in\r\nthe farmer's family, and spent with them a few pleasant hours.  He was\r\nhospitably entertained for the night, and when he left the cottage in the\r\nmorning, he pressed them to make some charge for his lodging, but they\r\nrefused to accept any recompense.  They only asked him to remember them\r\nkindly, and if he ever came that way, to be sure and call again.  Many\r\nyears after, when Stephenson had become a thriving man, he did not forget\r\nthe humble pair who had succoured and entertained him on his way; he\r\nsought their cottage again, when age had silvered their hair; and when he\r\nleft the aged couple, they may have been reminded of the old saying that\r\nwe may sometimes \"entertain angels unawares.\"\r\n\r\nReaching home, Stephenson found that his father had met with a serious\r\naccident at the Blucher Pit, which had reduced him to great distress and\r\npoverty.  While engaged in the inside of an engine, making some repairs,\r\na fellow-workman accidentally let in the steam upon him.  The blast\r\nstruck him full in the face; he was terribly scorched, and his eyesight\r\nwas irretrievably lost.  The helpless and infirm man had struggled for a\r\ntime with poverty; his sons who were at home, poor as himself, were\r\nlittle able to help him, while George was at a distance in Scotland.  On\r\nhis return, however, with his savings in his pocket, his first step was\r\nto pay off his father's debts, amounting to about 15 pounds; and shortly\r\nafter he removed the aged pair from Jolly's Close to a comfortable\r\ncottage adjoining the tramroad near the West Moor at Killingworth, where\r\nthe old man lived for many years, supported entirely by his son.\r\n\r\nStephenson was again taken on as a brakesman at the West Moor Pit.  He\r\ndoes not seem to have been very hopeful as to his prospects in life about\r\nthis time (1807-8).  Indeed the condition of the working class generally\r\nwas very discouraging.  England was engaged in a great war, which pressed\r\nupon the industry, and severely tried the resources, of the country.\r\nThere was a constant demand for men to fill the army.  The working people\r\nwere also liable to be pressed for the navy, or drawn for the militia;\r\nand though they could not fail to be discontented under such\r\ncircumstances, they scarcely dared even to mutter their discontent to\r\ntheir neighbours.\r\n\r\nStephenson was drawn for the militia: he must therefore either quit his\r\nwork and go a-soldiering, or find a substitute.  He adopted the latter\r\ncourse, and borrowed 6 pounds, which, with the remainder of his savings,\r\nenabled him to provide a militiaman to serve in his stead.  Thus the\r\nwhole of his hard-won earnings were swept away at a stroke.  He was\r\nalmost in despair, and contemplated the idea of leaving the country, and\r\nemigrating to the United States.  Although a voyage thither was then a\r\nmuch more formidable thing for a working man to accomplish than a voyage\r\nto Australia is now, he seriously entertained the project, and had all\r\nbut made up his mind to go.  His sister Ann, with her husband, emigrated\r\nabout that time, but George could not raise the requisite money, and they\r\ndeparted without him.  After all, it went sore against his heart to leave\r\nhis home and his kindred, the scenes of his youth and the friends of his\r\nboyhood; and he struggled long with the idea, brooding over it in sorrow.\r\nSpeaking afterwards to a friend of his thoughts at the time, he said:\r\n\"You know the road from my house at the West Moor to Killingworth.  I\r\nremember once when I went along that road I wept bitterly, for I knew not\r\nwhere my lot in life would be cast.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1808, Stephenson, with two other brakesmen, took a small contract\r\nunder the colliery lessees for brakeing the engines at the West Moor Pit.\r\nThe brakesmen found the oil and tallow; they divided the work amongst\r\nthem, and were paid so much per score for their labour.  It was the\r\ninterest of the brakesmen to economise the working as much as possible,\r\nand George no sooner entered upon the contract than he proceeded to\r\ndevise ways and means of making it \"pay.\"  He observed that the ropes\r\nwhich, at other pits in the neighbourhood, lasted about three months, at\r\nthe West Moor Pit became worn out in about a month.  He immediately set\r\nabout ascertaining the cause of the defect; and finding it to be\r\noccasioned by excessive friction, he proceeded, with the sanction of the\r\nhead engine-wright and the colliery owners, to shift the pulley-wheels\r\nand re-arrange the gearing, which had the effect of greatly diminishing\r\nthe tear and wear, besides allowing the work of the colliery to proceed\r\nwithout interruption.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he attempted an improvement in the winding-engine\r\nwhich he worked, by placing a valve between the air-pump and condenser.\r\nThis expedient, although it led to no practical result, showed that his\r\nmind was actively engaged in studying new mechanical adaptations.  It\r\ncontinued to be his regular habit, on Saturdays, to take his engine to\r\npieces, for the purpose, at the same time, of familiarising himself with\r\nits action, and of placing it in a state of thorough working order.  By\r\nmastering its details, he was enabled, as opportunity occurred, to turn\r\nto practical account the knowledge he thus diligently and patiently\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nSuch an opportunity was not long in presenting itself.  In the year 1810,\r\na new pit was sunk by the \"Grand Allies\" (the lessees of the mines) at\r\nthe village of Killingworth, now known as the Killingworth High Pit.  An\r\natmospheric or Newcomen engine, made by Smeaton, was fixed there for the\r\npurpose of pumping out the water from the shaft; but somehow it failed to\r\nclear the pit.  As one of the workmen has since described the\r\ncircumstance--\"She couldn't keep her jack-head in water: all the\r\nenginemen in the neighbourhood were tried, as well as Crowther of the\r\nOuseburn, but they were clean bet.\"  The engine had been fruitlessly\r\npumping for nearly twelve months, and began to be spoken of as a total\r\nfailure.  Stephenson had gone to look at it when in course of erection,\r\nand then observed to the over-man that he thought it was defective; he\r\nalso gave it as his opinion that, if there were much water in the mine,\r\nthe engine would never keep it under.  Of course, as he was only a\r\nbrakesman, his opinion was considered to be worth very little on such a\r\npoint.  He continued, however, to make frequent visits to the engine, to\r\nsee \"how she was getting on.\"  From the bank-head where he worked his\r\nbrake he could see the chimney smoking at the High Pit; and as the men\r\nwere passing to and from their work, he would call out and inquire \"if\r\nthey had gotten to the bottom yet?\"  And the reply was always to the same\r\neffect--the pumping made no progress, and the workmen were still \"drowned\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nOne Saturday afternoon he went over to the High Pit to examine the engine\r\nmore carefully than he had yet done.  He had been turning the subject\r\nover thoughtfully in his mind; and seemed to have satisfied himself as to\r\nthe cause of the failure.  Kit Heppel, one of the sinkers, asked him,\r\n\"Weel, George, what do you mak' o' her?  Do you think you could do\r\nanything to improve her?\"  Said George, \"I could alter her, man, and make\r\nher draw: in a week's time I could send you to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nForthwith Heppel reported this conversation to Ralph Dodds, the head\r\nviewer, who, being now quite in despair, and hopeless of succeeding with\r\nthe engine, determined to give George's skill a trial.  At the worst he\r\ncould only fail, as the rest had done.  In the evening, Dodds went in\r\nsearch of Stephenson, and met him on the road, dressed in his Sunday's\r\nsuit, on the way to \"the preaching\" in the Methodist Chapel, which he\r\nattended.  \"Well, George,\" said Dodds, \"they tell me that you think you\r\ncan put the engine at the High Pit to rights.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said George.\r\n\"I think I could.\"  \"If that's the case, I'll give you a fair trial, and\r\nyou must set to work immediately.  We are clean drowned out, and cannot\r\nget a stop further.  The engineers hereabouts are all bet; and if you\r\nreally succeed in accomplishing what they cannot do, you may depend upon\r\nit I will make you a man for life.\"\r\n\r\nStephenson began his operations early next morning.  The only condition\r\nthat he made, before setting to work, was that he should select his own\r\nworkmen.  There was, as he knew, a good deal of jealousy amongst the\r\n\"regular\" men that a colliery brakesman should pretend to know more about\r\ntheir engine than they themselves did, and attempt to remedy defects\r\nwhich the most skilled men of their craft, including the engineer of the\r\ncolliery, had failed to do.  But George made the condition a _sine qua\r\nnon_.  \"The workmen,\" said he, \"must either be all Whigs or all Tories.\"\r\nThere was no help for it, so Dodds ordered the old hands to stand aside.\r\nThe men grumbled, but gave way; and then George and his party went in.\r\n\r\nThe engine was taken entirely to pieces.  The cistern containing the\r\ninjection water was raised ten feet; the injection cock, being too small,\r\nwas enlarged to nearly double its former size, and it was so arranged\r\nthat it should be shut off quickly at the beginning of the stroke.  These\r\nand other alterations were necessarily performed in a rough way, but, as\r\nthe result proved, on true principles.  Stephenson also, finding that the\r\nboiler would bear a greater pressure than five pounds to the inch,\r\ndetermined to work it at a pressure of ten pounds, though this was\r\ncontrary to the directions of both Newcomen and Smeaton.  The necessary\r\nalterations were made in about three days, and many persons came to see\r\nthe engine start, including the men who had put her up.  The pit being\r\nnearly full of water, she had little to do on starting, and, to use\r\nGeorge's words, \"came bounce into the house.\"  Dodds exclaimed, \"Why, she\r\nwas better as she was; now, she will knock the house down.\"  After a\r\nshort time, however, the engine got fairly to work, and by ten o'clock\r\nthat night the water was lower in the pit than it had ever been before.\r\nIt was kept pumping all Thursday, and by the Friday afternoon the pit was\r\ncleared of water, and the workmen were \"sent to the bottom,\" as\r\nStephenson had promised.  Thus the alterations effected in the pumping\r\napparatus proved completely successful.\r\n\r\nDodds was particularly gratified with the manner in which the job had\r\nbeen done, and he made Stephenson a present of ten pounds, which, though\r\nvery inadequate when compared with the value of the work performed, was\r\naccepted with gratitude.  George was proud of the gift as the first\r\nmarked recognition of his skill as a workman; and he used afterwards to\r\nsay that it was the biggest sum of money he had up to that time earned in\r\none lump.  Ralph Dodds, however, did more than this.  He released the\r\nbrakesman from the handles of his engine at West Moot, and appointed him\r\nengineman at the High Pit, at good wages, during the time the pit was\r\nsinking,--the job lasting for about a year; and he also kept him in mind\r\nfor further advancement.\r\n\r\nStephenson's skill as an engine-doctor soon became noised abroad, and he\r\nwas called upon to prescribe remedies for all the old, wheezy, and\r\nineffective pumping-machines in the neighbourhood.  In this capacity he\r\nsoon left the \"regular\" men far behind, though they in their turn were\r\nvery mach disposed to treat the Killingworth brakesman as no better than\r\na quack.  Nevertheless, his practice was really founded upon a close\r\nstudy of the principles of mechanics, and on an intimate practical\r\nacquaintance with the details of the pumping-engine.\r\n\r\nAnother of his smaller achievements in the same line is still told by the\r\npeople of the district.  At the corner of the road leading to Long\r\nBenton, there was a quarry from which a peculiar and scarce kind of ochre\r\nwas taken.  In the course of working it out, the water had collected in\r\nconsiderable quantities; and there being no means of draining it off, it\r\naccumulated to such an extent that the further working of the ochre was\r\nalmost entirely stopped.  Ordinary pumps were tried, and failed; and then\r\na windmill was tried, and failed too.  On this, George was asked what\r\nought to be done to clear the quarry of the water.  He said, \"he would\r\nset up for them an engine little bigger than a kail-pot, that would clear\r\nthem out in a week.\"  And he did so.  A little engine was speedily\r\nerected, by means of which the quarry was pumped dry in the course of a\r\nfew days.  Thus his skill as a pump-doctor soon became the marvel of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nIn elastic muscular vigour, Stephenson was now in his prime, and he still\r\ncontinued to be zealous in measuring his strength and agility with his\r\nfellow workmen.  The competitive element in his nature was always strong;\r\nand his success in these feats of rivalry was certainly remarkable.  Few,\r\nif any, could lift such weights, throw the hammer and putt the stone so\r\nfar, or cover so great a space at a standing or running leap.  One day,\r\nbetween the engine hour and the rope-rolling hour, Kit Heppel challenged\r\nhim to leap from one high wall to another, with a deep gap between.  To\r\nHeppel's surprise and dismay, George took the standing leap, and cleared\r\nthe eleven feet at a bound.  Had his eye been less accurate, or his limbs\r\nless agile and sure, the feat must have cost him his life.\r\n\r\nBut so full of redundant muscular vigour was he, that leaping, putting,\r\nor throwing the hammer were not enough for him.  He was also ambitious of\r\nriding on horseback, and, as he had not yet been promoted to an office\r\nenabling him to keep a horse of his own, he sometimes borrowed one of the\r\ngin-horses for a ride.  On one of these occasions, he brought the animal\r\nback reeking; when Tommy Mitcheson, the bank horse-keeper, a rough-spoken\r\nfellow, exclaimed to him: \"Set such fellows as you on horseback, and\r\nyou'll soon ride to the De'il.\"  But Tommy Mitcheson lived to tell the\r\njoke, and to confess that, after all, there had been a better issue to\r\nGeorge's horsemanship than that which he predicted.\r\n\r\nOld Cree, the engine-wright at Killingworth High Pit, having been killed\r\nby an accident, George Stephenson was, in 1812, appointed engine-wright\r\nof the colliery at the salary of 100 pounds a year.  He was also allowed\r\nthe use of a galloway to ride upon in his visits of inspection to the\r\ncollieries leased by the \"Grand Allies\" in that neighbourhood.  The\r\n\"Grand Allies\" were a company of gentlemen, consisting of Sir Thomas\r\nLiddell (afterwards Lord Ravensworth), the Earl of Strathmore, and Mr.\r\nStuart Wortley (afterwards Lord Wharncliffe), the lessees of the\r\nKillingworth collieries.  Having been informed of the merits of\r\nStephenson, of his indefatigable industry, and the skill which he had\r\ndisplayed in the repairs of the pumping-engines, they readily acceded to\r\nMr. Dodds' recommendation that he should be appointed the colliery\r\nengine-wright; and, as we shall afterwards find, they continued to honour\r\nhim by distinguished marks of their approval.\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: Killingworth High Pit]\r\n\r\n                   [Picture: Glebe Farm House, Benton]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE STEPHENSONS AT KILLINGWORTH--EDUCATION AND SELF-EDUCATION OF FATHER\r\nAND SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson had now been diligently employed for several years in\r\nthe work of self-improvement, and he experienced the usual results in\r\nincreasing mental strength, capability, and skill.  Perhaps the secret of\r\nevery man's best success is to be found in the alacrity and industry with\r\nwhich he takes advantage of the opportunities which present themselves\r\nfor well-doing.  Our engineman was an eminent illustration of the\r\nimportance of cultivating this habit of life.  Every spare moment was\r\nlaid under contribution by him, either for the purpose of adding to his\r\nearnings, or to his knowledge.  He missed no opportunity of extending his\r\nobservations, especially in his own department of work, ever aiming at\r\nimprovement, and trying to turn all that he did know to useful practical\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nHe continued his attempts to solve the mystery of Perpetual Motion, and\r\ncontrived several model machines with the object of embodying his ideas\r\nin a practical working shape.  He afterwards used to lament the time he\r\nhad lost in these futile efforts, and said that if he had enjoyed the\r\nopportunity which most young men now have, of learning from books what\r\nprevious experimenters had accomplished, he would have been spared much\r\nlabour and mortification.  Not being acquainted with what other mechanics\r\nhad done, he groped his way in pursuit of some idea originated by his own\r\nindependent thinking and observation; and, when he had brought it into\r\nsome definite form, lo! he found that his supposed invention had long\r\nbeen known and recorded in scientific books.  Often he thought he had hit\r\nupon discoveries, which he subsequently found were but old and exploded\r\nfallacies.  Yet his very struggle to overcome the difficulties which lay\r\nin his way, was of itself an education of the best sort.  By wrestling\r\nwith them, he strengthened his judgment and sharpened his skill,\r\nstimulating and cultivating his inventiveness and mechanical ingenuity.\r\nBeing very much in earnest, he was compelled to consider the subject of\r\nhis special inquiry in all its relations; and thus he gradually acquired\r\npractical ability even through his very efforts after the impracticable.\r\n\r\nMany of his evenings were now spent in the society of John Wigham, whose\r\nfather occupied the Glebe Farm at Benton, close at hand.  John was a fair\r\npenman and a sound arithmetician, and Stephenson sought his society\r\nchiefly for the purpose of improving himself in writing and \"figures.\"\r\nUnder Andrew Robertson, he had never quite mastered the Rule of Three,\r\nand it was only when Wigham took him in hand that he made much progress\r\nin the higher branches of arithmetic.  He generally took his slate with\r\nhim to the Wighams' cottage, when he had his sums set, that he might work\r\nthem out while tending his engine on the following day.  When too busy to\r\nbe able to call upon Wigham, he sent the slate to have the former sums\r\ncorrected and new ones set.  Sometimes also, at leisure moments, he was\r\nenabled to do a little \"figuring\" with chalk upon the sides of the\r\ncoal-waggons.  So much patient perseverance could not but eventually\r\nsucceed; and by dint of practice and study, Stephenson was enabled to\r\nmaster successively the various rules of arithmetic.\r\n\r\nJohn Wigham was of great use to his pupil in many ways.  He was a good\r\ntalker, fond of argument, an extensive reader as country reading went in\r\nthose days, and a very suggestive thinker.  Though his store of\r\ninformation might be comparatively small when measured with that of more\r\nhighly-cultivated minds, much of it was entirely new to Stephenson, who\r\nregarded him as a very clever and ingenious person.  Wigham taught him to\r\ndraw plans and sections; though in this branch Stephenson proved so apt\r\nthat he soon surpassed his master.  A volume of 'Ferguson's Lectures on\r\nMechanics,' which fell into their hands, was a great treasure to both the\r\nstudents.  One who remembers their evening occupations says he used to\r\nwonder what they meant by weighing the air and water in so odd a way.\r\nThey were trying the specific gravities of objects; and the devices which\r\nthey employed, the mechanical shifts to which they were put, were often\r\nof the rudest kind.  In these evening entertainments, the mechanical\r\ncontrivances were supplied by Stephenson, whilst Wigham found the\r\nscientific rationale.  The opportunity thus afforded to the former of\r\ncultivating his mind by contact with one wiser than himself proved of\r\ngreat value, and in after-life Stephenson gratefully remembered the\r\nassistance which, when a humble workman, he had derived from John Wigham,\r\nthe farmer's son.\r\n\r\nHis leisure moments thus carefully improved, it will be inferred that\r\nStephenson continued a sober man.  Though his notions were never extreme\r\non this point, he was systematically temperate.  It appears that on the\r\ninvitation of his master, he had, on one or two occasions, been induced\r\nto join him in a forenoon glass of ale in the public-house of the\r\nvillage.  But one day, about noon, when Dodds had got him as far as the\r\npublic-house door, on his invitation to \"come in and take a glass o'\r\nyel,\" Stephenson made a dead stop, and said, firmly, \"No, sir, you must\r\nexcuse me; I have made a resolution to drink no more at this time of\r\nday.\"  And he went back.  He desired to retain the character of a steady\r\nworkman; and the instances of men about him who had made shipwreck of\r\ntheir character through intemperance, were then, as now, unhappily but\r\ntoo frequent.\r\n\r\nBut another consideration besides his own self-improvement had already\r\nbegun to exercise an important influence on his life.  This was the\r\ntraining and education of his son Robert, now growing up an active,\r\nintelligent boy, as full of fun and tricks as his father had been.  When\r\na little fellow, scarcely able to reach so high as to put a clock-head on\r\nwhen placed upon the table, his father would make him mount a chair for\r\nthe purpose; and to \"help father\" was the proudest work which the boy\r\nthen, and ever after, could take part in.  When the little engine was set\r\nup at the Ochre Quarry to pump it dry, Robert was scarcely absent for an\r\nhour.  He watched the machine very eagerly when it was set to work; and\r\nhe was very much annoyed at the fire burning away the grates.  The man\r\nwho fired the engine was a sort of wag, and thinking to get a laugh at\r\nthe boy, he said, \"Those bars are getting varra bad, Robert; I think we\r\nmain cut up some of that hard wood, and put it in instead.\"  \"What would\r\nbe the use of that, you fool?\" said the boy quickly.  \"You would no\r\nsooner have put them in than they would be burnt out again!\"\r\n\r\nSo soon as Robert was of proper age, his father sent him over to the\r\nroad-side school at Long Benton, kept by Rutter, the parish clerk.  But\r\nthe education which Rutter could give was of a very limited kind,\r\nscarcely extending beyond the primer and pothooks.  While working as a\r\nbrakesman on the pit-head at Killingworth, the father had often bethought\r\nhim of the obstructions he had himself encountered in life through his\r\nwant of schooling; and he formed the noble determination that no labour,\r\nnor pains, nor self-denial on his part should be spared to furnish his\r\nson with the best education that it was in his power to bestow.\r\n\r\n              [Picture: Rutter's School House, Long Benton]\r\n\r\nIt is true his earnings were comparatively small at that time.  He was\r\nstill maintaining his infirm parents; and the cost of living continued\r\nexcessive.  But he fell back upon his old expedient of working up his\r\nspare time in the evenings at home, or during the night shifts when it\r\nwas his turn to tend the engine, in mending and making shoes, cleaning\r\nclocks and watches, making shoe-lasts for the shoe-makers of the\r\nneighbourhood, and cutting out the pitmen's clothes for their wives; and\r\nwe have been told that to this day there are clothes worn at Killingworth\r\nmade after \"Geordy Steevie's cut.\"  To give his own words:--\"In the\r\nearlier period of my career,\" said he, \"when Robert was a little boy, I\r\nsaw how deficient I was in education, and I made up my mind that he\r\nshould not labour under the same defect, but that I would put him to a\r\ngood school, and give him a liberal training.  I was, however, a poor\r\nman; and how do you think I managed?  I betook myself to mending my\r\nneighbours' clocks and watches at nights, after my daily labour was done,\r\nand thus I procured the means of educating my son.\" {52}\r\n\r\nCarrying out the resolution as to his boy's education, Robert was sent to\r\nMr. Bruce's school in Percy Street, Newcastle, at Midsummer, 1815, when\r\nhe was about twelve years old.  His father bought for him a donkey, on\r\nwhich he rode into Newcastle and back daily; and there are many still\r\nliving who remember the little boy, dressed in his suit of homely grey\r\nstuff, cut out by his father, cantering along to school upon the \"cuddy,\"\r\nwith his wallet of provisions for the day and his bag of books slung over\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert went to Mr. Bruce's school, he was a shy, unpolished country\r\nlad, speaking the broad dialect of the pitmen; and the other boys would\r\noccasionally tease him, for the purpose of provoking an outburst of his\r\nKillingworth Doric.  As the shyness got rubbed off, his love of fun began\r\nto show itself, and he was found able enough to hold his own amongst the\r\nother boys.  As a scholar he was steady and diligent, and his master was\r\naccustomed to hold him up to the laggards of the school as an example of\r\ngood conduct and industry.  But his progress, though satisfactory, was by\r\nno means extraordinary.  He used in after-life to pride himself on his\r\nachievements in mensuration, though another boy, John Taylor, beat him at\r\narithmetic.  He also made considerable progress in mathematics; and in a\r\nletter written to the son of his teacher, many years after, he said, \"It\r\nwas to Mr. Bruce's tuition and methods of modelling the mind that I\r\nattribute much of my success as an engineer; for it was from him that I\r\nderived my taste for mathematical pursuits and the facility I possess of\r\napplying this kind of knowledge to practical purposes and modifying it\r\naccording to circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Picture: Bruce's School, Newcastle]\r\n\r\nDuring the time Robert attended school at Newcastle, his father made the\r\nboy's education instrumental to his own.  Robert was accustomed to spend\r\nsome of his spare time at the rooms of the Literary and Philosophical\r\nInstitute; and when he went home in the evening, he would recount to his\r\nfather the results of his reading.  Sometimes he was allowed to take with\r\nhim to Killingworth a volume of the 'Repertory of Arts and Sciences,'\r\nwhich father and son studied together.  But many of the most valuable\r\nworks belonging to the Newcastle Library were not lent out; these Robert\r\nwas instructed to read and study, and bring away with him descriptions\r\nand sketches for his father's information.  His father also practised him\r\nin reading plans and drawings without reference to the written\r\ndescriptions.  He used to observe that \"A good plan should always explain\r\nitself;\" and, placing a drawing of an engine or machine before the youth,\r\nwould say, \"There, now, describe that to me--the arrangement and the\r\naction.\"  Thus he taught him to read a drawing as easily as he would read\r\na page of a book.  Both father and son profited by this excellent\r\npractice, which enabled them to apprehend with the greatest facility the\r\ndetails of even the most difficult and complicated mechanical drawing.\r\n\r\nWhile Robert went on with his lessons in the evenings, his father was\r\nusually occupied with his watch and clock cleaning; or in contriving\r\nmodels of pumping-engines; or endeavouring to embody in a tangible shape\r\nthe mechanical inventions which he found described in the odd volumes on\r\nMechanics which fell in his way.  This daily and unceasing example of\r\nindustry and application, in the person of a loving and beloved father,\r\nimprinted itself deeply upon the boy's heart in characters never to be\r\neffaced.  A spirit of self-improvement was thus early and carefully\r\nplanted and fostered in Robert's mind, which continued to influence him\r\nthrough life; and to the close of his career, he was proud to confess\r\nthat if his professional success had been great, it was mainly to the\r\nexample and training of his father that he owed it.\r\n\r\nRobert was not, however, exclusively devoted to study, but, like most\r\nboys full of animal spirits, he was very fond of fun and play, and\r\nsometimes of mischief.  Dr. Bruce relates that an old Killingworth\r\nlabourer, when asked by Robert, on one of his last visits to Newcastle,\r\nif he remembered him, replied with emotion, \"Ay, indeed!  Haven't I paid\r\nyour head many a time when you came with your father's bait, for you were\r\nalways a sad hempy?\"\r\n\r\nThe author had the pleasure, in the year 1854, of accompanying Robert\r\nStephenson on a visit to his old home and haunts at Killingworth.  He had\r\nso often travelled the road upon his donkey to and from school, that\r\nevery foot of it was familiar to him; and each turn in it served to\r\nrecall to mind some incident of his boyish days.  His eyes glistened when\r\nhe came in sight of Killingworth pit-head.  Pointing to a humble\r\nred-tiled house by the road-side at Benton, he said, \"You see that\r\nhouse--that was Rutter's, where I learnt my A B C, and made a beginning\r\nof my school learning.  And there,\" pointing to a colliery chimney on the\r\nleft, \"there is Long Benton, where my father put up his first\r\npumping-engine; and a great success it was.  And this humble clay-floored\r\ncottage you see here, is where my grandfather lived till the close of his\r\nlife.  Many a time have I ridden straight into the house, mounted on my\r\ncuddy, and called upon grandfather to admire his points.  I remember the\r\nold man feeling the animal all over--he was then quite blind--after which\r\nhe would dilate upon the shape of his ears, fetlocks, and quarters, and\r\nusually end by pronouncing him to be a 'real blood.'  I was a great\r\nfavourite with the old man, who continued very fond of animals, and\r\ncheerful to the last; and I believe nothing gave him greater pleasure\r\nthan a visit from me and my cuddy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the way from Benton to High Killingworth, Mr. Stephenson pointed to a\r\ncorner of the road where he had once played a boyish trick upon a\r\nKillingworth collier.  \"Straker,\" said he, \"was a great bully, a coarse,\r\nswearing fellow, and a perfect tyrant amongst the women and children.  He\r\nwould go tearing into old Nanny the huxter's shop in the village, and\r\ndemand in a savage voice, 'What's ye'r best ham the pund?'  'What's floor\r\nthe hunder?'  'What d'ye ax for prime bacon?'--his questions often ending\r\nwith the miserable order, accompanied with a tremendous oath, of 'Gie's a\r\npenny rrow (roll) an' a baubee herrin!'  The poor woman was usually set\r\n'all of a shake' by a visit from this fellow.  He was also a great\r\nboaster, and used to crow over the robbers whom he had put to flight;\r\nmere men in buckram, as everybody knew.  We boys,\" he continued,\r\n\"believed him to be a great coward, and determined to play him a trick.\r\nTwo other boys joined me in waylaying Straker one night at that corner,\"\r\npointing to it.  \"We sprang out and called upon him, in as gruff voices\r\nas we could assume, to 'stand and deliver!'  He dropped down upon his\r\nknees in the dirt, declaring he was a poor man, with a sma' family,\r\nasking for 'mercy,' and imploring us, as 'gentlemen, for God's sake, t'\r\nlet him a-be!'  We couldn't stand this any longer, and set up a shout of\r\nlaughter.  Recognizing our boys' voices, he sprang to his feet and\r\nrattled out a volley of oaths; on which we cut through the hedge, and\r\nheard him shortly after swearing his way along the road to the\r\nyel-house.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Robert played a series of tricks of a somewhat\r\ndifferent character.  Like his father, he was very fond of reducing his\r\nscientific reading to practice; and after studying Franklin's description\r\nof the lightning experiment, he proceeded to expend his store of Saturday\r\npennies in purchasing about half a mile of copper wire at a brazier's\r\nshop in Newcastle.  Having prepared his kite, he sent it up in the field\r\nopposite his father's door, and bringing the wire, insulated by means of\r\na few feet of silk cord, over the backs of some of Farmer Wigham's cows,\r\nhe soon had them skipping about the field in all directions with their\r\ntails up.  One day he had his kite flying at the cottage-door as his\r\nfather's galloway was hanging by the bridle to the paling, waiting for\r\nthe master to mount.  Bringing the end of the wire just over the pony's\r\ncrupper, so smart an electric shock was given it, that the brute was\r\nalmost knocked down.  At this juncture the father issued from the door,\r\nriding-whip in hand, and was witness to the scientific trick just played\r\noff upon his galloway.  \"Ah! you mischievous scoondrel!\" cried he to the\r\nboy, who ran off.  He inwardly chuckled with pride, nevertheless, at\r\nRobert's successful experiment. {57}\r\n\r\n                [Picture: Stephenson's Cottage, West Moor]\r\n\r\nAt this time, and for many years after, Stephenson dwelt in a cottage\r\nstanding by the side of the road leading from the West Moor colliery to\r\nKillingworth.  The railway from the West Moor Pit crosses this road close\r\nby the east end of the cottage.  The dwelling originally consisted of but\r\none apartment on the ground-floor, with the garret over-head, to which\r\naccess was obtained by means of a step-ladder.  But with his own hands\r\nStephenson built an oven, and in the course of time he added rooms to the\r\ncottage, until it became a comfortable four-roomed dwelling, in which he\r\nlived as long as he remained at Killingworth.\r\n\r\nHe continued as fond of birds and animals as ever, and seemed to have the\r\npower of attaching them to him in a remarkable degree.  He had a\r\nblackbird at Killingworth so fond of him that it would fly about the\r\ncottage, and on holding out his finger, would come and perch upon it.  A\r\ncage was built for \"blackie\" in the partition between the passage and the\r\nroom, a square of glass forming its outer wall; and Robert used\r\nafterwards to take pleasure in describing the oddity of the bird,\r\nimitating the manner in which it would cock its head on his father's\r\nentering the house, and follow him with its eye into the inner apartment.\r\n\r\nNeighbours were accustomed to call at the cottage and have their clocks\r\nand watches set to rights when they went wrong.  One day, after looking\r\nat the works of a watch left by a pitman's wife, George handed it to his\r\nson; \"Put her in the oven, Robert,\" said he, \"for a quarter of an hour or\r\nso.\"  It seemed an odd way of repairing a watch; nevertheless, the watch\r\nwas put into the oven, and at the end of the appointed time it was taken\r\nout, going all right.  The wheels had merely got clogged by the oil\r\ncongealed by the cold; which at once explains the rationale of the remedy\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThere was a little garden attached to the cottage, in which, while a\r\nworkman, Stephenson took a pride in growing gigantic leeks and astounding\r\ncabbages.  There was great competition amongst the villagers in the\r\ngrowth of vegetables, all of whom he excelled, excepting one of his\r\nneighbours, whose cabbages sometimes outshone his.  In the protection of\r\nhis garden-crops from the ravages of the birds, he invented a strange\r\nsort of \"fley-craw,\" which moved its arms with the wind; and he fastened\r\nhis garden-door by means of a piece of ingenious mechanism, so that no\r\none but himself could enter it.  His cottage was quite a curiosity-shop\r\nof models of engines, self-acting planes, and perpetual-motion machines.\r\nThe last-named contrivances, however, were only unsuccessful attempts to\r\nsolve a problem which had effectually baffled hundreds of preceding\r\ninventors.  His odd and eccentric contrivances often excited great wonder\r\namongst the Killingworth villagers.  He won the women's admiration by\r\nconnecting their cradles with the smoke-jack, and making them\r\nself-acting.  Then he astonished the pitmen by attaching an alarum to the\r\nclock of the watchman whose duty it was to call them betimes in the\r\nmorning.  He also contrived a wonderful lamp which burned under water,\r\nwith which he was afterwards wont to amuse the Brandling family at\r\nGosforth,--going into the fish-pond at night, lamp in hand, attracting\r\nand catching the fish, which rushed wildly towards the flame.\r\n\r\nDr. Bruce tells of a competition which Stephenson had with the joiner at\r\nKillingworth, as to which of them could make the best shoe-last; and when\r\nthe former had done his work, either for the humour of the thing, or to\r\nsecure fair play from the appointed judge, he took it to the Morrisons in\r\nNewcastle, and got them to put their stamp upon it.  So that it is\r\npossible the Killingworth brakesman, afterwards the inventor of the\r\nsafety lamp and the originator of the railway system, and John Morrison,\r\nthe last-maker, afterwards the translator of the Scriptures into the\r\nChinese language, may have confronted each other in solemn contemplation\r\nover the successful last, which won the verdict coveted by its maker.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would endeavour to impart to his fellow-workmen the results\r\nof his scientific reading.  Everything that he learnt from books was so\r\nnew and so wonderful to him, that he regarded the facts he drew from them\r\nin the light of discoveries, as if they had been made but yesterday.\r\nOnce he tried to explain to some of the pitmen how the earth was round,\r\nand kept turning round.  But his auditors flatly declared the thing to be\r\nimpossible, as it was clear that \"at the bottom side they must fall off!\"\r\n\"Ah!\" said George, \"you don't quite understand it yet.\"  His son Robert\r\nalso early endeavoured to communicate to others the information which he\r\nhad gathered at school; and Dr. Bruce has related that, when visiting\r\nKillingworth on one occasion, he found him engaged in teaching algebra to\r\nsuch of the pitmen's boys as would become his pupils.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: The Sundial]\r\n\r\nWhile Robert was still at school, his father proposed to him during the\r\nholidays that he should construct a sun-dial, to be placed over their\r\ncottage-door at West Moor.  \"I expostulated with him at first,\" said\r\nRobert, \"that I had not learnt sufficient astronomy and mathematics to\r\nenable me to make the necessary calculations.  But he would have no\r\ndenial.  'The thing is to be done,' said he; 'so just set about it at\r\nonce.'  Well; we got a 'Ferguson's Astronomy,' and studied the subject\r\ntogether.  Many a sore head I had while making the necessary calculations\r\nto adapt the dial to the latitude of Killingworth.  But at length it was\r\nfairly drawn out on paper, and then my father got a stone, and we hewed,\r\nand carved, and polished it, until we made a very respectable dial of it;\r\nand there it is, you see,\" pointing to it over the cottage-door, \"still\r\nquietly numbering the hours when the sun is shining.  I assure you, not a\r\nlittle was thought of that piece of work by the pitmen when it was put\r\nup, and began to tell its tale of time.\"  The date carved upon the dial\r\nis \"August 11th, MDCCCXVI.\"  Both father and son were in after-life very\r\nproud of the joint production.  Many years after, George took a party of\r\nsavans, when attending the meeting of the British Association at\r\nNewcastle, over to Killingworth to see the pits, and he did not fail to\r\ndirect their attention to the sun-dial; and Robert, on the last visit\r\nwhich he made to the place, a short time before his death, took a friend\r\ninto the cottage, and pointed out to him the very desk, still there, at\r\nwhich he had sat while making his calculations of the latitude of\r\nKillingworth.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his appointment as engineer at the Killingworth Pit,\r\nGeorge Stephenson was in a measure relieved from the daily routine of\r\nmanual labour, having, as we have seen, advanced himself to the grade of\r\na higher class workman.  But he had not ceased to be a worker, though he\r\nemployed his industry in a different way.  It might, indeed, be inferred\r\nthat he had now the command of greater leisure; but his spare hours were\r\nas much as ever given to work, either necessary or self-imposed.  So far\r\nas regarded his social position, he had already reached the summit of his\r\nambition; and when he had got his hundred a year, and his dun galloway to\r\nride on, he said he never wanted to be any higher.  When Robert Whetherly\r\noffered to give him an old gig, his travelling having so much increased\r\nof late, he accepted it with great reluctance, observing, that he should\r\nbe ashamed to get into it, \"people would think him so proud.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the High Pit had been sunk, and the coal was ready for working,\r\nStephenson erected his first winding-engine to draw the coals out of the\r\npit, and also a pumping-engine for Long Benton Colliery, both of which\r\nproved quite successful.  Amongst other works of this time, he projected\r\nand laid down a self-acting incline along the declivity which fell\r\ntowards the coal-loading place near Willington, where he had officiated\r\nas brakesman; and he so arranged it, that the full waggons descending\r\ndrew the empty waggons up the railroad.  This was one of the first\r\nself-acting inclines laid down in the district.\r\n\r\nStephenson had now much better opportunities than hitherto for improving\r\nhimself in mechanics.  His familiar acquaintance with the steam-engine\r\nproved of great value to him.  His shrewd insight, and his intimate\r\npractical acquaintance with its mechanism, enabled him to apprehend, as\r\nif by intuition, its most abstruse and difficult combinations.  The\r\npractical study which he had given to it when a workman, and the patient\r\nmanner in which he had groped his way through all the details of the\r\nmachine, gave him the power of a master in dealing with it as applied to\r\ncolliery purposes.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Liddell was frequently about the works, and took pleasure in\r\ngiving every encouragement to the engine-wright in his efforts after\r\nimprovement.  The subject of the locomotive engine was already closely\r\noccupying Stephenson's attention; although it was still regarded as a\r\ncurious and costly toy, of comparatively little real use.  But he had at\r\nan early period detected its practical value, and formed an adequate\r\nconception of the might which as yet slumbered within it; and he now bent\r\nhis entire faculties to the development of its extraordinary powers.\r\n\r\n               [Picture: Colliers' Cottages at Long Benton]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF THE LOCOMOTIVE--GEORGE STEPHENSON BEGINS ITS\r\nIMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase in the coal-trade of the Tyne about the beginning of\r\nthe present century had the effect of stimulating the ingenuity of\r\nmechanics, and encouraging them to devise improved methods of\r\ntransporting the coal from the pits to the shipping places.  From our\r\nintroductory chapter, it will have been observed that the improvements\r\nwhich had thus far been effected were confined almost entirely to the\r\nroad.  The railway waggons still continued to be drawn by horses.  By\r\nimproving and flattening the tramway, considerable economy in horse-power\r\nhad indeed been secured; but unless some more effective method of\r\nmechanical traction could be devised, it was clear that railway\r\nimprovement had almost reached its limits.\r\n\r\nMany expedients had been tried with this object.  One of the earliest was\r\nthat of hoisting sails upon the waggons, and driving them along the\r\nwaggon-way, as a ship is driven through the water by the wind.  This\r\nmethod seems to have been employed by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, an\r\ningenious coal-miner at Neath in Glamorganshire, about the end of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAfter having been lost sight of for more than a century, the same plan of\r\nimpelling carriages was revived by Richard Lovell Edgworth, with the\r\naddition of a portable railway, since revived also, in Boydell's patent.\r\nBut although Mr. Edgworth devoted himself to the subject for many years,\r\nhe failed in securing the adoption of his sailing carriage.  It is indeed\r\nquite clear that a power so uncertain as wind could never be relied on\r\nfor ordinary traffic, and Mr. Edgworth's project was consequently left to\r\nrepose in the limbo of the Patent Office, with thousands of other equally\r\nuseless though ingenious contrivances.\r\n\r\nA much more favourite scheme was the application of steam power for the\r\npurpose of carriage traction.  Savery, the inventor of the working\r\nsteam-engine, was the first to propose its employment to propel vehicles\r\nalong the common roads; and in 1759 Dr. Robison, then a young man\r\nstudying at Glasgow College, threw out the same idea to his friend James\r\nWatt; but the scheme was not matured.\r\n\r\n                        [Picture: Cugnot's Engine]\r\n\r\nThe first locomotive steam-carriage was built at Paris by the French\r\nengineer Cugnot, a native of Lorraine.  It is said to have been invented\r\nfor the purpose of dragging cannon into the field independent of horses.\r\nThe original model of this machine was made in 1763.  Count Saxe was so\r\nmuch pleased with it, that on his recommendation a full-sized engine was\r\nconstructed at the cost of the French monarch; and in 1769 it was tried\r\nin the presence of the Duc de Choiseul, Minister of War, General\r\nGribeauval, and other officers.  At one of the experiments it ran with\r\nsuch force as to knock down a wall in its way.  But the new vehicle,\r\nloaded with four persons, could not travel faster than two and a half\r\nmiles an hour.  The boiler was insufficient in size, and it could only\r\nwork for about fifteen minutes; after which it was necessary to wait\r\nuntil the steam had again risen to a sufficient pressure.  To remedy this\r\ndefect, Cugnot constructed a new machine in 1770, the working of which\r\nwas more satisfactory.  It was composed of two parts--the fore part\r\nconsisting of a small steam-engine, formed of a round copper boiler, with\r\na furnace inside, provided with two small chimneys and two single-acting\r\nbrass steam cylinders, whose pistons acted alternately upon the single\r\ndriving-wheel.  The hinder part consisted merely of a rude carriage on\r\ntwo wheels to carry the load, furnished with a seat in front for the\r\nconductor.  This engine was tried in the streets of Paris; but when\r\npassing near where the Madeleine now stands, it overbalanced itself on\r\nturning a corner, and fell over with a crash; after which, its employment\r\nbeing thought dangerous, it was locked up in the arsenal to prevent\r\nfurther mischief.  The machine is, however, still to be seen in the\r\ncollection of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers at Paris.  It has\r\nvery much the look of a long brewer's cart, with the addition of the\r\ncircular boiler hung on at one end.  Rough though it looks, it was a\r\nhighly creditable piece of work, considering the period at which it was\r\nexecuted; and as the first actual machine constructed for the purpose of\r\ntravelling on ordinary roads by the power of steam, it is certainly a\r\nmost curious and interesting mechanical relic, well worthy of\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nBut though Cugnot's road locomotive remained locked up from public sight,\r\nthe subject was not dead; for we find inventors employing themselves from\r\ntime to time in attempting to solve the problem of steam locomotion in\r\nplaces far remote from Paris.  The idea had taken root in the minds of\r\ninventors, and was striving to grow into a reality.  Thus Oliver Evans,\r\nthe American, invented a steam carriage in 1772 to travel on common\r\nroads; in 1787 he obtained from the State of Maryland an exclusive right\r\nto make and use steam-carriages, but his invention never came into use.\r\nThen, in 1784, William Symington, one of the early inventors of the\r\nsteamboat, was similarly occupied in Scotland in endeavouring to develop\r\nthe latent powers of the steam-carriage.  He had a working model of one\r\nconstructed, which he exhibited in 1786 to the professors of Edinburgh\r\nCollege; but the state of the Scotch roads was then so bad that he found\r\nit impracticable to proceed further with his scheme, which he shortly\r\nafter abandoned in favour of steam navigation.\r\n\r\n                  [Picture: Section of Murdock's Model]\r\n\r\nThe same year in which Symington was occupied upon his steam-carriage,\r\nWilliam Murdock, the friend and assistant of Watt, constructed his model\r\nof a locomotive at the opposite end of the island--at Redruth in\r\nCornwall.  His model was of small dimensions, standing little more than a\r\nfoot high; and it was until recently in the possession of the son of the\r\ninventor, at whose house we saw it a few years ago.  The annexed section\r\nwill give an idea of the arrangements of this machine.\r\n\r\nIt acted on the high-pressure principle, and, like Cugnot's engine, ran\r\nupon three wheels, the boiler being heated by a spirit-lamp.  Small\r\nthough the machine was, it went so fast on one occasion that it fairly\r\noutran its inventor.  It seems that one night after returning from his\r\nduties at the Redruth mine, Murdock determined to try the working of his\r\nmodel locomotive.  For this purpose he had recourse to the walk leading\r\nto the church, about a mile from the town.  It was rather narrow, and was\r\nbounded on each side by high hedges.  The night was dark, and Murdock set\r\nout alone to try his experiment.  Having lit his lamp, the water boiled\r\nspeedily, and off started the engine with the inventor after it.  He soon\r\nheard distant shouts of terror.  It was too dark to perceive objects; but\r\nhe found, on following up the machine, that the cries proceeded from the\r\nworthy pastor of the parish, who, going towards the town, was met on this\r\nlonely road by the hissing and fiery little monster, which he\r\nsubsequently declared he had taken to be the Evil One _in propria\r\npersona_.  No further steps were, however, taken by Murdock to embody his\r\nidea of a locomotive carriage in a more practical form.\r\n\r\nThe idea was next taken up by Murdock's pupil, Richard Trevithick, who\r\nresolved on building a steam-carriage adapted for common roads as well as\r\nrailways.  He took out a patent to secure the right of his invention in\r\n1802.  Andrew Vivian, his cousin, joined with him in the patent--Vivian\r\nfinding the money, and Trevithick the brains.  The steam-carriage built\r\non this patent presented the appearance of an ordinary stage-coach on\r\nfour wheels.  The engine had one horizontal cylinder, which, together\r\nwith the boiler and the furnace-box, was placed in the rear of the hind\r\naxle.  The motion of the piston was transmitted to a separate crank-axle,\r\nfrom which, through the medium of spur-gear, the axle of the\r\ndriving-wheel (which was mounted with a fly-wheel) derived its motion.\r\nThe steam-cocks and the force-pump, as also the bellows used for the\r\npurpose of quickening combustion in the furnace, were worked off the same\r\ncrank-axle.\r\n\r\nJohn Petherick, of Camborne, has related that he remembers this first\r\nEnglish steam-coach passing along the principal street of his native\r\ntown.  Considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping up the pressure\r\nof steam; but when there was pressure enough, Trevithick would call upon\r\nthe people to \"jump up,\" so as to create a load upon the engine.  It was\r\nsoon covered with men attracted by the novelty, nor did their number seem\r\nto make any difference in the speed of the engine so long as there was\r\nsteam enough; but it was constantly running short, and the horizontal\r\nbellows failed to keep it up.\r\n\r\nThis road-locomotive of Trevithick's was one of the first high-pressure\r\nworking engines constructed on the principle of moving a piston by the\r\nelasticity of steam against the pressure only of the atmosphere.  Such an\r\nengine had been described by Leopold, though in his apparatus it was\r\nproposed that the pressure should act only on one side of the piston.  In\r\nTrevithick's engine the piston was not only raised, but was also\r\ndepressed by the action of the steam, being in this respect an entirely\r\noriginal invention, and of great merit.  The steam was admitted from the\r\nboiler under the piston moving in a cylinder, impelling it upward.  When\r\nthe motion had reached its limit, the communication between the piston\r\nand the under side was shut off, and the steam allowed to escape into the\r\natmosphere.  A passage being then opened between the boiler and the upper\r\nside of the piston, which was pressed downwards, the steam was again\r\nallowed to escape as before.  Thus the power of the engine was equal to\r\nthe difference between the pressure of the atmosphere and the elasticity\r\nof the steam in the boiler.\r\n\r\nThis steam-carriage excited considerable interest in the remote district\r\nnear the Land's End where it had been erected.  Being so far removed from\r\nthe great movements and enterprise of the commercial world, Trevithick\r\nand Vivian determined upon exhibiting their machine in the metropolis.\r\nThey accordingly set out with it to Plymouth, whence it was conveyed by\r\nsea to London.\r\n\r\nThe carriage safely reached the metropolis, and excited much public\r\ninterest.  It also attracted the notice of scientific men, amongst others\r\nof Mr. Davies Gilbert, President of the Royal Society, and Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, both Cornishmen like Trevithick, who went to see the private\r\nperformances of the engine, and were greatly pleased with it.  Writing to\r\na Cornish friend shortly after its arrival in town, Sir Humphry said: \"I\r\nshall soon hope to hear that the roads of England are the haunts of\r\nCaptain Trevithick's dragons--a characteristic name.\"  The machine was\r\nafterwards publicly exhibited in an enclosed piece of ground near Euston\r\nSquare, where the London and North-Western Station now stands, and it\r\ndragged behind it a wheel-carriage full of passengers.  On the second day\r\nof the performance, crowds flocked to see it; but Trevithick, in one of\r\nhis odd freaks, shut up the place, and shortly after removed the engine.\r\nIt is, however, probable that the inventor came to the conclusion that\r\nthe state of the roads at that time was such as to preclude its coming\r\ninto general use for purposes of ordinary traffic.\r\n\r\nWhile the steam-carriage was being exhibited, a gentleman was laying\r\nheavy wagers as to the weight which could be hauled by a single horse on\r\nthe Wandsworth and Croydon iron tramway; and the number and weight of\r\nwaggons drawn by the horse were something surprising.  Trevithick very\r\nprobably put the two things together--the steam-horse and the\r\niron-way--and kept the performance in mind when he proceeded to construct\r\nhis second or railway locomotive.  The idea was not, however, entirely\r\nnew to him; for, although his first engine had been constructed with a\r\nview to its employment upon common roads, the specification of his patent\r\ndistinctly alludes to the application of his engine to travelling on\r\nrailroads.  Having been employed at the iron-works of Pen-y-darran, in\r\nSouth Wales, to erect a forge engine for the Company, a convenient\r\nopportunity presented itself, on the completion of this work, for\r\ncarrying out his design of a locomotive to haul the minerals along the\r\nPen-y-darran tramway.  Such an engine was erected by him in 1803, in the\r\nblacksmiths' shop at the Company's works, and it was finished and ready\r\nfor trial before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe boiler of this second engine was cylindrical in form, flat at the\r\nends, and made of wrought iron.  The furnace and flue were inside the\r\nboiler, within which the single cylinder, eight inches in diameter and\r\nfour feet six inches stroke, was placed horizontally.  As in the first\r\nengine, the motion of the wheels was produced by spur gear, to which was\r\nalso added a fly-wheel on one side, to secure a rotatory motion in the\r\ncrank at the end of each stroke of the piston in the single cylinder.\r\nThe waste steam was thrown into the chimney through a tube inserted into\r\nit at right angles; but it will be obvious that this arrangement was not\r\ncalculated to produce any result in the way of a steam-blast in the\r\nchimney.  In fact, the waste steam seems to have been turned into the\r\nchimney in order to get rid of the nuisance caused by throwing the jet\r\ndirectly into the air.  Trevithick was here hovering on the verge of a\r\ngreat discovery; but that he was not aware of the action of the blast in\r\ncontributing to increase the draught and thus quicken combustion, is\r\nclear from the fact that he employed bellows for this special purpose;\r\nand at a much later date (1815) he took out a patent which included a\r\nmethod of urging the fire by means of fanners. {70}\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Trevithick's High Pressure Tram-Engine]\r\n\r\nAt the first trial of this engine it succeeded in dragging after it\r\nseveral waggons, containing ten tons of bar-iron, at the rate of about\r\nfive miles an hour.  Rees Jones, who worked at the fitting of the engine,\r\nand remembers its performances, says, \"She was used for bringing down\r\nmetal from the furnaces to the Old Forge.  She worked very well; but\r\nfrequently, from her weight, broke the tram-plates and the hooks between\r\nthe trams.  After working for some time in this way, she took a load of\r\niron from Pen-y-darran down the Basin-road, upon which road she was\r\nintended to work.  On the journey she broke a great many of the\r\ntram-plates, and before reaching the basin ran off the road, and had to\r\nbe brought back to Pen-y-darran by horses.  The engine was never after\r\nused as a locomotive.\" {71}\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been felt that unless the road were entirely\r\nreconstructed so as to bear the heavy weight of the locomotive--so much\r\ngreater than that of the tram-waggons, to carry which the original rails\r\nhad been laid down--the regular employment of Trevithick's high-pressure\r\ntram-engine was altogether impracticable; and as the owners of the works\r\nwere not prepared to incur so serious a cost, it was determined to take\r\nthe locomotive off the road, and employ it as an engine for other\r\npurposes.  It was accordingly dismounted, and used for some time after as\r\na pumping-engine, for which purpose it was found well adapted.\r\nTrevithick himself seems from this time to have taken no further steps to\r\nbring the locomotive into general use.  We find him, shortly after,\r\nengaged upon schemes of a more promising character, abandoning the engine\r\nto other mechanical inventors, though little improvement was made in it\r\nfor several years.  An imaginary difficulty seems to have tended, amongst\r\nother obstacles, to prevent its adoption; viz., the idea that, if a heavy\r\nweight were placed behind the engine, the \"grip\" or \"bite\" of its smooth\r\nwheels upon the equally smooth iron rail, must necessarily be so slight\r\nthat they would whirl round upon it, and, consequently, that the machine\r\nwould not make progress.  Hence Trevithick, in his patent, provided that\r\nthe periphery of the driving-wheels should be made rough by the\r\nprojection of bolts or cross-grooves, so that the adhesion of the wheels\r\nto the road might be secured.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the presumed necessity for a more effectual adhesion between\r\nthe wheels and the rails, Mr. Blenkinsop of Leeds, in 1811, took out a\r\npatent for a racked or tooth-rail laid along one side of the road, into\r\nwhich the toothed-wheel of his locomotive worked as pinions work into a\r\nrack.  The boiler of his engine was supported by a carriage with four\r\nwheels without teeth, and rested immediately upon the axles.  These\r\nwheels were entirely independent of the working parts of the engine, and\r\ntherefore merely supported its weight upon the rails, the progress being\r\neffected by means of the cogged-wheel working into the cogged-rail.  The\r\nengine had two cylinders, instead of one as in Trevithick's engine.  The\r\ninvention of the double cylinder was due to Matthew Murray, of Leeds, one\r\nof the best mechanical engineers of his time; Mr. Blenkinsop, who was not\r\na mechanic, having consulted him as to all the practical arrangements.\r\nThe connecting-rods gave the motion to two pinions by cranks at right\r\nangles to each other; these pinions communicating the motion to the wheel\r\nwhich worked into the cogged-rail.\r\n\r\nMr. Blenkinsop's engines began running on the railway from the Middleton\r\nCollieries to Leeds, about 3.5 miles, on the 12th of August, 1812.  They\r\ncontinued for many years to be one of the principal curiosities of the\r\nplace, and were visited by strangers from all parts.  In 1816, the Grand\r\nDuke Nicholas (afterwards Emperor) of Russia observed the working of\r\nBlenkinsop's locomotive with curious interest and admiration.  An engine\r\ndragged as many as thirty coal-waggons at a speed of about 3.25 miles per\r\nhour.  These engines continued for many years to be thus employed in the\r\nhaulage of coal, and furnished the first instance of the regular\r\nemployment of locomotive power for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Chapman, of Newcastle, in 1812, endeavoured to overcome the\r\nsame fictitious difficulty of the want of adhesion between the wheel and\r\nthe rail, by patenting a locomotive to work along the road by means of a\r\nchain stretched from one end of it to the other.  This chain was passed\r\nonce round a grooved barrel-wheel under the centre of the engine: so\r\nthat, when the wheel turned, the locomotive, as it were, dragged itself\r\nalong the railway.  An engine, constructed after this plan, was tried on\r\nthe Heaton Railway, near Newcastle; but it was so clumsy in its action,\r\nthere was so great a loss of power by friction, and it was found to be so\r\nexpensive and difficult to keep in repair, that it was soon abandoned.\r\nAnother remarkable expedient was adopted by Mr. Brunton, of the Butterley\r\nWorks, Derbyshire, who, in 1813, patented his Mechanical Traveller, to go\r\n_upon legs_ working alternately like those of a horse. {73}  But this\r\nengine never got beyond the experimental state, for, at its very first\r\ntrial, the driver, to make sure of a good start, overloaded the\r\nsafety-valve, when the boiler burst and killed a number of the\r\nbystanders, wounding many more.  These, and other contrivances with the\r\nsame object, projected about the same time, show that invention was\r\nactively at work, and that many minds were anxiously labouring to solve\r\nthe important problem of locomotive traction upon railways.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties contended with by these early inventors, and the\r\nstep-by-step progress which they made, will probably be best illustrated\r\nby the experiments conducted by Mr. Blackett, of Wylam, which are all the\r\nmore worthy of notice, as the persevering efforts of this gentleman in a\r\ngreat measure paved the way for the labours of George Stephenson, who,\r\nshortly after, took up the question of steam locomotion, and brought it\r\nto a successful issue.\r\n\r\nThe Wylam waggon-way is one of the oldest in the north of England.  Down\r\nto the year 1807 it was formed of wooden spars or rails, laid down\r\nbetween the colliery at Wylam--where old Robert Stephenson had\r\nworked--and the village of Lemington, some four miles down the Tyne,\r\nwhere the coals were loaded into keels or barges, and floated down past\r\nNewcastle, to be shipped for London.  Each chaldron-waggon had a man in\r\ncharge of it, and was originally drawn by one horse.  The rate at which\r\nthe waggons were hauled was so slow that only two journeys were performed\r\nby each man and horse in one day, and three on the day following.  This\r\nprimitive waggon-way passed, as before stated, close in front of the\r\ncottage in which George Stephenson was born; and one of the earliest\r\nsights which met his infant eyes was this wooden tramroad worked by\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackett was the first colliery owner in the North who took an active\r\ninterest in the locomotive.  Having formed the acquaintance of Trevithick\r\nin London, and inspected the performances of his engine, he determined to\r\nrepeat the Pen-y-darran experiment upon the Wylam waggon-way.  He\r\naccordingly obtained from Trevithick, in October, 1804, a plan of his\r\nengine, provided with \"friction-wheels,\" and employed Mr. John Whinfield,\r\nof Pipewellgate, Gateshead, to construct it at his foundry there.  The\r\nengine was constructed under the superintendence of one John Steele, an\r\ningenious mechanic who had been in Wales, and worked under Trevithick in\r\nfitting the engine at Pen-y-darran.  When the Gateshead locomotive was\r\nfinished, a temporary way was laid down in the works, on which it was run\r\nbackwards and forwards many times.  For some reason, however--it is said\r\nbecause the engine was deemed too light for drawing the coal-trains--it\r\nnever left the works, but was dismounted from the wheels, and set to blow\r\nthe cupola of the foundry, in which service it long continued to be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nSeveral years elapsed before Mr. Blackett took any further steps to carry\r\nout his idea.  The final abandonment of Trevithick's locomotive at\r\nPen-y-darran perhaps contributed to deter him from proceeding further;\r\nbut he had the wooden tramway taken up in 1808, and a plate-way of\r\ncast-iron laid down instead--a single line furnished with sidings to\r\nenable the laden waggons to pass the empty ones.  The new iron road\r\nproved so much smoother than the old wooden one, that a single horse,\r\ninstead of drawing one, was now enabled to draw two, or even three, laden\r\nwaggons.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success of Mr. Blenkinsop's experiment at Leeds, Mr.\r\nBlackett determined to follow his example; and in 1812 he ordered a\r\nsecond engine, to work with a toothed driving-wheel upon a rack-rail.\r\nThis locomotive was constructed by Thomas Waters, of Gateshead, under the\r\nsuperintendence of Jonathan Foster, Mr. Blackett's principal\r\nengine-wright.  It was a combination of Trevithick's and Blenkinsop's\r\nengines; but it was of a more awkward construction than either.  The\r\nboiler was of cast-iron.  The engine was provided with a single cylinder\r\nsix inches in diameter, with a fly-wheel working at one side to carry the\r\ncrank over the dead points.  Jonathan Foster described it to the author\r\nin 1854, as \"a strange machine, with lots of pumps, cog-wheels, and\r\nplugs, requiring constant attention while at work.\"  The weight of the\r\nwhole was about six tons.\r\n\r\nWhen finished, it was conveyed to Wylam on a waggon, and there mounted\r\nupon a wooden frame supported by four pairs of wheels, which had been\r\nconstructed for its reception.  A barrel of water, placed on another\r\nframe upon wheels, was attached to it as a tender.  After a great deal of\r\nlabour, the cumbrous machine was got upon the road.  At first it would\r\nnot move an inch.  Its maker, Tommy Waters, became impatient, and at\r\nlength enraged, and taking hold of the lever of the safety valve,\r\ndeclared in his desperation, that \"either _she_ or _he_ should go.\"  At\r\nlength the machinery was set in motion, on which, as Jonathan Foster\r\ndescribed to the author \"she flew all to pieces, and it was the biggest\r\nwonder i' the world that we were not all blewn up.\"  The incompetent and\r\nuseless engine was declared to be a failure; it was shortly after\r\ndismounted and sold; and Mr. Blackett's praiseworthy efforts thus far\r\nproved in vain.\r\n\r\nHe was still, however, desirous of testing the practicability of\r\nemploying locomotive power in working the coal down to Lemington, and he\r\ndetermined on another trial.  He accordingly directed his engine-wright\r\nto proceed with the building of a third engine in the Wylam workshops.\r\nThis new locomotive had a single 8-inch cylinder, was provided with a\r\nfly-wheel like its predecessor, and the driving-wheel was cogged on one\r\nside to enable it to travel in the rack-rail laid along the road.  This\r\nengine proved more successful than the former one; and it was found\r\ncapable of dragging eight or nine loaded waggons, though at the rate of\r\nlittle more than a mile an hour, from the colliery to the shipping-place.\r\nIt sometimes took six hours to perform the journey of five miles.  Its\r\nweight was found too great for the road, and the cast-iron plates were\r\nconstantly breaking.  It was also very apt to get off the rack-rail, and\r\nthen it stood still.  The driver was one day asked how he got on?  \"Get\r\non?\" said he, \"we don't get on; we only get off!\"  On such occasions,\r\nhorses had to be sent to drag the waggons as before, and others to haul\r\nthe engine back to the work-shops.  It was constantly getting out of\r\norder; its plugs, pumps, or cranks, got wrong; it was under repair as\r\noften as at work; at length it became so cranky that the horses were\r\nusually sent out after it to drag it when it gave up; and the workmen\r\ngenerally declared it to be a \"perfect plague.\"  Mr. Blackett did not\r\nobtain credit amongst his neighbours for these experiments.  Many laughed\r\nat his machines, regarding them only in the light of\r\ncrotchets,--frequently quoting the proverb that \"a fool and his money are\r\nsoon parted.\"  Others regarded them as absurd innovations on the\r\nestablished method of hauling coal; and pronounced that they would \"never\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, however, the comparative failure of this second\r\nlocomotive, Mr. Blackett persevered with his experiments.  He was\r\nzealously assisted by Jonathan Foster the engine-wright, and William\r\nHedley, the viewer of the colliery, a highly ingenious person, who proved\r\nof great use in carrying out the experiments to a successful issue.  One\r\nof the chief causes of failure being the rack-rail, the idea occurred to\r\nMr. Hedley that it might be possible to secure adhesion enough between\r\nthe wheel and the rail by the mere weight of the engine, and he proceeded\r\nto make a series of experiments for the purpose of determining this\r\nproblem.  He had a frame placed on four wheels, and fitted up with\r\nwindlasses attached by gearing to the several wheels.  The frame having\r\nbeen properly weighted, six men were set to work the windlasses; when it\r\nwas found that the adhesion of the smooth wheels on the smooth rails was\r\nquite sufficient to enable them to propel the machine without slipping.\r\nHaving found the proportion which the power bore to the weight, he\r\ndemonstrated by successive experiments that the weight of the engine\r\nwould of itself produce sufficient adhesion to enable it to draw upon a\r\nsmooth railroad the requisite number of waggons in all kinds of weather.\r\nAnd thus was the fallacy which had heretofore prevailed on this subject\r\ncompletely exploded, and it was satisfactorily proved that rack-rails,\r\ntoothed wheels, endless chains, and legs, were alike unnecessary for the\r\nefficient traction of loaded waggons upon a moderately level road.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward considerably less difficulty was experienced in\r\nworking the coal trains upon the Wylam tramroad.  At length the rack-rail\r\nwas dispensed with.  The road was laid with heavier rails; the working of\r\nthe old engine was improved; and a new engine was shortly after built and\r\nplaced upon the road, still on eight wheels, driven by seven rack-wheels\r\nworking inside them--with a wrought-iron boiler through which the flue\r\nwas returned so as largely to increase the heating surface, and thus give\r\nincreased power to the engine.\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: Improved Wylam Engine]\r\n\r\nAs may readily be imagined, the jets of steam from the piston, blowing\r\noff into the air at high pressure while the engine was in motion, caused\r\nconsiderable annoyance to horses passing along the Wylam road, at that\r\ntime a public highway.  The nuisance was felt to be almost intolerable,\r\nand a neighbouring gentleman threatened to have it put down.  To diminish\r\nthe noise as much as possible, Mr. Blackett gave orders that so soon as\r\nany horse, or horses, came in sight, the locomotive was to be stopped,\r\nand the frightful blast of the engine thus suspended until the passing\r\nanimals had got out of hearing.  Much interruption was thus caused to the\r\nworking of the railway, and it excited considerable dissatisfaction\r\namongst the workmen.  The following plan was adopted to abate the\r\nnuisance: a reservoir was provided immediately behind the chimney (as\r\nshown in the preceding cut) into which the waste steam was thrown after\r\nit had performed its office in the cylinder; and from this reservoir, the\r\nsteam gradually escaped into the atmosphere without noise.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Blackett was thus experimenting and building locomotives at\r\nWylam, George Stephenson was anxiously studying the same subject at\r\nKillingworth.  He was no sooner appointed engine-wright of the collieries\r\nthan his attention was directed to the means of more economically hauling\r\nthe coal from the pits to the river-side.  We have seen that one of the\r\nfirst important improvements which he made, after being placed in charge\r\nof the colliery machinery, was to apply the surplus power of a pumping\r\nsteam-engine, fixed underground, to drawing the coals out of the deeper\r\nworkings of the Killingworth mines,--by which he succeeded in effecting a\r\nlarge reduction in the expenditure on manual and horse labour.\r\n\r\nThe coals, when brought above ground, had next to be laboriously dragged\r\nby horses to the shipping staiths on the Tyne, several miles distant.\r\nThe adoption of a tramroad, it is true, had tended to facilitate their\r\ntransit.  Nevertheless the haulage was both tedious and costly.  With the\r\nview of economising labour, Stephenson laid down inclined planes where\r\nthe nature of the ground would admit of this expedient.  Thus, a train of\r\nfull waggons let down the incline by means of a rope running over wheels\r\nlaid along the tramroad, the other end of which was attached to a train\r\nof empty waggons placed at the bottom of the parallel road on the same\r\nincline, dragged them up by the simple power of gravity.  But this\r\napplied only to a comparatively small part of the road.  An economical\r\nmethod of working the coal trains, instead of by horses,--the keep of\r\nwhich was at that time very costly, from the high price of corn,--was\r\nstill a great desideratum; and the best practical minds in the collieries\r\nwere actively engaged in the attempt to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIn the first place Stephenson resolved to make himself thoroughly\r\nacquainted with what had already been done.  Mr. Blackett's engines were\r\nworking daily at Wylam, past the cottage where he had been born; and\r\nthither he frequently went to inspect the improvements made by Mr.\r\nBlackett from time to time both in the locomotive and in the plateway\r\nalong which it worked.  Jonathan Foster informed us that, after one of\r\nthese visits, Stephenson declared to him his conviction that a much more\r\neffective engine might be made, that should work more steadily and draw\r\nthe load more effectively.\r\n\r\nHe had also the advantage, about the same time, of seeing one of\r\nBlenkinsop's Leeds engines, which was placed on the tramway leading from\r\nthe collieries of Kenton and Coxlodge, on the 2nd September, 1813.  This\r\nlocomotive drew sixteen chaldron waggons containing an aggregate weight\r\nof seventy tons, at the rate of about three miles an hour.  George\r\nStephenson and several of the Killingworth men were amongst the crowd of\r\nspectators that day; and after examining the engine and observing its\r\nperformances, he observed to his companions, that \"he thought he could\r\nmake a better engine than that, to go upon legs.\"  Probably he had heard\r\nof the invention of Brunton, whose patent had by this time been\r\npublished, and proved the subject of much curious speculation in the\r\ncolliery districts.  Certain it is, that, shortly after the inspection of\r\nthe Coxlodge engine, he contemplated the construction of a new\r\nlocomotive, which was to surpass all that had preceded it.  He observed\r\nthat those engines which had been constructed up to this time, however\r\ningenious in their arrangements, had proved practical failures.  Mr.\r\nBlackett's was as yet both clumsy and expensive.  Chapman's had been\r\nremoved from the Heaton tramway in 1812, and was regarded as a total\r\nfailure.  And the Blenkinsop engine at Coxlodge was found very unsteady\r\nand costly in its working; besides, it pulled the rails to pieces, the\r\nentire strain being upon the rack-rail on one side of the road.  The\r\nboiler, however, having soon after blown up, there was an end of that\r\nengine; and the colliery owners did not feel encouraged to try any\r\nfurther experiment.\r\n\r\nAn efficient and economical working locomotive, therefore, still remained\r\nto be invented; and to accomplish this object Mr. Stephenson now applied\r\nhimself.  Profiting by what his predecessors had done, warned by their\r\nfailures and encouraged by their partial successes, he commenced his\r\nlabours.  There was still wanting the man who should accomplish for the\r\nlocomotive what James Watt had done for the steam-engine, and combine in\r\na complete form the best points in the separate plans of others,\r\nembodying with them such original inventions and adaptations of his own\r\nas to entitle him to the merit of inventing the working locomotive, in\r\nthe same manner as James Watt is to be regarded as the inventor of the\r\nworking condensing-engine.  This was the great work upon which George\r\nStephenson now entered, though probably without any adequate idea of the\r\nultimate importance of his labours to society and civilization.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to bring the subject of constructing a \"Travelling Engine,\"\r\nas he then denominated the locomotive, under the notice of the lessees of\r\nthe Killingworth Colliery, in the year 1813.  Lord Ravensworth, the\r\nprincipal partner, had already formed a very favourable opinion of the\r\nnew engine-wright, from the improvements which he had effected in the\r\ncolliery engines, both above and below ground; and, after considering the\r\nmatter, and hearing Stephenson's explanations, he authorised him to\r\nproceed with the construction of a locomotive,--though his lordship was,\r\nby some, called a fool for advancing money for such a purpose.  \"The\r\nfirst locomotive that I made,\" said Stephenson, many years after, {82}\r\nwhen speaking of his early career at a public meeting in Newcastle, \"was\r\nat Killingworth Colliery, and with Lord Ravensworth's money.  Yes; Lord\r\nRavensworth and partners were the first to entrust me, thirty-two years\r\nsince, with money to make a locomotive engine.  I said to my friends,\r\nthere was no limit to the speed of such an engine, if the works could be\r\nmade to stand.\"\r\n\r\nOur engine-wright had, however, many obstacles to encounter before he\r\ncould get fairly to work with the erection of his locomotive.  His chief\r\ndifficulty was in finding workmen sufficiently skilled in mechanics, and\r\nin the use of tools, to follow his instructions and embody his designs in\r\na practical shape.  The tools then in use about the collieries were rude\r\nand clumsy; and there were no such facilities as now exist for turning\r\nout machinery of an entirely new character.  Stephenson was under the\r\nnecessity of working with such men and tools as were at his command; and\r\nhe had in a great measure to train and instruct the workmen himself.  The\r\nengine was built in the workshops at the West Moor, the leading mechanic\r\nemployed being the colliery blacksmith, an excellent workman in his way,\r\nthough quite new to the work now entrusted to him.\r\n\r\nIn this first locomotive constructed at Killingworth, Stephenson to some\r\nextent followed the plan of Blenkinsop's engine.  The boiler was\r\ncylindrical, of wrought iron, 8 feet in length and 34 inches in diameter,\r\nwith an internal flue-tube 20 inches wide passing through it.  The engine\r\nhad two vertical cylinders of 8 inches diameter, and 2 feet stroke, let\r\ninto the boiler, working the propelling gear with cross heads and\r\nconnecting rods.  The power of the two cylinders was combined by means of\r\nspurwheels, which communicated the motive power to the wheels supporting\r\nthe engine on the rail, instead of, as in Blenkinsop's engine, to\r\ncogwheels which acted on the cogged rail independent of the four\r\nsupporting wheels.  The engine thus worked upon what is termed the second\r\nmotion.  The chimney was of wrought iron, round which was a chamber\r\nextending back to the feed-pumps, for the purpose of heating the water\r\nprevious to its injection into the boiler.  The engine had no springs,\r\nand was mounted on a wooden frame supported on four wheels.  In order to\r\nneutralise as much as possible the jolts and shocks which such an engine\r\nwould necessarily encounter from the obstacles and inequalities of the\r\nthen very imperfect plateway, the water-barrel which served for a tender\r\nwas fixed to the end of a lever and weighted, the other end of the lever\r\nbeing connected with the frame of the locomotive carriage.  By this means\r\nthe weight of the two was more equally distributed, though the\r\ncontrivance did not by any means compensate for the absence of springs.\r\n\r\n                         [Picture: The Spur-gear]\r\n\r\nThe wheels of the locomotive were all smooth, Mr. Stephenson having\r\nsatisfied himself by experiment that the adhesion between the wheels of a\r\nloaded engine and the rail would be sufficient for the purpose of\r\ntraction.  Robert Stephenson informed us that his father caused a number\r\nof workmen to mount upon the wheels of a waggon moderately loaded, and\r\nthrow their entire weight upon the spokes on one side, when he found that\r\nthe waggon could thus be easily propelled forward without the wheels\r\nslipping.  This, together with other experiments, satisfied him of the\r\nexpediency of adopting smooth wheels on his engine, and it was so\r\nfinished accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe engine was, after much labour and anxiety, and frequent alterations\r\nof parts, at length brought to completion, having been about ten months\r\nin hand.  It was placed upon the Killingworth Railway on the 25th July,\r\n1814; and its powers were tried on the same day.  On an ascending\r\ngradient of 1 in 450, the engine succeeded in drawing after it eight\r\nloaded carriages of thirty tons' weight at about four miles an hour; and\r\nfor some time after it continued regularly at work.\r\n\r\nAlthough a considerable advance upon previous locomotives, \"Blutcher\" (as\r\nthe engine was popularly called) was nevertheless a somewhat cumbrous and\r\nclumsy machine.  The parts were huddled together.  The boiler constituted\r\nthe principal feature; and being the foundation of the other parts, it\r\nwas made to do duty not only as a generator of steam, but also as a basis\r\nfor the fixings of the machinery and for the bearings of the wheels and\r\naxles.  The want of springs was seriously felt; and the progress of the\r\nengine was a succession of jolts, causing considerable derangement to the\r\nmachinery.  The mode of communicating the motive power to the wheels by\r\nmeans of the spur-gear also caused frequent jerks, each cylinder\r\nalternately propelling or becoming propelled by the other, as the\r\npressure of the one upon the wheels became greater or less than the\r\npressure of the other; and when the teeth of the cogwheels became at all\r\nworn, a rattling noise was produced during the travelling of the engine.\r\n\r\nAs the principal test of the success of the locomotive was its economy as\r\ncompared with horse power, careful calculations were made with the view\r\nof ascertaining this important point.  The result was, that it was found\r\nthe working of the engine was at first barely economical; and at the end\r\nof the year the steam power and the horse power were ascertained to be as\r\nnearly as possible upon a par in point of cost.  The fate of the\r\nlocomotive in a great measure depended on this very engine.  Its speed\r\nwas not beyond that of a horse's walk, and the heating surface presented\r\nto the fire being comparatively small, sufficient steam could not be\r\nraised to enable it to accomplish more on an average than about four\r\nmiles an hour.  The result was anything but decisive; and the locomotive\r\nmight have been condemned as useless, had not our engineer at this\r\njuncture applied the steam-blast, and by its means carried his experiment\r\nto a triumphant issue.\r\n\r\nThe steam, after performing its duty in the cylinders, was at first\r\nallowed to escape into the open atmosphere with a hissing blast, to the\r\nterror of horses and cattle.  It was complained of as a nuisance; and an\r\naction at law against the colliery lessees was threatened unless it was\r\nstopped.  Stephenson's attention had been drawn to the much greater\r\nvelocity with which the steam issued from the exit pipe compared with\r\nthat at which the smoke escaped from the chimney.  He conceived that, by\r\nconveying the eduction steam into the chimney, by means of a small pipe,\r\nafter it had performed its office in the cylinders, allowing it to escape\r\nin a vertical direction, its velocity would be imparted to the smoke from\r\nthe fire, or to the ascending current of air in the chimney, thereby\r\nincreasing the draft, and consequently the intensity of combustion in the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was no sooner made than the power of the engine was at\r\nonce more than doubled; combustion was stimulated by the blast;\r\nconsequently the capability of the boiler to generate steam was greatly\r\nincreased, and the effective power of the engine augmented in precisely\r\nthe same proportion, without in any way adding to its weight.  This\r\nsimple but beautiful expedient was really fraught with the most important\r\nconsequences to railway communication; and it is not too much to say that\r\nthe success of the locomotive has in a great measure been the result of\r\nits adoption.  Without the steam-blast, by means of which the intensity\r\nof combustion is maintained at its highest point, producing a\r\ncorrespondingly rapid evolution of steam, high rates of speed could not\r\nhave been kept up; the advantages of the multi-tubular boiler (afterwards\r\ninvented) could never have been fairly tested; and locomotives might\r\nstill have been dragging themselves unwieldily along at little more than\r\nfive or six miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe steam-blast had scarcely been adopted, with so decided a success,\r\nwhen Stephenson, observing the numerous defects in his engine, and\r\nprofiting by the experience which he had already acquired, determined to\r\nconstruct a second engine, in which to embody his improvements in their\r\nbest form.  Careful and cautious observation of the working of his\r\nlocomotive had convinced him that the complication arising out of the\r\naction of the two cylinders being combined by spur-wheels would prevent\r\nits coming into practical use.  He accordingly directed his attention to\r\nan entire change in the construction and mechanical arrangements of the\r\nmachine; and in the following year, conjointly with Mr. Dodds, who\r\nprovided the necessary funds, he took out a patent, dated the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1815, for an engine which combined in a remarkable degree the\r\nessential requisites of an economical locomotive; that is to say, few\r\nparts, simplicity in their action, and directness in the mode by which\r\nthe power was communicated to the wheels supporting the engine.\r\n\r\nThis locomotive, like the first, had two vertical cylinders, which\r\ncommunicated _directly_ with each pair of the four wheels that supported\r\nthe engine, by means of a cross head and a pair of connecting rods.  But\r\nin attempting to establish a direct communication between the cylinders\r\nand the wheels that rolled upon the rails, considerable difficulties\r\npresented themselves.  The ordinary joints could not be employed to unite\r\nthe parts of the engine, which was a rigid mass, with the wheels lolling\r\nupon the irregular surface of the rails; for it was evident that the two\r\nrails of the line of way--more especially in those early days of\r\nimperfect construction of the permanent road--could not always be\r\nmaintained at the same level,--that the wheel at one end of the axle\r\nmight be depressed into one part of the line which had subsided, whilst\r\nthe other wheel would be comparatively elevated; and in such a position\r\nof the axle and wheels, it was obvious that a rigid communication between\r\nthe cross head and the wheels was impracticable.  Hence it became\r\nnecessary to form a joint at the top of the piston-rod where it united\r\nwith the cross head, so as to permit the cross head to preserve complete\r\nparallelism with the axle of the wheels with which it was in\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain that degree of flexibility combined with direct\r\naction, which was essential for ensuring power and avoiding needless\r\nfriction and jars from irregularities in the road, Stephenson made use of\r\nthe \"ball and socket\" joint for effecting a union between the ends of the\r\ncross heads where they united with the connecting rods, and between the\r\nends of the connecting rods where they were united with the crank-pins\r\nattached to each driving-wheel.  By this arrangement the parallelism\r\nbetween the cross head and the axle was at all times maintained and\r\npreserved, without producing any serious jar or friction on any part of\r\nthe machine.  Another important point was, to combine each pair of wheels\r\nby means of some simple mechanism instead of by the cogwheels which had\r\nformerly been used.  And, with this object, Stephenson made cranks in\r\neach axle at right angles to each other, with rods communicating\r\nhorizontally between them.\r\n\r\nA locomotive was constructed upon this plan in 1815, and was found to\r\nanswer extremely well.  But at that period the mechanical skill of the\r\ncountry was not equal to forging cranked axles of the soundness and\r\nstrength necessary to stand the jars incident to locomotive work.\r\nStephenson was accordingly compelled to fall back upon a substitute,\r\nwhich, although less simple and efficient, was within the mechanical\r\ncapabilities of the workmen of that day, in respect of construction as\r\nwell as repair.  He adopted a chain which rolled over indented wheels\r\nplaced on the centre of each axle, and was so arranged that the two pairs\r\nof wheels were effectually coupled and made to keep pace with each other.\r\nThe chain, however, after a few years' use, became stretched; and then\r\nthe engines were liable to irregularity in their working, especially in\r\nchanging from working back to working forward again.  Eventually the\r\nchain was laid aside, and the front and hind wheels were united by rods\r\non the outside, instead of by rods and crank axles inside, as specified\r\nin the original patent.  This expedient completely answered the purpose\r\nrequired, without involving any expensive or difficult workmanship.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1815, by dint of patient and persevering labour,--by careful\r\nobservation of the works of others, and never neglecting to avail himself\r\nof their suggestions,--Stephenson succeeded in manufacturing an engine\r\nwhich included the following important improvements on all previous\r\nattempts in the same direction:--viz., simple and direct communication\r\nbetween the cylinders and the wheels rolling upon the rails; joint\r\nadhesion of all the wheels, attained by the use of horizontal\r\nconnecting-rods; and finally, a beautiful method of exciting the\r\ncombustion of the fuel by employing the waste steam, which had formerly\r\nbeen allowed to escape uselessly into the air.  Although many\r\nimprovements in detail were afterwards introduced in the locomotive by\r\nGeorge Stephenson himself, as well as by his equally distinguished son,\r\nit is perhaps not too much to say that this engine, as a mechanical\r\ncontrivance, contained the germ of all that has since been effected.  It\r\nmay in fact be regarded as the type of the present locomotive engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nINVENTION OF THE \"GEORDY\" SAFETY-LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplosions of fire-damp were unusually frequent in the coal mines of\r\nNorthumberland and Durham about the time when George Stephenson was\r\nengaged in the construction of his first locomotives.  These explosions\r\nwere often attended with fearful loss of life and dreadful suffering to\r\nthe workpeople.  Killingworth Colliery was not free from such deplorable\r\ncalamities; and during the time that Stephenson was employed as a\r\nbrakesman at the West Moor, several \"blasts\" took place in the pit, by\r\nwhich many workmen were scorched and killed, and the owners of the\r\ncolliery sustained heavy losses.  One of the most serious of these\r\naccidents occurred in 1806, not long after he had been appointed\r\nbrakesman, by which 10 persons were killed.  Stephenson was working at\r\nthe mouth of the pit at the time, and the circumstances connected with\r\nthe accident made a deep impression on his mind.\r\n\r\nAnother explosion took place in the same pit in 1809, by which 12 persons\r\nlost their lives.  The blast did not reach the shaft as in the former\r\ncase; the unfortunate persons in the pit having been suffocated by the\r\nafter-damp.  More calamitous still were the explosions which took place\r\nin the neighbouring collieries; one of the worst being that of 1812, in\r\nthe Felling Pit, near Gateshead, by which no fewer than 90 men and boys\r\nwere suffocated or burnt to death.  And a similar accident occurred in\r\nthe same pit in the year following, by which 22 persons perished.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that George Stephenson should devote his attention to the\r\ncauses of these deplorable accidents, and to the means by which they\r\nmight if possible be prevented.  His daily occupation led him to think\r\nmuch and deeply on the subject.  As engine-wright of a colliery so\r\nextensive as that of Killingworth, where there were nearly 160 miles of\r\ngallery excavation, in which he personally superintended the working of\r\nthe inclined planes along which the coals were sent to the pit entrance,\r\nhe was necessarily very often underground, and brought face to face with\r\nthe dangers of fire-damp.  From fissures in the roofs of the galleries,\r\ncarburetted hydrogen gas was constantly flowing; in some of the more\r\ndangerous places it might be heard escaping from the crevices of the coal\r\nwith a hissing noise.  Ventilation, firing, and all conceivable modes of\r\ndrawing out the foul air had been adopted, and the more dangerous parts\r\nof the galleries were built up.  Still the danger could not be wholly\r\nprevented.  The miners must necessarily guide their steps through the\r\nextensive underground ways with lighted lamps or candles, the naked flame\r\nof which, coming in contact with the inflammable air, daily exposed them\r\nand their fellow-workers in the pit to the risk of death in one of its\r\nmost dreadful forms.\r\n\r\nOne day, in 1814, a workman hurried into Stephenson's cottage with the\r\nstartling information that the deepest main of the colliery was on fire!\r\nHe immediately hastened to the pit-head, about a hundred yards off,\r\nwhither the women and children of the colliery were running, with\r\nwildness and terror depicted in every face.  In a commanding voice\r\nStephenson ordered the engineman to lower him down the shaft in the\r\ncorve.  There was peril, it might be death, before him, but he must go.\r\n\r\nHe was soon at the bottom, and in the midst of the men, who were\r\nparalysed by the danger which threatened the lives of all in the pit.\r\nLeaping from the corve on its touching the ground, he called out; \"Are\r\nthere six men among you who have courage to follow me?  If so, come, and\r\nwe will put the fire out.\"  The Killingworth pitmen had the most perfect\r\nconfidence in their engine-wright, and they readily volunteered to follow\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: The Pit Head, West Moor]\r\n\r\nSilence succeeded the frantic tumult of the previous minute, and the men\r\nset to work with a will.  In every mine, bricks, mortar, and tools enough\r\nare at hand, and by Stephenson's direction the materials were forthwith\r\ncarried to the required spot, where, in a very short time a wall was\r\nraised at the entrance to the main, he himself taking the most active\r\npart in the work.  The atmospheric air was by this means excluded, the\r\nfire was extinguished, the people were saved from death, and the mine was\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote of Stephenson was related to the writer, near the\r\npit-mouth, by one of the men who had been present and helped to build up\r\nthe brick wall by which the fire was stayed, though several workmen were\r\nsuffocated.  He related that, when down the pit some days after, seeking\r\nout the dead bodies, the cause of the accident was the subject of\r\nconversation, and Stephenson was asked, \"Can nothing be done to prevent\r\nsuch awful occurrences?\"  His reply was that he thought something might\r\nbe done.  \"Then,\" said the other, \"the sooner you start the better; for\r\nthe price of coal-mining now is _pitmen's lives_.\"\r\n\r\nFifty years since, many of the best pits were so full of the inflammable\r\ngas given forth by the coal, that they could not be worked without the\r\ngreatest danger; and for this reason some were altogether abandoned, The\r\nrudest possible methods were adopted of producing light sufficient to\r\nenable the pitmen to work by.  The phosphorescence of decayed fish-skins\r\nwas tried; but this, though safe, was very inefficient.  The most common\r\nmethod employed was what was called a steel mill, the notched wheel of\r\nwhich, being made to revolve against a flint, struck a succession of\r\nsparks, which scarcely served to do more than make the darkness visible.\r\nA boy carried the apparatus after the miner, working the wheel, and by\r\nthe imperfect light thus given forth he plied his dangerous trade.\r\nCandles were only used in those parts of the pit where gas was not\r\nabundant.  Under this rude system not more than one-third of the coal\r\ncould be worked; and two-thirds were left.\r\n\r\nWhat the workmen, not less than the coal-owners, eagerly desired was, a\r\nlamp that should give forth sufficient light, without communicating flame\r\nto the inflammable gas which accumulated in certain parts of the pit.\r\nSomething had already been attempted towards the invention of such a lamp\r\nby Dr. Clanny, of Sunderland, who, in 1813, contrived an apparatus to\r\nwhich he gave air from the mine through water, by means of bellows.  This\r\nlamp went out of itself in inflammable gas.  It was found, however, too\r\nunwieldy to be used by the miners for the purposes of their work, and did\r\nnot come into general use.  A committee of gentlemen was formed to\r\ninvestigate the causes of the explosions, and to devise, if possible,\r\nsome means of preventing them.  At the invitation of that Committee, Sir\r\nHumphry Davy, then in the full zenith of his reputation, was requested to\r\nturn his attention to the subject.  He accordingly visited the collieries\r\nnear Newcastle on the 24th of August, 1815; and on the 9th of November\r\nfollowing, he read before the Royal Society of London his celebrated\r\npaper \"On the Fire-Damp of Coal Mines, and on Methods of lighting the\r\nMine so as to prevent its explosion.\"\r\n\r\nBut a humbler though not less diligent and original thinker had been at\r\nwork before him, and had already practically solved the problem of the\r\nSafety-Lamp.  Stephenson was of course well aware of the anxiety which\r\nprevailed in the colliery districts as to the invention of a lamp which\r\nshould give light enough for the miners to work by without exploding the\r\nfire-damp.  The painful incidents above described only served to quicken\r\nhis eagerness to master the difficulty.\r\n\r\nFor several years he had been engaged, in his own rude way, in making\r\nexperiments with the fire-damp in the Killingworth mine.  The pitmen used\r\nto expostulate with him on these occasions, believing his experiments to\r\nbe fraught with danger.  One of the sinkers, observing him holding up\r\nlighted candles to the windward of the \"blower\" or fissure from which the\r\ninflammable gas escaped, entreated him to desist; but Stephenson's answer\r\nwas, that \"he was busy with a plan by which he hoped to make his\r\nexperiments useful for preserving men's lives.\"  On these occasions the\r\nminers usually got out of the way before he lit the gas.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, although he was very much occupied with the business of the\r\ncollieries and the improvement of his locomotive engine, he was also\r\nbusily engaged in making experiments upon inflammable gas in the\r\nKillingworth pit.  According to the explanation afterwards given by him,\r\nhe imagined that if he could construct a lamp with a chimney so arranged\r\nas to cause a strong current, it would not fire at the top of the\r\nchimney; as the burnt air would ascend with such a velocity as to prevent\r\nthe inflammable air of the pit from descending towards the flame; and\r\nsuch a lamp, he thought, might be taken into a dangerous atmosphere\r\nwithout risk of exploding.\r\n\r\nSuch was Stephenson's theory when he proceeded to embody his idea of a\r\nminer's safety-lamp in a practical form.  In the month of August, 1815,\r\nhe requested his friend Nicholas Wood, the head viewer, to prepare a\r\ndrawing of a lamp according to the description which he gave him.  After\r\nseveral evenings' careful deliberations, the drawing was made, and shown\r\nto several of the head men about the works.\r\n\r\nStephenson proceeded to order a lamp to be made by a Newcastle tinman,\r\naccording to his plan; and at the same time he directed a glass to be\r\nmade for the lamp at the Northumberland Glass House.  Both were received\r\nby him from the makers on the 21st October, and the lamp was taken to\r\nKillingworth for the purpose of immediate experiment.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that evening as distinctly as if it had been but yesterday,\"\r\nsaid Robert Stephenson, describing the circumstances to the author in\r\n1857: \"Moodie came to our cottage about dusk, and asked, 'if father had\r\ngot back yet with the lamp?'  'No.'  'Then I'll wait till he comes,' said\r\nMoodie, 'he can't be long now.'  In about half-an-hour, in came my\r\nfather, his face all radiant.  He had the lamp with him!  It was at once\r\nuncovered, and shown to Moodie.  Then it was filled with oil, trimmed,\r\nand lighted.  All was ready, only the head viewer hadn't arrived.  'Run\r\nover to Benton for Nichol, Robert,' said my father to me, 'and ask him to\r\ncome directly; say we're going down the pit to try the lamp.'  By this\r\ntime it was quite dark; and off I ran to bring Nicholas Wood.  His house\r\nwas at Benton, about a mile off.  There was a short cut through the\r\nChurchyard, but just as I was about to pass the wicket, I saw what I\r\nthought was a white figure moving about amongst the grave-stones.  I took\r\nit for a ghost!  My heart fluttered, and I was in a great fright, but to\r\nWood's house I must get, so I made the circuit of the Churchyard; and\r\nwhen I got round to the other side I looked, and lo! the figure was still\r\nthere.  But what do you think it was?  Only the grave-digger, plying his\r\nwork at that late hour by the light of his lanthorn set upon one of the\r\ngravestones!  I found Wood at home, and in a few minutes he was mounted\r\nand off to my father's.  When I got back, I was told they had just\r\nleft--it was then about eleven--and gone down the shaft to try the lamp\r\nin one of the most dangerous parts of the mine.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at the bottom of the shaft with the lamp, the party directed\r\ntheir steps towards one of the foulest galleries in the pit, where the\r\nexplosive gas was issuing through a blower in the roof of the mine with a\r\nloud hissing noise.  By erecting some deal boarding round that part of\r\nthe gallery into which the gas was escaping, the air was made more foul\r\nfor the purpose of the experiment.  After waiting about an hour, Moodie,\r\nwhose practical experience of fire-damp in pits was greater than that of\r\neither Stephenson or Wood, was requested to go into the place which had\r\nthus been made foul; and, having done so, he returned, and told them that\r\nthe smell of the air was such, that if a lighted candle were now\r\nintroduced, an explosion must inevitably take place.  He cautioned\r\nStephenson as to the danger both to themselves and to the pit, if the gas\r\ntook fire.  But Stephenson declared his confidence in the safety of his\r\nlamp, and, having lit the wick, he boldly proceeded with it towards the\r\nexplosive air.  The others, more timid and doubtful, hung back when they\r\ncame within hearing of the blower; and apprehensive of the danger, they\r\nretired into a safe place, out of sight of the lamp, which gradually\r\ndisappeared with its bearer in the recesses of the mine. {95}\r\n\r\nAdvancing to the place of danger, and entering within the fouled air, his\r\nlighted lamp in hand, Stephenson held it finally out, in the full current\r\nof the blower, and within a few inches of its mouth.  Thus exposed, the\r\nflame of the lamp at first increased, then flickered, and then went out;\r\nbut there was no explosion of the gas.  Returning to his companions, who\r\nwere still at a distance, he told them what had occurred.  Having now\r\nacquired somewhat more confidence, they advanced with him to a point from\r\nwhich they could observe him repeat his experiment, but still at a safe\r\ndistance.  They saw that when the lighted lamp was held within the\r\nexplosive mixture, there was a great flame; the lamp became almost full\r\nof fire; and then it smothered out.  Again returning to his companions,\r\nhe relighted the lamp, and repeated the experiment several times with the\r\nsame result.  At length Wood and Moodie ventured to advance close to the\r\nfouled part of the pit; and, in making some of the later trials, Mr. Wood\r\nhimself held up the lighted lamp to the blower.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the pit, Stephenson expressed his opinion that by an\r\nalteration of the lamp which he then contemplated, he could make it burn\r\nbetter; this was by a change in the slide through which the air was\r\nadmitted into the lower part, under the flame.  After making some\r\nexperiments on the air collected at the blower, by bladders which were\r\nmounted with tubes of various diameters, he satisfied himself that, when\r\nthe tube was reduced to a certain diameter, the foul air would not pass\r\nthrough; and he fashioned his slide accordingly, reducing the diameter of\r\nthe tube until he conceived it was quite safe.  In about a fortnight the\r\nexperiments were repeated, in a place purposely made foul as before; on\r\nthis occasion a larger number of persons ventured to witness them, and\r\nthey again proved successful.  The lamp was not yet, however, so\r\nefficient as the inventor desired.  It required, he observed, to be kept\r\nvery steady when burning in the inflammable gas, otherwise it was liable\r\nto go out, in consequence, as he imagined, of the contact of the burnt\r\nair (as he then called it), or azotic gas, which lodged round the\r\nexterior of the flame.  If the lamp was moved horizontally, the azote\r\ncame in contact with the flame and extinguished it.  \"It struck me,\" said\r\nhe, \"that if I put more tubes in, I should discharge the poisonous matter\r\nthat hung round the flame, by admitting the air to its exterior part.\"\r\nAlthough he had then no access to scientific books, nor intercourse with\r\nscientific men, nor anything that could assist him in his investigation,\r\nbesides his own indefatigable spirit of inquiry, he contrived a rude\r\napparatus by which he tested the explosive properties of the gas and the\r\nvelocity of current (for this was the direction of his inquiries)\r\nnecessary to enable the explosive gas to pass through tubes of different\r\ndiameters.  In making these experiments in his humble cottage at the West\r\nMoor, Nicholas Wood and George's son Robert usually acted as his\r\nassistants, and sometimes the gentlemen of the neighbourhood interested\r\nin coal-mining attended as spectators.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were not performed without risk, for on one occasion\r\nthe experimenting party had nearly blown off the roof of the cottage.\r\nOne of these \"blows up\" was described by Stephenson himself before the\r\nCommittee on Accidents in Coal Mines, in 1835: \"I made several\r\nexperiments,\" said he, \"as to the velocity required in tubes of different\r\ndiameters, to prevent explosion from fire-damp.  We made the mixtures in\r\nall proportions of light carburetted hydrogen with atmospheric air in the\r\nreceiver, and we found by the experiments that when a current of the most\r\nexplosive mixture that we could make was forced up a tube 4/10 of an inch\r\nin diameter, the necessary current was 9 inches in a second to prevent\r\nits coming down that tube.  These experiments were repeated several\r\ntimes.  We had two or three blows up in making the experiments, by the\r\nflame getting down into the receiver, though we had a piece of very fine\r\nwire-gauze put at the bottom of the pipe, between the receiver and the\r\npipe through which we were forcing the current.  In one of these\r\nexperiments I was watching the flame in the tube, my son was taking the\r\nvibrations of the pendulum of the clock, and Mr. Wood was attending to\r\ngive me the column of water as I called for it, to keep the current up to\r\na certain point.  As I saw the flame descending in the tube I called for\r\nmore water, and Wood unfortunately turned the cock the wrong way, the\r\ncurrent ceased, the flame went down the tube, and all our implements were\r\nblown to pieces, which at the time we were not very able to replace.\"\r\n\r\nStephenson followed up those experiments by others of a similar kind,\r\nwith the view of ascertaining whether ordinary flame would pass through\r\ntubes of a small diameter and with this object he filed off the barrels\r\nof several small keys.  Placing these together, he held them\r\nperpendicularly over a strong flame, and ascertained that it did not pass\r\nupward.  This was a further proof to him of the soundness of the course\r\nhe was pursuing.\r\n\r\nIn order to correct the defect of his first lamp he resolved to alter it\r\nso as to admit the air to the flame by several tubes of reduced diameter,\r\ninstead of by a single tube.  He inferred that a sufficient quantity of\r\nair would thus be introduced into the lamp for the purposes of\r\ncombustion, while the smallness of the apertures would still prevent the\r\nexplosive gas passing downwards, at the same time that the \"burnt air\"\r\n(the cause, in his opinion, of the lamp going out) would be more\r\neffectually dislodged.  He accordingly took the lamp to a tinman in\r\nNewcastle, and had it altered so that the air was admitted by three small\r\ntubes inserted in the bottom of the lamp, the openings of which were\r\nplaced on the outside of the burner, instead of having (as in the\r\noriginal lamp) the one tube opening directly under the flame.\r\n\r\nThis second or altered lamp was tried in the Killingworth pit on the 4th\r\nNovember, and was found to burn better than the first, and to be\r\nperfectly safe.  But as it did not yet come quite up to the inventor's\r\nexpectations, he proceeded to contrive a third lamp, in which he proposed\r\nto surround the oil vessel with a number of capillary tubes.  Then it\r\nstruck him, that if he cut off the middle of the tubes, or made holes in\r\nmetal plates, placed at a distance from each other, equal to the length\r\nof the tubes, the air would get in better, and the effect in preventing\r\nexplosion would be the same.\r\n\r\nHe was encouraged to persevere in the completion of his safety-lamp by\r\nthe occurrence of several fatal accidents about this time in the\r\nKillingworth pit.  On the 9th November a boy was killed by a blast in the\r\n_A_ pit, at the very place where Stephenson had made the experiments with\r\nhis first lamp; and, when told of the accident, he observed that if the\r\nboy had been provided with his lamp, his life would have been saved.  On\r\nthe 20th November he went over to Newcastle to order his third lamp from\r\na plumber in that town.  The plumber referred him to his clerk, whom\r\nStephenson invited to join him at a neighbouring public-house, where they\r\nmight quietly talk over the matter, and finally settle the plan of the\r\nnew lamp.  They adjourned to the \"Newcastle Arms,\" near the present High\r\nLevel Bridge, where they had some ale, and a design of the lamp was drawn\r\nin pencil upon a half-sheet of foolscap, with a rough specification\r\nsubjoined.  The sketch, when shown to us by Robert Stephenson some years\r\nsince, still bore the marks of the ale.  It was a very rude design, but\r\nsufficient to work from.  It was immediately placed in the hands of the\r\nworkmen, finished in the course of a few days, and experimentally tested\r\nin the Killingworth pit like the previous lamps, on the 30th November.\r\nAt that time neither Stephenson nor Wood had heard of Sir Humphry Davy's\r\nexperiments nor of the lamp which that gentleman proposed to construct.\r\n\r\nAn angry controversy afterwards took place as to the respective merits of\r\nGeorge Stephenson and Sir Humphry Davy in respect of the invention of the\r\nsafety-lamp.  A committee was formed on both sides, and the facts were\r\nstated in various ways.  It is perfectly clear, however, that Stephenson\r\nhad ascertained _the fact_ that flame will not pass through tubes of a\r\ncertain diameter--the principle on which the safety-lamp is\r\nconstructed--before Sir Humphry Davy had formed any definite idea on the\r\nsubject, or invented the model lamp afterwards exhibited by him before\r\nthe Royal Society.  Stephenson had actually constructed a lamp on such a\r\nprinciple, and proved its safety, before Sir Humphry had communicated his\r\nviews on the subject to any person; and by the time that the first public\r\nintimation had been given of his discovery, Stephenson's second lamp had\r\nbeen constructed and tested in like manner in the Killingworth pit.  The\r\n_first_ was tried on the 21st October, 1815; the _second_ was tried on\r\nthe 4th November; but it was not until the 9th November that Sir Humphry\r\nDavy presented his first lamp to the public.  And by the 30th of the same\r\nmonth, as we have seen, Stephenson had constructed and tested his _third_\r\nsafety-lamp.\r\n\r\n             [Picture: Davy's and Stephenson's Safety Lamps]\r\n\r\nStephenson's theory of the \"burnt air\" and the \"draught\" was no doubt\r\nwrong; but his lamp was right, and that was the great fact which mainly\r\nconcerned him.  Torricelli did not know the rationale of his tube, nor\r\nOtto Gurike that of his air-pump; yet no one thinks of denying them the\r\nmerit of their inventions on that account.  The discoveries of Volta and\r\nGalvani were in like manner independent of theory; the greatest\r\ndiscoveries consisting in bringing to light certain grand facts, on which\r\ntheories are afterwards framed.  Our inventor had been pursuing the\r\nBaconian method, though he did not think of that, but of inventing a safe\r\nlamp, which he knew could only be done through the process of repeated\r\nexperiment.  He experimented upon the fire-damp at the blowers in the\r\nmine, and also by means of the apparatus which was blown up in his\r\ncottage, as above described by himself.  By experiment he distinctly\r\nascertained that the explosion of fire-damp could not pass through small\r\ntubes; and he also did what had not before been done by any inventor--he\r\nconstructed a lamp on this principle, and repeatedly proved its safety at\r\nthe risk of his life.  At the same time, there is no doubt that it was to\r\nSir Humphry Davy that the merit belonged of having pointed out the true\r\nlaw on which the safety-lamp is constructed.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this important invention excited so much interest in the\r\nnorthern mining districts, and Stephenson's numerous friends considered\r\nhis lamp so completely successful--having stood the test of repeated\r\nexperiments--that they urged him to bring his invention before the\r\nPhilosophical and Literary Society of Newcastle, of whose apparatus he\r\nhad availed himself in the course of his experiments on fire-damp.  After\r\nmuch persuasion he consented, and a meeting was appointed for the purpose\r\nof receiving his explanations, on the evening of the 5th December, 1815.\r\nStephenson was at that time so diffident in manner and unpractised in\r\nspeech, that he took with him his friend Nicholas Wood, to act as his\r\ninterpreter and expositor on the occasion.  From eighty to a hundred of\r\nthe most intelligent members of the society were present at the meeting,\r\nwhen Mr. Wood stood forward to expound the principles on which the lamp\r\nhad been formed, and to describe the details of its construction.\r\nSeveral questions were put, to which Mr. Wood proceeded to give replies\r\nto the best of his knowledge.  But Stephenson, who up to that time had\r\nstood behind Wood, screened from notice, observing that the explanations\r\ngiven were not quite correct, could no longer control his reserve, and,\r\nstanding forward, he proceeded in his strong Northumbrian dialect, to\r\ndescribe the lamp, down to its minutest details.  He then produced\r\nseveral bladders full of carburetted hydrogen, which he had collected\r\nfrom the blowers in the Killingworth mine, and proved the safety of his\r\nlamp by numerous experiments with the gas, repeated in various ways; his\r\nearnest and impressive manner exciting in the minds of his auditors the\r\nliveliest interest both in the inventor and his invention.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Sir H. Davy's model lamp was received and exhibited to the\r\ncoal-miners at Newcastle, on which occasion the observation was made by\r\nseveral gentlemen, \"Why, it is the same as Stephenson's!\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Stephenson's claim to be regarded as the first inventor\r\nof the Tube Safety-lamp, his merits do not seem to have been generally\r\nrecognised; and Sir Humphry Davy carried off the larger share of the\r\n_eclat_ which attached to the discovery.  What chance had the unknown\r\nworkman of Killingworth with so distinguished a competitor?  The one was\r\nas yet but a colliery engine-wright, scarce raised above the\r\nmanual-labour class, pursuing his experiments in obscurity, with a view\r\nonly to usefulness; the other was the scientific prodigy of his day, the\r\nmost brilliant of lecturers, and the most popular of philosophers.\r\n\r\nNo small indignation was expressed by the friends of Sir Humphry Davy at\r\nStephenson's \"presumption\" in laying claim to the invention of the\r\nsafety-lamp.  In 1831 Dr. Paris, in his 'Life of Sir Humphry Davy,' thus\r\nwrote:--\"It will hereafter be scarcely believed that an invention so\r\neminently scientific, and which could never have been derived but from\r\nthe sterling treasury of science, should have been claimed on behalf of\r\nan engine-wright of Killingworth, of the name of Stephenson--a person not\r\neven possessing a knowledge of the elements of chemistry.\"\r\n\r\nBut Stephenson was far above claiming for himself any invention not his\r\nown.  He had already accomplished a far greater feat than the making of a\r\nsafety-lamp--he had constructed a successful locomotive, which was to be\r\nseen in daily work on the Killingworth railway.  By the improvements he\r\nhad made in the engine, he might almost be said to have _invented_ it;\r\nbut no one--not even the philosophers--detected the significance of that\r\nwonderful machine.  What railways were to become, rested in a great\r\nmeasure with that \"engine-wright of Killingworth, of the name of\r\nStephenson,\" though he was scarcely known as yet beyond the bounds of his\r\nown district.\r\n\r\nAs to the value of the invention of the safety-lamp there could be no\r\ndoubt; and the colliery owners of Durham and Northumberland, to testify\r\ntheir sense of its importance, determined to present a testimonial to its\r\ninventor.  The friends of Sir H. Davy met in August, 1816, to take steps\r\nfor raising a subscription for the purpose.  The advertised object of the\r\nmeeting was to present him with a reward for \"the invention of _his_\r\nsafety-lamp.\"  To this no objection could be taken; for though the\r\nprinciple on which the safety-lamps of Stephenson and Davy were\r\nconstructed was the same; and although Stephenson's lamp was,\r\nunquestionably, the first successful lamp that had been constructed on\r\nsuch principle, and proved to be efficient,--yet Sir H. Davy did invent a\r\nsafety-lamp, no doubt quite independent of all that Stephenson had done;\r\nand having directed his careful attention to the subject, and elucidated\r\nthe true theory of explosion of carburetted hydrogen, he was entitled to\r\nall praise and reward for his labours.  But when the meeting of\r\ncoal-owners proposed to raise a subscription for the purpose of\r\npresenting Sir H. Davy with a reward for \"his invention of _the_\r\nsafety-lamp,\" the case was entirely altered; and Stephenson's friends\r\nthen proceeded to assert his claims to be regarded as its first inventor.\r\n\r\nMany meetings took place on the subject, and much discussion ensued, the\r\nresult of which was that a sum of 2000 pounds was presented to Sir\r\nHumphry Davy as \"the inventor of the safety-lamp;\" but, at the same time,\r\na purse of 100 guineas was voted to George Stephenson, in consideration\r\nof what he had done in the same direction.  This result was, however very\r\nunsatisfactory to Stephenson, as well as to his friends, and Mr.\r\nBrandling, of Gosforth, suggested to him that, the subject being now\r\nfairly before the public, he should publish a statement of the facts on\r\nwhich his claim was founded.\r\n\r\nThis was not at all in George's line.  He had never appeared in print;\r\nand it seemed to him a more formidable thing to write a letter for \"the\r\npapers\" than to invent a safety-lamp or design a locomotive.  However, he\r\ncalled to his aid his son Robert, set him down before a sheet of\r\nfoolscap, and told him to \"put down there just what I tell you.\"  The\r\ncomposition of this letter, as we were informed by the writer of it,\r\noccupied more evenings than one; and when it was at length finished,\r\nafter many corrections, and fairly copied out, the father and son set\r\nout--the latter dressed in his Sunday's round jacket--to lay the joint\r\nproduction before Mr. Brandling, at Gosforth House.  Glancing over the\r\nletter, Mr. Brandling said, \"George, this will never do.\"  \"It is all\r\ntrue, sir,\" was the reply.  \"That may be; but it is badly written.\"\r\nRobert blushed, for he thought the penmanship was called in question, and\r\nhe had written his best.  Mr. Brandling, however, revised the letter,\r\nwhich was shortly after published in the local journals.\r\n\r\nStephenson's friends, fully satisfied of his claims to priority as the\r\ninventor of the safety-lamp used in the Killingworth and other\r\ncollieries, held a public meeting for the purpose of presenting him with\r\na reward \"for the valuable service he had thus rendered to mankind.\"  A\r\nsubscription was immediately commenced with this object, and a committee\r\nwas formed, consisting of the Earl of Strathmore, C. J. Brandling, and\r\nothers.  The subscriptions, when collected, amounted to 1000 pounds.\r\nPart of the money was devoted to the purchase of a silver tankard, which\r\nwas presented to the inventor, together with the balance of the\r\nsubscription, at a public dinner given in the Assembly Rooms at\r\nNewcastle. {105}  But what gave Stephenson even greater pleasure than the\r\nsilver tankard and purse of sovereigns was the gift of a silver watch,\r\npurchased by small subscriptions amongst the colliers themselves, and\r\npresented by them as a token of their personal esteem and regard for him,\r\nas well as of their gratitude for the perseverance and skill with which\r\nhe had prosecuted his valuable and lifesaving invention to a successful\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nHowever great the merits of Stephenson in connexion with the invention of\r\nthe tube safety-lamp, they cannot be regarded as detracting from the\r\nreputation of Sir Humphry Davy.  His inquiries into the explosive\r\nproperties of carburetted hydrogen gas were quite original; and his\r\ndiscovery of the fact that explosion will not pass through tubes of a\r\ncertain diameter was made independently of all that Stephenson had done\r\nin verification of the same fact.  It even appears that Mr. Smithson\r\nTennant and Dr. Wollaston had observed the same fact several years\r\nbefore, though neither Stephenson nor Davy knew it while they were\r\nprosecuting their experiments.  Sir Humphry Davy's subsequent\r\nmodification of the tube-lamp, by which, while diminishing the diameter,\r\nhe in the same ratio shortened the tubes without danger, and in the form\r\nof wire-gauze enveloped the safety-lamp by a multiplicity of tubes, was a\r\nbeautiful application of the true theory which he had formed upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe increased number of accidents which have occurred from explosions in\r\ncoal-mines since the general introduction of the Davy lamp, have led to\r\nconsiderable doubts as to its safety, and to inquiries as to the means by\r\nwhich it may be further improved; for experience has shown that, under\r\ncertain circumstances, the Davy lamp is _not_ safe.  Stephenson was\r\nhimself of opinion that the modification of his own and Sir Humphry\r\nDavy's lamp, combining the glass cylinder with the wire-gauze, was the\r\nmost secure; at the same time it must be admitted that the Davy and the\r\nGeordy lamps alike failed to stand the severe tests to which they were\r\nsubmitted by Dr. Pereira, before the Committee on Accidents in Mines.\r\nIndeed, Dr. Pereira did not hesitate to say, that when exposed to a\r\ncurrent of explosive gas the Davy lamp is \"decidedly unsafe,\" and that\r\nthe experiments by which its safety had been \"demonstrated\" in the\r\nlecture-room had proved entirely \"fallacious.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that under circumstances in which the wire-gauze\r\nof the Davy lamp becomes red-hot from the high explosiveness of the gas,\r\nthe Geordy lamp is extinguished; and we cannot but think that this fact\r\ntestifies to the decidedly superior safety of the Geordy.  An accident\r\noccurred in the Oaks colliery Pit at Barnsley, on the 20th August, 1857,\r\nwhich strikingly exemplified the respective qualities of the lamps.  A\r\nsudden outburst of gas took place from the floor of the mine, along a\r\ndistance of fifty yards.  Fortunately the men working in the pit at the\r\ntime were all supplied with safety-lamps--the hewers with Stephenson's,\r\nand the hurriers with Davy's.  Upon this occasion, the whole of the\r\nStephenson's lamps, over a space of five hundred yards, were extinguished\r\nalmost instantaneously; whereas the Davy lamps were filled with fire, and\r\nbecame red-hot--so much so, that several of the men using them had their\r\nhands burnt by the gauze.  Had a strong current of air been blowing\r\nthrough the gallery at the time, an explosion would most probably have\r\ntaken place--an accident which, it will be observed, could not, under\r\nsuch circumstances, occur from the use of the Geordy, which is\r\nimmediately extinguished as soon as the air becomes explosive. {107}\r\n\r\nNicholas Wood, a good judge, has said of the two inventions, \"Priority\r\nhas been claimed for each of them--I believe the inventions to be\r\nparallel.  By different roads they both arrived at the same result.\r\nStephenson's is the superior lamp.  Davy's is safe--Stephenson's is\r\nsafer.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the question of priority was under discussion at the studio of Mr.\r\nLough, the sculptor, in 1857, Sir Matthew White Ridley asked Robert\r\nStephenson, who was present, for his opinion on the subject.  His answer\r\nwas, \"I am not exactly the person to give an unbiassed opinion; but, as\r\nyou ask me frankly, I will as frankly say, that if George Stephenson had\r\nnever lived, Sir Humphry Davy could and most probably would have invented\r\nthe safety-lamp; but again, if Sir Humphry Davy had never lived, George\r\nStephenson certainly would have invented the safety-lamp, as I believe he\r\ndid, independent of all that Sir Humphry Davy had ever done in the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n                  [Picture: West Moor Pit, Killingworth]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nGEORGE STEPHENSON'S FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LOCOMOTIVE--THE HETTON\r\nRAILWAY--ROBERT STEPHENSON AS VIEWER'S APPRENTICE AND STUDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephenson's experiments on fire-damp, and his labours in connexion with\r\nthe invention of the safety-lamp, occupied but a small portion of his\r\ntime, which was necessarily devoted for the most part to the ordinary\r\nbusiness of the colliery.  From the day of his appointment as\r\nengine-wright, one of the subjects which particularly occupied his\r\nattention was the best practical method of winning and raising the coal.\r\nHe was one of the first to introduce steam machinery underground with the\r\nlatter object.  Indeed, the Killingworth mines came to be regarded as the\r\nmodels of the district; the working arrangements generally being\r\nconducted in a skilful and efficient manner, reflecting the highest\r\ncredit on the colliery engineer.\r\n\r\nBesides attending to the underground arrangements, the improved transit\r\nof the coals above-ground from the pithead to the shipping-place,\r\ndemanded an increasing share of his attention.  Every day's experience\r\nconvinced him that the locomotive constructed by him after his patent of\r\nthe year 1815, was far from perfect; though he continued to entertain\r\nconfident hopes of its eventual success.  He even went so far as to say\r\nthat the locomotive would yet supersede every other traction-power for\r\ndrawing heavy loads.  Many still regarded his travelling engine as little\r\nbetter than a curious toy; and some, shaking their heads, predicted for\r\nit \"a terrible blow-up some day.\"  Nevertheless, it was daily performing\r\nits work with regularity, dragging the coal-waggons between the colliery\r\nand the staiths, and saving the labour of many men and horses.  There was\r\nnot, however, so marked a saving in haulage as to induce the colliery\r\nmasters to adopt locomotive power generally as a substitute for horses.\r\nHow it could be improved and rendered more efficient as well as\r\neconomical, was constantly present to Stephenson's mind.\r\n\r\nAt an early period of his labours, or about the time when he had\r\ncompleted his second locomotive, he began to direct his particular\r\nattention to the state of the Road; as he perceived that the extended use\r\nof the locomotive must necessarily depend in a great measure upon the\r\nperfection, solidity, continuity, and smoothness of the way along which\r\nthe engine travelled.  Even at that early period, he was in the habit of\r\nregarding the road and the locomotive as one machine, speaking of the\r\nrail and the wheel as \"man and wife.\"\r\n\r\nAll railways were at that time laid in a careless and loose manner, and\r\ngreat inequalities of level were allowed to occur without much attention\r\nbeing paid to repairs.  The consequence was a great loss of power, as\r\nwell as much tear and wear of the machinery, by the frequent jolts and\r\nblows of the wheels against the rails.  His first object therefore was,\r\nto remove the inequalities produced by the imperfect junction between\r\nrail and rail.  At that time, (in 1816) the rails were made of cast iron,\r\neach rail being about three feet long; and sufficient care was not taken\r\nto maintain the points of junction on the same level.  The chairs, or\r\ncast-iron pedestals into which the rails were inserted, were flat at the\r\nbottom; so that, whenever any disturbance took place in the stone blocks\r\nor sleepers supporting them, the flat base of the chair upon which the\r\nrails rested being tilted by unequal subsidence, the end of one rail\r\nbecame depressed, whilst that of the other was elevated.  Hence constant\r\njolts and shocks, the reaction of which very often caused the fracture of\r\nthe rails, and occasionally threw the engine off the road.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this imperfection Mr. Stephenson devised a new chair, with an\r\nentirely new mode of fixing the rails therein.  Instead of adopting the\r\n_butt-joint_ which had hitherto been used in all cast-iron rails, he\r\nadopted the _half-lap joint_, by which means the rails extended a certain\r\ndistance over each other at the ends, like a scarf-joint.  These ends,\r\ninstead of resting upon the flat chair, were made to rest upon the apex\r\nof a curve forming the bottom of the chair.  The supports were also\r\nextended from three feet to three feet nine inches or four feet apart.\r\nThese rails were accordingly substituted for the old cast-iron plates on\r\nthe Killingworth Colliery Railway, and they were found to be a very great\r\nimprovement upon the previous system, adding both to the efficiency of\r\nthe horse-power, still employed in working the railway, and to the smooth\r\naction of the locomotive engine, but more particularly increasing the\r\nefficiency of the latter.\r\n\r\n                        [Picture: Half-lap Joint]\r\n\r\nThis improved form of rail and chair was embodied in a patent taken out\r\nin the joint names of Mr. Losh, of Newcastle, iron-founder, and of Mr.\r\nStephenson, bearing date 30th September, 1816.  Mr. Losh being a wealthy,\r\nenterprising iron-manufacturer, and having confidence in George\r\nStephenson and his improvements, found the money for the purpose of\r\ntaking out the patent, which, in those days, was a very costly as well as\r\ntroublesome affair.\r\n\r\nThe specification of the same patent also described various important\r\nimprovements in the locomotive itself.  The wheels of the engine were\r\nimproved, being altered from cast to malleable iron, in whole or in part,\r\nby which they were made lighter as well as more durable and safe.  But\r\nthe most ingenious and original contrivance embodied in this patent was\r\nthe substitute for springs which Mr. Stephenson invented.  He contrived\r\nthat the steam generated in the boiler should perform this important\r\noffice.  The method by which this was effected displayed such genuine\r\nmechanical genius, that we would particularly call attention to the\r\ndevice, which was the more remarkable, as it was contrived long before\r\nthe possibility of steam locomotion had become an object of general\r\ninquiry or of public interest.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that up to, and indeed after, the period of\r\nwhich we speak, there was no such class of skilled mechanics, nor were\r\nthere any such machines and tools in use, as are now available to\r\ninventors and manufacturers.  Although skilled workmen were in course of\r\ngradual training in a few of the larger manufacturing towns, they did\r\nnot, at the date of Stephenson's patent, exist in any considerable\r\nnumbers, nor was there then any class of mechanics capable of\r\nconstructing springs of sufficient strength and elasticity to support\r\nlocomotive engines of ten tons weight.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the dangers arising from the inequalities of the road,\r\nStephenson so arranged the boiler of his new patent locomotive that it\r\nwas supported upon the frame of the engine by four cylinders, which\r\nopened into the interior of the boiler.  These cylinders were occupied by\r\npistons with rods, which passed downwards and pressed upon the upper side\r\nof the axles.  The cylinders opening into the interior of the boiler,\r\nallowed the pressure of steam to be applied to the upper side of the\r\npiston; and the pressure being nearly equivalent to one-fourth of the\r\nweight of the engine, each axle, whatever might be its position, had at\r\nall times nearly the same amount of weight to bear, and consequently the\r\nentire weight was pretty equally distributed amongst the four wheels of\r\nthe locomotive.  Thus the four floating pistons were ingeniously made to\r\nserve the purpose of springs in equalising the weight, and in softening\r\nthe jerks of the machine; the weight of which, it must also be observed,\r\nhad been increased, on a road originally calculated to bear a\r\nconsiderably lighter description of carriage.  This mode of supporting\r\nthe engine remained in use until the progress of spring-making had so far\r\nadvanced that steel springs could be manufactured of sufficient strength\r\nto bear the weight of locomotive engines.\r\n\r\n           [Picture: Old Killingworth Locomotive, still in use]\r\n\r\nThe result of the actual working of the new locomotive on the improved\r\nroad amply justified the promises held forth in the specification.  The\r\ntraffic was conducted with greater regularity and economy, and the\r\nsuperiority of the engine, as compared with horse traction, became still\r\nmore marked.  It is a fact worthy of notice, that the identical engines\r\nconstructed in 1816 after the plan above described are to this day to be\r\nseen in regular useful work upon the Killingworth Railway, conveying\r\nheavy coal-trains at the speed of between five and six miles an hour,\r\nprobably as economically as any of the more perfect locomotives now in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's endeavours having been attended with such marked success\r\nin the adaptation of locomotive power to railways, his attention was\r\ncalled by many of his friends, about the year 1818, to the application of\r\nsteam to travelling on common roads.  It was from this point that the\r\nlocomotive started, Trevithick's first engine having been constructed\r\nwith this special object.  Stephenson's friends having observed how far\r\nbehind he had left the original projector of the locomotive in its\r\napplication to railroads, perhaps naturally inferred that he would be\r\nequally successful in applying it to the purpose for which Trevithick and\r\nVivian had intended their first engine.  But the accuracy with which he\r\nestimated the resistance to which loads were exposed on railways, arising\r\nfrom friction and gravity, led him at a very early stage to reject the\r\nidea of ever applying steam power economically to common-road travelling.\r\nIn October, 1818, he made a series of careful experiments in conjunction\r\nwith Nicholas Wood, on the resistance to which carriages were exposed on\r\nrailways, testing the results by means of a dynamometer of his own\r\nconstruction.  The series of practical observations made by means of this\r\ninstrument were interesting, as the first systematic attempt to determine\r\nthe precise amount of resistance to carriages moving along railways.  It\r\nwas then for the first time ascertained by experiment that the friction\r\nwas a constant quantity at all velocities.  Although this theory had long\r\nbefore been developed by Vince and Coulomb, and was well known to\r\nscientific men as an established truth, yet, at the time when Stephenson\r\nmade his experiments, the deductions of philosophers on the subject were\r\nneither believed in nor acted upon by practical engineers.\r\n\r\nHe ascertained that the resistances to traction were mainly three; the\r\nfirst being upon the axles of the carriages, the second, or rolling\r\nresistance, being between the circumference of the wheel and the surface\r\nof the rail, and the third being the resistance of gravity.  The amount\r\nof friction and gravity he could accurately ascertain; but the rolling\r\nresistance was a matter of greater difficulty, being subject to much\r\nvariation.  He satisfied himself, however, that it was so great when the\r\nsurface presented to the wheel was of a rough character, that the idea of\r\nworking steam carriages economically on common roads was dismissed by him\r\nas entirely impracticable.  Taking it as 10 lbs to a ton weight on a\r\nlevel railway, it became obvious to him that so small a rise as 1 in 100\r\nwould diminish the useful effort of a locomotive by upwards of 50 per\r\ncent.  This was demonstrated by repeated experiments, and the important\r\nfact, thus rooted in his mind, was never lost sight of in the course of\r\nhis future railway career.\r\n\r\nIt was owing in a great measure to these painstaking experiments that he\r\nearly became convinced of the vital importance, in an economical point of\r\nview, of reducing the country through which a railway was intended to\r\npass as nearly as possible to a level.  Where, as in the first coal\r\nrailways of Northumberland and Durham, the load was nearly all one\r\nway,--that is, from the colliery to the shipping-place,--it was an\r\nadvantage to have an inclination in that direction.  The strain on the\r\npowers of the locomotive was thus diminished, and it was easy for it to\r\nhaul the empty waggons back to the colliery up even a pretty steep\r\nincline.  But when the loads were both ways, he deemed it of great\r\nimportance that the railroad should be constructed as nearly as possible\r\non a level.\r\n\r\nThese views, thus early entertained, originated in Stephenson's mind the\r\npeculiar character of railroad works as distinguished from other roads;\r\nfor, in railways, he early contended that large sums would be wisely\r\nexpended in perforating barriers of hills with long tunnels, and in\r\nraising the lower levels with the excess cut down from the adjacent high\r\nground.  In proportion as these views forced themselves upon his mind and\r\nwere corroborated by his daily experience, he became more and more\r\nconvinced of the hopelessness of applying steam locomotion to common\r\nroads; for every argument in favour of a level railway was, in his view,\r\nan argument against the rough and hilly course of a common road.\r\n\r\nAlthough Stephenson's locomotive engines were in daily use for many years\r\non the Killingworth Railway, they excited comparatively little interest.\r\nThey were no longer experimental, but had become an established tractive\r\npower.  The experience of years had proved that they worked more\r\nsteadily, drew heavier loads, and were, on the whole, considerably more\r\neconomical than horses.  Nevertheless eight years passed before another\r\nlocomotive railway was constructed and opened for the purposes of coal or\r\nother traffic.\r\n\r\nStephenson had no means of bringing his important invention prominently\r\nunder the notice of the public.  He himself knew well its importance, and\r\nhe already anticipated its eventual general adoption; but being an\r\nunlettered man, he could not give utterance to the thoughts which brooded\r\nwithin him on the subject.  Killingworth Colliery lay far from London,\r\nthe centre of scientific life in England.  It was visited by no savans\r\nnor literary men, who might have succeeded in introducing to notice the\r\nwonderful machine of Stephenson.  Even the local chroniclers seem to have\r\ntaken no notice of the Killingworth Railway.\r\n\r\nThere seemed, indeed, to be so small a prospect of introducing the\r\nlocomotive into general use, that Stephenson,--perhaps feeling the\r\ncapabilities within him,--again recurred to his old idea of emigrating to\r\nthe United States.  Before joining Mr. Burrel as partner in a small\r\nfoundry at Forth Banks, Newcastle, he had thrown out to him the\r\nsuggestion that it would be a good speculation for them to emigrate to\r\nNorth America, and introduce steamboats upon the great inland lakes\r\nthere.  The first steamers were then plying upon the Tyne before his\r\neyes; and he saw in them the germ of a great revolution in navigation.\r\nIt occurred to him that North America presented the finest field for\r\ntrying their wonderful powers.  He was an engineer, his partner was an\r\niron-founder; and between them he thought they might strike out a path to\r\nfortune in the mighty West.  Fortunately, this idea remained a mere\r\nspeculation so far as Stephenson was concerned: and it was left to others\r\nto do what he had dreamt of achieving.  After all his patient waiting,\r\nhis skill, industry, and perseverance were at length about to bear fruit.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the owners of the Hetton Colliery, in the county of Durham,\r\ndetermined to have their waggon-way altered to a locomotive railroad.\r\nThe result of the working of the Killingworth Railway had been so\r\nsatisfactory, that they resolved to adopt the same system.  One reason\r\nwhy an experiment so long continued and so successful as that at\r\nKillingworth should have been so slow in producing results, perhaps was,\r\nthat to lay down a railway and furnish it with locomotives, or fixed\r\nengines where necessary, required a very large capital, beyond the means\r\nof ordinary coal-owners; whilst the small amount of interest felt in\r\nrailways by the general public, and the supposed impracticability of\r\nworking them to a profit, as yet prevented ordinary capitalists from\r\nventuring their money in the promotion of such undertakings.  The Hetton\r\nCoal Company were, however, possessed of adequate means; and the local\r\nreputation of the Killingworth engine-wright pointed him out as the man\r\nbest calculated to lay out their line, and superintend their works.  They\r\naccordingly invited him to act as the engineer of the proposed railway,\r\nwhich was to be the longest locomotive line that had, up to that time,\r\nbeen constructed.  It extended from the Hetton Colliery, situated about\r\ntwo miles south of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham, to the\r\nshipping-places on the banks of the Wear, near Sunderland.  Its length\r\nwas about eight miles; and in its course it crossed Warden Law, one of\r\nthe highest hills in the district.  The character of the country forbade\r\nthe construction of a flat line, or one of comparatively easy gradients,\r\nexcept by the expenditure of a much larger capital than was placed at the\r\nengineer's disposal.  Heavy works could not be executed; it was therefore\r\nnecessary to form the line with but little deviation from the natural\r\nconformation of the district which it traversed, and also to adapt the\r\nmechanical methods employed for its working to the character of the\r\ngradients, which in some places were necessarily heavy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Stephenson had, with every step made towards its increased\r\nutility, become more and more identified with the success of the\r\nlocomotive engine, he did not allow his enthusiasm to carry him away into\r\ncostly mistakes.  He carefully drew the line between the cases in which\r\nthe locomotive could be usefully employed, and those in which stationary\r\nengines were calculated to be more economical.  This led him, as in the\r\ninstance of the Hetton Railway, to execute lines through and over rough\r\ncountries, where gradients within the powers of the locomotive engine of\r\nthat day could not be secured, employing in their stead stationary\r\nengines where locomotives were not practicable.  In the present case,\r\nthis course was adopted by him most successfully.  On the original Hetton\r\nline, there were five self-acting inclines,--the full waggons drawing the\r\nempty ones up,--and two inclines worked by fixed reciprocating engines of\r\nsixty horse power each.  The locomotive travelling engine, or \"the iron\r\nhorse,\" as the people of the neighbourhood then styled it, did the rest.\r\nOn the day of the opening of the Hetton Railway, the 18th November, 1822,\r\ncrowds of spectators assembled from all parts to witness the first\r\noperations of this ingenious and powerful machinery, which was entirely\r\nsuccessful.  On that day five of Stephenson's locomotives were at work\r\nupon the railway, under the direction of his brother Robert; and the\r\nfirst shipment of coal was then made by the Hetton Company, at their new\r\nstaiths on the Wear.  The speed at which the locomotives travelled was\r\nabout 4 miles an hour, and each engine dragged after it a train of 17\r\nwaggons, weighing about 64 tons.\r\n\r\nWhile thus advancing step by step,--attending to the business of the\r\nKillingworth Colliery, and laying out railways in the neighbourhood,--he\r\nwas carefully watching over the education of his son.  We have already\r\nseen that Robert was sent to Bruce's school at Newcastle, where he\r\nremained about four years.  He left it in the summer of 1819, and was\r\nthen put apprentice to Mr. Nicholas Wood, the head viewer at\r\nKillingworth, to learn the business of the colliery.  He served in that\r\ncapacity for about three years, during which time he became familiar with\r\nmost departments of underground work.  The occupation was not unattended\r\nwith peril, as the following incident will show.  Though the use of the\r\nGeordy lamp had become general in the Killingworth pits, and the workmen\r\nwere bound, under a penalty of half-a-crown, not to use a naked candle,\r\nit was difficult to enforce the rule, and even the masters themselves\r\noccasionally broke it.  One day Nicholas Wood, the head viewer, Moodie\r\nthe under viewer, and Robert Stephenson, were proceeding along one of the\r\ngalleries, Wood with a naked candle in his hand, and Robert following him\r\nwith a lamp.  They came to a place where a fall of stones from the roof\r\nhad taken place, on which Wood, who was first, proceeded to clamber over\r\nthe stones, holding high the naked candle.  He had nearly reached the\r\nsummit of the heap, when the fire-damp, which had accumulated in the\r\nhollow of the roof, exploded, and instantly the whole party were blown\r\ndown, and the lights extinguished.  They were a mile from the shaft, and\r\nquite in the dark.  There was a rush of the workpeople from all quarters\r\ntowards the shaft, for it was feared that the fire might extend to more\r\ndangerous parts of the pit, where, if the gas had exploded, every soul in\r\nthe mine must inevitably have perished.  Robert Stephenson and Moodie, on\r\nthe first impulse, ran back at full speed along the dark gallery leading\r\nto the shaft, coming into collision, on their way, with the hind quarters\r\nof a horse stunned by the explosion.  When they had gone halfway, Moodie\r\nhalted, and bethought him of Nicholas Wood.  \"Stop, laddie!\" said he to\r\nRobert, \"stop; we maun gang back, and seek the maister.\"  So they\r\nretraced their steps.  Happily, no further explosion had taken place.\r\nThey found the master lying on the heap of stones, stunned and bruised,\r\nwith his hands severely burnt.  They led him to the bottom of the shaft;\r\nand he took care afterwards not to venture into the dangerous parts of\r\nthe mine without the protection of a Geordy lamp.\r\n\r\nThe time that Robert spent at Killingworth as viewer's apprentice was of\r\nadvantage both to his father and himself.  The evenings were generally\r\ndevoted to reading and study, the two from this time working together as\r\nfriends and co-labourers.  One who used to drop in at the cottage of an\r\nevening, well remembers the animated and eager discussions which on some\r\noccasions took place, more especially with reference to the growing\r\npowers of the locomotive engine.  The son was even more enthusiastic than\r\nthe father on this subject.  Robert would suggest numerous alterations\r\nand improvements in details.  His father, on the contrary, would offer\r\nevery possible objection, defending the existing arrangements,--proud,\r\nnevertheless of his son's suggestions, and often warmed and excited by\r\nhis brilliant anticipations of the ultimate triumph of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nThese discussions probably had considerable influence in inducing\r\nStephenson to take the next important step in the education of his son.\r\nAlthough Robert, who was only nineteen years of age, was doing well, and\r\nwas certain at the expiration of his apprenticeship to rise to a higher\r\nposition, his father was not satisfied with the amount of instruction\r\nwhich he had as yet given him.  Remembering the disadvantages under which\r\nhe had himself laboured through his ignorance of practical chemistry\r\nduring his investigations connected with the safety-lamp, more especially\r\nwith reference to the properties of gas, as well as in the course of his\r\nexperiments with the object of improving the locomotive engine, he\r\ndetermined to furnish his son with as complete a scientific culture as\r\nhis means would afford.  He also believed that a proper training in\r\ntechnical science was indispensable to success in the higher walks of the\r\nengineer's profession; and he determined to give to his son that kind and\r\ndegree of education which he so much desired for himself.  He would thus,\r\nhe knew, secure a hearty and generous co-worker in the elaboration of the\r\ngreat ideas now looming before him, and with their united practical and\r\nscientific knowledge he probably felt that they would be equal to any\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly took Robert from his labours as under-viewer in the West\r\nMoor Pit, and in October, 1822, sent him to the Edinburgh University,\r\nthere being then no college in England accessible to persons of moderate\r\nmeans, for purposes of scientific culture.  Robert was furnished with\r\nletters of introduction to several men of literary eminence in Edinburgh;\r\nhis father's reputation in connexion with the safety-lamp being of\r\nservice to him in this respect.  He lodged in Drummond Street, in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the college, and attended the Chemical Lectures of\r\nDr. Hope, the Natural Philosophy Lectures of Sir John Leslie, and the\r\nNatural History Class of Professor Jameson.  He also devoted several\r\nevenings in each week to the study of practical Chemistry under Dr. John\r\nMurray, himself one of the numerous designers of a safety-lamp.  He took\r\ncareful notes of all the lectures, which he copied out at night before he\r\nwent to bed; so that, when he returned to Killingworth, he might read\r\nthem over to his father.  He afterwards had the notes bound up, and\r\nplaced in his library.  Long years after, when conversing with Thomas\r\nHarrison, C.E., at his house in Gloucester Square, he rose from his seat\r\nand took down a volume from the shelves.  Mr. Harrison observed that the\r\nbook was in MS., neatly written out.  \"What have we here?\" he asked.  The\r\nanswer was--\"When I went to college, I knew the difficulty my father had\r\nin collecting the funds to send me there.  Before going I studied\r\nshort-hand; while at Edinburgh, I took down verbatim every lecture; and\r\nin the evenings, before I went to bed, I transcribed those lectures word\r\nfor word.  You see the result in that range of books.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the practical sciences in the study of which Robert Stephenson\r\ntook special interest while at Edinburgh was that of geology.  The\r\nsituation of the city, in the midst of a district of highly interesting\r\ngeological formation, easily accessible to pedestrians, is indeed most\r\nfavourable to the pursuit of such a study; and it was the practice of\r\nProfessor Jameson frequently to head a band of his pupils, armed with\r\nhammers, chisels, and clinometers, and take them with him on a long\r\nramble into the country, for the purpose of teaching them habits of\r\nobservation and reading to them from the open book of Nature itself.  At\r\nthe close of this session, the professor took with him a select body of\r\nhis pupils on an excursion along the Great Glen of the Highlands, in the\r\nline of the Caledonian Canal, and Robert formed one of the party.  They\r\npassed under the shadow of Ben Nevis, examined the famous old sea-margins\r\nknown as the \"parallel roads of Glen Roy,\" and extended their journey as\r\nfar as Inverness; the professor teaching the young men as they travelled\r\nhow to observe in a mountain country.  Not long before his death, Robert\r\nStephenson spoke in glowing terms of the great pleasure and benefit which\r\nhe had derived from that interesting excursion.  \"I have travelled far,\r\nand enjoyed much,\" he said; \"but that delightful botanical and geological\r\njourney I shall never forget; and I am just about to start in the\r\n_Titania_ for a trip round the east coast of Scotland, returning south\r\nthrough the Caledonian Canal, to refresh myself with the recollection of\r\nthat first and brightest tour of my life.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer of 1822 the young student returned to\r\nKillingworth to re-enter upon the active business of life.  The six\r\nmonths' study had cost his father 80 pounds; but he was amply repaid by\r\nthe better scientific culture which his son had acquired, and the\r\nevidence of ability and industry which he was enabled to exhibit in a\r\nprize for mathematics which he had won at the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nGEORGE STEPHENSON ENGINEER OF THE STOCKTON AND DARLINGTON RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district west of Darlington, in Durham, is one of the richest mineral\r\nfields of the North.  Vast stores of coal underlie the Bishop Auckland\r\nValley; and from an early period new and good roads to market were felt\r\nto be exceedingly desirable.  As yet it remained almost a closed field,\r\nthe cost of transport of the coal in carts, or on horses' or donkeys'\r\nbacks, greatly limiting the sale.  Long ago, in the days of canal\r\nformations, Brindley was consulted about a canal; afterwards, in 1812, a\r\ntramroad was surveyed by Rennie; and eventually, in 1817, a railway was\r\nprojected from Darlington to Stockton-on-Tees.\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Map of Stockton and Darlington Railway]\r\n\r\nOf this railway Edward Pease was the projector.  A thoughtful and\r\nsagacious man, ready in resources, possessed of indomitable energy and\r\nperseverance, he was eminently qualified to undertake what appeared to\r\nmany the hopeless enterprise of obtaining an Act for a railway through\r\nsuch an unpromising district.  One who knew him in 1818 said, \"he was a\r\nman who could see a hundred years ahead.\"\r\n\r\n                         [Picture: Edward Pease]\r\n\r\nWhen the writer last saw him, in the autumn of 1854, Mr. Pease was in his\r\n  eighty-eighth year; yet he still possessed the hopefulness and mental\r\nvigour of a man in his prime.  Hale and hearty, and full of reminiscences\r\n   of the past, he continued to take an active interest in all measures\r\n calculated to render men happier and better.  Still sound in health, his\r\n eye had not lost its brilliancy, nor his cheek its colour; and there was\r\n   an elasticity in his step which younger men might have envied. {125}\r\n\r\nIn getting up a company for surveying and forming a railway, Mr. Pease\r\nhad great difficulties to encounter.  The people of the neighbourhood\r\nspoke of it as a ridiculous undertaking, and predicted that it would be\r\nruinous to all concerned.  Even those most interested in the opening of\r\nnew markets for their coal, were indifferent, if not actually hostile.\r\nThe Stockton merchants and shipowners, whom it was calculated so greatly\r\nto benefit, gave the project no support; and not twenty shares were\r\nsubscribed for in the whole town.  Mr. Pease nevertheless persevered; and\r\nhe induced many of his friends and relations to subscribe the capital\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe necessary preliminary steps were taken in 1818 to apply for an act to\r\nauthorise the construction of a tramroad from Witton to Stockton.  The\r\nmeasure was however, strongly opposed by the Duke of Cleveland, because\r\nthe proposed line passed close by one of his fox covers; and the bill was\r\nrejected.  A new survey was then made, avoiding the Duke's cover; and in\r\n1819 a renewed application was made to Parliament.  The promoters were\r\nthis time successful, and the royal assent was given to the first\r\nStockton and Darlington Railway Act on the 19th April, 1821.\r\n\r\nThe projectors did not originally contemplate the employment of\r\nlocomotives.  The Act provided for the making and maintaining of\r\ntramroads for the passage \"of waggons and other carriages\" \"_with men and\r\nhorses_ or otherwise,\" and a further clause made provision for damages\r\ndone in course of traffic by the \"waggoners.\"  The public were to be free\r\n\"to use with horses, cattle and carriages,\" the roads formed by the\r\ncompany, on payment of the authorised rates, \"between the hours of seven\r\nin the morning and six in the evening,\" during winter; \"between six in\r\nthe morning and eight in the evening,\" in two of the spring and autumn\r\nmonths; and \"between five in the morning and ten in the evening,\" in the\r\nsummer months of May, June, July, and August.  From this it will be\r\nobvious that the projectors of the line had themselves at first no very\r\nlarge conceptions as to the scope of their project.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the spring of 1821, two strangers knocked at the door of Mr.\r\nPease's house in Darlington; and the message was brought to him that some\r\npersons from Killingworth wanted to speak with him.  They were invited\r\nin, on which one of the visitors introduced himself as Nicholas Wood,\r\nviewer at Killingworth, and then turning to his companion, he introduced\r\nhim as George Stephenson, engine-wright, of the same place.\r\n\r\nMr. Pease entered into conversation with his visitors, and was soon told\r\ntheir object.  Stephenson had heard of the passing of the Stockton and\r\nDarlington Act, and desiring to increase his railway experience, and also\r\nto employ in some larger field the practical knowledge he had already\r\ngained, he determined to visit the known projector of the undertaking,\r\nwith the view of being employed to carry it out.  He had brought with him\r\nhis friend Wood, for the purpose at the same time of relieving his\r\ndiffidence, and supporting his application.\r\n\r\nMr. Pease liked the appearance of his visitor: \"there was,\" as he\r\nafterwards remarked when speaking of Stephenson, \"such an honest,\r\nsensible look about him, and he seemed so modest and unpretending.  He\r\nspoke in the strong Northumbrian dialect of his district, and described\r\nhimself as 'only the engine-wright at Killingworth; that's what he was.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pease soon saw that our engineer was the very man for his purpose.\r\nThe whole plans of the railway were still in an undetermined state, and\r\nMr. Pease was therefore glad to have the opportunity of profiting by\r\nStephenson's experience.  In the course of their conversation, the latter\r\nstrongly recommended a _railway_ in preference to a tramroad.  They also\r\ndiscussed the kind of tractive power to be employed: Mr. Pease stating\r\nthat the company had based their whole calculations on the employment of\r\n_horse_ power.  \"I was so satisfied,\" said he afterwards, \"that a horse\r\nupon an iron road would draw ten tons for one ton on a common road, that\r\nI felt sure that before long the railway would become the King's\r\nhighway.\"  But Mr. Pease was scarcely prepared for the bold assertion\r\nmade by his visitor, that the locomotive engine with which he had been\r\nworking the Killingworth Railway for many years past was worth fifty\r\nhorses, and that engines made after a similar plan would yet entirely\r\nsupersede all horse power upon railroads.  Stephenson was daily becoming\r\nmore positive as to the superiority of his locomotive; and hence he\r\nstrongly urged Mr. Pease to adopt it.  \"Come over to Killingworth,\" said\r\nhe, \"and see what my engines can do; seeing is believing, sir.\"  Mr.\r\nPease accordingly promised that on some early day he would go over to\r\nKillingworth, and take a look at the wonderful machine that was to\r\nsupersede horses.  The result of the interview was, that Mr. Pease\r\npromised to bring Stephenson's application for the appointment of\r\nengineer before the Directors, and to support it with his influence;\r\nwhereon the two visitors prepared to take their leave, informing Mr.\r\nPease that they intended to return to Newcastle \"by nip;\" that is, they\r\nexpected to get a smuggled lift on the stage-coach, by tipping Jehu,--for\r\nin those days the stage coachmen regarded all casual roadside passengers\r\nas their proper perquisites.  They had, however, been so much engrossed\r\nby their conversation, that the lapse of time was forgotten, and when\r\nStephenson and his friend made enquiries about the return coach, they\r\nfound the last had left; and they had to walk the 18 miles to Durham on\r\ntheir way back to Newcastle.\r\n\r\nMr. Pease having made further inquiries respecting Stephenson's character\r\nand qualifications, and having received a very strong recommendation of\r\nhim as the right man for the intended work, he brought the subject of his\r\napplication before the directors of the Stockton and Darlington Company.\r\nThey resolved to adopt his recommendation that a railway be formed\r\ninstead of a tramroad; and they further requested Mr. Pease to write to\r\nStephenson, desiring him to undertake a re-survey of the line at the\r\nearliest practicable period.\r\n\r\nA man was despatched on a horse with the letter, and when he reached\r\nKillingworth he made diligent enquiry after the person named upon the\r\naddress, \"George Stephenson, Esquire, Engineer.\"  No such person was\r\nknown in the village.  It is said that the man was on the point of giving\r\nup all further search, when the happy thought struck some of the\r\ncolliers' wives who had gathered about him, that it must be \"Geordie the\r\nengine-wright\" the man was in search of; and to Geordie's cottage he\r\naccordingly went, found him at home, and delivered the letter.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of September, Stephenson went carefully over the line of\r\nthe proposed railway, for the purpose of suggesting such improvements and\r\ndeviations as he might consider desirable.  He was accompanied by an\r\nassistant and a chainman,--his son Robert entering the figures while his\r\nfather took the sights.  After being engaged in the work at intervals for\r\nabout six weeks, Stephenson reported the result of his survey to the\r\nBoard of Directors, and showed that by certain deviations, a line shorter\r\nby about three miles might be constructed at a considerable saving in\r\nexpense, while at the same time more favourable gradients--an important\r\nconsideration--would be secured.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, determined in the first place to proceed with the works\r\nat those parts of the line where no deviation was proposed; and the first\r\nrail of the Stockton and Darlington Railway was laid with considerable\r\nceremony, near Stockton, on the 23rd May, 1822.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that Stephenson, in making his first estimate of the\r\ncost of forming the railway according to the Instructions of the\r\ndirectors, set down, as part of the cost, 6200 pounds for stationary\r\nengines, not mentioning locomotives at all.  The directors as yet\r\nconfined their views to the employment only of horses for the haulage of\r\nthe coals, and of fixed engines and ropes where horse-power was not\r\napplicable.  The whole question of steam locomotive power was, in the\r\nestimation of the public, as well as of practical and scientific men, as\r\nyet in doubt.  The confident anticipations of George Stephenson, as to\r\nthe eventual success of locomotive engines, were regarded as mere\r\nspeculations; and when he gave utterance to his views, as he frequently\r\ntook the opportunity of doing, it even had the effect of shaking the\r\nconfidence of some of his friends in the solidity of his judgment and his\r\npractical qualities as an engineer.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pease discussed the question with Stephenson, his remark was,\r\n\"Come over and see my engines at Killingworth, and satisfy yourself as to\r\nthe efficiency of the locomotive.  I will show you the colliery books,\r\nthat you may ascertain for yourself the actual cost of working.  And I\r\nmust tell you that the economy of the locomotive engine is no longer a\r\nmatter of theory, but a matter of fact.\"  So confident was the tone in\r\nwhich Stephenson spoke of the success of his engines, and so important\r\nwere the consequences involved in arriving at a correct conclusion on the\r\nsubject, that Mr. Pease at length resolved upon paying a visit to\r\nKillingworth in the summer of 1822, to see with his own eyes the\r\nwonderful new power so much vaunted by the engineer.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pease arrived at Killingworth village, he inquired for George\r\nStephenson, and was told that he must go over to the West Moor, and seek\r\nfor a cottage by the roadside, with a dial over the door--\"that was where\r\nGeorge Stephenson lived.\"  They soon found the house with the dial; and\r\non knocking, the door was opened by Mrs. Stephenson--his second wife\r\n(Elizabeth Hindmarsh), the daughter of a farmer at Black Callerton, whom\r\nhe had married in 1820. {129}  Her husband, she said, was not in the\r\nhouse at present, but she would send for him to the colliery.  And in a\r\nshort time Stephenson appeared before them in his working dress, just as\r\nhe had come out of the pit.\r\n\r\nHe very soon had his locomotive brought up to the crossing close by the\r\nend of the cottage,--made the gentlemen mount it, and showed them its\r\npaces.  Harnessing it to a train of loaded waggons, he ran it along the\r\nrailroad, and so thoroughly satisfied his visitors of its power and\r\ncapabilities, that from that day Edward Pease was a declared supporter of\r\nthe locomotive engine.  In preparing the Amended Stockton and Darlington\r\nAct, at Stephenson's urgent request Mr. Pease had a clause inserted,\r\ntaking power to work the railway by means of locomotive engines, and to\r\nemploy them for the haulage of passengers as well as of merchandise.\r\n{130}  The Act was obtained in 1823, on which Stephenson was appointed\r\nthe company's engineer at a salary of 300 pounds per annum; and it was\r\ndetermined that the line should be constructed and opened for traffic as\r\nsoon as practicable.\r\n\r\nHe at once proceeded, accompanied by his assistants, with the working\r\nsurvey of the line, laying out every foot of the ground himself.  Railway\r\nsurveying was as yet in its infancy, and was slow and difficult work.  It\r\nafterwards became a separate branch of railway business, and was\r\nentrusted to a special staff.  Indeed on no subsequent line did George\r\nStephenson take the sights through the spirit level with his own hands\r\nand eyes as he did on this railway.  He started very early--dressed in a\r\nblue tailed coat, breeches, and top-boots--and surveyed until dusk.  He\r\nwas not at any time particular as to his living; and during the survey,\r\nhe took his chance of getting a little milk and bread at some cottager's\r\nhouse along the line, or occasionally joined in a homely dinner at some\r\nneighbouring farmhouse.  The country people were accustomed to give him a\r\nhearty welcome when he appeared at their door; for he was always full of\r\ncheery and homely talk, and, when there were children about the house, he\r\nhad plenty of humorous chat for them as well as for their seniors.\r\n\r\nAfter the day's work was over, George would drop in at Mr. Pease's, to\r\ntalk over the progress of the survey, and discuss various matters\r\nconnected with the railway.  Mr. Pease's daughters were usually present;\r\nand on one occasion, finding the young ladies learning the art of\r\nembroidery, he volunteered to instruct them. {131}  \"I know all about\r\nit,\" said he; \"and you will wonder how I learnt it.  I will tell you.\r\nWhen I was a brakesman at Killingworth, I learnt the art of embroidery\r\nwhile working the pitmen's buttonholes by the engine fire at nights.\"  He\r\nwas never ashamed, but on the contrary rather proud, of reminding his\r\nfriends of these humble pursuits of his early life.  Mr. Pease's family\r\nwere greatly pleased with his conversation, which was always amusing and\r\ninstructive; full of all sorts of experience, gathered in the oddest and\r\nmost out-of-the-way places.  Even at that early period, before he mixed\r\nin the society of educated persons, there was a dash of speculativeness\r\nin his remarks, which gave a high degree of originality to his\r\nconversation; and he would sometimes, in a casual remark, throw a flash\r\nof light upon a subject, which called up a train of pregnant suggestions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important subjects of discussion at these meetings with\r\nMr. Pease, was the establishment of a manufactory at Newcastle for the\r\nbuilding of locomotive engines.  Up to this time all the locomotives\r\nconstructed after Stephenson's designs, had been made by ordinary\r\nmechanics working among the collieries in the North of England.  But he\r\nhad long felt that the accuracy and style of their workmanship admitted\r\nof great improvement, and that upon this the more perfect action of the\r\nlocomotive engine, and its general adoption, in a great measure depended.\r\nOne great object that he had in view in establishing the proposed factory\r\nwas, to concentrate a number of good workmen, for the purpose of carrying\r\nout the improvements in detail which he was constantly making in his\r\nengine.  He felt hampered by the want of efficient help from skilled\r\nmechanics, who could work out in a practical form the ideas of which his\r\nbusy mind was always so prolific.  Doubtless, too, he believed that the\r\nmanufactory would prove a remunerative investment, and that, on the\r\ngeneral adoption of the railway system which he anticipated, he would\r\nderive solid advantages from the fact of his establishment being the only\r\none of the kind for the special construction of locomotive engines.\r\n\r\nMr. Pease approved of his design, and strongly recommended him to carry\r\nit into effect.  But there was the question of means; and Stephenson did\r\nnot think he had capital enough for the purpose.  He told Mr. Pease that\r\nhe could advance 1000 pounds--the amount of the testimonial presented by\r\nthe coal-owners for his safety-lamp invention, which he had still left\r\nuntouched; but he did not think this sufficient for the purpose, and he\r\nthought that he should require at least another 1000 pounds.  Mr. Pease\r\nhad been very much struck with the successful performances of the\r\nKillingworth engine; and being an accurate judge of character, he\r\nbelieved that he could not go far wrong in linking a portion of his\r\nfortune with the energy and industry of George Stephenson.  He consulted\r\nhis friend Thomas Richardson in the matter; and the two consented to\r\nadvance 500 pounds each for the purpose of establishing the engine\r\nfactory at Newcastle.  A piece of land was accordingly purchased in Forth\r\nStreet, in August, 1823, on which a small building was erected--the\r\nnucleus of the gigantic establishment which was afterwards formed around\r\nit; and active operations were begun early in 1824.\r\n\r\nWhile the Stockton and Darlington Railway works were in progress, our\r\nengineer had many interesting discussions with Mr. Pease, on points\r\nconnected with its construction and working, the determination of which\r\nin a great measure affected the formation and working of all future\r\nrailways.  The most important points were these:\r\n\r\n1.  The comparative merits of cast and wrought iron rails.\r\n\r\n2.  The gauge of the railway.\r\n\r\n3.  The employment of horse or engine power in working it, when ready for\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nThe kind of rails to be laid down to form the permanent road was a matter\r\nof considerable importance.  A wooden tramroad had been contemplated when\r\nthe first Act was applied for; but Stephenson having advised that an iron\r\nroad should be laid down, he was instructed to draw up a specification of\r\nthe rails.  He went before the directors to discuss with them the kind of\r\nmaterial to be specified.  He was himself interested in the patent for\r\ncast-iron rails, which he had taken out in conjunction with Mr. Losh in\r\n1816; and, of course, it was to his interest that his articles should be\r\nused.  But when requested to give his opinion on the subject, he frankly\r\nsaid to the directors, \"Well, gentlemen, to tell you the truth, although\r\nit would put 500 pounds in my pocket to specify my own patent rails, I\r\ncannot do so after the experience I have had.  If you take my advice, you\r\nwill not lay down a single cast-iron rail.\"  \"Why?\" asked the directors.\r\n\"Because they will not stand the weight, and you will be at no end of\r\nexpense for repairs and relays.\"  \"What kind of road, then,\" he was\r\nasked, \"would you recommend?\"  \"Malleable rails, certainly,\" said he;\r\n\"and I can recommend them with the more confidence from the fact that at\r\nKillingworth we have had some Swedish bars laid down--nailed to wooden\r\nsleepers--for a period of fourteen years, the waggons passing over them\r\ndaily; and there they are, in use yet, whereas the cast rails are\r\nconstantly giving way.\"\r\n\r\nThe price of malleable rails was, however, so high--being then worth\r\nabout 12 pounds per ton as compared with cast-iron rails at about 5\r\npounds 10s.--and the saving of expense was so important a consideration\r\nwith the subscribers, that Stephenson was directed to provide, in the\r\nspecification, that only one-half of the rails required--or about 800\r\ntons--should be of malleable iron, and the remainder of cast-iron.  The\r\nmalleable rails were of the kind called \"fish-bellied,\" and weighed 28\r\nlbs. to the yard, being 2.25 inches broad at the top, with the upper\r\nflange 0.75 inch thick.  They were only 2 inches in depth at the points\r\nat which they rested on the chairs, and 3.25 inches in the middle or\r\nbellied part.\r\n\r\nWhen forming the road, the proper gauge had also to be determined.  What\r\nwidth was this to be?  The gauge of the first tramroad laid down had\r\nvirtually settled the point.  The gauge of wheels of the common vehicles\r\nof the country--of the carts and waggons employed on common roads, which\r\nwere first used on the tramroads--was about 4 feet 8.5 inches.  And so\r\nthe first tramroads were laid down of this gauge.  The tools and\r\nmachinery for constructing coal-waggons and locomotives were formed with\r\nthis gauge in view.  The Wylam waggon-way, afterwards the Wylam\r\nplate-way, the Killingworth railroad, and the Hetton rail road, were as\r\nnearly as possible on the same gauge.  Some of the earth-waggons used to\r\nform the Stockton and Darlington road were brought from the Hetton\r\nrailway; and others which were specially constructed were formed of the\r\nsame dimensions, these being intended to be afterwards employed in the\r\nworking of the traffic.\r\n\r\nAs the period drew near for the opening of the line, the question of the\r\ntractive power to be employed was anxiously discussed.  At the Brusselton\r\nincline, fixed engines must necessarily be made use of; but with respect\r\nto the mode of working the railway generally, it was decided that horses\r\nwere to be largely employed, and arrangements were made for their\r\npurchase.  The influence of Mr. Pease also secured that a fair trial\r\nshould be given to the experiment of working the traffic by locomotive\r\npower; and three engines were ordered from the firm of Stephenson and\r\nCo., Newcastle, which were put in hand forthwith, in anticipation of the\r\nopening of the railway.  These were constructed after Mr. Stephenson's\r\nmost matured designs, and embodied all the improvements which he had\r\ncontrived up to that time.  No. I. engine, the \"Locomotion,\" which was\r\nfirst delivered, weighed about eight tons.  It had one large flue or tube\r\nthrough the boiler, by which the heated air passed direct from the\r\nfurnace at one end, lined with fire-bricks, to the chimney at the other.\r\nThe combustion in the furnace was quickened by the adoption of the\r\nsteam-blast in the chimney.  The heat raised was sometimes so great, and\r\nit was so imperfectly abstracted by the surrounding water, that the\r\nchimney became almost red-hot.  Such engines, when put to their speed,\r\nwere found capable of running at the rate of from twelve to sixteen miles\r\nan hour; but they were better adapted for the heavy work of hauling\r\ncoal-trains at low speeds--for which, indeed, they were specially\r\nconstructed--than for running at the higher speeds afterwards adopted.\r\nNor was it contemplated by the directors as possible, at the time when\r\nthey were ordered, that locomotives could be made available for the\r\npurposes of passenger travelling.  Besides, the Stockton and Darlington\r\nRailway did not run through a district in which passengers were supposed\r\nto be likely to constitute any considerable portion of the traffic.\r\n\r\nWe may easily imagine the anxiety felt by Mr. Stephenson during the\r\nprogress of the works towards completion, and his mingled hopes and\r\ndoubts (though his doubts were but few) as to the issue of this great\r\nexperiment.  When the formation of the line near Stockton was well\r\nadvanced, Mr. Stephenson one day, accompanied by his son Robert and John\r\nDixon, made a journey of inspection of the works.  The party reached\r\nStockton, and proceeded to dine at one of the inns there.  After dinner,\r\nStephenson ventured on the very unusual measure of ordering in a bottle\r\nof wine, to drink success to the railway.  John Dixon relates with pride\r\nthe utterance of the master on the occasion.  \"Now, lads,\" said he to the\r\ntwo young men, \"I venture to tell you that I think you will live to see\r\nthe day when railways will supersede almost all other methods of\r\nconveyance in this country--when mail-coaches will go by railway, and\r\nrailroads will become the great highway for the king and all his\r\nsubjects.  The time is coming when it will be cheaper for a working man\r\nto travel upon a railway than to walk on foot.  I know there are great\r\nand almost insurmountable difficulties to be encountered; but what I have\r\nsaid will come to pass as sure as you live.  I only wish I may live to\r\nsee the day, though that I can scarcely hope for, as I know how slow all\r\nhuman progress is, and with what difficulty I have been able to get the\r\nlocomotive thus far adopted, notwithstanding my more than ten years'\r\nsuccessful experiment at Killingworth.\"  The result, however, outstripped\r\neven the most sanguine anticipations of Stephenson; and his son Robert,\r\nshortly after his return from America in 1827, saw his father's\r\nlocomotive generally employed as the tractive power on railways.\r\n\r\nThe Stockton and Darlington line was opened for traffic on the 27th\r\nSeptember, 1825.  An immense concourse of people assembled from all parts\r\nto witness the ceremony of opening this first public railway.  The\r\npowerful opposition which the project had encountered, the threats which\r\nwere still uttered against the company by the road-trustees and others,\r\nwho declared that they would yet prevent the line being worked, and\r\nperhaps the general unbelief as to its success which still prevailed,\r\ntended to excite the curiosity of the public as to the result.  Some went\r\nto rejoice at the opening, some to see the \"bubble burst;\" and there were\r\nmany prophets of evil who would not miss the blowing up of the boasted\r\ntravelling engine.  The opening was, however, auspicious.  The\r\nproceedings commenced at Brusselton Incline, about nine miles above\r\nDarlington, where the fixed engine drew a train of loaded waggons up the\r\nincline from the west, and lowered them on the east side.  At the foot of\r\nthe incline a locomotive was in readiness to receive them, Stephenson\r\nhimself driving the engine.  The train consisted of six waggons loaded\r\nwith coals and flour; after these was the passenger-coach, filled with\r\nthe directors and their friends, and then twenty-one waggons fitted up\r\nwith temporary seats for passengers; and lastly came six waggon-loads of\r\ncoals, making in all a train of thirty-eight vehicles.  The local\r\nchronicler of the day almost went beside himself in describing the\r\nextraordinary event:--\"The signal being given,\" he says, \"the engine\r\nstarted off with this immense train of carriages; and such was its\r\nvelocity, that in some parts the speed was frequently 12 miles an hour!\"\r\nBy the time it reached Stockton there were about 600 persons in the train\r\nor hanging on to the waggons, which must have gone at a safe and steady\r\npace of from four to six miles an hour from Darlington.  \"The arrival at\r\nStockton,\" it is added, \"excited a deep interest and admiration.\"\r\n\r\nThe working of the line then commenced, and the results were such as to\r\nsurprise even the most sanguine of its projectors.  The traffic upon\r\nwhich they had formed their estimates of profit proved to be small in\r\ncomparison with that which flowed in upon them which they had never\r\ndreamt of.  Thus, what the company had principally relied upon for their\r\nreceipts was the carriage of coals for land sale at the stations along\r\nthe line, whereas the haulage of coals to the seaports for exportation to\r\nthe London market was not contemplated as possible.  When the bill was\r\nbefore Parliament, Mr. Lambton (afterwards Earl of Durham) succeeded in\r\ngetting a clause inserted, limiting the charge for the haulage of all\r\ncoal to Stockton-on-Tees for the purpose of shipment to 0.5d. per ton per\r\nmile; whereas a rate of 4d. per ton was allowed to be taken for all coals\r\nled upon the railway for land sale.  Mr. Lambton's object in enforcing\r\nthe low rate of 0.5d. was to protect his own trade in coal exported from\r\nSunderland and the northern ports.  He believed, in common with everybody\r\nelse, that the 0.5d. rate would effectually secure him against\r\ncompetition on the part of the Company; for it was not considered\r\npossible to lead coals at that price, and the proprietors of the railway\r\nthemselves considered that such a rate would be utterly ruinous.  The\r\nprojectors never contemplated sending more than 10,000 tons a year to\r\nStockton, and those only for shipment as ballast; they looked for their\r\nprofits almost exclusively to the land sale.  The result, however, was as\r\nsurprising to them as it must have been to Mr. Lambton.  The 0.5d. rate\r\nwhich was forced upon them, instead of being ruinous, proved the vital\r\nelement in the success of the railway.  In the course of a few years, the\r\nannual shipment of coal, led by the Stockton and Darlington Railway to\r\nStockton and Middlesborough, was more than 500,000 tons; and it has since\r\nfar exceeded this amount.  Instead of being, as anticipated, a\r\nsubordinate branch of traffic, it proved, in fact, the main traffic,\r\nwhile the land sale was merely subsidiary.\r\n\r\nThe anticipations of the company as to passenger traffic were in like\r\nmanner more than realised.  At first, passengers were not thought of; and\r\nit was only while the works were in progress that the starting of a\r\npassenger coach was seriously contemplated.  The number of persons\r\ntravelling between the two towns was very small; and it was not known\r\nwhether these would risk their persons upon the iron road.  It was\r\ndetermined, however, to make trial of a railway coach; and Mr. Stephenson\r\nwas authorised to have one built at Newcastle, at the cost of the\r\ncompany.  This was done accordingly; and the first railway passenger\r\ncarriage was built after our engineer's design.  It was, however, a very\r\nmodest, and indeed a somewhat uncouth machine, more resembling the\r\ncaravans still to be seen at country fairs containing the \"Giant and the\r\nDwarf\" and other wonders of the world, than a passenger-coach of any\r\nextant form.  A row of seats ran along each side of the interior, and a\r\nlong deal table was fixed in the centre; the access being by means of a\r\ndoor at the back end, in the manner of an omnibus.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: The First Railway Coach]\r\n\r\nThis coach arrived from Newcastle the day before the opening, and formed\r\npart of the railway procession above described.  Mr. Stephenson was\r\nconsulted as to the name of the coach, and he at once suggested \"The\r\nExperiment;\" and by this name it was called.  The Company's arms were\r\nafterwards painted on her side, with the motto \"Periculum privatum\r\nutilitas publica.\"  Such was the sole passenger-carrying stock of the\r\nStockton and Darlington Company in the year 1825.  But the \"Experiment\"\r\nproved the forerunner of a mighty traffic: and long time did not elapse\r\nbefore it was displaced, not only by improved coaches (still drawn by\r\nhorses), but afterwards by long trains of passenger-carriages drawn by\r\nlocomotive engines.\r\n\r\n\"The Experiment\" was fairly started as a passenger-coach on the 10th\r\nOctober, 1825, a fortnight after the opening of the line.  It was drawn\r\nby one horse, and performed a journey daily each way between the two\r\ntowns, accomplishing the distance of twelve miles in about two hours.\r\nThe fare charged was a shilling without distinction of class; and each\r\npassenger was allowed fourteen pounds of luggage free.  \"The Experiment\"\r\nwas not, however, worked by the company, but was let to contractors who\r\nworked it under an arrangement whereby toll was paid for the use of the\r\nline, rent of booking-cabins, etc.\r\n\r\nThe speculation answered so well, that several private coaching companies\r\nwere shortly after got up by innkeepers at Darlington and Stockton, for\r\nthe purpose of running other coaches upon the railroad; and an active\r\ncompetition for passenger traffic sprang up.  \"The Experiment\" being\r\nfound too heavy for one horse to draw, besides being found an\r\nuncomfortable machine, was banished to the coal district.  Its place was\r\nthen supplied by other and better vehicles,--though they were no other\r\nthan old stage-coach bodies purchased by the company, and each mounted\r\nupon an underframe with flange-wheels.  These were let on hire to the\r\ncoaching companies, who horsed and managed them under an arrangement as\r\nto tolls, in like manner as the \"Experiment\" had been worked.  Now began\r\nthe distinction of inside and outside passengers, equivalent to first and\r\nsecond class, paying different fares.  The competition with each other\r\nupon the railway, and with the ordinary stagecoaches upon the road, soon\r\nbrought up the speed, which was increased to ten miles an hour--the\r\nmail-coach rate of travelling in those days, and considered very fast.\r\n\r\nMr. Clephan, a native of the district, has described some of the curious\r\nfeatures of the competition between the rival coach companies:--\"There\r\nwere two separate coach companies in Stockton, and amusing collisions\r\nsometimes occurred between the drivers--who found on the rail a novel\r\nelement for contention.  Coaches cannot pass each other on the rail as on\r\nthe road; and, as the line was single, with four sidings in the mile,\r\nwhen two coaches met, or two trains, or coach and train, the question\r\narose which of the drivers must go back?  This was not always settled in\r\nsilence.  As to trains, it came to be a sort of understanding that empty\r\nshould give way to loaded waggons; and as to trains and coaches, that the\r\npassengers should have preference over coals; while coaches, when they\r\nmet, must quarrel it out.  At length, midway between sidings, a post was\r\nerected, and a rule was laid down that he who had passed the pillar must\r\ngo on, and the 'coming man' go back.  At the Goose Pool and Early Nook,\r\nit was common for these coaches to stop; and there, as Jonathan would\r\nsay, passengers and coachmen 'liquored.'  One coach, introduced by an\r\ninnkeeper, was a compound of two mourning-coaches,--an approximation to\r\nthe real railway-coach, which still adheres, with multiplying exceptions,\r\nto the stage-coach type.  One Dixon, who drove the 'Experiment' between\r\nDarlington and Shildon, is the inventor of carriage-lighting on the rail.\r\nOn a dark winter night, having compassion on his passengers, he would buy\r\na penny candle, and place it lighted amongst them on the table of the\r\n'Experiment'--the first railway-coach (which, by the way, ended its days\r\nat Shildon as a railway cabin), being also the first coach on the rail\r\n(first, second, and third class jammed all into one) that indulged its\r\ncustomers with light in darkness.\"\r\n\r\nThe traffic of all sorts increased so steadily and so rapidly that\r\nconsiderable difficulty was experienced in working it satisfactorily.  It\r\nhad been provided by the first Stockton and Darlington Act that the line\r\nshould be free to all parties who chose to use it at certain prescribed\r\nrates, and that any person might put horses and waggons on the railway,\r\nand carry for himself.  But this arrangement led to increasing confusion\r\nand difficulty, and could not continue in the face of a large and\r\nrapidly-increasing traffic.  The goods trains got so long that the\r\ncarriers found it necessary to call in the aid of the locomotive engine\r\nto help them on their way.  Then mixed trains of passengers and\r\nmerchandise began to run; and the result was that the railway company\r\nfound it necessary to take the entire charge and working of the traffic.\r\nIn course of time new coaches were specially built for the better\r\naccommodation of the public, until at length regular passenger-trains\r\nwere run, drawn by the locomotive engine,--though this was not until\r\nafter the Liverpool and Manchester Company had established this as a\r\ndistinct branch of their traffic.\r\n\r\n                [Picture: The No. I. Engine at Darlington]\r\n\r\nThe three Stephenson locomotives were from the first regularly employed\r\nto work the coal trains; and their proved efficiency for this purpose led\r\nto the gradual increase of the locomotive power.  The speed of the\r\nengines--slow though it seems now--was in those days regarded as\r\nsomething marvellous.  A race actually came off between No. I. engine,\r\nthe \"Locomotion,\" and one of the stage-coaches travelling from Darlington\r\nto Stockton by the ordinary road; and it was regarded as a great triumph\r\nof mechanical skill that the locomotive reached Stockton first, beating\r\nthe stage-coach by about a hundred yards!  The same engine continued in\r\ngood working order in the year 1846, when it headed the railway\r\nprocession on the opening of the Middlesborough and Redcar Railway,\r\ntravelling at the rate of about fourteen miles an hour.  This engine, the\r\nfirst that travelled upon the first public railway, has recently been\r\nplaced upon a pedestal in front of the railway station at Darlington.\r\n\r\nFor some years, however, the principal haulage of the line was performed\r\nby horses.  The inclination of the gradients being towards the sea, this\r\nwas perhaps the cheapest mode of traction, so long as the traffic was not\r\nvery large.  The horse drew the train along the level road, until, on\r\nreaching a descending gradient, down which the train ran by its own\r\ngravity, the animal was unharnessed, and, when loose, he wheeled round to\r\nthe other end of the waggons, to which a \"dandy-cart\" was attached, its\r\nbottom being only a few inches from the rail.  Bringing his step into\r\nunison with the speed of the train, the horse learnt to leap nimbly into\r\nhis place in this waggon, which was usually fitted with a well-filled\r\nhay-rack.\r\n\r\nThe details of the working were gradually perfected by experience, the\r\nprojectors of the line being scarcely conscious at first of the\r\nimportance and significance of the work which they had taken in hand, and\r\nlittle thinking that they were laying the foundations of a system which\r\nwas yet to revolutionise the internal communications of the world, and\r\nconfer the greatest blessings on mankind.  It is important to note that\r\nthe commercial results of the enterprise were considered satisfactory\r\nfrom the opening of the railway.  Besides conferring a great public\r\nbenefit upon the inhabitants of the district and throwing open entirely\r\nnew markets for coal, the profits derived from the traffic created by the\r\nrailway yielded increasing dividends to those who had risked their\r\ncapital in the undertaking, and thus held forth an encouragement to the\r\nprojectors of railways generally, which was not without an important\r\neffect in stimulating the projection of similar enterprises in other\r\ndistricts.  These results, as displayed in the annual dividends, must\r\nhave been eminently encouraging to the astute commercial men of Liverpool\r\nand Manchester, who were then engaged in the prosecution of their\r\nrailway.  Indeed, the commercial success of the Stockton and Darlington\r\nCompany may be justly characterised as the turning-point of the railway\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, we cannot avoid alluding to one of its most\r\nremarkable and direct results--the creation of the town of\r\nMiddlesborough-on-Tees.  When the railway was opened in 1825, the site of\r\nthis future metropolis of Cleveland was occupied by one solitary\r\nfarmhouse and its outbuildings.  All round was pasture-land or mud-banks;\r\nscarcely another house was within sight.  In 1829 some of the principal\r\nproprietors of the railway joined in the purchase of about 500 or 600\r\nacres of land five miles below Stockton--the site of the modern\r\nMiddlesborough--for the purpose of there forming a new seaport for the\r\nshipment of coals brought to the Tees by the railway.  The line was\r\naccordingly extended thither; docks were excavated; a town sprang up;\r\nchurches, chapels, and schools were built, with a custom-house,\r\nmechanics' institute, banks, shipbuilding yards, and iron-factories.  In\r\nten years a busy population of some 6000 persons (since increased to\r\nabout 23,000) occupied the site of the original farmhouse. {144}  More\r\nrecently, the discovery of vast stores of ironstone in the Cleveland\r\nHills, closely adjoining Middlesborough, has tended still more rapidly to\r\naugment the population and increase the commercial importance of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to relate, in connexion with this great work--the Stockton\r\nand Darlington Railway, projected by Edward Pease and executed by George\r\nStephenson--that when Mr. Stephenson became a prosperous and a celebrated\r\nman, he did not forget the friend who had taken him by the hand, and\r\nhelped him on in his early days.  He continued to remember Mr. Pease with\r\ngratitude and affection, and that gentleman, to the close of his life,\r\nwas proud to exhibit a handsome gold watch, received as a gift from his\r\ncelebrated _protege_, bearing these words;--\"Esteem and gratitude: from\r\nGeorge Stephenson to Edward Pease.\"\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Middlesborough-on-Tees]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY PROJECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of the trade and manufactures of South Lancashire gave\r\nrise, about the year 1821, to the project of a tramroad for the\r\nconveyance of goods between Liverpool and Manchester.  Since the\r\nconstruction of the Bridgewater Canal by Brindley, some fifty years\r\nbefore, the increase in the business transacted between the two towns had\r\nbecome quite marvellous.  The steam-engine, the spinning-jenny, and the\r\ncanal, working together, had accumulated in one focus a vast aggregate of\r\npopulation, manufactures, and trade.\r\n\r\nSuch was the expansion of business caused by the inventions to which we\r\nhave referred, that the navigation was found altogether inadequate to\r\naccommodate the traffic, which completely outgrew all the Canal\r\nCompanies' appliances of wharves, boats, and horses.  Cotton lay at\r\nLiverpool for weeks together, waiting to be removed; and it occupied a\r\nlonger time to transport the cargoes from Liverpool to Manchester than it\r\nhad done to bring them across the Atlantic from the United States to\r\nEngland.  Carts and waggons were tried, but proved altogether\r\ninsufficient.  Sometimes manufacturing operations had to be suspended\r\naltogether, and during a frost, when the canals were frozen up, the\r\ncommunication was entirely stopped.  The consequences were often\r\ndisastrous, alike to operatives, merchants, and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nExpostulation with the Canal Companies was of no use.  They were\r\novercrowded with business at their own prices, and disposed to be very\r\ndictatorial.  When the Duke first constructed his canal, he had to\r\nencounter the fierce opposition of the Irwell and Mersey Navigation,\r\nwhose monopoly his new line of water conveyance threatened to interfere\r\nwith. {147}  But the innovation of one generation often becomes the\r\nobstruction of the next.  The Duke's agents would scarcely listen to the\r\nremonstrances of the Liverpool merchants and Manchester manufacturers,\r\nand the Bridgewater Canal was accordingly, in its turn, denounced as a\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, any new mode of transit between the two towns\r\nwhich offered a reasonable prospect of relief was certain to receive a\r\ncordial welcome.  The scheme of a tramroad was, however, so new and\r\ncomparatively untried, that it is not surprising that the parties\r\ninterested should have hesitated before committing themselves to it.  Mr.\r\nSandars, a Liverpool merchant, was amongst the first to broach the\r\nsubject.  He had suffered in his business, in common with many others,\r\nfrom the insufficiency of the existing modes of communication, and was\r\nready to give consideration to any plan presenting elements of practical\r\nefficiency which proposed a remedy for the generally admitted grievance.\r\nHaving caused inquiry to be made as to the success which had attended the\r\nhaulage of heavy coal-trains by locomotive power on the northern\r\nrailways, he was led to the opinion that the same means might be equally\r\nefficient in conducting the increasing traffic in merchandise between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester.  He ventilated the subject amongst his friends,\r\nand about the beginning of 1821 a committee was formed for the purpose of\r\nbringing the scheme of a railroad before the public.\r\n\r\nThe novel project having become noised abroad, attracted the attention of\r\nthe friends of railways in other quarters.  Tramroads were by no means\r\nnew expedients for the transit of heavy articles.  The Croydon and\r\nWandsworth Railway, laid down by William Jessop as early as the year\r\n1801, had been regularly used for the conveyance of lime and stone in\r\nwaggons hauled by mules or donkeys from Merstham to London.  The sight of\r\nthis humble railroad in 1813 led Sir Richard Phillips in his 'Morning\r\nWalk to Kew' to anticipate the great advantages which would be derived by\r\nthe nation from the general adoption of Blenkinsop's engine for the\r\nconveyance of mails and passengers at ten or even fifteen miles an hour.\r\nIn the same year we find Mr. Lovell Edgworth, who had for fifty years\r\nbeen advocating the superiority of tram or rail roads over common roads,\r\nwriting to James Watt (7th August, 1813): \"I have always thought that\r\nsteam would become the universal lord, and that we should in time scorn\r\npost-horses; an iron railroad would be a cheaper thing than a road upon\r\nthe common construction.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Gray, of Nottingham, was another speculator on the same subject.\r\nThough he was no mechanic nor inventor, he had an enthusiastic belief in\r\nthe powers of the railroad system.  Being a native of Leeds, he had, when\r\na boy, seen Blenkinsop's locomotive at work on the Middleton cogged\r\nrailroad, and from an early period he seems to have entertained almost as\r\nsanguine views on the subject as Sir Richard Phillips.  It would appear\r\nthat Gray was residing in Brussels in 1816, when the project of a canal\r\nfrom Charleroi, for the purpose of connecting Holland with the mining\r\ndistricts of Belgium, was the subject of discussion; and, in conversation\r\nwith Mr. John Cockerill and others, he took the opportunity of advocating\r\nthe superior advantages of a railway.  He was absorbed for some time with\r\nthe preparation of a pamphlet on the subject.  He shut himself up,\r\nsecluded from his wife and relations, declining to give them any\r\ninformation as to his mysterious studies, beyond the assurance that his\r\nscheme \"would revolutionise the whole face of the material world and of\r\nsociety.\"  In 1820 Mr. Gray published the result of his studies in his\r\n'Observations on a General Iron Railway,' in which, with great cogency,\r\nhe urged the superiority of a locomotive railway over common roads and\r\ncanals, pointing out, at the same time, the advantages to all classes of\r\nthe community of this mode of conveyance for merchandise and persons.  In\r\nthis book Mr. Gray suggested a railway between Manchester and Liverpool,\r\n\"which,\" he observed, \"would employ many thousands of the distressed\r\npopulation of Lancashire.\"  The treatise must have met with a ready sale,\r\nas we find that two years later it had passed into a fourth edition.  In\r\n1822 Mr. Gray added diagrams to the book, showing, in one, suggested\r\nlines of railway connecting the principal towns of England, and in\r\nanother, the principal towns of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese speculations show that the subject of railways was gradually\r\nbecoming familiar to the public mind, and that thoughtful men were\r\nanticipating with confidence the adoption of steam-power for the purposes\r\nof railway traction.  At the same time, a still more profitable class of\r\nlabourers was at work--first, men like Stephenson, who were engaged in\r\nimproving the locomotive and making it a practicable and economical\r\nworking power; and next, those like Edward Pease of Darlington, and\r\nJoseph Sandars of Liverpool, who were organising the means of laying down\r\nthe railways.  Mr. William James, of West Bromwich, belonged to the\r\nactive class of projectors.  He was a man of considerable social\r\ninfluence, of an active temperament, and had from an early period taken a\r\nwarm interest in the formation of tramroads.  Acting as land-agent for\r\ngentlemen of property in the mining districts, he had laid down several\r\ntramroads in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, Gloucester, and Bristol;\r\nand he published many pamphlets urging their formation in other places.\r\nAt one period of his life he was a large iron-manufacturer.  The times,\r\nhowever, went against him.  It was thought he was too bold, some\r\nconsidered him even reckless, in his speculations; and he lost almost his\r\nentire fortune.  He continued to follow the business of a land-agent, and\r\nit was while engaged in making a survey for one of his clients in the\r\nneighbourhood of Liverpool early in 1821, that he first heard of the\r\nproject of a railway between that town and Manchester.  He at once called\r\nupon Mr. Sandars, and offered his services as surveyor of the proposed\r\nline, and his offer was accepted.\r\n\r\n   [Picture: Map of Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  (Western Part.)]\r\n\r\n   [Picture: Map of Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  (Eastern Part.)]\r\n\r\nA trial survey was then begun, but it was conducted with great\r\ndifficulty, the inhabitants of the district entertaining the most violent\r\nprejudices against the scheme. In some places Mr. James and his surveying\r\nparty even encountered personal violence. The farmers stationed men at\r\nthe field-gates with pitchforks, and sometimes with guns, to drive them\r\nback. At St. Helen's, one of the chainmen was laid hold of by a mob of\r\ncolliers, and threatened to be hurled down a coal-pit. A number of men,\r\nwomen, and children, collected and ran after the surveyors wherever they\r\nmade their appearance, bawling nicknames and throwing stones at them. As\r\none of the chainmen was climbing over a gate one day, a labourer made at\r\nhim with a pitchfork, and ran it through his clothes into his back; other\r\nwatchers running up, the chainman, who was more stunned than hurt, took\r\nto his heels and fled. But that mysterious-looking instrument---the\r\ntheodolite---most excited the fury of the natives, who concentrated on\r\nthe man who carried it their fiercest execrations and most offensive\r\nnicknames.\r\n\r\nA powerful fellow, a noted bruiser, was hired by the surveyors to carry\r\nthe instrument, with a view to its protection against all assailants; but\r\none day an equally powerful fellow, a St. Helen's collier, cock of the\r\nwalk in his neighbourhood, made up to the theodolite bearer to wrest it\r\nfrom him by sheer force.  A battle took place, the collier was soundly\r\npummelled, but the natives poured in volleys of stones upon the surveyors\r\nand their instruments, and the theodolite was smashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nAn outline-survey having at length been made, notices were published of\r\nan intended application to Parliament.  In the mean time Mr. James\r\nproceeded to Killingworth to see Stephenson's locomotives at work.\r\nStephenson was not at home at the time, but James saw his engines, and\r\nwas very much struck by their power and efficiency.  He saw at a glance\r\nthe magnificent uses to which the locomotive might be applied.  \"Here,\"\r\nsaid he, \"is an engine that will, before long, effect a complete\r\nrevolution in society.\"  Returning to Moreton-in-the-Marsh, he wrote to\r\nMr. Losh (Stephenson's partner in the patent) expressing his admiration\r\nof the Killingworth engine.  \"It is,\" said he, \"the greatest wonder of\r\nthe age, and the forerunner, as I firmly believe, of the most important\r\nchanges in the internal communications of the kingdom.\"  Shortly after,\r\nMr. James, accompanied by his two sons, made a second journey to\r\nKillingworth, where he met both Losh and Stephenson.  The visitors were\r\nat once taken to where the locomotive was working, and invited to mount\r\nit.  The uncouth and extraordinary appearance of the machine, as it came\r\nsnorting along, was somewhat alarming to the youths, who expressed their\r\nfears lest it should burst; and they were with some difficulty induced to\r\nmount.\r\n\r\nThe engine went through its usual performances, dragging a heavy load of\r\ncoal-waggons at about six miles an hour, with apparent ease, at which Mr.\r\nJames expressed his extreme satisfaction, and declared to Mr. Losh his\r\nopinion that Stephenson \"was the greatest practical genius of the age,\"\r\nand that, \"if he developed the full powers of that engine (the\r\nlocomotive), his fame in the world would rank equal with that of Watt.\"\r\nMr. James informed Stephenson and Losh of his survey of the proposed\r\ntramroad between Liverpool and Manchester, and did not hesitate to state\r\nthat he would thenceforward advocate the construction of a locomotive\r\nrailroad instead of the tramroad which had originally been proposed.\r\n\r\nStephenson and Losh were naturally desirous of enlisting James's good\r\nservices on behalf of their patent locomotive, for as yet it had proved\r\ncomparatively unproductive.  They believed that he might be able so to\r\nadvocate it in influential quarters as to ensure its more extensive\r\nadoption, and with this object they proposed to give him an interest in\r\nthe patent.  Accordingly they assigned him one-fourth of any profits\r\nwhich might be derived from the use of the patent locomotive on any\r\nrailways constructed south of a line drawn across England from Liverpool\r\nto Hull.  The arrangement, however, led to no beneficial results.  Mr.\r\nJames endeavoured to introduce the engine on the Moreton-on-Marsh\r\nRailway; but it was opposed by the engineer of the line, and the attempt\r\nfailed.  He next urged that a locomotive should be sent for trial upon\r\nthe Merstham tramroad; but, anxious though Stephenson was respecting its\r\nextended employment, he was too cautious to risk an experiment which\r\nmight only bring discredit upon the engine; and the Merstham road being\r\nonly laid with cast-iron plates, which would not bear its weight, the\r\ninvitation was declined.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that the first survey of the Liverpool and Manchester line\r\nwas very imperfect, and it was determined to have a second and more\r\ncomplete one made in the following year.  Robert Stephenson was sent over\r\nby his father to Liverpool to assist in this survey.  He was present with\r\nMr. James on the occasion on which he tried to lay out the line across\r\nChat Moss,--a proceeding which was not only difficult but dangerous.  The\r\nMoss was very wet at the time, and only its edges could be ventured on.\r\nMr. James was a heavy, thick-set man; and one day, when endeavouring to\r\nobtain a stand for his theodolite, he felt himself suddenly sinking.  He\r\nimmediately threw himself down, and rolled over and over until he reached\r\nfirm ground again, in a sad mess.  Other attempts which he subsequently\r\nmade to enter upon the Moss for the same purpose, were abandoned for the\r\nsame reason--the want of a solid stand for the theodolite.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th October, 1822, we find Mr. James writing to Mr. Sandars, \"I\r\ncame last night to send my aid, Robert Stephenson, to his father, and\r\nto-morrow I shall pay off Evans and Hamilton, two other assistants.  I\r\nhave now only Messrs. Padley and Clarke to finish the copy of plans for\r\nParliament, which will be done in about a week or nine days' time.\"  It\r\nwould appear however, that, notwithstanding all his exertions, Mr. James\r\nwas unable to complete his plans and estimates in time for the ensuing\r\nSession; and another year was thus lost.  The Railroad Committee became\r\nimpatient at the delay.  Mr. James's financial embarrassments reached\r\ntheir climax; and, what with illness and debt, he was no longer in a\r\nposition to fulfil his promises to the Committee.  They were, therefore,\r\nunder the necessity of calling to their aid some other engineer.\r\n\r\nMr. Sandars had by this time visited George Stephenson at Killingworth,\r\nand, like all who came within reach of his personal influence, was\r\ncharmed with him at first sight.  The energy which he had displayed in\r\ncarrying on the works of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, now\r\napproaching completion; his readiness to face difficulties, and his\r\npractical ability in overcoming them; the enthusiasm which he displayed\r\non the subject of railways and railway locomotion,--concurred in\r\nsatisfying Mr. Sandars that he was, of all men, the best calculated to\r\nhelp forward the Liverpool undertaking at this juncture.  On his return\r\nhe stated this opinion to the Committee, who approved his recommendation,\r\nand George Stephenson was unanimously appointed engineer of the projected\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Mr. Sandars had held to his original purpose\r\nwith great determination and perseverance, and he gradually succeeded in\r\nenlisting on his side an increasing number of influential merchants and\r\nmanufacturers both at Liverpool and Manchester.  Early in 1824 he\r\npublished a pamphlet, in which he strongly urged the great losses and\r\ninterruptions to the trade of the district by the delays in the\r\nforwarding of merchandise; and in the same year he had a Public\r\nDeclaration drawn up, and signed by upwards of 150 of the principal\r\nmerchants of Liverpool, setting forth that they considered \"the present\r\nestablishments for the transport of goods quite inadequate, and that a\r\nnew line of conveyance has become absolutely necessary to conduct the\r\nincreasing trade of the country with speed, certainty, and economy.\"\r\n\r\nA public meeting was then held to consider the best plan to be adopted,\r\nand resolutions were passed in favour of a railroad.  A committee was\r\nappointed to take the necessary measures; but, as if reluctant to enter\r\nupon their arduous struggle with the \"vested interests,\" they first\r\nwaited on Mr. Bradshaw, the Duke of Bridgewater's canal agent, in the\r\nhope of persuading him to increase the means of conveyance, as well as to\r\nreduce the charges; but they were met by an unqualified refusal.  They\r\nsuggested the expediency of a railway, and invited Mr. Bradshaw to become\r\na proprietor of shares in it.  But his reply was--\"All or none!\"  The\r\ncanal proprietors, confident in their imagined security, ridiculed the\r\nproposed railway as a chimera.  It had been spoken about years before,\r\nand nothing had come of it then: it would be the same now.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a better opinion as to the practicability of the\r\nrailroad, a deputation of gentlemen interested in the project proceeded\r\nto Killingworth, to inspect the engines which had been so long in use\r\nthere.  They first went to Darlington, where they found the works of the\r\nStockton line in progress, though still unfinished.  Proceeding next to\r\nKillingworth with Mr. Stephenson, they there witnessed the performances\r\nof his locomotive engines.  The result of their visit was, on the whole,\r\nso satisfactory, that on their report being delivered to the committee at\r\nLiverpool, it was finally determined to form a company of proprietors for\r\nthe construction of a double line of railway between Liverpool and\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nThe first prospectus of the scheme was dated the 29th October, 1824, and\r\nhad attached to it the names of the leading merchants of Liverpool and\r\nManchester.  It was a modest document, very unlike the inflated balloons\r\nwhich were sent up by railway speculators in succeeding years.  It set\r\nforth as its main object the establishment of a safe and cheap mode of\r\ntransit for merchandise, by which the conveyance of goods between the two\r\ntowns would be effected in 5 or 6 hours (instead of 36 hours by the\r\ncanal), whilst the charges would be reduced one-third.  On looking at the\r\nprospectus now, it is curious to note that, while the advantages\r\nanticipated from the carriage of merchandise were strongly insisted upon,\r\nthe conveyance of passengers--which proved to be the chief source of\r\nprofit--was only very cautiously referred to.  \"As a cheap and\r\nexpeditious means of conveyance for travellers,\" says the prospectus in\r\nconclusion, \"the railway holds out the fair prospect of a public\r\naccommodation, the magnitude and importance of which cannot be\r\nimmediately ascertained.\"  The estimated expense of forming the line was\r\nset down at 400,000 pounds,--a sum which was eventually found quite\r\ninadequate.  The subscription list when opened was filled up without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nWhile the project was still under discussion, its promoters, desirous of\r\nremoving the doubts which existed as to the employment of steam power on\r\nthe proposed railway, sent a second deputation to Killingworth for the\r\npurpose of again observing the action of Stephenson's engines.  The\r\ncautious projectors of the railway were not yet quite satisfied; and a\r\nthird journey was made to Killingworth, in January, 1825, by several\r\ngentlemen of the committee, accompanied by practical engineers, for the\r\npurpose of being personal eye-witnesses of what steam-carriages were able\r\nto perform upon a railway.  There they saw a train, consisting of a\r\nlocomotive and loaded waggons, weighing in all 54 tons, travelling at the\r\naverage rate of about 7 miles an hour, the greatest speed being about 9.5\r\nmiles an hour.  But when the engine was run with only one waggon attached\r\ncontaining twenty gentlemen, five of whom were engineers, the speed\r\nattained was from 10 to 12 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the survey was proceeded with, in the face of great\r\nopposition from the proprietors of the lands through which the railway\r\nwas intended to pass.  The prejudices of the farming and labouring\r\nclasses were strongly excited against the persons employed upon the\r\nground, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the levels could be\r\ntaken.  At one place, Stephenson was driven off the ground by the\r\nkeepers, and threatened to be ducked in the pond if found there again.\r\nThe farmers also turned out their men to watch the surveying party, and\r\nprevent them entering upon any lands where they had the power of driving\r\nthem off.\r\n\r\nOne of the proprietors declared that he would order his game-keepers to\r\nshoot or apprehend any persons attempting a survey over his property.\r\nBut one moonlight night a survey was obtained by the following ruse.\r\nSome men, under the orders of the surveying party, were set to fire off\r\nguns in a particular quarter; on which all the game-keepers on the watch\r\nmade off in that direction, and they were drawn away to such a distance\r\nin pursuit of the supposed poachers, as to enable a rapid survey to be\r\nmade during their absence.\r\n\r\nWhen the canal companies found that the Liverpool merchants were\r\ndetermined to proceed with their scheme--that they had completed their\r\nsurvey, and were ready to apply to Parliament for an Act to enable them\r\nto form the railway--they at last reluctantly, and with a bad grace, made\r\novertures of conciliation.  They promised to employ steam-vessels both on\r\nthe Mersey and on the Canal.  One of the companies offered to reduce its\r\nlength by three miles, at a considerable outlay.  At the same time they\r\nmade a show of lowering their rates.  But it was too late; for the\r\nproject of the railway had now gone so far that the promoters (who might\r\nhave been conciliated by such overtures at an earlier period) felt they\r\nwere fully committed to it, and that now they could not well draw back.\r\nBesides, the remedies offered by the canal companies could only have had\r\nthe effect of staving off the difficulty for a brief season,--the\r\nabsolute necessity of forming a new line of communication between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester becoming more urgent from year to year.\r\nArrangements were therefore made for proceeding with the bill in the\r\nparliamentary session of 1825.\r\n\r\nOn this becoming known, the canal companies prepared to resist the\r\nmeasure tooth and nail.  The public were appealed to on the subject;\r\npamphlets were written and newspapers were hired to revile the railway.\r\nIt was declared that its formation would prevent cows grazing and hens\r\nlaying.  The poisoned air from the locomotives would kill birds as they\r\nflew over them, and render the preservation of pheasants and foxes no\r\nlonger possible.  Householders adjoining the projected line were told\r\nthat their houses would be burnt up by the fire thrown from the\r\nengine-chimneys; while the air around would be polluted by clouds of\r\nsmoke.  There would no longer be any use for horses; and if railways\r\nextended, the species would become extinguished, and oats and hay be\r\nrendered unsaleable commodities.  Travelling by rail would be highly\r\ndangerous, and country inns would be ruined.  Boilers would burst and\r\nblow passengers to atoms.  But there was always this consolation to wind\r\nup with--that the weight of the locomotive would completely prevent its\r\nmoving, and that railways, even if made, could _never_ be worked by\r\nsteam-power.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when Mr. Stephenson, at the interviews with counsel, held\r\nprevious to the Liverpool and Manchester bill going into Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, confidently stated his expectation of being able to\r\nimpel his locomotive at the rate of 20 miles an hour, Mr. William\r\nBrougham, who was retained by the promoters to conduct their case,\r\nfrankly told him that if he did not moderate his views, and bring his\r\nengine within a _reasonable_ speed, he would \"inevitably damn the whole\r\nthing, and be himself regarded as a maniac fit only for Bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea thrown out by Stephenson, of travelling at a rate of speed\r\ndouble that of the fastest mail-coach, appeared at the time so\r\npreposterous that he was unable to find any engineer who would risk his\r\nreputation in supporting such \"absurd views.\"  Speaking of his isolation\r\nat the time, he subsequently observed, at a public meeting of railway men\r\nin Manchester: \"He remembered the time when he had very few supporters in\r\nbringing out the railway system--when he sought England over for an\r\nengineer to support him in his evidence before Parliament, and could find\r\nonly one man, James Walker, but was afraid to call that gentleman,\r\nbecause he knew nothing about railways.  He had then no one to tell his\r\ntale to but Mr. Sandars, of Liverpool, who did listen to him, and kept\r\nhis spirits up; and his schemes had at length been carried out only by\r\ndint of sheer perseverance.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson's idea was at that time regarded as but the dream of a\r\nchimerical projector.  It stood before the public friendless, struggling\r\nhard to gain a footing, scarcely daring to lift itself into notice for\r\nfear of ridicule.  The civil engineers generally rejected the notion of a\r\nLocomotive Railway; and when no leading man of the day could be found to\r\nstand forward in support of the Killingworth mechanic, its chances of\r\nsuccess must indeed have been pronounced but small.\r\n\r\nWhen such was the hostility of the civil engineers, no wonder the\r\nreviewers were puzzled.  The 'Quarterly,' in an able article in support\r\nof the projected Liverpool and Manchester Railway,--while admitting its\r\nabsolute necessity, and insisting that there was no choice left but a\r\nrailroad, on which the journey between Liverpool and Manchester, whether\r\nperformed by horses or engines, would always be accomplished \"within the\r\nday,\"--nevertheless scouted the idea of travelling at a greater speed\r\nthan eight or nine miles an hour.  Adverting to a project for forming a\r\nrailway to Woolwich, by which passengers were to be drawn by locomotive\r\nengines, moving with twice the velocity of ordinary coaches, the reviewer\r\nobserved:--\"What can be more palpably absurd and ridiculous than the\r\nprospect held out of locomotives travelling _twice as fast_ as\r\nstagecoaches!  We would as soon expect the people of Woolwich to suffer\r\nthemselves to be fired off upon one of Congreve's ricochet rockets, as\r\ntrust themselves to the mercy of such a machine going at such a rate.  We\r\nwill back old Father Thames against the Woolwich Railway for any sum.  We\r\ntrust that Parliament will, in all railways it may sanction, limit the\r\nspeed to _eight or nine miles an hour_, which we entirely agree with Mr.\r\nSylvester is as great as can be ventured on with safety.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the survey was completed, the plans were deposited, the\r\nrequisite preliminary arrangements were made, and the promoters of the\r\nscheme applied to Parliament for the necessary powers to construct the\r\nrailway.  The Bill went into Committee of the Commons on the 21st of\r\nMarch, 1825.  There was an extraordinary array of legal talent on the\r\noccasion, but especially on the side of the opponents to the measure;\r\ntheir counsel including Mr. (afterwards Baron) Alderson, Mr. (afterwards\r\nBaron) Parke, Mr. Harrison, and Mr. Erle.  The counsel for the bill were\r\nMr. Adam, Mr. Serjeant Spankie, Mr. William Brougham, and Mr. Joy.\r\n\r\nEvidence was taken at great length as to the difficulties and delays in\r\nforwarding raw material of all kinds from Liverpool to Manchester, as\r\nalso in the conveyance of manufactured goods from Manchester to\r\nLiverpool.  The evidence adduced in support of the bill on these grounds\r\nwas overwhelming.  The utter inadequacy of the existing modes of\r\nconveyance to carry on satisfactorily the large and rapidly-growing trade\r\nbetween the two towns was fully proved.  But then came the gist of the\r\npromoter's case--the evidence to prove the practicability of a railroad\r\nto be worked by locomotive power.  Mr. Adam, in his opening speech,\r\nreferred to the cases of the Hetton and the Killingworth railroads, where\r\nheavy goods were safely and economically transported by means of\r\nlocomotive engines.  \"None of the tremendous consequences,\" he observed,\r\n\"have ensued from the use of steam in land carriage that have been\r\nstated.  The horses have not started, nor the cows ceased to give their\r\nmilk, nor have ladies miscarried at the sight of these things going\r\nforward at the rate of four miles and a half an hour.\"  Notwithstanding\r\nthe petition of two ladies alleging the great danger to be apprehended\r\nfrom the bursting of the locomotive boilers, he urged the safety of the\r\nhigh-pressure engine when the boilers were constructed of wrought-iron;\r\nand as to the rate at which they could travel, he expressed his full\r\nconviction that such engines \"could supply force to drive a carriage at\r\nthe rate of five or six miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe taking of the evidence as to the impediments thrown in the way of\r\ntrade and commerce by the existing system extended over a month, and it\r\nwas the 21st of April before the Committee went into the engineering\r\nevidence, which was the vital part of the question.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th George Stephenson was called into the witness-box.  It was\r\nhis first appearance before a Committee of the House of Commons, and he\r\nwell knew what he had to expect.  He was aware that the whole force of\r\nthe opposition was to be directed against him; and if they could break\r\ndown his evidence, the canal monopoly might yet be upheld for a time.\r\nMany years afterwards, when looking back at his position on this trying\r\noccasion, he said:--\"When I went to Liverpool to plan a line from thence\r\nto Manchester, I pledged myself to the directors to attain a speed of 10\r\nmiles an hour.  I said I had no doubt the locomotive might be made to go\r\nmuch faster, but that we had better be moderate at the beginning.  The\r\ndirectors said I was quite right; for that if, when they went to\r\nParliament, I talked of going at a greater rate than 10 miles an hour, I\r\nshould put a cross upon the concern.  It was not an easy task for me to\r\nkeep the engine down to 10 miles an hour, but it must be done, and I did\r\nmy best.  I had to place myself in that most unpleasant of all\r\npositions--the witness-box of a Parliamentary Committee.  I was not long\r\nin it, before I began to wish for a hole to creep out at!  I could not\r\nfind words to satisfy either the Committee or myself.  I was subjected to\r\nthe cross-examination of eight or ten barristers, purposely, as far as\r\npossible, to bewilder me.  Some member of the Committee asked if I was a\r\nforeigner, and another hinted that I was mad.  But I put up with every\r\nrebuff, and went on with my plans, determined not to be put down.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson stood before the Committee to prove what the public\r\nopinion of that day held to be impossible.  The self-taught mechanic had\r\nto demonstrate the practicability of accomplishing that which the most\r\ndistinguished engineers of the time regarded as impracticable.  Clear\r\nthough the subject was to himself, and familiar as he was with the powers\r\nof the locomotive, it was no easy task for him to bring home his\r\nconvictions, or even to convey his meaning, to the less informed minds of\r\nhis hearers.  In his strong Northumbrian dialect, he struggled for\r\nutterance, in the face of the sneers, interruptions, and ridicule of the\r\nopponents of the measure, and even of the Committee, some of whom shook\r\ntheir heads and whispered doubts as to his sanity, when he energetically\r\navowed that he could make the locomotive go at the rate of 12 miles an\r\nhour!  It was so grossly in the teeth of all the experience of honourable\r\nmembers, that the man \"must certainly be labouring under a delusion!\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet his large experience of railways and locomotives, as described by\r\nhimself to the Committee, entitled this \"untaught, inarticulate genius,\"\r\nas he has so well been styled, to speak with confidence on such a\r\nsubject.  Beginning with his experience as a brakesman at Killingworth in\r\n1803, he went on to state that he was appointed to take the entire charge\r\nof the steam-engines in 1813, and had superintended the railroads\r\nconnected with the numerous collieries of the Grand Allies from that time\r\ndownwards.  He had laid down or superintended the railways at Burradon,\r\nMount Moor, Springwell, Bedlington, Hetton, and Darlington, besides\r\nimproving those at Killingworth, South Moor, and Derwent Crook.  He had\r\nconstructed fifty-five steam-engines, of which sixteen were locomotives.\r\nSome of these had been sent to France.  The engines constructed by him\r\nfor the working of the Killingworth Railroad, eleven years before, had\r\ncontinued steadily at work ever since, and fulfilled his most sanguine\r\nexpectations.  He was prepared to prove the safety of working\r\nhigh-pressure locomotives on a railroad, and the superiority of this mode\r\nof transporting goods over all others.  As to speed, he said he had\r\nrecommended 8 miles an hour with 20 tons, and 4 miles an hour with 40\r\ntons; but he was quite confident that much more might be done.  Indeed,\r\nhe had no doubt they might go at the rate of 12 miles.  As to the charge\r\nthat locomotives on a railroad would so terrify the horses in the\r\nneighbourhood, that to travel on horseback or to plough the adjoining\r\nfields would be rendered highly dangerous, the witness said that horses\r\nlearnt to take no notice of them, though there _were_ horses that would\r\nshy at a wheelbarrow.  A mail-coach was likely to be more shied at by\r\nhorses than a locomotive.  In the neighbourhood of Killingworth, the\r\ncattle in the fields went on grazing while the engines passed them, and\r\nthe farmers made no complaints.\r\n\r\nMr. Alderson, who had carefully studied the subject, and was well skilled\r\nin practical science, subjected the witness to a protracted and severe\r\ncross-examination as to the speed and power of the locomotive, the stroke\r\nof the piston, the slipping of the wheels upon the rails, and various\r\nother points of detail.  Mr. Stephenson insisted that no slipping took\r\nplace, as attempted to be extorted from him by the counsel.  He said, \"It\r\nis impossible for slipping to take place so long as the adhesive weight\r\nof the wheel upon the rail is greater than the weight to be dragged after\r\nit.\"  As to accidents, Stephenson said he knew of none that had occurred\r\nwith his engines.  There had been one, he was told, at the Middleton\r\nColliery, near Leeds, with a Blenkinsop engine.  The driver had been in\r\nliquor, and put a considerable load on the safety-valve, so that upon\r\ngoing forward the engine blew up and the man was killed.  But he added,\r\nif proper precautions had been used with that boiler, the accident could\r\nnot have happened.  The following cross-examination occurred in reference\r\nto the question of speed:--\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he was asked, \"when a body is moving upon a road, the\r\ngreater the velocity the greater the momentum that is generated?\"\r\n\"Certainly.\"--\"What would be the momentum of 40 tons moving at the rate\r\nof 12 miles an hour?\"  \"It would be very great.\"--\"Have you seen a\r\nrailroad that would stand that?\"  \"Yes.\"--\"Where?\"  \"Any railroad that\r\nwould bear going 4 miles an hour: I mean to say, that if it would bear\r\nthe weight at 4 miles an hour, it would bear it at 12.\"--\"Taking it at 4\r\nmiles an hour, do you mean to say that it would not require a stronger\r\nrailway to carry the same weight 12 miles an hour?\"  \"I will give an\r\nanswer to that.  I dare say every person has been over ice when skating,\r\nor seen persons go over, and they know that it would bear them better at\r\na greater velocity than it would if they went slower; when they go quick,\r\nthe weight in a measure ceases.\"--\"Is not that upon the hypothesis that\r\nthe railroad is perfect?\"  \"It is; and I mean to make it perfect.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to state that to have passed the ordeal of so severe\r\na cross-examination scatheless, needed no small amount of courage,\r\nintelligence, and ready shrewdness on the part of the witness.  Nicholas\r\nWood, who was present on the occasion, has since stated that the point on\r\nwhich Stephenson was hardest pressed was that of speed.  \"I believe,\" he\r\nsays, \"that it would have lost the Company their bill if he had gone\r\nbeyond 8 or 9 miles an hour.  If he had stated his intention of going 12\r\nor 15 miles an hour, not a single person would have believed it to be\r\npracticable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee also seem to have entertained considerable alarm as to the\r\nhigh rate of speed which had been spoken of, and proceeded to examine the\r\nwitness further on the subject.  They supposed the case of the engine\r\nbeing upset when going at 9 miles an hour, and asked what, in such a\r\ncase, would become of the cargo astern.  To which the witness replied\r\nthat it would not be upset.  One of the members of the Committee pressed\r\nthe witness a little further.  He put the following case:--\"Suppose, now,\r\none of these engines to be going along a railroad at the rate of 9 or 10\r\nmiles an hour, and that a cow were to stray upon the line and get in the\r\nway of the engine; would not that, think you, be a very awkward\r\ncircumstance?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the witness, with a twinkle in his eye,\r\n\"very awkward--_for the coo_!\"  The honourable member did not proceed\r\nfurther with his cross-examination; to use a railway phrase, he was\r\n\"shunted.\"  Another asked if animals would not be very much frightened by\r\nthe engine passing them, especially by the glare of the red-hot chimney?\r\n\"But how would they know that it wasn't painted?\" said the witness.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the engineer was subjected to a very severe\r\nexamination.  On that part of the scheme with which he was most\r\npractically conversant, his evidence was clear and conclusive.  Now, he\r\nhad to give evidence on the plans made by his surveyors, and the\r\nestimates which had been founded on such plans.  So long as he was\r\nconfined to locomotive engines and iron railroads, with the minutest\r\ndetails of which he was more familiar than any man living, he felt at\r\nhome, and in his element.  But when the designs of bridges and the cost\r\nof constructing them had to be gone into, the subject being in a great\r\nmeasure new to him, his evidence was much less satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMr. Alderson cross-examined him at great length on the plans of the\r\nbridges, the tunnels, the crossings of the roads and streets, and the\r\ndetails of the survey, which, it soon clearly appeared, were in some\r\nrespects seriously at fault.  It seems that, after the plans had been\r\ndeposited, Stephenson found that a much more favourable line might be\r\nmade; and he made his estimates accordingly, supposing that Parliament\r\nwould not confine the Company to the precise plan which had been\r\ndeposited.  This was felt to be a serious blot in the parliamentary case,\r\nand one very difficult to be got over.\r\n\r\nFor three entire days was our engineer subjected to this\r\ncross-examination.  He held his ground bravely, and defended the plans\r\nand estimates with remarkable ability and skill; but it was clear they\r\nwere imperfect, and the result was on the whole damaging to the measure.\r\n\r\nThe case of the opponents was next gone into, in the course of which the\r\ncounsel indulged in strong vituperation against the witnesses for the\r\nbill.  One of them spoke of the utter impossiblity of making a railway\r\nupon so treacherous a material as Chat Moss, which was declared to be an\r\nimmense mass of pulp, and nothing else.  \"It actually,\" said Mr.\r\nHarrison, \"rises in height, from the rain swelling it like a sponge, and\r\nsinks again in dry weather; and if a boring instrument is put into it, it\r\nsinks immediately by its own weight.  The making of an embankment out of\r\nthis pulpy, wet moss, is no very easy task.  Who but Mr. Stephenson would\r\nhave thought of entering into Chat Moss, carrying it out almost like wet\r\ndung?  It is ignorance almost inconceivable.  It is perfect madness, in a\r\nperson called upon to speak on a scientific subject, to propose such a\r\nplan.  Every part of this scheme shows that this man has applied himself\r\nto a subject of which he has no knowledge, and to which he has no science\r\nto apply.\"  Then adverting to the proposal to work the intended line by\r\nmeans of locomotives, the learned gentleman proceeded: \"When we set out\r\nwith the original prospectus, we were to gallop, I know not at what rate;\r\nI believe it was at the rate of 12 miles an hour.  My learned friend, Mr.\r\nAdam, contemplated--possibly alluding to Ireland--that some of the Irish\r\nmembers would arrive in the waggons to a division.  My learned friend\r\nsays that they would go at the rate of 12 miles an hour with the aid of\r\nthe devil in the form of a locomotive, sitting as postilion on the fore\r\nhorse, and an honourable member sitting behind him to stir up the fire,\r\nand keep it at full speed.  But the speed at which these locomotive\r\nengines are to go has slackened: Mr. Adam does not go faster now than 5\r\nmiles an hour.  The learned serjeant (Spankie) says he should like to\r\nhave 7, but he would be content to go 6.  I will show he cannot go 6; and\r\nprobably, for any practical purposes, I may be able to show that I can\r\nkeep up with him _by the canal_. . . .  Locomotive engines are liable to\r\nbe operated upon by the weather.  You are told they are affected by rain,\r\nand an attempt has been made to cover them; but the wind will affect\r\nthem; and any gale of wind which would affect the traffic on the Mersey\r\nwould render it _impossible_ to set off a locomotive engine, either by\r\npoking of the fire, or keeping up the pressure of the steam till the\r\nboiler was ready to burst.\"  How amusing it now is to read these\r\nextraordinary views as to the formation of a railway over Chat Moss, and\r\nthe impossibility of starting a locomotive engine in the face of a gale\r\nof wind!\r\n\r\nEvidence was called to show that the house property passed by the\r\nproposed railway would be greatly deteriorated--in some places almost\r\ndestroyed; that the locomotive engines would be terrible nuisances, in\r\nconsequence of the fire and smoke vomited forth by them; and that the\r\nvalue of land in the neighbourhood of Manchester alone would be\r\ndeteriorated by no less than 20,000 pounds!  Evidence was also given at\r\ngreat length showing the utter impossibility of forming a road of any\r\nkind upon Chat Moss.  A Manchester builder, who was examined, could not\r\nimagine the feat possible, unless by arching it across in the manner of a\r\nviaduct from one side to the other.  It was the old story of \"nothing\r\nlike leather.\"  But the opposition mainly relied upon the evidence of the\r\nleading engineers--not like Stephenson, self-taught men, but regular\r\nprofessionals.  One of these, Mr. Francis Giles, C.E., had been\r\ntwenty-two years an engineer, and could speak with some authority.  His\r\ntestimony was mainly directed to the utter impossibility of forming a\r\nrailway over Chat Moss.  \"_No engineer in his senses_,\" said he, \"would\r\ngo through Chat Moss if he wanted to make a railroad from Liverpool to\r\nManchester. . . .  In my judgment _a railroad certainly cannot be safely\r\nmade over Chat Moss without going to the bottom __of the Moss_.  The soil\r\nought all to be taken out, undoubtedly; in doing which, it will not be\r\npracticable to approach each end of the cutting, as you make it, with the\r\ncarriages.  No carriages would stand upon the Moss short of the bottom.\r\nMy estimate for the whole cutting and embankment over Chat Moss is\r\n270,000 pounds nearly, at those quantities and those prices which are\r\ndecidedly correct . . . It will be necessary to take this Moss completely\r\nout at the bottom, in order to make a solid road.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the engineers had given their evidence, Mr. Alderson summed up in a\r\nspeech which extended over two days.  He declared Mr. Stephenson's plan\r\nto be \"the most absurd scheme that ever entered into the head of man to\r\nconceive.  My learned friends,\" said he, \"almost endeavoured to stop my\r\nexamination; they wished me to put in the plan, but I had rather have the\r\nexhibition of Mr. Stephenson in that box.  I say he never had a plan--I\r\nbelieve he never had one--I do not believe he is capable of making one.\r\nHis is a mind perpetually fluctuating between opposite difficulties: he\r\nneither knows whether he is to make bridges over roads or rivers, of one\r\nsize or of another; or to make embankments, or cuttings, or inclined\r\nplanes, or in what way the thing is to be carried into effect.  Whenever\r\na difficulty is pressed, as in the case of a tunnel, he gets out of it at\r\none end, and when you try to catch him at that, he gets out at the\r\nother.\"  Mr. Alderson proceeded to declaim against the gross ignorance of\r\nthis so-called engineer, who proposed to make \"impossible ditches by the\r\nside of an impossible railway\" upon Chat Moss; \"I care not,\" he said,\r\n\"whether Mr. Giles is right or wrong in his estimate, for whether it be\r\neffected by means of piers raised up all the way for four miles through\r\nChat Moss, whether they are to support it on beams of wood or by erecting\r\nmasonry, or whether Mr. Giles shall put a solid bank of earth through\r\nit,--in all these schemes there is not one found like that of Mr.\r\nStephenson's, namely, to cut impossible drains on the side of this road;\r\nand it is sufficient for me to suggest and to show, that this scheme of\r\nMr. Stephenson's is impossible or impracticable, and that no other\r\nscheme, if they proceed upon this line, can be suggested which will not\r\nproduce enormous expense.  I think that has been irrefragably made out.\r\nEvery one knows Chat Moss--every one knows that the iron sinks\r\nimmediately on its being put upon the surface.  I have heard of culverts,\r\nwhich have been put upon the Moss, which, after having been surveyed the\r\nday before, have the next morning disappeared; and that a house (a poet's\r\nhouse, who may be supposed in the habit of building castles even in the\r\nair), story after story, as fast as one is added, the lower one sinks!\r\nThere is nothing, it appears, except long sedgy grass, and a little soil\r\nto prevent its sinking into the shades of eternal night.  I have now\r\ndone, sir, with Chat Moss, and there I leave this railroad.\"\r\n\r\nThe case of the principal petitioners against the bill occupied many more\r\ndays, and on its conclusion the committee proceeded to divide on the\r\npreamble, which was carried by a majority of only _one_--37 voting for\r\nit, and 36 against it.  The clauses were next considered, and on a\r\ndivision the first clause, empowering the Company to make the railway,\r\nwas lost by a majority of 19 to 13.  In like manner, the next clause,\r\nempowering the Company to take land, was lost; on which the bill was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nThus ended this memorable contest, which had extended over two\r\nmonths--carried on throughout with great pertinacity and skill,\r\nespecially on the part of the opposition, who left no stone unturned to\r\ndefeat the measure.  The want of a third line of communication between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester had been clearly proved; but the engineering\r\nevidence in support of the proposed railway having been thrown almost\r\nentirely upon Stephenson, who fought this, the most important part of the\r\nbattle, single-handed, was not brought out so clearly as it would have\r\nbeen, had he secured more efficient engineering assistance--which he was\r\nnot able to do, as the principal engineers of that day were against the\r\nlocomotive railway.  The obstacles thrown in the way of the survey by the\r\nlandowners and canal companies, by which the plans were rendered\r\nexceedingly imperfect, also tended in a great measure to defeat the bill.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of the bill was probably the most severe trial George\r\nStephenson underwent in the whole course of his life.  The circumstances\r\nconnected with the defeat of the measure, the errors in the levels, his\r\nrigid cross-examination, followed by the fact of his being superseded by\r\nanother engineer, all told fearfully upon him, and for some time he was\r\nas much weighed down as if a personal calamity of the most serious kind\r\nhad befallen him.\r\n\r\nStephenson had been so terribly abused by the leading counsel for the\r\nopposition in the course of the proceedings before the\r\nCommittee--stigmatised by them as an ignoramus, a fool, and a\r\nmaniac--that even his friends seem for a time to have lost faith in him\r\nand in the locomotive system, whose efficiency he nevertheless continued\r\nto uphold.  Things never looked blacker for the success of the railway\r\nsystem than at the close of this great parliamentary struggle.  And yet\r\nit was on the very eve of its triumph.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Directors appointed to watch the measure in Parliament\r\nwere so determined to press on the project of a railway, even though it\r\nshould have to be worked merely by horse-power, that the bill had\r\nscarcely been thrown out ere they met in London to consider their next\r\nstep.  They called their parliamentary friends together to consult as to\r\nfuture proceedings; and the result was that they went back to Liverpool\r\ndetermined to renew their application to Parliament in the ensuing\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIt was not considered desirable to employ Mr. Stephenson in making the\r\nnew survey.  He had not as yet established his reputation as an engineer\r\nbeyond the boundaries of his own district; and the promoters of the bill\r\nhad doubtless felt the disadvantages of this in the course of their\r\nparliamentary struggle.  They therefore resolved now to employ engineers\r\nof the highest established reputation, as well as the best surveyors that\r\ncould be obtained.  In accordance with these views they engaged Messrs.\r\nGeorge and John Rennie to be the engineers of the railway; and Mr.\r\nCharles Vignolles was appointed to prepare the plans and sections.  The\r\nline which was eventually adopted differed somewhat from that surveyed by\r\nMr. Stephenson.  The principal parks and game-preserves of the district\r\nwere carefully avoided.  The promoters thus hoped to get rid of the\r\nopposition of the most influential of the resident landowners.  The\r\ncrossing of certain of the streets of Liverpool was also avoided, and the\r\nentrance contrived by means of a tunnel and an inclined plane.  The new\r\nline stopped short of the river Irwell at the Manchester end, by which\r\nthe objections grounded on an illegal interruption to the canal or river\r\ntraffic were in some measure removed.  The opposition of the Duke of\r\nBridgewater's trustees was also got rid of, and the Marquis of Stafford\r\nbecame a subscriber for a thousand shares.  With reference to the use of\r\nthe locomotive engine, the promoters, remembering with what effect the\r\nobjections to it had been urged by the opponents of the bill, intimated,\r\nin their second prospectus, that \"as a guarantee of their good faith\r\ntowards the public they will not require any clause empowering them to\r\nuse it; or they will submit to such restrictions in the employment of it\r\nas Parliament may impose.\"\r\n\r\nThe survey of the new line having been completed, the plans were\r\ndeposited, the standing orders duly complied with, and the bill went\r\nbefore Parliament.  The same counsel appeared for the promoters, but the\r\nexamination of witnesses was not nearly so protracted as on the previous\r\noccasion.  The preamble was declared proved by a majority of 43 to 18.\r\nOn the third reading in the House of Commons, an animated, and what now\r\nappears a very amusing discussion took place.  The Hon. Edward Stanley\r\nmoved that the bill be read that day six months; and in his speech he\r\nundertook to prove that the railway trains would take _ten hours_ on the\r\njourney, and that they could only be worked by horses.  Sir Isaac Coffin\r\nseconded the motion, and in doing so denounced the project as a most\r\nflagrant imposition.  He would not consent to see widows' premises\r\ninvaded; and \"What, he would like to know, was to be done with all those\r\nwho had advanced money in making and repairing turnpike-roads?  What was\r\nto become of coach-makers and harness-makers, coach-masters and coachmen,\r\ninn-keepers, horse-breeders, and horse-dealers?  Was the house aware of\r\nthe smoke and the noise, the hiss and the whirl, which locomotive\r\nengines, passing at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour, would occasion?\r\nNeither the cattle ploughing in the fields or grazing in the meadows\r\ncould behold them without dismay.  Iron would be raised in price 100 per\r\ncent., or more probably exhausted altogether!  It would be the greatest\r\nnuisance, the most complete disturbance of quiet and comfort in all parts\r\nof the kingdom, that the ingenuity of man could invent!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huskisson and other speakers, though unable to reply to such\r\narguments as these, strongly supported the bill; and it was carried on\r\nthe third reading by a majority of 88 to 41.  The bill passed the House\r\nof Lords almost unanimously, its only opponents being the Earl of Derby\r\nand his relative the Earl of Wilton.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Surveying on Chat Moss]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nCHAT MOSS--CONSTRUCTION OF THE RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appointment of principal engineer to the railway was taken into\r\nconsideration at the first meeting of the directors held at Liverpool\r\nsubsequent to the passing of the Act.  The magnitude of the proposed\r\nworks, and the vast consequences involved in their experiment, were\r\ndeeply impressed upon their minds; and they resolved to secure the\r\nservices of a resident engineer of proved experience and ability.  Their\r\nattention was naturally directed to Mr. Stephenson; at the same time they\r\ndesired to have the benefit of the Messrs. Rennie's professional\r\nassistance in superintending the works.  Mr. George Rennie had an\r\ninterview with the Board on the subject, at which he proposed to\r\nundertake the chief superintendence, making six visits in each year, and\r\nstipulating that he should have the appointment of the resident engineer.\r\nBut the responsibility attaching to the direction in the matter of the\r\nefficient carrying on of the works, would not admit of their being\r\ninfluenced by ordinary punctilios on the occasion; and they accordingly\r\ndeclined this proposal, and proceeded to appoint Mr. Stephenson their\r\nprincipal engineer at a salary of 1000 pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nHe at once removed his residence to Liverpool, and made arrangements to\r\ncommence the works.  He began with the \"impossible thing\"--to do that\r\nwhich the most distinguished engineers of the day had declared that \"no\r\nman in his senses would undertake to do\"--namely, to make the road over\r\nChat Moss!  It was indeed a most formidable undertaking; and the project\r\nof carrying a railway along, under, or over such a material as that of\r\nwhich it consisted, would certainly never have occurred to an ordinary\r\nmind.  Michael Drayton supposed the Moss to have had its origin at the\r\nDeluge.  Nothing more impassable could have been imagined than that\r\ndreary waste; and Mr. Giles only spoke the popular feeling of the day\r\nwhen he declared that no carriage could stand on it \"short of the\r\nbottom.\"  In this bog, singular to say, Mr. Roscoe, the accomplished\r\nhistorian of the Medicis, buried his fortune in the hopeless attempt to\r\ncultivate a portion of it which he had bought.\r\n\r\nChat Moss is an immense peat bog of about twelve square miles in extent.\r\nUnlike the bogs or swamps of Cambridge and Lincolnshire, which consist\r\nprincipally of soft mud or silt, this bog is a vast mass of spongy\r\nvegetable pulp, the result of the growth and decay of ages.  The spagni,\r\nor bog-mosses, cover the entire area; one year's growth rising over\r\nanother,--the older growths not entirely decaying, but remaining\r\npartially preserved by the antiseptic properties peculiar to peat.  Hence\r\nthe remarkable fact that, although a semifluid mass, the surface of Chat\r\nMoss rises above the level of the surrounding country.  Like a turtle's\r\nback, it declines from the summit in every direction, having from thirty\r\nto forty feet gradual slope to the solid land on all sides.  From the\r\nremains of trees, chiefly alder and birch, which have been dug out of it,\r\nand which must have previously flourished upon the surface of soil now\r\ndeeply submerged, it is probable that the sand and clay base on which the\r\nbog rests is saucer-shaped, and so retains the entire mass in position.\r\nIn rainy weather, such is its capacity for water that it sensibly swells,\r\nand rises in those parts where the moss is the deepest.  This occurs\r\nthrough the capillary attraction of the fibres of the submerged moss,\r\nwhich is from 20 to 30 feet in depth, whilst the growing plants\r\neffectually check evaporation from the surface.  This peculiar character\r\nof the Moss has presented an insuperable difficulty in the way of\r\nreclaiming it by any system of extensive drainage--such as by sinking\r\nshafts, and pumping up the water by steam power, as has been proposed.\r\nSupposing a shaft of 30 feet deep to be sunk, it has been calculated that\r\nthis would only be effectual for draining a circle of about 100 yards,\r\nthe water running down an incline of about 5 to 1; for it was found in\r\nthe course of draining the bog, that a ditch 3 feet deep only served to\r\ndrain a space of less than 5 yards on each side, and two ditches of this\r\ndepth, 10 yards apart, left a portion of the Moss between them scarcely\r\naffected by the drains.\r\n\r\nThe three resident engineers selected by Mr. Stephenson to superintend\r\nthe construction of the line, were Joseph Locke, William Allcard, and\r\nJohn Dixon.  The last was appointed to that portion which lay across the\r\nMoss, neither of the other two envying his lot.  On Mr. Dixon's arrival,\r\nabout July, 1826, Mr. Locke proceeded to show him over the length he was\r\nto take charge of, and to instal him in office.  When they reached Chat\r\nMoss, Mr. Dixon found that the line had already been staked out and the\r\nlevels taken in detail by the aid of planks laid upon the bog.  The\r\ncutting of the drains along each side of the proposed road had also been\r\ncommenced; but the soft pulpy stuff had up to this time flowed into the\r\ndrains and filled them up as fast as they were cut.  Proceeding across\r\nthe Moss, on the first day's inspection, the new resident, when about\r\nhalfway over, slipped off the plank on which he walked, and sank to his\r\nknees in the bog.  Struggling only sent him the deeper, and he might have\r\ndisappeared altogether, but for the workmen, who hastened to his\r\nassistance upon planks, and rescued him from his perilous position.  Much\r\ndisheartened, he desired to return, and even thought of giving up the\r\njob; but Mr. Locke assured him that the worst part was now past; so the\r\nnew resident plucked up heart again, and both floundered on until they\r\nreached the further edge of the Moss, wet and plastered over with\r\nbog-sludge.  Mr. Dixon's companions endeavoured to comfort him by the\r\nassurance that he might avoid similar perils, by walking upon \"pattens,\"\r\nor boards fastened to the soles of his feet, as they had done when taking\r\nthe levels, and as the workmen did when engaged in making drains in the\r\nsoftest parts of the Moss.  The resident engineer was sorely puzzled in\r\nthe outset by the problem of constructing a road for heavy locomotives,\r\nwith trains of passengers and goods, upon a bog which he had found\r\nincapable of supporting his own weight!\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's idea was, that such a road might be made to _float_ upon\r\nthe bog, simply by means of a sufficient extension of the bearing\r\nsurface.  As a ship, or a raft, capable of sustaining heavy loads floated\r\nin water, so in his opinion, might a light road be floated upon a bog,\r\nwhich was of considerably greater consistency than water.  Long before\r\nthe railway was thought of, Mr. Roscoe had adopted the remarkable\r\nexpedient of fitting his plough-horses with flat wooden soles or pattens,\r\nto enable them to walk upon the Moss land which he had brought into\r\ncultivation.  These pattens were fitted on by means of a screw apparatus,\r\nwhich met in front of the foot and was easily fastened.  The mode by\r\nwhich these pattens served to sustain the horse is capable of easy\r\nexplanation, and it will be observed that the _rationale_ likewise\r\nexplains the floating of a railway train.  The foot of an ordinary\r\nfarm-horse presents a base of about five inches diameter, but if this\r\nbase be enlarged to seven inches--the circles being to each other as the\r\nsquares of the diameters--it will be found that, by this slight\r\nenlargement of the base, a circle of nearly double the area has been\r\nsecured; and consequently the pressure of the foot upon every unit of\r\nground upon which the horse stands has been reduced one half.  In fact,\r\nthis contrivance has an effect tantamount to setting the horse upon eight\r\nfeet instead of four.\r\n\r\nApply the same reasoning to the ponderous locomotive, and it will be\r\nfound, that even such a machine may be made to stand upon a bog, by means\r\nof a similar extension of the bearing surface.  Suppose the engine to be\r\n20 feet long and 5 feet wide, thus covering a surface of 100 square feet,\r\nand, provided the bearing has been extended by means of cross sleepers\r\nsupported on a matting of heath and branches of trees covered with a few\r\ninches of gravel, the pressure of an engine of 20 tons will be only equal\r\nto about 3 pounds per inch over the whole surface on which it stands.\r\nSuch was George Stephenson's idea in contriving his floating\r\nroad--something like an elongated raft across the Moss; and we shall see\r\nthat he steadily kept it in view in carrying the work into execution.\r\n\r\nThe first thing done was to form a footpath of ling or heather along the\r\nproposed road, on which a man might walk without risk of sinking.  A\r\nsingle line of temporary railway was then laid down, formed of ordinary\r\ncross-bars about 3 feet long and an inch square, with holes punched\r\nthrough them at the ends and nailed down to temporary sleepers.  Along\r\nthis way ran the waggons in which were conveyed the materials requisite\r\nto form the permanent road.  These waggons carried about a ton each, and\r\nthey were propelled by boys running behind them along the narrow iron\r\nrails.  The boys became so expert that they would run the 4 miles across\r\nat the rate of 7 or 8 miles an hour without missing a step; if they had\r\ndone so, they would have sunk in many places up to their middle.  A\r\ncomparatively slight extension of the bearing surface being found\r\nsufficient to enable the bog to bear this temporary line, the\r\ncircumstance was a source of increased confidence and hope to our\r\nengineer in proceeding with the formation of the permanent roadway\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\nThe digging of drains had been proceeding for some time along each side\r\nof the intended line; but they filled up almost as soon as dug, the sides\r\nflowing in, and the bottom rising up.  It was only in some of the drier\r\nparts of the bog that a depth of three or four feet could be reached.\r\nThe surface-ground between the drains, containing the intertwined roots\r\nof heather and long grass, was left untouched, and upon this was spread\r\nbranches of trees and hedge-cuttings.  In the softest places, rude gates\r\nor hurdles, some 8 or 9 feet long by 4 feet wide, interwoven with\r\nheather, were laid in double thicknesses, their ends overlapping each\r\nother; and upon this floating bed was spread a thin layer of gravel, on\r\nwhich the sleepers, chairs, and rails were laid in the usual manner.\r\nSuch was the mode in which the road was formed upon the Moss.\r\n\r\nIt was found, however, after the permanent way had been thus laid, that\r\nthere was a tendency to sinking at those parts where the bog was softest.\r\nIn ordinary cases, where a bank subsides, the sleepers are packed up with\r\nballast or gravel; but in this case the ballast was dug away and removed\r\nin order to lighten the road, and the sleepers were packed instead with\r\ncakes of dry turf or bundles of heath.  By these expedients the subsided\r\nparts were again floated up to the level, and an approach was made\r\ntowards a satisfactory road.  But the most formidable difficulties were\r\nencountered at the centre and towards the edges of the Moss; and it\r\nrequired no small degree of ingenuity and perseverance on the part of the\r\nengineer successfully to overcome them.\r\n\r\nThe Moss, as already observed, was highest in the centre, and it there\r\npresented a sort of hunchback with a rising and falling gradient.  At\r\nthat point it was found necessary to cut deeper drains in order to\r\nconsolidate the ground between them on which the road was to be formed.\r\nBut, as at other places, the deeper the cutting the more rapid was the\r\nflow of fluid bog into the drain, the bottom rising up almost as fast as\r\nit was removed.  To meet this emergency, numbers of empty tar-barrels\r\nwere brought from Liverpool; and as soon as a few yards of drain were\r\ndug, the barrels were laid down end to end, firmly fixed to each other by\r\nstrong slabs laid over the joints, and nailed.  They were then covered\r\nover with clay, and thus formed an underground sewer of wood instead of\r\nbricks.  This expedient was found to answer the purpose intended, and the\r\nroad across the centre of the Moss having been so prepared, it was then\r\nlaid with the permanent materials.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty was, however, experienced in forming an\r\nembankment upon the edge of the bog at the Manchester end.  Moss as dry\r\nas it could be cut, was brought up in small waggons, by men and boys, and\r\nemptied so as to form an embankment; but the bank had scarcely been\r\nraised three or four feet in height, when the stuff broke through the\r\nheathery surface of the bog and sank out of sight.  More moss was brought\r\nup and emptied with no better result; and for weeks the filling was\r\ncontinued without any visible embankment having been made.  It was the\r\nduty of the resident engineer to proceed to Liverpool every fortnight to\r\nobtain the wages for the workmen employed under him; and on these\r\noccasions he was required to colour up, on a section drawn to a working\r\nscale suspended against the wall of the directors' room, the amount of\r\nexcavation and embankment from time to time executed.  But on many of\r\nthese occasions, Mr. Dixon had no progress whatever to show for the money\r\nexpended on the Chat Moss embankment.  Sometimes, indeed, the visible\r\nwork done was _less_ than it had appeared a fortnight or a month before!\r\n\r\nThe directors now became seriously alarmed, and feared that the evil\r\nprognostications of the eminent engineers were about to be fulfilled.\r\nThe resident engineer was even called upon to supply an estimate of the\r\ncost of forming an embankment of solid stuff throughout, as also of the\r\ncost of piling the roadway, and in effect constructing a four mile\r\nviaduct of timber across the Moss, from twenty to thirty feet high from\r\nthe foundation.  The expense appalled the directors, and the question\r\narose, whether the work was to be proceeded with or _abandoned_!\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson afterwards described the alarming position of affairs at a\r\npublic dinner at Birmingham (23rd December, 1837), on the occasion of a\r\npiece of plate being presented to his son, upon the completion of the\r\nLondon and Birmingham Railway.  He related the anecdote, he said, for the\r\npurpose of impressing upon the minds of those who heard him the necessity\r\nof perseverance.\r\n\r\n\"After working for weeks and weeks,\" said he, \"in filling in materials to\r\nform the road, there did not yet appear to be the least sign of our being\r\nable to raise the solid embankment one single inch; in short we went on\r\nfilling in without the slightest apparent effect.  Even my assistants\r\nbegan to feel uneasy, and to doubt of the success of the scheme.  The\r\ndirectors, too, spoke of it as a hopeless task: and at length they became\r\nseriously alarmed, so much so, indeed, that a board meeting was held on\r\nChat Moss to decide whether I should proceed any further.  They had\r\npreviously taken the opinion of other engineers, who reported\r\nunfavourably.  There was no help for it, however, but to go on.  An\r\nimmense outlay had been incurred; and great loss would have been\r\noccasioned had the scheme been then abandoned, and the line taken by\r\nanother route.  So the directors were _compelled_ to allow me to go on\r\nwith my plans, of the ultimate success of which I myself never for one\r\nmoment doubted.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this part of the works, the Worsley and Trafford\r\nmen, who lived near the Moss, and plumed themselves upon their practical\r\nknowledge of bog-work, declared the completion of the road to be utterly\r\nimpracticable.  \"If you knew as much about Chat Moss as we do,\" they\r\nsaid, \"you would never have entered on so rash an undertaking; and depend\r\nupon it, all you have done and are doing will prove abortive.  You must\r\ngive up the idea of a floating railway, and either fill the Moss hard\r\nfrom the bottom, or deviate so as to avoid it altogether.\"  Such were the\r\nconclusions of science and experience.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these alarms and prophecies of failure, Stephenson\r\nnever lost heart, but held to his purpose.  His motto was \"Persevere!\"\r\n\"You must go on filling in,\" he said; \"there is no other help for it.\r\nThe stuff emptied in is doing its work out of sight, and if you will but\r\nhave patience, it will soon begin to show.\"  And so the filling in went\r\non; several hundreds of men and boys were employed to skin the Moss all\r\nround for many thousand yards, by means of sharp spades, called by the\r\nturf cutters \"tommy-spades;\" and the dried cakes of turf were afterwards\r\nused to form the embankment, until at length as the stuff sank and rested\r\nupon the bottom, the bank gradually rose above the surface, and slowly\r\nadvanced onwards, declining in height and consequently in weight, until\r\nit became joined to the floating road already laid upon the Moss.  In the\r\ncourse of forming the embankment, the pressure of the bog turf tipped out\r\nof the waggons caused a copious stream of bog-water to flow from the end\r\nof it, in colour resembling Barclay's double stout; and when completed,\r\nthe bank looked like a long ridge of tightly pressed tobacco-leaf.  The\r\ncompression of the turf may be imagined from the fact that 670,000 cubic\r\nyards of raw moss formed only 277,000 cubic yards of embankment at the\r\ncompletion of the work.\r\n\r\nAt the western, or Liverpool end of the Chat Moss, there was a like\r\nembankment; but, as the ground there was solid, little difficulty was\r\nexperienced in forming it, beyond the loss of substance caused by the\r\noozing out of the water held by the moss-earth.\r\n\r\nAt another part of the Liverpool and Manchester line, Parr Moss was\r\ncrossed by an embankment about 1.5 mile in extent.  In the immediate\r\nneighbourhood was found a large excess of cutting, which it would have\r\nbeen necessary to \"put out in spoil-banks\" (according to the technical\r\nphrase); but the surplus clay, stone, and shale, were tipped, waggon\r\nafter waggon, into Parr Moss, until a solid but concealed embankment,\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty-five feet high, was formed, although to the eye it\r\nappears to be laid upon the level of the adjoining surface, as at Chat\r\nMoss.\r\n\r\nThe road across Chat Moss was finished by the 1st January, 1830, when the\r\nfirst experimental train of passengers passed over it, drawn by the\r\n\"Rocket;\" and it turned out that, instead of being the most expensive\r\npart of the line, it was about the cheapest.  The total cost of forming\r\nthe line over the Moss was 28,000 pounds, whereas Mr. Giles's estimate\r\nwas 270,000 pounds!  It also proved to be one of the best portions of the\r\nrailway.  Being a floating road, it was smooth and easy to run upon, just\r\nas Dr. Arnott's water-bed is soft and easy to lie upon--the pressure\r\nbeing equal at all points.  There was, and still is, a sort of\r\nspringiness in the road over the Moss, such as is felt in passing along a\r\nsuspended bridge; and those who looked along the line as a train passed\r\nover it, said they could observe a waviness, such as precedes and follows\r\na skater upon ice.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these works the most ridiculous rumours were set\r\nafloat.  The drivers of the stage-coaches who feared for their calling,\r\nbrought the alarming intelligence into Manchester from time to time, that\r\n\"Chat Moss was blown up!\"  \"Hundreds of men and horses had sunk; and the\r\nworks were completely abandoned!\"  The engineer himself was declared to\r\nhave been swallowed up in the Serbonian bog; and \"railways were at an end\r\nfor ever!\"\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the railway, Mr. Stephenson's capacity for\r\norganising and directing the labours of a large number of workmen of all\r\nkinds eminently displayed itself.  A vast quantity of ballast-waggons had\r\nto be constructed, and implements and materials collected, before the\r\narmy of necessary labourers could be efficiently employed at the various\r\npoints of the line.  There were not at that time, as there are now, large\r\ncontractors possessed of railway plant, capable of executing earth-works\r\non a large scale.  The first railway engineer had not only to contrive\r\nthe plant, but to organise and direct the labour.  The labourers\r\nthemselves had to be trained to their work; and it was on the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester line that Mr. Stephenson organised the staff of that\r\nmighty band of railway navvies, whose handiworks will be the wonder and\r\nadmiration of succeeding generations.  Looking at their gigantic traces,\r\nthe men of some future age may be found to declare of the engineer and of\r\nhis workmen, that \"there were giants in those days.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the works of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway are of a much\r\nless formidable character than those of many lines that have since been\r\nconstructed, they were then regarded as of the most stupendous\r\ndescription.  In deed, the like of them had not before been executed in\r\nEngland.  It had been our engineer's original intention carry the railway\r\nfrom the north end of Liverpool, round the red-sandstone ridge on which\r\nthe upper part of the town is built, and also round the higher rise of\r\nthe coal formation at Rainhill, by following the natural levels.  But the\r\nopposition of the landowners having forced the line more to the south, it\r\nwas rendered necessary to cut through the hills, and go over the high\r\ngrounds instead of round them.  The first consequence of this alteration\r\nin the plans was the necessity for constructing a tunnel under the town\r\nof Liverpool 1.5 mile in length; the second, a long and deep cutting\r\nthrough the red-sandstone rock at Olive Mount; and the third and most\r\nserious of all, was the necessity for surmounting the Whiston and Sutton\r\nhills by inclined planes of 1 in 96.  The line was also, by the same\r\nforced deviation, prevented passing through the Lancashire coal-field,\r\nand the engineer was compelled to carry it across the Sankey valley, at a\r\npoint where the waters of the brook had dug out an excessively deep\r\nchannel through the marl-beds of the district.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty was experienced in pushing on the works\r\nconnected with the formation of the tunnel under Liverpool, 2200 yards in\r\nlength.  The blasting and hewing of the rock were vigorously carried on\r\nnight and day; and the engineer's practical experience in the collieries\r\nhere proved of great use to him.  Many obstacles had to be encountered\r\nand overcome in the formation of the tunnel, the rock varying in hardness\r\nand texture at different parts.  In some places the miners were deluged\r\nby water, which surged from the soft blue shale found at the lowest level\r\nof the tunnel.  In other places, beds of wet sand were cut through; and\r\nthere careful propping and pinning were necessary to prevent the roof\r\nfrom tumbling in, until the masonry to support it could be erected.  On\r\none occasion, while the engineer was absent from Liverpool, a mass of\r\nloose moss-earth and sand fell from the roof, which had been\r\ninsufficiently propped.  The miners withdrew from the work; and on\r\nStephenson's return, he found them in a refractory state, refusing to\r\nre-enter the tunnel.  He induced them, however, by his example, to return\r\nto their labours; and when the roof had been secured, the work went on\r\nagain as before.  When there was danger, he was always ready to share it\r\nwith the men; and gathering confidence from his fearlessness, they\r\nproceeded vigorously with the undertaking, boring and mining their way\r\ntowards the light.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Olive Mount Cutting]\r\n\r\nThe Olive Mount cutting was the first extensive stone cutting executed on\r\nany railway, and to this day it is one of the most formidable.  It is\r\nabout two miles long, and in some parts 80 feet deep.  It is a narrow\r\nravine or defile cut out of the solid rock; and not less than 480,000\r\ncubic yards of stone were removed from it.  Mr. Vignolles, afterwards\r\ndescribing it, said it looked as if it had been dug out by giants.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of so many roads and streams involved the necessity for\r\nconstructing an unusual number of bridges.  There were not fewer than 63,\r\nunder or over the railway, on the 30 miles between Liverpool and\r\nManchester.  Up to this time, bridges had been applied generally to high\r\nroads where inclined approaches were of comparatively small importance,\r\nand in determining the rise of his arch the engineer selected any headway\r\nhe thought proper.  Every consideration was indeed made subsidiary to\r\nconstructing the bridge itself, and the completion of one large structure\r\nof this sort was regarded as an epoch in engineering history.  Yet here,\r\nin the course of a few years, no fewer than 63 bridges were constructed\r\non one line of railway!  Mr. Stephenson early found that the ordinary\r\narch was inapplicable in certain cases, where the headway was limited,\r\nand yet the level of the railway must be preserved.  In such cases he\r\nemployed simple cast-iron beams, by which he safely bridged gaps of\r\nmoderate width, economizing headway, and introducing the use of a new\r\nmaterial of the greatest possible value to the railway engineer.  The\r\nbridges of masonry upon the line were of many kinds; several of them\r\naskew bridges, and others, such as those at Newton and over the Irwell at\r\nManchester, straight and of considerable dimensions; but the principal\r\npiece of masonry was the Sankey viaduct.\r\n\r\n                        [Picture: Sankey Viaduct]\r\n\r\nThis fine work is principally of brick, with stone facings.  It consists\r\nof nine arches of fifty feet span each.  The massive piers are supported\r\non two hundred piles driven deep into the soil; and they rise to a great\r\nheight,--the coping of the parapet being seventy feet above the level of\r\nthe valley, in which flow the Sankey brook and canal.  Its total cost was\r\nabout 45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1828 the directors found they had expended 460,000 pounds\r\non the works, and that they were still far from completion.  They looked\r\nat the loss of interest on this large investment, and began to grumble at\r\nthe delay.  They desired to see their capital becoming productive; and in\r\nthe spring of 1829 they urged the engineer to push on the works with\r\nincreased vigour.  Mr. Cropper, one of the directors, who took an active\r\ninterest in their progress, said to Stephenson one day, \"Now, George,\r\nthou must get on with the railway, and have it finished without further\r\ndelay; thou must really have it ready for opening by the first day of\r\nJanuary next.\"  \"Consider the heavy character of the works, sir, and how\r\nmuch we have been delayed by the want of money, not to speak of the\r\nwetness of the weather: it is impossible.\"  \"Impossible!\" rejoined\r\nCropper; \"I wish I could get Napoleon to thee--he would tell thee there\r\nis no such word as 'impossible' in the vocabulary.\"  \"Tush!\" exclaimed\r\nStephenson, with warmth; \"don't speak to me about Napoleon!  Give me men,\r\nmoney, and materials, and I will do what Napoleon couldn't do--drive a\r\nrailway from Liverpool to Manchester over Chat Moss!\"\r\n\r\nThe works made rapid progress in the course of the year 1829.  Double\r\nsets of labourers were employed on Chat Moss and at other points, by\r\nnight and day, the night shifts working by torch and fire light; and at\r\nlength, the work advancing at all points, the directors saw their way to\r\nthe satisfactory completion of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that Mr. Stephenson's time was fully occupied in\r\nsuperintending the extensive, and for the most part novel works,\r\nconnected with the railway, and that even his extraordinary powers of\r\nlabour and endurance were taxed to the utmost during the four years that\r\nthey were in progress.  Almost every detail in the plans was directed and\r\narranged by himself.  Every bridge, from the simplest to the most\r\ncomplicated, including the then novel structure of the \"skew bridge,\"\r\niron girders, siphons, fixed engines, and the machinery for working the\r\ntunnel at the Liverpool end, had to be thought out by his own head, and\r\nreduced to definite plans under his own eyes.  Besides all this, he had\r\nto design the working plant in anticipation of the opening of the\r\nrailway.  He must be prepared with waggons, trucks, and carriages,\r\nhimself superintending their manufacture.  The permanent road,\r\nturntables, switches, and crossings,--in short, the entire structure and\r\nmachinery of the line, from the turning of the first sod to the running\r\nof the first train of carriages upon the railway,--were executed under\r\nhis immediate supervision.  And it was in the midst of this vast\r\naccumulation of work and responsibility that the battle of the locomotive\r\nengine had to be fought,--a battle, not merely against material\r\ndifficulties, but against the still more trying obstructions of\r\ndeeply-rooted mistrust and prejudice on the part of a considerable\r\nminority of the directors.\r\n\r\nHe had no staff of experienced assistants,--not even a staff of\r\ndraughtsmen in his office,--but only a few pupils learning their\r\nbusiness; and he was frequently without even their help.  The time of his\r\nengineering inspectors was fully occupied in the actual superintendence\r\nof the works at different parts of the line; and he took care to direct\r\nall their more important operations in person.  The principal draughtsman\r\nwas Mr. Thomas Gooch, a pupil he had brought with him from Newcastle.  \"I\r\nmay say,\" writes Mr. Gooch, \"that nearly the whole of the working and\r\nother drawings, as well as the various land-plans for the railway, were\r\ndrawn by my own hand.  They were done at the Company's office in Clayton\r\nSquare during the day, from instructions supplied in the evenings by Mr.\r\nStephenson, either by word of mouth, or by little rough hand-sketches on\r\nletter-paper.  The evenings were also generally devoted to my duties as\r\nsecretary, in writing (mostly from his own dictation) his letters and\r\nreports, or in making calculations and estimates.  The mornings before\r\nbreakfast were not unfrequently spent by me in visiting and lending a\r\nhelping hand in the tunnel and other works near Liverpool,--the untiring\r\nzeal and perseverance of George Stephenson never for an instant flagging\r\nand inspiring with a like enthusiasm all who were engaged under him in\r\ncarrying forward the works.\" {189}\r\n\r\nThe usual routine of his life at this time--if routine it might be\r\ncalled--was, to rise early, by sunrise in summer and before it in winter,\r\nand thus \"break the back of the day's work\" by mid-day.  While the tunnel\r\nunder Liverpool was in progress, one of his first duties in a morning\r\nbefore breakfast was to go over the various shafts, clothed in a suitable\r\ndress, and inspect their progress at different points; on other days he\r\nwould visit the extensive workshops at Edgehill, where most of the\r\n\"plant\" for the line was in course of manufacture.  Then, returning to\r\nhis house, in Upper Parliament Street, Windsor, after a hurried\r\nbreakfast, he would ride along the works to inspect their progress, and\r\npush them on with greater energy where needful.  On other days he would\r\nprepare for the much less congenial engagement of meeting the Board,\r\nwhich was often a cause of great anxiety and pain to him; for it was\r\ndifficult to satisfy men of all tempers, and some of these not of the\r\nmost generous sort.  On such occasions he might be seen with his\r\nright-hand thumb thrust through the topmost button-hole of his\r\ncoat-breast, vehemently hitching his right shoulder, as was his habit\r\nwhen labouring under any considerable excitement.  Occasionally he would\r\ntake an early ride before breakfast, to inspect the progress of the\r\nSankey viaduct.  He had a favourite horse, brought by him from Newcastle,\r\ncalled \"Bobby,\"--so tractable that, with his rider on his back, he would\r\nwalk up to a locomotive with the steam blowing off, and put his nose\r\nagainst it without shying.  \"Bobby,\" saddled and bridled, was brought to\r\nMr. Stephenson's door betimes in the morning; and mounting him, he would\r\nride the fifteen miles to Sankey, putting up at a little public house\r\nwhich then stood upon the banks of the canal.  There he had his breakfast\r\nof \"crowdie,\" which he made with his own hands.  It consisted of oatmeal\r\nstirred into a basin of hot water,--a sort of porridge,--which was supped\r\nwith cold sweet milk.  After this frugal breakfast, he would go upon the\r\nworks, and remain there, riding from point to point for the greater part\r\nof the day.  When he returned before mid-day, he examined the pay-sheets\r\nin the different departments, sent in by the assistant engineers, or by\r\nthe foremen of the workshops.  To all these he gave his most careful\r\npersonal attention, requiring when necessary a full explanation of the\r\nitems.\r\n\r\nAfter a late dinner, which occupied very short time and was always of a\r\nplain and frugal description, he disposed of his correspondence, or\r\nprepared sketches of drawings, and gave instructions as to their\r\ncompletion.  He would occasionally refresh himself for this evening work\r\nby a short doze, which, however, he would never admit had exceeded the\r\nlimits of \"winking,\" to use his own term.  Mr. Frederick Swanwick, who\r\nofficiated as his secretary, after the appointment of Mr. Gooch as\r\nResident Engineer to the Bolton and Leigh Railway, has informed us that\r\nhe then remarked--what in after years he could better appreciate--the\r\nclear, terse, and vigorous style of Mr. Stephenson's dictation.  There\r\nwas nothing superfluous in it; but it was close, direct, and to the\r\npoint,--in short, thoroughly businesslike.  And if, in passing through\r\nthe pen of the amanuensis, his meaning happened in any way to be\r\ndistorted or modified, it did not fail to escape his detection, though he\r\nwas always tolerant of any liberties taken with his own form of\r\nexpression, so long as the words written down conveyed his real meaning.\r\n\r\nHis letters and reports written, and his sketches of drawings made and\r\nexplained, the remainder of the evening was usually devoted to\r\nconversation with his wife and those of his pupils who lived under his\r\nroof, and constituted, as it were, part of the family.  He then delighted\r\nto test the knowledge of his young companions, and to question them upon\r\nthe principles of mechanics.  If they were not quite \"up to the mark\" on\r\nany point, there was no escaping detection by evasive or specious\r\nexplanations.  These always brought out the verdict, \"Ah! you know nought\r\nabout it now; but think it over again, and tell me when you understand\r\nit.\"  If there were even partial success in the reply, it was at once\r\nacknowledged, and a full explanation given, to which the master would add\r\nillustrative examples for the purpose of impressing the principle more\r\ndeeply upon the pupil's mind.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much his object and purpose to \"cram\" the minds of the\r\nyoung men committed to his charge with the _results_ of knowledge, as to\r\nstimulate them to educate themselves--to induce them to develop their\r\nmental and moral powers by the exercise of their own free energies, and\r\nthus acquire that habit of self-thinking and self-reliance which is the\r\nspring of all true manly action.  In a word, he sought to bring out and\r\ninvigorate the _character_ of his pupils.  He felt that he himself had\r\nbeen made stronger and better through his encounters with difficulty; and\r\nhe would not have the road of knowledge made too smooth and easy for\r\nthem.  \"Learn for yourselves,--think for yourselves,\" he would\r\nsay:--\"make yourselves masters of principles,--persevere,--be\r\nindustrious,--and there is then no fear of you.\"  And not the least\r\nemphatic proof of the soundness of this system of education, as conducted\r\nby Mr. Stephenson, was afforded by the after history of these pupils\r\nthemselves.  There was not one of those trained under his eye who did not\r\nrise to eminent usefulness and distinction as an engineer.  He sent them\r\nforth into the world braced with the spirit of manly self-help--inspired\r\nby his own noble example; and they repeated in their after career the\r\nlessons of earnest effort and persistent industry which his daily life\r\nhad taught them.\r\n\r\nStephenson's evenings at home were not, however, exclusively devoted\r\neither to business or to the graver exercises above referred to.  He\r\nwould often indulge in cheerful conversation and anecdote, falling back\r\nfrom time to time upon the struggles and difficulties of his early life.\r\nThe not unfrequent winding up of his story addressed to the young men\r\nabout him, was, \"Ah! ye young fellows don't know what _wark_ is in these\r\ndays!\"  Mr. Swanwick takes pleasure in recalling to mind how seldom, if\r\never, a cross or captious word, or an angry look, marred the enjoyment of\r\nthose evenings.  The presence of Mrs. Stephenson gave them an additional\r\ncharm: amiable, kind-hearted, and intelligent, she shared quietly in the\r\npleasure of the party; and the atmosphere of comfort which always\r\npervaded her home contributed in no small degree to render it a centre of\r\ncheerful, hopeful intercourse, and of earnest, honest industry.  She was\r\na wife who well deserved, what she through life retained, the strong and\r\nunremitting affection of her husband.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Stephenson retired for the night, it was not always that he\r\npermitted himself to sink into slumber.  Like Brindley, he worked out\r\nmany a difficult problem in bed; and for hours he would turn over in his\r\nmind and study how to overcome some obstacle, or to mature some project,\r\non which his thoughts were bent.  Some remark inadvertently dropped by\r\nhim at the breakfast-table in the morning, served to show that he had\r\nbeen stealing some hours from the past night in reflection and study.\r\nYet he would rise at his accustomed early hour, and there was no\r\nabatement of his usual energy in carrying on the business of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nROBERT STEPHENSON'S RESIDENCE IN COLOMBIA, AND RETURN--THE BATTLE OF THE\r\nLOCOMOTIVE--\"THE ROCKET.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe return to the career of Robert Stephenson, who had been absent from\r\nEngland during the construction of the Liverpool railway, but was shortly\r\nabout to join his father and take part in \"the battle of the locomotive,\"\r\nwhich was now impending.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Edinburgh College in the summer of 1823, he had\r\nassisted in the survey of the Stockton and Darlington line; and when the\r\nLocomotive Engine Works were started in Forth Street, Newcastle, he took\r\nan active part in that concern.  \"The factory,\" he says, \"was in active\r\noperation early in 1824; I left England for Colombia in June of that\r\nyear, having finished drawing the designs of the Brusselton stationary\r\nengines for the Stockton and Darlington Railway before I left.\" {193}\r\n\r\nSpeculation was very rife at the time; and amongst the most promising\r\nadventures were the companies organised for the purpose of working the\r\ngold and silver mines of South America.  Great difficulty was experienced\r\nin finding mining engineers capable of carrying out those projects, and\r\nyoung men of even the most moderate experience were eagerly sought after.\r\nThe Columbian Mining Association of London offered an engagement to young\r\nStephenson, to go out to Mariquita and take charge of the engineering\r\noperations of that company.  Robert was himself desirous of accepting it,\r\nbut his father said it would first be necessary to ascertain whether the\r\nproposed change would be for his good.  His health had been very delicate\r\nfor some time, partly occasioned by his rapid growth, but principally\r\nbecause of his close application to work and study.  Father and son\r\ntogether called upon Dr. Headlam, the eminent physician of Newcastle, to\r\nconsult him on the subject.  During the examination which ensued, Robert\r\nafterwards used to say that he felt as if he were upon trial for life or\r\ndeath.  To his great relief, the doctor pronounced that a temporary\r\nresidence in a warm climate was the very thing likely to be most\r\nbeneficial to him.  The appointment was accordingly accepted, and, before\r\nmany weeks had passed, Robert Stephenson set sail for South America.\r\n\r\nAfter a tolerably prosperous voyage he landed at La Guayra, on the north\r\ncoast of Venezuela, on the 23rd July, from thence proceeding to Caraccas,\r\nthe capital of the district, about 15 miles inland.  There he remained\r\nfor two months, unable to proceed in consequence of the wretched state of\r\nthe roads in the interior.  He contrived, however, to make occasional\r\nexcursions in the neighbourhood, with an eye to the mining business on\r\nwhich he had come.  About the beginning of October he set out for Bogota,\r\nthe capital of Columbia or New Granada.  The distance was about 1200\r\nmiles, through a very difficult region, and it was performed entirely\r\nupon mule-back after the fashion of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the journey Robert visited many of the districts\r\nreported to be rich in minerals, but he met with few traces except of\r\ncopper, iron, and coal, with occasional indications of gold and silver.\r\nHe found the people ready to furnish information, which, however, when\r\ntested, usually proved worthless.  A guide whom he employed for weeks,\r\nkept him buoyed up with the hope of richer mining quarters than he had\r\nyet seen; but when he professed to be able to show him mines of \"brass,\r\nsteel, alcohol, and pinchbeck,\" Stephenson discovered him to be an\r\nincorrigible rogue, and immediately dismissed him.  At length our\r\ntraveller reached Bogota, and after an interview with Mr. Illingworth,\r\nthe commercial manager of the mining Company, he proceeded to Honda,\r\ncrossed the Magdalena, and shortly after reached the site of his intended\r\noperations on the eastern slopes of the Andes.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson used afterwards to speak in glowing terms of this his\r\nfirst mule-journey in South America.  Everything was entirely new to him.\r\nThe variety and beauty of the indigenous plants, the luxurious tropical\r\nvegetation, the appearance, manners, and dress of the people, and the\r\nmode of travelling, were altogether different from everything he had\r\nbefore seen.  His own travelling garb also must have been strange even to\r\nhimself.  \"My hat,\" he says, \"was of plaited grass, with a crown nine\r\ninches in height, surrounded by a brim of six inches; a white cotton\r\nsuit; and a _ruana_ of blue and crimson plaid, with a hole in the centre\r\nfor the head to pass through.  This cloak is admirably adapted for the\r\npurpose, amply covering the rider and mule, and at night answering the\r\npurpose of a blanket in the net-hammock, which is made from fibres of the\r\naloe, and which every traveller carries before him on his mule, and\r\nsuspends to the trees or in houses, as occasion may require.\"  The part\r\nof the journey which seems to have made the most lasting impression on\r\nhis mind was that between Bogota and the mining district in the\r\nneighbourhood of Mariquita.  As he ascended the slopes of the\r\nmountain-range, and reached the first step of the table-land, he was\r\nstruck beyond expression with the noble view of the valley of the\r\nMagdalena behind him, so vast that he failed in attempting to define the\r\npoint at which the course of the river blended with the horizon.  Like\r\nall travellers in the district, he noted the remarkable changes of\r\nclimate and vegetation, as he rose from the burning plains towards the\r\nfresh breath of the mountains.  From an atmosphere as hot as that of an\r\noven he passed into delicious cool air; until, in his onward and upward\r\njourney, a still more temperate region was reached, the very perfection\r\nof climate.  Before him rose the majestic Cordilleras, forming a rampart\r\nagainst the western skies, at certain times of the day looking black,\r\nsharp, and, at their summit, almost as even as a wall.\r\n\r\nOur engineer took up his abode for a time at Mariquita, a fine old city,\r\nthough then greatly decayed.  During the period of the Spanish dominion,\r\nit was an important place, most of the gold and silver convoys passing\r\nthrough it on their way to Cartagena, there to be shipped in galleons for\r\nEurope.  The mountainous country to the west was rich in silver, gold,\r\nand other metals, and it was Mr. Stephenson's object to select the best\r\nsite for commencing operations for the Company.  With this object he\r\n\"prospected\" about in all directions, visiting long-abandoned mines, and\r\nanalysing specimens obtained from many quarters.  The mines eventually\r\nfixed upon as the scene of his operations were those of La Manta and\r\nSanta Anna, long before worked by the Spaniards, though, in consequence\r\nof the luxuriance and rapidity of the vegetation, all traces of the old\r\nworkings had become completely overgrown and lost.  Everything had to be\r\nbegun anew.  Roads had to be cut to the mines, machinery to be erected,\r\nand the ground opened up, in course of which some of the old adits were\r\nhit upon.  The native peons or labourers were not accustomed to work, and\r\nat first they usually contrived to desert when they were not watched, so\r\nthat very little progress could be made until the arrival of the expected\r\nband of miners from England.  The authorities were by no means helpful,\r\nand the engineer was driven to an old expedient with the object of\r\novercoming this difficulty.  \"We endeavour all we can,\" he says, in one\r\nof his letters, \"to make ourselves popular, and this we find most\r\neffectually accomplished by 'regaling the venal beasts.'\" {196}  He also\r\ngave a ball at Mariquita, which passed off with _eclat_, the governor\r\nfrom Honda, with a host of friends, honouring it with their presence.  It\r\nwas, indeed, necessary to \"make a party\" in this way, as other schemers\r\nwere already trying to undermine the Colombian company in influential\r\ndirections.  The engineer did not exaggerate when he said, \"The\r\nuncertainty of transacting business in this country is perplexing beyond\r\ndescription.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, his party of miners arrived from England, but they gave him even\r\nmore trouble than the peons had done.  They were rough, drunken, and\r\nsometimes altogether ungovernable.  He set them to work at the Santa Anna\r\nmine without delay, and at the same time took up his abode amongst them,\r\n\"to keep them,\" he said, \"if possible, from indulging in the detestable\r\nvice of drunkenness, which, if not put a stop to, will eventually destroy\r\nthemselves, and involve the mining association in ruin.\"  To add to his\r\ntroubles, the captain of the miners displayed a very hostile and\r\ninsubordinate spirit, quarrelled and fought with the men, and was\r\ninsolent to the engineer himself.  The captain and his gang, being\r\nCornish men, told Robert to his face, that because he was a North-country\r\nman, and not born in Cornwall it was impossible he should know anything\r\nof mining.  Disease also fell upon him,--first fever, and then visceral\r\nderangement, followed by a return of his \"old complaint, a feeling of\r\noppression in the breast.\"  No wonder that in the midst of these troubles\r\nhe should longingly speak of returning to his native land.  But he stuck\r\nto his post and his duty, kept up his courage, and by a mixture of\r\nmildness and firmness, and the display of great coolness of judgment, he\r\ncontrived to keep the men to their work, and gradually to carry forward\r\nthe enterprise which he had undertaken.  By the beginning of July, 1826,\r\nwe find that quietness and order had been restored, and the works were\r\nproceeding more satisfactorily, though the yield of silver was not as yet\r\nvery promising.  Mr. Stephenson calculated that at least three years'\r\ndiligent and costly operations would be needed to render the mines\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he removed to the dwelling which had been erected for\r\nhis accommodation at Santa Anna.  It was a structure speedily raised\r\nafter the fashion of the country.\r\n\r\n           [Picture: Robert Stephenson's Cottage at Santa Anna]\r\n\r\nThe walls were of split and flattened bamboo, tied together with the long\r\nfibres of a dried climbing plant; the roof was of palm-leaves, and the\r\nceiling of reeds.  When an earthquake shook the district--for earthquakes\r\nwere frequent--the inmates of such a fabric merely felt as if shaken in a\r\nbasket, without sustaining any harm.  In front of the cottage lay a woody\r\nravine, extending almost to the base of the Andes, gorgeously clothed in\r\nprimeval vegetation--magnolias, palms, bamboos, tree-ferns, acacias,\r\ncedars; and, towering over all, the great almendrons, with their smooth,\r\nsilvery stems, bearing aloft noble clusters of pure white blossom.  The\r\nforest was haunted by myriads of gay insects, butterflies with wings of\r\ndazzling lustre, birds of brilliant plumage, humming-birds, golden\r\norioles, toucans, and a host of solitary warblers.  But the glorious\r\nsunsets seen from his cottage-porch more than all astonished and\r\ndelighted the young engineer; and he was accustomed to say that, after\r\nhaving witnessed them, he was reluctant to accuse the ancient Peruvians\r\nof idolatry.\r\n\r\nBut all these natural beauties failed to reconcile him to the harassing\r\ndifficulties of his situation, which continued to increase rather than\r\ndiminish.  He was hampered by the action of the Board at home, who gave\r\near to hostile criticisms on his reports; and, although they afterwards\r\nmade handsome acknowledgment of his services, he felt his position to be\r\naltogether unsatisfactory.  He therefore determined to leave at the\r\nexpiry of his three years engagement, and communicated his decision to\r\nthe directors accordingly.  On receiving his letter, the Board, through\r\nMr. Richardson, of Lombard street, one of the directors, communicated\r\nwith his father at Newcastle, representing that if he would allow his son\r\nto remain in Colombia the Company would make it \"worth his while.\"  To\r\nthis the father gave a decided negative, and intimated that he himself\r\nneeded his son's assistance, and that he must return at the expiry of his\r\nthree years' term,--a decision, writes Robert, \"at which I feel much\r\ngratified, as it is clear that he is as anxious to have me back in\r\nEngland as I am to get there.\" {199}  At the same time, Edward Pease, a\r\nprincipal partner in the Newcastle firm, privately wrote Robert to the\r\nfollowing effect, urging his return home:--\"I can assure thee that thy\r\nbusiness at Newcastle, as well as thy father's engineering, have suffered\r\nvery much from thy absence, and, unless thou soon return, the former will\r\nbe given up, as Mr. Longridge is not able to give it that attention it\r\nrequires; and what is done is not done with credit to the house.\"  The\r\nidea of the manufactory being given up, which Robert had laboured so hard\r\nto establish before leaving England, was painful to him in the extreme,\r\nand he wrote to the manager of the Company, strongly urging that\r\narrangements should be made for him to leave without delay.  In the mean\r\ntime he was again laid prostrate by another violent attack of aguish\r\nfever; and when able to write in June, 1827, he expressed himself as\r\n\"completely wearied and worn down with vexation.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, when he was sufficiently recovered from his attack and able to\r\ntravel, he set out on his voyage homeward in the beginning of August.  At\r\nMompox, on his way down the river Magdalena, he met Mr. Bodmer, his\r\nsuccessor, with a fresh party of miners from England, on their way up the\r\ncountry to the quarters which he had just quitted.  Next day, six hours\r\nafter leaving Mompox, a steamboat was met ascending the river, with\r\nBolivar the Liberator on board, on his way to St. Bogota; and it was a\r\nmortification to our engineer that he had only a passing sight of that\r\ndistinguished person.  It was his intention, on leaving Mariquita, to\r\nvisit the Isthmus of Panama on his way home, for the purpose of inquiring\r\ninto the practicability of cutting a canal to unite the Atlantic and\r\nPacific--a project which then formed the subject of considerable public\r\ndiscussion; but his presence being so anxiously desired at home, he\r\ndetermined to proceed to New York without delay.\r\n\r\nArrived at the port of Cartagena, he had to wait some time for a ship.\r\nThe delay was very irksome to him, the more so as the city was then\r\ndesolated by the ravages of the yellow fever.  While sitting one day in\r\nthe large, bare, comfortless public room at the miserable hotel at which\r\nhe put up, he observed two strangers, whom he at once perceived to be\r\nEnglish.  One of the strangers was a tall, gaunt man, shrunken and\r\nhollow-looking, shabbily dressed, and apparently poverty-stricken.  On\r\nmaking inquiry, he found it was Trevithick, the builder of the first\r\nrailroad locomotive!  He was returning home from the gold-mines of Peru\r\npenniless.  He had left England in 1816, with powerful steam-engines,\r\nintended for the drainage and working of the Peruvian mines.  He met with\r\nalmost a royal reception on his landing at Lima.  A guard of honour was\r\nappointed to attend him, and it was even proposed to erect a statue of\r\nDon Ricardo Trevithick in solid silver.  It was given forth in Cornwall\r\nthat his emoluments amounted to 100,000 pounds a year, {201} and that he\r\nwas making a gigantic fortune.  Great, therefore, was Robert Stephenson's\r\nsurprise to find this potent Don Ricardo in the inn at Cartagena, reduced\r\nalmost to his last shilling, and unable to proceed further.  He had\r\nindeed realised the truth of the Spanish proverb, that \"a silver-mine\r\nbrings misery, a gold-mine ruin.\"  He and his friend had lost everything\r\nin their journey across the country from Peru.  They had forded rivers\r\nand wandered through forests, leaving all their baggage behind them, and\r\nhad reached thus far with little more than the clothes upon their backs.\r\nAlmost the only remnant of precious metal saved by Trevithick was a pair\r\nof silver spurs, which he took back with him to Cornwall.  Robert\r\nStephenson lent him 50 pounds to enable him to reach England; and though\r\nhe was afterwards heard of as an inventor there, he had no further part\r\nin the ultimate triumph of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nBut Trevithick's misadventures on this occasion had not yet ended, for\r\nbefore he reached New York he was wrecked, and Robert Stephenson with\r\nhim.  The following is the account of the voyage, \"big with adventures,\"\r\nas given by the latter in a letter to his friend Illingworth:--\"At first\r\nwe had very little foul weather, and indeed were for several days\r\nbecalmed amongst the islands, which was so far fortunate, for a few\r\ndegrees further north the most tremendous gales were blowing, and they\r\nappear (from our future information) to have wrecked every vessel exposed\r\nto their violence.  We had two examples of the effects of the hurricane;\r\nfor, as we sailed north we took on board the remains of two crews found\r\nfloating about on dismantled hulls.  The one had been nine days without\r\nfood of any kind, except the carcasses of two of their companions who had\r\ndied a day or two previously from fatigue and hunger.  The other crew had\r\nbeen driven about for six days, and were not so dejected, but reduced to\r\nsuch a weak state that they were obliged to be drawn on board our vessel\r\nby ropes.  A brig bound for Havannah took part of the men, and we took\r\nthe remainder.  To attempt any description of my feelings on witnessing\r\nsuch scenes would be in vain.  You will not be surprised to learn that I\r\nfelt somewhat uneasy at the thought that we were so far from England, and\r\nthat I also might possibly suffer similar shipwreck; but I consoled\r\nmyself with the hope that fate would be more kind to us.  It was not so\r\nmuch so, however, as I had flattered myself; for on voyaging towards New\r\nYork, after we had made the land, we ran aground about midnight.  The\r\nvessel soon filled with water, and, being surrounded by the breaking\r\nsurf, the ship was soon split up, and before morning our situation became\r\nperilous.  Masts and all were cut away to prevent the hull rocking; but\r\nall we could do was of no avail.  About 8 o'clock on the following\r\nmorning, after a most miserable night, we were taken off the wreck, and\r\nwere so fortunate as to reach the shore.  I saved my minerals, but Empson\r\nlost part of his botanical collection.  Upon the whole, we got off well;\r\nand, had I not been on the American side of the Atlantic, I 'guess' I\r\nwould not have gone to sea again.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a short tour in the United States and Canada, Robert Stephenson and\r\nhis friend took ship for Liverpool, where they arrived at the end of\r\nNovember, and at once proceeded to Newcastle.  The factory was by no\r\nmeans in a prosperous state.  During the time Robert had been in America\r\nit had been carried on at a loss; and Edward Pease, much disheartened,\r\nwished to retire, but George Stephenson was unable to buy him out, and\r\nthe establishment had to be carried on in the hope that the locomotive\r\nmight yet be established in public estimation as a practical and\r\neconomical working power.  Robert Stephenson immediately instituted a\r\nrigid inquiry into the working of the concern, unravelled the accounts,\r\nwhich had fallen into confusion during his father's absence at Liverpool;\r\nand he soon succeeded in placing the affairs of the factory in a more\r\nhealthy condition.  In all this he had the hearty support of his father,\r\nas well as of the other partners.\r\n\r\nThe works of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway were now approaching\r\ncompletion.  But, singular to say, the directors had not yet decided as\r\nto the tractive power to be employed in working the line when opened for\r\ntraffic.  The differences of opinion among them were so great as\r\napparently to be irreconcilable.  It was necessary, however, that they\r\nshould come to some decision without further loss of time; and many Board\r\nmeetings were accordingly held to discuss the subject.  The old-fashioned\r\nand well-tried system of horse haulage was not without its advocates;\r\nbut, looking at the large amount of traffic which there was to be\r\nconveyed, and at the probable delay in the transit from station to\r\nstation if this method were adopted, the directors, after a visit made by\r\nthem to the Northumberland and Durham railways in 1828, came to the\r\nconclusion that the employment of horse power was inadmissible.\r\n\r\nFixed engines had many advocates; the locomotive very few: it stood as\r\nyet almost in a minority of one--George Stephenson.  The prejudice\r\nagainst the employment of the latter power had even increased since the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Bill underwent its first ordeal in the House of\r\nCommons.  In proof of this, we may mention that the Newcastle and\r\nCarlisle Railway Act was conceded in 1829, on the express condition that\r\nit should _not_ be worked by locomotives, but by horses only.\r\n\r\nGrave doubts existed as to the practicability of working a large traffic\r\nby means of travelling engines.  The most celebrated engineers offered no\r\nopinion on the subject.  They did not believe in the locomotive, and\r\nwould scarcely take the trouble to examine it.  The ridicule with which\r\nGeorge Stephenson had been assailed by the barristers before the\r\nParliamentary Committee had not been altogether distasteful to them.\r\nPerhaps they did not relish the idea of a man who had picked up his\r\nexperience in Newcastle coal-pits appearing in the capacity of a leading\r\nengineer before Parliament, and attempting to establish a new system of\r\ninternal communication in the country.  The directors could not disregard\r\nthe adverse and conflicting views of the professional men whom they\r\nconsulted.  But Mr. Stephenson had so repeatedly and earnestly urged upon\r\nthem the propriety of making a trial of the locomotive before coming to\r\nany decision against it, that they at length authorised him to proceed\r\nwith the construction of one of his engines by way of experiment.  In\r\ntheir report to the proprietors at their annual meeting on, the 27th\r\nMarch, 1828, they state that they had, after due consideration,\r\nauthorised the engineer \"to prepare a locomotive engine, which, from the\r\nnature of its construction and from the experiments already made, he is\r\nof opinion will be effective for the purposes of the Company, without\r\nproving an annoyance to the public.\"  The locomotive thus ordered was\r\nplaced upon the line in 1829, and was found of great service in drawing\r\nthe waggons full of marl from the two great cuttings.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the discussion proceeded as to the kind of power to be\r\npermanently employed for the working of the railway.  The directors were\r\ninundated with schemes of all sorts for facilitating locomotion.  The\r\nprojectors of England, France, and America, seemed to be let loose upon\r\nthem.  There were plans for working the waggons along the line by water\r\npower.  Some proposed hydrogen, and others carbonic acid gas.\r\nAtmospheric pressure had its eager advocates.  And various kinds of fixed\r\nand locomotive steam-power were suggested.  Thomas Gray urged his plan of\r\na greased road with cog rails; and Messrs. Vignolles and Ericsson\r\nrecommended the adoption of a central friction rail, against which two\r\nhorizontal rollers under the locomotive, pressing upon the sides of this\r\nrail, were to afford the means of ascending the inclined planes.  The\r\ndirectors felt themselves quite unable to choose from amidst this\r\nmultitude of projects.  The engineer expressed himself as decidedly as\r\nheretofore in favour of smooth rails and locomotive engines, which, he\r\nwas confident, would be found the most economical and by far the most\r\nconvenient moving power that could be employed.  The Stockton and\r\nDarlington Railway being now at work, another deputation went down\r\npersonally to inspect the fixed and locomotive engines on that line, as\r\nwell as at Hetton and Killingworth.  They returned to Liverpool with much\r\ninformation; but their testimony as to the relative merits of the two\r\nkinds of engines was so contradictory, that the directors were as far\r\nfrom a decision as ever.\r\n\r\nThey then resolved to call to their aid two professional engineers of\r\nhigh standing, who should visit the Darlington and Newcastle railways,\r\ncarefully examine both modes of working--the fixed and the\r\nlocomotive,--and report to them fully on the subject.  The gentlemen\r\nselected were Mr. Walker of Limehouse, and Mr. Rastrick of Stourbridge.\r\nAfter carefully examining the modes of working the northern railways,\r\nthey made their report to the directors in the spring of 1829.  They\r\nconcurred in the opinion that the cost of an establishment of fixed\r\nengines would be somewhat greater than that of locomotives to do the same\r\nwork; but thought the annual charge would be less if the former were\r\nadopted.  They calculated that the cost of moving a ton of goods thirty\r\nmiles by fixed engines would be 6.40d., and by locomotives,\r\n8.36d.,--assuming a profitable traffic to be obtained both ways.  At the\r\nsame time it was admitted that there appeared more ground for expecting\r\nimprovements in the construction and working of locomotives than of\r\nstationary engines.  On the whole, however, and looking especially at the\r\ncomputed annual charge of working the road on the two systems on a large\r\nscale, the two reporting engineers were of opinion that fixed engines\r\nwere preferable, and accordingly recommended their adoption.  And, in\r\norder to carry the system recommended by them into effect, they proposed\r\nto divide the railroad between Liverpool and Manchester into nineteen\r\nstages of about a mile and a half each, with twenty-one engines fixed at\r\nthe different points to work the trains forward.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result, so far, of George Stephenson's labours.  Two of the\r\nbest practical engineers of the day concurred in reporting substantially\r\nin favour of the employment of fixed engines.  Not a single professional\r\nman of eminence supported the engineer in his preference for locomotive\r\nover fixed engine power.  He had scarcely an adherent, and the locomotive\r\nsystem seemed on the eve of being abandoned.  Still he did not despair.\r\nWith the profession as well as public opinion against him--for the most\r\nfrightful stories were abroad respecting the dangers, the unsightliness,\r\nand the nuisance which the locomotive would create--Stephenson held to\r\nhis purpose.  Even in this, apparently the darkest hour of the\r\nlocomotive, he did not hesitate to declare that locomotive railroads\r\nwould, before many years had passed, be \"the great highways of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nHe urged his views upon the directors in all ways, and, as some of them\r\nthought, at all seasons.  He pointed out the greater convenience of\r\nlocomotive power for the purposes of a public highway, likening it to a\r\nseries of short unconnected chains, any one of which could be removed and\r\nanother substituted without interruption to the traffic; whereas the\r\nfixed engine system might be regarded in the light of a continuous chain\r\nextending between the two termini, the failure of any link of which would\r\nderange the whole. {206}  He represented to the Board that the locomotive\r\nwas yet capable of great improvements, if proper inducements were held\r\nout to inventors and machinists to make them; and he pledged himself\r\nthat, if time were given him, he would construct an engine that should\r\nsatisfy their requirements, and prove itself capable of working heavy\r\nloads along the railway with speed, regularity and safety.  At length,\r\ninfluenced by his persistent earnestness not less than by his arguments,\r\nthe directors, at the suggestion of Mr. Harrison, determined to offer a\r\nprize of 500 pounds for the best locomotive engine, which, on a certain\r\nday, should be produced on the railway, and perform certain specified\r\nconditions in the most satisfactory manner. {207}\r\n\r\nIt was now felt that the fate of railways in a great measure depended\r\nupon the issue of this appeal to the mechanical genius of England.  When\r\nthe advertisement of the prize for the best locomotive was published,\r\nscientific men began more particularly to direct their attention to the\r\nnew power which was thus struggling into existence.  In the mean time\r\npublic opinion on the subject of railway working remained suspended, and\r\nthe progress of the undertaking was watched with intense interest.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the discussion with reference to the kind of power\r\nto be employed, Mr. Stephenson was in constant communication with his son\r\nRobert, who made frequent visits to Liverpool for the purpose of\r\nassisting his father in the preparation of his reports to the Board on\r\nthe subject.  They had also many conversations as to the best mode of\r\nincreasing the powers and perfecting the mechanism of the locomotive.\r\nThese became more frequent and interesting, when the prize was offered\r\nfor the best locomotive, and the working plans of the engine which they\r\nproposed to construct came to be settled.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important considerations in the new engine was the\r\narrangement of the boiler and the extension of its heating surface to\r\nenable steam enough to be raised rapidly and continuously, for the\r\npurpose of maintaining high rates of speed,--the effect of high-pressure\r\nengines being ascertained to depend mainly upon the quantity of steam\r\nwhich the boiler can generate, and upon its degree of elasticity when\r\nproduced.  The quantity of steam so generated, it will be obvious, must\r\ndepend chiefly upon the quantity of fuel consumed in the furnace, and by\r\nnecessary consequence, upon the high rate of temperature maintained\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in Stephenson's first Killingworth engines he\r\ninvented and applied the ingenious method of stimulating combustion in\r\nthe furnace, by throwing the waste steam into the chimney after\r\nperforming its office in the cylinders, thus accelerating the ascent of\r\nthe current of air, greatly increasing the draught, and consequently the\r\ntemperature of the fire.  This plan was adopted by him, as we have\r\nalready seen, as early as 1815; and it was so successful that he himself\r\nattributed to it the greater economy of the locomotive as compared with\r\nhorse power.  Hence the continuance of its use upon the Killingworth\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nThough the adoption of the steam-blast greatly quickened combustion and\r\ncontributed to the rapid production of high-pressure steam, the limited\r\namount of heating surface presented to the fire was still felt to be an\r\nobstacle to the complete success of the locomotive engine.  Mr.\r\nStephenson endeavoured to overcome this by lengthening the boilers and\r\nincreasing the surface presented by the flue-tubes.  The \"Lancashire\r\nWitch,\" which he built for the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and used in\r\nforming the Liverpool and Manchester Railway embankments, was constructed\r\nwith a double tube, each of which contained a fire and passed\r\nlongitudinally through the boiler.  But this arrangement necessarily led\r\nto a considerable increase in the weight of the engine, which amounted to\r\nabout twelve tons; and as six tons was the limit allowed for engines\r\nadmitted to the Liverpool competition, it was clear that the time was\r\ncome when the Killingworth locomotive must undergo a further important\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nFor many years previous to this period, ingenious mechanics had been\r\nengaged in attempting to solve the problem of the best and most\r\neconomical boiler for the production of high-pressure steam.  As early as\r\n1803, Mr. Woolf patented a tubular boiler, which was extensively employed\r\nat the Cornish mines, and was found greatly to facilitate the production\r\nof steam, by the extension of the heating surface.  The ingenious\r\nTrevithick, in his patent of 1815, seems also to have entertained the\r\nidea of employing a boiler constructed of \"small perpendicular tubes,\"\r\nwith the same object of increasing the heating surface.  These tubes were\r\nto be closed at the bottom, and open into a common reservoir, from which\r\nthey were to receive their water, and where the steam of all the tubes\r\nwas to be united.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time George Stephenson was trying the effect of\r\nintroducing small tubes in the boilers of his locomotives, with the\r\nobject of increasing their evaporative power.  Thus, in 1829, he sent to\r\nFrance two engines constructed at the Newcastle works for the Lyons and\r\nSt. Etienne Railway, in the boilers of which tubes were placed containing\r\nwater.  The heating surface was thus found to be materially increased;\r\nbut the expedient was not successful, for the tubes, becoming furred with\r\ndeposit, shortly burned out and were removed.  It was then that M.\r\nSeguin, the engineer of the railway, pursuing the same idea, adopted his\r\nplan of employing horizontal tubes through which the heated air passed in\r\nstreamlets.  Mr. Henry Booth, the secretary of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway, without any knowledge of M. Seguin's proceedings,\r\nnext devised his plan of a tubular boiler, which he brought under the\r\nnotice of Mr. Stephenson, who at once adopted it, and settled the mode in\r\nwhich the fire-box and tubes were to be mutually arranged and connected.\r\nThis plan was adopted in the construction of the celebrated \"Rocket\"\r\nengine, the building of which was immediately proceeded with at the\r\nNewcastle works.\r\n\r\nThe principal circumstances connected with the construction of the\r\n\"Rocket,\" as described by Robert Stephenson to the author, may be briefly\r\nstated.  The tubular principle was adopted in a more complete manner than\r\nhad yet been attempted.  Twenty-five copper tubes, each three inches in\r\ndiameter, extended from one end of the boiler to the other, the heated\r\nair passing through them on its way to the chimney; and the tubes being\r\nsurrounded by the water of the boiler, it will be obvious that a large\r\nextension of the _heating surface_ was thus effectually secured.  The\r\nprincipal difficulty was in fitting the copper tubes within the boiler so\r\nas to prevent leakage.  They were made by a Newcastle coppersmith, and\r\nsoldered to brass screws which were screwed into the boiler ends,\r\nstanding out in great knobs.  When the tubes were thus fitted, and the\r\nboiler was filled with water, hydraulic pressure was applied; but the\r\nwater squirted out at every joint, and the factory floor was soon\r\nflooded.  Robert went home in despair; and in the first moment of grief,\r\nhe wrote to his father that the whole thing was a failure.  By return of\r\npost came a letter from his father, telling him that despair was not to\r\nbe thought of--that he must \"try again;\" and he suggested a mode of\r\novercoming the difficulty, which his son had already anticipated and\r\nproceeded to adopt.  It was, to bore clean holes in the boiler ends, fit\r\nin the smooth copper tubes as tightly as possible, solder up, and then\r\nraise the steam.  This plan succeeded perfectly, the expansion of the\r\ncopper tubes completely filling up all interstices, and producing a\r\nperfectly watertight boiler, capable of withstanding extreme internal\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe mode of employing the steam-blast for the purpose of increasing the\r\ndraught in the chimney, was also the subject of numerous experiments.\r\nWhen the engine was first tried, it was thought that the blast in the\r\nchimney was not strong enough to keep up the intensity of the fire in the\r\nfurnace, so as to produce high-pressure steam in sufficient quantity.\r\nThe expedient was therefore adopted of hammering the copper tubes at the\r\npoint at which they entered the chimney, whereby the blast was\r\nconsiderably sharpened; and on a further trial it was found that the\r\ndraught was increased to such an extent as to enable abundance of steam\r\nto be raised.  The rationale of the blast may be simply explained by\r\nreferring to the effect of contracting the pipe of a water-hose, by which\r\nthe force of the jet of water is proportionately increased.  Widen the\r\nnozzle of the pipe, and the force is in like manner diminished.  So is it\r\nwith the steam-blast in the chimney of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nDoubts were, however, expressed whether the greater draught secured by\r\nthe contraction of the blast-pipe was not counterbalanced in some degree\r\nby the negative pressure upon the piston.  A series of experiments was\r\nmade with pipes of different diameters; the amount of vacuum produced\r\nbeing determined by a glass tube open at both ends, which was fixed to\r\nthe bottom of the smoke-box, and descended into a bucket of water.  As\r\nthe rarefaction took place, the water would of course rise in the tube;\r\nand the height to which it rose above the surface of the water in the\r\nbucket was made the measure of the amount of rarefaction.  These\r\nexperiments proved that a considerable increase of draught was obtained\r\nby the contraction of the orifice; accordingly, the two blast-pipes\r\nopening from the cylinders into either side of the \"Rocket\" chimney, and\r\nturned up within it, were contracted slightly below the area of the\r\nsteam-ports; and before the engine left the factory, the water rose in\r\nthe glass tube three inches above the water in the bucket.\r\n\r\n                         [Picture: The \"Rocket\"]\r\n\r\nThe other arrangements of the \"Rocket\" were briefly these:--the boiler\r\nwas cylindrical with flat ends, 6 feet in length, and 3 feet 4 inches in\r\ndiameter.  The upper half of the boiler was used as a reservoir for the\r\nsteam, the lower half being filled with water.  Through the lower part,\r\n25 copper tubes of 3 inches diameter extended, which were open to the\r\nfire-box at one end, and to the chimney at the other.  The fire-box, or\r\nfurnace, 2 feet wide and 3 feet high, was attached immediately behind the\r\nboiler, and was also surrounded with water.  The cylinders of the engine\r\nwere placed on each side of the boiler, in an oblique position, one end\r\nbeing nearly level with the top of the boiler at its after end, and the\r\nother pointing towards the centre of the foremost or driving pair of\r\nwheels, with which the connection was directly made from the piston-rod,\r\nto a pin on the outside of the wheel.  The engine, together with its load\r\nof water, weighed only 4.25 tons, and was supported on four wheels, not\r\ncoupled.  The tender was four-wheeled, and similar in shape to a\r\nwaggon,--the foremost part holding the fuel, and the hind part a\r\nwater-cask.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Rocket\" was finished, it was placed upon the Killingworth\r\nrailway for the purpose of experiment.  The new boiler arrangement was\r\nfound perfectly successful.  The steam was raised rapidly and\r\ncontinuously, and in a quantity which then appeared marvellous.  The same\r\nevening Robert despatched a letter to his father at Liverpool, informing\r\nhim, to his great joy, that the \"Rocket\" was \"all right,\" and would be in\r\ncomplete working trim by the day of trial.  The engine was shortly after\r\nsent by waggon to Carlisle, and thence shipped for Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe time so much longed for by George Stephenson had now arrived, when\r\nthe merit of the passenger locomotive was to be put to a public test.  He\r\nhad fought the battle for it until now almost single-handed.  Engrossed\r\nby his daily labours and anxieties, and harassed by difficulties and\r\ndiscouragements which would have crushed the spirit of a less resolute\r\nman, he had held firmly to his purpose through good and through evil\r\nreport.  The hostility which he experienced from some of the directors\r\nopposed to the adoption of the locomotive, was the circumstance that\r\ncaused him the greatest grief of all; for where he had looked for\r\nencouragement, he found only carping and opposition.  But his pluck never\r\nfailed him; and now the \"Rocket\" was upon the ground,--to prove, to use\r\nhis own words, \"whether he was a man of his word or not.\"\r\n\r\nGreat interest was felt at Liverpool, as well as throughout the country,\r\nin the approaching competition.  Engineers, scientific men, and\r\nmechanics, arrived from all quarters to witness the novel display of\r\nmechanical ingenuity on which such great results depended.  The public\r\ngenerally were no indifferent spectators either.  The inhabitants of\r\nLiverpool, Manchester, and the adjacent towns felt that the successful\r\nissue of the experiment would confer upon them individual benefits and\r\nlocal advantages almost incalculable, whilst populations at a distance\r\nwaited for the result with almost equal interest.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for the great competition of locomotives at\r\nRainhill, the following engines were entered for the prize:--\r\n\r\n1.  Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericsson's \"Novelty.\" {214}\r\n\r\n2.  Mr. Timothy Hackworth's \"Sanspareil.\"\r\n\r\n3.  Messrs. R. Stephenson and Co.'s \"Rocket.\"\r\n\r\n4.  Mr. Burstall's \"Perseverance.\"\r\n\r\nAnother engine was entered by Mr. Brandreth of Liverpool--the \"Cycloped,\"\r\nweighing 3 tons, worked by a horse in a frame, but it could not be\r\nadmitted to the competition.  The above were the only four exhibited, out\r\nof a considerable number of engines constructed in different parts of the\r\ncountry in anticipation of this contest, many of which could not be\r\nsatisfactorily completed by the day of trial.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which the engines were to be tried was a level piece of\r\nrailroad, about two miles in length.  Each was required to make twenty\r\ntrips, or equal to a journey of 70 miles, in the course of the day; and\r\nthe average rate of travelling was to be not under 10 miles an hour.  It\r\nwas determined that, to avoid confusion, each engine should be tried\r\nseparately, and on different days.\r\n\r\n              [Picture: Locomotive competition at Rainhill]\r\n\r\nThe day fixed for the competition was the 1st of October, but to allow\r\nsufficient time to get the locomotives into good working order, the\r\ndirectors extended it to the 6th.  On the morning of the 6th, the ground\r\nat Rainhill presented a lively appearance, and there was as much\r\nexcitement as if the St. Leger were about to be run.  Many thousand\r\nspectators looked on, amongst whom were some of the first engineers and\r\nmechanicians of the day.  A stand was provided for the ladies; the\r\n\"beauty and fashion\" of the neighbourhood were present, and the side of\r\nthe railroad was lined with carriages of all descriptions.\r\n\r\nIt was quite characteristic of the Stephensons, that, although their\r\nengine did not stand first on the list for trial, it was the first that\r\nwas ready; and it was accordingly ordered out by the judges for an\r\nexperimental trip.  Yet the \"Rocket\" was by no means \"the favourite\" with\r\neither the judges or the spectators.  A majority of the judges was\r\nstrongly predisposed in favour of the \"Novelty,\" and nine-tenths of those\r\npresent were against the \"Rocket\" because of its appearance.  Nearly\r\nevery person favoured some other engine, so that there was nothing for\r\nthe \"Rocket\" but the practical test.  The first trip which it made was\r\nquite successful.  It ran about 12 miles, without interruption, in about\r\n53 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe \"Novelty\" was next called out.  It was a light engine, very compact\r\nin appearance, carrying the water and fuel upon the same wheels as the\r\nengine.  The weight of the whole was only 3 tons and 1 hundredweight.  A\r\npeculiarity of this engine was that the air was driven or forced through\r\nthe fire by means of bellows.  The day being now far advanced, and some\r\ndispute having arisen as to the method of assigning the proper load for\r\nthe \"Novelty,\" no particular experiment was made, further than that the\r\nengine traversed the line by way of exhibition, occasionally moving at\r\nthe rate of 24 miles an hour.  The \"Sanspareil,\" constructed by Mr.\r\nTimothy Hackworth, was next exhibited; but no particular experiment was\r\nmade with it on this day.\r\n\r\nThe contest was postponed until the following day, but before the judges\r\narrived on the ground, the bellows for creating the blast in the\r\n\"Novelty\" gave way, and it was found incapable of going through its\r\nperformance.  A defect was also detected in the boiler of the\r\n\"Sanspareil;\" and some further time was allowed to get it repaired.  The\r\nlarge number of spectators who had assembled to witness the contest were\r\ngreatly disappointed at this postponement; but, to lessen it, Stephenson\r\nagain brought out the \"Rocket,\" and, attaching to it a coach containing\r\nthirty persons, he ran them along the line at the rate of from 24 to 30\r\nmiles an hour, much to their gratification and amazement.  Before\r\nseparating, the judges ordered the engine to be in readiness by eight\r\no'clock on the following morning, to go through its definitive trial\r\naccording to the prescribed conditions.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 8th October, the \"Rocket\" was again ready for the\r\ncontest.  The engine was taken to the extremity of the stage, the\r\nfire-box was filled with coke, the fire lighted, and the steam raised\r\nuntil it lifted the safety-valve loaded to a pressure of 50 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch.  This proceeding occupied fifty-seven minutes.  The engine\r\nthen started on its journey, dragging after it about 13 tons weight in\r\nwaggons, and made the first ten trips backwards and forwards along the\r\ntwo miles of road, running the 35 miles, including stoppages, in one hour\r\nand 48 minutes.  The second ten trips were in like manner performed in 2\r\nhours and 3 minutes.  The maximum velocity attained during the trial trip\r\nwas 29 miles an hour, or about three times the speed that one of the\r\njudges of the competition had declared to be the limit of possibility.\r\nThe average speed at which the whole of the journeys were performed was\r\n15 miles an hour, or 5 miles beyond the rate specified in the conditions\r\npublished by the Company.  The entire performance excited the greatest\r\nastonishment amongst the assembled spectators; the directors felt\r\nconfident that their enterprise was now on the eve of success; and George\r\nStephenson rejoiced to think that in spite of all false prophets and\r\nfickle counsellors, the locomotive system was now safe.  When the\r\n\"Rocket,\" having performed all the conditions of the contest, arrived at\r\nthe \"grand stand\" at the close of its day's successful run, Mr.\r\nCropper--one of the directors favourable to the fixed-engine\r\nsystem--lifted up his hands, and exclaimed, \"Now has George Stephenson at\r\nlast delivered himself!\"\r\n\r\nNeither the \"Novelty\" nor the \"Sanspareil\" was ready for trial until the\r\n10th, on the morning of which day an advertisement appeared, stating that\r\nthe former engine was to be tried on that day, when it would perform more\r\nwork than any engine upon the ground.  The weight of the carriages\r\nattached to it was only about 7 tons.  The engine passed the first post\r\nin good style; but in returning, the pipe from the forcing-pump burst and\r\nput an end to the trial.  The pipe was afterwards repaired, and the\r\nengine made several trips by itself, in which it was said to have gone at\r\nthe rate of from 24 to 28 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sanspareil\" was not ready until the 13th; and when its boiler and\r\ntender were filled with water, it was found to weigh 4 cwt. beyond the\r\nweight specified in the published conditions as the limit of four-wheeled\r\nengines; nevertheless the judges allowed it to run on the same footing as\r\nthe other engines, to enable them to ascertain whether its merits\r\nentitled it to favourable consideration.  It travelled at the average\r\nspeed of about 14 miles an hour, with its load attached; but at the\r\neighth trip the cold-water pump got wrong, and the engine could proceed\r\nno further.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to award the premium to the successful engine on the\r\nfollowing day, the 14th, on which occasion there was an unusual\r\nassemblage of spectators.  The owners of the \"Novelty\" pleaded for\r\nanother trial; and it was conceded.  But again it broke down.  The owner\r\nof the \"Sanspareil\" also requested the opportunity for making another\r\ntrial of his engine.  But the judges had now had enough of failures; and\r\nthey declined, on the ground that not only was the engine above the\r\nstipulated weight, but that it was constructed on a plan which they could\r\nnot recommend for adoption by the directors of the Company.  One of the\r\nprincipal practical objections to this locomotive was the enormous\r\nquantity of coke consumed or wasted by it--about 692 lbs. per hour when\r\ntravelling--caused by the sharpness of the steam-blast in the chimney,\r\nwhich blew a large proportion of the burning coke into the air.\r\n\r\nThe \"Perseverance\" was found unable to move at more than five or six\r\nmiles an hour; and it was withdrawn from the contest at an early period.\r\nThe \"Rocket\" was thus the only engine that had performed, and more than\r\nperformed, all the stipulated conditions; and its owners were declared to\r\nbe fully entitled to the prize of 500 pounds, which was awarded to the\r\nMessrs. Stephenson and Booth accordingly.  And further, to show that the\r\nengine had been working quite within its powers, Mr. Stephenson ordered\r\nit to be brought upon the ground and detached from all incumbrances,\r\nwhen, in making two trips, it was found to travel at the astonishing rate\r\nof 35 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rocket\" had thus eclipsed the performances of all locomotive engines\r\nthat had yet been constructed, and outstripped even the sanguine\r\nexpectations of its constructors.  It satisfactorily answered the report\r\nof Messrs. Walker and Rastrick; and established the efficiency of the\r\nlocomotive for working the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and indeed\r\nall future railways.  The \"Rocket\" showed that a new power had been born\r\ninto the world, full of activity and strength, with boundless capability\r\nof work.  It was the simple but admirable contrivance of the steam-blast,\r\nand its combination with the multitubular boiler, that at once gave the\r\nlocomotive a vigorous life, and secured the triumph of the railway\r\nsystem. {219}  It has been well observed, that this wonderful ability to\r\nincrease and multiply its powers of performance with the emergency that\r\ndemands them, has made this giant engine the noblest creation of human\r\nwit, the very lion among machines.  The success of the Rainhill\r\nexperiment, as judged by the public, may be inferred from the fact that\r\nthe shares of the Company immediately rose ten per cent., and nothing\r\nmore was heard of the proposed twenty-one fixed engines, engine-houses,\r\nropes, etc.  All this cumbersome apparatus was thenceforward effectually\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nVery different now was the tone of those directors who had distinguished\r\nthemselves by the persistency of their opposition to Mr. Stephenson's\r\nplans.  Coolness gave way to eulogy, and hostility to unbounded offers of\r\nfriendship--after the manner of many men who run to the help of the\r\nstrong.  Deeply though the engineer had felt aggrieved by the conduct\r\npursued towards him during this eventful struggle, by some from whom\r\nforbearance was to have been expected, he never entertained towards them\r\nin after life any angry feelings; on the contrary, he forgave all.  But\r\nthough the directors afterwards passed unanimous resolutions eulogising\r\n\"the great skill and unwearied energy\" of their engineer, he himself,\r\nwhen speaking confidentially to those with whom he was most intimate,\r\ncould not help pointing out the difference between his \"foul-weather and\r\nfair-weather friends.\"  Mr. Gooch says of him that though naturally most\r\ncheerful and kind-hearted in his disposition, the anxiety and pressure\r\nwhich weighed upon his mind during the construction of the railway, had\r\nthe effect of making him occasionally impatient and irritable, like a\r\nspirited horse touched by the spur; though his original good-nature from\r\ntime to time shone through it all.  When the line had been brought to a\r\nsuccessful completion, a very marked change in him became visible.  The\r\nirritability passed away, and when difficulties and vexations arose they\r\nwere treated by him as matters of course, and with perfect composure and\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Railway versus Road]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nOPENING OF THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY, AND EXTENSION OF THE\r\nRAILWAY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe directors of the Railway now began to see daylight; and they derived\r\nencouragement from the skilful manner in which their engineer had\r\novercome the principal difficulties of the undertaking.  He had formed a\r\nsolid road over Chat Moss, and thus achieved one \"impossibility;\" and he\r\nhad constructed a locomotive that could run at a speed of 30 miles an\r\nhour, thus vanquishing a still more formidable difficulty.\r\n\r\nA single line of way was completed over Chat Moss by the 1st of January,\r\n1830; and on that day, the \"Rocket\" with a carriage full of directors,\r\nengineers, and their friends, passed along the greater part of the road\r\nbetween Liverpool and Manchester.  Mr. Stephenson continued to direct his\r\nclose attention to the improvement of the details of the locomotive,\r\nevery successive trial of which proved more satisfactory.  In this\r\ndepartment he had the benefit of the able and unremitting assistance of\r\nhis son, who, in the workshops at Newcastle, directly superintended the\r\nconstruction of the new engines required for the public working of the\r\nrailway.  He did not by any means rest satisfied with the success,\r\ndecided though it was, which had been achieved by the \"Rocket.\"  He\r\nregarded it but in the light of a successful experiment; and every\r\nsucceeding engine placed upon the railway exhibited some improvement on\r\nits predecessors.  The arrangement of the parts, and the weight and\r\nproportions of the engines, were altered, as the experience of each\r\nsuccessive day, or week, or month, suggested; and it was soon found that\r\nthe performances of the \"Rocket\" on the day of trial had been greatly\r\nwithin the powers of the locomotive.\r\n\r\nThe first entire trip between Liverpool and Manchester was performed on\r\nthe 14th of June, 1830, on the occasion of a Board meeting being held at\r\nthe latter town.  The train was on this occasion drawn by the \"Arrow,\"\r\none of the new locomotives, in which the most recent improvements had\r\nbeen adopted.  Mr. Stephenson himself drove the engine, and Captain\r\nScoresby, the circumpolar navigator, stood beside him on the foot-plate,\r\nand minuted the speed of the train.  A great concourse of people\r\nassembled at both termini, as well as along the line, to witness the\r\nnovel spectacle of a train of carriages dragged by an engine at a speed\r\nof 17 miles an hour.  On the return journey to Liverpool in the evening,\r\nthe \"Arrow\" crossed Chat Moss at a speed of nearly 27 miles an hour,\r\nreaching its destination in about an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Mr. Stephenson and his assistants were diligently\r\noccupied in making the necessary preliminary arrangements for the conduct\r\nof the traffic against the time when the line should be ready for\r\nopening.  The experiments made with the object of carrying on the\r\npassenger traffic at quick velocities were of an especially harassing and\r\nanxious character.  Every week, for nearly three months before the\r\nopening, trial trips were made to Newton and back, generally with two or\r\nthree trains following each other, and carrying altogether from 200 to\r\n300 persons.  These trips were usually made on Saturday afternoons, when\r\nthe works could be more conveniently stopped and the line cleared.  In\r\nthese experiments Mr. Stephenson had the able assistance of Mr. Henry\r\nBooth, the secretary of the Company, who contrived many of the\r\narrangements in the rolling stock, not the least valuable of which was\r\nhis invention of the coupling screw, still in use on all passenger\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nAt length the line was finished, and ready for the public ceremony of the\r\nopening, which took place on the 15th September, 1830, and attracted a\r\nvast number of spectators.  The completion of the railway was justly\r\nregarded as an important national event, and the opening was celebrated\r\naccordingly.  The Duke of Wellington, then Prime Minister, Sir Robert\r\nPeel, and Mr. Huskisson, one of the members for Liverpool, were among the\r\nnumber of distinguished public personages present.\r\n\r\nEight locomotive engines, constructed at the Stephenson works, had been\r\ndelivered and placed upon the line, the whole of which had been tried and\r\ntested weeks before, with perfect success.  The several trains of\r\ncarriages accommodated in all about six hundred persons.  The procession\r\nwas cheered in its progress by thousands of spectators--through the deep\r\nravine of Olive Mount; up the Sutton incline; over the great Sankey\r\nviaduct, beneath which a great multitude of persons had\r\nassembled,--carriages filling the narrow lanes, and barges crowding the\r\nriver; the people below gazing with wonder and admiration at the trains\r\nwhich sped along the line, far above their heads, at the rate of some 24\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nAt Parkside, about 17 miles from Liverpool, the engines stopped to take\r\nin water.  Here a deplorable accident occurred to one of the illustrious\r\nvisitors, which threw a deep shadow over the subsequent proceedings of\r\nthe day.  The \"Northumbrian\" engine, with the carriage containing the\r\nDuke of Wellington, was drawn up on one line, in order that the whole of\r\nthe trains on the other line might pass in review before him and his\r\nparty.  Mr. Huskisson had alighted from the carriage, and was standing on\r\nthe opposite road, along which the \"Rocket\" was observed rapidly coming\r\nup.  At this moment the Duke of Wellington, between whom and Mr.\r\nHuskisson some coolness had existed, made a sign of recognition, and held\r\nout his hand.  A hurried but friendly grasp was given; and before it was\r\nloosened there was a general cry from the bystanders of \"Get in, get in!\"\r\nFlurried and confused, Mr. Huskisson endeavoured to get round the open\r\ndoor of the carriage, which projected over the opposite rail; but in so\r\ndoing he was struck down by the \"Rocket,\" and falling with his leg\r\ndoubled across the rail, the limb was instantly crushed.  His first\r\nwords, on being raised, were, \"I have met my death,\" which unhappily\r\nproved true, for he expired that same evening in the parsonage of Eccles.\r\nIt was cited at the time as a remarkable fact, that the \"Northumbrian\"\r\nengine, driven by George Stephenson himself, conveyed the wounded body of\r\nthe unfortunate gentleman a distance of about 15 miles in 25 minutes, or\r\nat the rate of 36 miles an hour.  This incredible speed burst upon the\r\nworld with the effect of a new and unlooked-for phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe accident threw a gloom over the rest of the day's proceedings.  The\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel expressed a wish that the\r\nprocession should return to Liverpool.  It was, however, represented to\r\nthem that a vast concourse of people had assembled at Manchester to\r\nwitness the arrival of the trains; that report would exaggerate the\r\nmischief, if they did not complete the journey; and that a false panic on\r\nthat day might seriously affect future railway travelling and the value\r\nof the Company's property.  The party consented accordingly to proceed to\r\nManchester, but on the understanding that they should return as soon as\r\npossible, and refrain from further festivity.\r\n\r\nAs the trains approached Manchester, crowds of people were found covering\r\nthe banks, the slopes of the cuttings, and even the railway itself.  The\r\nmultitude, become impatient and excited by the rumours which reached\r\nthem, had outflanked the military, and all order was at an end.  The\r\npeople clambered about the carriages, holding on by the door-handles, and\r\nmany were tumbled over; but, happily no fatal accident occurred.  At the\r\nManchester station, the political element began to display itself;\r\nplacards about \"Peterloo,\" etc., were exhibited, and brickbats were\r\nthrown at the carriage containing the Duke.  On the carriages coming to a\r\nstand in the Manchester station the Duke did not descend, but remained\r\nseated, shaking hands with the women and children who were pushed forward\r\nby the crowd.  Shortly after, the trains returned to Liverpool, which\r\nthey reached, after considerable interruptions, in the dark, at a late\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the railway was opened for public traffic.  The\r\nfirst train of 140 passengers was booked and sent on to Manchester,\r\nreaching it in the allotted period of two hours; and from that time the\r\ntraffic has regularly proceeded from day to day until now.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary that we should speak at any length of the\r\ncommercial results of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  Suffice it\r\nto say that its success was complete and decisive.  The anticipations of\r\nits projectors were, however, in many respects at fault.  They had based\r\ntheir calculations almost entirely on the heavy merchandise traffic--such\r\nas coal, cotton, and timber,--relying little upon passengers; whereas the\r\nreceipts derived from the conveyance of passengers far exceeded those\r\nderived from merchandise of all kinds, which, for a time continued a\r\nsubordinate branch of the traffic.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the public opening of the line, Mr. Stephenson's\r\ningenuity continued to be employed in devising improved methods for\r\nsecuring the safety and comfort of the travelling public.  Few are aware\r\nof the thousand minute details which have to be arranged--the forethought\r\nand contrivance that have to be exercised--to enable the traveller by\r\nrailway to accomplish his journey in safety.  After the difficulties of\r\nconstructing a level road over bogs, across valleys, and through deep\r\ncuttings, have been overcome, the maintenance of the way has to be\r\nprovided for with continuous care.  Every rail with its fastenings must\r\nbe complete, to prevent risk of accident; and the road must be kept\r\nregularly ballasted up to the level, to diminish the jolting of vehicles\r\npassing over it at high speeds.  Then the stations must be protected by\r\nsignals observable from such a distance as to enable the train to be\r\nstopped in event of an obstacle, such as a stopping or shunting train\r\nbeing in the way.  For some years the signals employed on the Liverpool\r\nrailway were entirely given by men with flags of different colours\r\nstationed along the line; there were no fixed signals, nor electric\r\ntelegraphs; but the traffic was nevertheless worked quite as safely as\r\nunder the more elaborate and complicated system of telegraphing which has\r\nsince been established.\r\n\r\nFrom an early period it became obvious that the iron road as originally\r\nlaid down was far too weak for the heavy traffic which it had to carry.\r\nThe line was at first laid with fish-bellied rails weighing thirty-five\r\npounds to the yard, calculated only for horse-traffic, or, at most, for\r\nengines like the \"Rocket,\" of very light weight.  But as the power and\r\nthe weight of the locomotives were increased, it was found that such\r\nrails were quite insufficient for the safe conduct of the traffic, and it\r\ntherefore became necessary to re-lay the road with heavier and stronger\r\nrails at considerably increased expense.\r\n\r\nThe details of the carrying stock had in like manner to be settled by\r\nexperience.  Everything had, as it were, to be begun from the beginning.\r\nThe coal-waggon, it is true, served in some degree as a model for the\r\nrailway-truck; but the railway passenger-carriage was an entirely novel\r\nstructure.  It had to be mounted upon strong framing, of a peculiar kind,\r\nsupported on springs to prevent jolting.  Then there was the necessity\r\nfor contriving some method of preventing hard bumping of the\r\ncarriage-ends when the train was pulled up; and hence the contrivance of\r\nbuffer-springs and spring frames.  For the purpose of stopping the train,\r\nbrakes on an improved plan were also contrived, with new modes of\r\nlubricating the carriage-axles, on which the wheels revolved at an\r\nunusually high velocity.  In all these arrangements, Mr. Stephenson's\r\ninventiveness was kept constantly on the stretch; and though many\r\nimprovements in detail have been effected since his time, the foundations\r\nwere then laid by him of the present system of conducting railway\r\ntraffic.  As an illustration of the inventive ingenuity which he\r\ndisplayed in providing for the working of the Liverpool line, we may\r\nmention his contrivance of the Self-acting Brake.  He early entertained\r\nthe idea that the momentum of the running train might itself be made\r\navailable for the purpose of checking its speed.  He proposed to fit each\r\ncarriage with a brake which should be called into action immediately on\r\nthe locomotive at the head of the train being pulled up.  The impetus of\r\nthe carriages carrying them forward, the buffer-springs would be driven\r\nhome and, at the same time, by a simple arrangement of the mechanism, the\r\nbrakes would be called into simultaneous action; thus the wheels would be\r\nbrought into a state of sledge, and the train speedily stopped.  This\r\nplan was adopted by Mr. Stephenson before he left the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway, though it was afterwards discontinued; but it is a\r\nremarkable fact, that this identical plan, with the addition of a\r\ncentrifugal apparatus, has quite recently been revived by M. Guerin, a\r\nFrench engineer, and extensively employed on foreign railways, as the\r\nbest method of stopping railway trains in the most efficient manner and\r\nin the shortest time.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Stephenson had to attend to the improvement of the power and\r\nspeed of the locomotive--always the grand object of his study,--with a\r\nview to economy as well as regularity of working.  In the \"Planet\"\r\nengine, delivered upon the line immediately subsequent to the public\r\nopening, all the improvements which had up to that time been contrived by\r\nhim and his son were introduced in combination--the blast-pipe, the\r\ntubular boiler, horizontal cylinders inside the smoke-box, the cranked\r\naxle, and the fire-box firmly fixed to the boiler.  The first load of\r\ngoods conveyed from Liverpool to Manchester by the \"Planet\" was 80 tons\r\nin weight, and the engine performed the journey against a strong head\r\nwind in 2.5 hours.  On another occasion, the same engine brought up a\r\ncargo of voters from Manchester to Liverpool, during a contested\r\nelection, within a space of sixty minutes!  The \"Samson,\" delivered in\r\nthe following year, exhibited still further improvements, the most\r\nimportant of which was that of _coupling_ the fore and hind wheels of the\r\nengine.  By this means, the adhesion of the wheels on the rails was more\r\neffectually secured, and thus the full hauling power of the locomotive\r\nwas made available.  The \"Samson,\" shortly after it was placed upon the\r\nline, dragged after it a train of waggons weighing 150 tons at a speed of\r\nabout 20 miles an hour; the consumption of coke being reduced to only\r\nabout a third of a pound per ton per mile.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Liverpool and Manchester experiment naturally excited\r\ngreat interest.  People flocked to Lancashire from all quarters to see\r\nthe steam-coach running upon a railway at three times the speed of a\r\nmailcoach, and to enjoy the excitement of actually travelling in the wake\r\nof an engine at that incredible velocity.  The travellers returned to\r\ntheir respective districts full of the wonders of the locomotive,\r\nconsidering it to be the greatest marvel of the age.  Railways are\r\nfamiliar enough objects now, and our children who grow up in their midst\r\nmay think little of them; but thirty years since it was an event in one's\r\nlife to see a locomotive, and to travel for the first time upon a public\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nThe practicability of railway locomotion being now proved, and its great\r\nsocial and commercial advantages ascertained, the general extension of\r\nthe system was merely a question of time, money, and labour.  Although\r\nthe legislature took no initiative step in the direction of railway\r\nextension, the public spirit and enterprise of the country did not fail\r\nit at this juncture.  The English people, though they may be defective in\r\ntheir capacity for organization, are strong in individualism; and not\r\nimprobably their admirable qualities in the latter respect detract from\r\ntheir efficiency in the former.  Thus, in all times, their greatest\r\nenterprises have not been planned by officialism and carried out upon any\r\nregular system, but have sprung, like their constitution, their laws, and\r\ntheir entire industrial arrangements, from the force of circumstances and\r\nthe individual energies of the people.\r\n\r\nThe mode of action in the case of railway extension, was characteristic\r\nand national.  The execution of the new lines was undertaken entirely by\r\njoint-stock associations of proprietors, after the manner of the Stockton\r\nand Darlington, and Liverpool and Manchester companies.  These\r\nassociations are conformable to our national habits, and fit well into\r\nour system of laws.  They combine the power of vast resources with\r\nindividual watchfulness and motives of self-interest; and by their means\r\ngigantic undertakings, which otherwise would be impossible to any but\r\nkings and emperors with great national resources at command, were carried\r\nout by the co-operation of private persons.  And the results of this\r\ncombination of means and of enterprise have been truly marvellous.\r\nWithin the life of the present generation, the private citizens of\r\nEngland engaged in railway extension have, in the face of Government\r\nobstructions, and without taking a penny from the public purse, executed\r\na system of communications involving works of the most gigantic kind,\r\nwhich, in their total mass, their cost, and their public utility, far\r\nexceed the most famous national undertakings of any age or country.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson was of course, actively engaged in the construction of the\r\nnumerous railways now projected by the joint-stock companies.  The desire\r\nfor railway extension principally pervaded the manufacturing districts,\r\nespecially after the successful opening of the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nline.  The commercial classes of the larger towns soon became eager for a\r\nparticipation in the good which they had so recently derided.  Railway\r\nprojects were set on foot in great numbers, and Manchester became a\r\ncentre from which main lines and branches were started in all directions.\r\nThe interest, however, which attaches to these later schemes is of a much\r\nless absorbing kind than that which belongs to the earlier history of the\r\nrailway and the steps by which it was mainly established.  We naturally\r\nsympathise more keenly with the early struggles of a great principle, its\r\ntrials and its difficulties, than with its after stages of success; and,\r\nhowever gratified and astonished we may be at its consequences, the\r\ninterest is in a great measure gone when its triumph has become a matter\r\nof certainty.\r\n\r\nThe commercial results of the Liverpool and Manchester line were so\r\nsatisfactory, and indeed so greatly exceeded the expectations of its\r\nprojectors, that many of the abandoned projects of the speculative year\r\n1825 were forthwith revived.  An abundant crop of engineers sprang up,\r\nready to execute railways of any extent.  Now that the Liverpool and\r\nManchester line had been made, and the practicability of working it by\r\nlocomotive power had been proved, it was as easy for engineers to make\r\nrailways and to work them, as it was for navigators to find America after\r\nColumbus had made the first voyage.  Mr. Francis Giles attached himself\r\nto the Newcastle and Carlisle and London and Southampton projects.  Mr.\r\nBrunel appeared as engineer of the line projected between London and\r\nBristol; and Mr. Braithwaite, the builder of the \"Novelty\" engine, acted\r\nin the same capacity for a railway from London to Colchester.\r\n\r\nThe first lines constructed subsequent to the opening of the Liverpool\r\nand Manchester Railway, were mostly in connection with it, and\r\nprincipally in the county of Lancaster.  Thus a branch was formed from\r\nBolton to Leigh, and another from Leigh to Kenyon, where it formed a\r\njunction with the main line between Liverpool and Manchester.  Branches\r\nto Wigan on the north, and to Runcorn Gap and Warrington on the south of\r\nthe same line, were also formed.  A continuation of the latter, as far\r\nsouth as Birmingham, was shortly after projected under the name of the\r\nGrand Junction Railway.\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned line was projected as early as the year 1824, when the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester scheme was under discussion, and Mr. Stephenson\r\nthen published a report on the subject.  The plans were deposited, but\r\nthe bill was thrown out through the opposition of the landowners and\r\ncanal proprietors.  When engaged in making the survey, Stephenson called\r\nupon some of the landowners in the neighbourhood of Nantwich to obtain\r\ntheir assent, and was greatly disgusted to learn that the agents of the\r\ncanal companies had been before him, and described the locomotive to the\r\nfarmers as a most frightful machine, emitting a breath as poisonous as\r\nthe fabled dragon of old; and telling them that if a bird flew over the\r\ndistrict where one of these engines passed, it would inevitably drop down\r\ndead!  The application for the bill was renewed in 1826, and again\r\nfailed; and at length it was determined to wait the issue of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester experiment.  The act was eventually obtained in\r\n1833.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed to extend the advantages of railways to the\r\npopulation of the midland and southern counties of England, an immense\r\namount of alarm was created in the minds of the country gentlemen.  They\r\ndid not relish the idea of private individuals, principally resident in\r\nthe manufacturing districts, invading their domains; and they everywhere\r\nrose up in arms against the \"new-fangled roads.\"  Colonel Sibthorpe\r\nopenly declared his hatred of the \"infernal railroads,\" and said that he\r\n\"would rather meet a highwayman, or see a burglar on his premises, than\r\nan engineer!\"  The impression which prevailed in the rural districts was,\r\nthat fox-covers and game-preserves would be seriously prejudiced by the\r\nformation of railroads; that agricultural communications would be\r\ndestroyed, land thrown out of cultivation, landowners and farmers reduced\r\nto beggary, the poor-rates increased through the number of persons thrown\r\nout of employment by the railways,--and all this in order that Liverpool,\r\nManchester, and Birmingham shopkeepers and manufacturers might establish\r\na monstrous monopoly in railway traffic.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of even some of the large towns were thrown into a state\r\nof consternation by the proposal to provide them with the accommodation\r\nof a railway.  The line from London to Birmingham would naturally have\r\npassed close to the handsome town of Northampton, and was so projected;\r\nbut the inhabitants of the shire, urged on by the local press, and\r\nexcited by men of influence and education, opposed the project, and\r\nsucceeded in forcing the promoters, in their survey of the line, to pass\r\nthe town at a distance.  When the first railway through Kent was\r\nprojected, the line was laid out so as to pass by Maidstone, the county\r\ntown.  But it had not a single supporter amongst the townspeople, whilst\r\nthe landowners for many miles round combined to oppose it.  In like\r\nmanner, the line projected from London to Bristol was strongly denounced\r\nby the inhabitants of the intermediate districts; and when the first bill\r\nwas thrown out, Eton assembled under the presidency of the Marquis of\r\nChandos to congratulate the country upon its defeat.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the works of the Liverpool and Manchester line were\r\nin progress, our engineer was consulted respecting a short railway\r\nproposed to be formed between Leicester and Swannington, for the purpose\r\nof opening up a communication between the town of Leicester and the\r\ncoal-fields in the western part of the county.  The projector of this\r\nundertaking had some difficulty in getting the requisite capital\r\nsubscribed for, the Leicester townspeople who had money being for the\r\nmost part interested in canals.  George Stephenson was invited to come\r\nupon the ground and survey the line.  He did so, and then the projector\r\ntold him of the difficulty he had in finding subscribers to the concern.\r\n\"Give me a sheet,\" said Stephenson, \"and I will raise the money for you\r\nin Liverpool.\"  The engineer was as good as his word, and in a short time\r\nthe sheet was returned with the subscription complete.  Mr. Stephenson\r\nwas then asked to undertake the office of engineer for the line, but his\r\nanswer was that he had thirty miles of railway in hand, which were enough\r\nfor any engineer to attend to properly.  Was there any person he could\r\nrecommend?  \"Well,\" said he, \"I think my son Robert is competent to\r\nundertake the thing.\"  Would Mr. Stephenson be answerable for him?  \"Oh,\r\nyes, certainly.\"  And Robert Stephenson, at twenty-seven years of age,\r\nwas installed engineer of the line accordingly.\r\n\r\n           [Picture: Map of Leicester and Swannington Railway]\r\n\r\nThe requisite Parliamentary powers having been obtained, Robert\r\nStephenson proceeded with the construction of the railway, about 16 miles\r\nin length, towards the end of 1830.  The works were comparatively easy,\r\nexcepting at the Leicester end, where the young engineer encountered his\r\nfirst stiff bit of tunnelling.  The line passed underground for 1.75\r\nmile, and 500 yards of its course lay in loose dry running sand.  The\r\npresence of this material rendered it necessary for the engineer first to\r\nconstruct a wooden tunnel to support the soil while the brickwork was\r\nbeing executed.  This proved sufficient, and the whole was brought to a\r\nsuccessful termination within a reasonable time.  While the works were in\r\nprogress, Robert kept up a regular correspondence with his father at\r\nLiverpool, consulting him on all points in which his greater experience\r\nwas likely to be of service.  Like his father, Robert was very observant,\r\nand always ready to seize opportunity by the forelock.  It happened that\r\nthe estate of Snibston, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, was advertised for sale;\r\nand the young engineer's experience as a coal-viewer and practical\r\ngeologist suggested to his mind that coal was most probably to be found\r\nunderneath.  He communicated his views to his father on the subject.  The\r\nestate lay in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway; and if the\r\nconjecture proved correct, the finding of coal would necessarily greatly\r\nenhance its value.  He accordingly requested his father to come over to\r\nSnibston and look at the property, which he did; and after a careful\r\ninspection of the ground, he arrived at the same conclusion as his son.\r\n\r\nThe large manufacturing town of Leicester, about fourteen miles distant,\r\nhad up to that time been exclusively supplied with coal brought by canal\r\nfrom Derbyshire; and Mr. Stephenson saw that the railway under\r\nconstruction from Swannington to Leicester, would furnish him with a\r\nready market for any coals which he might find at Snibston.  Having\r\ninduced two of his Liverpool friends to join him in the venture, the\r\nSnibston estate was purchased in 1831: and shortly after, Stephenson\r\nremoved his home from Liverpool to Alton Grange, for the purpose of\r\nsuperintending the sinking of the pit.  He travelled thither by gig with\r\nhis wife,--his favourite horse \"Bobby\" performing the journey by easy\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nSinking operations were immediately begun, and proceeded satisfactorily\r\nuntil the old enemy, water, burst in upon the workmen, and threatened to\r\ndrown them out.  But by means of efficient pumping-engines, and the\r\nskilful casing of the shaft with segments of cast-iron--a process called\r\n\"tubbing,\" {234} which Mr. Stephenson was the first to adopt in the\r\nMidland Counties--it was eventually made water-tight, and the sinking\r\nproceeded.  When a depth of 166 feet had been reached, a still more\r\nformidable difficulty presented itself--one which had baffled former\r\nsinkers in the neighbourhood, and deterred them from further operations.\r\nThis was a remarkable bed of whinstone or green-stone, which had\r\noriginally been poured out as a sheet of burning lava over the denuded\r\nsurface of the coal measures; indeed it was afterwards found that it had\r\nturned to cinders one part of the seam of coal with which it had come in\r\ncontact.  The appearance of this bed of solid rock was so unusual a\r\ncircumstance in coal mining, that some experienced sinkers urged\r\nStephenson to proceed no further, believing the occurrence of the dyke at\r\nthat point to be altogether fatal to his enterprise.  But, with his faith\r\nstill firm in the existence of coal underneath, he fell back on his old\r\nmotto of \"Persevere.\"  He determined to go on boring; and down through\r\nthe solid rock he went until, twenty-two feet lower, he came upon the\r\ncoal measures.  In the mean time, however, lest the boring at that point\r\nshould prove unsuccessful, he had commenced sinking another pair of\r\nshafts about a quarter of a mile west of the \"fault;\" and after about\r\nnine months' labour he reached the principal seam, called the \"main\r\ncoal.\"\r\n\r\nThe works were then opened out on a large scale, and Mr. Stephenson had\r\nthe pleasure and good fortune to send the first train of main coal to\r\nLeicester by railway.  The price was immediately reduced to about 8s. a\r\nton, effecting a pecuniary saving to the inhabitants of the town of about\r\n40,000 pounds per annum, or equivalent to the whole amount then collected\r\nin Government taxes and local rates, besides giving an impetus to the\r\nmanufacturing prosperity of the place, which has continued down to the\r\npresent day.  The correct principles upon which the mining operations at\r\nSnibston were conducted offered a salutary example to the neighbouring\r\ncolliery owners.  The numerous improvements there introduced were freely\r\nexhibited to all, and they were afterwards reproduced in many forms all\r\nover the Midland Counties, greatly to the advantage of the mining\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Stephenson less attentive to the comfort and well-being of\r\nthose immediately dependent upon him--the workpeople of the Snibston\r\ncolliery and their families.  Unlike many of those large employers who\r\nhave \"sprung from the ranks,\" he was one of the kindest and most\r\nindulgent of masters.  He would have a fair day's work for a fair day's\r\nwages; but he never forgot that the employer had his duties as well as\r\nhis rights.  First of all, he attended to the proper home accommodation\r\nof his workpeople.  He erected a village of comfortable cottages, each\r\nprovided with a snug little garden.  He was also instrumental in erecting\r\na church adjacent to the works, as well as Church schools for the\r\neducation of the colliers' children; and with that broad catholicity of\r\nsentiment which distinguished him, he further provided a chapel and a\r\nschool-house for the use of the Dissenting portion of the colliers and\r\ntheir families--an example of benevolent liberality which was not without\r\na salutary influence upon the neighbouring employers.\r\n\r\n              [Picture: Stephenson's House at Alton Grange]\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Robert Stephenson]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nROBERT STEPHENSON CONSTRUCTS THE LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the numerous extensive projects which followed close upon the\r\ncompletion of the Liverpool and Manchester line, and the Locomotive\r\ntriumph at Rainhill, that of a railway between London and Birmingham was\r\nthe most important.  The scheme originated at the latter place in 1830.\r\nTwo committees were formed, and two plans were proposed.  One was of a\r\nline to London by way of Oxford, and the other by way of Coventry.  The\r\nsimple object of the promoters of both schemes being to secure the\r\nadvantages of railway communication with the metropolis, they wisely\r\ndetermined to combine their strength to secure it.  They then resolved to\r\ncall George Stephenson to their aid, and requested him to advise them as\r\nto the two schemes which were before them.  After a careful examination\r\nof the country, Mr. Stephenson reported in favour of the Coventry route,\r\nwhen the Lancashire gentlemen, who were the principal subscribers to the\r\nproject, having every confidence in his judgment, supported his decision,\r\nand the line recommended by him was adopted accordingly.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the promoters held at Birmingham to determine on the\r\nappointment of the engineer for the railway, there was a strong party in\r\nfavour of associating with Mr. Stephenson a gentleman with whom he had\r\nbeen brought into serious collision in the course of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester undertaking.  When the offer was made to him that he should be\r\njoint engineer with the other, he requested leave to retire and consider\r\nthe proposal with his son.  The father was in favour of accepting it.\r\nHis struggle heretofore had been so hard that he could not bear the idea\r\nof missing so promising an opportunity of professional advancement.  But\r\nthe son, foreseeing the jealousies and heartburnings which the joint\r\nengineership would most probably create, recommended his father to\r\ndecline the connection.  George adopted the suggestion, and returning to\r\nthe Committee, he announced to them his decision; on which the promoters\r\ndecided to appoint him the engineer of the undertaking in conjunction\r\nwith his son.\r\n\r\nThis line, like the Liverpool and Manchester, was very strongly opposed,\r\nespecially by the landowners.  Numerous pamphlets were published, calling\r\non the public to \"beware of the bubbles,\" and holding up the promoters of\r\nrailways to ridicule.  They were compared to St. John Long and similar\r\nquacks, and pronounced fitter for Bedlam than to be left at large.  The\r\ncanal proprietors, landowners, and road trustees, made common cause\r\nagainst them.  The failure of railways was confidently predicted--indeed,\r\nit was elaborately attempted to be proved that they had failed; and it\r\nwas industriously spread abroad that the locomotive engines, having been\r\nfound useless and highly dangerous on the Liverpool and Manchester line,\r\nwere immediately to be abandoned in favour of horses--a rumour which the\r\ndirectors of the Company thought it necessary publicly to contradict.\r\n\r\nPublic meetings were held in all the counties through which the line\r\nwould pass between London and Birmingham, at which the project was\r\ndenounced, and strong resolutions against it were passed.  The attempt\r\nwas made to conciliate the landlords by explanations, but all such\r\nefforts proved futile, the owners of nearly seven-eighths of the land\r\nbeing returned as dissentients.  \"I remember,\" said Robert Stephenson,\r\ndescribing the opposition, \"that we called one day on Sir Astley Cooper,\r\nthe eminent surgeon, in the hope of overcoming his aversion to the\r\nrailway.  He was one of our most inveterate and influential opponents.\r\nHis country house at Berkhampstead was situated near the intended line,\r\nwhich passed through part of his property.  We found a courtly,\r\nfine-looking old gentleman, of very stately manners, who received us\r\nkindly and heard all we had to say in favour of the project.  But he was\r\nquite inflexible in his opposition to it.  No deviation or improvement\r\nthat we could suggest had any effect in conciliating him.  He was opposed\r\nto railways generally, and to this in particular.  'Your scheme,' said\r\nhe, 'is preposterous in the extreme.  It is of so extravagant a\r\ncharacter, as to be positively absurd.  Then look at the recklessness of\r\nyour proceedings!  You are proposing to cut up our estates in all\r\ndirections for the purpose of making an unnecessary road.  Do you think\r\nfor one moment of the destruction of property involved by it?  Why,\r\ngentlemen, if this sort of thing be permitted to go on, you will in a\r\nvery few years _destroy the noblesse_!'  We left the honourable baronet\r\nwithout having produced the slightest effect upon him, excepting perhaps,\r\nit might be, increased exasperation against our scheme.  1 could not help\r\nobserving to my companions as we left the house, 'Well, it is really\r\nprovoking to find one who has been made a \"Sir\" for cutting that wen out\r\nof George the Fourth's neck, charging us with contemplating the\r\ndestruction of the _noblesse_, because we propose to confer upon him the\r\nbenefits of a railroad.'\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the opposition of the owners of land, it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that an accurate survey of the line could be made.  At one\r\npoint the vigilance of the landowners and their servants was such, that\r\nthe surveyors were effectually prevented taking the levels by the light\r\nof day; and it was only at length accomplished at night by means of dark\r\nlanterns.  There was one clergyman, who made such alarming demonstrations\r\nof his opposition, that the extraordinary expedient was resorted to of\r\nsurveying his property during the time he was engaged in the pulpit.\r\nThis was managed by having a strong force of surveyors in readiness to\r\ncommence their operations, who entered the clergyman's grounds on one\r\nside the moment they saw him fairly off them on the other.  By a\r\nwell-organised and systematic arrangement each man concluded his allotted\r\ntask just as the reverend gentleman concluded his sermon; so that, before\r\nhe left the church, the deed was done, and the sinners had all decamped.\r\nSimilar opposition was offered at many other points, but ineffectually.\r\nThe laborious application of Robert Stephenson was such, that in\r\nexamining the country to ascertain the best line, he walked the whole\r\ndistance between London and Birmingham upwards of twenty times.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill went before the Committee of the Commons in 1832, a\r\nformidable array of evidence was produced.  All the railway experience of\r\nthe day was brought to bear in support of the measure, and all that\r\ninterested opposition could do was set in motion against it.  The\r\nnecessity for an improved mode of communication between London and\r\nBirmingham was clearly demonstrated; and the engineering evidence was\r\nregarded as quite satisfactory.  Not a single fact was proved against the\r\nutility of the measure, and the bill passed the Committee, and afterwards\r\nthe third reading in the Commons, by large majorities.\r\n\r\nIt was then sent to the Lords, and went into Committee, when a similar\r\nmass of testimony was again gone through.  But it had been evident, from\r\nthe opening of the proceedings, that the fate of the bill had been\r\ndetermined before even a word of the evidence had been heard.  At that\r\ntime the committees were open to all peers; and the promoters of the bill\r\nfound, to their dismay, many of the lords who were avowed opponents of\r\nthe measure as landowners, sitting as judges to decide its fate.  Their\r\nprincipal object seemed to be, to bring the proceedings to a termination\r\nas quickly as possible.  An attempt at negotiation was indeed made in the\r\ncourse of the proceedings in committee, but failed, and the bill was\r\nthrown out.\r\n\r\nAs the result had been foreseen, measures were taken to neutralise the\r\neffect of this decision as regarded future operations.  Not less than\r\n32,000 pounds had been expended in preliminary and parliamentary expenses\r\nup to this stage; but the promoters determined not to look back, and\r\nforthwith made arrangements for prosecuting the bill in the next session.\r\nStrange to say, the bill then passed both Houses silently and almost\r\nwithout opposition.  The mystery was afterwards solved by the appearance\r\nof a circular issued by the directors of the company, in which it was\r\nstated, that they had opened \"negotiations\" with the most influential of\r\ntheir opponents; that \"these measures had been successful to a greater\r\nextent than they had ventured to anticipate; and the most active and\r\nformidable had been conciliated.\"  An instructive commentary on the mode\r\nby which these noble lords and influential landed proprietors had been\r\n\"conciliated,\" was the simple fact that the estimate for land was nearly\r\ntrebled, and that the owners were paid about 750,000 pounds for what had\r\nbeen originally estimated at 250,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe landowners having thus been \"conciliated,\" the promoters of the\r\nmeasure were permitted to proceed with the formation of their great\r\nhighway.  Robert Stephenson was, with the sanction of his father,\r\nappointed sole engineer; and steps were at once taken by him to make the\r\nworking survey, to prepare the working drawings, and arrange for the\r\nconstruction of the railway.  Eighty miles of the road were shortly under\r\ncontract, having been let within the estimates; and the works were in\r\nsatisfactory progress by the beginning of 1834.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties encountered in their construction were very great; the\r\nmost formidable of them originating in the character of the works\r\nthemselves.  Extensive tunnels had to be driven through unknown strata,\r\nand miles of underground excavation had to be carried out in order to\r\nform a level road from valley to valley, under the intervening ridges.\r\nThis kind of work was the newest of all to the contractors of that day.\r\nRobert Stephenson's experience in the collieries of the North rendered\r\nhim well fitted to grapple with such difficulties; yet even he, with all\r\nhis practical knowledge, could scarcely have foreseen the serious\r\nobstacles which he was called upon to encounter in executing the\r\nformidable cuttings, embankments, and tunnels of the London and\r\nBirmingham Railway.  It would be an uninteresting, as it would be a\r\nfruitless task, to attempt to describe the works in detail; but a general\r\noutline of their extraordinary character and extent may not be out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Rugby to Watford]\r\n\r\nThe length of railway to be constructed between London and Birmingham was\r\n112.5 miles.  The line crossed a series of low-lying districts separated\r\nfrom each other by considerable ridges of hills; and it was the object of\r\nthe engineer to cross the valleys at as high, and the hills at as low,\r\nelevations as possible.  The high ground was therefore cut down and the\r\n\"stuff\" led into embankments, in some places of great height and extent,\r\nso as to form a road upon as level a plane as was considered practicable\r\nfor the working of the locomotive engine.  In some places, the high\r\ngrounds were passed in open cuttings, whilst in others it was necessary\r\nto bore through them in tunnels with deep cuttings at each end.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable excavations on the line are those at Tring, Denbigh\r\nHall, and Blisworth.  The Tring cutting is an immense chasm across the\r\ngreat chalk ridge of Ivinghoe.  It is 2.5 miles long, and for 0.25 of a\r\nmile is 57 feet deep.  A million and a half cubic yards of chalk and\r\nearth were taken out of this cutting by means of horse-runs and deposited\r\nin spoil banks; besides the immense quantity run into the embankment\r\nnorth of the cutting, forming a solid mound nearly 6 miles long and about\r\n30 feet high.  Passing over the Denbigh Hall cutting, and the Wolverton\r\nembankment of 1.5 mile in length across the valley of the Ouse, we come\r\nto the excavation at Blisworth, a brief description of which will give\r\nthe reader an idea of one of the most difficult kinds of railway work.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Blisworth Cutting]\r\n\r\nThe Blisworth Cutting is one of the longest and deepest grooves cut in\r\nthe solid earth.  It is 1.5 mile long, in some places 65 feet deep,\r\npassing through earth, stiff clay, and hard rock.  Not less than a\r\nmillion cubic yards of these materials were dug, quarried, and blasted\r\nout of it.  One-third of the cutting was stone, and beneath the stone lay\r\na thick bed of clay, under which were found beds of loose shale so full\r\nof water that almost constant pumping was necessary at many points to\r\nenable the works to proceed.  For a year and a half the contractor went\r\non fruitlessly contending with these difficulties, and at length he was\r\ncompelled to abandon the adventure.  The engineer then took the works in\r\nhand for the Company, and they were vigorously proceeded with.\r\nSteam-engines were set to work to pump out the water; two locomotives\r\nwere put on, one at each end of the cutting, to drag away the excavated\r\nrock and clay; and 800 men and boys were employed along the work, in\r\ndigging, wheeling, and blasting, besides a large number of horses.  Some\r\nidea of the extent of the blasting operations may be formed from the fact\r\nthat 25 barrels of gunpowder were used weekly; the total quantity\r\nexploded in forming this one cutting being about 3,000 barrels.\r\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced in supporting the bed of rock cut\r\nthrough, which overlaid the clay and shale along each side of the\r\ncutting.  It was found necessary to hold it up by strong retaining walls,\r\nto prevent the clay bed from bulging out, and these walls were further\r\nsupported by a strong invert,--that is, an arch placed in an inverted\r\nposition under the road,--thus binding together the walls on both sides.\r\nBehind the retaining walls, a drift or horizontal drain was provided to\r\nenable the water to run off, and occasional openings were left in the\r\nwalls themselves for the same purpose.  The work was at length brought to\r\na successful completion, but the extraordinary difficulties encountered\r\nin forming the cutting had the effect of greatly increasing the cost of\r\nthis portion of the railway.\r\n\r\nThe Tunnels on the line are eight in number, their total length being\r\n7336 yards.  The first high ground encountered was Primrose Hill, where\r\nthe stiff London clay was passed through for a distance of about 1164\r\nyards.  The clay was close, compact, and dry, more difficult to work than\r\nstone itself.  It was entirely free from water; but the absorbing\r\nproperties of the clay were such that when exposed to the air it swelled\r\nout rapidly.  Hence an unusual thickness of brick lining was found\r\nnecessary; and the engineer afterwards informed the author that for some\r\ntime he entertained an apprehension lest the pressure should force in the\r\nbrickwork altogether.  It was so great that it made the face of the\r\nbricks to fly off in minute chips which covered his clothes whilst he was\r\ninspecting the work.  The materials used in the building were, however,\r\nof excellent quality; and the tunnel was happily brought to a completion\r\nwithout any accident.\r\n\r\nAt Watford the chalk ridge was penetrated by a tunnel about 1800 yards\r\nlong; and at Northchurch, Lindslade, and Stowe Hill, there were other\r\ntunnels of minor extent.  But the chief difficulty of the undertaking was\r\nthe execution of that under the Kilsby ridge.  Though not the largest,\r\nthis is in many respects one of the most interesting works of the kind in\r\nEngland.  It is about 2400 yards long, and runs at an average depth of\r\nabout 160 feet below the surface.  The ridge under which it extends is of\r\nconsiderable extent, the famous battle of Naseby having been fought upon\r\none of the spurs of the same high ground about seven miles to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the letting of the contract, the character of the underground\r\nsoil was examined by trial-shafts.  The tests indicated that it consisted\r\nof shale of the lower oolite, and the works were let accordingly.  But\r\nthey had scarcely been commenced when it was discovered that, at an\r\ninterval between the two trial-shafts which had been sunk, about 200\r\nyards from the south end of the tunnel, there existed an extensive\r\nquicksand under a bed of clay 40 feet thick, which the borings had\r\nescaped in the most singular manner.  At the bottom of one of these\r\nshafts the excavation and building of the tunnel were proceeding, when\r\nthe roof at one part suddenly gave way, a deluge of water burst in, and\r\nthe party of workmen with the utmost difficulty escaped with their lives.\r\nThey were only saved by means of a raft, on which they were towed by one\r\nof the engineers swimming with the rope in his mouth to the lower end of\r\nthe shaft, out of which they were safely lifted to the daylight.  The\r\nworks were of course at that point immediately stopped.\r\n\r\n                 [Picture: The Shafts over Kilsby Tunnel]\r\n\r\nThe contractor, who had undertaken the construction of the tunnel, was so\r\noverwhelmed by the calamity, that, though he was relieved by the Company\r\nfrom his engagement, he took to his bed and shortly after died.\r\nPumping-engines were then erected for the purpose of draining off the\r\nwater, but for a long time it prevailed, and sometimes even rose in the\r\nshaft.  The question then presented itself, whether in the face of so\r\nformidable a difficulty, the works should be proceeded with or abandoned.\r\nRobert Stephenson sent over to Alton Grange for his father, and the two\r\ntook serious counsel together.  George was in favour of pumping out the\r\nwater from the top by powerful engines erected over each shaft, until the\r\nwater was mastered.  Robert concurred in that view, and although other\r\nengineers pronounced strongly against the practicability of the scheme\r\nand advised its abandonment, the directors authorised him to proceed; and\r\npowerful steam-engines were ordered to be constructed and delivered\r\nwithout loss of time.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Robert suggested to his father the expediency of\r\nrunning a drift along the heading from the south end of the tunnel, with\r\nthe view of draining off the water in that way.  George said he thought\r\nit would scarcely answer, but that it was worth a trial, at all events\r\nuntil the pumping-engines were got ready.  Robert accordingly gave orders\r\nfor the drift to be proceeded with.  The excavators were immediately set\r\nto work; and they were very soon close upon the sand bed.  One day, when\r\nthe engineer, his assistants, and the workmen were clustered about the\r\nopen entrance of the drift-way, they heard a sudden roar as of distant\r\nthunder.  It was hoped that the water had burst in--for all the workmen\r\nwere out of the drift,--and that the sand bed would now drain itself off\r\nin a natural way.  Instead of which, very little water made its\r\nappearance; and on examining the inner end of the drift, it was found\r\nthat the loud noise had been caused by the sudden discharge into it of an\r\nimmense mass of sand, which had completely choked up the passage, and\r\nprevented the water from flowing away.\r\n\r\nThe engineer now found that there was nothing for it but to sink numerous\r\nadditional shafts over the line of the tunnel at the points at which it\r\ncrossed the quicksand, and endeavour to master the water by sheer force\r\nof engines and pumps.  The engines erected, possessed an aggregate power\r\nof 160 horses; and they went on pumping for eight successive months,\r\nemptying out an almost incredible quantity of water.  It was found that\r\nthe water, with which the bed of sand extending over many miles was\r\ncharged, was to a certain degree held back by the particles of the sand\r\nitself, and that it could only percolate through at a certain average\r\nrate.  It appeared in its flow to take a slanting direction to the\r\nsuction of the pumps, the angle of inclination depending upon the\r\ncoarseness or fineness of the sand, and regulating the time of the flow.\r\nHence the distribution of the pumping power at short intervals along the\r\nline of the tunnel had a much greater effect than the concentration of\r\nthat power at any one spot.  It soon appeared that the water had found\r\nits master.  Protected by the pumps, which cleared a space for the\r\nengineering operations--carried on in the midst, as it were, of two\r\nalmost perpendicular walls of water and sand on either side--the workmen\r\nproceeded with the building of the tunnel at numerous points.  Every\r\nexertion was used to wall in the dangerous parts as quickly as possible;\r\nthe excavators and bricklayers labouring night and day until the work was\r\nfinished.  Even while under the protection of the immense pumping power\r\nabove described, it often happened that the bricks were scarcely covered\r\nwith cement ready for the setting, ere they were washed quite clean by\r\nthe streams of water which poured from overhead.  The men were\r\naccordingly under the necessity of holding over their work large whisks\r\nof straw and other appliances to protect the bricks and cement at the\r\nmoment of setting.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water pumped out of the sand bed during eight months of\r\nincessant pumping, averaged 2,000 gallons per minute, raised from an\r\naverage depth of 120 feet.  It is difficult to form an adequate idea of\r\nthe bulk of the water thus raised, but it may be stated that if allowed\r\nto flow for three hours only, it would fill a lake one acre square to the\r\ndepth of one foot, and if allowed to flow for one entire day it would\r\nfill the lake to over eight feet in depth, or sufficient to float vessels\r\nof 100 tons burthen.  The water pumped out of the tunnel while the work\r\nwas in progress would be nearly equivalent to the contents of the Thames\r\nat high water, between London and Woolwich.  It is a curious circumstance\r\nthat notwithstanding the quantity thus removed, the level of the surface\r\nof the water in the tunnel was only lowered about 2.5 to 3 inches per\r\nweek, proving the vast area of the quicksand, which probably extended\r\nalong the entire ridge of land under which the railway passed.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the line was greatly increased by the difficulties\r\nencountered at Kilsby.  The original estimate for the tunnel was only\r\n99,000 pounds; but before it was finished it had cost more than 100\r\npounds per lineal yard forward, or a total of nearly 300,000 pounds.  The\r\nexpenditure on the other parts of the line also greatly exceeded the\r\namount first set down by the engineer; and before the works were finished\r\nit was more than doubled.  The land cost three times more than the\r\nestimate; and the claims for compensation were enormous.  Although the\r\ncontracts were let within the estimates, very few of the contractors were\r\nable to complete them without the assistance of the Company, and many\r\nbecame bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the works, which were unprecedented in England, was one\r\nof the most remarkable features in the undertaking.  The following\r\nstriking comparison has been made between this railway and one of the\r\ngreatest works of ancient times.  The Great Pyramid of Egypt was,\r\naccording to Diodorus Siculus, constructed by 300,000--according to\r\nHerodotus, by 100,000--men.  It required for its execution twenty years,\r\nand the labour expended upon it has been estimated as equivalent to\r\nlifting 15,733,000,000 of cubic feet of stone one foot high.  Whereas, if\r\nthe labour expended in constructing the London and Birmingham Railway be\r\nin like manner reduced to one common denomination the result is\r\n25,000,000,000 of cubic feet _more_ than was lifted for the Great\r\nPyramid; and yet the English work was performed by about 20,000 men in\r\nless than five years.  And whilst the Egyptian work was executed by a\r\npowerful monarch concentrating upon it the labour and capital of a great\r\nnation, the English railway was constructed, in the face of every\r\nconceivable obstruction and difficulty, by a company of private\r\nindividuals out of their own resources, without the aid of Government or\r\nthe contribution of one farthing of public money.\r\n\r\nThe labourers who executed this formidable work were in many respects a\r\nremarkable class.  The \"railway navvies,\" as they are called, were men\r\ndrawn by the attraction of good wages from all parts of the kingdom; and\r\nthey were ready for any sort of hard work.  Some of the best came from\r\nthe fen districts of Lincoln and Cambridge, where they had been trained\r\nto execute works of excavation and embankment.  These old practitioners\r\nformed a nucleus of skilled manipulation and aptitude, which rendered\r\nthem of indispensable utility in the immense undertakings of the period.\r\nTheir expertness in all sorts of earthwork, in embanking, boring, and\r\nwell-sinking--their practical knowledge of the nature of soils and rocks,\r\nthe tenacity of clays, and the porosity of certain stratifications--were\r\nvery great; and, rough-looking though they were, many of them were as\r\nimportant in their own department as the contractor or the engineer.\r\n\r\nDuring the railway-making period the navvy wandered about from one public\r\nwork to another--apparently belonging to no country and having no home.\r\nHe usually wore a white felt hat with the brim turned up, a velveteen or\r\njean square-tailed coat, a scarlet plush waistcoat with little black\r\nspots, and a bright-coloured kerchief round his herculean neck, when, as\r\noften happened, it was not left entirely bare.  His corduroy breeches\r\nwere retained in position by a leathern strap round the waist, and were\r\ntied and buttoned at the knee, displaying beneath a solid calf and foot\r\nencased in strong high-laced boots.  Joining together in a \"butty gang,\"\r\nsome ten or twelve of these men would take a contract to cut out and\r\nremove so much \"dirt\"--as they denominated earth-cutting--fixing their\r\nprice according to the character of the \"stuff,\" and the distance to\r\nwhich it had to be wheeled and tipped.  The contract taken, every man put\r\nhimself on his mettle; if any was found skulking, or not putting forth\r\nhis full working power, he was ejected from the gang.  Their powers of\r\nendurance were extraordinary.  In times of emergency they would work for\r\n12 and even 16 hours, with only short intervals for meals.  The quantity\r\nof flesh-meat which they consumed was something enormous; but it was to\r\ntheir bones and muscles what coke is to the locomotive--the means of\r\nkeeping up the steam.  They displayed great pluck, and seemed to\r\ndisregard peril.  Indeed the most dangerous sort of labour--such as\r\nworking horse-barrow runs, in which accidents are of constant\r\noccurrence--has always been most in request amongst them, the danger\r\nseeming to be one of its chief recommendations.\r\n\r\nWorking, eating, drinking, and sleeping together, and daily exposed to\r\nthe same influences, these railway labourers soon presented a distinct\r\nand well-defined character, strongly marking them from the population of\r\nthe districts in which they laboured.  Reckless alike of their lives as\r\nof their earnings, the navvies worked hard and lived hard.  For their\r\nlodging, a hut of turf would content them; and, in their hours of\r\nleisure, the meanest public-house would serve for their parlour.\r\nUnburdened, as they usually were, by domestic ties, unsoftened by family\r\naffection, and without much moral or religious training, the navvies came\r\nto be distinguished by a sort of savage manners, which contrasted\r\nstrangely with those of the surrounding population.  Yet, ignorant and\r\nviolent though they might be, they were usually good-hearted fellows in\r\nthe main--frank and openhanded with their comrades, and ready to share\r\ntheir last penny with those in distress.  Their pay-nights were often a\r\nsaturnalia of riot and disorder, dreaded by the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages along the line of works.  The irruption of such men into the\r\nquiet hamlet of Kilsby must, indeed, have produced a very startling\r\neffect on the recluse inhabitants of the place.  Robert Stephenson used\r\nto tell a story of the clergyman of the parish waiting upon the foreman\r\nof one of the gangs to expostulate with him as to the shocking\r\nimpropriety of his men working during Sunday.  But the head navvy merely\r\nhitched up his trousers, and said, \"Why, Soondays hain't cropt out here\r\nyet!\"  In short, the navvies were little better than heathens, and the\r\nvillage of Kilsby was not restored to its wonted quiet until the\r\ntunnel-works were finished, and the engines and scaffoldings removed,\r\nleaving only the immense masses of _debris_ around the line of shafts\r\nwhich extend along the top of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the extraordinary working energy and powers of\r\nendurance of the English navvies, we may mention that when railway-making\r\nextended to France, the English contractors for the works took with them\r\ngangs of English navvies, with the usual plant, which included\r\nwheelbarrows.  These the English navvy was accustomed to run out rapidly\r\nand continuously, piled so high with \"stuff\" that he could barely see\r\nover the summit of his load, the gang-board along which he wheeled his\r\nbarrow.  While he thus easily ran out some 3 or 4 cwt. at a time, the\r\nFrench navvy was contented with half the weight.  Indeed, the French\r\nnavvies on one occasion struck work because of the size of the English\r\nbarrows, and there was an _emeute_ on the Rouen Railway, which was only\r\nquelled by the aid of the military.  The consequence was that the big\r\nbarrows were abandoned to the English workmen, who earned nearly double\r\nthe wages of the Frenchmen.  The manner in which they stood to their work\r\nwas matter of great surprise and wonderment to the French countrypeople,\r\nwho came crowding round them in their blouses, and, after gazing\r\nadmiringly at their expert handling of the pick and mattock, and the\r\nimmense loads of \"dirt\" which they wheeled out, would exclaim to each\r\nother, \"_Mon Dieu_, _voila_! _voila ces Anglais_, _comme ils\r\ntravaillent_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nMANCHESTER AND LEEDS, AND MIDLAND RAILWAYS--STEPHENSON'S LIFE AT\r\nALTON--VISIT TO BELGIUM--GENERAL EXTENSION OF RAILWAYS AND THEIR RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which railways were carried out, when the spirit of the\r\ncountry became roused, was indeed remarkable.  This was doubtless in some\r\nmeasure owing to the increased force of the current of speculation at the\r\ntime, but chiefly to the desire which the public began to entertain for\r\nthe general extension of the system.  It was even proposed to fill up the\r\ncanals, and convert them into railways.  The new roads became the topic\r\nof conversation in all circles; they were felt to give a new value to\r\ntime; their vast capabilities for \"business\" peculiarly recommended them\r\nto the trading classes; whilst the friends of \"progress\" dilated on the\r\ngreat benefits they would eventually confer upon mankind at large.  It\r\nbegan to be seen that Edward Pease had not been exaggerating when he\r\nsaid, \"Let the country but make the railroads, and the railroads will\r\nmake the country!\"  They also came to be regarded as inviting objects of\r\ninvestment to the thrifty, and a safe outlet for the accumulations of\r\ninert men of capital.  Thus new avenues of iron road were soon in course\r\nof formation, branching in all directions, so that the country promised\r\nin a wonderfully short time to become wrapped in one vast network of\r\niron.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the Grand Junction Railway was under construction between\r\nWarrington and Birmingham--the northern part by Mr. Stephenson, and the\r\nsouthern by Mr. Rastrick.  The works on that line embraced heavy\r\ncuttings, long embankments, and numerous viaducts; but none of these are\r\nworthy of any special description.  Perhaps the finest piece of masonry\r\non the railway is the Dutton Viaduct across the valley of the Weaver.  It\r\nconsists of twenty arches of 60 feet span, springing 16 feet from the\r\nperpendicular shaft of each pier, and 60 feet in height from the crown of\r\nthe arches to the level of the river.  The foundations of the piers were\r\nbuilt on piles driven 20 feet deep.  The structure has a solid and\r\nmajestic appearance, and is perhaps the finest of George Stephenson's\r\nviaducts.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: The Dutton Viaduct]\r\n\r\nThe Manchester and Leeds line was in progress at the same time--an\r\nimportant railway connecting the principal manufacturing towns of\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire.  An attempt was made to obtain the Act as early\r\nas 1831; but its promoters were defeated by the powerful opposition of\r\nthe landowners aided by the canal companies, and the project was not\r\nrevived for several years.  The line was somewhat circuitous, and the\r\nworks were heavy; but on the whole the gradients were favourable, and it\r\nhad the advantage of passing through a district full of manufacturing\r\ntowns and villages, teeming hives of population, industry, and\r\nenterprise.  The Act authorising the construction of the railway was\r\nobtained in 1836; it was greatly amended in the succeeding year, and the\r\nfirst ground was broken on the 18th August, 1837.\r\n\r\nIn conducting this project to an issue, the engineer had the usual\r\nopposition and prejudices to encounter.  Predictions were confidently\r\nmade in many quarters that the line could never succeed.  It was declared\r\nthat the utmost engineering skill could not construct a railway through\r\nsuch a country of hills and hard rocks; and it was maintained that, even\r\nif the railroad were practicable, it could only be made at a ruinous\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the works, as the Summit Tunnel, near\r\nLittleborough, was approaching completion, the rumour was spread abroad\r\nin Manchester that the tunnel had fallen in and buried a number of the\r\nworkmen.  The last arch had been keyed in, and the work was all but\r\nfinished, when the accident occurred which was thus exaggerated by the\r\nlying tongue of rumour.  An invert had given way through the irregular\r\npressure of the surrounding earth and rock at a part of the tunnel where\r\na \"fault\" had occurred in the strata.  A party of the directors\r\naccompanied the engineer to inspect the scene of the accident.  They\r\nentered the tunnel's mouth preceded by upwards of fifty navvies, each\r\nbearing a torch.\r\n\r\nAfter walking a distance of about half a mile, the inspecting party\r\narrived at the scene of the \"frightful accident,\" about which so much\r\nalarm had been spread.  All that was visible was a certain unevenness of\r\nthe ground, which had been forced up by the invert under it giving way;\r\nthus the ballast had been loosened, the drain running along the centre of\r\nthe road had been displaced, and small pools of water stood about.  But\r\nthe whole of the walls and the roof were still as perfect as at any other\r\npart of the tunnel.\r\n\r\n         [Picture: Entrance to the Summit Tunnel, Littleborough]\r\n\r\nThe engineer explained the cause of the accident; the blue shale, he\r\nsaid, through which the excavation passed at that point, was considered\r\nso hard and firm, as to render it unnecessary to build the invert very\r\nstrong there.  But shale is always a deceptive material.  Subjected to\r\nthe influence of the atmosphere, it gives but a treacherous support.  In\r\nthis case, falling away like quicklime, it had left the lip of the invert\r\nalone to support the pressure of the arch above, and hence its springing\r\ninwards and upwards.  Mr. Stephenson directed the attention of the\r\nvisitors to the completeness of the arch overhead, where not the\r\nslightest fracture or yielding could be detected.  Speaking of the work,\r\nin the course of the same day, he said, \"I will stake my character and my\r\nhead, if that tunnel ever give way, so as to cause danger to any of the\r\npublic passing through it.  Taking it as a whole, I don't think there is\r\nsuch another piece of work in the world.  It is the greatest work that\r\nhas yet been done of this kind, and there has been less repairing than is\r\nusual,--though an engineer might well be beaten in his calculations, for\r\nhe cannot beforehand see into those little fractured parts of the earth\r\nhe may meet with.\"  As Stephenson had promised, the invert was put in;\r\nand the tunnel was made perfectly safe.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this subterranean road employed the labour of above a\r\nthousand men for nearly four years.  Besides excavating the arch out of a\r\nsolid rock, they used 23,000,000 of bricks, and 8000 tons of Roman cement\r\nin the building of the tunnel.  Thirteen stationary engines, and about\r\n100 horses, were also employed in drawing the earth and stone out of the\r\nshafts.  Its entire length is 2869 yards, or nearly 1.75 mile--exceeding\r\nthe famous Kilsby Tunnel by 471 yards.\r\n\r\nThe Midland Railway was a favourite line of Mr. Stephenson's for several\r\nreasons.  It passed through a rich mining district, in which it opened up\r\nmany valuable coalfields, and it formed part of the great main line of\r\ncommunication between London and Edinburgh.  The Act was obtained in\r\n1836, and the first ground was broken in February, 1837.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Midland Railway was only one of the many great works of the\r\nsame kind executed at that time, it was almost enough of itself to be the\r\nachievement of a life.  Compare it, for example with Napoleon's military\r\nroad over the Simplon, and it will at once be seen how greatly it excels\r\nthat work, not only in the constructive skill displayed in it, but also\r\nin its cost and magnitude, and the amount of labour employed in its\r\nformation.  The road of the Simplon is 45 miles in length; the North\r\nMidland Railway is 72.5 miles.  The former has 50 bridges and 5 tunnels,\r\nmeasuring together 1338 feet in length; the latter has 200 bridges and 7\r\ntunnels, measuring together 11,400 feet, or about 2.25 miles.  The former\r\ncost about 720,000 pounds sterling, the latter above 3,000,000 pounds.\r\nNapoleon's grand military road was constructed in six years, at the\r\npublic cost of the two great kingdoms of France and Italy; while\r\nStephenson's railway was formed in about three years, by a company of\r\nprivate merchants and capitalists out of their own funds, and under their\r\nown superintendence.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary that we should give any account in detail of the\r\nNorth Midland works.  The making of one tunnel so much resembles the\r\nmaking of another,--the building of bridges and viaducts, no matter how\r\nextensive, so much resembles the building of others,--the cutting out of\r\n\"dirt,\" the blasting of rocks, and the wheeling of excavation into\r\nembankments, is so much a matter of mere time and hard work,--that is\r\nquite unnecessary for us to detain the reader by any attempt at their\r\ndescription.  Of course there were the usual difficulties to encounter\r\nand overcome,--but the railway engineer regarded these as mere matters of\r\ncourse, and would probably have been disappointed if they had not\r\npresented themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the Midland, as on other lines, water was the great enemy to be fought\r\nagainst,--water in the Claycross and other tunnels,--water in the boggy\r\nor sandy foundations of bridges,--and water in cuttings and embankments.\r\nAs an illustration of the difficulties of bridge building, we may mention\r\nthe case of the five-arch bridge over the Derwent, where it took two\r\nyears' work, night and day, to get in the foundations of the piers alone.\r\nAnother curious illustration of the mischief done by water in cuttings\r\nmay be briefly mentioned.  At a part of the North Midland Line, near\r\nAmbergate, it was necessary to pass along a hillside in a cutting a few\r\nyards deep.  As the cutting proceeded, a seam of shale was cut across,\r\nlying at an inclination of 6 to 1; and shortly after, the water getting\r\nbehind the bed of shale, the whole mass of earth along the hill above\r\nbegan to move down across the line of excavation.  The accident\r\ncompletely upset the estimates of the contractor, who, instead of 50,000\r\ncubic yards, found that he had about 500,000 to remove; the execution of\r\nthis part of the railway occupying fifteen months instead of two.\r\n\r\n        [Picture: Land-slip on North Midland Line, near Ambergate]\r\n\r\nThe Oakenshaw cutting near Wakefield was also of a very formidable\r\ncharacter.  About 600,000 yards of rock shale and bind were quarried out\r\nof it, and led to form the adjoining Oakenshaw embankment.  The Normanton\r\ncutting was almost as heavy, requiring the removal of 400,000 yards of\r\nthe same kind of excavation into embankment and spoil.  But the progress\r\nof the works on the line was so rapid in 1839, that not less than 450,000\r\ncubic yards of excavation were removed monthly.\r\n\r\n                  [Picture: Bullbridge, near Ambergate]\r\n\r\nAs a curiosity in construction, we may also mention a very delicate piece\r\nof work executed on the same railway at Bullbridge in Derbyshire, where\r\nthe line at the same point passes _over_ a bridge which here spans the\r\nriver Amber, and _under_ the bed of the Cromford Canal.  Water, bridge;\r\nrailway, and canal, were thus piled one above the other, four stories\r\nhigh; such another curious complication probably not existing.  In order\r\nto prevent the possibility of the waters of the canal breaking in upon\r\nthe works of the railroad, Mr. Stephenson had an iron trough made, 150\r\nfeet long, of the width of the canal, and exactly fitting the bottom.  It\r\nwas brought to the spot in three pieces, which were firmly welded\r\ntogether, and the trough was then floated into its place and sunk; the\r\nwhole operation being completed without in the least interfering with the\r\nnavigation of the canal.  The railway works underneath were then\r\nproceeded with and finished.\r\n\r\nAnother line of the same series constructed by George Stephenson, was the\r\nYork and North Midland, extending from Normanton--a point on the Midland\r\nRailway--to York; but it was a line of easy formation, traversing a\r\ncomparatively level country.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that our engineer was engaged in superintending the\r\nexecution of these undertakings, he was occupied upon other projected\r\nrailways in various parts of the country.  He surveyed several lines in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Glasgow, and afterwards routes along the east coast\r\nfrom Newcastle to Edinburgh, with the view of completing the main line of\r\ncommunication with London.  When out on foot in the fields, on these\r\noccasions, he was ever foremost in the march; and he delighted to test\r\nthe prowess of his companions by a good jump at any hedge or ditch that\r\nlay in their way.  His companions used to remark his singular quickness\r\nof observation.  Nothing escaped his attention--the trees, the crops, the\r\nbirds, or the farmer's stock; and he was usually full of lively\r\nconversation, everything in nature affording him an opportunity for\r\nmaking some striking remark, or propounding some ingenious theory.  When\r\ntaking a flying survey of a new line, his keen observation proved very\r\nuseful to him, for he rapidly noted the general configuration of the\r\ncountry, and inferred its geological structure.  He afterwards remarked\r\nto a friend, \"I have planned many a railway travelling along in a\r\npostchaise, and following the natural line of the country.\"  And it was\r\nremarkable that his first impressions of the direction to be taken almost\r\ninvariably proved correct; and there are few of the lines surveyed and\r\nrecommended by him which have not been executed, either during his\r\nlifetime or since.  As an illustration of his quick and shrewd\r\nobservation on such occasions, we may mention that when employed to lay\r\nout a line to connect Manchester, through Macclesfield, with the\r\nPotteries, the gentleman who accompanied him on the journey of inspection\r\ncautioned him to provide large accommodation for carrying off the water,\r\nobserving--\"You must not judge by the appearance of the brooks; for after\r\nheavy rains these hills pour down volumes of _water_, of which you can\r\nhave no conception.\"  \"Pooh! pooh! _don't I see your bridges_?\" replied\r\nthe engineer.  He had noted the details of each as he passed along.\r\n\r\nAmong the other projects which occupied his attention about the same\r\ntime, were the projected lines between Chester and Holyhead, between\r\nLeeds and Bradford, and between Lancaster and Maryport by the western\r\ncoast.  This latter was intended to form part of a west-coast line to\r\nScotland; Stephenson favouring it partly because of the flatness of the\r\ngradients, and also because it could be formed at comparatively small\r\ncost, whilst it would open out a valuable iron-mining district, from\r\nwhich a large traffic in ironstone was expected.  One of its collateral\r\nadvantages, in the engineer's opinion, was, that by forming the railway\r\ndirectly across Morecambe Bay, on the north-west coast of Lancashire, a\r\nlarge tract of valuable land might be reclaimed from the sea, the sale of\r\nwhich would considerably reduce the cost of the works.  He estimated that\r\nby means of a solid embankment across the bay, not less than 40,000 acres\r\nof rich alluvial land would be gained.  He proposed to carry the road\r\nacross the ten miles of sands which lie between Poulton, near Lancaster,\r\nand Humphrey Head on the opposite coast, forming the line in a segment of\r\na circle of five miles' radius.  His plan was to drive in piles across\r\nthe entire length, forming a solid fence of stone blocks on the land side\r\nfor the purpose of retaining the sand and silt brought down by the rivers\r\nfrom the interior.  The embankment would then be raised from time to time\r\nas the deposit accumulated, until the land was filled up to high-water\r\nmark; provision being made by means of sufficient arches, for the flow of\r\nthe river waters into the bay.  The execution of the railway after this\r\nplan would, however, have occupied more years than the promoters of the\r\nWest Coast line were disposed to wait; and eventually Mr. Locke's more\r\ndirect but uneven line by Shap Fell was adopted.  A railway has since\r\nbeen carried across the head of the bay; and it is not improbable that\r\nStephenson's larger scheme of reclaiming the vast tract of land now left\r\nbare at each receding tide, may yet be carried out.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied in carrying out the great railway undertakings which we\r\nhave above so briefly described, Mr. Stephenson's home continued, for the\r\ngreater part of the time, to be at Alton Grange, near Leicester.  But he\r\nwas so much occupied in travelling about from one committee of directors\r\nto another--one week in England, another in Scotland, and probably the\r\nnext in Ireland,--that he often did not see his home for weeks together.\r\nHe had also to make frequent inspections of the various important and\r\ndifficult works in progress, especially on the Midland and Manchester and\r\nLeeds lines; besides occasionally going to Newcastle to see how the\r\nlocomotive works were going on there.  During the three years ending in\r\n1837--perhaps the busiest years of his life {263}--he travelled by\r\npostchaise alone upwards of 20,000 miles, and yet not less than six\r\nmonths out of the three years were spent in London.  Hence there is\r\ncomparatively little to record of Mr. Stephenson's private life at this\r\nperiod; during which he had scarcely a moment that he could call his own.\r\n\r\nHis correspondence increased so much, that he found it necessary to\r\nengage a private secretary, who accompanied him on his journeys.  He was\r\nhimself exceedingly averse to writing letters.  The comparatively\r\nadvanced age at which ho learnt the art of writing, and the nature of his\r\nduties while engaged at the Killingworth colliery, precluded that\r\nfacility in correspondence which only constant practice can give.  He\r\ngradually, however, acquired great facility in dictation, and possessed\r\nthe power of labouring continuously at this work; the gentleman who acted\r\nas his secretary in 1835, having informed us that during his busy season\r\nhe one day dictated not fewer than 37 letters, several of them embodying\r\nthe results of much close thinking and calculation.  On another occasion,\r\nhe dictated reports and letters for twelve continuous hours, until his\r\nsecretary was ready to drop off his chair from sheer exhaustion, and at\r\nlength he pleaded for a suspension of the labour.  This great mass of\r\ncorrespondence, although closely bearing on the subjects under\r\ndiscussion, was not, however, of a kind to supply the biographer with\r\nmatter for quotation, or give that insight into the life and character of\r\nthe writer which the letters of literary men so often furnish.  They\r\nwere, for the most part, letters of mere business, relating to works in\r\nprogress, parliamentary contests, new surveys, estimates of cost, and\r\nrailway policy,--curt, and to the point; in short, the letters of a man\r\nevery moment of whose time was precious.  He was also frequently called\r\nupon to inspect and report upon colliery works, salt works, brass and\r\ncopper works, and such like, in addition to his own colliery and railway\r\nbusiness.  And occasionally he would run up to London, for the purpose of\r\nattending in person to the preparation and deposit of the plans and\r\nsections of the projected undertakings of which he had been appointed\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nFortunately Stephenson possessed a facility of sleeping, which enabled\r\nhim to pass through this enormous amount of fatigue and labour without\r\ninjury to his health.  He had been trained in a hard school, and could\r\nbear with ease conditions which, to men more softly nurtured, would have\r\nbeen the extreme of physical discomfort.  Many, many nights he snatched\r\nhis sleep while travelling in his chaise; and at break of day he would be\r\nat work, surveying until dark, and this for weeks in succession.  His\r\nwhole powers seemed to be under the control of his will, for he could\r\nwake at any hour, and go to work at once.  It was difficult for\r\nsecretaries and assistants to keep up with such a man.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to record that in the midst of these engrossing\r\noccupations, his heart remained as soft and loving as ever.  In\r\nspring-time he would not be debarred of his boyish pursuit of\r\nbird-nesting; but would go rambling along the hedges spying for nests.\r\nIn the autumn he went nutting, and when he could snatch a few minutes he\r\nindulged in his old love of gardening.  His uniform kindness and good\r\ntemper, and his communicative, intelligent disposition, made him a great\r\nfavourite with the neighbouring farmers, to whom he would volunteer much\r\nvaluable advice on agricultural operations, drainage, ploughing, and\r\nlabour-saving processes.  Sometimes he took a long rural ride on his\r\nfavourite \"Bobby,\" now growing old, but as fond of his master as ever.\r\nTowards the end of his life, \"Bobby\" lived in clover, its master's pet,\r\ndoing no work; and he died at Tapton, in 1845, more than twenty years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nDuring one of George's brief sojourns at the Grange, he found time to\r\nwrite to his son a touching account of a pair of robins that had built\r\ntheir nest within one of the upper chambers of the house.  One day he\r\nobserved a robin fluttering outside the windows, and beating its wings\r\nagainst the panes, as if eager to gain admission.  He went up stairs, and\r\nthere found, in a retired part of one of the rooms, a robin's nest, with\r\none of the parent birds sitting over three or four young--all dead.  The\r\nexcluded bird outside still beat against the panes; and on the window\r\nbeing let down, it flew into the room, but was so exhausted that it\r\ndropped upon the floor.  Mr. Stephenson took up the bird, carried it down\r\nstairs, had it warmed and fed.  The poor robin revived, and for a time\r\nwas one of his pets.  But it shortly died too, as if unable to recover\r\nfrom the privations it had endured during its three days' fluttering and\r\nbeating at the windows.  It appeared that the room had been unoccupied,\r\nand, the sash having been let down, the robins had taken the opportunity\r\nof building their nest within it; but the servant having closed the\r\nwindow again, the calamity befel the birds which so strongly excited Mr.\r\nStephenson's sympathies.  An incident such as this, trifling though it\r\nmay seem, gives the true key to the heart of the man.\r\n\r\nThe amount of their Parliamentary business having greatly increased with\r\nthe projection of new lines of railway, the Stephensons found it\r\nnecessary to set up an office in London in 1836.  George's first office\r\nwas at 9, Duke Street, Westminster, from whence he removed in the\r\nfollowing year to 30.5, Great George-street.  That office was the busy\r\nscene of railway politics for several years.  There consultations were\r\nheld, schemes were matured, deputations were received, and many\r\nprojectors called upon our engineer for the purpose of submitting to him\r\ntheir plans of railways and railway working.  His private secretary at\r\nthe time has informed us that at the end of the first Parliamentary\r\nsession in which he had been engaged as engineer for more companies than\r\none, it became necessary for him to give instructions as to the\r\npreparation of the accounts to be rendered to the respective companies.\r\nIn the simplicity of his heart, he directed Mr. Binns to take his full\r\ntime at the rate of ten guineas a day, and charge the railway companies\r\nin the proportion in which he had been actually employed on their\r\nrespective business during each day.  When Robert heard of this\r\ninstruction, he went directly to his father and expostulated with him\r\nagainst this unprofessional course; and, other influences being brought\r\nto bear upon him, George at length reluctantly consented to charge as\r\nother engineers did, an entire day's fee to each of the Companies for\r\nwhich he was concerned whilst their business was going forward; but he\r\ncut down the number of days charged for and reduced the daily amount from\r\nten to seven guineas.\r\n\r\nBesides his journeys at home, Mr. Stephenson was on more than one\r\noccasion called abroad on railway business.  Thus, at the desire of King\r\nLeopold, he made several visits to Belgium to assist the Belgian\r\nengineers in laying out the national lines of that kingdom.  That\r\nenlightened monarch at an early period discerned the powerful\r\ninstrumentality of railways in developing a country's resources, and he\r\ndetermined at the earliest possible period to adopt them as the great\r\nhigh-roads of the nation.  The country, being rich in coal and minerals,\r\nhad great manufacturing capabilities.  It had good ports, fine navigable\r\nrivers, abundant canals, and a teeming, industrious population.  Leopold\r\nperceived that railways were eminently calculated to bring the industry\r\nof the country into full play, and to render the riches of the provinces\r\navailable to the rest of the kingdom.  He therefore openly declared\r\nhimself the promoter of public railways throughout Belgium.  A system of\r\nlines was projected, at his instance, connecting Brussels with the chief\r\ntowns and cities of the kingdom; extending from Ostend eastward to the\r\nPrussian frontier, and from Antwerp southward to the French frontier.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson and his son, as the leading railway-engineers of England,\r\nwere consulted by the King on the best mode of carrying out his important\r\nplans, as early as 1835.  In the course of that year they visited\r\nBelgium, and had several interesting conferences with Leopold and his\r\nministers on the subject of the proposed railways.  The King then\r\nappointed George Stephenson by royal ordinance a Knight of the Order of\r\nLeopold.  At the invitation of the monarch, Mr. Stephenson made a second\r\nvisit to Belgium in 1837, on the occasion of the public opening of the\r\nline from Brussels to Ghent.  At Brussels there was a public procession,\r\nand another at Ghent on the arrival of the train.  Stephenson and his\r\nparty accompanied it to the Public Hall, there to dine with the chief\r\nMinisters of State, the municipal authorities, and about five hundred of\r\nthe principal inhabitants of the city; the English Ambassador being also\r\npresent.  After the King's health and a few others had been drunk, that\r\nof Mr. Stephenson was proposed; on which the whole assembly rose up,\r\namidst great excitement and loud applause, and made their way to where he\r\nsat, in order to jingle glasses with him, greatly to his own amazement.\r\nOn the day following, our engineer dined with the King and Queen at their\r\nown table at Laaken, by special invitation; afterwards accompanying his\r\nMajesty and suite to a public ball given by the municipality of Brussels,\r\nin honour of the opening of the line to Ghent, as well as of their\r\ndistinguished English guest.  On entering the room, the general and\r\nexcited inquiry was, \"Which is Stephenson?\"  The English engineer had not\r\nbefore imagined that he was esteemed to be so great a man.\r\n\r\nThe London and Birmingham Railway having been completed in September,\r\n1838, after being about five years in progress, the great main system of\r\nrailway communication between London, Liverpool, and Manchester was then\r\nopened to the public.  For some months previously, the line had been\r\npartially opened, coaches performing the journey between Denbigh Hall\r\n(near Wolverton) and Rugby,--the works of the Kilsby tunnel being still\r\nincomplete.  It was already amusing to hear the complaints of the\r\ntravellers about the slowness of the coaches as compared with the\r\nrailway, though the coaches travelled at the speed of eleven miles an\r\nhour.  The comparison of comfort was also greatly to the disparagement of\r\nthe coaches.  Then the railway train could accommodate any quantity,\r\nwhilst the road conveyances were limited; and when a press of travellers\r\noccurred--as on the occasion of the Queen's coronation--the greatest\r\ninconvenience was experienced, and as much as 10 pounds was paid for a\r\nseat on a donkey-chaise between Rugby and Denbigh.  On the opening of the\r\nrailway throughout, of course all this inconvenience and delay was\r\nbrought to an end.\r\n\r\nNumerous other openings of railways constructed by Mr. Stephenson took\r\nplace about the same time.  The Birmingham and Derby line was opened for\r\ntraffic in August, 1839; the Sheffield and Rotherham in November, 1839;\r\nand in the course of the following year, the Midland, the York and North\r\nMidland, the Chester and Crewe, the Chester and Birkenhead, the\r\nManchester and Birmingham, the Manchester and Leeds, and the Maryport and\r\nCarlisle railways, were all publicly opened in whole or in part.  Thus\r\n321 miles of railway (exclusive of the London and Birmingham) constructed\r\nunder Mr. Stephenson's superintendence, at a cost of upwards of eleven\r\nmillions sterling, were, in the course of about two years, added to the\r\ntraffic accommodation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies which accompanied the public opening of these lines were\r\noften of an interesting character.  The adjoining population held general\r\nholiday; bands played, banners waved, and assembled thousands cheered the\r\npassing trains amidst the occasional booming of cannon.  The proceedings\r\nwere usually wound up by a public dinner; and in the course of the\r\nspeeches which followed, Mr. Stephenson would revert to his favourite\r\ntopic--the difficulties which he had early encountered in the promotion\r\nof the railway system, and in establishing the superiority of the\r\nlocomotive.  On such occasions he always took great pleasure in alluding\r\nto the services rendered to himself and the public by the young men\r\nbrought up under his eye--his pupils at first, and afterwards his\r\nassistants.  No great master ever possessed a more devoted band of\r\nassistants and fellow-workers than he did.  It was one of the most marked\r\nevidences of his own admirable tact and judgment that he selected, with\r\nsuch undeviating correctness, the men best fitted to carry out his plans.\r\nIndeed, the ability to accomplish great things, and to carry grand ideas\r\ninto practical effect, depends in no small measure on that intuitive\r\nknowledge of character, which Stephenson possessed in so remarkable a\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner at York, which followed the partial opening of the York and\r\nNorth Midland Railway, Mr. Stephenson said, \"he was sure they would\r\nappreciate his feelings when he told them, that when he first began\r\nrailway business his hair was black, although it was now grey; and that\r\nhe began his life's labour as but a poor ploughboy.  About thirty years\r\nsince, he had applied himself to the study of how to generate high\r\nvelocities by mechanical means.  He thought he had solved that problem;\r\nand they had for themselves seen, that day, what perseverance had brought\r\nhim too.  He was, on that occasion, only too happy to have an opportunity\r\nof acknowledging that he had, in the latter portion of his career,\r\nreceived much most valuable assistance, particularly from young men\r\nbrought up in his manufactory.  Whenever talent showed itself in a young\r\nman he had always given that talent encouragement where he could, and he\r\nwould continue to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThat this was no exaggerated statement is amply proved by many facts\r\nwhich redound to Mr. Stephenson's credit.  He was no niggard of\r\nencouragement and praise when he saw honest industry struggling for a\r\nfooting.  Many were the young men whom, in the course of his useful\r\ncareer, he took by the hand and led steadily up to honour and emolument,\r\nsimply because he had noted their zeal, diligence, and integrity.  One\r\nyouth excited his interest while working as a common carpenter on the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester line; and before many years had passed, he was\r\nrecognised as an engineer of distinction.  Another young man he found\r\nindustriously working away at his bye-hours, and, admiring his diligence,\r\nengaged him for his private secretary, the gentleman shortly after rising\r\nto a position of eminent influence and usefulness.  Indeed, nothing gave\r\nMr. Stephenson greater pleasure than in this way to help on any deserving\r\nyouth who came under his observation, and, in his own expressive phrase,\r\nto \"make a man of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe openings of the great main lines of railroad communication shortly\r\nproved the fallaciousness of the numerous rash prophecies which had been\r\npromulgated by the opponents of railways.  The proprietors of the canals\r\nwere astounded by the fact that, notwithstanding the immense traffic\r\nconveyed by rail, their own traffic and receipts continued to increase;\r\nand that, in common with other interests, they fully shared in the\r\nexpansion of trade and commerce which had been so effectually promoted by\r\nthe extension of the railway system.  The cattle-owners were equally\r\namazed to find the price of horse-flesh increasing with the extension of\r\nrailways, and that the number of coaches running to and from the new\r\nrailway stations gave employment to a greater number of horses than under\r\nthe old stage-coach system.  Those who had prophesied the decay of the\r\nmetropolis, and the ruin of the suburban cabbage-growers, in consequence\r\nof the approach of railways to London, were also disappointed; for, while\r\nthe new roads let citizens out of London, they let country-people in.\r\nTheir action, in this respect, was centripetal as well as centrifugal.\r\nTens of thousands who had never seen the metropolis could now visit it\r\nexpeditiously and cheaply; and Londoners who had never visited the\r\ncountry, or but rarely, were enabled, at little cost of time or money, to\r\nsee green fields and clear blue skies, far from the smoke and bustle of\r\ntown.  If the dear suburban-grown cabbages became depreciated in value,\r\nthere were truck-loads of fresh-grown country cabbages to make amends for\r\nthe loss: in this case, the \"partial evil\" was a far more general good.\r\nThe food of the metropolis became rapidly improved, especially in the\r\nsupply of wholesome meat and vegetables.  And then the price of coals--an\r\narticle which, in this country, is as indispensable as daily food to all\r\nclasses--was greatly reduced.  What a blessing to the metropolitan poor\r\nis described in this single fact!\r\n\r\nThe prophecies of ruin and disaster to landlords and farmers were equally\r\nconfounded by the openings of the railways.  The agricultural\r\ncommunications, so far from being \"destroyed,\" as had been predicted,\r\nwere immensely improved.  The farmers were enabled to buy their coals,\r\nlime, and manure for less money, while they obtained a readier access to\r\nthe best markets for their stock and farm-produce.  Notwithstanding the\r\npredictions to the contrary, their cows gave milk as before, their sheep\r\nfed and fattened, and even skittish horses ceased to shy at the passing\r\nlocomotive.  The smoke of the engines did not obscure the sky, nor were\r\nfarmyards burnt up by the fire thrown from the locomotives.  The farming\r\nclasses were not reduced to beggary; on the contrary, they soon felt\r\nthat, so far from having anything to dread, they had very much good to\r\nexpect from the extension of railways.\r\n\r\nLandlords also found that they could get higher rents for farms situated\r\nnear a railway than at a distance from one.  Hence they became clamorous\r\nfor \"sidings.\"  They felt it to be a grievance to be placed at a distance\r\nfrom a station.  After a railway had been once opened, not a landlord\r\nwould consent to have the line taken from him.  Owners who had fought the\r\npromoters before Parliament, and compelled them to pass their domains at\r\na distance, at a vastly-increased expense in tunnels and deviations, now\r\npetitioned for branches and nearer station accommodation.  Those who held\r\nproperty near towns, and had extorted large sums as compensation for the\r\nanticipated deterioration in the value of their building land, found a\r\nnew demand for it springing up at greatly advanced prices.  Land was now\r\nadvertised for sale, with the attraction of being \"near a railway\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\nThe prediction that, even if railways were made, the public would not use\r\nthem, was also completely falsified by the results.  The ordinary mode of\r\nfast travelling for the middle classes had heretofore been by mail-coach\r\nand stage-coach.  Those who could not afford to pay the high prices\r\ncharged for such conveyances went by waggon, and the poorer classes\r\ntrudged on foot.  George Stephenson was wont to say that he hoped to see\r\nthe day when it would be cheaper for a poor man to travel by railway than\r\nto walk, and not many years passed before his expectation was fulfilled.\r\nIn no country in the world is time worth more money than in England; and\r\nby saving time--the criterion of distance--the railway proved a great\r\nbenefactor to men of industry in all classes.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the more opulent, who could afford to post to\r\ntown in aristocratic style, became reconciled to railway travelling.  In\r\nthe opinion of many, it was only another illustration of the levelling\r\ntendencies of the age.  It put an end to that gradation of rank in\r\ntravelling which was one of the few things left by which the nobleman\r\ncould be distinguished from the Manchester manufacturer and bagman.  But\r\nto younger sons of noble families the convenience and cheapness of the\r\nrailway did not fail to recommend itself.  One of these, whose eldest\r\nbrother had just succeeded to an earldom, said one day to a railway\r\nmanager: \"I like railways--they just suit young fellows like me with\r\n'nothing per annum paid quarterly.'  You know we can't afford to post,\r\nand it used to be deuced annoying to me, as I was jogging along on the\r\nbox-seat of the stage-coach, to see the little Earl go by drawn by his\r\nfour posters, and just look up at me and give me a nod.  But now, with\r\nrailways, it's different.  It's true, he may take a first-class ticket,\r\nwhile I can only afford a second-class one, but _we both go the same\r\npace_.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time, however, many of the old families sent forward their servants\r\nand luggage by railroad, and condemned themselves to jog along the old\r\nhighway in the accustomed family chariot, dragged by country post-horses.\r\nBut the superior comfort of the railway shortly recommended itself to\r\neven the oldest families; posting went out of date; post-horses were with\r\ndifficulty to be had along even the great high-roads; and nobles and\r\nservants, manufacturers and peasants, alike shared in the comfort, the\r\nconvenience, and the despatch of railway travelling.  The late Dr.\r\nArnold, of Rugby, regarded the opening of the London and Birmingham line\r\nas another great step accomplished in the march of civilisation.  \"I\r\nrejoice to see it,\" he said, as he stood on one of the bridges over the\r\nrailway, and watched the train flashing along under him, and away through\r\nthe distant hedgerows--\"I rejoice to see it, and to think that feudality\r\nis gone for ever: it is so great a blessing to think that any one evil is\r\nreally extinct.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long before the late Duke of Wellington would trust himself behind\r\na locomotive.  The fatal accident to Mr. Huskisson, which had happened\r\nbefore his eyes, contributed to prejudice him strongly against railways,\r\nand it was not until the year 1843 that he performed his first trip on\r\nthe South-Western Railway, in attendance upon her Majesty.  Prince Albert\r\nhad for some time been accustomed to travel by railway alone, but in 1842\r\nthe Queen began to make use of the same mode of conveyance between\r\nWindsor and London.  Even Colonel Sibthorpe was eventually compelled to\r\nacknowledge its utility.  For a time he continued to post to and from the\r\ncountry as before.  Then he compromised the matter by taking a railway\r\nticket for the long journey, and posting only a stage or two nearest\r\ntown; until, at length, he undisguisedly committed himself, like other\r\npeople, to the express train, and performed the journey throughout upon\r\nwhat he had formerly denounced as \"the infernal railroad.\"\r\n\r\n                [Picture: Coalville and Snibston Colliery]\r\n\r\n                [Picture: Tapton House, near Chesterfield]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nGEORGE STEPHENSON'S COAL MINES--APPEARS AT MECHANICS' INSTITUTES--HIS\r\nOPINION ON RAILWAY SPEEDS--ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM--RAILWAY MANIA--VISITS TO\r\nBELGIUM AND SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile George Stephenson was engaged in carrying on the works of the\r\nMidland Railway in the neighbourhood of Chesterfield, several seams of\r\ncoal were cut through in the Claycross Tunnel, and it occurred to him\r\nthat if mines were opened out there, the railway would provide the means\r\nof a ready sale for the article in the midland counties, and as far south\r\nas even the metropolis itself.\r\n\r\nAt a time when everybody else was sceptical as to the possibility of\r\ncoals being carried from the midland counties to London, and sold there\r\nat a price to compete with those which were seaborne, he declared his\r\nfirm conviction that the time was fast approaching when the London market\r\nwould be regularly supplied with north-country coals led by railway.  One\r\nof the greatest advantages of railways, in his opinion was that they\r\nwould bring iron and coal, the staple products of the country, to the\r\ndoors of all England.  \"The strength of Britain,\" he would say, \"lies in\r\nher iron and coal beds; and the locomotive is destined, above all other\r\nagencies, to bring it forth.  The Lord Chancellor now sits upon a bag of\r\nwool; but wool has long ceased to be emblematical of the staple commodity\r\nof England.  He ought rather to sit upon a bag of coals, though it might\r\nnot prove quite so comfortable a seat.  Then think of the Lord Chancellor\r\nbeing addressed as the noble and learned lord _on the coal-sack_!  I am\r\nafraid it wouldn't answer, after all.\"\r\n\r\nTo one gentleman he said: \"We want from the coal-mining, the\r\niron-producing and manufacturing districts, a great railway for the\r\ncarriage of these valuable products.  We want, if I may so say, a stream\r\nof steam running directly through the country, from the North to London,\r\nand from other similar districts to London.  Speed is not so much an\r\nobject as utility and cheapness.  It will not do to mix up the heavy\r\nmerchandise and coal trains with the passenger trains.  Coal and most\r\nkinds of goods can wait; but passengers will not.  A less perfect road\r\nand less expensive works will do well enough for coal trains, if run at a\r\nlow speed; and if the line be flat, it is not of much consequence whether\r\nit be direct or not.  Whenever you put passenger trains on a line, all\r\nthe other trains must be run at high speeds to keep out of their way.\r\nBut coal trains run at high speeds pull the road to pieces, besides\r\ncausing large expenditure in locomotive power; and I doubt very much\r\nwhether they will pay after all; but a succession of long coal trains, if\r\nrun at from ten to fourteen miles an hour, would pay very well.  Thus the\r\nStockton and Darlington Company made a larger profit when running coal at\r\nlow speeds at a halfpenny a ton per mile, than they have been able to do\r\nsince they put on their fast passenger trains, when everything must needs\r\nbe run faster, and a much larger proportion of the gross receipts is\r\nabsorbed by working expenses.\"\r\n\r\nIn advocating these views, Mr. Stephenson was considerably ahead of his\r\ntime; and although he did not live to see his anticipations fully\r\nrealised as to the supply of the London coal-market, he was nevertheless\r\nthe first to point out, and to some extent to prove, the practicability\r\nof establishing a profitable coal trade by railway between the northern\r\ncounties and the metropolis.  So long, however, as the traffic was\r\nconducted on main passenger lines at comparatively high speeds, it was\r\nfound that the expenditure on tear and wear of road and locomotive\r\npower,--not to mention the increased risk of carrying on the first-class\r\npassenger traffic with which it was mixed up,--necessarily left a very\r\nsmall margin of profit; and hence Mr. Stephenson was in the habit of\r\nurging the propriety of constructing a railway which should be\r\nexclusively devoted to goods and mineral traffic run at low speeds as the\r\nonly condition on which a large railway traffic of that sort could be\r\nprofitably conducted.\r\n\r\nHaving induced some of his Liverpool friends to join him in a coal-mining\r\nadventure at Chesterfield, a lease was taken of the Claycross estate,\r\nthen for sale, and operations were shortly after begun.  At a subsequent\r\nperiod Mr. Stephenson extended his coal-mining operations in the same\r\nneighbourhood; and in 1841 he himself entered into a contract with owners\r\nof land in adjoining townships for the working of the coal thereunder;\r\nand pits were opened on the Tapton estate on an extensive scale.  About\r\nthe same time he erected great lime-works, close to the Ambergate station\r\nof the Midland Railway, from which, when in full operation he was able to\r\nturn out upwards of 200 tons a day.  The limestone was brought on a\r\ntramway from the village of Crich, 2 or 3 miles distant, the coal being\r\nsupplied from his adjoining Claycross colliery.  The works were on a\r\nscale such as had not before been attempted by any private individual\r\nengaged in a similar trade; and we believe they proved very successful.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Lime Works at Ambergate]\r\n\r\nTapton House was included in the lease of one of the collieries, and as\r\nit was conveniently situated--being, as it were, a central point on the\r\nMidland Railway, from which he could readily proceed north or south, on\r\nhis journeys of inspection of the various lines then under construction\r\nin the midland and northern counties,--he took up his residence there,\r\nand it continued his home until the close of his life.\r\n\r\nTapton House is a large roomy brick mansion, beautifully situated amidst\r\nwoods, upon a commanding eminence, about a mile to the north-east of the\r\ntown of Chesterfield.  Green fields dotted with fine trees slope away\r\nfrom the house in all directions.  The surrounding country is undulating\r\nand highly picturesque.  North and south the eye ranges over a vast\r\nextent of lovely scenery; and on the west, looking over the town of\r\nChesterfield, with its church and crooked spire, the extensive range of\r\nthe Derbyshire hills bounds the distance.  The Midland Railway skirts the\r\nwestern edge of the park in a deep rock cutting, and the shrill whistle\r\nof the locomotive sounds near at hand as the trains speed past.  The\r\ngardens and pleasure-grounds adjoining the house were in a very neglected\r\nstate when Mr. Stephenson first went to Tapton; and he promised himself,\r\nwhen he had secured rest and leisure from business, that he would put a\r\nnew face upon both.  The first improvement he made was cutting a woodland\r\nfootpath up the hill-side, by which he at the same time added a beautiful\r\nfeature to the park, and secured a shorter road to the Chesterfield\r\nstation.  But it was some years before he found time to carry into effect\r\nhis contemplated improvements in the adjoining gardens and\r\npleasure-grounds.  He had so long been accustomed to laborious pursuits,\r\nand felt himself still so full of work, that he could not at once settle\r\ndown into the habit of quietly enjoying the fruits of his industry.\r\n\r\nHe had no difficulty in usefully employing his time.  Besides directing\r\nthe mining operations at Claycross, the establishment of the lime-kilns\r\nat Ambergate, and the construction of the extensive railways still in\r\nprogress, he occasionally paid visits to Newcastle, where his locomotive\r\nmanufactory was now in full work, and the proprietors were reaping the\r\nadvantages of his early foresight in an abundant measure of prosperity.\r\nOne of his most interesting visits to the place was in 1838, on the\r\noccasion of the meeting of the British Association there, when he acted\r\nas one of the Vice-Presidents in the section of Mechanical Science.\r\nExtraordinary changes had occurred in his own fortunes, as well as in the\r\nface of the country, since he had first appeared before a scientific body\r\nin Newcastle--the members of the Literary and Philosophical Institute--to\r\nsubmit his safety-lamp for their examination.  Twenty-three years had\r\npassed over his head, full of honest work, of manful struggle; and the\r\nhumble \"colliery engine-wright of the name of Stephenson\" had achieved an\r\nalmost worldwide reputation as a public benefactor.  His fellow-townsmen,\r\ntherefore, could not hesitate to recognise his merits and do honour to\r\nhis name.  During the sittings of the Association, Mr. Stephenson took\r\nthe opportunity of paying a visit to Killingworth, accompanied by some of\r\nthe distinguished _savans_ whom he numbered amongst his friends.  He\r\nthere pointed out to them, with a degree of honest pride, the cottage in\r\nwhich he had lived for so many years, showed what parts of it had been\r\nhis own handiwork, and told them the story of the sun-dial over the door,\r\ndescribing the study and the labour it had cost him and his son to\r\ncalculate its dimensions, and fix it in its place.  The dial had been\r\nserenely numbering the hours through the busy years that had elapsed\r\nsince that humble dwelling had been his home; during which the\r\nKillingworth locomotive had become a great working power, and its\r\ncontriver had established the railway system, which was now rapidly\r\nbecoming extended in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, his services were very much in request at the\r\nmeetings of Mechanics' Institutes held throughout the northern counties.\r\nFrom an early period in his history, he had taken an active interest in\r\nthese institutions.  While residing at Newcastle in 1824, shortly after\r\nhis locomotive foundry had been started in Forth-street, he presided at a\r\npublic meeting held in that town for the purpose of establishing a\r\nMechanics' Institute.  The meeting was held; but as George Stephenson was\r\na man comparatively unknown even in Newcastle at that time, his name\r\nfailed to secure \"an influential attendance.\"  Among those who addressed\r\nthe meeting on the occasion was Joseph Locke, then his pupil, and\r\nafterwards his rival as an engineer.  The local papers scarcely noticed\r\nthe proceedings; yet the Mechanics' Institute was founded, and struggled\r\ninto existence.  Years passed, and it was now felt to be an honour to\r\nsecure Mr. Stephenson's presence at any public meetings held for the\r\npromotion of popular education.  Among the Mechanics' Institutes in his\r\nimmediate neighbourhood at Tapton, were those of Belper and Chesterfield;\r\nand at their soirees he was a frequent and a welcome visitor.  On these\r\noccasions he loved to tell his auditors of the difficulties which had\r\nearly beset him through want of knowledge, and of the means by which he\r\nhad overcome them.  His grand text was--PERSEVERE; and there was manhood\r\nin the very word.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion, the author had the pleasure of listening to\r\nGeorge Stephenson's homely but forcible addresses at the annual soirees\r\nof the Leeds Mechanics' Institute.  He was always an immense favourite\r\nwith his audiences there.  His personal appearance was greatly in his\r\nfavour.  A handsome, ruddy, expressive face, lit up by bright dark-blue\r\neyes, prepared one for his earnest words when he stood up to speak and\r\nthe cheers had subsided which invariably hailed his rising.  He was not\r\nglib, but he was very impressive.  And who, so well as he, could serve as\r\na guide to the working man in his endeavours after higher knowledge?  His\r\nearly life had been all struggle--encounter with difficulty--groping in\r\nthe dark after greater light, but always earnestly and perseveringly.\r\nHis words were therefore all the more weighty, since he spoke from the\r\nfulness of his own experience.\r\n\r\nNor did he remain a mere inactive spectator of the improvements in\r\nrailway working which increasing experience from day to day suggested.\r\nHe continued to contrive improvements in the locomotive, and to mature\r\nhis invention of the carriage-brake.  When examined before the Select\r\nCommittee on Railways in 1841, his mind seems principally to have been\r\nimpressed with the necessity which existed for adopting a system of self\r\nacting brakes; stating that, in his opinion, this was the most important\r\narrangement that could be provided for increasing the safety of railway\r\ntravelling.  \"I believe,\" he said, \"that if self-acting brakes were put\r\nupon every carriage, scarcely any accident could take place.\"  His plan\r\nconsisted in employing the momentum of the running train to throw his\r\nproposed brakes into action, immediately on the moving power of the\r\nengine being checked.  He would also have these brakes under the control\r\nof the guard, by means of a connecting line running along the whole\r\nlength of the train, by which they should at once be thrown out of gear\r\nwhen necessary.  At the same time he suggested, as an additional means of\r\nsafety, that the signals of the line should be self-acting, and worked by\r\nthe locomotives as they passed along the railway.  He considered the\r\nadoption of this plan of so much importance, that, with a view to the\r\npublic safety, he would even have it enforced upon railway companies by\r\nthe legislature.  At the same time he was of opinion that it was the\r\ninterest of the companies themselves to adopt the plan, as it would save\r\ngreat tear and wear of engines, carriages, tenders, and brake-vans,\r\nbesides greatly diminishing the risk of accidents upon railways.\r\n\r\nWhile before the same Committee, he took the opportunity of stating his\r\nviews with reference to railway speed, about which wild ideas were then\r\nafloat--one gentleman of celebrity having publicly expressed the opinion\r\nthat a speed of 100 miles an hour was practicable in railway travelling!\r\nNot many years had passed since George Stephenson had been pronounced\r\ninsane for stating his conviction that 12 miles an hour could be\r\nperformed by the locomotive; but now that he had established the fact,\r\nand greatly exceeded that speed, he was thought behind the age because he\r\nrecommended the rate to be limited to 40 miles an hour.  He said: \"I do\r\nnot like either 40 or 50 miles an hour upon any line--I think it is an\r\nunnecessary speed; and if there is danger upon a railway, it is high\r\nvelocity that creates it.  I should say no railway ought to exceed 40\r\nmiles an hour on the most favourable gradient; but upon a curved line the\r\nspeed ought not to exceed 24 or 25 miles an hour.\"  He had, indeed,\r\nconstructed for the Great Western Railway an engine capable of running 50\r\nmiles an hour with a load, and 80 miles without one.  But he never was in\r\nfavour of a hurricane speed of this sort, believing it could only be\r\naccomplished at an unnecessary increase both of danger and expense.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" he observed on other occasions, \"I have said the locomotive\r\nengine _might_ be made to travel 100 miles an hour; but I always put a\r\nqualification on this, namely, as to what speed would best suit the\r\npublic.  The public may, however, be unreasonable; and 50 or 60 miles an\r\nhour is an unreasonable speed.  Long before railway travelling became\r\ngeneral, I said to my friends that there was no limit to the speed of the\r\nlocomotive, _provided the works could be made to stand_.  But there are\r\nlimits to the strength of iron, whether it be manufactured into rails or\r\nlocomotives; and there is a point at which both rails and tyres must\r\nbreak.  Every increase of speed, by increasing the strain upon the road\r\nand the rolling stock, brings us nearer to that point.  At 30 miles a\r\nslighter road will do, and less perfect rolling stock may be run upon it\r\nwith safety.  But if you increase the speed by say 10 miles, then\r\neverything must be greatly strengthened.  You must have heavier engines,\r\nheavier and better-fastened rails, and all your working expenses will be\r\nimmediately increased.  I think I know enough of mechanics to know where\r\nto stop.  I know that a pound will weigh a pound, and that no more should\r\nbe put upon an iron rail than it will bear.  If you could ensure perfect\r\niron, perfect rails, and perfect locomotives, I grant 50 miles an hour or\r\nmore might be run with safety on a level railway.  But then you must not\r\nforget that iron, even the best, will 'tire,' and with constant use will\r\nbecome more and more liable to break at the weakest point--perhaps where\r\nthere is a secret flaw that the eye cannot detect.  Then look at the\r\nrubbishy rails now manufactured on the contract system--some of them\r\nlittle better than cast metal: indeed, I have seen rails break merely on\r\nbeing thrown from the truck on to the ground.  How is it possible for\r\nsuch rails to stand a 20 or 30 ton engine dashing over them at the speed\r\nof 50 miles an hour?  No, no,\" he would conclude, \"I am in favour of low\r\nspeeds because they are safe, and because they are economical; and you\r\nmay rely upon it that, beyond a certain point, with every increase of\r\nspeed there is an increase in the element of danger.\"\r\n\r\nWhen railways became the subject of popular discussion, many new and\r\nunsound theories were started with reference to them, which Stephenson\r\nopposed as calculated, in his opinion, to bring discredit on the\r\nlocomotive system.  One of these was with reference to what were called\r\n\"undulating lines.\"  Among others, Dr. Lardner, who had originally been\r\nsomewhat sceptical about the powers of the locomotive, now promulgated\r\nthe idea that a railway constructed with rising and falling gradients\r\nwould be practically as easy to work as a line perfectly level.  Mr.\r\nBadnell went even beyond him, for he held that an undulating railway was\r\nmuch better than a level one for purposes of working.  For a time, this\r\ntheory found favour, and the \"undulating system\" was extensively adopted;\r\nbut Mr. Stephenson never ceased to inveigh against it; and experience has\r\namply proved that his judgment was correct.  His practice, from the\r\nbeginning of his career until the end of it, was to secure a road as\r\nnearly as possible on a level, following the course of the valleys and\r\nthe natural line of the country: preferring to go round a hill rather\r\nthan to tunnel under it or carry his railway over it, and often making a\r\nconsiderable circuit to secure good, workable gradients.  He studied to\r\nlay out his lines so that long trains of minerals and merchandise, as\r\nwell as passengers, might be hauled along them at the least possible\r\nexpenditure of locomotive power.  He had long before ascertained, by\r\ncareful experiments at Killingworth, that the engine expends half of its\r\npower in overcoming a rising gradient of 1 in 260, which is about 20 feet\r\nin the mile; and that when the gradient is so steep as 1 in 100, not less\r\nthan three-fourths of its power is sacrificed in ascending the acclivity.\r\nHe never forgot the valuable practical lesson taught him by the early\r\ntrials which he had made and registered long before the advantages of\r\nrailways had been recognised.  He saw clearly that the longer flat line\r\nmust eventually prove superior to the shorter line of steep gradients as\r\nrespected its paying qualities.  He urged that, after all, the power of\r\nthe locomotive was but limited; and, although he and his son had done\r\nmore than any other men to increase its working capacity, it provoked him\r\nto find that every improvement made in it was neutralised by the steep\r\ngradients which the new school of engineers were setting it to overcome.\r\nOn one occasion, when Robert Stephenson stated before a Parliamentary\r\nCommittee that every successive improvement in the locomotive was being\r\nrendered virtually nugatory by the difficult and almost impracticable\r\ngradients proposed on many of the new lines, his father, on his leaving\r\nthe witness-box, went up to him, and said, \"Robert, you never spoke truer\r\nwords than those in all your life.\"\r\n\r\nTo this it must be added, that in urging these views Mr. Stephenson was\r\nstrongly influenced by commercial considerations.  He had no desire to\r\nbuild up his reputation at the expense of railway shareholders, nor to\r\nobtain engineering _eclat_ by making \"ducks and drakes\" of their money.\r\nHe was persuaded that, in order to secure the practical success of\r\nrailways, they must be so laid out as not only to prove of decided public\r\nutility, but also to be worked economically and to the advantage of their\r\nproprietors.  They were not government roads, but private ventures--in\r\nfact, commercial speculations.  He therefore endeavoured to render them\r\nfinancially profitable; and he repeatedly declared that if he did not\r\nbelieve they could be \"made to pay,\" he would have nothing to do with\r\nthem.  He was not influenced by the sordid consideration of what he could\r\n_make_ out of any company that employed him; indeed, in many cases he\r\nvoluntarily gave up his claim to remuneration where the promoters of\r\nschemes which he thought praiseworthy had suffered serious loss.  Thus,\r\nwhen the first application was made to Parliament for the Chester and\r\nBirkenhead Railway Bill, the promoters were defeated.  They repeated\r\ntheir application, on the understanding that in event of their\r\nsucceeding, the engineer and surveyor were to be paid their costs in\r\nrespect of the defeated measure.  The Bill was successful, and to several\r\nparties their costs were paid.  Mr. Stephenson's amounted to 800 pounds,\r\nand he very nobly said, \"You have had an expensive career in Parliament;\r\nyou have had a great struggle; you are a young Company; you cannot afford\r\nto pay me this amount of money.  I will reduce it to 200 pounds, and I\r\nwill not ask you for that 200 pounds until your shares are at 20 pounds\r\npremium: for whatever may be the reverses you will go through, I am\r\nsatisfied I shall live to see the day when your shares will be at 20\r\npounds premium, and when I can legally and honourably claim that 200\r\npounds.\"  We may add that the shares did eventually rise to the premium\r\nspecified, and the engineer was no loser by his generous conduct in the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nAnother novelty of the time, with which George Stephenson had to contend,\r\nwas the substitution of atmospheric pressure for locomotive steam-power\r\nin the working of railways.  The idea of obtaining motion by means of\r\natmospheric pressure is said to have originated with Denis Papin, more\r\nthan 150 years ago; but it slept until revived in 1810 by Mr. Medhurst,\r\nwho published a pamphlet to prove the practicability of carrying letters\r\nand goods by air.  In 1824, Mr. Vallance of Brighton took out a patent\r\nfor projecting passengers through a tube large enough to contain a train\r\nof carriages; the tube being previously exhausted of its atmospheric air.\r\nThe same idea was afterwards taken up, in 1835, by Mr. Pinkus, an\r\ningenious American.  Scientific gentlemen, Dr. Lardner and Mr. Clegg\r\namongst others, advocated the plan; and an association was formed to\r\ncarry it into effect.  Shares were created, and 18,000 pounds raised: and\r\na model apparatus was exhibited in London.  Mr. Vignolles took his friend\r\nStephenson to see the model; and after carefully examining it, he\r\nobserved emphatically, \"_It won't do_: it is only the fixed engines and\r\nropes over again, in another form; and, to tell you the truth, I don't\r\nthink this rope of wind will answer so well as the rope of wire did.\"  He\r\ndid not think the principle would stand the test of practice, and he\r\nobjected to the mode of applying the principle.  After all, it was only a\r\nmodification of the stationary-engine plan; and every day's experience\r\nwas proving that fixed engines could not compete with locomotives in\r\npoint of efficiency and economy.  He stood by the locomotive engine; and\r\nsubsequent experience proved that he was right.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Clegg and Samuda afterwards, in 1840, patented their plan of an\r\natmospheric railway; and they publicly tested its working on an\r\nunfinished portion of the West London Railway.  The results of the\r\nexperiment were so satisfactory, that the directors of the Dublin and\r\nKingstown line adopted it between Kingstown and Dalkey.  The London and\r\nCroydon Company also adopted the atmospheric principle; and their line\r\nwas opened in 1845.  The ordinary mode of applying the power was to lay\r\nbetween the line of rails a pipe, in which a large piston was inserted,\r\nand attached by a shaft to the framework of a carriage.  The propelling\r\npower was the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere acting against the\r\npiston in the tube on one side, a vacuum being created in the tube on the\r\nother side of the piston by the working of a stationary engine.  Great\r\nwas the popularity of the atmospheric system; and still George Stephenson\r\nsaid \"It won't do: it's but a gimcrack.\"  Engineers of distinction said\r\nhe was prejudiced, and that he looked upon the locomotive as a pet child\r\nof his own.  \"Wait a little,\" he replied, \"and you will see that I am\r\nright.\"  It was generally supposed that the locomotive system was about\r\nto be snuffed out.  \"Not so fast,\" said Stephenson.  \"Let us wait to see\r\nif it will pay.\"  He never believed it would.  It was ingenious, clever,\r\nscientific, and all that; but railways were commercial enterprises, not\r\ntoys; and if the atmospheric railway could not work to a profit, it would\r\nnot do.  Considered in this light, he even went so far as to call it \"a\r\ngreat humbug.\"  \"Nothing will beat the locomotive,\" said he, \"for\r\nefficiency in all weathers, for economy in drawing loads of average\r\nweight, and for power and speed as occasion may require.\"\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric system was fairly and fully tried, and it was found\r\nwanting.  It was admitted to be an exceedingly elegant mode of applying\r\npower; its devices were very skilful, and its mechanism was most\r\ningenious.  But it was costly, irregular in action, and, in particular\r\nkinds of weather, not to be depended upon.  At best, it was but a\r\nmodification of the stationary-engine system, and experience proved it to\r\nbe so expensive that it was shortly after entirely abandoned in favour of\r\nlocomotive power. {288}\r\n\r\nOne of the remarkable results of the system of railway locomotion which\r\nGeorge Stephenson had by his persevering labours mainly contributed to\r\nestablish, was the outbreak of the railway mania towards the close of his\r\nprofessional career.  The success of the first main lines of railway\r\nnaturally led to their extension into many new districts; but a strongly\r\nspeculative tendency soon began to display itself, which contained in it\r\nthe elements of great danger.\r\n\r\nThe extension of railways had, up to the year 1844, been mainly effected\r\nby men of the commercial classes, and the shareholders in them\r\nprincipally belonged to the manufacturing districts,--the capitalists of\r\nthe metropolis as yet holding aloof, and prophesying disaster to all\r\nconcerned in railway projects.  But when the lugubrious anticipations of\r\nthe City men were found to be so entirely falsified by the results--when,\r\nafter the lapse of years, it was ascertained that railway traffic rapidly\r\nincreased and dividends steadily improved--a change came over the spirit\r\nof the London capitalists.  They then invested largely in railways, the\r\nshares in which became a leading branch of business on the Stock\r\nExchange, and the prices of some rose to nearly double their original\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nA stimulus was thus given to the projection of further lines, the shares\r\nin most of which came out at a premium, and became the subject of\r\nimmediate traffic.  A reckless spirit of gambling set in, which\r\ncompletely changed the character and objects of railway enterprise.  The\r\npublic outside the Stock Exchange became also infected, and many persons\r\nutterly ignorant of railways, knowing and caring nothing about their\r\nnational uses, but hungering and thirsting after premiums, rushed eagerly\r\ninto the vortex.  They applied for allotments, and subscribed for shares\r\nin lines, of the engineering character or probable traffic of which they\r\nknew nothing.  Provided they could but obtain allotments which they could\r\nsell at a premium, and put the profit--in many cases the only capital\r\nthey possessed {289}--into their pocket, it was enough for them.  The\r\nmania was not confined to the precincts of the Stock Exchange, but\r\ninfected all ranks.  It embraced merchants and manufacturers, gentry and\r\nshopkeepers, clerks in public offices, and loungers at the clubs.  Noble\r\nlords were pointed at as \"stags;\" there were even clergymen who were\r\ncharacterised as \"bulls;\" and amiable ladies who had the reputation of\r\n\"bears,\" in the share markets.  The few quiet men who remained\r\nuninfluenced by the speculation of the time were, in not a few cases,\r\neven reproached for doing injustice to their families, in declining to\r\nhelp themselves from the stores of wealth that were poured out on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nFolly and knavery were, for a time, completely in the ascendant.  The\r\nsharpers of society were let loose, and jobbers and schemers became more\r\nand more plentiful.  They threw out railway schemes as lures to catch the\r\nunwary.  They fed the mania with a constant succession of new projects.\r\nThe railway papers became loaded with their advertisements.  The\r\npost-office was scarcely able to distribute the multitude of prospectuses\r\nand circulars which they issued.  For a time their popularity was\r\nimmense.  They rose like froth into the upper heights of society, and the\r\nflunkey FitzPlushe, by virtue of his supposed wealth, sat amongst peers\r\nand was idolised.  Then was the harvest-time of scheming lawyers,\r\nparliamentary agents, engineers, surveyors, and traffic-takers, who were\r\nready to take up any railway scheme however desperate, and to prove any\r\namount of traffic even where none existed.  The traffic in the credulity\r\nof their dupes was, however, the great fact that mainly concerned them,\r\nand of the profitable character of which there could be no doubt.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson was anxiously entreated to lend his name to prospectuses\r\nduring the railway mania; but he invariably refused.  He held aloof from\r\nthe headlong folly of the hour, and endeavoured to check it, but in vain.\r\nHad he been less scrupulous, and given his countenance to the numerous\r\nprojects about which he was consulted, he might, without any trouble,\r\nhave thus secured enormous gains; but he had no desire to accumulate a\r\nfortune without labour and without honour.  He himself never speculated\r\nin shares.  When he was satisfied as to the merits of any undertaking, he\r\nsubscribed for a certain amount of capital in it, and held on, neither\r\nbuying nor selling.  At a dinner of the Leeds and Bradford directors at\r\nBen Rydding in October, 1844, before the mania had reached its height, he\r\nwarned those present against the prevalent disposition towards railway\r\nspeculation.  It was, he said, like walking upon a piece of ice with\r\nshallows and deeps; the shallows were frozen over, and they would carry,\r\nbut it required great caution to get over the deeps.  He was satisfied\r\nthat in the course of the next year many would step on to places not\r\nstrong enough to carry them, and would get into the deeps; they would be\r\ntaking shares, and afterwards be unable to pay the calls upon them.\r\nYorkshiremen were reckoned clever men, and his advice to them was, to\r\nstick together and promote communication in their own neighbourhood,--not\r\nto go abroad with their speculations.  If any had done so, he advised\r\nthem to get their money back as fast as they could, for if they did not\r\nthey would not get it at all.  He informed the company, at the same time,\r\nof his earliest holding of railway shares; it was in the Stockton and\r\nDarlington Railway, and the number he held was _three_--\"a very large\r\ncapital for him to possess at the time.\"  But a Stockton friend was\r\nanxious to possess a share, and he sold him _one_ at a premium of 33s.;\r\nhe supposed he had been about the first man in England to sell a railway\r\nshare at a premium.\r\n\r\nDuring 1845, his son's offices in Great George-street, Westminster, were\r\ncrowded with persons of various conditions seeking interviews, presenting\r\nvery much the appearance of the levee of a minister of state.  The burly\r\nfigure of Mr. Hudson, the \"Railway King,\" surrounded by an admiring group\r\nof followers, was often to be seen there; and a still more interesting\r\nperson, in the estimation of many, was George Stephenson, dressed in\r\nblack, his coat of somewhat old-fashioned cut, with square pockets in the\r\ntails.  He wore a white neckcloth, and a large bunch of seals was\r\nsuspended from his watch-ribbon.  Altogether, he presented an appearance\r\nof health, intelligence, and good humour, that rejoiced one to look upon\r\nin that sordid, selfish and eventually ruinous saturnalia of railway\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nPowers were granted by Parliament, in 1843, to construct not less than\r\n2883 miles of new railways in Britain, at an expenditure of about\r\nforty-four millions sterling!  Yet the mania was not appeased; for in the\r\nfollowing session of 1846, applications were made to Parliament for\r\npowers to raise 389,000,000 pounds sterling for the construction of\r\nfurther lines; and powers were actually conceded for forming 4790 miles\r\n(including 60 miles of tunnels), at a cost of about 120,000,000 pounds\r\nsterling.  During this session, Mr. Stephenson appeared as engineer for\r\nonly one new line,--the Buxton, Macclesfield, Congleton, and Crewe\r\nRailway--a line in which, as a coal-owner, he was personally\r\ninterested;--and of three branch-lines in connexion with existing\r\ncompanies for which he had long acted as engineer.  At the same time, all\r\nthe leading professional men were fully occupied, some of them appearing\r\nas consulting engineers for upwards of thirty lines each!\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the mania was the rage for \"direct lines\" which\r\neverywhere displayed itself.  There were \"Direct Manchester,\" \"Direct\r\nExeter,\" \"Direct York,\" and, indeed, new direct lines between most of the\r\nlarge towns.  The Marquis of Bristol, speaking in favour of the \"Direct\r\nNorwich and London\" project, at a public meeting at Haverhill, said, \"If\r\nnecessary, they might _make a tunnel beneath his very drawing-room_,\r\nrather than be defeated in their undertaking!\"  And the Rev. F.\r\nLitchfield, at a meeting in Banbury, on the subject of a line to that\r\ntown, said \"He had laid down for himself a limit to his approbation of\r\nrailways,--at least of such as approached the neighbourhood with which he\r\nwas connected,--and that limit was, that he did not wish them to approach\r\nany nearer to him than _to run through his bedroom_, _with the bedposts\r\nfor a station_!\"  How different was the spirit which influenced these\r\nnoble lords and gentlemen but a few years before!\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons became thoroughly influenced by the prevailing\r\nexcitement.  Even the Board of Trade began to favour the views of the\r\nfast school of engineers.  In their \"Report on the Lines projected in the\r\nManchester and Leeds District,\" they promulgated some remarkable views\r\nrespecting gradients, declaring themselves in favour of the \"undulating\r\nsystem.\"  They there stated that lines of an undulating character \"which\r\nhave gradients of 1 in 70 or in 80 distributed over them in short\r\nlengths, may be positively _better_ lines, _i.e._, _more susceptible of\r\ncheap and expeditious working_, than others which have nothing steeper\r\nthan 1 in 100 or 1 in 120!\"  They concluded by reporting in favour of the\r\nline which exhibited the worst gradients and the sharpest curves, chiefly\r\non the ground that it could be constructed for less money.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel took occasion to advert to this Report in the House of\r\nCommons on the 4th of March following, as containing \"a novel and highly\r\nimportant view on the subject of gradients, which, he was certain, never\r\ncould have been taken by any Committee of the House of Commons, however\r\nintelligent;\" and he might have added, that the more intelligent, the\r\nless likely they were to arrive at any such conclusion.  When Mr.\r\nStephenson saw this report of the Premier's speech in the newspapers of\r\nthe following morning, he went forthwith to his son, and asked him to\r\nwrite a letter to Sir Robert Peel on the subject.  He saw clearly that if\r\nthese views were adopted, the utility and economy of railways would be\r\nseriously curtailed.  \"These members of Parliament,\" said he, \"are now as\r\nmuch disposed to exaggerate the powers of the locomotive, as they were to\r\nunder-estimate them but a few years ago.\"  Robert accordingly wrote a\r\nletter for his father's signature, embodying the views which he so\r\nstrongly entertained as to the importance of flat gradients, and\r\nreferring to the experiments conducted by him many years before, in proof\r\nof the great loss of working power which was incurred on a line of steep\r\nas compared with easy gradients.  It was clear, from the tone of Sir\r\nRobert Peel's speech in a subsequent debate, that he had carefully read\r\nand considered Mr. Stephenson's practical observations on the subject;\r\nthough it did not appear that he had come to any definite conclusion\r\nthereon, further than that he strongly approved of the Trent Valley\r\nRailway, by which Tamworth would be placed upon a direct main line of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThe result of the labours of Parliament was a tissue of legislative\r\nbungling, involving enormous loss to the public.  Railway Bills were\r\ngranted in heaps.  Two hundred and seventy-two additional Acts were\r\npassed in 1846.  Some authorised the construction of lines running almost\r\nparallel to existing railways, in order to afford the public \"the\r\nbenefits of unrestricted competition.\"  Locomotive and atmospheric lines,\r\nbroad-gauge and narrow-gauge lines, were granted without hesitation.\r\nCommittees decided without judgment and without discrimination; it was a\r\nscramble for Bills, in which the most unscrupulous were the most\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many ill effects of the mania, one of the worst was that it\r\nintroduced a low tone of morality into railway transactions.  The bad\r\nspirit which had been evoked by it unhappily extended to the commercial\r\nclasses, and many of the most flagrant swindles of recent times had their\r\norigin in the year 1845.  Those who had suddenly gained large sums\r\nwithout labour, and also without honour, were too ready to enter upon\r\ncourses of the wildest extravagance; and a false style of living shortly\r\narose, the poisonous influence of which extended through all classes.\r\nMen began to look upon railways as instruments to job with.  Persons,\r\nsometimes possessing information respecting railways, but more frequently\r\npossessing none, got upon boards for the purpose of promoting their\r\nindividual objects, often in a very unscrupulous manner; landowners, to\r\npromote branch lines through their property; speculators in shares, to\r\ntrade upon the exclusive information which they obtained; whilst some\r\ndirectors were appointed through the influence mainly of solicitors,\r\ncontractors, or engineers, who used them as tools to serve their own\r\nends.  In this way the unfortunate proprietors were, in many cases,\r\nbetrayed, and their property was shamefully squandered, much to the\r\ndiscredit of the railway system.\r\n\r\nWhile the mania was at its height in England, railways were also being\r\nextended abroad, and George Stephenson was requested on several occasions\r\nto give the benefit of his advice to the directors of foreign\r\nundertakings.  One of the most agreeable of these excursions was to\r\nBelgium in 1845.  His special object was to examine the proposed line of\r\nthe Sambre and Meuse Railway, for which a concession had been granted by\r\nthe Belgian legislature.  Arrived on the ground, he went carefully over\r\nthe entire length of the proposed line, to Convins, the Forest of\r\nArdennes, and Rocroi, across the French frontier; examining the bearings\r\nof the coal-field, the slate and marble quarries, and the numerous\r\niron-mines in existence between the Sambre and the Meuse, as well as\r\ncarefully exploring the ravines which extended through the district, in\r\norder to satisfy himself that the best possible route had been selected.\r\nMr. Stephenson was delighted with the novelty of the journey, the beauty\r\nof the scenery, and the industry of the population.  His companions were\r\nentertained by his ample and varied stores of practical information on\r\nall subjects, and his conversation was full of reminiscences of his\r\nyouth, on which he always delighted to dwell when in the society of his\r\nmore intimate friends.  The journey was varied by a visit to the\r\ncoal-mines near Jemappe, where Stephenson examined with interest the mode\r\nadopted by the Belgian miners of draining the pits, inspecting their\r\nengines and brakeing machines, so familiar to him in early life.\r\n\r\nThe engineers of Belgium took the opportunity of Mr. Stephenson's visit\r\nto their country to invite him to a magnificent banquet at Brussels.  The\r\nPublic Hall, in which they entertained him, was gaily decorated with\r\nflags, prominent amongst which was the Union Jack, in honour of their\r\ndistinguished guest.  A handsome marble pedestal, ornamented with his\r\nbust crowned with laurels, occupied one end of the room.  The chair was\r\noccupied by M. Massui, the Chief Director of the National Railways of\r\nBelgium; and the most eminent scientific men of the kingdom were present.\r\nTheir reception of \"the Father of railways\" was of the most enthusiastic\r\ndescription.  Mr. Stephenson was greatly pleased with the entertainment.\r\nNot the least interesting incident of the evening was his observing, when\r\nthe dinner was about half over, a model of a locomotive engine placed\r\nupon the centre table, under a triumphal arch.  Turning suddenly to his\r\nfriend Sopwith, he exclaimed, \"Do you see the 'Rocket'?\"  The compliment\r\nthus paid him, was perhaps more prized than all the encomiums of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe next day (April 5th) King Leopold invited him to a private interview\r\nat the palace.  Accompanied by Mr. Sopwith, he proceeded to Laaken, and\r\nwas very cordially received by His Majesty.  The king immediately entered\r\ninto familiar conversation with him, discussing the railway project which\r\nhad been the object of his visit to Belgium, and then the structure of\r\nthe Belgian coal-fields,--his Majesty expressing his sense of the great\r\nimportance of economy in a fuel which had become indispensable to the\r\ncomfort and well-being of society, which was the basis of all\r\nmanufactures, and the vital power of railway locomotion.  The subject was\r\nalways a favourite one with Mr. Stephenson, and, encouraged by the king,\r\nhe proceeded to describe to him the geological structure of Belgium, the\r\noriginal formation of coal, its subsequent elevation by volcanic forces,\r\nand the vast amount of denudation.  In describing the coal-beds he used\r\nhis hat as a sort of model to illustrate his meaning; and the eyes of the\r\nking were fixed upon it as he proceeded with his interesting description.\r\nThe conversation then passed to the rise and progress of trade and\r\nmanufactures,--Mr. Stephenson pointing out how closely they everywhere\r\nfollowed the coal, being mainly dependent upon it, as it were, for their\r\nvery existence.\r\n\r\nThe king seemed greatly pleased with the interview, and at its close\r\nexpressed himself obliged by the interesting information which the\r\nengineer had communicated.  Shaking hands cordially with both the\r\ngentlemen, and wishing them success in their important undertakings, he\r\nbade them adieu.  As they were leaving the palace Mr. Stephenson,\r\nbethinking him of the model by which he had just been illustrating the\r\nBelgian coal-fields, said to his friend, \"By the bye, Sopwith, I was\r\nafraid the king would see the inside of my hat; it's a shocking bad one!\"\r\nLittle could George Stephenson, when brakesman at a coal-pit, have dreamt\r\nthat, in the course of his life, he should be admitted to an interview\r\nwith a monarch, and describe to him the manner in which the geological\r\nfoundations of his kingdom had been laid!\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson paid a second visit to Belgium in the course of the same\r\nyear, on the business of the West Flanders Railway; and he had scarcely\r\nreturned from it ere he made arrangements to proceed to Spain, for the\r\npurpose of examining and reporting upon a scheme then on foot for\r\nconstructing \"the Royal North of Spain Railway.\"  A concession had been\r\nmade by the Spanish Government of a line of railway from Madrid to the\r\nBay of Biscay, and a numerous staff of engineers was engaged in surveying\r\nit.  The directors of the Company had declined making the necessary\r\ndeposits until more favourable terms had been secured; and Sir Joshua\r\nWalmsley, on their part, was about to visit Spain and press the\r\nGovernment on the subject.  Mr. Stephenson, whom he consulted, was alive\r\nto the difficulties of the office which Sir Joshua was induced to\r\nundertake, and offered to be his companion and adviser on the\r\noccasion,--declining to receive any recompense beyond the simple expenses\r\nof the journey.  He could only arrange to be absent for six weeks, and\r\nset out from England about the middle of September, 1845.\r\n\r\nThe party was joined at Paris by Mr. Mackenzie, the contractor for the\r\nOrleans and Tours Railway, then in course of construction, who took them\r\nover the works, and accompanied them as far as Tours.  They soon reached\r\nthe great chain of the Pyrenees, and crossed over into Spain.  It was on\r\na Sunday evening, after a long day's toilsome journey through the\r\nmountains, that the party suddenly found themselves in one of those\r\nbeautiful secluded valleys lying amidst the Western Pyrenees.  A small\r\nhamlet lay before them, consisting of some thirty or forty houses and a\r\nfine old church.  The sun was low on the horizon, and, under the wide\r\nporch, beneath the shadow of the church, were seated nearly all the\r\ninhabitants of the place.  They were dressed in their holiday attire.\r\nThe bright bits of red and amber colour in the dresses of the women, and\r\nthe gay sashes of the men, formed a striking picture, on which the\r\ntravellers gazed in silent admiration.  It was something entirely novel\r\nand unexpected.  Beside the villagers sat two venerable old men, whose\r\ncanonical hats indicated their quality as village pastors.  Two groups of\r\nyoung women and children were dancing outside the porch to the\r\naccompaniment of a simple pipe; and within a hundred yards of them, some\r\nof the youths of the village were disporting themselves in athletic\r\nexercises; the whole being carried on beneath the fostering care of the\r\nold church, and with the sanction of its ministers.  It was a beautiful\r\nscene, and deeply moved the travellers as they approached the principal\r\ngroup.  The villagers greeted them courteously, supplied their present\r\nwants, and pressed upon them some fine melons, brought from their\r\nadjoining gardens.  Mr. Stephenson used afterwards to look back upon that\r\nsimple scene, and speak of it as one of the most charming pastorals he\r\nhad ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nThey shortly reached the site of the proposed railway, passing through\r\nIrun, St. Sebastian, St. Andero, and Bilbao, at which places they met\r\ndeputations of the principal inhabitants who were interested in the\r\nsubject of their journey.  At Raynosa Stephenson carefully examined the\r\nmountain passes and ravines through which a railway could be made.  He\r\nrose at break of day, and surveyed until the darkness set in; and\r\nfrequently his resting-place at night was the floor of some miserable\r\nhovel.  He was thus laboriously occupied for ten days, after which he\r\nproceeded across the province of Old Castile towards Madrid, surveying as\r\nhe went.  The proposed plan included the purchase of the Castile Canal;\r\nand that property was also surveyed.  He next proceeded to El Escorial,\r\nsituated at the foot of the Guadarama mountains, through which he found\r\nthat it would be necessary to construct two formidable tunnels; added to\r\nwhich he ascertained that the country between El Escorial and Madrid was\r\nof a very difficult and expensive character to work through.  Taking\r\nthese circumstances into account, and looking at the expected traffic on\r\nthe proposed line, Sir Joshua Walmsley, acting under the advice of Mr.\r\nStephenson, offered to construct the line from Madrid to the Bay of\r\nBiscay, only on condition that the requisite land was given the Company\r\nfor the purpose; that they should be allowed every facility for cutting\r\nsuch timber belonging the Crown as might be required for the purposes of\r\nthe railway; and also that the materials required from abroad for the\r\nconstruction of the line should be admitted free of duty.  In return for\r\nthese concessions the Company offered to clothe and feed several\r\nthousands of convicts while engaged in the execution of the earthworks.\r\nGeneral Narvaez, afterwards Duke of Valencia, received Sir Joshua\r\nWalmsley and Mr. Stephenson on the subject of their proposition, and\r\nexpressed his willingness to close with them; but it was necessary that\r\nother influential parties should give their concurrence before the scheme\r\ncould be carried into effect.  The deputation waited ten days to receive\r\nthe answer of the Spanish Government; but no answer of any kind was\r\nvouchsafed.  The authorities, indeed, invited them to be present at a\r\nSpanish bullfight, but that was not quite the business Mr. Stephenson had\r\ngone all the way to Spain to transact; and the offer was politely\r\ndeclined.  The result was, that Mr. Stephenson dissuaded his friend from\r\nmaking the necessary deposit at Madrid.  Besides, he had by this time\r\nformed an unfavourable opinion of the entire project, and considered that\r\nthe traffic would not amount to one-eighth of the estimate.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson was now anxious to be in England.  During the journey from\r\nMadrid he often spoke with affection of friends and relatives; and when\r\napparently absorbed by other matters, he would revert to what he thought\r\nmight then be passing at home.  Few incidents worthy of notice occurred\r\non the journey homeward, but one may be mentioned.  While travelling in\r\nan open conveyance between Madrid and Vittoria, the driver urged his\r\nmules down hill at a dangerous pace.  He was requested to slacken speed;\r\nbut suspecting his passengers to be afraid, he only flogged the brutes\r\ninto a still more furious gallop.  Observing this, Mr. Stephenson coolly\r\nsaid, \"Let us try him on the other tack; tell him to show us the fastest\r\npace at which Spanish mules can go.\"  The rogue of a driver, when he\r\nfound his tricks of no avail, pulled up and proceeded at a more moderate\r\nspeed for the rest of the journey.\r\n\r\nUrgent business required Mr. Stephenson's presence in London on the last\r\nday of November.  They travelled therefore almost continuously, day and\r\nnight; and the fatigue consequent on the journey, added to the privations\r\nvoluntarily endured by the engineer while carrying on the survey among\r\nthe Spanish mountains, began to tell seriously on his health.  By the\r\ntime he reached Paris he was evidently ill, but he nevertheless\r\ndetermined on proceeding.  He reached Havre in time for the Southampton\r\nboat; but when on board, pleurisy developed itself, and it was necessary\r\nto bleed him freely.  During the voyage, he spent his time chiefly in\r\ndictating letters and reports to Sir Joshua Walmsley, who never left him,\r\nand whose kindness on the occasion he gratefully remembered.  His friend\r\nwas struck by the clearness of his dictated composition, which exhibited\r\na vigour and condensation which to him seemed marvellous.  After a few\r\nweeks' rest at home, Mr. Stephenson gradually recovered, though his\r\nhealth remained severely shaken.\r\n\r\n             [Picture: Newcastle, from the High Level Bridge]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nROBERT STEPHENSON'S CAREER--THE STEPHENSONS AND BRUNEL--EAST COAST ROUTE\r\nTO SCOTLAND--ROYAL BORDER BRIDGE, BERWICK--HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE, NEWCASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe career of George Stephenson was drawing to a close.  He had for some\r\ntime been gradually retiring from the more active pursuit of railway\r\nengineering, and confining himself to the promotion of only a few\r\nundertakings in which he took a more than ordinary personal interest.  In\r\n1840, when the extensive main lines in the Midland districts had been\r\nfinished and opened for traffic, he publicly expressed his intention of\r\nwithdrawing from the profession.  He had reached sixty, and, having spent\r\nthe greater part of his life in very hard work, he naturally desired rest\r\nand retirement in his old age.  There was the less necessity for his\r\ncontinuing \"in harness,\" as Robert Stephenson was now in full career as a\r\nleading railway engineer, and his father had pleasure in handing over to\r\nhim, with the sanction of the companies concerned, nearly all the railway\r\nappointments which he held.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson amply repaid his father's care.  The sound education of\r\nwhich he had laid the foundations at school, improved by his subsequent\r\nculture, but more than all by his father's example of application,\r\nindustry, and thoroughness in all that he undertook, told powerfully in\r\nthe formation of his character, not less than in the discipline of his\r\nintellect.  His father had early implanted in him habits of mental\r\nactivity, familiarized him with the laws of mechanics, and carefully\r\ntrained and stimulated his inventive faculties, the first great fruits of\r\nwhich, as we have seen, were exhibited in the triumph of the \"Rocket\" at\r\nRainhill.  \"I am fully conscious in my own mind,\" said the son at a\r\nmeeting of the Mechanical Engineers at Newcastle, in 1858, \"how greatly\r\nmy civil engineering has been regulated and influenced by the mechanical\r\nknowledge which I derived directly from my father; and the more my\r\nexperience has advanced, the more convinced I have become that it is\r\nnecessary to educate an engineer in the workshop.  That is, emphatically,\r\nthe education which will render the engineer most intelligent, most\r\nuseful, and the fullest of resources in times of difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson was but twenty-six years old when the performances of\r\nthe \"Rocket\" established the practicability of steam locomotion on\r\nrailways.  He was shortly after appointed engineer of the Leicester and\r\nSwannington Railway; after which, at his father's request, he was made\r\njoint engineer with himself in laying out the London and Birmingham\r\nRailway, and the execution of that line was afterwards entrusted to him\r\nas sole engineer.  The stability and excellence of the works of that\r\nrailway, the difficulties which had been successfully overcome in the\r\ncourse of its construction, and the judgment which was displayed by\r\nRobert Stephenson throughout the whole conduct of the undertaking to its\r\ncompletion, established his reputation as an engineer; and his father\r\ncould now look with confidence and with pride upon his son's\r\nachievements.  From that time forward, father and son worked together as\r\none man, each jealous of the other's honour; and on the father's\r\nretirement, it was generally recognized that, in the sphere of railways,\r\nRobert Stephenson was the foremost man, the safest guide, and the most\r\nactive worker.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson was subsequently appointed engineer of the Eastern\r\nCounties, the Northern and Eastern, and the Blackwall railways, besides\r\nmany lines in the midland and southern districts.  When the speculation\r\nof 1844 set in, his services were, of course, greatly in request.  Thus,\r\nin one session, we find him engaged as engineer for not fewer than 33 new\r\nschemes.  Projectors thought themselves fortunate who could secure his\r\nname, and he had only to propose his terms to obtain them.  The work\r\nwhich he performed at this period of his life was indeed enormous, and\r\nhis income was large beyond any previous instance of engineering gain.\r\nBut much of his labour was heavy hackwork of a very uninteresting\r\ncharacter.  During the sittings of the committees of Parliament, almost\r\nevery moment of his time was occupied in consultations, and in preparing\r\nevidence or in giving it.  The crowded, low-roofed committee-rooms of the\r\nold Houses of Parliament were altogether inadequate to accommodate the\r\nrush of perspiring projectors of bills, and even the lobbies were\r\nsometimes choked with them.  To have borne that noisome atmosphere and\r\nheat would have tested the constitutions of salamanders, and engineers\r\nwere only human.  With brains kept in a state of excitement during the\r\nentire day, no wonder their nervous systems became unstrung.  Their only\r\nchance of refreshment was during an occasional rush to the bun and\r\nsandwich stand in the lobby, though sometimes even that resource failed\r\nthem.  Then, with mind and body jaded--probably after undergoing a series\r\nof consultations upon many bills after the rising of the committees--the\r\nexhausted engineers would seek to stimulate nature by a late, perhaps a\r\nheavy, dinner.  What chance had any ordinary constitution of surviving\r\nsuch an ordeal?  The consequence was, that stomach, brain, and liver were\r\nalike irretrievably injured; and hence the men who bore the brunt of\r\nthose struggles--Stephenson, Brunel, Locke, and Errington--have already\r\nall died, comparatively young men.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning the name of Brunel, we are reminded of him as the principal\r\nrival and competitor of Robert Stephenson.  Both were the sons of\r\ndistinguished men, and both inherited the fame and followed in the\r\nfootsteps of their fathers.  The Stephensons were inventive, practical,\r\nand sagacious; the Brunels ingenious, imaginative, and daring.  The\r\nformer were as thoroughly English in their characteristics as the latter\r\nwere perhaps as thoroughly French.  The fathers and the sons were alike\r\nsuccessful in their works, though not in the same degree.  Measured by\r\npractical and profitable results, the Stephensons were unquestionably the\r\nsafer men to follow.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were destined often to come\r\ninto collision in the course of their professional life.  Their\r\nrespective railway districts \"marched\" with each other, and it became\r\ntheir business to invade or defend those districts, according as the\r\npolicy of their respective boards might direct.  The gauge of 7 feet\r\nfixed by Mr. Brunel for the Great Western Railway, so entirely different\r\nfrom that of 4ft. 8.5in. adopted by the Stephensons on the Northern and\r\nMidland lines, was from the first a great cause of contention.  But Mr.\r\nBrunel had always an aversion to follow any man's lead; and that another\r\nengineer had fixed the gauge of a railway, or built a bridge, or designed\r\nan engine, in one way, was of itself often a sufficient reason with him\r\nfor adopting an altogether different course.  Robert Stephenson, on his\r\npart, though less bold, was more practical, preferring to follow the old\r\nroutes, and to tread in the safe steps of his father.\r\n\r\nMr. Brunel, however, determined that the Great Western should be a\r\ngiant's road, and that travelling should be conducted upon it at double\r\nspeed.  His ambition was to make the _best_ road that imagination could\r\ndevise; whereas the main object of the Stephensons, both father and son,\r\nwas to make a road that would _pay_.  Although, tried by the Stephenson\r\ntest, Brunel's magnificent road was a failure so far as the shareholders\r\nin the Great Western Company were concerned, the stimulus which his\r\nambitious designs gave to mechanical invention at the time proved a\r\ngeneral good.  The narrow-gauge engineers exerted themselves to quicken\r\ntheir locomotives to the utmost.  They improved and re-improved them; the\r\nmachinery was simplified and perfected; outside cylinders gave place to\r\ninside; the steadier and more rapid and effective action of the engine\r\nwas secured; and in a few years the highest speed on the narrow-gauge\r\nlines went up from 30 to about 50 miles an hour.  For this rapidity of\r\nprogress we are in no small degree indebted to the stimulus imparted to\r\nthe narrow-gauge engineers by Mr. Brunel.  And it is well for a country\r\nthat it should possess men such as he, ready to dare the untried, and to\r\nventure boldly into new paths.  Individuals may suffer from the cost of\r\nthe experiments; but the nation, which is an aggregate of individuals,\r\ngains, and so does the world at large.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the characteristics of Brunel to believe in the success of\r\nthe schemes for which he was professionally engaged as engineer; and he\r\nproved this by investing his savings largely in the Great Western\r\nRailway, in the South Devon atmospheric line, and in the Great Eastern\r\nsteamship, with what results are well known.  Robert Stephenson, on the\r\ncontrary, with characteristic caution, towards the latter years of his\r\nlife avoided holding unguaranteed railway shares; and though he might\r\nexecute magnificent structures, such as the Victoria Bridge across the\r\nSt. Lawrence, he was careful not to embark any portion of his own fortune\r\nin the ordinary capital of these concerns.  In 1845, he shrewdly foresaw\r\nthe inevitable crash that was about to follow the mania of that year; and\r\nwhile shares were still at a premium he took the opportunity of selling\r\nout all that he had.  He urged his father to do the same thing, but\r\nGeorge's reply was characteristic.  \"No,\" said he; \"I took my shares for\r\nan investment, and not to speculate with, and I am not going to sell them\r\nnow because folks have gone mad about railways.\"  The consequence was,\r\nthat he continued to hold the 60,000 pounds which he had invested in the\r\nshares of various railways until his death, when they were at once sold\r\nout by his son, though at a great depreciation on their original cost.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest battles fought between the Stephensons and Brunel was\r\nfor the railway between Newcastle and Berwick, forming part of the great\r\nEast Coast route to Scotland.  As early as 1836, George Stephenson had\r\nsurveyed two lines to connect Edinburgh with Newcastle: one by Berwick\r\nand Dunbar along the coast, and the other, more inland, by Carter Fell,\r\nup the vale of the Gala, to the northern capital; but both projects lay\r\ndormant for several years longer, until the completion of the Midland and\r\nother main lines as far north as Newcastle, had the effect of again\r\nreviving the subject of the extension of the route as far as Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, 1844, the Newcastle and Darlington line--an\r\nimportant link of the great main highway to the north--was completed and\r\npublicly opened, thus connecting the Thames and the Tyne by a continuous\r\nline of railway.  On that day the Stephensons, with a distinguished party\r\nof railway men, travelled by express train from London to Newcastle in\r\nabout nine hours.  It was a great event, and was worthily celebrated.\r\nThe population of Newcastle held holiday; and a banquet given in the\r\nAssembly Rooms the same evening assumed the form of an ovation to George\r\nStephenson and his son.  Thirty years before, in the capacity of a\r\nworkman, he had been labouring at the construction of his first\r\nlocomotive in the immediate neighbourhood.  By slow and laborious steps\r\nhe had worked his way on, dragging the locomotive into notice, and\r\nraising himself in public estimation; until at length he had victoriously\r\nestablished the railway system, and went back amongst his townsmen to\r\nreceive their greeting.\r\n\r\nAfter the opening of this railway, the project of the East Coast line\r\nfrom Newcastle to Berwick was revived; and George Stephenson, who had\r\nalready identified himself with the question, and was intimately\r\nacquainted with every foot of the ground, was called upon to assist the\r\npromoters with his judgment and experience.  He again recommended as\r\nstrongly as before the line he had previously surveyed; and on its being\r\nadopted by the local committee, the necessary steps were taken to have\r\nthe scheme brought before Parliament in the ensuing session.  The East\r\nCoast line was not, however, to be allowed to pass without a fight.  On\r\nthe contrary, it had to encounter as stout an opposition as the\r\nStephensons had ever experienced.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that about this time the plan of substituting\r\natmospheric pressure for locomotive steam-power in the working of\r\nrailways, had become very popular.  Many eminent engineers supported the\r\natmospheric system, and a strong party in Parliament, headed by the Prime\r\nMinister, were greatly disposed in its favour.  Mr. Brunel warmly\r\nespoused the atmospheric principle, and his persuasive manner, as well as\r\nhis admitted scientific ability, unquestionably exercised considerable\r\ninfluence in determining the views of many leading members of both\r\nHouses.  Amongst others, Lord Howick, one of the members for\r\nNorthumberland, adopted the new principle, and, possessing great local\r\ninfluence, he succeeded in forming a powerful confederacy of the landed\r\ngentry in favour of Brunel's atmospheric railway through that county.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson could not brook the idea of seeing the locomotive, for\r\nwhich he had fought so many stout battles, pushed to one side, and that\r\nin the very county in which its great powers had been first developed.\r\nNor did he relish the appearance of Mr. Brunel as the engineer of Lord\r\nHowick's scheme, in opposition to the line which had occupied his\r\nthoughts and been the object of his strenuous advocacy for so many years.\r\nWhen Stephenson first met Brunel in Newcastle, he good-naturedly shook\r\nhim by the collar, and asked \"What business he had north of the Tyne?\"\r\nGeorge gave him to understand that they were to have a fair stand-up\r\nfight for the ground, and, shaking hands before the battle like\r\nEnglishmen, they parted in good humour.  A public meeting was held at\r\nNewcastle in the following December, when, after a full discussion of the\r\nmerits of the respective plans, Stephenson's line was almost unanimously\r\nadopted as the best.\r\n\r\nThe rival projects went before Parliament in 1845, and a severe contest\r\nensued.  The display of ability and tactics on both sides was great.\r\nRobert Stephenson was examined at great length as to the merits of the\r\nlocomotive line, and Brunel at equally great length as to the merits of\r\nthe atmospheric system.  Mr. Brunel, in his evidence, said that after\r\nnumerous experiments, he had arrived at the conclusion that the\r\nmechanical contrivance of the atmospheric system was perfectly\r\napplicable, and he believed that it would likewise be more economical in\r\nmost cases than locomotive power.  \"In short,\" said he, \"rapidity,\r\ncomfort, safety, and economy, are its chief recommendations.\"\r\n\r\nBut the locomotive again triumphed.  The Stephenson Coast Line secured\r\nthe approval of Parliament; and the shareholders in the Atmospheric\r\nCompany were happily prevented investing their capital in what would\r\nunquestionably have proved a gigantic blunder.  For, less than three\r\nyears later, the whole of the atmospheric tubes which had been laid down\r\non other lines were pulled up and the materials sold--including Mr.\r\nBrunel's immense tube on the South Devon Railway--to make way for the\r\nworking of the locomotive engine.  George Stephenson's first verdict of\r\n\"It won't do,\" was thus conclusively confirmed.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson used afterwards to describe with great gusto an\r\ninterview which took place between Lord Howick and his father, at his\r\noffice in Great George Street, during the progress of the bill in\r\nParliament.  His father was in the outer office, where he used to spend a\r\ngood deal of his spare time; occasionally taking a quiet wrestle with a\r\nfriend when nothing else was stirring. {309}  On the day in question,\r\nGeorge was standing with his back to the fire, when Lord Howick called to\r\nsee Robert.  Oh! thought George, he has come to try and talk Robert over\r\nabout that atmospheric gimcrack; but I'll tackle his Lordship.  \"Come in,\r\nmy Lord,\" said he, \"Robert's busy; but I'll answer your purpose quite as\r\nwell; sit down here, if you please.\"  George began, \"Now, my Lord, I know\r\nvery well what you have come about: it's that atmospheric line in the\r\nnorth; I will show you in less than five minutes that it can never\r\nanswer.\"  \"If Mr. Robert Stephenson is not at liberty, I can call again,\"\r\nsaid his Lordship.  \"He's certainly occupied on important business just\r\nat present,\" was George's answer; \"but I can tell you far better than he\r\ncan what nonsense the atmospheric system is: Robert's good-natured, you\r\nsee, and if your Lordship were to get alongside of him you might talk him\r\nover; so you have been quite lucky in meeting with me.  Now, just look at\r\nthe question of expense,\"--and then he proceeded in his strong Doric to\r\nexplain his views in detail, until Lord Howick could stand it no longer,\r\nand he rose and walked towards the door.  George followed him down\r\nstairs, to finish his demolition of the atmospheric system, and his\r\nparting words were, \"You may take my word for it, my Lord, it will never\r\nanswer.\"  George afterwards told his son with glee of \"the settler\" he\r\nhad given Lord Howick.\r\n\r\nSo closely were the Stephensons identified with this measure, and so\r\ngreat was the personal interest which they were both known to take in its\r\nsuccess, that, on the news of the triumph of the bill reaching Newcastle,\r\na sort of general holiday took place, and the workmen belonging to the\r\nStephenson Locomotive Factory, upwards of 800 in number, walked in\r\nprocession through the principal streets of the town, accompanied with\r\nmusic and banners.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enter into any description of the works on the\r\nNewcastle and Berwick Railway.  There are no fewer than 110 bridges of\r\nall sorts on the line--some under and some over it.  But by far the most\r\nformidable piece of masonry work on this railway is at its northern\r\nextremity, where it passes across the Tweed into Scotland, immediately\r\nopposite the formerly redoubtable castle of Berwick.  Not many centuries\r\nhad passed since the district amidst which this bridge stands was the\r\nscene of almost constant warfare.  Berwick was regarded as the key of\r\nScotland, and was fiercely fought for, sometimes held by a Scotch and\r\nsometimes by an English garrison.  Though strongly fortified, it was\r\nrepeatedly taken by assault.  On its capture by Edward I., Boetius says\r\n17,000 persons were slain, so that its streets \"ran with blood like a\r\nriver.\"  Within sight of the ramparts, a little to the west, is Halidon\r\nHill, where a famous victory was gained by Edward III., over the Scottish\r\narmy under Douglas; and there is scarcely a foot of ground in the\r\nneighbourhood but has been the scene of contention in days long past.  In\r\nthe reigns of James I. and Charles I., a bridge of 15 arches was built\r\nacross the Tweed at Berwick; and in our own day a railway-bridge of 28\r\narches has been built a little above the old one, but at a much higher\r\nlevel.  The bridge built by the Kings, out of the national resources,\r\ncost 15,000 pounds, and occupied 24 years and 4 months in the building;\r\nthe bridge built by the Railway Company, with funds drawn from private\r\nresources, cost 120,000 pounds, and was finished in 3 years and 4 months\r\nfrom the day of laying the foundation-stone.\r\n\r\n          [Picture: The Royal Border Bridge, Berwick-upon-Tweed]\r\n\r\nThis important viaduct, built after the design of Robert Stephenson,\r\nconsists of a series of 28 semicircular arches, each 61 feet 6 inches in\r\nspan, the greatest height above the bed of the river being 126 feet.  The\r\nwhole is built of ashlar, with a hearting of rubble; excepting the river\r\nparts of the arches, which are constructed with bricks laid in cement.\r\nThe total length of the work is 2160 feet.  The foundations of the piers\r\nwere got in by coffer-dams in the ordinary way, Nasmyth's steam-hammer\r\nbeing extensively used in driving the piles.  The bearing piles, from\r\nwhich the foundations of the piers were built up, were each capable of\r\ncarrying 70 tons.\r\n\r\nAnother bridge, of still greater importance, necessary to complete the\r\ncontinuity of the East Coast route, was the masterwork erected by Robert\r\nStephenson between the north and south banks of the Tyne at Newcastle,\r\ncommonly known as the High Level Bridge.  Mr. R. W. Brandling, George\r\nStephenson's early friend, is entitled to the merit of originating the\r\nidea of this bridge as it was eventually carried out, with a central\r\nterminus for the northern railways in the Castle Garth.  The plan was\r\nfirst promulgated by him in 1841; and in the following year it was\r\nresolved that George Stephenson should be consulted as to the most\r\nadvisable site for the proposed structure.  A prospectus of a High Level\r\nBridge Company was issued in 1843, the names of George Stephenson and\r\nGeorge Hudson appearing on the committee of management, Robert Stephenson\r\nbeing the consulting engineer.  The project was eventually taken up by\r\nthe Newcastle and Darlington Railway Company, and an Act for the\r\nconstruction of the bridge was obtained in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe rapid extension of railways had given an extraordinary stimulus to\r\nthe art of bridge-building; the number of such structures erected in\r\nGreat Britain alone, since 1830, having been above 25,000, or more than\r\nall that had before existed in the country.  Instead of the erection a\r\nsingle large bridge constituting, as formerly, an epoch in engineering,\r\nhundreds of extensive bridges of novel design were simultaneously\r\nconstructed.  The necessity which existed for carrying rigid roads,\r\ncapable of bearing heavy railway trains at high speeds, over extensive\r\ngaps free of support, rendered it obvious that the methods which had up\r\nto that time been employed for bridging space were altogether\r\ninsufficient.  The railway engineer could not, like the ordinary road\r\nengineer, divert his road and make choice of the best point for crossing\r\na river or a valley.  He must take such ground as lay in the line of his\r\nrailway, be it bog, or mud, or shifting sand.  Navigable rivers and\r\ncrowded thoroughfares had to be crossed without interruption to the\r\nexisting traffic, sometimes by bridges at right angles to the river or\r\nroad, sometimes by arches more or less oblique.  In many cases great\r\ndifficulty arose from the limited nature of the headway; but, as the\r\nlevel of the original road must generally be preserved, and that of the\r\nrailway was in a measure fixed and determined, it was necessary to modify\r\nthe form and structure of the bridge, in almost every case, in order to\r\ncomply with the public requirements.  Novel conditions were met by fresh\r\ninventions, and difficulties of the most unusual character were one after\r\nanother successfully surmounted.  In executing these extraordinary works,\r\niron has been throughout the sheet-anchor of the engineer.  In its\r\ndifferent forms of cast or wrought iron, it offered a valuable resource,\r\nwhere rapidity of execution, great strength, and cheapness of\r\nconstruction in the first instance, were elements of prime importance;\r\nand by its skilful use, the railway architect was enabled to achieve\r\nresults which thirty years ago would scarcely have been thought possible.\r\n\r\nIn many of the early cast-iron bridges the old form of the arch was\r\nadopted, the stability of the structure depending wholly on compression,\r\nthe only novel feature being the use of iron instead of stone.  But in a\r\nlarge proportion of cases, the arch, with the railroad over it, was found\r\ninapplicable in consequence of the limited headway which it provided.\r\nHence it early occurred to George Stephenson, when constructing the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway, to adopt the simple cast-iron beam for\r\nthe crossing of several roads and canals along that line--this beam\r\nresembling in some measure the lintel of the early temples--the pressure\r\non the abutments being purely vertical.  One of the earliest instances of\r\nthis kind of bridge was that erected over Water Street, Manchester, in\r\n1829; after which, cast-iron girders, with their lower webs considerably\r\nlarger than their upper, were ordinarily employed where the span was\r\nmoderate; and wrought-iron tie rods below were added to give increased\r\nstrength where the span was greater.\r\n\r\nThe next step was the contrivance of arched beams or bowstring girders,\r\nfirmly held together by horizontal ties to resist the thrust, instead of\r\nabutments.  Numerous excellent specimens of this description of bridge\r\nwere erected by Robert Stephenson on the original London and Birmingham\r\nRailway; but by far the grandest work of the kind--perfect as a specimen\r\nof modern constructive skill--was the High Level Bridge, which we owe to\r\nthe genius of the same engineer.\r\n\r\nThe problem was, to throw a railway bridge across the deep ravine which\r\nlies between the towns of Newcastle and Gateshead, at the bottom of which\r\nflows the navigable river Tyne.  Along and up the sides of the valley--on\r\nthe Newcastle bank especially--run streets of old-fashioned houses,\r\nclustered together in the strange forms peculiar to the older cities.\r\nThe ravine is of great depth--so deep and so gloomy-looking towards dusk,\r\nthat local tradition records that when the Duke of Cumberland arrived\r\nlate in the evening at the brow of the hill overlooking the Tyne, on his\r\nway to Culloden, he exclaimed to his attendants, on looking down into the\r\nblack gorge before him, \"For God's sake, don't think of taking me down\r\nthat coal-pit at this time of night!\"  The road down the Gateshead High\r\nStreet is almost as steep as the roof of a house, and up the Newcastle\r\nSide, as the street there is called, it is little better.  During many\r\ncenturies the traffic north and south passed along this dangerous and\r\ndifficult route, over the old bridge which crosses the river in the\r\nbottom of the valley.  For about 30 years the Newcastle Corporation had\r\ndiscussed various methods of improving the communication between the\r\ntowns; and the discussion might have gone on for 30 years more, but for\r\nthe advent of railways, when the skill and enterprise to which they gave\r\nbirth speedily solved the difficulty and bridged the ravine.  The local\r\nauthorities adroitly took advantage of the opportunity, and insisted on\r\nthe provision of a road for ordinary vehicles and foot passengers in\r\naddition to the railroad.  In this circumstance originated one of the\r\nstriking peculiarities of the High Level Bridge, which serves two\r\npurposes, being a railway above and a carriage roadway underneath.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the river at the point of crossing is 515 feet, but the\r\nlength of the bridge and viaduct between the Gateshead station and the\r\nterminus on the Newcastle side is about 4000 feet.  It springs from\r\nPipewell Gate Bank, on the south, directly across to Castle Garth, where,\r\nnearly fronting the bridge, stands the fine old Norman keep of the _New_\r\nCastle, now nearly 800 years old, and a little beyond it is the spire of\r\nSt. Nicholas Church, with its light and graceful Gothic crown; the whole\r\nforming a grand architectural group of unusual historic interest.  The\r\nbridge passes completely over the roofs of the houses which fill both\r\nsides of the valley; and the extraordinary height of the upper parapet,\r\nwhich is about 130 feet above the bed of the river, offers a prospect to\r\nthe passing traveller the like of which is perhaps nowhere else to be\r\nseen.  Far below are the queer chares and closes, the wynds and lanes of\r\nold Newcastle; the water is crowded with pudgy, black, coal keels; and,\r\nwhen there is a partial dispersion of the great smoke clouds which\r\nusually obscure the sky, the funnels of steamers and the masts of\r\nshipping may be seen far down the river.  The old bridge lies so far\r\nbeneath that the passengers crossing it seem like so many bees passing to\r\nand fro.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty encountered in building the bridge was in securing a\r\nsolid foundation for the piers.  The dimensions of the piles to be driven\r\nwere so huge, that the engineer found it necessary to employ some\r\nextraordinary means for the purpose.  He called Nasmyth's Titanic\r\nsteam-hammer to his aid--the first occasion, we believe, on which this\r\nprodigious power was employed in bridge pile-driving.  A temporary\r\nstaging was erected for the steam-engine and hammer apparatus, which\r\nrested on two keels, and, notwithstanding the newness and stiffness of\r\nthe machinery, the first pile was driven on the 6th October, 1846, to a\r\ndepth of 32 feet, in four minutes.  Two hammers of 30 cwt. each were kept\r\nin regular use, making from 60 to 70 strokes a minute; and the results\r\nwere astounding to those who had been accustomed to the old style of\r\npile-driving by means of the ordinary pile-frame, consisting of slide,\r\nram, and monkey.  By the old system, the pile was driven by a\r\ncomparatively small mass of iron descending with great velocity from a\r\nconsiderable height--the velocity being in excess and the mass deficient,\r\nand calculated, like the momentum of a cannon-ball, rather for\r\ndestructive than impulsive action.  In the case of the steam pile-driver,\r\non the contrary, the whole weight of a heavy mass is delivered rapidly\r\nupon a driving-block of several tons weight placed directly over the head\r\nof the pile, the weight never ceasing, and the blows being repeated at\r\nthe rate of a blow a second, until the pile is driven home.  It is a\r\ncurious fact, that the rapid strokes of the steam-hammer evolved so much\r\nheat, that on many occasions the pile-head burst into flames during the\r\nprocess of driving.  The elastic force of steam is the power that lifts\r\nthe ram, the escape permitting its entire force to fall upon the head of\r\nthe driving block; while the steam above the piston on the upper part of\r\nthe cylinder, acting as a buffer or recoil-spring, materially enhances\r\nthe effect of the downward blow.  As soon as one pile was driven, the\r\ntraveller, hovering overhead, presented another, and down it went into\r\nthe solid bed of the river, with almost as much ease as a lady sticks\r\npins into a cushion.  By the aid of this powerful machine, pile-driving,\r\nformerly among the most costly and tedious of engineering operations,\r\nbecame easy, rapid, and comparatively economical.\r\n\r\nWhen the piles had been driven and the coffer-dams formed and puddled,\r\nthe water within the enclosed spaces was pumped out by the aid of\r\npowerful engines, so as, if possible, to lay bare the bed of the river.\r\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced in getting in the foundations of\r\nthe middle pier, in consequence of the water forcing itself through the\r\nquicksand beneath as fast as it was removed, This fruitless labour went\r\non for months, and many expedients were tried.  Chalk was thrown in in\r\nlarge quantities outside the piling, but without effect.  Cement concrete\r\nwas at last put within the coffer-dam, until it set, and the bottom was\r\nthen found to be secure.  A bed of concrete was laid up to the level of\r\nthe heads of the piles, the foundation course of stone blocks being\r\ncommenced about two feet below low water, and the building proceeded\r\nwithout further difficulty.  It may serve to give an idea of the\r\nmagnitude of the work, when we state that 400,000 cubic feet of ashlar,\r\nrubble, and concrete were worked up in the piers, and 450,000 cubic feet\r\nin the land-arches and approaches.\r\n\r\nThe most novel feature of the structure is the use of cast and wrought\r\niron in forming the double bridge, which admirably combines the two\r\nprinciples of the arch and suspension; the railway being carried over the\r\nback of the ribbed arches in the usual manner, while the carriage-road\r\nand footpaths, forming a long gallery or aisle, are suspended from these\r\narches by wrought-iron vertical rods, with horizontal tie-bars to resist\r\nthe thrust.  The suspension-bolts are enclosed within spandril pillars of\r\ncast iron, which give great stiffness to the superstructure.  This system\r\nof longitudinal and vertical bracing has been much admired, for it not\r\nonly accomplishes the primary object of securing rigidity in the roadway,\r\nbut at the same time, by its graceful arrangement, heightens the beauty\r\nof the structure.  The arches consist of four main ribs, disposed in\r\npairs with a clear distance between the two inner arches of 20 feet 4\r\ninches, forming the carriage-road, while between each of the inner and\r\nouter ribs there is a space of 6 feet 2 inches, constituting the\r\nfootpaths.  Each arch is cast in five separate lengths or segments,\r\nstrongly bolted together.  The ribs spring from horizontal plates of cast\r\niron, bedded and secured on the stone piers.  All the abutting joints\r\nwere carefully executed by machinery, the fitting being of the most\r\nperfect kind.  In order to provide for the expansion and contraction of\r\nthe iron arching, and to preserve the equilibrium of the piers without\r\ndisturbance or racking of the other parts of the bridge, it was arranged\r\nthat the ribs of every two adjoining arches resting on the same pier\r\nshould be secured to the springing-plates by keys and joggles; whilst on\r\nthe next piers on either side, the ribs remained free and were at liberty\r\nto expand or contract according to temperature--a space being left for\r\nthe purpose.  Hence each arch is complete and independent in itself, the\r\npiers having simply to sustain their vertical pressure.  There are six\r\narches of 125 feet span each; the two approaches to the bridge being\r\nformed of cast-iron pillars and bearers in keeping with the arches.\r\n\r\n           [Picture: High Level Bridge--Elevation of one Arch]\r\n\r\nThe result is a bridge that for massive solidity may be pronounced\r\nunrivalled.  It is perhaps the most magnificent and striking of all the\r\nbridges to which railways have given birth, and has been worthily styled\r\n\"the King of railway structures.\"  It is a monument of the highest\r\nengineering skill of our time, with the impress of power grandly stamped\r\nupon it.  It will also be observed, from the drawing placed as the\r\nfrontispiece of this book, that the High Level Bridge forms a very fine\r\nobject in a picture of great interest, full of striking architectural\r\nvariety and beauty.  The bridge was opened on the 15th August, 1849, and\r\na few days after the royal train passed over it, halting for a few\r\nminutes to enable her Majesty to survey the wonderful scene below.  In\r\nthe course of the following year the Queen opened the extensive stone\r\nviaduct across the Tweed, above described, by which the last link was\r\ncompleted of the continuous line of railway between London and Edinburgh.\r\nOver the entrance to the Berwick station, occupying the site of the once\r\nredoubtable Border fortress, so often the deadly battle-ground of the\r\nancient Scots and English, was erected an arch under which the royal\r\ntrain passed, bearing in large letters of gold the appropriate words,\r\n\"_The last act of the Union_.\"\r\n\r\nThe warders at Berwick no longer look out from the castle walls to descry\r\nthe glitter of Southron spears.  The bell-tower, from which the alarm was\r\nsounded of old, though still standing, is deserted; the only bell heard\r\nwithin the precincts of the old castle being the railway porter's bell\r\nannouncing the arrival and departure of trains.  You see the Scotch\r\nexpress pass along the bridge and speed southward on the wings of steam.\r\nBut no alarm spreads along the border now.  Northumbrian beeves are safe.\r\nChevy-Chase and Otterburn are quiet sheep-pastures.  The only men at arms\r\non the battlements of Alnwick Castle are of stone.  Bamborough Castle has\r\nbecome an asylum for shipwrecked mariners, and the Norman Keep at\r\nNewcastle has been converted into a Museum of Antiquities.  The railway\r\nhas indeed consummated the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nROBERT STEPHENSON'S TUBULAR BRIDGES AT MENAI AND CONWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to describe briefly another great undertaking, begun by\r\nGeorge Stephenson, and taken up and completed by his son, in the course\r\nof which the latter carried out some of his greatest works--we mean the\r\nChester and Holyhead Railway, completing the railway connection with\r\nDublin, as the Newcastle and Berwick line completed the connection with\r\nEdinburgh.  It will thus be seen how closely Telford was followed by the\r\nStephensons in perfecting the highways of their respective epochs; the\r\nformer by means of turnpike-roads, and the latter by means of railways.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson surveyed a line from Chester to Holyhead in 1838, and\r\nat the same time reported on the line through North Wales to Port\r\nDynllaen, proposed by the Irish Railway Commissioners.  His advice was\r\nstrongly in favour of adopting the line to Holyhead, as less costly and\r\npresenting better gradients.  A public meeting was held at Chester, in\r\nJanuary, 1839, in support of the latter measure, at which he was present\r\nto give explanations.  Mr. Uniacke, the Mayor, in opening the\r\nproceedings, said that Mr. Stephenson was present, ready to answer any\r\nquestions which might be put to him on the subject; and it was\r\njudiciously remarked that \"it would be better that he should be asked\r\nquestions than required to make a speech; for, though a very good\r\nengineer, he was a bad speaker.\"  One of the questions then put to Mr.\r\nStephenson related to the mode by which he proposed to haul the passenger\r\ncarriages over the Menai Suspension Bridge by horse power; and he was\r\nasked whether he knew the pressure the bridge was capable of sustaining.\r\nHis answer was, that \"he had not yet made any calculations; but he\r\nproposed getting data which would enable him to arrive at an accurate\r\ncalculation of the actual strain upon the bridge during the late gale.\r\nHe had, however, no hesitation in saying that it was more than twenty\r\ntimes as much as the strain of a train of carriages and a locomotive\r\nengine.  The only reason why he proposed to convey the carriages over by\r\nhorses, was in order that he might, by distributing the weight, not\r\nincrease the wavy motion.  All the train would be on at once; but\r\ndistributed.  This he thought better than passing them, linked together,\r\nby a locomotive engine.\"  It will thus be observed that the\r\npracticability of throwing a rigid railway bridge across the Straits had\r\nnot yet been contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin Chamber of Commerce passed resolutions in favour of\r\nStephenson's line, after hearing his explanation of its essential\r\nfeatures.  The project, after undergoing much discussion, was at length\r\nembodied in an Act passed in 1844; and the work was brought to a\r\nsuccessful completion by his son, with several important modifications,\r\nincluding the grand original feature of the tubular bridges across the\r\nMenai Straits and the estuary of the Conway.  Excepting these great\r\nworks, the construction of this line presented no unusual features;\r\nthough the remarkable terrace cut for the accommodation of the railway\r\nunder the steep slope of Penmaen Mawr is worthy of a passing notice.\r\n\r\nAbout midway between Conway and Bangor, Penmaen Mawr forms a bold and\r\nalmost precipitous headland, at the base of which, in rough weather, the\r\nocean dashes with great fury.  There was not space enough between the\r\nmountain and the strand for the passage of the railway; hence in some\r\nplaces the rock had to be blasted to form a terrace, and in others\r\nsea-walls had to be built up to the proper level, on which to form an\r\nembankment of sufficient width to enable the road to be laid.  [Picture:\r\nPenmaen Mawr.  (By Percival Skelton.)]  A tunnel 10.5 chains in length was\r\ncut through the headland itself; and on its east and west sides the line\r\nwas formed by a terrace cut out of the cliff, and by embankments\r\nprotected by sea walls; the terrace being three times interrupted by\r\nembankments in its course of about 1.25 mile.  The road lies so close\r\nunder the steep mountain face, that it was even found necessary at\r\ncertain places to protect it against possible accidents from falling\r\nstones, by means of a covered way.  The terrace on the east side of the\r\nheadland was, however, in some measure protected against the roll of the\r\nsea by the mass of stone run out from the tunnel, and forming a deep\r\nshingle bank in front of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe part of the work which lies on the westward of the headland\r\npenetrated by the tunnel, was exposed to the full force of the sea; and\r\nthe formation of the road at that point was attended with great\r\ndifficulty.  While the sea wall was still in progress, its strength was\r\nseverely tried by a strong north-westerly gale, which blew in October,\r\n1846, with a spring tide of 17 feet.  On the following morning it was\r\nfound that a large portion of the rubble was irreparably injured, and 200\r\nyards of the wall were then replaced by an open viaduct, with the piers\r\nplaced edgeways to the sea, the openings between them being spanned by\r\nten cast-iron girders each 42 feet long.  This accident induced the\r\nengineer to alter the contour of the sea wall, so that it should present\r\na diminished resistance to the force of the waves.  But the sea repeated\r\nits assaults, and made further havoc with the work; entailing heavy\r\nexpenses and a complete reorganisation of the contract.  Increased\r\nsolidity was then given to the masonry, and the face of the wall\r\nunderwent further change.  At some points outworks were constructed, and\r\npiles were driven into the beach about 15 feet from the base of the wall,\r\nfor the purpose of protecting its foundations and breaking the force of\r\nthe waves.  The work was at length finished after about three years'\r\nanxious labour; but Mr. Stephenson confessed that if a long tunnel had\r\nbeen made in the first instance through the solid rock of Penmaen Mawr, a\r\nsaving of from 25,000 to 30,000 pounds would have been effected.  He also\r\nsaid he had arrived at the conclusion that in railway works engineers\r\nshould endeavour as far as possible to avoid the necessity of contending\r\nwith the sea; {324} but if he were ever again compelled to go within its\r\nreach, he would adopt, instead of retaining walls, an open viaduct,\r\nplacing all the piers edgeways to the force of the sea, and allowing the\r\nwaves to break upon a natural slope of beach.  He was ready enough to\r\nadmit the errors he had committed in the original design of this work;\r\nbut he said he had always gained more information from studying the\r\ncauses of failures and endeavouring to surmount them than he had done\r\nfrom easily-won successes.  Whilst many of the latter had been forgotten,\r\nthe former were indelibly fixed in his memory.\r\n\r\nBut by far the greatest difficulty which Robert Stephenson had to\r\nencounter in executing this railway, was in carrying it across the\r\nStraits of Menai and the estuary of the Conway, where, like his\r\npredecessor Telford when forming his high road through North Wales, he\r\nwas under the necessity of resorting to new and altogether untried\r\nmethods of bridge construction.  At Menai the waters of the Irish Sea are\r\nperpetually vibrating along the precipitous shores of the strait; rising\r\nand falling from 20 to 25 feet at each successive tide; the width and\r\ndepth of the channel being such as to render it available for navigation\r\nby the largest ships.  The problem was, to throw a bridge across this\r\nwide chasm--a bridge of unusual span and dimensions--of such strength as\r\nto be capable of bearing the heaviest loads at high speeds, and at such a\r\nuniform height throughout as not in any way to interfere with the\r\nnavigation of the Strait.  From an early period, Mr. Stephenson had fixed\r\nupon the spot where the Britannia Rock occurs, nearly in the middle of\r\nthe channel, as the most eligible point for crossing; the water-width\r\nfrom shore to shore at high water there being about 1100 feet.  His first\r\nidea was to construct the bridge of two cast-iron arches, each of 350\r\nfeet span.  There was no novelty in this idea; for, as early as the year\r\n1801, Mr. Rennie prepared a design of a cast-iron bridge across the\r\nStrait at the Swilly rocks, the great centre arch of which was to be 450\r\nfeet span; and at a later period, in 1810, Telford submitted a design of\r\na similar bridge at Inys-y-Moch, with a single cast-iron arch of 500\r\nfeet.  But the same objections which led to the rejection of Rennie's and\r\nTelford's designs, proved fatal to Robert Stephenson's, and his\r\niron-arched railway bridge was rejected by the Admiralty.  The navigation\r\nof the Strait was under no circumstances to be interfered with; and even\r\nthe erection of scaffolding from below, to support the bridge during\r\nconstruction, was not to be permitted.  The idea of a suspension bridge\r\nwas dismissed as inapplicable; a degree of rigidity and strength, greater\r\nthan could be secured by any bridge constructed on the principle of\r\nsuspension, being considered an indispensable condition of the proposed\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Britannia Bridge]\r\n\r\nVarious other plans were suggested; but the whole question remained\r\nunsettled even down to the time when the Company went before Parliament,\r\nin 1844, for power to construct the proposed bridges.  No existing kind\r\nof structure seemed to be capable of bearing the fearful extension to\r\nwhich rigid bridges of the necessary spans would be subjected; and some\r\nnew expedient of engineering therefore became necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson was then led to reconsider a design which he had made in\r\n1841 for a road bridge over the river Lea at Ware, with a span of 50\r\nfeet,--the conditions only admitting of a platform 18 or 20 inches thick.\r\nFor this purpose a wrought-iron platform was designed, consisting of a\r\nseries of simple cells, formed of boiler-plates riveted together with\r\nangle-iron.  The bridge was not, however, carried out after this design,\r\nbut was made of separate wrought-iron girders composed of riveted plates.\r\nRecurring to his first idea of this bridge, Mr. Stephenson thought that a\r\nstiff platform might be constructed, with sides of strongly trussed\r\nframe-work of wrought-iron, braced together at top and bottom with plates\r\nof like material riveted together with angle-iron; and that such platform\r\nmight be suspended by strong chains on either side to give it increased\r\nsecurity.  \"It was now,\" says Mr. Stephenson, \"that I came to regard the\r\ntubular platform as a beam, and that the chains should be looked upon as\r\nauxiliaries.\"  It appeared, nevertheless, that without a system of\r\ndiagonal struts inside, which of course would have prevented the passage\r\nof trains _through_ it, this kind of structure was ill-suited for\r\nmaintaining its form, and would be very liable to become lozenge-shaped.\r\nBesides, the rectangular figure was deemed objectionable, from the large\r\nsurface which it presented to the wind.\r\n\r\nIt then occurred to him that circular or elliptical tubes might better\r\nanswer the intended purpose; and in March, 1845, he gave instructions to\r\ntwo of his assistants to prepare drawings of such a structure, the tubes\r\nbeing made with a double thickness of plate at top and bottom.  The\r\nresults of the calculations made as to the strength of such a tube, were\r\nconsidered so satisfactory, that Mr. Stephenson says he determined to\r\nfall back on a bridge of this description, on the rejection of his design\r\nof the two cast-iron arches by the Parliamentary Committee.  Indeed, it\r\nbecame evident that a tubular wrought-iron beam was the only structure\r\nwhich combined the necessary strength and stability for a railway, with\r\nthe conditions deemed essential for the protection of the navigation.  \"I\r\nstood,\" says Mr. Stephenson, \"on the verge of a responsibility from\r\nwhich, I confess, I had nearly shrunk.  The construction of a tubular\r\nbeam of such gigantic dimensions, on a platform elevated and supported by\r\nchains at such a height, did at first present itself as a difficulty of a\r\nvery formidable nature.  Reflection, however, satisfied me that the\r\nprinciples upon which the idea was founded were nothing more than an\r\nextension of those daily in use in the profession of the engineer.  The\r\nmethod, moreover, of calculating the strength of the structure which I\r\nhad adopted, was of the simplest and most elementary character; and\r\nwhatever might be the form of the tube, the principle on which the\r\ncalculations were founded was equally applicable, and could not fail to\r\nlead to equally accurate results.\" {327}  Mr. Stephenson accordingly\r\nannounced to the directors of the railway that he was prepared to carry\r\nout a bridge of this general description, and they adopted his views,\r\nthough not without considerable misgivings.\r\n\r\nWhile the engineer's mind was still occupied with the subject, an\r\naccident occurred to the _Prince of Wales_ iron steamship, at Blackwall,\r\nwhich singularly corroborated his views as to the strength of\r\nwrought-iron beams of large dimensions.  When this vessel was being\r\nlaunched, the cleet on the bow gave way, in consequence of the bolts\r\nbreaking, and let the vessel down so that the bilge came in contact with\r\nthe wharf, and she remained suspended between the water and the wharf for\r\na length of about 110 feet, but without any injury to the plates of the\r\nship; satisfactorily proving the great strength of this form of\r\nconstruction.  Thus, Mr. Stephenson became gradually confirmed in his\r\nopinion that the most feasible method of bridging the strait at Menai and\r\nthe river at Conway was by means of a hollow beam of wrought-iron.  As\r\nthe time was approaching for giving evidence before Parliament on the\r\nsubject, it was necessary for him to settle some definite plan for\r\nsubmission to the committee.  \"My late revered father,\" says he, \"having\r\nalways taken a deep interest in the various proposals which had been\r\nconsidered for carrying a railway across the Menai Straits, requested me\r\nto explain fully to him the views which led me to suggest the use of a\r\ntube, and also the nature of the calculations I had made in reference to\r\nit.  It was during this personal conference that Mr. William Fairbairn\r\naccidentally called upon me, to whom I also explained the principles of\r\nthe structure I had proposed.  He at once acquiesced in their truth, and\r\nexpressed confidence in the feasibility of my project, giving me at the\r\nsame time some facts relative to the remarkable strength of iron\r\nsteamships, and invited me to his works at Millwall, to examine the\r\nconstruction of an iron steamship which was then in progress.\"  The date\r\nof this consultation was early in April, 1845, and Mr. Fairbairn states\r\nthat, on that occasion, \"Mr. Stephenson asked whether such a design was\r\npracticable, and whether I could accomplish it: and it was ultimately\r\narranged that the subject should be investigated experimentally, to\r\ndetermine not only the value of Mr. Stephenson's original conception (of\r\na circular or egg-shaped wrought-iron tube, supported by chains), but\r\nthat of any other tubular form of bridge which might present itself in\r\nthe prosecution of my researches.  The matter was placed unreservedly in\r\nmy hands; the entire conduct of the investigation was entrusted to me;\r\nand, as an experimenter, I was to be left free to exercise my own\r\ndiscretion in the investigation of whatever forms or conditions of the\r\nstructure might appear to me best calculated to secure a safe passage\r\nacross the Straits.\" {329a}  Mr. Fairbairn then proceeded to construct a\r\nnumber of experimental models for the purpose of testing the strength of\r\ntubes of different forms.  The short period which elapsed, however,\r\nbefore the bill was in committee, did not admit of much progress being\r\nmade with those experiments; but from the evidence in chief given by Mr.\r\nStephenson on the subject, on the 5th May following, it appears that the\r\nidea which prevailed in his mind was that of a bridge with openings of\r\n450 feet (afterwards increased to 460 feet); with a roadway formed of a\r\nhollow wrought-iron beam, about 25 feet in diameter, presenting a rigid\r\nplatform, suspended by chains.  At the same time, he expressed the\r\nconfident opinion that a tube of wrought iron would possess sufficient\r\nstrength and rigidity to support a railway train running inside of it\r\nwithout the help of the chains.\r\n\r\nWhile the bill was still in progress, Mr. Fairbairn proceeded with his\r\nexperiments.  He first tested tubes of a cylindrical form, in consequence\r\nof the favourable opinion entertained by Mr. Stephenson of the tubes in\r\nthat shape, extending them subsequently to those of an elliptical form.\r\n{329b}  He found tubes thus shaped more or less defective, and proceeded\r\nto test those of a rectangular kind.  After the bill had received the\r\nroyal assent on the 30th June, 1845, the directors of the company, with\r\ngreat liberality, voted a sum for the purpose of enabling the experiments\r\nto be prosecuted, and upwards of 6000 pounds were thus expended to make\r\nthe assurance of their engineer doubly sure.  Mr. Fairbairn's tests were\r\nof the most elaborate and eventually conclusive character, bringing to\r\nlight many new and important facts of great practical value.  The due\r\nproportions and thicknesses of the top, bottom, and sides of the tubes\r\nwere arrived at after a vast number of trials; one of the results of the\r\nexperiments being the adoption of Mr. Fairbairn's invention of\r\nrectangular hollow cells in the top of the beam for the purpose of giving\r\nit the requisite degree of strength.  About the end of August it was\r\nthought desirable to obtain the assistance of a mathematician, who should\r\nprepare a formula by which the strength of a full-sized tube might be\r\ncalculated from the results of the experiments made with tubes of smaller\r\ndimensions.  Professor Hodgkinson was accordingly called in, and he\r\nproceeded to verify and confirm the experiments which Mr. Fairbairn had\r\nmade, and afterwards reduced them to the required formula.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's time was so much engrossed with his extensive\r\nengineering business that he was in a great measure precluded from\r\ndevoting himself to the consideration of the practical details.  The\r\nresults of the experiments were communicated to him from time to time,\r\nand were regarded by him as exceedingly satisfactory.  It would appear,\r\nhowever, that while Mr. Fairbairn urged the rigidity and strength of the\r\ntubes without the aid of chains, Mr. Stephenson had not quite made up his\r\nmind upon the point.  Mr. Hodgkinson, also, was strongly inclined to\r\nretain them.  Mr. Fairbairn held that it was quite practicable to make\r\nthe tubes \"sufficiently strong to sustain not only their own weight, but,\r\nin addition to that load, 2000 tons equally distributed over the surface\r\nof the platform,--a load ten times greater than they will ever be called\r\nupon to support.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thoroughly characteristic of Mr. Stephenson, and of the caution\r\nwith which he proceeded in every step of this great undertaking--probing\r\nevery inch of the ground before he set down his foot upon it--that he\r\nshould, early in 1856, (_sic_) have appointed his able assistant, Mr.\r\nEdwin Clark, to scrutinise carefully the results of every experiment, and\r\nsubject them to a separate and independent analysis before finally\r\ndeciding upon the form or dimensions of the structure, or upon any mode\r\nof procedure connected with it.  At length Mr. Stephenson became\r\nsatisfied that the use of auxiliary chains was unnecessary, and that the\r\ntubular bridge might be made of such strength as to be entirely\r\nself-supporting.\r\n\r\nWhile these important discussions were in progress, measures were taken\r\nto proceed with the masonry of the bridges simultaneously at Conway and\r\nthe Menai Straits.  The foundation-stone of the Britannia Bridge was laid\r\non the 10th April, 1846; and on the 12th May following that of the Conway\r\nBridge was laid.  Suitable platforms and workshops were also erected for\r\nproceeding with the punching, fitting, and riveting of the tubes; and\r\nwhen these operations were in full progress, the neighbourhood of the\r\nConway and Britannia Bridges presented scenes of extraordinary bustle and\r\nindustry.  About 1500 men were employed on the Britannia Bridge alone,\r\nand they mostly lived upon the ground in wooden cottages erected for the\r\noccasion.  The iron plates were brought in ship-loads from Liverpool,\r\nAnglesey marble from Penmon, and red sandstone from Runcorn, in Cheshire,\r\nas wind and tide, and shipping and convenience, might determine.  There\r\nwas an unremitting clank of hammers, grinding of machinery, and blasting\r\nof rock, going on from morning till night.  In fitting the Britannia\r\ntubes together, not less than 2,000,000 of bolts were riveted, weighing\r\nsome 900 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Britannia Bridge consists of two independent continuous tubular\r\nbeams, each 1511 feet in length, and each weighing 4680 tons, independent\r\nof the cast-iron frames inserted at their bearings on the masonry of the\r\ntowers.  These immense beams are supported at five places, namely, on the\r\nabutments and on three towers, the central of which is known as the Great\r\nBritannia Tower, 230 feet high, built on a rock in the middle of the\r\nStrait.  The side towers are 18 feet less in height than the central one,\r\nand the abutment 35 feet lower than the side towers.  The design of the\r\nmasonry is such as to accord with the form of the tubes, being somewhat\r\nof an Egyptian character, massive and gigantic rather than beautiful, but\r\nbearing the unmistakable impress of power.\r\n\r\nThe bridge has four spans,--two of 460 feet over the water, and two of\r\n230 feet over the land.  The weight of the larger spans, at the points\r\nwhere the tubes repose on the masonry, is not less than 1587 tons.  On\r\nthe centre tower the tubes rest solid; but on the land towers and\r\nabutments they lie on roller-beds, so as to allow of expansion and\r\ncontraction.  The road within each tube is 15 feet wide, and the height\r\nvaries from 23 feet at the ends to 30 feet at the centre.  To give an\r\nidea of the vast size of the tubes by comparison with other structures,\r\nit may be mentioned that each length constituting the main spans is twice\r\nas long as London Monument is high; and if it could be set on end in St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, it would reach nearly 100 feet above the cross.\r\n\r\nThe Conway Bridge is, in most respects, similar to the Britannia,\r\nconsisting of two tubes, of 400 feet span, placed side by side, each\r\nweighing 1180 tons.  The principle adopted in the construction of the\r\ntubes, and the mode of floating and raising them, were nearly the same as\r\nat the Britannia Bridge, though the general arrangement of the plates is\r\nin many respects different.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to construct the shorter outer tubes of the Britannia\r\nBridge on scaffoldings in the positions in which they were permanently to\r\nremain, and to erect the larger tubes upon wooden platforms at\r\nhigh-water-mark on the Caernarvon shore, from whence they were to be\r\nfloated in pontoons.\r\n\r\nThe floating of the tubes on pontoons, from the places where they had\r\nbeen constructed, to the recesses in the masonry of the towers, up which\r\nthey were to be hoisted to the positions they were permanently to occupy,\r\nwas an anxious and exciting operation.  The first part of this process\r\nwas performed at Conway, where Mr. Stephenson directed it in person,\r\nassisted by Captain Claxton, Mr. Brunel, and other engineering friends.\r\nOn the 6th March, 1848, the pontoons bearing the first great tube of the\r\nup-line were floated round quietly and majestically into their place\r\nbetween the towers in about twenty minutes.  Unfortunately, one of the\r\nsets of pontoons had become slightly slued by the stream, by which the\r\nConway end of the tube was prevented from being brought home; and five\r\nanxious days to all concerned intervened before it could be set in its\r\nplace.  In the mean time, the presses and raising machinery had been\r\nfitted in the towers above, and the lifting process was begun on the 8th\r\nApril, when the immense mass was raised 8 feet, at the rate of about 2\r\ninches a minute.  On the 16th, the tube had been raised and finally\r\nlowered into its permanent bed; the rails were laid along it; and, on the\r\n18th, Mr. Stephenson passed through with the first locomotive.  The\r\nsecond tube was proceeded with on the removal of the first from the\r\nplatform, and was completed and floated in seven months.  The rapidity\r\nwith which this second tube was constructed was in no small degree owing\r\nto the Jacquard punching-machine, contrived for the purpose by Mr.\r\nRoberts of Manchester.  This tube was finally fixed in its permanent bed\r\non the 2nd of January, 1849.\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: Conway Tubular Bridge]\r\n\r\nThe floating and fixing of the great Britannia tubes was a still more\r\nformidable enterprise, though the experience gained at Conway rendered it\r\neasy compared with what it otherwise would have been.  Mr. Stephenson\r\nsuperintended the operation of floating the first in person, giving the\r\narranged signals from the top of the tube on which he was mounted, the\r\nactive part of the business being performed by a numerous corps of\r\nsailors, under the immediate direction of Captain Claxton.  Thousands of\r\nspectators lined the shores of the Strait on the evening of the 19th\r\nJune, 1849.  On the land attachments being cut, the pontoons began to\r\nfloat off; but one of the capstans having given way from excessive\r\nstrain, the tube was brought home again for the night.  By next morning\r\nthe defective capstan was restored, and all was in readiness for another\r\ntrial.  At half-past seven in the evening the tube was afloat, and the\r\npontoons swung out into the current like a monster pendulum, held steady\r\nby the shore guide-lines, but increasing in speed to almost a fearful\r\nextent as they neared their destined place between the piers.  \"The\r\nsuccess of this operation,\" says Mr. Clark, \"depended mainly on properly\r\nstriking the 'butt' beneath the Anglesey tower, on which, as upon a\r\ncentre, the tube was to be veered round into its position across the\r\nopening.  This position was determined by a 12-inch line, which was to be\r\npaid out to a fixed mark from the Llanfair capstan.  The coils of the\r\nrope unfortunately over-rode each other upon this capstan, so that it\r\ncould not be paid out.  In resisting the motion of the tube, the capstan\r\nwas bodily dragged out of the platform by the action of the palls, and\r\nthe tube was in imminent danger of being carried away by the stream, or\r\nthe pontoons crushed upon the rocks.  The men at the capstan were all\r\nknocked down, and some of them thrown into the water, though they made\r\nevery exertion to arrest the motion of the capstan-bars.  In this dilemma\r\nMr. Rolfe, who had charge of the capstan, with great presence of mind,\r\ncalled the visitors on shore to his assistance; and handing out the spare\r\ncoil of the 12-inch line into the field at the back of the capstan, it\r\nwas carried with great rapidity up the field, and a crowd of people, men,\r\nwomen, and children, holding on to this huge cable, arresting the\r\nprogress of the tube, which was at length brought safely against the butt\r\nand veered round.  The Britannia end was then drawn into the recess of\r\nthe masonry by a chain passing through the tower to a crab on the far\r\nside.  The violence of the tide abated, though the wind increased, and\r\nthe Anglesey end was drawn into its place beneath the corbelling in the\r\nmasonry; and as the tide went down, the pontoons deposited their valuable\r\ncargo on the welcome shelf at each end.  The successful issue was greeted\r\nby cannon from the shore and the hearty cheers of many thousands of\r\nspectators, whose sympathy and anxiety were but too clearly indicated by\r\nthe unbroken silence with which the whole operation had been\r\naccompanied.\" {335}  By midnight all the pontoons had been got clear of\r\nthe tube, which now hung suspended over the waters of the Strait by its\r\ntwo ends, which rested upon the edges cut in the rock for the purpose at\r\nthe base of the Britannia and Anglesey towers respectively, up which the\r\ntube had now to be lifted by hydraulic power to its permanent place near\r\nthe summit.  The accuracy with which the gigantic beam had been\r\nconstructed may be inferred from the fact that, after passing into its\r\nplace, a clear space remained between the iron plating and the rock\r\noutside of it of only about three-quarters of an inch!\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's anxiety was, of course, very great up to the time of\r\nperforming this trying operation.  When he had got the first tube floated\r\nat Conway, and saw all safe, he said to Captain Moorsom, \"Now I shall go\r\nto bed.\"  But the Britannia Bridge was a still more difficult enterprise,\r\nand cost him many a sleepless night.  Afterwards describing his feelings\r\nto his friend Mr. Gooch, he said: \"It was a most anxious and harassing\r\ntime with me.  Often at night I would lie tossing about, seeking sleep in\r\nvain.  The tubes filled my head.  I went to bed with them and got up with\r\nthem.  In the grey of the morning, when I looked across the Square, {336}\r\nit seemed an immense distance across to the houses on the opposite side.\r\nIt was nearly the same length as the span of my tubular bridge!\"  When\r\nthe first tube had been floated, a friend observed to him, \"This great\r\nwork has made you ten years older.\"  \"I have not slept sound,\" he\r\nreplied, \"for three weeks.\"  Sir F. Head, however relates, that when he\r\nrevisited the spot on the following morning, he observed, sitting on a\r\nplatform overlooking the suspended tube, a gentleman, reclining entirely\r\nby himself, smoking a cigar, and gazing, as if indolently, at the aerial\r\ngallery beneath him.  It was the engineer himself, contemplating his new\r\nborn child.  He had strolled down from the neighbouring village, after\r\nhis first sound and refreshing sleep for weeks, to behold in sunshine and\r\nsolitude, that which during a weary period of gestation had been either\r\nmysteriously moving in his brain, or, like a vision--sometimes of good\r\nomen, and sometimes of evil--had, by night as well as by day, been\r\nflitting across his mind.\r\n\r\nThe next process was the lifting of the tube into its place, which was\r\nperformed very deliberately and cautiously.  It was raised by powerful\r\nhydraulic presses, only a few feet at a time, and carefully under-built,\r\nbefore being raised to a farther height.  When it had been got up by\r\nsuccessive stages of this kind to about 24 feet, an extraordinary\r\naccident occurred, during Mr. Stephenson's absence in London, which he\r\nafterwards described to the author in as nearly as possible the following\r\nwords:--\"In a work of such novelty and magnitude, you may readily imagine\r\nhow anxious I was that every possible contingency should be provided for.\r\nWhere one chain or rope was required, I provided two.  I was not\r\nsatisfied with 'enough:' I must have absolute security, as far as that\r\nwas possible.  I knew the consequences of failure would be most\r\ndisastrous to the Company, and that the wisest economy was to provide for\r\nall contingencies at whatever cost.  When the first tube at the Britannia\r\nhad been successfully floated between the piers, ready for being raised,\r\nmy young engineers were very much elated; and when the hoisting apparatus\r\nhad been fixed, they wrote to me saying,--'We are now all ready for\r\nraising her: we could do it in a day, or in two at the most.  But my\r\nreply was, 'No: you must only raise the tube inch by inch, and you must\r\nbuild up under it as you rise.  Every inch must be made good.  Nothing\r\nmust be left to chance or good luck.'  And fortunate it was that I\r\ninsisted upon this cautious course being pursued; for, one day, while the\r\nhydraulic presses were at work, the bottom of one of them burst clean\r\naway!  The crosshead and the chains, weighing more than 50 tons,\r\ndescended with a fearful crash upon the press, and the tube itself fell\r\ndown upon the packing beneath.  Though the fall of the tube was not more\r\nthan nine inches, it crushed solid castings, weighing tons, as if they\r\nhad been nuts.  The tube itself was slightly strained and deflected,\r\nthough it still remained sufficiently serviceable.  But it was a\r\ntremendous test to which it was put, for a weight of upwards of 5000 tons\r\nfalling even a few inches must be admitted to be a very serious matter.\r\nThat it stood so well was extraordinary.  Clark immediately wrote me an\r\naccount of the circumstance, in which he said, 'Thank God, you have been\r\nso obstinate.  For if this accident had occurred without a bed for the\r\nend of the tube to fall on, the whole would now have been lying across\r\nthe bottom of the Straits.'  Five thousand pounds extra expense was\r\ncaused by this accident, slight though it might seem.  But careful\r\nprovision was made against future failure; a new and improved cylinder\r\nwas provided: and the work was very soon advancing satisfactorily towards\r\ncompletion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen first visited the Britannia Bridge, on her return from the\r\nNorth in 1852, Robert Stephenson accompanied Her Majesty and Prince\r\nAlbert over the works, explaining the principles on which the bridge had\r\nbeen built, and the difficulties which had attended its erection.  He\r\nconducted the Royal party to near the margin of the sea, and, after\r\ndescribing to them the incident of the fall of the tube, and the reason\r\nof its preservation, he pointed with pardonable pride to a pile of stones\r\nwhich the workmen had there raised to commemorate the event.  While\r\nnearly all the other marks of the work during its progress had been\r\nobliterated, that cairn had been left standing in commemoration of the\r\ncaution and foresight of their chief.\r\n\r\nThe floating and raising of the remaining tubes need not be described in\r\ndetail.  The second was floated on the 3rd December, and set in its\r\npermanent place on the 7th January, 1850.  The others were floated and\r\nraised in due course.  On the 5th March, Mr. Stephenson put the last\r\nrivet in the last tube, and passed through the completed bridge,\r\naccompanied by about a thousand persons, drawn by three locomotives.  The\r\nbridge was opened for public traffic on the 18th March.  The cost of the\r\nwhole work was 234,450 pounds.\r\n\r\n         [Picture: The Britannia Bridge.  (By Percival Skelton)]\r\n\r\nThe Britannia Bridge is one of the most remarkable monuments of the\r\nenterprise and skill of the present century.  Robert Stephenson was the\r\nmaster spirit of the undertaking.  To him belongs the merit of first\r\nseizing the ideal conception of the structure best adapted to meet the\r\nnecessities of the case; and of selecting the best men to work out his\r\nidea, himself watching, controlling, and testing every result, by\r\nindependent check and counter-check.  And finally, he organised and\r\ndirected, through his assistants, the vast band of skilled workmen and\r\nlabourers who were for so many years occupied in carrying his magnificent\r\noriginal conception to a successful practical issue.  As he himself said\r\nof the work,--\"The true and accurate calculation of all the conditions\r\nand elements essential to the safety of the bridge had been a source not\r\nonly of mental but of bodily toil; including, as it did, a combination of\r\nabstract thought and well-considered experiment adequate to the magnitude\r\nof the project.\"\r\n\r\nThe Britannia Bridge was the result of a vast combination of skill and\r\nindustry.  But for the perfection of our tools and the ability of our\r\nmechanics to use them to the greatest advantage; but for the matured\r\npowers of the steam-engine; but for the improvements in the iron\r\nmanufacture, which enabled blooms to be puddled of sizes before deemed\r\nimpracticable, and plates and bars of immense size to be rolled and\r\nforged; but for these, the Britannia Bridge would have been designed in\r\nvain.  Thus, it was not the product of the genius of the railway engineer\r\nalone, but of the collective mechanical genius of the English nation.\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Conway Bridge.--Floating the First Tube]\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: View in Tapton Gardens]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nGEORGE STEPHENSON'S CLOSING YEARS--ILLNESS AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing the completion of the series of great works detailed in the\r\npreceding chapter, we have somewhat anticipated the closing years of\r\nGeorge Stephenson's life.  He could not fail to take an anxious interest\r\nin the success of his son's designs, and he accordingly paid many visits\r\nto Conway and to Menai, during the progress of the works.  He was present\r\non the occasion of the floating and raising of the first Conway tube, and\r\nthere witnessed a clear proof of the soundness of Robert's judgment as to\r\nthe efficiency and strength of the tubular bridge, of which he had at\r\nfirst expressed some doubts; but before the like test could be applied at\r\nthe Britannia Bridge, George Stephenson's mortal anxieties were at an\r\nend, for he had then ceased from all his labours.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of his life, George Stephenson almost entirely withdrew\r\nfrom the active pursuit of his profession; he devoted himself chiefly to\r\nhis extensive collieries and lime-works, taking a local interest only in\r\nsuch projected railways as were calculated to open up new markets for\r\ntheir products.\r\n\r\nAt home he lived the life of a country gentleman, enjoying his garden and\r\ngrounds, and indulging his love of nature, which, through all his busy\r\nlife, had never left him.  It was not until the year 1845 that he took an\r\nactive interest in horticultural pursuits.  Then he began to build new\r\nmelon-houses, pineries, and vineries, of great extent; and he now seemed\r\nas eager to excel all other growers of exotic plants in his\r\nneighbourhood, as he had been to surpass the villagers of Killingworth in\r\nthe production of gigantic cabbages and cauliflowers some thirty years\r\nbefore.  He had a pine-house built 68 feet in length and a pinery 140\r\nfeet.  Workmen were constantly employed in enlarging them, until at\r\nlength he had no fewer than ten glass forcing-houses, heated with hot\r\nwater, which he was one of the first in that neighbourhood to make use of\r\nfor such a purpose.  He did not take so much pleasure in flowers as in\r\nfruits.  At one of the county agricultural meetings, he said that he\r\nintended yet to grow pineapples at Tapton as big as pumpkins.  The only\r\nman to whom he would \"knock under\" was his friend Paxton, the gardener to\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire; and he was so old in the service, and so skilful,\r\nthat he could scarcely hope to beat him.  Yet his \"Queen\" pines did take\r\nthe first prize at a competition with the Duke,--though this was not\r\nuntil shortly after his death, when the plants had become more fully\r\ngrown.  His grapes also took the first prize at Rotherham, at a\r\ncompetition open to all England.  He was extremely successful in\r\nproducing melons, having invented a method of suspending them in baskets\r\nof wire gauze, which, by relieving the stalk from tension, allowed\r\nnutrition to proceed more freely, and better enabled the fruit to grow\r\nand ripen.\r\n\r\nHe took much pride also in his growth of cucumbers.  He raised them very\r\nfine and large, but he could not make them grow straight.  Place them as\r\nhe would, notwithstanding all his propping of them, and humouring them by\r\nmodifying the application of heat and the admission of light for the\r\npurpose of effecting his object, they would still insist on growing\r\ncrooked in their own way.  At last he had a number of glass cylinders\r\nmade at Newcastle, for the purpose of an experiment; into these the\r\ngrowing cucumbers were inserted, and then he succeeded in growing them\r\nperfectly straight.  Carrying one of the new products into his house one\r\nday, and exhibiting it to a party of visitors, he told them of the\r\nexpedient he had adopted, and added gleefully, \"I think I have bothered\r\nthem noo!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson also carried on farming operations with some success.  He\r\nexperimented on manure, and fed cattle after methods of his own.  He was\r\nvery particular as to breed and build in stock-breeding.  \"You see, sir,\"\r\nhe said to one gentleman, \"I like to see the _coo's_ back at a gradient\r\nsomething like this\" (drawing an imaginary line with his hand), \"and then\r\nthe ribs or girders will carry more flesh than if they were so--or so.\"\r\nWhen he attended the county agricultural meetings, which he frequently\r\ndid, he was accustomed to take part in the discussions, and he brought\r\nthe same vigorous practical mind to bear upon questions of tillage,\r\ndrainage, and farm economy, which he had been accustomed to exercise on\r\nmechanical and engineering matters.\r\n\r\nAll his early affection for birds and animals revived.  He had favourite\r\ndogs, and cows, and horses; and again he began to keep rabbits, and to\r\npride himself on the beauty of his breed.  There was not a bird's nest\r\nupon the grounds that he did not know of; and from day to day he went\r\nround watching the progress which the birds made with their building,\r\ncarefully guarding them from injury.  No one was more minutely acquainted\r\nwith the habits of British birds, the result of a long, loving, and close\r\nobservation of nature.\r\n\r\nAt Tapton he remembered the failure of his early experiment in hatching\r\nbirds' eggs by heat, and he now performed it successfully, being able to\r\nsecure a proper apparatus for maintaining a uniform temperature.  He was\r\nalso curious about the breeding and fattening of fowls; and when his\r\nfriend Edward Pease of Darlington visited him at Tapton, he explained a\r\nmethod which he had invented for fattening chickens in half the usual\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stephenson tried to keep bees, but found they would not thrive at\r\nTapton.  Many hives perished, and there was no case of success.  The\r\ncause of failure was a puzzle to the engineer; but one day his acute\r\npowers of observation enabled him to unravel it.  At the foot of the hill\r\non which Tapton House stands, he saw some bees trying to rise up from\r\namongst the grass, laden with honey and wax.  They were already\r\nexhausted, as if with long flying; and then it occurred to him that the\r\nheight at which the house stood above the bees' feeding-ground rendered\r\nit difficult for them to reach their hives when heavy laden, and hence\r\nthey sank exhausted.  He afterwards incidentally mentioned the\r\ncircumstance to Mr. Jesse the naturalist, who concurred in his view as to\r\nthe cause of failure, and was much struck by the keen observation which\r\nhad led to its solution.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson had none of the in-door habits of the student.  He read\r\nvery little; for reading is a habit which is generally acquired in youth;\r\nand his youth and manhood had been for the most part spent in hard work.\r\nBooks wearied him, and sent him to sleep.  Novels excited his feelings\r\ntoo much, and he avoided them, though he would occasionally read through\r\na philosophical book on a subject in which he felt particularly\r\ninterested.  He wrote very few letters with his own hand; nearly all his\r\nletters were dictated, and he avoided even dictation when he could.  His\r\ngreatest pleasure was in conversation, from which he gathered most of his\r\nimparted information.\r\n\r\nIt was his practice, when about to set out on a journey by railway, to\r\nwalk along the train before it started, and look into the carriages to\r\nsee if he could find \"a conversable face.\"  On one of these occasions, at\r\nthe Euston Station, he discovered in a carriage a very handsome, manly,\r\nand intelligent face, which he afterwards found was that of the late Lord\r\nDenman.  He was on his way down to his seat at Stony Middleton, in\r\nDerbyshire.  Mr. Stephenson entered the carriage, and the two were\r\nshortly engaged in interesting conversation.  It turned upon chronometry\r\nand horology, and the engineer amazed his lordship by the extent of his\r\nknowledge on the subject, in which he displayed as much minute\r\ninformation, even down to the latest improvements in watchmaking, as if\r\nhe had been bred a watchmaker and lived by the trade.  Lord Denman was\r\ncurious to know how a man whose time must have been mainly engrossed by\r\nengineering, had gathered so much knowledge on a subject quite out of his\r\nown line, and he asked the question.  \"I learnt clockmaking and\r\nwatchmaking,\" was the answer, \"while a working man at Killingworth, when\r\nI made a little money in my spare hours, by cleaning the pitmen's clocks\r\nand watches; and since then I have kept up my information on the\r\nsubject.\"  This led to further questions, and then Mr. Stephenson told\r\nLord Denman the interesting story of his life, which held him entranced\r\nduring the remainder of the journey.\r\n\r\nMany of his friends readily accepted invitations to Tapton House to enjoy\r\nhis hospitality, which never failed.  With them he would \"fight his\r\nbattles o'er again,\" reverting to his battle for the locomotive; and he\r\nwas never tired of telling, nor were his auditors of listening to, the\r\nlively anecdotes with which he was accustomed to illustrate the struggles\r\nof his early career.  Whilst walking in the woods or through the grounds,\r\nhe would arrest his friend's attention by allusion to some simple\r\nobject,--such as a leaf, a blade of grass, a bit of bark, a nest of\r\nbirds, or an ant carrying its eggs across the path,--and descant in\r\nglowing terms upon the creative power of the Divine Mechanician, whose\r\ncontrivances were so exhaustless and so wonderful.  This was a theme upon\r\nwhich he was often accustomed to dwell in reverential admiration, when in\r\nthe society of his more intimate friends.\r\n\r\nOne night, when walking under the stars, and gazing up into the field of\r\nsuns, each the probable centre of a system, forming the Milky Way, a\r\nfriend said to him, \"What an insignificant creature is man in sight of so\r\nimmense a creation as that!\"  \"Yes!\" was his reply; \"but how wonderful a\r\ncreature also is man, to be able to think and reason, and even in some\r\nmeasure to comprehend works so infinite!\"\r\n\r\nA microscope, which he had brought down to Tapton, was a source of\r\nimmense enjoyment to him; and he was never tired of contemplating the\r\nminute wonders which it revealed.  One evening, when some friends were\r\nvisiting him, he induced them each to puncture their skin so as to draw\r\nblood, in order that he might examine the globules through the\r\nmicroscope.  One of the gentlemen present was a teetotaller, and Mr.\r\nStephenson pronounced his blood to be the most lively of the whole.  He\r\nhad a theory of his own about the movement of the globules in the blood,\r\nwhich has since become familiar.  It was, that they were respectively\r\ncharged with electricity, positive at one end and negative at the other,\r\nand that thus they attracted and repelled each other, causing a\r\ncirculation.  No sooner did he observe anything new, than he immediately\r\nset about devising a reason for it.  His training in mechanics, his\r\npractical familiarity with matter in all its forms, and the strong bent\r\nof his mind, led him first of all to seek for a mechanical explanation.\r\nAnd yet he was ready to admit that there was a something in the principle\r\nof _life_--so mysterious and inexplicable--which baffled mechanics, and\r\nseemed to dominate over and control them.  He did not care much, either,\r\nfor abstruse mechanics, but only for the experimental and practical, as\r\nis usually the case with those whose knowledge has been self-acquired.\r\n\r\nEven at his advanced age, the spirit of frolic had not left him.  When\r\nproceeding from Chesterfield station to Tapton House with his friends, he\r\nwould almost invariably challenge them to a race up the steep path,\r\npartly formed of stone steps, along the hill side.  And he would\r\nstruggle, as of old, to keep the front place, though by this time his\r\n\"wind\" had greatly failed.  He would occasionally invite an old friend to\r\ntake a quiet wrestle with him on the lawn, to keep up his skill, and\r\nperhaps to try some new \"knack\" of throwing.  In the evening, he would\r\nsometimes indulge his visitors by reciting the old pastoral of \"Damon and\r\nPhyllis,\" or singing his favourite song of \"John Anderson my Joe.\"  But\r\nhis greatest glory amongst those with whom he was most intimate, was a\r\n\"crowdie!\"  \"Let's have a crowdie night,\" he would say; and forthwith a\r\nkettle of boiling water was ordered in, with a basin of oatmeal.  Taking\r\na large bowl, containing a sufficiency of hot water, and placing it\r\nbetween his knees, he poured in oatmeal with one hand, and stirred the\r\nmixture vigorously with the other.  When enough meal had been added, and\r\nthe stirring was completed, the crowdie was made.  It was then supped\r\nwith new milk, and Stephenson generally pronounced it \"capital!\"  It was\r\nthe diet to which he had been accustomed when a working man, and all the\r\ndainties with which he had become familiar in recent years had not\r\nspoiled his simple tastes.  To enjoy crowdie at his age, besides,\r\nindicated that he still possessed that quality on which no doubt much of\r\nhis practical success in life had depended,--a strong and healthy\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nHe would also frequently invite to his house the humbler companions of\r\nhis early life, and take pleasure in talking over old times with them.\r\nHe never assumed any of the bearings of a great man on such occasions,\r\nbut treated the visitors with the same friendliness and respect as if\r\nthey had been his equals, sending them away pleased with themselves and\r\ndelighted with him.  At other times, needy men who had known him in youth\r\nwould knock at his door, and they were never refused access.  But if he\r\nhad heard of any misconduct on their part he would rate them soundly.\r\nOne who knew him intimately in private life has seen him exhorting such\r\nbacksliders, and denouncing their misconduct and imprudence with the\r\ntears streaming down his cheeks.  And he would generally conclude by\r\nopening his purse, and giving them the help which they needed \"to make a\r\nfresh start in the world.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's life at Tapton during his latter years was occasionally\r\ndiversified with a visit to London.  His engineering business having\r\nbecome limited, he generally went there for the purpose of visiting\r\nfriends, or \"to see what there was fresh going on.\"  He found a new race\r\nof engineers springing up on all hands--men who knew him not; and his\r\nLondon journeys gradually ceased to yield him pleasure.  A friend used to\r\ntake him to the opera, but by the end of the first act, he was generally\r\nin a profound slumber.  Yet on one occasion he enjoyed a visit to the\r\nHaymarket with a party of friends on his birthday, to see T. P. Cooke, in\r\n\"Black-eyed Susan;\"--if that can be called enjoyment which kept him in a\r\nstate of tears during half the performance.  At other times he visited\r\nNewcastle, which always gave him great pleasure.  He would, on such\r\noccasions, go out to Killingworth and seek up old friends, and if the\r\npeople whom he knew were too retiring, and shrunk into their cottages, he\r\nwent and sought them there.  Striking the floor with his stick, and\r\nholding his noble person upright, he would say, in his own kind way,\r\n\"Well, and how's all here to-day?\"  To the last he had always a warm\r\nheart for Newcastle and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, on more than one occasion, invited George Stephenson to\r\nhis mansion at Drayton, where he was accustomed to assemble round him men\r\nof the highest distinction in art, science, and legislation, during the\r\nintervals of his parliamentary life.  The first invitation was\r\nrespectfully declined.  Sir Robert invited him a second time, and a\r\nsecond time he declined: \"I have no great ambition,\" he said, \"to mix in\r\nfine company, and perhaps should feel out of my element amongst such high\r\nfolks.\"  But Sir Robert a third time pressed him to come down to Tamworth\r\nearly in January, 1845, when he would meet Buckland, Follett, and others\r\nwell known to both.  \"Well, Sir Robert,\" said he, \"I feel your kindness\r\nvery much, and can no longer refuse: I will come down and join your\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's strong powers of observation, together with his native\r\nhumour and shrewdness, imparted to his conversation at all times much\r\nvigour and originality, and made him, to young and old, a delightful\r\ncompanion.  Though mainly an engineer, he was also a profound thinker on\r\nmany scientific questions: and there was scarcely a subject of\r\nspeculation, or a department of recondite science, on which he had not\r\nemployed his faculties in such a way as to have formed large and original\r\nviews.  At Drayton, the conversation usually turned upon such topics, and\r\nMr. Stephenson freely joined in it.  On one occasion, an animated\r\ndiscussion took place between himself and Dr. Buckland on one of his\r\nfavourite theories as to the formation of coal.  But the result was, that\r\nDr. Buckland, a much greater master of tongue-fence than Mr. Stephenson,\r\ncompletely silenced him.  Next morning, before breakfast, when he was\r\nwalking in the grounds, deeply pondering, Sir William Follett came up and\r\nasked what he was thinking about?  \"Why, Sir William, I am thinking over\r\nthat argument I had with Buckland last night; I know I am right, and that\r\nif I had only the command of words which he has, I'd have beaten him.\"\r\n\"Let me know all about it,\" said Sir William, \"and I'll see what I can do\r\nfor you.\"  The two sat down in an arbour, and the astute lawyer made\r\nhimself thoroughly acquainted with the points of the case; entering into\r\nit with all the zeal of an advocate about to plead the dearest interests\r\nof his client.  After he had mastered the subject, Sir William rose up,\r\nrubbing his hands with glee, and said, \"Now I am ready for him.\"  Sir\r\nRobert Peel was made acquainted with the plot, and adroitly introduced\r\nthe subject of the controversy after dinner.  The result was, that in the\r\nargument which followed, the man of science was overcome by the man of\r\nlaw; and Sir William Follett had at all points the mastery over Dr.\r\nBuckland.  \"What do _you_ say, Mr. Stephenson?\" asked Sir Robert,\r\nlaughing.  \"Why,\" said he, \"I will only say this, that of all the powers\r\nabove and under the earth, there seems to me to be no power so great as\r\nthe gift of the gab.\" {350}\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, when the party had just returned from church, they were\r\nstanding together on the terrace near the Hall, and observed in the\r\ndistance a railway-train flashing along, tossing behind its long white\r\nplume of steam.  \"Now, Buckland,\" said Stephenson, \"I have a poser for\r\nyou.  Can you tell me what is the power that is driving that train?\"\r\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"I suppose it is one of your big engines.\"  \"But\r\nwhat drives the engine?\"  \"Oh, very likely a canny Newcastle driver.\"\r\n\"What do you say to the light of the sun?\"  \"How can that be?\" asked the\r\ndoctor.  \"It is nothing else,\" said the engineer, \"it is light bottled up\r\nin the earth for tens of thousands of years,--light, absorbed by plants\r\nand vegetables, being necessary for the condensation of carbon during the\r\nprocess of their growth, if it be not carbon in another form,--and now,\r\nafter being buried in the earth for long ages in fields of coal, that\r\nlatent light is again brought forth and liberated, made to work as in\r\nthat locomotive, for great human purposes.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the same visit, Mr. Stephenson, one evening repeated his\r\nexperiment with blood drawn from the finger, submitting it to the\r\nmicroscope in order to show the curious circulation of the globules.  He\r\nset the example by pricking his own thumb; and the other guests, by\r\nturns, in like manner, gave up a small portion of their blood for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the comparative livelinesss of their circulation.\r\nWhen Sir Robert Peel's turn came, Mr. Stephenson said he was curious to\r\nknow \"how the blood globules of a great politician would conduct\r\nthemselves.\"  Sir Robert held forth his finger for the purpose of being\r\npricked; but once, and again, he sensitively shrunk back, and at length\r\nthe experiment, so far as he was concerned, was abandoned.  Sir Robert\r\nPeel's sensitiveness to pain was extreme, and yet he was destined, a few\r\nyears after, to die a death of the most distressing agony.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, the year before his death, Mr. Stephenson was again invited to\r\njoin a distinguished party at Drayton Manor, and to assist in the\r\nceremony of formally opening the Trent Valley Railway, which had been\r\noriginally designed and laid out by himself many years before.  The first\r\nsod of the railway had been cut by the Prime Minister, in November, 1845,\r\nduring the time when Mr. Stephenson was abroad on the business of the\r\nSpanish railway.  The formal opening took place on the 26th June, 1847,\r\nthe line having thus been constructed in less than two years.\r\n\r\nWhat a change had come over the spirit of the landed gentry since the\r\ntime when George Stephenson had first projected a railway through that\r\ndistrict!  Then they were up in arms against him, characterising him as\r\nthe devastator and spoiler of their estates; now he was hailed as one of\r\nthe greatest benefactors of the age.  Sir Robert Peel, the chief\r\npolitical personage in England, welcomed him as a guest and friend, and\r\nspoke of him as the chief among practical philosophers.  A dozen members\r\nof Parliament, seven baronets, with all the landed magnates of the\r\ndistrict, assembled to celebrate the opening of the railway.  The clergy\r\nwere there to bless the enterprise, and to bid all hail to railway\r\nprogress, as \"enabling them to carry on with greater facility those\r\noperations in connexion with religion which were calculated to be so\r\nbeneficial to the country.\"  The army, speaking through the mouth of\r\nGeneral A'Court, acknowledged the vast importance of railways, as tending\r\nto improve the military defences of the country.  And representatives\r\nfrom eight corporations were there to acknowledge the great benefits\r\nwhich railways had conferred upon the merchants, tradesmen, and working\r\nclasses of their respective towns and cities.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848 Mr. Stephenson was invited to Whittington House,\r\nnear Chesterfield, the residence of his friend and former pupil, Mr.\r\nSwanwick, to meet the distinguished American, Emerson.  Upon being\r\nintroduced, they did not immediately engage in conversation; but\r\npresently Stephenson jumped up, took Emerson by the collar, and giving\r\nhim one of his friendly shakes, asked how it was that in England we could\r\nalways tell an American?  This led to an interesting conversation, in the\r\ncourse of which Emerson said how much he had been everywhere struck by\r\nthe haleness and comeliness of the English men and women; and then they\r\ndiverged into a further discussion of the influences which air, climate,\r\nmoisture, soil, and other conditions exercised upon the physical and\r\nmoral development of a people.  The conversation was next directed to the\r\nsubject of electricity, upon which Stephenson launched out\r\nenthusiastically, explaining his views by several simple and striking\r\nillustrations.  From thence it gradually turned to the events of his own\r\nlife, which he related in so graphic a manner as completely to rivet the\r\nattention of the American.  Afterwards Emerson said, \"that it was worth\r\ncrossing the Atlantic to have seen Stephenson alone; he had such native\r\nforce of character and vigour of intellect.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of Mr. Stephenson's days were spent quietly at Tapton, amongst\r\nhis dogs, his rabbits, and his birds.  When not engaged about the works\r\nconnected with his collieries, he was occupied in horticulture and\r\nfarming.  He continued proud of his flowers, his fruits, and his crops;\r\nand the old spirit of competition was still strong within him.  Although\r\nhe had for some time been in delicate health, and his hand shook from\r\nnervous affection, he appeared to possess a sound constitution.  Emerson\r\nhad observed of him that he had the lives of many men in him.  But\r\nperhaps the American spoke figuratively, in reference to his vast stores\r\nof experience.  It appeared that he had never completely recovered from\r\nthe attack of pleurisy which seized him during his return from Spain.  As\r\nlate, however, as the 26th July, 1848, he felt himself sufficiently well\r\nto be able to attend a meeting of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers\r\nat Birmingham, and to read to the members his paper \"On the Fallacies of\r\nthe Rotatory Engine.\"  It was his last appearance before them.  Shortly\r\nafter his return to Tapton, he had an attack of intermittent fever, from\r\nwhich he seemed to be recovering, when a sudden effusion of blood from\r\nthe lungs carried him off, on the 12th August, 1848, in the sixty-seventh\r\nyear of his age.  When all was over, Robert wrote to Edward Pease, \"With\r\ndeep pain I inform you, as one of his oldest friends, of the death of my\r\ndear father this morning at 12 o'clock, after about ten days' illness\r\nfrom severe fever.\"  Mr. Starbuck, who was also present, wrote, \"The\r\nfavourable symptoms of yesterday morning were towards evening followed by\r\na serious change for the worse.  This continued during the night, and\r\nearly this morning it became evident that he was sinking.  At a few\r\nminutes before 12 to-day he breathed his last.  All that the most devoted\r\nand unremitting care of Mrs. Stephenson {354} and the skill of medicine\r\ncould accomplish, has been done, but in vain.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson's remains were followed to the grave by a large body of\r\nhis workpeople, by whom he was greatly admired and beloved.  They\r\nremembered him as a kind master, who was ever ready actively to promote\r\nall measures for their moral, physical, and mental improvement.  The\r\ninhabitants of Chesterfield evinced their respect for the deceased by\r\nsuspending business, closing their shops, and joining in the funeral\r\nprocession, which was headed by the corporation of the town.  Many of the\r\nsurrounding gentry also attended.  The body was interred in Trinity\r\nChurch, Chesterfield, where a simple tablet marks the great engineer's\r\nlast resting-place.\r\n\r\nThe statue of George Stephenson, which the Liverpool and Manchester and\r\nGrand Junction Companies had commissioned, was on its way to England when\r\nhis death occurred; and it served for a monument, though his best\r\nmonument will always be his works.  The statue referred to was placed in\r\nSt. George's Hall, Liverpool.  A full-length statue of him, by Bailey,\r\nwas also erected a few years later, in the noble vestibule of the London\r\nand North-Western Station, in Euston Square.  A subscription for the\r\npurpose was set on foot by the Society of Mechanical Engineers, of which\r\nhe had been the founder and president.  A few advertisements were\r\ninserted in the newspapers, inviting subscriptions; and it is a notable\r\nfact that the voluntary offerings included an average of two shillings\r\neach from 3150 working men, who embraced this opportunity of doing honour\r\nto their distinguished fellow workman.\r\n\r\n                 [Picture: Trinity Church, Chesterfield]\r\n\r\nBut unquestionably the finest and most appropriate statue to the memory\r\nof George Stephenson is that erected in 1862, after the design of John\r\nLough, at Newcastle-upon Tyne.  It is in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe Literary and Philosophical Institute, to which both George and his\r\nson Robert were so much indebted in their early years; close to the great\r\nStephenson locomotive foundry established by the shrewdness of the\r\nfather; and in the vicinity of the High Level Bridge, one of the grandest\r\nproducts of the genius of the son.  The head of Stephenson, as expressed\r\nin this noble work, is massive, characteristic, and faithful; and the\r\nattitude of the figure is simple yet manly and energetic.  It stands on a\r\npedestal, at the respective corners of which are sculptured the recumbent\r\nfigures of a pitman, a mechanic, an engine-driver, and a plate-layer.\r\nThe statue appropriately stands in a very thoroughfare of working-men,\r\nthousands of whom see it daily as they pass to and from their work; and\r\nwe can imagine them, as they look up to Stephenson's manly figure,\r\napplying to it the words addressed by Robert Nicoll to Robert Burns, with\r\nperhaps still greater appropriateness:--\r\n\r\n    \"Before the proudest of the earth\r\n       We stand, with an uplifted brow;\r\n    Like us, thou wast a toiling man,--\r\n       And we are noble, now!\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait prefixed to this volume gives a good indication of George\r\nStephenson's shrewd, kind, honest, manly face.  His fair, clear\r\ncountenance was ruddy, and seemingly glowed with health.  The forehead\r\nwas large and high, projecting over the eyes, and there was that massive\r\nbreadth across the lower part which is usually observed in men of eminent\r\nconstructive skill.  The mouth was firmly marked, and shrewdness and\r\nhumour lurked there as well as in the keen grey eye.  His frame was\r\ncompact, well-knit, and rather spare.  His hair became grey at an early\r\nage, and towards the close of his life it was of a pure silky whiteness.\r\nHe dressed neatly in black, wearing a white neckcloth; and his face, his\r\nperson, and his deportment at once arrested attention, and marked the\r\nGentleman.\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Tablet in Trinity Church, Chesterfield]\r\n\r\n                   [Picture: Victoria Bridge, Montreal]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nROBERT STEPHENSON'S VICTORIA BRIDGE, LOWER CANADA--ILLNESS AND\r\nDEATH--STEPHENSON CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson bequeathed to his son his valuable collieries, his\r\nshare in the engine manufactory at Newcastle, and his large accumulation\r\nof savings, which, together with the fortune he had himself amassed by\r\nrailway work, gave Robert the position of an engineer millionaire--the\r\nfirst of his order.  He continued, however, to live in a quiet style; and\r\nalthough he bought occasional pictures and statues, and indulged in the\r\nluxury of a yacht, he did not live up to his income, which went on\r\nrapidly accumulating until his death.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer the necessity for applying himself to the laborious\r\nbusiness of a parliamentary engineer, in which he had now been occupied\r\nfor some fifteen years.  Shortly after his father's death, Edward Pease\r\nstrongly recommended him to give up the more harassing work of his\r\nprofession; and his reply (15th June, 1850) was as follows:--\"The\r\nsuggestion which your kind note contains is quite in accordance with my\r\nown feelings and intentions respecting retirement; but I find it a very\r\ndifficult matter to bring to a close so complicated a connexion in\r\nbusiness as that which has been established by twenty-five years of\r\nactive and arduous professional duty.  Comparative retirement is,\r\nhowever, my intention; and I trust that your prayer for the Divine\r\nblessing to grant me happiness and quiet comfort will be fulfilled.  I\r\ncannot but feel deeply grateful to the Great Disposer of events for the\r\nsuccess which has hitherto attended my exertions in life; and I trust\r\nthat the future will also be marked by a continuance of His mercies.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Robert Stephenson, in conformity with this expressed intention,\r\nfor the most part declined to undertake new business, he did not\r\naltogether lay aside his harness; and he lived to repeat his tubular\r\nbridges both in Lower Canada and in Egypt.  The success of the tubular\r\nsystem, as adopted at Menai and Conway, was such as to recommend it for\r\nadoption wherever great span was required; and the peculiar circumstances\r\nconnected with the navigation of the St. Lawrence and the Nile, may be\r\nsaid to have compelled its adoption in carrying railways across those\r\ngreat rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria Bridge, of which Robert Stephenson was the designer and\r\nchief engineer, is, without exception, the greatest work of the kind in\r\nthe world.  For gigantic proportions and vast length and strength there\r\nis nothing to compare with it in ancient or modern times.  The entire\r\nbridge, with its approaches, is only about sixty yards short of _two\r\nmiles_, being five times longer than the Britannia across the Menai\r\nStraits, seven and a half times longer than Waterloo Bridge, and more\r\nthan ten times longer than the new Chelsea Bridge across the Thames!  It\r\nhas not less than twenty-four spans of 242 feet each, and one great\r\ncentral span--itself an immense bridge--of 330 feet.  The road is carried\r\nwithin iron tubes 60 feet above the level of the St. Lawrence, which runs\r\nbeneath at a speed of about ten miles an hour, and in winter brings down\r\nthe ice of two thousand square miles of lakes and rivers, with their\r\nnumerous tributaries.  The weight of iron in the tubes is about ten\r\nthousand tons, supported on massive piers, which contain, some six, and\r\nothers ten thousand tons of solid masonry.\r\n\r\nSo gigantic a work, involving so heavy an expenditure--about 1,300,000\r\npounds--was not projected without sufficient cause.  The Grand Trunk\r\nRailway of Canada, upwards of 1200 miles in length, traverses British\r\nNorth America from the shores of the Atlantic to the rich prairie country\r\nof the Far West.  It opens up a vast extent of fertile territory for\r\nfuture immigration, and provides a ready means for transporting the\r\nvaried products of the Western States to the seaboard.  So long as the\r\nSt. Lawrence was relied upon, the inhabitants along the Great Valley were\r\nprecluded from communication with each other for nearly six months of the\r\nyear, during which the navigation was closed by the ice.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Railway was designed to furnish a line of communication\r\nthrough this great district at all seasons; following the course of the\r\nSt. Lawrence along its north bank, and uniting the principal towns of\r\nCanada.  But stopping short on the north shore, it was still an\r\nincomplete work; unconnected, except by a dangerous and often\r\nimpracticable ferry, with Montreal, the capital of the province, and shut\r\noff from connection with the United States, as well as with the coast to\r\nwhich the commerce of Canada naturally tends.  Without a bridge at\r\nMontreal, therefore, it was felt that the system of Canadian railway\r\ncommunication would have been incomplete, and the benefits of the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway in a great measure nugatory.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1846 the construction of a bridge across the St. Lawrence at\r\nMontreal was strongly advocated by the local press for the purpose of\r\ndirectly connecting that city with the then projected Atlantic and St.\r\nLawrence Railway.  A survey of the bridge was made, and the scheme was\r\nreported to be practicable.  A period of colonial depression, however,\r\nintervened, and although the project was not lost sight of, it was not\r\nuntil 1852, when the Grand Trunk Railway Company began their operations,\r\nthat there seemed to be any reasonable prospect of its being carried out.\r\nIn that year, Mr. A. M. Ross--who had superintended, under Robert\r\nStephenson, the construction of the tubular bridge over the\r\nConway--visited Canada, and inspected the site of the proposed bridge,\r\nwhen he readily arrived at the conclusion that a like structure was\r\nsuitable for the crossing of the St. Lawrence.  He returned to England to\r\nconfer with Robert Stephenson on the subject, and the result was the plan\r\nof the Victoria Bridge, of which Robert Stephenson was the designer, and\r\nMr. A. M. Ross the joint and resident engineer.\r\n\r\nThe particular kind of structure to be adopted, however, formed the\r\nsubject of much preliminary discussion.  Even after the design of a\r\ntubular bridge had been adopted, and the piers were commenced, the plan\r\nwas made the subject of severe criticism, on the ground of its alleged\r\nexcessive cost.  It therefore became necessary for Mr. Stephenson to\r\nvindicate the propriety of his design in a report to the directors of the\r\nrailway, in which he satisfactorily proved that as respected strength,\r\nefficiency, and economy, with a view to permanency, the plan of the\r\nVictoria Bridge was unimpeachable.  There were various methods proposed\r\nfor spanning the St. Lawrence.  The suspension bridge, such as that over\r\nthe river Niagara, was found inapplicable for several reasons, but\r\nchiefly because of its defective rigidity, which greatly limited the\r\nspeed and weight of the trains, and consequently the amount of traffic\r\nwhich could be passed over such a bridge.  Thus, taking the length of the\r\nVictoria Bridge into account, it was found that not more than 20 trains\r\ncould pass within the 24 hours, a number insufficient for the\r\naccommodation of the anticipated traffic.  To introduce such an amount of\r\nmaterial into the suspension bridge as would supply increased rigidity,\r\nwould only be approximating to the original beam, and neutralizing any\r\nadvantages in point of cheapness which might be derivable from this form\r\nof structure, without securing the essential stiffness and strength.\r\nIron arches were also considered inapplicable, because of the large\r\nheadway required for the passage of the ice in winter, and the necessity\r\nwhich existed for keeping the springing of the arches clear of the\r\nwater-line.  This would have involved the raising of the entire road, and\r\na largely increased expenditure on the upper works.  The question was\r\ntherefore reduced to the consideration of the kind of _horizontal beam_\r\nor _girder_ to be employed.\r\n\r\nHorizontal girders are of three kinds.  The _Tubular_ is constructed of\r\nriveted rectangular boiler plates.  Where the span is large, the road\r\npasses within the tube; where the span is comparatively small, the\r\nroadway is supported by two or more rectangular beams.  Next there is the\r\n_Lattice_ girder, borrowed from the loose rough timber bridges of the\r\nAmerican engineers, consisting of a top and bottom flange connected by a\r\nnumber of flat iron bars, riveted across each other at a certain angle,\r\nthe roadway resting on the top, or being suspended at the bottom between\r\nthe lattice on either side.  Bridges on the same construction are now\r\nextensively used for crossing the broad rivers of India, and are\r\nespecially designed with a view to their easy transport and erection.\r\nThe _Trellis_ or Warren girder is a modification of the same plan,\r\nconsisting of a top and bottom flange, with a connecting web of diagonal\r\nflat bars, forming a complete system of triangulation--hence the name of\r\n\"Triangular girder,\" by which it is generally known.  The merit of this\r\nform consists in its comparative rigidity, strength, lightness, and\r\neconomy of material These bridges are also extensively employed in\r\nspanning the rivers of India.  One of the best specimens is the Crumlin\r\nviaduct, 200 feet high at one point, which spans the river and valley of\r\nthe Ebbw near the village of Crumlin in South Wales.  This viaduct is\r\nabout a third of a mile long, divided into two parts by a ridge of hills\r\nwhich runs through the centre of the valley--each part forming a separate\r\nviaduct, the one of seven equal spans of 150 feet, the other of three\r\nspans of the same diameter.  The bridge has been very skilfully designed\r\nand constructed, and, by reason of its great dimensions and novel\r\narrangements, is entitled to be regarded as one of the most remarkable\r\nengineering works of the day.\r\n\r\n\"In calculating the strength of these different classes of girders,\" Mr.\r\nStephenson observed, \"one ruling principle appertains, and is common to\r\nall of them.  Primarily and essentially, the ultimate strength is\r\nconsidered to exist in the top and bottom,--the former being exposed to a\r\ncompression force by the action of the load, and the latter to a force of\r\ntension; therefore, whatever be the class or denomination of girders,\r\nthey must all be alike in amount of effective material in these members,\r\nif their spans and depths are the same, and they have to sustain the same\r\namount of load.  Hence, the question of comparative merit amongst the\r\ndifferent classes of construction of beams or girders is really narrowed\r\nto the method of connecting the top and bottom _webs_, so called.\"  In\r\nthe tubular system the connexion is effected by continuous boiler plates\r\nriveted together; and in the lattice and trellis bridges by flat iron\r\nbars, more or less numerous, forming a series of struts and ties.  Those\r\nengineers who advocate the employment of the latter form of construction,\r\nset forth as its principal advantage the saving of material which is\r\neffected by employing bars instead of iron plates; whereas Mr. Stephenson\r\nand his followers urge, that in point of economy the boiler plate side is\r\nequal to the bars, whilst in point of effective strength and rigidity it\r\nis decidedly superior.  To show the comparative economy of material, he\r\ncontrasted the lattice girder bridge over the river Trent, on the Great\r\nNorthern Railway near Newark, with the tubes of the Victoria Bridge.  In\r\nthe former case, where the span is 240.5 feet, and the bridge 13 feet\r\nwide, the weight including bearings is 292 tons; in the latter, where the\r\nspan is 242 feet, the width of the tube 16 feet, the weight including\r\nbearings is 275 tons, showing a balance in favour of the Victoria Tube of\r\n17 tons.  The comparison between the Newark Dyke Bridge and the Tubular\r\nBridge over the river Aire is equally favourable to the latter; and no\r\none can have travelled over the Great Northern line to York without\r\nnoting that, as respects rigidity under the passing train, the Tubular\r\nBridge is decidedly superior.  It is ascertained that the deflection\r\ncaused by a passing load is considerably greater in the former case; and\r\nMr. Stephenson was also of opinion that the sides of all trellis or\r\nlattice girders are useless, except for the purpose of connecting the top\r\nand bottom, and keeping them in their position.  They depend upon their\r\nconnexion with the top and bottom webs for their own support; and since\r\nthey could not sustain their shape, but would collapse immediately on\r\ntheir being disconnected from their top and bottom members, it is evident\r\nthat they add to the strain upon them, and consequently to that extent\r\nreduce the ultimate strength of the beams.  \"I admit,\" he added, \"that\r\nthere is no formula for valuing the _solid_ sides for strains, and that\r\nat present we only ascribe to them the value or use of connecting the top\r\nand bottom; yet we are aware that, from their continuity and solidity,\r\nthey are of value to resist horizontal and many other strains,\r\nindependently of the top and bottom, by which they add very much to the\r\nstiffness of the beam; and the fact of their containing more material\r\nthan is necessary to connect the top and bottom webs, has by no means\r\nbeen fairly established.\"  Another important advantage of the Tubular\r\nbridge over the Trellis or Lattice structure, consists in its greater\r\nsafety in event of a train running off the line,--a contingency which has\r\nmore than once occurred on a tubular bridge without detriment, whereas in\r\nevent of such an accident occurring on a Trellis or Lattice bridge, it\r\nmust infallibly be destroyed.  Where the proposed bridge is of the\r\nunusual length of a mile and a quarter, it is obvious that this\r\nconsideration must have had no small weight with the directors, who\r\neventually decided on proceeding with the Tubular Bridge according to Mr.\r\nStephenson's original design.\r\n\r\nFrom the first projection of the Victoria Bridge, the difficulties of\r\nexecuting such a work across a wide river, down which an avalanche of ice\r\nrushes to the sea every spring, were pronounced almost insurmountable by\r\nthose best acquainted with the locality.  The ice of two thousand miles\r\nof inland lakes and upper rivers, besides their tributaries, is then\r\npoured down stream, and, in the neighbourhood of Montreal especially, it\r\nis often piled up to the height of from forty to fifty feet, placing the\r\nsurrounding country under water, and doing severe damage to the massive\r\nstone buildings along the noble river front of the city.  To resist so\r\nprodigious a pressure, it was necessary that the piers of the proposed\r\nbridge should be of the most solid and massive description.  Their\r\nfoundations are placed in the solid rock; for none of the artificial\r\nmethods of obtaining foundations, suggested by some engineers for\r\ncheapness' sake, were found practicable in this case.  Where the force\r\nexercised against the piers was likely to be so great, it was felt that\r\ntimber ice-breakers, timber or cast-iron piling, or even rubble-work,\r\nwould have proved but temporary expedients.  The two centre piers are\r\neighteen feet wide, and the remaining twenty-two piers fifteen feet; to\r\narrest and break the ice, an inclined plane, composed of great blocks of\r\nstone, was added to the up-river side of each pier--each block weighing\r\nfrom seven to ten tons, and the whole were firmly clamped together with\r\niron rivets.\r\n\r\nTo convey some idea of the immense force which these piers are required\r\nto resist, we may briefly describe the breaking up of the ice in March,\r\n1858, while the bridge was under construction.  Fourteen out of the\r\ntwenty-four piers were then finished, together with the formidable\r\nabutments and approaches to the bridge.  The ice in the river began to\r\nshow signs of weakness on the 29th March, but it was not until the 31st\r\nthat a general movement became observable, which continued for an hour,\r\nwhen it suddenly stopped, and the water rose rapidly.  On the following\r\nday, at noon, a grand movement commenced; the waters rose about four feet\r\nin two minutes, up to a level with many of the Montreal streets.  The\r\nfields of ice at the same time were suddenly elevated to an incredible\r\nheight; and so overwhelming were they in appearance, that crowds of the\r\ntownspeople, who had assembled on the quay to watch the progress of the\r\nflood, ran for their lives.  This movement lasted about twenty minutes,\r\nduring which the jammed ice destroyed several portions of the quay-wall,\r\ngrinding the hardest blocks to atoms.  The embanked approaches to the\r\nVictoria Bridge had tremendous forces to resist.  In the full channel of\r\nthe stream, the ice in its passage between the piers was broken up by the\r\nforce of the blow immediately on its coming in contact with the\r\ncutwaters.  Sometimes thick sheets of ice were seen to rise up and rear\r\non end against the piers, but by the force of the current they were\r\nspeedily made to roll over into the stream, and in a moment after were\r\nout of sight.  For the two next days the river was still high, until on\r\nthe 4th April the waters seemed suddenly to give way, and by the\r\nfollowing day the river was flowing clear and smooth as a millpond,\r\nnothing of winter remaining except the masses of bordage ice which were\r\nstrewn along the shores of the stream.  On examination of the piers of\r\nthe bridge, it was found that they had admirably resisted the tremendous\r\npressure; and though the timber \"cribwork\" erected to facilitate the\r\nplacing of floating pontoons to form the dams, was found considerably\r\ndisturbed and in some places seriously damaged, the piers, with the\r\nexception of one or two heavy stone blocks, which were still unfinished,\r\nescaped uninjured.  One heavy block of many tons' weight was carried to a\r\nconsiderable distance, and must have been torn out of its place by sheer\r\nforce, as several of the broken fragments were found left in the pier.\r\n\r\nThe works in connection with the Victoria Bridge were begun on the 22nd\r\nJuly, 1854, when the first stone was laid, and continued uninterruptedly\r\nduring a period of 5.5 years, until the 17th December, 1859, when the\r\nbridge was finished and taken off the contractor's hands.  It was\r\nformally opened for traffic early in 1860; though Robert Stephenson did\r\nnot live to see its completion.\r\n\r\nThe tubular system was also applied by the same engineer, in a modified\r\nform, in the two bridges across the Nile, near Damietta in Lower Egypt.\r\nThat near Benha contains eight spans or openings of 80 feet each, and two\r\ncentre spans, formed by one of the largest swing bridges ever\r\nconstructed,--the total length of the swing-beam being 157 feet,--a clear\r\nwater-way of 60 feet being provided on either side of the centre pier.\r\nThe only novelty in these bridges consisted in the road being carried\r\n_upon_ the tubes instead of within them; their erection being carried out\r\nin the usual manner, by means of workmen, materials, and plant sent out\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of his life, Mr. Stephenson took considerable\r\ninterest in public affairs and in scientific investigations.  In 1847 he\r\nentered the House of Commons as member for Whitby; but he does not seem\r\nto have been very devoted in his attendance, and only appeared on\r\ndivisions when there was a \"whip\" of the party to which he belonged.  He\r\nwas a member of the Sanitary and Sewage Commissions, and of the\r\nCommission which sat on Westminster Bridge.  The last occasions on which\r\nhe addressed the House were on the Suez Canal and the cleansing of the\r\nSerpentine.  He pronounced the Suez Canal to be an impracticable scheme.\r\n\"I have surveyed the line,\" said he, \"I have travelled the whole distance\r\non foot, and I declare there is no fall between the two seas.  Honourable\r\nmembers talk about a canal.  A canal is impossible--the thing would only\r\nbe a ditch.\"\r\n\r\nBesides constructing the railway between Alexandria and Cairo, he was\r\nconsulted, like his father, by the King of Belgium, as to the railways of\r\nthat country; and he was made Knight of the Order of Leopold because of\r\nthe improvements which he had made in locomotive engines, so much to the\r\nadvantage of the Belgian system of inland transit.  He was consulted by\r\nthe King of Sweden as to the railway between Christiana and Lake Miosen,\r\nand in consideration of his services was decorated with the Grand Cross\r\nof the Order of St. Olaf.  He also visited Switzerland, Piedmont, and\r\nDenmark, to advise as to the system of railway communication best suited\r\nfor those countries.  At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 the Emperor of\r\nFrance decorated him with the Legion of Honour in consideration of his\r\npublic services; and at home the University of Oxford made him a Doctor\r\nof Civil Laws.  In 1855 he was elected President of the Institute of\r\nCivil Engineers, which office he held with honour and filled with\r\ndistinguished ability for two years, giving place to his friend Mr. Locke\r\nat the end of 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson was frequently called upon to act as arbitrator between\r\ncontractors and railway companies, or between one company and\r\nanother,--great value being attached to his opinion on account of his\r\nweighty judgment, his great experience, and his upright character, and we\r\nbelieve his decisions were invariably stamped by the qualities of\r\nimpartiality and justice.  He was always ready to lend a helping hand to\r\na friend, and no petty jealousy stood between him and his rivals in the\r\nengineering world.  The author remembers being with Mr. Stephenson one\r\nevening at his house in Gloucester Square, when a note was put into his\r\nhands from his friend Brunel, then engaged in his first fruitless efforts\r\nto launch the _Great Eastern_.  It was to ask Stephenson to come down to\r\nBlackwall early next morning, and give him the benefit of his judgment.\r\nShortly after six next morning Stephenson was in Scott Russell's\r\nbuilding-yard, and he remained there until dusk.  About midday, while\r\nsuperintending the launching operations, the baulk of timber on which he\r\nstood canted up, and he fell up to his middle in the Thames mud.  He was\r\ndressed as usual, without great-coat (though the day was bitter cold),\r\nand with only thin boots upon his feet.  He was urged to leave the yard,\r\nand change his dress, or at least dry himself; but with his usual\r\ndisregard of health, he replied, \"Oh, never mind me--I'm quite used to\r\nthis sort of thing;\" and he went paddling about in the mud, smoking his\r\ncigar, until almost dark, when the day's work was brought to an end.  The\r\nresult of this exposure was an attack of inflammation of the lungs, which\r\nkept him to his bed for a fortnight.\r\n\r\nHe was habitually careless of his health, and perhaps he indulged in\r\nnarcotics to a prejudicial extent.  Hence he often became \"hipped\" and\r\nsometimes ill.  When Mr. Sopwith accompanied him to Egypt in the\r\n_Titania_, in 1856, he succeeded in persuading Mr. Stephenson to limit\r\nhis indulgence in cigars and stimulants, and the consequence was that by\r\nthe end of the voyage he felt himself, as he said, \"quite a new man.\"\r\nArrived at Marseilles, he telegraphed from thence a message to Great\r\nGeorge Street, prescribing certain stringent and salutary rules for\r\nobservance in the office there on his return.  But he was of a facile,\r\nsocial disposition, and the old associations proved too strong for him.\r\nWhen he sailed for Norway, in the autumn of 1859, though then ailing in\r\nhealth, he looked a man who had still plenty of life in him.  By the time\r\nhe returned, his fatal illness had seized him.  He was attacked by\r\ncongestion of the liver, which first developed itself in jaundice, and\r\nthen ran into dropsy, of which he died on the 12th October, in the\r\nfifty-sixth year of his age. {368}  He was buried by the side of Telford\r\nin Westminster Abbey, amidst the departed great men of his country, and\r\nwas attended to his resting-place by many of the intimate friends of his\r\nboyhood and his manhood.  Among those who assembled round his grave were\r\nsome of the greatest men of thought and action in England, who embraced\r\nthe sad occasion to pay the last mark of their respect to this\r\nillustrious son of one of England's greatest working men.\r\n\r\n     [Picture: Robert Stephenson's Burial-place in Westminster Abbey]\r\n\r\nIt would be out of keeping with the subject thus drawn to a conclusion,\r\nto pronounce any panegyric on the character and achievements of George\r\nand Robert Stephenson.  These for the most part speak for themselves.\r\nBoth were emphatically true men, exhibiting in their lives many sterling\r\nqualities.  No beginning could have been less promising than that of the\r\nelder Stephenson.  Born in a poor condition, yet rich in spirit, he was\r\nfrom the first compelled to rely upon himself; and every step of advance\r\nwhich he made was conquered by patient labour.  Whether working as a\r\nbrakesman or an engineer, his mind was always full of the work in hand.\r\nHe gave himself thoroughly up to it.  Like the painter, he might say that\r\nhe had become great \"by neglecting nothing.\"  Whatever he was engaged\r\nupon, he was as careful of the details as if each were itself the whole.\r\nHe did all thoroughly and honestly.  There was no \"scamping\" with him.\r\nWhen a workman he put his brains and labour into his work; and when a\r\nmaster he put his conscience and character into it.  He would have no\r\nslop-work executed merely for the sake of profit.  The materials must be\r\nas genuine as the workmanship was skilful.  The structures which he\r\ndesigned and executed were distinguished for their thoroughness and\r\nsolidity; his locomotives were famous for their durability and excellent\r\nworking qualities.  The engines which he sent to the United States in\r\n1832 are still in good condition; and even the engines built by him for\r\nthe Killingworth Colliery, upwards of thirty years ago, are working\r\nsteadily there to this day.  All his work was honest, representing the\r\nactual character of the man.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to turn his hand to anything--shoes and clocks, railways and\r\nlocomotives.  He contrived his safety-lamp with the object of saving\r\npitmen's lives, and perilled his own life in testing it.  Whatever work\r\nwas nearest him, he turned to and did it.  With him to resolve was to do.\r\nMany men knew far more than he; but none were more ready forthwith to\r\napply what he did know to practical purposes.  It was while working at\r\nWillington as a brakes-man, that he first learnt how best to handle a\r\nspade in throwing ballast out of the ships' holds.  This casual\r\nemployment seems to have left upon his mind the strongest impression of\r\nwhat \"hard work\" was; and he often used to revert to it, and say to the\r\nyoung men about him, \"Ah, ye lads! there's none o' ye know what _wark_\r\nis.\"  Mr. Gooch says he was proud of the dexterity in handling a spade\r\nwhich he had thus acquired, and that he has frequently seen him take the\r\nshovel from a labourer in some railway cutting, and show him how to use\r\nit more deftly in filling waggons of earth, gravel, or sand.  Sir Joshua\r\nWalmsley has also informed us, that, when examining the works of the\r\nOrleans and Tours Railway, Mr. Stephenson, seeing a large number of\r\nexcavators filling and wheeling sand in a cutting, at a great waste of\r\ntime and labour, went up to the men and said he would show them how to\r\nfill their barrows in half the time.  He showed them the proper position\r\nin which to stand so as to exercise the greatest amount of power with the\r\nleast expenditure of strength; and he filled the barrow with comparative\r\nease again and again in their presence, to the great delight of the\r\nworkmen.  When passing through his own workshops, he would point out to\r\nhis men how to save labour, and to get through their work skilfully and\r\nwith ease.  His energy imparted itself to others, quickening and\r\ninfluencing them as strong characters always do--flowing down into\r\ntheirs, and bringing out their best powers.\r\n\r\nHis deportment towards the workmen employed under him was familiar, yet\r\nfirm and consistent.  As he respected their manhood, so did they respect\r\nhis masterhood.  Although he comported himself towards his men as if they\r\noccupied very much the same level as himself, he yet possessed that\r\npeculiar capacity for governing which enabled him always to preserve\r\namong them the strictest discipline, and to secure their cheerful and\r\nhearty services.  Mr. Ingham, M.P. for South Shields, on going over the\r\nworkshops at Newcastle, was particularly struck with this quality of the\r\nmaster in his bearing towards his men.  \"There was nothing,\" said he, \"of\r\nundue familiarity in their intercourse, but they spoke to each other as\r\nman to man; and nothing seemed to please the master more than to point\r\nout illustrations of the ingenuity of his artisans.  He took up a rivet,\r\nand expatiated on the skill with which it had been fashioned by the\r\nworkman's hand--its perfectness and truth.  He was always proud of his\r\nworkmen and his pupils; and, while indifferent and careless as to what\r\nmight be said of himself, he fired up in a moment if disparagement were\r\nthrown upon any one whom he had taught or trained.\"\r\n\r\nIn manner, George Stephenson was simple, modest, and unassuming, but\r\nalways manly.  He was frank and social in spirit.  When a humble workman,\r\nhe had carefully preserved his sense of self-respect.  His companions\r\nlooked up to him, and his example was worth even more to many of them\r\nthan books or schools.  His devoted love of knowledge made his poverty\r\nrespectable, and adorned his humble calling.  When he rose to a more\r\nelevated station, and associated with men of the highest position and\r\ninfluence in Britain, he took his place amongst them with perfect\r\nself-possession.  They wondered at the quiet ease and simple dignity of\r\nhis deportment; and men in the best ranks of life have said of him that\r\n\"He was one of Nature's gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nProbably no military chiefs were ever more beloved by their soldiers than\r\nwere both father and son by the army of men who, under their guidance,\r\nworked at labours of profit, made labours of love by their earnest will\r\nand purpose.  True leaders of men and lords of industry, they were always\r\nready to recognise and encourage talent in those who worked for and with\r\nthem.  Thus it was pleasant, at the openings of the Stephenson lines, to\r\nhear the chief engineers attributing the successful completion of the\r\nworks to their able assistants; whilst the assistants, on the other hand,\r\nascribed the glory to their chiefs.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson, though a thrifty and frugal man, was essentially\r\nunsordid.  His rugged path in early life made him careful of his\r\nresources.  He never saved to hoard, but saved for a purpose, such as the\r\nmaintenance of his parents or the education of his son.  In later years\r\nhe became a prosperous and even a wealthy man; but riches never closed\r\nhis heart, nor stole away the elasticity of his soul.  He enjoyed life\r\ncheerfully, because hopefully.  When he entered upon a commercial\r\nenterprise, whether for others or for himself, he looked carefully at the\r\nways and means.  Unless they would \"pay,\" he held back.  \"He would have\r\nnothing to do,\" he declared, \"with stock-jobbing speculations.\"  His\r\nrefusal to sell his name to the schemes of the railway mania--his survey\r\nof the Spanish lines without remuneration--his offer to postpone his\r\nclaim for payment from a poor company until their affairs became more\r\nprosperous--are instances of the unsordid spirit in which he acted.\r\n\r\nAnother marked feature in Mr. Stephenson's character was his patience.\r\nNotwithstanding the strength of his convictions as to the great uses to\r\nwhich the locomotive might be applied, he waited long and patiently for\r\nthe opportunity of bringing it into notice; and for years after he had\r\ncompleted an efficient engine he went on quietly devoting himself to the\r\nordinary work of the colliery.  He made no noise nor stir about his\r\nlocomotive, but allowed another to take credit for the experiments on\r\nvelocity and friction made with it by himself upon the Killingworth\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nBy patient industry and laborious contrivance, he was enabled, with the\r\npowerful help of his son, to do for the locomotive what James Watt had\r\ndone for the condensing engine.  He found it clumsy and inefficient; and\r\nhe made it powerful, efficient, and useful.  Both have been described as\r\nthe improvers of their respective engines; but, as to all that is\r\nadmirable in their structure or vast in their utility, they are rather\r\nentitled to be described as their Inventors.  While the invention of Watt\r\nincreased the power, and at the same time so regulated the action of the\r\nsteam-engine, as to make it capable of being applied alike to the hardest\r\nwork and to the finest manufactures, the invention of Stephenson gave an\r\neffective power to the locomotive, which enabled it to perform the work\r\nof teams of the most powerful horses, and to outstrip the speed of the\r\nfleetest.  Watt's invention exercised a wonderfully quickening influence\r\non every branch of industry, and multiplied a thousand-fold the amount of\r\nmanufactured productions; and Stephenson's enabled these to be\r\ndistributed with an economy and despatch such as had never before been\r\nthought possible.  They have both tended to increase indefinitely the\r\nmass of human comforts and enjoyments, and to render them cheap and\r\naccessible to all.  But Stephenson's invention, by the influence which it\r\nis daily exercising upon the civilisation of the world, is even more\r\nremarkable than that of Watt, and is calculated to have still more\r\nimportant consequences.  In this respect, it is to be regarded as the\r\ngrandest application of steam power that has yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe Locomotive, like the condensing engine, exhibits the realisation of\r\nvarious capital, but wholly distinct, ideas, promulgated by many\r\ningenious inventors.  Stephenson, like Watt, exhibited a power of\r\nselection, combination, and invention of his own, by which--while\r\navailing himself of all that had been done before him, and superadding\r\nthe many skilful contrivances devised by himself--he was at length\r\nenabled to bring his engine into a condition of marvellous power and\r\nefficiency.  He gathered together the scattered threads of ingenuity\r\nwhich already existed, and combined them into one firm and complete\r\nfabric of his own.  He realised the plans which others had imperfectly\r\nformed; and was the first to construct, what so many others had\r\nunsuccessfully attempted, the practical and economical working\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson's close and accurate observation provided him with a\r\nfulness of information on many subjects, which often appeared surprising\r\nto those who had devoted to them a special study.  On one occasion the\r\naccuracy of his knowledge of birds came out in a curious way at a\r\nconvivial meeting of railway men in London.  The engineers and railway\r\ndirectors present knew each other as railway men and nothing more.  The\r\ntalk had been all of railways and railway politics.  Mr. Stephenson was a\r\ngreat talker on those subjects, and was generally allowed, from the\r\ninterest of his conversation and the extent of his experience, to take\r\nthe lead.  At length one of the party broke in with \"Come now,\r\nStephenson, we have had nothing but railways; cannot we have a change and\r\ntry if we can talk a little about something else?\"  \"Well,\" said Mr.\r\nStephenson, \"I'll give you a wide range of subjects; what shall it be\r\nabout?\"  \"Say _birds' nests_!\" rejoined the other, who prided himself on\r\nhis special knowledge of this subject.  \"Then birds' nests be it.\"  A\r\nlong and animated conversation ensued: the bird-nesting of his boyhood,\r\nthe blackbird's nest which his father had held him up in his arms to look\r\nat when a child at Wylam, the hedges in which he had found the thrush's\r\nand the linnet's nests, the mossy bank where the robin built, the cleft\r\nin the branch of the young tree where the chaffinch had reared its\r\ndwelling--all rose up clear in his mind's eye, and led him back to the\r\nscenes of his boyhood at Callerton and Dewley Burn.  The colour and\r\nnumber of the bird's eggs, the period of their incubation, the materials\r\nemployed by them for the walls and lining of their nests, were described\r\nby him so vividly, and illustrated by such graphic anecdotes, that one of\r\nthe party remarked that, if George Stephenson had not been the greatest\r\nengineer of his day, he might have been one of the greatest naturalists.\r\n\r\nHis powers of conversation were very great.  He was so thoughtful, so\r\noriginal, and so suggestive.  There was scarcely a department of science\r\non which he had not formed some novel and sometimes daring theory.  Thus\r\nMr. Gooch, his pupil, who lived with him when at Liverpool, informs us\r\nthat when sitting over the fire, he would frequently broach his favourite\r\ntheory of the sun's light and heat being the original source of the light\r\nand heat given forth by the burning coal.  \"It fed the plants of which\r\nthat coal is made,\" he would say, \"and has been bottled up in the earth\r\never since, to be given out again now for the use of man.\"  His son\r\nRobert once said of him, \"My father flashed his bull's eye full upon a\r\nsubject, and brought it out in its most vivid light in an instant: his\r\nstrong common sense, and his varied experience operating upon a\r\nthoughtful mind, were his most powerful illuminators.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson had once a conversation with a watchmaker, whom he\r\nastonished by the extent and minuteness of his knowledge as to the parts\r\nof a watch.  The watchmaker knew him to be an eminent engineer, and asked\r\nhim how he had acquired so extensive a knowledge of a branch of business\r\nso much out of his sphere.  \"It is very easy to be explained,\" said Mr.\r\nStephenson; \"I worked long at watch-cleaning myself, and when I was at a\r\nloss, I was never ashamed to ask for information.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the close of his life he frequently went down to Newcastle, and\r\nvisited the scenes of his boyhood.  \"I have been to Callerton,\" said he\r\none day to a friend, \"and seen the fields in which I used to pull turnips\r\nat twopence a day; and many a cold finger, I can tell you, I had.\"\r\n\r\nHis hand was open to his former fellow-workmen whom old age had left in\r\npoverty.  To poor Robert Gray, of Newburn, who acted as his bridesman on\r\nhis marriage to Fanny Henderson, he left a pension for life.  He would\r\nslip a five-pound note into the hand of a poor man or a widow in such a\r\nway as not to offend their delicacy, but to make them feel as if the\r\nobligation were all on his side.  When Farmer Paterson, who married a\r\nsister of George's first wife, Fanny Henderson, died and left a large\r\nyoung family fatherless, poverty stared them in the face.  \"But ye ken,\"\r\nsaid our informant, \"_George struck in fayther for them_.\"  And perhaps\r\nthe providential character of the act could not have been more\r\ngraphically expressed than in these simple words.\r\n\r\nOn his visit to Newcastle, he would frequently meet the friends of his\r\nearly days, occupying very nearly the same station, whilst he had\r\nmeanwhile risen to almost world-wide fame.  But he was no less hearty in\r\nhis greeting of them than if their relative position had continued the\r\nsame.  Thus, one day, after shaking hands with Mr. Brandling on alighting\r\nfrom his carriage, he proceeded to shake hands with his coachman, Anthony\r\nWigham, a still older friend, though he only sat on the box.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson inherited his father's kindly spirit and benevolent\r\ndisposition.  He almost worshipped his father's memory, and was ever\r\nready to attribute to him the chief merit of his own achievements as an\r\nengineer.  \"It was his thorough training,\" we once heard him say, \"his\r\nexample, and his character, which made me the man I am.\"  On a more\r\npublic occasion he said, \"It is my great pride to remember, that whatever\r\nmay have been done, and however extensive may have been my own connection\r\nwith railway development, all I know and all I have done is primarily due\r\nto the parent whose memory I cherish and revere.\" {377}  To Mr. Lough,\r\nthe sculptor, he said he had never had but two loves--one for his father,\r\nthe other for his wife.\r\n\r\nLike his father, he was eminently practical, and yet always open to the\r\ninfluence and guidance of correct theory.  His main consideration in\r\nlaying out his lines of railway was what would best answer the intended\r\npurpose, or, to use his own words, to secure the maximum of result with\r\nthe minimum of means.  He was pre-eminently a safe man, because cautious,\r\ntentative, and experimental; following closely the lines of conduct\r\ntrodden by his father, and often quoting his maxims.\r\n\r\nIn society Robert Stephenson was simple, unobtrusive, and modest; but\r\ncharming and even fascinating in an eminent degree.  Sir John Lawrence\r\nhas said of him that he was, of all others, the man he most delighted to\r\nmeet in England--he was so manly, yet gentle, and withal so great.  While\r\nadmired and beloved by men of such calibre, he was equally a favourite\r\nwith women and children.  He put himself upon the level of all, and\r\ncharmed them no less by his inexpressible kindliness of manner than by\r\nhis simple yet impressive conversation.\r\n\r\nHis great wealth enabled him to perform many generous acts in a right\r\nnoble and yet modest manner, not letting his right hand know what his\r\nleft hand did.  Of the numerous kindly acts of his which have been made\r\npublic, we may mention the graceful manner in which he repaid the\r\nobligations which both himself and his father owed to the Newcastle\r\nLiterary and Philosophical Institute, when working together as humble\r\nexperimenters in their cottage at Killingworth.  The Institute was\r\nstruggling under a debt of 6200 pounds which seriously impaired its\r\nusefulness as an educational agency.  Robert Stephenson offered to pay\r\none-half of the sum, provided the local supporters of the Institute would\r\nraise the remainder; and conditional also on the annual subscription\r\nbeing reduced from two guineas to one, in order that the usefulness of\r\nthe institution might be extended.  The generous offer was accepted, and\r\nthe debt extinguished.\r\n\r\nBoth father and son were offered knighthood, and both declined it.\r\nDuring the summer of 1847, George Stephenson was invited to offer himself\r\nas a candidate for the representation of South Shields in Parliament.\r\nBut his politics were at best of a very undefined sort; indeed his life\r\nhad been so much occupied with subjects of a practical character, that he\r\nhad scarcely troubled himself to form any decided opinion on the party\r\npolitical topics of the day, and to stand the cross fire of the electors\r\non the hustings might have been found an even more distressing ordeal\r\nthan the cross-questioning of the barristers in the Committees of the\r\nHouse of Commons.  \"Politics,\" he used to say, \"are all matters of\r\ntheory--there is no stability in them: they shift about like the sands of\r\nthe sea: and I should feel quite out of my element amongst them.\"  He had\r\naccordingly the good sense respectfully to decline the honour of\r\ncontesting the representation of South Shields.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, been informed by Sir Joseph Paxton, that although\r\nGeorge Stephenson held no strong opinions on political questions\r\ngenerally, there was one question on which he entertained a decided\r\nconviction, and that was the question of Free-trade.  The words used by\r\nhim on one occasion to Sir Joseph were very strong.  \"England,\" said he,\r\n\"is, and must be a shopkeeper; and our docks and harbours are only so\r\nmany wholesale shops, the doors of which should always be kept wide\r\nopen.\"  It is curious that his son Robert should have taken precisely the\r\nopposite view of this question, and acted throughout with the most rigid\r\nparty amongst the protectionists, supporting the Navigation Laws and\r\nopposing Free Trade.\r\n\r\nBut Robert Stephenson will be judged in after times by his achievements\r\nas an engineer, rather than by his acts as a politician; and happily\r\nthese last were far outweighed in value by the immense practical services\r\nwhich he rendered to trade, commerce, and civilisation, through the\r\nfacilities which the railways constructed by him afforded for free\r\nintercommunication between men in all parts of the world.  Speaking in\r\nthe midst of his friends at Newcastle, in 1850, he observed:--\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me but as yesterday that I was engaged as an assistant in\r\nlaying out the Stockton and Darlington Railway.  Since then, the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester and a hundred other great works have sprung into\r\nexistence.  As I look back upon these stupendous undertakings,\r\naccomplished in so short a time, it seems as though we had realised in\r\nour generation the fabled powers of the magician's wand.  Hills have been\r\ncut down and valleys filled up; and when these simple expedients have not\r\nsufficed, high and magnificent viaducts have been raised, and if\r\nmountains stood in the way, tunnels of unexampled magnitude have pierced\r\nthem through, bearing their triumphant attestation to the indomitable\r\nenergy of the nation, and the unrivalled skill of our artisans.\"\r\n\r\nAs respects the immense advantages of railways to mankind, there cannot\r\nbe two opinions.  They exhibit, probably, the grandest organisation of\r\ncapital and labour that the world has yet seen.  Although they have\r\nunhappily occasioned great loss to many, the loss has been that of\r\nindividuals; whilst, as a national system, the gain has already been\r\nenormous.  As tending to multiply and spread abroad the conveniences of\r\nlife, opening up new fields of industry, bringing nations nearer to each\r\nother, and thus promoting the great ends of civilisation, the founding of\r\nthe railway system by George Stephenson and his son must be regarded as\r\none of the most important events, if not the very greatest, in the first\r\nhalf of this nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n       [Picture: The Stephenson Memorial Schools, Willington Quay]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS in coal-mines, 89, 119.\r\n\r\nAdam, Mr., counsel for Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 160, 166.\r\n\r\nAlderson, Mr. (afterwards Baron), 160, 163, 165, 168.\r\n\r\nAlton Grange, G.

At\r\nthe local assizes some years since, one of the witnesses in a criminal\r\ntrial swore that \"_he saw three men come out of the foot of a chare_.\"\r\nThe judge cautioned the jury not to pay any regard to the man's evidence,\r\nas he must be insane.  A little explanation by the foreman, however,\r\nsatisfied his lordship that the original statement was correct.\r\n\r\n{5}  'Six Months' Tour,' vol. iii. 9\r\n\r\n{26}  Father of Mr. Locke, M.P., the engineer.  He afterwards removed to\r\nBarnsley, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n{33}  The Stephenson Memorial Schools have since been erected on the site\r\nof the old cottage at Willington Quay represented in the engraving at the\r\nhead of this chapter.\r\n\r\n{38}  This incident was related by Robert Stephenson during a voyage to\r\nthe north of Scotland in 1857, when off Montrose, on board his yacht\r\n_Titania_; and the reminiscence was communicated to the author by the\r\nlate Mr. William Kell of Gateshead, who was present, at Mr. Stephenson's\r\nrequest, as being worthy of insertion in his father's biography.\r\n\r\n{52}  Speech at Newcastle, on the 18th of June, 1844, at the meeting held\r\nin celebration of the opening of the Newcastle and Darlington Railway.\r\n\r\n{57}  Robert Stephenson was perhaps, prouder of this little boyish\r\nexperiment than he was of many of his subsequent achievements.  Not\r\nhaving been quite accurately stated in the first edition of this book,\r\nMr. Stephenson noted the correction for the second, and wrote the author\r\n(Sept. 18th, 1857) as follows:--\"In the kite experiment, will you say,\r\nthat the copper-wire was insulated by a few feet of silk cord; without\r\nthis, the experiment cannot be made.\"\r\n\r\n{70}  Mr. Zerah Colburn, in his excellent work on 'Locomotive Engineering\r\nand the Mechanism of Railways,' points out that Mr. Davies Gilbert noted\r\nthe effect of the discharge of the waste steam up the chimney of\r\nTrevithick's engine in increasing the draught, and wrote a letter to\r\n'Nicholson's Journal' (Sept. 1805) on the subject. Mr. Nicholson himself\r\nproceeded to investigate the subject, and in 1806 he took out a patent\r\nfor \"steam-blasting apparatus,\" applicable to fixed engines. Trevithick\r\nhimself, however, could not have had much faith in the steam-blast for\r\nlocomotive purposes, or else he would not have taken out his patent for\r\nurging the fire by means of fanners.  But the fact is, that while the\r\nspeed of the locomotive was only four or five miles an hour, the blast\r\nwas scarcely needed. It was only when high speeds were adopted that\r\nartificial methods of urging the fire became necessary, and that the full\r\nimportance of the invention was recognised.  Like many other inventions,\r\nstimulated if not originated by necessity, the steam-blast was certainly\r\nreinvented, if not invented, by George Stephenson.\r\n\r\n{71}  'Mining Journal,'  9th September, 1858.\r\n\r\n{73}  Other machines, with legs, were patented in the following year by\r\nLewis Gompertz and by Thomas Tindall. In Tindall's specification it is\r\nprovided that the power of the engine is to be assisted by a _horizontal\r\nwindmill_; and the four pushers, or legs, are to be caused to come\r\nsuccessively in contact with the ground, and impel the carriage!\r\n\r\n{82}  Speech at the opening of the Newcastle and Darlington Railway, June\r\n18, 1844.\r\n\r\n{95}  The Editor of the 'Athenaeum' having (Nov. 8th, 1862) characterized\r\nthe author's account of this affair as \"perfectly untrue\" and a\r\n\"fiction,\" it becomes necessary to say a few words in explanation of it.\r\nThe Editor of the 'Athenaeum' quotes in support of his statement a\r\npassage from Mr. Nicholas Wood, who, however does not say that the\r\nanecdote is \"perfectly untrue,\" but merely that \"the danger was _not\r\nquite so great_ as is represented:\" he adds that \"at most an explosion\r\nmight have burnt the hands of the operator, but would not extend a few\r\nfeet from the blower.\"  However that may be, we were not without good\r\nauthority for making the original statement.  The facts were verbally\r\ncommunicated to the author in the first place by Robert Stephenson, to\r\nwhom the chapter was afterwards read in MS., in the presence of Mr.\r\nSopwith, F.R.S. at Mr. Stephenson's house in Gloucester Square, and\r\nreceived his entire approval.  But at the time at which Mr. Stephenson\r\ncommunicated the verbal information, he also handed a little book with\r\nhis name written in it, still in the author's possession, saying, \"Read\r\nthat, you will find it all there.\"  We have again referred to the little\r\nbook which contains, among other things, a pamphlet, entitled _Report on\r\nthe Claims of Mr. George Stephenson relative to the Invention of his\r\nSafety Lamp_.  _By the Committee appointed at a Meeting holden in\r\nNewcastle_, _on this 1st of November_, _1817_.  _With an Appendix\r\ncontaining the Evidence_.  Among the witnesses examined were George\r\nStephenson, Nicholas Wood, and John Moodie, and their evidence is given\r\nin the pamphlet. We quote that of Stephenson and Moodie, which was not\r\ncontradicted, but in all material points confirmed by Wood, and was\r\npublished, we believe, with his sanction. George Stephenson said, that he\r\ntried the first lamp \"in a part of the mine where the air was highly\r\nexplosive. Nicholas Wood and John Moodie were his companions when the\r\ntrial was made. They became frightened when they came within hearing of\r\nthe blower, and would not go any further.  Mr. Stephenson went alone with\r\nthe lamp to the mouth of the blower,\" etc.  This evidence was confirmed\r\nby John Moodie, who said the air of the place where the experiment was\r\nabout to be tried was such, that, if a lighted candle had been\r\nintroduced, an explosion would have taken place that would have been\r\n\"extremely dangerous.\"  \"Told Stephenson it was foul, and hinted at the\r\ndanger; nevertheless, Stephenson _would_ try the lamp, confiding in its\r\nsafety. Stephenson took the lamp and went with it into the place in which\r\nMoodie had been, and Moodie and Wood, apprehensive of the danger, retired\r\nto a greater distance,\" etc.  The other details of the statement made in\r\nthe text, are fully borne out by the published evidence, the accuracy of\r\nwhich, so far as the author is aware, has never before been called in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n{105}  The tankard bore the following inscription--\"This piece of plate,\r\npurchased with a part of the sum of 1000 pounds, a subscription raised\r\nfor the remuneration of Mr. GEORGE STEPHENSON for having discovered the\r\nfact that inflamed fire-damp will not pass through tubes and apertures of\r\nsmall dimensions, and having been _the first_ to apply that principle in\r\nthe construction of a safety-lamp calculated for the preservation of\r\nhuman life in situations formerly of the greatest danger, was presented\r\nto him at a general meeting of the subscribers, Charles John Brandling,\r\nEsq., in the Chair.  January 12th, 1818.\"\r\n\r\n{107}  The accident above referred to was described in the 'Barnsley\r\nTimes,' a copy of which, containing the account, Robert Stephenson\r\nforwarded to the author, with the observation that \"it is evidently\r\nwritten by a practical miner, and is, I think, worthy of record in my\r\nfather's Life.\"\r\n\r\n{125}  Mr. Pease died at Darlington, on the 31st of July, 1858, aged\r\nninety two.\r\n\r\n{129}  The story has been told that George was a former suitor of Miss\r\nHindmarsh, while occupying the position of a humble workman at Black\r\nCallerton, but that having been rejected by her, he made love to and\r\nmarried Fanny Henderson; and that long after the death of the latter,\r\nwhen he had become a comparatively thriving man, he again made up to Miss\r\nHindmarsh, and was on the second occasion accepted.  This is the popular\r\nstory, and different versions of it are current.  Desirous of\r\nascertaining the facts, the author called on Thomas Hindmarsh, Mrs.\r\nStephenson's brother, who assured him that George knew nothing of his\r\nsister until he (Hindmarsh) introduced him to her, at George's express\r\nrequest, about the year 1818 or 1819.  The author was himself originally\r\nattracted by the much more romantic version of the story, and gave\r\npublicity to it many years since; but after Mr. Hindmarsh's explicit\r\nstatement, he thought fit to adopt the soberer, and perhaps, the truer\r\nview.\r\n\r\n{130}  The first clause in any railway act, empowering the employment of\r\nlocomotive engines for the working of passenger traffic.\r\n\r\n{131}  This incident, communicated to the author by the late Edward\r\nPease, has since been made the subject of a fine picture by Mr. A.\r\nRankley, A.R.A., exhibited at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1861.\r\n\r\n{144}  Middlesborough does not furnish the only instance of the\r\nextraordinary increase of population in certain localities, occasioned by\r\nrailways.  Hartlepool, in the same neighbourhood, has in thirty years\r\nincreased from 1330 to above 15,000; and Stockton-on-Tees from 7763 to\r\nabove 16,000.  In 1831 Crewe was a little village with 295 inhabitants;\r\nit now numbers upwards of 10,000.  Rugby and Swindon have quadrupled\r\ntheir population in the same time.  The railway has been the making of\r\nSouthampton, and added 30,000 to its formerly small number of\r\ninhabitants.  In like manner the railway has taken London to the\r\nsea-side, and increased the population of Brighton from 40,000 to nearly\r\n100,000.  That of Folkestone has been trebled.  New and populous suburbs\r\nhave sprung up all round London.  The population of Stratford-le-Bow and\r\nWest Ham was 11,580 in 1831; it is now nearly 40,000.  Reigate has been\r\ntrebled in size, and Redhill has been created by the railway.\r\nBlackheath, Forest Hill, Sydenham, New Cross, Wimbledon, and a number of\r\npopulous places round London, may almost be said to have sprung into\r\nexistence since the extension of railways to them within the last thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n{147}  Lives of the Engineers, vol. i. p. 371.\r\n\r\n{189}  Mr. Gooch's letter to the author, December 13th, 1861.  Referring\r\nto the preparations of the plans and drawings, Mr. Gooch adds, \"When we\r\nconsider the extensive sets of drawings which most engineers have since\r\nfound it right to adopt in carrying out similar works, it is not the\r\nleast surprising feature in George Stephenson's early professional\r\ncareer, that he should have been able to confine himself to so limited a\r\nnumber as that which could be supplied by the hands of one person in\r\ncarrying out the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway;\r\nand this may still be said, after full allowance is made for the\r\nalteration of system involved by the adoption of the large contract\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\n{193}  Letter to the author.\r\n\r\n{196}  Letter to Mr. Illingworth.

April 9th, 1827.\r\n\r\n{201}  'Geological Transactions of Cornwall.'  i. 222.\r\n\r\n{206}  The arguments used by Mr. Stephenson with the directors, in favour\r\nof the locomotive engine, were afterwards collected and published in 1830\r\nby Robert Stephenson and Joseph Locke, as \"compiled from the Reports of\r\nMr. George Stephenson.\"  The pamphlet was entitled, 'Observations on the\r\nComparative Merits of Locomotive and Fixed Engines.'  Robert Stephenson,\r\nspeaking of the authorship many years after, said, \"I believe I furnished\r\nthe facts and the arguments, and Locke put them into shape.  Locke was a\r\nvery flowery writer, whereas my style was rather bald and unattractive;\r\nso he was the editor of the pamphlet, which excited a good deal of\r\nattention amongst engineers at the time.\"\r\n\r\n{207}  The conditions were these:--\r\n\r\n1.  The engine must effectually consume its own smoke.\r\n\r\n2.  The engine, if of six tons weight, must be able to draw after it, day\r\nby day, twenty tons weight (including the tender and water-tank) at _ten\r\nmiles_ an hour, with a pressure of steam on the boiler not exceeding\r\nfifty pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n3.  The boiler must have two safety-valves, neither of which must be\r\nfastened down, and one of them be completely out of the control of the\r\nengineman.\r\n\r\n4.  The engine and boiler must be supported on springs, and rest on six\r\nwheels, the height of the whole not exceeding fifteen feet to the top of\r\nthe chimney.\r\n\r\n5.  The engine, with water, must not weigh more than six tons; but an\r\nengine of less weight would be preferred on its drawing a proportionate\r\nload behind it; if only four and a half tons, then it might be put on\r\nonly four wheels.  The Company to be at liberty to test the boiler, etc.,\r\nby a pressure of one hundred and fifty pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n6.  A mercurial gauge must be affixed to the machine, showing the steam\r\npressure above forty-five pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\n7.  The engine must be delivered, complete and ready for trial, at the\r\nLiverpool end of the railway, not later than the 1st of October, 1829.\r\n\r\n8.  The price of the engine must not exceed 550 pounds.\r\n\r\n{214}  The inventor of this engine was a Swede, who afterwards proceeded\r\nto the United States, and there achieved considerable distinction as an\r\nengineer.  His Caloric Engine has so far proved a failure, but his iron\r\ncupola vessel, the \"Monitor,\" must be admitted to have been a remarkable\r\nsuccess in its way.\r\n\r\n{219}  The \"Rocket\" is now to be seen at the Museum of Patents at\r\nKensington, where it is carefully preserved.\r\n\r\n{234}  Tubbing is now adopted in many cases as a substitute for\r\nbrick-walling.  The tubbing consists of short portions of cast-iron\r\ncylinder fixed in segments.  Each weighs about 4.5 cwt., is about 3 or 4\r\nfeet long, and about 0.375 of an inch thick.  These pieces are fitted\r\nclosely together, length under length, and form an impermeable wall along\r\nthe side of the pit.\r\n\r\n{263}  During this period he was engaged on the North Midland, extending\r\nfrom Derby to Leeds; the York and North Midland, from Normanton to York;\r\nthe Manchester and Leeds; the Birmingham and Derby, and the Sheffield and\r\nRotherham Railways; the whole of these, of which he was principal\r\nengineer, having been authorised in 1836.  In that session alone, powers\r\nwere obtained for the construction of 214 miles of new railways under his\r\ndirection, at an expenditure of upwards of five millions sterling.\r\n\r\n{288}  The question of the specific merits of the atmospheric as compared\r\nwith the fixed engine and locomotive systems, will be found fully\r\ndiscussed in Robert Stephenson's able 'Report on the Atmospheric Railway\r\nSystem,' 1844, in which he gives the result of numerous observations and\r\nexperiments made by him on the Kingstown Atmospheric Railway, with the\r\nobject of ascertaining whether the new power would be applicable for the\r\nworking of the Chester and Holyhead Railway, then under construction.\r\nHis opinion was decidedly against the atmospheric system.\r\n\r\n{289}  The Marquis of Clanricarde brought under the notice of the House\r\nof Lords, in 1845, that one Charles Guernsey, the son of a charwoman, and\r\na clerk in a broker's office, at 12s. a week, had his name down as a\r\nsubscriber for shares in the London and York line, for 52,000 pounds.\r\nDoubtless he had been made useful for the purpose by the brokers, his\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n{309}  \"When my father came about the office,\" said Robert, \"he sometimes\r\ndid not well know what to do with himself.  So he used to invite Bidder\r\nto have a wrestle with him, for old acquaintance' sake.  And the two\r\nwrestled together so often, and had so many 'falls' (sometimes I thought\r\nthey would bring the house down between them), that they broke half the\r\nchairs in my outer office.  I remember once sending my father in a\r\njoiner's bill of about 2 pounds 10s. for mending broken chairs.\"\r\n\r\n{324}  The simple fact that in a heavy storm the force of impact of the\r\nwaves is from one and a-half to two tons per square foot, must\r\nnecessarily dictate the greatest possible caution in approaching so\r\nformidable an element.  Mr. R. Stevenson (Edinburgh) registered a force\r\nof three tons per square foot at Skerryvore, during a gale in the\r\nAtlantic, when the waves were supposed to run twenty feet high.\r\n\r\n{327}  Robert Stephenson's narrative in Clark's 'Britannia and Conway\r\nTubular Bridges,' vol. i. p. 27.\r\n\r\n{329a}  'Account of the Construction of the Britannia and Conway Tubular\r\nBridges.'  By W. Fairbairn, C.E. London, 1849.\r\n\r\n{329b}  Mr. Stephenson continued to hold that the elliptical tube was the\r\nright idea, and that sufficient justice had not been done to it.  A year\r\nor two before his death Mr. Stephenson remarked to the author, that had\r\nthe same arrangement for stiffening been adopted to which the oblong\r\nrectangular tubes owe a great part of their strength, a very different\r\nresult would have been obtained.\r\n\r\n{335}  'The Britannia and Conway Tubular Bridges.'  By Edwin Clark.  Vol.\r\nII, pp. 683-4.\r\n\r\n{336}  No. 34, Gloucester Square, Hyde Park, where he lived.\r\n\r\n{350}  The above anecdote is given on the authority of Mr. Sopwith.\r\nF.R.S.\r\n\r\n{354}  The second Mrs. Stephenson having died in 1845, George married a\r\nthird time in 1848, about six months before his death.  The third Mrs.\r\nStephenson had for some time been his housekeeper.\r\n\r\n{368}  In 1829 Robert Stephenson married Frances, daughter of John\r\nSanderson, merchant, London; but she died in 1842, without issue, and Mr.\r\nStephenson did not marry again.  Until the close of his life, Robert\r\nStephenson was accustomed twice in every year to visit his wife's grave\r\nin Hampstead churchyard.\r\n\r\n{377}  Address as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers,\r\nJanuary, 1856.",
