The  dark  intrigues  of  the  days  which  Cæsar,\r\n          Sallust  and  Cicero  made illustrious; when Cataline defied and\r\n          almost defeated the Senate;  when  the  plots  which  ultimately\r\n          overthrew the Roman Republic were being formed, are described in\r\n          a masterly manner. The book deserves a permanent position by the\r\n          side  of  the  great _Bellum Catalinarium_ of Sallust, and if we\r\n          mistake not will not fail to  occupy  a  prominent  place  among\r\n          those produced in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia:\r\nT.

In venturing\r\nto select a subject from the history of Rome, during its earlier ages,\r\nundeterred by the failure or, at the best, partial success of writers far\r\nmore eminent than I can ever hope to become, I have been actuated by\r\nreasons, which, in order to relieve myself from the possible charge of\r\npresumption, I will state briefly.\r\n\r\nIt has long been my opinion, then, that there lay a vast field, rich with\r\na harvest of material almost virgin, for the romancer’s use, in the\r\nhistory of classic ages. And this at a period when the annals of every\r\ncentury and nation since the Christian era have been ransacked, and\r\nreproduced, in endless variety, for the entertainment of the hourly\r\nincreasing reading world, is no small advantage.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have fancied that I could discover a cause for the imperfect\r\nsuccess of great writers when dealing with classic fiction, in the fact of\r\ntheir endeavoring to be too learned, of their aiming too much at\r\nportraying Greeks and Romans, and too little at depicting men, forgetful\r\nthat under all changes of custom, and costume, in all countries, ages, and\r\nconditions, the human heart is still the human heart, convulsed by the\r\nsame passions, chilled by the same griefs, burning with the same joys,\r\nand, in the main, actuated by the same hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nWith these views, I many years ago deliberately selected this subject, for\r\na novel, which has advanced by slow steps to such a degree of completeness\r\nas it has now attained.\r\n\r\nHaving determined on trying my success in classical fiction, the\r\nconspiracy of Cataline appeared to me, a theme particularly well adapted\r\nfor the purpose, as being an actual event of vast importance, and in many\r\nrespects unparalleled in history; as being partially familiar to every\r\none, thoroughly understood perhaps by no one, so slender are the authentic\r\ndocuments concerning it which have come down to us, and so dark and\r\nmysterious the motives of the actors.\r\n\r\nIt possessed, therefore, among other qualifications, as the ground-work of\r\na historical Romance, one almost indispensable—that of indistinctness,\r\nwhich gives scope to the exercise of imagination, without the necessity of\r\nfalsifying either the truths or the probabilities of history.\r\n\r\nOf the execution, I have, of course, nothing to say; but that I have\r\nsedulously avoided being overlearned; that few Latin words will be found\r\nin the work—none whatsoever in the conversational parts, and none but the\r\nnames of articles which have no direct English appellation; and that it is\r\nsufficiently simple and direct for the most unclassical reader.\r\n\r\nI hope that the costume, the manners of the people, and the antiquarian\r\ndetails will be found sufficiently correct; if they be not, it is not for\r\nwant of pains or care; for I have diligently consulted all the authorities\r\nto which I could command access.\r\n\r\nTo the history of the strange events related in this tale, I have adhered\r\nmost scrupulously; and I believe that the dates, facts, and characters of\r\nthe individuals introduced, will not be found in any material respect,\r\nerroneous or untrue; and here I may perhaps venture to observe, that, on\r\nreading the most recently published lectures of Niebuhr, which never fell\r\nin my way until very lately, I had the great satisfaction of finding the\r\nview I have always taken of the character and motives of Cataline and his\r\nconfederates, confirmed by the opinion of that profound and sagacious\r\ncritic and historian.\r\n\r\nI will only add, that it is hardly probable that \"the Roman Traitor\" would\r\never have been finished had it not been for the strenuous advice of a\r\nfriend, in whose opinion I have the utmost confidence, Mr. Benjamin, to\r\nwhom some of the early chapters were casually shown, two or three years\r\nago, and who almost insisted on my completing it.\r\n\r\nIt is most fitting, therefore, that it should be, as it is, introduced to\r\nthe world under his auspices; since but for his favourable judgment, and\r\nfor a feeling on my own part that to fail in such an attempt would be\r\nscarce a failure, while success would be success indeed, it would probably\r\nhave never seen the light of day!\r\n\r\nWith these few remarks, I submit the Roman Traitor to the candid judgment\r\nof my friends and the public, somewhat emboldened by the uniform kindness\r\nand encouragement which I have hitherto met; and with some hope that I may\r\nbe allowed at some future day, to lay another romance of the most famous,\r\nbefore the citizens of the youngest republic.\r\n\r\n                                                                THE CEDARS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                    PAGE\r\n     I.

The skies were dark and lowering, and ominous of\r\ntempest; for it was a sirocco, and the welkin was overcast with sheets of\r\nvapory cloud, not very dense, indeed, or solid, but still sufficient to\r\nintercept the feeble twinkling of the stars, which alone held dominion in\r\nthe firmament; since the young crescent of the moon had sunk long ago\r\nbeneath the veiled horizon.\r\n\r\nThe air was thick and sultry, and so unspeakably oppressive, that for\r\nabove three hours the streets had been entirely deserted. In a few houses\r\nof the higher class, lights might be seen dimly shining through the\r\ncasements of the small chambers, hard beside the doorway, appropriated to\r\nthe use of the Atriensis, or slave whose charge it was to guard the\r\nentrance of the court. But, for the most part, not a single ray cheered\r\nthe dull murky streets, except that here and there, before the holy\r\nshrine, or vaster and more elaborate temple, of some one of Rome’s hundred\r\ngods, the votive lanthorns, though shorn of half their beams by the dense\r\nfog-wreaths, burnt perennial.\r\n\r\nThe period was the latter time of the republic, a few years after the fell\r\ndemocratic persecutions of the plebeian Marius had drowned the mighty city\r\noceans-deep in patrician gore; after the awful retribution of the avenger\r\nSylla had rioted in the destruction of that guilty faction.\r\n\r\nHe who was destined one day to support the laurelled diadem of universal\r\nempire on his bald brows, stood even now among the noblest, the most\r\nambitious, and the most famous of the state; though not as yet had he\r\nunfurled the eagle wings of conquest over the fierce barbarian hordes of\r\nGaul and Germany, or launched his galleys on the untried waters of the\r\ngreat Western sea. A dissipated, spendthrift, and luxurious youth, devoted\r\nsolely as it would seem to the pleasures of the table, or to intrigues\r\nwith the most fair and noble of Rome’s ladies, he had yet, amid those\r\nunworthy occupations, displayed such gleams of overmastering talent, such\r\nwondrous energy, such deep sagacity, and above all such uncurbed though\r\nill-directed ambition, that the perpetual Dictator had already, years\r\nbefore, exclaimed with prescient wisdom,—\"In yon unzoned youth I perceive\r\nthe germ of many a Marius.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the magnificent and princely leader, who was to be\r\nthereafter his great rival, was reaping that rich crop of glory, the seeds\r\nof which had been sown already by the wronged Lucullus, in the broad\r\nkingdoms of the effeminate East.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Rome had gradually rendered herself, by the exertion of\r\nindomitable valor, the supreme mistress of every foreign power that\r\nbordered on the Mediterranean, wealth, avarice, and luxury, like some\r\ncontagious pestilence, had crept into the inmost vitals of the\r\ncommonwealth, until the very features, which had once made her famous, no\r\nless for her virtues than her valor, were utterly obliterated and for\r\never.\r\n\r\nInstead of a paternal, poor, brave, patriotic aristocracy, she had now a\r\nnobility, valiant indeed and capable, but dissolute beyond the reach of\r\nman’s imagination, boundless in their expenditures, reckless as to the\r\nmode of gaining wherewithal to support them, oppressive and despotical to\r\ntheir inferiors, smooth-tongued and hypocritical toward each other,\r\ndestitute equally of justice and compassion toward men, and of respect and\r\npiety toward the Gods! Wealth had become the idol, the god of the whole\r\npeople! Wealth—and no longer service, eloquence, daring, or integrity,—was\r\nheld the requisite for office. Wealth now conferred upon its owner, all\r\nmagistracies all guerdons—rank, power, command,—consulships, provinces,\r\nand armies.\r\n\r\nThe senate—once the most grave and stern and just assembly that the world\r\nhad seen—was now, with but a few superb exceptions, a timid, faithless,\r\nand licentious oligarchy; while—name whilome so majestical and mighty!—the\r\npeople, the great Roman people, was but a mob! a vile colluvion of the\r\noffscourings of all climes and regions—Greeks, Syrians, Africans,\r\nBarbarians from the chilly north, and eunuchs from the vanquished Orient,\r\nenfranchised slaves, and liberated gladiators—a factious, turbulent,\r\nfierce rabble!\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Rome, when it would seem that the Gods, wearied with\r\nthe guilt of her aggrandisement, sick of the slaughter by which she had\r\nwon her way to empire almost universal, had judged her to destruction—had\r\ngiven her up to perish, not by the hands of any foreign foe, but by her\r\nown; not by the wisdom, conduct, bravery of others, but by her own\r\ninsanity and crime.\r\n\r\nBut at this darkest season of the state one hope was left to Rome—one\r\nsafeguard. The united worth of Cicero and Cato! The statesmanship, the\r\neloquence, the splendid and unequalled parts of the former; the stern\r\nself-denying virtue, the unchanged constancy, the resolute and hard\r\nintegrity of the latter; these, singular and severally, might have availed\r\nto prop a falling dynasty—united, might have preserved a world!\r\n\r\nThe night was such as has already been described: gloomy and lowering in\r\nits character, as was the aspect of the political horizon, and most\r\ncongenial to the fearful plots, which were even now in progress against\r\nthe lives of Rome’s best citizens, against the sanctity of her most solemn\r\ntemples, the safety of her domestic hearths, the majesty of her inviolable\r\nlaws, the very existence of her institutions, of her empire, of herself as\r\none among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nMost suitable, indeed, was that dim murky night, most favorable the\r\nsolitude of the deserted streets, to the measures of those parricides of\r\nthe Republic, who lurked within her bosom, thirsty for blood, and panting\r\nto destroy. Nor had they overlooked the opportunity. But a few days\r\nremained before that on which the Consular elections, fixed for the\r\neighteenth of October, were to take place in the Campus Martius—whereat,\r\nit was already understood that Sergius Cataline, frustrated the preceding\r\nyear, by the election of the great orator of Arpinum to his discomfiture,\r\nwas about once more to try the fortunes of himself and of the popular\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nIt was at this untimely hour, that a man might have been seen lurking\r\nbeneath the shadows of an antique archway, decorated with half-obliterated\r\nsculptures of the old Etruscan school, in one of the narrow and winding\r\nstreets which, lying parallel to the Suburra, ran up the hollow between\r\nthe Viminal and Quirinal hills.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall and well-framed figure, though so lean as to seem almost\r\nemaciated. His forehead was unusually high and narrow, and channelled with\r\ndeep horizontal lines of thought and passion, across which cut at right\r\nangles the sharp furrows of a continual scowl, drawing the corners of his\r\nheavy coal-black eyebrows into strange contiguity. Beneath these, situated\r\nfar back in their cavernous recesses, a pair of keen restless eyes glared\r\nout with an expression fearful to behold—a jealous, and unquiet,\r\never-wandering glance—so sinister, and ominous, and above all so\r\nindicative of a perturbed and anguished spirit, that it could not be\r\nlooked upon without suggesting those wild tales, which speak of fiends\r\ndwelling in the revivified and untombed carcasses of those who die in\r\nunrepented sin. His nose was keenly Roman; with a deep wrinkle seared, as\r\nit would seem, into the sallow flesh from either nostril downward. His\r\nmouth, grimly compressed, and his jaws, for the most part, firmly clinched\r\ntogether, spoke volumes of immutable and iron resolution; while all his\r\nunder lip was scarred, in many places, with the trace of wounds, inflicted\r\nbeyond doubt, in some dread paroxysm, by the very teeth it covered.\r\n\r\nThe dress which this remarkable looking individual at that time wore, was\r\nthe _penula_, as it was called; a short, loose straight-cut overcoat,\r\nreaching a little way below the knees, not fitted to the shape, but looped\r\nby woollen frogs all down the front, with broad flaps to protect the arms,\r\nand a square cape or collar, which at the pleasure of the wearer could be\r\ndrawn up so as to conceal all the lower part of the countenance, or\r\nsuffered to fall down upon the shoulders.\r\n\r\nThis uncouth vestment, which was used only by men of the lowest order, or\r\nby others solely when engaged in long and toilsome journeys, or in cold\r\nwintry weather, was composed of a thick loose-napped frieze or serge, of a\r\ndark purplish brown, with loops and _fibulæ_, or frogs, of a dull dingy\r\nred.\r\n\r\nThe wearer’s legs were bare down to the very feet, which were protected by\r\ncoarse shoes of heavy leather, fastened about the ancles by a thong, with\r\na clasp of marvellously ill-cleaned brass. Upon his head he had a\r\n_petasus_, or broad-brimmed hat of gray felt, fitting close to the skull,\r\nwith a long fall behind, not very unlike in form to the south-wester of a\r\nmodern seaman. This article of dress was, like the penula, although\r\npeculiar to the inferior classes, oftentimes worn by men of superior rank,\r\nwhen journeying abroad. From these, therefore, little or no aid was given\r\nto conjecture, as to the station of the person, who now shrunk back into\r\nthe deepest gloom of the old archway, now peered out stealthily into the\r\nnight, grinding his teeth and muttering smothered imprecations against\r\nsome one, who had failed to meet him.\r\n\r\nThe shoes, however, of rude, ill-tanned leather, of a form and manufacture\r\nwhich was peculiar to the lowest artizans or even slaves, were such as no\r\nman of ordinary standing would under any circumstances have adopted. Yet\r\nif these would have implied that the wearer was of low plebeian origin,\r\nthis surmise was contradicted by several rings decked with gems of great\r\nprice and splendor—one a large deeply-engraved signet—which were\r\ndistinctly visible by their lustre on the fingers of both his hands.\r\n\r\nHis air and carriage too were evidently in accordance with the nobility of\r\nbirth implied by these magnificent adornments, rather than with the humble\r\nstation betokened by the rest of his attire.\r\n\r\nHis motions were quick, irritable, and incessant! His pace, as he stalked\r\nto and fro in the narrow area of the archway, was agitated, and uneven.\r\nNow he would stride off ten or twelve steps with strange velocity, then\r\npause, and stand quite motionless for perhaps a minute’s space, and then\r\nagain resume his walk with slow and faltering gestures, to burst forth\r\nonce again, as at the instigation of some goading spirit, to the same\r\nshort-lived energy and speed.\r\n\r\nMeantime, his color went and came; he bit his lip, till the blood trickled\r\ndown his clean shorn chin; he clinched his hands, and smote them heavily\r\ntogether, and uttered in a harsh hissing whisper the most appalling\r\nimprecations—on his own head—on him who had deceived him—on Rome, and all\r\nher myriads of inhabitants—on earth, and sea, and heaven—on everything\r\ndivine or human!\r\n\r\n\"The black plague ’light on the fat sleepy glutton!—nay, rather all the\r\nfiends and furies of deep Erebus pursue _me_!—me!—me, who was fool enough\r\nto fancy that aught of bold design or manly daring could rouse up the\r\ndull, adipose, luxurious loiterer from his wines—his concubines—his\r\nslumbers!—And now—the dire ones hunt him to perdition! Now, the seventh\r\nhour of night hath passed, and all await us at the house of Læca; and this\r\nfoul sluggard sottishly snores at home!\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was cursing yet, and smiting his broad chest, and gnashing his\r\nteeth in impotent malignity, suddenly a quick step became audible at a\r\ndistance. The sound fell on his ear sharpened by the stimulus of fiery\r\npassions and of conscious fear, long ere it could have been perceived by\r\nany ordinary listener.\r\n\r\n\"’Tis he,\" he said, \"’tis he at last—but no?\" he continued, after a pause\r\nof a second, during which he had stooped, and laid his ear close to the\r\nground, \"no! ’tis too quick and light for the gross Cassius. By all the\r\ngods! there are two! Can he, then, have betrayed me? No! no! By heavens!\r\nhe dare not!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time he started back into the darkest corner of the arch,\r\npulled up the cape of his cassock, and slouched the wide-brimmed hat over\r\nhis anxious lineaments; then pressing his body flat against the dusky\r\nwall, to which the color of his garments was in some sort assimilated, he\r\nawaited the arrival of the new-comers, perhaps hoping that if foreign to\r\nhis purpose they might pass by him in the gloom.\r\n\r\nAs the footsteps now sounded nearer, he thrust his right hand into the\r\nbosom of his cassock, and drew out a long broad two-edged dagger, or\r\nstiletto; and as he unsheathed it, \"Ready!\" he muttered to himself, \"ready\r\nfor either fortune!\"\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came the footsteps, and the blent sounds of the two were\r\nnow distinctly audible—one a slow, listless tread, as of one loitering\r\nalong, as if irresolute whether to turn back or proceed; the other a firm,\r\nrapid, and decided step.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! it is well!\" resumed the listener; \"Cassius it is; and with him comes\r\nCethegus, though where they have joined company I marvel.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he spoke, he put his weapon back into his girdle, where it was\r\nperfectly concealed by the folds of the penula.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!—stand!\" he whispered, as the two men whose steps he had heard,\r\nentered the archway, \"Stand, Friends and Brethren.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hail, Sergius!\" replied the foremost; a tall and splendidly formed man,\r\nwith a dark quick eye, and regular features, nobly chiselled and in all\r\nrespects such—had it not been for the bitter and ferocious sneer, which\r\ncurled his haughty lip, at every word—as might be termed eminently\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nHe wore his raven hair in long and flowing curls, which hung quite down\r\nupon his shoulders—a fashion that was held in Rome to the last degree\r\neffeminate, indeed almost infamous—while his trim whiskers and close curly\r\nbeard reeked with the richest perfumes, impregnating the atmosphere\r\nthrough which he passed with odors so strong as to be almost overpowering.\r\n\r\nHis garb was that of a patrician of the highest order; though tinctured,\r\nlike the arrangement of his hair, with not a little of that soft luxurious\r\ntaste which had, of latter years, begun so generally to pervade Rome’s\r\nyoung nobility. His under dress or tunic, was not of that succinct and\r\nnarrow cut, which had so well become the sturdy fathers of the new\r\nrepublic! but—beside being wrought of the finest Spanish wool of snowy\r\nwhiteness, with the broad crimson facings indicative of his senatorial\r\nrank, known as the laticlave—fell in loose folds half way between his knee\r\nand ancle.\r\n\r\nIt had sleeves, too, a thing esteemed unworthy of a man—and was fringed at\r\nthe cuffs, and round the hem, with a deep passmenting of crimson to match\r\nthe laticlave. His toga of the thinnest and most gauzy texture, and whiter\r\neven than his tunic, flowed in a series of classical and studied draperies\r\nquite to his heels, where like the tunic it was bordered by a broad\r\ncrimson trimming. His feet were ornamented, rather than protected, by\r\ndelicate buskins of black leather, decked with the silver _sigma_, in its\r\nold crescent shape, the proud initial of the high term senator. A golden\r\nbracelet, fashioned like a large serpent, exquisitely carved with horrent\r\nscales and forked tail, was twined about the wrist of his right arm, with\r\na huge carbuncle set in the head, and two rare diamonds for eyes. A dozen\r\nrings gemmed with the clearest brilliants sparkled upon his white and\r\ntapering fingers; in which, to complete the picture, he bore a\r\nhandkerchief of fine Egyptian cambric, or Byssus as the Romans styled it,\r\nembroidered at the edges in arabesques of golden thread.\r\n\r\nHis comrade was if possible more slovenly in his attire than his friend\r\nwas luxurious and expensive. He wore no toga, and his tunic—which, without\r\nthe upper robe, was the accustomed dress of gladiators, slaves, and such\r\nas were too poor to wear the full and characteristic attire of the Roman\r\ncitizen—was of dark brownish woollen, threadbare, and soiled with spots of\r\ngrease, and patched in many places. His shoes were of coarse clouted\r\nleather, and his legs were covered up to the knees by thongs of ill-tanned\r\ncowhide rolled round them and tied at the ancles with straps of the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\"A plague on both of you!\" replied the person, who had been so long\r\nawaiting them, in answer to their salutation. \"Two hours have ye detained\r\nme here; and now that ye have come, in pretty guise ye do come! Oh! by the\r\ngods! a well assorted pair. Cassius more filthy than the vilest and most\r\nbase tatterdemalion of the stews, and with him rare Cethegus, a senator in\r\nall his bravery! Wise judgment! excellent disguises! I know not whether\r\nmost to marvel at the insane and furious temerity of this one, or at the\r\nidiotic foolery of that! Well fitted are ye both for a great purpose. And\r\nnow—may the dark furies hunt you to perdition!—what hath delayed you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what a coil is here\", replied the gay Cethegus, delighted evidently\r\nat the unsuppressed anger of his confederate in crime, and bent on goading\r\nto yet more fiery wrath his most ungovernable temper. \"Methinks, O\r\npleasant Sergius, the moisture of this delectable night should have\r\nquenched somewhat the quick flames of your most amiable and placid humor!\r\nKeep thy hard words, I prithee, Cataline, for those who either heed or\r\ndread them. I, thou well knowest, do neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, peace! Cethegus; plague him no farther,\" interrupted Cassius, just\r\nas the fierce conspirator, exclaiming in a deep harsh whisper, the one\r\nword \"Boy!\" strode forth as if to strike him. \"And thou, good Cataline,\r\nlisten to reason—we have been dogged hitherward, and so came by circuitous\r\nbyeways!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dogged, said ye—dogged? and by whom?—doth the slave live, who dared it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By a slave, as we reckon,\" answered Cassius, \"for he wore no toga; and\r\nhis tunic\"—\r\n\r\n\"Was filthy—very filthy, by the gods!—most like thine own, good Cassius,\"\r\ninterposed Cethegus. \"But, in good sooth, he _was_ a slave, my Sergius. He\r\npassed us twice, before I thought much of it. Once as we crossed the\r\nsacred way after descending from the Palatine—and once again beside the\r\nshrine of Venus in the Cyprian street. The second time he gazed into my\r\nvery eyes, until he caught my glance meeting his own, and then with a\r\nquick bounding pace he hurried onward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush!\" answered Cataline, \"tush! was that all? the knave was a chance\r\nnight-walker, and frightened ye! Ha! ha! by Hercules! it makes me\r\nlaugh—frightened the rash and overbold Cethegus!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not all!\" replied Cethegus very calmly, \"it was not all, Cataline.\r\nAnd, but that we are joined here in a purpose so mighty that it overwhelms\r\nall private interests, all mere considerations of the individual, you, my\r\ngood sir, should learn what it is to taunt a man with fear, who fears not\r\nanything—least of all thee! But it was not all. For as we turned from a\r\nside lane into the Wicked(1) street that scales the summit of the\r\nEsquiline, my eye caught something lurking in the dark shadow cast over an\r\nangle of the wall by a large cypress. I seized the arm of Cassius, to\r\ncheck his speech\"—\r\n\r\n\"Ha! did the fat idiot speak?—what said he?\" interrupted Cataline.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied the other, \"nothing, at least, of any moment. Well, I\r\ncaught Cassius by the arm, and was in the act of pointing, when from the\r\nshadows of the tree out sprang this self-same varlet, whereon I——\".\r\n\r\n\"Rushed on him! dragged him into the light! and smote him, thus, and thus,\r\nand thus! didst thou not, excellent Cethegus?\" Cataline exclaimed fiercely\r\nin a hard stern whisper, making three lounges, while he spoke, as if with\r\na stiletto.\r\n\r\n\"I did not any of these things,\" answered the other.\r\n\r\n\"And why not, I say, why not? why not?\" cried Cataline with rude\r\nimpetuosity.\r\n\r\n\"That shall I answer, when you give me time,\" said Cethegus, coolly.\r\n\"Because when I rushed forth, he fled with an exceeding rapid flight;\r\nleaped the low wall into the graveyard of the base Plebeians, and there\r\namong the cypresses and overthrown sepulchres escaped me for a while. I\r\nbeat about most warily, and at length started him up again from the jaws\r\nof an obscene and broken catacomb. I gained on him at every step; heard\r\nthe quick panting of his breath; stretched out my left to grasp him, while\r\nmy right held unsheathed and ready the good stiletto that ne’er failed me.\r\nAnd now—now—by the great Jove! his tunic’s hem was fluttering in my\r\nclutch, when my feet tripped over a prostrate column, that I was hurled\r\nfive paces at the least in advance of the fugitive; and when I rose again,\r\nsore stunned, and bruised, and breathless, the slave had vanished.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where, I prithee, during this well-concerted chase, was valiant\r\nCassius?\" enquired Cataline, with a hoarse sneering laugh.\r\n\r\n\"During the chase, I knew not,\" answered Cethegus, \"but when it was over,\r\nand I did return, I found him leaning on the wall, even in the angle\r\nwhence the slave fled on our approach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Asleep! I warrant me—by the great gods! asleep!\" exclaimed the other;\r\n\"but come!—come, let us onward,—I trow we have been waited for—and as we\r\ngo, tell me, I do beseech thee, what was’t that Cassius said, when the\r\nslave lay beside ye?—\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but I have forgotten—some trivial thing or other—oh! now I do\r\nbethink me, he said it was a long walk to Marcus Læca’s.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool! fool! Double and treble fool! and dost thou call this nothing?\r\nNothing to tell the loitering informer the very head and heart of our\r\ndesign? By Erebus! but I am sick—sick of the fools, with whom I am thus\r\nwretchedly assorted! Well! well! upon your own heads be it!\" and instantly\r\nrecovering his temper he walked on with his two confederates, now in deep\r\nsilence, at a quick pace through the deserted streets towards their\r\nperilous rendezvous.\r\n\r\nNoiseless, with stealthy steps, they hurried onward, threading the narrow\r\npass between the dusky hills, until they reached a dark and filthy lane\r\nwhich turning at right angles led to the broad thoroughfare of the more\r\nshowy, though by no means less ill-famed Suburra. Into this they struck\r\ninstantly, walking in single file, and keeping as nearly as possible in\r\nthe middle of the causeway. The lane, which was composed of dwellings of\r\nthe lowest order, tenanted by the most abject profligates, was dark as\r\nmidnight; for the tall dingy buildings absolutely intercepted every ray of\r\nlight that proceeded from the murky sky, and there was not a spark in any\r\nof the sordid casements, nor any votive lamp in that foul alley. The only\r\nglimpse of casual illumination, and that too barely serving to render the\r\ndarkness and the filth perceptible, was the faint streak of lustre where\r\nthe Suburra crossed the far extremity of the bye-path.\r\n\r\nScarce had they made three paces down the alley, ere the quick eye of\r\nCataline, for ever roving in search of aught suspicious, caught the dim\r\noutline of a human figure, stealing across this pallid gleam.\r\n\r\n\"Hist! hist!\" he whiskered in stern low tones, which though inaudible at\r\nthree yards’ distance completely filled the ears of him to whom they were\r\naddressed—\"hist! hist! Cethegus; seest thou not—seest thou not there? If\r\nit be he, he ’scapes us not again!—out with thy weapon, man, and strike at\r\nonce, if that thou have a chance; but if not, do thou go on with Cassius\r\nto the appointed place. Leave him to me! and say, I follow ye! See! he\r\nhath slunk into the darkness. Separate ye, and occupy the whole width of\r\nthe street, while I dislodge him!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke, unsheathing his broad poignard, but holding it concealed\r\nbeneath his cassock, he strode on boldly, affecting the most perfect\r\nindifference, and even insolence of bearing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the half-seen figure had entirely disappeared amid the gloom;\r\nyet had the wary eye of the conspirator, in the one momentary glance he\r\nhad obtained, been able to detect with something very near to certainty\r\nthe spot wherein the spy, if such he were, lay hidden. As he approached\r\nthe place—whereat a heap of rubbish, the relics of a building not long ago\r\nas it would seem consumed by fire, projected far into the street—seeing no\r\nsign whatever of the man who, he was well assured, was not far distant, he\r\npaused a little so as to suffer his companions to draw near. Then as they\r\ncame up with him, skilled in all deep and desperate wiles, he instantly\r\ncommenced a whispered conversation, a tissue of mere nonsense, with here\r\nand there a word of seeming import clearly and audibly pronounced. Nor was\r\nhis dark manœuvre unsuccessful; for as he uttered the word \"Cicero,\"\r\nwatching meanwhile the heap of ruins as jealously as ever tiger glared on\r\nits destined prey, he caught a tremulous outline; and in a second’s space,\r\na small round object, like a man’s head, was protruded from the darkness,\r\nand brought into relief against the brighter back ground.\r\n\r\nThen—then—with all the fury—all the lythe agile vigor, all the unrivalled\r\nspeed, and concentrated fierceness of that tremendous beast of prey, he\r\ndashed upon his victim! But at the first slight movement of his sinewy\r\nform, the dimly seen shape vanished; impetuously he rushed on among the\r\npiles of scattered brick and rubbish, and, ere he saw the nature of the\r\nplace, plunged down a deep descent into the cellar of the ruin.\r\n\r\nLucky was it for Cataline, and most unfortunate for Rome, that when the\r\nbuilding fell, its fragments had choked three parts of the depth of that\r\nsubterranean vault; so that it was but from a height of three or four feet\r\nat the utmost, that the fierce desperado was precipitated!\r\n\r\nStill, to a man less active, the accident might have been serious, but\r\nwith instinctive promptitude, backed by a wonderful exertion of muscular\r\nagility, he writhed his body even in the act of falling so that he lighted\r\non his feet; and, ere a second had elapsed after his fall, was extricating\r\nhimself from the broken masses of cement and brickwork, and soon stood\r\nunharmed, though somewhat stunned and shaken, on the very spot which had\r\nbeen occupied scarcely a minute past by the suspected spy.\r\n\r\nAt the same point of time in which the conspirator fell, the person,\r\nwhosoever he was, in pursuit of whom he had plunged so heedlessly into the\r\nruins, darted forth from his concealment close to the body and within\r\narm’s length of the fierce Cethegus, whose attention was for the moment\r\ndistracted from his watch by the catastrophe which had befallen his\r\ncompanion. Dodging by a quick movement—so quick that it seemed almost the\r\nresult of instinct—so to elude the swift attempt of his enemy to arrest\r\nhis progress, the spy was forced to rush almost into the arms of Cassius.\r\n\r\nYet this appeared not to cause him any apprehension; for he dashed boldly\r\non, till they were almost front to front; when, notwithstanding his\r\nunwieldy frame and inactivity of habit, spurred into something near to\r\nenergy by the very imminence of peril, the worn-out debauchee bestirred\r\nhimself as if to seize him.\r\n\r\nIf such, however, were his intention, widely had he miscalculated his own\r\npowers, and fatally underrated the agility and strength of the stranger—a\r\ntall, thin, wiry man, well nigh six feet in height, broad shouldered, and\r\ndeep chested, and thin flanked, and limbed like a Greek Athlete.\r\n\r\nOn he dashed!—on—right on! till they stood face to face; and then with one\r\nquick blow, into which, as it seemed, he put but little of his strength,\r\nhe hurled the burly Cassius to the earth, and fled with swift and\r\nnoiseless steps into the deepest gloom. Perceiving on the instant the\r\nnecessity of apprehending this now undoubted spy, the fiery Cethegus\r\npaused not one instant to look after his discomfited companions; but\r\nrushed away on the traces of the fugitive, who had perhaps gained, at the\r\nvery utmost, a dozen paces’ start of him, in that wild midnight race—that\r\nrace for life and death.\r\n\r\nThe slave, for such from his dark tunic he appeared to me, was evidently\r\nboth a swift and practised runner; and well aware how great a stake was on\r\nhis speed he now strained every muscle to escape, while scarce less fleet,\r\nand straining likewise every sinew to the utmost, Cethegus panted at his\r\nvery heels.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, they had run sixty yards, one swifter than Cethegus took\r\nup the race; and bruised although he was, and stunned, and almost\r\nbreathless when he started, ere he had overtaken his staunch friend, which\r\nhe did in a space wonderfully brief, he seemed to have shaken off every\r\nailment, and to be in the completest and most firm possession of all his\r\nwonted energies. As he caught up Cethegus, he relaxed somewhat of his\r\nspeed, and ran on by his side for some few yards at a sort of springy\r\ntrot, speaking the while in a deep whisper,\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" he said, \"hist!—I am more swift of foot than thou, and deeper\r\nwinded. Leave me to deal with this dog! Back thou, to him thou knowest of;\r\nsore is he hurt, I warrant me. Comfort him as thou best mayest, and hurry\r\nwhither we were now going. ’Tis late even now—too late, I fear me much,\r\nand doubtless we are waited for. I have the heels of this same\r\ngallowsbird, that can I see already! Leave me to deal with him, and an he\r\ntells tales on us, then call me liar!\"\r\n\r\nAlready well nigh out of breath himself, while the endurance of the\r\nfugitive seemed in nowise affected, and aware of the vast superiority of\r\nhis brother conspirator’s powers to his own, Cethegus readily enough\r\nyielded to his positive and reiterated orders, and turning hastily\r\nbackward, gathered up the bruised and groaning Cassius, and led him with\r\nall speed toward the well-known rendezvous in the house of Læca.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile with desperate speed that headlong race continued; the gloomy\r\nalley was passed through; the wider street into which it debouched,\r\nvanished beneath their quick beating footsteps; the dark and shadowy arch,\r\nwherein the chief conspirator had lurked, was threaded at full speed; and\r\nstill, although he toiled, till the sweat dripped from every pore like\r\ngouts of summer rain, although he plied each limb, till every over-wrought\r\nsinew seemed to crack, the hapless fugitive could gain no ground on his\r\ninveterate pursuer; who, cool, collected and unwearied, without one drop\r\nof perspiration on his dark sallow brow, without one panting sob in his\r\ndeep breath, followed on at an equable and steady pace, gaining not any\r\nthing, nor seeming to desire to gain any thing, while yet within the\r\nprecincts of the populous and thickly-settled city.\r\n\r\nBut now they crossed the broad Virbian street. The slave, distinctly\r\nvisible for such, as he glanced by a brightly decorated shrine girt by so\r\nmany brilliant lamps as shewed its tenant idol to have no lack of\r\nworshippers, darted up a small street leading directly towards the\r\nEsquiline.\r\n\r\n\"Now! now!\" lisped Cataline between his hard-set teeth, \"now he is mine,\r\npast rescue!\"\r\n\r\nUp the dark filthy avenue they sped, the fierce pursuer now gaining on the\r\nfugitive at every bound; till, had he stretched his arm out, he might have\r\nseized him; till his breath, hot and strong, waved the disordered\r\nelf-locks that fell down upon the bare neck of his flying victim. And now\r\nthe low wall of the Plebeian burying ground arose before them, shaded by\r\nmighty cypresses and overgrown with tangled ivy. At one wild bound the\r\nhunted slave leaped over it, into the trackless gloom. At one wild bound\r\nthe fierce pursuer followed him. Scarcely a yard asunder they alighted on\r\nthe rank grass of that charnel grove; and not three paces did they take\r\nmore, ere Cataline had hurled his victim to the earth, and cast himself\r\nupon him; choking his cries for help by the compression of his sinewy\r\nfingers, which grasped with a tenacity little inferior to that of an iron\r\nvice the miserable wretch’s gullet.\r\n\r\nHe snatched his poniard from his sheath, reared it on high with a well\r\nskilled and steady hand! Down it came, noiseless and unseen. For there was\r\nnot a ray of light to flash along its polished blade. Down it came with\r\nalmost the speed and force of the electric fluid. A deep, dull, heavy\r\nsound was heard, as it was plunged into the yielding flesh, and the hot\r\ngushing blood spirted forth in a quick jet into the very face and mouth of\r\nthe fell murderer. A terrible convulsion, a fierce writhing spasm\r\nfollowed—so strong, so muscularly powerful, that the stern gripe of\r\nCataline was shaken from the throat of his victim, and from his dagger’s\r\nhilt!\r\n\r\nIn the last agony the murdered man cast off his slayer from his breast;\r\nstarted erect upon his feet! tore out, from the deep wound, the fatal\r\nweapon which had made it; hurled it far—far as his remaining strength\r\npermitted—into the rayless night; burst forth into a wild and yelling cry,\r\nhalf laughter and half imprecation; fell headlong to the earth—which was\r\nno more insensible than he, what time he struck it, to any sense of mortal\r\npain or sorrow—and perished there alone, unpitied and unaided.\r\n\r\n\"HABET!—he hath it!\" muttered Cataline, quoting the well-known expression\r\nof the gladiatorial strife; \"he hath it!—but all the plagues of Erebus,\r\nlight on it—my good stiletto lies near to him in the swart darkness, to\r\ntestify against me; nor by great Hecate! is there one chance to ten of\r\nfinding it. Well! be it so!\" he added, turning upon his heel, \"be it so,\r\nfor most like it hath fallen in the deep long grass, where none will ever\r\nfind it; and if they do, I care not!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a reckless and unmoved demeanor, well pleased with his success,\r\nand casting not one retrospective thought toward his murdered victim, not\r\none repentant sigh upon his awful crime, he too hurried away to join his\r\ndread associates at their appointed meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEASURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n          For what then do they pause?\r\n               An hour to strike.\r\n                    MARINO FALIERO.\r\n\r\nThe hours of darkness had already well nigh passed, and but for the thick\r\nstorm-clouds and the drizzling rain, some streaks of early dawn might have\r\nbeen seen on the horizon, when at the door of Marcus Læca, in the low\r\ngrovelling street of the Scythemakers—strange quarter for the residence of\r\na patrician, one of the princely Porcii—the arch-conspirator stood still,\r\nand glared around with keen suspicious eyes, after his hurried walk.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, yet as black as midnight; nor in that wretched and base\r\nsuburb, tenanted only by poor laborious artizans, was there a single\r\nartificial light to relieve the gloom of nature.\r\n\r\nThe house of Læca! How little would the passer-by who looked in those days\r\non its walls, decayed and moss-grown even then, and mouldering—how little\r\nwould he have imagined that its fame would go down to the latest ages,\r\nimperishable through its owner’s infamy.\r\n\r\nThe house of Læca! The days had been, while Rome was yet but young, when\r\nit stood far aloof in the gay green fields, the suburban villa of the\r\nproud Porcian house. Time passed, and fashions changed. Low streets and\r\nsqualid tenements supplanted the rich fields and fruitful orchards, which\r\nhad once rendered it so pleasant an abode. Its haughty lords abandoned it\r\nfor a more stately palace nigh the forum, and for long years it had\r\nremained tenantless, voiceless, desolate. But dice, and wine, and women,\r\nmad luxury and boundless riot, had brought its owner down to indigence,\r\nand infamy and sin.\r\n\r\nThe palace passed away from its inheritor. The ruin welcomed its last\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nAnd here, meet scene for orgies such as it beheld, Rome’s parricides were\r\nwont to hold their murderous assemblies.\r\n\r\nWith a slow stealthy tread, that woke no echo, Cataline advanced to the\r\ndoor. There was no lamp in the cell of the atriensis; no sign of\r\nwakefulness in any of the casements; yet at the first slight tap upon the\r\nstout oaken pannel, although it was scarce louder than the plash of the\r\nbig raindrops from the eaves, another tap responded to it from within, so\r\nfaint that it appeared an echo of the other. The rebel counted, as fast as\r\npossible, fifteen; and then tapped thrice as he had done before, meeting\r\nthe same reply, a repetition of his own signal. After a moment’s interval,\r\na little wicket opened in the door, and a low voice asked \"Who?\" In the\r\nsame guarded tone the answer was returned, \"Cornelius.\" Again the voice\r\nasked, \"Which?\" and instantly, as Cataline replied, \"the third,\" the door\r\nflew open, and he entered.\r\n\r\nThe Atrium, or wide hall in which he stood, was all in utter darkness;\r\nthere was no light on the altar of the Penates, which was placed by the\r\n_impluvium_—a large shallow tank of water occupying the centre of the hall\r\nin all Roman houses—nor any gleam from the _tablinum_, or closed gallery\r\nbeyond, parted by heavy curtains from the audience chamber.\r\n\r\nThere were no stars to glimmer through the opening in the roof above the\r\ncentral tank, yet the quick eye of the conspirator perceived, upon the\r\ninstant, that two strong men with naked swords, their points within a\r\nhand’s breadth of his bosom, stood on each side of the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe gate was closed as silently as it had given him entrance; was barred\r\nand bolted; and till then no word was interchanged. When all, however, was\r\nsecure, a deep rich voice, suppressed into a whisper, exclaimed \"Sergius?\"\r\n\"Ay!\" answered Cataline. \"Come on!\" and without farther parley they stole\r\ninto the most secret chambers of the house, fearful as it appeared of the\r\nsounds of their own footsteps, much more of their own voices.\r\n\r\nThus with extreme precaution, when they had traversed several chambers,\r\namong which were an indoor _triclinium_, or dining parlor, and a vast\r\npicture gallery, groping their way along in utter darkness, they reached a\r\nsmall square court, surrounded by a peristyle or colonnade, containing a\r\ndilapidated fountain. Passing through this, they reached a second dining\r\nroom, where on the central table they found a small lamp burning, and by\r\nthe aid of this, though still observing the most scrupulous silence,\r\nquickly attained their destination—a low and vaulted chamber entirely\r\nbelow the surface of the ground, accessible only by a stair defended by\r\ntwo doors of unusual thickness.\r\n\r\nThat was a fitting place for deeds of darkness, councils of desperation,\r\nsuch as they held, who met within its gloomy precincts. The moisture,\r\nwhich dripped constantly from its groined roof of stone, had formed\r\nstalactites of dingy spar, whence the large gouts plashed heavily on the\r\ndamp pavement; the walls were covered with green slimy mould; the\r\natmosphere was close and fœtid, and so heavy that the huge waxen torches,\r\nfour of which stood in rusty iron candelabra, on a large slab of granite,\r\nburned dim and blue, casting a faint and ghastly light on lineaments so\r\ngrim and truculent, or so unnaturally excited by the dominion of all\r\nhellish passions, that they had little need of anything extraneous to\r\nrender them most hideous and appalling. There were some twenty-five men\r\npresent, variously clad indeed, and of all ages, but evidently—though many\r\nhad endeavoured to disguise the fact by poor and sordid garments—all of\r\nthe higher ranks.\r\n\r\nSix or eight were among them, who feared not, nor were ashamed to appear\r\nthere in the full splendor of their distinctive garb as Senators,\r\nprominent among whom was the most rash and furious of them all, Cethegus.\r\n\r\nHe, at the moment when the arch-conspirator, accompanied by Læca and the\r\nrest of those who had admitted him, entered the vault, was speaking with\r\nmuch energy and even fierceness of manner to three or four who stood apart\r\na little from the rest with their backs to the door, listening with\r\nknitted brows, clenched hands, and lips compressed and bloodless, to his\r\ntremendous imprecations launched at the heads of all who were for any,\r\neven the least, delay in the accomplishment of their dread scheme of\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nOne among them was a large stately looking personage, somewhat inclined to\r\ncorpulence, but showing many a sign of giant strength, and vigor\r\nunimpaired by years or habit. His head was large but well shaped, with a\r\nbroad and massive forehead, and an eye keen as the eagle’s when soaring in\r\nhis pride of place. His nose was prominent, but rather aquiline than\r\nRoman. His mouth, wide and thick-lipped, with square and fleshy jaws, was\r\nthe worst feature in his face, and indicative of indulged sensuality and\r\nfierceness, if not of cruelty combined with the excess of pride.\r\n\r\nThis man wore the plain toga and white tunic of a private citizen; but\r\nnever did plebeian eye and lip flash with such concentrated haughtiness,\r\ncurl with so fell a sneer, as those of that fallen consular, of that\r\ndegraded senator, the haughtiest and most ambitious of a race never\r\ndeficient in those qualities, he who, drunk with despairing pride, and\r\ndeceived to his ruin by the double-tongued Sibylline prophecies, aspired\r\nto be that third Cornelius, who should be master of the world’s mistress,\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nThe others were much younger men, for Lentulus was at that period already\r\npast his prime, and these—two more especially who looked mere boys—had\r\nscarcely reached youth’s threshold; though their pale withered faces, and\r\nbrows seared deeply by the scorching brand of evil passions, showed that\r\nin vice at least, if not in years, they had lived long already.\r\n\r\nThose two were senators in their full garniture, the sons of Servius\r\nSylla, both beautiful almost as women, with soft and feminine features,\r\nand long curled hair, and lips of coral, from which in flippant and\r\naffected accents fell words, and breathed desires, that would have made\r\nthe blood stop and turn stagnant at the heart of any one, not utterly\r\npolluted and devoid of every humane feeling.\r\n\r\nThis little knot seemed fierce for action, fiery and panting with that\r\nwolfish thirst, to quench which blood must flow. But all the rest seemed\r\ndumb, and tongue-tied, and crest-fallen. The sullenness of fear brooded on\r\nevery other face. The torpor of despairing crime, already in its own fancy\r\nbaffled and detected, had fallen on every other heart. For, at the farther\r\nend of the room, whispering to his trembling hearers dubious and dark\r\nsuspicions, with terror on his tongue, stood Cassius, exaggerating the\r\nadventures of the night.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene, when Cataline stalked into that bad conclave. The\r\nfires of hell itself could send forth no more blasting glare, than shot\r\nfrom his dark eyes, as he beheld, and read at half a glance their\r\nconsternation. Bitter and blighting was the sneer upon his lip, as he\r\nstood motionless, gazing upon them for a little space. Then flinging his\r\narm on high and striding to the table he dashed his hand upon it, that it\r\nrang and quivered to the blow.\r\n\r\n\"What are ye?\" he said slowly, in tones that thrilled to every heart, so\r\npiercing was their emphasis. \"Men?—No, by the Gods! men rush on death for\r\nglory!—Women? They risk it, for their own, their children’s, or their\r\nlover’s safety!—Slaves?—Nay! even these things welcome it for freedom, or\r\nmeet it with revenge! Less then, than men! than women, slaves, or\r\nbeasts!—Perish like cattle, if ye will, unbound but unresisting, all armed\r\nbut unavenged!—And ye—great Gods! I laugh to see your terror-blanched,\r\nblank visages. I laugh, but loathe in laughing! The destined dauntless\r\nsacrificers, who would imbue your knives in senatorial, consular gore!\r\nkindle your altars on the downfallen Capitol! and build your temples on\r\nthe wreck of Empire! Ha! do you start? and does some touch of shame redden\r\nthe sallow cheeks that courage had left bloodless? and do ye grasp your\r\ndaggers, and rear your drooping heads? are ye men, once again? Why should\r\nye not? what do ye see, what hear, whereat to falter? What oracle, what\r\nportent? Now, by the Gods! methought they spoke of victory and glory. Once\r\nmore, what do ye fear, or wish? What, in the name of Hecate and Hades!\r\nWhat do ye wait for?\"\r\n\r\n\"A leader!\" answered the rash Cethegus, excited now even beyond the bounds\r\nof ordinary rashness. \"A day, a place, a signal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have them, then, all,\" replied the other, still half scornfully. \"Lo! I\r\nam here to lead; the field of Mars will give a place; the consular\r\nelections an occasion; the blood of Cicero a signal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so!\" instantly replied Cethegus; \"be it so! thou hast spoken, as\r\nthe times warrant, boldly; and upon my head be it, that our deeds shall\r\nrespond to thy daring words, with equal daring!\"\r\n\r\nAnd a loud hum of general assent succeeded to his stirring accents; and a\r\nquick fluttering sound ran through the whole assemblage, as every man,\r\nreleased from the constraint of deep and silent expectation, altered his\r\nposture somewhat, and drew a long breath at the close. But the conspirator\r\npaused not. He saw immediately the effect which had been made upon the\r\nminds of all, by what had passed. He perceived the absolute necessity of\r\nfollowing that impulse up to action, before, by a revulsion no less sudden\r\nthan the late change from despondency to fierceness, their minds should\r\nagain subside into the lethargy of doubt and dismay.\r\n\r\n\"But say thou, Sergius,\" he continued, \"how shall it be, and who shall\r\nstrike the blow that is to seal Rome’s liberty, our vengeance?\"\r\n\r\n\"First swear we!\" answered Cataline. \"Læca, the eagle, and the bowl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lo! they are here, my Sergius,\" answered the master of the house, drawing\r\naside a piece of crimson drapery, which covered a small niche or recess in\r\nthe wall, and displaying by the movement a silver eagle, its pinions wide\r\nextended, and its talons grasping a thunderbolt, placed on a pedestal,\r\nunder a small but exquisitely sculptured shrine of Parian marble. Before\r\nthe image there stood a votive lamp, fed by the richest oils, a mighty\r\nbowl of silver half filled with the red Massic wine, and many _pateræ_, or\r\nsacrificial vessels of a yet richer metal.\r\n\r\n\"Hear, bird of Mars, and of Quirinus\"—cried Cataline, without a pause,\r\nstretching his hands toward the glittering effigy—\"Hear thou, and be\r\npropitious! Thou, who didst all-triumphant guide a yet greater than\r\nQuirinus to deeds of might and glory; thou, who wert worshipped by the\r\ncharging shout of Marius, and consecrated by the gore of Cimbric myriads;\r\nthou, who wert erst enshrined on the Capitoline, what time the proud\r\npatricians veiled their haughty crests before the conquering plebeian;\r\nthou, who shalt sit again sublime upon those ramparts, meet aery for thine\r\nunvanquished pinion; shalt drink again libations, boundless libations of\r\nrich Roman life-blood, hot from patrician hearts, smoking from every\r\nkennel! Hear and receive our oaths—listen and be propitious!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and seizing from the pedestal a sacrificial knife, which lay\r\nbeside the bowl, opened a small vein in his arm, and suffered the warm\r\nstream to gush into the wine. While the red current was yet flowing, he\r\ngave the weapon to Cethegus, and he did likewise, passing it in his turn\r\nto the conspirator who stood beside him, and he in like manner to the\r\nnext, till each one in his turn had shed his blood into the bowl, which\r\nnow mantled to the brim with a foul and sacrilegious mixture, the richest\r\nvintage of the Massic hills, curdled with human gore.\r\n\r\nThen filling out a golden goblet for himself, \"Hear, God of war,\" cried\r\nCataline, \"unto whose minister and omen we offer daily worship; hear,\r\nmighty Mars, the homicide and the avenger; and thou, most ancient goddess,\r\nhear, Nemesis! and Hecate, and Hades! and all ye powers of darkness,\r\nFuries and Fates, hear ye! For unto ye we swear, never to quench the\r\ntorch; never to sheath the brand; till all our foes be prostrate, till not\r\none drop shall run in living veins of Rome’s patricians; till not one\r\nhearth shall warm; one roof shall shelter; till Rome shall be like\r\nCarthage, and we, like mighty Marius, lords and spectators of her\r\ndesolation! We swear! we taste the consecrated cup! and thus may his blood\r\nflow, who shall, for pity or for fear, forgive or fail or falter—his own\r\nblood, and his wife’s, and that of all his race forever! May vultures tear\r\ntheir eyes, yet fluttering with quick vision; may wolves tug at their\r\nheart-strings, yet strong with vigorous life; may infamy be their\r\ninheritance, and Tartarus receive their spirits!\"\r\n\r\nAnd while he spoke, he sipped the cup of horror with unreluctant lips, and\r\ndashed the goblet with the residue over the pedestal and shrine. And there\r\nwas not one there who shrank from that foul draught. With ashy cheeks\r\nindeed, but knitted brows, and their lips reeking red with the\r\nabomination, but fearless and unfaltering, they pledged in clear and\r\nsolemn tones, each after each, that awful imprecation, and cast their\r\ngoblets down, that the floor swam in blood; and grasped each others’\r\nhands, sworn comrades from that hour even to the gates of hell.\r\n\r\nA long and impressive silence followed. For every heart there, even of the\r\nboldest, recoiled as it were for a moment on itself, not altogether in\r\nregret or fear, much less in anything approaching to compunction or\r\nremorse; but in a sort of secret horror, that they were now involved\r\nbeyond all hope of extrication, beyond all possibility of turning back or\r\nhalting! And Cataline, endowed with almost superhuman shrewdness, and\r\nhimself quite immovable of purpose, perceived the feelings that actuated\r\nall the others—which he felt not, nor cared for—and called on Læca to\r\nbring wine.\r\n\r\n\"Wine, comrades,\" he exclaimed, \"pure, generous, noble wine, to wash away\r\nthe rank drops from our lips, that are more suited to our blades! to make\r\nour veins leap cheerily to the blythe inspiration of the God! and last,\r\nnot least, to guard us from the damps of this sweet chamber, which alone\r\nof his bounteous hospitality our Porcius has vouchsafed to us!\" And on the\r\ninstant, the master—for they dared trust no slaves—bore in two earthen\r\nvases, one of strong Chian from the Greek Isle of the Egean, the other of\r\nFalernian, the fruitiest and richest of the Italian wines, not much unlike\r\nthe modern sherry, but having still more body, and many cyathi, or\r\ndrinking cups; but he brought in no water, wherewith the more temperate\r\nancients were wont to mix their heady wines, even in so great a ratio as\r\nnine to one of the generous liquor.\r\n\r\n\"Fill now! fill all!\" cried Cataline, and with the word he drained a\r\nbrimming cup. \"Rare liquor this, my Marcus,\" he continued; \"whence had’st\r\nthou this Falernian? ’tis of thine inmost brand, I doubt not. In whose\r\nconsulship did it imbibe the smoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first of Caius Marius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-four years, a ripe age,\" said Cethegus, \"but twill be better forty\r\nyears hence. Strange, by the Gods! that of the two best things on earth,\r\nwomen and wine, the nature should so differ. The wine is crude still, when\r\nthe girl is mellow; but it is ripe, long after she is——\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotten, by Venus!\"—interposed Cæparius, swearing the harlot’s oath;\r\n\"Rotten, and in the lap of Lamia!\"\r\n\r\n\"But heard ye not,\" asked Cataline, \"or hearing, did ye not accept the\r\nomen!—in whose first Consulship this same Falernian jar was sealed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marius! By Hercules! an omen! oh, may it turn out well!\" exclaimed the\r\nsuperstitious Lentulus.\r\n\r\n\"Sayest thou, my Sura? well! drink we to the omen, and may we to the\r\nvalour and the principles of Marius unite the fortunes of his rival—of\r\nall-triumphant Sylla!\"\r\n\r\nA burst of acclamations replied to the happy hit, and seeing now his aim\r\nentirely accomplished, Cataline checked the revel; their blood was up; no\r\nfear of chilling counsels!\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" he said, \"before we drink like boon companions, let us consult\r\nlike men; there is need now of counsel; that once finished\"——\r\n\r\n\"Fulvia awaits me,\" interrupted Cassius, \"Fulvia, worth fifty revels!\"\r\n\r\n\"And me Sempronia,\" lisped the younger and more beautiful of the twin\r\nSylla.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" exclaimed Autronius, \"let us comprehend, so shall we need no\r\nfarther meetings—each of which risks the awakening of suspicion, and it\r\nmay well be of discovery. Let us now comprehend, that, when the time\r\ncomes, we may all perform our duty. Speak to us, therefore, Sergius.\"\r\n\r\nNo farther exhortation was required; for coolly the conspirator arose to\r\nset before his desperate companions, the plans which he had laid so\r\ndeeply, that it seemed scarcely possible that they should fail; and not a\r\nbreath or whisper interrupted him as he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"Were I not certain of the men,\" he said, \"to whom I speak, I could say\r\nmany things that should arouse you, so that you should catch with fiery\r\neagerness at aught that promised a more tolerable position. I could\r\nrecount the luxuries of wealth which you once knew; the agonies of poverty\r\nbeneath which, to no purpose, you lie groaning. I could point out your\r\nactual inability to live, however basely—deprived of character and\r\ncredit—devoid of any relics of your fortunes! weighed to the very earth by\r\ndebts, the interest alone of which has swallowed up your patrimonies, and\r\ngapes even yet for more! fettered by bail-bonds, to fly which is infamy,\r\nand to abide them ruin! shunned, scorned, despised, and hated, if not\r\nfeared by all men. I could paint, to your very eyes, ourselves in rags or\r\nfetters! our enemies in robes of office, seated on curule chairs, swaying\r\nthe fate of nations, dispensing by a nod the wealth of plundered\r\nprovinces! I could reverse the picture. But, as it is, your present\r\nmiseries and your past deeds dissuade me. Your hopelessness and daring,\r\nyour wrongs and valor, your injuries and thirst of vengeance, warn me,\r\nalike, that words are weak, and exhortation needless. Now understand with\r\nme, how matters stand. The stake for which we play, is fair before your\r\neyes:—learn how our throw for it is certain. The consular elections, as\r\nyou all well know, will be held, as proclaimed already, on the fifteenth\r\nday before the calends of November. My rivals are Sulpicius, Muræna, and\r\nSilanus. Antonius and Cicero will preside—the first, my friend! a bold and\r\nnoble Roman! He waits but an occasion to declare for us. Now, mark me.\r\nCaius Manlius—you all do know the man, an old and practised soldier, a\r\nscar-seamed veteran of Sylla,—will on that very day display yon eagle to\r\ntwenty thousand men, well armed, and brave, and desperate as ourselves, at\r\nFiesolè. Septimius of Camerinum writes from the Picene district, that\r\nthirty thousand slaves will rise there at his bidding; while Caius Julius,\r\nsent to that end into Apulia, has given out arms and nominated leaders to\r\ntwice five thousand there. Ere this, they have received my mandate to\r\ncollect their forces, and to march on that same day toward Rome. Three\r\nseveral armies, to meet which there is not one legion on this side of\r\nCisalpine Gaul! What, then, even if all were peace in Rome, what then\r\ncould stand against us? But there shall be that done here, here in the\r\nvery seat and heart, as I may say, of Empire, that shall dismay and\r\nparalyse all who would else oppose us. Cethegus, when the centuries are\r\nall assembled in the field of Mars, with fifteen hundred gladiators well\r\narmed and exercised even now, sets on the guard in the Janiculum, and\r\nbeats their standard down. Then, while all is confusion, Statilius and\r\nGabinius with their households,—whom, his work done, Cethegus will join\r\nstraightway—will fire the city in twelve several places, break open the\r\nprison doors, and crying \"Liberty to slaves!\" and \"Abolition of all\r\ndebts!\"—rush diverse throughout the streets, still gathering numbers as\r\nthey go. Meanwhile, with Lentulus and Cassius, the clients of your houses\r\nbeing armed beneath their togas with swords and breast-plates, and casques\r\nready to be donned, I will make sure of Cicero and the rest. Havoc, and\r\nslaughter, and flames every where will make the city ours. Then ye, who\r\nhave no duty set, hear, and mark this: always to kill is to do something!\r\nthe more, and nobler, so much the better deed! Remembering this, that sons\r\nhave ready access to their sires, who for the most part are their\r\nbitterest foes! and that to spare none we are sworn—how, and how deeply,\r\nit needs not to remind you. More words are bootless, since to all here it\r\nmust be evident that these things, planned thus far with deep and prudent\r\ncouncil, once executed with that dauntless daring, which alone stands for\r\narmor, and for weapons, and, by the Gods! for bulwarks of defence, must\r\nwin us liberty and glory, more over wealth, and luxury, and power, in\r\nwhich names is embraced the sum of all felicity. Therefore, now, I exhort\r\nyou not; for if the woes which you would shun, the prizes which you shall\r\nattain, exhort you not, all words of man, all portents of the Gods, are\r\ndumb, and voiceless, and in vain! Mark the day only, and remember, that if\r\nnot ye, at least your sires were Romans and were men!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravely, my Sergius, hast thou spoken, and well done!\" cried at once\r\nseveral voices of the more prominent partisans.\r\n\r\n\"By the Gods! what a leader!\" whispered Longinus Cassius to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n\"Fabius in council,\" cried Cethegus, \"Marcellus in the field!\"\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, fellow-soldiers,\" exclaimed Lentulus, \"hear this: although he\r\njoin not with us now, through policy, Antonius, the Consul, is in heart\r\nours, and waits but for the first success to declare himself for the cause\r\nin arms. Crassus, the rich—Cæsar, the people’s idol—have heard our\r\ncounsels, and approve them. The first blow struck, their influence, their\r\nnames, their riches, and their popularity, strike with us—trustier\r\nfriends, by Pollux! and more potent, than fifty thousand swordsmen!\"\r\n\r\nA louder and more general burst of acclamation and applause than that\r\nwhich had succeeded Cataline’s address, burst from the lips of all, as\r\nthose great names dropped from the tongue of Lentulus; and one voice cried\r\naloud—it was the voice of Curius, intoxicated as it were with present\r\ntriumph—\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods! Rome is our own! our own, even now, to portion out among\r\nour friends, our mistresses, our slaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Rome—but Rome’s inheritance, the world!\" exclaimed another. \"If we\r\nwin, all the universe is ours—and see how small the stake; when, if we\r\nfail\"—\r\n\r\n\"By Hades, we’ll not fail!\" Cataline interrupted him, in his deep\r\npenetrating tones. \"We cannot, and we will not! and now, for I wax\r\nsomewhat weary, we will break up this conclave. We meet at the comitia!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Slave?\" whispered Cethegus, with an inquiring accent, in his\r\near—\"the Slave, my Sergius?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will tell no tales of us,\" replied the other, with a hoarse laugh,\r\n\"unless it be to Lamia.\"\r\n\r\nThus they spoke as they left the house; and ere the day had yet begun to\r\nglimmer with the first morning twilight—so darkly did the clouds still\r\nmuster over the mighty city—went on their different ways toward their\r\nseveral homes, unseen, and, as they fondly fancied, unsuspected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Fair lovers, ye are fortunately met.\r\n                  MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM.\r\n\r\nOn the same night, and almost at the same hour of the night, wherein that\r\ndreadful conclave was assembled at the house of Læca, a small domestic\r\ngroup, consisting indeed only of three individuals, was gathered in the\r\ntablinum, or saloon, of an elegant though modest villa, situate in the\r\noutskirts of the city, fronting the street that led over the Mulvian\r\nbridge to the Æmilian way, and having a large garden communicating in the\r\nrear with the plebeian cemetery on the Esquiline.\r\n\r\nIt was a gay and beautiful apartment, of small dimensions, but replete\r\nwith all those graceful objects, those manifold appliances of refined\r\ntaste and pleasure, for which the Romans, austere and poor no longer, had,\r\nsince their late acquaintance with Athenian polish and Oriental luxury,\r\nacquired a predilection—ominous, as their sterner patriots fancied, of\r\npersonal degeneracy and national decay.\r\n\r\nDivided from the hall of reception by thick soft curtains, woven from the\r\nchoice wool of Calabria, and glowing with the richest hues of the Tyrian\r\ncrimson; and curtained with hangings of the same costly fabric around the\r\nwindows, both of which with the doorway opened upon a peristyle; that\r\nlittle chamber wore an air of comfort, that charmed the eye more even than\r\nits decorations. Yet these were of no common order; for the floor was\r\ntesselated in rare patterns of mosaic work, showing its exquisite devices\r\nand bright colors, where they were not concealed by a footstool of\r\nembroidered tapestry. The walls were portioned out into compartments, each\r\nframed by a broad border of gilded scroll-work on a crimson ground, and\r\ncontaining an elaborately finished fresco painting; which, could they have\r\nbeen seen by any critical eye of modern days, would have set at rest for\r\never the question as to the state of this art among the ancients. The\r\nsubject was a favorite one with all artists of all ages,—from the\r\nworld-famous Iliad: the story of the goddess-born Achilles. Here tutored\r\nby the wise Centaur, Chiron, in horsemanship and archery, and all that\r\nmakes a hero; here tearing off the virgin mitre, to don the glittering\r\ncasque proffered, with sword and buckler, among effeminate wares, by the\r\ndisguised Ulysses; there wandering in the despondent gloom of injured\r\npride along the stormy sea, meet listener to his haughty sorrows, while in\r\nthe distance, turning her tearful eyes back to her lord, Briseis went\r\nunwilling at the behest of the unwilling heralds. Again he was presented,\r\nmourning with frantic grief over the corpse of his beloved Patroclus—grief\r\nthat called up his Nereid mother from the blue depths of her native\r\nelement; and, in the last, chasing with unexampled speed the flying\r\nHector, who, stunned and destined by the Gods to ruin, dared not await his\r\nonset, while Priam veiled his face upon the ramparts, and Hecuba already\r\ntore her hair, presaging the destruction of Troy’s invincible unshaken\r\ncolumn.(2)\r\n\r\nA small wood fire blazed cheerfully upon the hearth, round which were\r\nclustered, in uncouth attitudes of old Etruscan sculpture, the grim and\r\ngrotesque figures of the household Gods. Two lamps of bronze, each with\r\nfour burners, placed on tall candelabra exquisitely carved in the same\r\nmetal, diffused a soft calm radiance through the room, accompanied by an\r\naromatic odor from the perfumed vegetable oil which fed their light. Upon\r\na circular table of dark-grained citrean wood, inlaid with ivory and\r\nsilver, were several rolls of parchment and papyrus, the books of the day,\r\nsome of them splendidly emblazoned and illuminated; a lyre of\r\ntortoiseshell, and near to it the slender plectrum by which its cords were\r\nwakened to melody. Two or three little flasks of agate and of onyx\r\ncontaining some choice perfumes, a Tuscan vase full of fresh-gathered\r\nflowers, and several articles yet more decidedly feminine, were scattered\r\non the board; needles, and thread of various hues, and twine of gold and\r\nsilver, and some embroidery, half finished, and as it would seem but that\r\ninstant laid aside. Such was the aspect of the saloon wherein three\r\npersons were sitting on that night; who, though they were unconscious,\r\nnay, even unsuspicious of the existence of conspiracy and treason, were\r\ndestined, ere many days should elapse, to be involved in its desperate\r\nmazes; to act conspicuous parts and undergo strange perils, in the dread\r\ndrama of the times.\r\n\r\nThey were of different years and sex—one, a magnificent and stately\r\nmatron, such as Rome’s matrons were when Rome was at the proudest, already\r\nwell advanced in years, yet still possessing not merely the remains of\r\nformer charms, but much of real beauty, and that too of the noblest and\r\nmost exalted order. Her hair, which had been black in her youth as the\r\nraven’s wing, was still, though mixed with many a line of silver,\r\nluxuriant and profuse as ever. Simply and closely braided over her broad\r\nand intellectual temples, and gathered into a thick knot behind, it\r\ndisplayed admirably the contour of her head, and suited the severe and\r\nclassic style of her strictly Roman features. The straight-cut eye-brows,\r\nthe clear and piercing eye, the aquiline nose, and the firm thin lips,\r\nspoke worlds of character and decision; yet that which might have\r\notherwise seemed stern and even harsh, was softened by a smile of singular\r\nsweetness, and by a lighting up of the whole countenance, which at times\r\nimparted to those high features an expression of benevolence, gentle and\r\nfeminine in the extreme.\r\n\r\nHer stature was well suited to the style of her lineaments; majestically\r\ntall and stately, and though attenuated something by the near approach of\r\nold age, preserving still the soft and flowing outlines of a form, which\r\nhad in youth been noted for roundness and voluptuous symmetry.\r\n\r\nShe wore the plain white robes, bordered and zoned with crimson, of a\r\npatrician lady, but save one massive signet on the third finger of her\r\nright hand she had no gem or ornament whatever; and as she sat a little\r\nway aloof from her younger companions, drawing the slender threads with\r\nmany a graceful motion from the revolving distaff into the basket by her\r\nside, she might have passed for her, whose proud prayer, that she might be\r\nknown not as the daughter of the Scipios but as the mother of the Gracchi,\r\nwas but too fatally fulfilled in the death-earned celebrity of those her\r\nboasted jewels.\r\n\r\nThe other lady was smaller, slighter, fairer, and altogether so different\r\nin mien, complexion, stature, and expression, that it was difficult even\r\nfor those who knew them well to believe that they were a mother and her\r\nonly child. For even in her flush of beauty, the elder lady, while in the\r\nfull splendor of Italian womanhood, must ever have been calculated to\r\ninspire admiration, not all unmixed with awe, rather than tenderness or\r\nlove. The daughter, on the other hand, was one whose every gesture, smile,\r\nword, glance, bespoke that passion latent in itself, which it awakened in\r\nthe bosom of all beholders.\r\n\r\nSlightly above the middle stature, and with a waist of scarce a span’s\r\ncircumference, her form was exquisitely full and rounded; the sweeping\r\noutlines of her snow-white and dimpled arms, bare to the shoulders, and\r\nset off by many strings of pearl, which were themselves scarcely whiter\r\nthan the skin on which they rested; the swan-like curvature of the\r\ndazzling neck; the wavy and voluptuous development of her bust, shrouded\r\nbut not concealed by the plaits of her white linen _stola_, fastened on\r\neither shoulder by a clasp of golden fillagree, and gathered just above\r\nher hips by a gilt zone of the Grecian fashion; the small and shapely\r\nfoot, which peered out with its jewelled sandal under her gold-fringed\r\ndraperies; combined to present to the eye a very incarnation of that ideal\r\nloveliness, which haunts enamored poets in their dreams, the girl just\r\nbursting out of girlhood, the glowing Hebe of the soft and sunny south.\r\nBut if her form was lovely, how shall the pen of mortal describe the wild\r\nromantic beauty of her soul-speaking features. The rich redundancy of her\r\ndark auburn hair, black where the shadows rested on it as the sable locks\r\nof night, but glittering out wherever a wandering ray glanced on its\r\nglossy surface like the bright tresses of Aurora. The broad and marble\r\nforehead, the pencilled brows, and the large liquid eyes fraught with a\r\nmild and lustrous languor; the cheeks, pale in their wonted mood as\r\nalabaster, yet eloquent at times with warm and passionate blushes. The\r\nlips, redder than aught on earth which shares both hue and softness; and,\r\nmore than all, the deep and indescribable expression which genius prints\r\non every lineament of those, who claim that rarest and most godlike of\r\nendowments.\r\n\r\nShe was a thing to dream of, not describe; to dream of in some faint and\r\nbreathless eve of early summer, beside the margin of some haunted\r\nstreamlet, beneath the shade of twilight boughs in which the fitful breeze\r\nawakes that whispering melody, believed by the poetic ancients to be the\r\nchorus of the wood-nymph; to dream of and adore—even as she was adored by\r\nhim who sat beside her, and watched each varying expression, that swept\r\nacross her speaking features; and hung upon each accent of the low silvery\r\nvoice, as if he feared it were the last to which his soul should thrill\r\nresponsive.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall and powerful youth of twenty-four or five years; yet, though\r\nhis limbs were sinewy and lithe, and though his deep round chest, thin\r\nflanks, and muscular shoulders gave token of much growing strength, it was\r\nstill evident that, his stature having been prematurely gained, he lacked\r\nmuch of that degree of power of which his frame gave promise. For though\r\nhis limbs were well formed they were scarcely set, or furnished, as we\r\nshould say in speaking of an animal; and the strength, which he in truth\r\npossessed, was that of elasticity and youthful vigor, capable rather of\r\nviolent though brief exertion, than that severe and trained robustness,\r\nwhich can for long continuous periods sustain the strongest and most\r\ntrying labor.\r\n\r\nHis hair was dark and curling—his eye bright, clear, and penetrating; yet\r\nwas its glance at times wavering and undetermined, such as would indicate\r\nperhaps a want of steadiness of purpose, not of corporeal resolution, for\r\nthat was disproved by one glance at the decided curve of his bold\r\nclean-cut mouth, and the square outlines of his massive jaw, which seemed\r\nalmost to betoken fierceness. There was a quick short flash at times, keen\r\nas the falcon’s, in the unsteady eye, that told of energy enough within\r\nand stirring spirit to prompt daring deeds, the momentary irresolution\r\nconquered. There was a frank and cheery smile that oftentimes belied the\r\nauguries drawn from the other features; and, more than all, there was a\r\ntranquil sweet expression, which now and then pervaded the whole\r\ncountenance, altering for the better its entire character, and betokening\r\nmore mind and deeper feelings, than would at first have been suspected\r\nfrom his aspect.\r\n\r\nHis dress was the ordinary tunic of the day, of plain white woollen stuff,\r\nbelted about the middle by a girdle, which contained his ivory tablets,\r\nand the metallic pencil used for writing on their waxed surface, together\r\nwith his handkerchief and purse; but nothing bearing the semblance of a\r\nweapon, not so much even as a common knife. His legs and arms were bare,\r\nhis feet being protected merely by sandals of fine leather having the\r\nclasps or fibulæ of gold; as was the buckle of his girdle, and one huge\r\nsignet ring, which was his only ornament.\r\n\r\nHis toga, which had been laid aside on entering the saloon, as was the\r\ncustom of the Romans in their own families, or among private friends, hung\r\non the back of an armed chair; of ample size and fine material, but\r\nundistinguished by the marks of senatorial or equestrian rank. Such was\r\nthe aspect, such the bearing of the youth, who might be safely deemed the\r\ngirl’s permitted suitor, from his whole air and manner, as he listened to\r\nthe soft voice of his beautiful mistress. For as they sat there side by\r\nside, perusing from an illuminated scroll the elegies of some\r\nlong-perished, long-forgotten poet, now reading audibly the smooth and\r\nhoneyed lines, now commenting with playful criticism on the style, or\r\ncarrying out with all the fervor and romance of young poetical temperament\r\nthe half obscure allusions of the bard, no one could doubt that they were\r\nlovers; especially if he marked the calm and well-pleased smile that stole\r\nfrom time to time across the proud features of that patrician lady; who,\r\nsitting but a little way apart, watched—while she reeled off skein after\r\nskein of the fine Byssine flax in silence—the quiet happiness of the young\r\npair.\r\n\r\nThus had the evening passed, not long nor tediously to any of the party;\r\nand midnight was at hand; when there entered from the atrium a grey-headed\r\nslave bearing a tray covered with light refreshments—fresh herbs, endive\r\nand mallows sprinkled with snow, ripe figs, eggs and anchovies, dried\r\ngrapes, and cakes of candied honey; while two boys of rare beauty\r\nfollowed, one carrying a flagon of Chian wine diluted with snow water, the\r\nother a platter richly chased in gold covered with cyathi, or drinking\r\ncups, some of plain chrystal, some of that unknown myrrhine fabric,(3)\r\nwhich is believed by many scholars to have been highly vitrified and\r\nhalf-transparent porcelain.\r\n\r\nA second slave brought in a folded stand, like a camp stool in shape, on\r\nwhich the tray was speedily deposited, while on a slab of Parian marble\r\nnear which the two boys took their stand, the wine and goblets were\r\narranged in glittering order.\r\n\r\nSo silently, however, was all this done, that, their preparations made,\r\nthe elder slaves had retired with a deep genuflexion, leaving the boys\r\nonly to administer at that unceremonious banquet, ere the young couple,\r\nwhose backs were turned towards the table, perceived the interruption.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant smile, which has been mentioned, beamed from the features of\r\nthe elder lady, as she perceived how thoroughly engrossed, even to the\r\nunconsciousness of any passing sound, they were, whom, rising for the\r\npurpose, and laying by her work, she now proceeded to recall to sublunary\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\"Paullus,\" she said, \"and you, my Julia, ye are unconscious how the\r\nfleeting hours have slipped away. The night hath far advanced into the\r\nthird watch. I would not part ye needlessly, nor over soon, especially\r\nwhen you must so soon perforce be severed; but we must not forget how long\r\na homeward walk awaits our dear Arvina. Come, then, and partake some\r\nslight refreshment, before you say farewell.\r\n\r\n\"How thoughtless in me, to have detained you thus, and with a mile to walk\r\nthis murky and unpleasant night. They say, too, that the streets are\r\ndangerous of late, haunted by dissolute night-revellers—that villain\r\nClodius and his infamous co-mates. I tremble like a leaf if I but meet\r\nthem in broad day—and what if you should fall in with them, when flushed\r\nwith wine, and ripe for any outrage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fie! dear one, fie!\" answered the young man with a smile—\"a sorry soldier\r\nwouldst thou make of me, who am within so short a space to meet the\r\nsavages of Pontus, under our mighty Pompey! There is no danger, Julia,\r\nhere in the heart of Rome; and my stout freedman Thrasea awaits me with\r\nhis torch. Nor is it so far either to my house, for those who cross, as I\r\nshall do, the cemetery on the Esquiline. ’Tis but a step across the\r\nsumptuous Carinæ to the Cælian.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, surely, Paul,\" exclaimed the lovely girl, laying her hand\r\nupon his arm, \"thou wouldst not cross that fearful burying-ground, haunted\r\nby all things awful and obscene, thus at the dead of night. Oh! do not,\r\ndearest,\" she continued, \"thou knowest not what wild terrible tales are\r\nrife, of sounds and sights unnatural and superhuman, encountered in those\r\nloathsome precincts. ’Tis a mere tempting of the Dark Ones, to brave the\r\nhorrors of that place!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Gods, my Julia,\" replied the youth unmoved by her alarm, \"the Gods\r\nare never absent from their votaries, so they be innocent and pure of\r\nspirit. For me! I am unconscious of a wilful fault, and fear not\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Paullus Arvina,\" exclaimed the elder lady, \"and worthily of\r\nyour descent from the Cæcilii\"—for from that noble house his family indeed\r\nderived its origin. \"But, although I,\" she added, \"counsel you not to heed\r\nour Julia’s girlish terrors, I love you not to walk by night so slenderly\r\naccompanied. Ho! boy, go summon me the steward, and bid him straightway\r\narm four of the Thracian slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! by the Gods, Hortensia!\" the young man interrupted her, his whole\r\nface flushing with excitement, \"you do shame to my manhood, by your\r\ncaution. There is in truth no shadow of danger. Besides,\" he added,\r\nlaughing at his own impetuosity, \"I shall be far beyond the Esquiline ere\r\nexcellent old Davus could rouse those sturdy knaves of yours, or find the\r\narmory key; for lo! I will but tarry to taste one cup of your choice of\r\nChian to my Julia’s health, and then straight homeward. Have a care, my\r\nfair boy, that flagon is too heavy to be lifted safely by such small hands\r\nas thine, and its contents too precious to be wasted. Soh! that’s well\r\ndone; thou’lt prove a second Ganymede! Health, Julia, and good dreams—may\r\nall fair things attend thee, until we meet again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when shall that be, Paul,\" whispered his mistress, a momentary flush\r\nshooting across brow, neck, and bosom, as she spoke, and leaving her, a\r\nsecond afterward, even paler than her wont, between anxiety and fear, and\r\nthe pain even of this temporary parting—\"when shall that be? to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, to-morrow! fairest,\" he replied, clasping her little hand with a\r\nfond pressure, \"unless, which may the Gods avert! anything unforeseen\r\nprevent me. Give me my toga, boy,\" he added, \"and see if Thrasea waits,\r\nand if his torch be lighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bid him come hither, Geta,\" Hortensia interposed, addressing the boy as\r\nhe left the room, \"and tell old Davus to accompany him, bringing the keys\r\nof the peristyle and of the garden gate. So shalt thou gain the Esquiline\r\nmore easily.\"\r\n\r\nHer orders were obeyed as soon as they were spoken, and but few moments\r\nintervened before the aged steward, and the freedman with his staff and\r\ntorch, the latter so prepared by an art common to the ancients as to set\r\nalmost any violence of wind or rain at defiance, stood waiting their\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nFamiliar and kind words were interchanged between those high-born ladies\r\nand the trustworthy follower of young Arvina. For those were days, when no\r\ncold etiquette fettered the freedom of the tongue, and when no rank, how\r\nstately or how proud soever, induced austerity of bearing or haughtiness\r\ntoward inferiors; and these concluded, greetings, briefer but far more\r\nwarm, followed between the master and his intended bride.\r\n\r\n\"Sweet slumbers, Julia, and a happy wakening attend you! Farewell,\r\nHortensia; both of ye farewell!\" and passing into the colonnade through\r\nthe door which Davus had unlocked, he drew the lappet of his toga over his\r\nhead after the fashion of a hood to shield it from the drizzling rain—for,\r\nexcept on a journey, the hardy Romans never wore any hat or headgear—and\r\nhastened with a firm and regular step along the marble peristyle. This\r\nportico, or rather piazza, enclosed, by a double row of Tuscan columns, a\r\nfew small flower beds, and a fountain springing high in the air from the\r\nconch of a Triton, and falling back into a large shell of white marble,\r\nwhich it was so contrived as to keep ever full without at any time\r\noverflowing.\r\n\r\nBeyond this was a summer triclinium or dining room facing the north, and\r\nprovided with the three-sided couch, from which it took its name,\r\nembracing a circular table. Through this they passed into a smaller court\r\nadorned like the other by a jet d’eau, surrounded by several small\r\nboudoirs and bed chambers luxuriously decorated, which were set apart to\r\nthe use of the females of the family, and guarded night and day by the\r\nmost trusty of the slaves.\r\n\r\nHence a strong door gave access to a walled space, throughout the length\r\nof which on either hand ran a long range of offices, and above them the\r\ndormitories of the slaves, with a small porter’s lodge or guard room by\r\nthe gate, opening on the orchard in the rear.\r\n\r\nTherein were stationed the four Thracians, mentioned by Hortensia, whose\r\nduty it was to keep watch alternately over the safety of the postern,\r\nalthough the key was not entrusted to their charge; and he, whose watch it\r\nwas, started up from a bench on which he had been stretched, and looked\r\nforth torch in hand at the sound of approaching footsteps. Seeing,\r\nhowever, who it was, and that the steward attended him, he lent his aid in\r\nopening the postern, and reverently bowed the knee to Arvina, as he\r\ndeparted from the hospitable villa.\r\n\r\nThe orchard through which lay his onward progress, occupied a considerable\r\nextent of ground, laid out in terraces adorned with marble urns and\r\nstatues, long bowery walks sheltered by vine-clad trellices, and rows of\r\nfruit trees interspersed with many a shadowy clump of the rich evergreen\r\nholm-oak, the tufted stone-pine, the clustering arbutus, and smooth-leaved\r\nlaurestinus. This lovely spot was separated from the plebeian cemetery\r\nonly—as has been said already—by a low wall; and therefore in those days\r\nof universal superstition of the lower orders and the slaves, and many too\r\nof their employers, would have eschewed it as a place ominous of evil, if\r\nnot unsafe and perilous.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Paul, however, if not entirely free from any touch of\r\nsuperstitious awe, which at that period of the world would have been a\r\nthing altogether unnatural and impossible, was at least of too firm a\r\nmould to shake at mere imaginary terrors; and he strode on, lighted by his\r\ntorch-bearer, through the dark mazes of the orchard, with all his thoughts\r\nengrossed by the pleasant reminiscences of the past evening. Thoughtless,\r\nhowever, as he was, and bold, he yet recoiled a step, and the blood rushed\r\ntumultuously to his heart, as a loud yelling cry, protracted strangely,\r\nand ending in a sound midway between a groan and a burst of horrid\r\nlaughter, rose awfully upon the silent night; and it required an effort to\r\nman his heart against a feeling, which crept through him, nearly akin to\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nBut with the freedman Thrasea it was a very different matter, for he shook\r\nso much with absolute terror, that he had well nigh dropped the torch;\r\nwhile, drawing nearer to his master’s side, with teeth that chattered as\r\nif in an ague fit, and a face deserted by every particle of color, he\r\nbesought him in faltering accents, \"by all the Gods! to turn back\r\ninstantly, lest evil might come of it!\"\r\n\r\nHis entreaties were, however, of no avail with the brave youth, who in a\r\nmoment had shaken off his transitory terror, and was now resolute, not\r\nonly to proceed on his homeward route, but to investigate the cause and\r\nmeaning of the outcry.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" he said, somewhat sternly, in answer to the reiterated prayers\r\nof the trembling servitor, \"Silence! and follow, idiot! That was no\r\nsuperhuman voice—no yell of nightly lemures, but the death-cry, if I err\r\nnot more widely, of some frail mortal like ourselves. There may be time,\r\nhowever, yet to save him, and I so truly marked the quarter whence it\r\nrose, that I doubt not we may discover him. Advance the light; lo! we are\r\nat the wall. Lower thy torch now, that I may undo the wicket. Give me thy\r\nclub and keep close at my heels bearing the flambeau high!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the words he strode out rapidly into the wide desolate expanse of\r\nthe plebeian grave yard. It was a broad bleak space, comprising the whole\r\ntable land and southern slope of the Esquiline hill, broken with many deep\r\nravines and gulleys, worn by the wintry rains, covered with deep rank\r\ngrass and stunted bushes, with here and there a grove of towering\r\ncypresses, or dark funereal yews, casting a deeper shadow over the gloomy\r\nsolitude. So rough and broken was the surface of the ground, so numerous\r\nthe low mounds which alone covered the ashes of the humbler dead, that\r\nthey were long in reaching the vicinity of the spot where that fell deed\r\nhad been done so recently. When they had come, however, to the foot of the\r\ndescent, where it swept gently downward to the boundary wall, the young\r\nman took the torch from his attendant, and waving it with a slow movement\r\nto and fro, surveyed the ground with close and narrow scrutiny. He had not\r\nmoved in this manner above a dozen paces, before a bright quick flash\r\nseemed to shoot up from the long thick herbage as the glare of the torch\r\npassed over it. Another step revealed the nature and the cause of that\r\nbrief gleam; a ray had fallen full on the polished blade of Cataline’s\r\nstiletto, which lay, where it had been cast by the expiring effort of the\r\nvictim, hilt downward in the tangled weeds.\r\n\r\nHe seized it eagerly, but shuddered, as he beheld the fresh dark gore\r\ncurdling on the broad steel, and clotted round the golden guard of the\r\nrich weapon.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, \"I am right, Thrasea. Foul murder hath been done here!\r\nLet us look farther.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes now were spent in searching every foot of ground, and\r\nprying even into the open vaults of several broken graves; for at first\r\nthey had taken a wrong direction in the gloom. Quickly, however, seeing\r\nthat he was in error, Arvina turned upon his traces, and was almost\r\nimmediately successful; for there, scarce twenty feet from the spot where\r\nhe had found the dagger, with his grim gory face turned upward as if\r\nreproachfully to the dark quiet skies, the black death-sweat still beaded\r\non his frowning brow, and a sardonic grin distorting his pale lips, lay\r\nthe dead slave. Flat on his back, with his arms stretched out right and\r\nleft, his legs extended close together to their full length, he lay even\r\nas he had fallen; for not a struggle had convulsed his limbs after he\r\nstruck the earth; life having actually fled while he yet stood erect,\r\nbattling with all the energies of soul and body against man’s latest\r\nenemy. The bosom of his gray tunic, rent asunder, displayed the deep gash\r\nwhich had let out the spirit, whence the last drops of the thick crimson\r\nlife-blood were ebbing with a slow half-stagnant motion.\r\n\r\nOn this dread sight Paul was still gazing in that motionless and painful\r\nsilence, with which the boldest cannot fail to look upon the body of a\r\nfellow creature from which the immortal soul has been reluctantly and\r\nforcefully expelled, when a loud cry from Thrasea, who, having lagged a\r\nstep or two behind, was later in discovering the corpse, aroused him from\r\nhis melancholy stupor.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas! ah me!\" cried the half-sobbing freedman, \"my friend, my more\r\nthan friend, my countryman, my kinsman, Medon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! dost thou recognize the features? didst thou know him who lies so\r\ncoldly and inanimately here before us?\" cried the excited youth, \"whose\r\nslave was he? speak, Thrasea, on thy life! this shall be looked to\r\nstraightway; and, by the Gods! avenged.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I would recognize mine own in the polished brass, as I do know my\r\nfather’s sister’s son! for such was he, who lies thus foully slaughtered.\r\nAlas! alas! my countryman! wo! wo! for thee, my Medon! Many a day, alas!\r\nmany a happy day have we two chased the elk and urus by the dark-wooded\r\nDanube; the same roof covered us; the same board fed; the same fire warmed\r\nus; nay! the same fatal battle-field robbed both of liberty and country.\r\nYet were the great Gods merciful to the poor captives. Thy father did buy\r\nme, Arvina, and a few years of light and pleasant servitude restored the\r\nslave to freedom. Medon was purchased by the wise consul, Cicero, and was\r\nto have received his freedom at the next Saturnalia. Alas! and wo is me,\r\nhe is now free forever from any toils on earth, from any mortal master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! weep not so, my Thrasea,\" exclaimed the generous youth, laying his\r\nleft hand with a friendly pressure on the freedman’s shoulder, \"thou shalt\r\nhave all means to do all honor to his name; all that can now be done by\r\nmortals for the revered and sacred dead. Aid me now to remove the body,\r\nlest those who slew him may return, and carry off the evidences of their\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he thrust the unlighted end of the torch into the ground,\r\nand lifting up the shoulders of the carcase, while Thrasea raised the\r\nfeet, bore it away a hundred yards or better, and laying it within the\r\nopen arch-way of an old tomb, covered the mouth with several boughs torn\r\nfrom a neighboring cypress.\r\n\r\nThen satisfied that it would thus escape a nearer search than it was\r\nlikely would be made by the murderers, when they should find that it had\r\nbeen removed, he walked away very rapidly toward his home.\r\n\r\nBefore he left the burial ground, however, he wiped the dagger carefully\r\nin the long grass, and hid it in the bosom of his tunic.\r\n\r\nNo more words were exchanged—the master buried in deep thought, the\r\nservant stupified with grief and terror—until they reached the house of\r\nPaullus, in a fair quarter of the town, near to the street of Carinæ, the\r\nnoblest and most sumptuous in Rome.\r\n\r\nA dozen slaves appeared within the hall, awaiting the return of their\r\nyoung lord, but he dismissed them all; and when they had departed, taking\r\na small night lamp, and ordering Thrasea to waken him betimes to-morrow,\r\nthat he might see the consul, he bade him be of good cheer, for that\r\nMedon’s death should surely be avenged, since the gay dagger would prove a\r\nclue to the detection of his slayer. Then, passing into his own chamber,\r\nhe soon lost all recollection of his hopes, joys, cares, in the sound\r\nsleep of innocence and youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSUL.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Therefore let him be Consul; The Gods give\r\n      Him joy, and make him good friend to the people.\r\n                    CORIOLANUS.\r\n\r\nThe morning was yet young, when Paullus Arvina, leaving his mansion on the\r\nCælian hill by a postern door, so to avoid the crowd of clients who even\r\nat that early hour awaited his forth-coming in the hall, descended the\r\ngentle hill toward the splendid street called Carinæ, from some fanciful\r\nresemblance in its shape, lying in a curved hollow between the bases of\r\nthe Esquiline, Cælian, and Palatine mounts, to the keel of a galley.\r\n\r\nThis quarter of the city was at that time unquestionably the most\r\nbeautiful in Rome, although it still fell far short of the magnificence it\r\nafterward attained, when the favourite Mecænas had built his splendid\r\npalace, and laid out his unrivalled gardens, on the now woody Esquiline;\r\nand it would have been difficult indeed to conceive a view more sublime,\r\nthan that which lay before the eyes of the young patrician, as he paused\r\nfor a moment on the highest terrace of the hill, to inhale the breath of\r\nthe pure autumnal morning.\r\n\r\nThe sun already risen, though not yet high in the east, was pouring a\r\nflood of mellow golden light, through the soft medium of the half misty\r\natmosphere, over the varied surface of the great city, broken and\r\ndiversified by many hills and hollows; and bringing out the innumerable\r\ncolumns, arches, and aqueducts, that adorned almost every street and\r\nsquare, in beautiful relief.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the young man stood, looking directly northward, was\r\none which could not be excelled, if it indeed could be equalled for the\r\nview it commanded, embracing nearly the whole of Rome, which from its\r\ncommanding height, inferior only to the capitol, and the Quirinal hill, it\r\nwas enabled to overlook.\r\n\r\nBefore him, in the hollow at his feet, on which the morning rays dwelt\r\nlovingly, streaming in through the deep valley to the right over the city\r\nwalls, lay the long street of the Carinæ, the noblest and most sumptuous\r\nof Rome, adorned with many residences of the patrician order, and among\r\nothers, those of Pompey, Cæsar, and the great Latin orator. This broad and\r\nnoble thoroughfare, from its great width, and the long rows of marble\r\ncolumns, which decked its palaces, all glittering in the misty sunbeams,\r\nshewed like a waving line of light among the crowded buildings of the\r\nnarrower ways, that ran parallel to it along the valley and up the easy\r\nslope of the Cælian mount, with the Minervium, in which Arvina stood,\r\nleading directly downward to its centre. Beyond this sparkling line, rose\r\nthe twin summits Oppius and Cispius, of the Esquiline hill, still decked\r\nwith the dark foliage of the ancestral groves of oak and sweet-chesnut,\r\nsaid to derive their origin from Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome,\r\nand green with the long grass and towering cypresses of the plebeian\r\ncemetery, across which the young man had come home, from the villa of his\r\nlady-love, but a few hours before.\r\n\r\nBeyond the double hill-tops, a heavy purple shadow indicated the deep\r\nbasin through which ran the ill-famed Suburra, and the \"Wicked-Street\", so\r\nnamed from the tradition, that therein Tullia compelled her trembling\r\ncharioteer to lash his reluctant steeds over the yet warm body of her\r\nmurdered father. And beyond this again the lofty ridge of the Quirinal\r\nmount stood out in fair relief with all its gorgeous load of palaces and\r\ncolumns; and the great temple of the city’s founder, the god Romulus\r\nQuirinus; and the stupendous range of walls and turrets, along its\r\nnorthern verge, flashing out splendidly to the new-risen sun.\r\n\r\nSo lofty was the post from which Paullus gazed, as he overlooked the\r\nmighty town, that his eye reached even beyond the city-walls on the\r\nQuirinal, and passing over the broad valley at its northern base, all\r\nglimmering with uncertain lights and misty shadows, rested upon the Collis\r\nHortulorum, or mount of gardens, now called Monte Pincio, which was at\r\nthat time covered, as its name indicates, with rich and fertile\r\nshrubberies. The glowing hues of these could be distinctly made out, even\r\nat this great distance, by the naked eye. For it must be remembered that\r\nthere was in those days no sea-coal to send up its murky smoke-wreaths,\r\nblurring the bright skies with its inky pall; no factories with tall\r\nchimnies, vomiting forth, like mimic Etnas, their pestilential breath,\r\nfatal to vegetable life. Not a cloud hung over the great city; and the\r\ncharcoal, sparingly used for cookery, sent forth no visible fumes to\r\nshroud the daylight. So that, as the thin purplish haze was dispersed by\r\nthe growing influence of the sunbeams, every line of the far architecture,\r\neven to the carved friezes of the thousand temples, and the rich foliage\r\nof the marble capitals could be observed, distinct and sharp as in a\r\npainted picture.\r\n\r\nNor was this all the charm of the delicious atmosphere; for so pure was\r\nit, that the odours of that flowery hill, wafted upon the wings of the\r\nlight northern breeze, blent with the coolness which they caught from the\r\nhundreds of clear fountains, plashing and glittering in every public\r\nplace, came to the brow of the young noble, more like the breath of some\r\nenchanted garden in the far-famed Hesperides, than the steam from the\r\nabodes of above a million of busy mortals.\r\n\r\nBefore him still, though inclining a little to the left hand, lay a\r\nbroader hollow, presenting the long vista of the sacred way, leading\r\ndirectly to the capitol, and thence to the Campus Martius, the green\r\nexpanse of which, bedecked with many a marble monument and brazen column,\r\nand already studded with quick moving groups, hurling the disc and\r\njavelin, or reining the fierce war-horse with strong Gaulish curbs, lay\r\nsoft and level for half a league in length, till it was bounded far away\r\nby a gleaming reach of the blue Tiber.\r\n\r\nStill to the left of this, uprose the Palatine, the earliest settled of\r\nthe hills of Rome, with the old walls of Romulus, and the low straw-built\r\nshed, wherein that mighty son of Mars dwelt when he governed his wild\r\nrobber-clan; and the bidental marking the spot where lightning from the\r\nmonarch of Olympus, called on by undue rites, consumed Hostilius and his\r\nhouse; were still preserved with reverential worship, and on its eastern\r\npeak, the time-honoured shrine of Stator Jove.\r\n\r\nThe ragged crest of this antique elevation concealed, it is true, from\r\nsight the immortal space below, once occupied by the marsh of the\r\nVelabrum, but now filled by the grand basilicæ and halls of Justice\r\nsurrounding the great Roman forum, with all their pomp of golden shields,\r\nand monuments of mighty deeds performed in the earliest ages; but it was\r\nfar too low to intercept the view of the grand Capitol, and the Tarpeian\r\nRock.\r\n\r\nThe gilded gates of bronze and the gold-plated roof of the vast national\r\ntemple—gold-plated at the enormous cost of twenty-one thousand talents,\r\nthe rich spoil of Carthage—the shrine of Jupiter Capitoline, and Juno, and\r\nMinerva, sent back the sun-beams in lines too dazzling to be borne by any\r\nhuman eye; and all the pomp of statues grouped on the marble terraces, and\r\nguarding the ascent of the celebrated hundred steps, glittered like forms\r\nof indurated snow.\r\n\r\nSuch was the wondrous spectacle, more like a fairy show than a real scene\r\nof earthly splendour, to look on which Arvina paused for one moment with\r\nexulting gladness, before descending toward the mansion of the consul. Nor\r\nwas that mighty panorama wanting in moving crowds, and figures suitable to\r\nthe romantic glory of its scenery.\r\n\r\nHere, through the larger streets, vast herds of cattle were driven in by\r\nmounted herdsmen, lowing and trampling toward the forum; here a concourse\r\nof men, clad in the graceful toga, the clients of some noble house, were\r\nhastening along to salute their patron at his morning levee; there again,\r\ndanced and sang, with saffron colored veils and flowery garlands, a band\r\nof virgins passing in sacred pomp toward some favourite shrine; there in\r\nsad order swept along, with mourners and musicians, with women wildly\r\nshrieking and tearing their long hair, and players and buffoons, and\r\nliberated slaves wearing the cap of freedom, a funeral procession, bearing\r\nthe body of some _young_ victim, as indicated by the morning hour, to the\r\nfunereal pile beyond the city walls; and far off, filing in, with the\r\nspear heads and eagles of a cohort glittering above the dust wreaths, by\r\nthe Flaminian way, the train of some ambassador or envoy, sent by\r\nsubmissive monarchs or dependent states, to sue the favour and protection\r\nof the great Roman people.\r\n\r\nThe blended sounds swept up, in a confused sonorous murmur, like the sea;\r\nthe shrill cry of the water-carriers, and the wild chant of the choral\r\nsongs, and the keen clangour of the distant trumpets ringing above the\r\ndin, until the ears of the youth, as well as his eyes, were filled with\r\npresent proofs of his native city’s grandeur; and his whole soul was\r\nlapped in the proud conscious joy, arising from the thought that he too\r\nwas entitled to that boastful name, higher than any monarch’s style, of\r\nRoman citizen.\r\n\r\n\"Fairest and noblest city of the universe,\" cried the enthusiastic boy,\r\nspreading his arms abroad over the glorious view, which, kindling all the\r\npowers of his imaginative mind, had awakened something of awe and\r\nveneration, \"long may the everliving gods watch over thee; long may they\r\nguard thy liberties intact, thy hosts unconquered! long may thy name\r\nthroughout the world be synonymous with all that is great, and good, and\r\nglorious! Long may the Roman fortune and the Roman virtue tread, side by\r\nside, upon the neck of tyrants; and the whole universe stand mute and\r\ndaunted before the presence of the sovereign people.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sovereign slaves!\" said a deep voice, with a strangely sneering\r\naccent, in his ear; and as he started in amazement, for he had not\r\nimagined that any one was near him, Cataline stood at his elbow.\r\n\r\nUnder the mingled influence of surprise, and bashfulness at being\r\noverheard, and something not very far removed from alarm at the unexpected\r\npresence of one so famed for evil deeds as the man beside him, Arvina\r\nrecoiled a pace or two, and thrust his hand into the bosom of his toga,\r\ndisarranging its folds for a moment, and suffering the eye of the\r\nconspirator to dwell on the hilt of a weapon, which he recognized\r\ninstantly as the stiletto he had lost in the struggle with the miserable\r\nslave on the Esquiline.\r\n\r\nNo gleam in the eye of the wily plotter betrayed his intelligence; no show\r\nof emotion was discoverable in his dark paleness; but a grim smile played\r\nover his lips for a moment, as he noted, not altogether without a sort of\r\nsecret satisfaction, the dismay caused by his unexpected presence.\r\n\r\n\"How now,\" he said jeeringly, before the smile had yet vanished from his\r\nill-omened face—\"what aileth the bold Paullus, that he should start, like\r\nan unruly colt scared by a shadow, from the approach of a friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"A friend,\" answered the young man in a half doubtful tone, but instantly\r\nrecovering himself, \"Ha! Cataline, I was surprised, and scarce saw who it\r\nwas. Thou art abroad betimes this morning. Whither so early? but what\r\nsaidst thou about slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought thou didst not know me,\" replied the other, \"and for the rest,\r\nI am abroad no earlier than thou, and am perhaps bound to the same place\r\nwith thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Hercules! I fancy not,\" said Paullus.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore, I pray thee, not? Who knoweth? Perchance I go to pay my vows\r\nto Jupiter upon the capitol! perchance,\" he added with a deep sneer, \"to\r\nsalute our most eloquent and noble consul!\"\r\n\r\nA crimson flush shot instantly across the face and temples of Arvina,\r\nperceiving that he was tampered with, and sounded only; yet he replied\r\ncalmly and with dignity, \"Thither indeed, go I; but I knew not that thou\r\nwert in so much a friend of Cicero, as to go visit him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men sometimes visit those who be not their friends,\" answered the other.\r\n\"I never said he was a friend to me, or I to him. By the gods, no! I had\r\nlied else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was that,\" asked the youth, moved, by an inexplicable curiosity\r\nand excitement, to learn something more of the singular being with whom\r\nchance had brought him into contact, \"which thou didst say but now\r\nconcerning slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"That all these whom we see before us, and around us, and beneath us, are\r\nbut a herd of slaves; gulled and vainglorious slaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Roman people?\" exclaimed Paullus, every tone of his voice, every\r\nfeature of his fine countenance, expressing his unmitigated horror and\r\nastonishment. \"The great, unconquered Roman people; the lords of earth and\r\nsea, from frosty Caucasus to the twin rocks of Hercules; the tramplers on\r\nthe necks of kings; the arbiters of the whole world! The Roman people,\r\nslaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most abject and most wretched!\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom then?\" cried the young man, much excited, \"to whom am I, art\r\nthou, a slave? For we are also of the Roman people?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Roman people, and thou, as one of them, and I, Paullus Cæcilius, are\r\nslaves one and all; abject and base and spirit-fallen slaves, lacking the\r\ncourage even to spurn against our fetters, to the proud tyrannous rich\r\naristocracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Gods! we are of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not the less, for that, slaves to it!\" answered Cataline! \"See! from\r\nthe lowest to the highest, each petty pelting officer lords it above the\r\nnext below him; and if the tribunes for a while, at rare and singular\r\nmoments, uplift a warning cry against the corrupt insolence of the\r\npatrician houses, gold buys them back into vile treasonable silence!\r\nPatricians be we, and not slaves, sayest thou? Come tell me then, did the\r\npatrician blood of the grand Gracchi preserve them from a shameful doom,\r\nbecause they dared to speak, as free-born men, aloud and freely? Did his\r\npatrician blood save Fulvius Flaccus? Were Publius Antonius, and Cornelius\r\nSylla, the less ejected from their offices, that they were of the highest\r\nblood in Rome; the lawful consuls by the suffrage of the people? Was I,\r\nthe heir of Sergius Silo’s glory, the less forbidden even to canvass for\r\nthe consulship, that my great grandsire’s blood was poured out, like\r\nwater, upon those fields that witnessed Rome’s extremest peril, Trebia,\r\nand the Ticinus, and Thrasymene and Cannæ? Was Lentulus, the noblest of\r\nthe noble, patrician of the eldest houses, a consular himself, expelled\r\nthe less and stricken from the rolls of the degenerate senate, for the\r\nmere whining of a mawkish wench, because his name is Cornelius? Tush,\r\nTush! these be but dreams of poets, or imaginings of children!—the commons\r\nbe but slaves to the nobles; the nobles to the senate; the senate to their\r\ncreditors, their purchasers, their consuls; the last at once their tools,\r\nand their tyrants! Go, young man, go. Salute, cringe, fawn upon your\r\nconsul! Nathless, for thou hast mind enough to mark and note the truth of\r\nwhat I tell thee; thou wilt think upon this, and perchance one day, when\r\nthe time shall have come, wilt speak, act, strike, for freedom!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he finished speaking, he turned aside with a haughty gesture of\r\nfarewell; and wrapping his toga closely about his tall person, stalked\r\naway slowly in the direction neither of the capitol nor of the consul’s\r\nhouse; turning his head neither to the right hand nor to the left; and\r\ntaking no more notice of the person to whom he had been speaking, than if\r\nhe had not known him to be there, and gazing toward him half-bewildered in\r\nanxiety and wonder!\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful! by the Gods!\" he said at last. \"Truly he is a wonderful man,\r\nand wise withal! I fain would know if all that be true, which they say of\r\nhim—his bitterness, his impiety, his blood-thirstiness! By Hercules! he\r\nspeaks well! and it is _true_ likewise. Yea! true it is, that we,\r\npatricians, and free, as we style ourselves, may not speak any thing, or\r\nact, against our order; no! nor indulge our private pleasures, for fear of\r\nthe proud censors! Is this, then, freedom? True, we are lords abroad; our\r\nfleets, our hosts, everywhere victorious; and not one land, wherein the\r\neagle has unfurled her pinion, but bows before the majesty of Rome—but\r\nyet—is it, is it, indeed, true, that we are but slaves, sovereign slaves,\r\nat home?\"\r\n\r\nThe whole tenor of the young man’s thoughts was altered by the few words,\r\nlet fall for that very purpose by the arch traitor. Ever espying whom he\r\nmight attach to his party by operating on his passions, his prejudices,\r\nhis weakness, or his pride; a most sagacious judge of human nature,\r\nreading the character of every man as it were in a written book, Cataline\r\nhad long before remarked young Arvina. He had noted several points of his\r\nmental constitution, which he considered liable to receive such\r\nimpressions as he would—his proneness to defer to the thoughts of others,\r\nhis want of energetic resolution, and not least his generous indignation\r\nagainst every thing that savored of cruelty or oppression. He had resolved\r\nto operate on these, whenever he might find occasion; and should he meet\r\nsuccess in his first efforts, to stimulate his passions, minister to his\r\nvoluptuous pleasures, corrupt his heart, and make him in the end, body and\r\nsoul, his own.\r\n\r\nSuch were the intentions of the conspirator, when he first addressed\r\nPaullus. His desire to increase the strength of his party, to whom the\r\naccession of any member however humble of the great house of Cæcilii could\r\nnot fail to be useful, alone prompting him in the first instance. But,\r\nwhen he saw by the young man’s startled aspect that he was prepossessed\r\nagainst him, and had listened probably to the damning rumors which were\r\nrife everywhere concerning him, a second motive was added, in his pride of\r\nseduction and sophistry, by which he was wont to boast, that he could\r\nbewilder the strongest minds, and work them to his will. When by the\r\naccidental disarrangement of Arvina’s gown, and the discovery of his own\r\ndagger, he perceived that the intended victim of his specious arts was\r\nprobably cognizant in some degree of his last night’s crime, a third and\r\nstronger cause was added, in the instinct of self-preservation. And as\r\nsoon as he found out that Paullus was bound for the house of Cicero, he\r\nconsidered his life, in some sort, staked upon the issue of his attempt on\r\nArvina’s principles.\r\n\r\nNo part could have been played with more skill, or with greater knowledge\r\nof his character whom he addressed. He said just enough to set him\r\nthinking, and to give a bias and a colour to his thoughts, without giving\r\nhim reason to suspect that he had any interest in the matter; and he had\r\nwithdrawn himself in that careless and half contemptuous manner, which\r\nnaturally led the young man to wish for a renewal of the subject.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact Paul, while walking down the hill, toward the house of the\r\nConsul, was busied in wondering why Cataline had left so much unsaid,\r\ndeparting so abruptly; and in debating with himself upon the strange\r\ndoctrines which he had then for the first time heard broached.\r\n\r\nIt was about the second hour of the Roman day, corresponding nearly to\r\neight o’clock before noon—as the winter solstice was now passed—when\r\nArvina reached the magnificent dwelling of the Consul in the Carinæ at the\r\nangle of the Cærolian place, hard by the foot of the Sacred Way.\r\n\r\nThis splendid building occupied a whole _insula_, as it was called, or\r\nspace between four streets, intersecting each other at right angles; and\r\nwas three stories in height, the two upper supported by columns of marble,\r\nwith a long range of glass windows, at that period an unusual and\r\nexpensive luxury. The doors stood wide open; and on either hand the\r\nvestibule were arranged the lictors leaning upon their fasces, while the\r\nwhole space of the great Corinthian hall within, lighted from above, and\r\nadorned with vast black pillars of Lucullean marble, was crowded with the\r\nwhite robes of the consul’s plebeian clients tendering their morning\r\nsalutations; not unmixed with the crimson fringes and broad crimson\r\nfacings of senatorial visitors.\r\n\r\nMany were there with gifts of all kinds; countrymen from his Sabine farm\r\nand his Tusculan retreat, some bringing lambs; some cages full of doves;\r\ncheeses, and bowls of fragrant honey; and robes of fine white linen the\r\nproduce of their daughters’ looms; for whom perchance they were seeking\r\ndowers at the munificence of their noble patron; artizans of the city,\r\nwith toys or pieces of furniture, lamps, writing cases, cups or vases of\r\nrich workmanship; courtiers with manuscripts rarely illuminated, the work\r\nof their most valuable slaves; travellers with gems, and bronzes,\r\nofferings known to be esteemed beyond all others by the high-minded lover\r\nof the arts, and unrivalled scholar, to whom they were presented.\r\n\r\nThese presents, after being duly exhibited to the patron himself, who was\r\nseated at the farther end of the hall, concealed from the eyes of Paullus\r\nby the intervening crowd, were consigned to the care of the various\r\nslaves, or freedmen, who stood round their master, and borne away\r\naccording to their nature, to the storerooms and offices, or to the\r\nlibrary and gallery of the consul; while kind words and a courteous\r\ngreeting, and a consideration most ample and attentive even of the\r\nsmallest matters brought before him, awaited all who approached the\r\norator; whether he came empty handed, or full of gifts, to require an\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, Arvina penetrated far enough through the crowd to\r\ncommand a view of the consul’s seat; and for a time he amused himself by\r\nwatching his movements and manner toward each of his visitors, perhaps not\r\naltogether without reference to the conversation he had recently held with\r\nCatiline; and certainly not without a desire to observe if the tales he\r\nhad heard of shameless bribery and corruption, as practiced by many of the\r\ngreat officers of the republic, had any confirmation in the conduct of\r\nCicero.\r\n\r\nBut he soon saw that the courtesies of that great and virtuous man were\r\nregulated neither by the value of the gifts offered, nor by the rank of\r\nthe visitors; and that his personal predilections even were not allowed to\r\ninterfere with the division of his time among all worthy of his notice.\r\n\r\nThus he remarked that a young noble, famed for his dissoluteness and evil\r\ncourses, although he brought an exquisite sculpture of Praxiteles, was\r\nreceived with the most marked and formal coldness, and his gift, which\r\ncould not be declined, consigned almost without eliciting a glance of\r\napprobation, to the hand of a freedman; while, the next moment, as an old\r\nwhite-headed countryman, plainly and almost meanly clad, although with\r\nscrupulous cleanliness, approached his presence, the consul rose to meet\r\nhim; and advancing a step or two took him affectionately by the hand, and\r\nasked after his family by name, and listened with profound consideration\r\nto the garrulous narrative of the good farmer, who, involved in some petty\r\nlitigation, had come to seek the advice of his patron; until he sent him\r\naway happy and satisfied with the promise of his protection.\r\n\r\nBy and by his own turn arrived; and, although he was personally unknown to\r\nthe orator, and the assistance of the nomenclator, who stood behind the\r\ncurule chair, was required before he was addressed by name, he was\r\nreceived with the utmost attention; the noble house to which the young man\r\nbelonged being as famous for its devotion to the common weal, as for the\r\nability and virtue of its sons.\r\n\r\nAfter a few words of ordinary compliment, Paullus proceeded to intimate to\r\nhis attentive hearer that his object in waiting at his levee that morning\r\nwas to communicate momentous information. The thoughtful eye of the great\r\norator brightened, and a keen animated expression came over the features,\r\nwhich had before worn an air almost of lassitude; and he asked eagerly—\r\n\r\n\"Momentous to the Republic—to Rome, my good friend?\"—for all his mind was\r\nbent on discovering the plots, which he suspected even now to be in\r\nprocess against the state.\r\n\r\n\"Momentous to yourself, Consul,\" answered Arvina.\r\n\r\n\"Then will it wait,\" returned the other, with a slight look of\r\ndisappointment, \"and I will pray you to remain, until I have spoken with\r\nall my friends here. It will not be very long, for I have seen nearly all\r\nthe known faces. If you are, in the mean time, addicted to the humane\r\narts, Davus here will conduct you to my library, where you shall find food\r\nfor the mind; or if you have not breakfasted, my Syrian will shew you\r\nwhere some of my youthful friends are even now partaking a slight meal.\"\r\n\r\nAccepting the first offer, partly perhaps from a sort of pardonable\r\nhypocrisy, desiring to make a favourable impression on the great man, with\r\nwhom he had for the first time spoken, Arvina followed the intelligent and\r\ncivil freedman to the library, which was indeed the favourite apartment of\r\nthe studious magistrate. And, if he half repented, as he went by the\r\nchamber wherein several youths of patrician birth, one or two of whom\r\nnodded to him as he passed, were assembled, conversing merrily and jesting\r\naround a well spread board, he ceased immediately to regret the choice he\r\nhad made, when the door was thrown open, and he was ushered into the\r\nshrine of Cicero’s literary leisure.\r\n\r\nThe library was a small square apartment; for it must be remembered that\r\nbooks at this time being multiplied by manual labor only, and the art\r\nbeing comparatively rare and very costly, the vast collections of modern\r\ntimes were utterly beyond the reach of individuals; and a few scores of\r\nvolumes were more esteemed than would be as many thousands now, in these\r\ndays of multiplying presses and steam power. But although inconsiderable\r\nin size, not being above sixteen feet square, the decorations of the\r\napartment were not to be surpassed or indeed equalled by anything of\r\nmodern splendor; for the walls,(4) divided into compartments by mouldings,\r\nexquisitely carved and overlaid with burnished gilding, were set with\r\npanels of thick plate glass glowing in all the richest hues of purple,\r\nruby, emerald, and azure, through several squares of which the light stole\r\nin, gorgeously tinted, from the peristyle, there being no distinction\r\nexcept in this between the windows and the other compartments of the\r\nwainscot, if it may be so styled; and of the ceiling, which was finished\r\nin like manner with slabs of stained glass, between the intersecting beams\r\nof gilded scroll work.\r\n\r\nThe floor was of beautiful mosaic, partially covered by a foot-cloth woven\r\nfrom the finest wool, and dyed purple with the juice of the cuttle-fish;\r\nand all the furniture corresponded, both in taste and magnificence, to the\r\nother decorations of the room. A circular table of cedar wood, inlaid with\r\nivory and brass, so that its value could not have fallen far short of ten\r\nthousand sesterces(5), stood in the centre of the floor-cloth; with a\r\n_bisellium_, or double settle, wrought in bronze, and two beautiful chairs\r\nof the same material not much dissimilar in form to those now used. And,\r\nto conclude, a bookcase of polished maple wood, one of the doors of which\r\nstood open, displayed a rare collection of about three hundred volumes,\r\neach in its circular case of purple parchment, having the name inscribed\r\nin letters of gold, silver, or vermilion.\r\n\r\nA noble bust in bronze of the Phidian Jupiter, with the sublime expanse of\r\nbrow, the ambrosian curls and the beard loosely waving, as when he shook\r\nOlympus by his nod, and the earth trembled and the depth of Tartarus,\r\nstood on a marble pedestal facing the bookcase; and on the table, beside\r\nwriting materials, leaves of parchment, an ornamental letter-case, a\r\ndouble inkstand and several reed pens, were scattered many gems and\r\ntrinkets; signets and rings engraved in a style far surpassing any effort\r\nof the modern graver, vases of onyx and cut glass, and above all, the\r\nstatue of a beautiful boy, holding a lamp of bronze suspended by a chain\r\nfrom his left hand, and in his right the needle used to refresh the wick.\r\n\r\nNurtured as he had been from his youth upward among the magnates of the\r\nland, accustomed to magnificence and luxury till he had almost fancied\r\nthat the world had nothing left of beautiful or new that he had not\r\nwitnessed, Paul stood awhile, after the freedman had departed, gazing with\r\nmute admiration on the richness and taste displayed in all the details of\r\nthis the scholar’s sanctum. The very atmosphere of the chamber, filled\r\nwith the perfume of the cedar wood employed as a specific against the\r\nravages of the moth and bookworm, seemed to the young man redolent of\r\nmidnight learning; and the superb front of the presiding god, calm in the\r\ngrandeur of its ineffable benignity, who appeared to his excited fancy to\r\nsmile serene protection on the pursuits of the blameless consul, inspired\r\nhim with a sense of awful veneration, that did not easily or quickly pass\r\naway.\r\n\r\nFor some moments, as he gradually recovered the elasticity of his spirits,\r\nhe amused himself by examining the exquisitely wrought gems on the table;\r\nbut after a little while, when Cicero came not, he crossed the room\r\nquietly to the bookshelves, and selecting a volume of Homer, drew it forth\r\nfrom its richly embossed case, and seating himself on the bronze settle\r\nwith his back toward the door, had soon forgotten where he was, and the\r\ngrave business which brought him thither, in the sublime simplicity of the\r\nblind rhapsodist.\r\n\r\nAn hour or more elapsed thus; yet Paul took no note of time, nor moved at\r\nall except to unroll with his right hand the lower margin of the parchment\r\nas he read, while with the left he rolled up the top; so that nearly the\r\nsame space of the manuscript remained constantly before his eyes, although\r\nthe reader was continually advancing in the poem.\r\n\r\nAt length the door opened noiselessly, and with a silent foot, shod in the\r\nlight slippers which the Romans always wore when in the house, Cicero\r\nentered the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe consul was at this time in the very prime of intellectual manhood, it\r\nhaving been decreed(6) about a century before, that no person should be\r\nelected to that highest office of the state, who should not have attained\r\nhis forty-third year. He was a tall and elegantly formed man, with nothing\r\nespecially worthy of remark in his figure, if it were not that his neck\r\nwas unusually long and slender, though not so much so as to constitute any\r\ndrawback to his personal appearance, which, without being what would\r\nexactly be termed handsome, was both elegant and graceful. His features\r\nwere not, indeed, very bold or striking; but intellect was strongly and\r\nsingularly marked in every line of the face; and the expression,—calm,\r\nthoughtful, and serene,—though it had not the quick and restless play of\r\never-varying lights and shadows which belongs to the quicker and more\r\nimaginative temperaments among men of the highest genius,—could not fail\r\nto impress any one with the conviction, that the mind which informed it\r\nmust be of eminent capacity, and depth, and power.\r\n\r\nHe entered, as I have said, silently; and although there was nothing of\r\nstealthiness in his gait, which being very light and slow was yet both\r\nfirm and springy, nor any of that cunning in his manner which is so often\r\ncoupled to a prowling footstep, he yet advanced so noiselessly over the\r\nsoft floor-cloth, that he stood at Arvina’s elbow, and overlooked the page\r\nin which he was reading, before the young man was aware of his vicinity.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, after standing a moment, and observing with a soft\r\npleasant smile the abstraction of his visitor, \"so thou readest Greek, and\r\nart thyself a poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little of the first, my consul,\" replied Arvina, arising quickly to his\r\nfeet, with the ingenuous blood rushing to his brow at the detection. \"But\r\nwherefore shouldst thou believe me the second?\"\r\n\r\n\"We statesmen,\" answered the consul, \"are wont to study other men’s\r\ncharacters, as other men are wont to study books; and I have learned by\r\npractice to draw quick conclusions from small signs. But in this instance,\r\nthe light in your eye, the curl of your expanded nostril, the half frown\r\non your brow, and the flush on your cheek, told me beyond a doubt that you\r\nare a poet. And you are so, young man. I care not whether you have penned\r\nas yet an elegy, or no—nevertheless, you are in soul, in temperament, in\r\nfantasy, a poet. Do you love Homer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond all other writers I have ever met, in my small course of reading.\r\nThere is a majesty, a truth, an ever-burning fire, lustrous, yet natural\r\nand most beneficent, like the sun’s glory on a summer day, in his immortal\r\nwords, that kindles and irradiates, yet consumes not the soul; a grand\r\nsimplicity, that never strains for effect; a sweet pathos, that elicits\r\ntears without evoking them; a melody that flows on, like the harmony of\r\nthe eternal sea, or, if we may call fancy to our aid, the music of the\r\nspheres, telling us that like these the blind bard sang, because song was\r\nhis nature—was within, and must out—not bound by laws, or measured by\r\npedantic rules, but free, unfettered, and spontaneous as the billows,\r\nwhich in its wild and many-cadenced sweep it most resembles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! said I not,\" replied Cicero, \"that you were a poet? And you have been\r\ndiscoursing me most eloquent poetry; though not attuned to metre,\r\nrythmical withal, and full of fancy. Ay! and you judge aright. He is the\r\ngreatest, as the first of poets; and surpassed all his followers as much\r\nin the knowledge of the human heart with its ten thousands of conflicting\r\npassions, as in the structure of the kingly verse, wherein he delineated\r\ncharacter as never man did, saving only he. But hold, Arvina. Though I\r\ncould willingly spend hours with thee in converse on this topic, the state\r\nhas calls on me, which must be obeyed. Tell me, therefore, I pray you, as\r\nshortly as may be, what is the matter you would have me know. Shortly, I\r\npray you, for my time is short, and my duties onerous and manifold.\"\r\n\r\nLaying aside the roll, which he had still held open during that brief\r\nconversation, and laying aside with it his enthusiastic and passionate\r\nmanner, the young man now stated, simply and briefly, the events of the\r\npast night, the discovery of the murdered slave, and the accident by which\r\nhe had learned that he was the consul’s property; and in conclusion, laid\r\nthe magnificently ornamented dagger which he had found, on the board\r\nbefore Cicero; observing, that the weapon might give a clue to poor\r\nMedon’s death.\r\n\r\nCicero was moved deeply—moved, not simply, as Arvina fancied, by sorrow\r\nfor the dead, but by something approaching nearly to remorse. He started\r\nup from the chair, which he had taken when the youth began his tale, and\r\nclasping his hands together violently, strode rapidly to and fro the small\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, and wo is me, poor Medon! Faithful wert thou, and true, and very\r\npleasant to mine eyes! Alas! that thou art gone, and gone too so\r\nwretchedly! And wo is me, that I listened not to my own apprehensions,\r\nrather than to thy trusty boldness. Alas! that I suffered thee to go, for\r\nthey have murdered thee! ay, thine own zeal betrayed thee; but by the Gods\r\nthat govern in Olympus, they shall rue it!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this burst of passion he became more cool, and, resuming his seat,\r\nasked Paullus a few shrewd and pertinent questions concerning the nature\r\nof the ground whereon he had found the corpse, the traces left by the\r\nmortal struggle, the hour at which the discovery was made, and many other\r\nminute points of the same nature; the answers to which he noted carefully\r\non his waxed tablets. When he had made all the inquiries that occurred to\r\nhim, he read aloud the answers as he had set them down, and asked if he\r\nwould be willing at any moment to attest the truth of those things.\r\n\r\n\"At any moment, and most willingly, my consul,\" the youth replied. \"I\r\nwould do much myself to find out the murderers and bring them to justice,\r\nwere it only for my poor freedman Thrasea’s sake, who is his\r\ncousin-german.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, young man, they _shall_ be brought to justice,\" answered\r\nCicero. \"In the meantime do thou keep silence, nor say one word touching\r\nthis to any one that lives. Carry the dagger with thee; wear it as\r\nostentatiously as may be—perchance it shall turn out that some one may\r\nclaim or recognise it. Whatever happeneth, let me know privately. Thus far\r\nhast thou done well, and very wisely: go on as thou hast commenced, and,\r\nhap what hap, count Cicero thy friend. But above all, doubt not—I say,\r\ndoubt not one moment,—that as there is One eye that seeth all things in\r\nall places, that slumbereth not by day nor sleepeth in the watches of\r\nnight, that never waxeth weak at any time or weary—as there is One hand\r\nagainst which no panoply can arm the guilty, from which no distance can\r\nprotect, nor space of time secure him, so surely shall they perish\r\nmiserable who did this miserable murder, and their souls rue it\r\neverlastingly beyond the portals of the grave, which are but the portals\r\nof eternal life, and admit all men to wo or bliss, for ever and for ever!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke solemnly and sadly; and on his earnest face there was a deep and\r\nalmost awful expression, that held Arvina mute and abashed, he knew not\r\nwherefore; and when the great man had ceased from speaking, he made a\r\nsilent gesture of salutation and withdrew, thus gravely warned, scarce\r\nconscious if the statesman noted his departure; for he had fallen into a\r\ndeep reverie, and was perhaps musing on the mysteries yet unrevealed of\r\nthe immortal soul, so totally careless did he now appear of all sublunary\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Eques ipso melior Bellerophonte,\r\n        Neque pugno neque segni pede victus,\r\n        Simul unctos Tiberinis humeros lavit in undis.\r\n                    HORACE. OD. III. 12.\r\n\r\n\"What ho! my noble Paullus,\" exclaimed a loud and cheerful voice, \"whither\r\nafoot so early, and with so grave a face?\"\r\n\r\nArvina started; for so deep was the impression made on his mind by the\r\nlast words of Cicero, that he had passed out into the Sacred Way, and\r\nwalked some distance down it, toward the Forum, in deep meditation, from\r\nwhich he was aroused by the clear accents of the merry speaker.\r\n\r\nLooking up with a smile as he recognised the voice, he saw two young men\r\nof senatorial rank—for both wore the crimson laticlave on the breast of\r\ntheir tunics—on horseback, followed by several slaves on foot, who had\r\novertaken him unnoticed amid the din and bustle which had drowned the\r\nclang of their horses’ feet on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I scarce know, Aurelius!\" replied the young man, laughing; \"I\r\nthought I was going home, but it seems that my back is turned to my own\r\nhouse, and I am going toward the market-place, although the Gods know that\r\nI have no business with the brawling lawyers, with whom it is alive by\r\nthis time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with us, then,\" replied the other; \"Aristius, here, and I, have made\r\na bet upon our coursers’ speed. He fancies his Numidian can outrun my\r\nGallic beauty. Come with us to the Campus; and after we have settled this\r\ngrave matter, we will try the _quinquertium_,(7) or a foot race in armor,\r\nif you like it better, or a swim in the Tiber, until it shall be time to\r\ngo to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I go with you, seeing that you are well mounted, and I afoot, and\r\nencumbered with my gown? You must consider me a second Achilles to keep up\r\nwith your fleet coursers, clad in this heavy toga, which is a worse garb\r\nfor running than any panoply that Vulcan ever wrought.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will alight,\" cried the other youth, who had not yet spoken, \"and give\r\nour horses to the boys to lead behind us; or, hark you, why not send Geta\r\nback to your house, and let your slaves bring down your horse too? If they\r\nmake tolerable speed, coming down by the back of the Cœlian, and thence\r\nbeside the _Aqua Crabra_(8) to the Carmental gate, they may overtake us\r\neasily before we reach the Campus. Aurelius has some errand to perform\r\nnear the Forum, which will detain us a few moments longer. What say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will come, he will come, certainly,\" cried the other, springing down\r\nlightly from the back of his beautiful courser, which indeed merited the\r\neulogium, as well as the caresses which he now lavished on it, patting his\r\nfavorite’s high-arched neck, and stroking the soft velvet muzzle, which\r\nwas thrust into his hand, with a low whinnying neigh of recognition, as he\r\nstood on the raised foot path, holding the embroidered rein carelessly in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Arvina, \"gladly; I have nothing to hinder me this morning;\r\nand for some days past I have been detained with business, so that I have\r\nnot visited the campus, or backed a horse, or cast a javelin—by Hercules!\r\nnot since the Ides, I fancy. You will all beat me in the field, that is\r\ncertain, and in the river likewise. But come, Fuscus Aristius, if it is to\r\nbe as you have planned it, jump down from your Numidian, and let your Geta\r\nride him up the hill to my house. I would have asked Aurelius, but he will\r\nlet no slave back his white NOTUS.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I, by the twin horsemen! nor any free man either—plebeian, knight, or\r\nnoble. Since first I bought him of the blue-eyed Celt, who wept in his\r\nbarbarian fondness for the colt, no leg save only mine has crossed his\r\nback, nor ever shall, while the light of day smiles on Aurelius Victor.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word Fuscus leaped from the back of the fine blood-bay barb he\r\nbestrode, and beckoning to a confidential slave who followed him, \"Here,\"\r\nhe said, \"Geta, take Nanthus, and ride straightway up the Minervium to the\r\nhouse of Arvina; thou knowest it, beside the Alban Mansions, and do as he\r\nshall command you. Tell him, my Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carry this signet, my good Geta,\" said the young man, drawing off the\r\nlarge seal-ring which adorned his right hand, and giving it to him, \"to\r\nThrasea, my trusty freedman, and let him see that they put the housings\r\nand gallic wolf-bit on the black horse Aufidus, and bring him thou, with\r\none of my slaves, down the slope of Scaurus, and past the Great Circus, to\r\nthe Carmental Gate, where thou wilt find us. Make good speed, Geta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, do so,\" interposed his master, \"but see that thou dost not blow\r\nNanthus; thou wert better be a dead slave, Geta, than let me find one drop\r\nof sweat on his flank. Nay! never grin, thou hang-dog, or I will have thee\r\ngiven to my Congers(9); the last which came out of the fish pond were but\r\nill fed; and a fat German, such as thou, would be a rare meal for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe slave laughed, knowing well that his master was but jesting, mounted\r\nthe horse, and rode him at a gentle trot, up the slope of the Cælian hill,\r\nfrom which Arvina had but a little while before descended. In the mean\r\ntime, Aristius gave the rein of his dappled grey to one of his followers,\r\ndesiring him to be very gentle with him, and the three young men sauntered\r\nslowly on along the Sacred Way toward the Forum, conversing merrily and\r\ninterchanging many a smile and salutation with those whom they met on\r\ntheir road.\r\n\r\nSkirting the base of the Palatine hill, they passed the old circular\r\ntemple of Remus to the right hand, and the most venerable relic of Rome’s\r\ninfancy, the Ruminal Fig tree, beneath which the she-wolf was believed to\r\nhave given suck to the twin progeny of Mars and the hapless Ilia. A little\r\nfarther on, the mouth of the sacred grotto called Lupercal, surrounded\r\nwith its shadowy grove, the favourite haunt of Pan, lay to their left; and\r\nfronting them, the splendid arch of Fabius, surnamed Allobrox for his\r\nvictorious prowess against that savage tribe, gave entrance to the great\r\nRoman Forum.\r\n\r\nImmediately at their left hand as they entered the archway, was the superb\r\nComitium, wherein the Senate were wont to give audience to foreign\r\nembassies of suppliant nations, with the gigantic portico, three columns\r\nof which may still be seen to testify to the splendor of the old city, in\r\nthe far days of the republic. Facing them were the steps of the Asylum,\r\nwith the Mamertine prison and the grand façade of the temple of Concord to\r\nthe right and left; and higher above these the portico of the gallery of\r\nrecords, and higher yet the temple of the thundering Jupiter, and\r\nglittering above all, against the dark blue sky, the golden dome, and\r\nwhite marble columns of the great capitol itself. Around in all directions\r\nwere basilicæ, or halls of justice; porticoes filled with busy lawyers;\r\nbankers’ shops glittering with their splendid wares, and bedecked with the\r\ngolden shields taken from the Samnites; statues of the renowned of ages,\r\nAccius Nævius, who cut the whetstone with the razor; Horatius Cocles on\r\nhis thunderstricken pedestal, halting on one knee from the wound which had\r\nnot hindered him from swimming the swollen Tiber; Clælia the hostage on\r\nher brazen steed; and many another, handed down inviolate from the days of\r\nthe ancient kings. Here was the rostrum, beaked with the prows of ships, a\r\nfluent orator already haranguing the assembled people from its\r\nplatform—there, the seat of the city Prætor, better known as the _Puteal\r\nLibonis_, with that officer in session on his curule chair, his six\r\nlictors leaning on their fasces at his back, as he promulgated his\r\nirrevocable edicts.\r\n\r\nIt was a grand sight, surely, and one to gaze on which men of the present\r\nday would do and suffer much; and judge themselves most happy if blessed\r\nwith one momentary glance of the heart, as it were, of the old world’s\r\nmistress. But these young men, proud as they were, and boastful of the\r\nglories of their native Rome, had looked too often on that busy scene to\r\nbe attracted by the gorgeousness of the place, crowded with buildings, the\r\nlike of which the modern world knows not, and thronged with nations of\r\nevery region of the earth, each in his proper dress, each seeking justice,\r\npleasure, profit, fame, as it pleased him, free, and fearless, and secure\r\nof property and person. Casting a brief glance over it, they turned short\r\nto the left, by a branch of the Sacred Way, which led, skirting the market\r\nplace, between the Comitium, or hall of the ambassadors, and the abrupt\r\ndeclivity of the Palatine, past the end of the Atrium of Liberty, and the\r\ncattle mart, toward the Carmental gate.\r\n\r\n\"Methought you said, my Fuscus, that our Aurelius had some errand to\r\nperform in the Forum; how is this, is it a secret?\" inquired Paullus,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"No secret, by the Gods!\" said Aurelius, \"it is but to buy a pair of spurs\r\nin Volero’s shop, hard by Vesta’s shrine.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will need them,\" cried Fuscus, \"he will need them, I will swear, in\r\nthe race.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to beat Nanthus,\" said Aurelius; \"but oh! Jove! walk quickly, I\r\nbeseech you; how hot a steam of cooked meats and sodden cabbage, reeks\r\nfrom the door of yon cook-shop. Now, by the Gods! it well nigh sickened\r\nme! Ha! Volero,\" he exclaimed, as they reached the door of a booth, or\r\nlittle shop, with neat leathern curtains festooned up in front, glittering\r\nwith polished cutlery and wares of steel and silver, to a middle aged man,\r\nwho was busy burnishing a knife within, \"what ho! my Volero, some spurs—I\r\nwant some spurs; show me some of your sharpest and brightest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a pair, noble Aurelius, which I got only yesterday in trade with a\r\nturbaned Moor from the deserts beyond Cyrenaica. By Mulciber, my patron\r\ngod! the fairest pair my eyes ever looked upon. Right loath was the swart\r\nbarbarian to let me have them, but hunger, hunger is a great tamer of your\r\nsavage; and the steam of good Furbo’s cook-shop yonder was suggestive of\r\nsavory chops and greasy sausages—and—and—in short, Aurelius, I got them at\r\na bargain.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, he produced the articles in question, from a strong\r\nbrass-bound chest, and rubbing them on his leather apron held them up for\r\nthe inspection of the youthful noble.\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" cried Victor, catching them out of his hand, \"truly, they are\r\ngood spurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good spurs! good spurs!\" cried the merchant, half indignantly, \"I call\r\nthem splendid, glorious, inimitable! Only look you here, it is all virgin\r\nsilver; and observe, I beseech you, this dragon’s neck and the sibilant\r\nhead that holds the rowels; they are wrought to the very life with horrent\r\nscales, and erected crest; beautiful! beautiful!—and the rowels too of the\r\nbest Spanish steel that was ever tempered in the cold Bilbilis. Good spurs\r\nindeed! they are well worth three _aurei_.(10) But I will keep them, as I\r\nmeant to do at first, for Caius Cæsar; he will know what they are worth,\r\nand give it too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didst ever hear so pestilent a knave?\" said Victor, laughing; \"one would\r\nsuppose I had disparaged the accursed things! But, as I said before, they\r\nare good spurs, and I will have them; but I will not give thee three\r\naurei, master Volero; two is enough, in all conscience; or sixty denarii\r\nat the most. Ho! Davus, Davus! bring my purse, hither, Davus,\" he called\r\nto his slaves without; and, as the purse-bearer entered, he continued\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, \"Give Volero two aurei, and ten denarii,\r\nand take these spurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" exclaimed Volero, \"you shall not—no! by the Gods! they cost me\r\nmore than that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye Gods! what a lie! cost thee—and to a barbarian! I dare be sworn thou\r\ndidst not pay him the ten denarii alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Hercules! I did, though,\" said the other, \"and thou shouldst not have\r\nthem for three _aurei_ either, but that it is drawing near the Calends of\r\nNovember, and I have moneys to pay then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty-five I will give thee—sixty-five denarii!\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me my spurs; what, art thou turning miser in thy youth, Aurelius?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, give him the gold, Davus; he is a regular usurer. Give him three\r\n_aurei_, and then buckle these to my heel. Ha! that is well, my Paullus,\r\nhere come your fellows with black Aufidus, and our friend Geta on the\r\nNumidian. They have made haste, yet not sweated Nanthus either. Aristius,\r\nyour groom is a good one; I never saw a horse that shewed his keeping or\r\ncondition better. Now then, Arvina, doff your toga, you will not surely\r\nride in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I will not,\" replied Paullus, \"if master Volero will suffer me to\r\nleave it here till my return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly, willingly; but what is this?\" exclaimed the cutler, as Arvina\r\nunbuckling his toga and suffering it to drop on the ground, stood clad in\r\nhis succinct and snow-white tunic only, girded about him with a zone of\r\npurple leather, in which was stuck the sheathless dirk of Cataline. \"What\r\nis this, noble Paullus? that you carry at your belt, with no scabbard? If\r\nyou go armed, you should at least go safely. See, if you were to bend your\r\nbody somewhat quickly, it might well be that the keen point would rend\r\nyour groin. Give it me, I can fit it with a sheath in a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know but it were as well to do so,\" answered Paullus,\r\nextricating the dagger from his belt, \"if you will not detain us a long\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even a short time!\" said the cutler, \"give it to me, I can fit it\r\nimmediately.\" And he stretched out his hand and took it; but hardly had\r\nhis eye dwelt on it, for a moment, when he cried, \"but this is not\r\nyours—this is—where got you this, Arvina?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, it is nought to thee; perhaps I bought it, perhaps it was given to\r\nme; do thou only fit it with a scabbard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Buy it thou didst not, Paullus, I’ll be sworn; and I think it was never\r\ngiven thee; and, see, see here, what is this I—there has been blood on the\r\nblade!\"\r\n\r\n\"Folly!\" exclaimed the young man, turning first very red and then pale, so\r\nthat his comrades gazed on him with wonder, \"folly, I say. It is not\r\nblood, but water that has dimmed its shine;—and how knowest thou that I\r\ndid not buy it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know it?—thus,\" answered the artizan, drawing from a cupboard\r\nunder his counter, a weapon precisely the facsimile in every respect of\r\nthat in his hand: \"There never were but two of these made, and I made\r\nthem; the scabbard of this will fit that; see how the very chased work\r\nfits! I sold this, but not to you, Arvina; and I do not believe that it\r\nwas given to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Filth that thou art, and carrion!\" exclaimed the young man fiercely,\r\nstriking his hand with violence upon the counter, \"darest thou brave a\r\nnobleman? I tell thee, I doubt not at all that there be twenty such in\r\nevery cutler’s shop in Rome!—but to whom did’st thou sell this, that thou\r\nart so certain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Paullus Cæcilius,\" replied the mechanic gravely but respectfully, \"I\r\nbrave no man, least of all a patrician; but mark my words—I did sell this\r\ndagger; here is my own mark on its back; if it was given to thee, thou\r\nmust needs know the giver; for the rest, this _is_ blood that has dimmed\r\nit, and not water; you cannot deceive me in the matter; and I would warn\r\nyou, youth,—noble as you are, and plebeian I,—that there are laws in Rome,\r\none of them called CORNELIA DE SICARIIS, which you were best take care\r\nthat you know not more nearly. Meantime, you can take this scabbard if you\r\nwill,\" handing to him, as he spoke, the sheath of the second weapon; \"the\r\nprice is one sestertium; it is the finest silver, chased as you see, and\r\noverlaid with pure gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast the money,\" returned Paullus, casting down on the counter\r\nseveral golden coins, stamped with a helmed head of Mars, and an eagle on\r\nthe reverse, grasping a thunderbolt in its talons—\"and the sheath is mine.\r\nThen thou wilt not disclose to whom it was sold?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I, since thou knowest without telling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou, or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to thee, Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then will I find some one, to whom thou wilt fain disclose it!\" he\r\nanswered haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"And who may that be, I beseech you?\" asked the mechanic, half sneeringly.\r\n\"For my part, I fancy you will let it rest altogether; some one was hurt\r\nwith it last night, as you and _he_, we both know, can tell if you will!\r\nBut I knew not that you were one of his men.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an insolent sneer on the cutler’s face that galled the young\r\nnobleman to the quick; and what was yet more annoying, there was an\r\nassumption of mutual intelligence and equality about him, that almost\r\ngoaded the patrician’s blood to fury. But by a mighty effort he subdued\r\nhis passion to his will; and snatching up the weapon returned it to his\r\nbelt, left the shop, and springing to the saddle of his beautiful black\r\nhorse, rode furiously away. It was not till he reached the Carmental Gate,\r\ngiving egress from the city through the vast walls of Cyclopean\r\narchitecture, immediately at the base of the dread Tarpeian rock,\r\noverlooked and commanded by the outworks and turrets of the capitol, that\r\nhe drew in his eager horse, and looked behind him for his friends. But\r\nthey were not in sight; and a moment’s reflection told him that, being\r\nabout to start their coursers on a trial of speed, they would doubtless\r\nride gently over the rugged pavement of the crowded streets.\r\n\r\nHe doubted for a minute, whether he should turn back to meet them, or wait\r\nfor their arrival at the gate, by which they must pass to gain the campus;\r\nbut the fear of missing them, instantly induced him to adopt the latter\r\ncourse, and he sat for a little space motionless on his well-bitted and\r\nobedient horse beneath the shadow of the deep gate-way.\r\n\r\nHere his eye wandered around him for awhile, taking note indeed of the\r\nsurrounding objects, the great temple of Jupiter Stator on the Palatine;\r\nthe splendid portico of Catulus, adorned with the uncouth and grisly\r\nspoils of the Cimbric hordes slaughtered on the plains of Vercellæ; the\r\nhouse of Scaurus, toward which a slow wain tugged by twelve powerful oxen\r\nwas even then dragging one of the pondrous columns which rendered his hall\r\nfor many years the boast of Roman luxury; and on the other tall buildings\r\nthat stood every where about him; although in truth he scarce observed\r\nwhat for the time his eye dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nAt length an impatient motion of his horse caused him to turn his face\r\ntoward the black precipice of the huge rock at whose base he sat, and in a\r\nmoment it fastened upon his mind with singular vividness—singular, for he\r\nhad paused fifty times upon that spot before, without experiencing such\r\nfeelings—that he was on the very pavement, which had so often been\r\nbespattered with the blood of despairing traitors. The noble Manlius,\r\ntumbled from the very rock, which his single arm had but a little while\r\nbefore defended, seemed to lie there, even at his feet, mortally maimed\r\nand in the agony of death, yet even so too proud to mix one groan with the\r\ncurses he poured forth against Rome’s democratic rabble. Then, by a not\r\ninapt transition, the scene changed, and Caius Marcius was at hand, with\r\nthe sword drawn in his right, that won him the proud name of Coriolanus,\r\nand the same rabble that had hurled Caius Manlius down, yelling and\r\nhooting \"to the rock with him! to the rock!\" but at a safe and respectful\r\ndistance; their factious tribunes goading them to outrage and new riot.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that these thoughts should have occurred so clearly at this\r\nmoment to the excited mind of the young noble; and he felt that it was\r\nstrange himself; and would have banished the ideas, but they would not\r\naway; and he continued musing on the inconstant turbulence of the\r\nplebeians, and the unerring doom which had overtaken every one of their\r\nidols, from the hands of their own partizans, until his companions at\r\nlength rode slowly up the street to join him.\r\n\r\nThere was some coldness in the manner of Aristius Fuscus, as they met\r\nagain, and even Aurelius seemed surprised and not well pleased; for they\r\nhad in truth been conversing earnestly about the perturbation of their\r\nfriend at the remarks of the artizan, and the singularity of his conduct\r\nin wearing arms at all; and he heard Victor say just before they joined\r\ncompany—\r\n\r\n\"No! that is not so odd, Fuscus, in these times. It was but two nights\r\nsince, as I was coming home something later than my wont from Terentia’s,\r\nthat I fell in with Clodius reeling along, frantically drunk and furious,\r\nwith half a dozen torch-bearers before, and half a score wolfish looking\r\ngladiators all armed with blade and buckler, and all half-drunk, behind\r\nhim. I do assure you that I almost swore I would go out no more without\r\nweapons.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would have done you no good, man,\" said Aristius, \"if some nineteen\r\nor twenty had set upon you. But an they would, I care not; it is against\r\nthe law, and no good citizen should carry them at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carry arms, I suppose you mean, Aristius,\" interrupted Paullus boldly.\r\n\"Ye are talking about me, I fancy—is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it is,\" replied the other gravely. \"You were disturbed not a little\r\nat what stout Volero said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was, I was,\" answered Arvina very quickly, \"because I could not tell\r\nhim; and it is not pleasant to be suspected. The truth is that the dagger\r\nis not mine at all, and that it _is_ blood that was on it; for last\r\nnight—but lo!\" he added, interrupting himself, \"I was about to speak out,\r\nand tell you all; and yet my lips are sealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to hear it,\" said Aristius, \"I do not like mysteries; and this\r\nseems to me a dark one!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is—as dark as Erebus,\" said Paullus eagerly, \"and as guilty too; but\r\nit is not my mystery, so help me the god of good faith and honour!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is enough said; surely that is enough for you, Aristius,\" exclaimed\r\nthe warmer and more excitable Aurelius.\r\n\r\n\"For you it may be,\" replied the noble youth, with a melancholy smile.\r\n\"You are a boy in heart, my Aurelius, and overflow so much with generosity\r\nand truth that you believe all others to be as frank and candid. I alas!\r\nhave grown old untimely, and, having seen what I have seen, hold men’s\r\nassertions little worth.\"\r\n\r\nThe hot blood mounted fiercely into the cheek of Paullus; and, striking\r\nhis horse’s flank suddenly with his heel, he made him passage half across\r\nthe street, and would have seized Aristius by the throat, had not their\r\ncomrade interposed to hinder him.\r\n\r\n\"You are both mad, I believe; so mad that all the hellebore in both the\r\nAnticyras could not cure you. Thou, Fuscus, for insulting him with\r\nneedless doubts. Thou, Paullus, for mentioning the thing, or shewing the\r\ndagger at all, if you did not choose to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do _choose_ to explain,\" replied Cæcilius, \"but I cannot; I have\r\nexplained it all to Marcus Tullius.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Cicero,\" exclaimed Aristius. \"Why did you not say so before? I was\r\nwrong, then, I confess my error; if Cicero be satisfied, it must needs be\r\nall well.\"\r\n\r\n\"That name of Cicero is like the voice of an oracle to Fuscus ever!\" said\r\nAurelius Victor, laughing. \"I believe he thinks the new man from Arpinum a\r\nvery god, descended from Olympus!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! not a God,\" replied Aristius Fuscus, \"only the greatest work of God,\r\na wise and virtuous man, in an age which has few such to boast. But come,\r\nlet us ride on and conclude our race; and thou, Arvina, forget what I\r\nsaid; I meant not to wrong thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have forgotten,\" answered Paullus; and, with the word, they gave their\r\nhorses head, and cantered onward for the field of Mars.\r\n\r\nThe way for some distance was narrow, lying between the fortified rock of\r\nthe Capitol, with its stern lines of immemorial ramparts on the right\r\nhand, and on the left the long arcades and stately buildings of the\r\nvegetable mart, on the river bank, now filled with sturdy peasants, from\r\nthe Sabine country, eager to sell their fresh green herbs; and blooming\r\ngirls, from Tibur and the banks of Anio, with garlands of flowers, and\r\ncheeks that outvied their own brightest roses.\r\n\r\nBeyond these, still concealing the green expanse of the level plain, and\r\nthe famous river, stood side by side three temples, sacred to Juno Matuta,\r\nPiety, and Hope; each with its massy colonnade of Doric or Corinthian, or\r\nIonic pillars; the latter boasting its frieze wrought in bronze; and that\r\nof Piety, its tall equestrian statue, so richly gilt and burnished that it\r\ngleamed in the sunlight as if it were of solid gold.\r\n\r\nOnward they went, still at a merry canter, their generous and high mettled\r\ncoursers fretting against the bits which restrained their speed, and their\r\nyoung hearts elated and bounding quickly in their bosoms, with the\r\nexcitement of the gallant exercise; and now they cleared the last winding\r\nof the suburban street, and clothed in its perennial verdure, the wide\r\nfield lay outspread, like one sheet of emerald verdure, before them, with\r\nthe bright Tiber flashing to the sun in many a reach and ripple, and the\r\ngay slope of the Collis Hortulorum, glowing with all its terraced gardens\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more brought them to the Flaminian way, whereon, nearly\r\nmidway the plain, stood the _diribitorium_, or pay-office of the troops;\r\nthe porticoes of which were filled with the soldiers of Metellus Creticus,\r\nand Quintus Marcius Rex, who lay with their armies encamped on the low\r\nhills beyond the river, waiting their triumphs, and forbidden by the laws\r\nto come into the city so long as they remained invested with their\r\nmilitary rank. Around this stately building were many colonnades, and open\r\nbuildings adapted to the exercises of the day, when winter or bad weather\r\nshould prevent their performance in the open mead, and stored with all\r\nappliances, and instruments required for the purpose; and to these Paullus\r\nand his friends proceeded, answering merely with a nod or passing jest the\r\nsalutations of many a helmed centurion and gorgeous tribune of the\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\nA grand Ionic gateway gave them admittance to the hippodrome, a vast oval\r\nspace, adorned with groups of sculpture and obelisks and columns in the\r\nmidst; on some of which were affixed inscriptions commemorative of great\r\nfeats of skill or strength or daring; while others displayed placards\r\nannouncing games or contests to take place in future, and challenges of\r\ncelebrated gymnasts for the cestus fight, the wrestling match, or the\r\nfoot-race.\r\n\r\nAround the outer circumference were rows of seats, shaded by plane trees\r\noverrun with ivy, and there were already seated many young men of noble\r\nbirth, chatting together, or betting, with their waxed tablets and their\r\n_styli_(11) in their hands, some waiting the commencement of the race\r\nbetween Fuscus and Victor, others watching with interest the progress of a\r\nsham fight on horseback between two young men of the equestrian order,\r\ndenoted by the narrow crimson stripes on their tunics, who were careering\r\nto and fro, armed with long staves and circular bucklers, in all the swift\r\nand beautiful movements of the mimic combat.\r\n\r\nAmong those most interested in this spectacle, the eye of Arvina fell\r\ninstantly on the tall and gaunt form of Catiline, who stood erect on one\r\nof the marble benches, applauding with his hands, and now and then\r\nshouting a word of encouragement to the combatants, as they wheeled by him\r\nin the mazes of their half angry sport. It was not long, however, before\r\ntheir strife was brought to a conclusion; for, almost as the friends\r\nentered, the hindmost horseman of the two made a thrust at the other,\r\nwhich taking effect merely on the lower rim of his antagonist’s _parma_,\r\nglanced off under his outstretched arm, and made the striker, in a great\r\nmeasure, lose his balance. As quick as light, the other wheeled upon him,\r\nfeinted a pass at his breast with the point of the staff; and then, as he\r\nlowered his shield to guard himself, reversed the weapon with a swift turn\r\nof the wrist, dealt him a heavy blow with the trunchon on the head; and\r\nthen, while the whole place rang with tumultuous plaudits, circled\r\nentirely round him to the left, and delivered his thrust with such effect\r\nin the side, that it bore his competitor clear out of the saddle.\r\n\r\n\"Euge! Euge! well done,\" shouted Catiline in ecstacy; \"by Hercules! I\r\nnever saw in all my life better skirmishing. It is all over with Titus\r\nVarus!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in truth it was all over with him; but not in the sense which the\r\nspeaker meant: for, as he fell, the horses came into collision, and it so\r\nhappened that the charger of the conqueror, excited by the fury of the\r\ncontest, laid hold of the other’s neck with his teeth, and almost tore\r\naway a piece of the muscular flesh at the very moment when the rider’s\r\nspur, as he fell, cut a long gash in his flank.\r\n\r\nWith a wild yelling neigh, the tortured brute yerked out his heels\r\nviciously; and, as ill luck would have it, both took effect on the person\r\nof his fallen master, one striking him a terrible blow on the chest, the\r\nother shattering his collar bone and shoulder.\r\n\r\nA dozen of the spectators sprang down from the seats and took him up\r\nbefore Paullus could dismount to aid him; but, as they raised him from the\r\nground, his eyes were already glazing.\r\n\r\n\"Marcius has conquered me,\" he muttered in tones of deep mortification,\r\nunconscious, as it would seem, of his agony, and wounded only by the\r\nindomitable Roman pride; and with the words his jaw dropped, and his last\r\nstrife was ended.\r\n\r\n\"The fool!\" exclaimed Cataline, with a bitter sneer; \"what had he got to\r\ndo, that he should ride against Caius Marcius, when he could not so much\r\nas keep his saddle, the fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is gone!\" cried another; \"game to the last, brave Varus!\"\r\n\r\n\"He came of a brave race,\" said a third; \"but he rode badly!\"\r\n\r\n\"At least not so well as Marcius,\" replied yet a fourth; \"but who does? To\r\nbe foiled by him does not argue bad riding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who does? why Paullus, here,\" cried Aurelius Victor; \"I’ll match him, if\r\nhe will ride, for a thousand sesterces—ten thousand, if you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! I’ll not bet about it. I lost by this cursed chance,\" answered the\r\nformer speaker; \"but Varus did not ride badly, I maintain it!\" he added,\r\nwith the steadiness of a discomfited partisan.\r\n\r\n\"Ay! but he did, most pestilently,\" interposed Catiline, almost fiercely;\r\n\"but come, come, why don’t they carry him away? we are losing all the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was a friend of yours, Sergius,\" said another of the\r\nbystanders, apparently vexed at the heartlessness of his manner.\r\n\r\n\"Why, ay! so he was,\" replied the conspirator; \"but he is nothing now: nor\r\ncan my friendship aught avail him. It was his time and his fate! ours, it\r\nmay be, will come to-morrow. Nor do I see at all wherefore our sports\r\nshould not proceed, because a man has gone hence. Fifty men every day die\r\nsomewhere, while we are dining, drinking, kissing our mistresses or wives;\r\nbut do we stop for that? Ho! bear him hence, we will attend his funeral,\r\nwhen it shall be soever; and we will drink to his memory to-day. What\r\ncomes next, comrades?\"\r\n\r\nArvina, it is true, was for a moment both shocked and disgusted at the\r\nheartless and unfeeling tone; but few if any of the others evinced the\r\nlike tenderness; for it must be remembered, in the first place, that the\r\nRomans, inured to sights of blood and torture daily in the gladiatorial\r\nfights of the arena, were callous to human suffering, and careless of\r\nhuman life at all times; and, in the second, that Stoicism was the\r\npredominant affectation of the day, not only among the rude and coarse,\r\nbut among the best and most virtuous citizens of the republic. Few,\r\ntherefore, left the ground, when the corpse, decently enveloped in the\r\ntoga he had worn when living, was borne homewards; except the involuntary\r\nhomicide, who could not even at that day in decency remain, and a few of\r\nhis most intimate associates, who covering their faces in the lappets of\r\ntheir gowns, followed the bearers in stern and silent sorrow.\r\n\r\nScarcely then had the sad procession threaded the marble archway, before\r\nCatiline again asked loudly and imperiously,\r\n\r\n\"What is to be the next, I pray you? are we to sit here like old women by\r\ntheir firesides, croaking and whimpering till dinner time?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! by the gods,\" cried Aurelius, \"we have a race to come off, which I\r\npropose to win. Fuscus Aristius here, and I—we will start instantly, if no\r\none else has the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away with you then,\" answered the other; \"come sit by me, Arvina, I would\r\nsay a word with you.\"\r\n\r\nGiving his horse to one of his grooms, the young man followed him without\r\nanswer; for although it is true that Catiline was at this time a marked\r\nman and of no favorable reputation, yet squeamishness in the choice of\r\nassociates was never a characteristic of the Romans; and persons, the\r\nknown perpetrators of the most atrocious crimes, so long as they were\r\nunconvicted, mingled on terms of equality, unshunned by any, except the\r\ngravest and most rigid censors. Arvina, too, was very young; and very\r\nyoung men are often fascinated, as it were, by great reputations, even of\r\ngreat criminals, with a passionate desire to see them more closely, and\r\nobserve the stuff they are made of. So that, in fact, Catiline being\r\nlooked upon in those days much as a desperate gambler, a celebrated\r\nduellist, or a famous seducer of our own time, whom no one shuns though\r\nevery one abuses, it was not perhaps very wonderful if this rash, ardent,\r\nand inexperienced youth should have conceived himself flattered by such\r\nnotice, from one of whom all the world was talking; and should have\r\nfollowed him to a seat with a sense of gratified vanity, blended with\r\neager curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe race, which followed, differed not much from any other race; except\r\nthat the riders having no stirrups, that being a yet undiscovered luxury,\r\nmuch less depended upon jockeyship—the skill of the riders being limited\r\nto keeping their seats steadily and guiding the animals they bestrode—and\r\nmuch more upon the native powers, the speed and endurance of the coursers.\r\n\r\nSo much, however, was Arvina interested by the manner and conversation of\r\nthe singular man by whose side he sat, and who was indeed laying himself\r\nout with deep art to captivate him, and take his mind, as it were, by\r\nstorm, now with the boldest and most daring paradoxes; now with bursts of\r\neloquent invective against the oppression and aristocratic insolence of\r\nthe cabal, which by his shewing governed Rome; and now with sarcasm and\r\npungent wit, that he saw but little of the course, which he had come\r\nespecially to look at.\r\n\r\n\"Do you indeed ride so well, my Paullus?\" asked his companion suddenly, as\r\nif the thought had been suggested by some observation he had just made on\r\nthe competitors, as they passed in the second circuit. \"So well, I mean,\r\nas Aurelius Victor said; and would you undertake the combat of the horse\r\nand spear with Caius Marcius?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly I would,\" said Arvina, blushing slightly; \"I have interchanged many\r\na blow and thrust with young Varro, whom our master-at-arms holds better\r\nwith the spear than Marcius; and I feel myself his equal. I have been\r\npractising a good deal of late,\" he added modestly; \"for, though perhaps\r\nyou know it not, I have been elected _decurio_;(12) and, as first chosen,\r\nleader of a troop, and am to take the field with the next reinforcements\r\nthat go out to Pontus to our great Pompey.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next reinforcements,\" replied Catiline with a meditative air: \"ha!\r\nthat may be some time distant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, by Jupiter! my Sergius; we are already ordered to hold ourselves\r\nin readiness to march for Brundusium, where we shall ship for Pontus. I\r\nfancy we shall set forth as soon as the consular comitia have been held.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so,\" said the other; \"but I do not think it. There may fall out\r\nthat which shall rather summon Pompey homeward, than send more men to join\r\nhim. That is a very handsome dagger,\" he broke off, interrupting himself\r\nsuddenly—\"where did you get it? I should like much to get me such an one\r\nto give to my friend Cethegus, who has a taste for such things. I wonder,\r\nhowever, at your wearing it so openly.\"\r\n\r\nTaken completely by surprise, Arvina answered hastily, \"I found it last\r\nnight; and I wear it, hoping to find the owner.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Hercules!\" said the conspirator laughing; \"I would not take so much\r\npains, were I you. But, do you hear, I have partly a mind myself to claim\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! you were better not,\" said Paullus, gravely; \"besides, you can get\r\none just like this, without risking any thing. Volero, the cutler, in the\r\nSacred Way, near Vesta’s temple, has one precisely like to this for sale.\r\nHe made this too, he tells me; though he will not tell me to whom he sold\r\nit; but that shall soon be got out of him, notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! are you so anxious in the matter? it would oblige you, then, if I\r\nshould confess myself the loser! Well, I don’t want to buy another; I want\r\nthis very one. I believe I must claim it.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with an emphasis so singular; impressive, and at the same time\r\nhalf-derisive, and with so strangely-meaning an expression, that Paullus\r\nindeed scarcely knew what to think; but, in the mean time, he had\r\nrecovered his own self-possession, and merely answered—\r\n\r\n\"I think you had better not; it would perhaps be dangerous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous? Ha! that is another motive. I love danger! verily, I believe I\r\nmust; yes! I must claim it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Paullus, turning pale from excitement; \"Is it yours? Do\r\nyou say that it is yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! look!\" exclaimed Catiline, springing to his feet; \"here they come,\r\nhere they come now; this is the last round. By the gods! but they are\r\ngallant horses, and well matched! See how the bay courser stretches\r\nhimself, and how quickly he gathers! The bay! the bay has it for five\r\nhundred sesterces!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wager you,\" said a dissolute-looking long-haired youth; \"I wager you\r\nfive hundred, Catiline. I say the gray horse wins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so, then,\" shouted Catiline; \"the bay, the bay! spur, spur,\r\nAristius Fuscus, Aurelius gains on you; spur, spur!\"\r\n\r\n\"The gray, the gray! There is not a horse in Rome can touch Aurelius\r\nVictor’s gray South-wind!\" replied the other.\r\n\r\nAnd in truth, Victor’s Gallic courser repaid his master’s vaunts; for he\r\nmade, though he had seemed beat, so desperate a rally, that he rushed past\r\nthe bay Arab almost at the goal, and won by a clear length amidst the\r\nroars of the glad spectators.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost, plague on it!\" exclaimed Catiline; \"and here is Clodius\r\nexpects to be paid on the instant, I’ll be sworn.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke, the debauchee with whom he had betted came up, holding\r\nhis left hand extended, tapping its palm with the forefinger of the right.\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" he said, \"I told you so; where be the sesterces?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must needs wait a while; I have not my purse with me,\" Catiline\r\nbegan. But Paullus interrupted him—\r\n\r\n\"I have, I have, my Sergius; permit me to accommodate you.\" And suiting\r\nthe action to the word, he gave the conspirator several large gold coins,\r\nadding, \"you can repay me when it suits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be never,\" said Clodius with a sneer; \"you don’t know Lucius\r\nCatiline, I see, young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but he does!\" replied the other, with a sarcastic grin; \"for Catiline\r\nnever forgets a friend, or forgives a foe. Can Clodius say the same?\"\r\n\r\nBut Clodius merely smiled, and walked off, clinking the money he had won\r\ntauntingly in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What now, I wonder, is the day destined to bring forth?\" said the\r\nconspirator, making no more allusion to the dagger.\r\n\r\n\"A contest now between myself, Aristius, and Aurelius, in the five games\r\nof the _quinquertium_, and then a foot race in the heaviest panoply.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! can you beat them?\" asked Catiline, regarding Arvina with an interest\r\nthat grew every moment keener, as he saw more of his strength and daring\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\"I can try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I bet on you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please. I can beat them in some, I think; and, as I said, I will\r\ntry in all.\"\r\n\r\nMore words followed, for Paullus hastened away to strip and anoint himself\r\nfor the coming struggle; and in a little while the strife itself\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nTo describe this would be tedious; but suffice it, that while he won\r\ndecidedly three games of the five, Paullus was beat in none; and that in\r\nthe armed foot race, the most toilsome and arduous exercise of the Campus,\r\nhe not only beat his competitors with ease; but ran the longest course,\r\ncarrying the most ponderous armature and shield, in shorter time than had\r\nbeen performed within many years on the Field of Mars.\r\n\r\nCatiline watched him eagerly all the while, inspecting him as a purchaser\r\nwould a horse he was about to buy; and then, muttering to himself, \"We\r\nmust have him!\" walked up to join him as he finished the last exploit.\r\n\r\n\"Will you dine with me, Paullus,\" he said, \"to-day, and meet the loveliest\r\nwomen you can see in Rome, and no prudes either?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly,\" he replied; \"but I must swim first in the Tiber!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so, there is time enough; I will swim also.\" And they moved down in\r\ncompany toward the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALSE LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Fie, fie, upon her;\r\n               There’s a language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;\r\n               Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out\r\n               At every joint and motive of her body.\r\n                  TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.\r\n\r\nAbout three hours later than the scene in the Campus Martius, which had\r\noccurred a little after noon, Catiline was standing richly dressed in a\r\nbright saffron(13) robe, something longer than the ordinary tunic,\r\nflowered with sprigs of purple, in the inmost chamber of the woman’s\r\napartments, in his own heavily mortgaged mansion. His wife, Aurelia\r\nOrestilla, sat beside him on a low stool, a woman of the most superb and\r\nqueenly beauty—for whom it was believed that he had plunged himself into\r\nthe deepest guilt—and still, although past the prime of Italian womanhood,\r\npossessing charms that might well account for the most insane passion.\r\n\r\nA slave was listening with watchful and half terrified attention to the\r\ninjunctions of his lord—for Catiline was an unscrupulous and severe\r\nmaster—and, as he ceased speaking, he made a deep genuflexion and retired.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he gone than Catiline turned quickly to the lady, whose\r\nlovely face wore some marks of displeasure, and said rather shortly,\r\n\r\n\"You have not gone to her, my Aurelia. There is no time to lose; the young\r\nman will be here soon, and if they meet, ere you have given her the cue,\r\nall will be lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not like it, my Sergius,\" said the woman, rising, but making no\r\nmovement to leave the chamber.\r\n\r\n\"And why not, I beseech you, madam?\" he replied angrily; \"or what is there\r\nin that which I desire you to tell the girl to do, that you have not done\r\ntwenty times yourself, and Fulvia, and Sempronia, and half Rome’s noblest\r\nladies? Tush! I say, tush! go do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is my daughter, Sergius,\" answered Aurelia, in a tone of deep\r\ntenderness; \"a daughter’s honor must be something to every mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"And a son’s life to every father!\" said Catiline with a fierce sneer. \"I\r\nhad a son once, I remember. You wished to enter an (14)_empty_ house on\r\nthe day of your marriage feast. I do not think you found him in your way!\r\nBesides, for honor—if I read Lucia’s eyes rightly, there is not much of\r\nthat to emperil.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke of his son, she covered her face in her richly jewelled\r\nhands, and a slight shudder shook her whole frame. When she looked up\r\nagain, she was pale as death, and her lips quivered as she asked—\r\n\r\n\"Must I, then? Oh! be merciful, my Sergius.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must, Aurelia!\" he replied sternly, \"and that now. Our fortunes, nay,\r\nour lives, depend on it!\"\r\n\r\n\"_All_—must she give all, Lucius?\"\r\n\r\n\"All that he asks! But fear not, he shall wed her, when our plans shall be\r\ncrowned with triumph!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you swear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods! he shall! by all the Furies, if you will, by Earth, and\r\nHeaven, and Hades!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go,\" she replied, something reassured, \"and prepare her for the\r\ntask!\"\r\n\r\n\"The task!\" he muttered with his habitual sneer. \"Daintily worded, fair\r\none; but it will not, I fancy, prove a hard one; Paullus is young and\r\nhandsome; and our soft Lucia has, methinks, something of her mother’s\r\nyielding tenderness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you reproach me with it, Sergius?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! rather I adore thee for it, loveliest one; but go and prepare our\r\nLucia.\" Then, as she left the room, the dark scowl settled down on his\r\nblack brow, and he clinched his hand as he said—\r\n\r\n\"She waxes stubborn—let her beware! She is not half so young as she was;\r\nand her beauty wanes as fast as my passion for it; let her beware how she\r\ncrosses me!\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking yet a slave entered, and announced that Paullus\r\nCæcilius Arvina had arrived, and Curius, and the noble Fulvia; and as he\r\nreceived the tidings the frown passed away from the brow of the\r\nconspirator, and putting on his mask of smooth, smiling dissimulation, he\r\nwent forth to meet his guests.\r\n\r\nThey were assembled in the tablinum, or saloon, Arvina clad in a violet\r\ncolored tunic, sprinkled with flowers in their natural hues, and Curius—a\r\nslight keen-looking man, with a wild, proud expression, giving a sort of\r\ninterest to a countenance haggard from the excitement of passion, in one\r\nof rich crimson, fringed at the wrists and neck with gold. Fulvia, his\r\nparamour, a woman famed throughout Rome alike for her licentiousness and\r\nbeauty, was hanging on his arm, glittering with chains and carcanets, and\r\nbracelets of the costliest gems, in her fair bosom all too much displayed\r\nfor a matron’s modesty; on her round dazzling arms; about her swan-like\r\nneck; wreathed in the profuse tresses of her golden hair—for she was that\r\nunusual and much admired being, an Italian blonde—and, spanning the\r\ncircumference of her slight waist. She was, indeed, a creature exquisitely\r\nbright and lovely, with such an air of mild and angelic candor pervading\r\nher whole face, that you would have sworn her the most innocent, the\r\npurest of her sex. Alas! that she was indeed almost the vilest! that she\r\nwas that rare monster, a woman, who, linked with every crime and baseness\r\nthat can almost unsex a woman, preserves yet in its height, one eminent\r\nand noble virtue, one half-redeeming trait amidst all her infamy, in her\r\nproud love of country! Name, honor, virtue, conscience, womanhood, truth,\r\npiety, all, all, were sacrificed to her rebellious passions. But to her\r\nlove of country she could have sacrificed those very passions! That frail\r\nabandoned wretch was still a Roman—might have been in a purer age a\r\nheroine of Rome’s most glorious.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, most lovely Fulvia,\" exclaimed the host, gliding softly into the\r\nroom. \"By Mars! the most favored of immortals! You must have stolen\r\nAphrodite’s cestus! Saw you her ever look so beautiful, my Paullus? You do\r\nwell to put those sapphires in your hair, for they wax pale and dim\r\nbesides the richer azure of your eyes; and the dull gold in which they are\r\nenchased sets off the sparkling splendor of your tresses. What, Fulvia,\r\nknow you not young Arvina—one of the great Cæcilii? By Hercules! my\r\nCurius, he won the best of the quinquertium from such competitors as\r\nVictor and Aristius Fuscus, and ran twelve stadii, with the heaviest\r\nbreast-plate and shield in the armory, quicker than it has been performed\r\nsince the days of Licinius Celer. I prithee, know, and cherish him, my\r\nfriends, for I would have him one of us. In truth I would, my Paullus.\"\r\n\r\nThe flattering words of the tempter, and the more fascinating smiles and\r\nglances of the bewitching siren, were not thrown away on the young noble;\r\nand these, with the soft perfumed atmosphere, the splendidly voluptuous\r\nfurniture of the saloon, and the delicious music, which was floating all\r\nthe while upon his ears from the blended instruments and voices of unseen\r\nminstrels, conspired to plunge his senses into a species of effeminate and\r\nluxurious languor, which suited well the ulterior views of Catiline.\r\n\r\n\"One thing alone has occurred,\" resumed the host, after some moments spent\r\nin light jests and trivial conversation, \"to decrease our pleasure:\r\nCethegus was to have dined with us to-day, and Decius Brutus, with his\r\ninimitable wife Sempronia. But they have disappointed us; and, save\r\nAurelia only, and our poor little Lucia, there will be none but ourselves\r\nto eat my Umbrian boar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a boar, my Sergius?\" exclaimed Curius, eagerly, who was addicted\r\nto the pleasures of the table, almost as much as the charms of women. \"By\r\nPan, the God of Hunters! we are in luck to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore comes not Sempronia?\" inquired Fulvia, not very much\r\ndispleased by the absence of a rival beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Brutus is called away, it appears, suddenly to Tarentum upon business;\r\nand she\"—\r\n\r\n\"Prefers entertaining our Cethegus, alone in her own house, I fancy,\"\r\ninterrupted Fulvia.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so,\" replied Catiline, with a smile of meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Happy Cethegus,\" said Arvina.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think her so handsome?\" asked Fulvia, favoring him with one of her\r\nmost melting glances.\r\n\r\n\"The handsomest woman,\" he replied, \"with but one exception, I ever had\r\nthe luck to look upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!—and pray, who is the exception?\" asked the lady, very tartly.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be lying on a marble slab, near to the place where they\r\nwere standing, a small round mirror of highly polished steel, set in a\r\nframe of tortoiseshell and gold. Paullus had noticed it before she spoke;\r\nand taking it up without a moment’s pause, he raised it to her face.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said, \"look into that, and blush at your question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prettily said, my Paullus; thy wit is as fleet as thy foot is speedy,\"\r\nsaid the conspirator.\r\n\r\n\"Flatterer!\" whispered the lady, evidently much delighted; and then, in a\r\nlower voice she added, \"Do you indeed think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Else may I never hope.\"\r\n\r\nBut at this moment the curtains were drawn aside, and Orestilla entered\r\nfrom the gallery of the peristyle, accompanied by her daughter Lucia.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a girl of about eighteen years old, and of appearance so\r\nremarkable, that she must not be passed unnoticed. In person she was\r\nextremely tall and slender, and at first sight you would have supposed her\r\nthin; until the wavy outlines of the loose robe of plain white linen which\r\nshe wore, undulating at every movement of her form, displayed the\r\nexquisite fulness of her swelling bust, and the voluptuous roundness of\r\nall her lower limbs. Her arms, which were bare to the shoulders, where her\r\ngown was fastened by two studs of gold, were quite unadorned, by any gem\r\nor bracelet, and although beautifully moulded, were rather slender than\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nHer face did not at first sight strike you more than her person, as being\r\nbeautiful; for it was singularly still and inexpressive when at\r\nrest—although all the features were fine and classically regular—and was\r\nalmost unnaturally pale and hueless. The mouth only, had any thing of\r\nwarmth, or color, or expression; and what expression there was, was not\r\npleasing, for although soft and winning, it was sensual to the last\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nHer manner, however, contradicted this; for she slided into the circle,\r\nwith downcast eyes, the long dark silky lashes only visible in relief\r\nagainst the marble paleness of her cheek, as if she were ashamed to raise\r\nthem from the ground; her whole air being that of a girl oppressed with\r\noverwhelming bashfulness, to an extent almost painful.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what is this, Aurelia,\" exclaimed Catiline, as if he were angry,\r\nalthough in truth the whole thing was carefully preconcerted. \"Wherefore\r\nis Lucia thus strangely clad? Is it, I pray you, in scorn of our noble\r\nguests, that she wears only this plain morning stola?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon her, I beseech you, good my Sergius,\" answered his wife, with a\r\npainfully simulated smile; \"you know how over-timid she is and bashful;\r\nshe had determined not to appear at dinner, had I not laid my commands on\r\nher. Her very hair, you see, is not braided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! this is ill done, my girl Lucia,\" answered Catiline. \"What will my\r\nyoung friend, Arvina, think of you, who comes hither to-day, for the first\r\ntime? For Curius and our lovely Fulvia, I care not so much, seeing they\r\nknow your whims; but I am vexed, indeed, that Paullus should behold you\r\nthus in disarray, with your hair thus knotted like a slave girl’s, on your\r\nneck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a Dryad’s, rather, or shy Oread’s of Diana’s train—beautiful hair!\"\r\nreplied the youth, whose attention had been called to the girl by this\r\nconversation; and who, having thought her at first unattractive rather\r\nthan otherwise, had now discovered the rare beauties of her lythe and\r\nslender figure, and detected, as he thought, a world of passion in her\r\nserpent-like and sinuous motions.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to meet his slowly, as he spoke; gazed into them for\r\none moment, and then, as if ashamed of what she had done, dropped them\r\nagain instantly; while a bright crimson flush shot like a stream of lava\r\nover her pallid face, and neck, and arms; yes, her arms blushed, and her\r\nhands to the finger ends! It was but one moment, that those large lustrous\r\norbs looked full into his, swimming in liquid Oriental languor, yet\r\nflashing out beams of consuming fire.\r\n\r\nYet Paullus Arvina felt the glance, like an electrical influence, through\r\nevery nerve and artery of his body, and trembled at its power.\r\n\r\nIt was a minute before he could collect himself enough to speak to her,\r\nfor all the rest had moved away a little, and left them standing together;\r\nand when he did so, his voice faltered, and his manner was so much\r\nagitated, that she must have been blind, indeed, and stupid, not to\r\nperceive it.\r\n\r\nAnd Lucia was not blind nor stupid. No! by the God of Love! an universe of\r\nwild imaginative intellect, an ocean of strange whirling thoughts, an Etna\r\nof fierce and fiery passions, lay buried beneath that calm, bashful,\r\nalmost awkward manner. Many bad thoughts were there, many unmaidenly\r\nimaginings, many ungoverned and most evil passions; but there was also\r\nmuch that was partly good; much that might have been all good, and high\r\nand noble, had it been properly directed; but alas! as much pains had been\r\ntaken to corrupt and deprave that youthful understanding, and to inflame\r\nthose nascent passions, as are devoted by good parents to developing the\r\nformer, and repressing the growth of the latter.\r\n\r\nAs it was, self indulged, and indulged by others, she was a creature of\r\nimpulse entirely, ill regulated and ungovernable.\r\n\r\nIntended from the first to be a tool in his own hands, whenever he might\r\nthink fit to use her, she had in no case hitherto run counter to the views\r\nof Catiline; because, so long as his schemes were agreeable to her\r\ninclinations, and favorable to her pleasures, she was quite willing to be\r\nhis tool; though by no means unconscious of the fact that he meant her to\r\nbe such.\r\n\r\nWhat might be the result should his wishes cross her own, the arch\r\nconspirator had never given himself the pains to enquire; for, like the\r\ngreater part of voluptuaries, regarding women as mere animals, vastly\r\ninferior in mind and intellect to men, he had entirely overlooked her\r\nmental qualifications, and fancied her a being of as small moral capacity,\r\nas he knew her to be of strong physical organization.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken; as wise men often are, and deeply, perhaps fatally.\r\n\r\nThere was not probably a girl in all Italy, in all the world, who would so\r\nimplicitly have followed his directions, as long as to do so gratified her\r\npassions, and clashed not with her indomitable will, to the sacrifice of\r\nall principle, and with the most total disregard of right or wrong, as\r\nLucia Orestilla; but certainly there was not one, who would have resisted\r\ncommands, threats, violence, more pertinaciously or dauntlessly, than the\r\nsame Lucia, should her will and his councils ever be set at twain.\r\n\r\nWhile Paullus was yet conversing in an under tone with this strange girl,\r\nand becoming every moment more and more fascinated by the whole tone of\r\nher remarks, which were free, and even bold, as contrasted with the\r\nbashful air and timid glances which accompanied them, the curtains of the\r\nTablinum were drawn apart, and a soft symphony of flutes stealing in from\r\nthe atrium, announced that the dinner was prepared.\r\n\r\n\"My Curius,\" exclaimed Catiline, \"I must entreat you to take charge of\r\nFulvia; I had proposed myself that pleasure, intending that you should\r\nescort Sempronia, and Decius my own Orestilla; but, as it is, we will each\r\nabide by his own lady; and Paullus here will pardon the youth and rawness\r\nof my Lucia.\"\r\n\r\n\"By heaven! I would wish nothing better,\" said Curius, taking Fulvia by\r\nthe hand, and leading her forward. \"Should you, Arvina?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I, indeed,\" replied Paullus, \"if Lucia be content.\" And he looked to\r\ncatch her eye, as he took her soft hand in his own, but her face remained\r\ncold and pale as marble, and her eye downcast.\r\n\r\nAs they passed out, however, into the fauces, or passage leading to the\r\ndining-room, Catiline added,\r\n\r\n\"As we are all, I may say, one family and party, I have desired the slaves\r\nto spread couches only; the ladies will recline with us, instead of\r\nsitting at the board.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, did Paullus fancy it? or did that beautiful pale girl\r\nindeed press his fingers in her own? he could not be mistaken; and yet\r\nthere was the downcast eye, the immoveable cheek, and the unsmiling aspect\r\nof the rosy mouth. But he returned the pressure, and that so\r\nsignificantly, that she at least could not be mistaken; nor was she, for\r\nher eye again met his, with that deep amorous languid glance; was\r\nbashfully withdrawn; and then met his again, glancing askance through the\r\ndark fringed lids, and a quick flashing smile, and a burning blush\r\nfollowed; and in a second’s space she was again as cold, as impassive as a\r\nmarble statue.\r\n\r\nThey reached the triclinium, a beautiful oblong apartment, gorgeously\r\npainted with arabesques of gold and scarlet upon a deep azure ground work.\r\nA circular table, covered with a white cloth, bordered with a deep edge of\r\npurple and deeper fringe of gold, stood in the centre, and around it three\r\ncouches, nearly of the same height with the board, each the segment of a\r\ncircle, the three forming a horse-shoe.\r\n\r\nThe couches were of the finest rosewood, inlaid with tortoiseshell and\r\nivory and brass, strewed with the richest tapestries, and piled with\r\ncushions glowing with splendid needlework. And over all, upheld by richly\r\nmoulded shafts of Corinthian bronze, was a canopy of Tyrian purple,\r\ntasselled and fringed with gold.\r\n\r\nThe method of reclining at the table was, that the guests should place\r\nthemselves on the left side, propped partly by the left elbow and partly\r\nby a pile of cushions; each couch being made to contain in general three\r\npersons, the head of the second coming immediately below the right arm of\r\nthe first, and the third in like manner; the body of each being placed\r\ntransversely, so as to allow space for the limbs of the next below in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nThe middle place on each couch was esteemed the most honorable; and the\r\nmiddle couch of the three was that assigned to guests of the highest rank,\r\nthe master of the feast, for the most, occupying the central position on\r\nthe third or left hand sofa. The slaves stood round the outer circuit of\r\nthe whole, with the cupbearers; but the carver, and steward, if he might\r\nso be termed, occupied that side of the table which was left open to their\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, there being but six guests in all, each gentleman\r\nassisted the lady under his charge to recline, with her head comfortably\r\nelevated, near the centre of the couch; and then took his station behind\r\nher, so that, if she leaned back, her head would rest on his bosom, while\r\nhe was enabled himself to reach the table, and help himself or his fair\r\npartner, as need might be, to the delicacies offered in succession.\r\n\r\nCurius and Fulvia, he as of senatorial rank, and she as a noble matron,\r\noccupied the highest places; Paullus and Lucia reclined on the right hand\r\ncouch, and Catiline with Orestilla in his bosom, as the phrase ran, on the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they all placed, and the due libation made of wine, with an\r\noffering of salt, to the domestic Gods—a silver group of statues occupying\r\nthe centre of the board, where we should now place the _plateau_ and\r\n_epergne_, than a louder burst of music ushered in three beautiful female\r\nslaves, in succinct tunics, like that seen in the sculptures of Diana,\r\nwith half the bosom bare, dancing and singing, and carrying garlands in\r\ntheir hands of roses and myrtle, woven with strips of the philyra, or\r\ninner bark of the linden tree, which was believed to be a specific against\r\nintoxication. Circling around the board, in time to the soft music, they\r\ncrowned each of the guests, and sprinkled with rich perfumes the garments\r\nand the hair of each; and then with more animated and eccentric gestures,\r\nas the note of the flute waxed shriller and more piercing, they bounded\r\nfrom the banquet hall, and were succeeded by six boys with silver basins,\r\nfull of tepid water perfumed with costly essences, and soft embroidered\r\nnapkins, which they handed to every banqueter to wash the hands before\r\neating.\r\n\r\nThis done, the music died away into a low faint close, and was silent; and\r\nin the hush that followed, an aged slave bore round a mighty flask of\r\nChian wine, diluted with snow water, and replenished the goblets of\r\nstained glass, which stood beside each guest; while another dispensed\r\nbread from a lordly basket of wrought gilded scroll work.\r\n\r\nAnd now the feast commenced, in earnest; as the first course, consisting\r\nof fresh eggs boiled hard, with lettuce, radishes, endive and rockets,\r\nolives of Venafrum, anchovies and sardines, and the choicest luxury of the\r\nday—hot sausages served upon gridirons of silver, with the rich gravy\r\ndripping through the bars upon a sauce of Syrian prunes and pomegranate\r\nberries—was placed upon the board.\r\n\r\nFor a time there was little conversation beyond the ordinary courtesies of\r\nthe table, and such trifling jests as were suggested by occurrences of the\r\nmoment. Yet still in the few words that passed from time to time, Paullus\r\ncontinued often to convey his sentiments to Lucia in words of double\r\nmeaning; keenly marked, it is true, but seemingly unobserved by the wily\r\nplotter opposite; and more than once in handing her the goblet, or loading\r\nher plate with dainties, he took an opportunity again and again of\r\npressing her not unwilling hand. And still at every pressure he caught\r\nthat soft momentary glance, was it of love and passion, or of mere\r\ncoquetry and girlish wantonness, succeeded by the fleeting blush pervading\r\nface, neck, arms, and bosom.\r\n\r\nNever had Paullus been so wildly fascinated; his heart throbbed and\r\nbounded as if it would have burst his breast; his head swam with a sort of\r\npleasurable dizziness; his eyes were dim and suffused; and he scarce knew\r\nthat he was talking, though he was indeed the life of the whole company,\r\nvoluble, witty, versatile, and at times eloquent, so far as the topics of\r\nthe day gave room for eloquence.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to the melody of Lydian lutes, two slaves introduced a huge\r\nsilver dish, loaded by the vast brawn of the Umbrian boar, garnished with\r\nleaves of chervil, and floating in a rich sauce of anchovies, the dregs of\r\nCoan wine, white pepper, vinegar, and olives. The carver brandished his\r\nknife in graceful and fantastic gestures, proud of his honorable task; and\r\nas he plunged it into the savory meat, and the delicious savor rushed up\r\nto his nostrils, he laid down the blade, spread out his hands in an\r\necstacy, and cried aloud, \"ye Gods, how glorious!\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent well, my Glycon,\" cried Curius, delighted with the expressive\r\npantomine of the well skilled Greek; \"smells it so savory?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have carved many a boar from Lucania and from Umbria also; to say\r\nnothing of those from the Laurentian marshes, which are bad, seeing that\r\nthey are fed on reeds only and marsh grass; most noble Curius; and never\r\nput I knife into such an one as this. There are two inches on it of pure\r\nfat, softer than marrow. He was fed upon holm acorns, I’ll be sworn, and\r\nsweet chesnuts, and caught in a mild south wind!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fewer words, you scoundrel,\" exclaimed Catiline, laughing at the fellow’s\r\nvolubility, \"and quicker carving, if you wish not to visit the pistrinum.\r\nYou have set Curius’ mouth watering, so that he will be sped with longing,\r\nbefore you have helped Fulvia and your mistress. Fill up, you knaves, fill\r\nup; nay! not the Chian now; the Falernian from the Faustian hills, or the\r\nCæcuban? Which shall it be, my Curius?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Cæcuban, by all the Gods! I hold it the best vintage ever, and yours\r\nis curious. Besides, the Falernian is too dry to drink before the meat.\r\nAfterward, if, as Glycon says, the boar hath a flavor of the south, it\r\nwill be excellent, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are as you as constant, Paullus, in your love for the boar, as these\r\nother epicures?\" cried Fulvia, who, despite the depreciating tone in which\r\nshe spoke, had sent her own plate for a second slice.\r\n\r\n\"No! by the Gods! Fulvia,\" he replied, \"I am but a sorry epicure, and I\r\nlove the boar better in his reedy fen, or his wild thicket on the Umbrian\r\nhills, with his eye glaring red in rage, and his tusks white with foam,\r\nthan girt with condiments and spices upon a golden dish.\"\r\n\r\n\"A strange taste,\" said Curius, \"I had for my part rather meet ten on the\r\ndining table, than one in the oak woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Commend me to the boar upon the table likewise,\" said Catiline; \"still,\r\nwith my friend Arvina at my side, and a good boarspear in my hand, I would\r\nlike well to bide the charge of a tusker! It is rare sport, by Hercules!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful beings you men are,\" said Fulvia, mincing her words affectedly,\r\n\"ever in search of danger; ever on the alert to kill; to shed blood, even\r\nif it be your own! by Juno, I cannot comprehend it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can, I can,\" cried Lucia, raising her voice for the first time, so that\r\nit could be heard by any others than her nearest neighbor; \"right well can\r\nI comprehend it; were I a man myself, I feel that I should pant for the\r\nbattle. The triumph would be more than rapture; and strife, for its own\r\nsake, maddening bliss! Heavens! to see the gladiators wheel and charge; to\r\nsee their swords flash in the sun; and the red blood gush out unheeded;\r\nand the grim faces flushed and furious; and the eyes greedily devouring\r\nthe wounds of the foeman, but all unconscious of their own; and the play\r\nof the muscular strong limbs; and the terrible death grapple! And then the\r\ndull hissing sound of the death stroke; and the voiceless parting of the\r\nbold spirit! Ye Gods! ye Gods! it is a joy, to live, and almost to die\r\nfor!\"\r\n\r\nPaullus Arvina looked at her in speechless wonder. The eyes so wavering\r\nand downcast were now fixed, and steady, and burning with a passionate\r\nclear light; there was a fiery flush on her cheek, not brief and\r\nevanescent; her ripe red mouth was half open, shewing the snow white teeth\r\nbiting the lower lip in the excitement of her feelings. Her whole form\r\nseemed to be dilated and more majestic than its wont.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! my girl; well said, my quiet Lucia!\" exclaimed Catiline. \"I knew\r\nnot that she had so much of mettle in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have thought, then, that I belied my race,\" replied the girl,\r\nunblushingly; \"for it is whispered that you are my father, and I think\r\n_you_ have looked on blood, and shed it before now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Boar’s blood, ha! Lucia; but you are blunt and brave to-night. Is it that\r\nPaullus has inspired you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I know not,\" she replied, half apathetically; \"but I do know, that\r\nif I ever love, it shall be a hero; a man that would rather lie in wait\r\nuntil dawn to receive the fierce boar rushing from the brake upon his\r\nspear, than until midnight to enfold a silly girl in his embrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then will you never love me, Lucia,\" answered Curius.\r\n\r\n\"Never, indeed!\" said she; \"it must be a man whom I will love; and there\r\nis nothing manly about thee, save thy vices!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is for those that most people love me,\" replied Curius, nothing\r\ndisconcerted. \"Now Cato has nothing of the man about him but the virtues;\r\nand I should like to know who ever thought of loving Cato.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of any body loving Cato,\" said Fulvia, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"But I have,\" answered the girl, almost fiercely; \"none of _you_ love him;\r\nnor do I love him; because he is too high and noble, to be dishonored by\r\nthe love of such as I am; but all the good, and great, and generous, do\r\nlove him, and will love his memory for countless ages! I would to God, I\r\ncould love him!\"\r\n\r\n\"What fury has possessed her?\" whispered Catiline to Orestilla; \"what ails\r\nher to talk thus? first to proclaim herself my daughter, and now to praise\r\nCato?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not ask me!\" replied Aurelia in the same tone; \"she was a strange girl\r\never; and I cannot say, if she likes this task that you have put upon\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"More wine, ho! bring more wine! Drink we each man to his mistress, each\r\nlady to her lover in secrecy and silence!\" cried the master of the revel.\r\n\"Fill up! fill up! let it be pure, and sparkling to the brim.\"\r\n\r\nBut Fulvia, irritated a little by what had passed, would not be silent;\r\nalthough she saw that Catiline was annoyed at the character the\r\nconversation had assumed, and ere the slave had filled up the beakers she\r\naddressed Lucia—\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore, dearest, would you love Cato? I could as soon love the\r\nstatue of Accius Nævius, with his long beard, on the steps of the\r\nComitium; he were scarce colder, or less comely than your Cato.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because to love virtue is still something, if we be vicious even; and, if\r\nI am not virtuous myself, at least I have not lost the sense that it were\r\ngood to be so!\"\r\n\r\n\"I never knew that you were not virtuous, my Lucia,\" interposed her\r\nmother; \"affectionate and pious you have ever been.\"\r\n\r\n\"And obedient!\" added Catiline, with strong emphasis. \"Your mother, my\r\nLucia, and myself, return thanks to the Gods daily for giving us so good a\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" replied the girl, scornfully; \"the Gods must have merry times,\r\nthen, for that must needs make them laugh! But good or bad, I respect the\r\ngreat; and, if I ever love, it will be, as I said, a great and a good\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear you will never love me, Lucia,\" whispered Paullus in her ear,\r\nunheard amid the clash of knives and flagons, and the pealing of a fresh\r\nstrain of music, which ushered in the king of fish, the grand conger,\r\ngarnished with prawns and soused in pungent sauce.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore not?\" she replied, meeting his eye with a furtive sidelong\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"Because I, for one, had rather watch till midnight fifty times, in the\r\nhope only of clasping Lucia, once, in my embrace; than once until dawn, to\r\nkill fifty boars of Umbria.\"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer; but looked up into his face as if to see whether he\r\nwas in earnest, with an affectionate and pleading glance; and then pressed\r\nher unsandalled foot against his. A moment or two afterward, he perceived\r\nthe embroidered table cover had been drawn up, with the intent of\r\nprotecting her dress from the sauces of the fish which she was eating, in\r\nsuch a manner as to conceal the greater part of her person.\r\n\r\nObserving this, and excited beyond all restraint of ordinary prudence, by\r\nthe consciousness of her manner, he profited by the chance to steal his\r\narm about her waist; and to his surprise, almost as much as his delight,\r\nhe felt his hand clasped instantly in hers, and pressed upon her throbbing\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe blood gushed like molten fire through his veins. The fascinations of\r\nthe siren had prevailed. The voice of the charmer had been heard, charming\r\nhim but too wisely. And for the moment, fool that he was, he fancied he\r\nloved Lucia, and his own pure and innocent and lovely Julia was forgotten!\r\nForgotten, and for whom!\r\n\r\nCatiline had not lost one word, one movement of the young couple; and he\r\nperceived, that, although there was clearly something at work in the\r\ngirl’s bosom which he did not comprehend, she had at least obeyed his\r\ncommands in captivating Paullus; and he now doubted not but she would\r\npersevere, from vanity or passion, and bind him down a fettered captive to\r\nher will.\r\n\r\nDetermined to lose nothing by want of exertion, the traitor circulated now\r\nthe fiery goblet as fast as possible, till every brain was heated more or\r\nless, and every cheek flushed, even of the women, by the inspiring\r\ninfluence of the wine cup.\r\n\r\nAll dainties that were known in those days ministered to his feast;\r\noysters from Baiæ; pheasants—a rarity but lately introduced, since\r\nPompey’s conquests in the east—had been brought all the way from Phasis\r\nupon the southern shores of the Black Sea; and woodcock from the valleys\r\nof Ionia, and the watery plains of Troas, to load the tables of the\r\nluxurious masters of the world. Livers of geese, forced to an unnatural\r\nsize by cramming the unhappy bird with figs; and turbot fricasseed in\r\ncream, and peacocks stuffed with truffles, were on the board of Catiline\r\nthat day, as on the boards of many another noble Roman; and the wines by\r\nwhich these rare dainties were diluted, differed but little, as wisest\r\ncritics say, from the madeiras and the sherries of the nineteenth century.\r\nFor so true is it, that under the sun there is nothing new, that in the\r\n_foix gras_ of Strasburg, in the _turbot à la crême_, and in the _dindons\r\naux truffes_ of the French metropolis, the gastronomes of modern days have\r\nonly reproduced the dishes, whereon Lucullus and Hortensius feasted before\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe day passed pleasantly to all, but to Paullus Arvina it flew like a\r\ndream, like a delirious trance, from which, could he have consulted his\r\nown will, he would never have awakened.\r\n\r\nWith the dessert, and the wine cup, the myrtle branch and the lute went\r\nround, and songs were warbled by sweet voices, full of seductive thoughts\r\nand words of passion. At length the lamps were lighted, and the women\r\narose to quit the hall, leaving the ruder sex to prolong the revel; but as\r\nLucia rose, she again pressed the fingers of Arvina, and whispered a\r\nrequest that he would see her once more ere he left the house.\r\n\r\nHe promised; but as he did so, his heart sank within him; for dearly as he\r\nwished it, he believed he had promised that which would prove impossible.\r\n\r\nBut in a little while, chance, as he thought it, favored him; for seeing\r\nthat he refused the wine cup, Catiline, after rallying him some time, good\r\nhumoredly said with a laugh, \"Come, my Arvina, we must not be too hard on\r\nyou. You have but a young head, though a stout one. Curius and I are old\r\nveterans of the camp, old revellers, and love the wine cup better than the\r\nbright eyes of beauty, or the minstrel’s lute. Thou, I will swear it,\r\nwouldst rather now be listening to Lucia’s lyre, and may be fingering it\r\nthyself, than drinking with us roisterers! Come, never blush, boy, we were\r\nall young once! Confess, if I am right! The women you will find, if you\r\nchoose to seek them, in the third chamber on the left, beyond the inner\r\nperistyle. We all love freedom here; nor are we rigid censors. Curius and\r\nI will drain a flagon or two more, and then join you.\"\r\n\r\nMuttering something not very comprehensible about his exertions in the\r\nmorning, and his inability to drink any more, Paullus arose, delighted to\r\neffect his escape on terms so easy, and left the triclinium immediately in\r\nquest of his mistress.\r\n\r\nAs he went out, Catiline burst into one of his sneering laughs, and\r\nexclaimed, \"He is in; by Pan, the hunter’s God! he is in the death-toil\r\nalready! May I perish ill, if he escape it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the name of all the Gods, do you take so much pains with him,\"\r\nsaid Curius; \"he is a stout fellow, and I dare say a brave one; and will\r\nmake a good legionary, or an officer perhaps; but he is raw, and a fool to\r\nboot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Raw, but no fool! I can assure you,\" answered Catiline; \"no more a fool\r\nthan I am. And we must have him, he is necessary!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will be necessary soon to that girl of yours; she has gone mad, I\r\nthink, for love of him. I never did believe in philtres; but this is well\r\nnigh enough to make one do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" answered Catiline; \"it is thou that art raw now, and a fool,\r\nCurius. She is no more in love with him than thou art; it was all\r\nacting—right good acting: for it did once well nigh deceive me who devised\r\nit; but still, only acting. I ordered her to win him at all hazards.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all hazards?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! at _all_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would give her the like orders touching me, if she obey so\r\nreadily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would, if it were necessary; which it is not. First, because I have you\r\nas firmly mine, as need be; and secondly, because Fulvia would have her\r\nheart’s blood ere two days had gone, and that would ill suit me; for the\r\nsly jade is useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care she prove not too sly for you, Sergius. She may obey your\r\norders in this thing; but she does so right willingly. She loves the boy,\r\nI tell you, as madly as Venus loved Adonis, or Phædra Hyppolitus; she\r\nwould pursue him if he fled from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She loves him no more than she loves the musty statue of my stout\r\ngrandsire, Sergius Silo.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see one day. Meanwhile, look that she fool you not.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking, Paullus had reached the entrance of the chamber\r\nindicated; and, opening the door, had entered, expecting to find the three\r\nwomen assembled at some feminine sport or occupation. But fortune again\r\nfavored him—opportune fortune!\r\n\r\nFor Lucia was alone, expecting him, prepared for his entrance at any\r\nmoment; yet, when he came, how unprepared, how shocked, how terrified!\r\n\r\nFor she had unclasped her stola upon both her shoulders, and suffered it\r\nto fall down to her girdle which kept it in its place about her hips. But\r\nabove those she was dressed only in a tunic of that loose fabric, a sort\r\nof silken gauze, which was called woven air, and was beginning to be worn\r\nvery much by women of licentious character; this dress—if that indeed\r\ncould be called a dress, which displayed all the outlines of the shape,\r\nall the hues of the glowing skin every minute blue vein that meandered\r\nover the lovely bosom—was wrought in alternate stripes of white and\r\nsilver; and nothing can be imagined more beautiful than the effect of its\r\nsemi-transparent veil concealing just enough to leave some scope for the\r\nimagination, displaying more than enough for the most prodigal of beauty.\r\n\r\nShe was employed in dividing her long jet-black hair with a comb of\r\nmother-of-pearl as he entered; but she dropped both the hair and comb, and\r\nstarted to her feet with a simulated scream, covering her beautiful bust\r\nwith her two hands, as if she had been taken absolutely by surprise.\r\n\r\nBut Paullus had been drinking freely, and Paullus saw, moreover, that she\r\nwas not offended; and, if surprised, surprised not unpleasantly by his\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nHe sprang forward, caught her in his arms, and clasping her to his bosom\r\nalmost smothered her with kisses. But shame on her, fast and furiously as\r\nhe kissed, she kissed as closely back.\r\n\r\n\"Lucia, sweet Lucia, do you then love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than my life—more than my country—more than the Gods! my brave, my\r\nnoble Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you then be mine—all mine, my Lucia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours, Paul?\" she faltered, panting as if with agitation upon his bosom;\r\n\"am I not yours already? but no, no, no!\" she exclaimed, tearing herself\r\nfrom his embrace. \"No no! I had forgotten. My father! no; I cannot, my\r\nfather!\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, Lucia? your father? What of your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are his enemy. You have discovered, will betray him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, by the great Gods! you are mad, Lucia. I have discovered nothing; nor\r\nif I knew him to be the slayer of my father, would I betray him! never,\r\nnever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you swear _that_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, whatever you may learn, to betray him to any living man: never to\r\ncarry arms, or give evidence against him; but faithfully and stedfastly to\r\nfollow him through virtue and through vice, in life and unto death; to\r\nlive for him, and die with him, unless I release you of your oath and\r\nrestore you to freedom, which I will never do!\"\r\n\r\n\"By all the powers of light and darkness! by Jupiter Omnipotent, and Pluto\r\nthe Avenger, I swear, Lucia! May I and all my house, and all whom I love\r\nor cherish, wretchedly perish if I fail you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am yours,\" she sighed; \"all, and for ever!\" and sank into his\r\narms, half fainting with the violence of that prolonged excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Into what dangers\r\n            Would you lead me, Cassius?\r\n                    JULIUS CÆSAR.\r\n\r\nThe evening had worn on to a late hour, and darkness had already fallen\r\nover the earth, when Paullus issued stealthily, like a guilty thing, from\r\nLucia’s chamber. No step or sound had come near the door, no voice had\r\ncalled on either, though they had lingered there for hours in endearments,\r\nwhich, as he judged the spirit of his host, would have cost him his life,\r\nif suspected; and though he never dreamed of connivance, he did think it\r\nstrange that a man so wary and suspicious as Catiline was held to be,\r\nshould have so fallen from his wonted prudence, as to betray his adopted\r\ndaughter’s honor by granting this most fatal opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe met no member of the family in the dim-lighted peristyle; the passages\r\nwere silent and deserted; no gay domestic circle was collected in the\r\ntablinum, no slaves were waiting in the atrium; and, as he stole forth\r\ncautiously with guarded footsteps, Arvina almost fancied that he had been\r\nforgotten; and that the master of the house believed him to have retired\r\nwhen he left the dining hall.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before he was undeceived; for as he entered the\r\nvestibule, and was about to lay his hand on the lock of the outer door, a\r\ntall dark figure, which he recognized instantly to be that of his host,\r\nstepped forward from a side-passage, and stretched out his arm in silence,\r\nforbidding him, by that imperious gesture, to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! you have tarried long,\" he said in a deep guarded whisper, \"our Lucia\r\ntruly is a most soft and fascinating creature; you found her so, is it not\r\ntrue, my Paullus?\"\r\n\r\nThere was something singular in the manner in which these words were\r\nuttered, half mocking, and half serious; something between a taunting and\r\ntriumphant assertion of a fact, and a bitter question; but nothing that\r\nbetokened anger or hostility, or offended pride in the speaker.\r\n\r\nStill Paullus was so much taken by surprise, and so doubtful of his\r\nentertainer’s meaning, and the extent of his knowledge, that he remained\r\nspeechless in agitated and embarrassed silence.\r\n\r\n\"What, have the girl’s kisses clogged your lips, so that they can give out\r\nno sound? By the gods! they were close enough to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catiline!\" he exclaimed, starting back in astonishment, and half\r\nexpecting to feel a dagger in his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Tush! tush! young man—think you the walls in the house of Catiline have\r\nno ears, nor eyes? Paullus Arvina, I know all!\"\r\n\r\n\"All?\" faltered the youth, now utterly aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, all!\" replied the conspirator, with a harsh triumphant laugh. \"Lucia\r\nhas given herself to you; and you have sold yourself to Catiline! By all\r\nthe fiends of Hades, better it were for you, rash boy, that you had ne’er\r\nbeen born, than now to fail me!\"\r\n\r\nArvina, trembling with the deep consciousness of hospitality betrayed, and\r\nfeeling the first stings of remorse already, stood thunderstricken, and\r\nunable to articulate.\r\n\r\n\"Speak!\" thundered Catiline; \"speak! art thou not mine—mine soul and\r\nbody—sworn to be mine forever?\"\r\n\r\nAlas! the fatal oath, sworn in the heat of passion, flashed on his soul,\r\nand he answered humbly, and in a faint low voice, how different from his\r\nwonted tones of high and manly confidence—\r\n\r\n\"I am sworn, Catiline!\"\r\n\r\n\"See then that thou be not forsworn. Little thou dream’st yet, unto what\r\nthou art sworn, or unto whom; but know this, that hell itself, with all\r\nits furies, would fall short of the tortures that await the traitor!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, at least, no traitor!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! traitor! Ha!\" cried Catiline, \"is it an honest deed to creep into the\r\nbosom of a daughter of the house which entertained thee as a friend!—No!\r\nTraitor—ha! ha! ha! thou shalt ere long learn better—ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed with the fearful sneering mirth, which was never excited in\r\nhis breast, but by things perilous and terrible and hateful. In a moment,\r\nhowever, he repressed his merriment, and added—\r\n\r\n\"Give me that poniard thou didst wear this morning. It is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thine!\" cried the unhappy youth, starting back, as if he had received a\r\nblow; \"thine, Catiline!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" he replied, in a hoarse voice, looking into the very eyes of Paul.\r\n\"I am the slayer of the slave, and regret only that I slew him without\r\ntorture. Know you whose slave he was, by any chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was the Consul’s slave,\" answered Arvina, almost mechanically—for he\r\nwas utterly bewildered by all that had passed—\"Medon, my freedman\r\nThrasea’s cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Consul’s, ha!—which Consul’s? speak! fool! speak, ere I tear it from\r\nyour throat; Cicero’s, ha?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cicero’s, Catiline!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a coil; and knows he of this matter? I mean Cicero.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, you told him. Aye! this morning, after I spoke with you.\r\nI comprehend; and you shewed him the poniard. So! so! so! Well, give it to\r\nme; I will tell you what to do, hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it not with me, Sergius,\" he replied, thoroughly daunted and\r\ndismayed.\r\n\r\n\"See that you meet me then, bringing it with you, at Egeria’s cave, as\r\nfools call it, in the valley of Muses, at the fourth hour of night\r\nto-morrow. In the meantime, beware that you tell no man aught of this, nor\r\nthat the instrument was bought of Volero. Ha! dost thou hear me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear, Catiline.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wilt obey?\"\r\n\r\n\"And will obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"So shall it go well with thee, and we shall be fast friends forever. Good\r\nrepose to thee, good my Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lucia?\" he replied, but in a voice of inquiry; for all that he had\r\nheard of the tremendous passions and vindictive fury of the conspirator,\r\nflashed on his mind, and he fancied that he knew not what of vengeance\r\nwould fall on the head of the soft beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Hath played her part rarely!\" answered the monster, as he dismissed him\r\nfrom the door, which he opened with his own hand. \"Be true, and you shall\r\nsee her when you will; betray us, and both you and she shall live in\r\nagonies, that shall make you call upon death fifty times, ere he relieve\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a menacing gesture, he closed and barred the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Played her part rarely!\" The words sank down into his soul with a\r\nchilling weight, that seemed to crush every energy and hope. Played her\r\npart! Then he was a dupe—the very dupe of the fiend’s arch mock, to lip a\r\nwanton, and believe her chaste—the dupe of a designing harlot; the sworn\r\ntool and slave of a murderer—a monster, who had literally sold his own\r\nchild’s honor. For all the world well knew, that, although Lucia passed\r\nfor his adopted daughter only, she was his natural offspring by Aurelia\r\nOrestilla, before their impious marriage.\r\n\r\nWell might he gnash his teeth, and beat his breast, and tear his dark hair\r\nby handfulls from his head; well might he groan and curse.\r\n\r\nBut oh! the inconsistency of man! While he gave vent to all the anguish of\r\nhis rage in curses against her, the soft partner of his guilt, and at the\r\nsame time, its avenger; against the murderer and the traitor, now his\r\ntyrant; he utterly forgot that his own dereliction, from the paths of\r\nrectitude and honor, had led him into the dark toils, in which he now\r\nseemed involved beyond any hope of extrication.\r\n\r\nHe forgot, that to satisfy an insane and unjustifiable love of adventure,\r\nand a false curiosity, he had associated himself with a man whom he\r\nbelieved, if he did not actually know, to be infamous and capable of any\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nHe forgot, that, admitted into that man’s house in friendship, he had\r\nattempted to undermine his daughter’s honor; and had felt no remorse, till\r\nhe learned that his success was owing to connivance—that his own treason\r\nhad been met and repaid by deeper treason.\r\n\r\nHe forgot, that for a wanton’s love, he had betrayed the brightest, and\r\nthe purest being that drew the breath of life, from the far Alps, to the\r\nblue waters of the far Tarentum—that he had broken his soul’s plighted\r\nfaith—that he was himself, first, a liar, perjurer, and villain.\r\n\r\nAlas! it is the inevitable consequence, the first fruit, as it were, of\r\ncrime, that guilt is still prolific; that the commission of the first ill\r\ndeed, leads almost surely to the commission of a second, of a third, until\r\nthe soul is filed and the heart utterly corrupted, and the wretch given\r\nwholly up to the dominion of foul sin, and plunged into thorough\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nArvina had thought lightly, if at all, of his first luxurious sin, but now\r\nto the depth of his secret soul, he felt that he was emmeshed and\r\nentangled in the deepest villainy.\r\n\r\nAll that he ever had yet heard hinted darkly or surmised of Catiline’s\r\ngigantic schemes of wickedness, rushed on him, all at once! He doubted\r\nnothing any longer; it was clear to him as noonday; distinct and definite\r\nas if it had been told to him in so many words; the treason to the state\r\nconcealed by individual murder; and he, a sworn accomplice—nay, a sworn\r\nslave to this murderer and traitor!\r\n\r\nNor was this all; his peril was no less than his guilt; equal on either\r\nside—sure ruin if he should be true to his country, and scarce less sure,\r\nif he should join its parricides. For, though he had not dared say so much\r\nto Catiline, he had already sent the poniard to the house of Cicero, and a\r\nbrief letter indicating all that he had learned from Volero. This he had\r\ndone in the interval between the Campus and his unlucky visit to the house\r\nof Catiline, whom he then little deemed to be the man of whom he was in\r\nquest.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, ere this time, the cutler had been summoned to the consul’s\r\npresence, and the chief magistrate of the Republic had learned that the\r\nmurderer of his slave was the very person, whom he had bound himself by\r\noaths, so strong that he shuddered at the very thought of them, to support\r\nand defend to the utmost.\r\n\r\nWhat was he then to do? how to proceed, since to recede appeared\r\nimpossible?\r\n\r\nHow was he to account to the conspirator for his inability to produce the\r\nponiard at their appointed meeting? how should he escape the pursuit of\r\nhis determined vengeance, if he should shun the meeting?\r\n\r\nAnd then, Lucia! The recollection, guilty and degraded as he knew her to\r\nbe, of her soft blandishments, of her rare beauty, of her wild and\r\ninexplicable manner, adding new charms to that forbidden bliss, yet\r\nthrilled in every sense. And must he give her up? No! madness was in the\r\nvery thought! so strangely had she spread her fascinations round him. And\r\nyet did he love her? no! perish the thought! Love is a high, a holy, a\r\npure feeling—the purest our poor fallen nature is capable of experiencing;\r\nno! this fierce, desperate, guilty passion was no more like true love,\r\nthan the whirlwind that upheaves the tortured billows, and hurls the fated\r\nvessel on the treacherous quicksands, is like to the beneficent and gentle\r\nbreeze that speeds it to the haven of its hopes, in peace and honor.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while consumed in anxious and uneasy thoughts, he\r\ndetermined—as cowards of the mind determine ever—to temporise, to await\r\nevents, to depend upon the tide of circumstance. He would, he thought,\r\nkeep the appointment with his master—for such he felt that Catiline now\r\nwas indeed—however he might strive to conceal the fact; endeavor to learn\r\nwhat were his real objects; and then determine what should be his own\r\ncourse of action. Doubtful, and weak of principle, and most infirm of\r\npurpose, he shrunk alike from breaking the oath he had been entrapped into\r\ntaking, and from committing any crime against his country.\r\n\r\nHis country!—To the Roman, patriotism stood for religion!—Pride, habit,\r\neducation, honor, interest, all were combined in that word, country; and\r\ncould he be untrue to Rome? His better spirit cried out, no! from every\r\nnerve and artery of his body. And then his evil genius whispered Lucia,\r\nand he wavered.\r\n\r\nMeantime, had no thought crossed him of his own pure and noble Julia,\r\ndeserted thus and overlooked for a mere wanton? Many times! many times,\r\nthat day, had his mind reverted to her. When first he went to Cataline’s\r\nhouse, he went with the resolution of leaving it at an early hour, so soon\r\nas the feast should be over, and seeking her, while there should yet be\r\ntime to ramble among the flower-beds on the hill of gardens, or perchance,\r\nto drive out in his chariot, which he had ordered to be held in readiness,\r\ntoward the falls of the Anio, or on the proud Emilian way.\r\n\r\nAfterward, in the whirl of his mad intoxication for the fascinating Lucia,\r\nall memory of his true love was lost, as the chaste moon-light may be\r\ndimmed and drowned for a while by the red glare of the torches, brandished\r\nin some licentious orgy. Nor did he think of her again, till he found\r\nhimself saddened, and self-disgusted, plunged into peril—perhaps into\r\nruin, by his own guilty conduct; and then, when he did think, it was with\r\nremorse, and self-reproach, and consciousness of disloyalty, so bitterly\r\nand keenly painful—yet unaccompanied by that repentance, which steadily\r\nenvisages past wrong, and determines to amend in future—that he shook off\r\nthe recollection, whenever it returned, with wilful stubbornness; and\r\nresolved on forgetting, for the present, the being whom a few short hours\r\nbefore, he would have deemed it impossible that he should ever think of\r\nbut with joy and rapturous anticipation.\r\n\r\nOccupied in these fast succeeding moods and fancies, Paullus had made his\r\nway homeward from the house of Catiline, so far as to the Cerolian place,\r\nat the junction of the Sacred Way and the Carinæ. He paused here a moment;\r\nand grasping his fevered brow with his hand, recalled to mind the strange\r\noccurrences, most unexpected and unfortunate, which had befallen him,\r\nsince he stood there that morning; each singly trivial; each, unconnected\r\nas it seemed with the rest, and of little moment; yet all, when united,\r\nforming a chain of circumstances by which he was now fettered hand and\r\nfoot—his casual interview with Catiline on the hill; his subsequent\r\nencounter of Victor and Aristius Fuscus; the recognition of his dagger by\r\nthe stout cutler Volero; the death of Varus in the hippodrome; his own\r\nvictorious exercises on the plain; the invitation to the feast; the\r\nsumptuous banquet; and last, alas! and most fatal, the too voluptuous and\r\nseductive Lucia.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, the doors of Cicero’s stately mansion were thrown\r\nopen, and a long train came sweeping out in dark garments, with blazing\r\ntorches, and music doleful and piercing. And women chanting the shrill\r\nfunereal strain. And then, upon a bier covered with black, the rude wooden\r\ncoffin, peculiar to the slave, of the murdered Medon! Behind him followed\r\nthe whole household of the Consul; and last, to the extreme astonishment\r\nof Paullus, preceded by his lictors, and leaning on the arm of his most\r\nfaithful freedman, came Cicero himself, doing unusual honor, for some\r\ncause known to himself alone, to the manes of his slaughtered servant.\r\n\r\nAs they passed on toward the Capuan gate of the city, the Consul’s eyes\r\nfell directly on the form of Arvina, where he stood revealed in the full\r\nglare of the torch-light; and as he recognised him, he made a sign that he\r\nshould join him, which, under those peculiar circumstances, he felt that\r\nhe could not refuse to do.\r\n\r\nSadly and silently they swept through the splendid streets, and under the\r\narched gate, and filed along the celebrated Appian way, passing the tomb\r\nof the proud Scipios on the left hand, with its superb sarcophagi—for that\r\ngreat house had never, from time immemorial, been wont to burn their\r\ndead—and on the right, a little farther on, the noble temple and the\r\nsacred slope of Mars, and the old statue of the god which had once sweated\r\nblood, prescient of Thrasymene. On they went, frightening the echoes of\r\nthe quiet night with their wild lamentations and the clapping of their\r\nhands, sending the glare of their funereal torches far and wide through\r\nthe cultured fields and sacred groves and rich gardens, until they reached\r\nat length the pile, hard by the columbarium, or slave-burying-place of\r\nCicero’s household.\r\n\r\nThen, the rites performed duly, the dust thrice sprinkled on the body, and\r\nthe farewell pronounced, the corpse was laid upon the pile, and the tall\r\nspire of blood-red flame went up, wavering and streaming through the\r\nnight, rich with perfumes, and gums, and precious ointment, so noble was\r\nthe liberality of the good Consul, even in the interment of his more\r\nfaithful slaves.\r\n\r\nNo words were uttered to disturb the sound of the ceremony, until the\r\nflames died out, and, the smouldering embers quenched with wine, Thrasea,\r\nas the nearest relative of the deceased, gathered the ashes and inurned\r\nthem, when they were duly labelled and consigned to their niche in the\r\ncolumbarium; and then, the final _Ilicet_ pronounced, the sad solemnity\r\nwas ended.\r\n\r\nThen, though not until then, did Cicero address the young man; but then,\r\nas if to make up for his previous silence, he made him walk by his side\r\nall the way back to the city, conversing with him eagerly about all that\r\nhad passed, thanking him for the note and information he had sent\r\nconcerning Volero, and anticipating the immediate discovery of the\r\nperpetrators of that horrid crime.\r\n\r\n\"I have not had the leisure to summon Volero before me,\" he added. \"I\r\nwished also that you, Arvina, should be present when I examine him. I\r\njudge that it will be best, when we shall have dismissed all these, except\r\nthe lictors, to visit him this very night. He is a thrifty and laborious\r\nartisan, and works until late by lamp light; we will go thither, if you\r\nhave naught to hinder you, at once.\"\r\n\r\nArvina could do no otherwise than assent; but his heart beat violently,\r\nand he could scarcely frame his words, so dreadful was his agitation. Yet,\r\nby dint of immense exertion, he contrived to maintain the outward\r\nappearance of composure, which he was very far from feeling, and even to\r\nkeep up a connected conversation as they walked along. Returning home at a\r\nmuch quicker pace than they had gone out, it was comparatively but a short\r\ntime before they arrived at the house of Cicero, and there dismissed their\r\nfollowers, many of the slaves and freedmen of Arvina having joined the\r\nprocession in honour of their fellow-servant Thrasea.\r\n\r\nThence, reserving two lictors only of the twelve, the consul with his\r\nwonted activity hurried directly forward by the Sacred Way to the arch of\r\nFabius; and then, as the young men had gone in the morning, through the\r\nForum toward the cutler’s shop, taking the shortest way, and evidently\r\nwell acquainted with the spot beforehand.\r\n\r\n\"I caused the funeral to take place this night,\" he said to Arvina,\r\n\"instead of waiting the due term of eight days, on purpose that I might\r\ncreate no suspicion in the minds of the slayers. They never will suspect\r\nhim, we have buried even now, to be the man they slew last night, and will\r\nfancy, it may be, that the body is not discovered even.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be well if it prove so,\" replied Paullus, feeling that he must\r\nsay something, and fearful of committing himself by many words.\r\n\r\n\"It will, and I think probably it may,\" answered Cicero. \"But see, I was\r\nright; there shines the light from Volero’s shop, though all the other\r\nbooths have been closed long ago, and the streets are already silent.\r\nThere are but few men, even in this great city, of whom I know not\r\nsomething, beyond the mere names. Think upon that, young man, and learn to\r\ndo likewise; cultivate memory, above all things, except virtue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought such things too mean to occupy a place, even, in\r\nthe mind of Cicero,\" answered Arvina.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, young man, that pertains to our fellow men, is too mean to\r\noccupy the mind of the noblest. Why should it, since it doth occupy the\r\nmind of the Gods, who are all great and omnipotent?\"\r\n\r\n\"You lean not then to the creed of Epicurus, which teaches——\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, I?\" interrupted Cicero, almost indignantly. \"No! by the immortal\r\nGods! nor I trust, my young friend, do you. Believe me—but ha!\" he added\r\nin a quick and altered tone, \"what have we here? there is some villainy in\r\nthe wind—away! away! there! lictors apprehend that fellow.\"\r\n\r\nFor as they came within about a bow-shot of the booth of Volero, the sound\r\nof a slight scuffle was heard from within, and the light of the lamp\r\nbecame very dim and wavering, as if it had been overset; and in a moment\r\nwent out altogether. But its last glimmering ray shewed a tall sinewy\r\nfigure making out of the door and bounding at a great pace up the street\r\ntoward the Carmental gate.\r\n\r\nArvina caught but a momentary glance of the figure; yet was that glance\r\nenough. He recognized the spare but muscular form, all brawn and bone and\r\nsinew; he recognized the long and pardlike bounds!—It was his tyrant, and,\r\nas he thought, his Fate!\r\n\r\nThe lictors rushed away upon his track, but there seemed little chance\r\nthat, encumbered with their heavy fasces, they would overtake so swift a\r\nrunner, as, by the momentary sight they had of him, the fugitive appeared\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nArvina and the Consul speedily reached the booth.\r\n\r\n\"Volero! Volero!\"\r\n\r\nBut there came forth no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Volero! what ho! Volero!\"\r\n\r\nThey listened eagerly, painfully, with ears sharpened by excitement. There\r\ncame a sound—a plash, as of a heavy drop of water falling on the stone\r\nfloor; another, and another—the trickling of a continuous stream.\r\n\r\nAll was dark as a moonless midnight. Yet Cicero took one step forward, and\r\nlaid his hand upon the counter. It splashed into a pool of some warm\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n\"Now may the Gods avert!\" he cried, \"It is blood! there has been murder\r\nhere! Run, my Arvina, run to Furbo’s cookshop, across the way there,\r\nopposite; they sit up there all night—cry murder, ho! help! murder!\"\r\n\r\nA minute had scarcely passed before the heavy knocking of the young man\r\nhad aroused the house—the neighborhood. And at the cry of murder, many\r\nmen, some who had not retired for the night, and some half dressed as they\r\nhad sprung up from their couches, came rushing with their weapons,\r\nsnatched at random, and with torches in their hands.\r\n\r\nIt was but too true! the laborious artizan was dead; murdered, that\r\ninstant, at his own counter, at his very work. He had not moved or risen\r\nfrom his seat, but had fallen forward with his head upon the board; and\r\nfrom beneath the head was oozing in a continuous stream the dark red\r\nblood, which had overflowed the counter, and trickled down, and made the\r\npaved floor one great pool!\r\n\r\n\"Ye Gods! what blood! what blood!\" exclaimed the first who came in.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Volero! alas!\" cried Furbo, \"it is not an hour since he supped on a\r\npound of sausages at my table, and now, all is over!\"\r\n\r\nThey raised his head. His eyes were wide open; and the whole face bore an\r\nexpression neither of agony or terror, so much as of wild surprise.\r\n\r\nThe throat was cut from ear to ear, dividing the windpipe, the carotid\r\narteries and jugular veins on both sides; and so strong had been the hand\r\nof the assassin, and so keen the weapon, that the neck was severed quite\r\nto the back bone.\r\n\r\nAmong the spectators was a gladiator; he whose especial task it was to cut\r\nthe throats of the conquered victims on the arena; he looked eagerly and\r\ncuriously at the wound for a moment, and then said—\r\n\r\n\"A back stroke from behind—a strong hand, and a broadbacked knife—the man\r\nhas been slain by a gladiator, or one who knows the gladiator’s trick!\"\r\n\r\n\"The man,\" said the Consul calmly, \"has been killed by an acquaintance, a\r\nfriend, or a familiar customer; he had not even risen from his seat to\r\nspeak with him; and see, the burnisher is yet grasped in his hand, with\r\nwhich he was at work. Ha!\" he exclaimed, as his lictors entered, panting\r\nand tired by their fruitless chase, \"could you not overtake him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We never saw him any more, my consul,\" replied both men in one breath.\r\n\r\n\"Let his head down, my friend,\" said Cicero, turning, much disappointed as\r\nit seemed, to Furbo, \"let it lie, as it was when we found it; clear the\r\nshop, lictors; take the names of the witnesses; one of you keep watch at\r\nthe door, until you are relieved; lock it and give the key to the prætor,\r\nwhen he shall arrive; the other, go straightway, and summon Cornelius\r\nLentulus; he is the prætor for this ward. Go to your homes, my friends,\r\nand make no tumult in the streets, I pray you. This shall be looked to and\r\navenged; your Consul watches over you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Live! live the Consul! the good Consul, the man of the people!\" shouted\r\nthe crowd, as they dispersed quietly to their homes.\r\n\r\n\"Arvina, come with me. To whom told you, that you had found, and Volero\r\nsold, this dagger?\" he asked very sternly.\r\n\r\n\"To no one, Cicero. Marcus Aurelius Victor, and Aristius Fuscus were with\r\nme, when he recognized it for his work?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one, save our slaves, and they,\" he added in a breath, \"could not have\r\nheard what passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hath no one else seen it?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I was stripping for the contests on the Campus, Catiline saw it in my\r\ngirdle, and admired its fabric.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catiline!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! Consul?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you told _him_ that Volero had made it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Consul, no!\" But, with the word, he turned as white as marble. Had it\r\nbeen daylight, his face had betrayed him; as it was, Cicero observed that\r\nhis voice trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Catiline is the man!\" he said solemnly, \"the man who slew Medon\r\nyesternight, who has slain Volero now. Catiline is the man; but this\r\ncraves wary walking. Young man, young man, beware! methinks you are on the\r\nverge of great danger. Get thee home to thy bed; and again I say, Beware!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Dear, my Lord,\r\n                Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.\r\n                    JULIUS CÆSAR.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose clear and bright on the following morning; the air was fresh\r\nand exhilarating, and full of mirthful inspiration. But Paullus Arvina\r\nrose unrefreshed and languid, with his mind ill at ease; for the reaction\r\nwhich succeeds ever to the reign of any vehement excitement, had fallen on\r\nhim with its depressing weight; and not that only, but keen remorse for\r\nthe past, and, if possible, anxiety yet keener for the future.\r\n\r\nDisastrous dreams had beset his sleeping hours; and, at his waking, they\r\nand the true occurrences of the past day, seemed all blended and confused\r\ninto one horrible and hideous vision.\r\n\r\nNow he envisaged the whole dark reality of his past conduct, of his\r\npresent situation. Lucia, the charming siren of the previous evening,\r\nappeared in her real colors, as the immodest, passionate wanton; Catiline\r\nas the monster that indeed he was!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, alas! alas! as the clear perception of the truth dawned on him,\r\nit was but coupled with a despairing sense, that to these he was linked\r\ninevitably and forever.\r\n\r\nThe oath! the awful oath which he had sworn in the fierce whirl of\r\npassion, registered by the arch-traitor—the oath involving, not alone, his\r\nown temporal and eternal welfare, but that of all whom he loved or\r\ncherished; his own pure, beautiful, inimitable Julia, to whom his heart\r\nnow reverted with a far deeper and more earnest tenderness, after its\r\nbrief inconstancy; as he compared her strong, yet maidenly and gentle\r\nlove, with the wild and ungovernable passions of the wanton, for whom he\r\nhad once sacrificed her.\r\n\r\nPaullus Arvina was not naturally, not radically evil. Far from it, his\r\nimpulses were naturally virtuous and correct, his calm sober thoughts\r\nalways honorable and upright; but his passions were violent and\r\nunregulated; his principles of conduct not definitively formed; and his\r\nmind wavering, unsettled, and unsteady.\r\n\r\nHis passions on the previous day had betrayed him fatally, through the\r\ndark machinations of the conspirator, and the strange fascinations of his\r\nlovely daughter, into the perpetration of a great crime. He had bound\r\nhimself, by an oath too dreadful to be thought of without shuddering, to\r\nthe commission of yet darker crimes in future.\r\n\r\nAnd now the mists of passion had ceased to bedim his mental vision, his\r\neyes were opened, that he saw and repented most sincerely the past guilt.\r\nHow was he to avoid the future?\r\n\r\nTo no man in these days, could there be a doubt even for a moment—however\r\ngreat the sin of swearing such an oath! No one in these days, knowing and\r\nrepenting of the crime, would hesitate a moment, or fancy himself bound,\r\nbecause he had committed one vile sin in pledging himself thus to guilt,\r\nto rush on deeper yet into the perpetration of wickedness.\r\n\r\nThe sin were in the swearing, not in the breaking of an oath so vile and\r\nshameful.\r\n\r\nBut those were days of dark heathenish superstition, and it was far beyond\r\nthe reach of any intellect perhaps of that day to arrive at a conclusion,\r\nsimple as that to which any mind would now leap, as it were instinctively.\r\n\r\nIn those days, an omitted rite, an error in the ceremonial tribute paid to\r\nthe marble idol, was held a deeper sin than adultery, incest, or blood\r\nshedding. And the bare thought of the vengeance due for a broken oath\r\nwould often times keep sleepless, with mere dread, the eyes of men who\r\ncould have slumbered calmly on the commission of the deadliest crimes.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the state of Arvina’s mind on that morning—grieving with\r\ndeep remorse for the faults of which he confessed himself guilty;\r\ntrembling at the idea of rushing into yet more desperate guilt; and at the\r\nsame time feeling bound to do so, in despite of his better thoughts, by\r\nthe fatal oath which bound him to the arch traitor.\r\n\r\nWhile he was sitting in his lonely chamber, with his untasted meal of ripe\r\nfigs, and delicate white bread, and milk and honeycomb before him,\r\ndevouring his own heart in his fiery anguish, and striving with all his\r\nenergies of intellect to devise some scheme by which he might escape the\r\nperils that seemed to hem him round on every side, his faithful freedman\r\nentered, bearing a little billet, on which his eye had scarcely fallen\r\nbefore he recognized the shapely characters of Julia’s well-known writing.\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal which connected the flaxen band, and with a trembling\r\neye, and a soul that feared it knew not what, from the very consciousness\r\nof guilt, he read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A day has passed, my Paullus, and we have not met! The first day in which\r\nwe have not met and conversed together, since that whereon you asked me to\r\nbe yours! I would not willingly, my Paul, be as those miserable and most\r\nfoolish girls, of whom my mother has informed me, who, given up to\r\njealousy and doubt, torment themselves in vain, and alienate the noble\r\nspirits, which are bound to them by claims of affection only, not of\r\ncompulsion or restraint. Nor am I so unreasonable as to think, that a man\r\nhas no duties to perform, other than to attend a woman’s leisure. The Gods\r\nforbid it! for whom I love, I would see great, and famous, and esteemed in\r\nthe world’s eyes as highly as in mine! The house, it is true, is our\r\nsphere—the Forum and the Campus, the great world with its toils, its\r\nstrifes, and its honors, yours! All this I speak to myself often. I\r\nrepeated it many, many times yesterday—it ought to have satisfied me—it\r\ndid satisfy my reason, Paul, but it spoke not to my heart! That whispers\r\never, ’he came not yesterday to see me! he promised, yet he came not!’ and\r\nit will not be answered. Are you sick, Paullus, that you came not? Surely\r\nin that case you had sent for me. Hortensia would have gone with me to\r\nvisit you. No! you are not sick, else most surely I had known it! Are you\r\nthen angry with me, or offended? Unconscious am I, dearest, of any fault\r\nagainst you in word, thought, or deed. Yet will I humble myself, if you\r\nare indeed wroth with me. Have I appeared indifferent or cold? oh! Paul,\r\nbelieve it not. If I have not expressed the whole of my deep tenderness\r\nwhich is poured out all, all on thee alone—my yearning and continued love,\r\nthat counts the minutes when thou art not near me; it is not that I cease\r\never to think of thee, to adore thee, but that it were unmaidenly and\r\noverbold to tell thee of it. See, now, if I have not done so here; and my\r\nhand trembles, and my cheek burns, and almost I expect to see the pallid\r\npaper blush, to find itself the bearer of words so passionate as these.\r\nBut you will pardon me, and come to me forthwith, and tell me, if\r\nanything, in what I have displeased thee.\r\n\r\n\"It is a lovely morning, and Hortensia has just learned from Caius\r\nBibulus, that at high noon the ambassadors of the wild Allobroges will\r\nmarch in with their escort over the Mulvian Bridge. She wishes much to see\r\nthe pomp, for we are told that their stature is gigantic and their\r\npresence noble, and their garb very wild, yet magnificent withal and\r\nmartial. Shall we go forth and see them? Hortensia will carry me in her\r\ncarpentum, and you can either ride with us on horseback, or if you be not\r\nover proud take our reins yourself as charioteer, or, what will perhaps be\r\nthe best of all, come in your own car and escort us. I need not say that I\r\nwish to see you _now_, for _that_ I wish always. Come, then, and quickly,\r\nif you would pleasure your own Julia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweet girl,\" he exclaimed, as he finished reading it, \"pure as the snow\r\nupon Soracte, yet warm and tender as the dove. Inimitable Julia! And\r\nI—I—Oh, ye gods! ye gods! that beheld it!\" and he smote his brow heavily\r\nwith his hand, and bit his lip, till the blood almost sprang beneath the\r\npressure of his teeth; but recovering himself in a moment, he turned to\r\nThrasea—\"Who brought this billet? doth he wait?\"\r\n\r\n\"Phædon, Hortensia’s Greek boy, brought it, noble Paullus. He waits for\r\nyour answer in the atrium.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick, then, quick, Thrasea, give me a reed and paper.\"\r\n\r\nAnd snatching the materials he wrote hastily:\r\n\r\n\"Chance only, evil chance, most lovely Julia, and business of some weight,\r\nrestrained me from you most unwilling yesterday. More I shall tell you\r\nwhen we meet—indeed all! for what can I wish to conceal from you, the\r\nbetter portion of my soul. Need I say that I come—not, alas, on the wings\r\nof my love, or I should be beside you as I write, but as quickly as the\r\nspeed of horses may whirl me to your presence; until then, fare you well,\r\nand confide in the fidelity of Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give it to Phædon,\" he said, tossing the note to Thrasea, \"and say to\r\nhim, ’if he make not the better haste, I shall be at Hortensia’s house\r\nbefore him.’ And then, hark ye, tell some of those knaves in the hall\r\nwithout, to make ready with all speed my light chariot, and yoke the two\r\nblack horses Aufidus and Acheron. With all speed, mark ye! And then\r\nreturn, good Thrasea, for I have much to say to you, before I go.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was left alone, he arose from his seat, walked three or four times\r\nto and fro his chamber, in anxious and uneasy thought; and then saying,\r\n\"Yes! yes! I will not betray him, but I will take no step in the business\r\nany farther, and I will tell him so to-night. I will tell him, moreover,\r\nthat Cicero has the dagger, for now that Volero is slain, I see not well\r\nhow it can be identified. The Gods defend me from the dark ones whom I\r\nhave invoked. I will not be untrue to Rome, nor to Julia, any more—perish\r\nthe whole earth, rather! Ay! and let us, too, perish innocent, better than\r\nto live guilty!\"\r\n\r\nAs he made up his mind, by a great effort, to the better course, the\r\nfreedman returned, and announcing that the car would be ready forthwith,\r\ninquired what dress he should bring him.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that! What I have on will do well enough, with a\r\n_petasus_;(15) for the sun shines so brightly that it will be scarce\r\npossible to drive bare headed. But I have work for you of more importance.\r\nYou know the cave of Egeria, as men call it, in the valley of the Muses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, my Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know; but have you ever marked the ground especially around the\r\ncave—what opportunities there be for concealment, or the like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not carefully,\" he answered, \"but I have noticed that there is a little\r\ngorge just beyond the grotto, broken with crags and blocks of tufo, and\r\novergrown with much brushwood, and many junipers and ivy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do then, I warrant me,\" replied Arvina. \"Now mark what I tell\r\nyou, Thrasea; for it may be, that my life shall depend on your acting as I\r\ndirect. At the fourth hour of the night, I am to meet one in the grotto,\r\non very secret business, whom I mistrust somewhat; who it is, I may not\r\ninform you; but, as I think my plans will not well suit his councils, I\r\nshould not be astonished were he to have slaves, or even gladiators, with\r\nhim to attack me—but not dreaming that I suspect anything, he will not\r\ntake many. Now I would have you arm all my freedmen, and some half dozen\r\nof the trustiest slaves, so as to have in all a dozen or fifteen, with\r\ncorslets under their tunics, and boarspears, and swords. You must be\r\ncareful that you are not seen going thither, and you were best send them\r\nout by different roads, so as to meet after nightfall. Hide yourselves\r\nclosely somewhere, not far from the cavern’s mouth, whence you may see,\r\nunseen yourselves, whatever passes. I will carry my light hunting horn;\r\nand if you hear its blast rush down and surround the cave, but hurt no\r\nman, nor strike a blow save in self-defence, until I bid you. Do you\r\ncomprehend me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I comprehend, and will obey you to the letter, Paullus,\" answered the\r\ngrave freedman, \"but will not you be armed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, my Thrasea. Leave thou a leathern hunting helmet here on the\r\ntable, and light scaled cuirass, which I will do on under my toga. I shall\r\nbe there at the fourth hour precisely; but it were well that ye should be\r\non your posts by the second hour or soon after. For it may be, he too will\r\nlay an ambuscade, and so all may be discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done, most noble master.\"\r\n\r\n\"And see that ye take none but trustworthy men, and that ye all are\r\nsilent—to would be ruin.\"\r\n\r\n\"As silent as the grave, my Paullus,\" answered the freedman.\r\n\r\n\"The car and horses are prepared, Paullus,\" exclaimed a slave, entering\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\"Who goes with me to hold the reins?\" asked his master.\r\n\r\n\"The boy Myron.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well. Fetch me a petasus, and lay the toga in the chariot. I may\r\nwant it. Now, Thrasea, I rely on you! Remember—be prudent, sure, and\r\nsilent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Else may I perish ill,\" replied the faithful servitor, as his master,\r\nthrowing the broad brimmed hat carelessly on his curly locks, rushed out,\r\nas if glad to seek relief from his own gloomy thoughts in the excitement\r\nof rapid motion; and, scarcely pausing to observe the condition or\r\nappearance of his beautiful black coursers, sprang into the low car of\r\nbronze, shaped not much differently from an old fashioned arm chair with\r\nits back to the horses; seized the reins, and drove rapidly away, standing\r\nerect—for the car contained no seats—with the boy Myron clinging to the\r\nrail behind him.\r\n\r\nA few minutes brought him through the Cyprian lane and the Suburra to the\r\nVirbian slope, by which he gained the Viminal hill, and the Hortensian\r\nvilla; at the door of which, in a handsome street leading through the\r\nQuirinal gate to the Flaminian way, or great northern road of Italy, stood\r\nthe carpentum, drawn by a pair of noble mules, awaiting its fair freight.\r\n\r\nThis was a two-wheeled covered vehicle, set apart mostly for the use of\r\nladies; and, though without springs, was as comfortable and luxurious a\r\ncarriage as the art of that day could produce; nor was there one in Rome,\r\nwith the exception of those kept for public use in the sacred processions,\r\nthat could excel that of the rich and elegant Hortensia.\r\n\r\nThe pannels were beautifully painted, and the arched top or tilt supported\r\nby gilded caryatides at the four corners. Its curtains and cushions were\r\nof fine purple cloth; and altogether, though far less convenient, it was a\r\nmuch gayer and more sumptuous looking vehicle than the perfection of\r\nmodern coach building.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were both waiting in the atrium, when the young man dismounted\r\nfrom his car; and never had his Julia, he thought, looked more lovely than\r\nshe did this morning, with the redundant masses of her rich hair confined\r\nby a net of green and gold, and a rich _pallium_, or shawl of the same\r\ncolors, gracefully draped over her snowy stola, and indicating by the soft\r\nsweep of its outlines the beauties of a figure, which it might veil but\r\ncould not conceal.\r\n\r\nJoyously, in the frank openness of her pure nature, she sprung forward to\r\nmeet him, with both her fair hands extended, and the ingenuous blood\r\nrising faintly to her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dearest Paul—I am so happy, so rejoiced to see you.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more tender, more affectionate, than all her air, her\r\nwords, her manner. Love flashed from her bright eyes irrepressible, played\r\nin the dimples of her smiling mouth, breathed audible in every tone of her\r\nsoft silvery voice. Yet was there nothing that the gravest and most rigid\r\ncensor could have wished otherwise—nothing that he could have pronounced,\r\neven for a moment, too warm, or too free for the bearing of the chariest\r\nmaiden.\r\n\r\nThe very artlessness of her emotions bore evidence to their purity, their\r\nholiness. She was rejoiced to see her permitted lover, she felt no shame\r\nin that emotion of chaste joy, and would no more have dreamed of\r\nconcealing it from him whom she loved so devotedly, than of masking her\r\ndevotion to the Gods under a veil of indifference or coldness.\r\n\r\nHere was the very charm of her demeanor, as here was the difference\r\nbetween her manner, and that of her rival Lucia.\r\n\r\nIn Julia, every thought that sprang from her heart, was uttered by her\r\nlips in frank and fearless innocence; she had no thought she was ashamed\r\nof, no wish she feared to utter. Her clear bright eyes dwelt unabashed and\r\nfondly on the face of him she loved; and no scrutiny could have detected\r\nin their light, one glance of unquiet or immodest passion. Her manner was\r\nwarm and unreserved toward Paul, because she had a right to love him, and\r\ncared not who knew that she did so. Lucia’s was as cold as snow, on the\r\ncontrary; yet it required no second glance to perceive that the coldness\r\nwas but the cover superinduced to hide passions too warm for revelation.\r\nHer eye was downcast; yet did its stolen glances speak things, the secret\r\nconsciousness of which would have debased the other in her own estimation\r\nbeyond the hope of pardon. Her tongue was guarded, and her words slow and\r\ncarefully selected, for her imaginations would have made the brazen face\r\nof the world blush for shame could it have heard them spoken.\r\n\r\nHortensia smiled to witness the manifest affection of her sweet child; but\r\nthe smile was, she knew not why, half mournful, as she said—\r\n\r\n\"You are unwise, my Julia, to show this truant how much you prize his\r\ncoming; how painfully his absence depresses you. Sages declare that women\r\nshould not let their lords guess, even, how much they are loved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, mother,\" replied Julia, her bright face gleaming radiantly with the\r\npure lustre of her artless spirit, \"I _am_ glad to see him; I _do_ prize\r\nhis coming; I _do_ love Paullus. Why, then, should I dissemble, when to do\r\nso were dishonest, and were folly likewise?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should not tell him so, my child,\" replied the mother, \"I fear you\r\nshould not tell him so. Men are not like us women, who love but the more\r\ndevotedly, the more fondly we are cherished. There is, I fear, something\r\nof the hunter’s, of the conqueror’s, ardour, in their passion; the pursuit\r\nis the great allurement; the winning the great rapture; and the prize,\r\nonce securely won, too often cast aside, and disregarded.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" returned the girl eagerly, fixing her eyes on her lover’s\r\nfeatures, as if she would read therein the outward evidences of that\r\nnobility of soul, which she believed to exist within. \"I will not believe\r\nit; it were against all gratitude! all honor! all heart-truth! No, I will\r\nnot believe it; and if I did, Hortensia, by all the Gods, I had rather\r\nlive without love, than hold it on so vile a tenure of deceit. What,\r\ntreasure up the secrets of your soul from your soul’s lord? No! no! I\r\nwould as soon conceal my devotion from the powers of heaven, as my\r\naffections from their rightful master. I, for one, never will believe that\r\nall men are selfish and unfaithful.\"\r\n\r\n\"May the Gods grant, my Julia, that sad experience shall never teach you\r\nthat they are so. I, at least, will believe, and pray, that, what his sex\r\nmay be soever, our Paullus will prove worthy ever of that best gift of\r\nGod, a pure woman’s pure and unselfish love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! may it be so,\" answered Paullus, clasping his hands fervently\r\ntogether. \"May I die ere I wrong my Julia! and be you sure, sweet girl,\r\nthat your simple trust is philosophy far truer than the sage’s lore. Base\r\nmust his nature be, and his heart corrupt, who remains unsubdued to\r\nartlessness and love, such as yours, my Julia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell us, now,\" said the elder lady, \"what was it that detained you,\r\nand where were you all the day? We expected you till the seventh hour of\r\nthe night, yet you came not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you, Hortensia,\" he replied; \"as we drive along; for I had\r\nrather do so, where there be no ears to overhear us. You must let me be\r\nyour charioteer to-day, and your venerable grey-headed coachman shall ride\r\nwith my wild imp Myron, in the car, if you will permit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly,\" she replied. \"Then something strange has happened. Is it not\r\nso?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" exclaimed Julia, clasping her snowy hands together, \"I knew\r\nit; I have read it in his eye this half hour. What can it be? it is\r\nsomething fearful, I am certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! nay! be not alarmed; if there were danger, it is passed already. But\r\ncome, let me assist you to the carriage; I will tell you all as we go. But\r\nif we do not make good speed, the pomp will have passed the bridge before\r\nwe reach it.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies made no more delay, but took their places in the carriage, Paul\r\noccupying the front seat, and guiding the sober mules with far more ease,\r\nthan Hortensia’s aged charioteer experienced in restraining the speed of\r\nArvina’s fiery coursers, and keeping them in their place, behind the\r\nheavier carpentum.\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets were now passed, and threading the deep arch of the\r\nQuirinal gate, they struck into a lane skirting the base of the hill of\r\ngardens, on the right hand, by which they gained the great Flaminian way,\r\njust on the farther confines of the Campus; when they drove rapidly toward\r\nthe Milvian bridge, built a few years before by Æmilius Scaurus, and\r\nesteemed for many a year the masterpiece of Roman architecture.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had cleared the confines of the busy city, within which\r\nthe throng of vehicles, and the passengers, as well on foot as on\r\nhorseback, compelled Arvina to give nearly the whole of his attention to\r\nthe guidance of the mules—he slackened the reins, and leaving the docile\r\nand well-broken animals to choose their own way, giving only an occasional\r\nglance to their movements, commenced the detail of his adventures at the\r\npoint, where he parted from them on the night before the last.\r\n\r\nMany were the emotions of fear, and pity, and anxiety which that tale\r\ncalled forth; and more than once the tears of Julia were evoked by\r\nsympathy, first, with her lover’s daring, then with the grief of Thrasea.\r\nBut not a shade of distrust came to cloud her pure spirit, for Paullus\r\nmentioned nothing of his interview with Catiline on the Cælian, or in the\r\nCampus; much less of his dining with him, or detecting in him the murderer\r\nof the hapless Volero.\r\n\r\nStill he did not attempt to conceal, that both Cicero and himself had\r\nsuspicions of the identity of the double murderer, or that he was about to\r\ngo forth that very evening, for the purpose of attempting—as he\r\nrepresented it—to ascertain, beyond doubt, the truth of his suspicions.\r\n\r\nAnd here it was singular, that Julia evinced not so much alarm or\r\nperturbation as her mother; whether it was that she underrated the danger\r\nhe was like to run, or overrated the prowess and valor of her lover. But\r\nso it was, for though she listened eagerly while he was speaking, and\r\ngazed at him wistfully after he had become silent, she said nothing. Her\r\nbeautiful eyes, it is true, swam with big tear-drops for a moment, and her\r\nnether lip quivered painfully; but she mastered her feelings, and after a\r\nshort space began to talk joyously about such subjects as were suggested\r\nby the pleasant scenery, through which their road lay, or the various\r\ngroups of people whom they met on the way.\r\n\r\nEre long the shrill blast of a cavalry trumpet was heard from the\r\ndirection of the bridge, and a cloud of dust surging up in the distance\r\nannounced the approach of the train.\r\n\r\nThere was a small green space by the wayside, covered with short mossy\r\nturf, and overshadowed by the spreading branches of a single chesnut,\r\nbeneath which Paullus drew up the mules of Hortensia’s carriage, directing\r\nthe old charioteer, who seemed hard set to manage his high-bred and fiery\r\nsteeds, to wheel completely off the road, and hold them well in hand on\r\nthe green behind him.\r\n\r\nBy this time the procession had drawn nigh, and two mounted troopers,\r\nglittering in casques of highly polished bronze, with waving crests of\r\nhorsehair, corslets of burnished brass, and cassocks of bright scarlet\r\ncloth, dashed by as hard as their fiery Gallic steeds could trot, their\r\nharness clashing merrily from the rate at which they rode. Before these\r\nmen were out of sight, a troop of horse rode past in serried order, five\r\nabreast, with a square crimson banner, bearing in characters of gold the\r\nwell-known initials, S. P. Q. R., and surmounted by a gilded eagle.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more beautifully accurate than the ordered march and\r\nexact discipline of this little band, their horses stepping proudly out,\r\nas if by one common impulse, in perfect time to the occasional notes of\r\nthe _lituus_, or cavalry trumpet, by which all their manœuvres were\r\ndirected; and the men, hardy and fine-looking figures, in the prime of\r\nlife, bestriding with an air of perfect mastery their fiery chargers, and\r\nbearing the weight of their heavy panoply beneath the burning sunshine of\r\nthe Italian noon, as though a march of thirty miles were the merest\r\nchild’s play.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile in the rear of this escort, so as to avoid the dust\r\nwhich hung heavily, and was a long time subsiding in the breathless\r\natmosphere, came the train of the ambassadors from the Gaulish Highlands,\r\nand on these men were the eyes of the Roman ladies fixed with undisguised\r\nwonder, not unmixed with admiration. For their giant stature, strong\r\nlimbs, and wild barbaric dresses, were as different from those of the\r\nwell-ordered legionaries, as were their long light tresses, their blue\r\neyes, keen and flashing as a falcon’s, and their fair ruddy skins, from\r\nthe clear brown complexions, dark locks, and black eyes of the Italian\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe first of these wild people was a young warrior above six feet in\r\nheight, mounted on a superb grey charger, which bore his massive bulk as\r\nif it were unconscious of his burthen. His large blue eyes wandered around\r\nhim on all sides with a quick flashing glance that took in everything, yet\r\nseemed surprised at nothing; though almost everything which he beheld must\r\nhave been strange to him. His long red hair flowed down in wavy masses\r\nover his neck and shoulders, and his upper lip, though his cheeks and his\r\nchin were closely shaven, was clothed with an immense moustache, the ends\r\nof which curled upward nearly to his eyes.\r\n\r\nUpon his head he wore a casque of bronze, covered with studs of silver,\r\nand crested by two vast polished horns, the spoil of the fiercest animal\r\nof Europe’s forests—the gigantic and indomitable Urus. A coat of mail,\r\ncomposed of bright steel rings interwoven in the Gaulish fashion, covered\r\nhis body from the throat downward to the hips, leaving his strong arms\r\nbare to the shoulder, though they were decorated with so many chains,\r\nbracelets, and armlets, and broad rings of gold and silver, as would have\r\ngone far to protect them from a sword cut.\r\n\r\nHis legs were clothed, unlike those of any southern people, in\r\ntightly-sitting pantaloons—_braccæ_, as they were called—of gaily\r\nvariegated tartans, precisely similar to the trews of the Scottish\r\nHighlander—a much more ancient part of the costume, by the way, than the\r\nkilt, or short petticoat, now generally worn—and these trews, as well as\r\nthe streaming plaid, which he wore belted gracefully about his shoulders,\r\nshone resplendent with checkers of the brightest scarlet, azure, and\r\nemerald, and white, interspersed here and there with lines and squares of\r\ndarker colors, giving relief and harmony to the general effect.\r\n\r\nA belt of leather, studded with bosses and knobs of coral and polished\r\nmountain pebbles, girded his waist, and supported a large purse of some\r\nrich fur, with a formidable dirk at the right side, and, at the left,\r\nsuspended by gilt chains from the girdle, a long, straight, cutting\r\nbroadsword, with a basket hilt—the genuine claymore, or great sword—to\r\nresist the sweep of which Marcellus had been fain, nearly five hundred\r\nyears before, to double the strength of the Roman casque, and to add a\r\nfresh layer of wrought iron to the tough fabric of the Roman buckler.\r\n\r\nThis ponderous blade constituted, with the dagger, the whole of his\r\noffensive armature; but there was slung on his left shoulder a small round\r\ntarge, of the hide of the mountain bull, bound at the rim, and studded\r\nmassively with bronze, and having a steel pike projecting from the\r\ncentre—in all respects the same instrument as that with which the clans\r\nreceived the British bayonet at Preston Pans and Falkirk.\r\n\r\nThe charger of this gallantly-attired chief was bedecked, like his rider,\r\nwith all the martial trappings of the day; his bridle, mounted with bits\r\nof ponderous Spanish fabric, was covered with bosses gemmed with amber and\r\nunwrought coral; his housings, of variegated plaid, were elaborately\r\nfringed with embroideries of gold; and his rich scarlet poitrel was\r\ndecked, in the true taste of the western savage, with tufts of human hair,\r\nevery tuft indicating a warrior slain, and a hostile head embalmed in the\r\ncoffers of the valiant rider.\r\n\r\n\"See, Julia, see,\" whispered Arvina, as he passed slowly by their chariot,\r\n\"that must be one of their great chiefs, and a man of extraordinary\r\nprowess. Look at the horns of the mighty Urus on his helmet, a brute\r\nfiercer, and well nigh as large as a Numidian elephant. He must have slain\r\nit, single-handed in the forest, else had he not presumed to wear its\r\ntrophies, which belong only to the greatest of their champions. For every\r\nstud of silver on his casque of bronze he must have fought in a pitched\r\nbattle; and for each tuft of hair upon his charger’s poitrel he must have\r\nslain a foe in hand-to-hand encounter. There are eighteen tufts on this\r\nside, and, I warrant me, as many on the other. Doubtless, he has already\r\nstricken down thirty-six foemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he numbers not himself as yet so many years! Ye Gods! what monsters,\"\r\nexclaimed Julia, shuddering at the idea of human hair used as a\r\ndecoration. \"Are they not anthropophagi, the Gauls, my Paullus?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, by the Gods! Julia,\" answered Arvina, laughing; \"but very valiant\r\nwarriors, and hospitable beyond measure to those who visit their native\r\nmountains; admirers, too, of women, whom they regard as almost divine,\r\nbeyond all things. I see that stout fellow looking wild admiration at you\r\nnow, from his clear blue eyes, though he would fain be thought above the\r\nreach of wonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they believers in the Gods, or Atheists, as well as barbarous?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jupiter! neither barbarous, to speak the truth, nor Atheists; they\r\nworship Mercury and Jove, Mars and Apollo, and Diana, as we do; and though\r\ntheir tongues be something wild, and their usages seem strange to us, it\r\ncannot be denied that they are a brave and noble race, and at this time\r\ngood friends to the Roman people. Mark that old chieftain; he is the\r\nheadman of the tribe, and leader of the embassy, I doubt not.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, a dozen other chiefs had ridden by, accompanied by\r\nthe chiefs of the Roman escort, some men in the prime of life, some\r\ngrizzled and weather-beaten, and having the trace of many a hard-fought\r\nfield in the scars that defaced their sunburnt visages. But the last was\r\nan old man, with long silver hair, and eyebrows and mustachios white as\r\nthe snow on his native Jura; the principal personage evidently of the\r\nband, for his casque was plated with gold, and his shirt of mail richly\r\ngilded, and the very plaid which he wore, alternately checked with\r\nscarlet, black, and gold.\r\n\r\nHe also, as he passed, turned his deep grey eye toward the little group on\r\nthe green, and his face lightened up, as he surveyed the athletic form and\r\nvigorous proportions of the young patrician, and he leaned toward the\r\nofficer, who rode beside him, a high crested tribune of the tenth legion,\r\nand enquired his name audibly.\r\n\r\nThe soldier, who had been nodding drowsily over his charger’s neck, tired\r\nby the long and dusty ride, looked up half bewildered, for he had taken no\r\nnote of the spectators, but as his eyes met those of Arvina, he smiled and\r\nwaved his hand, for they were old companions, and he laughed as he gave\r\nthe required information to the ancient warrior.\r\n\r\nThe gaze of the old man fell next on the lovely lineaments of Julia, and\r\ndwelt there so long that the girl lowered her eyes abashed; but, when she\r\nagain raised them, supposing that he had passed by, she still met the\r\nfirm, penetrating, quiet gaze, rivetted on her face, for he had turned\r\nhalf round in the saddle as he rode along.\r\n\r\nA milder light came into his keen, hawk-like eye, and a benignant smile\r\nilluminated his gray weather-beaten features, as he surveyed and marked\r\nthe ingenuous and artless beauty of her whole form and face; and he\r\nwhispered into the tribune’s ear something that made him too turn back,\r\nand wave his hand to Paul, and laugh merrily.\r\n\r\n\"Now, drive us homeward, Paullus,\" said Hortensia, as the cohort of\r\ninfantry which closed the procession, marched steadily along, dusty and\r\ndark with sweat, yet proud in their magnificent array, and solid in their\r\niron discipline. \"Drive us homeward as quickly as you may. You will dine\r\nwith us, and if you must need go early to your meeting, we will not hinder\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly will I dine with you; but I must say farewell soon after the third\r\nhour!\"\r\n\r\nThey soon arrived at the hospitable villa, and shortly afterward the\r\npleasant and social meal was served. But Paul was not himself, though the\r\nlips he loved best poured forth their fluent music in his ear, and the\r\neyes which he deemed the brightest, laughed on him in their speaking\r\nfondness.\r\n\r\nStill he was sad, silent, and abstracted, and Julia marked it all; and\r\nwhen he rose to say farewell, just as the earliest shades of night were\r\nfalling, she arose too; and as she accompanied him to the door, leaning\r\nfamiliarly on his arm, she said—\r\n\r\n\"You have not told me all, Paullus. I thought so while you were yet\r\nspeaking; but now I am sure of it. I will not vex you at this time with\r\nquestions, but will devour my anxiety and grief. But to-morrow, to-morrow,\r\nPaullus, if you love me indeed, you will tell me all that disturbs you.\r\nTrue love has no concealment from true love. Do not, I pray you, answer\r\nme; but fare you well, and good fortunes follow you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMBUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                My friends,\r\n        That is not so. Sir, we are your enemies.\r\n                TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.\r\n\r\nIt was already near the fourth hour of the Roman night, or about a quarter\r\npast eight of our time, when Paullus issued from the Capuan gate, in order\r\nto keep his appointment with the conspirator; and bold as he was, and\r\nfearless under ordinary circumstances, it would be useless to deny that\r\nhis heart beat fast and anxiously under his steel cuirass, as he strode\r\nrapidly along the Appian way to the place of meeting.\r\n\r\nThe sun had long since set, and the moon, which was in her last quarter,\r\nhad not as yet risen; so that, although the skies were perfectly clear and\r\ncloudless, there was but little light by which to direct his foot-steps\r\ntoward the valley of the Muses, had he not been already familiar with the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nStepping out rapidly, for he was fearful now of being too late at the\r\nplace appointed, he soon passed the two branches of the beautiful and\r\nsparkling Almo, wherein the priests of Cybele were wont to lave the statue\r\nof their goddess, amid the din of brazen instruments and sacred song; and\r\na little further on, arrived at the cross-road where the way to Ardea, in\r\nthe Latin country, branched off to the right hand from the great Appian\r\nturnpike.\r\n\r\nAt this point there was a small temple sacred to Bacchus, and a little\r\ngrove of elms and plane trees overrun with vines, on which the ripe\r\nclusters consecrated to the God were hanging yet, though the season of the\r\nvintage had elapsed, safe from the hand of passenger or truant school-boy.\r\n\r\nTurning around the angle of this building, Arvina entered a dim lane,\r\novershadowed by the tall trees of the grove, which wound over two or three\r\nlittle hillocks, and then sweeping downward to the three kindred\r\nstreamlets, which form the sources of the Almo, followed their right bank\r\nup the valley of the Muses.\r\n\r\nHad the mind of Arvina been less agitated than it was by dark and ominous\r\nforebodings, that walk had been a pleasant one, in the calm and breezeless\r\nevening. The stars were shining by thousands in the deep azure sky; the\r\nconstant chirrup of the shrill-voiced cicala, not mute as yet, although\r\nhis days of tuneful life were well nigh ended, rose cheerfully above the\r\nrippling murmurs of the waters, and the mysterious rustling of the herbage\r\nrejoicing to drink up the copious dew; and heard by fits and starts from\r\nthe thick clumps of arbutus on the hills, or the thorn bushes on the\r\nwater’s brink, the liquid notes of the nightingale gushed out, charming\r\nthe ear of darkness.\r\n\r\nFor the first half mile of his walk, the young patrician met several\r\npersons on the way—two or three pairs of lovers, as they seemed, of the\r\nlower orders, strolling affectionately homeward; a party of rural slaves\r\nreturning from their labours on some suburban farm, to their master’s\r\nhouse; and more than one loaded chariot; but beyond this all was lonely\r\nand silent, with the exception of the stream, the insects, and the vocal\r\nnight-bird.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound or sight that would seem to indicate the vicinity of\r\nany human being, as Arvina, passing the mouth of a small gorge or hollow\r\nscooped out of the bosom of a soft green hill, paused at the arch of a low\r\nbut richly ornamented grotto, hollowed out of the face of the rock, and\r\nsupported by a vault of reticulated brick-work, decorated elegantly with\r\nreliefs of marble and rich stucco. The soft green mosses and dark tendrils\r\nof the waving ivy, which drooped down from the rock and curtained well\r\nnigh half the opening, rendered the grotto very dark within. And it was a\r\nmoment or two before Paullus discovered that he was alone in that secluded\r\nplace, or in the company only of the old marble god, who, reclining on a\r\ncouch of the same material at the farther end of the cave, poured forth\r\nhis bright waters from an inverted jar, into the clear cool basin which\r\nfilled the centre of the place.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised not a little at finding himself the first at the place of\r\nmeeting, for he was conscious that he was behind his time; and had,\r\nindeed, come somewhat late on purpose, with a view of taking his stand as\r\nif naturally during the interview, between the conspirator and the cave\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, altogether a matter of regret to him, that he had\r\ngained a little time, for the folds of his toga required some adjustment,\r\nin order to enable him to get readily at the hilt of his sword, and the\r\nmouth-piece of his hunting-horn, which he carried beneath his gown. And he\r\napplied himself to that purpose immediately, congratulating himself, as he\r\ndid so, on the failure of his first project, and thinking how much better\r\nit would be for him to stand as far as possible from the entrance, so as\r\nto avoid even the few rays of dim star-light, which crept in through the\r\ntangled ivy.\r\n\r\nThis was soon done; and in accordance with his afterthought, he sat down\r\non a projecting angle of the statue’s marble couch, in the inmost corner\r\nof the vault, facing the door, and having the pool of the fountain\r\ninterposed between that and himself.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments he sat thinking anxiously about the interview, which he\r\nbelieved, not without cause, was likely to prove embarrassing, at least,\r\nif not perilous. But, when he confessed to himself, which he was very soon\r\ncompelled to do, that he could shape nothing of his own course, until he\r\nshould hear what were the plans in which Catiline desired his cooperation;\r\nand when time fled and the man came not, his mind began to wander, and to\r\nthink about twenty gay and pleasant subjects entirely disconnected with\r\nthe purpose for which he had come thither. Then he fell gradually into a\r\nsort of waking dream, or vision, as it were, of wandering fancies, made up\r\npartly of the sounds which he actually heard with his outward ears, though\r\nhis mind took but little note of them, and partly of the occurrences in\r\nwhich he had been mixed up, and the persons with whom he had been brought\r\ninto contact within the last two or three days. The gory visage of the\r\nmurdered slave, the sweet and calm expression of his own Julia, the\r\ntruculent eyes and sneering lip of Catiline, and the veiled glance and\r\nvoluptuous smile of his too seductive daughter, whirled still before him\r\nin a strange sort of human phantasmagoria, with the deep searching look of\r\nthe consul orator, the wild glare of the slaughtered Volero, and the stern\r\nface, grand and proud in his last agony, of the dying Varus.\r\n\r\nIn this mood he had forgotten altogether where he was, and on what\r\npurpose, when a deep voice aroused him with a start, and though he had\r\nneither heard his footstep, nor seen him enter, Catiline stood beside his\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n\"What ho!\" he exclaimed, \"Paullus, have I detained you long in this dark\r\nsolitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I know not how long,\" replied the other, \"for I had fallen into\r\nstrange thoughts, and forgotten altogether the lapse of time; but here\r\nhave I been since the fourth hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is now already past the fifth,\" said Cataline, \"but come, we must\r\nmake up for the loss of time. Some friends of mine are waiting for us, to\r\nwhom I wish to introduce you, that you may become altogether one of us,\r\nand take the oaths of fidelity. Give me the dagger now, and let us be\r\ngoing on our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it not with me, Catiline.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have it not with you! Wherefore not? wherefore not, I say, boy?\" cried\r\nthe conspirator, very savagely. \"By all the furies in deep hell, you were\r\nbetter not dally with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is no longer in my possession; and therefore I could not bring\r\nit with me,\" he replied firmly, for the threats of the other only inflamed\r\nhis pride, and so increased his natural courage.\r\n\r\n\"By the Gods, you brave me, then!\" exclaimed Catiline; \"fool! fool! beware\r\nhow you tamper with your fate. Speak instantly, speak out: to whom have\r\nyou dared give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no daring in the matter, Catiline,\" he answered steadily,\r\nkeeping an eye on the arch-traitor’s movements; \"before I knew that it was\r\nyours, I sent it, as I had promised, to Cicero, with word that Volero\r\ncould tell him who was the owner of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, didst thou so?\" said the other, mastering instantly his fury, in his\r\ndesire to make himself fully acquainted with all that had passed. \"When\r\nwas all this? has he seen Volero, and learned the secret of him, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent it, Catiline, within an hour of the time I left the Campus\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before coming to my house to dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before going to thy house to dinner, Sergius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before seducing Lucia Orestilla?\" again sneered the desperate villain.\r\n\r\n\"Before yielding,\" answered the young man, who was now growing angry, for\r\nhis temper was not of the meekest, \"to her irresistible seduction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! yielding—well! we will speak of that hereafter. Hath the consul seen\r\nVolero?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hath seen him dead; and how dead, Catiline best knoweth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was, then, thou, whom I saw in the feeble lamplight with the accursed\r\nwretch that crosses my path everywhere, the dastard, drivelling dotard of\r\nArpinum; thou that despite thine oath, didst lead him to detect the man,\r\nthou hadst sworn to obey, and follow! Thou! it is thou, then, that\r\nhoundest mine enemies upon my track! By the great Gods, I know not whether\r\nmost to marvel at the sublime, unrivalled folly, which could lead thee to\r\nfancy, that thou, a mere boy and tyro, couldst hoodwink eyes like mine; or\r\nat the daring which could prompt thee to rush headlong on thine own ruin\r\nin betraying me! Boy, thou hast but one course left; to join us heart and\r\nhand; to go and renew thine oath in such fashion as even thou,\r\npremeditated perjurer, wilt not presume to break, and then to seal thy\r\nfaith by the blood\"—\r\n\r\n\"Of whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of this new man; this pendant consul of Arpinum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" exclaimed Paullus, as if half tempted to accede to his proposal;\r\n\"and if I do so, what shall I gain thereby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucia, I might say,\" answered Catiline, \"but—seeing that possession damps\r\nsomething at all times the fierceness of pursuit—what if I should reply,\r\nthe second place in Rome?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Rome?\"\r\n\r\n\"When we have beaten down the proud patricians to our feet, and raised the\r\nconquering ensign of democratic sway upon the ramparts of the capitol;\r\nwhen Rome and all that she contains of bright and beautiful, shall be our\r\nheritage and spoil; the second place, I say, in regenerated Rome, linked,\r\ntoo, to everlasting glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the first place?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Mars the great avenger! dost soar so high a pitch already? ho! boy,\r\nthe first is mine, by right, as by daring. How say you? are you mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I say no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou diest on the instant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Arvina quietly, \"and I do answer No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perish, fool, in thy folly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd leaping forward he dealt him a blow with a long two-edged dagger,\r\nwhich he had held in his hand naked, during the whole discussion, in\r\nreadiness for the moment he anticipated; and at the same instant uttered a\r\nloud clear whistle.\r\n\r\nTo his astonishment the blade glanced off the breast of the young man, and\r\nhis arm was stunned nearly to the shoulder by the unexpected resistance of\r\nthe stout corslet. The whistle was answered, however, the very moment it\r\nwas uttered; and just as he saw Paullus spring to the farther side of the\r\ncavern, and set his back against the wall, unsheathing a heavy broadsword\r\nof the short Roman fashion, three stout men entered the mouth of the cave,\r\nheavily armed with weapons of offence, although they wore no defensive\r\narmor.\r\n\r\n\"Give me a sword,\" shouted the fierce conspirator, furious at being\r\nfoiled, and perceiving that his whole enterprise depended on the young\r\nman’s destruction. \"He is armed under his gown with a breast-plate! Give\r\nme a sword, and then set on him all at once. So that will do, now, on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold, Sergius Catiline,\" exclaimed Arvina, \"hold, or by all the Gods you\r\nwill repent it. If you have three men at your back I have full five times\r\nthree within call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call them, then!\" answered the other, making at him, \"call them! think\r\nyou again to fool me? Ho, Geta and Arminius, get round the fountain and\r\nset on him! make haste I say—kill—kill.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the word he rushed at him, aiming a fierce blow at his head,\r\nwhile the others a moment afterward charged on him from the other side.\r\n\r\nBut during the brief parley Arvina had disengaged the folds of his gown\r\nfrom his light shoulder, and wrapped it closely about his left arm, and\r\nwhen Catiline rushed in he parried the blow with his sword, and raising\r\nthe little horn he carried, to his lips, blew a long piercing call, which\r\nwas answered by a loud shout close at hand, and by the rush of many feet\r\nwithout the grotto.\r\n\r\nCatiline was himself astonished at the unexpected aid, for he had taken\r\nthe words of the young patrician for a mere boast. But his men were\r\nalarmed and fell back in confusion, while Paul, profiting by their\r\nhesitation, sprang with a quick active bound across the basin of the\r\nfountain, and gained the cavern’s mouth just as his stout freedman Thrasea\r\nshowed himself in the entrance with a close casque and cuirass of bronze,\r\nand a boar spear in his hand, the heads and weapons of several other\r\nable-bodied men appearing close behind.\r\n\r\nAt the head of these Arvina placed himself instantly, having his late\r\nassailants hemmed in by a force, against which they now could not\r\nreasonably hope to struggle.\r\n\r\nBut Paullus showed no disposition to take undue advantage of his\r\nsuperiority, for he said in a calm steady voice, \"I leave you now, my\r\nfriend; and it will not be my fault, if aught that has passed here, is\r\nremembered any farther. None here have seen you, or know who you are; and\r\nyou may rest assured that for _her_ sake and mine own honor, if I join not\r\nyour plans, I will not betray you, or reveal your counsels. To that I am\r\nsworn, and come what may, my oath shall not be broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush,\" cried the other, maddened by disappointment, and filled with\r\ndesperate apprehensions, \"men trust not avowed traitors. Upon them, I say,\r\nyou dogs. Let there be forty of them, but four can stand abreast in the\r\nentrance, and we can front them, four as good as they.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he again dashed at Arvina, without waiting to see if his gladiators\r\nmeant to second his attack; but they hung back, reluctant to fight against\r\nsuch odds; for, though brave men, and accustomed to risk their lives,\r\nwithout quarrel or excitement, for the gratification of the brute populace\r\nof Rome, they had come to the cave of Egeria, prepared for assassination,\r\nnot for battle; and their antagonists were superior to them as much in\r\naccoutrement and arms—for their bronze head-pieces were seen distinctly\r\nglimmering in the rays of the rising moon—as in numbers.\r\n\r\nThe blades of the leaders clashed together, and several quick blows and\r\nparries had been interchanged, during which Thrasea, had he not been\r\nrestrained by his young master’s orders, might easily have stabbed the\r\nconspirator with his boar-spear. But he held back at first, waiting a\r\nfresh command, until seeing that none came, and that the unknown opponent\r\nwas pressing his lord hard; while the gladiators, apparently encouraged by\r\nhis apathy, were beginning to handle their weapons, he shifted his spear\r\nin his hands, and stepping back a pace, so as to give full scope to a\r\nsweeping blow, he flourished the butt, which was garnished with a heavy\r\nball of metal, round his head in a figure of eight, and brought it down so\r\nheavily on the felt skull-cap of the conspirator, that his teeth jarred\r\naudibly together, a quick flash sprang across his eyes, and he fell,\r\nstunned and senseless, at the feet of his intended victim.\r\n\r\n\"Hold, Thrasea, hold,\" cried Paullus, \"by the Gods! you have slain him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not. No! no! his head is too hard for that,\" answered the\r\nfreedman; \"I felt my staff rebound from the bone, which it would not have\r\ndone, had the skull been fractured. No! he is not dead, though he deserved\r\nto die very richly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of it,\" replied Paullus. \"I would not have him killed, for many\r\nreasons. Now, hark ye, ye scoundrels and gallows-birds! most justly are\r\nyour lives forfeit, whether it seem good to me, to take them here this\r\nmoment, or to drag you away, and hand you over to the lictors of the\r\ncity-prætor, as common robbers and assassins.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you cannot do, whilst we live, most noble,\" answered the boldest of\r\nthe gladiators, sullenly; \"and you cannot, I think, take our lives,\r\nwithout leaving some of your own on our swords’ points.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brave me not,\" cried the young man, sternly, \"lest you drive me to do\r\nthat I would not. Your lives, I say, are forfeit; but, seeing that I love\r\nnot bloodshed, I leave you, for this time, unpunished. Take up the master\r\nwhom you serve, and bear him home; and, when he shall be able to receive\r\nit, tell him Paullus Arvina pardons his madness, pities his fears, and\r\nbetrays no man’s trust—least of all his. For the rest, let him choose\r\nbetween enmity and friendship. I care not which it be. I can defend my own\r\nlife, and assail none. Beware how you follow us. If you do, by all the\r\nGods! you die. See, he begins to stir. Come, Thrasea, call off your men;\r\nwe will go, ere he come to his senses, lest worse shall befal.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the words he turned his back contemptuously on the crest-fallen\r\ngladiators, and strode haughtily across the threshold, leaving the fierce\r\nconspirator, as he was beginning to recover his scattered senses, to the\r\nkeen agony of conscious villainy frustrated, and the stings of defeated\r\npride and disappointed malice.\r\n\r\nThe night was well advanced, when he reached his own house, having met no\r\ninterruption on the way, proud of his well-planned stratagem, elated by\r\nsuccess, and flattered by the hope that he had extricated himself by his\r\nown energy from all the perils which had of late appeared so dark and\r\ndifficult to shun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Duri magno sed amore dolores\r\n        Pollute, notumque furens quid femina possit.\r\n       ÆN. V. 6.                 VIRGIL.\r\n\r\nIt was not till a late hour on the following day, that Catiline awoke from\r\nthe heavy and half lethargic slumber, which had fallen upon him after the\r\nsevere and stunning blow he received in the grotto of Egeria.\r\n\r\nHis head ached fearfully, his tongue clove to his palate parched with\r\nfever, and all his muscular frame was disjointed and unstrung, so\r\nviolently had his nerves been shattered.\r\n\r\nFor some time after he awoke, he lay tossing to and fro, on his painful\r\ncouch, scarce conscious of his own identity, and utterly forgetful of the\r\noccurrences of the past evening.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees, however, the truth began to dawn upon him, misty at first\r\nand confused, until he brought to his mind fairly the attack on Arvina,\r\nand the affray which ensued; with something of an indistinct consciousness\r\nthat he had been stricken down, and frustrated in his murderous attempt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the certainty of this was impressed on him, he sprang up from\r\nhis bed, with his wonted impetuosity, and inquired vehemently of a\r\nfreedman, who sat in his chamber motionless as a statue in expectation of\r\nhis waking—\r\n\r\n\"How came I home, Chærea? and at what hour of night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grievously wounded, Catiline; and supported in the arms of the sturdy\r\nGermans, Geta and Arminius; and, for the time, it was past the eighth\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\n\"The eighth hour! impossible!\" cried the conspirator; \"why it was but the\r\nfifth, when that occurred. What said I, my good Chærea? What said the\r\nGermans? Be they here now? Answer me quick, I pray you.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was but one word on your lips, Catiline; a constant cry for water,\r\nwater, so long as you were awake; and after we had given you of it, as\r\nmuch as you would take, and you had fallen into a disturbed and feverish\r\nsleep, you still muttered in your dreams, ’water!’ The Germans answered\r\nnothing, though all the household questioned them; and, in good truth,\r\nCatiline, it was not very long that they were capable of answering, for as\r\nsoon as you were in bed, they called for wine, and in less than an hour\r\nwere thoroughly besotted and asleep. They are here yet, I think, sleeping\r\naway the fumes of their potent flagons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call me Arminius, hither. Hold! What is the time of day?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun is high already; it must be now near the fourth hour!\"\r\n\r\n\"So late! you did ill, Chærea, to let me lie so long. Call me Arminius\r\nhither; and send me one of the boys; or rather go yourself, Chærea, and\r\npray Cornelius Lentulus the Prætor, to visit me before he take his seat on\r\nthe Puteal Libonis. It is his day, I think, to take cognizance of criminal\r\nmatters. Begone, and do my bidding!\"\r\n\r\nWithin a moment the Athenian freedman, for he was of that proud though\r\nfallen city, returned conducting the huge German gladiator, whose\r\nbewildered air and bloodshot eyes seemed to betoken that he had not as yet\r\nrecovered fully from the effect of his last night’s potations.\r\n\r\nNo finer contrast could be imagined by poet or painter, than was presented\r\nby those three men, each eminently striking in his own style, and\r\ncharacteristic of his nation. The tall spare military-looking Roman, with\r\nhis hawk nose and eagle eye, and close shaved face and short black hair,\r\nhis every attitude and look and gesture full of pride and dominion; the\r\nversatile and polished Greek, beautiful both in form and face, as a marble\r\nof Praxiteles, beaming with intellect, and having every feature eloquent\r\nof poetry and imagination, and something of contempt for the sterner and\r\nharder type of mind, to which he and his countryman were subjugated; and\r\nlast, the wild strong-limbed yet stolid-looking German, glaring out with\r\nhis bright blue eyes, full of a sort of stupid fierceness, from the long\r\ncurls of his auburn hair, a type of man in his most primitive state, the\r\nhunter and the warrior of the forest, enslaved by Rome’s insatiate\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nCatiline looked at him fiercely for a moment, and then nodded his head, as\r\nif in assent to some of his own meditations; then muttering to himself,\r\n\"the boar! the mast-fed German boar!\" he turned to the Greek, saying\r\nsharply—\r\n\r\n\"Art thou not gone to Lentulus? methought thou hadst been thither, and\r\nreturned ere this time! Yet tarry, since thou art here still. Are any of\r\nmy clients in the atrium—any, I mean, of the trustiest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rufinus, surnamed Lupus, is without, and several others. Stolo, whom you\r\npreserved from infamy, when accused of _dolus malus_, in the matter of\r\nassault with arms on Publius Natro, is waiting to solicit you, I fancy,\r\nfor some favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very man—the Wolf is the very man! and your suitor for favors cannot\r\nrefuse to confer what he requests. Stay my Chærea. Send Glycon to summon\r\nLentulus, and go yourself and find out what is Stolo’s suit. Assure him of\r\nmy friendship and support; and, hark you, have him and Rufinus into an\r\ninner chamber, and set bread before them and strong wine, and return to me\r\npresently. Now, then, Arminius,\" he continued, as the Greek left the room,\r\n\"what did we do last night, and what befel us?—for I can remember nothing\r\nclearly.\"\r\n\r\nThe giant shook his tawny locks away from his brow, and gazed into his\r\nemployer’s face with a look of stolid inquiry, and then answered—\r\n\r\n\"Do! we did nothing, that I know! We followed thee as in duty bound to\r\nthat cave by the Almo; and when we had stayed there awhile, we brought\r\nthee back again, seeing thou couldst not go alone. What can I tell? you\r\nknow yourself why you took us thither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou stupid brute!\" retorted Catiline, \"or worse than brute, rather—for\r\nbrutes augment not their brutishness by gluttony and wine-bibbing—thou art\r\nasleep yet! see if this will awaken thee!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the word he snatched up a large brazen ewer full of cold water,\r\nwhich stood on a slab near him, and hurled it at his head. The gladiator\r\nstood quite still, and merely bent his neck a little to avoid the heavy\r\nvessel, which almost grazed his temples, and then shook himself like a\r\nwater spaniel, as the contents flashed full into his face and eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Do not do that again,\" he grunted, \"unless you want to have your throat\r\nsqueezed.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Pollux the pugilist! he threatens!\" exclaimed Catiline, laughing at\r\nhis dogged anger. \"Do you not know, cut-throat, that one word of mine can\r\nhave your tough hide slashed with whips in the common gaol, till your very\r\nbones are bare?\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know what difference it makes, whether my hide be slashed with\r\ndog-whips in the gaol, or with broadswords in the amphitheatre? A man can\r\nonly die! and it were as well, in my mind, to die having killed a Roman in\r\nhis own house, as a countryman on the arena.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods!\" cried Catiline, \"he is a philosopher! but, look you\r\nhere, my German Solon, you were better regard me, and attend to what I\r\ntell you; so may you escape both gaol and amphitheatre. Tell me, briefly,\r\ndistinctly, and without delay, what fell out last evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"You led us to assault that younker, whom you know; and when we would have\r\nset upon him, and finished his business easily, he blew a hunting horn,\r\nand fifteen or sixteen stout fellows in full armor came down the bank from\r\nbehind and shut up the cave’s mouth—you know as well as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far I do, most certainly,\" replied the conspirator, \"but what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, thou wouldest not hear reason; but, though the youth swore he\r\nwould not betray thee, must needs lay on, one man against sixteen; and so,\r\nas was like, gottest thine head broken by a blow of a boar-spear from a\r\ngreat double-handed Thracian. For my part, I wondered he did not put the\r\nspear-head through and through you. It was a great pity that he did not;\r\nit would have saved us all, and you especially, a world of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, cowardly dogs, forsook me; and held back, when by a bold rush we\r\nmight easily have slain him, and cut our way through the dastard slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no! we could not; they were all Thracians, Dacians, and Pannonians;\r\nand were completely armed, too. We might have killed him, very likely, but\r\nwe could never have escaped ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he, he? what became of him when I had fallen?\"\r\n\r\n\"He bade us take you up,\" replied the German, \"and carry you home, and\r\ntell you ’to fear nothing, he would betray no man, least of all you.’ He\r\nis a fine young fellow, in my judgment; for he might just as well have\r\nkilled us all, as not, if he had been so minded; and I can’t say but that\r\nit would have served us rightly, for taking odds of four to one upon a\r\nsingle man. That is, I know, what you Romans call fighting; beyond the\r\nRhine we style it cowardly and murder! Then, after that he went off with\r\nhis men, leaving us scratching our heads, and looking as dastardly and\r\ncrest-fallen as could be. And then we brought you home hither, after it\r\nhad got late enough to carry you through the streets, without making an\r\nuproar; and then Lydon and Chærea put you to bed; and I, and Geta, and\r\nArdaric, as for us, we got drunk, seeing there was no more work to do last\r\nnight, and not knowing what might be to do, to-day. And so it is all well,\r\nvery well, as I see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, call you it, when he has got off unscathed, and lives to avenge\r\nhimself, and betray me?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he swore he would do neither, Catiline,\" answered the simple-minded\r\nson of the forest.\r\n\r\n\"Swore!\" replied the conspirator, with a fell sneer.\r\n\r\n\"Ay did he, master! swore by all that was sacred he would never betray any\r\nman, and you least of all; and I believe he will keep his promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" answered Catiline, bitterly, \"I swear he shall; not for the\r\nlack of will, but of means to do otherwise! You are a stupid brute,\r\nArminius; but useful in your way. I have no need of you to-day, so go and\r\ntell the butler to give you wine enough to make all three of you drunk\r\nagain; but mind that ye are sound, clear-headed, and alert at day-break\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will he give it to me at my bidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"If not, send him to me for orders; now, begone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask for nothing better,\" replied the gladiator, and withdrew, without\r\nany word or gesture of salutation, in truth, despising the Roman in his\r\nheart as deeply for what he deemed his over-craftiness and\r\nover-civilization, as the more polished Greek did, for what on his side he\r\nconsidered the utter absence of both.\r\n\r\nScarce had the German left the room, before the Greek returned, smiling,\r\nand seemingly well satisfied with the result of his mission.\r\n\r\nCatiline looked at him steadily, and nodding his head, asked him quietly—\r\n\r\n\"Are they prepared, Chærea?\"\r\n\r\n\"To do anything you would have them, Catiline. Stolo, it seems, is again\r\nemperilled—another charge of attempt to murder—and he wants you to screen\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so I will; and will do more. I will make him rich and great, if he do\r\nmy bidding. Now go, and make them understand this. They must swear that\r\nthey came hither this morning to claim my aid in bringing them to speech\r\nwith Lentulus, the Prætor, and then thou must be prepared to swear,\r\nChærea, that I have had no speech or communication with them at all—which\r\nis quite true.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a pity,\" answered the Greek, coolly; \"for any one can swear\r\nsteadily to the truth, but it requires genius to carry out a lie bravely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! never fear, thou shalt have lies enough to swear to! Now mark me,\r\nwhen Lentulus comes hither, they must accuse to him Paullus Cæcilius\r\nArvina, whose person, if they know him not, you must describe to them—him\r\nwho dined with me, you know, the day before yesterday—of subornation to\r\ncommit murder. The place where he did so, the top of the Cælian hill. The\r\ntime, sunrise on that same day. The person whom he desired them to slay,\r\nVolero the cutler, who dwelt in the Sacred Way. They must make up the tale\r\ntheir own way, but to these facts they must swear roundly. Do you\r\nunderstand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly; they shall do it well, and both be in one tale. I will help\r\nthem to concoct it, and dress it up with little truthful incidents that\r\nwill tell. But are you sure that he cannot prove he was not there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure, Chærea. For he _was_ there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no witnesses who can prove to whom he spoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one witness, and he will say nothing, unless called upon by\r\nPaullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if so called upon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will most reluctantly corroborate the tale of Stolo and Rufinus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed the freedman, \"thou shouldst have been a Greek,\r\nCatiline, thou art too shrewd to be a mere Roman.\"\r\n\r\n\"A _mere_ Roman, hang-dog!\" answered Catiline, \"but thou knowest thine\r\nopportunity, and profitest by it! so let it pass! Now as for thee, seeing\r\nthou dost love lying, thou shalt have thy part. Thou shalt swear that the\r\nnight before that same morning, at a short time past midnight, thou wert\r\nreturning by the Wicked street, from the house of Autronius upon the\r\nQuirinal, whither I sent thee to bid him to dinner the next day—he shall\r\nconfirm the tale—when thou didst hear a cry of murder from the Plebeian\r\ngraveyard on the Esquiline; and hurrying to the spot, didst see Arvina,\r\nwith his freedman Thrasea bearing a torch, conceal a fresh bleeding body\r\nin a broken grave; and, hidden by the stem of a great tree thyself, didst\r\nhear him say, as he left the ground, ’That dog will tell no tales!’ Thou\r\nmust swear, likewise, that thou didst tell me the whole affair the next\r\nmorning, and that I bade thee wait for farther proof ere speaking of the\r\nmatter. And again, that we visited the spot where thou saw’st the deed,\r\nand found the grass trampled and bloody, but could not find the body.\r\nCanst thou do this, thinkest thou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely I can,\" said the Athenian, rubbing his hands as if well pleased,\r\n\"so that no one shalt doubt the truth of it! And thou wilt confirm the\r\ntruth?\"\r\n\r\n\"By chiding thee for speaking out of place. See that thou blurt it out\r\nabruptly, as if unable to keep silence any longer, as soon as the others\r\nhave finished their tale. Begone and be speedy. Lentulus will be here\r\nanon!\"\r\n\r\nThe freedman withdrew silently, and Catiline was left alone in communion\r\nwith his own bad and bitter thoughts; and painful, as it seemed, and\r\nterrible, even to himself, was that communion, for he rose up from his\r\nseat and paced the room impetuously, to and fro, gnashing and grinding his\r\nteeth, and biting his lips till the blood sprang out.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, however, he mastered his passions, and began to dress\r\nhimself, which he did by fits and starts in a manner perfectly\r\ncharacteristic of the man, uttering hideous imprecations if the least\r\nthing ran counter to his wishes, and flinging the various articles of his\r\nattire about the chamber with almost frantic violence.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had finished dressing himself, Lentulus was announced, and\r\nentered with his dignified and haughty manner, not all unmixed with an air\r\nof indolence.\r\n\r\n\"All hail, my Sergius,\" he exclaimed, as he crossed the threshold. \"What\r\nhast thou of so grave importance, that thou must intercept me on my way to\r\nthe judgment seat? Nothing has gone wrong in our councils—ha?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that I know,\" answered Catiline, \"but here are two of my\r\ntrustiest clients, Stolo and Rufinus, have been these three hours waiting\r\nfor my awakening, that I might gain your ear for them. They sent me word\r\nthey had a very heavy charge to make to you; but for my part, I have not\r\nseen them, and know not what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush! tush! man; never tell me that,\" replied Lentulus, with a grim\r\nsmile. \"Do you think I will believe you have sent for me all the way\r\nhither this morning, without some object of your own to serve? No! no! my\r\nfriend; with whomsoever that may pass, it will not go current with\r\nCornelius Lentulus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you please,\" said the traitor; \"you may believe me or not exactly\r\nas you choose; but it is true, nevertheless, that I have neither seen the\r\nmen, nor spoken with them. Nor do I know at all what they want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would, then, you had not sent for me,\" answered the other. \"Come, let\r\nus have the knaves in. I suppose they have been robbing some one’s\r\nhen-roost, and want to lay the blame on some one else!\"\r\n\r\n\"What ho! Chærea.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke the word, the curtain which covered the door-way was\r\nwithdrawn, and the keen-witted freedman made his appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Admit those fellows, Stolo and Rufinus. The prætor is prepared to give\r\nthem a hearing.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult, perhaps, to have selected from the whole\r\npopulation of Rome at that day, a more murderous looking pair of\r\nscoundrels.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sirrahs, what secrets of the state have you that weigh so\r\nponderously on your wise thoughts?\" asked Lentulus, with a contemptuous\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n\"Murder, most noble Lentulus—or at least subornation thereof,\" answered\r\none of the ruffians.\r\n\r\n\"Most natural indeed! I should have thought as much. Well, tell us in a\r\nword—for it is clear that nobody has murdered either of you—whom have you\r\nmurdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we have murdered no one, it was not for the lack of prompting, or of\r\nbribes either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! I should have thought a moderate bribe would have arranged the\r\nmatter easily. But come! come! to the point! whom were ye bribed or\r\ninstigated to get rid of? speak! I am in haste!\"\r\n\r\n\"The cutler, Caius Volero!\"\r\n\r\n\"Volero! Ha!\" cried Lentulus, starting. \"Indeed! indeed! that may well be.\r\nBy whom, then, were you urged to the deed, and when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Paullus Cæcilius Arvina tempted us to the deed, by the offer of ten\r\nthousand sesterces! We met him by appointment upon the Cælian hill, at the\r\nhead of the Minervium, a little before sunrise, the day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" and for a moment or two Lentulus fixed his eyes upon the ground, and\r\npondered deeply on what he had just heard. \"Have ye seen Volero since?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Prætor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor heard anything concerning him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" said Stolo. But he spoke with a confused air and in an\r\nundecided tone, which satisfied the judge that he was speaking falsely.\r\nRufinus interposed, however, saying—\r\n\r\n\"But I have, noble Lentulus. I heard say that he _was_ murdered in his own\r\nbooth, that same night!\"\r\n\r\n\"And having heard this, you told it not to Stolo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never thought about it any more,\" answered Rufinus doggedly, seeing\r\nthat he had got into a scrape.\r\n\r\n\"That was unfortunate, and somewhat strange, too, seeing that you came\r\nhither together to speak about the very man. Now mark me. Volero _was_\r\nthat night murdered, and it appears to me, that you are bringing this\r\naccusation against a young patrician, in order to conceal your own base\r\nhandiwork in the deed. Fellows, I grievously suspect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrongfully, then, you do so,\" answered Stolo, who was the bolder and more\r\nready witted of the two. \"Rufinus ever was a forgetful fool; and I trow I\r\nam not to be brought into blame for his folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well for you, if you be not brought into more than blame! Now, mark me\r\nwell! can you prove where you were that night of the murder, excellent\r\nStolo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! can I,\" answered the man boldly. \"I was with stout Balatro, the\r\nfisherman, helping to mend his nets until the fourth hour, and all his\r\nboys were present, helping us. And then we went to a cookshop to get some\r\nsupper in the ox forum, and thence at the sixth hour we passed across to\r\nLydia’s house in the Cyprian lane, and spent a merry hour or two carousing\r\nwith her jolly girls. Will that satisfy you, Lentulus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, if it can be proved,\" returned the Prætor. \"And you, Rufinus; can you\r\nalso show your whereabout that evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can,\" replied the fellow, \"for I was sick abed; and that my wife can\r\nshow, and Themison the druggist, who lives in the Sacred Way. For she went\r\nto get me an emetic at the third hour; and I was vomiting all night. A\r\npoor hand should I have made that night at murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far, then,\" replied Lentulus, \"you have cleared yourselves from\r\nsuspicion; but your charge on Arvina needs something more of confirmation,\r\nere I dare cite a Patrician to plead to such a crime! Have you got\r\nwitnesses? was any one in sight, when he spoke with you on the Minervium?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was one; but I know not if he will choose to speak of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\" exclaimed Lentulus, growing a little anxious on the subject,\r\nfor though he cared little enough about Arvina, he was yet unwilling to\r\nsee a Patrician arraigned for so small a matter, as was in his eyes the\r\nmurder of a mechanic.\r\n\r\n\"Why should he not speak? I warrant you I will find means to make him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my patron, Lentulus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your patron! man!\" he cried, much astonished. \"What, Catiline, here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Catiline it was! my Prætor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you consulted with him, ere you spoke with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so! most noble, for he would not admit us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, Sergius. Is this so? did you behold these fellows in deep converse\r\nwith Cæcilius Arvina, in the Minervium? But no! it must be folly! for what\r\nshould you have been doing there at sunrise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I prithee do not ask me, Lentulus,\" answered Catiline, with an air of\r\nwell feigned reluctance. \"I hate law suits and judicial inquiries, and I\r\nlove young Arvina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you did see them? Nay! nay! you must speak out. I do adjure you,\r\nCatiline, by all the Gods! were you, at sunrise, on the Cælian, and did\r\nyou see Arvina and these two?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was, at sunrise, on the Cælian; and I did see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And heard you what they said?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! but their faces were grave and earnest; and they seemed angry as they\r\nseparated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! In itself only, this were a little thing; but when it turns out that\r\nthe man _was_ slain that same night, the thing grows serious. You,\r\ntherefore, I shall detain here as witnesses, and partially suspected. Some\r\nof your slaves must guard them, Catiline, and I will send a lictor to cite\r\nPaullus, that he appear before me after the session at the Puteal Libonis.\r\nI am in haste. Farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Me! me! hear me! good Lentulus—hear me!\" exclaimed Chærea, springing\r\nforward, all vehemence and eagerness to speak, as it would seem, ere he\r\nshould be interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Chærea?\" cried Catiline, looking sternly at him, and shaking his finger,\r\n\"Remember!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" replied Chærea—\"no! no! I will not hold my peace! No! Catiline,\r\nyou may kill me, if you choose, but I will speak; to keep this secret any\r\nlonger would kill me, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it do not, I will,\" answered his master, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"This must not be, my Sergius,\" interposed Lentulus, \"let the man speak if\r\nhe have any light to throw on this mysterious business. Say on, my good\r\nfellow, and I will be your mediator with your master.\"\r\n\r\nThe freedman needed no more exhortation, but poured out a flood of eager,\r\nanxious narrative, as had been preconcerted between himself and Catiline,\r\nspeaking with so much vehemence, and displaying so much agitation in all\r\nhis air and gestures, that he entirely imposed his story upon Lentulus;\r\nand that Catiline had much difficulty in restraining a smile at the skill\r\nof the Greek.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! it is very clear,\" said Lentulus, \"he first slew the slave with his\r\nown hand, and then would have compassed—nay! I should rather say, _has_\r\ncompassed—Volero’s slaughter, who must some how or other have become privy\r\nto the deed. I must have these detained, and him arrested! There can be no\r\ndoubt of his guilt, and the people will be, I think, disposed to make an\r\nexample; there have of late been many cases of assassination!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were left alone, Lentulus looked steadily into the face of\r\nhis fellow-conspirator for a moment, and then burst into a hoarse laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Why all this mummery, my Sergius?\" he added, as soon as he had ceased\r\nfrom laughing, \"Or wherefore would you have mystified me too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have wished to see whether the evidence was like to seem valid to\r\nthe Judices, from its effect upon the Prætor!\" answered the other.\r\n\r\n\"And are you satisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be so, my Sergius, for, of a truth, until Chærea swore as he did\r\ntouching Medon, I was myself deceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe, then, that this will be sufficient to secure his\r\ncondemnation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond doubt. He will be interdicted fire and water, if these men stick\r\nto their oaths only. It would be well, perhaps, to convict one of Arvina’s\r\nslaves of the actual death of Volero. That might be done easily enough,\r\nbut there must be care taken, that you select one who shall not be able to\r\nprove any alibi. But wherefore are you so bent on destroying this youth,\r\nand by the law, too, which is ever both perilous and uncertain?\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows too much, to live without endangering others.\"\r\n\r\n\"What knows he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who slew Medon—Who slew Volero—What we propose to do, ere long, in the\r\nCampus!\" answered Catiline, steadily.\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods?\" cried Lentulus, turning very pale, and remaining silent\r\nfor some moments. After which he said, with a thoughtful manner, \"it would\r\nbe better to get rid of him quietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That has been tried too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"It failed! He is now on his guard. He is brave, strong, wary. It cannot\r\nbe done, save thus.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will denounce us. He will declare the whole, ere we can spring the\r\nmine beneath him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! he will not; he dares not. He is bound by oaths which—\"\r\n\r\n\"Oaths!\" interrupted Lentulus, with a sneer, and in tones of contemptuous\r\nridicule. \"What are oaths? Did they ever bind you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not recollect,\" answered Catiline; \"perhaps they did, when I was a\r\nboy, and believed in Lemures and Lamia. But Paullus Arvina is not Lucius\r\nCatiline, nor yet Cornelius Lentulus; and I say that his oaths shall bind\r\nhim, until—\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say, they shall not!\" A clear high voice interrupted him, coming,\r\napparently, through the wall of the chamber.\r\n\r\nLentulus started—his very lips were white, and his frame shook with\r\nagitation, if it were not with fear.\r\n\r\nCatiline grew pale likewise; but it was rage, not terror, that blanched\r\nhis swarthy brow. He dashed his hand upon the table—\r\n\r\n\"Furies of Hell!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the words were yet trembling on his lips, the door was thrown\r\nviolently open, the curtains which concealed it torn asunder, and, with\r\nher dark eyes gleaming a strange fire, and two hard crimson spots gleaming\r\nhigh up on her cheek bones—the hectic of fierce passion—her bosom\r\nthrobbing, and her whole frame dilated with anger and excitement, young\r\nLucia stood before them.\r\n\r\n\"And I say,\" she repeated, \"that they shall not bind him! By all the Gods!\r\nI swear it! By my own love! my own dishonor! I swear that they shall not!\r\nFool! fool! did you think to outwit me? To blind a woman, whose every fear\r\nand passion is an undying eye? Go to! go to! you shall not do it.\"\r\n\r\nAudacious, as he was, the traitor was surprised, almost daunted; and while\r\nLentulus, a little reassured, when he saw who was the interlocutor, gazed\r\non him in unmitigated wonder, he faltered out, in tones strangely\r\ndissimilar to his accustomed accents of indomitable pride and decision—\r\n\r\n\"You mistake, girl; you have not heard aright, if you have heard at all; I\r\nwould say, you are deceived, Lucia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then would you lie!\" she answered, \"for I am not deceived, though you\r\nwould fain deceive me! Not heard? not heard?\" she continued. \"Think you\r\nthe walls in the house of Catiline have no eyes nor ears?\" using the very\r\nwords which he had addressed to her lover; \"Lucius Catiline! I know all!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know all?\" exclaimed Lentulus, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"And will prevent all!\" replied the girl, firmly, \"if you dare cross my\r\npurposes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dare! dare!\" replied Catiline, who now, recovering from his momentary\r\nsurprise, had regained all his natural haughtiness and vigor. \"Who are\r\nyou, wanton, that dare talk to us of daring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wanton!\" replied the girl, turning fiery red. \"Ay! But who made me the\r\nwanton that I am? Who fed my youthful passions? Who sapped my youthful\r\nprinciples? Who reared me in an atmosphere, whose very breath was luxury,\r\nvoluptuousness, pollution, till every drop of my wholesome blood was\r\nturned to liquid flame? till every passion in my heart became a fettered\r\nearthquake? Fool! fool! you thought, in your impotence of crime, to make\r\nLucia Orestilla your instrument, your slave! You have made her your\r\nmistress! You dreamed, in your insolence of fancied wisdom, that, like the\r\nhunter-cat of the Persian despots, so long as you fed the wanton’s\r\nappetite, and basely pandered to her passions, she would leap hood-winked\r\non the prey you pointed her. Thou fool! that hast not half read thy\r\nvillain lesson! Thou shouldst have known that the very cat, thou\r\nthoughtest me, will turn and rend the huntsman if he dare rob her of her\r\nportion! I tell you, Lucius Catiline, you thought me a mere wanton! a mere\r\nsensual thing! a soulless animal voluptuary! Fool! I say, double fool!\r\nLook into thine own heart; remember what blood runs in these female veins!\r\nMan! Father! Vitiator! My spirit is not female! my blood, my passions, my\r\ncontempt of peril, my will indomitable and immutable, are, like my mortal\r\nbody, your begetting! My crimes, and my corruption, are your teaching!\r\nBeware then, as you know the heat of your own appetites, how you presume\r\nto hinder mine! Beware, as you know your own recklessness in doing and\r\ncontempt in suffering, how you stir me, your child, to do and suffer\r\nlikewise! Beware, as you know the extent of your own crimes, the depth of\r\nyour own pollution, how you drive me, your pupil, to out-do her master!\r\nBeware! I say! beware! This man is mine. Harm but one hair upon his head,\r\nand you shall die, like a dog, with the dogs who snarl at your bidding,\r\nand your name perish with you. I have spoken!\"\r\n\r\nThere needed not one tenth part of the wisdom, which the arch-traitor\r\nreally possessed, to shew him how much he had miscalculated the range of\r\nhis daughter’s intellect; the fierce energies of her powerful but\r\nmisdirected mind.\r\n\r\nHe felt, for a moment, as the daring archimage whose spells, too potent\r\nfor their master’s safety, have evoked and unchained a spirit that defies\r\ntheir guidance. But, like that archimage, conscious that all depends on\r\nthe exertion of his wonted empire, he struggled hard to regain his lost\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\"Girl,\" he replied, in those firm deep tones of grave authority, which he\r\ndeemed the best calculated to control her excitement, \"You are mad! Mad,\r\nand ungrateful; and like a frantic dog would turn and rend the hand that\r\nfeeds you, for a shadow. I never thought of making you an instrument; fool\r\nindeed had I been, to think I could hoodwink such an intellect as yours!\r\nIf I have striven to clear away the mists of prejudice from before your\r\neyes, which, in your senseless anger, you now call corrupting you, it was\r\nbecause I saw in you a kindred spirit to mine own, capable to soar\r\nfearless and undazzled into the very noon of reason. If I have taught you\r\nto indulge your passions, opened a universe of pleasures to your ken, it\r\nwas that I saw in you a woman of mind so manly, that all the weaknesses,\r\nwhich fools call affections, would be but powerless to warp it from its\r\npurpose. I would have made you\"—\r\n\r\n\"The world’s scorn!\" she interrupted him, bitterly; but he went on,\r\nwithout noticing the interruption—\r\n\r\n\"The equal of myself in intellect, in energy, and wisdom; else how had you\r\ndared to brave me thus, whom never man yet braved and lived to boast of\r\nit! And now for a mere girlish fancy, a weak feminine caprice for a man,\r\nwho cares not for you; who has betrayed you; who, idiot and inconsistent\r\nthat he is, fresh from your fiery kisses, was whimpering within an hour at\r\nthe feet of his cold Julia; who has, I doubt not, boasted of your favors,\r\nwhile he deplored his own infatuation, to her, his promised wife!—For a\r\nfond frivolous liking of a moment, you would forego gratification, rank,\r\ngreatness, power, and vengeance! Is this just toward me, wise toward\r\nyourself? Is this like Lucia Orestilla? You would preserve a traitor who\r\ndeserts you, nay, scorns you in his easy triumph! You would destroy all\r\nthose who love you; you would destroy yourself, to make the traitor and\r\nhis minion happy! Awake! awake, my Lucia, from this soft foolish fancy!\r\nAwake, and be yourself once more! Awake to wisdom, to ambition, to\r\nrevenge!\"\r\n\r\nHis words were spirited and fiery; but they struck on no kindred chord in\r\nthe bosom of his daughter. On the contrary, the spark had faded from her\r\neye and the flush from her cheek, and her looks were dispirited and\r\ndowncast. But as he ceased, she raised her eye and met his piercing gaze\r\nfirmly, and replied in a sorrowful yet resolute tone.\r\n\r\n\"Eloquent! aye! you are eloquent! Catiline, would I had never learned it\r\nto my cost; but it is too late now! it is all too late! for the rest, I am\r\nawake; and so far, at least, am wise, that I perceive the folly of the\r\npast, and decipher clearly the sophistry of your false teaching. As for\r\nthe future, hope is dead, and ambition. Revenge, I seek not; if I did so,\r\nthou art there, on whom to wreak it; for saving thou, and myself only,\r\nnone have wronged me. More words are needless. See that thou lay aside thy\r\nplans, and dare not to harm him, or her. He shall not betray thee or\r\nthine; for that will I be his surety and hostage! Injure them, by deed or\r\nby word, and, one and all, you perish! I ask no promise of you—promises\r\nbind you not!—but let fear bind you, for _I_ promise _you_, and be sure\r\nthat my plight will be kept!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can this be Lucia Orestilla?\" exclaimed Catiline, \"this puling love-sick\r\ngirl, this timorous, repentant—I had nearly called thee—maiden! Why, thou\r\nfool, what would’st thou with the man farther? Dost think to be his wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wife!\" cried the wretched girl, clasping her hands together, and looking\r\npiteously in her destroyer’s face. \"Wife! wife! and me!—alas! alas! that\r\nholy, that dear, honored name!—Never! never for me the sweet sacred rites!\r\nNever for me the pure chaste kiss, the seat by the happy hearth, the\r\nloving children at the knee, the proud approving smile of—Oh! ye gods! ye\r\njust gods!—a loved and loving husband!—Wife! wife!\" she continued, lashing\r\nherself, as she proceeded, into fresh anger; \"there is not in the gaols of\r\nRome the slave so base as to call Lucia Orestilla wife! And wherefore,\r\nwherefore not?—Man! man! if that thou be a man, and not a demon, but for\r\nthee, and thy cursed teachings, I might have known all this—pure bliss,\r\nand conscious rectitude, and the respect and love of men. I might have\r\nbeen the happy bride of an honorable suitor, the cherished matron of a\r\nrespected lord, the proud glad mother of children, that should not have\r\nblushed to be sprung from the wanton Lucia! Thou! it is thou, thou only\r\nthat hast done all this!—And why, I say, why should I not revenge? Beware!\r\ntempt me no farther! Do my bidding! Thou slave, that thought’st but now to\r\nbe the master, obey my bidding to the letter!\" And she stamped her foot on\r\nthe ground, with the imperious air of a despotic queen. And in truth,\r\ncrest-fallen and heavy in spirit, were the proud men whom she so superbly\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at them contemptuously for a moment, and then, shaking her fore\r\nfinger menacingly, \"I leave ye,\" she said, \"I leave ye, but imagine not,\r\nthat I read not your councils. Me, you cannot deceive. With yourselves\r\nonly it remains to succeed or to perish. For if ye dare to disobey me, the\r\ngods themselves shall not preserve you from my vengeance!\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear you not, my girl,\" cried Catiline, \"for all that you are now mad\r\nwith disappointment, and with anger. So you may go, and listen if you\r\nwill,\" he added, pointing to the secret aperture concealed in the\r\nmouldings of the wall. \"We shall not speak the less freely for your\r\nhearing us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need to listen now,\" she answered, \"for I know everything\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every thing that we _have_ said, Lucia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything that you _will_ do, Sergius Catiline!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! and everything that I shall do, likewise!\" and with the word she\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n\"A perilous girl, by all the Gods!\" said Lentulus, in Greek, as she\r\ndisappeared. \"Will she do as she threatens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush!\" replied Catiline in Latin, \"she speaks Greek like an Athenian. I\r\nam not sure, however, that she could understand such jargon as that is.\r\nNo! she will do none of that. She is the cleverest and best girl living,\r\nonly a little passionate, for which I love her all the more dearly. No!\r\nshe will do none of that. Because she will not be alive, to do it, this\r\ntime to-morrow,\" he added, putting his mouth within half an inch of the\r\near of Lentulus, and speaking in the lowest whisper.\r\n\r\nLentulus, bold as he was and unscrupulous, started in horror at his words,\r\nand his lips were white as he faltered—\"Your own daughter, Lucius!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed the fierce conspirator, aloud; \"ha! ha! yes, she is my\r\nown daughter, in everything but beauty. She is the loveliest creature in\r\nall Rome! But we must yield, I suppose, to her wishes; the women rule us,\r\nafter all is said, and I suppose I was alarmed needlessly. Doubtless\r\nArvina will be silent. Come, I will walk with you so far on your way to\r\nthe Forum. What ho! Chærea, see that Rufinus and Stolo lack nothing. I\r\nwill speak with them, when I return home; and hark you in your ear. Suffer\r\nnot Lucia Orestilla to leave the house a moment; use force if it be\r\nneeded; but it will not. Tell her it is my orders, and watch her very\r\nclosely. Come, Lentulus, it is drawing toward noon.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the house without more words, and walked side by side in silence\r\nfor some distance, when Catiline said in a low voice, \"This is unpleasant,\r\nand may be dangerous. We must, however, trust to fortune till to-morrow,\r\nwhen my house shall be void of this pest. Then will we proceed, as we had\r\nproposed.\"\r\n\r\nLentulus looked at him doubtfully, and asked, with a quick shudder running\r\nthrough his limbs, as he spoke: \"And will you really?—\" and there he\r\npaused, unable to complete the question.\r\n\r\n\"Remove her?\" added Catiline, completing the sentence which he had left\r\nunfinished, \"Ay! will I. Just as I would a serpent from my path!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that done, what is to follow?\" Lentulus inquired, with an assumption\r\nof coolness, which in truth he did not feel.\r\n\r\n\"We will get rid of Arvina. And then, as it wants but four days of the\r\nelections, we may keep all things quiet till the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so!\" answered the other. \"When do we meet again to settle these\r\nthings finally?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, at the house of Læca, at the sixth hour of night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will all be there?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the most faithful; until then, farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they parted; Lentulus hurrying to the Forum, to take his seat on the\r\nprætor’s chair, and there preside in judgment—fit magistrate!—on men, the\r\nguiltiest of whom were pure as the spotless snow, when compared with his\r\nown conscious guilt; and Catiline to glide through dark streets, visiting\r\ndiscontented artizans, debauched mechanics, desperate gamblers, scattering\r\ndark and ambiguous promises, and stirring up that worthless rabble—who,\r\nwith all to gain and nothing to lose by civil strife and tumult, abound in\r\nall great cities—to violence and thirst of blood.\r\n\r\nThree or four hours at least he spent thus; and well satisfied with his\r\nprogress, delighted by the increasing turbulence of the fierce and\r\nirresponsible democracy, and rejoicing in having gained many new and\r\nfitting converts to his creed, he returned homeward, ripe for fresh\r\nvillainy. Chærea met him on the threshold, with his face pale and haggard\r\nfrom excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Catiline,\" he exclaimed, \"she had gone forth already, before you bade me\r\nwatch her!\"\r\n\r\n\"She!—Who, slave? who?\" and knowing perfectly who was meant, yet hoping,\r\nin his desperation, that he heard not aright, he caught the freedman by\r\nthe throat, and shook him furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Lucia Orestilla,\" faltered the trembling menial.\r\n\r\n\"And has not returned?\" thundered the traitor.\r\n\r\n\"Catiline, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Liar! and fool!\" cried the other, gnashing his teeth with rage, as he\r\ngave way to his ungovernable fury, and hurling him with all his might\r\nagainst the marble door-post.\r\n\r\nThe freedman fell, like a dead man, with the blood gushing from his nose\r\nand mouth; and Catiline, striding across the prostrate body, retired\r\nsullenly and slowly to muse on the disappointment of this his most\r\natrocious project, in the darkness and solitude of his own private chamber\r\nwhither none dared intrude unsummoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n        And, for that right is right, to follow right\r\n        Were wisdom, in the scorn of consequence.\r\n                    TENNYSON. ŒNONE.\r\n\r\nPaullus Arvina sat alone in a small chamber of his own house. Books were\r\nbefore him, his favorites; the authors, whose words struck chords the most\r\nkindred in his soul; but though his eye rested on the fair manuscripts, it\r\nwas evident that his mind was absent. The slender preparations for the\r\nfirst Roman meal were displayed temptingly on a board, not far from his\r\nelbow; but they were all untouched. His hair was dishevelled; his face\r\npale, either from watching or excitement; and his eye wild and haggard. He\r\nwore a loose morning gown of colored linen, and his bare feet were thrust\r\ncarelessly into unmatched slippers.\r\n\r\nIt was past noon already; nor, though his favorite freedman Thrasea had\r\nwarned him several times of the lateness of the hour, had he shewn the\r\nleast willingness to exert himself, so far even as to dress his hair, or\r\nput on attire befitting the business of the day.\r\n\r\nIt could not but be seen, at a glance, that he was ill at ease; and in\r\ntruth he was much perturbed by what had passed on the preceding night, and\r\nvery anxious with regard to the future.\r\n\r\nNor was it without ample cause that he was restless and disturbed; within\r\nthe last three days he had by his own instability of purpose, and\r\nvacillating tastes and temper brought himself down from as enviable a\r\nposition as well can be imagined, to one as insecure, unfortunate, and\r\nperilous.\r\n\r\nThat he had made to himself in Catiline an enemy, as deadly, as\r\npersevering, as relentless as any man could have upon his track; an enemy\r\nagainst whom force and fraud would most likely be proved equally\r\nunavailing, he entertained no doubt. But brave as he was, and fearless,\r\nboth by principle and practice, he cared less for this, even while he\r\nconfessed to himself, that he must be on his guard now alway against both\r\nopen violence and secret murder, than he did for the bitter feeling, that\r\nhe was distrusted; that he had brought himself into suspicion and ill-odor\r\nwith the great man, in whose eyes he would have given so much to stand\r\nfairly, and whose good-will, and good opinion, but two little days before,\r\nhe flattered himself that he had conciliated by his manly conduct.\r\n\r\nAgain, when he thought of Julia, there was no balm to his heart, no\r\nunction to his wounded conscience! What if she knew not, nor suspected\r\nanything of his disloyalty, did not he know it, feel it in every nerve?\r\nDid he not read tacit reproaches in every beam of her deep tranquil eye?\r\nDid he not fancy some allusion to it, in every tone of her low sweet\r\nvoice? Did he not tremble at every air of heaven, lest it should waft the\r\nrumor of his infidelity to the chaste ears of her, whom alone he loved and\r\nhonored? Did he not know that one whisper of that disgraceful truth would\r\nbreak off, and forever, the dear hopes, on which all his future happiness\r\ndepended? And was it not most possible, most probable, that any moment\r\nmight reveal to her the fatal tidings?—The rage of Catiline, frustrated in\r\nhis foul designs, the revengeful jealousy of Lucia, the vigilance of the\r\ndistrustful consul, might each or all at any moment bring to light that\r\nwhich he would have given all but life to bury in oblivion.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he had sat musing deeply on the perils of his false\r\nposition, but though he had taxed every energy, and strained every faculty\r\nto devise some means by which to extricate himself from the toils, into\r\nwhich he had so blindly rushed, he could think of no scheme, resolve upon\r\nno course of action, which should set him at liberty, as he had been\r\nbefore his unlucky interview with the conspirator.\r\n\r\nAt times he dreamed of casting himself at the feet of Cicero, and\r\nconfessing to that great and generous statesman all his temptations, all\r\nhis trials, all his errors; of linking himself heart and soul with the\r\ndetermined patriots, who were prepared to live or die with the\r\nconstitution, and the liberties of the republic; but the oath!—the awful\r\nimprecation, by which he had bound himself, by which he had devoted all\r\nthat he loved to the Infernal Gods, recurred to his mind, and shook it\r\nwith an earth-quake’s power. And he, the bold free thinker, the daring and\r\nunflinching soldier, bound hand and foot by a silly superstition,\r\ntrembled—aye, trembled, and confessed to his secret soul that there was\r\none thing which he ought to do, yet dared not!\r\n\r\nAnon, maddened by the apparent hopelessness of ever being able to recur to\r\nthe straight road; of ever more regaining his own self-esteem, or the\r\nrespect of virtuous citizens—forced, as he seemed to be, to play a neutral\r\npart—the meanest of all parts—in the impending struggle—of ever gaining\r\neminence or fame under the banners of the commonwealth; he dreamed of\r\ngiving himself up, as fate appeared to have given him already up, to the\r\ndesigns of Catiline! He pictured to himself rank, station, power, wealth,\r\nto be won under the ensigns of revolt; and asked himself, as many a\r\nself-deluded slave of passion has asked himself before, if eminence,\r\nhowever won, be not glory; if success in the world’s eyes be not fame, and\r\nrectitude and excellence.\r\n\r\nBut patriotism, the old Roman virtue, clear and undying in the hardest and\r\nmost corrupt hearts, roused itself in him to do battle with the juggling\r\nfiends tempting him to his ruin; and whenever patriotism half-defeated\r\nappeared to yield the ground, the image of his Julia—his Julia, never to\r\nbe won by any indirection, never to be deceived by any sophistry, never to\r\nbe deluded into smiling for one moment on a traitor—rose clear and\r\npalpable before him and the mists were dispersed instantly, and the foes\r\nof his better judgment scattered to the winds and routed.\r\n\r\nThus wavering, he sat, infirm of purpose, ungoverned—whence indeed all his\r\nerrors—by any principle or unity of action; when suddenly the sound of a\r\nfaint and hesitating knock of the bronze ring on the outer door reached\r\nhis ear. The chamber, which he occupied, was far removed from the\r\nvestibule, divided from it by the whole length of the atrium, and fauces;\r\nyet so still was the interior of the house, and so inordinately sharpened\r\nwas his sense of hearing by anxiety and apprehension, that he recognized\r\nthe sound instantly, and started to his feet, fearing he knew not what.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of the slave, though he hurried to undo the door, seemed to\r\nthe eager listener as slow as the pace of the dull tortoise; and the short\r\npause, which followed after the door had been opened, he fancied to be an\r\nhour in duration. Long as he thought it, however, it was too short to\r\nenable him to conquer his agitation, or to control the tumultuous beating\r\nof his heart, which increased to such a degree, as he heard the freedman\r\nushering the new comer toward the room in which he was sitting, that he\r\ngrew very faint, and turned as pale as ashes.\r\n\r\nHad he been asked what it was that he apprehended, he could assuredly have\r\nassigned no reasonable cause to his tremors. Yet this man was as brave, as\r\nelastic in temperament, as tried steel. Oppose him to any definite and\r\nreal peril, not a nerve in his frame would quiver; yet here he was, by\r\nimaginary terrors, and the disquietude of an uneasy conscience, reduced to\r\nmore than woman’s weakness.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened, and Thrasea appeared alone upon the threshold, with a\r\nmysterious expression on his blunt features.\r\n\r\n\"How now?\" asked Paullus, \"what is this?—Did I not tell you, that I would\r\nnot be disturbed this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! master,\" answered the sturdy freedman; \"but she said that it was a\r\nmatter of great moment, and that she would—\"\r\n\r\n\"_She!_—Who?\" exclaimed Arvina, starting up from the chair, which he had\r\nresumed as his servant entered. \"Whom do you mean by _She_?\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl who waits in the tablinum, to know if you will receive her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl!—what girl? do you know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, master, she is very tall, and slender, yet round withal and\r\nbeautifully formed. Her steps are as light as the doe’s upon the Hæmus,\r\nand as graceful. She has the finest foot and ancle mine eyes ever looked\r\nupon. I am sure too that her face is beautiful, though she is closely\r\nwrapped in a long white veil. Her voice, though exquisitely sweet and\r\ngentle, is full of a strange command, half proud and half persuasive. I\r\ncould not, for my life, resist her bidding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! well! admit her, though I would fain be spared the trouble. I doubt\r\nnot it is some soft votary of Flora; and I am not in the vein for such\r\ndalliance now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Paullus, no! it is a Patrician lady. I will wager my freedom on it,\r\nalthough she is dressed plainly, and, as I told you, closely veiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Julia? by the Gods! it is not Julia Serena?\" exclaimed the young man,\r\nin tones of inquiry, blent with wonder.\r\n\r\nBut, as he spoke, the door was opened once more; and the veiled figure\r\nentered, realizing by her appearance all the good freedman’s eulogies. It\r\nseemed that she had overheard the last words of Arvina; for, without\r\nraising her veil, she said in a soft low voice, full of melancholy pathos,\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no, Paullus, it is not your Julia. But it is one, who has perhaps\r\nsome claim to your attention; and who, at all events, will not detain you\r\nlong, on matters most important to yourself. I have intruded thus, fearing\r\nyou were about to deny me; because that which I have to say will brook no\r\ndenial.\"\r\n\r\nThe freedman had withdrawn abruptly the very moment that the lady entered;\r\nand, closing the door firmly behind him, stood on guard out of earshot,\r\nlest any one should break upon his young lord’s privacy. But Paullus knew\r\nnot this; scarce knew, indeed, that they were alone; when, as she ceased,\r\nhe made two steps forward, exclaiming in a piercing voice—\r\n\r\n\"Ye Gods! ye Gods! Lucia Orestilla!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! Paul,\" replied the girl, raising her veil, and showing her beautiful\r\nface, no longer burning with bright amorous blushes, her large soft eyes,\r\nno longer beaming unchaste invitation, but pale, and quiet, and suffused\r\nwith tender sadness, \"it is indeed Lucia. But wherefore this surprise, I\r\nmight say this terror? You were not, I remember, so averse, the last time\r\nwe were alone together.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was steady, and her whole manner perfectly composed, as she\r\naddressed him. There was neither reproach nor irony in her tones, nor\r\nanything that betokened even the sense of injury endured. Yet was Arvina\r\nmore unmanned by her serene and tranquil bearing, than he would have been\r\nby the most violent reproaches.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas! what shall I say to you,\" he faltered, \"Lucia; Lucia, whom I\r\ndare not call mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say nothing, Paullus Arvina,\" she replied, \"thou art a noble and generous\r\nsoul?—Say nothing, for I know what thou would’st say. I have said it to\r\nmyself many times already. Oh! wo is me! too late! too late! But I have\r\ncome hither, now, upon a brief and a pleasant errand. For it _is_\r\npleasant, let them scoff who will! I say, it _is_ pleasant to do right,\r\nlet what may come of it. Would God, that I had always thought so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would God, indeed!\" answered the young man, \"then had we not both been\r\nwretched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretched! aye! most, most wretched!\" cried the girl, a large bright tear\r\nstanding in either eye. \"And art thou wretched, Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Utterly wretched!\" he said, with a deep groan, and buried his face for a\r\nmoment in his hands. \"Even before I looked upon you, thought of you, I was\r\nmiserable! and now, now—words cannot paint my anguish, my\r\nself-degradation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! is it so?\" she said, a faint sad smile flitting across her pallid\r\nlips. \"Why I should feel abased and self-degraded, I can well comprehend.\r\nI, who have fallen from the high estate, the purity, the wealth, the\r\nconsciousness of chaste and virtuous maidenhood! I, the despised, the\r\ncastaway, the fallen! But thou, thou!—from thee I looked but for\r\nreproaches—the just reproaches I have earned by my faithless folly! I\r\nthought, indeed, to have found you wretched, writhing in the dark bonds\r\nwhich I, most miserable, cast around you; and cursing her who fettered\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cursing myself,\" he answered, \"rather. Cursing my own insane and selfish\r\npassion, which alone trammelled me, which alone ruined one, better and\r\nbrighter fifty fold than I!—alas! alas! Lucia.\"\r\n\r\nAnd forgetful of all that he had heard to her disparagement from her bad\r\nfather’s lips, or, if he half remembered discrediting all in that moment\r\nof excitement, he flung himself at her feet, and grovelled like a crushed\r\nworm on the floor, in the degrading consciousness of guilt.\r\n\r\n\"Arise, arise for shame, young Arvina!\" she said. \"The ground, at a\r\nwoman’s feet, is no place for a man ever; least of all _such_ a woman’s.\r\nArise, and mark me, when I tell you that, which to tell you, only, I came\r\nhither. Arise, I say, and make me not scorn the man, whom I admire,\r\nwhom—wo is me! I love.\"\r\n\r\nPaullus regained his feet slowly, and abashed; it seemed that all the\r\npride and haughtiness of his character had given way at once. Mute and\r\nhumiliated, he sank into a chair, while she continued standing erect and\r\nself-sustained before him by conscious, though new, rectitude of purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Mark me, I say, Arvina, when I tell you, that you are as free as air from\r\nthe oath, with which I bound you. That wicked vow compels you only so long\r\nas I hold you pledged to its performance. Lo! it is nothing any more—for\r\nI, to whom alone of mortals you are bound, now and forever release you.\r\nThe Gods, above and below, whom you called to witness it, are witnesses no\r\nmore against you. For I annul it here; I give you back your plight. It is\r\nas though it never had been spoken!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? indeed? am I free?—Good, noble, generous, dear, Lucia, is it\r\ntrue? can it be? I am free, and at thy bidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Free as the winds of heaven, Paullus, that come whence no man knoweth,\r\nand go whither they will soever, and no mortal hindereth them! As free as\r\nthe winds, Paullus,\" she repeated, \"and I trust soon to be as happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore,\" added the young man, \"have you done this? You said you\r\nwould release me _never_, and now all unsolicited you come and say ’you\r\nare free, Paullus,’ almost before the breath is cold upon my lips that\r\nswore obedience. This is most singular, and inconsistent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the wide world _is_ consistent, Paullus, except virtue? That\r\nindeed is immutable, eternal, one, the same on earth as in heaven,\r\npresent, and past, and forever. But what else, I beseech you, is\r\nconsistent, or here or anywhere, that you should dream of finding me, a\r\nweak wild wanton girl, of firmer stuff than heroes? Are you, even in your\r\nown imagination, are you, I say, consistent?\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke eagerly, perhaps wildly; for the very part of self-denial, which\r\nshe was playing, stirred her mind to its lowest depths; and the great\r\nchange, which had been going on within for many hours, and was still in\r\npowerful progress, excited her fancy, and kindled all her strongest\r\nfeelings; and, as is not unfrequently the case, all the profound vague\r\nthoughts, which had so long lain mute and dormant, found light at once,\r\nand eloquent expression.\r\n\r\nPaullus gazed at her, in astonishment, almost in awe. Could this be the\r\nsensual, passionate voluptuary he had known two days since?—the strange,\r\nunprincipled, impulsive being, who yielded like the reed, to every gust of\r\npassion—this deep, clear, vigorous thinker! It was indeed a change to\r\npuzzle sager heads than that of Arvina! a transformation, sudden and\r\nbeautiful as that from the torpid earthy grub, to the swift-winged\r\netherial butterfly! He gazed at her, until she smiled in reply to his look\r\nof bewilderment; and then he met her smile with a sad heavy sigh, and\r\nanswered—\r\n\r\n\"Most inconsistent, I! alas! that I should say it, far worse than\r\ninconsistent, most false to truth and virtue, most recreant to honor! Have\r\nnot I, whose most ardent aspirations were set on glory virtuously won,\r\nwhose soul, as I fancied, was athirst for knowledge and for truth, have\r\nnot I bound myself by the most dire and dreadful oaths, to find my good in\r\nevil, my truth in a lie, my glory in black infamy?—Have not I, loving\r\nanother better than my own life, won thee to love, poor Lucia, and won\r\nthee by base falsehood to thy ruin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" she interrupted him, \"this last thing you have not done, Arvina.\r\nAwake! you shall deceive yourself no longer! Of this last wrong you are as\r\ninnocent as the unspotted snow; and I, I only, own the guilt, as I shall\r\nbear the punishment! Hear first, why I release you from your oath; and\r\nthen, if you care to listen to a sad tale, you shall know by what infamy\r\nof others, one, who might else have been both innocent and happy, has been\r\nmade infamous and foul and vile, and wretched; a thing hateful to herself,\r\nand loathsome to the world; a being with but one hope left, to expiate her\r\nmany crimes by one act of virtue, and then to die! to die young, very\r\nyoung, unwept, unhonored, friendless, and an orphan—aye! from her very\r\nbirth, more than an orphan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say on,\" replied the young man, \"say on, Lucia; and would to heaven you\r\ncould convince me that I have not wronged you. Say on, then; first, if you\r\nwill, why you have released me; but above all, speak of yourself—speak\r\nfreely, and oh! if I can aid, or protect, or comfort you, believe me I\r\nwill do it at my life’s utmost peril.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do believe you, Paullus. I did believe that, ere you spoke it. First,\r\nthen, I set you free—and free you are henceforth, forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you are betrayed. Because I know all that fell out last night.\r\nBecause I know darker villainy plotted against you, yet to come; villainy\r\nfrom which, tramelled by this oath, no earthly power can save you.\r\nBecause, I know not altogether why or how, my mind has been changed of\r\nlate completely, and I will lend myself no more to projects, which I\r\nloathe, and infamy which I abhor. Because—because—because, in a word, I\r\nlove you Paullus! Better than all I have, or hope to have on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must not,\" he replied, gravely yet tenderly, \"because\"——\r\n\r\n\"You love another,\" she interrupted him, very quickly, \"You love Julia\r\nSerena, Hortensia’s lovely daughter; and she loves you, and you are to be\r\nwedded soon. You see,\" she added, with a faint painful smile, \"that I know\r\neverything about you. I knew it long since; long, long before I gave\r\nmyself to you; even before I loved you, Paul—for I have loved you, also,\r\nlong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Loved me long!\" he exclaimed, in astonishment, \"how can that be, when you\r\nnever saw me until the day before yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! yes I have,\" she answered sadly. \"I have seen you and known you many\r\nyears; though you have forgotten me, if even, which I doubt, you ever\r\nnoticed me at all. But I can bring it to your mind. Have you forgotten\r\nhow, six summers since, as you were riding down the Collis Hortulorum, you\r\npassed a little girl weeping by the wayside?—\"\r\n\r\n\"Over a wounded kid? No, I remember very well. A great country boor had\r\nhurt it with a stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" exclaimed the girl, with her eyes flashing fire, \"you sprang\r\ndown from your horse, and chastised him, till he whined like a beaten\r\nhound, though he was twice as big as you were; and then you bound up the\r\nkid’s wound, and wiped away the tears—innocent tears they were—of the\r\nlittle girl, and parted her hair, and kissed her on the forehead. That\r\nlittle girl was I, and I have kept that kiss upon my brow, aye, and in my\r\nheart too! until now. No lips of man or woman have ever touched that spot\r\nwhich your lips hallowed. From that day forth I have loved you, I have\r\nadored you, Paullus. From that day forth I have watched all your ways,\r\nunseen and unsuspected. I have seen you do fifty kind, and generous, and\r\ngallant actions; but never saw you do one base, or tyrannous, or cowardly,\r\nor cruel—\"\r\n\r\n\"Until that fatal night!\" he said, with a deep groan. \"May the Gods pardon\r\nme! I never shall forgive my self.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no! I tell you, no!\" cried the girl, impetuously. \"I tell you, that I\r\nwas not deceived, if I fell; but I did not fall then! I knew that you\r\nloved Julia, years ago. I knew that I never could be yours in honor; and\r\nthat put fire and madness in my brain, and despair in my heart. And my\r\nhome was a hell, and those who should have been my guides and saviours\r\nwere my destroyers; and I am—_what I am_; but in that you had no share. On\r\nthat night, I but obeyed the accursed bidding of the blackest and most\r\natrocious monster that pollutes Jove’s pure air by his breath!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bidding,\" he exclaimed, starting back in horror, \"Catiline’s bidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father’s,\" answered the miserable girl. \"My own father’s bidding!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye gods! ye gods! His own daughter’s purity!\"\r\n\r\n\"Purity!\" she replied, with a smile of sad bitter irony. \"Do you think\r\npurity could long exist in the same house with Catiline and Orestilla?\r\nPaullus Arvina, the scenes I have beheld, the orgies I have shared, the\r\natmosphere of voluptuous sin I have breathed, almost from my cradle, had\r\nchanged the cold heart of the virgin huntress into the fiery pulses of the\r\nwanton Venus! Since I was ten years old, I have been, wo is me! familiar\r\nwith all luxury, all infamy, all degradation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Nemesis!\" he cried, turning up his indignant eyes toward heaven.\r\n\"But, in the name of all the Gods! wherefore, wherefore? Even to the\r\nworst, the most debased of wretches, their children’s honor is still\r\ndear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is dear to Catiline but riot, and debauchery, and murder! Sin,\r\nfor its own sake, even more than for the rewards its offers to its\r\nvotaries! Paullus, men called me beautiful! But what cared I for beauty,\r\nthat charmed all but him, whom alone I desired to fascinate? Men called me\r\nbeautiful, I say! and in my father’s sight that beauty became precious,\r\nwhen he foresaw that it might prove a means of winning followers to his\r\naccursed cause! Then was I educated in all arts, all graces, all\r\naccomplishments that might enhance my charms; and, as those fatal charms\r\ncould avail him nothing, so long as purity remained or virtue, I was\r\ntaught, ah! too easily! to esteem pleasure the sole good, passion the only\r\nguide! Taught thus, by my own parents! Curses, curses, and shame upon\r\nthem! Pity me, pity me, Paullus. Oh! you are bound to pity me! for had I\r\nnot loved you, fatally, desperately loved, and known that I could not win\r\nyou, perchance—perchance I had not fallen. Oh! pity me, and pardon——\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon you, Lucia,\" he interrupted her. \"What have you done to me, or who\r\nam I, that you should crave my pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I done? Do you ask in mockery? Have not I made you the partaker\r\nof my sin? Have not I lured you into falsehood, momentary falsehood it is\r\ntrue, yet still falsehood, to your Julia? Have I not tangled you in the\r\nnets of this most foul conspiracy? Betrayed you, a bound slave, to the\r\nmonster—the soul-destroyer?\"\r\n\r\nArvina groaned aloud, but made no answer, so deeply did his own thoughts\r\nafflict, so terribly did her strong words oppress him.\r\n\r\n\"But it is over—it is over now!\" She exclaimed exultingly. \"His reign of\r\nwickedness is over! The tool, which he moulded for his own purposes, shall\r\nbe the instrument to quell him. The pitfall which he would have digged in\r\nthe way of others, shall be to them a door whereby they shall escape his\r\ntreason, and his ruin. You are saved, my Arvina! By all the Gods! you are\r\nsaved! And, if it lost me once, it has preserved me now—my wild,\r\nunchangeable, and undying love for you, alone of men! For it has made me\r\nthink! Has quenched the insane flames that burned within me! Has given me\r\nnew views, new principles, new hopes! Evil no more shall be my good, nor\r\ninfamy my pride! If, myself, I am most unhappy, I will live henceforth,\r\nwhile I do live, to make others happy! I will live henceforth for two\r\nthings—revenge and retribution! By all the Gods! Julia and you, my\r\nPaullus, shall be happy! By all the Gods! he who destroyed me for his\r\npleasure, shall be destroyed in turn, for mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucia! think! think! he is your father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perish the monster! I have not—never had father, or home, or——Speak not\r\nto me; speak not of him, or I shall lose what poor remains of reason his\r\nvile plots have left me. Perish!—by all the powers of hell, he shall\r\nperish, miserably!—miserably! And you, you, Paullus, must be the weapon\r\nthat shall strike him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never the weapon in a daughter’s hand to strike a father,\" answered\r\nPaullus, \"no! though he were himself a parricide!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is!—he is a parricide!—the parricide of Rome itself!—the murderer of\r\nour common mother!—the sacrilegious stabber of his holy country! Hear me,\r\nand tremble! It lacks now two days of the Consular election. If Catiline\r\ngo not down ere that day cometh, then Rome goes down, on that day, and\r\nforever?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, girl, to say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, youth, if you discredit me. Do not I know? am not I the\r\nsharer? the tempter to the guilt myself? and am not I the mistress of its\r\nsecrets? Was it not for this, that I gave myself to you? was it not unto\r\nthis that I bound you by the oath, which now I restore to you? was it not\r\nby this, that I would have held you my minion and my paramour? And is it\r\nnot to reveal this, that I now have come? I tell you, I discovered, how he\r\nwould yesternight have slain you by the gladiator’s sword; discovered how\r\nhe now would slay you, by the perverted sword of Justice, as Medon’s, as\r\nVolero’s murderer; convicting you of his own crimes, as he hath many men\r\nbefore, by his suborned and perjured clients—his comrades on the Prætor’s\r\nchair! I tell you, I discovered but just now, that me too he will cut off\r\nin the flower of my youth; in the heat of the passions, he fomented; in\r\nthe rankness of the soft sins, he taught me—cut me off—me, his own ruined\r\nand polluted child—by the same poisoned chalice, which made his house\r\nclear for my wretched mother’s nuptials!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can these things be,\" cried Paullus, \"and the Gods yet withhold their\r\nthunder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I think,\" the girl answered wildly, \"that there are _no_ Gods,\r\nPaullus. Do you believe in Mars and Venus?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Gods, whose worship were adultery and murder?\" said Arvina. \"Not I,\r\nindeed, poor Lucia.\"\r\n\r\n\"If these be Gods, there is no truth, no meaning in the name of virtue. If\r\nnot these, what is God?\"\r\n\r\n\"All things!\" replied the young man solemnly. \"Whatever moves, whatever\r\n_is_, is God. The universe is but the body, that clothes his eternal\r\nspirit; the winds are his breath; the sunshine is his smile; the gentle\r\ndews are the tears of his compassion! Time is the creature of his hand,\r\neternity his dwelling place, virtue his law, his oracles the soul of every\r\nliving man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful,\" cried the girl. \"Beautiful, if it were but true!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true—as true, as the sun in heaven; as certain as his course\r\nthrough the changeless seasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? how?\" she asked eagerly. \"What makes it certain?\"\r\n\r\n\"The certainty of death!\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! death, death! that is a mystery indeed. And after that—\"\r\n\r\n\"Everlasting life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! do you believe that too? They tell me all that is a fable, a folly,\r\nand a falsehood!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perchance it would be well for them it were so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" she replied. \"Yes! But who taught you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plato! Immortal Plato!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! I will read him; I will read Plato.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! do you understand Greek too, Lucia?\"\r\n\r\n\"How else should I have sung Anacreon, and learned the Lesbian arts of\r\nSappho? But we have strayed wide of our subject, and time presses. Will\r\nyou denounce, me, Catiline?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I! I will perish sooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will do so, and all Rome with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prove that to me, and——But it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prove that to you, will you denounce him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will save Rome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you denounce him?\"\r\n\r\n\"If otherwise, I may preserve my country, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Otherwise, you cannot. Speak! will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must know all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall. Mark me, then judge.\" And rapidly, concisely, clearly, she\r\nrevealed to him the dread secret. She concealed nothing, neither the ends\r\nof the conspiracy, nor the names of the conspirators. She asseverated to\r\nhim the appalling fact, that half the noblest, eldest families of Rome,\r\nwere either active members of the plot, sworn to spare no man, or secret\r\nwell-wishers, content at first to remain neutral, and then to share the\r\nspoils of empire. According to her shewing, the Curii, the Portii, the\r\nSyllæ, the Cethegi, the great Cornelian house, the Vargunteii, the\r\nAutronii, and the Longini, were all for the most part implicated, although\r\nsome branches of the Portian and Cornelian houses had not been yet\r\napproached by the seducers. Crassus, she told him too, the richest citizen\r\nof Rome, and Caius Julius Cæsar, the most popular, awaited but the first\r\nsuccess to join the parricides of the Republic.\r\n\r\nHe listened thoughtfully, earnestly, until she had finished her narration,\r\nand then shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said, \"you must be deceived, poor Lucia. I do not see how\r\nthese things can be. These men, whom you have named, are all of the first\r\nhouses of the state; have all of them, either themselves or their\r\nforefathers, bled for the commonwealth. How then should they now wish to\r\ndestroy it? They are men, too, of all parties and all factions; the Syllæ,\r\nthe proudest and haughtiest aristocrats of Rome. Your father, also,\r\nbelonged to the Dictator’s faction, while the Cornelii and the Curii have\r\nbelonged ever to the tribunes’ party. How should this be? or how should\r\nthose whose pride, whose interest, whose power alike, rest on the\r\nmaintenance of their order, desire to mow down the Patrician houses, like\r\ngrass beneath the scythe, and give their honors to the rabble? How, above\r\nall, should Crassus, whose estate is worth seven thousand talents,(16)\r\nconsisting, too, of buildings in the heart of Rome, join with a party\r\nwhose watch-words are fire and plunder, partition of estates, and death to\r\nthe rich? You see yourself that these things cannot be; that they are not\r\nconsistent. You must have been deceived by their insolent and drunken\r\nboasting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Consistent!\" she replied, with vehement and angry irony. \"Still harping\r\non consistency! Are virtuous men then consistent, that you expect vicious\r\nmen to be so? Oh, the false wisdom, the false pride of man! You tell me\r\nthese things cannot be—perhaps they cannot; but they _are!_ I know it—I\r\nhave heard, seen, partaken all! But if you can be convinced only by seeing\r\nthat the plans of men, whose every action is insanity and frenzy, are wise\r\nand reasonable, perish yourself in your blindness, and let Rome perish\r\nwith you! I can no more. Farewell! I leave you to your madness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold! hold!\" he cried, moved greatly by her vehemence, \"are you indeed so\r\nsure of this? What, in the name of all the Gods, can be their motive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure! sure!\" she answered scornfully; \"I thought I was speaking to a\r\ncapable and clever man of action; I see that it is a mere dreamer, to\r\nwhose waking senses I appeal vainly. If _you_ be not sure, also, you must\r\nbe weaker than I can conceive. Why, if there was no plot, would Catiline\r\nhave slaughtered Medon, lest it should be revealed? Why would he, else,\r\nhave striven to bind you by oaths; and to what, if not to schemes of\r\nsacrilege and treason? Why would he else have murdered Volero? why planted\r\nambushes against your life? why would he now meditate my death, his own\r\nchild’s death, that I am forced to fly his house? Oh! in the wide world\r\nthere is no such folly, as that of the over wise! Motive—motive enough\r\nhave they! While the Patrician senate, and the Patrician Consuls hold with\r\nfirm hands the government, full well they know, that in vain violence or\r\nfraud may strive to wrest it from them. Let but the people hold the reins\r\nof empire, and the first smooth-tongued, slippery demagogue, the first\r\nbloody, conquering soldier, grasps them, and is the King, Dictator,\r\nEmperor, of Rome! Never yet in the history of nations, has despotism\r\nsprung out of oligarchic sway! Never yet has democracy but yielded to the\r\nfirst despot’s usurpation! _They_ have not read in vain the annals of past\r\nages, if you have done so, Paullus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, \"look they so far ahead? Ambition, then, it is but a\r\nnew form of ambition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you denounce them, Paullus?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least, I will warn the Consul!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must denounce them, or he will credit nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will save Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough! I am avenged, and thou shalt be happy. Go to the Consul,\r\nstraightway! make your own terms, ask office, rank, wealth, power. He will\r\ngrant all! and now, farewell! Me you will see no more forever! Farewell,\r\nPaullus Arvina, fare you well forever! And sometimes, when you are happy\r\nin the chaste arms of Julia, sometimes think, Paullus, of poor, unhappy,\r\nloving, lost, lost Lucia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither, by all the Gods, I adjure you! whither would you go, Lucia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far hence! far hence, my Paullus. Where I may live obscure in tranquil\r\nsolitude, where I may die when my time comes, in peace and innocence. In\r\nRome I were not safe an hour!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me where! tell me Lucia, how I may aid, how guard, console, or\r\ncounsel you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do none of these things, Paullus. All is arranged for the best.\r\nWithin an hour I shall be journeying hence, never to pass the gates, to\r\nhear the turbulent roar, to breathe the smoky skies, to taste the\r\nmaddening pleasures, of glorious, guilty Rome! There is but one thing you\r\ncan do, which will minister to my well-being—but one boon you can grant\r\nme. Will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you ask, Lucia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you swear?\" she inquired, with a faint melancholy smile. \"Nay! it\r\nconcerns no one but myself. You may swear safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, by the God of faith!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never seek, then, by word or deed, to learn whither I have gone, or where\r\nI dwell. Look! I am armed,\" and she drew out a dagger as she spoke. \"If I\r\nam tracked or followed, whether by friend or foe, this will free me from\r\npersecution; and it shall do so, by the living lights of heaven! This,\r\nafter all, is the one true, the last friend of the wretched. All hail to\r\nthee, healer of all intolerable anguish!\" and she kissed the bright blade,\r\nbefore she consigned it to the sheath; and then, stretching out both hands\r\nto Paullus, she cried, \"You have sworn—Remember!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you promise me,\" he replied, \"that, if at any time you need a friend,\r\na defender, one who would lay down life itself to aid you, you will call\r\non me, wheresoever I may be, fearless and undoubting. For, from the\r\nfestive board, or the nuptial bed, from the most sacred altar of the Gods,\r\nor from the solemn funeral pyre, I will come instant to thy bidding.\r\n’Lucia needs Paullus,’ shall be words shriller than the war-trumpet’s\r\nsummons to my conscious soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you,\" she said, \"willingly, most willingly. And now kiss me,\r\nPaullus. Julia herself would not forbid this last, sad, pious kiss! Not my\r\nlips! not my lips! Part my hair on my brows, and kiss me on the forehead,\r\nwhere your lips, years ago, shed freshness, and hope that has not yet died\r\nall away. Sweet, sweet! it is pure and sweet, it allays the fierce burning\r\nof my brain. Fare you well, Paul, and remember—remember Lucia Orestilla.\"\r\n\r\nShe withdrew herself from his arm modestly, as she spoke, lowered her\r\nveil, turned, and was gone. Many a day and week elapsed, and weeks were\r\nmerged in months, ere any one, who knew her, again saw Catiline’s unhappy,\r\nguilty daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n        I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus,\r\n        The whilst his iron did on anvil cool.\r\n                  KING JOHN.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of the sixteenth day before the calends of November,\r\nor, according to modern numeration, the eighteenth of October, the eve of\r\nthe consular elections, when a considerable number of rough hardy-looking\r\nmen were assembled beneath the wide low-browed arch of a blacksmith’s\r\nforge, situated near the intersection of the Cyprian Lane with the Sacred\r\nWay, and commanding a full view of the latter noble thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nIt was already fast growing dark, and the natural obscurity of the hour\r\nwas increased by the thickness of the lowering clouds, which overspread\r\nthe whole firmament of heaven, and seemed to portend a tempest. But from\r\nthe jaws of the semicircular arch of Roman brick, within which the group\r\nwas collected, a broad and wavering sheet of light was projected far into\r\nthe street, and over the fronts of the buildings opposite, rising and\r\nfalling in obedience to the blast of the huge bellows, which might be\r\nheard groaning and laboring within. The whole interior of the roomy vault\r\nwas filled with a lurid crimson light, diversified at times by a brighter\r\nand more vivid glare as a column of living flame would shoot up from the\r\nembers, or long trains of radiant sparks leap from the bounding anvil.\r\nAgainst this clear back ground the moving figures of the strong limbed\r\ngrimy giants, who plied their mighty sledges with incessant zeal on the\r\nred hot metal, were defined sharply and picturesquely; while alternately\r\nred lights and heavy shadows flickered across the forms and features of\r\nmany other men, who stood around watching the progress of the work, and\r\noccasionally speaking rapidly, and with a good deal of gesticulation, at\r\nintervals when the preponderant din of hammers ceased, and permitted\r\nconversation to be carried on audibly.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, there was no such pause; for the embers in the\r\nfurnace were at a white heat, and flashes of lambent flame were leaping\r\nout of the chimney top, and vanishing in the dark clouds overhead. A dozen\r\nbars of glowing steel had been drawn simultaneously from the charcoal, and\r\nthrice as many massive hammers were forging them into the rude shapes of\r\nweapons on the anvils, which, notwithstanding their vast weight, appeared\r\nto leap and reel, under the blows that were rained upon them faster than\r\nhail in winter.\r\n\r\nBut high above the roar of the blazing chimney, above the din of the\r\ngroaning stithy, high pealed the notes of a wild Alcaic ode, to which,\r\nchaunted by the stentorian voices of the powerful mechanics, the clanging\r\nsledges made a stormy but appropriate music. \"Strike, strike the iron,\"\r\nthus echoed the stirring strain,\r\n\r\n      Strike, strike the iron, children o’ Mulciber,\r\n      Hot from the charcoal cheerily glimmering!\r\n        Swing, swing, my boys, high swing the sledges!\r\n          Heave at it, heave at it, all! Together!\r\n      Great Mars, the war God, watches ye laboring\r\n      Joyously. Joyous watches the gleam o’ the\r\n        Bright sparkles, upsoaring the faster,\r\n          Faster as our merry blows revive them.\r\n      Well knoweth He that clang. It arouses him,\r\n      Heard far aloof! He laughs on us hammering\r\n        The sword, the clear harness of iron,\r\n          Armipotent paramour o’ Venus.——\r\n      Red glows the charcoal. Bend to the task, my boys,\r\n      Time flies apace, and speedily night cometh,\r\n        When we no more may ply the anvil;\r\n          Fate cometh eke, i’ the murky midnight.\r\n      Mark ye the pines, which rooted i’ rocky ground,(17)\r\n      Brave Euroclydon’s onset at evening.\r\n        Day dawns. The tree, which stood the tallest,\r\n          Preeminent i’ the leafy greenwood,\r\n      Now lies the lowest. Safely the arbutus,\r\n      Which bent before him, flourishes, and the sun\r\n        Wakens the thrush, which slept securely\r\n          Nestled in its emerald asylum.\r\n      So, when the war-shout peals i’ the noon o’ night,\r\n      Rousing the sleepers fearful, in ecstacy\r\n        When slaves avenge their wrongs, arising\r\n          Strong i’ the name o’ liberty new born,\r\n      When fury spares not beauty nor innocence,\r\n      First flame the grandest domes. I’ the massacre,\r\n        First fall the noblest. Lowly virtue\r\n          Haply the shade o’ poverty defends.\r\n      Forge then the broad sword. Quickly the night cometh,\r\n      When red the streets with gore o’ the mightiest\r\n        Shall fiercely flow, like Tiber in flood.\r\n          Rise then, avenger, the time it hath come!\r\n      Wake bloody tyrants from merry banquetting,\r\n      From downy couches, snowy-bosomed women\r\n        And ruby wine-cups, wake—The avenger\r\n          Springs to his arms, for the time it hath come!\r\n\r\nThe wild strain ceased, and with it the clang of the hammers, the bars of\r\nsteel being already beaten into the form of those short massive two-edged\r\nblades, which were the Roman’s national and all victorious weapon. But, as\r\nit ceased, a deep stern hum of approbation followed, elicited probably by\r\nsome real or fancied similitude between the imagery of the song, and the\r\ncircumstances of the auditors, who were to a man of the lowest order of\r\nplebeians, taught from their cradles to regard the nobles, and perhaps\r\nwith too much cause, as their natural enemies and oppressors. When the\r\nbrief applause was at an end, one of the elder bystanders addressed the\r\nprincipal workman, at the forge, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"You are incautious, Caius Crispus, to sing such songs as this, and at\r\nsuch a time, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush, Bassus,\" answered the other, \"it is you who are too timid. What\r\nharm is there, I should like to know, in singing an old Greek song done\r\ninto Latin words? I like the rumbling measure, for my part; it suits well\r\nwith the clash and clang of our rude trade. For the song, there is no\r\noffence in it; and, for the time, it is a very good time; and, to poor men\r\nlike us, a better time is coming!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! well said. May it be so!\" exclaimed several voices in reply to the\r\nstout smith’s sharp words.\r\n\r\nBut the old man was not so easily satisfied, for he answered at once. \"If\r\nany of the nobles heard it, they would soon find offence in it, my Caius!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the nobles—the nobles, and the Fathers! I am tired of hearing of the\r\nnobles. For my part, I do not see what makes them noble. Are they a whit\r\nstronger, or braver, or better man than I, or Marcus here, or any of us? I\r\ntrow not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wiser—they are at least wiser, Caius,\" said the old man once more, \"in\r\nthis, if in nothing else, that they keep their own councils, and stand by\r\ntheir own order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! in oppressing the poor!\" replied a new speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Right, Marcus,\" said a second; \"let them wrangle as much as they may with\r\none another, for their dice, their women, or their wine; in this at least\r\nthey all agree, in trampling down the poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a good time coming,\" replied the smith; \"and it is very near at\r\nhand. Now, Niger,\" he continued, addressing one of his workmen, \"carry\r\nthese blades down to the lower workshop; let Rufus fit them instantly with\r\nhorn handles; and then, see you to their grinding! Never heed polishing\r\nthem very much, but give them right keen edges, and good stabbing points.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" answered the other man to the first part of the smith’s\r\nspeech. \"I am not so sure of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don’t know what I mean,\" said Crispus, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I do—right well. But I am not so confident, as you are, in these new\r\nleaders.\"\r\n\r\nThe smith looked at him keenly for a moment, and then said significantly,\r\n\"_do_ you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! do I,\" said the other; and, a moment afterward, when the eyes of the\r\nbystanders were not directly fixed on him, he drew his hand edgewise\r\nacross his throat, with the action of one severing the windpipe.\r\n\r\nCaius Crispus nodded assent, but made a gesture of caution, glancing his\r\neye toward one or two of the company, and whispering a moment afterward,\r\n\"I am not sure of those fellows.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, I see; but they shall learn nothing from what I say.\" Then raising\r\nhis voice, he added, \"what I mean, Caius, is simply this, that I have no\r\nso very great faith in the promises of this Sergius Catiline, even if he\r\nshould be elected. He was a sworn friend to Sylla, the people’s worst\r\nenemy; and never had one associate of the old Marian party. Believe me, he\r\nonly wants our aid to set himself up on the horse of state authority; and\r\nwhen he is firm in the saddle, he will ride us down under the hoofs of\r\npatrician tyranny, as hard as any Cato, or Pompey, of them all.\"\r\n\r\nSix or seven of the foremost group, immediately about the anvil when this\r\ndiscourse was going on, interchanged quick glances, as the man used the\r\nword elected, on which he laid a strong and singular emphasis, and nodded\r\nslightly, as indicating that they understood his more secret meaning. All,\r\nhowever, except Crispus, the owner of the forge, seemed to be moved by\r\nwhat he advanced; and the foreman of the anvil, after musing for a moment,\r\nas he leaned on his heavy sledge, said, \"I believe you are right; no one\r\nbut a Plebeian can truly mean well, or be truly fitted for a leader to\r\nPlebeians.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are no wiser than Crispus,\" interposed the old man, who had spoken\r\nfirst, in a low angry whisper. \"Do you want to discourage these fellows\r\nfrom rising to the cry, when it shall be set up? If this be all that you\r\ncan do, it were as well to close the forge at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I shall do forthwith,\" said Caius Crispus; \"for I have got through\r\nmy work and my lads are weary; but do not you go away, my gossips; nor you\r\neither,\" he added, speaking to the man whom he had at first suspected,\r\n\"tarry you, under one pretext or other; we will have a cup of wine, as\r\nsoon as I have got rid of these fellows. Here, Aulus,\" turning to his\r\nforeman, \"take some coin out of my purse, there it hangs by my clean tunic\r\nin the corner, and go round to the wine shop, and bring thence a skinful\r\nof the best Sabine vintage; and some of you bar up the door, all but the\r\nlittle wicket. And now, my friends, good night; it is very late, and I am\r\ngoing to shut up the shop. Good night; and remember that the only hope of\r\nus working men lies in the election of Catiline tomorrow. Be in the Campus\r\nearly, with all your friends; and hark ye, you were best take your knives\r\nunder your tunics, lest the proud nobles should attempt to drive us from\r\nthe ballot.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will, we will!\" exclaimed several voices. \"We will not be cozened out\r\nof our votes, or bullied out of them either. But how is this? do not you\r\nvote in your class?\"\r\n\r\n\"I vote _with_ my class! with my fellow Plebeians and mechanics, I would\r\nsay! What if I be one of the armorers of the first class, think you that I\r\nwill vote with the proud senators and insolent knights? No, brethren, not\r\none of us, nor of the carpenters either, nor of the trumpeters, or\r\nhorn-blowers! Plebeians we are, and Plebeians we will vote! and let me\r\ntell you to look sharp to me, on the Campus; and whatever I do, so do ye.\r\nBe sure that good will come of it to the people!\"\r\n\r\n\"We will, we will!\" responded all his hearers, now unanimous. \"Brave\r\nheart! stout Caius Crispus! We will have you a tribune one of these days!\r\nbut good night, good night!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with the words, all left the forge, except the smith and his peculiar\r\nworkmen, and two or three others, all clients of the Prætor Lentulus, and\r\nall in some degree associates in the conspiracy. None of them, however,\r\nwere initiated fully, except Caius himself, his foreman, Aulus, the aged\r\nBassus, and the stranger; who, though unknown to any one present, had\r\ngiven satisfactory evidence that he was privy to the most atrocious\r\nportions of the plot. The wine was introduced immediately, and after a\r\ndeep draught, circulated more than once, the conversation was resumed by\r\nthe initiated, who were now left alone.\r\n\r\n\"And do you believe,\" said the stranger, addressing Caius Crispus, \"that\r\nCatiline and his companions have any real view to the redress of\r\ngrievances, the regeneration of the state, or the equalization of\r\nconditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least, I,\" answered the swordsmith. \"Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, in the name of all the Gods, why did you join with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because by the ruin of the great and noble, the poor must be gainers.\r\nBecause I owe what I can never pay. Because I lust for what I can never\r\nwin—luxury, beauty, wealth, and power! And if there come a civil strife,\r\nwith proscription, confiscation, massacre, it shall go hard with Caius\r\nCrispus, if he achieve not greatness!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" said the man, turning short round, without replying to the\r\nsmith, and addressing the aged Bassus, \"why did you join the plotters, you\r\nwho are so crafty, so sagacious, and yet so earnest in the cause?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have wrongs to avenge,\" answered the old man fiercely; a fiery\r\nflush crimsoning his sallow face, and his eye beaming lurid rage. \"Wrongs,\r\nto repay which all the blood that flows in patrician veins were but too\r\nsmall a price!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha?\" said the other, in a tone half meditative and half questioning, but\r\nin truth thinking little of the speaker, and reflecting only on the\r\npersonal nature of the motives, which seemed to instigate them all. \"Ha,\r\nis it indeed so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" cried the old conspirator, springing forward and catching him by\r\nthe arm. \"Have you a wife, a child, a sister? If so, listen! you can\r\nunderstand me! I am, as you see old, very old! I have scars, also, all in\r\nfront; honorable scars, of wounds inflicted by the Moorish assagays, of\r\nJugurtha’s desert horsemen—by the huge broad swords of the Teutones and\r\nCimbri. My son, my only son fell, as an eagle-bearer, in the front rank of\r\nthe hastati of the brave tenth legion—for we had wealth in those days, and\r\nboth fought and voted in the centuries of the first class. But our fields\r\nwere uncultivated, while we were shedding our best blood for the state;\r\nand to complete the ruin, my rural slaves broke loose, and joined\r\nSpartacus the gladiator. Taken, they died upon the cross; and I was quite\r\nundone. Law suits and usury ate up the rest; and, for these eight years\r\npast, old Bassus has been penniless, and often cold, and always hungry.\r\nBut if this had been all, it is a soldier’s part to bear cold and\r\nhunger—but not to bear disgrace. Man, there have been gyves on these\r\nlegs—the whip has scarred these shoulders! Ye great Gods! the whip! for\r\nwhat have the poor to do with their Portian or Valerian laws? Nor was this\r\nall—the eagle-bearer left a child, a sweet, fair, gentle girl, the image\r\nof my gallant boy, the only solace of my famishing old age. I told you she\r\nwas fair—fatally fair—too fair for a plebeian’s daughter, a plebeian’s\r\nwife! Her beauty caught the lustful eyes, inflamed the brutal heart of a\r\npatrician, one of the great Cornelii. It is enough! She was torn from my\r\nhouse, dishonored, and sent home, to die by her own hand, that would not\r\npardon that involuntary sin! She died; the censors heard the tale; and\r\nscoffed at the teller of it! and that Cornelius yet sits in the senate;\r\nthose censors who approved his guilt yet live—I say _live_! Is not that\r\ncause enough why I should join the plotters?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot answer, No!\" replied the other; \"and you, Aulus, what is your\r\nreason?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would win me a noble paramour. Hortensia’s Julia is very soft and\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at him steadily for a moment, and an expression of\r\ndisgust and horror crept over his bold face. \"Alas!\" he said at length,\r\nspeaking, it would seem, to himself rather than to the others, \"poor Rome!\r\nunhappy country!\"\r\n\r\nBut, as he spoke, the strong smith, whose suspicion would seem to have\r\nbeen excited, stepped forward and laid his hand upon the stranger’s\r\nshoulder. \"Look you,\" he said, \"master. None of us know you here, I think,\r\nand we should all of us be glad to know, both who you are, and, if indeed\r\nyou be of the faction, wherefore _you_ joined it, that you so closely\r\nscrutinize our motives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was a fool, Caius Crispus; because I believed that, for a great\r\nstake, Romans might yet forget _self_, base and sordid _self_, and act as\r\nbecomes patriots and men! Because I dreamed, smith, till morning light\r\ncame back, and I awakened, and—\"\r\n\r\n\"And the dream!\" asked the smith eagerly, grasping the handle of his heavy\r\nhammer firmly, and setting his teeth hard.\r\n\r\n\"Had vanished,\" replied the other calmly, and looking him full in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"Bar the door, Aulus,\" cried the smith, hastily. \"This fellow must die\r\nhere, or he will betray us,\" and he caught him by the throat, as he spoke,\r\nwith an iron grip, to prevent him from calling out or giving the alarm.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger, though not to be compared in bulk or muscular\r\nproportions with the gigantic artizan, shook off his grasp with\r\ncontemptuous ease, and answered with a scornful smile,\r\n\r\n\"Betray you!—tush, I am Fulvius Flaccus.\"\r\n\r\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of the smith, he could not have\r\nrecoiled with wilder wonder.\r\n\r\n\"What, Fulvius Flaccus, to whose great wrongs all injuries endured by us\r\nare but as flea-bites! Fulvius, the grandson of that Fulvius Flaccus,\r\nwho—\"\r\n\r\n\"Was murdered by Opimius, while striving for the liberties of Romans. But\r\nwhat is this! By Mars and Quirinus! there is something afoot without!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he uttered the words, he sprang to the wicket, which Aulus had not\r\nfastened, and gazed out earnestly into the darkness, through which the\r\nregular and steady tramp of men, advancing in ordered files, could now be\r\nheard distinctly.\r\n\r\nThe others were beside him in an instant, with terror and amazement on\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait, before the cause of their alarm became visible.\r\nIt was a band of some five hundred stout young men of the upper classes,\r\nwell armed with swords and the oblong bucklers of the legion, though\r\nwearing neither casque nor cuirass, led by a curule ædile, who was\r\naccompanied by ten or twelve of the equestrian order, completely armed,\r\nand preceded by his _apparitores_ or beadles, and half a dozen\r\ntorch-bearers.\r\n\r\nThese men passed swiftly on, in treble file, marching as fast as they\r\ncould down the Sacred Way, until they reached the intersection of the\r\nstreet of Apollo; by which they proceeded straight up the ascent of the\r\nPalatine, whereon they were soon lost to view, among the splendid edifices\r\nthat covered its slope and summit.\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods!\" cried Caius Crispus, \"This is exceedingly strange! An\r\narmed guard at this time of night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hist! here is something more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as old Bassus spoke, Antonius, the consul, who was supposed to be\r\nattached to the faction of Catiline, came down a bye-street, from the\r\nlower end of the Carinæ, preceded by his torch-bearers, and followed by a\r\nlictor(18) with his fasces. He was in full dress too, as one of the\r\npresiding magistrates of the senate, and bore in his hand his ivory\r\nsceptre, surmounted by an eagle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had passed the door of the forge, Crispus stepped out into\r\nthe street, motioning his guests to follow him, and desiring his foreman\r\nto lock the door.\r\n\r\n\"Let us follow the Consul, at a distance,\" he exclaimed, \"my Bassus; for,\r\nas our Fulvius says, there is assuredly something afoot; and it may be\r\nthat it shall be well for us to know it: Come, let us follow quickly.\"\r\n\r\nThey hurried onward, as he proposed; and keeping some twenty or thirty\r\npaces in the rear of the Consul’s train, soon reached the foot of the\r\nstreet of Apollo. At this point, however, Antonius paused with his lictor;\r\nfor, in the opposite direction coming up from the Cerolian place toward\r\nthe Forum, another line of torches might be seen flaming through the\r\ndarkness, and, even at that distance, the axe heads of the lictors were\r\nvisible, as they flashed out by fits in the red torch-light.\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods!\" whispered Bassus, \"it is the other consul, the new man\r\nfrom Arpinum. Believe me, my friends, this bodes no good to us! The Senate\r\nmust have been convoked suddenly—and lo! here come the fathers. Look,\r\nlook! this is stern Cato.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, almost as he said the words, a powerfully made and very noble looking\r\nman passed so near as to brush the person of the mechanic with the folds\r\nof his toga. His face, which was strongly marked, was stern certainly; but\r\nit was with the sternness of gravity and deep thought, coupled perhaps\r\nwith something of melancholy—for it might be that he despaired at times of\r\nman’s condition in this world, and of his prospects in the next—not of\r\nausterity or pride. His garb was plain in the extreme, and, although his\r\ntunic displayed the broad crimson facings, and his robe the passmenting of\r\nsenatorial rank, both were of the commonest materials, and the narrowest\r\nand most simple cut.\r\n\r\n\"Hail, noble Cato!\" said the mechanic, as the senator passed by; but his\r\nvoice faltered as he spoke, and there was something hollow and heartless\r\nin the tones, which conveyed the greeting.\r\n\r\nCato raised his eyes, which had been fixed on the ground in meditation,\r\nand perused the features of the speaker with a severe and scrutinizing\r\ngaze; and then, shaking his head sternly, as if dissatisfied with the\r\nresult of his observation, \"This is no time of night, sirrah smith,\" he\r\nsaid, \"for thee, or such as thou, to be abroad. Thy daily work done, thou\r\nshouldst be at home with thy wife and children, not seeking profligate\r\nadventures, or breeding foul sedition in the streets. Go home! go home!\r\nfor shame on thee! thou art known and marked.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the severe and virtuous noble strode onward, unattended he by any\r\ntorch-bearer, or freedman, and soon joined his worthy friend, the great\r\nLatin orator, who had come up, and having united his train to that of the\r\nother consul, was moving up the Palatine.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime senator after senator arrived, some alone, with their\r\nslaves or freedmen lighting them along the streets; others in groups of\r\ntwo or three, all hurrying toward the Palatine. The smith and his friends,\r\nwho had been at first the sole spectators of the shew, were now every\r\nmoment joined by more and more of the rabble, until a great concourse was\r\nassembled; through which the nobles had some difficulty in forcing their\r\nway toward the Temple of Apollo, in which their order was assembling,\r\nwherefore as yet they knew not.\r\n\r\nAt first the crowd was orderly enough, and quiet; but gradually beginning\r\nto ferment and grow warm, as it were by the closeness of its packing,\r\ncheers were heard, and loud acclamations, as any member of the popular\r\nfaction made his way through it; and groans and yells and even curses\r\nsucceeded, as any of the leaders of the aristocratic party strove to part\r\nits reluctant masses.\r\n\r\nAnd now a louder burst of acclamations, than any which had yet been heard,\r\nrang through the streets, causing the very roofs to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"What foolery have we here?\" said the smith very sullenly, who, though he\r\nresponded nothing to it, had by no means recovered from the rebuke of\r\nCato. \"Oh! yes! I see, I see,\" and he too added the power of his\r\nstentorian lungs to the clamor, as a young senator, splendidly dressed,\r\nand of an aspect that could not fail to attract attention, entered the\r\nlittle space, which had been kept open at the corner of the two streets,\r\nby the efforts of an ædile and his beadles, who had just arrived on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHe was not much, if at all, above the middle size, but admirably\r\nproportioned, whether for feats of agility and strength, or for the\r\nlighter graces of society. But it was his face more especially, and the\r\nmagnificent expression of his features, that first struck the beholder—the\r\nbroad imaginative brow, the keen large lustrous eye, pervading, clear,\r\nundazzled as the eagle’s, the bold Roman nose, the resolute curve of the\r\nclean-cut mouth, full of indomitable pride and matchless energy—all these\r\nbespoke at once the versatile and various genius of the great statesman,\r\norator, and captain, who was to be thereafter.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, although he was advancing toward middle age, and\r\nhad already shaken off some of the trammels which luxurious vice and\r\nheedless extravagance had cast around his young puissant intellect, he had\r\nachieved nothing either of fame or power. He had, it is true, given signs\r\nof rare intellect, but as yet they were signs only. Though his friends\r\nlooked forward confidently to the time, when they should see him the first\r\ncitizen of the republic; and it is more than possible, that in his own\r\nheart he contemplated even now the attainment of a more glorious, if more\r\nperilous elevation.\r\n\r\nThe locks of this noble looking personage, though not arranged in that\r\neffeminate fashion, which has been mentioned as characteristic of Cethegus\r\nand some others, were closely curled about his brow—for he, as yet,\r\nexhibited no tendency to that baldness, for which in after years he was\r\nremarkable—and reeked with the choicest perfumes. He wore the\r\ncrimson-bordered toga of his senatorial rank, but under it, as it waved\r\nloosely to and fro, might be observed the gaudy hues of a violet colored\r\nbanqueting dress, sprinkled with flowers of gold, as if he had been\r\ndisturbed from some festive board by the summons to council.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the crowd, from which loud rose the shout, following\r\nhim as he moved along—\"Hail, Caius Cæsar! long live the noble Cæsar!\"—his\r\nslaves scattered gold profusely among the multitude, who fought and\r\nscrambled for the glittering coin, still keeping up their clamorous\r\ngreeting; while the dispenser of the wasteful largesse appearing to know\r\nevery one, and to forget no face or name, even of the humblest, had a\r\nfamiliar smile and a cheery word for each citizen.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Bassus, my old hero!\" he exclaimed, \"it is long since thou hast been\r\nto visit me. That proves, I hope, that things go better now-a-days at\r\nhome. But come and see me, Bassus; I have something for thee to keep the\r\ncold from thy hearth, this freezing weather.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he paused not to receive an answer, but moved forward a step or two,\r\ntill his eye fell upon the swordsmith.\r\n\r\n\"What, Caius,\" he said, \"sturdy Caius, absent from his forge so early—but\r\nI forgot, I forgot! you are a politician, perhaps you can tell me why they\r\nhave roused me from the best cup of Massic I have tasted this ten years.\r\nWhat is the coil, Caius Crispus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! I know not,\" replied the mechanic, \"I was about to ask the same of\r\nyou, noble Cæsar!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the worst man living of whom to inquire,\" replied the patrician,\r\nwith a careless smile. \"I cannot even guess, unless perchance\"—but as he\r\nspoke, he discovered, standing beside the smith, the man who had called\r\nhimself Fulvius Flaccus, and interrupting himself instantly, he fixed a\r\nlong and piercing gaze upon him, and then exclaimed \"Ha! is it thou?\" with\r\nan expression of astonishment, not all unmixed with vexation.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he stepped close up to him, whispered a word into his ear,\r\nand hurried with an altered air up the steep street which scaled the\r\nPalatine.\r\n\r\nA minute or two afterward, Crispus turned to address this man, but he too\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nIn quick succession senator after senator now came up the gentle slope of\r\nthe Sacred Way, until almost all the distinguished men in Rome, whether\r\nfor good or for evil, had undergone the scrutiny of the group collected\r\naround Caius Crispus.\r\n\r\nBut it was not till among the last that Catiline strode by, gnawing his\r\nnether lip uneasily, with his wild sunken eyes glaring suspiciously about\r\nhim. He spoke to no one, until he came opposite the smith, on whom he\r\nfrowned darkly, exclaiming, \"What do you here? Go home, sirrah, go home!\"\r\nand as Caius dropped his bold eyes, crest-fallen and abashed, he added in\r\na lower tone, so that, save Bassus only, none of the crowd could hear him,\r\n\"Wait for me at my house. Evil is brewing!\"\r\n\r\nNot a word more was spoken. Crispus and the old man soon extricated\r\nthemselves from the throng and went their way; and in a little time\r\nafterward the multitude was dispersed, rather summarily, by a band of\r\narmed men under the Prætor Pomptinus, who cleared with very little\r\ndelicacy the confines of the Palatine, whereon it was announced that the\r\nsenate were now in secret session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCLOSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Maria montesque polliceri cæpit,\r\n        Minari interdum ferro, nisi obnoxia foret.\r\n                    SALLUST.\r\n\r\n            A woman, master.\r\n                LOVE’S LABOUR LOST.\r\n\r\nAmong all those of Senatorial rank—and they were very many—who were\r\nparticipants of the intended treason, one alone was absent from the\r\nassemblage of the Order on that eventful night.\r\n\r\nThe keen unquiet eye of the arch-traitor missed Curius from his place, as\r\nit ran over the known faces of the conspirators, on whom he reckoned for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nCurius was absent.\r\n\r\nNor did his absence, although it might well be, although indeed it _was_,\r\naccidental, diminish anything of Catiline’s anxiety. For, though he fully\r\nbelieved him trusty and faithful to the end, though he felt that the man\r\nwas linked to him indissolubly by the consciousness of common crimes, he\r\nknew him also to be no less vain than he was daring. And, while he had no\r\nfear of intentional betrayal, he apprehended the possibility of\r\ninvoluntary disclosures, that might be perilous, if not fatal, in the\r\npresent juncture.\r\n\r\nIt has been left on record of this Curius, by one who knew him well, and\r\nwas himself no mean judge of character, that he possessed not the faculty\r\nof concealing any thing he had heard, or even of dissembling his own\r\ncrimes; and Catiline was not one to overlook or mistake so palpable a\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nBut the truth was, that knowing his man thoroughly, he was aware that,\r\nwith the bane, he bore about with him, in some degree, its antidote. For\r\nso vast and absurd were his vain boastings, and so needless his\r\nexaggerations of his own recklessness, blood-thirstiness, and crime, that\r\nhitherto his vaporings had excited rather ridicule than fear.\r\n\r\nThe time was however coming, when they were to awaken distrust, and lead\r\nto disclosure.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly consistent with the audacity of Catiline—an audacity,\r\nwhich, though natural, stood him well in stead, as a mask to cover deep\r\ndesigns—that even now, when he felt himself to be more than suspected,\r\ninstead of avoiding notoriety, and shunning the companionship of his\r\nfellow traitors, he seemed to covet observation, and to display himself in\r\nconnection with his guilty partners, more openly than heretofore.\r\n\r\nBut neither Lentulus, nor Vargunteius, nor the Syllæ, nor any other of the\r\nplotters had seen Curius, or could inform him of his whereabout. And, ere\r\nthey separated for the night, amid the crash of the contending elements\r\nabove, and the roar of the turbulent populace below, doubt, and almost\r\ndismay, had sunk into the hearts of several the most daring, so far as\r\nmere mortal perils were to be encountered, but the most abject, when\r\nsuperstition was joined with conscious guilt to appal and confound them.\r\n\r\nCatiline left the others, and strode away homeward, more agitated and\r\nunquiet than his face or words, or anything in his demeanor, except his\r\nirregular pace, and fitful gestures indicated.\r\n\r\nDark curses quivered unspoken on his tongue—the pains of hell were in his\r\nheart already.\r\n\r\nHad he but known the whole, how would his fury have blazed out into\r\ninstant action.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when the Senate was so suddenly convoked on the\r\nPalatine, a woman of rare loveliness waited alone, in a rich and\r\nvoluptuous chamber of a house not far removed from the scene of those\r\ngrave deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe chamber, in which she reclined alone on a pile of soft cushions, might\r\nwell have been the shrine of that bland queen of love and pleasure, of\r\nwhom its fair tenant was indeed an assiduous votaress. For there was\r\nnothing, which could charm the senses, or lap the soul in luxurious and\r\neffeminate ease, that was not there displayed.\r\n\r\nThe walls glowed with the choicest specimens of the Italian pencil, and\r\nthe soft tones and harmonious colouring were well adapted to the subjects,\r\nwhich were the same in all—voluptuous and sensual love.\r\n\r\nHere Venus rose from the crisp-smiling waves, in a rich atmosphere of\r\nlight and beauty—there Leda toyed with the wreathed neck and ruffled\r\nplumage of the enamoured swan—in this compartment, Danaë lay warm and\r\nlanguid, impotent to resist the blended power of the God’s passion and his\r\ngold—in that, Ariadne clung delighted to the bosom of the rosy wine-God.\r\n\r\nThe very atmosphere of the apartment was redolent of the richest perfumes,\r\nwhich streamed from four censers of chased gold placed on a tall\r\ncandelabra of wrought bronze in the corners of the room. A bowl of stained\r\nglass on the table was filled with musk roses, the latest of the year; and\r\nseveral hyacinths in full bloom added their almost overpowering scent to\r\nthe aromatic odours of the burning incense.\r\n\r\nArmed chairs, with downy pillows, covered with choice embroidered cloths\r\nof Calabria, soft ottomans and easy couches, tables loaded with implements\r\nof female luxury, musical instruments, drawings, and splendidly\r\nilluminated rolls of the amatory bards and poetesses of the Egean islands,\r\ncompleted the picture of the boudoir of the Roman beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd on a couch piled with the Tyrian cushions, which yielded to the soft\r\nimpress of her lovely form, well worthy of the splendid luxury with which\r\nshe was surrounded, lay the unrivalled Fulvia, awaiting her expected\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nIf she was lovely in her rich attire, as she appeared at the board of\r\nCatiline, with jewels in her bosom, and her bright ringlets of luxuriant\r\ngold braided in fair array, far lovelier was she now, as she lay there\r\nreclined, with those bright ringlets all dishevelled, and falling in a\r\nflood of wavy silken masses, over her snowy shoulders, and palpitating\r\nbosom; with all the undulating outlines of her superb form, unadorned, and\r\nbut scantily concealed by a loose robe of snow-white linen.\r\n\r\nHer face was slightly flushed with a soft carnation tinge, her blue eyes\r\ngleamed with unusual brightness. And by the fluttering of her bosom, and\r\nthe nervous quivering of her slender fingers, as they leaned on a tripod\r\nof Parian marble which stood beside the couch, it was evident that she was\r\nlabouring under some violent excitement.\r\n\r\n\"He comes not,\" she said. \"And it is waxing late. He has again failed me!\r\nand if he have—ruin—ruin!—Debts pressing me in every quarter, and no hope\r\nbut from him. Alfenus the usurer will lend no more—my farms all mortgaged\r\nto the utmost, a hundred thousand sesterces of interest, due these last\r\nCalends, and unpaid as yet. What can I do?—what hope for? In him there is\r\nno help—none! Nay! It is vain to think of it; for he is amorous as ever,\r\nand, could he raise the money, would lavish millions on me for one kiss.\r\nNo! _he_ is bankrupt too; and all his promises are but wild empty\r\nboastings. What, then, is left to me?\" she cried aloud, in the intensity\r\nof her perturbation. \"Most miserable me! My creditors will seize on\r\nall—all—all! and poverty—hard, chilling, bitter poverty, is staring in my\r\nface even now. Ye Gods! ye Gods! And I can not—can not live poor. No more\r\nrich dainties, and rare wines! no downy couches and soft perfumes! No\r\nmusic to induce voluptuous slumbers! no fairy-fingered slaves to fan the\r\nlanguid brow into luxurious coolness! No revelry, no mirth, no pleasure!\r\nPleasure that is so sweet, so enthralling! Pleasure for which I have lived\r\nonly, without which I must die! _Die_! By the great Gods! I _will_ die!\r\nWhat avails life, when all its joys are gone? Or what is death, but one\r\nmomentary pang, and then—quiet? Yes! I will die. And the world shall learn\r\nthat the soft Epicurean can vie with the cold Stoic in carelessness of\r\nliving, and contempt of death—that the warm votaress of Aphrodite can\r\nspend her glowing life-blood as prodigally as the stern follower of\r\nVirtue! Lucretia died, and was counted great and noble, because she cared\r\nnot to survive her honour! Fulvia will perish, wiser, as soon as she shall\r\nhave outlived her capacity for pleasure!\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke enthusiastically, her bright eyes flashing a strange fire, and\r\nher white bosom panting with the strong and passionate excitement; but in\r\na moment her mood was changed. A smile, as if at her own vehemence, curled\r\nher lip; her glance lost its quick, sharp wildness. She clapped her hands\r\ntogether, and called aloud,\r\n\r\n\"Ho! Ægle! Ægle!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the call a beautiful Greek girl entered the chamber, voluptuous as\r\nher mistress in carriage and demeanor, and all too slightly robed for\r\nmodesty, in garments that displayed far more than they concealed of her\r\nrare symmetry.\r\n\r\n\"Bring wine, my girl,\" cried Fulvia; \"the richest Massic; and, hark thee,\r\nfetch thy lyre. My soul is dark to-night, and craves a joyous note to\r\nkindle it to life and rapture.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl bowed and retired; but in a minute or two returned, accompanied\r\nby a dark-eyed Ionian, bearing a Tuscan flask of the choice wine, and a\r\ngoblet of crystal, embossed with emeralds and sapphires, imbedded, by a\r\nprocess known to the ancients but now lost, in the transparent glass.\r\n\r\nA lyre of tortoiseshell was in the hands of Ægle, and a golden plectrum\r\nwith which to strike its chords; she had cast loose her abundant tresses\r\nof dark hair, and decked her brows with a coronal of myrtle mixed with\r\nroses, and as she came bounding with sinuous and graceful gestures through\r\nthe door, waving her white arms with the dazzling instruments aloft, she\r\nmight have represented well a young priestess of the Cyprian queen, or the\r\nlight Muse of amorous song.\r\n\r\nThe other girl filled out a goblet of the amber-coloured wine, the\r\nfragrance of which overpowered, for a moment, as it mantled on the\r\ngoblet’s brim, the aromatic perfumes which loaded the atmosphere of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nAnd Fulvia raised it to her lips, and sipped it slowly, and delightedly,\r\nsuffering it to glide drop by drop between her rosy lips, to linger on her\r\npleased palate, luxuriating in its soft richness, and dwelling long and\r\nrapturously on its flavour.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, the goblet was exhausted, a warmer hue came into her\r\nvelvet cheeks, a brighter spark danced in her azure eyes, and as she\r\nmotioned the Ionian slave-girl to replenish the cup and place it on the\r\ntripod at her elbow, she murmured in a low languid tone,\r\n\r\n\"Sing to me, now—sing to me, Ægle.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in obedience to her word the lovely girl bent her fair form over the\r\nlute, and, after a wild prelude full of strange thrilling melodies, poured\r\nout a voice as liquid and as clear, aye! and as soft, withal, as the\r\nnightingale’s, in a soft Sapphic love-strain full of the glorious poetry\r\nof her own lovely language.\r\n\r\n     Where in umbrageous shadow of the greenwood\r\n     Buds the gay primrose i’ the balmy spring time;\r\n     Where never silent, Philomel, the wildest\r\n                    Minstrel of ether,\r\n\r\n     Pours her high notes, and caroling, delighted\r\n     In the cool sun-proof canopy of the ilex\r\n     Hung with ivy green or a bloomy dog-rose\r\n                    Idly redundant,\r\n\r\n     Charms the fierce noon with melody; in the moonbeam\r\n     Where the coy Dryads trip it unmolested\r\n     All the night long, to merry dithyrambics\r\n                    Blissfully timing\r\n\r\n     Their rapid steps, which flit across the knot grass\r\n     Lightly, nor shake one flower of the blue-bell;\r\n     Where liquid founts and rivulets o’ silver\r\n                    Sweetly awaken\r\n\r\n     Clear forest echoes with unearthly laughter;\r\n     There will I, dearest, on a bank be lying\r\n     Where the wild thyme blows ever, and the pine tree\r\n                    Fitfully murmurs\r\n\r\n     Slumber inspiring. Come to me, my dearest,\r\n     On the fresh greensward, as a downy bride-bed,\r\n     Languid, unzoned, and amorous, reclining;\r\n                    Like Ariadne,\r\n\r\n     When the blythe wine-God, from Olympus hoary,\r\n     Wooed the soft mortal tremulously yielding\r\n     All her enchantments to the mighty victor—\r\n                    Happy Ariadne!\r\n\r\n     There will I, dearest, every frown abandon;\r\n     Nor do thou fear, nor hesitate to press me,\r\n     Since, if I chide, ’tis but a girl’s reproval,\r\n                    Faintly reluctant.\r\n\r\n     Doubt not I love thee, whether I return thy\r\n     Kisses in delight, or avert demurely\r\n     Lips that in truth burn to be kissed the closer,\r\n                    Eyes that avoid thee,\r\n\r\n     Loth to confess how amorously glowing\r\n     Pants the fond heart. Oh! tarry not, but urge me\r\n     Coy to consent; and if a blush alarm thee,\r\n                    Shyly revealing\r\n\r\n     Sentiments deep as the profound of Ocean,\r\n     If a sigh, faltered in an hour of anguish,\r\n     Seem to implore thee—pity not. The maiden\r\n                    Often adores thee\r\n\r\n     Most if offending. Never, oh! believe me,\r\n     Did the faint-hearted win a girl’s devotion,\r\n     Nor the true girl frown when a youth disarmed her\r\n                    Dainty denial.\r\n\r\nWhile she was yet singing, the curtains which covered the door were put\r\nquietly aside, and with a noiseless step Curius entered the apartment,\r\nunseen by the fair vocalist, whose back was turned to him, and made a sign\r\nto Fulvia that she should not appear to notice his arrival.\r\n\r\nThe haggard and uneasy aspect, which was peculiar to this man—the\r\ncare-worn expression, half-anxious and half-jaded, which has been\r\npreviously described, was less conspicuous on this occasion than ever it\r\nhad been before, since the light lady loved him. There was a feverish\r\nflush on his face, a joyous gleam in his dark eye, and a self-satisfied\r\nsmile lighting up all his features, which led her to believe at first that\r\nhe had been drinking deeply; and secondly, that by some means or other he\r\nhad succeeded in collecting the vast sum she had required of him, as the\r\nunworthy price of future favours.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two, the voluptuous strain ended; and, ere she knew that\r\nany stranger listened to her amatory warblings, the arm of Curius was\r\nwound about her slender waist, and his half-laughing voice was ringing in\r\nher ear,\r\n\r\n\"Well sung, my lovely Greek, and daintily advised!—By my faith! sweet one,\r\nI will take thee at thy word!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" cried the girl, extricating herself from his arms, by an elastic\r\nspring, before his lips could touch her cheek. \"No! no! you shall not kiss\r\nme. Kiss Fulvia, she is handsomer than I am, and loves you too. Come,\r\nMyrrha, let us leave them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with an arch smile and coquettish toss of her pretty head, she darted\r\nthrough the door, and was followed instantly by the other slave-girl, well\r\ntrained to divine the wishes of her mistress.\r\n\r\n\"_Ægle_ is right, by Venus!\" exclaimed Curius, drawing nearer to his\r\nmistress; \"you are more beautiful to-night than _ever_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flatterer!\" murmured the lady, suffering him to enfold her in his arms,\r\nand taste her lips for a moment. But the next minute she withdrew herself\r\nfrom his embrace, and said, half-smiling, half-abashed, \"But flattery will\r\nnot pay my debts. Have you brought me the moneys for Alfenus, my sweet\r\nCurius? the hundred thousand sesterces, you promised me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perish the dross!\" cried Curius, fiercely. \"Out on it! when I come to\r\nyou, burning with love and passion, you cast cold water on the flames, by\r\nyour incessant cry for gold. By all the Gods! I do believe, that you love\r\nme only for that you can wring from my purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it be so,\" replied the lady, scornfully, \"I surely do not love you\r\nmuch; seeing it is three months, since you have brought me so much as a\r\nring, or a jewel for a keepsake! But you should rather speak the truth out\r\nplainly, Curius,\" she continued, in an altered tone, \"and confess honestly\r\nthat you care for me no longer. If you loved me as once you did, you would\r\nnot leave me to be goaded by these harpies. Know you not—why do I ask? you\r\n_do_ know that my house, my slaves, nay! that my very jewels and my\r\ngarments, are mine but upon sufferance. It wants but a few days of the\r\ncalends of November, and if they find the interest unpaid, I shall be cast\r\nforth, shamed, and helpless, into the streets of Rome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so!\" answered Curius, with an expression which she could not\r\ncomprehend. \"Be it so! Fulvia; and if it be, you shall have any house in\r\nRome you will, for your abode. What say you to Cicero’s, in the Carinæ? or\r\nthe grand portico of Quintus Catulus, rich with the Cimbric spoils? or,\r\nbetter yet, that of Crassus, with its Hymettian columns, on the Palatine?\r\nAye! aye! the speech of Marcus Brutus was prophetic; who termed it, the\r\nother day, the house of _Venus_ on the Palatine! And you, my love, shall\r\nbe the goddess of that shrine! It shall be yours _to-morrow_, if you\r\nwill—so you will drive away the clouds from that sweet brow, and let those\r\neyes beam forth—by all the Gods!\"—he interrupted himself—\"I _will_ kiss\r\nthee!\"\r\n\r\n\"By all the Gods! thou shalt not—now, nor for evermore!\" she replied, in\r\nher turn growing very angry.—\"Thou foolish and mendacious boaster! what?\r\ndost thou deem me mad or senseless, to assail me with such drivelling\r\nfolly? Begone, fool! or I will call my slaves—I _have_ slaves yet, and, if\r\nit be the last deed of service they do for me, they shall spurn thee, like\r\na dog, from my doors.—Art thou insane, or only drunken, Curius?\" she\r\nadded, breaking off from her impetuous railing, into a cool sarcastic\r\ntone, that stung him to the quick.\r\n\r\n\"You shall see whether of the two, Harlot!\" he replied furiously,\r\nthrusting his hand into the bosom of his tunic, as if to seek a weapon.\r\n\r\n\"Harlot!\" she exclaimed, springing to her feet, the hot blood rushing to\r\nher brow in torrents—\"dare you say this to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dare! do you call this daring?\" answered the savage. \"This? what would\r\nyou call it, then, to devastate the streets of Rome with flame and\r\nfalchion—to hurl the fabric of the state headlong down from the blazing\r\nCapitol—to riot in the gore of senators, patricians, consulars!—What, to\r\naspire to be the lords and emperors of the universe?\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you?\" she exclaimed, moved greatly by his vehemence, and\r\nbeginning to suspect that this was something more than his mere ordinary\r\nboasting and exaggeration. \"What can you mean? oh! tell me; if you do love\r\nme, as you once did, tell me, Curius!\" and with rare artifice she altered\r\nher whole manner in an instant, all the expression of eye, lip, tone and\r\naccent, from the excess of scorn and hatred, to blandishment and fawning\r\nsoftness.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he replied sullenly. \"I will not tell you—no! You doubt me, distrust\r\nme, scorn me—no! I will tell you nothing! I will have all I wish or ask\r\nfor, on my own terms—you shall grant all, or die!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he unsheathed his dagger, as he spoke, and grasping her wrist\r\nviolently with his left hand, offered the weapon at her throat with his\r\nright—\"You shall grant all, or die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\"—she answered—\"never!\" looking him steadily yet softly in the\r\nface, with her beautiful blue eyes. \"To fear I will never yield, whatever\r\nI may do, to love or passion. Strike, if you will—strike a weak woman, and\r\nso prove your daring—it will be easier, if not so noble, as slaying\r\nsenators and consuls!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perdition!\" cried the fierce conspirator, \"I _will_ kill her!\" And with\r\nthe word he raised his arm, as if to strike; and, for a moment, the guilty\r\nand abandoned sensualist believed that her hour was come.\r\n\r\nYet she shrunk not, nor quailed before his angry eye, nor uttered any cry\r\nor supplication. She would have died that moment, as carelessly as she had\r\nlived. She would have died, acting out her character to the last sand of\r\nlife, with the smile on her lip, and the soft languor in her melting eye,\r\nin all things an Epicurean.\r\n\r\nBut the fierce mood of Curius changed. Irresolute, and impotent of evil,\r\nin a scarce less degree than he was sanguinary, rash, unprincipled, and\r\nfearless, it is not one of the least strange events, connected with a\r\nconspiracy the whole of which is strange, and much almost inexplicable,\r\nthat a man so wise, so sagacious, so deep-sighted, as the arch traitor,\r\nshould have placed confidence in one so fickle and infirm of purpose.\r\n\r\nHis knitted brow relaxed, the hardness of his eye relented, he cast the\r\ndagger from him.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, suffering the scarf to fall from her white and dazzling\r\nshoulders, the beautiful but bad enchantress flung herself upon his bosom,\r\nin the abandonment of her dishevelled beauty, winding her snowy arms about\r\nhis neck, smothering his voice with kisses.\r\n\r\nA moment more, and she was seated on his knee, with his left arm about her\r\nwaist, drinking with eager and attentive ears, that suffered not a single\r\ndetail to escape them, the fullest revelation of that atrocious plot, the\r\ndays, the very hours of action, the numbers, names, and rank of the\r\nconspirators!\r\n\r\nA woman’s infamy rewarded the base villain’s double treason! A woman’s\r\ninfamy saved Rome!\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, the crash and roar of the hurricane and earthquake cut\r\nshort their guilty pleasures. Curius rushed into the streets headlong,\r\nalmost deeming that the insurrection might have exploded prematurely, and\r\nfound it—more than half frustrated.\r\n\r\nFulvia, while yet the thunder rolled, and the blue lightning flashed above\r\nher head, and the earth reeled beneath her footsteps, went forth, strong\r\nin the resolution of that Roman patriotism, which, nursed by the\r\ninstitutions of the age, and the pride of the haughty heart, stood with\r\nher, as it did with so many others, in lieu of any other principle, of any\r\nother virtue.\r\n\r\nClosely veiled, unattended even by a single slave, that delicate luxurious\r\nsinner braved the wild fury of the elements; braved the tumultuous frenzy,\r\nand more tumultuous terror, of the disorganised and angry populace; braved\r\nthe dark superstition, which crept upon her as she marked the awful\r\nportents of that night, and half persuaded her to the belief that there\r\nwere Powers on high, who heeded the ways, punished the crimes of mortals.\r\n\r\nAnd that strange sense grew on her more and more, though she resisted it,\r\nincredulous, when after a little while she sat side by side with the wise\r\nand virtuous Consul, and marked the calmness, almost divine, of his\r\nthoughtful benignant features, as he heard the full details of the awful\r\ncrisis, heretofore but suspected, in which he stood, as if upon the verge\r\nof a scarce slumbering volcano.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between that frail woman, and the wise orator, none ever fully\r\nknew. But they parted—on his side with words of encouragement and\r\nkindness—on her’s with a sense of veneration approaching almost to\r\nreligious awe.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day, the usurer Alfenus received in full the debt, both\r\nprincipal and interest, which he had long despaired of touching.\r\n\r\nBut when the Great Man stood alone in his silent study, that strange and\r\nunexpected interview concluded, he turned his eyes upward, not looking,\r\neven once, toward the sublime bust of Jupiter which stood before him,\r\nserene in more than mortal grandeur; extended both his arms, and prayed in\r\nsolemn accents—\r\n\r\n\"All thanks to thee, Omnipotent, Ubiquitous, Eternal, ONE! whom we, vain\r\nfools of fancy, adore in many forms, and under many names; invest with the\r\nlow attributes of our own earthy nature; enshrine in mortal shapes, and\r\nhuman habitations! But thou, who wert, before the round world was, or the\r\nblue heaven o’erhung it; who wilt be, when those shall be no longer,—thou\r\npardonest our madness, guidest our blindness, guardest our weakness. Thou,\r\nby the basest and most loathed instruments, dost work out thy great ends.\r\nAll thanks, then, be to thee, by whatsoever name thou wouldest be\r\naddressed; to thee, whose dwelling is illimitable space, whose essence is\r\nin every thing that we behold, that moves, that is—to thee whom I hail,\r\nGOD! For thou hast given it to me to save my country. And whether I die\r\nnow, by this assassin’s knife, or live a little longer to behold the\r\nsafety I establish, I have lived long enough, and am content to\r\ndie!—Whether this death be, as philosophers have told us, a dreamless,\r\nsenseless, and interminable trance; or, as I sometimes dream, a brief and\r\npassing slumber, from which we shall awaken into a purer, brighter,\r\nhappier being—I have lived long enough! and when thou callest me, will\r\nanswer to thy summons, glad and grateful! For Rome, at least, survives me,\r\nand shall perchance survive, ’till time itself is ended, the Queen of\r\nUniversal Empire!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARNINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        These late eclipses in the sun and moon\r\n        Portend no good to us.\r\n                    KING LEAR.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the eighteenth of October, the day so eagerly looked\r\nforward to by the conspirators, and so much dreaded by the good citizens\r\nof the republic, had arrived. And now was seen, as it will oftentimes\r\nhappen, that when great events, however carefully concealed, are on the\r\npoint of coming to light, a sort of vague rumour, or indefinite\r\nanticipation, is found running through the whole mass of society—a rumour,\r\ntraceable to no one source, possessing no authority, and deserving no\r\ncredibility from its origin, or even its distinctness; yet in the main\r\ntrue and correct—an anticipation of I know not what terrible, unusual, and\r\nexaggerated issue, yet, after all, not very different from what is really\r\nabout to happen.\r\n\r\nThus it was at this period; and—though it is quite certain, that on the\r\npreceding evening, at the convocation of the senate, no person except\r\nCicero and Paullus, unconnected with the conspiracy, knew anything at all\r\nof the intended massacre and conflagration; though no one of the plotters\r\nhad yet broken faith with his fellows; and though none of the leaders\r\ndared avow their schemes openly, even to the discontented populace, with\r\nwhom they felt no sympathy, and from whom they expected no cordial or\r\ngeneral cooperation—it is equally certain that for many days, and even\r\nmonths past, there had been a feverish and excited state of the public\r\nmind; an agitation and restlessness of the operative classes; an\r\nindistinct and vague alarm of the noble and wealthy orders; which had\r\nincreased gradually until it was now at its height.\r\n\r\nAmong all these parties, this restlessness had taken the shape of\r\nanticipation, either dreadful or desirable, of some great change, of some\r\nstrange novelty—though no one, either of the wishers or fearers, could\r\nexplain what it was he wished or feared—to be developed at the consular\r\ncomitia.\r\n\r\nAnd amid this confusion, most congenial to his bold and scornful spirit,\r\nCatiline stalked, like the arch magician, to and fro, amid the wild and\r\nfantastic shapes of terror which he has himself evoked, marking the hopes\r\nof this one, as indications of an unknown, yet sure friend; and revelling\r\nin the terrors of that, as certain evidences of an enemy too weak and\r\npowerless to be formidable to his projects.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that a year before, previous to Cicero’s elevation to the\r\nchief magistracy, and previous to the murder of Piso by his own adherents\r\non his way to Spain, the designs of Catiline had been suspected dangerous;\r\nand, as such, had contributed to the election of his rival; his own\r\nfaction succeeding only in carrying in Antonius, the second and least\r\ndreaded of their candidates.\r\n\r\nHim Cicero, by rare management and much self-sacrifice, had contrived to\r\nbring over to the cause of the commonwealth; although he had so far kept\r\nhis faith with Catiline, as to disclose none, if indeed he knew any of his\r\ninfamous designs.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this defeat, and this subsequent secession of one on\r\nwhom they had, perhaps, prematurely reckoned, the conspirators, all but\r\ntheir indomitable and unwearied leader, had been for some time paralyzed.\r\nAnd this fact, joined to the extreme caution of their latter proceedings,\r\nhad tended to throw a shade of doubt over the previous accusation, and to\r\ncreate a sense of carelessness and almost of disbelief in the minds of the\r\nmajority, as to the real existence of any schemes at all against the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances, it cannot be doubted, for a moment, that\r\nhad Catiline and his friends entertained any real desire of ameliorating\r\nthe condition of the masses, of extending the privileges, or improving the\r\ncondition, of the discontented and suffering plebeians, they could have\r\noverturned the ancient fabric of Rome’s world-conquering oligarchy.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, they dreamed of nothing less, than of meddling at all\r\nwith the condition of the people; on whom they looked merely as tools and\r\ninstruments for the present, and sources of plunder and profit in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThey could not trust the plebeians, because they knew that the plebeians,\r\nin their turn, could not trust them.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful struggles of Marius, Cinna, and Sylla, had convinced those of\r\nall classes, who possessed any stake in the well being of the country; any\r\nestate or property, however humble, down even to the tools of daily\r\nlabour, and the occupation of permanent stalls for daily traffic, that it\r\nwas neither change, nor revolution, nor even larger liberty—much less\r\nproscription, civil strife, and fire-raising—but rest, but tranquillity,\r\nbut peace, that they required.\r\n\r\nIt was not to the people, therefore, properly so called, but to the\r\ndissolute and ruined outcasts of the aristocracy, and to the lowest\r\nrabble, the homeless, idle, vicious, drunken _poor_, who having nothing to\r\nlove, have necessarily all to gain, by havoc and rapine, that the\r\nconspirators looked for support.\r\n\r\nThe first class of these was won, bound by oaths, only less binding than\r\ntheir necessities and desperation, sure guaranties for their good faith.\r\n\r\nThe second—Catiline well knew that—needed no winning. The first clang of\r\narms in the streets, the first blaze of incendiary flames, no fear but\r\nthey would rise to rob, to ravish, and slay—ensuring that grand anarchy\r\nwhich he proposed to substitute for the existing state of things, and on\r\nwhich he hoped to build up his own tyrannous and blood-cemented empire.\r\n\r\nSo stood affairs on the evening of the seventeenth; and, although at times\r\na suspicion—not a fear, for of that he was incapable—flitted across the\r\nmind of the traitor, that things were not going on as he could wish them;\r\nthat the alienation of Paullus Arvina, and the absence of his injured\r\ndaughter, must probably work together to the discomfiture of the\r\nconspiracy; still, as hour after hour passed away, and no discovery was\r\nmade, he revelled in his anticipated triumph.\r\n\r\nOf the interview between Paullus and Lucia, he was as yet unaware; and,\r\nwith that singular inconsistency which is to be found in almost every\r\nmind, although he disbelieved, as a principle, in the existence of honor\r\nat all, he yet never doubted that young Arvina would hold himself bound\r\nstrictly by the pledge of secrecy which he had reiterated, after the\r\nfrustration of the murderous attempt against his life, in the cave of\r\nEgeria.\r\n\r\nNor did he err in his premises; for had not Arvina been convinced that new\r\nand more perilous schemes were on the point of being executed against\r\nhimself, he would have remained silent as to the names of the traitors;\r\nhowever he might have deemed it his duty to reveal the meditated treason.\r\n\r\nWith his plans therefore all matured, his chief subordinates drilled\r\nthoroughly to the performance of their parts, his minions armed and ready,\r\nhe doubted not in the least, as he gazed on the setting sun, that the next\r\nrising of the great luminary would look down on the conflagration of the\r\nsuburbs, on the slaughter of his enemies, and the triumphant elevation of\r\nhimself to the supreme command of the vast empire, for which he played so\r\nfoully.\r\n\r\nThe morning came, the long desired sun arose, and all his plots were\r\ncountermined, all his hopes of immediate action paralyzed, if not utterly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, assembled on the previous evening at a moment’s notice, had\r\nbeen taken by surprise so completely by the strange revelations made to\r\nthem by their Consul, that not one of the advocates or friends of Catiline\r\narose to say one syllable in his defence; and he himself, quick-witted,\r\nready, daring as he was, and fearing neither man nor God, was for once\r\nthunderstricken and astonished.\r\n\r\nThe address of the Consul was short, practical, and to the point; and the\r\ndanger he foretold to the order was so terrible, while the inconvenience\r\nof deferring the elections was so small, and its occurrence so frequent—a\r\nsudden tempest, the striking of the standard on the Janiculum, the\r\ninterruption of a tribune, or the slightest informality in the augural\r\nrites sufficing to interrupt them—that little objection was made in any\r\nquarter, to the motion of Cicero, that the comitia should be delayed,\r\nuntil the matter could be thoroughly investigated. For he professed only\r\nas yet to possess a clue, which he promised hereafter to unravel to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nCatiline had, however, so far recovered from his consternation, that he\r\nhad risen to address the house, when the first words he uttered were\r\ndrowned by a strange and unearthly sound, like the rumbling of ten\r\nthousand chariots over a stony way, beginning, as it seemed, underneath\r\ntheir feet, and rising gradually until it died away over head in the murky\r\nair. Before there was time for any comment on this extraordinary sound, a\r\ntremulous motion crept through the marble pavements, increasing every\r\nmoment, until the doors flew violently open, and the vast columns and\r\nthick walls of the stately temple reeled visibly in the dread earthquake.\r\n\r\nNor was this all, for as the portals opened, in the black skies, right\r\nopposite the entrance, there stood, glaring with red and lurid light, a\r\nbearded star or comet; which, to the terror-stricken eyes of the Fathers,\r\nseemed a portentous sword, brandished above the city.\r\n\r\nThe groans and shrieks of the multitude, rushed in with an appalling sound\r\nto increase their superstitious awe; and to complete the whole, a pale and\r\nghastly messenger was ushered into the house, announcing that a bright\r\nlambent flame was sitting on the lance-heads of the Prætor’s guard, which\r\nhad been summoned to protect the Senate in its deliberations.\r\n\r\nA fell sneer curled the lip of Catiline. He was not even superstitious.\r\nSelf-vanity and confidence in his own powers, and long impunity in crime,\r\nhad hardened him, had maddened him, almost to Atheism. Yet he dared not\r\nattack the sacred prejudices of the men, whom, but for that occurrence, he\r\nhad yet hoped to win to their own undoing.\r\n\r\nBut, as he saw their blanched visages, and heard their mutterings of\r\nterror, he saw likewise that an impression was made on their minds, which\r\nno words of his could for the present counteract. And, with a sneering\r\nsmile at fears which he knew not, and a smothered curse at the accident,\r\nas he termed it, which had foiled him, he sat down silent.\r\n\r\n\"The Gods have spoken!\" exclaimed Cicero, flinging his arms abroad\r\nmajestically. \"The guilty are struck dumb! The Gods have spoken aloud\r\ntheir sympathy for Rome’s peril; and will ye, ye its chosen sons, whose\r\nall of happiness and life lie in its sanctity and safety, will ye, I say,\r\nlove your own country, your own mother, less than the Gods love her?\"\r\n\r\nThe moment was decisive, the appeal irresistible. By acclamation the vote\r\nwas carried; no need to debate or to divide the House—’that the elections\r\nbe deferred until the eleventh day before the Calends, and that the Senate\r\nmeet again to-morrow, shortly after sunrise, to deliberate what shall be\r\ndone to protect the Republic?’\r\n\r\nMorning came, dark indeed, and lurid, and more like the close, than the\r\nopening of day. Morning came, but it brought no change with it; for not a\r\nhead in Rome had lain that night upon a pillow, save those of the unburied\r\ndead, or the bedridden. Young men and aged, sick and sound, masters and\r\nslaves, had wooed no sleep during the hours of darkness, so terribly, so\r\nconstantly was it illuminated by the broad flashes of blue lightning, and\r\nthe strange meteors, which rushed almost incessantly athwart the sky. The\r\nwinds too had been all unchained in their fury, and went howling like\r\ntormented spirits, over the terrified and trembling city.\r\n\r\nIt was said too, that the shades of the dead had arisen, and were seen\r\nmingling in the streets with the living, scarcely more livid than the\r\nhalf-dead spectators of portents so ominous. No rumour so absurd or\r\nfanatical, but it found on that night, implicit credence. Some shouted in\r\nthe streets and open places, that the patricians and the knights were\r\narming their adherents for a promiscuous massacre of the people. Some,\r\nthat the gladiators had broken loose, and slain thousands of citizens\r\nalready! Some, that there was a Gallic tumult, and that the enemy would be\r\nat the gates in the morning! Some that the Gods had judged Rome to\r\ndestruction!\r\n\r\nAnd so they raved, and roared, and sometimes fought; and would have rioted\r\ntremendously; for many of the commoner conspirators were abroad, ready to\r\ntake advantage of any casual incident to breed an affray; but that a\r\nstrong force of civil magistrates patrolled the streets with armed\r\nattendants; and that, during the night several cohorts were brought in,\r\nfrom the armies of Quintus Marcius Rex, and Quintus Metellus Creticus,\r\nwith all their armor and war weapons, in heavy marching order; and\r\noccupied the Capitol, the Palatine, and the Janiculum, and all the other\r\nprominent and commanding points of the city, with an array that set\r\nopposition at defiance.\r\n\r\nSo great, however, were the apprehensions of many of the nobles, that Rome\r\nwas on the eve of a servile insurrection, that many of them armed their\r\nfreedmen, and imprisoned all their slaves; while others, the more generous\r\nand milder, who thought they could rely on the attachment of their people,\r\nweaponed their slaves themselves, and fortified their isolated dwellings\r\nagainst the anticipated onslaught.\r\n\r\nThus passed that terrible and tempestuous night; the roar of the elements,\r\nunchained as they were, and at their work of havoc, not sufficing to drown\r\nthe dissonant and angry cries of men, the clash of weapons, and the shrill\r\nclamor of women; which made Rome more resemble the Pandemonium than the\r\nmetropolis of the world’s most civilized and mightiest nation.\r\n\r\nBut now morning had come at length; and gradually, as the storm ceased,\r\nand the heavens resumed their natural appearance, the terrors and the fury\r\nof the multitude subsided; and, partly satisfied by the constant and\r\nwell-timed proclamations of the magistrates, partly convinced that for the\r\nmoment there was no hope of successful outrage, and yet more wearied out\r\nwith their own turbulent vehemence, whether of fear or anger, the crowd\r\nbegan to retire to their houses, and the streets were left empty and\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nAs the day dawned, there was no banner hoisted on the Janiculum, although\r\nits turrets might be seen bristling with the short massive javelins of the\r\nlegions, and gleaming with the tawny light that flashed from their brazen\r\ncasques and corslets.\r\n\r\nThere was no augural tent pitched on the hills without the city walls,\r\nwherefrom to take the auspices.\r\n\r\nAnd above all, there were no loud and stirring calls of the brazen\r\ntrumpets of the centuries, to summon forth the civic army of the Roman\r\npeople to the Campus, there to elect their rulers for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent therefore to all men, that the elections would not be held\r\nthat day, though none knew clearly wherefore they had been deferred.\r\n\r\nWhile the whole city was loud with turbulent confusion—for, as morning\r\nbroke, and it was known that the comitia were postponed, the agitation of\r\nterror succeeded to that of insubordination—Hortensia and her daughter sat\r\ntogether, pale, anxious, and heartsick, yet firm and free from all\r\nunworthy evidences of dismay.\r\n\r\nDuring the past night, which had been to both a sleepless one, they had\r\nsate listening, lone and weak women, to the roar of tumultuous streets,\r\nand expecting at every moment they knew not what of violence and outrage.\r\n\r\nPaullus Arvina had come in once to reassure them: and informed them that\r\nthe vigilance of the Consul had been crowned with success, and that the\r\ndanger of a conflict in the streets was subsiding every moment.\r\n\r\nStill, the care which he bestowed on examining the fastenings of the\r\ndoors, and such windows as looked into the streets, the earnestness with\r\nwhich he inculcated watchful heed to the armed slaves of the household,\r\nand the positive manner in which he insisted on leaving Thrasea and a\r\ndozen of his own trustiest men to assist Hortensia’s people, did more to\r\nobliterate the hopes his own words would otherwise have excited, than the\r\nwords themselves to excite them.\r\n\r\nNor was it, indeed, to be wondered that Hortensia should be liable, above\r\nother women, not to base terror,—for of that from her high character she\r\nwas incapable—but to a settled apprehension and distrust of the Roman\r\nPopulace.\r\n\r\nIt was now four-and-twenty years since the city had been disturbed by\r\nplebeian violence or aristocratic vengeance. Twenty-four years ago, the\r\navenging sword of Sylla had purged the state of its bloodthirsty\r\ndemagogues, and their brute followers; twenty-four years ago his powerful\r\nhand had reestablished Rome’s ancient constitution, full of checks and\r\nbalances, which secured equal rights to every Roman citizen; which secured\r\nall equality, in short to all men, save that which no human laws can give,\r\nequality of social rank, and equality of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe years, however, which had gone before that restoration, the dreadful\r\nmassacres and yet more dreadful proscriptions of Cinna and Marius, had\r\nleft indelible and sanguinary traces on the ancestral tree of many a noble\r\nhouse; and on none deeper than on that of Hortensia’s family.\r\n\r\nHer brother, Caius Julius, an orator second to none in those days, had\r\nbeen murdered by the followers of Marius, almost before his sister’s eyes,\r\nwith circumstances of appalling cruelty. Her house had been forced open by\r\nthe infuriate rabble, her husband hewn down with unnumbered wounds, on his\r\nown hearth-stone, and her first born child tossed upon the revolutionary\r\npike heads.\r\n\r\nHer husband indeed recovered, almost miraculously, from his wounds, and\r\nlived to see retribution fall upon the guilty partizans of Marius; but he\r\nwas never well again, and after languishing for years, died at last of the\r\nwounds he received on that bloody day.\r\n\r\nGood cause, then, had Hortensia to tremble at the tender mercies of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNor, though they struck the minds of these high-born ladies with less\r\nperplexity and awe than the vulgar souls without, were the portents and\r\nhorrors of the heaven, without due effect. No mind in those days, however\r\nclear and enlightened, but held some lingering belief that such things\r\nwere ominous of coming wrath, and sent by the Gods to inform their\r\nfaithful worshippers.\r\n\r\nIt was moreover fresh in her memory, how two years before, during the\r\nconsulship of Cotta and Torquatus, in a like terrible night-storm, the\r\nfire from heaven had stricken down the highest turrets of the capitol,\r\nmelted the brazen tables of the law, and scathed the gilded effigy of\r\nRomulus and Remus, sucking their shaggy foster-mother, which stood on the\r\nCapitoline.\r\n\r\nThe augurs in those days, collected from Etruria and all parts of Italy,\r\nafter long consultation, had proclaimed that unless the Gods should be\r\nappeased duly, the end of Rome and her empire was at hand.\r\n\r\nAnd now—what though for ten whole days consecutive the sacred games went\r\non; what though nothing had been omitted whereby to avert the immortal\r\nindignation—did not this heaven-born tempest prove that the wrath was not\r\nsoothed, that the decree yet stood firm?\r\n\r\nIn such deep thoughts, and in the strong excitement of such expectation,\r\nHortensia and her daughter had passed that awful night; not without high\r\ninstructions from the elder lady, grave and yet stirring narratives of the\r\ngreat men of old—how they strove fiercely, energetically, while strife\r\ncould avail anything; and how, when the last hope was over, they folded\r\ntheir hands in stern and awful resignation, and met their fate\r\nunblenching, and with but one care—that the decorum of their deaths should\r\nnot prove unworthy the dignity of their past lives.\r\n\r\nNot without generous and noble resolutions on the part of both, that they\r\ntoo would not be found wanting.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing humble, nothing soft, in their stern and proud\r\nsubmission to the inevitable necessity. Nothing of love toward the hand\r\nwhich dealt the blow—nothing of confidence in supernal justice, much less\r\nin supernal mercy! Nothing of that sweet hope, that undying trust, that\r\nconsciousness of self-unworthiness, that full conviction of a glorious\r\nfuture, which renders so beautiful and happy the submission of a dying\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nNo! there were none of these things; for to the wisest and best of the\r\nancients, the foreshadowings of the soul’s immortality were dim, faint,\r\nand uncertain. The legends of their mythology held up such pictures of the\r\nsensuality and vice of those whom they called Gods, that it was utterly\r\nimpossible for any sound understanding to accept them. And deep thinkers\r\nwere consequently driven into pure Deism, coupled too often with the\r\nEpicurean creed, that the Great Spirit was too grand and too sublime to\r\ntrouble himself with the brief doings of mortality.\r\n\r\nThe whole scope of the Roman’s hope and ambition, then, was limited to\r\nthis world; or, if there was a longing for anything beyond the term of\r\nmortality, it was for a name, a memory, an immortality of good report.\r\n\r\nAnd pride, which the christian, better instructed, knows to be the germ\r\nand root of all sin, was to the Roman, the sole spring of honourable\r\naction, the sole source of virtue.\r\n\r\nNow, with the morning, quiet was restored both to the angry skies, and to\r\nthe restless city.\r\n\r\nWorn out with anxiety, and watching, sleep fell upon the eyes of Julia, as\r\nshe sat half recumbent in a large softly-cushioned chair of Etruscan\r\nbronze. Her fair head fell back on the crimson pillow, with all its wealth\r\nof auburn ringlets flowing dishevelled; and that soft still shadow, which\r\nis yet, in its beautiful serenity, half terrible, so nearly is it allied\r\nto the shadow of that sleep from which there comes no waking, fell over\r\nher pale features.\r\n\r\nThe mother gazed on her for a moment, with more gentleness in her eye, and\r\na milder smile on her face, than her indomitable pride often permitted her\r\nto manifest.\r\n\r\n\"She sleeps\"—she said, looking at her wistfully—\"she sleeps! Aye! the\r\nyoung sleep easily, even in their affliction. They sleep, and forget their\r\nsorrows, and awaken, either to fresh woes, as soon to be obliterated, or\r\nto vain joys, yet briefer, and more fleeting. Thoughtlessness to the\r\nyoung—anguish to the old—such is mortality! And what beyond?—aye,\r\nwhat?—what that we should so toil, so suffer, to be virtuous? Is it a\r\ndream, all a dream—this futurity? I fear so\"—and, with the words, she\r\nlapsed into a fit of solemn meditation, and stood for many minutes silent,\r\nand absorbed. Then a keen light came into her dark eyes, a flash of\r\nanimation coloured her pale cheeks, she stretched her arms aloft, and in a\r\nclear sonorous voice—\"No! no!\" she said, \"Honour—honour—immortal honour;\r\nthou, at least, art no dream—thou art worth dying, suffering, aye! worth\r\n_living_ to obtain! For what is life but the deeper sorrow, to the more\r\nvirtuous and the nobler?\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes longer she stood gazing on her daughter’s beautiful face,\r\nuntil the sound of voices louder than usual, and a slight bustle, in the\r\nperistyle, attracted her attention. Then, after throwing a pallium, or\r\nshawl, of richly embroidered woollen stuff over the fair form of the\r\nsleeper, she opened the door leading to the garden colonnade, and left the\r\nroom silently.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Hortensia disappeared, before the opposite door, by which the\r\nsaloon communicated with the atrium, was opened, and a slave entered,\r\nbearing a small folded note, secured by a waxen seal, on a silver plate.\r\n\r\nHe approached Julia’s chair, apparently in some hesitation, as if he felt\r\nthat it was his duty, and was yet half afraid to awaken her. At length,\r\nhowever, he made up his mind, and addressed a word or two to her, which\r\nwere sufficiently distinct to arouse her—for she started up and gazed\r\nwildly about her—but left no clear impression of their meaning on her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThis, however, the man did not appear to notice; at all events, he did not\r\nwait to observe the effect of his communication, but quitted the room\r\nhastily, and in considerable trepidation, leaving the note on the table.\r\n\r\nJulia was sleeping very heavily, at the moment when she was so startled\r\nfrom her slumber; and, as is not unfrequently the case, a sort of\r\nbewilderment and nervous agitation fell upon her, as she recovered her\r\nsenses. Perhaps she had been dreaming, and the imaginary events of her\r\ndream had blended themselves with the real occurrence which awakened her.\r\nBut for a minute or two, though she saw the note, and the person who laid\r\nit on the table, she could neither bring it to her mind who that person\r\nwas, nor divest herself of the impression that there was something both\r\ndangerous and supernatural in what had passed.\r\n\r\nIn a little while this feeling passed away, and, though still nervous and\r\ntrembling, the young girl smiled at her own alarm, as she took up the\r\nbillet, which was directed to herself in a delicate feminine hand, with\r\nthe usual form of superscription—\r\n\r\n\"To Julia Serena, health\"—\r\n\r\nalthough the writer’s name was omitted.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at it for a moment, wondering from whom it could come; since she\r\nhad no habitual correspondent, and the hand-writing, though beautiful, was\r\nstrange to her. She opened it, and read, her wonder and agitation\r\nincreasing with every line—\r\n\r\n\"You love Paullus Arvina,\" thus it ran, \"and are loved by him. He is\r\nworthy all your affection. Are you worthy of him, I know not. I love him\r\nalso, but alas! less happy, am not loved again, nor hope to be, nor indeed\r\ndeserve it! They tell me you are beautiful; I have seen you, and yet I\r\nknow not—they told me once that I too was beautiful, and yet I know not! I\r\nknow this only, that I am desperate, and base, and miserable! Yet fear me\r\nnot, nor mistake me. I love Paullus, yet would not have him mine, now; no!\r\nnot to be happy—as to be his would render me. Yet had it not been for you,\r\nI might have been virtuous, honourable, happy, _his_—for winning him from\r\nme, you won from me hope; and with hope virtue; and with virtue honour!\r\nOught I not then to hate you, Julia? Perchance I ought—to do so were at\r\nleast Roman—and hating to avenge! Perchance, if I _hoped_, I should. But\r\nhoping nothing, I hate nothing, dread nothing, and wish nothing.—Yea! by\r\nthe Gods! I wish to know Paullus happy—yea! more, I wish, even at cost of\r\nmy own misery, to make him happy. Shall I do so, by making him yours,\r\nJulia? I think so, for be sure—be sure, he loves you. Else had he yielded\r\nto my blandishments, to my passion, to my beauty! for I am—by the Gods! I\r\nam, though he sees it not, as beautiful as thou. And I am proud\r\nlikewise—or was proud once—for misery has conquered pride in me; or what\r\nis weaker yet, and baser—love!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will make him happy. You can if you will. Do so, by all the\r\nGods! I adjure you do so; and if you do not, tremble!—tremble, I say—for\r\nthink, if I sacrifice myself to win bliss for him—think, girl, how gladly,\r\nhow triumphantly, I would destroy a rival, who should fail to do that, for\r\nwhich alone I spare her.\r\n\r\n\"Spare her! nay, but much more; for I can save her—can and will.\r\n\r\n\"Strange things will come to pass ere long, and terrible; and to no one so\r\nterrible as to you.\r\n\r\n\"There is a man in Rome, so powerful, that the Gods, only, if there be\r\nGods, can compare with him—so haughty in ambition, that stood he second in\r\nOlympus, he would risk all things to be first—so cruel, that the dug-drawn\r\nHyrcanian tigress were pitiful compared to him—so reckless of all things\r\ndivine or human, that, did his own mother stand between him and his\r\nvengeance, he would strike through her heart to gain it.\r\n\r\n\"This man hath Paullus made his foe—he hath crossed his path; he hath\r\n_foiled_ him!\r\n\r\n\"He never spared man in his wrath, or woman in his passion.\r\n\r\n\"He hateth Paullus!\r\n\r\n\"He hath looked on Julia!\r\n\r\n\"Think, then, when lust and hate spur such a man together, what will\r\nrestrain him.\r\n\r\n\"Now mark me, and you shall yet be safe. All means will be essayed to win\r\nyou, for he would torture Paul by making him his slave, ere he make you\r\nhis victim.\r\n\r\n\"And Paul may waver. He hath wavered once. Chance only, and I, rescued\r\nhim! I can do no more, for Rome must know me no longer! See, then, that\r\nthou hold him constant in the right—firm for his country! So may he defy\r\nsecret spite, as he hath defied open violence.\r\n\r\n\"Now for thyself—beware of women! Go not forth alone ever, or without\r\narmed followers! Sleep not, but with a woman in thy chamber, and a watcher\r\nat thy door! Eat not, nor drink, any thing abroad; nor at home, save that\r\nwhich is prepared by known hands, and tasted by the slave who serves it!\r\n\r\n\"Be true to Paullus, and yourself, and you have a friend ever watchful. So\r\nfear not, nor despond!\r\n\r\n\"Fail me—and, failing truth and honour, failing to make Paullus happy, you\r\n_do_ fail me! Fail me, and nothing, in the world’s history or fable, shall\r\nmatch the greatness of my vengeance—of your anguish!\r\n\r\n\"Fail me! and yours shall be, for ages, the name that men shall quote,\r\nwhen they would tell of untold misery, of utter shame, and desolation, and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter dropped from her hand; she sat aghast and speechless, terrified\r\nbeyond measure, and yet unable to determine, or divine, even, to what its\r\ndark warnings and darker denunciations pointed.\r\n\r\nJust at this instant, as between terror and amazement she was on the verge\r\nof fainting, a clanging step was heard without; the crimson draperies that\r\ncovered the door, were put aside; and, clad in glittering armour, Paullus\r\nArvina stood before her.\r\n\r\nShe started up, with a strange haggard smile flashing across her pallid\r\nface, staggered a step or two to meet him, and sank in an agony of tears\r\nupon his bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n          To err is human; to forgive—divine!\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of Paullus, at this strange burst of feeling on the part\r\nof one usually so calm, so self-controlled, and seemingly so unimpassioned\r\nas that sweet lady, may be more easily imagined than described.\r\n\r\nThat she, whose maidenly reserve had never heretofore permitted the\r\nslightest, the most innocent freedom of her accepted lover, should cast\r\nherself thus into his arms, should rest her head on his bosom, was in\r\nitself enough to surprise him; but when to this were added the violent\r\nconvulsive sobs, which shook her whole frame, the flood of tears, which\r\nstreamed from her eyes, the wild and disjointed words, which fell from her\r\npale lips, he was struck dumb with something not far removed from terror.\r\n\r\nThat it was fear, which shook her thus, he could not credit; for during\r\nall the fearful sounds and rumours of the past night, she had been as firm\r\nas a hero.\r\n\r\nYet he knew not, dared not think, to what other cause he might attribute\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her soothingly, tenderly, but his voice faltered as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Nay! nay! be not alarmed, dear girl!\" he said. \"The tumults are all, long\r\nsince, quelled; the danger has all vanished with the darkness, and the\r\nstorm. Cheer up, my own, sweet, Julia.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he spoke, he passed his arm about her graceful form, and drew her\r\ncloser to his bosom.\r\n\r\nBut whether it was this movement, or something in his words that aroused\r\nher, she started from his arms in a moment; and stood erect and rigid,\r\npale still and agitated, but no longer trembling. She raised her hands to\r\nher brow, and put away the profusion of rich auburn ringlets, which had\r\nfallen down dishevelled over her eyes, and gazed at him stedfastly,\r\nstrangely, as she had never gazed at him before.\r\n\r\n\"Your own Julia!\" she said, in slow accents, scarce louder than a whisper,\r\nbut full of strong and painful meaning. \"Oh! I adjure you, by the Gods! by\r\nall you love! or hope! Are you false to me, Paullus!\"\r\n\r\n\"False! Julia!\" he exclaimed, starting, and the blood rushing consciously\r\nto his bold face.\r\n\r\n\"I am answered!\" she said, collecting herself, with a desperate effort.\r\n\"It is well—the Gods guard you!—Leave me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave you!\" he cried. \"By earth, and sea, and heaven, and all that they\r\ncontain! I know not what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know you this writing, then?\" she asked him, reaching the letter from the\r\ntable, and holding it before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"No more than I know, what so strangely moves you,\" he answered; and she\r\nsaw, by the unaffected astonishment which pervaded all his features, that\r\nhe spoke truly.\r\n\r\n\"Read it,\" she said, somewhat more composed; \"and tell me, who is the\r\nwriter of it. You must know.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he had read six lines, it was clear to him that it must come from\r\nLucia, and no words can describe the agony, the eager intense torture of\r\nanticipation, with which he perused it, devouring every word, and at every\r\nword expecting to find the damning record of his falsehood inscribed in\r\ncharacters, that should admit of no denial.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, he had reached the middle of the letter, he felt that he\r\ncould bear the scrutiny of that pale girl no longer; and, lowering the\r\nstrip of vellum on which it was written, met her eye firmly.\r\n\r\nFor he was resolute for once to do the true and honest thing, let what\r\nmight come of it. The weaker points of his character were vanishing\r\nrapidly, and the last few eventful days had done the work of years upon\r\nhis mind; and all that work was salutary.\r\n\r\nShe, too, read something in the expression of his eye, which led her to\r\nhope—what, she knew not; and she smiled faintly, as she said—\r\n\r\n\"You know the writer, Paullus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Julia, I know her,\" he replied steadily.\r\n\r\n\"Her!\" she said, laying an emphasis on the word, but how affected by it\r\nArvina could not judge. \"It _is_ then a woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very young, a very beautiful, a very wretched, girl!\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"And you love her?\" she said, with an effort at firmness, which itself\r\nproved the violence of her emotion.\r\n\r\n\"By your life! Julia, I do not!\" he replied, with an energy, that spoke\r\nwell for the truth of his asseveration.\r\n\r\n\"Nor ever loved her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor ever—_loved_ her, Julia.\" But he hesitated a little as he said it;\r\nand laid a peculiar stress on the word loved, which did not escape the\r\nanxious ears of the lovely being, whose whole soul hung suspended on his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" she asked, after a moment’s pause, \"if she be so very young,\r\nand so very beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might answer, because I never saw her, ’till I loved one more\r\nbeautiful. But—\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will not!\" she interrupted him vehemently. \"Oh! if you love me?\r\nif you _do_ love me, Paullus, do not answer me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore not?\" he asked her, half smiling, though little mirthful in\r\nhis heart, at her impetuosity.\r\n\r\n\"Because if you descend to flatter,\" answered the fair girl quietly, \"I\r\nshall be sure that you intended to deceive me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be strictly true, notwithstanding. For though, as she says, we\r\nmet years ago, she was but a child then; and, since that time, I never saw\r\nher until four or five days ago—\"\r\n\r\n\"And since then, how often?\" Julia again interrupted him; for, in the\r\nintensity of her anxiety, she could not wait the full answer to one\r\nquestion, before another suggested itself to her mind, and found voice at\r\nthe instant.\r\n\r\n\"Once, Julia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once only, by the Gods!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not told me wherefore it was, that you never loved her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not told you, that I never saw her till a few days, a few hours, I\r\nmight have said, ago? and does not that tell you wherefore, Julia?\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is something more. There is another reason. Oh! tell me, I\r\nadjure you, by all that you hold dearest, tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another reason. I told you that she was very young, and very\r\nbeautiful; but, Julia, she was also very guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Guilty!\" exclaimed the fair girl, blushing fiery red, \"guilty of loving\r\nyou! Oh! Paullus! Paullus!\" and between shame, and anger, and the\r\nrepulsive shock that every pure and feminine mind experiences in hearing\r\nof a sister’s frailty, she buried her face in her hands, and wept aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Guilty, before I ever heard her name, or knew that she existed,\" answered\r\nthe young man, fervently; but his heart smote him somewhat, as he spoke;\r\nthough what he said was but the simple truth, and it was well for him\r\nperhaps at the present moment, that Julia did not see his face. For there\r\nwas much perturbation in it, and it is like that she would have judged\r\neven more hardly of that perturbation than it entirely deserved. He paused\r\nfor a moment, and then added,\r\n\r\n\"But if the guilt of woman can be excusable at all, she can plead more in\r\nextenuation of her errors, than any of her sex that ever fell from virtue.\r\nShe is most penitent; and might have been, but for fate and the atrocious\r\nwickedness of others, a most noble being—as she is now a most glorious\r\nruin.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, during which neither spoke or moved, Julia\r\noverpowered by the excess of her feelings—he by the painful consciousness\r\nof wrong; the difficulty of explaining, of extenuating his own conduct;\r\nand above all, the dread of losing the enchanting creature, whom he had\r\nnever loved so deeply or so truly as he did now, when he had well nigh\r\nforfeited all claim to her affection.\r\n\r\nAt length, she raised her eyes timidly to his, and said,\r\n\r\n\"This is all very strange—there must be much, that I have a right to\r\nhear.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is much, Julia!—much that will be very painful for me to tell; and\r\nyet more so for you to listen to.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you tell it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Julia, I will!\"\r\n\r\n\"And all? and truly?\"\r\n\r\n\"And all, and truly, if I tell you at all; but you—\"\r\n\r\n\"First,\" she said, interrupting him, \"read that strange letter to the end.\r\nThen we will speak more of these things. Nay?\" she continued, seeing that\r\nhe was about to speak, \"I will have it so. It must be so, or all is at an\r\nend between us two, now, and for ever. I do not wish to watch you; there\r\nis no meanness in my mind, Paullus, no jealousy! I am too proud to be\r\njealous. Either you are worthy of my affection, or unworthy; if the\r\nlatter, I cast you from me without one pang, one sorrow;—if the first,\r\nfarther words are needless. Read that wild letter to the end. I will turn\r\nmy back to you.\" And seating herself at the table, she took up a piece of\r\nembroidery, and made as if she would have fixed her mind upon it. But\r\nPaullus saw, as his glance followed her, that, notwithstanding the\r\nfirmness of her words and manner, her hand trembled so much that she could\r\nby no means thread her needle.\r\n\r\nHe gazed on her for a moment with passionate, despairing love, and as he\r\ngazed, his spirit faltered, and he doubted. The evil genius whispered to\r\nhis soul, that truth must alienate her love, must sever her from him for\r\never. There was a sharp and bitter struggle in his heart for that\r\nmoment—but it passed; and the better spirit was again strong and clear\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he said to himself, \"No! I have done with fraud, and falsehood! I\r\nwill not win her by a lie! If by the truth I must lose her, be it so! I\r\nwill be true, and at least I can—die!\"\r\n\r\nThereon, without another word, he read the letter to the end, neither\r\nfaltering, nor pausing; and then walked calmly to the table, and laid it\r\ndown, perfectly resolute and tranquil, for his mind was made up for the\r\nworst.\r\n\r\n\"Have you read it?\" she asked, and her voice trembled, as much as her hand\r\nhad done before.\r\n\r\n\"I have, Julia, to the end. It is very sad—and much of it is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is the girl, who wrote it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her name is Lucia Orestilla.\"\r\n\r\n\"Orestilla! Ye Gods! ye Gods! the shameless wife of the arch villain\r\nCatiline!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so—but the wretched, ruined daughter of that abandoned woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Call her not woman! By the Gods that protect purity! call her not woman!\r\nDid she not prompt the wretch to poison his own son! Oh! call her anything\r\nbut woman! But what—what—in the name of all that is good or holy, can have\r\nbrought you to know that awful being’s daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, Julia, you must promise me never, to mortal ears, to reveal what I\r\nnow disclose to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you forgotten, Paullus, that I am yet but a young maiden, and that I\r\nhave a mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hortensia!\" exclaimed the youth, starting back, aghast; for he felt that\r\nfrom her clear eye and powerful judgment nothing could be concealed, and\r\nthat her iron will would yield in nothing to a woman’s tenderness, a\r\nwoman’s mercy.\r\n\r\n\"Hortensia,\" replied the girl gently, \"the best, the wisest, and the\r\ntenderest of mothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"True? she is all that you say—more than all! But she is resolute, withal,\r\nas iron; and stern, and cold, and unforgiving in her anger!\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you need so much forgiveness, Paullus?\"\r\n\r\n\"More, I fear, than my Julia’s love will grant me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, my Paullus, you do not know the measure of a girl’s honest love.\r\nBut may I tell Hortensia? If not, you have said enough. What is not\r\nfitting for a girl to speak to her own mother, it is not fitting that she\r\nshould hear at all—least of all from a man, and that man—her lover!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not that, my Julia. But what I have to say contains many lives—mine\r\namong others! contains Rome’s safety, nay! existence! One whisper breathed\r\nabroad, or lisped in a slave’s hearing, were the World’s ruin. But be it\r\nas you will—as you think best yourself and wisest. If you will, tell\r\nHortensia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall tell her, Paullus. I tell her everything. Since I could babble my\r\nfirst words, I never had a secret from her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so, sweet one. Now I implore you, hear me to the end, before you\r\njudge me, and then judge mercifully, as the Gods are merciful, and mortals\r\nprone to error.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you tell me the whole truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say on, then. I will hear you to the end; and your guilt must be great,\r\nPaullus, if you require a more partial arbitress.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a trying and painful task, that was forced upon him, yet he went\r\nthrough it nobly. At every word the difficulties grew upon him. At every\r\nword the temptation, to swerve from the truth, increased. At every word\r\nthe dread of losing her, the agony of apprehension, the dull cold sense of\r\ndespair, waxed heavier, and more stunning. The longer he spoke, the more\r\ncertain he felt that by his own words he was destroying his own hope; yet\r\nhe manned his heart stoutly, resisted the foul tempter, and, firm in the\r\nintegrity of his present purpose, laid bare the secrets of his soul.\r\n\r\nBeginning from his discovery of Medon’s corpse upon the Esquiline, he now\r\nnarrated to her fully all that had passed, including much that in his\r\nprevious tale he had omitted. He told of his first meeting with Cataline\r\nupon the Cælian; of his visit to Cicero; of his strange conversation with\r\nthe cutler Volero; of his second encounter with the traitor in the field\r\nof Mars, not omitting the careless accident by which he revealed to him\r\nVolero’s recognition of the weapon. He told her of the banquet, of the art\r\nwith which Catiline plied him with wine, of the fascinations of that fair\r\nfatal girl. And here, he paused awhile, reluctant to proceed. He would\r\nhave given worlds, had he possessed them, to catch one glance of her\r\naverted eye, to read her features but one moment. But she sat, with her\r\nback toward him, her head downcast, tranquil and motionless, save that a\r\ntremulous shivering at times ran through her frame perceptible.\r\n\r\nHe was compelled perforce to continue his narration; and now he was bound\r\nto confess that, for the moment, he had been so bewitched by the charms of\r\nthe siren, that he had bound himself by the fatal oath, scarce knowing\r\nwhat he swore, which linked him to the fortunes of the villain father.\r\nSlightly he touched on that atrocity of Catiline, by telling which aloud\r\nhe dared not sully her pure ears. He then related clearly and succinctly\r\nthe murder of the cutler Volero, his recognition of the murderer, the\r\nforced deception which he had used reluctantly toward Cicero, and the\r\nsuspicions and distrust of that great man. And here again he paused,\r\nhoping that she would speak, and interrupt him, if it were even to\r\ncondemn, for so at least he should be relieved from the sickening\r\napprehension, which almost choked his voice.\r\n\r\nStill, she was silent, and, in so far as he could judge, more tranquil\r\nthan before. For the quick tremors had now ceased to shake her, and her\r\ntears, he believed, had ceased to flow.\r\n\r\nBut was not this the cold tranquillity of a fixed resolution, the firmness\r\nof a desperate, self-controlling effort?\r\n\r\nHe could endure the doubt no longer. And, in a softer and more humble\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" he said, \"you know the measure of my sin—the extent of my\r\nfalsehood. All the ill of my tale is told, faithfully, frankly. What\r\nremains, is unmixed with evil. Say, then; have I sinned, Julia, beyond the\r\nhope of forgiveness? If to confess that, my eyes dazzled with beauty, my\r\nblood inflamed with wine, my better self drowned in a tide of luxury\r\nunlike aught I had ever known before, my senses wrought upon by every art,\r\nand every fascination—if to confess, that my head was bewildered, my\r\nreason lost its way for a moment—though my heart never, never failed in\r\nits faith—and by the hopes, frail hopes, which I yet cling to of obtaining\r\nyou—the dread of losing you for ever! Julia, by these I swear, my heart\r\nnever did fail or falter! If, I say, to confess this be sufficient, and I\r\nstand thus condemned and lost for ever, spare me the rest—I may as well be\r\nsilent!\"\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, ere she answered; and it was only with an effort,\r\nchoking down a convulsive sob, that she found words at all.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" she said, \"with your tale. I cannot answer you.\"\r\n\r\nBut, catching at her words, with all the elasticity of youthful hope, he\r\nfancied that she _had_ answered him, and cried joyously and eagerly—\r\n\r\n\"Sweet Julia, then you can, you will forgive me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not said so, Paullus,\" she began. But he interrupted her, ere she\r\ncould frame her sentence—\r\n\r\n\"No! dearest; but your speech implied it, and—\"\r\n\r\nBut here, in her turn, she interrupted him, saying—\r\n\r\n\"Then, Paullus, did my speech imply what I did not intend. For I have\r\n_not_ forgiven—do not know if I can forgive, all that has passed. All\r\ndepends on that which is to come. You made me promise not to interrupt\r\nyour tale. I have not done so; and, in justice, I have the right to ask\r\nthat you should tell it out, before you claim my final answer. So I say,\r\nonce again, Proceed.\"\r\n\r\nUnable, from the steadiness of her demeanour, so much even as to\r\nconjecture what were her present feelings, yet much dispirited at finding\r\nhis mistake, the young man proceeded with his narrative. Gaining courage,\r\nhowever, as he continued speaking, the principal difficulties of his story\r\nbeing past, he warmed and spoke more feelingly, more eloquently, with\r\nevery word he uttered.\r\n\r\nHe told her of the deep depression, which had fallen on him the following\r\nmorning, when her letter had called him to the house of Hortensia. He\r\nagain related the attack made on him by Catiline, on the same evening, in\r\nEgeria’s grotto; and spoke of the absolute despair, in which he was\r\nplunged, seeing the better course, yet unable to pursue it; aiming at\r\nvirtue, yet forced by his fatal oath to follow vice; marking clearly\r\nbefore him the beacon light of happiness and honour, yet driven\r\nirresistibly into the gulf of misery, crime, and destruction. He told her\r\nof Lucia’s visit to his house; how she released him from his fatal oath!\r\ndisclaimed all right to his affection, nay! to his respect, even, and\r\nesteem! encouraged him to hold honour in his eye, and in the scorn of\r\nconsequence to follow virtue for its own sake! He told her, too, of the\r\nconspiracy, in all its terrible details of atrocity and guilt—that dark\r\nand hideous scheme of treason, cruelty, lust, horror, from which he had\r\nhimself escaped so narrowly.\r\n\r\nThen, with a glow of conscious rectitude, he proved to her that he had\r\nindeed repented; that he was now, howsoever he might have been deceived\r\ninto error and to the brink of crime, firm, and resolved; a champion of\r\nthe right; a defender of his country; trusted and chosen by the Great\r\nConsul; and, in proof of that trust, commissioned by him now to lead his\r\ntroop of horsemen to Præneste, a strong fortress, near at hand, which\r\nthere was reason to expect might be assailed by the conspirators.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my tale is ended,\" he said. \"I did hope there would have been no\r\nneed to reveal these things to you; but from the first, I have been\r\nresolved, if need were, to open to you my whole heart—to show you its dark\r\nspots, as its bright ones. I have sinned, Julia, deeply, against you! Your\r\npurity, your love, should have guarded me! Yet, in a moment of treacherous\r\nself-confidence, my head grew dizzy, and I fell. But oh! believe me,\r\nJulia, my heart never once betrayed you! Now say—can you pardon me—trust\r\nme—love me—be mine, as you promised? If not—speed me on my way, and my\r\nfirst battle-field shall prove my truth to Rome and Julia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! this is very sad, my Paullus,\" she replied; \"very humiliating—very,\r\nvery bitter. I had a trust so perfect in your love. I could as soon have\r\nbelieved the sunflower would forget to turn to the day-god, as that Paul\r\nwould forget Julia. I had a confidence so high, so noble, in your proud,\r\nuntouched virtue. And yet I find, that at the first alluring glance of a\r\nfrail beauty, you fall off from your truth to me—at the first whispering\r\ntemptation of a demon, you half fall off from patriotism—honour—virtue!\r\nForgive you, Paullus! I can forgive you readily. For well, alas! I know\r\nthat the best of us all are very frail, and prone to evil. Love you? alas!\r\nfor me, I do as much as ever—but say, yourself, how can I trust you? how\r\ncan I be yours? when the next moment you may fall again into temptation,\r\nagain yield to it. And then, what would then remain to the wretched Julia,\r\nbut a most miserable life, and an untimely grave?\"\r\n\r\nThe proud man bowed his head in bitter anguish; he buried his face in his\r\nhands; he gasped, and almost groaned aloud, in his great agony. His heart\r\nconfessed the truth of all her words, and it was long ere he could answer\r\nher. Perhaps he would not have collected courage to do so at all, but\r\nwould have risen in his agony of pride and despair, and gone his way to\r\ndie, heart-broken, hopeless, a lost man.\r\n\r\nBut she—for her heart yearned to her lover—arose and crossed the room with\r\nnoiseless step to the spot where he sat, and laid her fair hand gently on\r\nhis shoulder, and whispered in her voice of silvery music,\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Paullus, how can I trust you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have told you all this, truly! Think you I had humbled myself\r\nthus, had I not been firm to resist? think you I have had no temptation to\r\ndeceive you, to keep back a part, to palliate? and lo! I have told you\r\nall—the shameful, naked truth! How can I ever be so bribed again to\r\nfalsehood, as I have been in this last hour, by hope of winning, and by\r\ndread of losing you, my soul’s idol? Because I have been true, now to the\r\nlast, I think that you may trust me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, Paullus?\" she said, with a soft sad smile, yet suffering\r\nhim to retain the little hand he had imprisoned while he was\r\nspeaking—\"very, very sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you believe me, Julia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be true hereafter, Paullus?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all—\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay! swear not by the Gods,\" she interrupted him; \"they say the Gods\r\nlaugh at the perjury of lovers! But oh! remember, Paullus, that if you\r\nwere indeed untrue to Julia, she could but die!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her to his heart, and she for once resisted not; and, for the\r\nfirst time permitted, his lips were pressed to hers in a long, chaste,\r\nholy kiss.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he said, \"my own, own Julia, I must say fare you well. My horse\r\nawaits me at your door—my troopers are half the way hence to Præneste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay!\" she replied, blushing deeply, \"but you will surely see Hortensia,\r\nere you go.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be, then, but for a moment,\" he answered. \"For duty calls me; and\r\n_you_ must not tempt me to break my new-born resolution. But say, Julia,\r\nwill you tell all these things to Hortensia?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and laid her hand upon his mouth; but he kissed it, and drew\r\nit down by gentle force, and repeated his question,\r\n\r\n\"Will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word of it, Paul. Do you think me so foolish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will—one day, but not now. Meanwhile, let us go seek for her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, passing his arm around her slender waist, he led her gently from the\r\nscene of so many doubts and fears, of so much happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Most potent, grave, and reverend Seniors.\r\n                    OTHELLO.\r\n\r\nThe second morning had arrived, after that regularly appointed for the\r\nConsular elections.\r\n\r\nNo tumult had occurred, nor any overt act to justify the apprehensions of\r\nthe people; yet had those apprehensions in no wise abated. The very\r\nindistinctness of the rumored terror perhaps increased its weight; and so\r\nwide-spread was the vague alarm, so prevalent the dread and excitement,\r\nthat in the haggard eyes and pale faces of the frustrated conspirators,\r\nthere was little, if anything, to call attention; for whose features wore\r\ntheir natural expression, during those fearful days, each moment of which\r\nmight bring forth massacre and conflagration? Whose, but the great\r\nConsul’s?\r\n\r\nThe second morning had arrived; and the broad orb of the newly risen sun,\r\nlurid and larger than his wont, as it struggled through the misty haze of\r\nthe Italian autumn, had scarcely gained sufficient altitude to throw its\r\nbeams over the woody crest of the Esquiline into the hollow of the Sacred\r\nWay.\r\n\r\nThe slant light fell, however, full on the splendid terraces and shrines\r\nof the many-templed Palatine, playing upon their stately porticoes, and\r\ntipping their rich capitals with golden lustre.\r\n\r\nAnd at that early hour, the ancient hill was thronged with busy\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was at hand—the Senate was in solemn session. The knights were\r\ngathered in their force, all armed. The younger members of the patrician\r\nhouses were mustered with their clients. The fasces of the lictors\r\ndisplayed the broad heads of the axes glittering above the rods, which\r\nbound them—the axes, never borne in time of peace, or within the city\r\nwalls, save upon strange emergency.\r\n\r\nIn the old temple of Jupiter Stator, chosen on this occasion for the\r\nstrength of its position, standing on the very brink of the steep\r\ndeclivity of the hill where it overlooked the great Roman forum, that\r\ngrand assembly sate in grave deliberation.\r\n\r\nThe scene was worthy of the actors, as were the actors of the strange\r\ntragedy in process.\r\n\r\nIt was the cella, or great circular space of the inner temple. The brazen\r\ndoors of this huge hall, facing the west, as was usual in all Roman\r\ntemples, were thrown open; and without these, on the portico, yet so\r\nplaced that they could hear every word that passed within the building,\r\nsat on their benches, five on each side of the door, the ten tribunes(19)\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nWithin the great space, surrounded by a double peristyle of tall Tuscan\r\ncolumns, and roofed by a vast dome, richly carved and gilded, but with a\r\ncircular opening at the summit, through which a flood of light streamed\r\ndown on the assembled magnates, the Senate was in session.\r\n\r\nImmediately facing the doors stood the old Statue of the God, as old, it\r\nwas believed by some, as the days of Romulus, with the high altar at its\r\nbase, hung round with votive wreaths, and glittering with ornaments of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nAround this altar were grouped the augurs, each clad, as was usual on\r\noccasions of high solemnity, in his _trabea_, or robe of horizontal\r\nstripes, in white and purple; each holding in his hand his _lituus_, a\r\ncrooked staff whereby to designate the temples of the heaven, in which to\r\nobserve the omens.\r\n\r\nOn every side of the circumference, except that occupied by the altar and\r\nthe idol, were ranged in circular state the benches of the order.\r\n\r\nImmediately to the right of the altar, were placed the curule chairs, rich\r\nwith carved ivory and crimson cushions, of the two consuls; and behind\r\nthem, erect, with their shouldered axes, stood the stout lictors.\r\n\r\nCicero, as the first chosen of the consuls, sat next the statue of the\r\nGod; calm in his outward mien, as the severe and placid features of the\r\nmarble deity, although within him the soul labored mightily, big with the\r\nfate of Rome. Next him Antonius, a stout, bold, sensual-looking soldier,\r\nfilled his place—worthily, indeed, so far as stature, mien, and bearing\r\nwere concerned; but with a singular expression in his eye, which seemed to\r\nindicate embarrassment, perhaps apprehension.\r\n\r\nAfter these, the presiding officers of the Republic, were present, each\r\naccording to his rank, the conscript fathers—first, the Prince of the\r\nSenate, and then the Consulars, Censorians, and Prætorians, down to those\r\nwho had filled the lowest office of the state, that of Quæstor, which gave\r\nits occupant, after his term of occupancy expired, admission to the grand\r\nrepresentative assembly of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nFor much as there has been written on all sides of this subject, there now\r\nremains no doubt that, from the earliest to the latest age of Rome, the\r\nSenate was strictly, although an aristocratical, still an elective\r\nrepresentative assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Censors, themselves, elected by the Patricians out of their own order,\r\nin the assembly of the Curiæ, had the appointment of the Senators; but\r\nfrom those only who had filled one of the magistracies, all of which were\r\nconferred by the popular vote of the assembly of the centuries; and all of\r\nwhich, at this period of the Republic, might be, and sometimes were,\r\nconferred on Plebeians—as in the case of Marius, six times elected Consul\r\nin spite of Patrician opposition.\r\n\r\nSuch was the constitution of the Senate, purely elective, though like all\r\nother portions of the Roman constitution, under such checks and balances\r\nas were deemed sufficient to ensure it from becoming a democratical\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nAnd such, in fact, it never did become. For having been at first an\r\nelective body chosen from an hereditary aristocracy, it was at that time,\r\nsave in the varying principles of individuals, wholly aristocratic in its\r\nnature. Nor, after the tenure of the various magistracies, which conferred\r\neligibility to the Senate, was thrown open to the plebeians, did any great\r\nchange follow; since the preponderance of patrician influence in the\r\nassembly of the centuries, and the force perhaps of old habit, combined to\r\ncontinue most of the high offices of state in the hands of members of the\r\nOld Houses. Again, when plebeians were raised to office, and became, as\r\nthey were styled, New Men, they speedily were merged in the nobility; and\r\nwere no less aristocratic in their measures, than the oldest members of\r\nthe aristocracy.\r\n\r\nFor when have plebeians, anywhere, when elevated to superior rank, been\r\ntrue to their origin; been other than the fellest persecutors of\r\nplebeians?\r\n\r\nThe senate was therefore still, as it had been, a calm and conservative\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nIt was not indeed, what it had been, before Marius first, and then Sylla,\r\nthe avenger, had decimated it of their foes with the sword; and filled the\r\nvacancies with unworthy friends and partizans.\r\n\r\nYet it was still a grand, a wise, a noble body—when viewed as a body—and,\r\nfor the most part, its decisions were worthy of its dignity and power—were\r\nsage, conservative, and patriotic.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, all motives had conspired to produce a full house;\r\ndoubt, anger, fear, excitement, curiosity, the love of country, the strong\r\nsense of right, the fiery impulses of interest, hate, vengeance, had urged\r\nall men of all parties, to be participants in the eventful business of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAbout five hundred senators were present; men of all ages from thirty-two\r\nyears(20) upward—that being the earliest at which a man could fill this\r\neminent seat. But the majority were of those, who having passed the prime\r\nof active life, might be considered to have reached the highest of mental\r\npower and capacity, removed alike from the greenness of inconsiderate\r\nyouth, and the imbecility of extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThe rare beauty of the Italian race—the strength and symmetry of the\r\nunrivalled warrior nation, of which these were, for the most part, the\r\nnoblest and most striking specimens; the grand flow of the snow-white\r\ndraperies, faced with the broad crimson laticlave—the classic grace of\r\ntheir positions—the absence of all rigid angular lines, of anything mean\r\nor meagre, fantastic or tawdry in the garb of the solemn concourse,\r\nrendered the meeting of Rome’s Fathers a widely different spectacle from\r\nthe convention of any other representative assembly, the world has ever\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nThere was no flippancy, no affectation, no light converse—The members,\r\nyoung or old, had come thither to perform a great duty, in strength of\r\npurpose, singleness of spirit—and all felt deeply the weight of the\r\npresent moment, the vastness of the interests concerned. The good and the\r\ntrue were there convened to defend the majesty, perhaps the safety, of\r\ntheir country—the wicked to strive for interest, for revenge, for life\r\nitself!\r\n\r\nFor Catiline well knew, and had instilled his knowledge carefully into the\r\nminds of his confederates, that now to conquer was indeed to triumph; that\r\nnow to be defeated was to fail, probably, forever—to die, it was most\r\nlike, by the dread doom of the Tarpeian.\r\n\r\nNot one of the conspirators but was in his appointed place, firm,\r\nseemingly unconscious, and unruffled; and as the eye of the great consul\r\nglanced from one to another of that guilty throng, he could not, even amid\r\nhis detestation of their crimes, but admire the cool hardihood with which\r\nthey sat unmoved on the brink of destruction; could not but think, within\r\nhimself, how vast the good that might be wrought by such resolution, under\r\na virtuous leader, and in an upright cause. Catiline noticed the glance;\r\nand as he marked it run along the crowded benches, dwelling a moment on\r\nthe face of each one of his own confederates, he saw in an instant, that\r\nall was discovered; and, as he saw, resolved that since craft had failed\r\nto conceal, henceforth he would trust audacity alone to carry out his\r\ndetected villainy.\r\n\r\nBut now the augurs had performed their rites; the day was pronounced\r\nfortunate; the assembly formal; and nothing more remained, but to proceed\r\nto the business of the moment.\r\n\r\nA little pause ensued, after the sanction of the augurs had been given; a\r\nshort space, during which each man drew a deep breath, as though he were\r\naware that ere long he should hear words spoken, that would thrill his\r\nevery nerve with excitement, and hold him breathless with awe and\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was not a voice, not a motion, not the rustling of a garment,\r\nthrough the large building; for every living form was mute, as the marble\r\neffigies around them, with intense expectation.\r\n\r\nEvery eye of conspirator, or patriot, was riveted upon the consul, the new\r\nman of Arpinum.\r\n\r\nHe rose, not unobservant of the general expectation, nor ungratified; for\r\nthat great man, with all his grand genius, solid intellect, sound virtue,\r\nhad one small miserable weakness; he was not proud, but vain; vain beyond\r\nthe feeblest and most craving vanity of womanhood.\r\n\r\nYet now he showed it not—perhaps felt it, in a less degree than usual; it\r\nmight be, it was crushed within him for the time, by the magnitude of vast\r\ninterests, the consciousness of right motives, the necessity of\r\nextraordinary efforts.\r\n\r\nHe rose; advanced a step or two, in front of his curule chair, and in a\r\nclear slow voice gave utterance to the solemn words, which formed the\r\nexordium to all senatorial business.\r\n\r\n\"May this be good, and of good omen, happy, and fortunate to the Roman\r\npeople, the Quirites; which now I lay before you, Fathers, and Conscript\r\nSenators.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, emphatically, with the formula; and then raising his voice a\r\nlittle, and turning his eyes slowly round the house, as if in mute appeal\r\nto all the senators.\r\n\r\n\"For that,\" he said, \"on which you must this day determine, concerns not\r\nthe majesty or magnitude of Rome—the question is not now of insolent foes\r\nto be chastised, or of faithful friends to be rewarded—is not, how the\r\ncity shall be made more beautiful, the state more proud and noble, the\r\nempire more enduring. No, conscript fathers; for the round world has never\r\nseen a city, so flourishing in all rare beauty, so decorated with the\r\nvirtue of her living citizens, so noble in the memories of her dead\r\nheroes—the sun has never shone upon a state, so solidly established; upon\r\nan empire so majestical and mighty; extending from the Herculean columns,\r\nthe far limits of the west, beyond the blue Symplegades; from Hyperborean\r\nsnows, to the parched sands of Ethiopia!—no! Conscript Fathers, for we\r\nhave no foes unsubdued, from the wild azure-tinctured hordes of Gaul to\r\nthe swart Eunuchs of the Pontic king—for we have no friends unrewarded,\r\nunsheltered by the wings of our renown.\r\n\r\n\"No! it is not to beautify, to stablish, to augment—but to preserve the\r\nempire, that I now call upon you; that I now urge you, by all that is\r\nsweet, is sacred, is sublime in the name of our country; that I implore\r\nyou, by whatever earth contains of most awful, and heaven of most holy!\r\n\r\n\"I said to preserve it! And do you ask from whom? Is there a Gallic\r\ntumult? Have Cimbric myriads again scaled the Alps, and poured their\r\nfamished deluge over our devastated frontiers? Hath Mithridates trodden on\r\nthe neck of Pompey? By the great gods! hath Carthage revived from her\r\nashes? is Hannibal, or a greater one than Hannibal, again thundering at\r\nour gates, with Punic engines visible from the Janiculum?\r\n\r\n\"If it were so, I should not despair of Rome—my heart would not throb, as\r\nit now does, nor my voice tremble with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Cisalpine Gaul is tranquil as the vale of Arno! No bow is bended in the\r\nTeutonic forests, unless against the elk or urus! The legions have not\r\nturned their backs before the scymetars of Pontus! The salt sown in the\r\nmarket-place of Carthage hath borne no crop, but desolation. The one-eyed\r\nconqueror is nerveless in the silent grave!\r\n\r\n\"But were all these, now peaceful, subjugated, lifeless, were all these, I\r\nsay, in arms, victorious, present, upon this soil of Italy, around these\r\nwalls of Rome, I should doubt nothing, fear nothing, expect nothing, but\r\npresent strife, and future victory!\r\n\r\n\"There is—there is, that spark of valor, that clear light of Roman virtue,\r\nalive in every heart; yea! even of our maids and matrons, that they would\r\nbrook no hostile step even upon the threshold of our empire!\r\n\r\n\"What then do I foresee? what fear?\r\nMassacre—parricide—conflagration—treason! Treason in Rome itself—in the\r\nForum—in the Campus—_here!_ Here in this holiest and safest spot! Here in\r\nthe shrine of that great God, who, ages since, when this vast Rome was but\r\na mud-built hamlet, that golden capitol, a straw-thatched shed, rolled\r\nback the tide of war, and stablished here, here, where my foot is fixed,\r\nthe immortal seat of empire!\r\n\r\n\"Even now as I turn my eyes around me they fall abhorrent on the faces,\r\nthey read indignant the designs, of their country’s parricides!\r\n\r\n\"Aye! Conscript Fathers, prætorians, patricians of the great old houses, I\r\nsee them in their places here; ready to vote immediately on their own\r\nmonstrous schemes! I see them here, adulterers, forgers of wills,\r\nassassins, spendthrifts, poisoners, defilers of vestal virgins, contemners\r\nof the Gods, parricides of the Republic! I see them, with daggers\r\nsharpened against all true Romans, lurking beneath their fringed and\r\nperfumed tunics! Misled by strange ambition, maddened with lust, drunk\r\nwith despairing guilt, athirst for the blood of citizens!\r\n\r\n\"I see them! you all see them! Will you await in coward apathy, until they\r\nshake you from your lethargy—until the outcries of your murdered children,\r\nof your ravished wives arouse you, until you awake from your sleep and\r\nfind Rome in ashes?\r\n\r\n\"You hear me—you gaze on me in wonder, you ask me with your eyes what it\r\nis that I mean I who are the traitors? Lend me your ears then, and fix\r\nwell your minds, lest they shrink in disgust and wonder. Lend me your ears\r\nonly, and I fear not that you will determine, worthily of yourselves, and\r\nof the Republic!\r\n\r\n\"You all well know that on the 16th day before the calends of November,\r\nwhich should have been the eve of the consular Elections, I promised that\r\nI would soon lay before you ample proofs of the plot, which then I\r\nforetold to you but darkly.\r\n\r\n\"Mark, now, the faces of the men I shall address, and judge whether I then\r\npromised vainly; whether what I shall now disclose craves your severe\r\nattention—your immediate action.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, as if to note the effect of his words; then\r\nturning round abruptly upon the spot, where Catiline sat, writhing with\r\nrage and impatience, and gnawing his nether lip, until the blood trickled\r\ndown his chin, he flung forth his arm with an indignant gesture, and\r\ninstantly addressed him by his name, in tones that rang beneath the\r\nvaulted roof, over the heads of the self-convicted traitors, like heaven’s\r\nown thunder, and found a fearful echo in their dismayed and guilty souls.\r\n\r\n\"Where wert thou, Catiline?\" he thundered forth the charge, amid the mute\r\nastonishment of all—\"Where wert thou on the evening of the Ides? what wert\r\nthou doing? Speak! Unless guilt and despair hold thee silent, I say to\r\nthee, speak, Catiline!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he stopped in mid-speech, as if for an answer, fixed his eye\r\nsteadily on the face of the arch conspirator. But he, though he spoke not\r\nto reply, quailed not, nor shunned that steady gaze, but met it with a\r\nterrible and portentous glare, pregnant with more than mortal hatred.\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt not—can’st not—darest not! Now hear and tremble! Hear, and know\r\nthat no step of thine, or deed, or motion escapes my eye—no, traitor, not\r\none movement!\r\n\r\n\"On the eve of the Ides, thou wert in the street of the Scythemakers! Ha!\r\ndoes thy cheek burn now? In the house of a senator—of Marcus Porcius Læca.\r\nBut thou wert not there, till thou hadst added one more deed of murder to\r\nthose which needed no addition. Thou wert, I say, in the house of Læca;\r\nand many whom I now see around me, with trim and well-curled beards, with\r\nlong-sleeved tunics and air-woven togas, many whom I could name, and will,\r\nif needs be, were there with thee!\r\n\r\n\"What beverage didst thou send around? what oath didst thou administer,\r\nthou to thy foul associates? and on the altar of what God?\r\n\r\n\"Fathers, my mind shrinks, as I speak, with horror—that bowl mantled to\r\nthe brim with the gore of a human victim; those lips reeked with that\r\ndread abomination! His lips, and those of others, fitter to sip voluptuous\r\nnectar from the soft mouths of their noble paramours than to quaff such\r\npollution!\r\n\r\n\"That oath was to destroy Rome, utterly, with fire and the sword, till not\r\none stone should stand upon another, to mark the site of empire!\r\n\r\n\"The silver eagle was the god to whom he swore! The silver eagle, whose\r\nwings were dyed so deep in massacre by Marius—to whom he had a shrine in\r\nhis own house, consecrated by what crimes, adored by what sacrilege, I say\r\nnot!\r\n\r\n\"The consular election was the day fixed; and, had the people met on that\r\nday in the Campus, on that day had Rome ceased to be!\r\n\r\n\"To murder me in my robes of peace, at the Comitia, to murder the consuls\r\nelect, to murder the patricians to a man, was his own task, most congenial\r\nto his own savage nature!\r\n\r\n\"To fire the city in twelve several places was destined to his worthy\r\ncomrades, whose terror my eye now beholds, whose names for the present my\r\ntongue shall not disclose. For I would give them time to repent, to change\r\ntheir frantic purpose, to cast away their sin—oh! that they would do so!\r\noh! that they would have compassion on their prostrate and imploring\r\ncountry—compassion on themselves—on me, who beseech them to turn back, ere\r\nit be too late, to the ways of virtue, happiness, and honor!\r\n\r\n\"But names there are, which I will speak out, for to conceal them would\r\navail nothing, since they have drawn the sword already, and raised the\r\nbanner of rebellion against the majesty of Rome.\r\n\r\n\"Septimius of Camerinum has stirred the slaves even now to a fresh servile\r\nwar! has given out arms! has appointed leaders! by the Gods! has a force\r\non foot in the Picene district! Julius is soliciting the evil spirits of\r\nApulia; and, ere four days have flown, you shall have tidings from the\r\nnorth, that Caius Manlius is in arms at Fæsulæ. Already he commands more\r\nthan two legions; not of raw levies, not of emancipated slaves, or\r\nenfranchised gladiators—though these ere long will swell his host. No!\r\nSylla’s veterans muster under his banner—the same swords gleam around him\r\nwhich conquered the famed Macedonian phalanx at bloody Chæronea, which\r\nstormed the long walls of Piræus, which won Bithynia, Cappadocia,\r\nPaphlagonia, which drove great Mithridates back to his own Pontus!\r\n\r\n\"Nor is this all—for, if frustrated by the postponement of the consular\r\ncomitia, believe not that the rage of the parricide is averted, or his\r\nthirst for the blood of Romans quenched forever.\r\n\r\n\"No, Fathers, he hath but deferred the day; and even now he hath\r\ndetermined on another. The fifth before the calends! Await that day in\r\nquiet, and ye will never rue your apathy. For none of you shall live to\r\nrue it, save those who now smile grimly, conscious of their own desperate\r\nresolve, expectant of your apathy.\r\n\r\n\"Nor is his villainy all told, even now; for so securely and so wisely has\r\nhe laid his plans, that, had not the great Gods interfered and granted it\r\nto me to discover all, he must needs have succeeded! On the night of the\r\ncalends themselves he would have been the master of Præneste, that rich\r\nand inaccessible strong-hold, by a nocturnal escalade! That I myself have\r\nalready made impossible—the magistrates are warned, the free burghers\r\narmed, and the castle garrisoned by true men, and impregnable.\r\n\r\n\"Do ye the like, Fathers and Conscript Senators, and Rome also shall be\r\nsafe, inaccessible, immortal. Give me the powers to save you, and I devote\r\nmy mind, my life. I am here ready to die at this instant—far worse than\r\ndeath to a noble mind, ready to go hence, and be forgotten, if I may\r\nrescue Rome from this unequalled peril!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he ceased speaking for a moment, and many thought that he had\r\nconcluded his oration; but in a second’s space he resumed, in a tone more\r\nspirited and fiery yet, his eyes almost flashing lightning, and his whole\r\nframe appearing to expand, as he confronted the undaunted traitor.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou not now see, Catiline, that in all things thou art my inferior?\r\nDost thou not feel thyself caught, detected like a thief? baffled?\r\ndefeated? beaten? and wilt thou not now lay down thine arms, thy rage, thy\r\nhate, against this innocent republic? wilt thou not liberate me now from\r\ngreat fear, great peril, and great odium?\r\n\r\n\"No! thou wilt not—the time hath flown! thou canst not repent—canst not\r\nforgive, or be forgiven—the Gods have maddened thee to thy destruction—thy\r\ncrimes are full-blown, and ripening fast for harvest—earth is aweary of\r\nthy guilt—Hades yawns to receive thee!\r\n\r\n\"Tremble, then, tremble! Yea! in the depths of thy secret soul—for all\r\nthine eye glares more with hate than terror, and thy lip quivers, not with\r\nremorse but rage—yea! thou dost tremble—for thou dost see, feel, know, thy\r\nschemes, thy confederates, thyself, detected, frustrated, devoted to\r\ndestruction!\r\n\r\n\"Enough! It is for you, my Fathers, to determine; for me to act your\r\npleasure. And if your own souls, your own lives, your own interests, yea!\r\nyour own fears, cry not aloud to rouse you, with a voice stronger than the\r\neternal thunder, why should I seek to warn you? Whom his own, his wife’s,\r\nchildren’s, country’s safety, the glory of his great forefathers, the\r\nveneration of the everlasting Gods awaiting his decision from the\r\ntottering pinnacle of Rome’s capitol—whom all these things excite not to\r\naction—no voice of man, no portent of the Gods themselves can stir to\r\nenergy or valor; and I but waste my words in exhorting you to manhood!\r\n\r\n\"But they _will_ burst the bonds of your long stupor; they _will_\r\nre-kindle, in your hearts, that blaze of Roman virtue, which may sleep for\r\na while, but never can be all extinguished!—and ye _will_ stir yourselves\r\nlike men; ye _will_ save your country! For this thing I do not believe;\r\nthat the immortal Gods would have built up this commonwealth of Rome to\r\nsuch a height of beauty, of glory, of puissance, had they foredoomed it to\r\ndestruction, by hands so base as those now armed against it. Nor, had it\r\nbeen their pleasure to abolish its great name, and make it such as Troy\r\nand Carthage, would they have placed me here, the consul, endowed by\r\nthemselves with power to discern, but with no power to avert destruction!\"\r\n\r\nHis words had done their work. The dismayed blank faces of all the\r\nconspirators, with the exception of the arch traitor only, whom it would\r\nseem that nothing could disconcert or dismay, confirmed the impression\r\nmade upon all minds by that strong appeal. For, though he had mentioned no\r\nman’s name save Catiline’s and Læca’s only, suspicion was called instantly\r\nto those who were their known associates in riot and debauchery; and many\r\neyes were scrutinizing the pale features, which struggled vainly to appear\r\ncalm and unconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the speech was immediate, universal. There were not three\r\nmen of the order present who were not now convinced as fully in their own\r\nminds of the truth of Cicero’s accusation, as they would, had it come\r\nforth in thunder from the cold lips of the marble God, who overlooked\r\ntheir proud assembly.\r\n\r\nThere was a long drawn breath, as he ceased speaking—one, and simultaneous\r\nthrough the whole concourse; and, though there were a few men there,\r\nCrassus, especially, and Caius Julius Cæsar, who, though convinced of the\r\nexistence of conspiracy, would fain have defended the conspirators, in the\r\nexisting state of feeling, they dared not attempt to do so.\r\n\r\nThen Cicero called by name on the Prince of the Senate, enquiring if he\r\nwould speak on the subject before the house, and on receiving from him a\r\ngrave negative gesture, he put the same question to the eldest of the\r\nconsulars, and thence in order, none offering any opinion or showing any\r\nwish to debate, until he came to Marcus Cato. He rose at once to speak,\r\nstern and composed, without the least sign of animation on his impassive\r\nface, without the least attempt at eloquence in his words, or grace in his\r\ngestures; yet it was evident that he was heard with a degree of attention,\r\nwhich proved that the character of the man more than compensated the\r\nunvarnished style and rough phraseology of the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"As it appears to me,\" he said, \"Fathers and Conscript Senators, after the\r\nvery luminous and able oration which our wise consul has this day held\r\nforth, it would be great folly, and great loss of time, to add many words\r\nto it. This I am not about to do, I assure you, but I arise in my place to\r\nsay two things. Cicero has told you that a conspiracy exists, and that\r\nCatiline is the planner, and will be the executor of it. This, though I\r\nknow not by what sagacity or foresight, unless from the Gods, he\r\ndiscovered it—this, I say, I believe confidently, clearly—all things\r\ndeclare it—not least the faces of men! I believe therefore, every word our\r\nconsul has spoken; so do you all, my friends. Nevertheless, it is just and\r\nright, that the man, villain as he may be, shall be heard in his own\r\nbehalf. Let him then speak at once, or confess by his silence! This is the\r\nfirst thing I would say—the next follows it! If he admit, or fail clearly\r\nto disprove his guilt, let us not be wanting to ourselves, to our country,\r\nor to the great and prudent consul, who, if man can, will save us in this\r\ncrisis. Let us, I say, decree forthwith, ’THAT THE CONSULS SEE THE\r\nREPUBLIC TAKES NO HARM!’ and let us hold the consular election to-morrow,\r\non the field of Mars—There, with our magistrates empowered to act, our\r\nclients in arms to defend us, let us see who will dare to disturb the\r\nRoman people! Let who would do so, remember that not all the power or\r\nfavor of Great Marius could rescue Saturninus from the death he owed the\r\npeople—remember that we have a consul no less resolute and vigorous, than\r\nhe is wise and good—that there are axes in the fasces of the Lictors—that\r\nthere stands the Tarpeian!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke, he flung wide both his arms; pointing with this hand to\r\nthe row of glittering blades which shone above the head of the chief\r\nmagistrate, with that, through the open door-way of the temple, to the\r\nbold front of the precipitous and fatal rock, all lighted up by the gay\r\nsunbeams, as it stood fronting them, beyond the hollow Velabrum, crowned\r\nwith the ramparts of the capitol.\r\n\r\nA general hum, as if of assent, followed, and without putting the motion\r\nto the vote, Cicero turned his eye rapidly to every face, and receiving\r\nfrom every senator a slight nod of assent, he looked steadily in the\r\nfierce and ghastly face of the traitor, and said to him;\r\n\r\n\"Arise, Catiline, and speak, if you will!—But take my counsel, confess\r\nyour guilt, go hence, and be forgiven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgiven!\" cried the traitor, furious and desperate—\"Forgiven!—this to a\r\nRoman citizen!—this to a Roman noble! Hear me, Fathers and Conscript\r\nSenators—hear me!—who am a soldier and a man, and neither driveller nor\r\ndotard. I tell you, there is no conspiracy, hath been none, shall be\r\nnone—save in the addled brains of yon prater from Arpinum, who would fain\r\nset his foot upon the neck of Romans. All is, all shall be peace in Rome,\r\nunless the terror of a few dastards drive you to tyranny and persecution,\r\nand from persecution come resistance? For myself, let them who would ruin\r\nme, beware. My hand has never yet failed to protect my head, nor have many\r\nfoes laughed in the end at Sergius Catiline!—unless,\" he added with a\r\nferocious sneer—\"they laughed in their death-pang. For my wrongs past, I\r\nhave had some vengeance; for these, though I behold the axes, though I\r\nsee, whence I stand, the steep Tarpeian, I think I shall have more, and\r\nlive to feast my eyes with the downfall of my foes. Fathers, there are two\r\nbodies in the State, one weak, with a base but crafty head—the other\r\npowerful and vast, but headless. Urge me a little farther, and you shall\r\nfind that a wise and daring head will not be wanting long, to that bold\r\nand puissant body. Urge me, and I will be that head; oppress me, and—\"\r\n\r\nBut insolence such as this, was not tolerable. There was an universal\r\nburst, almost a shout, of indignation from that assembly, the wonted mood\r\nof which was so stern, so cold, so gravely dignified, and silent. Many\r\namong the younger senators sprang to their feet, enraged almost beyond the\r\ncontrol of reason; nor did the bold defiance of the daring traitor, who\r\nstood with his arms folded on his breast, and a malignant sneer of\r\ncontempt on his lip, mocking their impotent displeasure, tend to disarm\r\ntheir wrath.\r\n\r\nFour times he raised his voice, four times a cry of indignation drowned\r\nhis words, and at length, seeing that he could obtain no farther hearing,\r\nhe resumed his seat with an expression fiendishly malignant, and a fierce\r\nimprecation on Rome, and all that it contained.\r\n\r\nAfter a little time, the confusion created by the audacity of that strange\r\nbeing moderated; order and silence were restored, and, upon Cato’s motion,\r\nthe Senate was divided.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the result had Catiline been silent, the majority\r\nwas overwhelming. The very partisans and favorers of the conspiracy, not\r\ndaring to commit themselves more openly, against so strong a\r\nmanifestation, passed over one by one, and voted with the consul.\r\n\r\nCatiline stood alone, against the vote of the whole order. Yet stood and\r\nvoted resolute, as though he had been conscious of the right.\r\n\r\nThe vote was registered, the Senate declared martial law, investing the\r\nconsuls with dictatorial power, by the decree which commanded them to SEE\r\nTHAT THE REPUBLIC TAKES NO HARM.\r\n\r\nThe very tribunes, factious and reckless as they were, potent for ill and\r\npowerless for good, presumed not to interpose. Not even Lucius Bestia,\r\ndeep as he was in the design—Bestia, whose accusation of the consul from\r\nthe rostrum was the concerted signal for the massacre, the\r\nconflagration—not Bestia himself, relied so far on the inviolability of\r\nhis person, as to intrude his VETO.\r\n\r\nThe good cause had prevailed—the good Consul triumphed! The Senate was\r\ndismissed, and as the stream of patrician togas flowed through the temple\r\ndoor conspicuous, the rash and reckless traitor shouldered the mass to and\r\nfro, dividing it as a brave galley under sail divides the murmuring but\r\nunresisting billows.\r\n\r\nOnce in the throng he touched Julius Cæsar’s robe as he brushed onward,\r\nand as he did so, a word fell on his ear in the low harmonious tones which\r\nmarked the orator, second to none in Rome, save Cicero alone!—\r\n\r\n\"Fear not,\" it said—\"another day will come!—\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear!—\" exclaimed the Conspirator in a hoarse cry, half fury, half\r\ncontempt. \"What is fear?—I know not the thing, nor the word!—Go, prate of\r\nfear to Cicero, and he will understand you!\"\r\n\r\nThese words perhaps alienated one who might have served him well.\r\n\r\nBut so it ever is! Even in the shrewdest and most worldly wise of men,\r\npassion will often outweigh interest; and plans, which have been framed\r\nfor years with craft and patience, are often wrecked by the impetuous\r\nrashness of a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

V. Tappulus.\r\n\r\n    7 The _Quinquertium_, the same as the Greek Pentathlon, was a conflict\r\n      in five successive exercises—leaping, the discus, the foot race,\r\n      throwing the spear, and wrestling.\r\n\r\n    8 The _Aqua Crabra_ was a small stream flowing into the Tiber from the\r\n      south-eastward, now called _Maranna_. It entered the walls near the\r\n      Capuan gate, and passing through the _vallis Murcia_ between the\r\n      Aventine and Palatine hills, where it supplied the Circus Maximus\r\n      with water for the _naumachia_, fell into the river above the\r\n      Palatine bridge.\r\n\r\n    9 The _Muræna Helena_, which we commonly translate Lamprey, was a\r\n      sub-genus of the Conger; it was the most prized of all the Roman\r\n      fish, and grew to the weight of twenty-five or thirty pounds. The\r\n      value set upon them was enormous; and it is said that guilty slaves\r\n      were occasionally thrown into their stews, to fatten these voracious\r\n      dainties.\r\n\r\n   10 The aureus was a gold coin, as the name implies, worth twenty-five\r\n      denarii, or about seventeen shillings and nine pence sterling.\r\n\r\n   11 The stylus was a pointed metallic pencil used for tracing letters on\r\n      the waxen surface of the table.\r\n\r\n   12 The cavalry attached to every legion, consisting of three hundred\r\n      men, was divided into ten troops, _turmæ_ of thirty each, which were\r\n      subdivided into decuriæ of ten, commanded by a decurio, the first\r\n      elected of whom was called _dux turmæ_, and led the troop.\r\n\r\n   13 The guests at Roman banquets usually brought their own napkins,\r\n      _mappæ_, and wore robes of bright colors, usually flowered, called\r\n      _cænateriæ_ or _cubitoriæ_.\r\n\r\n   14 Pro certo creditur, necato filio, _vacuam_ domum scelestis nuptiis\r\n      fecisse.\r\n\r\n   15 The Petasus was a broad brimmed hat of felt with a low round crown.\r\n      It was originally an article of the Greek dress, but was adopted by\r\n      the Romans.\r\n\r\n   16 Seven thousand talents, about 7,500,000 dollars.\r\n\r\n   17 The classical reader will perhaps object to the introduction of the\r\n      Alcaic measure at this date, 62 B. C., it being generally believed\r\n      that the Greek measures were first adapted to the Latin tongue by\r\n      Horace, a few years later. The desire of giving a faint idea of the\r\n      rhythm and style of Latin song, will, it is hoped, plead in\r\n      mitigation of this very slight deviation from historical truth—the\r\n      rather that, in spite of Horace’s assertion,\r\n\r\n            Non ante vulgatas per artes\r\n            Verba loquor sociata chordis,\r\n\r\n      it is not certain, that no imitations of the Greek measures existed\r\n      prior to his success.\r\n\r\n   18 The senior consul, or he whose month it was to preside, had twelve\r\n      lictors; the junior but one, while within the city.\r\n\r\n   19 The Tribunes of the people were, at this period of the Republic,\r\n      Senators; the Atinian law, the date of which is not exactly fixed,\r\n      having undoubtedly come into operation soon after B. C. 130. I do\r\n      not, however, find it mentioned, that their seats were thereupon\r\n      transferred into the body of the Senate; and I presume that such was\r\n      not the case; as they were not real senators, but had only the right\r\n      of speaking without voting, as was the case with all who sat by the\r\n      virtue of their offices, without regular election.\r\n\r\n   20 The age of senatorial eligibility is nowhere distinctly named. But\r\n      the quæstorship, the lowest office which gave admission to the\r\n      Curia, required the age of thirty-one in its occupant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author’s footnotes have been moved to the end of the volume.\r\n\r\nThe author uses both \"Cataline\" and \"Catiline\".
