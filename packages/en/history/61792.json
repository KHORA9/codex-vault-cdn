C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the present work is to study what is known of one of\r\nthe most important genres of Greek sculpture—the monuments erected\r\nat Olympia and elsewhere in the Greek world in honor of victorious\r\nathletes at the Olympic games. Since only meagre remnants of these\r\nmonuments have survived, the work is in the main concerned with the\r\nattempt to reconstruct their various types and poses.\r\n\r\nThe source-material on which the attempt is based has been indicated\r\nfully in the text; it is of two kinds, literary and archæological. To\r\nthe former belong the explanatory inscriptions on the bases of victor\r\nstatues found at Olympia and elsewhere, many of which agree verbally\r\nwith epigrams preserved in the _Greek Anthologies_; the incidental\r\nstatements of various kinds and value found in the classical writers\r\nand their scholiasts; and, above all, the detailed works of the two\r\nimperial writers, the elder Pliny and Pausanias. Pliny’s account of\r\nthe Greek artists, which is inserted into his _Historia Naturalis_\r\nas a digression (Books XXXIV-XXXVI)—being artificially joined to the\r\nhistory of mineralogy on the pretext of the materials used—is, despite\r\nits uncritical and often untrustworthy character, one of our chief\r\nmines of information about Greek sculptors and painters. The portions\r\nof Pausanias’ _Description of Greece_ which deal with Elis and the\r\nmonuments of Olympia (Books V-VI), although they also evince little\r\nreal understanding of art, are of far more direct importance to our\r\nsubject, since they include a descriptive catalogue, doubtless based\r\nupon personal observation, of the greater part of the athlete monuments\r\nset up in the Altis at Olympia, the reconstruction of which is the\r\nchief purpose of the present work.\r\n\r\nTo the archæological sources, on the other hand, belong, first and\r\nforemost, the remnants of victor statues in stone and metal which have\r\nlong been garnered in modern museums or have come to light during the\r\nexcavation of the Altis. To this small number I hope I have added at\r\nleast one marble fragment found at Olympia, the head of a statue by\r\nLysippos, the last great sculptor of Greece (Frontispiece and Fig.\r\n69). To this second kind of sources belong also the statue bases just\r\nmentioned, on many of which the extant footmarks enable us to determine\r\nthe poses of the statues themselves which once stood upon them.\r\nFurthermore, an intimate knowledge of Greek athletic sculpture in all\r\nits periods and phases is, of course, essential in treating a problem\r\nof this nature. Here, as in the study of Greek sculpture in general,\r\nwhere the destruction of original masterpieces, apart from the few\r\nwell-known but splendid exceptions, has been complete, we are almost\r\nentirely dependent upon second-hand evidence furnished by the numerous\r\nexisting antique copies and adaptations of lost originals executed in\r\nmarble and bronze by more or less skilled workmen for the Roman market.\r\n\r\nFinally, not only are the innumerable statuettes and small bronzes\r\nsurviving from antiquity of great value in any attempt to reconstruct\r\nthe pose of a given athlete statue, but also the representations\r\nof various athlete figures on every sort of sculptured and painted\r\nwork—vase-paintings, wall-paintings, reliefs, gems, coins, etc.\r\n\r\nBy using all such sources of information, it is possible to attain\r\ntolerable certainty in reconstructing the various types and poses of\r\nthese lost monuments, and in identifying schools of athletic sculpture,\r\nmasters, and even individual statues. But it must be stated at the\r\noutset that such identifications, from the very nature of the problem,\r\nare at best tentative in character. The attempt to see in Roman copies\r\ncertain statues of athletes has often been made by archæologists.\r\nHowever probable such identifications may seem, we must not forget the\r\nsimple fact that up to the present time not a single Roman copy has\r\nbeen conclusively _proved_ to be that of an Olympic victor statue.\r\nOnly as our knowledge of Greek sculpture is gradually extended by\r\ndiscoveries of additional works of art, and by future researches,\r\nwill it be possible to attain an ever greater degree of probability.\r\nThe further identification of these important monuments, as that of\r\nmasterpieces of Greek sculpture generally, will thus remain one of\r\nthe chief problems for the future archæologist. In the present book,\r\nwhere the body of material drawn upon is so immense and the scientific\r\nwritings involved are so voluminous, manifestly the author can lay no\r\nclaim to an exhaustive treatment. With due consciousness of the defects\r\nand shortcomings of the work, he can claim only to have made a small\r\nselection of such works of art as will best illustrate the various\r\ntypes of monuments under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the book is easily seen by a glance at the table of\r\ncontents. After a preliminary chapter on the origin and development\r\nof Greek athletic games in general and on the custom of conferring\r\nathletic prizes on victors, the more specific subject of the work is\r\nintroduced in Chapter II by brief discussions of the more general\r\ncharacteristics common to Olympic victor statues—their size, nudity,\r\nand hair-fashion, their portrait or non-portrait features, and the\r\nstandard of beauty reached by some of them at least, as shown by the\r\næsthetic judgments of certain ancient writers and by the fragmentary\r\noriginals which have survived. The enumeration of these characteristics\r\nis followed by a brief account of the various canons of proportion\r\nassumed to have been used and taught by different schools of sculptors.\r\nThe chapter ends with a more extended account of the little-known but\r\nimportant subject of the assimilation of this class of monuments to\r\nathlete types of gods and heroes.\r\n\r\nIn Chapters III and IV, which are the most important in developing the\r\nproblem of reconstruction, a division has been made into two great\r\nstatuary groups: those in which the victor was represented at rest,\r\nwhere the particular contest was indicated, if indicated at all, by\r\nvery general motives or by particular athletic attributes; and those\r\nin which the victor was represented in movement, _i. e._, in the\r\ncharacteristic pose of the contest in which he won his victory.\r\n\r\nChapter V relates chiefly to the monuments of hippodrome victors, those\r\nin the various chariot-races and horse-races, and ends with a very\r\nbrief notice of non-athlete victor dedications—those of musicians.\r\n\r\nChapter VI gives a stylistic analysis of what are conceived to be\r\ntwo original marble heads from lost victor statues, one of which is\r\nascribed to Lysippos, the great bronze-founder and art-reformer of\r\nthe fourth century B. C., while the other is regarded as an early\r\nHellenistic work of eclectic tendencies. The publication of these\r\nmarble heads and of the oldest-dated victor statue, which is also of\r\nmarble and which is discussed in Chapter VII, reinforced by other\r\nevidence adduced in the latter chapter, overthrows the belief that all\r\nvictor statues were uniformly made of bronze. The publication of the\r\nOlympia head also controverts the usual assumption of archæologists\r\nthat Lysippos worked only in metal. The last chapter is concerned with\r\na topographical study of the original positions in the Altis of the\r\nvarious athlete monuments discussed, and with a list of all the victor\r\nmonuments known to have been erected outside Olympia in various cities\r\nof the ancient world. These last three chapters are based on papers\r\nwhich have already appeared in the _American Journal of Archæology_\r\n(Chapters VI, VII, and the first half of VIII) and in the _Transactions\r\nof the American Philological Association_ (the last half of Chapter\r\nVIII). Permission to use them in the present book has been kindly\r\ngranted to the author by Dr. James A. Paton, former editor-in-chief\r\nof the _American Journal of Archæology_, and by Professor Clarence P.\r\nBill, the secretary of the American Philological Association.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been my aim throughout to present my own views in\r\nregard to the various works of art under discussion, I must, of\r\ncourse, acknowledge that the book is largely based upon the work and\r\nconclusions of preceding scholars who have treated various phases of\r\nthe same subject. It would, however, be unnecessary and even impossible\r\nhere to acknowledge all the works laid directly or indirectly under\r\ncontribution in the composition of the book. Most of these have been\r\nrecorded in the footnotes.\r\n\r\nBut I wish here to express, in a more general way, my indebtedness\r\nto the standard histories of Greek sculpture, by Brunn, Collignon,\r\nGardiner, Lechat, Murray, Overbeck, Richardson, and others, which must\r\nform the foundation of the knowledge of any one who writes on any phase\r\nof the subject. Among these, two have been found especially valuable:\r\nBulle’s _Der schoene Mensch im Altertum_, which is justly noted for\r\nits comprehensive views and sound judgments; and Furtwaengler’s _Die\r\nMeisterwerke der griechischen Plastik_, which, although it has been\r\nknown to English readers in its enlarged edition by Miss Eugénie\r\nSellers for over a quarter of a century, is still prized for its\r\nextensive firsthand knowledge of the monuments and for its brilliant\r\ninductions, even if the latter at times are carried too far.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my greatest debt has been to the excellent volume entitled\r\n_Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals_, by E. Norman Gardiner, M. A.,\r\na scholar whose practical knowledge of modern athletic sports and\r\nwide familiarity with the ancient source material, both literary and\r\nmonumental, has well fitted him to deal afresh with the subject treated\r\nso learnedly over three quarters of a century ago in Krause’s _Die\r\nGymnastik und Agonistik der Hellenen_. I have also constantly drawn\r\nupon Gardiner’s collection of vase-paintings which illustrate athletic\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nI should also note here several other works which have been of great\r\nassistance in writing this book, such as Juethner’s _Ueber antike\r\nTurngeraethe_ and edition of Philostratos’ _de Arte gymnastica_,\r\nReisch’s _Griechische Weihgeschenke_, Rouse’s _Greek Votive Offerings_,\r\nand Foerster’s _Die Sieger in den Olympischen Spielen_. The\r\nchronological list of victors in the latter compilation was, in large\r\npart, the foundation of my earlier work _de olympionicarum Statuis_.\r\n\r\nI have also received most valuable help from the standard catalogues of\r\nmodern museums, _e. g._, those by Amelung, Dickins, Helbig, Kabbadias,\r\nLechat, Richter, de Ridder, Staïs, Svoronos, and especially the\r\nadmirable ones of the classical collections in the British Museum. I\r\nregret that, owing to the recent war, some of the latest catalogues,\r\nthose especially of the smaller foreign museums, have not been\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nFor illustrative matter, I have made no effort to reproduce merely\r\nstriking works of art, but have, for the most part, presented\r\nwell-known works which readily illustrate the problems treated in the\r\ntext. I have availed myself of collections of photographs kindly placed\r\nat my disposal by Professors Herbert E. Everett of the School of Fine\r\nArts of the University of Pennsylvania, D. M. Robinson of the Johns\r\nHopkins University, A. S. Cooley of the Moravian College at Bethlehem,\r\nPennsylvania, and Dr. Mary H. Swindler of Bryn Mawr College. The\r\nvarious collections of plates and the books and journals from which I\r\nhave taken illustrations are duly noted in the List of Illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I wish to thank the following corporations and individuals\r\nfor permission to reproduce plates and text-cuts from the works cited:\r\nthe Council of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies,\r\nof London, for the use of four plates appearing in the _Journal of\r\nHellenic Studies_ (Figs. 44, 54, 55, and 59); the Trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum in London for seven plates from _Marbles and Bronzes\r\nin the British Museum_ (Pls. 7A, 17, 19; Figs. 14, 28, 31, and 35);\r\nProfessor E. A. Gardiner and his publishers, Duckworth and Co., of\r\nLondon, for two plates from _Six Greek Sculptors_ (Pl. 30; Fig. 71);\r\nMr. H. R. Hall, of the British Museum, and his publisher, Philip Lee\r\nWarner, of London, for one from _Aegean Archæology_ (Fig. 1); Professor\r\nAllan Marquand, of Princeton University, for one text-cut from the\r\n_American Journal of Archæology_ (Fig. 49), and Dr. J. M. Paton,\r\nformer editor-in-chief, for three other text-cuts from the same journal\r\n(Figs. 70, 72, 79).\r\n\r\nTo the following I am also indebted for individual photographs: Dr. J.\r\nN. Svoronos, Director of the Numismatic Museum, Athens, Greece, for\r\none of the oldest-dated statues of an Olympic victor (Fig. 79), which\r\nhas already appeared in the _American Journal of Archæology_; Dr. A.\r\nFairbanks, of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for those of the statue\r\nof a Charioteer (?) and of the fragmentary head of the _Oil-pourer_ (Pl.\r\n27; Fig. 23); Dr. Edward Robinson, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\r\nNew York, for those of the fine Kresilæan and Praxitelian heads (Pls.\r\n15, 20), and of the bronze statuette of a diskobolos (Fig. 46); Prof.\r\nAlice Walton, of Wellesley College, for one of the Polykleitan athlete\r\n(Pl. 13); the Director of the Fogg Art Museum of Cambridge, Mass., for\r\nthat of the so-called _Meleager_ (Fig. 77); Dr. S. B. Luce, recently of\r\nthe Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, for photographs of two\r\nvase-paintings showing athletic scenes (Figs. 50, 56), and Dr. Eleanor\r\nF. Rambo, formerly of the same Museum, for a copy of the Knossos\r\nwall-painting (Pl. 1).\r\n\r\nA word might be added as to the spelling of Greek proper names. Since\r\nconsistency in this matter seems unattainable, I have adopted the\r\nmethod outlined in the _British School Annual_ (XV, 1908-09, p. 402),\r\nwhereby the names of persons, places, buildings, festivals, etc., are\r\ntransliterated from the Greek forms, except those which have become a\r\npart of the English language. But even here I have sometimes deviated\r\nfrom the practice of using familiar English forms.\r\n\r\nIn abbreviations of the names of journals (see pages XVI-XIX) I have\r\nlargely conformed with the usage long recommended by the _American\r\nJournal of Archæology._\r\n\r\nFor convenience in identifying the many works of art, discussed or\r\nmentioned in the text and foot-notes, I have constantly referred to\r\nwell-known collections of plates, such as those of Brunn-Bruckmann,\r\nBulle, Rayet, and von Mach. For further convenience, I have also in\r\nmost cases referred to the outline drawings of statues in Reinach’s\r\n_Répertoire de la statuaire grecque et romaine_, and in some cases\r\nto the older ones found in Clarac’s _Musée de sculpture antique et\r\nmoderne_, and in Mueller and Wieseler’s _Denkmaeler der alten Kunst_.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I have the pleasant duty of thanking generally the many\r\nfriends who have given me valuable suggestions and assistance,\r\nespecially Professor Lane Cooper, of Cornell University, for reading\r\nthe proof-sheets of the entire work, and Professor Alfred Emerson, now\r\nof Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my former teacher, for revising the list\r\nof _Corrigenda_.\r\n\r\n  WALTER WOODBURN HYDE.\r\n\r\n  UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n  _Philadelphia,

It was to the physical\r\nvigor of these strangers rather than to the more artistic nature of the\r\nMediterraneans that the later Greeks owed their interest in sports.\r\nAs these invaders settled themselves most firmly in the Peloponnesus,\r\nGreek athletics may be said to be chiefly the product of South Greece.\r\nIt was here that three of the four national festivals grew up—at\r\nOlympia, Nemea, and on the Corinthian Isthmus. It was in the schools of\r\nArgos and Sikyon that athletic sculpture flourished best and in later\r\nGreek history physical exercise was most fully developed among the\r\nDorian Spartans.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORTS IN CRETE.\r\n\r\nCenturies before the Achæan civilization of Greece had bloomed, there\r\ndeveloped among the Minoans of Crete a passion for certain acrobatic\r\nperformances and for gymnastics. These Cretans, though strongly\r\ninfluenced by Egypt and the East, did not borrow their love of sport\r\nfrom outside any more than did the later Achæans. On the walls of the\r\ntombs of Beni-Hasan on the Nile are pictured many athletic sports,\r\nincluding a series of several hundred wrestling groups,[2] but these\r\nsports did not influence, so far as we know, Cretan athletics. At\r\nKnossos bull-grappling seems to have been the national sport, as we\r\nsee from the frescoes on the palace walls. In the absence of the\r\nhorse, which did not appear in early Aegean times in Crete, it is\r\nnot difficult to understand the development of gymnastic sports with\r\nbulls. At Knossos a seal has been found which shows the rude drawing\r\nof a vessel with rowers seated under a canopy, superimposed on which\r\nis drawn the greater portion of a huge horse. In this design, dating\r\nfrom about 1600 B. C. and synchronizing with the earlier part of\r\nthe eighteenth Egyptian dynasty, we doubtless see a graphic way of\r\nindicating the cargo, and consequently a contemporary record, it may\r\nbe, of the first importation of horses from Libya into Crete.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Cretan bull seems to have been a much larger animal than the\r\nspecies found upon the island to-day.[4] Bull-grappling at Knossos\r\nwas the sport of female as well as male toreadors. A fragmentary\r\nrectangular fresco, dating from about 1500 B. C. (Pl. 1), was\r\ndiscovered there by Sir Arthur Evans in 1901 and is now in the Candia\r\nmuseum. It is executed with extraordinary spirit and shows a huge bull\r\nrushing forward with lowered head and tail straight out. A man is in\r\nthe act of turning a somersault on its back, his legs in the air, his\r\narms grasping the bull’s body and his head raised, looking back to the\r\nrear of the animal, where a cowgirl is standing, holding out her arms\r\nto catch his flying figure as soon as his feat is concluded. Another\r\ncowgirl, at the extreme left, seems to be suspended from the bull’s\r\nhorns, which pass under her armpits, while she catches hold further up.\r\nHowever, she is not being tossed, but is taking position preliminary to\r\nleaping over the bull’s back. Both the man and the women wear striped\r\nboots and bracelets; the women are apparently distinguished by their\r\nwhite skin, short drawers, yellow sashes embroidered with red, and the\r\nred-and-blue diadems around their brows.[5] On the opposite wall a\r\nsimilar scene was pictured; among its stucco fragments was found the\r\nrepresentation of the arm and shoulder of a woman grasping a bull by\r\nthe horns. The fragmentary representation of another woman and man was\r\nalso found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 1\r\n\r\nBull-grappling Scene. Wall-painting from Knossos. Museum of Candia.]\r\n\r\nA very similar scene has long been known from a fresco painting from\r\nTiryns, now in Athens.[6] A bull is represented galloping to the left,\r\nwhile a man[7] clings to its horns with his right hand and is swept\r\nalong with one foot lightly touching the bull’s back and the other\r\nswung aloft. Most early writers interpreted this scene as a bull-hunt,\r\nthe artist having drawn the hunter above the bull through ignorance\r\nof perspective. The execution is very inferior, three attempts of the\r\nbungling painter being visible in the painting of the tail and the\r\nfront legs. Others saw in it the representation of an acrobat showing\r\nhis dexterity by leaping upon the back of an animal in full career,\r\nrecalling the description of such a trick in the Iliad, where Ajax is\r\nrepresented as rushing over the plain like a man who, while driving\r\nfour horses, leaps from horse to horse.[8] But this figure must take\r\nits place side by side with the one from Knossos just described as\r\nanother bull-grappling scene. That such sports were not held in the\r\nopen air, but in an enclosed courtyard, is shown by the seal from\r\nPraisos now in the Candia Museum, which depicts a man vaulting on\r\nthe back of a gigantic ox within a paved enclosure.[9] Doubtless the\r\ntheatral areas discovered at Phaistos by the Italian Archæological\r\nMission[10] and at Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans in 1903[11] were not\r\nlarge enough for bull scenes and were used merely for ceremonial\r\ndancing and perhaps for the boxing matches to be described.[12] Similar\r\nacrobats are doubtless to be recognized in the two beautiful ivory\r\nstatuettes, only 11.5 inches in height, of so-called leapers, found\r\nby Dr. Evans at Knossos in 1901.[13] These masterpieces of the late\r\nMinoan II period represent acrobats (one is probably a woman) darting\r\nthrough the air. “The life, the freedom, the _élan_ of these figures is\r\nnothing short of marvellous,” writes Dr. Evans, who calls attention to\r\nthe careful physical training shown in their slender legs and in the\r\nmuscles, even the veins on the back of the hands and the finger-nails\r\nbeing plainly indicated as well as the details of the skinfolds at the\r\njoints. They doubtless formed a part of an ivory model of the bull-ring\r\nand are meant for miniature toreadors, who were hung in the air by\r\nfine gold wires[14] over the backs of ivory bulls who stood on the\r\nsolid ground. The heads of the figures are thrown backwards, a posture\r\nsuitable for such vaulters, but not for leapers or divers. Minoan art\r\nculminated in these statuettes and in certain stucco figures in half\r\nrelief found also at Knossos. Only a few fragments of these reliefs\r\nhave survived, most of which were decorative or architectonic in\r\ncharacter, though among them were also found human _disjecta membra_\r\nin high relief, such as the fragment of a left forearm holding a horn,\r\nand not a pointed vase, as Dr. Evans thought. Here the muscles are well\r\nindicated, though the veins are exaggerated.[15] This fragment may well\r\nbe a part of the same bull-grappling scenes as those in the frescoes,\r\nas also the life-like image of a bull, the details of whose head,\r\nmouth, eyes, and nostrils are full of expression, and whose muscles are\r\nperfectly indicated.\r\n\r\nWhen compared with the monuments described, the similarity of details\r\non the design of the Vapheio cups ornamented in repoussé, the “most\r\nsplendid specimens known of the work of the Minoan goldsmith,”[16]\r\nnever again equalled until the Italian Renaissance, makes it more than\r\npossible that here again we have scenes of bull-grappling rather than\r\nof bull-hunting. On one cup is represented a quiet pastoral scene—a man\r\ntying the legs of a bull with a rope, while two other bulls stand near,\r\namicably licking one another, and a third is quietly grazing. On the\r\nother, however, are represented scenes of a very different character.\r\nIn the centre is a furious bull entangled in a net, which is fastened\r\nto a tree; to the left a figure, doubtless a woman, is holding on to a\r\nbull’s head, while a man has fallen on his head beside the animal, both\r\nman and woman being dressed in the Cretan fashion. A third bull rushes\r\nfuriously by to the right. Most commentators have seen bull-hunting\r\nscenes on both these cups. Thus, on the first cup were represented\r\nthree scenes in the drama of trapping a bull by means of a tame decoy\r\ncow; to the right the bull is starting to go to the rendezvous, while\r\nin the center the bull stands by the cow’s side and to the left he is\r\nfinally trapped and tied.[17] On the other cup the furious animal at\r\nthe left was supposed to have thrown one hunter and to have caught\r\nanother on its horns. But Mosso’s interpretation of this design seems\r\nto be the right one.[18] The two persons struggling with the bull have\r\nno lasso and so can hardly be hunters; besides, if the bull had impaled\r\na hunter with its horns, the hunter would have been represented with\r\nhis head up and not down. The figure is, however, uninjured and holds\r\non with its knee bent over one horn and its shoulder against the other;\r\nit is merely, therefore, intended for a woman acrobat. The net shown\r\nin the centre was never used for hunting wild bulls; more probably it\r\nwas intended as an obstacle in racing. The fallen man has been standing\r\non the netted bull, which, with the gymnast on its back, was expected\r\nto have leaped over the net, but has not succeeded; consequently, the\r\nacrobat has been tumbled over the bull’s head.\r\n\r\nThis ancient Cretan sport seems to have been similar to that known in\r\nThessaly and elsewhere in historical days as τὰ ταυροκαθάψια.[19] A\r\nsurvival of it still persists to our day in certain parts of Italy, as,\r\n_e. g._, in the province of Viterbo.[20]\r\n\r\nAcrobatic feats of various sorts were attractive to the later Greeks\r\nfrom the time of Homer down. We have already mentioned one passage\r\nfrom the Iliad in which a driver of four horses leaps from horse to\r\nhorse in motion. On the shield of Achilles tumblers appeared among the\r\ndancers on the dancing-place.[21] Patroklos ironically remarks over\r\nthe body of Kebriones, as the charioteer falls headlong like a diver\r\nfrom his chariot when hit by a missile, that there are tumblers also\r\namong the Trojans.[22] In later centuries the Athenians evinced a great\r\nattraction to acrobatic feats. The story told of Hippokleides[23]\r\nreveals that high-born Athenians did not disdain to practice them. They\r\nappear to have formed a sort of side-show attraction at the Panathenaic\r\nfestival, as such scenes occur frequently on Attic vases. Thus on an\r\nearly (imitation?) Panathenaic vase from Kameiros in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale in Paris,[24] there is represented behind the driver a man\r\nstanding on the back of a horse, armed with a helmet and two shields,\r\nwhile in front another appears to be balancing himself on a pole.\r\n\r\nBut such acrobatic scenes as those of Crete and later Greece can\r\nnot properly be classed as athletic. They betoken more the love\r\nof excitement than of true sport. The only form of real athletics\r\nrepresented on Minoan monuments, one which was classed in later Greece\r\nas one of the national sports, was that of boxing, which seems to have\r\nbeen the favorite gymnastic contest of the Cretans, as it always was\r\nof the later Greeks. Boxing scenes appear on seals,[25] on a steatite\r\nfragment of a pyxis found in 1901 at Knossos and, in conjunction with\r\na bull-grappling scene, on the so-called _Boxer Vase_ found by the\r\nItalians at Hagia Triada (Fig. 1). The vase is a cone-shaped rhyton\r\nof steatite, 18 inches high, originally overlaid with gold foil. It\r\nbelongs to the best period of Cretan art, late Minoan I.[26] This\r\nvase alone, if no other monumental evidence were at hand, would\r\nsuffice to show the physical prowess and love of sport of the Minoans.\r\nBecause of its scenes of boxing and bull-grappling Mosso calls it\r\n“the most complete monument that we have of gymnastic exercise in the\r\nMediterranean civilization.”[27] The later Greek tradition of the high\r\ndegree of physical development attained by the Cretans is proved by\r\nthis monument.[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—So-called _Boxer Vase_, from Hagia Triada\r\n(Cast). Museum of Candia.]\r\n\r\nThe reliefs are arranged in four horizontal zones.[29] One of these,\r\nthe second from the top, represents a bull-grappling scene, showing\r\ntwo racing bulls, upon the head and horns of one of which a gymnast\r\nhas vaulted (not being tossed and helpless, as most interpreters\r\nthink).[30] The other three represent boxers in all attitudes of\r\nthe prize-ring, hitting, guarding, falling, and even kicking, as in\r\nthe later Greek pankration. Some are victorious, the left arm being\r\nextended on guard and the right drawn back to strike; one (in the\r\ntop zone) is ready to spring, just as Hector was ready to spring on\r\nAchilles;[31] others are prostrate on the ground with their feet in\r\nthe air. The violence of the action recalls the boast of Epeios in the\r\nfamous match in the Iliad that he will break his adversary’s bones.[32]\r\n\r\nThe method of attack by the right arm and defense by the left is the\r\nsame as that formerly used by English pugilists. In the topmost zone\r\nthe combatants wear helmets with visors, cheek-pieces, and horse-hair\r\nplumes, and also shoes; in the third zone down the pugilists also wear\r\nhelmets, though of a different pattern, while the bottom zone shows\r\nfigures, perhaps youths, with bare heads. Some of the boxers appear to\r\nwear boxing-gloves. In the lowest zone we see the well-known feat of\r\nswinging the antagonist up by the legs and throwing him—if we may so\r\nconclude from the contorted position of the vanquished, whose legs are\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nA similar figure appears in relief on the fragment of a pyxis found at\r\nKnossos.[33] A youth with clenched fists stands with left arm extended\r\nas if to ward off a blow, while his right arm is drawn back and rests\r\non his hip; below we see the bent knee of a prostrate figure, evidently\r\nthat of his vanquished opponent. The boxer has a wasp-like waist and\r\nwears a metal girdle. His left leg is well modeled, the muscles not\r\nbeing exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHLETICS IN HOMER.\r\n\r\nWe have evidence, therefore, that the love of sport existed in Crete\r\nas it has existed in all countries since. But the comparatively\r\nunathletic character of the Aegean culture is shown by the complete\r\nabsence of athletic representations—apart from bull-grappling scenes—in\r\nthe art of its last phase at Mycenæ and Tiryns on the mainland.\r\nThis is an independent argument for the view that the civilization\r\nof the mainland was chiefly the product of the old Mediterranean\r\nstock, which was finally conquered by the invading Achæans, who are\r\nrepresented in Homer as skilled gymnasts. In Homer we are immediately\r\nconscious of being in another world, for here we are in an atmosphere\r\nof true athletics, which are fully developed and quite secular in\r\ncharacter.[34] They are, however, wholly spontaneous, for there are as\r\nyet neither meets nor organized training, neither stadia, gymnasia,\r\nnor palæstræ; for such an organization of athletics did not exist\r\nuntil the sixth century B. C. But Homer’s account of the funeral games\r\nof Patroklos is pervaded by a spirit of true athletics and has a\r\nperennial attraction for every lover of sport. Walter Leaf says of the\r\nchariot-race, which is the culminating feature of the description,\r\nthat it is “a piece of narrative as truthful in its characters as\r\nit is dramatic and masterly in description.”[35] Such a description\r\ncould have been composed only by a poet who belonged to a people long\r\nacquainted with athletics and intensely interested in them. Nestor\r\noften speaks of a remoter past, when the gods and heroes contended.\r\nOdysseus says he could not have fought with Herakles nor Eurytos,\r\nheroes of the olden time, “who contended with the immortal gods.” The\r\nHomeric warrior was distinguished from the merchant by his knowledge\r\nof sport. Thus Euryalos of the Phaiakians says in no complimentary\r\ntone to Odysseus: “No truly, stranger, nor do I think thee at all like\r\none that is skilled in games ... rather art thou such an one as comes\r\nand goes in a benched ship, a master of sailors that are merchantmen,\r\none with a memory for his freight, or that hath charge of a cargo\r\nhomeward bound, and of greedily gotten gains.”[36] It is beside the\r\npoint whether the chief passages in the poems which relate to sports\r\nare late in origin or not, even if they are later than 776 B. C., the\r\ntraditional first Olympiad. In any case the later poet merely followed\r\nan older tradition. At the funeral games of Patroklos all the events\r\nare practical in character, the natural amusements of men chiefly\r\ninterested in war. They are, however, not merely military, but are\r\ntruly athletic. The oldest and most aristocratic of all the events\r\ndescribed is the chariot-race—in which the war-chariot is used—the\r\nmonopoly of the nobles then, as it was always later the sport of kings\r\nand the rich.[37] Boxing and wrestling come next in importance, already\r\noccupying the position of preëminence which they hold in the poems of\r\nPindar. The foot-race between Ajax, the son of Oileus, and Odysseus\r\nfollows. Of the last four events, three—the single combat between\r\nAjax and Diomedes, the throwing of the _solos_, and the contest in\r\narchery—are admitted to be late additions. The last event of all, the\r\ncasting of the spear, may be earlier, but we know little about it,\r\nas the contest did not take place, Achilles yielding the first prize\r\nto Agamemnon. Most of these later events are described in a lifeless\r\nmanner and have not the vim and compelling interest of the earlier\r\nones. Indeed the contest in archery seems to be treated with a certain\r\namount of ridicule, which shows the contempt of the great nobles for\r\nso plebeian a sport. The armed contest, though it is pictured in\r\nart certainly as early as the sixth century B. C.,[38] never had a\r\nplace in the later Greek games.[39] Jumping, an important part of the\r\nlater pentathlon, is mentioned but once in the poems, as a feature of\r\nthe sports of the Phaiakians. But the later pentathlon, as Gardiner\r\nsays, is certainly not suggested in Homer’s account, though many have\r\nassumed it,[40] merely because Nestor mentions his former contests at\r\nBouprasion in boxing, in running, in hurling the spear, and in the\r\nchariot-race.[41] This, however, is not the combination of contests\r\nknown much later as the pentathlon, in which the same contestants\r\nhad to compete in the series of events—running, jumping, wrestling,\r\ndiskos-throwing, and javelin-throwing.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF GREEK GAMES IN THE CULT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nIn these games described in the Iliad we see an example of the origin\r\nof the later athletic festivals in the cult of the dead. Homer knows\r\nonly of funeral games[42] and there is no trace in the poems of the\r\nlater athletic meetings held in honor of a god.[43] However, the\r\nassociation of the later games with religious festivals held at stated\r\ntimes can be traced to the games with which the funeral of the Homeric\r\nchief was celebrated. The oldest example of periodic funeral games in\r\nGreece of which we have knowledge were those held in Arkadia in honor\r\nof the dead Azan, the father of Kleitor and son of Arkas, at which\r\nprizes were offered at least for horse-racing.[44]\r\n\r\nThough the origin of the four national religious festivals in Greece—at\r\nOlympia, Delphi, Nemea, and on the Isthmus—is buried in a mass of\r\nconflicting legend, certain writers agree in saying that all of them\r\nwere founded on funeral games, though they were later dedicated to\r\ngods.[45] Thus the Isthmian were instituted in honor of the dead\r\nMelikertes,[46] the Nemean in honor of Opheltes or Archemoros,[47] the\r\nPythian in honor of the slain Python,[48] the Olympian in honor of the\r\nhero Pelops.[49] To both Pindar and Bacchylides the Olympian games\r\nwere associated with the tomb of Pelops; Pausanias, on the other hand,\r\nrecords that the ancient Elean writers ascribed their origin to the\r\nIdæan Herakles of Crete.[50] It was a common tradition that Herakles\r\nfounded the games, some writers saying that it was the Cretan, others\r\nthat it was the Greek hero, the son of Zeus and Alkmena.[51]\r\n\r\nDespite the variation in legends relative to the institution of the\r\nfour national games, we should not doubt the universal tradition that\r\nall were funerary in origin. The tradition is confirmed by many lines\r\nof argument: by the survival of funeral customs in their later rituals,\r\nby the later custom of instituting funeral games in honor of dead\r\nwarriors both in antiquity and in modern times, and by the testimony of\r\nearly athletic art in Greece.[52] We shall now briefly consider these\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the survival of funeral customs in later ritual,\r\nPausanias says that the annual officers at Olympia, even in his day,\r\nsacrificed a black ram to Pelops.[53] The fact that a black victim was\r\noffered over a trench instead of on an altar proves that Pelops was\r\nstill worshipped as a hero and not as a god. The scholiast on Pindar,\r\n_Ol._, I, 146, says that all Peloponnesian lads each year lashed\r\nthemselves on the grave of Pelops until the blood ran down their backs\r\nas a libation to the hero. Furthermore, all the contestants at Olympia\r\nsacrificed first to Pelops and then to Zeus.[54]\r\n\r\nFuneral games were held in honor of departed warriors and eminent\r\nmen all over the Greek world and at all periods, from the legendary\r\ngames of Patroklos and Pelias and others to those celebrated at\r\nThessalonika in Valerian’s time.[55] Thus Miltiades was honored by\r\ngames on the Thracian Chersonesus,[56] Leonidas and Pausanias at\r\nSparta,[57] Brasidas at Amphipolis,[58] Timoleon at Syracuse,[59] and\r\nMausolos at Halikarnassos.[60] Alexander instituted games in honor\r\nof the dead Hephaistion[61] and the conqueror himself was honored\r\nin a similar way.[62] The _Eleutheria_ were celebrated at Platæa at\r\nstated times in honor of the soldiers who fell there against the\r\nMedes in 479 B. C.,[63] and in the Academy a festival was held under\r\nthe direction of the polemarch in honor of the Athenian soldiers who\r\nhad died for their country and were buried in the Kerameikos.[64]\r\nFuneral games were also common in Italy. We find athletic scenes\r\ndecorating Etruscan tombs—including boxing, wrestling, horse-racing,\r\nand chariot-racing.[65] The Romans borrowed their funeral games from\r\nEtruria as well as their gladiatorial shows, which were doubtless\r\nalso funerary in origin.[66] Frazer cites examples of the custom of\r\ninstituting games in honor of dead warriors among many modern peoples,\r\nCircassians, Chewsurs of the Caucasus, Siamese, Kirghiz, in India, and\r\namong the North American Indian tribes. Gardiner notes the Irish fairs\r\nin honor of a departed chief, which existed from pagan days down to the\r\nlast century.[67]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of early Greek athletic art also points to the same\r\nfunerary origin of the games. The funeral games of Pelias and those\r\nheld by Akastos in honor of his father were depicted respectively\r\non the two most famous monuments of early Greek decorative art, on\r\nthe chest of Kypselos dedicated in the Heraion at Olympia and on\r\nthe throne of Apollo at Amyklai in Lakonia, the latter being the\r\nwork of the Ionian sculptor Bathykles. Though both these works are\r\nlost, the description of one of them at least, that of the chest, by\r\nPausanias,[68] is so detailed and precise that the scenes represented\r\nupon it have been paralleled figure for figure on early Ionian\r\n(especially Chalkidian) and Corinthian vases, contemporary or later,\r\nand on Corinthian and Argive decorative bronze reliefs. Many attempts\r\nhave been made, therefore, to restore the chest, and as more monuments\r\nbecome known, which throw light on the composition and types, these\r\nattempts are constantly growing in certainty, even though conjecture\r\nmay continue to enter in.[69]\r\n\r\nThe figures were wrought in relief, partly in ivory and gold and partly\r\nin the cedar wood itself, deployed on its surface in a series of bands,\r\nsuch as we commonly see on early vases. This use of gold and ivory is\r\nthe first example in Greek art of the custom employed by Pheidias and\r\nother sculptors of the great age of Greek sculpture. We have already\r\nnoted its use in the ivory acrobats from Crete, which were made,\r\nperhaps, a thousand years before the chest.[70] Out of the thirty-three\r\nscenes depicted on its surface all but two or three were mythological,\r\nand among these were scenes from the funeral games of Pelias, including\r\na two-horse chariot-race (P., §9), a boxing and wrestling match (§10),\r\na foot-race, quoit-throwing, and a victor represented as being crowned\r\n(§10), and prize tripods (§11).\r\n\r\nThe most valuable parallel to some of the scenes described by Pausanias\r\nis found on the Amphiaraos vase in Berlin,[71] dating from the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., on which the wrestling match and chariot-race correspond\r\nsurprisingly well with the descriptions of Pausanias, despite certain\r\ndifferences in detail. Another archaic vase depicts a two-horse\r\nchariot-race and the parting of Amphiaraos and Eriphyle.[72] The scenes\r\non this latter vase appear to have been copied from those on the chest,\r\nand it is possible that the scenes on the Berlin vase had the same\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nFuneral games are commonly pictured on early vases. Thus on a\r\nproto-Attic amphora, discovered by the British School of Athens in\r\nexcavating the Gymnasion of Kynosarges, there are groups of wrestlers\r\nand chariot-racers. The wrestling bout here, however, seems to be to\r\nthe death, as the victor has his adversary by the throat with both\r\nhands. It may be a mythological scene, perhaps representing the bout\r\nbetween Herakles and Antaios. A still earlier representation of funeral\r\ngames is shown by a Dipylon geometric vase from the Akropolis now in\r\nCopenhagen, dating back possibly to the eighth century B. C.[73] On\r\none side two nude men, who have grasped each other by the arms, are\r\nready to stab one another with swords. This may represent, however,\r\nas Gardiner suggests, only a mimic contest. On the other side are two\r\nboxers standing between groups of warriors and dancers. A similar\r\nscene in repoussé appears on a Cypriote silver vase from Etruria now\r\nin the Uffizi in Florence.[74] We should also, in this connection,\r\nnote again the reliefs representing funeral games, which appear on\r\nthe sixth-century sarcophagus from Klazomenai already mentioned.[75]\r\nHere is represented a combat of armed men; amid chariots stand groups\r\nof men armed with helmets, shields, and spears, while flute-players\r\nstand between them; at either end is a pillar with a prize vase upon\r\nit; against one leans a naked man with a staff, doubtless intended to\r\nrepresent the spirit of the deceased in whose honor the games are being\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nGames in honor of the dead tended to become periodic. The tomb of the\r\nhonored warriors became a rallying-point for neighboring people,\r\nwho would convene to see the games. While some of these games were\r\ndestined never to transcend local importance, others developed\r\ninto the Panhellenic festivals. As the worship of ancestors became\r\nmetamorphosed into that of heroes, the games became part of hero cults,\r\nwhich antedated those of the Olympian gods. But as the gods gradually\r\nsuperseded the heroes in the popular religion, they usurped the\r\nsanctuaries and the games held there, which had long been a part of the\r\nearlier worship. We are not here concerned, however, with the difficult\r\nquestion of the origin of funeral games. They may have taken the place\r\nof earlier human sacrifices, which would explain the armed fight at the\r\ngames of Patroklos and its appearance on archaic vases and sarcophagi;\r\nor they may have commemorated early contests of succession, which\r\nwould explain many mythical contests like the chariot-race between\r\nPelops and Oinomaos for Hippodameia, or the wrestling match between\r\nZeus and Kronos. In any case such games would never have attained the\r\nimportance which they did attain in Greece, if it had not been for\r\nthe athletic spirit and love of competition so characteristic of the\r\nHellenic race. Whatever their origin, therefore, there is little doubt\r\nthat out of them developed the great games of historic Greece. The\r\nconstant relationship between Greek religion and Greek athletics can be\r\nexplained in no other way.[76]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF THE FOUR NATIONAL GAMES.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the sixth century B. C. the athletic spirit\r\ndisplayed in the Homeric poems had given rise to the four national\r\nfestivals—at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and on the Isthmus. On these\r\nfour, many lesser games were modeled.[77] The origin of all these, as\r\nwe have already remarked, is lost in a mass of legend. The myths of\r\nthe origin of Olympia are particularly conflicting. We are practically\r\ncertain, however, that Olympia as a sanctuary preceded the advent of\r\nthe Achæans into the Peloponnesus, and that the foundation of the games\r\npreceded the coming of the Dorians, but was probably later than that\r\nof the Achæans. The importance of the games dates from the time after\r\nthe Dorian invasion of the Peloponnesus, when the warring peoples\r\nfinally became pacified.[78] For centuries Olympia was overshadowed by\r\nDelphi and the Ionian festival on Delos. The importance of the latter\r\nfestival in the eighth and seventh centuries B. C. is shown by the\r\nHomeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo. Only by the beginning of the seventh\r\ncentury had Olympia begun to gain its prestige. The pre-Dorian Pisatai,\r\nin whose territory the sanctuary was situated, probably controlled\r\nit early. The Dorian allies, the Eleans, whom legend had King Oxylos\r\nlead into the Peloponnesus from Aitolia,[79] tried to wrest this\r\ncontrol from the Pisatai, who, however, aided by religious reverence\r\nfor the sanctuary, were able to maintain their rights. On account of\r\nthe conflict the games languished, until finally a truce was made by\r\nthe two factions and the games were re-established under their common\r\nmanagement. This work was ascribed to Iphitos and Kleosthenes, kings\r\nrespectively of Elis and Pisa, and to Lykourgos of Sparta.[80] The dual\r\ncontrol was not successful, as the jealous Pisatai constantly tried\r\nto regain their old honor; but the Eleans, supported by the Spartans,\r\nprevailed and finally, after the Persian wars, destroyed Pisa and the\r\nother revolting cities of Triphylia and henceforth remained in sole\r\ncontrol. The restoration of the games under Iphitos and his colleagues\r\ntook place in 776 B. C., from which date the festival was celebrated\r\nevery fourth year, until it was finally abolished by the Roman emperor\r\nTheodosius at the end of the fourth century A. D. In 776 Koroibos of\r\nElis won the foot-race and this was the first dated Olympiad in the\r\nOlympian register,[81] and from it, as Pausanias says,[82] the unbroken\r\ntradition of the Olympiads began. This history of Olympia is very\r\ndifferent from the orthodox mythical story told by Pausanias and Strabo\r\nand based on the “ancient writings of the Eleans.”[83] According to it\r\nthe games were originally instituted by the Eleans under Oxylos and\r\nrefounded by Iphitos, his descendant, together with Lykourgos, still\r\nunder the management of the Eleans. In Ol. 8 the Pisatans invoked the\r\naid of the Argive king Pheidon and dispossessed the Eleans, but they\r\nlost the control of Olympia in the next Olympiad. In Ol. 28 Elis,\r\nduring a war with Dyme, allowed the Pisatans to celebrate the games.\r\nSix Olympiads later the king of Pisa came to Olympia with an army\r\nand took charge. The story leaves the Pisatans in control from about\r\nOlympiads 30 to 51, but some time between Ols. 48 and 52 the Eleans\r\ndefeated Pisa and destroyed it, and henceforth controlled the games.\r\nSuch a story was manifestly a contrivance by the later priests of\r\nElis to justify their control of the games through a prior claim. It\r\nis contradicted by all the evidence.[84] The antiquity of Olympia is\r\nknown to us from the results of excavations and from its religious\r\nhistory. The latest excavations on the site have disclosed the remains\r\nof six prehistoric buildings with apsidal endings, below the geometric\r\nstratum, upon the site of what used to be considered the remnants of\r\nthe great altar of Zeus.[85] Such an inference is borne out by many\r\nprimitive features in the religious history of the sanctuary. The altar\r\nof Kronos on the hill to the north of the Altis was earlier than that\r\nof Zeus; an earth altar antedated that of Zeus, while a survival of the\r\nearlier worship of the powers of the underworld is seen in the custom,\r\nlasting through later centuries, of allowing only one woman, the\r\npriestess of Demeter Chamyne, to witness the games. We also know that\r\nthe worship of the Pelasgian Hera antedated that of the Hellenic Zeus;\r\nher temple, the Heraion, is the most ancient of which the foundations\r\nstill stand, a temple built of stone, wood, and sun-dried bricks, whose\r\norigin is to be referred to the tenth, if not to the eleventh, century\r\nB. C.[86] We have already remarked that the worship of the hero Pelops\r\npreceded that of the god Zeus.[87] All such indications attest the high\r\nantiquity of Olympia. That it is not mentioned in Homer, while Delphi\r\nand Dodona are, only proves that in the poet’s time it was still merely\r\na local shrine. Not until the beginning of the sixth century B. C. did\r\nit attain the distinction, which it retained ever afterwards, of being\r\nthe foremost national festival of Hellas.[88]\r\n\r\nThe periodical celebration of the three other national festivals was\r\nnot dated—except in legend—before the early years of the sixth century\r\nB. C., though local festivals must have existed also on these sites\r\nlong before.[89] The old music festival at Delphi, which finally was\r\nheld every eight years,[90] was changed in 586 B. C., in consequence of\r\nthe Sacred War,[91] into a Panhellenic festival celebrated thereafter\r\nevery four years (_pentaëteris_). It was under the presidency of the\r\nAmphiktyonic League, which introduced athletic and equestrian events\r\ncopied from those at Olympia[92] and replaced the older money prizes\r\nwith the simple bay wreath. About the same time the Nemean and Isthmian\r\ngames were instituted. The local games at Nemea, said to have been\r\nfounded by Adrastos in honor of a child, were reorganized some time\r\nbefore 573 B. C., the first Nemead.[93] Thereafter they were celebrated\r\nevery two years, in the second and fourth of the corresponding\r\nOlympiads.[94] They were administered in honor of Zeus by the small\r\ntown of Kleonai under Argive influence. The games were transferred to\r\nArgos some time between 460 B. C. and the close of the third century B.\r\nC. Centuries later, Hadrian revived the prestige of the games at Argos.\r\nThe games held on the Isthmus also originated as an old local festival,\r\nwhich was revived in 586 or 582 B. C. We are not sure whether they\r\nwere refounded in Poseidon’s honor by Periandros or after the death of\r\nPsammetichos in commemoration of the ending of the tyranny at Corinth.\r\nThe geographical location of Corinth, the meeting-place of East and\r\nWest, involved it in many wars, and therefore the Isthmian games never\r\nattained the prestige of the other national festivals; they were held\r\nevery two years in the spring of the second and fourth years of the\r\ncorresponding Olympiads and were administered by Corinth.[95]\r\n\r\nBesides the four national games, many Greek cities had purely local\r\nones, some of which originated in prehistoric days in honor of hero\r\ncults, while others were founded at historical dates. Athens was\r\nparticularly favored in having many such local festivals. The most\r\nimportant of these were the _Panathenaic_ games in honor of Athena,\r\nwhich developed from earlier annual _Athenaia_ or _Panathenaia_. The\r\nfestival was remodeled, or perhaps founded, just before Peisistratos\r\nseized the tyranny (561-560 B. C.), possibly by Solon, who died 560-559\r\nB. C. The name certainly points to the unity of Athens promoted by\r\nSolon, if not to the earlier unification of the village communities\r\nof Attika ascribed to Theseus. In any case, under Peisistratos it\r\nbecame something more than a local festival, as the recitation of Homer\r\nbecame a feature of it. Following the games at Delphi and Olympia,\r\nthe _Great Panathenaia_ were held every four years (the third year of\r\neach Olympiad) in the month of Hekatombaion (July), while the more\r\nancient annual festival continued yearly under the name of the _Little\r\nPanathenaia_. There were musical, literary, and athletic contests. The\r\ncentral feature of the festival was the procession which ascended from\r\nthe lower city to the Parthenon on the Akropolis to offer the goddess a\r\nrobe woven by noble Athenian maidens and matrons.[96] This procession\r\nis known to us in detail from the great Parthenon frieze. The _Theseia_\r\nexemplify a festival whose origin can be definitely dated. Kimon, the\r\nson of the hero of Marathon, in 469 B. C., discovered the supposed\r\nbones of the national hero Theseus on the island of Skyros. The\r\nDelphic oracle counseled the Athenians to place them in an honorable\r\nresting-place. Perhaps there was a legend that the hero was buried on\r\nSkyros; in any case a grave was found there which contained the corpse\r\nof a warrior of great size, and this was brought back to Athens as the\r\nactual remains of Theseus. Thereafter an annual festival was celebrated\r\nby the Athenian _epheboi_, comprising military contests and athletic\r\nevents—stade, dolichos, and diaulos running races, wrestling, boxing,\r\npankration, hoplite running, etc. It began on the sixth of Pyanepsion\r\n(October), and was followed by the _Epitaphia_, a funeral festival\r\nin honor of national heroes and youths who had fallen fighting for\r\nAthens.[97] Athletic games were held at the _Herakleia_ in honor of\r\nHerakles at Marathon in the month of Metageitnion, and had attained\r\ngreat popularity by the time of Pindar.[98] The _Eleusinia_, in honor\r\nof Demeter, took place annually in Athens in the month of Boëdromion,\r\nwhen horse-races and musical and other contests were held. This Attic\r\nfestival claimed a greater antiquity even than Olympia. The great\r\nnational festivals encouraged these smaller local ones, so that they\r\nattracted competitors from the whole Greek world.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PRIZES FOR ATHLETES.\r\n\r\nThe prizes which were offered at the early games in Greece were\r\nuniformly articles of value. Their value, however, was regarded not so\r\nmuch in the light of rewards to the victors as proofs of the generous\r\nspirit of the holders of the games, who thereby celebrated the dead in\r\nwhose honor the contest was held. In Homer’s account of the funeral\r\ngames of Patroklos, each contestant, whether victorious or not,\r\nreceived a prize. In one case a prize was given where the contest was\r\nnot held. In the chariot-race five prizes were offered: for the winner\r\na slave girl and a tripod; for the second best a six-year-old mare in\r\nfoal; for the third a cauldron; for the fourth two talents of gold; and\r\nfor the last a two-handled cup.[99] For the wrestling match the winner\r\nreceived a tripod worth twelve oxen, while the vanquished received a\r\nskilled slave woman worth four oxen.[100] For the boxing match a mule\r\nwas the first prize and a two-handled cup the second.[101] For the\r\nfoot-race a silver bowl of Sidonian make, an ox, and half a talent of\r\ngold were the prizes.[102]\r\n\r\nHesiod records his winning a tripod for a victory gained in singing at\r\nthe games of Amphidamas at Chalkis.[103] Tripods were the commonest\r\nprizes at all early games and it was not till later that they became\r\nconnected especially with Apollo’s worship. They were presented for\r\nall sorts of contests, for chariot-racing,[104] horse-racing,[105] the\r\nfoot-race,[106] boxing,[107] and wrestling.[108] They were presented at\r\nvarious games in honor of different gods and heroes: _e. g._, those in\r\nhonor of Apollo at the _Triopia_[109] and _Panionia_ of Mykale;[110]\r\nof Dionysos at Athens and Rhodes;[111] of Herakles at the _Herakleia_\r\nof Thebes and elsewhere;[112] of Pelias;[113] of Patroklos.[114] They\r\nwere kept in temples dedicated to various gods: _e. g._, in those of\r\nApollo at Delphi, at Amyklai,[115] and on Delos,[116] at the Ptoian\r\nsanctuary[117] and in the Ismenion at Thebes;[118] in the temples\r\nof Zeus at Olympia and Dodona;[119] of Herakles at Thebes;[120] at\r\nthe Hierothesion in Messene,[121] etc. Later, because it served the\r\nPythian priestess, the tripod became a part of the Apolline cult and\r\nthe special attribute of that god.[122] Gold and silver vessels and\r\narticles of bronze were everywhere used as prizes. In early days\r\nbronze was very valuable. Pindar proves this for games held in Achaia\r\nand Arkadia;[123] and it continued to be used in later times, as,\r\n_e. g._, at the _Panathenaia_, where a hydria of bronze was a prize\r\nin the torch-race.[124] At the lesser games all sorts of articles\r\nwere offered, merely for their value. Thus a shield was offered at\r\nthe Argive _Heraia_,[125] a bowl at the games in honor of Aiakos on\r\nAegina,[126] silver cups at the Marathonian _Herakleia_[127] and at\r\nthe Sikyonian _Pythia_,[128] a cloak at Pellene,[129] apparently\r\na cuirass at Argos,[130] and jars of oil from sacred trees at the\r\n_Panathenaia_.[131] A kettle is mentioned in the Anthology;[132] an\r\ninscribed cauldron from Cumae, which was a prize at the games there in\r\nhonor of Onomastos, is in the British Museum,[133] while measures of\r\nbarley and corn were prizes at the _Eleusinia_.[134] While presents of\r\nvalue continued to be given at the local games,[135] a simple wreath\r\nof leaves gradually came to be the prize offered the victor at the\r\ngreat national festivals. Pausanias[136] says that this was composed\r\nof wild olive (κότινος) at Olympia, of laurel (δάφνη) at Delphi, of\r\npine (πίτυς) at the Isthmus, and of celery (σέλινον) at Nemea. Phlegon\r\nsays that the olive wreath was first used by Iphitos in Ol. 7 (= 752\r\nB. C.), when it was given to the Messenian runner Daïkles,[137] and\r\nthat for the preceding Olympiads there was no crown.[138] Probably\r\nbefore that date tripods and other articles of value were the prizes\r\nat Olympia, as we know they were elsewhere. Pausanias says that the\r\nwild olive came from the land of the Hyperboreans.[139] Pindar calls it\r\nmerely olive (ἐλαία), and not wild olive.[140] The Athenian tradition\r\nwas that the olive which Herakles planted at Olympia was a shoot of\r\na sacred tree which grew on the banks of the Ilissos in Attica.[141]\r\nPhlegon also says that the first crown came from Attika. In later days\r\nthe Olympic wreaths were cut from the “Olive of the Faircrown”;[142]\r\nits branches were cut with a golden sickle by a boy whose parents\r\nmust be living;[143] it grew at Olympia in a spot near the so-called\r\nPantheion,[144] which was probably a grove behind the temple of\r\nZeus.[145] The laurel prize at the Pythian games replaced the older\r\narticles of value or money in 582 B. C.[146] It came from Tempe and\r\nwas plucked by a boy whose parents must be living.[147] The wreath\r\nis seen on late Delphian coins of the imperial age.[148] Lucian also\r\nstates that apples were given as prizes at Delphi.[149] Wild celery was\r\nthe prize at the Isthmus in the time of Pindar.[150] It was dried or\r\nwithered to differentiate it from the fresh celery used at Nemea.[151]\r\nLater writers say that the wreath was of the leaves of the pine,[152]\r\nwhich was the tree sacred to Poseidon. Probably pine leaves composed\r\nthe older wreath, a practice certainly revived again in later Roman\r\nimperial days;[153] for while on coins of Augustus and Nero celery is\r\nrepresented, those of Antoninus Pius and Lucius Verus show pine.[154] A\r\nrow of pine trees lined the approach to Poseidon’s sanctuary.[155] The\r\nprize at Nemea was celery and not parsley, as many wrongly interpret\r\nthe wreath appearing on Selinuntian coins.[156] Pausanias also states\r\nthat at most Greek games a palm wreath was placed in the victor’s right\r\nhand.[157] The palm as a symbol of victory occurs first toward the end\r\nof the fifth century B. C.[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION OF ATHLETE PRIZES.\r\n\r\nJust as soldiers on returning from successful campaigns might dedicate\r\ntheir spoils of victory, victors in athletic contests might consecrate\r\nto the gods their prizes. In the Homeric poems we have no certain\r\nevidence of such a custom. A Delphic tripod was ascribed to Diomedes\r\nand possibly this was a prize won at the funeral games in honor of\r\nPatroklos.[159] The first literary example of such a dedication of\r\nwhich we are certain is the prize tripod dedicated to the Helikonian\r\nMuses by Hesiod.[160] Frequently such dedications were tripods; thus\r\na Pythian tripod was dedicated to Herakles at Thebes by the Arkadian\r\nmusician Echembrotos in 586 B. C.;[161] a tripod was dedicated in the\r\nsixth century B. C. or perhaps earlier at Athens for some acrobatic or\r\njuggling trick;[162] a victorious boxer dedicated one at Thebes.[163]\r\nIt became customary by the fifth century B. C. for victors at the\r\n_Triopia_ to offer prize tripods to Apollo.[164] Tripods or fragments\r\nof them have been found at Olympia[165] and elsewhere. Many other\r\nobjects were also offered.[166] Sometimes a victor would dedicate the\r\nobject by which he won his victory instead of his prize, just as a\r\nsoldier might dedicate his arms instead of his spoils of war. Certain\r\ntypes of victors, _e. g._, those especially in running, the race in\r\narmor, singing, etc., would be excluded from making such dedications\r\nowing to the nature of the contest. Pausanias[167] tells us, for\r\ninstance, that twenty-five bronze shields were kept in the temple\r\nof Zeus at Olympia for the use of hoplite runners, which shows that\r\nthese runners did not use all at least of their own armor. In some\r\ncases diskoi were lent to pentathletes. Pausanias[168] says that three\r\nquoits were kept in the treasury of the Sikyonians at Olympia for use\r\nin the pentathlon. There are, however, as we shall see, instances of\r\nquoits being dedicated by victors. The pentathlete might consecrate\r\neither his diskos, javelin, or jumping-weights.[169] Perhaps the huge\r\nred-sandstone block of the sixth century B. C., weighing 315 pounds and\r\ninscribed with the name and feat of Bybon, may have been such an _ex\r\nvoto_,[170] since Pausanias says the contestants at Olympia originally\r\nused stones for quoits.[171] A stone, weighing 480 kilograms (about\r\n1,056 pounds), was found on Thera, inscribed “Eumastos raised me from\r\nthe ground.”[172] Poplios (Publius) Asklepiades, who won the pentathlon\r\nat Olympia in the third century A. D.,[173] dedicated a bronze diskos\r\nto Zeus, showing the old custom was kept up till late. Many bronze\r\ndiskoi have been found in the excavations of the Altis.[174] We have\r\ninstances of the dedication of jumping-weights (ἁλτῆρες).[175] Examples\r\nof dedicated strigils have been found at Olympia.[176] Torches were\r\ndedicated at Athens.[177] Actors dedicated their masks,[178] while\r\nsome of the ivory lyres and plectra conserved in the Parthenon were\r\nprobably offerings of musical victors at the Panathenaic games.[179]\r\nEquestrian victors dedicated their chariots, or models of them, and\r\ntheir horses. These models might be large or small. We have notices of\r\nlarge chariot-groups at Olympia of Kleosthenes,[180] Gelo,[181] and\r\nHiero of Syracuse;[182] of small ones of Euagoras,[183] Glaukon,[184]\r\nKyniska,[185] and Polypeithes.[186] A large number of miniature models\r\nof chariots and horses in bronze and terra cotta have been found at\r\nOlympia,[187] some of which have no wheels. Many very thin foil wheels\r\nhave also been found.[188] Furtwaengler[189] believes that these\r\nwheels are conventional reductions of whole chariots. Some of them\r\nare cast[190] and they are generally four-spoked, but two mule-car\r\nwheels are five-spoked.[191] These various models are so common and of\r\nso little value, however, that they may have had nothing to do with\r\nchariot-races.[192]\r\n\r\nMany great artists, _e. g._, Kalamis,[193] Euphranor,[194] and\r\nLysippos,[195] are known to have made chariot-groups and it is\r\nreasonable to assume that some of these were votive in character.\r\nBesides dedications of chariot victors, we find at Olympia also those\r\nof horse-racers. These were similarly both large and small, with and\r\nwithout jockeys. Thus jockeys on horseback by Kalamis stood on either\r\nside of Hiero’s chariot.[196] Krokon of Eretria, who won the horse-race\r\nat the end of the sixth century B. C.,[197] dedicated a small bronze\r\nhorse at Olympia.[198] The monument of the sons of Pheidolas of\r\nCorinth,[199] representing a horse on the top of a column, must have\r\nbeen small. Pausanias, in mentioning the two statues of the Spartan\r\nchariot victor Lykinos by Myron,[200] says that one of the horses which\r\nthe victor brought to Olympia was not allowed to enter the foal-race,\r\nand therefore was entered in the horse-race. This story was probably\r\ntold Pausanias by the Olympia guides and may have arisen from the\r\nsmallness of one of the horses in the monument.[201] The sculptors\r\nKalamis,[202] Kanachos,[203] and Hegias[204] are known to have made\r\ngroups representing horse-victors, and Pliny derives the whole _genre_\r\nof equestrian monuments from the Greeks.[205] Great numbers of small\r\nfigures of horses and riders have been excavated at Olympia[206] and\r\nelsewhere.[207] Equestrian groups of various kinds were also known\r\noutside Olympia. Thus Arkesilas IV of Kyrene offered a chariot model at\r\nDelphi for a victory in 466 B. C;[208] the base found on the Akropolis\r\nof Athens and inscribed with the name Onatas probably upheld such a\r\ngroup;[209] the equestrian statue of Isokrates on the Akropolis was\r\nalso probably a dedication for a victory in horse-racing.[210]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION OF STATUES AT OLYMPIA AND ELSEWHERE.\r\n\r\nNot only did equestrian contests and the pentathlon give the victor\r\nan opportunity to represent the means by which he gained his prize,\r\nbut any victorious athlete could set up a statue of himself in his own\r\nhonor, which might either represent him in the characteristic attitude\r\nof his contest (perhaps with its distinguishing attributes) or might be\r\na simple monument showing neither action nor attribute. This brings us\r\nto the main subject of the present work—the discussion of the different\r\ntypes of victor statues at Olympia.\r\n\r\nOf all the national games of Hellas, our knowledge of Olympia is\r\nfullest, both because of the detailed account of its monuments by\r\nPausanias, who visited Elis in 173 or 174 A. D., and because of the\r\nsystematic excavation of the Altis by the German government in the\r\nseventies of the last century. We shall not be concerned, except\r\nincidentally, with monuments set up at the other national games, which\r\nare known to us in no such degree as those of Olympia. The interest\r\nof Pausanias in Delphi was almost entirely of a religious nature,\r\nand the lesser renown of both Nemea and the Isthmus caused him to\r\ntreat their topography and monuments in a most summary manner. Though\r\nthe _Pythia_ as a festival were second only to the _Olympia_, as an\r\nathletic meet they scarcely equalled the _Nemea_ or the _Isthmia_.\r\nFrom the earliest days music was the chief competition at Delphi;\r\nthe oldest and most important event in the musical programme there\r\nall through Greek history was the Hymn to Apollo, sung with the\r\naccompaniment of the lyre, in which was celebrated the victory of the\r\ngod over the Python. By 582 B. C. singing to the flute (αὐλῳδία) was\r\nalso added, but was almost immediately discontinued. In the same year\r\na flute solo was also inaugurated.[211] In 558 B. C. lyre-playing was\r\nintroduced. Under the Roman Empire poetic and dramatic competitions\r\nwere prominent, but the date of their introduction is not known.\r\nPliny mentions contests in painting.[212] After music the equestrian\r\ncontests were the most important, even rivalling those of Olympia.\r\nBy 586 B. C., as we have seen, athletic events were inaugurated. The\r\nathletic importance of the games on the Isthmus was inferior to that\r\nof Olympia and its religious character to that of Delphi, though these\r\ngames were the most frequented of all the great national ones, because\r\nof the accessibility of the place and its nearness to Corinth.[213]\r\nThe inferiority of the athletics here may be judged by the fact that\r\nSolon assigned only 100 drachmæ to an Isthmian victor, while 500 were\r\ngiven to one from Olympia.[214] We have little knowledge of these games\r\nthrough the great period of Greek history, only a reference here and\r\nthere to a victor.[215] We know much more of them under the Romans,\r\nwhen the prosperity of Corinth was revived; at that time, however,\r\nthere was little true interest in athletics. Corinth then spent great\r\nsums in procuring wild animals for the arena.[216] Excavations have\r\nadded little to our knowledge of these games.[217] The interest at\r\nNemea in athletics was second only to that of Olympia.[218] While music\r\nwas the most important feature at Delphi, and the Isthmian games were\r\nattended chiefly for the attractions of the neighboring Corinth, there\r\nwas nothing but the games themselves to attract people to the retired\r\nvalley of Nemea. Athletic contests were the only feature here until\r\nlate times and great attention was paid to those of boys.[219] The\r\nrecords of the victors at these games are very scanty.[220]\r\n\r\nAt all these three games victor monuments were set up, though in no\r\nsuch profusion as at Olympia.\r\n\r\nOf those set up at Delphi, Pausanias shows his disdain by these\r\nwords: “As to the athletes and musical competitors who have attracted\r\nno notice from the majority of mankind, I hold them hardly worthy\r\nof attention; and the athletes who have made themselves a name\r\nhave already been set forth by me in my account of Elis.”[221] He\r\nmentions the statue of only one victor, that of Phaÿllos, who won\r\nat Delphi twice in the pentathlon and once in running. A score or\r\nmore of inscriptions in honor of these men whom Pausanias treats so\r\ncontemptuously have been recovered. Some of them record offerings\r\ndedicated for victories, though most of them record decrees passed by\r\nthe Delphians, who voted the victors not only wreaths of laurel, but\r\nseats of honor at the games and other privileges.[222] Victor statues\r\nseem to have stood outside the sacred precinct at Delphi and not\r\nwithin it, as at Olympia, since Pausanias mentions the sanctuary after\r\nmentioning the statue of Phaÿllos.[223] Other Greek and Roman writers\r\ngive us stray hints of these statues. Thus, Pliny mentions a statue\r\nat Delphi of a _pancratiastes_ by Pythagoras of Rhegion[224] and says\r\nthat Myron made _Delphicos pentathlos, pancratiastas_.[225] A scholion\r\non Pindar[226] mentions the helmeted statue of the hoplite runner\r\nTelisikrates as standing in the precinct. Justin, in speaking of the\r\nGallic invasion of Delphi, mentions _statuasque cum quadrigis, quarum\r\ningens copia procul visebatur_, thus referring to large chariot-groups,\r\nwhich would be very sightly on the slope of the precinct.[227] An idea\r\nof the beauty of such groups may be gathered from the remnant of one,\r\nthe bronze _Charioteer_ discovered by the French excavators, which\r\nis one of the most important archaic sculptures from antiquity (Fig.\r\n66).[228]\r\n\r\nWe know from the words of Pausanias[229] that victor statues also stood\r\non the Isthmus, and we should assume the same for Nemea, though in\r\nboth places they must have been few in number. At the various local\r\ngames it was customary for victors to erect statues of themselves. Thus\r\nwe know of such dedications at the Bœotian games in Thebes,[230]\r\nat the Didymaion,[231] and at the _Lykaia_ in Arkadia.[232] Many\r\nsuch victor statues decorated different localities of Athens. Thus,\r\non the Akropolis, we know of the statues of the hoplite runner\r\nEpicharinos,[233] of the pancratiast Hermolykos,[234] of a helmeted\r\nman by the sculptor Kleoitas,[235] of a παῖς κελητίζων representing\r\nIsokrates;[236] in the Prytaneion, of the statue of the pancratiast\r\nAutolykos.[237] Lykourgos, the rhetor, mentions victor statues in the\r\nagora of Athens.[238] Some of these Athenian statues may have been\r\nthose of Olympic victors;[239] and of victors certainly Olympic we\r\nknow of the statues of Kallias the pancratiast,[240] of the charioteer\r\nHermokrates,[241] and of the bronze mares of Kimon.[242] Of the statues\r\nof Nemean victors at Athens we know of that of Hegestratos, victor in\r\nan unknown contest.[243] Of Isthmian victors there we know of that of\r\nthe pancratiast Diophanes,[244] and of other examples.[245] We have\r\ninscriptional record of the statues at Athens of a boy victor at the\r\n_Panathenaia_ and the _Thargelia_ in chariot-racing,[246] of a victor\r\nat the _Pythia_, _Isthmia_, _Nemea_, and the _Panathenaia_,[247] of\r\none at the _Nemea_ and _Herakleia_ at Thebes,[248] of one at the\r\n_Eleusinia_,[249] of one at the _Panathenaia_ and _Dionysia_,[250] and\r\nof others at several games.[251]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Bronze Statuette of a Victor, from Olympia.\r\nMuseum of Olympia.]\r\n\r\nThe erection of a statue in the Altis at Olympia was an honor which the\r\nElean officers in charge of the games[252] gave to victors to glorify\r\ntheir victory.[253] Pliny, in a well-known passage of the _Historia\r\nNaturalis_,[254] says it was customary for all victors to set up\r\nstatues, while Pausanias[255] says not all athletes did this, for “some\r\nof those who specially distinguished themselves in the games ... have\r\nhad no statues.” This apparent contradiction in the statements of the\r\ntwo writers is to be explained, as Dittenberger[256] and others have\r\npointed out, on the ground that Pliny states the general privilege\r\nextended to the victor, while Pausanias states its practical working\r\nout, since the setting up of a statue was an undertaking which would\r\nbe limited by the early death, poverty, or some other disability of\r\nthe victorious athlete. The cost of making, transporting, and setting\r\nup a statue was considerable, and very often a victor must have\r\nbeen too poor to do it. In such a case he would often be contented\r\nto set up merely a statuette or small figure in bronze or marble.\r\nSeveral such bronze figures have been unearthed at Olympia,[257] one\r\nof which we reproduce in Fig. 2, and we have many examples found\r\noutside the Altis: _e. g._, a group of wrestlers,[258] a boxer,[259]\r\nand the arm of a quoit-thrower[260] from the Athenian Akropolis,\r\nan archaic girl runner from Dodona,[261] an archaic statuette from\r\nDelphi with a loin-cloth,[262] a bronze quoit-thrower dedicated in the\r\nKabeirion,[263] the Tuebingen bronze hoplite runner[264] (Fig. 42),\r\nand the statuette of a παῖς κέλης from Dodona.[265] We should also\r\nmention the great number of statuettes of diskos-throwers in modern\r\nmuseums.[266] Boy victors especially would use the less expensive\r\nmarble for such statuettes and we have the remnants of many such found\r\nin the excavations of the Altis.[267] Pausanias mentions several\r\nmonuments which were less than life-size, _e. g._, a horse among the\r\nofferings of Phormis, which he says was “much inferior in size and\r\nshape to all other statues of horses in the Altis,”[268] and the\r\nequestrian monuments already discussed. Even reliefs and paintings,\r\nin some cases, were offered in lieu of larger monuments, not only for\r\nreasons of economy, but also because they gave a better representation\r\nof the contest. This custom was common at the lesser games, especially\r\nat the _Panathenaia_.[269] Pausanias mentions painted iconic reliefs\r\nvowed by girl runners at the games in honor of Hera at Olympia.[270] On\r\nan Attic vase in Munich a victor is represented as holding an iconic\r\nvotive _pinax_ in his hands.[271] Pausanias speaks of a painting by\r\nTimainetos at Athens, which represented a boy carrying hydriæ,[272]\r\nand one of a wrestler by the same artist in the Pinakotheke on the\r\nAkropolis. Pliny mentions paintings, the works of great masters,\r\nrepresenting victors: thus the _currentes quadrigae_ by the elder\r\nAristeides of Thebes,[273] a _victor certamine gymnico palmam tenens_\r\nby Eupompos,[274] an athlete by Zeuxis,[275] the victor Aratos with a\r\ntrophy by Leontiskos,[276] an athlete by Protogenes,[277] two hoplite\r\nrunners by Parrhasios,[278] a _luctator tubicenque_ by Antidotos and\r\na warrior by the same artist, in Athens,[279] which represented a man\r\nfighting with a shield, and a man anointing himself, the work of the\r\npainter Theoros.[280]\r\n\r\nApparently the Hellanodikai allowed but one statue for each victory.\r\nAischines the Elean had two victories and two statues.[281] Dikon of\r\nKaulonia and Syracuse had three victories and three statues.[282]\r\nThe Spartan Lykinos had two victories and two statues by Myron, but\r\nwe have already said that the second statue was probably that of his\r\ncharioteer, the two forming part of an equestrian group.[283] Kapros\r\nof Elis won two victories and had as many statues.[284] On the other\r\nhand Troilos of Elis, who won in two events, had only one statue.[285]\r\nSimilarly Arkesilaos of Sparta had two victories in the chariot-race\r\nand only one statue.[286] Xenombrotos of Cos, who appears to have won\r\nonce only, had, however, two monuments, one mentioned by Pausanias and\r\nthe other known to us from the recovered inscription.[287] But this\r\nlast case seems to be the only known exception.\r\n\r\nWhen the victor was unable to set up his monument, whether because of\r\nyouth, poverty, early death, or other reason, sometimes the privilege\r\nwas utilized by a relative, a friend, or by his native city. In any\r\ncase it was a private affair with which the Elean officials had no\r\nconcern. We have examples, consequently, of the statue being set up\r\nby the son,[288] father (especially in recovered inscriptions after\r\nthe time of Augustus),[289] mother,[290] and brother;[291] also\r\nseveral examples of statues reared in honor of athletes by fellow\r\ncitizens.[292] There are cases in which the trainer set up the\r\nstatue.[293] Frequently the native city performed the duty, dedicating\r\nthe statue either at Olympia or in the victor’s city. Thus Oibotas,\r\nwho won the stade-race in Ol. 6 (= 756 B. C.), had a statue at Olympia\r\nwhich was erected by the Achæan state out of deference to a command of\r\nthe Delphian oracle in Ol. 80 (= 460 B. C.).[294] The statue of Agenor,\r\nby Polykleitos the Younger, a boy wrestler from Thebes, was dedicated\r\nby the confederacy of Phokis, because his father was a public friend of\r\nthe nation.[295] The boy runner Herodotos of Klazomenai had a statue\r\nerected by his native town at Olympia because he was the first victor\r\nfrom there.[296] Philinos of Kos had a statue set up by the people of\r\nKos at Olympia “because of glory won,” for he was victor five times in\r\nrunning at Olympia, four at Delphi, four at Nemea, and eleven at the\r\nIsthmus.[297] Hermesianax of Kolophon had a statue at Olympia erected\r\nby his city.[298] The pancratiast Promachos of Pellene had two statues\r\nerected to him by his fellow citizens, one at Olympia, the other in\r\nPellene.[299] We know of three state dedications of statues at Olympia\r\nfrom inscriptions, those of Aristophon of Athens,[300] of Epitherses of\r\nErythrai,[301] and of Polyxenos by the people of Zakynthos.[302] Lichas\r\nof Sparta, at a date when the Spartans were excluded from the games,\r\nentered his chariot in the name of the Theban people, and Pausanias\r\nsays that his victory was so entered on the Elean register.[303] We\r\nlearn from the _OxyrhynchusPapyri_ that the public horse of the Argives\r\nwon at Olympia in Ol. 75 (= 480 _B. C._) and the public chariot in\r\nOl. 77 (= 472 _B. C._).[304] In these latter two cases the public\r\nwas directly interested, and had there been monuments erected to\r\ncommemorate the victories they would naturally have been set up by the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIt has been wrongly assumed that monuments of boy victors were\r\ndedicated in the name of their parents or relatives.[305] On the\r\ncontrary, we have examples dating back to the fifth century B. C. of\r\nboys setting up statues at Olympia. Thus the inscription from the\r\nbase of the statue of Tellon, who won in the boys’ boxing match in\r\nOl. 77 (= 472 B. C.), states that he dedicated his own statue.[306]\r\nPausanias says that the Eleans allowed the boy wrestler Kratinos from\r\nAigeira to erect a statue of his trainer.[307] Of course the boy might\r\nneed assistance in the undertaking, but this again was no concern of\r\nthe Elean officials, who granted the privilege to the victor and not\r\nto his relatives. Usually the statue of a victor was erected soon\r\nafter the victory. We have some examples of the statue being erected\r\nimmediately after the victory, especially in the case of men victors.\r\nThus Pausanias says that the victor Eubotas of Kyrene, in consequence\r\nof a Libyan oracle foretelling his victory in the foot-race, had\r\nhis statue made before coming to Olympia and erected it “the very day\r\non which he was proclaimed victor.”[308] The famous Milo of Kroton\r\nspectacularly carried his statue into the Altis on his back before he\r\nentered the contest.[309] There are also examples of statues being\r\nerected long after the victory, sometimes centuries later. We have\r\nalready mentioned that a statue was erected to Oibotas in Ol. 80,\r\nthough his victory was won in Ol. 6. Chionis, who won in running races\r\nin Ols. 28-31 (= 668-656 B. C.) had a statue by Myron erected to his\r\nmemory Ol. 77 or 78 (= 472 or 468 B. C.).[310] Cheilon of Patrai, twice\r\nvictor in wrestling between Ols. (?) 103 and 115 (= 368 and 320 B. C.),\r\nhad his statue set up after his death.[311] Polydamas of Skotoussa won\r\nhis victory in the pankration in Ol. 93 (= 408 B. C.), but his statue\r\nby Lysippos could not have been erected until many years later.[312]\r\nGlaukos, who won the boys’ boxing-match in Ol. 65 (= 520 B. C.), had a\r\nstatue by the Aeginetan sculptor Glaukias much later.[313] In the case\r\nof boy victors, the time between boyhood and coming of age was often so\r\nshort that in many cases we may assume that the statue was set up some\r\ntime after the victory.[314]\r\n\r\n\r\nHONORS PAID TO VICTORS BY THEIR NATIVE CITIES.\r\n\r\nSince the victor was deemed the representative of the state, he often\r\nreceived a more substantial reward than a statue erected at the cost of\r\nhis fellow citizens. The herald, in proclaiming his victory, proclaimed\r\nalso the name of his town, which thus shared in his success. At Athens\r\nit was customary for a victor at the great games to receive a reward of\r\nmoney. To encourage an interest in athletics there, Solon established\r\nmoney prizes for victorious athletes. We have already said that 100\r\ndrachmæ were given to a victor at the Isthmus, while 500 were allotted\r\nto one at Olympia. Solon further ordained that victors should eat at\r\nthe Prytaneion at the public expense.[315] Probably other Greek states\r\nfollowed the Athenian custom. We know from an inscription that the\r\nPanathenaic victors in the stade-race received 50 amphoræ of oil, the\r\npancratiast 40, and others 30.[316] Later, in Rome, victors had special\r\nprivileges granted them, including maintenance at the public expense,\r\na privilege which Mæcenas advised the emperor Augustus to limit to\r\nvictors at Olympia, Delphi, and Rome.[317] Augustus in other ways\r\nenlarged the privileges of athletes.[318] When we consider the intimate\r\nconnection between religion and athletics and the Panhellenic fame of a\r\nvictor at the great games, we can easily understand the indignation of\r\nthe native town when its athletes did anything dishonorable. Sometimes\r\na victor was bribed to appear as the citizen of some other state. Thus\r\nAstylos of Kroton, who won in running races in Ols. 73-76 (= 488-476\r\nB. C.), had himself proclaimed in his last two contests a Syracusan to\r\nplease King Hiero. The citizens of his native town burned his house and\r\npulled down his statue, which had been placed there in the temple of\r\nHera.[319] The Cretan Sotades, who won the long running race in Ol. 99\r\n(= 384 B. C.), was bribed at the next Olympiad by the city of Ephesos\r\nto proclaim himself an Ephesian, and was in consequence exiled.[320]\r\nDikon, a victor in running races at the beginning of the fourth century\r\nB. C., proclaimed himself first a citizen of Kaulonia, but later,\r\n“for a sum of money,” entered the men’s contest as a Syracusan.[321]\r\nSometimes such attempts at bribery proved unsuccessful. Thus the\r\nfather of the boy boxer Antipatros of Miletos, who won in Ol. 98 (=\r\n388 B. C.), accepted a bribe from some Syracusans, who were bringing\r\nan offering to Olympia from Dionysios, to let the boy be proclaimed\r\na Syracusan. But the boy himself refused the bribe and had inscribed\r\non his statue by the younger Polykleitos that he was a Milesian, the\r\nfirst Ionian to dedicate a statue at Olympia.[322] The Spartan chariot\r\nvictor Lichas has already been mentioned as having entered his chariot\r\nin the name of Thebes. The reason was that at the time the Spartans\r\nwere excluded from entering the games at Olympia. He won, and in his\r\nexcitement tied a ribbon on his charioteer with his own hands, thereby\r\nshowing that the horses belonged to him and not to Thebes. For this\r\ninfraction of the rules he, though an aged man, was punished by the\r\numpires by scourging.[323] A more disgraceful act was selling out, of\r\nwhich we have two examples at Olympia. The Thessalian Eupolos bribed\r\nhis three adversaries in boxing to let him win. All four were fined\r\nand from the money six bronze statues of Zeus, known as _Zanes_, were\r\nerected at the entrance to the stadion, inscribed with elegiac verses\r\nwhich warned future athletes against repeating such attempts.[324]\r\nMore than fifty years later Kallippos, a pentathlete of Athens, bribed\r\nhis opponents and, being detected, all were fined and from the money,\r\nfinally collected from the recalcitrant Athenians through the influence\r\nof the oracle at Delphi, six more _Zanes_ were erected.[325] Straton\r\n(or Stratonikos), of Alexandria, won in wrestling and the pankration on\r\nthe same day in Ol. 178 (= 68 B. C.). In the wrestling match he had two\r\nadversaries, Eudelos and Philostratos of Rhodes. The latter had bribed\r\nEudelos to sell out and, being detected, had to pay a fine. Out of this\r\nmoney another _Zan_ was set up and still another at the cost of the\r\nRhodians.[326] In Ol. 192 (= 12 B. C.) and in Ol. 226 (= 125 A. D.), we\r\nhear of fines for such corruption out of which additional _Zanes_ were\r\nerected.[327] In Ol. 201 (= 25 A. D.) Sarapion, a pancratiast from\r\nAlexandria, became so afraid of his antagonist that he fled the day\r\nbefore the contest and was fined—the only case recorded of an athlete\r\nbeing fined for cowardice at Olympia.[328] In Ol. 218 (= 93 A. D.)\r\nanother Alexandrine, named Apollonios, was fined for arriving too late\r\nfor the games at Olympia. His excuse of being detained by winds was\r\nfound to be false, and it was discovered that he had been making money\r\non the games in Ionia.[329]\r\n\r\nCases of bribery were known at other games. A third-century B. C.\r\ninscription from Epidauros records how three athletes were fined one\r\nthousand staters each διὰ τὸ φθείρειν τοὺς ἀγῶνας.[330] The venality of\r\nIsthmian victors is shown by the account of a competitor who promised\r\na rival three thousand drachmæ to let him win and then, on winning on\r\nhis merits, refused to pay, though the defeated contestant swore on\r\nthe altar of Poseidon that he had been promised the amount.[331] The\r\nemperor Nero, in order to win in singing at the Isthmus, had to resort\r\nto force. A certain Epeirote singer refused to withdraw unless he\r\nreceived ten talents. Nero, to save himself from defeat, sent a band of\r\nmen who pummelled his antagonist so that he could not sing.[332]\r\n\r\nOften the home-coming of a victor at one of the national games was the\r\noccasion for a public celebration. Sometimes the whole city turned\r\nout to meet the hero.[333] The victory was recorded on pillars, and\r\npoets composed songs in its honor which were sung by choruses of\r\ngirls and boys. Sometimes a statue was set up in the agora or on the\r\nAkropolis. In the cities of Magna Græcia and Sicily such adulation\r\nof Olympic victors became at times very extravagant. Thus Exainetos\r\nof Akragas, who won the stade-race in Ols. 91 and 92 (= 416-412 B.\r\nC.), was brought into the city in a four-horse chariot drawn by his\r\nfellow-citizens, and was escorted by 300 men in two-horse chariots\r\ndrawn by white horses.[334] It is also in the West that we first hear\r\nof victors being worshipped as heroes or gods, though the custom soon\r\ntook root in Greece. It was but natural to account for the great\r\nstrength of famous athletes by assigning to them divine origin and by\r\nworshipping them after death.[335] Philippos of Kroton, who won in an\r\nunknown contest about Ol. 65 (= 520 B. C.), had a _heroön_ erected in\r\nhis honor by the people of Egesta in Sicily on account of his beauty,\r\nin which he surpassed all his contemporaries, and he was worshipped\r\nafter his death as a hero.[336] The famous boxer Euthymos of Lokroi\r\nEpizephyrioi, who won in Ols. 74, 76, 77 (= 484, 476, 472 B. C.), was\r\nworshipped even before his death and was looked upon as the son of no\r\nearthly father, but of the river-god Kaikinos.[337] Fabulous feats\r\nwere ascribed to him, _e. g._, the expulsion of the Black Spirit from\r\nTemessa.[338] During and after his lifetime sacrifices were offered\r\nin his honor.[339] The equally famed boxer and pancratiast Theagenes\r\nof Thasos, the opponent of Euthymos, who won in Ols. 75 and 76 (=\r\n480 and 476 B. C.), was heroized after his death.[340] The Thasians\r\nmaintained that his father was Herakles.[341] The boxer Kleomedes of\r\nAstypalaia, who won in Ol. 71 (= 496 B. C.), was honored as a hero\r\nafter death.[342] Having killed Ikkos, his opponent, he became crazed\r\nwith grief. Pausanias recounts his curious death.[343] The worship of\r\nsuch athletes was supposed to bestow physical strength on their adorers\r\nand consequently statues were erected to them in many places and were\r\nthought to be able to cure illnesses.[344] The life of a successful\r\nathlete was looked upon as especially happy. In Aristophanes’ _Plutus_,\r\nHermes deserts the gods and serves Plutus “the presider over contests,”\r\nthinking no service more profitable to the god of wealth than holding\r\ncontests in music and athletics.[345] Plato thought an Olympic victor’s\r\nlife was the most blessed of all from a material point of view.[346]\r\nIn the myth of Er the soul of Atalanta chooses the body of an athlete,\r\non seeing “the great rewards bestowed on an athlete.”[347] The great\r\nRhodian pancratiast Dorieus, who won in Ols. 87, 88, 89 (= 432-424\r\nB. C.), was taken prisoner by Athens during the Peloponnesian war,\r\nbut was freed because of his exploits at Olympia.[348] The honor in\r\nwhich a victor was held may also be judged by the story of the Spartan\r\nephor Cheilon, who died of joy while embracing his victorious son\r\nDamagetos.[349] To quote from Ernest Gardner: “The extraordinary,\r\nalmost super-human honours paid to the victors at the great national\r\ncontests made them a theme for the sculptor hardly less noble than\r\ngods and heroes, and more adapted for the display of his skill,\r\nas trained by the observation of those exercises which led to the\r\nvictory.”[350] Some of the greatest artists were employed, and great\r\npoets from Simonides of Keos down, including such names as Bacchylides\r\nand Pindar, were employed in singing their praises. Although it must\r\nbe confessed that the majority of the artists of victor statues at\r\nOlympia are little known or wholly unknown masters, Pausanias mentions\r\namong them such renowned names as Hagelaïdas, Pythagoras, Kalamis,\r\nMyron, Polykleitos, Lysippos, and possibly Pheidias. Certain other\r\ngreat names, however, are absent from his lists, _e. g._, Euphranor,\r\nKresilas, Praxiteles, and Skopas. Such extravagant reverence of Olympic\r\nand other victors as we have outlined met, of course, with violent\r\nprotests all through Greek history, just as the excessive popularity\r\nof athletics has in our time. The philosopher Xenophanes of Kolophon,\r\nwho died 480 B. C., was scandalized at the offering of divine honors\r\nto athletes.[351] While he denounced the popularity of athletics,\r\nEuripides later denounced the professionalism which had begun to creep\r\nin after the middle of the fifth century B. C.[352] Plato, though a\r\nstrong advocate of practical physical training for war, was opposed\r\nto the vain spirit of competition in the athletics of his day. He\r\ncomplained that professional athletes paid excessive attention to diet,\r\nslept their lives away, and were in danger of becoming brutalized.[353]\r\nThe last attack on professional athletics in point of time was made\r\nin the second century A. D. by Galen, in his _Exhortation to the\r\nArts_.[354] In this essay the eminent physician contended that the\r\nathlete was a benefit neither to himself nor to the state. When we\r\nstudy the brutal portraits of prize-fighters on the contemporary\r\nmosaics of the Baths of Caracalla at Rome, we can see to what depths\r\nthe old athletic ideal had sunk, and the justness of his rebuke.[355]\r\n\r\n\r\nVOTIVE CHARACTER OF VICTOR DEDICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThat chariot and hippic monuments were votive in character can\r\nscarcely be doubted. Pausanias distinguishes between gymnic victors\r\nand equestrian ones.[356] All authorities agree that equestrian\r\nmonuments were different in origin and character from those of other\r\nvictors.[357] Gardiner believes that if the Olympic games developed\r\nout of a single event, it was not the stade-race, but the chariot-race\r\nor heavy-armed-race. He shows that the custom of making the stade\r\nrunner eponymous for the Olympiad is not earlier than the third century\r\nB. C., and did not arise from the importance of that event, but from\r\nthe accident of its coming first on the program and first on the list\r\nof victors.[358] Equestrian monuments were dedicated at Olympia all\r\nthrough antiquity, from the sixth century B. C. to the second A. D. The\r\noldest was that of the Spartan Euagoras already mentioned, who won in\r\nthe chariot-race three times in Ols. (?) 58-60 (= 548-540 B. C.).[359]\r\nThe latest dated example is that of L. Minicius Natalis of Rome, who\r\nwon in Ol. 227 (= 129 A .D.).[360] Some of the inscriptions pertaining\r\nto equestrian groups are in verse,[361] while others are in prose.[362]\r\nMost of them have the usual dedicatory word ἀνέθηκε,[363] or the\r\nformula Διὶ Ὀλυμπίῳ,[364] while others have the word ἔστησε[365] and a\r\nfew have no dedicatory word at all.[366]\r\n\r\nThe question arises, then, whether ordinary victor monuments in the\r\nAltis were votive in the sense that these equestrian ones were, or\r\nmerely honors granted to the victors. The crown of wild olive was\r\nmerely a temporary reward suiting the occasion of the victory. The\r\nprivilege of setting up a statue was granted in order to perpetuate\r\nthe fame of that occasion. In a well-known passage Pausanias makes a\r\nsweeping generalization about monuments at Athens and Olympia.[367] He\r\nsays that all objects on the Akropolis—including statues—were ἀναθήματα\r\nor votive offerings, while some of those at Olympia were dedicated to\r\nthe god, but that the statues of athletes were mere prizes of victory.\r\nIn another passage[368] also, in distinguishing the various sorts of\r\nmonuments at Olympia, he expressly says that the statues of athletes\r\nwere not devoted to Zeus, but were marks of honor (ἐν ἄθλου λόγῳ)\r\nbestowed on the victors. These statements of the Periegete have given\r\nrise to a good deal of fruitless discussion. Furtwaengler follows\r\nPausanias in saying that the right of setting up statues was _ein\r\nwesentlicher Theil des Siegespreises_.[369] That such erections at\r\nOlympia were considered as high honors is implied by the wording of\r\nmany of the inscriptions which have been recovered from the bases of\r\nthe statues. Thus on that of the boxer Euthymos are the words εἰκόνα\r\nδ’ ἔστησεν τήνδε βροτοῖς ἐσορᾶν.[370] Furtwaengler, therefore, has\r\npromulgated the theory that the victor statues at Olympia were in no\r\nsense votive, though they were considered to be the property of the god\r\nin whose grove they stood. He cites the fact that the inscribed bases\r\nof such monuments down to the first century B. C., with the exception\r\nof a few metrical epigrams, make no mention of dedications, and that in\r\nthese exceptions the word ἀνέθηκε was added for metrical reasons,[371]\r\nwhile during the same centuries regular votive offerings (ἀναθῆματα)\r\ninvariably have the word ἀνέθηκε.[372] One inscription, that from the\r\nbase of the statue of Euthymos of Lokroi, is both metrical and in\r\nprose;[373] but it seems to have been changed later in two places, the\r\nsecond line originally ending in a pentameter, and the third line, with\r\nἀνέθηκε, being added afterwards.[374] Also the prose inscription[375]\r\nreferred by Roehl to the statue of the wrestler Milo is rejected\r\nby Dittenberger. The oldest prose inscription which makes a votive\r\noffering out of a victor statue at Olympia is that of Thaliarchos,\r\nwho won his second victory in boxing some time between 40 and 30 B.\r\nC.[376] Then follow certain prose inscriptions of imperial times.[377]\r\nDittenberger concludes that for four hundred years there is no case\r\nof such a dedication.[378] From the evidence of the inscriptions\r\nfrom statue bases, therefore, it is clear that the distinction made\r\nby Pausanias between honor and victor statues did not hold good\r\nin his day, since the words ἀνάθημα and ἀνέθηκε were then used on\r\nvictor monuments at Olympia, as the inscriptions of the imperial age\r\njust cited show, but that it did hold good for centuries before the\r\nRoman period. Pausanias must have based his statement, therefore,\r\nnot on observation, but on the words of some earlier writer.[379]\r\nFurtwaengler’s reasoning has been followed pretty generally by\r\narchæologists.[380] While some, however, leave the question in\r\ndoubt,[381] others are opposed to the idea that these statues were not\r\nvotive. Thus R. Schoell believes that the victor monuments were as\r\ntruly ἀναθήματα as the olive crowns.[382] Reisch, who has discussed the\r\nquestion at length,[383] believes, in opposition to the earlier view of\r\nFurtwaengler, that everything within the Altis must always _ipso facto_\r\nhave been regarded as dedications to the god. This would explain the\r\nfrequent omission of the name of the god, which would be superfluous,\r\nthe victor being content with inscribing his own name and the contest\r\nin which he was victorious. Even the name of the contest does not\r\nalways appear.[384] Reisch explains the omission of the formula ἀνέθηκε\r\nin earlier inscriptions on the ground of epigrammatic brevity.[385]\r\n\r\nThe truth must lie somewhere between the extremes represented by\r\nthe views of Furtwaengler and Reisch. Some athlete statues may have\r\nbeen votive, while others were not. Thus Rouse argues[386] that\r\noriginally all victor statues at Olympia were as truly votive as\r\nequestrian groups, and as truly as those athlete statues continued to\r\nbe, which were dedicated in the victors’ native towns. Those inscribed\r\nwith ἀνέθηκε at Olympia must have been votive, for we should take\r\nthe dedicator at his word, instead of believing the formula to be\r\nadded merely to make the verse scan.[387] There is no reason why an\r\nathlete should not dedicate a statue of himself, representing himself\r\nas forever standing in the presence of the god, as well as a diskos\r\nor jumping-weights; for it was customary to make votive offerings\r\nrepresentative of the events, and this could be done best by presenting\r\nthe athlete in a statue which showed the characteristic attitude or the\r\nappropriate attributes. Rouse furthermore believes that a change was\r\nslowly wrought in the course of centuries, by which the original votive\r\noffering became a means of self-glorification. Equestrian victors owed\r\ntheir victories not to themselves, but to their horses, cars, drivers,\r\nand jockeys; in such cases the group was a thing apart from the owner.\r\nOnly seldom did such victors dedicate statues of themselves alone. Even\r\nwhen the victor added a statue of himself to the group, still it was\r\nthe chariot and not the statue which was emphasized.[388] On the other\r\nhand the ordinary gymnic victor relied on himself—on his strength,\r\nendurance, courage, and other qualities; and in representing the\r\ncontest the victor himself had to be represented. Consequently, by the\r\nfifth century B. C., if not earlier, the statues of athletes had become\r\nmemorials of personal glory.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS MEMORIALS TO VICTORS.\r\n\r\nA statue was not the only memorial erected in honor of an Olympic\r\nvictor, though it was by far the commonest. We have already mentioned\r\nthe bronze inscribed diskos dedicated by the pentathlete P. Asklepiades\r\nin the third century A. D.[389] A green stone leaping-weight inscribed\r\nwith the name Κῳδίας appears to have been dedicated by a victor.[390]\r\nIn two cases stelæ were set up in honor of victors.[391] A curious\r\ndedication was a bronze chapel, which the Sikyonian tyrant Myron\r\ndedicated to Apollo at Olympia.[392] In later days it became part of\r\nthe treasury of the Sikyonians.[393] Outside Olympia various monuments\r\ncommemorating Olympic victors were set up. These will be discussed in\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONORARY STATUES.\r\n\r\nAt Olympia, as elsewhere in Greece, statues were set up to men\r\n_honoris causa_. Such statues would be dedicated by admirers, either\r\nindividuals or states. They were in no sense intended to honor the god,\r\nthough at Olympia they might be classed as ἀναθήματα, just as victor\r\nstatues, merely because they were erected in the sacred precinct. They\r\nwere granted to individuals not as a privilege, as victor statues\r\nwere, but as free gifts. Dio Chrysostom gives the difference between\r\nvictor statues—which he classes as ἀναθήματα—and such honor statues\r\nin these words: ταῦτα (_i. e._, victor statues) γάρ ἐστιν ἀναθήματα·\r\nαἱ δ’ εἰκόνες τιμαί· κἀκεῖνα (victor statues) δέδοται τοῖς θεοῖς,\r\nταῦτα δὲ (honor statues) τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ἀνδράσιν οἵπερ εἰσὶν ἔγγιστα\r\nαὐτῶν.[394] Pliny records that the Athenians inaugurated the custom\r\nof a state setting up statues in honor of men at the public expense\r\nwith the statues of the tyrannicides Harmodios and Aristogeiton by the\r\nsculptor Antenor, which were erected in 509 B. C., the year in which\r\nthe tyrants were expelled.[395] He adds that a “refined ambition” led\r\nto a universal adoption of the custom and that statues began to adorn\r\npublic places everywhere and later on even private houses. The custom\r\ngrew apace in the later history of Greece. Demetrios of Phaleron is\r\nsaid to have had over three hundred statues erected in his honor during\r\nhis short régime of about a year in Athens. The Diadochoi and the Roman\r\nemperors enthusiastically took over the custom. Pliny gives several\r\nRoman examples of it.[396]\r\n\r\nAt Olympia Pausanias mentions honorary statues erected to thirty-five\r\nmen for various reasons.[397] To several of these men more than one\r\nstatue was erected.[398] The greater number of these statues were\r\nerected to kings and princes, to those of Sparta,[399] Athens,[400]\r\nEpeiros,[401] Sicily,[402] Macedonia, and Alexander’s Empire.[403]\r\nOne was erected in honor of the philosopher Aristotle,[404] one in\r\nhonor of the rhetorician Gorgias of Leontini,[405] one in honor of a\r\nhunter,[406] another in honor of a flute-player,[407] and many others\r\nin honor of public and private men. These statues were set up for\r\nvarious reasons. Archidamas III of Sparta had his statues erected\r\nto his memory because he was the only Spartan king who died abroad\r\nand did not receive a formal burial. Kylon had a statue erected\r\nby the Aitolians because he freed the Eleans from the tyranny of\r\nAristotimos.[408] Pythes of Abdera was thus honored by his soldiers\r\nbecause of his military prowess.[409] Philonides of Crete was, as\r\nwe learn from the recovered inscription on his statue base, the\r\ncourier of Alexander the Great.[410] Pythokritos was honored for his\r\nflute-playing, though he does not appear to have been a victor.[411]\r\nThe Palaians of Kephallenia honored Timoptolis of Elis,[412] and the\r\nAitolians honored the Elean Olaidas[413] for unknown reasons. At least\r\nseven, if not eight, of those thus honored with statues were Eleans.\r\nSome of the men who had honor statues were also victors at Olympia, a\r\nfact which would appear on the inscribed base. Thus Aratos, the son\r\nof Kleinias of Sikyon, the statesman, had a statue erected to him by\r\nthe Corinthians. This was doubtless an honor statue, though Pausanias\r\nalso says he was a chariot-victor.[414] On the other hand, the statue\r\nerected in honor of the pentathlete Stomios was probably a victor\r\nmonument, though Pausanias says that its inscription records that he\r\nwas an Elean cavalry general who challenged the enemy to a duel, in\r\nwhich he was slain.[415] In some cases it is hard to decide whether the\r\nstatue is honorary or victor in character. In the course of time honor\r\nstatues multiplied, while those of athletes decreased. The recovered\r\ninscriptions on the latter decrease steadily in the fourth and third\r\ncenturies B. C., revive again in the second and first, and decrease\r\nin the first Christian century. They cease almost entirely after the\r\nmiddle of the second century A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTOR STATUES AT OLYMPIA.\r\n\r\nPLATES 2-7 AND FIGURES 3-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a few insignificant remnants of the forest of victor statues\r\nwhich once stood in the Altis at Olympia were unearthed by the German\r\nexcavators. Most of these statues already in antiquity had been carried\r\noff to Italy,[416] while those which escaped the spoliation of the\r\nRoman masters of Greece were destroyed at the hands of the invading\r\nhordes of barbarians in the early Dark Ages. Consequently only here and\r\nthere in modern museums can isolated fragments of these originals be\r\ndiscovered, which have accidentally survived the ravages of time and\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn the almost complete absence of originals, therefore, we depend\r\nfor our knowledge of them on a variety of sources. In attempting to\r\nreconstruct them we have two main sources of information to aid us,\r\nthe literary and the archæological. To the former belong the many\r\ninscriptions found on the statue bases recovered at Olympia, which\r\ncontain the name and native city of the victor, the athletic contest\r\nin which his victory was won, and frequently some account of his\r\nformer athletic history; epigrams preserved in the Greek anthologies\r\nand elsewhere, some of which agree with those inscribed on the statue\r\nbases; more or less definite statements of scholiasts and the classical\r\nwriters in general, especially the detailed account of the monuments\r\nof Olympia contained in the fifth and sixth books of the Ἑλλάδος\r\nπεριήγησις of Pausanias, who visited the Altis during the reign of\r\nMarcus Aurelius Antoninus,[417] and also the somewhat systematic\r\ntreatment of Greek sculptors and their works in the elder Pliny’s\r\nchapters on the History of Art.[418] To the latter source belong the\r\nremnants of statues in bronze and marble found at Olympia, as well as\r\nthe recovered bases, on many of which the extant footmarks enable us\r\nto recover the pose of the statues which formerly stood upon them.\r\nFinally, in reconstructing these athlete statues, an intimate knowledge\r\nof Greek sculpture in all its phases and periods is essential. Here,\r\nas in the general study of Greek sculpture, where the destruction of\r\noriginals has been almost complete, we are largely dependent on Roman\r\ncopies which were executed by more or less skilled workmen, chiefly\r\nfor wealthy Roman patrons of art who wished to use them to decorate\r\nthe public buildings, baths, palaces, and villas of Rome and other\r\nItalian cities. A careful study of these copies has evolved a series\r\nof groups, which have been assigned with more or less probability to\r\nthis or that artist.[419] Representations of the various poses of the\r\nathlete statues of Olympia and elsewhere are found also on every sort\r\nof sculptured and painted works—reliefs, vases, coins, gems—which are,\r\ntherefore, valuable in any attempt to reconstruct the attitude of a\r\ngiven statue.\r\n\r\nTaking into account all these sources of knowledge, it has been\r\npossible to reach tolerable certainty in reconstructing the main types\r\nof these victor monuments, and in identifying schools, masters, and\r\nindividual works. This identification of athlete statues, especially\r\nthose belonging to the fifth and fourth centuries B. C., among the\r\ncountless Roman works which people modern museums, has already been\r\nachieved in many cases by archælogical investigations. The work of\r\nmany masters of the archaic period and of the most important bronze\r\nsculptors of the great period of Greek art has been illustrated by\r\nsuch ascriptions; especially that of Myron, who represented figures\r\nin rhythmic action full of life and vigor; of the elder Polykleitos,\r\nwho was a master in representing standing figures at rest fashioned\r\naccording to a mathematical system of proportions; of Lysippos, who\r\nintroduced a new canon of proportions in opposition to that of his\r\npredecessor Polykleitos, and who inaugurated the naturalistic tendency\r\nin Greek art, which was destined to he carried to such unbecoming\r\nlengths in succeeding centuries. The further identification of such\r\nstatues, as our knowledge of the tendencies and traditions of the\r\nschools of Greek sculpture and our sources of information about\r\nathletic art become more and more extended, will be one of the most\r\nimportant tasks of the archæologist in the future.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the appearance of individual types of these\r\nmonuments, we shall consider certain general characteristics common to\r\nall of them. Long ago K. O. Mueller[420] summed up the common features\r\nof victor statues in these words: _Kurzgelocktes Haar, tuechtige\r\nGlieder, eine kraeftige Ausbildung der Gestalt und verhaeltnissmaessig\r\nkleine Koepfe characterisiren die ganze Gattung von Figuren; die\r\nzerschlagenen Ohren und die hervorgetriebenen Muskeln insbesondere die\r\nFaustkaempfer und Pankratiasten._ Though in the main this excellent\r\nsummary still holds good, we are now in a position to correct it in\r\npart and to add other equally characteristic features to it. We shall\r\nbriefly discuss, therefore, in the light of recent investigations,\r\ncertain of the characteristics common to this _genre_ of sculpture—the\r\nmaterial and size of these statues, their nudity and fashion of wearing\r\nthe hair, their twofold division into iconic and aniconic, their\r\nproportions, and, lastly, the assimilation of their appearance to\r\nwell-known types of hero or god.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF VICTOR STATUES.\r\n\r\nIn another section[421] we show that the overwhelming majority of the\r\nstatues in the Altis were of bronze, though other materials, stone and\r\nwood, were also used in some cases. As to the size of these statues,\r\nno hard and fast rule seems to have been followed, but we may assume\r\nfrom the evidence at hand that they were in general life-size.[422]\r\nLucian would have us believe that the Hellanodikai did not allow\r\nvictors to set up statues larger than life.[423] We know, however, that\r\nthere were exceptions to such a rule. In all probability the statue\r\nof Polydamas of Skotoussa by Lysippos, which Pausanias says stood on\r\na high pedestal, was larger than life-size, if we may conjecture from\r\nits elevated position and the probable source of Pausanias’ remark that\r\nhe “was the tallest of men, if we except the so-called heroes and the\r\nmortal race which preceded the heroes.”[424] The traces of footprints\r\non the recovered pedestal of the statue of the Athenian pancratiast\r\nKallias by the sculptor Mikon show that the statue was larger than\r\nlife-size.[425] The footprints on the base of the statue of the Rhodian\r\nboxer Eukles by the Argive Naukydes are about 33 cm. long, and so the\r\nstatue was slightly over life-size.[426] We know the actual size of\r\nat least two of these Olympic statues. The scholiast on Pindar, _Ol._\r\nVII, Argum., on the basis of a fragment from Aristotle’s lost work\r\non the Olympic victors and one from the little-known writer Apollas\r\nPonticus,[427] says that the statue of the Rhodian boxer Diagoras was\r\n4 cubits and 5 fingers tall,[428] _i. e._, about 6 feet 4.5 inches,\r\nsomewhat over life-size.[429] From the same scholiast we learn that the\r\nstatue of the son of Diagoras, the pancratiast Damagetos, was 4 cubits\r\nhigh, or less than that of the father by 5 fingers, and consequently\r\njust under 6 feet.[430] The footprints on the base of the statue of\r\nthe boxer Aristion by the elder Polykleitos are 29 cm. long, and so\r\nthe statue was just life-size.[431] There are several examples of such\r\nlife-size statues,[432] while others are slightly below life-size.[433]\r\nThe Polykleitan statue of a boxer in Kassel is under life-size.[434]\r\nThe marble head of a statue found at Olympia, which we ascribe to\r\nPhilandridas, the Akarnanian pancratiast, by Lysippos, (Frontispiece\r\nand Fig. 69) is also under life-size,[435] as is also that of the\r\npancratiast Agias found at Delphi (Pl. 27 and Fig. 68). These two are\r\nin harmony with Pliny’s statement that Lysippos made the heads of his\r\nstatues relatively small.[436] Perhaps this statement of Pliny was the\r\nbasis of the opinion of Mueller recorded above that “comparatively\r\nsmall heads” characterize the whole _genre_ of victor statues. We\r\nhave in the preceding chapter mentioned the marble fragments of the\r\nstatues of boy victors, two-fifths to two-thirds life-size, found at\r\nOlympia.[437] The two marble helmeted heads of the archaic period\r\nfound there, which we shall later ascribe to hoplite victors (Fig.\r\n30), are exactly life-size.[438] Of the bronze fragments recovered at\r\nOlympia,[439] the head of a boxer of the fourth century B. C. (Fig.\r\n61, A and B) is life-size,[440] while the extraordinarily beautifully\r\nsculptured right arm ascribed to a boy victor by Furtwaengler[441] is a\r\nlittle under life-size.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUDITY OF VICTOR STATUES.\r\n\r\nMost of the victor statues at Olympia were nude.[442] In the early\r\nperiod all athletes wore the loin-cloth. Cretan frescoes show it\r\nwas the custom in the early Mediterranean world. The athletes of\r\nHomer girded themselves on entering the games of Patroklos,[443] and\r\nthe girdle appears in the earliest athletic scenes on vases.[444]\r\nThroughout the historic period, however, the Greeks entered their\r\ncontests in complete nudity, and this nudity naturally was carried over\r\ninto athletic sculpture. Pliny’s[445] statement, _Graeca res nihil\r\nvelare_, is, therefore, correct, despite another of Philostratos to\r\nthe effect that at Delphi, at the Isthmus, and everywhere except at\r\nOlympia, the athlete wore the coarse mantle.[446] The beginning of the\r\nchange from wearing the loin-cloth to complete nudity was ascribed\r\nto an accident. The Megarian runner Orsippos in the 15th Ol. (= 720\r\nB. C.) dropped his loin-cloth while running, either accidentally or\r\nbecause it impeded him.[447] The story was commemorated by an epigram,\r\nperhaps by Simonides, which was inscribed on his tomb at Megara.[448]\r\nA copy of this epigram in the Megarian dialect, executed in late\r\nRoman or Byzantine times, when the original had become illegible, was\r\ndiscovered at Megara in 1769 and shows that its original was the source\r\nof Pausanias’ remarks.[449] Philostratos says that athletes contended\r\nnude at Olympia, either because of the summer heat or a mishap which\r\nbefell the woman Pherenike of Rhodes. She accompanied her son, the boy\r\nboxer Peisirhodos, to Olympia disguised as a trainer, and in her joy\r\nat his victory she leaped over the barrier and disclosed her sex.[450]\r\nThe practice does not appear to have become universal with all athletes\r\nin all the competitions at Olympia until some time after Orsippos’ day,\r\nsince Thukydides says the abandonment of the girdle took place shortly\r\nbefore his time and that in his day it was still retained by certain\r\nforeigners, notably Asiatics, in boxing and wrestling matches.[451] The\r\nchange is not illustrated in sculpture. The earliest victor statues,\r\n_i. e._, those of the “Apollo” type, are all nude. The nudity of\r\nthis type shows an essential difference between Greek and foreigner\r\nand also between the later Greek and his rude ancestor. Plato gives\r\nthe use of the loin-cloth as an example of convention, by which what\r\nseems peculiar to one generation becomes usual to another.[452] We see\r\nthe change, however, in vase-paintings. The loin-cloth is common on\r\nseventh-century vases, but is gradually left off in later ones.\r\n\r\nThere were exceptions to the rule of nudity. Statues of charioteers\r\nwere usually partly or wholly dressed in the long chiton, a custom\r\nexplained in various ways.[453] The Delphi bronze _Charioteer_ (Fig.\r\n66) is a good example of a draped one. Another _auriga_ almost nude is\r\nshown on a decadrachm of Akragas in the British Museum, dating from the\r\nend of the fifth century B. C.[454] There are also several examples\r\nof nude charioteers.[455] The Olympic runners and athletes generally\r\nwere also bareheaded and barefoot. The only exceptions were the\r\nhoplite-runners, who wore helmets, and possibly charioteers, who wore\r\nsandals.[456] Statues of women victors also were draped. Though Ionian\r\nwomen could witness games,[457] and Spartan girls took part in athletic\r\ncontests with boys,[458] women were rigorously excluded from crossing\r\nthe Alpheios during the festival at Olympia.[459] They were allowed,\r\nhowever, to enter horses for the chariot-race and, if victorious, to\r\nset up monuments.[460] Only one woman was allowed to witness the games,\r\nthe priestess of the old earth cult of Demeter Chamyne, who could\r\nsit at the altar in the stadion during the contests.[461] Pausanias\r\nnotes but one exception of a woman infringing the rule of admission,\r\nPherenike, the mother of the Rhodian victor Peisirhodos already\r\nmentioned. She was pardoned because her father, brothers, and son were\r\nvictors, but the umpires passed a law that thereafter even trainers\r\nshould be nude.[462] While excluded from the games proper, women had\r\ntheir own festival at Olympia in honor of Hera, which was known as the\r\n_Heraia_. These games occurred every four years[463] and included a\r\nfoot-race between virgins, in which the course was one-sixth less than\r\nthe stadion. The victress received an olive crown and also a share of\r\nthe cow sacrificed to Hera, and was allowed to set up a painted picture\r\nof herself in the Heraion.[464] It has been generally assumed that the\r\nstatue of a girl runner in the Galleria dei Candelabri of the Vatican\r\nrepresents one of these victresses (Plate 2),[465] since Pausanias\r\nsays they ran with their hair down and wore a tunic which reached to\r\njust above the knees, leaving the right shoulder bare to the breast.\r\nThat the statue represents a girl runner seems certain,[466] but that\r\nit can be referred to one of the Olympic girl victresses is doubtful.\r\nThe description of Pausanias fits it in many respects, except that\r\nthe chiton of the statue is too short, and he does not mention the\r\ngirdle just below the bosom. Furthermore, he does not mention statues\r\nof girl victresses, but only pictures. Nothing can be argued from the\r\npalm-branch on the tree-stump, except that the Roman copyist thought it\r\nthe statue of a victress. It does not necessarily refer to a victress\r\nat Olympia, for Pausanias elsewhere says that the palm-branch was given\r\nat many contests.[467] The statue represents a young girl leaning\r\nforward awaiting the signal to start,[468] but it is impossible to say\r\nto what games we should refer it. There were girls’ contests in and out\r\nof Greece—such as at the _Dionysia_ in Sparta[469] and in her colony\r\nKyrene.[470] Such games were also held in the stadion of Domitian at\r\nRome.[471] In fact the Palatine estate of the Barberini, from whom the\r\nVatican acquired the statue, embraced the area of the old stadion of\r\nDomitian on the Palatine. It is probably of Doric workmanship, as it\r\ncertainly represents a Dorian victress, though not necessarily by a\r\nPeloponnesian sculptor.[472]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATHLETIC HAIR-FASHION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 2\r\n\r\nMarble Statue of a Girl Runner. Vatican Museum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nThe assumption long held that short hair was always characteristic of\r\nthe athlete is incorrect.[473] It is controverted equally by literary\r\nevidence and by the monuments. The Homeric Greek took pride in his\r\nlong hair,[474] and doubtless the contestants at the games of Patroklos\r\nin the Iliad had long hair. Long hair was worn by some Athenians\r\nthroughout Athenian history. From the end of the fifth century B. C.,\r\nlong hair was regarded as a mark of effeminacy[475] and was regularly\r\nworn only by the knights.[476] Short hair was worn as a sign of\r\nmourning in Athens from early days down.[477] Only the slaves regularly\r\nwore very short hair in the fifth century B. C.[478] The change to\r\nshort hair in Athens was certainly due to the influence of the palæstra\r\nand to athletics in general.[479] We see just the opposite custom in\r\nvogue in Sparta. There, according to the code of Lykourgos,[480] men\r\nwere compelled to wear long hair and children short hair. Thus the\r\nheroes of Leonidas entered the battle of Thermopylæ after combing\r\ntheir long locks.[481] After the Persian wars only children and men\r\nwith laconizing or aristocratic sympathies[482] wore their hair long\r\nat Athens. When boys arrived at the age of ἔφηβοι, they had their\r\nhair cut at the feast of the οἰνιστήρια[483] and dedicated it to a\r\ngod.[484] Soon after the Persian war period, athletes wore their hair\r\nshort. Before that time, the wearing of long hair had already been\r\ndiscarded for obvious reasons in wrestling.[485] Similarly, in boxing\r\nand the pankration long hair was in the way, and was therefore early\r\nbraided into two long plaits which were wound around the head in a\r\npeculiar way and tied into a knot at the top, the so-called Attic\r\nκρωβύλος, the oftenest mentioned manner of dressing the hair in Greek\r\nliterature.[486] The oldest notice of this style of wearing the hair\r\nis found in a fragment of Asios.[487] Herakleides Ponticus[488] says\r\nit was used up to the time of the Persian wars. The _locus classicus_\r\nis in Thukydides, who says it was worn in his day by old people\r\nonly.[489] Earlier young men wore it,[490] but it went out of fashion\r\nbetween 470 and 460 B. C. In this connection we should mention that the\r\nprofessional athlete under the Roman Empire wore his hair uncut and\r\ntied up in an unsightly topknot known as the _cirrus_.[491]\r\n\r\nThe monumental evidence bears out the literary. Thus, on old Corinthian\r\nclay tablets freemen are represented with long hair, while slaves\r\nhave short hair.[492] Hydrias from Caere (Cerveteri) and paintings\r\nfrom Klazomenai show that the Ionians wore their hair short for the\r\nfirst time in the sixth century B. C., the custom not becoming general\r\nuntil the fifth. Older Spartan monuments represent the hair long.[493]\r\nAttic vases show long hair on men until the second half of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., when the black-figured vase masters began to represent\r\nthem with short hair, a custom becoming general in the first half of\r\nthe fifth. In statuary the _Diskobolos_ of Myron (Pls. 21, 26, and\r\nFigs. 34, 35) has short hair, and most statues of athletes before it\r\nhave long hair, while most after it have short. Before the time of the\r\n_Diskobolos_, b.-f. and early r.-f. vase-painters often represented\r\nathletes with braided hair in the fashion of the warriors on the Aegina\r\npediments. When short hair began to be used on athlete statues, these\r\nolder braids were often replaced by victor bands.[494] We may roughly\r\nsummarize by saying that statues before the date of the _Diskobolos_\r\nwhich do not have long hair are probably those of athletes and not of\r\ngods, and, in any case, if they have braids bound up in the fashion of\r\nthe κρωβύλος, they are almost always statues of athletes.[495] As for\r\nshort hair on representations of gods, Furtwaengler has shown that it\r\nappears only after the middle of the fifth century B. C.[496] Prior\r\nto that date the hair of divinities fell over the neck and shoulders\r\nin curls, as in the statue of the _Olympian Zeus_ by Pheidias. By the\r\ntime of Perikles, however, short curly hair reached only to the nape\r\nof the neck on statues of Zeus, and this style frequently appears on\r\nfigures of the god on Attic vases of that period. Dionysos has short\r\nhair for the first time on the Parthenon frieze.[497] Furtwaengler has\r\nshown that Pheidias did not invent the short bound-up hair for goddess\r\ntypes, as we see it in the _Lemnian Athena_, but that he borrowed it\r\nfrom works already in existence.[498] Though the style was unknown in\r\nthe archaic period, it appears on helmeted heads of Athena of the early\r\nfifth century B. C. showing Peloponnesian style—on coins, statuettes,\r\nreliefs, etc. It appears in Attic art exclusively on bareheaded types\r\nof Athena of the period just prior to that of the _Lemnia_.\r\n\r\nBulle[499] has gone carefully into the technique of the hair by\r\ndifferent Greek artists. In archaic times this was “_ein, man darf\r\nsagen, unmoegliches Problem_.” The primitive means at the disposal\r\nof the early artist made it impossible to render the hair naturally\r\nand hence it was conventionalized. Two styles arose in archaic times,\r\nwhich endured with modifications all through Greek art. The one was the\r\npictorial (_malerisch_), where only the general appearance of the hair\r\nwas represented, the merest necessary plastic form being added.[500]\r\nPainting here helped the shortcomings of the sculptor to some extent.\r\nThe second style was the plastic (_plastisch_), where individual locks\r\nwere attempted. The plastic use of light and shade made the use of\r\ncolor now less necessary. Such examples as the _Korai_ of the Akropolis\r\nMuseum and the Rampin head in the Louvre show the difficulty which\r\nthe early artist encountered in representing hair plastically. In\r\nthe Rampin head[501] we see examples of three sorts of plastic hair\r\ntreatment: the pearl-string (_Perlschnuerre_) on the neck, grained hair\r\n(_Koerner_) in the beard, and snail-volutes (_geperlte Schnecken_) on\r\nthe forehead. None of the three seems to belong integrally to the head,\r\nbut each appears to have been pasted on. The pearl-string fashion was\r\nfirst used in the soft _poros_ stone and was only later successfully\r\ntransferred to marble. During the severe style of Greek sculpture,\r\nboth fashions, pictorial and plastic, were used, as we see them in the\r\npediment groups from the temple of Zeus at Olympia. In the period of\r\nPheidias the plastic treatment was used almost exclusively, as we see\r\nin the _Lemnian Athena_. In the next century impressionism came in,\r\nthough the plastic treatment still continued, for we see it in the\r\nbronze work of Lysippos and the marble work of Praxiteles. The old\r\npictorial treatment was revived again in the later Hellenistic age.\r\n\r\n\r\nICONIC AND ANICONIC STATUES.\r\n\r\nIn a well-known passage Pliny says that “the ancients did not make\r\nany statue of individuals unless they deserved immortality by some\r\ndistinction, originally by a victory at some sacred games, especially\r\nthose of Olympia, where it was the custom to dedicate statues of\r\nall those who had conquered, and portrait statues if they had\r\nconquered three times. These are called iconic.”[502] Many solutions\r\nof this passage have been offered. Older commentators, as Hirt and\r\nVisconti,[503] interpreted Pliny’s word _iconicas_ as life-size\r\nstatues. Scherer, however, easily refuted this idea and showed that the\r\nadjective εἰκονικός, though ambiguous in its meaning, had nothing to do\r\nwith size, but referred rather to an individual as opposed to a typical\r\nsense in relation to statuary. In his explanation he referred to the\r\nwords of Lessing in the _Laokoön_: _es ist das Ideal eines gewissen\r\nMenschen, nicht das Ideal eines Menschen ueberhaupt_.[504] Nowadays\r\nall scholars agree that Pliny’s word refers to portrait statues.[505]\r\nHowever, Pliny’s dictum about the right of setting up portrait statues\r\nis certainly open to doubt.[506] It can not have been true of monuments\r\nerected before the fourth century B. C., when portrait statues were\r\nrare. Portraiture was a form of realism and was a product of the later\r\nperiod of Greek art—especially after the time of Lysippos. In the\r\nfourth century B. C. we find one well-attested exception to Pliny’s\r\nrule. The discovered inscription from the base of a monument erected to\r\nthe horse-racer Xenombrotos of Cos,[507] reads (fifth line): τοῖ[ος],\r\nὁποῖο[ν] ὁ[ρ]ᾷς Ξεινόμβροτο[ς]. These words indubitably point to a\r\nportrait statue. However, neither the recovered epigram nor Pausanias\r\nindicates anything about this victor being a τρισολυμπιονίκης, and\r\nconsequently he appears not to have merited a portrait statue.[508]\r\nPliny’s statement can be explained in many ways: it may be apocryphal,\r\nor different usages may have fitted different periods; or the rule may\r\nhave held good only for gymnic victors and not for equestrian ones,\r\nwhich, being strictly votive in character, may not have been restricted\r\nto its operation.[509]\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT STATUES.\r\n\r\nPausanias mentions the monuments of several victors at Olympia who\r\nwere entitled to portrait statues on the strength of Pliny’s rule,\r\nthough we have no indication that they were so honored. Thus he\r\nmentions the statues of Dikon,[510] Sostratos,[511] Philinos,[512]\r\nand Gorgos.[513] The early fifth-century boxer Euthymos[514] also won\r\nthree victories, but at a time before we should expect a portrait\r\nstatue. The Periegete also mentions several victors who won three or\r\nmore times, though he does not say that they had any statues, portrait\r\nor otherwise.[515] Percy Gardner[516] has shown how erroneous is the\r\nprevailing view that the Greeks neglected portraiture in their art and\r\nleft it for the Romans to develop. He shows that Greek artists of the\r\nthird and second centuries B. C. left a great many portraits of the\r\nhighest artistic value and that portraits of Romans before the time\r\nof Augustus, and the best Roman examples during the Empire, were made\r\nby Greek sculptors. The number of Greek portraits in our museums,\r\nespecially in Rome, is very great.[517] From archaic times down to the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century B. C. we should not expect portraiture. In\r\nthe earlier period, therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between\r\nstatues of gods and those of men. In the great period of Greek art,\r\nfrom the time of Perikles on to that of Alexander, the general tendency\r\nof Greek sculpture was so ideal that portraits, when they existed,\r\nseem impersonal. The later copyists of portraits also idealized them.\r\nThus Pliny, in speaking of Kresilas’ portrait of Perikles, says that\r\nthis artist _nobiles viros nobiliores fecit_—in other words, that\r\nhe idealized them.[518] The portraits of Alexander were especially\r\nidealized. In the first half of the fourth century we first hear of\r\nrealistic portraiture. Thus Demetrios, who flourished 380-360 B.\r\nC.,[519] made a “very beautiful” statue of a Corinthian general named\r\nPelichos, which Lucian[520] says had a fat belly, bald head, hair\r\nfloating in the wind, and prominent veins, “like the man himself.”[521]\r\nExcept for the hair this description by the satirist seems to have been\r\ncorrect. At the end of the fourth century B. C. anatomical detail began\r\nto be shown in sculpture. Largely under the influence of Lysippos,\r\nthe personality of victors began to be emphasized in figure and face\r\nin a very realistic way. We can distinguish between such portraits of\r\nvictors before and after the time of Lysippos.[522] Pliny[523] says\r\nthat Lysistratos, the brother of Lysippos, was the first to obtain\r\nportraits by making a plaster mould on the features and so to render\r\nlikenesses exactly, as “previous artists had only tried to make them as\r\nbeautiful as possible.” In any case, by the time of Lysippos realistic\r\nportraiture began to be emphasized. We see it at Olympia in the later\r\nbronze pancratiast’s head found there (Fig. 61, A and B), and in a\r\nstill more revolting style in the _Seated Boxer_ of the Museo delle\r\nTerme (Pl. 16, and Fig. 27).\r\n\r\nThe reason why the privilege of erecting portrait statues was given\r\nso seldom to Olympic victors was probably not because it was a highly\r\nesteemed honor. The real reason seems to have been that portraiture,\r\nwith its tendency to realism, subordinated beauty to that realism and\r\nso conflicted with the Greek artistic ideal. The Thebans had a law\r\nwhich forbade caricature and commanded artists to make their statues\r\nmore beautiful than the models. The Greeks worshiped beauty and hated\r\nugliness. Many games in Greece were held in honor of personal beauty.\r\nThus a contest of manly beauty among old men (ἀγὼν εὐανδρίας) was a\r\npart of the Panathenaic games at Athens.[524] A contest of beauty among\r\nwomen, originating in the time of Kypselos, king of Arkadia, was kept\r\nup until the time of Athenæus.[525] We hear of contests of beauty in\r\nElis, at which three prizes were given,[526] and of similar ones on the\r\nislands of Tenedos and Lesbos.[527] The Crotonian Philippos, who won at\r\nOlympia in an unknown contest about 520 B. C., was honored after his\r\ndeath by the people of Egesta with a _heroön_ and sacrifices because of\r\nhis beauty.[528] At Tanagra, in Bœotia, the most beautiful ephebe\r\nwas chosen to carry a ram on his shoulders around the city wall at\r\nthe festival of Hermes Kriophoros.[529] At Aigion in Achaia the most\r\nbeautiful boy was anciently chosen to be priest of Zeus.[530] The most\r\nbeautiful youths among the Spartans and Cretans dedicated offerings\r\nto Eros before battle.[531] These and similar examples show the Greek\r\nfeeling for beauty. The representation of passion and violence was\r\nforeign to the spirit of the best Greek art; it was rather the “quiet\r\ngrandeur” (_Stille Groesse_) or “repose,” of which Winckelmann made so\r\nmuch, that was characteristic of that art. In Homer both men and gods,\r\nwhen wounded, shriek. Philoktetes, in the drama of Sophokles, wails\r\nthroughout a whole act, when suffering from a gangrened foot. With\r\nthe poets Zeus casts his thunderbolt in anger, but Pheidias has him\r\nhold it quietly in his hand. So we can see why portrait statues were\r\nrare at Olympia, where the representation of manly beauty and vigor\r\nwas the rule. They were ruled out, not because of their increasing\r\nthe honor accorded to the victor, but rather because they honored his\r\negotism.[532]\r\n\r\n\r\nANICONIC STATUES.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, since only victors who had won three or more contests at\r\nOlympia could set up iconic statues, the great majority of statues\r\nthere represented some ideal type of common applicability, in which\r\nthere was no attempt to show the individual features of this or that\r\nvictor, but rather the typical athlete of muscular build. The older\r\nstatues were merely variations of a few types which were held to be\r\nappropriate to the purpose. In process of time these few types in their\r\ntreatment of details gradually approached truth to nature; this was\r\nespecially characteristic of the Peloponnesian schools, which adopted\r\nthe _Doryphoros_ of Polykleitos as their norm of proportions. Statues\r\nof victors were the stock subject of the closely related schools of\r\nArgos and Sikyon.[533] Doubtless, as E. A. Gardner says,[534] there\r\nexisted at Olympia itself a school of subordinate artists, who filled\r\nthe regular demand for victor statues. However, some of these statues,\r\nespecially those of the fifth and fourth centuries B. C., as we see\r\nthem in originals and in Roman copies, and read the æsthetic judgments\r\nof them in Greek writers, were real works of art.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆSTHETIC JUDGMENTS OF CLASSICAL WRITERS.\r\n\r\nThe literary evidence for Greek sculpture is, for the most part, very\r\nunsatisfactory. Though classical writers were uncritical and not fond\r\nof analysis, still they have left us some useful opinions about works\r\nof sculpture and painting. The history and criticism of sculpture\r\nbegan in Greece, in the fourth century B. C., with the Peripatetics.\r\nAristotle, whose observations on painting and sculpture were slight,\r\ndid not despise the “mimetic” arts as did the Socrates of Plato.[535]\r\nIn the _Rhetoric_[536] he speaks of the beautiful bodies of youths who\r\ntrained as pentathletes, since the varied exercises of the pentathlon\r\nmade them so. We have a similar opinion expressed by Xenophon in what\r\nis, perhaps, the most interesting passage in Greek literature on\r\ncriticism of art.[537] He has Sokrates go to the sculptor Kleito and\r\ncompliment him on his power of representing different physical types\r\nproduced by various contests, noting differences between statues of\r\nrunners and wrestlers and between those of boxers and pancratiasts.\r\nWhen asked how he makes statues lifelike, Kleito has no answer, and\r\nthe philosopher says it is by the imitation of real men, _i. e._,\r\nnature. He adds: “Must you not then imitate the threatening eyes of\r\nthose who are fighting and the triumphant expression of those who\r\nare victorious?” Though some have thought that these words refer to\r\nportrait statues, which were spoken of as a matter of course at the\r\nbeginning of the fourth century B. C., it is more reasonable to suspect\r\nthat Sokrates was speaking of the older sculptors—for we may recognize\r\nPolykleitos in Kleito[538]—and consequently that he is not referring\r\nto portraiture. In the _Symposium_ of Xenophon[539] Sokrates also\r\ncomplains that the long-distance runners (δολιχοδρόμοι) have thick\r\nlegs and narrow shoulders, while boxers have broad shoulders and small\r\nlegs, and he therefore recommends dancing as a better exercise than\r\nathletics. As such differences in physique occur in vase-paintings of\r\nthe date, but not in statuary, the philosopher seems to be speaking of\r\nathletics and not of sculpture. From these quotations of Aristotle and\r\nXenophon, we gather that the all-round development of the pentathlon\r\nmade beautiful athletes, and this beauty must have been carried over\r\ninto their statues. It is essentially the young man’s contest,[540]\r\nand some of the pentathlete victors at Olympia and elsewhere were\r\nnoted for their strength in after life. Thus Ikkos of Tarentum, who\r\nwon at Olympia in Ol. 76 (= 476 B. C.), was the best teacher of\r\ngymnastics of his day.[541] Gorgos of Elis was the only athlete to win\r\nthe pentathlon four times at Olympia, besides winning in two running\r\nraces.[542] Another Elean, Stomios, who won three prizes at Olympia\r\nand Nemea, later became a leader of cavalry and beat his enemy in\r\nsingle combat.[543] The Argive Eurybates, victor in the pentathlon at\r\nNemea, was very strong, and later, in a battle with the Aeginetans,\r\nkilled three opponents in single combats, but succumbed to the\r\nfourth.[544] The Spartans and Krotonians seem to have been the best\r\npentathletes.[545] Noted sculptors made statues of these athletes.[546]\r\nPlato, in the _de Leg._,[547] has the Athenian stranger praise Egyptian\r\nart because of its stationary character. This bespeaks but little\r\nartistic insight for the philosopher, though he was surrounded by the\r\nwonderful artistic creations of the end of the great fifth century\r\nB. C. The later classical writers were fond of expressing criticisms\r\nof art. Thus Pasiteles, a Greek sculptor living in Rome in the first\r\ncentury B. C., wrote five books on celebrated works of art throughout\r\nthe world.[548] The opinions on art of the Roman Varro appear in the\r\npages of Pliny.[549] Of all the ancient critics, Cicero was perhaps the\r\nmost superficial. In a passage in the _Brutus_[550] he gives us his\r\njudgment of several sculptors. He finds the works of Kanachos too rigid\r\nto imitate nature truthfully, while those of Kalamis, though softer\r\nthan those of Kanachos, are hard; Myron, though not completely faithful\r\nto nature, produced beautiful works and Polykleitos was quite perfect.\r\nThe most trustworthy critic of sculpture in antiquity, on the other\r\nhand, was certainly Lucian, as we see from many of his utterances,\r\nespecially from his account of an ideal statue, which combined the\r\nhighest excellences of several noted sculptures.[551] His criticism\r\nof Hegias, Kritios, and Nesiotes, to the effect that their works were\r\n“concise, sinewy, hard, and exactly strained in their lines,” might\r\nhave been made in the presence of the group of the _Tyrannicides_\r\n(Fig. 32).[552] Unfortunately he touches the subject only casually,\r\nthough he might have written a fine history of Greek art. We must also\r\nrefer to two other imperial writers, the elder Pliny and Pausanias.\r\nPliny’s abstracts on art, though our chief ancient literary authority\r\non Greek sculpture and painting, are neither critical nor trustworthy.\r\nA careful analysis of his chapters shows that he was a borrower many\r\ntimes removed, though he seldom acknowledged it. This is excusable\r\nwhen we consider the custom of literary borrowing in antiquity and\r\nalso the fact that his chapters on art form merely an appendix to\r\nhis _Natural History_, being joined on to it by a very artificial\r\nbond, for his abstract on bronze statuary (Bk. XXXIV) is brought in\r\nmerely to complete his account of the metals. His knowledge of the\r\nolder periods of Greek art is small and his bias in favor of the\r\ntwo Sikyonian sculptors Lysippos and Xenokrates is very evident. His\r\nworst mistakes are in chronology. He puts Pythagoras after Myron, and\r\nboth after Polykleitos, while Hagelaïdas, who is made the teacher of\r\nMyron and Polykleitos, lives on to the beginning of the Peloponnesian\r\nwar. His real criticism of sculpture is seen in his dictum of the\r\n_Laokoön_ group, that it is a “work superior to all the pictures and\r\nbronzes of the world.”[553] Our debt to Pausanias, especially for\r\nour knowledge of the victor monuments at Olympia, is immense. This\r\ndebt may be gauged by the fact that he mentions in his work many\r\ntimes more statues than any other writer and that a large portion of\r\nthe _Schriftquellen_ of Overbeck is concerned with him. However, he\r\nshows little real understanding for art. His interest in statues is\r\nconfined almost entirely to those which are noted for their antiquity\r\nor sanctity, and his account of them is usually the pivot around which\r\nhe spins religious or mythological stories. Throughout his work his\r\nchief interest is religious; his interest in art for its own sake is\r\nvery small. He devotes many pages to the throne of Zeus at Olympia,\r\nand describes the temple sculptures merely because the statue of Zeus\r\nis within. His detailed account of the athlete statues in the Altis is\r\nmade chiefly because of his religious and antiquarian interest. Though\r\nimitating the style of Herodotos, he does it badly, so that his book is\r\nwithout much charm. In concluding this rough estimate of the ancient\r\ncriticism of art, we might mention the fragmentary information to be\r\ngathered from many other writers, Dio Chrysostom, Quintilian,[554]\r\nPlutarch, and others, whose names occur frequently in the footnotes.\r\nAll such references to works of art in ancient writers are conveniently\r\ncollected in the great compilation of Overbeck so often quoted.[555]\r\n\r\nAs for æsthetic judgments of the statues of victors at Olympia we\r\nhave a few direct hints from different writers. The epigram from\r\nthe base of the statue of the boy wrestler Theognetos by Ptolichos\r\nof Aegina reads in part: Κάλλιστον μὲν ἰδεῖν, ἀθλεῖν δ’ οὐ χείρονα\r\nμόρ[φης].[556] Pliny says of the sculptor Mikon, who made the statue\r\nof the Athenian pancratiast Kallias: _Micon athletis spectatur_.[557]\r\nThe same writer says of the horses of Kalamis: _equis sine aemulo\r\nexpressis_.[558] Kalamis with Onatas of Aegina made a chariot-group\r\nfor the Syracusan king Hiero.[559] Pausanias, in mentioning the statue\r\nof the boxer Euthymos by Pythagoras, says that it is καὶ θέας ἐς τὰ\r\nμάλιστα ἄξιος.[560] In mentioning the statue by the same sculptor of\r\nthe wrestler Leontiskos, he says: εἴπερ τις καὶ ἄλλος ἀγαθὸς τὰ ἐς\r\nπλαστικήν.[561] Of the Argive sculptor Naukydes he says, when speaking\r\nof the statue of the wrestler Cheimon, that it is among the finest\r\nworks of that artist.[562] In another passage, in which he describes\r\nthe dedication of Phormis at Olympia, he speaks of an ugly horse,\r\nwhich, besides being smaller than other sculptured horses in the Altis,\r\nhas “its tail cut off, and this makes it still uglier.”[563] However,\r\nhere he is not so much interested in its lack of beauty as in the\r\ncurious fact which he adds, that despite its ugliness this bronze mare\r\nattracted stallions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK ORIGINALS OF VICTOR STATUES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 3\r\n\r\nBronze Head of an Olympic Victor. Glyptothek, Munich.]\r\n\r\nWe are not, however, dependent upon such meagre scraps of evidence from\r\nclassical writers, nor upon contested Roman copies,[564] for an idea\r\nof the workmanship of some of the Olympic victor statues. We can judge\r\nit in no uncertain way by the few originals found at Olympia and by\r\nothers which are to be found in European museums. As an example of the\r\nformer we have only to recall the life-size bronze bearded head of a\r\nboxer or pancratiast of the third century B. C., which is now in the\r\nNational Museum at Athens[565] (Fig. 61, A and B). Its only decoration,\r\nan olive crown whose leaves have disappeared, proves it to be from the\r\nstatue of a victor, and its wild locks, brutal look, flattened nose,\r\nand wide mouth represent a naturalistic study of the utmost strength\r\nand fineness, which could only have been produced after the time of\r\nLysippos. We shall discuss this remarkable head more fully in Chapter\r\nIV. As examples of original victor monuments in European museums\r\nwe shall mention three. The bronze head of a boxer in the Glyptothek\r\nat Munich (Pl. 3) is an original of the first rank.[566] It is from a\r\nstatue found near Naples in 1730, which was later destroyed, and it\r\nprobably represents the head of a boy of about twelve years, a victor\r\nin boxing, to judge from the victor band in the hair and the fact\r\nthat the visible part of the right ear is swollen. Like the head of\r\nthe _Diadoumenos_ of Polykleitos (Figs. 28, 29) this beautiful head\r\nexemplifies fully the “ethical grace” or modesty[567] so characteristic\r\nof the best Greek art, and it certainly merits Furtwaengler’s praise\r\nof being the “most precious treasure of the Glyptothek.”[568] Another\r\nhead, found in Beneventum and now in the Louvre (Fig. 3)[569] is a\r\nsplendid Greek original of the last decade of the fifth century B. C.,\r\nand, as Mrs. Strong says, should arouse in us a sense of what precious\r\nrelics may still lie hidden in our museums.[570] The victor fillet\r\nin the hair, consisting of two sprays of what seems to be wild olive\r\n(remnants of which appear in front), shows that the statue must once\r\nhave ornamented the Altis. Like the one in Munich, this head shows\r\nPolykleitan inspiration tempered by Attic influence.[571] Lastly, the\r\nbronze head of a youth from the _tablinum_, of the so-called villa of\r\nthe Pisos at Herculaneum, now in Naples,[572] is, to judge from its\r\ntechnique, an excellent original Greek work (Fig. 4). Here again the\r\nhair fillet shows it is from a victor statue, though its provenience\r\nfrom Olympia can not be established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Bronze Head of an Olympic Victor, from\r\nBeneventum. Louvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nSuch beautiful works of art as these last show the influence which the\r\ngreat athletic festivals, and especially the Olympian, exerted on the\r\ndevelopment of Greek sculpture. In the gymnastic training carried on in\r\nthe gymnasium and palæstra, which culminated in these festivals, the\r\nGreek sculptor found an unrivaled opportunity to study the naked human\r\nfigure in its best muscular development and in every pose. In fact, we\r\nmay say with Furtwaengler that without athletics Greek art would be\r\ninconceivable.[573] To quote from another work of the same scholar:\r\n\r\n  “The gymnastically trained bodies of these slim boys and\r\n  youths and vigorous men are evidence of the ennobling\r\n  effect of athletics. Presented in complete nudity they\r\n  are not faithful portraits from life, but motives or\r\n  models from the palæstra transformed and exalted to the\r\n  highest ideal of physical beauty and strength. They are\r\n  the most splendid human beings that the art of any period\r\n  has created.”[574]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANONS OF PROPORTION.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to identify a given statue as the copy of a work by this\r\nor that master, certain well-known canons of proportion, which were\r\ntaught and practiced by various Greek sculptors and schools, must be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Bronze Head of an Olympic Victor, from\r\nHerculaneum. Museum of Naples.]\r\n\r\nGreek art may, like Greek philosophy and poetry, be summarized under\r\nthe names of three qualities which constantly occur in classical\r\nliterature—συμμετρία, εὐρυθμία or ῥυθμός, and ἀναλογία.[575] Symmetry\r\nmay be defined as “that technical regard for the placing of the parts\r\nto the best advantage,” the symmetrical arrangement of the parts of a\r\nstatue or group of figures.[576] Rhythm, following Vitruvius,[577] is\r\nthat _tertium quid_ which is indispensable to true art. Analogy (Latin\r\n_proportio_)[578] refers to the measured ratio of part to part in any\r\ngiven work of art, whether in architecture, painting, or sculpture.\r\nMost scholars nowadays interpret symmetry and analogy as the same\r\nthing. Pliny[579] says that _symmetria_ has no Latin equivalent, and\r\nin several passages[580] keeps the Greek word, as does Vitruvius. Here\r\nOtto Jahn rightly says _proportio_ or _commensus_ would have adequately\r\ntranslated it.[581] P. Gardner explains the word properly as “the\r\nproportion of one part of the body as measured against another.”[582]\r\nBrunn held that, as symmetry was the relation of part to part in a\r\nstatue at rest, rhythm expressed this relationship in one represented\r\nin motion.[583] The simplest illustration of rhythm is seen in walking:\r\nwhen the right foot is advanced the left arm swings out in rhythm,\r\nand so the balance of the body is kept. Rhythm, therefore, has to do\r\nwith balance in motion, and may refer equally to cadence in poetry and\r\nmusic and to movement in sculpture. An excellent example in sculpture\r\nis afforded by Myron’s _Diskobolos_ (Pls. 21, 22, and Figs. 34, 35),\r\nwhile the balancing of figures on many Greek reliefs—especially on\r\nAttic funerary stelæ—illustrates symmetry (_cf._ Fig. 75). Pliny\r\ncharacterizes certain artists by their success in effecting symmetry\r\nand rhythm. Thus Myron surpassed Polykleitos in being more rhythmic\r\nand in paying more attention to symmetry.[584] He says that Lysippos\r\nmost diligently preserved symmetry by bringing unthought-of innovations\r\ninto the square canon of earlier artists.[585] Parrhasios was the\r\nfirst to introduce symmetry into painting.[586] Diogenes Laertios says\r\nthat the sculptor Pythagoras was the first to aim at rhythm as well\r\nas symmetry.[587] In all such passages it is clear that canons of\r\nproportion are meant.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of human proportions is very ancient, originating in\r\nEgyptian art.[588] It appears early in Greek architecture in the\r\nproportions of columns and other members of a temple,[589] and it\r\nwas soon transferred to sculpture. As Greek sculpture evolved on\r\ntraditional lines,[590] we should assume that it paid attention to the\r\ndoctrine of proportions in the human figure, based on numerical ratios,\r\nand that such a doctrine would vary from age to age in the various\r\nschools of sculpture. Such an assumption is borne out by both literary\r\nand archæological evidence. Toward the end of Hellenism many writers\r\nrefer to just such a measured basis of proportion in Greek art.[591]\r\nArchæologists have shown by the careful study of multitudes of statues\r\nthat such proportions exist in Greek sculpture. Thus A. Kalkmann[592]\r\nhas proved that there are sets of ratios in the treatment of the face\r\nused by successive schools of sculpture, which were canonical, whether\r\nformulated or not. G. Fritsch[593] has done for the whole body what\r\nKalkman has done for the face. In fact, anthropometry in relation to\r\nGreek sculpture has now become an exact science.[594]\r\n\r\nThe greatest artists—architects, painters, and sculptors—of all times\r\nhave taught and practised the doctrine that certain proportions are\r\nbeautiful, _e. g._, the proportion of the height of the head or the\r\nlength of the foot to the whole body, or the length of parts of\r\nthe head or body to other parts. In modern times we have only to\r\nmention such names as those of da Vinci, Duerer, Raphael Mengs, and\r\nFlaxman.[595] In Greek days there were many artists who formulated\r\nsuch canons of proportions. Greek sculptors followed ratios of\r\nproportions so closely that we have statues of various schools, which\r\nare distinguished by fixed proportions of parts, such as the Old Attic,\r\nOld Argive, Polykleitan, Argive-Sikyonian or Lysippan, etc. Some of\r\nthese schools used the foot as the common measure, while others used\r\nthe palm, finger, or other member.[596] The earliest works on Greek\r\nart were treatises, now lost, by artists in which they worked out\r\ntheir theories of the principles underlying the proportions of the\r\nhuman figure.[597] We shall briefly consider a few of these canons,\r\ntogether with the usual pose of body which conformed with them. The\r\nearliest Peloponnesian canon, which we can analyze, was that followed\r\nby Hagelaïdas of Argos and his school, a canon which was still used in\r\nthe Polykleitan circle. Here the weight of the body rested upon the\r\nleft leg, while the right one was slightly bent at the knee, its foot\r\nresting flat on the ground; the right arm hung by the side and the left\r\nwas usually in action, and the head was slightly inclined to the left\r\nside; the shoulders were extraordinarily broad in comparison with the\r\nhips, the right one being slightly raised. These qualities produced a\r\nshort stocky figure, firmly placed.[598] In the middle of the fifth\r\ncentury B. C., Polykleitos worked out a theory of proportions in the\r\nform of a commentary on his famous statue known as the _Doryphoros_.\r\nThis canon was characterized by squareness and massiveness of build.\r\nThe weight of the body generally rested on the right foot, while\r\nthe left was drawn back, its foot touching the ground with the ball\r\nonly. Sometimes this pose was reversed, the left foot carrying the\r\nbody-weight, as in the three bases of statues by the master found\r\nat Olympia (_i. e._, those of the athletes Pythokles, Aristion,\r\nand Kyniskos, to be discussed later), and in the works of some of\r\nhis pupils, notably in those of Naukydes, Daidalos, and Kleon.[599]\r\nEuphranor, who flourished, according to Pliny, in Ol. 104 (= 364-361 B.\r\nC.), and wrote works on symmetry and color, was the “first” to master\r\nthe theory of symmetry.[600] Pliny, however, found his bodies too\r\nslender and his heads and limbs too large, a criticism of his painting\r\nwhich must have been equally applicable to his sculpture. His canon\r\ndid not make much headway, as the majority of sculptors in his century\r\nwere still under the domination of the canon of Polykleitos. It was\r\nleft for Lysippos, in the second half of the fourth century B. C.,\r\nfinally to break this domination of the great fifth-century sculptor.\r\nPliny quotes Douris as saying that he was the pupil of no man, and\r\nthat because of the advice of the painter Eupompos he was a follower\r\nof nature—which appears to be a cut at the schools which mechanically\r\nfollowed fixed rules.[601] His statues had smaller heads, and more\r\nslender and less fleshy limbs, than those of his predecessors, in order\r\nthat the apparent height of the figure might be increased.[602] While\r\nPolykleitos made his heads one-seventh of the total height of the\r\nstatue, Lysippos made his one-eighth—if this change may be seen in the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_ (Pl. 28), which is certainly a work of his school, if not\r\nof the master himself. Pliny further records his saying that while his\r\npredecessors represented men as they were, Lysippos represented them as\r\nthey appeared to be. This means that Pliny regarded him as the first\r\nimpressionistic artist.[603] Pliny mentions other artists who wrote on\r\nart, and it is probable that theories of proportions formed the main\r\nelement of such works.[604]\r\n\r\nThe best example of symmetry, _i. e._, of the ratio of proportions, in\r\nGreek sculpture is afforded by the _Doryphoros_ of Polykleitos, which\r\nPliny says was called the _Canon_, and he adds that this sculptor was\r\nthe only one who embodied his art in a single work.[605] The identity\r\nof the canon with this statue seems to be attested by the anecdote\r\ntold of Lysippos that the _Doryphoros_ was his master,[606] and by\r\nQuintilian’s statement that sculptors took it as a model.[607] The\r\nbest-preserved copy of the _Doryphoros_, despite its rather lifeless\r\ncharacter, is the one discovered in Pompeii and now in Naples (Pl.\r\n4).[608] As other late Roman copies do not conform to the identical\r\nproportions of this copy, it is perhaps difficult to say exactly what\r\nthe canon of Polykleitos was. Possibly the original, if it had been\r\npreserved, would also strike us as somewhat lifeless; but we must\r\nremember that the statue was made merely to illustrate a theory of\r\nproportions. The dimensions of the Naples statue are known from very\r\ncareful measurements and the proportions agree with those given in the\r\ndescription by Galen to be mentioned. It is almost exactly 2 meters,\r\nor 6 feet 8 inches, high.[609] The length of the foot is 0.33 meter,\r\nor one-sixth of the total height, while the length of the face is 0.20\r\nmeter, or one-tenth of the height. E. Guillaume[610] has made a careful\r\nanalysis of it in reference to Galen’s[611] statement that Chrysippos\r\nfound beauty in the proportion of the parts, “of finger to finger,\r\nand of all the fingers to the palm and wrist, and of these to the\r\nforearm, and of the forearm to the upper arm, and of all the parts to\r\neach other, as they are set forth in the canon of Polykleitos.” He has\r\nfound that the palm, _i. e._, the breadth of the hand at the base of\r\nthe fingers, is a common measure of the proportions of the body. This\r\npalm is one-third the length of the foot, one-sixth that of the lower\r\nleg, one-sixth that of the thigh, and one-sixth that of the distance\r\nfrom the navel to the ear, etc. Such a remarkable correspondence in\r\nmeasurements would seem to show, if we had no other proofs, that the\r\nNaples statue reproduces the canon of Polykleitos more closely than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 4\r\n\r\nStatue of the _Doryphoros_, after Polykleitos. Museum of Naples.]\r\n\r\nA good example of asymmetry is afforded by the so-called _Spinario_\r\nof the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome[612] (Fig. 40). This justly\r\nprized statue shows more asymmetry, perhaps, than any other down to\r\nits date—just before the middle of the fifth century B. C. Though its\r\ncomposition is such that there is no vantage-point from which it forms\r\na harmonious whole, still its effect on the beholder is far from\r\ndispleasing. Such a creation shows that a Greek artist, even without\r\npaying attention to the symmetrical arrangement of parts, could at\r\ntimes produce an attractive piece of sculpture.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSIMILATION OF OLYMPIC VICTOR STATUES TO TYPES OF GODS AND HEROES.\r\n\r\nSince Greek art in the main was idealistic, we should not be surprised\r\nto discover in athletic sculpture a tendency toward assimilating\r\nvictor statues to well-known types of gods or heroes, especially to\r\nthose of Hermes, Apollo, and Herakles, who presided over contests or\r\ngymnasia and palæstræ. This phenomenon is only a further example of the\r\nextraordinary, almost superhuman, honors which were paid to victors at\r\nthe great games. In the absence of sufficient means of identification,\r\nit is often very difficult to distinguish with certainty between\r\nstatues of victors and those of the gods and heroes to whom they were\r\nassimilated. This difficulty, as we shall see, is especially observable\r\nin the case of Herakles. Even later antiquity recognized that statues\r\nof athletes were sometimes confused with those of heroes, just as those\r\nof heroes were with those of gods, as we learn from a passage in Dio\r\nChrysostom’s oration on Rhodian affairs.[613] This difficulty is one\r\nof the most perplexing problems that still face the student of Greek\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nIt was not an uncommon custom in Greece to heroize in this way an\r\nordinary dead man.[614] One of the most striking instances of this\r\ncustom is afforded by the so-called _Hermes of Andros_, a statue found\r\nin a grave-chamber on the island in 1833 and now in Athens[615] (Pl.\r\n5). It has been a matter of dispute among archæologists whether this\r\nstatue represents the god Hermes or a mortal in his guise. Although\r\nStaïs[616] looks on it as _un problème peut-être à jamais insoluble_,\r\nthere seems little reason for doubting that it represents a defunct\r\nmortal. Its place of finding in a tomb along with the statue of a woman\r\nof the Muse type, which probably represents the man’s consort,[617]\r\nthe presence of a snake on the adjacent tree trunk, the absence of\r\nsandals and kerykeion, and the portrait—like features—all point to\r\nthe conclusion that a man and not a god is represented. The downcast,\r\nalmost melancholy, look seems also to make it a funereal figure. The\r\npowerful proportions of a perfectly developed athlete, displaying no\r\ntendency toward the representation of brute force, show that the man\r\nis idealized into the type of Hermes, the god of the palæstra, rather\r\nthan into the light-winged messenger of Olympos. The _Belvedere Hermes_\r\nof the Vatican,[618] and a better one known as the _Farnese Hermes_\r\nof the British Museum,[619] are noteworthy replicas of the type. The\r\nlatter carries the kerykeion in the left hand and wears sandals, with\r\na small chlamys over the left arm and shoulder. These attributes show\r\nthat Hermes was intended in this copy. Probably the original of these\r\nvarious replicas, a work dating from the end of the fourth century\r\nB. C., and ascribed to Praxiteles or his school in consequence of\r\nsimilarity in pose and build of body and head to the _Hermes_ of\r\nOlympia, was intended to represent Hermes. In the one from Andros,\r\nat least, the copyist intended to heroize a mortal under the type of\r\nthe god. Similarly, the statue known as the _Standing Hermes_ in the\r\nGalleria delle Statue of the Vatican,[620] which has the kerykeion and\r\nchlamys, whether its original represented Hermes, hero or mortal, has\r\nbeen made by the copyist to represent Hermes, the god of athletics, as\r\nthe late attribute of wings in the hair proves. Other examples of dead\r\nmen represented as Hermes are not uncommon. Thus a Greek grave-stele in\r\nVerona[621] shows the dead portrayed as a winged Hermes, and a similar\r\nfigure appears on a stele from Tanagra.[622] The so-called _Commodus_\r\nin Mantua[623] is interpreted by Conze and Duetschke as the figure of\r\na dead youth in Hermes’ guise. But this custom of representing defunct\r\nmortals as gods was less common in Roman art. The bust of a dead youth\r\non a Roman grave-stone in Turin,[624] set up in honor of L. Mussius,\r\nis a good example. Here the cock, sheep, and kerykeion, symbols of the\r\ngod, show that the youth is represented as Hermes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 5\r\n\r\nStatue of _Hermes_, from Andros. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Bronze Portrait-statue of a Hellenistic Prince.\r\nMuseo delle Terme, Rome.]\r\n\r\nNot only dead men, however, were heroized in this manner. It was not an\r\nuncommon practice in later Greece for living men, especially princes,\r\nto have their statues assimilated to types of gods and heroes, a\r\npractice which was very common in imperial Rome.[625] Thus many of the\r\nHellenistic princes were pleased to have their statues assimilated\r\nto those of the heroic Alexander. One of the best examples of this\r\nprocess is furnished by the original bronze portrait statue of such a\r\nprince, which was unearthed in Rome in 1884 and is now in the Museo\r\ndelle Terme there (Fig. 5).[626] It has been identified as the portrait\r\nof several kings of Macedon and elsewhere,[627] but the similarity\r\nof the head of the statue to heads portrayed on Macedonian coins is\r\nonly superficial.[628] All that we can say is that this beautiful\r\nwork, representing the prince in the heroic guise of a nude athlete\r\nof about thirty years, belongs to the third century B. C., the epoch\r\nfollowing Lysippos. The sculptor, wishing to combine the ideal with the\r\nreal, appears to have copied the motive directly from a bronze statue\r\nby Lysippos, which represented Alexander leaning with his left hand\r\nhigh on a staff.[629] The pose also recalls that of the third-century\r\nB. C. statue of Poseidon found on Melos and now in Athens.[630]\r\nThe free leg, body, and head modeling correspond so nearly with the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_ (Pl. 28) that it was at first called a work of Lysippos,\r\nbut its lack of repose[631] shows that it must be a continuation of the\r\nwork of that sculptor by some pupil, who wished to outdo his master in\r\nboth form and expression.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the subject of the assimilation of victor statues\r\nto types of god and hero, we must make it clear that often, for\r\ncertain reasons, statues of athletes were later converted into those\r\nof gods, and _vice versa_. Such examples of metamorphosing statues\r\nhave nothing to do with the process of assimilation under discussion.\r\nA few examples will make this clear. An archaic bronze statuette from\r\nNaxos,[632] reproducing the type of the _Philesian Apollo_ of Kanachos,\r\nsince it has the same position of hands as in the original, as we see\r\nit later reproduced on coins of Miletos and in other copies,[633]\r\nholds an aryballos in the right hand instead of a fawn. As it is\r\nabsurd to represent Apollo with the bow in one hand and an oil-flask\r\nin the other, it seems clear that in this statuette the copyist has\r\nconverted a well-known Apollo into an athlete by addition of an\r\nathletic attribute. Famous statues were put to many different uses by\r\nlater copyists. Thus Furtwaengler has shown that the statue of the boy\r\nboxer Kyniskos by Polykleitos at Olympia,[634] which represented the\r\nathlete crowning himself, was modified to represent various deities,\r\nheroes, etc. Thus a copy from Eleusis of the fourth century B. C.,\r\nbecause of its provenience and the soft lines of the face, suggests\r\na divinity, perhaps Triptolemos.[635] A copy of the same type in\r\nthe Villa Albani (no. 222) has an antique piece of a boar’s head on\r\nthe nearby tree-stump and, consequently, may represent Adonis or\r\nMeleager. A torso in the Museo Torlonia (no. 22) represents Dionysos,\r\nanother in the Museo delle Terme has a mantle and caduceus and so\r\nrepresents Hermes, while on coins of Commodus the same figure, with\r\nthe lion’s skin and club, represents Herakles.[636] No ancient statue\r\nwas used more extensively as a model for other types than the famous\r\n_Doryphoros_ of Polykleitos. Furtwaengler[637] has collected a long\r\nlist of later conversions of this work into statues both marble and\r\nbronze, statuettes, reliefs, etc., representing Pan, Ares, Hermes, and\r\nin one case an ordinary mortal.[638] Other examples of the conversion\r\nof statues will be given in our treatment of assimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHLETE STATUES ASSIMILATED TO TYPES OF HERMES.\r\n\r\nHermes was one of the principal ἐναγώνιοι or ἀγώνιοι θεοί, _i. e._,\r\ngods who presided over contests, or who were overseers of gymnasia\r\nand palæstræ, or were teachers of gymnastics (γυμνάσται).[639] Greek\r\nwriters often mention these athletic gods. Thus Aischylos[640] often\r\nuses the term, not in the sense of ἀγοραῖοι θεοί, “the great assembled\r\ngods,” (ἀγὼν = ἀγορά),[641] but in the sense of gods who presided\r\nover contests.[642] This is evident from the fact that Zeus, Apollo,\r\nPoseidon, and Hermes are the gods especially mentioned by Aischylos\r\nin this sense, and the first three correspond with the Olympian and\r\nNemean games (Zeus), the Pythian (Apollo), and the Isthmian (Poseidon),\r\nwhile Hermes is concerned in them all. Thus the epithet ἀγώνιοι, in\r\nthe _Agamemnon_ of Aischylos refers to Zeus,[643] Apollo,[644] and\r\nHermes.[645] If the word referred to the twelve greater gods, as some\r\nhave thought, other deities more important than Hermes would have been\r\nincluded. Elsewhere the word ἀγώνιος always refers to contests.[646]\r\nHermes was worshipped at Athens and elsewhere as a god of\r\ncontests.[647] The agonistic character of this god is shown by the fact\r\nthat statues and altars were erected to him all over Greece.[648] He\r\nwas sometimes coupled with Herakles as the protector of contests,[649]\r\nand the images of the two often stood in gymnasia.[650] A fragmentary\r\nvotive relief of the second century A. D. is inscribed with a\r\ndedication to both by a certain Horarios, victor in torch-racing.[651]\r\nAthenian ephebes made offerings to Hermes,[652] and to Hermes and\r\nHerakles in common, after their training was over. Thus Dorykleides\r\nof Thera, a victor in boxing and the pankration at unknown games,\r\ndedicated a thank-offering to the two.[653] Hermes was early the god\r\nof youthful life and sports, especially those of the palæstra. He is\r\nsaid to have founded wrestling[654] and inaugurated the sports of the\r\npalæstra.[655] Pausanias mentions a Gymnasion of Hermes at Athens[656]\r\nand an altar of Hermes ἐναγώνιος together with one of _Opportunity_\r\n(Καιρός) at the entrance to the Stadion at Olympia.[657] He says that\r\nthe people of Pheneus in Arkadia held games in his honor called the\r\n_Hermaia_,[658] and he records the defeat of the god by Apollo in\r\nrunning.[659] With such an athletic record there is little wonder that\r\nthe Greek sculptor would often take his ideal of Hermes from the god\r\nof the palæstra and gymnasium, representing him as an athletic youth\r\nharmoniously developed by gymnastic exercises. It was but natural that\r\na victor at Olympia or elsewhere should wish to have his statue—which\r\nrarely could be a portrait—conform with that athletic type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 6\r\n\r\nStatue of the _Standing Diskobolos_, after Naukydes (?). Vatican\r\nMuseum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent instance of this tendency seems to be afforded by the\r\nso-called _Standing Diskobolos_ in the Sala della Biga of the Vatican\r\n(Pl. 6),[660] known since its discovery by Gavin Hamilton in 1792.\r\nIt represents a youth who is apparently taking position for throwing\r\nthe diskos, the weight of the body resting on the left leg, the knees\r\nslightly bent, the feet firmly planted, and the diskos held in the left\r\nhand, just prior to its being passed to the right. This position is one\r\nwhich immediately precedes that of Myron’s great statue. The bronze\r\noriginal dates from the second half of the fifth century B. C., and\r\nhas been variously assigned to Myron by Brunn, to Alkamenes by Kekulé,\r\nfollowed by Overbeck, Michaelis and Furtwaengler,[661] and to Naukydes,\r\nthe brother and pupil of Polykleitos.[662] The head of the Vatican\r\nstatue shows no trace of Peloponnesian art, but rather resembles Attic\r\ntypes of the end of the fifth century B. C. However, as we shall\r\nsee, this head does not appear to belong to the statue. Among the works\r\nof Alkamenes Pliny mentions a bronze pentathlete,[663] called the\r\n_Enkrinomenos_, and this work has been identified with the statue under\r\ndiscussion.[664] Such an assumption is tenable only if the statue fits\r\nPliny’s epithet. This epithet appears to mean “undergoing a test,” and\r\nshould refer not to the statue, for we know nothing of any principle\r\nof selecting statues, but to the athlete represented, the ἔγκρισις\r\nreferring to the selection of athletes before the contest.[665] Pliny’s\r\nstatue, then, presumably, represented a pentathlete, not in action\r\nas the Vatican statue does, but standing at rest before his judges.\r\nAn all-round athlete like a pentathlete would especially fit such an\r\nordeal, and his statue, albeit lighter and more graceful, would be\r\nan ideal one like the _Doryphoros_ of Polykleitos.[666] We know how\r\nAlkamenes treated Hermes from the bearded herma of that god found\r\nin Pergamon in 1903 and inscribed with his name.[667] Its massive\r\nfeatures, broad forehead, and wide-opened eyes bear no analogy to the\r\nhead on the Vatican statue, nor to the one with which Helbig would\r\nreplace it. The ascription of the statue to Naukydes is better founded.\r\nAs the head of the statue is Attic and not Argive, it is difficult to\r\nconnect the work with a Peloponnesian artist. However, the present head\r\nof the statue can not be shown to belong to it, and no other replica\r\nhas a head which can be proved to belong to the body. A fragmentary\r\nreplica of the statue, of good workmanship, was found in Rome in 1910,\r\nand nearby a head, which must belong to the torso.[668] This head\r\nfits the Vatican statue better than the head now on it, and certainly\r\ncomes from the Polykleitan circle—both head and body showing elements\r\nof Polykleitan style. This new head represents the transition from\r\nPolykleitan art to that of the next century, _i. e._, to the head-types\r\nof Skopas, Praxiteles, and other Attic masters. Presumably, then,\r\nin the original of this fragment and its replicas, we have a famous\r\nstatue—the one by Naukydes mentioned by Pliny.[669]\r\n\r\nA more important question for our discussion is whether the Vatican\r\nstatue represents a victor (diskobolos) or Hermes. G. Habich has argued\r\nthat the pose of the statue, standing with the right foot advanced,\r\nis not that of a diskobolos taking position. He quotes Kietz[670]\r\nto the effect that no vase-painting or other monument has the exact\r\nposition of this statue, and that the natural position for such a\r\nmotive is to advance the left foot.[671] Moreover, the fingers of the\r\nright hand, which are supposed especially to uphold the diskobolos\r\ntheory, are modern in all the replicas. On a coin of Amastris in\r\nPaphlagonia, dating from the Antonines, and on one of Commodus struck\r\nat Philippopolis in Thrace, a figure of Hermes is pictured, which, in\r\nall essentials, reproduces the Vatican statue.[672] Since the figure\r\non the coins has a kerykeion or training-rod in the right hand and\r\na diskos as a minor attribute in the left—merely a symbol of the\r\ngod’s patronage of athletics—we should see in the Vatican statue a\r\nrepresentation of Hermes as overseer of the palæstra. Pliny’s words—if\r\nwe omit or transpose the first _et_—refer, therefore, to a statue\r\nof _Hermes-Diskobolos_ and to the _Ram-offerer_ which stood on the\r\nAthenian Akropolis, to two, therefore, and not to three different\r\nmonuments. We should restore all the replicas of the statue, then,\r\nwith the caduceus, to represent Hermes as gymnasiarch. Though this\r\ninterpretation of the statue has found opponents,[673] the evidence is\r\nstrong that in it and its replicas we have an athlete in the guise of\r\nHermes. If we think that the caduceus can not be brought into harmony\r\nwith the chief motive of the statue, we must conclude with Helbig that\r\nthe copyist in one isolated case—the one copied on the coins—changed\r\nan original victor statue into Hermes by adding the herald staff.\r\nThis would make it an instance, not of assimilation of type, but of\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\nA small bronze statuette standing upon a cylindrical base, which was\r\nfound in the sea off Antikythera (Cerigotto), reproduces almost\r\nexactly the attitude of the statue of Naukydes (Fig. 6).[674] Here the\r\nleft hand is stretched out horizontally at the elbow, but the right\r\narm is lost, so that we get no additional evidence as to the attribute\r\ncarried. Because of its correspondence with the aforementioned\r\ncoins[675] even in detail, Bosanquet, followed by Svoronos, looks upon\r\nthis “little masterpiece” as a copy of the Argive master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Bronze Statuette of _Hermes-Diskobolos_, found\r\nin the Sea off Antikythera. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nThe statue discovered in the ruins of Hadrian’s villa in 1742 and now\r\nin the Capitoline Museum,[676] which represents an ephebe nude, except\r\nfor a chlamys thrown around the middle of his body, standing in an easy\r\nattitude with his left foot resting upon a rock and bending forward\r\nwith the right arm extended in a gesture, was formerly looked upon as\r\na resting pancratiast. Because of its general likeness to Praxitelean\r\nfigures—the head is especially like the Olympia _Hermes_—Furtwaengler\r\ninterpreted the figure as that of Hermes Logios or Agoraios, the god of\r\neloquence, and assigned it to an artist near to Praxiteles. However,\r\nit is probably nothing else than an idealized portrait of the age of\r\nHadrian or the Antonines, and represents an ephebe, probably a victor,\r\nassimilated to the type of Hermes.[677]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Bronze Statue of a Youth, found in the Sea off\r\nAntikythera. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nAnother example of assimilation may be the much-discussed bronze statue\r\nin the National Museum at Athens, which was accidentally discovered\r\nin 1901, along with the rest of a cargo of sculptures which had been\r\nwrecked off the island of Antikythera as it was on its way to Rome\r\nabout the beginning of the first century B. C. (Fig. 7).[678] This\r\nstatue, the best preserved of the cargo, is a little over lifesize\r\nand represents a nude youth standing with languid grace, the weight\r\nof his body resting upon the left leg, while the right is slightly\r\nbent and the right arm is extended horizontally, the hand holding\r\na round object now lost and variously interpreted. In short, the\r\npose strongly resembles that of the Vatican _Apoxyomenos_ (Pl. 29).\r\nOpinions as to the age and authorship of this statue have been very\r\ndiverse, ranging from the fifth century B. C. down to Hellenistic\r\ntimes and ascribing it to many masters and schools. Kabbadias, who\r\npublished it, in conjunction with the other objects, directly after\r\ntheir discovery,[679] thought it would prove to “rank as high among\r\nstatues of bronze as does the _Hermes_ of Praxiteles among those of\r\nmarble,” and characterized it as “the most beautiful bronze statue\r\nthat we possess.” Waldstein praised it in no less exaggerated terms,\r\nand classed it along with the _Charioteer_ from Delphi (Fig. 66) as\r\namong the first Greek bronzes, if not among the finest specimens of\r\nGreek sculpture.[680] He followed Kabbadias in assigning it to the\r\nfourth century B. C. and in interpreting it as Hermes. He at first\r\nascribed it to Praxiteles or his school, but later he thought it more\r\nSkopaic.[681] Th. Reinach placed it in the early fourth century B. C.,\r\nbut regarded it as the work of a sculptor influenced by Polykleitos,\r\nnaming the youthful Praxiteles or Euphranor.[682] He explained the\r\npose as that of a man amusing a dog or a child with some round object.\r\nA Greek scholar, A. S. Arvanitopoulos, assigned the work to the fifth\r\ncentury B. C. and to the Attic school, referring it possibly to\r\nAlkamenes.[683] However, as soon as the statue was properly cleansed\r\nand pieced together, its early dating was seen to be untenable, and its\r\nHellenistic character became evident.[684] E. A. Gardner found little\r\nresemblance in the head to that of the Praxitelean _Hermes_, but more\r\nin the treatment of hair and eyes to that of the _Lansdowne Herakles_\r\n(Pl. 30, Fig. 71,), which he ascribes to Skopas.[685] He saw in its\r\nlabored and even anatomical modeling similarity to the _Apoxyomenos_\r\nof the Vatican and concluded that it was, therefore, later than the\r\nfourth century B. C., being an eclectic piece disclosing influences of\r\nseveral fourth-century sculptors, the work of an imitator especially\r\nof Praxiteles and Skopas. K. T. Frost also assigned the work to the\r\nHellenistic age, but believed it was the statue of a god and not of\r\na mortal, and so followed Kabbadias and Waldstein in interpreting it\r\nas a Hermes Logios.[686] Gardner had interpreted it as probably the\r\nstatue of an athlete “in a somewhat theatrical pose,” though admitting\r\nit might be a _genre_ figure representing an athlete catching a ball,\r\neven if its pose were against such an interpretation. In any case he\r\nwas right in saying that the pose, even if incapable of solution, was\r\nchosen by the sculptor with a desire for display, as the centre of\r\nattraction is outside and not inside the statue, and so is against the\r\nαὐτάρκεια of earlier works. More recently, Bulle has asserted that it\r\nis not an original work at all, but, as evinced by the hard treatment\r\nof the hair, merely a copy. He also interprets it as a _Hermes_,\r\nrestoring a kerykeion in the left hand, and he likens its oratorical\r\npose to that of the _Etruscan Orator_ found near Lago di Trasimeno in\r\n1566 and now in the Museo Archeologico in Florence, or the _Augustus_\r\nfrom Primaporta in the Vatican.[687] For its date he believes the\r\nstatue marks the end of the Polykleitan “_Standmotif_” (the breadth\r\nof the body showing Polykleitan influence, the head, however, being\r\ntoo small and slender for the Argive master), and the inception of the\r\nLysippan (the free leg not drawn back, but placed further out), as we\r\nsee it in the _Apoxyomenos_. He concludes that its author can not have\r\nbeen a great master.[688] Doubtless, the statue, which is the pride of\r\nthe Athenian museum, is merely a representative example of the kind of\r\nbronze statues made in great numbers in the early Hellenistic age; but\r\nit shows the high degree of excellence attained at that time by very\r\nmediocre artists.[689]\r\n\r\nApart from its period, our chief interest in the statue is to determine\r\nwhether a god or a mortal is portrayed. As there are no certain\r\nremnants of the round object held in the right hand, and no other\r\naccessories, many interpretations have been possible. Especially the\r\ngesture of the right arm has been the centre for such interpretations.\r\nSome have looked upon this gesture as “transitory,” _i. e._, the\r\nsweeping gesture of an orator or god of orators, and this has led to\r\nthe interpretation of the statue as Hermes Logios.[690] However, the\r\nround object in the fingers is against this assumption. Others have\r\ntherefore regarded the gesture as “stationary,” _i. e._, the figure\r\nis holding an object in the hand, which is the main interest of the\r\nstatue, and this view has therefore also given rise to many different\r\nexplanations. Among mythological interpretations two have received\r\ncareful attention. Svoronos has reasoned most ingeniously that the\r\nstatue represents Perseus holding the head of Medusa in his hand,\r\nand finds a similar type on coins, gems, and rings. Thus, almost\r\nthe identical pose of the statue is seen on an engraved stone in\r\nFlorence, which shows Perseus holding the Gorgon’s head, and Svoronos\r\nhas restored the bronze similarly.[691] But certainly the right arm\r\nof the statue was not intended to carry so great a weight. Others\r\nhave seen in it the statue of Paris by Euphranor, mentioned by Pliny\r\nas offering the apple as prize of beauty to Aphrodite.[692] But the\r\nstatue scarcely reflects the description of the _Paris_ by Pliny.\r\nOther scholars have interpreted the statue as that of a mortal. S.\r\nReinach believes that it may be a youth sacrificing.[693] Kabbadias\r\nand E. A. Gardner admitted it might be the statue of a ball-player\r\nas well as of Hermes. Since this latter interpretation has become\r\npopular, let us consider its possibility at some length in reference to\r\nball-playing in antiquity. Now we know that ball-playing (σφαιρίζειν,\r\nἡ σφαιρικὴ τέχνη) was a favorite amusement of the Greeks from the\r\ntime of Nausikaa and her brothers in the Odyssey[694] to the end of\r\nGreek history, and that it was practiced at Rome from the end of the\r\nRepublic to the end of the Empire.[695] It seems to have been regarded\r\nless as a game than as a gymnastic exercise. Its origin is ascribed\r\nto the Spartans and to others.[696] A special sort of ball-playing was\r\nknown as φαινίνδα,[697] and this is described in a treatise by the\r\nphysician Galen, of the second century A. D., in which he recommended\r\nball-playing as one of the best exercises.[698] Because of his ability\r\nin the art of ball-playing, Aristonikos of Karystos, the ball-player\r\nof Alexander the Great, received Athenian citizenship and was honored\r\nwith a statue.[699] The philosopher Ktesibios of Chalkis was fond of\r\nthe game.[700] A special room, called the σφαιριστήριον, was a part of\r\nthe later gymnasium.[701] The game was specially indulged in at Sparta.\r\nSeveral inscriptions, mostly from the age of the Antonines, commemorate\r\nvictories by teams of ball-players there.[702] The name σφαιρεῖς\r\nwas given to Spartan youths in the first year of manhood. These\r\ncompetitions took place in the Δρόμος at Sparta.[703] Though, then,\r\nwe should naturally expect statues of ball-players, like the one in\r\nAthens of Aristonikos already mentioned, the calm mien of the Cerigotto\r\nbronze and the direction of the gaze are certainly, as Th. Reinach said\r\nearlier, against interpreting it as the statue of one engaged in so\r\nactive a sport. Von Mach, because of its voluptuous appearance, thought\r\nit might represent merely a _bon vivant_. While Lechat interpreted it\r\nas possibly an athlete receiving a crown from Nike,[704] Arvanitopoulos\r\nwould have the right hand either hold a lekythion or be quite empty,\r\nand the left a strigil, thus restoring the statue as an apoxyomenos. S.\r\nReinach would regard it merely as a funerary monument.\r\n\r\nIn all this discrepancy of opinion it is not difficult to recognize\r\nelements of both god and mortal blended. The resemblance in the\r\nexpression and features of the face to those of the Praxitelean\r\n_Hermes_, even though superficial, as well as the pose of the right arm\r\nrecall the god; the muscular build of the figure fits either the god\r\nHermes, in his character of overseer of the sports of the palæstra, or\r\nan athlete. It therefore seems reasonable to see in this Hellenistic\r\nstatue of varied artistic tendencies merely the representation of an\r\nathlete, perhaps of a pentathlete, who is holding a crown or possibly\r\nan apple as a prize of victory in the right hand, whose form and\r\nfeatures have been assimilated to those of Hermes.\r\n\r\nHow the statue of an indisputable Hermes Logios, on the other hand,\r\nappears, may be seen in the _Hermes Ludovisi_ of the Museo delle\r\nTerme, Rome,[705] and in its replica in the Louvre. The original of\r\nthis marble copy, dating from the middle of the fifth century B. C.,\r\nhas been variously ascribed to Pheidias,[706] Myron,[707] and others.\r\nIn this statue the petasos, chlamys, and kerykeion indicate the god,\r\nwhile the position of the right arm raised toward the head[708] and\r\nthe earnest expression of concentration in the face bespeak the god of\r\noratory. The careful replica of the statue, except the head, in the\r\nLouvre, is the work of Kleomenes of Athens, a sculptor of the first\r\ncentury B. C. The copyist, however, has given to the original a Roman\r\nportrait-head, whence it has been falsely called _Germanicus_.[709] The\r\nParis statue, then, is merely another example of the conversion of an\r\noriginal god-type, for the sculptor wished to represent a Roman under\r\nthe guise of Hermes Logios, since the inscribed tortoise shell retained\r\nat the feet is a well-known attribute of the god.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent example of a true Hermes head is the fine\r\nPolykleitan one in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which is a\r\ncopy of a well-known type represented by the _Boboli Hermes_ in\r\nFlorence and other replicas.[710] Though S. Reinach classed this\r\nhead as Kresilæan,[711] its true Polykleitan character has been\r\nestablished,[712] even if it does not merit the praise formerly given\r\nit by Robinson, of being “easily the best extant copy of a work by\r\nPolykleitos.”[713]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Statue of the so-called _Jason_\r\n(_Sandal-binder_). Louvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe so-called _Jason_ of the Louvre and its many replicas[714] (Fig.\r\n8) probably represent athletes in the guise of Hermes. These statues\r\nare copies of an original of the end of the fourth century B. C., when\r\nthe favorite motive originated—probably with Lysippos—of representing\r\na figure, as in this case, with one foot on a rock, bending over and\r\ntying a sandal. Since the replicas in Munich and Paris extend both\r\narms to the right foot, while those in London and Athens extend the\r\nleft arm over the breast, with the hand resting on the right knee,\r\nKlein has argued two different versions of a common type. He compares\r\nthe former with figures on the west frieze of the Parthenon, the\r\nlatter with the well-known relief of Nike tying her sandal, from the\r\nNike balustrade now in the Akropolis Museum. The one type he assigns\r\nto Lysippos, the other (with both arms down) to an earlier artist.\r\nHowever, the proportions of both groups agree with the Lysippan canon\r\nand so we should assume only one artist. The discussion whether the\r\nfigure is tying or untying the sandal is as barren as the similar\r\none raised about the Athena from the Nike balustrade;[715] but the\r\nquestion as to who is represented by the type is worthy of careful\r\nconsideration. The statue in the Louvre at first was believed to\r\nrepresent Cincinnatus called from the plough, but Winckelmann, without\r\nevidence, gave it its present name of _Jason_. In recent years it has\r\nbeen interpreted as Hermes tying on his sandals, his head raised to\r\nhearken to the behest of Zeus before going forth from Olympos on his\r\nduties as messenger. This interpretation was based on the description\r\nof a statue of the god by Christodoros,[716] and the fact that the type\r\nconforms with a representation of Hermes on a coin of Markianopolis\r\nin Mœsia.[717] Arndt has argued from the coin and from the motive\r\nof the statue that Hermes and not an athlete is intended; thus the\r\ninclination of the head, he thinks, is not that of an athlete looking\r\nout over the theatre, since the regard is not far off, but merely\r\nupward; the presence of the chlamys and the sandals also fits the god.\r\nHe therefore refers the copies to a Hermes-type originated by Lysippos.\r\nBut Froehner’s idea that they represent athletes, even if the type were\r\ninvented for Hermes, is in line with our idea of the assimilation of\r\nathlete types to that of Hermes. In this connection it may be added\r\nthat the head of an athlete in Turin,[718] dating from the late third\r\nor early second century B. C., is very similar to that of the Louvre\r\nfigure, and especially to the Fagan head in London. The pose of an\r\nathlete binding on a sandal was doubtless chosen by the sculptor merely\r\nto show the play of the muscles.\r\n\r\nHeads of Hermes are often found with victor fillets,[719] and some\r\nof these doubtless are from statues of victors. The beautiful\r\nfourth-century B. C. Parian marble head of a beardless youth in the\r\nBritish Museum, known as the Aberdeen head,[720] which resembles so\r\nstrongly the Praxitelean _Hermes_, although lacking its delicacy,\r\nmay be from a victor statue assimilated to the god, for holes show\r\nthat it once wore a metal wreath. In Roman days the _Doryphoros_ of\r\nPolykleitos, as we have seen, was adapted to represent Hermes, and\r\nwas set up in various palæstræ and gymnasia. The Naples copy of the\r\n_Doryphoros_ stood in the Palaistra of Pompeii,[721] and statues of\r\nephebes carrying lances (hastae, δόρατα) and called _Achilleae_ by\r\nPliny,[722] which must have been largely copies of Polykleitos’ great\r\nstatue, were set up in gymnasia. A later type of Hermes-head often\r\nappeared on bodies of the _Doryphoros_,[723] while other statues,\r\nshowing the body of the _Doryphoros_ draped with the chlamys,[724] and\r\nmany torsos following the attitude and form of this statue, have the\r\nchlamys, which shows that they were intended for the god.[725] Hermes\r\nin the _Doryphoros_ pose, in a bronze of the British Museum,[726] is\r\nprobably intended for an athlete. Furtwaengler has shown[727] that the\r\nold Argive schema of the boxer Aristion at Olympia by Polykleitos[728]\r\nwas used in the master’s circle for statues of Hermes. The best\r\npreserved example of a number of existing statues of this type is one\r\nin Lansdowne House, London,[729] in the pose of the Aristion, holding\r\nan object—probably a kerykeion—in the hand and a chlamys over the left\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHLETE STATUES ASSIMILATED TO TYPES OF APOLLO.\r\n\r\nApollo figures in mythology as an athlete. In the Iliad, at the opening\r\nof the boxing match between Epeios and Euryalos,[730] he is mentioned\r\nas the god of boxing, which refers, perhaps, to his presiding over the\r\neducation of youths (κουροτρόφος) and to his gift of manly prowess.\r\nPausanias records that he overcame Hermes in running and Ares in\r\nboxing.[731] He gives these victories of the god as the reason why the\r\nflute played a Pythian air at the later pentathlon. Plutarch says that\r\nthe Delphians sacrificed to Apollo the boxer (πύκτης), and the Cretans\r\nand Spartans to Apollo the runner (δρομαῖος).[732] Apollo’s fight with\r\nHerakles to wrest from the hero the stolen tripod of Delphi,[733]\r\nwhich is the subject of many surviving works of art,[734] is outside\r\nthe realm of athletics. As with Hermes, it is often difficult to\r\ndistinguish between statues of Apollo and those of victors assimilated\r\nto his type. A good instance of this doubt is afforded by the long and\r\nindecisive discussion of the monument represented by several replicas,\r\nespecially by the _Choiseul-Gouffier_ statue in the British Museum\r\n(Pl. 7A), and the so-called _Apollo-on-the-Omphalos_ (Pl. 7B) found\r\nin 1862 in the ruins of the theatre of Dionysos at Athens, and now in\r\nthe National Museum there.[735] The bronze original of these marble\r\ncopies must have been famous, to judge from the number of replicas\r\nof it. It has been ascribed to many different artists—to Kalamis,\r\nPythagoras, Alkamenes, Pasiteles,[736] to one on more, to another\r\non less probability. As A. H. Smith has pointed out, the _krobylos_\r\ntreatment of the hair almost certainly indicates an Attic sculptor\r\nof the first half of the fifth century B. C. But here again the\r\nmain interest in these copies is to determine whether the original\r\nrepresented Apollo or an athlete. The connection between the Athens\r\nreplica and the _omphalos_ found with it is all but disproved[737]\r\nand can not be used as evidence that the statue represents the god.\r\nHowever, the original has been called an Apollo because of the\r\npresence of a quiver on certain of the copies. Thus, while we have a\r\ntree-trunk beside the _Choiseul-Gouffier_ example, we have a quiver\r\non the copy in the Palazzo Torlonia in Rome,[738] and on a similar\r\nstatue in the Fridericianum in Kassel,[739] and both tree and quiver\r\non the fragment of a leg from the Palatine now in the Museo delle\r\nTerme.[740] The Ventnor head in the British Museum[741] has long locks\r\nsuited to Apollo, and the head from Kyrene there[742] was actually\r\nfound in a temple of Apollo. It has also been pointed out that the\r\nhead of a similar figure, undoubtedly an Apollo, appears on a relief\r\nin the Capitoline Museum,[743] and a similar figure is found on a\r\nred-figured krater in Bologna, which shows the god standing on a\r\npillar with a laurel wreath in the lowered left hand and a bowl in the\r\nright.[744] On coins of Athens, moreover, we see the figure of Apollo\r\nin a similar attitude with a laurel wreath in the lowered right hand\r\nand a bow in the left.[745] From such evidence a good case for an\r\nApollo has been made out by many scholars—A. H. Smith, Winter,[746]\r\nHelbig,[747] Conze,[748] Furtwaengler,[749] Schreiber,[750] Dickins,\r\nand others. The evidence of the quiver in the delle Terme fragment\r\nand the Torlonia replica is looked upon as a deliberate device of the\r\ncopyist to indicate the god. The attempt especially to connect it with\r\nthe _Apollo Alexikakos_ of Kalamis[751] must certainly fall, since the\r\ndate is about the only thing in its favor. In the long list of statues\r\nascribed to this sculptor,[752] there is none of an athlete, and the\r\n_Choiseul-Gouffier_ type, whether it represents Apollo or an athlete,\r\nhas a markedly athletic character. If the Delphi _Charioteer_ (Fig. 66)\r\nbe ascribed to Kalamis, certainly this type of statue can have nothing\r\nto do with him or his school. Nor is the type at all identical with the\r\n_Alexikakos_ appearing on coins of Athens,[753] in which the locks of\r\nhair, in the true archaic fashion of a cultus statue, fall down over\r\nthe god’s shoulders. Besides, the work of Kalamis, characterized by\r\nλεπτότης and χάρις,[754] must have been of the delicate later archaic\r\nstyle of the transition period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 7A\r\n\r\nStatue of the so-called _Apollo Choiseul-Gouffier_. British Museum,\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 7B\r\n\r\nStatue of the so-called _Apollo-on-the-Omphalos_. National Museum,\r\nAthens.]\r\n\r\nWaldstein, however, has made a good case against the evidence adduced\r\nfor interpreting the original as Apollo and he believes that the\r\nstatue represents an athlete.[755] The thongs thrown over the stump\r\nin the _Choiseul-Gouffier_ statue, doubtless those of a boxer, seem\r\nto point to an athlete for that copy at least. The muscular form and\r\nathletic coiffure of all the copies also point to the same conclusion,\r\neven if Waldstein’s ascription of the original statue to the boxer\r\nEuthymos, whose statue by Pythagoras of Rhegion stood in the Altis at\r\nOlympia,[756] is only a guess. Wolters thinks the _Choiseul-Gouffier_\r\nstatue may represent an athlete, but is against Waldstein’s\r\nascription of the work to Pythagoras.[757]\r\n\r\nThough differing in detail, the rendering of the hair, common to\r\nall the replicas, is a purely athletic coiffure. The argument for\r\nattributing the original to Apollo, based on the curls around the\r\nface, is of no importance, since a similar coiffure appears on many\r\nephebe heads by various Attic masters of the same or a slightly\r\nearlier period. The hair treatment on a little-known replica of the\r\nhead in the British Museum[758] gives us an additional argument in\r\ndetermining whether the original was an Apollo or not. On this head\r\nthere are two corkscrew curls side by side just back of the ears,\r\nwhich are so inorganically attached and so unsuited to the style\r\nof head as to make us believe that they were added by the copyist,\r\neven if their absence in other copies were not proof enough of this\r\nfact. Apparently the copyist adopted a well-known type of athlete and\r\ntried to convert it into an Apollo by the use of this Apolline hair\r\nattribute. The only other Apolline attribute, the quiver on the copies\r\nin the Palazzo Torlonia[759] and Museo delle Terme, may have been\r\nadded as a fortuitous adjunct by the copyists, who were converting an\r\noriginal athlete statue into one of Apollo. It may be added, also,\r\nthat the quiver does not always indicate the god, as we shall see\r\nin discussing the Delian _Diadoumenos_ (Pl. 18). When we consider,\r\ntherefore, the athletic pose, the massive outline and proportions, the\r\nhigh-arched chest, the muscular arms and thighs, the accentuation of\r\nthe veins,[760] the fashion of the hair, and the relatively small size\r\nof the head, together with the presence of the boxing-thongs on the\r\nLondon example, it seems reasonable to conclude that in this series of\r\ncopies we may see an original athlete statue, which in certain cases\r\nwas later transformed into statues of Apollo. Even if the original\r\nwas actually an Apollo, its proportions were far better suited to the\r\npatron of athletic exercises than to the leader of a celestial choir.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the similar use of the same type of head is shown by\r\nthe colossal statue of Apollo unearthed at Olympia.[761] Here we see\r\nthe same coiffure as in the heads discussed, but the presence of the\r\nremnants of a lyre indubitably shows that this copy was intended for\r\nApollo, and so it has been rightly assigned by Treu, not to the fifth,\r\nbut to a later century. When long hair was no longer the fashion for\r\nathletes, a later artist might mistakenly think that the earlier plaits\r\nwere genuinely Apolline, though we know that they were common to all\r\nearly athletic art. Another head in the British Museum has been ably\r\ndiscussed by Mrs. Strong,[762] who shows that it comes from an Apollo\r\nand not from an athlete statue. It is similar to an Apollo pictured on\r\na stater struck at Mytilene about 400 B. C.,[763] and consequently,\r\nlike the statue from Olympia, it is merely an instance of the process\r\nof converting an athlete statue into that of an Apollo.\r\n\r\nThe marble copy of the _Diadoumenos_ of Polykleitos, found on the\r\nisland of Delos in 1894, and now in the National Museum in Athens[764]\r\n(Pl. 18), has a chlamys and a quiver introduced on the marble support\r\nagainst the right leg. Until recently these attributes were regarded\r\nas the arbitrary introductions of the Hellenistic copyist, who wished\r\nto convert the famous athlete statue into one of Apollo, but lately it\r\nhas been suggested that they belonged to the original statue, which\r\nis assumed to have represented Apollo. Thus, Hauser has propounded\r\nthe theory that the _Diadoumenos_ was originally an Apollo.[765] He\r\ndoes not believe that the Delian sculptor could have transformed a\r\nshort-haired athlete into an Apollo, since the typical Apollo after\r\nthe time of Praxiteles was never represented as athletic. He later\r\nsupported his theory that the _Diadoumenos_ was originally an Apollo by\r\nthe evidence of a bronze statuette and a Delphian coin, and reasserted\r\nhis view that so virile a short-haired Apollo did not originate with\r\nthe later copyist, but in the fifth century B. C.[766] Hauser’s\r\nargument that Apollo was the original of the _Diadoumenos_ seems as\r\nunsuccessful as his contention that Polykleitos’ other great creation,\r\nthe _Doryphoros_, is to be classed as an _Achilles_.[767] Loewy has\r\nsufficiently opposed Hauser’s theory of the _Diadoumenos_, by showing\r\nthat the palm-tree prop in all the marble replicas of that statue\r\npoints to athletic victories.[768] He rightly explains the Apolline\r\nattributes of the Delian copy as the perfectly natural additions of an\r\nartist who lived on the island reputed to be the birthplace of the god.\r\nHis ascription of the Polykleitan statue to the pentathlete Pythokles,\r\nthe base of whose statue at Olympia has been found,[769] is doubtful.\r\nMore recently Ada Maviglia has shown the literary grounds for regarding\r\nthe _Diadoumenos_ as an athlete, and not an Apollo.[770]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of distinguishing between statues of athletes and Apollo\r\nis also shown by the very beautiful fifth century B. C. Parian marble\r\nhead in Turin,[771] which is certainly a copy of an original Greek\r\nbronze. Furtwaengler, because of the hair, wrongly believed it the head\r\nof a diadoumenos, and connected it with Kresilas,[772] while Amelung\r\nand Wace[773] have found in it Attic and Polykleitan influences. The\r\nhair is parted over the centre of the forehead, as in the _Diadoumenos_\r\nand the _Doryphoros_, and in other works attributed to the Polykleitan\r\nschool, while the locks over the ears and the plaits wound round the\r\nhead have Attic analogues.[774]\r\n\r\n\r\nATHLETE STATUES ASSIMILATED TO TYPES OF HERAKLES.\r\n\r\nHerakles was the reputed founder of the games at Olympia.[775] He\r\nwas a famous wrestler, Pausanias frequently mentioning his combats\r\nwith giants.[776] He won in both wrestling and the pankration at\r\nOlympia.[777] In connection with the victory of Straton of Alexandria,\r\nwho won in these two events on the same day,[778] Pausanias names\r\nthree men before him and three men after him who won in these events\r\non the same day.[779] We learn their dates from Africanus.[780] After\r\nthe date of the last of these victories, Ol. 204 (= 37 A. D.), the\r\nElean umpires, in order to check professionalism, refused to allow\r\ncontestants to enter for both events.[781] To win the crown of wild\r\nolive in both these events was therefore regarded as a great honor,\r\nand in the Olympic lists a special note was made of such victors, who\r\nwere called πρῶτος, δεύτερος, τρίτος, κ. τ. λ., ἀφ’ Ἡρακλέους.[782]\r\nThey also received the title of παράδοξος or παραδοξονίκης.[783]\r\nStatues of Herakles, like those of Hermes and Theseus, were commonly\r\nset up in gymnasia and palæstræ throughout Greece,[784] and it was\r\nbut natural that Olympic victors, especially those in the two events\r\nmentioned, should want their statues assimilated to those of the hero.\r\nThe difficulty of deciding whether a given statue is one of Herakles\r\nor of a victor is even greater than that of distinguishing between\r\nstatues of victors and those of Hermes or Apollo. To quote Homolle:\r\n“_Maintes fois, comme pour la tête d’Olympie, comme pour plusieurs\r\nautres encore, on peut se demander si le personnage représenté est le\r\nhéros luimême sous les traits d’un athlête ou un athlête fait à l’image\r\ndu héros_.”[785] In reference to the statue of Agias by Lysippos\r\ndiscovered at Delphi, which is an excellent example of the assimilation\r\nprocess which we are discussing, he continues: “_Ici en particulier,\r\nétant donnée la nature du monument, il est permis de supposer que\r\nl’auteur ... ait voulu élever le personnage à la hauteur idéale du type\r\ndivin en qu’ Agias ait été assimilé à Héraclès_.”[786]\r\n\r\nWe shall discuss a few examples of this process of assimilation to\r\ntypes of Herakles. Our ascription of the head from Olympia mentioned\r\nby Homolle, which was found in the ruins of the Gymnasion, to the\r\nstatue of the Akarnanian pancratiast Philandridas by Lysippos[787]\r\n(Frontispiece and Fig. 69) will be discussed in a later chapter.[788]\r\nThe swollen ears and hair-fillet might pass for hero or mortal, for\r\nin deciding whether a given head represents Herakles or a victor,\r\nthe ears are not the deciding criterion, since many heroes had the\r\n“pancratiast” swollen ear, as we shall see later. A good example of\r\nassimilation is seen in the beautiful little marble head of a man,\r\nfound in Athens and now in the Glyptothek Ny-Carlsberg in Copenhagen,\r\ndating from the early Hellenistic age.[789] As traces of color remain\r\nin the hair, some have thought that this head came from the reliefs\r\non the “Alexander” sarcophagus from Sidon, belonging to the body of\r\na headless youth represented there. Though the marble (Pentelic)\r\nand the dimensions would fit, it would be the only head on the\r\nsarcophagus with a band in the hair, and so the question can not be\r\ndefinitely decided.[790] The head was at first called a Herakles,\r\nthough Furtwaengler rightly saw in it an ideal representation of an\r\nathlete, even if the ears are not swollen. A bronze head of a youth\r\nfrom Herculaneum, now in Naples, is evidently a part of the statue\r\nof a victor or of Herakles.[791] A Polykleitan ephebe head-type,\r\nwith rolled fillet around the hair and swollen ears, represented by\r\nreplicas in Naples, in Rome, and elsewhere, may represent a boxer in\r\nthe guise of the hero.[792] In the Roman copy of the group of Herakles\r\nand Telephos in the Museo Chiaramonti of the Vatican, Herakles, still\r\nthe god, wears a fillet.[793] Similarly, a colossal head of mediocre\r\nworkmanship in the Sala dei Busti of the Vatican represents the hero\r\nwith a fillet,[794] while another head in the Capitoline Museum, with\r\nfillet and swollen ears, seems to represent Herakles as a victorious\r\nathlete.[795] Many other heads in various museums, which are commonly\r\ncalled heads of Herakles, may represent athletes in the heroic guise. A\r\ngood example is the Parian marble terminal bust of the fourth century\r\nB. C., representing a young Herakles wreathed with poplar, now in the\r\nBritish Museum (Fig. 31).[796] In this head the ears are bruised.\r\nIt seems to have been copied from some well-known statue of Lysippan\r\nor Skopaic tendencies. Another head in the British Museum shows the\r\nbeardless hero, his hair encircled by a diadem, and his ears broken\r\nand crushed.[797] This almost certainly comes from a victor statue.\r\nMany bronze statuettes in the British Museum may be interpreted either\r\nas Herakles or as victors.[798] A bronze from Corfu represents a nude\r\nHerakles or an athlete, with the left foot advanced and the left hand\r\nextended. The objects held in both hands are lost, but the challenging\r\npose and expression indicate a boxer.[799] Similarly a small bronze\r\nin Berlin, represented with a fillet and in the walking pose, may be\r\na Herakles or a victor.[800] Duetschke gives two examples of heads\r\nin the Uffizi, both of them having fillets, and one of them having\r\nswollen ears, which may come from statues of the hero or victors.[801]\r\nHeads of the hero with the rolled fillet can not, however, according\r\nto Furtwaengler, be classed as victors, since he believes that this\r\nattribute was borrowed from the symposium, to distinguish the glorified\r\nhero rejoicing in the celestial banquet.[802]\r\n\r\n\r\nATHLETES REPRESENTED AS THE DIOSKOUROI.\r\n\r\nKastor is said to have won the foot-race and Polydeukes the boxing\r\nmatch, at Olympia.[803] They had an altar at the entrance to the\r\nHippodrome there,[804] and were called “Starters of the Race”\r\nat Sparta.[805] A stadion, in which they were fabled to have\r\ncontended, was shown in Hermione, in Corinthia.[806] Kastor was a\r\nfamous horse-racer in Homer and later writers,[807] and Polydeukes\r\na famous boxer,[808] both being κατ’ ἐξοχήν the rider and boxer\r\nrespectively.[809] Scenes showing Athena setting garlands on\r\nvictorious hoplite racers (?) appear on reliefs of the Dioskouroi\r\nfrom Tarentum.[810] An archaic Argive inscription tells how a certain\r\nAischylos won the stade-race four times and the hoplite-race three\r\ntimes at Argos, for which he dedicated a slab to the Dioskouroi, which\r\ndepicted them in relief.[811] An inscribed bronze quoit of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C. from Kephallenia(?), now in the British Museum, was\r\ndedicated to the two heroes by Exoïdas for a victory (apparently in\r\nthe pentathlon).[812] A bronze four-spoked wheel with a dedicatory\r\ninscription in their honor was found at Argos, probably the remnant\r\nof a monument erected for a chariot victory.[813] Doubtless certain\r\nvictor statues were assimilated to them, though we have no direct\r\nevidence of the fact. Ordinary dead men appeared in the guise of the\r\nDioskouroi on sepulchral reliefs, just as we have seen that in statuary\r\nthey were heroized into statues of Hermes. Thus a grave-relief in honor\r\nof Pamphilos and Alexandros in Verona shows on the projecting lower\r\nrim the two Dioskouroi, the figure to the right carrying a lance in\r\nthe right hand and holding the bridle of a horse in the left, while\r\nthe figure to the left holds a lance in the left hand and touches a\r\nhorse’s head with the right.[814] A votive relief in the British Museum\r\nrepresents two youths on horseback, who, despite the absence of the\r\nconical cap or pilleus, are probably the Dioskouroi.[815] Their short\r\nhair is bound with diadems, which shows that the dead men may have been\r\nvictors.\r\n\r\nSufficient examples of the process of assimilation have now been given\r\nto prove that it was not an uncommon device of the ancient sculptor\r\nand to show the difficulty of distinguishing between types of gods and\r\nathletes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVICTOR STATUES REPRESENTED AT REST.\r\n\r\nPLATES 8-21 AND FIGURES 9-31.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen[816] that it was a very old custom in Greece to dedicate\r\nstatues of victors at the great national games to the god in whose\r\nhonor the games were held. On many sites, especially at Olympia, tiny\r\nstatuettes of clay or bronze of very primitive technique have been\r\nfound in great numbers, which represent victors in many attitudes and\r\nways—as horsemen, warriors, charioteers, etc. By the sixth century B.\r\nC. this ancient custom, as we learn from literary, epigraphical, and\r\nmonumental sources, had developed, with the rapid progress attained by\r\nthe sculptor’s art, into the regular practice of erecting life-size\r\nstatues of athletes at the site of the games or in the native city\r\nof the victor. Especially at Olympia hundreds of such monuments were\r\ngradually collected, whose numbers and beauty must have exerted an\r\noverwhelming impression on the visitor to the Altis. We shall now begin\r\nthe consideration of these monuments in detail.\r\n\r\nThe victor statues at Olympia, as elsewhere, may be conveniently\r\ndivided into two main groups—those which represent the victor as\r\nstanding or seated at rest, before or after the contest, and those\r\nwhich represent him in movement, _i. e._, in some contest schema.[817]\r\nExamples of statues of athletes represented at rest are common in Greek\r\nathletic sculpture. We need only mention the so-called _Oil-pourer_\r\nof Munich (Pl. 11), who is represented as pouring oil over his body\r\nto make his limbs more supple for the coming wrestling bout; the\r\n_Diadoumenos_ of Polykleitos (Pls. 17, 18, and Fig. 28), who is binding\r\na victor fillet around his head after a successful encounter; the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_ of the school of Lysippos (Pl. 29), representing an\r\nathlete scraping off the oil and dirt from his body after his victory.\r\nIn this class of statues, which forms by far the greater number and\r\nshows the richer motives, the poses are quiet and reserved, the figures\r\nare compact, and the expression earnest and even thoughtful. As\r\nexamples of statues represented in movement we need only recall such\r\nwell-known works as the _Diskobolos_ of Myron with its rhythmic lines\r\nand vivacious expression (Pls. 22, 23, and Figs. 34, 35); the bronze\r\nwrestlers of Naples, who are bending eagerly forward watching for a\r\ngrip (Fig. 51); or the artistically intertwined pancratiast group of\r\nFlorence (Pl. 25). Such monuments show us the varied poses, the choice\r\nof the critical moment, the truth to life, and the masterly rhythm\r\nattained by certain sculptors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APOLLO TYPE.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall confine ourselves almost entirely to the\r\nstatues of victors represented at rest, discussing those represented\r\nin motion chiefly in the next. Most of the oldest statues at Olympia,\r\ndating from a time when there were few variations in the sculptural\r\ntype, must have been represented at rest and in the schema of the\r\nso-called “Apollos.” Ever since the discovery of the _Apollo of Thera_\r\nin 1836 (Fig. 9), this _genre_ of sculpture, the most characteristic of\r\nthe early period, extending from the end of the seventh century B. C.\r\nto the time of the gable groups of Aegina, has been carefully studied.\r\nThough we now know that the type passed equally well for gods and\r\nmortals,[818] we still keep the name, because of its familiarity and\r\nfor the sake of having a common designation. That this type actually\r\nrepresented Olympic victors we have indubitable proof. Pausanias\r\nmentions the stone victor statue of the pancratiast Arrhachion, dating\r\nfrom the first half of the sixth century B. C., which stood in the\r\nagora of his native town Phigalia. He describes it as archaic in pose,\r\nwith the feet close together and the arms hanging down the sides to\r\nthe hips—the typical “Apollo” schema.[819] Moreover, this very statue\r\nhas survived to our time (Fig. 79).[820] A study, therefore, of this\r\ntype of statue will give us an idea of how some of the early statues at\r\nOlympia looked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Statue of so-called _Apollo of Thera_. National\r\nMuseum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Statue of so-called _Apollo of Orchomenos_.\r\nNational Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Statue of so-called _Apollo_, from Mount Ptoion,\r\nBœotia. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nThe “Apollo” statues,[821] because of differences in facial expression,\r\nhave been conveniently divided into two groups: those represented by\r\nthe examples from Thera, Melos, Volomandra, Tenea, etc., sometimes\r\nnamed the “grinning” group, because the corners of the mouth are turned\r\nupwards into the so-called “archaic smile,” and those represented\r\nby the examples from Orchomenos, the precinct of Mount Ptoion, and\r\nelsewhere, named the “stolid” group, because in them the mouth forms a\r\nstraight line.[822] There are, however, essential differences between\r\nthe statues of each group. Thus, while some of both groups—_e. g._, the\r\nexamples from Melos, Volomandra, and Orchomenos—have square shoulders,\r\nmost of the others have sloping ones. The type gradually improved, as\r\nin each successive attempt the sculptor overcame difficulties, until\r\nfinally revolutionary changes had taken place in the original form.\r\nThis improvement is seen in the treatment of the hair, in the modeling\r\nof the face and body, and in the proportions of the statues. In a\r\nhead of a statue from Mount Ptoion[823]—which is broken off at the\r\nneck—we seem to see the sculptor in wood making his first attempt in\r\nstone. In the archaic example from Thera[824] (Fig. 9) the arms hang\r\nstraight down close to the sides, as in the statue of Arrhachion, being\r\ndetached only slightly from the body at the elbows, showing that the\r\nartist was afraid that they might break off. In other examples, as in\r\nthe one from Orchomenos[825] (Fig. 10) and one from Mount Ptoion[826]\r\n(Fig. 11), the space between the arms and the body has become larger,\r\nwhile in the example from Melos[827] (Fig. 12) only the hands are\r\nglued to the thighs. In the “Apollo” found at Tenea in 1846, and now\r\nin Munich[828] (Pl. 8A), the arms are free, but the hands are held\r\nfast to the body by the retention of small marble bridges between them\r\nand the thighs. The final step has been taken in two examples from\r\nMount Ptoion (Fig. 13), in which the arms from the shoulders down are\r\nfree from the bodies.[829] The bridges shown on the photograph in the\r\nfigure to the left, which connect the forearms with the thighs, are of\r\nplaster, being added at the time the statue was set up in Athens.[830]\r\nThe figure to the right is smaller and clearly discloses Aeginetan\r\ninfluence. The audacity of the sculptor in entirely freeing the arms\r\nin both examples was rewarded by the arms being broken off. Similarly,\r\nin the _Strangford Apollo_ of the British Museum (Fig. 14),[831] the\r\narms, which hung loose from the shoulders, are broken away. The larger\r\nstatue from Mount Ptoion just mentioned also has the arms slightly\r\ncrooked at the elbows, the forearms being extended at an oblique angle\r\nto the body. This represents an intermediate stage between the earlier\r\n“Apollos,” in which the arms adhered vertically to the sides of the\r\nbody (as _e. g._, in the ones from Orchomenos, Thera, Melos, and\r\nTenea), and the later ones, in which the arms were bent, the forearms\r\nbeing extended at right angles to the body (see Figs. 15 and 19).[832]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Statue of so-called _Apollo of Melos_. National\r\nMuseum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nThe example from Thera shows the archaic method of working in planes\r\nparallel to front and side and at right angles to one another, the\r\ncorners of the square block being merely rounded off. The outlines\r\nof muscles are indicated by shallow grooves, which do not affect the\r\nflatness of the surface, and there is but little facial expression. We\r\nsee the chest outlined in some examples from Aktion.[833] In the Melian\r\nexample the rectangular form is modified by cutting away the sides\r\nobliquely in arms and body; here there is more expression in the face,\r\nand the treatment of the hair and the proportions of the body are more\r\ndeveloped. In the example from Orchomenos we see a great improvement in\r\nform. Here, as in later Bœotian examples, the original rectangular\r\nform of the example from Thera has become round, so that a horizontal\r\ncross-section through the waist is almost circular; the muscles of\r\nthe abdomen are indicated and the skin is naturalistically shown in\r\nthe back and at the elbows. In later Bœotian examples from Mount\r\nPtoion, which are directly developed from the Orchomenos type,[834]\r\nthe form is lighter and the proportions more graceful. In one example\r\n(Fig. 13, left) even the veins are shown. In the example mentioned\r\nabove as showing Aeginetan influence, and dated about 500 B. C.,[835]\r\nthe muscles are clearly marked, just as in the _Strangford_ example\r\nand in the statues from the temple at Aegina, showing that foreign\r\nart had been introduced into Bœotia by that time. In the example\r\nfrom Volomandra in Attica,[836] we see affinity to the examples from\r\nThera and Melos, but Attic softness in the carving of the shoulders\r\nand in the proportions. In the _Apollo of Tenea_ (Pl. 8A), “by far\r\nthe most beautiful preserved statue of archaic sculpture,”[837] a\r\nstatue most carefully worked, we see a Peloponnesian example of the\r\nbeginning of the sixth or even of the end of the seventh century B.\r\nC. Here the sculptor has shown great care in executing details and in\r\nthe proportions. The eyes are not flat, but convex, and are wide open\r\nas in most of the earlier examples. The downward flow of the lines of\r\nthe statue is striking, which is caused by the sloping shoulders and\r\nthe elongated triangular-shaped abdomen. The slimness of the figure,\r\nwith the contour of bones and muscles, is remarkable at so early a\r\ndate. The fashioning of the knees is detailed. When we contrast this\r\ntall, slim, agile statue with the massively square-built Argive type\r\nfound at Delphi (Pl. 8B), we find it reasonable to suspect that\r\nthe _Apollo of Tenea_ is an imported work, coming probably from the\r\nislands.[838] The two statues of (?) Kleobis and Biton, discovered at\r\nDelphi in 1893 and 1894, and inscribed with the name of the sculptor\r\nPolymedes of Argos, have added much to our knowledge of early Argive\r\nsculpture (Pl. 8B, = Statue A).[839] This Polymedes may have been\r\none of the predecessors acknowledged by Eutelidas and Chrysothemis,\r\namong the first victor statuaries known to us by name, in the epigram\r\npreserved by Pausanias from the base of the monument of Damaretos and\r\nhis son Theopompos at Olympia.[840] The epigram, in any case, implies\r\nthat the reputation of the Argive school in athletic sculpture was\r\nalready well established by the end of the sixth century B. C. These\r\nmassively built statues, dating from the beginning of the sixth century\r\nB. C., outline the muscles to a certain extent, even showing the line\r\nof the false ribs by incised lines. They display, however, but little\r\ndetail in modeling, except in the knees, where the artist has tried to\r\nindicate the bones and muscles. The features of the large heads are\r\nwithout expression; the large eyes are flat and not convex, as in the\r\nexample from Tenea, though the Argive artist was, perhaps, later than\r\nthe Corinthian one, and a long distance removed from the later artist\r\nof the Ligourió bronze (Fig. 16), to be discussed later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Statues of so-called _Apollos_ from Mount\r\nPtoion. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 8A\r\n\r\nA. Statue of so-called _Apollo of Tenea_. Glyptothek, Munich.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 8B\r\n\r\nB. So-called _Argive Apollo_ from Delphi. Museum of Delphi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Statue known as the _Strangford Apollo_. British\r\nMuseum, London.]\r\n\r\nIn all these “Apollos,” which have been found all over the Greek world\r\nfrom Naukratis in Egypt to Ambrakia, and along the Asian coast and\r\non the Aegean Isles, the archaic artists have attempted, by their\r\nmodeling of the muscles, especially of the chest and abdomen, to\r\nexpress trained strength. The heavy Argive examples, which may be said\r\nto be the prototypes of the Ligourió bronze and of the _Doryphoros_\r\nof Polykleitos (Pl. 4 and Fig. 48), are in strong contrast with the\r\nlighter type best represented by the example from Tenea. In the former,\r\nwith their big heads and shoulders and their powerful arms and legs,\r\nwe may see early boxers or pancratiasts; in the latter a long-limbed\r\nrunner, with powerful chest, but slim and supple legs. In the _Apollo\r\nof Tenea_ there is no flabbiness nor softness, and yet no emaciation.\r\nWe see very similar runners on Panathenaic vases. Between the two\r\nextremes we have a long series, those from Mount Ptoion and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt that the early statues of athletes at Olympia showed\r\nall the variations we have discussed in these “Apollos.” Of this\r\ntype, then, were the statues at Olympia of the Spartan Eutelidas,\r\nthe oldest mentioned by Pausanias,[841] those of Phrikias of Pelinna\r\nin Thessaly,[842] and of Phanas of Pellene in Achæa,[843] to whom,\r\nlater on in this chapter, we shall ascribe the two archaic marble\r\nhelmeted heads found at Olympia (Fig. 30), the wooden statues of\r\nPraxidamas and Rhexibios,[844] the statue of Kylon on the Akropolis\r\nof Athens,[845] and that of Hetoimokles at Sparta.[846] The statue of\r\nthe famous wrestler Milo of Kroton by the sculptor Dameas, mentioned\r\nby Pausanias[847] and described by Philostratos,[848] must also\r\nhave conformed with the “Apollo” type, though it showed a step in\r\nadvance of the earlier ones by having its arms bent at the elbow, the\r\nforearms being extended horizontally outward. This statue needs a\r\nsomewhat detailed account. The description of Philostratos seems to\r\nhave been founded on the account in Pausanias[849] of Milo’s prowess,\r\nwhich, in turn, may have arisen from the appearance of the statue and\r\nthe cicerone’s description. Philostratos says that it stood on a\r\nquoit with the feet close together and with the left hand grasping a\r\npomegranate, the fingers of the right hand being extended straight out,\r\nand a fillet encircling the brows.[850] Philostratos has Apollonios\r\nexplain the attributes of the statue on the ground that the people of\r\nKroton represented their famous victor in the guise of a priest of\r\nHera. This would explain the priestly fillet and the pomegranate sacred\r\nto the goddess, while the diskos, on which the statue rested, would be\r\nthe shield on which Hera’s priest stood when praying. Scherer, however,\r\nrightly pointed out that the statue in the Altis was of Milo the victor\r\nand not the priest. He therefore explained the diskos[851] merely as\r\na round basis on which the statue, of the archaic “Apollo” type with\r\nits feet close together, stood, and the _tainia_ as a victor band. He\r\nfollowed Philostratos in believing that the gesture of the right hand\r\nwas one of adoration.[852] He looked upon the object in the left hand\r\nnot as a pomegranate at all, but as an alabastron, a toilet article\r\nadapted to a victor. He, therefore, believed that the _Apollo_ of the\r\nelder Kanachos of Sikyon,[853] the so-called _Philesian Apollo_,[854]\r\nrepresented nude and holding a tiny fawn in the right hand and a bow\r\nin the left, would give a good idea of the pose of Milo’s statue.[855]\r\nHitzig and Bluemner believe this explanation of Scherer probable,\r\nalthough they rightly disagree with him in his exchanging the\r\npomegranate for an alabastron, since Pausanias expressly mentions a\r\npomegranate in the hand of another victor statue at Olympia.[856] Pliny\r\nspeaks of a male figure by Pythagoras, _mala ferentem nudum_,[857]\r\nand Lucian says apples were prizes at Delphi,[858] and we know that\r\nMilo was also a Pythian victor. The same commentators believe that\r\nPausanias’ story of Milo bursting a cord drawn round his brow by\r\nswelling his veins arose from the victor band on the statue, and the\r\nstory of the strength of his fingers from the position of the fingers\r\non it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Bronze Statuette of a Palæstra Victor, from the\r\nAkropolis. Akropolis Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the “Apollo” statues a considerable variety of\r\nphysical types. In the sixth century B. C. the artist was feeling\r\nhis way and was hampered by local school tendencies. At first he\r\nknew only how to produce rigid statues in the conventional Egyptian\r\nattitude with the arms glued to the sides, the two halves of the\r\nbody being symmetrical and the hips on the same level. He gradually\r\nimproved on this model, making the position more elastic—as in the\r\nstatue of Milo—rightly indicating bones and muscles and giving to the\r\nfigure natural proportions. Bulle has shown on one plate[859] three\r\nstatuettes which illustrate the improvements reached in bronze in\r\nvarious parts of Greece by the end of the sixth century B. C. To the\r\nleft is represented a victorious palæstra gymnast—as is indicated by\r\nthe remnants of akontia in the hands—in the Akropolis Museum (Fig.\r\n15);[860] in the center is the Payne Knight statuette of the British\r\nMuseum,[861] carrying a fawn in the right hand, which is a copy of\r\nthe _Philesian Apollo_ which stood in the Didymaion near Miletos; to\r\nthe right is Hermes with the petasos, short-girded tunic, and winged\r\nsandals, holding a ram in the left and probably a kerykeion in the\r\nright hand.[862] The attributes of the three, then, attest respectively\r\na victor, Apollo, and Hermes. In all three the arms are freed from the\r\nbody, and the muscles of the breast, chest, and abdomen are indicated,\r\nthough carelessly in the case of the victor. The proportions of the\r\nthree vary greatly; the Attic victor has a large head, broad shoulders,\r\npowerful chest, long body, and short legs; the _Apollo_ has long\r\nlegs, shorter though slimmer body, and small head;[863] the _Hermes_\r\nhas a clearly outlined figure and shows the careful modeling so\r\ncharacteristic of the schools of Argos and Sikyon in the fifth century\r\nB. C. Bulle shows that the further development of the “Apollo” type was\r\nhalted by the Argive school, which, while continuing the restful pose\r\nof these figures, counteracted their rigidity by inclining the head\r\nto the side and throwing the weight unevenly on the legs by lowering\r\none hip and further advancing one foot. The central line was no longer\r\nvertical, but curved, and it was now possible to give greater detail to\r\nchest and abdomen. Polykleitos finally perfected this curve and threw\r\nback the left foot, resting the weight of the body on the right—from\r\nwhich time on we have the regular scheme of “free” and “rest” legs.\r\nDespite all these later improvements, Olympic victors continued to\r\nset up statues in the rest attitude of the “Apollo” type down perhaps\r\ninto the third century B. C. Such dedications were the result both of\r\nschool tendencies and economy, especially in the case of equestrian\r\nvictors, who frequently were content to use such “actionless” statues\r\nin place of groups. We have only to mention the monuments of Timon of\r\nElis, whose statue was the work of the Sikyonian Daidalos,[864] and\r\nof Telemachos of Elis, whose statue was made by the otherwise unknown\r\nsculptor Philonides.[865]\r\n\r\nBefore systematically considering victor statues at Olympia and\r\nelsewhere with general motives, _i. e._, represented at rest, we shall\r\nnow rapidly sketch the development of athletic sculpture in four great\r\ncentres, Argos, Sikyon, Aegina, and Athens, even though some of the\r\nworks mentioned were represented in motion. Sculptors of other schools\r\nknown at Olympia will be treated incidentally in both this and the\r\nfollowing chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFFILIATED SCHOOLS OF ARGOS AND SIKYON.\r\n\r\nWhile in general it is unprofitable to discuss sculptors who have\r\nnot surely left any example of their art behind, there are two early\r\nschools of Peloponnesian sculpture, those of Argos and Sikyon, which,\r\nthough we may assign work to them only by conjecture, can not be\r\nsummarily passed over, owing to their great importance in the history\r\nof Greek athletic art. The bronze used in their works was too valuable\r\nto escape the barbarians, and, furthermore, the monotony, which must\r\nhave characterized early Peloponnesian sculpture, militated against\r\nthese works being reproduced to any great degree by later copyists.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF ARGOS.\r\n\r\nThe Argive school was devoted mainly to athletic statuary. The greatest\r\nname in old Argive art is that of Ageladas or Hagelaïdas,[866] the\r\nreputed teacher of Myron and Polykleitos, who lived from the third\r\nquarter of the sixth century into the second quarter of the fifth\r\ncentury B. C. While his connection with Myron and Polykleitos is\r\nscarcely to be doubted,[867] his supposed connection with Pheidias has\r\nmade the chronology of the life of this sculptor one of the difficult\r\nproblems of the ancient history of art. A scholion on Aristophanes’\r\n_Ranae_, 504, dates the statue known as the _Herakles Alexikakos_ in\r\nthe Attic deme Melite by Hagelaïdas after the pestilence in Athens of\r\n431-430 B. C., and makes the Argive sculptor (Gelados = Hagelaïdas)\r\nthe teacher of Pheidias. As his statue of the Olympic victor Anochos\r\ncommemorated a victory won in Ol. 65 (= 520 B. C.), this late date is\r\nmanifestly impossible.[868] Furthermore, a better tradition says that\r\nHegias was the teacher of the Attic master.[869] Furtwaengler’s attempt\r\nto show that these two divergent traditions were really in accord,\r\nby the assumption that Hegias was the pupil of Hagelaïdas and that\r\nhis art came from the latter—thus explaining certain similarities in\r\nthe work of Hagelaïdas and Pheidias,—does not solve the problem.[870]\r\nAs the scholion is based on a good tradition,[871] the best solution\r\nof the difficulty is that of Kalkmann[872] and others, that the\r\n_Alexikakos_ was the work of a younger Hagelaïdas, the grandson of the\r\nfamous master, by the intermediate Argeiadas. For a lower limit to the\r\nactivity of Hagelaïdas there seems to be no good reason for distrusting\r\nthe evidence that he made a bronze _Zeus_ for the Messenians to be\r\nset up at Naupaktos, whither they moved in 455 B. C.[873] This makes\r\nquite possible a period of collaboration of four or five years at least\r\nbetween Polykleitos and Hagelaïdas.\r\n\r\nPausanias mentions the monuments of three victors at Olympia by\r\nHagelaïdas: the statues of the pancratiast Timasitheos of Delphi, who\r\nwon two victories some time between Ols. (?) 65 and 67 (520 and 512 B.\r\nC.);[874] of the runner Anochos of Tarentum, who won in the stade- and\r\ndouble-race in Ols. 65 and (?) 66 (= 520 and 516 B. C.);[875] and the\r\nchariot-group of Kleosthenes of Epidamnos, who won in Ol. 66 (= 516 B.\r\nC.).[876]\r\n\r\nNone of the works of Hagelaïdas at Olympia or elsewhere is known.\r\nMessenian coins of the fourth century B. C. show the motives of two of\r\nhis statues, that of his _Zeus Ithomatas_ just mentioned as being made\r\nfor the Messenians,[877] and the beardless _Zeus_ παῖς at Aigion.[878]\r\nHowever, we infer the characteristics of his style from the bronze\r\nstatuette in Berlin which was found at Ligourió near Epidauros (Fig.\r\n16).[879] This is undoubtedly an Argive work contemporary with the\r\nlater period of Hagelaïdas. Furtwaengler and Frost are right in looking\r\nupon it as showing the prototype of the canon of Polykleitos. Though\r\ntoo small to count as a characteristic work of the early Argive school,\r\nit shows us that the style of that school was a short and stocky type,\r\nsimilar to Aeginetan works, only somewhat fleshier and heavier. The\r\nstraight mouth and heavy chin, the treatment of the eyelids, and the\r\nclumsy limbs are all archaic features to be expected in the period\r\npreceding Polykleitos. The modeling is carefully executed, showing a\r\nknowledge of anatomy. If such excellence is found in a statuette, we\r\ncan form some idea of the perfection of a statue by the master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Bronze Statuette, from Ligourió. Museum of\r\nBerlin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 9\r\n\r\nStatue of an Athlete, by Stephanos. Villa Albani, Rome.]\r\n\r\nThe bronze _Apollo_ from Pompeii now in the Naples Museum,[880] with\r\nmarble replicas in Mantua and Paris,[881] shows us how Hagelaïdas\r\ntreated a god type, while the statue of an athlete by Stephanos will\r\ngive us some idea of how he treated his victor statues, as it seems\r\nto have been modeled after an athlete statue of the early fifth\r\ncentury B. C., perhaps after a work by some pupil of the master.\r\nStephanos belonged to the school of Pasiteles, a group of sculptors\r\nflourishing at Rome at the end of the Republic and the beginning of\r\nthe Empire. They devoted themselves to the reproduction of early\r\nfifth-century statues. They were not ordinary copyists, for their works\r\nshow individual mannerisms and a system of proportions foreign to the\r\noriginals. Thus their statues have the square shoulders of the Argive\r\nschool, but the slim bodies and slender legs of the period of Lysippos\r\nand his scholars. Apart from such mannerisms, then, in the male figure\r\nsigned _Stephanos, pupil of Pasiteles_, in the Villa Albani in Rome\r\n(Pl. 9),[882] which reappears in a very similar statue in groups\r\ncombined with a female figure of related style,[883] or with another\r\nmale figure,[884] we may see a copy of a bronze original of the Argive\r\nschool before Polykleitos. The standing motive and the body forms\r\nare the same in both the Mantuan _Apollo_ and the Stephanos figure,\r\nalthough the former is more developed and the head type is different in\r\nboth; this shows that the two, while displaying the same basic ideal,\r\nwere not works of the same master.[885] As the statue by Stephanos has\r\na fillet around the hair, it may well represent an ideal athlete, who\r\nin the original held an aryballos or similar palæstra attribute in\r\nthe raised left hand. It is interesting to compare the copies of this\r\ngroup with those of another representing mother and son, the work of\r\nMenelaos, the pupil of Stephanos, which, though transferred from Greek\r\nto Roman taste in respect of drapery and forms, is merely a variation\r\nof the same theme without any heroic traits.[886]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Hagelaïdas can be easily traced in other schools of\r\nart, especially in the Attic School and in the sculptures of the temple\r\nof Zeus at Olympia, whether these latter be Peloponnesian in origin or\r\nnot. It will be convenient in this connection to discuss briefly the\r\nstyle of these important sculptures, which we have already mentioned\r\nseveral times. The statement of Pausanias,[887] that the sculptors of\r\nthe East and West Gables were Paionios of Mende in Thrace and Alkamenes\r\nrespectively—the latter being known as the pupil of Pheidias[888]—was\r\nnot doubted until the discovery of the Olympia sculptures.[889] Then\r\ndoubts arose both on chronological and stylistic grounds, and now only\r\na few archæologists would maintain that either artist had anything\r\nto do with these groups. The style of the two gables (as well as that\r\nof the metopes) is so similar that many have assigned them to one and\r\nthe same artist.[890] They have been referred to many schools from\r\nIonia to Sicily, even including a local Elean one. Thus Brunn assigned\r\nthem to a North Greek-Thracian school; Flasch[891] and (more recently)\r\nJoubin[892] to the Attic; Kekulé[893] and Friedrichs-Wolters[894] to a\r\nWest Greek (Sicilian) one, because of their similarity to the metopes\r\nof temple E at Selinos; Furtwaengler[895] to an Ionic one (Parian\r\nmasters). Most scholars, however, including K. Lange,[896] Treu,[897]\r\nStudniczka,[898] Collignon,[899] and Overbeck,[900] have referred them\r\nto Peloponnesian sculptors.[901]\r\n\r\nTo return to the art of Hagelaïdas: if we assume that the Ligourió\r\nbronze comes from the school of that Argive master certain conclusions\r\nmust be drawn. The figure is archaic, but does not have the archaic\r\nsmile. In Athens at the end of the archaic period there was a reaction\r\nagainst this smile, and doubtless the Athenian artists were strongly\r\ninfluenced by Argive models. Thus an archaic bronze head of a youth,\r\nfound on the Akropolis and dating from about 480 B. C., shows a\r\nserious mouth, a strong chin, heavy upper eyelids, and finely worked\r\nhair, characteristics which we found in the Ligourió statuette. These\r\ntraits show that the statuette and the head were the forerunners of\r\nthe _Apollo_ of the West Gable at Olympia. So finished a bronze as\r\nthis one from the Akropolis, at the beginning of the fifth century B.\r\nC., has inclined Richardson to look upon it as “not improbably a work\r\nof Hagelaïdas,”[902] though here again Furtwaengler would ascribe it\r\nto Hegias.[903] The Parian marble statue of an ephebe found on the\r\nAkropolis (Fig. 17)[904]—one of the most beautiful recovered during\r\nthe excavations there—shows the same Argive influence. This statue\r\nis chronologically the first masterpiece, thus far recovered, which\r\nmarks the break with archaism by having its head turned slightly to\r\none side.[905] It has the same pose as the _Athlete_ by Stephanos and\r\nprobably represents a palæstra victor. The head, with its heavy chin,\r\nand the muscular body strikingly resemble the _Harmodios_ (Fig. 32),\r\nwhich has led Furtwaengler and others to ascribe it to Kritios or his\r\nschool.[906] At the same time a similarity is seen between this head\r\nand that of the _Apollo_ of the West Gable at Olympia, and so with\r\nBulle and others we ascribe it to the Argive school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Statue of an Ephebe, from the Akropolis.\r\nAkropolis Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nOne of the female statues (_Korai_) found on the Akropolis, and\r\napproximately of the same date as the ephebe, viz, the fragmentary\r\none consisting of head and bust and known popularly as _la petite\r\nboudeuse_, shows the same revolt against Ionism.[907] In many respects\r\nthis statue is very different from most of the other Akropolis _Korai_.\r\nThe eyes are not yet set back naturally, but the appearance of depth\r\nis attained by thickening the eyelids, quite in contrast with the\r\nmodeling of the eyeball in most of the other statues. The corners of\r\nthe mouth turn down, which gives it the appearance of pouting. This\r\nstatue is also our first example in sculpture of the so-called Greek\r\nprofile—the nose continuing the line of the forehead. The same Argive\r\ninfluence in Athenian art is also discernible in the Parian marble\r\nhead of an athlete with traces of yellow in the hair (Fig. 18),[908]\r\nwhich may be dated a little later than the Akropolis ephebe—about\r\n470 B. C. Because of its resemblance to the _Apollo_ of Olympia,\r\nits Attic-Peloponnesian origin seems clear.[909] Its expression is\r\ncomparable with that of the _Kore_ just discussed—as it has the same\r\nmouth, eyes, and nose, both monuments showing the reaction against the\r\narchaic smile, which characterized the Ionian period of Attic art.\r\nThis same Ionic reaction also may be seen in the bronze statuette of a\r\ndiskobolos in the Metropolitan Museum (Fig. 46),[910] which resembles\r\nin style that of the _Tyrannicides_, but shows also Argive traits.\r\nThese Argive traits, small head and slender limbs, are easily seen by\r\ncomparing this statuette with the Ligourió bronze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Head of an Ephebe, from the Akropolis.\r\nAkropolis Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the monumental group of the hoplite victor\r\nDamaretos and of the pentathlete Theopompos, which was made about 500\r\nB. C. by the Argive sculptors Chrysothemis and Eutelidas.[911] These\r\nartists were known to later antiquity only by the epigram inscribed on\r\nthe base of this monument at Olympia, and the probable dates of the two\r\nvictories of Theopompos, Ols. (?) 69 and 70 (= 504 and 500 B. C.), show\r\nthat they were contemporaries of Hagelaïdas, and not, as formerly was\r\nbelieved, the forerunners of his school.[912]\r\n\r\nPolykleitos, a Sikyonian by birth,[913] migrated early to Argos to\r\nbecome the pupil of Hagelaïdas, and became the great master of the\r\nArgive school in the next generation after him. We have four statues by\r\nhim at Olympia. His earliest work probably was the statue of the boxer\r\nKyniskos of Mantinea, who won in Ol. (?) 80 (= 460 B. C.); he made\r\nthe statues of the Elean pentathlete Pythokles and of the Epidamnian\r\nboxer Aristion, both of whom won their victories in Ol. 82 (= 452 B.\r\nC.); and lastly he made the statue of the boy boxer Thersilochos from\r\nKerkyra, who won in Ol. (?) 87 (= 432 B. C.)[914] The footprints on the\r\nthree recovered bases of the statues of the first three show that all\r\nwere represented at rest. Of Patrokles, the brother of Polykleitos,\r\nPausanias mentions no statues at Olympia, though Pliny says that he\r\nmade athlete statues.[915] Of Naukydes,[916] the nephew or brother\r\nof Polykleitos, we have record of three athlete statues at Olympia:\r\nthose of the wrestlers Cheimon of Argos, who won in Ol. 83 (= 448\r\nB. C.), and Baukis of Trœzen, who won some time between Ols. (?)\r\n85 and 90 (= 440 and 420 B. C.); also one of the boxer Eukles of\r\nRhodes, who won some time between Ols. 90 and 93 (= 420 and 408 B.\r\nC.).[917] A contemporary of Naukydes was the sculptor Phradmon, who,\r\naccording to Pliny, was a contemporary of Polykleitos;[918] he made\r\nthe statue of the boy wrestler Amertas of Elis, who won a victory some\r\ntime between Ols. 84 and 90 (= 444 and 420 B. C.).[919] In the next\r\ncentury, Polykleitos Minor, the grandson or grandnephew of the great\r\nPolykleitos, and the pupil of Naukydes,[920] had three statues at\r\nOlympia: those of the boy boxer Antipatros of Miletos, whose victory is\r\ngiven by Africanus as Ol. 98 (= 388 B. C.); of the two boy wrestlers\r\nAgenor of Thebes, who won some time between Ols. 93 and 103 (= 408\r\nand 368 B. C.), and Xenokles of Mainalos, who won some time between\r\nOls. 94 and 100 (= 404 and 380 B. C.).[921] The inscribed base of the\r\nlatter has been recovered and the footprints show that the statue was\r\nrepresented at rest, the body resting equally on both feet, the left\r\nslightly advanced. Andreas, a second-century B. C. Argive sculptor,\r\nmade a statue at Olympia of the boy wrestler Lysippos of Elis, who won\r\nsome time between Ols. 149 and 157 (= 184 and 152 B. C.).[922]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF SIKYON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Bronze Statuette of Apollo, found in the Sea off\r\nPiombino. Louvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe Sikyonian school of bronze founders was closely affiliated with the\r\none at Argos. Early in the archaic period the brothers Dipoinos and\r\nSkyllis, sons or pupils of the mythical Daidalos of Crete, migrated to\r\nSikyon.[923] A generation later another Cretan sculptor, Aristokles,\r\nfounded there an artist family which lasted through seven or eight\r\ngenerations.[924] His two grandsons Aristokles and Kanachos are known\r\nto have collaborated with Hagelaïdas on a group of three Muses.[925]\r\nMany have seen in the small bronze found in the sea off Piombino,\r\nTuscany, and now in the Louvre (Fig. 19),[926] a copy of the _Apollo\r\nPhilesios_, the best-known work of Kanachos. This gem of the bronze\r\nart, in true archaic style, may very well represent the _Apollo_,\r\nwhich, according to the description of Pliny[927] and the evidence of\r\nMilesian copper coins of all periods,[928] had as attributes a\r\nfawn in the outstretched right hand and a bow in the left. However,\r\nOverbeck,[929] followed by von Mach, believes that it is not a copy\r\nof Kanachos’ _Apollo_, but merely represents a boy assisting at a\r\nsacrifice, and that the original held a cup in the left hand and a\r\nsaucer in the right. In any case the statuette is too inaccurate to\r\ngive us more than the pose of the _Apollo_ of Kanachos, even if it\r\nwere proved to be a copy. It may be merely a reproduction of the\r\nmythological type of Apollo, which the artist himself followed, and\r\nso we can not say definitely to what school it belongs. The Payne\r\nKnight bronze in the British Museum,[930] which holds a tiny fawn in\r\nthe right hand, the bow originally in the left hand being lost, has\r\nbetter pretensions, perhaps, to be a copy of the _Apollo_. Another\r\narchaic half life-size bronze, formerly in the Palazzo Sciarra,[931]\r\nis of a similar type, though its style is different. Another bronze\r\nstatuette from Naxos, now in Berlin,[932] shows the same position of\r\nthe hands, but has an aryballos or pomegranate in the right hand. We\r\nhave already classed it as an example of the conversion of an original\r\ngod-type into that of a victor. We might also mention the mutilated\r\ntorso found by Holleaux at the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios in Bœotia\r\n(Fig. 12, right), which has a similar pose to that of the statuette\r\nfrom Piombino, and whose hair technique shows that it is an imitation\r\nof a bronze work.[933] However, as we shall see later, it may be rather\r\nrepresentative of the Aeginetan school of sculptors. All these works\r\nmay tell us of the general character of the _Apollo_, but little of its\r\nstyle.[934]\r\n\r\nNo athlete statue by Aristokles or his brother Kanachos is known\r\nto have stood at Olympia. That the latter actually made victor\r\nstatues, however, is proved by Pliny’s statement (_l. c._) that he\r\nmade _celetizontas pueros_. Of the later Sikyonian school we have\r\ntwenty-seven statues of victors made by eleven different sculptors,\r\nwhose dates range from near the end of the fourth down into the third\r\ncentury B. C., of whom we shall give a chronological list. Alypos, the\r\npupil of the Argive Naukydes, had four statues at Olympia: those of the\r\nwrestler Symmachos of Elis, of the boy boxer Neolaïdas of Pheneus, of\r\nthe boy wrestler Archedamos of Elis, and of the boy and man wrestler\r\nEuthymenes of Mainalos, all of whom must have won their victories some\r\ntime between Ols. 94 and 104 (= 404 and 364 B. C.).[935] Kanachos, the\r\nYounger, made one statue, that of the boy boxer Bykelos of Sikyon,\r\nwho won some time between Ols. 92 and 105 (= 412 and 360 B. C.).[936]\r\nOlympos made the statue of the pancratiast Xenophon of Aigion, who\r\nwon some time between Ols. 95 and 105 (= 400 and 360 B. C.).[937]\r\nThe sculptor Daidalos, the son and pupil of Patrokles, and probably\r\nthe nephew of Polykleitos, made four monuments for four victors: the\r\nequestrian group of the Elean charioteer Timon and his son Aigyptos, a\r\nvictor in horse-racing, and statues of the Elean wrestler Aristodemos\r\nand the stade-runner Eupolemos. Their victories fell between Ols. 96\r\nand 103 (= 396 and 368 B. C.).[938] Damokritos made the statue of the\r\nElean boy boxer Hippos, who won between Ols. 96 and 107 (= 396 and\r\n352 B. C.).[939] Kleon had five statues credited to him, all but one\r\nbeing of boy victors: those of the boy runner Deinolochos of Elis,\r\nthe pentathlete Hysmon of Elis, the two boy boxers Kritodamos, and of\r\nAlketos of Kleitor, and of the boy runner Lykinos of Heraia. Their\r\nvictories fell between Ols. 94 and 103 (= 404 and 368 B. C.).[940] The\r\ngreat Lysippos had the same number of victor statues as Kleon, and also\r\ntwo honor statues at Olympia: those of the equestrian victor Troilos\r\nof Elis, of the Akarnanian pancratiast Philandridas, of the wrestler\r\nCheilon of Patrai, of the pancratiast Polydamas of Skotoussa, and of\r\nthe hoplite-runner Kallikrates. Their victories occurred between Ols.\r\n102 and 115 (= 372 and 320 B. C.).[941] The son of Lysippos, Daïppos,\r\nmade two statues, one for the Elean boy boxer Kallon and the other for\r\nthe Elean Nikandros, who won the double foot-race. Their victories fell\r\nwithin the activity of the sculptor, Ols. 115 and 125 (= 320 and 280 B.\r\nC.).[942] Daitondas made the statue of the Elean boy boxer Theotimos,\r\nwho won his victory some time between Ols. 116 and 120 (= 316 and 300\r\nB. C.).[943] Eutychides, the most famous pupil of Lysippos, famed\r\nalike as a bronze founder, statuary, and painter, carved the statue\r\nof the boy runner Timosthenes of Elis, who won some time between Ols.\r\n115 and 125 (= 320 and 280 B. C.).[944] Pliny gives Ol. 121 (= 296 B.\r\nC.) as the _floruit_ of this sculptor, which was probably the date of\r\nthe erection of his most famous work, the colossal bronze _Tyche_,\r\nas tutelary deity of the city of Antioch on the Orontes, which was\r\nfounded by Seleukos I in Ol. 119.3 (= 302 B. C.).[945] This shows that\r\nEutychides was already by that date a famed sculptor, having begun his\r\ncareer by 330-320 B. C. Kantharos, the pupil of Eutychides, made the\r\nstatues of the two boy wrestlers Kratinos of Aigira and Alexinikos of\r\nElis, who won their victories some time between Ols. 120 and 130 (= 300\r\nand 260 B. C.).[946]\r\n\r\n\r\nÆGINETAN SCULPTORS.\r\n\r\nWe have but little left of the prominent early Aeginetan school of\r\nbronze sculptors. Of Kallon, the earliest historical sculptor of the\r\nschool, the reputed pupil of Tektaios and Angelion (who in turn were\r\nthe pupils of Dipoinos and Skyllis), we have only literary evidence. He\r\nwas typical of archaic severity just prior to the era of transition,\r\nand therefore should be compared with Hegias of Athens and Kanachos of\r\nSikyon. For Onatas, the most famous of the Aeginetan sculptors, whose\r\n_floruit_ was in the first half of the fifth century B. C., we have\r\nevidence of many monuments at Olympia. Besides the colossal _Herakles_\r\ndedicated by the Thasians,[947] a _Hermes_ dedicated by the people\r\nof Pheneus,[948] and a large group of nine statues of Greek heroes\r\nstanding on a curved base faced by a statue of Nestor on another, the\r\ngroup being dedicated by the Achaians,[949] he made a chariot and\r\ncharioteer to commemorate the victory of Hiero of Syracuse at Olympia\r\nin 468 B. C., for which monument Kalamis furnished two horses.[950]\r\nGlaukias made a bronze chariot for Hiero’s brother Gelo of Gela, who\r\nlater became tyrant of Syracuse, and who won a chariot victory in\r\nOl. 73 (= 488 B. C.).[951] This sculptor also excelled in fashioning\r\nstatues of boxers and pancratiasts, making the monuments of the boxers\r\nPhilon of Kerkyra and Glaukos of Karystos, and that of the renowned\r\nboxer and pancratiast Theagenes of Thasos.[952] The statue of Glaukos\r\nwas represented in the schema of one “sparring” (σκιαμαχῶν),[953] and\r\nso was in movement and not at rest. We have athlete statues by three\r\nother Aeginetan sculptors at Olympia. Thus Ptolichos, the pupil of the\r\nSikyonian Aristokles, set up statues of the Aeginetan boy wrestler\r\nTheognetos, who won in Ol. 76 (= 476 B. C.), and of the boy boxer\r\nEpikradios of Mantinea, who won between Ols. (?) 72 and 74 (= 492 and\r\n484 B. C.);[954] Serambos made the statue of the boy boxer Agiadas of\r\nElis, who won between Ols. (?) 72 and 74;[955] Philotimos made the\r\nhorse for the horse-racing victory of Xenombrotos of Kos, who won in\r\nOl. (?) 83 (= 448 B. C.).[956] All of these sculptors appear to have\r\nused bronze exclusively, and their art, though independent, showed a\r\nbias toward Peloponnesian work. There are few examples left of this\r\nart. The bronze head of a bearded warrior or hoplite victor found on\r\nthe Akropolis, if we are justified in classing it as Aeginetan and not\r\nAttic, shows the excellence which we associate with this school.[957]\r\nThe delicate execution of its hair and beard, as well as the strength\r\nand precision of this head, makes it not unworthy of being ascribed\r\nto one of the best artists of the school, perhaps to Onatas himself.\r\nThe beardless bronze head discovered in 1756 in the villa of the Pisos\r\nin Herculaneum, now in Naples, has also been assigned to Onatas, as\r\nits features are similar to those of the one under discussion.[958]\r\nThe Tux bronze statuette of a hoplitodrome, to be discussed in Ch. IV\r\n(Fig. 42), has also been assigned to an Aeginetan master.[959] The\r\nmarble statue known as the _Strangford Apollo_ in the British Museum,\r\nalready mentioned (Fig. 14),[960] may show the characteristics of the\r\nearly school in marble, though it is impossible to say whether it is\r\na copy of a bronze original or a minor work in stone under Aeginetan\r\ninfluence. The smaller “Apollo” from Mount Ptoion, already discussed\r\n(Fig. 13, right),[961] appears to show in exaggerated form the same\r\nAeginetan traits. However, we get out best notion of Aeginetan work\r\nin marble from the gable statues in the Munich Museum, representing\r\nHomeric warriors fighting, which adorned the temple of Aphaia in the\r\nnortheastern corner of the island. Their importance in this connection\r\ncalls for a brief account of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Figure, from the East Pediment of the Temple on\r\nAegina. Glyptothek, Munich.]\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of these groups by an international party of\r\nEnglishmen and Germans in 1811, and their restoration soon after their\r\narrival in Munich by the sculptor Thorwaldsen, many new fragments\r\nhave been discovered by Furtwaengler during his excavations of\r\nthe temple site in 1901, and have been incorporated into the\r\nexisting figures in the Glyptothek. His reconstruction, though not\r\ndefinitive, is more in accord with artistic probability than any that\r\npreceded.[962] As we should expect from the athletic tradition of the\r\nAeginetan school of sculpture just outlined, these sculptures represent\r\nfinely trained nude athletes, whose modeling shows great observation of\r\nnature, especially in the treatment of muscles and veins. In fact it\r\nhas been truly said that anatomical knowledge was never expressed again\r\nin Greek art so simply and naturally. The figures, without any excess\r\nof flesh, are slightly under life-size, short and stocky—shoulders\r\nsquare, but the waists slender and the legs long in proportion to the\r\nbodies—and withal are very compact and full of strength. The figures\r\nof the two pediments differ slightly, the eastern being more developed\r\nthan the western. Brunn, long ago, arguing from the stele of Aristion,\r\nwhich then was the best example extant of archaic Attic art, showed\r\nhow that art was characterized by grace and dignity of effect, while\r\nAeginetan art was characterized by a finer study of nature. This\r\ngeneralization is no longer a matter of inference, but of knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Two Figures, from the West Pediment of the\r\nTemple on Aegina. Glyptothek, Munich.]\r\n\r\nThese groups represent the highest period of Aeginetan art. They\r\nhave been dated anywhere from the end of the sixth century B. C.\r\ndown to a period after the battle of Salamis.[963] Probably a date\r\njust after that battle is correct, as Aeginetans won prizes of valor\r\nthere.[964] Any attempt to assign them to this or that artist is merely\r\nconjectural. The general similarity in subject to that of the Delphi\r\ngroup by Onatas, which represented the death in battle of Opis, the\r\nking of the barbarian Iapygians, at the hands of the Tarentines,[965]\r\nand the group at Olympia already mentioned as representing a Trojan\r\nsubject, led earlier scholars to assign the slightly more advanced\r\nstatues of the East Pediment to Onatas and the more archaic ones of\r\nthe West Pediment to Kallon. But we know both these sculptors only as\r\nbronze workers. The violent action of some of the figures reminds us\r\nat once of Pausanias’ description of the statue of the boxer Glaukos\r\nby the sculptor Glaukias, which we have already mentioned. But on\r\nthe whole, though they are violent, the slight proportions of these\r\nathletic figures do not fit the appearance of boxers and pancratiasts,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, formed the staple of Aeginetan sculptors, but\r\nrather those of runners. We see a good wrestler in the _Snatcher_ of\r\nthe East Gable (Fig. 20),[966] and the corresponding figure in the\r\nright half of the same gable.[967] The _Champion_ of the West gable\r\n(Fig. 21, left),[968] of the finest Parian marble, represented as\r\nlunging forward, pressing on the enemy armed with helm, spear, and\r\nshield, would pass as a good example of a hoplitodrome, far freer and\r\nmore individual than the warrior from Dodona.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTIC SCULPTORS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Archaic Marble Head of a Youth. Jakobsen\r\nCollection, Ny-Carlsberg Museum, Copenhagen.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the Persian sack of the Athenian Akropolis in 480 and 479\r\nB. C., and the subsequent burial of works of art there and their\r\nrediscovery by the excavations of 1885-1889, we know more of archaic\r\nAttic sculpture (600-480 B. C.) than of any other early school.[969]\r\nWe have already mentioned certain Attic works which show the influence\r\nof the severer Argive school—_la petite boudeuse_, the head of the\r\nyellow-haired ephebe (Fig. 18), the Akropolis athlete statue (Fig. 17),\r\netc.—which was prominent at the beginning of the fifth century B. C.,\r\nworks which can be attributed to Hegias, Kritios, and their associates.\r\nThey illustrate the reaction against Ionic taste, an influence which\r\ncame from Asia Minor and the islands, especially after the fall of the\r\nLydian Empire of Crœsus, and which for a time submerged native Attic\r\nart. This Ionic art was characterized by great technical ability, and\r\nby rich draperies and decorative effect. The archaic smile was its\r\nspecial feature. Ionism is best represented by some of the Akropolis\r\n_Korai_.[970] In athletic art we see Ionism at its flood tide in\r\nthe Rampin head found in Athens in 1877, now in the Louvre, which\r\ncorresponds in style with some of the earlier female statues of the\r\nAkropolis.[971] This head has a more elaborate frisure than any of the\r\nfemale heads and, in fact, the elaborate treatment of the hair of the\r\ncrown and forehead is more suitable to a female than a male statue.\r\nThe beard is carefully plaited, while traces of red seem to show that\r\nthe mustache was painted on. Similar traces of color appear on the\r\nbeard and hair. The smiling mouth, high ears, and almond eyes recall\r\nmany archaic works, but especially the _Apollo of Tenea_ (Pl. 8A). The\r\ngarland of oak leaves above the frisure of the forehead may suggest\r\na victor,[972] or perhaps a priest or assistant on some religious\r\nembassy.[973] The turning of the neck—as in the ephebe statue of the\r\nAkropolis (Fig. 17)—shows a break at this early time with archaism.\r\nAnother work illustrating Ionism is the fragment of a grave-stele\r\nfound near the Dipylon gate in 1873 and dating from the second half\r\nof the sixth century B. C.[974] It represents the head of an athlete\r\nin profile, the youth holding a diskos in his left hand, so placed\r\nthat his head is projected upon it in relief as on a nimbus. The top\r\nof the head is broken off, but we see the usual archaic features in\r\nthe face—the almond-shaped eye (in profile), big nose with knob-like\r\nnostrils, thick lips with the archaic smile, retreating chin and\r\nforehead, and high ear with a huge lobe. The neck and chin, however,\r\nare full of grace and strength, as is also the slender thumb outlined\r\nagainst the diskos. As the stele broadens downward,[975] the figure\r\nappears to have been represented with the feet apart, and so may have\r\nrepresented a palæstra diskobolos on parade,[976] and is, therefore,\r\nour earliest representation of such an athlete. A similar dress-parade\r\npose is seen on the stele of Aristion in the National Museum at Athens,\r\nthe work of the sculptor Aristokles, which represents a warrior with\r\na spear in the left hand.[977] Another torso of an ephebe in the\r\nAkropolis Museum represents Ionic work from Paros.[978] Another head,\r\nthe so-called Rayet head in the Jakobsen collection in Copenhagen, one\r\nof the most remarkable specimens of Greek archaic art[979] (Fig. 22),\r\nsomewhat later in date than the Rampin head, represents quite a different\r\ntendency in Attic art. While the Rampin head represents Ionic\r\ninfluence, this head represents pure Attic work untrammeled by foreign\r\ninfluence, a true development of the old Attic sculpture in _poros_,\r\nthe best examples of which are to be found in the decorative sculptures\r\nof the Old Temple of Athena on the Akropolis, enlarged by the\r\nPeisistratidai. Comparing it with the head of the _Athena_ of the gable\r\nof that temple,[980] we see great similarity in the simple execution\r\nand reserve in the treatment of details—characteristics of pure Attic\r\nsculpture—especially in the deep lines on either side of the mouth in\r\nthe Jakobsen head. The hair is pictorially treated like a cap, traces\r\nof red appearing on it as well as on the lips and eyes. The Copenhagen\r\nand Rampin heads, together with the famous portrait head in the old\r\nSabouroff collection,[981] and the head of a woman in the Louvre,[982]\r\nform our best examples of old Attic art outside of the museums of\r\nAthens.[983] The swollen ears of the Jakobsen head show that it is from\r\nthe funerary statue of a victor, perhaps a boxer. Furtwaengler wrongly\r\nclassed it as a portrait head.[984] A much discussed Attic work is the\r\narchaic relief of a charioteer in the Akropolis Museum (Fig. 63).[985]\r\nThis was formerly thought (_e. g._, by Schrader) to be a block from the\r\nlater Ionic frieze of the old Hekatompedon which many believe survived\r\nthe Persian sack, but it is more likely a part of a frieze belonging\r\nto a small shrine or altar. It represents a draped person entering a\r\ntwo-horse chariot with the left foot, the hands outstretched to hold\r\nthe reins, the head and body leaning forward. Because of the _krobylos_\r\ntreatment of the hair, fitted for both sexes, and the long flowing\r\nrobe, the sex has been needlessly doubted, some calling it an Apollo or\r\na mortal charioteer, others an Athena or a Nike, even though the line\r\nof the breast, so far as it is visible, shows no fullness, and the long\r\nchiton is common in representations of male charioteers.[986] However,\r\nfor the appreciation of the relief it is of no consequence whether the\r\nfigure is male or female. It may be merely a dedicatory offering of\r\na Panathenaic victor in chariot racing, very possibly assimilated to\r\nthe type of Apollo,[987] as the god often appears in vase-paintings of\r\nthe same period in similar costume mounting a chariot.[988] We shall\r\ndiscuss its interpretation more fully later on.[989] While Ionism was\r\nprone to represent richly draped figures which concealed the form of\r\nthe body, we see in this relief, with its fine modeling, a suggestion\r\nof the form beneath the folds of the garment, and so, perhaps,\r\nonly another example of an Attic master rebelling against alien\r\ninfluence.[990]\r\n\r\nAt Olympia we have no names of Athenian sculptors prior to the Persian\r\nwar period. Kalamis helped Onatas with the monument of King Hiero\r\nalready mentioned. Mikon made a statue of a pancratiast, Kallias of\r\nAthens, who won in Ol. 77 (= 472 B. C.).[991] The great Myron, of whom\r\nwe shall speak at length in the next chapter, made five statues of\r\nvictors, which were erected between Ols. 77 and 84 (= 472 and 444 B.\r\nC.).[992] Only four later Athenian artists are mentioned: Silanion of\r\nthe fourth century, who made statues for three victors, whose victories\r\nranged from Ols. 102 to 114 (= 372 to 324 B. C.);[993] Polykles the\r\nElder, who made the statue of the boy pancratiast Amyntas of Eresos,\r\nwho won in Ol. (?) 146 (= 196 B. C.);[994] Timarchides and Timokles,\r\nthe sons of Polykles, who in common made the statue of the boxer\r\nAgesarchos of Tritaia in Achaia, who won in Ol. (?) 143 (= 208 B.\r\nC.)[995]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MOTIVES OF STATUES AT REST.\r\n\r\nThe victor represented as standing at rest was often characterized\r\nby general motives, such as praying, anointing or scraping himself,\r\noffering libations, and the like. We shall now consider such motives in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\nADORATION AND PRAYER.\r\n\r\nPrayer was a common motive represented in votive monuments. Pliny\r\nmentions many such works by Greek sculptors.[996] The custom of\r\nraising the arms in prayer is found all through Greek literature,\r\nfrom Homer down.[997] Pausanias says that the people of Akragas made\r\nan offering in the form of bronze statues of boys placed on the walls\r\nof the Altis, προτείνοντάς τε τὰς δεξιὰς καὶ εἰκασμένους εὐχομένοις\r\nτῷ θεῷ, these statues being the work of Kalamis.[998] In the Athenian\r\nAsklepieion there were many τύποι καταμακτοὶ πρὸς πινακίῳ, among which\r\nwere representations of men and women in the praying attitude.[999]\r\nThe motive was used at Olympia in victor statues, representing the\r\nvictor as raising the hand in prayer to invoke victory.[1000] The\r\nstatue of the wrestler Milo, already discussed at length, shows that\r\nthis motive was employed at Olympia in the improved “Apollo” type in\r\nthe second half of the sixth century B. C.[1001] From the next century\r\nwe may cite the statue of the Spartan chariot victor Anaxandros, which\r\nwas represented as “praying to the god,”[1002] and the statues of the\r\nRhodian boxers Diagoras and Akousilaos, as we learn from a scholion on\r\nPindar,[1003] which is based on a fragment of Aristotle[1004] and on\r\none of Apollas.[1005] Of the statue of Diagoras it says: τὴν δεξιὰν\r\nἀνατείνων χεῖρα, τὴν δὲ ἀριστερὰν εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἐπικλίνων; of that of\r\nAkousilaos: τῇ μὲν ἀριστερᾷ ἱμάντα ἔχων πυκτινόν, τὴν δὲ δεξιὰν\r\nὡς πρὸς προσευχὴν ἀνατείνων.[1006] The bronze statue from Athens, now\r\nin the Antiquarium, Berlin,[1007] which represents a nude boy with the\r\nright hand raised as if in prayer and the left lowered and holding a\r\nleaping-weight—therefore a pentathlete—seems to correspond with this\r\ndescription of the statue of Akousilaos. The same motive may have been\r\nused in the statue of the chariot victress Kyniska, a princess of\r\nSparta, whose statue along with that of her charioteer and the chariot\r\nwas the work of the sculptor Apellas.[1008] This is the interpretation\r\nof Furtwaengler,[1009] based on a passage in Pliny, which mentions\r\nstatues of _adornantes se feminas_[1010] by Apellas, which he reads\r\n_adorantes feminas_. However, _adornantes_ may be right, for in another\r\npassage, Pliny speaks of Praxiteles’ statue of a ψελιουμένη, _i. e._,\r\nof a woman clasping a bracelet on her arm.[1011] Two notable bronze\r\nstatues will illustrate this motive of Olympic victor statues. The\r\nstatue found in 1502 at Zellfeld in Carinthia, now in Vienna,[1012] has\r\nbeen interpreted both as a Hermes Logios and a votive statue in the\r\nattitude of prayer,[1013] which latter interpretation the inscription\r\non the leg, giving a list of dedications,[1014] favors. However,\r\nFurtwaengler believes it a free imitation of an Argive victor statue,\r\nthough not in the Polykleitan style. Because of its similarity to\r\nthe _Idolino_ (Pl. 14), he has ascribed its original to the sculptor\r\nPatrokles. From technical considerations he believes it is not a Greek\r\noriginal dedicated by Romans of a later period, but a Roman work (after\r\nPatrokles) of the period of the inscription.[1015] The bronze statue of\r\nthe _Praying Boy_ in Berlin[1016] (Pl. 10) is one of our most beautiful\r\nGreek bronzes and comes from the circle of Lysippos.[1017] We now know\r\nthat the uplifted arms of this statue, in which most scholars saw the\r\nGreek attitude of prayer, are restorations which were probably made in\r\nthe time of Louis XIV, when the statue was in France. Of the original\r\nmotive we only can say that the action of the shoulders shows that\r\nboth arms were raised, but we do not know how far, or the position of\r\nthe hands. Monumental evidence shows that the hands in prayer should\r\nhave the palms turned away from the face instead of upwards, as in\r\nthe present statue, since the Greek position was the outgrowth of an\r\nold apotropaic gesture, _i. e._, one directed against an evil spirit.\r\nMau’s idea[1018] that the figure represented a player catching a\r\nball is certainly inconsistent with the calm attitude of the statue.\r\nFurtwaengler rejected it,[1019] and he has restored the arms and hands\r\non the basis of a Berlin gem[1020] and an _ex voto_ relief found by\r\nthe French excavators at Nemea in 1884.[1021] On this relief a youth\r\ncrowned with a woolen fillet is represented. On both relief and gem\r\nthe figures are in the same attitude, the arms raised over the head\r\n_manibus supinis_, which confirms the restoration of the Berlin statue.\r\nMany other monuments give the more usual attitude of prayer, not as\r\nin the relief and gem discussed, but with only one hand extended as\r\nhigh as the breast. Older writers thought that such monuments did not\r\nrepresent the gesture of adoration, but one of _adlocutio_,[1022] an\r\nopinion disproved by Pausanias’ statement about the bronze statues of\r\nthe Akragantines at Olympia, already mentioned. We may cite a relief\r\nfrom Kleitor, now in Berlin,[1023] and a fine one of the fourth century\r\nB. C. from Lamia (?),[1024] as well as a red-figured Etruscan stamnos\r\nin Vienna representing, probably, Ajax praying before committing\r\nsuicide.[1025] We shall mention also two little statuettes in New York\r\nwhich represent youths in the praying attitude.[1026] The first, dating\r\nfrom the second half of the fifth century B. C., and showing\r\nPolykleitan influence, represents a nude youth standing erect with the\r\nforearms bent, showing that the two hands were extended in prayer. The\r\nsecond, which dates from the first half of the fifth century B. C.\r\n(after the date of the Myronian _Diskobolos_), represents a nude youth\r\nstanding with the right hand raised to the lips in an attitude usual in\r\nsaluting a divinity, while the left is by the side, with the palm to\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 10\r\n\r\nBronze Statue of the _Praying Boy_. Museum of Berlin.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANOINTING.\r\n\r\nVarious familiar motives from the everyday life of the gymnasium\r\nand palæstra were reproduced in the statues of athletes. One of the\r\ncommonest methods was to represent the victor anointing his body with\r\noil. The use of oil was indispensable in all athletic exercises,\r\nin order to make the body and limbs more supple, and especially in\r\nwrestling and the pankration, to make it difficult for one’s antagonist\r\nto get a grip.[1027] Pliny mentions a painting by Theoros, representing\r\na man _se inunguentem_,[1028] which appears to have been a votive\r\nportrait of an athlete. The motive was common in vase-paintings and\r\nstatuary. Several red-figured vases of the severe style, antedating\r\nthe statues to be considered, show from realistic representations of\r\npalæstra scenes that it was customary for athletes to hold a round\r\naryballos high in the right hand and pour oil from it into the left,\r\nwhich was placed across the body horizontally.[1029] The same motive\r\nappears with variations in statues.[1030] Thus the statue of an ephebe\r\nin Petworth House, Sussex, England,[1031] a statue, as Furtwaengler\r\nsays, to be praised more for its excellent preservation than for its\r\nworkmanship, represents an athlete, who holds a globular aryballos in\r\nhis right hand raised over the shoulder, while the left arm is held\r\nacross the abdomen. On the nearby tree-trunk are small cylindrical\r\nobjects which seem to be boxing pads. This statue, and especially its\r\nhead, have been regarded by Michaelis and Furtwaengler as unmistakably\r\nPolykleitan in style.[1032] Several other copies of original statues\r\nrepresenting athletes pouring oil have been wrongly classed as replicas\r\nof one original,[1033] though they merely have essential features\r\nalike, due chiefly to the subject. First is the famous statue in the\r\nGlyptothek known as the _Oelgiesser_ (_Oil-pourer_), a Roman copy of an\r\nAttic bronze of about the middle of the fifth century B. C. (Pl.\r\n11).[1034] Though the right arm and left hand are lost, it is clear\r\nthat the athlete held in his raised right hand an oil flask, as in\r\nthe Petworth statue.[1035] Notwithstanding that the head resembles\r\nthe Praxitelian _Hermes_,[1036] this does not show that the statue\r\nis of fourth-century origin, for its original is older; it merely\r\nshows that the art of Praxiteles was deeply rooted in that of his\r\nfifth-century predecessors. Because of its Attic affiliations, Klein\r\ntried to identify it with the Ἐγκρινόμενος of Alkamenes mentioned by\r\nPliny,[1037] by amending that title to Ἐγχριόμενος, the “Anointer.”\r\nBrunn, however, rightly saw the analogy of the body forms to Myron’s\r\n_Marsyas_,[1038] and Furtwaengler and Bulle have ascribed it to Lykios,\r\nthe son and pupil of that master, who worked about 440 B. C., the\r\napproximate date of the original of the statue. A fragmentary head in\r\nthe Boston Museum of Fine Arts (Fig. 23),[1039] formerly in private\r\npossession in England, is a copy of the same original as the Munich\r\nstatue. Its special interest is that it is not an exact copy of the\r\noriginal, as the Munich statue is, but a freer one, showing a fuller\r\nmouth, fleshier cheeks, and deeper-set eyes. While the Munich statue\r\nis the dry work of a Roman copyist of Augustus’ time, this head is by\r\na far abler Greek copyist of the second century B. C. A torso in the\r\nAlbertinum in Dresden, without a head,[1040] is similar to the\r\nMunich statue, but hardly a replica. It probably goes back to an\r\noriginal by an Attic master of the end of the fifth or beginning of\r\nthe fourth century B. C. Other under life-size statues related to this\r\ntorso show the same motive.[1041] A black-marble statue found at Porto\r\nd’Anzio in 1758, and now in the Glyptothek,[1042] has the Polykleitan\r\nstanding motive. The left arm, which is stretched out, holds an oil\r\nflask in the hand, while the right arm is lowered. The band, which\r\nthe position of the fingers shows that the right hand probably held,\r\nindicates it is the statue of a victor. A bronze statuette from South\r\nItaly, now in the British Museum,[1043] represents a nude youth holding\r\nan alabastron in his right hand, while the left has the palm open to\r\nreceive the oil. The hair fashion (κρωβύλος) seems to point to an\r\nAttic sculptor of about 470 B. C.[1044] The same motive is found on\r\nterra-cotta statuettes from Myrina,[1045] on reliefs,[1046] and on\r\ngems.[1047]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Head of so-called _Oil-pourer_. Museum of Fine\r\nArts, Boston.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 11\r\n\r\nStatue of the so-called _Oil-pourer_. Glyptothek, Munich.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL-SCRAPING.\r\n\r\nAnother ordinary palæstra motive was employed in representing the\r\nathlete after the contest, scraping oil and dirt from his body and\r\narms with the scraping-blade or strigil (στλεγγίς, _strigilis_).[1048]\r\nThis motive is not uncommon on r.-f. vase-paintings of the fifth\r\ncentury B. C.[1049] It was treated in sculpture by many masters. Pliny\r\nmentions such statues of athletes _destringentes se_ (ἀποξυόμενοι),\r\nby Polykleitos, Lysippos, and Daidalos of Sikyon.[1050] Perhaps\r\nthe _perixyomenoi_ by Antignotos and Daïppos, the latter the son\r\nof Lysippos, had the same motive.[1051] Of the _Apoxyomenos_ of\r\nPolykleitos we have no authenticated copies in sculpture, though\r\nFurtwaengler believes that he has found reminiscences of it on gems\r\nwhich represent a youth resting the weight of his body on the left\r\nleg, the right being drawn back (_i. e._, in the attitude of the\r\n_Doryphoros_), the right forearm extended, and the left holding a\r\nstrigil. The similarity of these gem-designs makes it certain that\r\nthey are all derived from a well-known work of art.[1052] Perhaps the\r\nfine bronze statuette, dating from the middle of the fifth century B.\r\nC., and now in the Loeb collection in Munich, represents the pose of\r\nthe _destringens se_ by Polykleitos.[1053] It represents a nude youth\r\nresting the weight of the body on the soles of both feet, the left one\r\nslightly advanced, and holding a strigil in the raised right hand.\r\nThe famous marble copy of an _Apoxyomenos_ in the Vatican[1054] (Pl.\r\n29), which, because of its long slim legs and graceful ankles, might\r\nwell represent a runner, has long been held to represent the canon\r\nof Lysippos, as it exhibits proportions widely different from those\r\nemployed by Polykleitos, and agreeing with Pliny’s account of Lysippos’\r\ninnovations.[1055] However, the doubts arising in recent years as to\r\nwhether this statue is a copy of Lysippos’ statue or a later work will\r\nbe considered at length in Chapter VI.[1056]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 12\r\n\r\nStatue of an _Apoxyomenos_. Uffizi Gallery, Florence.]\r\n\r\nThe same motive is exemplified by many existing statues, statuettes,\r\nreliefs, etc. The marble statue of an athlete in the Uffizi, Florence,\r\n(Pl. 12),[1057] a copy of an original of the end of the fifth century\r\nB. C., wrongly restored as holding in both hands a vase at which\r\nthe athlete is looking down, was interpreted by Bloch as an ephebe\r\npouring oil from a lekythos held in the right hand into an aryballos\r\nheld in the left. This action for an athlete has been characterized\r\nby Furtwaengler as “unparallelled, unclassical and, above all,\r\nabsurd.” Through recent discoveries we now know that it represents an\r\napoxyomenos, and that it should be restored with the left forearm close\r\nto the thigh, and with the right crossing the abdomen diagonally in\r\nthe direction of the left hand. This attitude so closely corresponds\r\nwith that of a figure on a gem as to make it probable that both gem and\r\nstatue are copies of the same original. The figure on the gem[1058]\r\nholds a strigil in both hands and is generally explained as scraping\r\nthe dirt from the left thigh; the light hand holds the handle and the\r\nleft the blade. A hydria, palm-branch, and crown are pictured to the\r\nright—showing that the figure represents an athlete, just as the statue\r\nhas the swollen ears of one. The attention of the athlete in both\r\nmonuments is concentrated on the operation involved—a concentration\r\nreminding us of Myron’s _Diskobolos_. While, however, in the latter\r\nwork the concentration is momentary, it is less transient in the\r\nFlorence statue and also in the Munich _Oil-pourer_. This pose is too\r\nconscious in the Florentine statue to be the work of Myron. Arndt names\r\nno artist, but as the similarity between the head of the statue and\r\nthat of the _Oil-pourer_ is so marked, and as every one now regards the\r\nlatter as Attic—even if not by Alkamenes—he thinks that the two must\r\nbe by the same Attic sculptor, although the Uffizi statue is somewhat\r\nlater than the Munich one.[1059] The original of the Florence statue\r\nwas famous, if we may judge by the existing number of replicas with\r\nvariations.[1060]\r\n\r\nAmong statues showing the same motive and pose, we may note the\r\nbronze statue of an athlete over life-size—pieced together from 234\r\nfragments—found by the Austrians at Ephesos and now in Vienna.[1061]\r\nThe subject, pose, and heavy proportions recall the Argive school\r\nof Polykleitos, and its original has been assigned by Hauser to the\r\nSikyonian Daidalos, the son and pupil of Patrokles, who was the pupil\r\nof Polykleitos. As further reproductions of the same type of figure, we\r\nmay cite a bronze statuette in Paris,[1062] and a marble one found at\r\nFrascati in 1896 and now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[1063]\r\n\r\nA chalcedony scarab of archaic type in the British Museum represents\r\na nude athlete with a lekythos slung over the left arm and a strigil\r\nin the left hand, which rests on the hip.[1064] A beautiful marble\r\ngrave-relief, much mutilated, in the museum at Delphi,[1065] which\r\ndates from the middle of the fifth century B. C., represents a palæstra\r\nvictor, with his arms extended to the right, cleansing himself with a\r\nstrigil, which is held in the right hand, while a slave boy, holding\r\nthe remnant of an aryballos in his right hand, looks up at him from\r\nthe right. The careful anatomy of this relief may point to Pythagoras\r\nof Samos, as its author, though we have no certain work of his, for it\r\nfits the description of that artist by Pliny, who says that he was the\r\nfirst to express sinews and veins.[1066]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBATION-POURING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 13\r\n\r\nStatue of an Athlete, after Polykleitos. Farnsworth Museum, Wellesley\r\nCollege, U. S. A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Bronze Statuette of an Athlete. Louvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nAn original Greek bronze statuette in Paris (Fig. 24)[1067] reproduces\r\nthe motive of the statue of the boy wrestler Xenokles by the sculptor\r\nPolykleitos Minor at Olympia, as a comparison with the footprints on\r\nthe recovered base of the latter shows.[1068] As the forms correspond\r\nwith those of the _Doryphoros_ and _Diadoumenos_, and as its execution\r\nis so marvelous, Furtwaengler has ascribed the statuette to the\r\ncircle of Polykleitos’ pupils. The position of the right hand, which\r\nhas the thumbs drawn in, corresponds with that of the _Idolino_ (Pl.\r\n14), which we are to discuss, and can best be explained by assuming\r\nthat it similarly held a kylix; the left hand carried a staff-like\r\nattribute. The head is bent and looks to the right. Furtwaengler\r\nbelieved that, inasmuch as the act of pouring a libation does not occur\r\nin art or literature as an athletic motive, the statuette represented a\r\nhero or god. Many Roman marble copies show the same motive and preserve\r\nto us a Polykleitan work which corresponds in all essentials with the\r\nLouvre statuette.[1069] We mention two, the only ones of the type in\r\nwhich the heads are on the trunks, one in the Galleria delle Statue\r\nof the Vatican,[1070] the other in the Farnsworth Museum at Wellesley\r\nCollege (Pl. 13).[1071] These copies represent a youth standing with\r\nboth feet flat upon the ground, the weight of the body resting upon the\r\nright one, while the left is turned a little to the side. He is looking\r\ndownwards to the right. Doubtless we should restore these copies after\r\nthe Paris bronze, with a kylix in the right hand. The palm-branch\r\nin a similar statue, to be mentioned further on, shows that in all\r\nprobability the origin statue was that of an athlete; and that he was\r\na famous athlete is shown by the number of copies of the torso and\r\nhead.[1072] A bronze head from Herculaneum (Fig. 25)[1073] so strongly\r\nresembles in its forms the type under discussion—which Furtwaengler has\r\ncalled the “Vatican athlete standing at rest”[1074]—and corresponds\r\nwith it so closely in its measurements, that it might be regarded as\r\na copy of the same original, if certain differences, not due to the\r\ncopyist, did not rather show that it comes from a closely allied work.\r\nThis head shows an intense melancholy, which has been explained by\r\nFurtwaengler as due to the lack of skill on the part of the copyist,\r\nwho fashioned it slightly askew. Amelung very properly explains the\r\nabsence of the motive of libation-pouring in athletic art as merely\r\na lacuna in our sources.[1075] If the original of these copies and\r\nvariations represented an athlete, he was certainly pouring a libation\r\nbefore victory; if a warrior, he was doing the same thing before going\r\non a campaign. In the latter case the left hand should be restored with\r\na spear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Bronze Head of an Athlete, from Herculaneum.\r\nMuseum of Naples.]\r\n\r\nWe must also place here the life-size original Greek bronze in\r\nFlorence, discovered at Pesaro, near Ancona, in 1530, and known from\r\nthe early eighteenth century as the _Idolino_ (Pl. 14),[1076] for its\r\nmotive connects it with the series just discussed. This is, perhaps,\r\nour finest bronze statue from antiquity, as it represents the highest\r\nideal of boy beauty, just as the _Doryphoros_ does of manly beauty.\r\nThe chief characteristics—the positions of the feet, head, and arms,\r\nthough essentially those of the statues discussed, offer certain\r\ndifferences. Thus the left leg is placed more to one side and turned\r\nfurther outwards than in the statue of Xenokles and kindred works;\r\nthe left hand hangs down at an angle to the leg differently from the\r\nothers. In other words, by comparing it with the Paris statuette,\r\nwe see a slightly different rhythm from that found in Polykleitan\r\nworks. The _Idolino_ has been looked upon as Myronic by Kekulé,[1077]\r\nStudniczka,[1078] and hesitatingly Klein,[1079] while Mahler regarded\r\nit as Pheidian.[1080] Furtwaengler, however, by a careful analysis, has\r\nshown its Polykleitan characteristics—especially the shape of the head\r\nand the features, and the treatment of the hair, which reminds us of\r\nthe Naples copy of the _Doryphoros_. Owing to differences, however, he\r\ndid not assign it to the master himself, but suggested that it was the\r\nwork of his pupil Patrokles.[1081] Bulle found the head Polykleitan,\r\nbut the body Attic, and assigned the figure to an unknown Attic\r\nsculptor working in the Polykleitan circle. In this controversy on its\r\nstyle, a statue found in 1916 in the excavations of the Baths at Kyrene\r\nshould be of use, for it is the most faithful of all the Roman copies\r\nknown of the bronze original and clearly shows a Polykleitan character\r\ninfluenced by Attic art.[1082] By a comparison of this marble copy\r\nwith the Florentine bronze we see that the latter was a subsequent\r\nrendition of the same original, and doubtless by some artist of lesser\r\nfame from the Polykleitan school, who was influenced by Attic art.\r\n\r\nBut it is the interpretation of the _Idolino_ which chiefly interests\r\nus here. While Longpérier called the similar Paris statuette a _Mercure\r\naptère_, and the publisher of the statue from Kyrene called that copy a\r\n_Hermes_, yet Kekulé, Bulle, and most other archæologists have seen in\r\nthe _Idolino_ an athlete. The inner surface of its outstretched right\r\nhand is left rough, and the fingers are in the same position as those\r\nof the Paris bronze. Such a position can be explained satisfactorily by\r\nrestoring the hand with a kylix or a φιάλη, such as was commonly used\r\nin libations. The left hand is smooth and evidently empty, though Bulle\r\nrestores it with a victor’s fillet, and so, following Kekulé, calls the\r\nstatue that of a boy victor, who is bringing an offering to the altar\r\nin honor of his victory. The marble statue in the Galleria delle Statue\r\nhas the right forearm restored; in the Kyrene statue the right hand\r\nis preserved and has a thick object held downwards at a greater angle\r\nthan in the _Idolino_. The photograph does not let us judge decisively,\r\nbut it seems to be too thick an object for the remnants of a kylix.\r\nA marble statue in the Barberini Palace, Rome,[1083] which resembles\r\nthe _Idolino_ so closely as to be considered a copy of it, though with\r\nvariations of pose and technique, has the arms broken off, and so adds\r\nnothing to the solution of the motive of the _Idolino_. The fact that\r\na palm-stem stands beside the right leg, however, adds weight to the\r\ninterpretation as victor. Furtwaengler interprets the _Idolino_ and\r\nkindred works as divinities. Though boys serve at libations, he thinks\r\nthey never perform the ritual act of pouring the libation.[1084] That\r\na libation-pourer should appear in the guise of a boy victor (that of\r\nXenokles) he calls a genuine Argive trait. Svoronos, also, has recently\r\ntried to show that the _Idolino_ is not a victor,[1085] but represents\r\nthe hero Herakles. He compares the figure with a fourth-century\r\nPentelic marble relief in Athens,[1086] which represents Herakles\r\nstanding at the door of Hades and beside him a father leading his son\r\nup to the open air. The pose of the figure of Herakles resembles that\r\nof the _Idolino_ in a remarkable way. In the relief Herakles holds\r\na kylix in the right hand[1087] and a club in the left, and a lion\r\nskin is thrown over the left arm. Svoronos believes that the left\r\nhand in the relief explains the turning in of the left hand of the\r\n_Idolino_—for he believes that the latter also held a club. We must,\r\nhowever, leave the final solution of the motive of the _Idolino_\r\nand kindred works open, although inclining to the belief that they\r\nrepresent a victor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 14\r\n\r\nBronze Statue known as the _Idolino_. Museo Archeologico, Florence.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Marble Statue of an Athlete(?). National Museum,\r\nAthens.]\r\n\r\nA statue in Athens, which was found in 1888 in the Roman ruins at\r\nthe Olympieion, may represent a boy victor pouring a libation (Fig.\r\n26).[1088] It is a poor Roman copy, dry and lifeless, of a bronze\r\noriginal of the middle of the fifth century B. C.[1089] In this\r\nstatue Mayer has seen the motive, and probably the copy, of the\r\n_Splanchnoptes_ (Roaster of Entrails) by the sculptor Styphax (or\r\nStyppax) of Cyprus, which, according to Pliny,[1090] represented\r\nPerikles’ slave “roasting entrails and blowing hard on the fire, to\r\nkindle it, till his cheeks swell.” He thinks that the position of the\r\nbroken arms and a comparison of the figure with similar ones on vases\r\nmake the identification possible. Von Salis concurs in his restoration\r\nand interpretation and publishes a small statuette in Athens from\r\nDodona,[1091] which has a similar pose, and holds a three-pronged\r\nfork in the left hand, which he believes should be restored in the\r\nstatue. Although statue and statuette have much in common (_e. g._, the\r\nposition of the breast and shoulders, the treatment of the hair, etc.),\r\nwhich shows that both may be copies of one original, the conception\r\nof the two is somewhat different. The statue from Athens represents\r\na boy standing busily engaged at the altar; the statuette represents\r\none standing at rest merely looking on, the fork not being held in\r\nposition for use.[1092] In any case the face of the Athens statue\r\ncan not correspond with Pliny’s description—_ignemque oris pleni\r\nspiritu accendens_. Quite a different explanation of the statue is\r\npossible—one which Mayer thought improbable. The right arm—broken above\r\nthe wrist—was raised to the height of the shoulder and may have held an\r\nobject in the hand; the left arm—broken off below the shoulder—seems\r\nto have been held close to the body and appears to have corresponded\r\nin movement with the other. The boy, therefore, may have held a cup in\r\nthe right hand and a branch or a victor fillet in the left. Thus it may\r\nmerely be another example of a boy victor pouring a libation.\r\n\r\nCertain other statues have been mistaken either for libation-pourers\r\nor oil-pourers, when they are really wine-pourers and have nothing\r\nto do with the athletic motives under discussion. A good example is\r\nthe marble statue of a _Satyr_ in Dresden,[1093] which represents the\r\nyouthful demi-god lifting a can with his right hand, out of which he\r\nis pouring wine into a drinking-horn held in the left. There are many\r\ncopies of this work,[1094] a fact which shows that the original bronze\r\nwas famous. An attempt has therefore been made to identify it with the\r\nbronze _Satyr_ of Praxiteles mentioned by Pliny as the _Periboëtos_ or\r\n“far-famed,”[1095] which seems to have been grouped with a _Dionysos_\r\nand a figure of _Drunkenness_—a grouping which might fit the Dresden\r\n_Satyr_, since a second figure should be imagined, for which the horn\r\nis being filled. However, it differs stylistically so much from the\r\n_Hermes_ of Olympia that the ascription has been given up, though its\r\ngraceful form shows Praxitelean influence and certainly emanates from\r\nthe fourth century B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTING AFTER THE CONTEST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 15\r\n\r\nMarble Head of an Athlete, after Kresilas (?). Metropolitan Museum, New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nA very favorite motive was to represent a victor, either standing or\r\nseated, resting after the exertions of the contest (ἀναπαυόμενος).\r\nAn excellent example of this motive in a standing posture is the\r\nfourth-century B. C. statue of Attic workmanship found at Porto d’Anzio\r\nand now in the Vatican,[1096] which reproduces the type of the _Apollo\r\nLykeios_.[1097] Many of the statues, by various sculptors, which\r\nrepresent the victor standing at rest may be intended to represent him\r\nas resting after the contest. The well-known head of a youth adorned\r\nwith the victor’s chaplet, and preserved in four copies in European\r\nmuseums, appears to come from a statue which represented a victor in\r\nthis manner. The best of these copies is in the collection of Lord\r\nLeconfield at Petworth House, Sussex.[1098] We should add a fifth,\r\na Roman copy of the head, in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (Pl.\r\n15).[1099] In these copies the ears are not swollen, and a certain\r\nrefinement and gentleness show that the original was not from the\r\nstatue of a boxer or pancratiast, but from that of another type of\r\nathlete, perhaps a pentathlete. Since Pliny mentions the statue of a\r\n_Doryphoros_ by Kresilas,[1100] and because of its supposed Kresilæan\r\nstyle, Furtwaengler, albeit on slender grounds, has attempted to\r\nidentify the original of these heads with that work.[1101] The\r\nexpression is certainly one of complete repose. On the crown of the\r\nhead, and on the left side over the fillet, is a rectangular broken\r\nsurface,[1102] apparently the remnant of a support for the right arm,\r\nwhich, as Conze thought, proves that the athlete stood with one arm\r\nresting on the head, the hand hanging over the left side. Furtwaengler\r\nadmitted that such an attitude might be that of an apoxyomenos,[1103]\r\nbut pointed out that the expression of the face in all the copies seems\r\ntoo tranquil for such an interpretation. Since the victor was in repose\r\nand the left arm required a slight support, he believed that this\r\nsupport might have been an akontion. He therefore reconstructed the\r\noriginal statue as that of a resting pentathlete, and assigned it to\r\nthe great Cretan contemporary of Pheidias, who worked in Athens.[1104]\r\nThe number of replicas at least shows that the original was a famous\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nPerhaps our best example of the motive of a seated victor resting after\r\nthe contest is the bronze statue of a boxer found in Rome in 1884\r\nand now in the Museo delle Terme there (Pl. 16 and Fig. 27).[1105]\r\nThis is a masterpiece in the portrayal of brute strength in the\r\nmost naturalistic and revolting way. If we like to think of victors\r\nas having noble forms, we are rudely startled on looking at this\r\nbrutal prize-fighter. If we compare it with works of the fifth and\r\nfourth centuries B. C., we see in it, as in no other example of Greek\r\nsculpture, the great change which professionalism had later wrought in\r\nthe Greek ideal of athletics. Here are massive proportions, bulging\r\nmuscles, arms and legs hard and muscle-bound. We can compare it only\r\nwith the bronze head of a boxer found at Olympia (Fig. 61 A and B) of\r\nsimilar style and age.[1106] But there we have only the head, while\r\nhere we have a complete statue almost perfectly preserved, the only\r\nrestorations being a portion of the left thumb, a piece of the right\r\nflank, and the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Head from Statue of the _Seated Boxer_. Museo\r\ndelle Terme, Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 16\r\n\r\nBronze Statue of the _Seated Boxer_. Museo delle Terme, Rome.]\r\n\r\nIt represents a professional boxer, who is seated exhausted at the\r\nclose of the bout, the severity of which is indicated by every part of\r\nthe body. He leans forward, his arms rest on his thighs, and his\r\nhead, sunk between his shoulders, is raised and turned to the right,\r\nas he stupidly looks around at the applauding spectators. His nose is\r\nbroken and his ears are swollen and scars of the contest show on his\r\nface and limbs. Beneath his retreating upper lip some of his teeth\r\nappear to have been knocked out as the result of previous fights, while\r\nindications of the recent struggle are to be seen in the blood dripping\r\nfrom his ears and the deep lacerations in face and shoulder, which may\r\nhave once been filled with red paint to make his appearance even more\r\nrealistic. The right eye is swollen and the lower lid and the cheek\r\nimperceptibly sink into each other. The mustache shows flecks of blood\r\nand the swollen back of the right hand protrudes through the glove. His\r\nnose is clotted with blood and he seems to be struggling to get his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nSuch realism and delight in depicting the hideous show that the work,\r\nlike the Olympia head, belongs to the Hellenistic age. The careful\r\nworkmanship, especially visible in the hair and beard and in the hair\r\non the chest[1107], proves that the statue is not a Roman copy, but\r\na Greek original of the beginning of the Hellenistic age, of the end\r\nof the fourth or beginning of the third century B. C. Nor is it a\r\nportrait, as Winter maintained,[1108] since it is an adaptation of a\r\nlate type of Herakles. It certainly is a victor statue from one of\r\nthe great Greek games, and is, perhaps, from Olympia itself. Since\r\nthe head is turned toward the right shoulder and the mouth is open,\r\nas if speaking, Wunderer tried, on the basis of a passage in the\r\nhistory of Polybios,[1109] to identify it with the statue of the famous\r\nTheban boxer and pancratiast Kleitomachos at Olympia by an unknown\r\nartist.[1110] The historian states that Kleitomachos, while fighting\r\nwith the Egyptian Aristonikos, was angered by the acclaim given the\r\nforeigner and, stepping aside, chided the spectators for not cheering\r\none who was fighting for the honor of Greece. The speech caused a\r\nrevulsion in the popular feeling, which helped, even more than the\r\nfists of Kleitomachos, to vanquish Aristonikos. However, the motive of\r\nthe statue does not fit the incident, as the boxer is not speaking,\r\nbut breathing hard, nor is the seated posture that of one haranguing a\r\ncrowd. Moreover, the date of the Theban’s victory is too late for the\r\nstatue.[1111]\r\n\r\n\r\nATTRIBUTES OF VICTOR STATUES.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fifth century B. C. athletic training tended\r\nto produce a uniform standard of physical development, which was\r\nreflected in sculpture. At this date we do not find the divergence of\r\nstyle which we saw in our review of the “Apollo” type of the sixth\r\ncentury. Vase-paintings show the change better than sculpture. On\r\nblack-figured vases of the sixth century B. C., we see a good deal\r\nof variety in groups of boxers and wrestlers, while on red-figured\r\nvases of the early fifth century the number of types is far less.\r\nIn sculpture, however, differences in physical type did exist in\r\nthe various schools at the beginning of the fifth century. We have,\r\nfor example, the heavy, square-shouldered type in the _Apollo\r\nChoiseul-Gouffier_ (Pl. 7A), which we have classed as a victor\r\nstatue, and the tall, rawboned type in the _Tyrannicides_ by Kritios\r\nand Nesiotes (Fig. 32, _Harmodios_).[1112] We have, on the other\r\nhand, a very different physical type in the short, stocky Aeginetan\r\npedimental figures (Figs. 20 and 21). Between such extremes there\r\nare, of course, many gradations. We might instance the archaic\r\nbronze statuette of a diskobolos in the Metropolitan Museum (Fig.\r\n46).[1113] However, notwithstanding the diversity in type, it is\r\noften difficult to distinguish runners from wrestlers, boxers from\r\npentathletes. Thus few early fifth-century statues show the type of\r\nrunner as well as the _Apollo of Tenea_ (Pl. 8A), or that of a boxer\r\nas well as the “_Apollo_” from Delphi (Pl. 8B). The reason for this\r\nis the ideal element, which entered into all these statues and which\r\nwas a reflection of the uniform development of athletics long before\r\nspecialization had set in. Out of this uniformity grew the canon of\r\nPolykleitos, developed from that of Hagelaïdas.\r\n\r\nThe sculptor of the sixth century B. C. was incapable of\r\ndifferentiating between god and mortal. This was especially the case,\r\nas we have seen, with Apollo, as the “Apollo” type was a model of manly\r\nvigor. In the early fifth century the sculptor had largely overcome\r\nthis difficulty, but still showed little diversity of type in treating\r\nstatues of different kinds of athletes. A method of differentiation\r\nwhich was essential to athlete sculptors of the sixth century was found\r\nconvenient of retention by those of the fifth—_i. e._, characterizing\r\nthe statue of the victor by some attribute, in order, on the one hand,\r\nto differentiate it from the nude god or hero, and on the other to\r\ndistinguish between different types of victors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMARY ATTRIBUTES OF VICTOR STATUES.\r\n\r\nTHE VICTOR FILLET.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the sculptor would characterize the victor statue\r\nas such. The easiest way to do this would be to represent it with\r\na fillet or chaplet (ταινία)[1114] bound round the head, as we saw\r\nwas the case in the statue of Milo. This fillet was merely a band\r\nor riband of wool which was given the Olympic victor in addition\r\nto the garland of olive leaves, or the palm-branch, as a symbol of\r\nvictory. Waldstein has argued that this fillet originally was not\r\nan essential attribute of the victor, but that the crown and palm\r\nwere the prizes, and the fillet merely a decoration used on various\r\noccasions, such as at symposia,[1115] which only later became a general\r\nathletic attribute.[1116] Though the presence of the fillet on statues\r\nshould not, therefore, be proof that the given statue is that of a\r\nvictor,[1117] there is no defense for the contention of Passow[1118]\r\nthat the _tainia_ was in no sense a symbol of victory, but merely a\r\ntoilet article among the gifts presented by the public to a victor at\r\nthe ovation of the crowning. Pausanias says that the victor Lichas of\r\nSparta was scourged by order of the umpires at Olympia for having set\r\nthe _tainia_ on the head of his victorious charioteer.[1119] This is\r\nsufficient evidence that it was not a mere toilet article, but rather\r\na part of the official prize of victory. Similarly the _tainia_ in the\r\nhand of Nike upon the right hand of the statue of Zeus by Pheidias at\r\nOlympia can not have been a toilet article.[1120]\r\n\r\nWe have many examples from athletic sculpture of the use of the fillet.\r\nThus it appears on the bronze head of a boxer in the Glyptothek (Pl.\r\n3)[1121] and on the bronze head from Herculaneum in Naples (Fig.\r\n4),[1122] both of which have been discussed in Chapter II, as fragments\r\nof Greek original statues of Olympic victors. It also appears on the\r\nmarble head of a youthful victor—not necessarily Olympic—from the\r\nAkropolis,[1123] which, because of the similarity in cheeks, mouth,\r\nand eyes to heads on the metopes of the Parthenon, should be dated\r\nsomewhere between 450 and 440 B. C. It occurs on the Olympia marble\r\nhead (Frontispiece and Fig. 69),[1124] which we ascribe in Chapter VI\r\nto Lysippos, and likewise on the statue of the pancratiast Agias in\r\nDelphi (Pl. 28, Fig. 68). In most athlete heads the fillet is twisted\r\ninto a knot at the back of the head. In one case, on the Petworth head\r\nof a pentathlete already discussed,[1125] which, because of the curve\r\nof the neck, must come from a statue represented at rest, it is not\r\nso tied, but is wound round the head with the two ends tucked in and\r\npushed through the fillet on either side over the temples.[1126] Though\r\nso practical an arrangement as the latter must have been common enough\r\nin real life, this seems to be the only example of its representation\r\nin sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe fillet, instead of encircling the head, was sometimes held in\r\nthe hand, as in the case of the Spartan chariot victor Polykles at\r\nOlympia.[1127] A curious life-size statue of the Roman period, found\r\nin the Peiræus, represents a nude boy holding in his right hand over\r\nthe breast a bundle of books and in the left an alabastron. The body is\r\ncovered with fillets—fifteen in all—which appear to have been prizes\r\nwon in gymnic contests, probably at the gymnasium or palæstra.[1128]\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLET-BINDERS.\r\n\r\nStatues representing victors binding fillets in their hair\r\n(_diadoumenoi_) are common to all periods of Greek art.[1129] We shall\r\ndiscuss only two—those of Pheidias and of Polykleitos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 17\r\n\r\nStatue known as the _Farnese Diadoumenos_. British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nPausanias mentions a statue by Pheidias, representing a _Boy Binding on\r\na Fillet_, as standing in the Altis at Olympia.[1130] Robert has argued\r\nthat this figure was the one of similar motive mentioned by Pausanias\r\nas on the throne of Zeus there.[1131] However, the figure on the throne\r\nwas very probably in relief and not in the round.[1132] The cicerones\r\nat Olympia seem to have been imposing on the periegete when they said\r\nthat a likeness to Pantarkes, the boy favorite of Pheidias, was to be\r\nseen in the face of this figure on the throne. The mention of Pantarkes\r\nhas given rise to the usual identification of the παῖς ἀναδούμενος with\r\nthe victor statue of the Elean Pantarkes mentioned by Pausanias\r\nas standing in the Altis.[1133] However, the assumption[1134] is\r\nfar-fetched and must be rejected, because Pausanias mentions the two\r\nstatues in two different parts of his _periegesis_ of the Altis.[1135]\r\nOf the παῖς we know only the artist’s name. It was probably merely a\r\nvotive gift,[1136] and the name of the person so honored was unknown to\r\nPausanias. Of the statue of the victor Pantarkes we know only the name,\r\nand neither the artist nor the motive of the statue. It seems clear,\r\ntherefore, that we have to do with three distinct monuments: the boy\r\nwith the fillet, the throne figure by Pheidias, and the victor by an\r\nunknown sculptor.[1137]\r\n\r\nThe small marble statue in the British Museum known as the _Diadoumenos\r\nFarnese_[1138] (Pl. 17), which is now almost universally regarded as an\r\nAttic work,[1139] has been assumed by many archæologists to be a copy\r\nof Pheidias’ statue.[1140] Since Pausanias tells us that a statue by\r\nPheidias stood in Olympia, representing an unknown boy binding a fillet\r\naround his head, and since the style of the _Farnese_ statue shows\r\ngreat similarity in head and body forms and general bearing to certain\r\nfigures on the Parthenon frieze,[1141] and its motive agrees with that\r\nof the Olympia statue, it seems reasonable to see in this little work a\r\ncopy of the statue in the Altis by the great master. Furtwaengler and\r\nBulle have shown that the motive of this work was initiated by Pheidias\r\nand not by Polykleitos, since the latter’s great statue was several\r\nyears younger than the work of Pheidias at Olympia. That Pheidias was\r\npleased with the motive is disclosed by the fact that he repeated it on\r\nthe throne of Zeus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 18\r\n\r\nStatue of the _Diadoumenos_, from Delos, after Polykleitos. National\r\nMuseum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Statue of the _Diadoumenos_, from Vaison, after\r\nPolykleitos. British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nThe _Diadoumenos_ of Polykleitos was little less famous than his\r\n_Doryphoros_, if we may judge by the number of copies which have\r\nsurvived and from literary notices of it.[1142] In all the copies of\r\nthis work we see the well-known Polykleitan characteristics—powerful\r\nbuild, heavy proportions, and fidelity to nature; but none of the\r\nideal tendency prominent in the works of Pheidias and his school, nor\r\nof the violent energy characteristic of Myron’s art. In all of them\r\nthe pose of the earlier _Doryphoros_ is retained, except that the arms\r\nare differently employed and the build of the body is more slender.\r\nPliny, despite his statement—which is probably taken from some Greek\r\nauthority—that monotony was the characteristic of Polykleitos’ works\r\n(_paene ad unum exemplum_),[1143] emphasizes this slenderness by\r\ncalling the _Doryphoros_ _viriliter puer_—Lessing’s _Juengling wie ein\r\nMann_—and the _Diadoumenos_ _molliter juvenis_—a youth of gentle form.\r\nThis judgment of Pliny was difficult to understand so long as we had\r\nonly the Vaison copy of the _Diadoumenos_ to study. The Delian copy\r\nshowed that supple grace was characteristic of the original, even if\r\nmodified to suit the taste of three centuries later. Although the body\r\nforms and the attitudes of the _Doryphoros_ and the _Diadoumenos_ are\r\nvery similar, the head of the latter, usually assigned to Polykleitos,\r\nis of a different type from that of the _Doryphoros_. While the head\r\nof the _Doryphoros_ is square in profile, flat on top, and long from\r\nfront to back, that of the _Diadoumenos_ is rounder and softer and\r\ncan best be explained on the assumption that Polykleitos later in\r\nlife came under Attic influence. The copies of this work are many\r\nand varied.[1144] For a long time the marble copy in the British\r\nMuseum found in 1862, at Vaison, France,[1145] was, despite its poor\r\nworkmanship, considered our best copy (Fig. 28). It was made perhaps\r\nfive hundred years after the original, at a time when sculpture was in\r\nits decline, and consequently can give us merely a suggestion of the\r\ncharacter of Polykleitos’ statue. As it is a direct marble translation\r\nof the bronze, the muscular treatment appears exaggerated. Another\r\nmarble copy was found in 1894 by the French excavators on the island of\r\nDelos, and is now in Athens (Pl. 18).[1146] The Delian artist added\r\na mantle and a quiver to the nearby tree-trunk and thus converted an\r\noriginal victor statue into one of a god.[1147] Though its hands are\r\nlost, it is easy to see that the athlete is pulling the ends of the\r\nfillet together so as to tighten the knot at the back of the head. As\r\nthis is a Hellenistic Greek copy, it comes far nearer to the original\r\nthan the imperial Roman one from Vaison. The lighter proportions and\r\nsofter modeling show the Attic influence on Polykleitos’ later career,\r\nalthough the fleshy forms are out of harmony with his art and evidently\r\nintroduced by the copyist. One of the best preserved and most beautiful\r\ncopies is the one in the Prado at Madrid.[1148] Although a Roman copy,\r\nlike the one in the British Museum, it comes very near the original\r\nbecause of the precision in its details. There are many good copies of\r\nthe head alone.[1149] Marble heads in Kassel and Dresden, evidently the\r\nworks of Attic sculptors, show the pure Polykleitan traits. The one\r\nin Dresden[1150] (Fig. 29) surpasses all others in the beauty of its\r\nfinish, being a careful and exact copy. The proportions and structure\r\nof the head are those of the _Doryphoros_, although the surface is\r\ndifferently treated. The Kassel head[1151] is not so exact in its\r\ndetails, but has more expression. Furtwaengler rightly calls it the\r\nbetter of the two as a work of art, but inferior as a copy. A marble\r\nhead in the British Museum[1152] is a direct copy from the original\r\nbronze, like the Vaison statue. The clear-cut eyelids and wiry hair\r\nreproduce the original material, and its resemblance to the head of the\r\n_Doryphoros_ is greater than that of any other copy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Head of the _Diadoumenos_, after Polykleitos.\r\nAlbertinum, Dresden.]\r\n\r\nA later variant of the statue is seen in a small terra-cotta statuette\r\nfrom Smyrna in private possession in London.[1153] It shows the\r\nPolykleitan type so completely assimilated to the style of Praxiteles\r\nthat its genuineness has been doubted. Perhaps, with its Attic\r\nsoftness, it gives us a better idea of the beauty of the original\r\nthan many of the other copies. Finally, we must mention the original\r\nbronze head of the fifth century B. C. in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford,\r\nrecently published by Percy Gardner.[1154] This head, put together\r\nfrom nine fragments, and restored as that of a boy fillet-binder, and\r\nrivaling in delicacy and beauty such original bronzes as the Beneventum\r\nhead (Fig. 3) and the _Idolino_ (Pl. 14), not only gives us the best\r\nidea of the technical ability attained by bronze workers in the middle\r\nof the fifth century B. C., but also helps us to understand the ancient\r\nrepute of Polykleitos’ athletes. Here the headband and “starfish”\r\narrangement of the hair have their close parallels in the Dresden,\r\nKassel, and British Museum heads already discussed, which essentially\r\nreproduce the head of the Vaison statue (Fig. 28). As Gardner points\r\nout, it closely agrees with the type of the _Farnese Diadoumenos_\r\n(Pl. 17) only in one particular, the mode of tying the knot. While\r\nthe Vaison athlete is preparing to tie it, the Farnese one has just\r\nfinished the operation, the boy still holding the ends of the fillet\r\nin his hands. But only the treatment of the hair, the eye, and the ear\r\noffers a contrast. Despite these differences Gardner follows the older\r\nview of Brunn in regarding the Vaison and Farnese types as two variants\r\nof Polykleitan originals; but the pose, style, and proportions of the\r\nlatter seem to us to be too thoroughly Attic to warrant us in bringing\r\nit into relation with the work of Polykleitos. Though the heads of the\r\ntwo are not so dissimilar, the pose, as Gardner also points out, is\r\nquite different. The Vaison figure is represented as walking, _i. e._,\r\nin the very act of changing the weight of the body from one leg to the\r\nother, while the Farnese athlete stands at rest with both feet flat\r\nupon the ground. Gardner rightly regards this exquisite head not as the\r\noriginal of the statue mentioned by Pliny, since the Vaison and Delian\r\ncopies show that the latter represented a fully developed man, somewhat\r\nover life-size, and not a boy, but rather as a work of the Polykleitan\r\nschool, though he does not exclude the possibility that it may come\r\nfrom one of the many boy athletes of the master.\r\n\r\nFurtwaengler connects with the _Diadoumenos_ the statue of a youthful\r\nboxer, slightly under life-size, which shows a similar motive. It is\r\nknown to us in two copies, one in Kassel,[1155] the other in Lansdowne\r\nHouse, London.[1156] That it is a work of Polykleitos is shown by the\r\ncorrespondence of its body forms with those of both the _Diadoumenos_\r\nand the _Doryphoros_. A bronze statuette, dating from about 400 B. C.,\r\nin the Akropolis Museum, also repeats the motive without being an exact\r\ncopy.[1157]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROWN OF WILD OLIVE.\r\n\r\nThe crown of wild olive[1158] in the hair is another general but not\r\ncustomary attribute of Olympic victor statues. Fewer sculptured heads\r\nshow it than show the _tainia_, and in most of these the leaves have\r\nfallen off. Examples of its presence are afforded by the bronze head\r\nfrom Beneventum (Fig. 3) in the Louvre,[1159] and on the realistic\r\nbronze head of a boxer found at Olympia (Fig. 61 A and B).[1160] A good\r\nillustration of a boy victor crowning himself is on a fourth-century\r\nB. C. funerary relief, found in 1873 at the Dipylon gate, and now in\r\nthe Athens Museum.[1161] The victor is holding or placing a crown of\r\nleaves on his head. In the Museo delle Terme, Rome, is a mediocre\r\nheadless copy of an original statue of the end of the fifth century B.\r\nC., the work of an artist of the Polykleitan school, the restoration of\r\nwhich as a victor engaged in wreathing his head is probable.[1162] A\r\nprotuberance on the right shoulder seems to have been left by the end\r\nof the _lemniskos_ or ribbon with which the wreath was adorned.[1163]\r\nThe left hand carried an attribute, but probably not a palm-branch\r\nas Helbig assumed, since such a branch, if of metal, would have left\r\ntraces on the shoulder. The same restoration has been proposed for\r\nanother statue.[1164] A crown on the head, together with the remains\r\nof fingers near it, has been noticed on a bronze statue of Eros, of\r\nHellenistic workmanship, found off Tunis in the sea,[1165] which shows\r\nPolykleitan influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 19\r\n\r\nStatue known as the _Westmacott Athlete_. British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nThe statue of a _Boy Crowning Himself_, which has survived in many\r\nRoman copies and variant Greek originals, notably in the so-called\r\n_Westmacott Athlete_ of the British Museum (Pl. 19),[1166] a\r\nfragmentary statue of poorer workmanship in the Barracco collection\r\nin Rome,[1167] and a Greek copy from Eleusis now in the National\r\nMuseum in Athens,[1168] and identified by many archæologists with the\r\nstatue of the boy boxer Kyniskos by Polykleitos at Olympia, should be\r\ndiscussed here. While the _Westmacott Athlete_ appears to be a copy\r\nfrom the original bronze, the Barracco statue, though showing the same\r\npose, is unlike it in the treatment of hair and muscles, and with its\r\nAttic head, seems to be a carelessly executed variant, more or less\r\nMyronian in style, of the Polykleitan original. While its original may\r\nbe assigned to the end of the fifth century B. C., the Eleusis variant,\r\nwith its head differently placed, is not a Roman copy, but a Greek\r\noriginal statue showing the Polykleitan motive carried into the soft\r\nAttic style of the fourth century B. C.[1169] A fine copy of the head\r\nalone is in the possession of Sir Edgar Vincent, in his Constantinople\r\ncollection.[1170] This should be associated with another head\r\nin Dresden, both being closely related to that of the _Westmacott\r\nAthlete_.[1171] The best copy of the head is in the Hermitage, in which\r\nthe treatment of the hair approaches nearest to that of the bronze\r\noriginal.[1172] A marble head from Apollonia in Epeiros, now in the\r\nBritish Museum, which so closely resembles the head of the _Westmacott\r\nAthlete_ that the missing sections of the neck and shoulders were\r\nrestored by a cast from the latter, is somewhat different in style.\r\nFor while the Westmacott head is a mechanical copy, this Greek head is\r\nfull of vigor, disclosing Attic characteristics of the early fourth\r\ncentury B. C., and obviously is an Athenian imitation of the original,\r\nlike the statue from Eleusis.[1173] A more remote variant is the\r\nbeautiful marble head formerly in the possession of Dr. Philip Nelson\r\nin Liverpool, but now in America, which is not an exact copy of any of\r\nthe known variants, but so closely resembles the Capitoline type of\r\n_Wounded Amazon_, assigned first by Otto Jahn and later by Furtwaengler\r\nto Kresilas, that it must be by the same hand.[1174] This head also\r\nreminds us of that of the Kresilæan _Diomedes_ of the Munich Glyptothek\r\n(Pl. 21),[1175] though the hair-treatment is Polykleitan.[1176] Both\r\nshow a modification of Polykleitan forms under Attic influence. The\r\nnumerous fine copies indicate that the original was a well-known work.\r\nThat it was Polykleitan is clear from a study of the heads, which show\r\na great resemblance to that of the _Doryphoros_, and of the body forms,\r\nwhich resemble those of both the _Doryphoros_ and the _Diadoumenos_.\r\nWhile some believe this original a work of Polykleitos himself,[1177]\r\nothers think that it was by one of his pupils or successors, who\r\nimitated the master’s early style. If the original, however, was\r\nnot the statue of Kyniskos, there is little evidence that it was by\r\nPolykleitos himself.\r\n\r\nThe palm-trunk in the Westmacott copy certainly argues that the\r\noriginal was an athlete statue. The gesture of the right hand has\r\ngiven rise to different interpretations. The Barracco copy furnishes\r\nthe best evidence, as on it the right arm is preserved to the wrist,\r\nthe hand only being lost. Helbig at first (in the Barracco Catalogue)\r\nexpressed the opinion that the right hand might have held an oil-flask,\r\nfrom which oil was being poured into the left. However, the position\r\nof the left hand, as shown by the _puntello_ on the left hip, must\r\nhave been the same as that on the Westmacott copy, _i. e._, hanging\r\nclose to the left side. Helbig later (in the _Fuehrer_) explained\r\nthe motive as that of a boy setting a crown on his head, as in the\r\nbronze _Eros_ already mentioned. This interpretation, first suggested\r\nby Winnefeld,[1178] has been the favorite one among archæologists.\r\nBut all sorts of other explanations of the motive of the original\r\nhave been offered, as that the athlete was scraping his forehead or\r\nshoulders with the strigil,[1179] that the statue represented Narkissos\r\nlooking into the pool and shading his eyes with his right hand,[1180]\r\nthat it was an athlete standing at rest and holding an akontion in\r\nhis right hand—a theory harmonizing with the poise of the head, but\r\nnot with the turn of the wrist, which shows that the hand was held\r\ndownwards[1181]—and that it was, in fact, the _nudus talo incessens_\r\nof Pliny.[1182] On the head of the Eleusis statue there is a mass of\r\nmarble left over the right ear just opposite the place where the hand\r\nwould be, if it were setting a wreath on the head. The fact that no\r\nmarks are visible where the crown was attached is explained by the\r\nassumption that the wreath was of metal even in the marble copies. That\r\nthis motive, moreover, was known to both Attic and Peloponnesian art\r\nin the second half of the fifth century B. C. is well attested. Thus\r\nwe see on the Parthenon frieze a youth crowning himself with one hand,\r\nwhile holding the horse’s bridle with the other.[1183] The pose of this\r\nfigure—especially the legs—recalls the Myronian _Oil-pourer_ already\r\ndiscussed (Pl. 11). On the other hand, one of the figures of the\r\nIldefonso group in Madrid, which is Polykleitan in style, represents\r\na boy wearing a wreath, a figure closely akin to the _Westmacott\r\nAthlete_, the leg position being the same in both and the poise of the\r\nhead nearly so, although the arms are different, the left one being\r\nraised and the right hanging down.[1184] It is probable that the raised\r\nright hand of the original of the Westmacott and other replicas touched\r\nthe wreath and the lowered left held a fillet. The best explanation,\r\nthen, of the _Westmacott Athlete_ and kindred works is that the motive\r\nof the original was allied to that of the _Diadoumenos_ of Polykleitos,\r\nthough the modeling is too soft for Polykleitos, showing that the\r\ncopyists changed the original of the Argive master to suit a later\r\nand different taste. Whereas the _Diadoumenos_ is tying on a victor’s\r\nfillet, the other is presumably placing a victor’s wreath on his head.\r\nCertainly no better restoration can be made for the Barracco copy.\r\nFurthermore, many other monuments, which show a similar attitude, and\r\nwhich must be regarded as very free imitations of the original, seem to\r\nshow that the boy was represented as placing a wreath on his head.[1185]\r\n\r\nWhether the original of the series was an actual victor statue at\r\nOlympia or not is an interesting question. It has been repeatedly\r\nsuggested that it was the very statue of the boy boxer Kyniskos there,\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, the base of which has been recovered.[1186]\r\nThe external evidence for the identity consists altogether in the\r\nsimilarity in the position of the feet on this base and in the series\r\nof copies, which argues a similar pose. The base shows that the left\r\nleg bore the weight of the statue; it was slightly advanced and rested\r\non the sole, while the right leg was set back and rested on the ball\r\nonly. Thus the statue of Kyniskos was represented in the characteristic\r\nPolykleitan schema of rest, except that the position of the legs is\r\nreversed from that of the _Doryphoros_, _Diadoumenos_, _Amazon_, and\r\nother works of the master. We might add that this same reversal appears\r\non two other bases found at Olympia, which held victor statues by the\r\nelder Polykleitos[1187] and one by the younger.[1188] Moreover, the\r\nleg position of the canon does not occur in the works of the master’s\r\npupils Naukydes and Daidalos, and only in one work of Kleon.[1189]\r\nThis shows that teacher and pupils also used another motive, _i. e._,\r\nthe old canon of Hagelaïdas, besides the one associated with\r\nthe _Doryphoros_. The similarity in the position of the feet on the\r\nOlympia base and in the series of statues discussed has led some\r\nscholars, _e. g._, Petersen and Collignon, to accept the proposed\r\nidentity. This similarity in foot position, the probability that\r\nthe statue on the basis was life-size, like those of the Westmacott\r\nseries, and the palm-tree support in the British Museum replica, all\r\npointing to a victor statue, make the identity well within the range of\r\npossibility, but by no means certain. It is necessary only to rehearse\r\nthe objections to this view. In the first place the length of the foot\r\non the Olympia basis can not be accurately measured for purposes of\r\ncomparison. In the next place Polykleitos, as we have just seen, made\r\nother statues of victors at Olympia with almost the identical foot\r\nposition of that of Kyniskos. Furthermore, it seems very unlikely that\r\nso celebrated an original as that of these many replicas could have\r\nbeen standing in the Altis so late as the time of Pausanias.[1190] It\r\nis difficult, also, to understand why an imitative Attic sculptor\r\nof the fourth century B. C., should make a copy of an Arkadian boy\r\nvictor statue for Eleusis. And lastly we must not forget that up\r\nto the present time not a single Roman copy has been conclusively\r\nidentified with that of a victor statue at Olympia. If the date of the\r\nvictory of Kyniskos were definitely fixed, the question of identity\r\nwould be better substantiated. By a process of exclusion, to be sure,\r\nRobert reached the date Ol. 80 (= 460 B. C.),[1191] but other dates\r\nare possible. Under these circumstances there seems to be little more\r\nthan the possibility that we have recovered an actual victor statue at\r\nOlympia in these copies.[1192]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALM-BRANCH.\r\n\r\nThe palm-branch, either woven into a wreath or held in the hand, was a\r\nvictor attribute. Pausanias says that a crown of palm leaves was common\r\nto many contests, and that the victor everywhere in Greece carried a\r\npalm-branch in his right hand.[1193] He refers the custom to mythical\r\ntimes, tracing it back to the contest held by Theseus on Delos in honor\r\nof Apollo.[1194] Pliny mentions a painting by the Sikyonian Eupompos,\r\nwhich represented a _victor certamine gymnico palmam tenens_.[1195]\r\nWhile Milchhoefer[1196] believed that the motive of an athlete setting\r\na crown on his head with his right hand and holding a palm in his\r\nleft, which is repeated frequently and with variation in many works of\r\nart, went back to this painting of Eupompos, Furtwaengler[1197] goes\r\nfurther in assuming that the painter derived the motive from the statue\r\nof Polykleitos represented by the _Westmacott Athlete_ and kindred\r\nworks just discussed. The pupils of the great sculptor appear to have\r\ntransferred his school from Argos to Sikyon, and were, therefore,\r\nassociated with Eupompos. This attribute of the palm, permanent in\r\nbronze statues, has been broken off for the most part in marble ones.\r\nWe see it in an unfinished statue of a young athlete in the National\r\nMuseum, Athens, who holds the palm-branch in his hand. Here it has\r\nsurvived, since the statue was only blocked out.[1198] It is prominent\r\nin the funerary stele from the Dipylon representing a victor, which\r\nhas been mentioned in a preceding section;[1199] here the palm extends\r\nfrom the left hand, which is held down close to the side, up to the\r\nshoulder. We have already noted that the copyist added a palm-branch\r\nto the stump placed beside the Vatican girl runner (Pl. 2). In the\r\n_Choiseul-Gouffier Apollo_ (Pl. 7A) the left hand should doubtless\r\nbe restored with the palm-branch, because of the projecting notch of\r\nmarble on the side of the left leg near the knee.[1200] A similar notch\r\nappears also on the _Apollo-on-the-Omphalos_ in Athens (Pl. 7B), which\r\nshows that the left hand held a long attribute, which was doubtless\r\na palm-branch. This attribute occurs frequently on vases.[1201] We\r\nsee it on a marble statue found at Formiae and now in the Glyptothek\r\nNy-Carlsberg in Copenhagen, which shows the same motive as that of the\r\nstatue by Stephanos (Pl. 9), though in a freer style of execution.\r\nHere the lowered right hand holds a palm-branch, which is shown in low\r\nrelief against the right arm.[1202]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY ATTRIBUTES OF VICTOR STATUES.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the sculptor was not content to represent victor\r\nstatues merely as victors, but differentiated the various kinds of\r\nvictors by special attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPLITODROMOI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Marble heads of two Hoplitodromoi, from\r\nOlympia. Museum of Olympia.]\r\n\r\nThus a hoplite victor would be represented with his usual weapons.\r\nPausanias, in mentioning the statue at Olympia of the hoplite runner\r\nDamaretos of Heraia by the Argive sculptors Eutelidas and Chrysothemis,\r\nsays that it “has not only a shield, as the armed runners still have,\r\nbut also a helmet on his head and greaves on his legs.”[1203] He adds\r\nthat the helmet and greaves were gradually abolished at Olympia and\r\nelsewhere. We have seen that the statue of Damaretos was set up at the\r\nbeginning of the fifth century B. C., when his son Theopompos, the\r\npentathlete, won his second victory, the monuments of the two being in\r\ncommon.[1204] Toward the middle of the fifth century the hoplite victor\r\nMnaseas of Kyrene had a statue at Olympia, the work of Pythagoras of\r\nRhegion, which represented him as an armed man.[1205] A Pythian victor,\r\nTelesikrates, of the fifth century B. C., had a statue at Delphi, which\r\nrepresented him with a helmet.[1206] We have actual remnants of two\r\nhoplite victor statues of the sixth century B. C., in the two bearded\r\nand helmeted life-size heads of Parian marble found at Olympia (Fig.\r\n30, a, b = A; c, d = B).[1207] The younger of these heads (A), to which\r\nprobably belong either an arm and the remnants of a shield attached\r\nwith a ram and a representation of Phrixos upon it in relief,[1208] or\r\na shield fragment with a siren’s wing upon it[1209] and the fragment\r\nof a shield edge[1210] and right foot of fine workmanship,[1211] I\r\nassigned long ago to the statue of the Thessalian hoplitodrome Phrikias\r\nof Pelinna, who won two victories in Ols. 68 and 69 (= 508 and 504 B.\r\nC.).[1212] R. Foerster had referred this head to the statue of the\r\nhoplite runner Damaretos of Heraia, whose monument, in common with\r\nthat of his son, the pentathlete Theopompos, was the work of the early\r\nArgive sculptors Chrysothemis and Eutelidas.[1213] But this fresh and\r\nvigorous head is not Peloponnesian, but shows strongly marked Attic\r\ntraits in its round face, full cheeks, and soft lips, and in the rows\r\nof regularly wound locks of hair. The arm and foot similarly disclose\r\nAttic softness and grace. Because of its Attic character, Treu and\r\nOverbeck,[1214] in opposition to Foerster, ascribed it to the statue\r\nof the Elean hoplite victor Eperastos mentioned by Pausanias.[1215]\r\nThough the date of his victory is unknown, it certainly fell some\r\ntime after Ol. 111 (= 336 B. C.)—a date far too late for so archaic a\r\nsculpture. Furtwaengler[1216] referred this and the more archaic head\r\nB to the group of Phormis at Olympia, mentioned by Pausanias.[1217]\r\nHowever, Treu[1218] showed that there was no stylistic connection\r\nbetween the two heads. The slightly more archaic head B, badly injured\r\nfrom weathering, I have referred to the Achaian hoplitodrome Phanas\r\nof Pellene, who won Ol. 67 (= 512 B. C.).[1219] In this carefully\r\nexecuted head the hair and beard are arranged in small locks and the\r\narchaic smile is prominent. While the younger head is Attic, this\r\none is unmistakably Peloponnesian; and while the former comes from a\r\nstatue represented at rest, the latter, because of the twist of the\r\nneck, seems to have come from one represented in violent motion. For\r\nthis reason Wolters believed that it came from the statue of a warrior\r\nrepresented as thrown to the ground and defending himself.\r\n\r\nThe Myronic statue in the Palazzo Valentini, Rome, known as\r\n_Diomedes_,[1220] whose pose recalls the _Diskobolos_, may represent\r\na hoplitodrome, because of its marked resemblance in attitude to the\r\nTuebingen bronze to be discussed in the next chapter (Fig. 42), and\r\nbecause of the helmet on its head.[1221]\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTATHLETES.\r\n\r\nPentathletes were represented by attributes taken from three of the\r\nfive contests—jumping, and throwing the diskos and the javelin. All\r\nthese attributes appear in gymnasium scenes pictured on red-figured\r\nvases. Thus a kylix of the severe style in Munich[1222] gives us a\r\ngeneral picture of the exercises of the gymnasium. On the walls hang\r\ndiskoi in slings, strigils, leaping-weights, oil-flasks, sponges, and\r\njavelins. Archaic leaping-weights (ἁλτῆρες) appeared in the hands of\r\nthe statue of the Elean Hysmon at Olympia by the Sikyonian sculptor\r\nKleon.[1223] Similarly, a figure of _Contest_ (Ἀγών) in the group set\r\nup there by Mikythos had weights.[1224] The offering of the people of\r\nMende at Olympia very nearly deceived Pausanias into thinking it the\r\nstatue of a pentathlete, because of its ancient _halteres_.[1225] This\r\nshows that these weights formed a regular attribute of pentathlete\r\nstatues there. A relief from Sparta[1226] represents an athlete\r\nleaning on his spear and holding a pair of leaping-weights in his\r\nright hand. There is a bronze statue of such a victor in the Berlin\r\nAntiquarium.[1227] _Halteres_ hang on a tree-trunk to the right of\r\nthe statue of an athlete in the Pitti palace in Florence.[1228] The\r\nbreast of a marble torso, less than life-size, of a boy statue found at\r\nOlympia, shows that the hands were stretched forward, and very possibly\r\nthe objects which they held were leaping-weights.[1229]\r\n\r\nWe have no direct literary reference to a victor statue at Olympia\r\nof a pentathlete with the attributes of the diskos or javelin. That\r\nthey existed there, however, seems probable enough. Such a work as the\r\n_Diskobolos_ of Myron, which displays the youthful victor in its every\r\nline, other statues, statuettes, reliefs, and vase-paintings, show us\r\nhow the artist represented the different steps in the casting of the\r\nquoit. Similarly, the famous _Doryphoros_ of Polykleitos, copies of\r\nwhich have been identified in many museums (Pl. 4 and Fig. 48), will\r\ngive us an idea how a javelin thrower might have been represented at\r\nrest. The akontion or victor’s casting-spear, was, as we see from the\r\nSpartan relief of a pentathlete just mentioned, about the height of a\r\nman. The attitude of the diskobolos and doryphoros will be discussed at\r\nlength in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOXERS.\r\n\r\nThe statue of a boxer would be sufficiently characterized by thongs,\r\nwhich he might carry in his hand, as in the statue of the Rhodian\r\nAkousilaos at Olympia,[1230] or wound round his forearm, as in the\r\nstatue of a boxer in the Palazzo Albani, Rome,[1231] or on a near-by\r\nprop, as on the tree-stump beside the _Choiseul-Gouffier Apollo_ in the\r\nBritish Museum (Pl. 7A).[1232]\r\n\r\n\r\nWRESTLERS.\r\n\r\nLong ago Scherer tried to show that the aryballos was a\r\nwrestler-attribute, since oil was so important in wrestling.[1233] He\r\ninterpreted as _aryballoi_ the pomegranates mentioned by Pausanias\r\nas held in the hands of the statues of the wrestlers Milo[1234] and\r\nTheognetos[1235] at Olympia, assuming that the Periegete mistook\r\noil-flasks for pomegranates (ῥοιαί). But it hardly seems reasonable\r\nthat such a small utensil, which was used by athletes in general,\r\ncould ever have been regarded as a peculiar attribute of the wrestler.\r\nA similar attribute may have been held in the outstretched hand of\r\nthe half life-size archaic bronze “Apollo” of the Sciarra Palace in\r\nRome,[1236] and it occurs on other statues.[1237]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPS FOR BOXERS, PANCRATIASTS, AND WRESTLERS.\r\n\r\nOften the boxer and pancratiast (and even wrestler)[1238] are\r\nrepresented as wearing close-fitting caps, made up of thongs of\r\nleather or of solid leather. This, however, can scarcely be called\r\na determining attribute. Our best example of such a cap is afforded\r\nby an athlete head dating from the first half of the fifth century B.\r\nC., in the Capitoline Museum, Rome,[1239] formerly called a portrait\r\nof Juba II, who was the king of Numidia and Mauretania from 25 B. C.\r\nto 23 A. D. This ascription was based on the barbarous look of the\r\nhead and the fact that another head, discovered in the Gymnasion of\r\nPtolemy in Athens and thought to resemble it, was assumed to be that\r\nof Juba, since Pausanias mentions one of that prince there.[1240] It\r\nis rather the head of an athlete engaged in putting on a cap. This\r\ncap consists of three transverse leather pieces crossing the head\r\nfrom side to side, one over the forehead, one over the crown, and the\r\nthird over the occiput, all three converging above the ears. A fourth\r\nstrap fastens them together and is drawn over the crown from forehead\r\nto occiput. In the complete statue doubtless the hands were raised to\r\nthe head, grasping the straps near the ears to fasten them. This is,\r\ntherefore, an anticipation of the later _Diadoumenos_ motive. We see\r\nit in a statuette formerly in the Stroganoff collection in Rome, but\r\nnow in private possession in England,[1241] which represents an athlete\r\nputting on a similar head-dress. Though the arms of the statuette\r\nare gone, remains of the two hands are seen touching the left ear\r\nand tying the straps, one of which runs around the cranium above the\r\nswollen right ear. With this complicated head-dress we may compare\r\nthe close-fitting cap—evidently of leather—pictured on an archaistic\r\nGreek votive relief-in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, in Rome, which\r\nrepresents an athlete washing his hands in a basin, which stands on a\r\ntripod.[1242] Here the cap is fastened by two bands, one around and\r\nthe other under the chin. An object in the upper left corner of the\r\nrelief, enclosed in a frame, appears to be a victor crown adorned with\r\nbow-knots. Such caps, used in wrestling, would make it impossible for\r\nan opponent to grasp the hair; in boxing and the pankration it would\r\nprotect the head from injury. We saw that such a cap was pictured on\r\na Munich kylix of the early fifth century B. C. It is probable that\r\nsuch caps were customary at a period before athletes lost their long\r\nhair and that it was continued afterwards for various reasons. The\r\nlittle statuette from Autun now in the Louvre (Fig. 60), representing\r\na pancratiast, has a close-fitting cap. The ring at the top shows that\r\nthis statuette was hung up—perhaps being used as a weight in a Roman\r\nscale, or perhaps for adornment. In later days boys while practising\r\nin the palæstra, but never at the public games, wore ear-lappets\r\n(ἀμφωτίδες or ἐπωτίδες) to protect their ears, not dissimilar to those\r\nworn in our day for protection against the cold. We see them on a\r\nmarble head, formerly in the possession of Fabretti.[1243]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWOLLEN EAR.\r\n\r\nWe have lastly to speak of the swollen ear, which was an attribute of\r\nvictor statues, both primary and secondary, since it characterized\r\nvictors as such, and also early differentiated victors in various\r\ncontests. Swollen ears may have played a role as a characteristic\r\nattribute of pugilists in early times.[1244] We found them on the\r\nRayet head in the Jacobsen collection (Fig. 22), which belongs to the\r\nlast quarter of the sixth century B. C. and comes from the funerary\r\nstatue of an athlete, probably a boxer. In course of time, however,\r\nthey came to characterize pancratiasts, wrestlers,[1245] and athletes\r\nin general. The assumption, then, that heads with swollen ears come\r\nfrom statues of boxers,[1246] and that the boxer was known throughout\r\nGreek history as the “man with the crushed ear” is erroneous.[1247]\r\nThe earliest literary reference to the bruised ear is in Plato.[1248]\r\nThe philosopher used the term slightingly of those who imitated\r\nSpartan customs, especially Spartan boxing. The Lacedæmonians never\r\nboxed scientifically, but fought with bare fists and without rules.\r\nLiterary evidence, furthermore, shows that bruised ears did not play\r\nthe part in boxing matches which other bruised features of the face\r\ndid—the eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, and chin. Vase-paintings sustain this\r\nevidence, for we often see bloody noses and cuts on the cheeks and\r\nchin, but no crushed ears.[1249] In short, the crushed ear was merely\r\na professional characteristic, a realistic detail, common to athletes\r\nof various sorts, and, as we shall see, to warriors, gods, and heroes.\r\nTo quote Homolle: “_La bouffissure des oreilles ellemême n’est pas un\r\ntrait personnel, mais un caractère professionnel; elle ne désigne pas\r\nAgias, mais en général le lutteur. Cette déformation peut atteindre\r\nmême un dieu, s’il a pratiqué les exercices gymnastiques et passé sa\r\nvie dans les luttes_”.[1250] It is found constantly on athletic types\r\nof heads in sculpture, whether these represent gods or mortals. A few\r\nexamples will make this clear. The following heads of athletes show\r\nthe swollen ears: the bronze portrait head of a boxer or pancratiast\r\nfrom Olympia, dating from the end of the fourth century B. C. or the\r\nbeginning of the third (Fig. 61 A and B);[1251] the marble head from\r\nthe statue of the boxer Philandridas set up among the victor statues\r\nat Olympia, the work of Lysippos (Frontispiece and Fig. 69);[1252]\r\nthe head of the statue of the pancratiast Agias at Delphi (Pl. 28 and\r\nFig. 68) ;[1253] that of the _Seated Boxer_ in the Museo delle Terme\r\nin Rome (Pl. 16 and Fig. 27);[1254] that of the _Apoxyomenos_ of the\r\nUffizi in Florence (Pl. 12);[1255] the bronze head from an athlete\r\nstatue found at Tarsos and now in Constantinople, an Attic work of\r\nthe end of the fifth century B. C.;[1256] the beautiful bronze head\r\nof a boxer in the Glyptothek (Pl. 3);[1257] the head of the so-called\r\n_Apollo-on-the-Omphalos_ in Athens (Pl. 7B);[1258] the athlete head\r\nfrom Perinthos (Fig. 33);[1259] the bronze copy of the head of the\r\n_Doryphoros_, found in Herculaneum and now in Naples, by the Attic\r\nartist Apollonios (Fig. 47);[1260] the Ince-Blundell head in England,\r\nto be discussed; four heads in Copenhagen;[1261] the remarkably\r\nbeautiful bust of an athlete in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (Pl.\r\n20), whose rounded skull, oval face, projecting lower forehead, and\r\ndreamy, half-closed eyes place it in the fourth century B. C., a work\r\ninfluenced by the art of Praxiteles.[1262]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 20\r\n\r\nHead of an Athlete, School of Praxiteles. Metropolitan Museum, New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider heads of gods and heroes we find the swollen ears on\r\na variety of types. We see them on the so-called _Borghese Warrior_ of\r\nthe Louvre (Fig. 43),[1263] formerly called a _Gladiator_, and on the\r\nmarble statue of Kresilæan style in Munich, which has been known since\r\nBrunn’s interpretation as _Diomedes_ (carrying off the Palladion from\r\nTroy) (Pl. 21).[1264] This latter statue is a careful, though inexact,\r\nHadrianic copy of a famous work and is shown to represent the hero, and\r\nnot an athlete, by the mantle thrown over the arm. Skill in the boxing\r\nmatch, the roughest and most dangerous of sports, is as appropriate\r\nto _Diomedes_ as to Herakles himself. The crushed ears appear on the\r\nDresden replica of this statue, a cast from the Mengs collection, the\r\noriginal of which was once probably in England,[1265] but do not appear\r\non the poor copy in the Louvre.[1266] They also appear on the Myronian\r\nbust in the Riccardi Palace, Florence, which is a copy of an original\r\nthat was, perhaps, the forerunner of the Kresilæan _Diomedes_.[1267]\r\nHere again the garment thrown over the left shoulder shows that a\r\nyouthful hero, and not an athlete, is intended.\r\n\r\nOn heads of Herakles the swollen ears are very common. The first dated\r\nrepresentation of the hero with battered ears appears to be on coins\r\nof Euagoras I, the king of Salamis in Cyprus during the years 410-374\r\nB. C.[1268] We have several examples in sculpture from the fourth\r\ncentury B. C. Thus swollen ears and the victor fillet appear on the\r\nSkopaic head in the Capitoline Museum.[1269] Another example is the\r\nterminal bust of the youthful hero found in 1777 at Genzano, and now\r\nin the British Museum (Fig. 31).[1270] This head wreathed with poplar\r\nleaves, is probably a Græco-Roman copy of an original of the fourth\r\ncentury B. C., by an artist of the school of Lysippos. In the group\r\nrepresenting Herakles and his son Telephos, a Roman copy in the Museo\r\nChiaramonti of the Vatican, the hero is represented with fillet and\r\nbattered ears.[1271] A Parian marble head, encircled by a crown, in the\r\nGlyptothek, going back to a Lysippan bronze original, seems to come\r\nfrom the statue of the hero represented as a victor.[1272] Another\r\nlife-size head, of poor workmanship, in the Chiaramonti collection of\r\nthe Vatican, sometimes confused with the _Doryphoros_ head-type, seems\r\nto come from a statue of Herakles, as shown by the broken ears and\r\nrolled fillet, the latter a well-known attribute of the hero taken from\r\nthe symposium.[1273] A much finer replica is the bust from Herculaneum\r\nnow in Naples.[1274] Swollen ears appear also on heads of Ares. We\r\nmay instance the helmeted one in the Louvre,[1275] and especially the\r\nreplica in the Palazzo Torlonia in Rome.[1276] They are less prominent\r\non a Parian marble head of the god in the Glyptothek, which appears\r\nto be a copy of an original of which the _Ares Ludovisi_ is a more\r\ncomplete one.[1277]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Head of Herakles, from Genzano. British Museum\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 21\r\n\r\nStatue of _Diomedes with the Palladion_. Glyptothek, Munich.]\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, the statues of wrestlers, runners (except\r\nhoplitodromes), and probably pancratiasts were not distinguished by\r\nspecial attributes. In these cases the sculptor was obliged to express\r\nthe type of contest in the figure itself. His problem, therefore,\r\nwas to represent the victor in the characteristic pose of the contest\r\nin which he had won his victory, that is, by representing the statue as\r\nif in movement. This brings us to the second division of our treatment\r\nof victor statues, those which represented the victor not at rest, but\r\nin motion, a scheme which, in course of time, was extended not only\r\nto victors in wrestling and running, but to those in all contests, by\r\nrepresenting them in the very act of contending. The treatment of this\r\nclass of monuments will occupy the chief portion of Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVICTOR STATUES REPRESENTED IN MOTION.\r\n\r\nPLATES 22-25 AND FIGURES 32-62.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust when the important step of representing the victor in motion\r\ninstead of at rest was taken in Greek athletic sculpture we can not\r\ndefinitely say. The statement of Cornelius Nepos that the statues of\r\nathletes were first represented in movement in the fourth century\r\nB. C., after the time of the Athenian general Chabrias—whose image\r\nhe describes as representing Chabrias in his favorite posture with\r\nhis spear pointed at the enemy and his shield on his knee—has long\r\nsince been shown to be worthless.[1278] Nor is the assumption of many\r\narchæologists[1279] that this advance in the plastic art was taken over\r\ninto athletic sculpture soon after the statues of the _Tyrannicides_\r\nwere set up at Athens, which represented them in the midst of their\r\nimpetuous onslaught on Hipparchos, to be relied upon. These statues,\r\nhowever, occupy so important a place in the history of Greek sculpture\r\nthat we shall consider them briefly in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TYRANNICIDES.\r\n\r\nThe bronze statues of the popular heroes Harmodios and Aristogeiton, by\r\nthe sculptor Antenor, were, in all probability, set up in the Athenian\r\nagora in 506-5 B. C.[1280] The group was carried off to Susa by Xerxes\r\nin 480 B. C., and to replace it a new group, doubtless a free imitation\r\nof the older one, and probably also of bronze, was set up in 477 B. C.,\r\nthe work of the sculptors Kritios and Nesiotes.[1281] Nearly a century\r\nand a half later the stolen group was restored to Athens by Alexander\r\nthe Great[1282] and the two continued to stand side by side in Athens\r\ndown to the time of Pausanias. Neither of these groups has survived\r\nto our time, but a late Roman marble copy of one, somewhat over\r\nlifesize, found in the ruins of Hadrian’s villa and now in Naples,\r\ngives us a good idea of the original, despite restorations (Fig. 32,\r\n_Harmodios_).[1283]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Statue of _Harmodios_. Museum of Naples.]\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of this group is aided by several minor works of\r\nart, reliefs, vase-paintings, coins, lead marks, etc., the number of\r\nwhich shows that it was a common subject for Athenian artists. Botho\r\nGraef, by a careful study of the female statue found on the Akropolis\r\nin 1886 and inscribed as the work of Antenor, has shown that the\r\nstylistic contrast between it and the Naples group is too great for\r\nthe latter to be assigned to Antenor.[1284] It is now, therefore, the\r\nprevailing view that the Naples group reproduces the later statues of\r\nKritios and his associate.[1285] We do not know, then, how the older\r\ngroup looked, but we are certain that it was different from the later\r\none, for, in the years elapsing between the dates of the two, Attic\r\nsculptors had become entirely free from the Ionic influence which we\r\ndiscussed in the preceding chapter and which characterizes the female\r\nstatue of Antenor. Archaic stiffness, however, is still traceable in\r\nthe later group, for in the copy we see a work which is “concise,\r\nsinewy, hard, and with strained lines,” in harmony with Lucian’s\r\ncharacterization of the works of Hegias, Kritios, and Nesiotes.[1286]\r\n\r\nThe restorations of the Naples group, though right in the main, make us\r\ndoubtful as to the exact pose of the original figures.[1287] Harmodios\r\nhas new arms, new right leg, and left leg below the knee, while\r\nAristogeiton has a Lysippan head in place of the original bearded one,\r\nto correspond better with that of his companion. His left arm, with the\r\ndrapery hanging down, has been put on at a wrong angle, as he should\r\nbe represented holding a scabbard in the left hand and a sword in the\r\nright. On a vase fragment (oinochoe) in Boston[1288] both heroes are\r\nmaking the onset, the younger one (Harmodios) in front of the other,\r\nbut in the original statues, they were probably making the onset\r\nabreast, something that the vase-painter could not represent.[1289]\r\n\r\nWhile the Akropolis ephebe, already discussed as showing Argive\r\ninfluence (Fig. 17), still shows but little break with the law of\r\n“frontality” formulated by J. Lange,[1290] whereby an “imaginary line\r\npassing through the skull, nose, backbone, and navel, dividing the body\r\ninto two symmetrical halves, is invariably straight, never bending to\r\neither side,” the _Tyrannicides_ have broken it completely. The ephebe\r\nhas his head slightly turned to one side, and, because of resemblances\r\nin head and body to the figure of Harmodios, has been assigned to\r\nKritios or his school.[1291] Another statue at rest ascribed to the\r\nsame school is the athlete in the Somzée collection, which reminds us\r\nof the Pelops of the East Gable at Olympia.[1292] We have record of\r\none more statue by Kritios himself, which was represented in motion\r\nonly less violent than that of the _Tyrannicides_. Pausanias saw on the\r\nAkropolis of Athens a statue by him of the hoplite runner Epicharinos,\r\nwhich represented the athlete in the attitude of one practicing starts,\r\nperhaps in the very pose of the Tuebingen statuette (Fig. 42).[1293]\r\n\r\nIn the statues of the _Tyrannicides_, then, which might pass equally\r\nwell for typical athletes of the time, we have examples of statues in\r\nmotion at the end of the sixth century B. C.; for the same violent\r\naction must have characterized the earlier group of Antenor as the\r\nlater one. We have seen that the Aeginetan sculptors not only made\r\npediment groups in action at a date not later than that of the group\r\nby Kritios and Nesiotes, but single figures still earlier. Thus the\r\nsculptor Glaukias represented the Karystian boy boxer Glaukos in the\r\nact of sparring with an imaginary opponent.[1294] Though Glaukos won in\r\nOl. 65 (= 520 B. C.), his statue was set up later by his son, perhaps\r\nas late as the end of the sixth century B. C., or the beginning of\r\nthe fifth, as the _floruit_ of the sculptor would show.[1295] This\r\nis the oldest example attested by literary evidence of an athlete\r\nstatue in motion at Olympia. Whether Glaukias got his motive from\r\nAntenor’s _Tyrannicides_, or whether his work was the older, we can not\r\ndetermine, but it is safe to say that this _genre_ of statuary must\r\nhave existed at Olympia long before, as we know it did elsewhere. The\r\nRampin head, already discussed as a fragment of a victor statue, shows\r\nby the turn of its neck that athlete statues represented in motion\r\nexisted at least as far back as the first half of the sixth century B.\r\nC.[1296]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF MOTION STATUES IN GREECE.\r\n\r\nApart from specifically athletic types, we know that statues in motion,\r\nespecially those representing winged figures, antedated the sixth\r\ncentury B. C. in Greece, and were, perhaps, coeval with the very origin\r\nof Greek art.[1297] We know that the oldest Egyptian art attempted\r\nto render the human body in motion. We may instance the limestone\r\nfunerary statuette dating from the Old Kingdom, which represents a slave\r\nwoman grinding corn,[1298] and similar figures found in the graves\r\nof Memphis. In fact, the making of such statues ceased in Egyptian\r\nart after the end of the Old Kingdom. While Assyro-Babylonian art\r\nrepresented figures in motion only on reliefs, Cretan art, as we have\r\nseen in the first chapter, showed the utmost skill in representing\r\nmovement in figures in the round. It used to be assumed that in Greek\r\nart motion statues developed out of the archaic “Apollo” type through\r\nthe gradual freeing of legs and arms. Any such assumption is easily\r\ndisproved by the fact that figures in motion exist, which date back\r\nalmost as far as figures at rest. It is equally fallacious to argue\r\nthat slight movement was easier for the early artist to represent\r\nthan violent movement, for just the contrary was the case, so that\r\nin general the greater the movement represented, the greater is the\r\nage of the given monument. Early vase-paintings show that the early\r\npainter delighted in portraying free movement.[1299] It may be that\r\nthe vase-painter preceded the sculptor in portraying movement, for it\r\nwas easier to effect this in two dimensions than in three. But that\r\nstatues in motion were already known at the beginning of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., at least, is shown by the winged flying figure known\r\nas the _Nike_ of Archermos,[1300] unearthed on the island of Delos by\r\nthe French in 1877, which is a masterpiece of early Chian sculpture,\r\nperhaps coeval with the statue dedicated to Artemis by Nikandre of\r\nNaxos, found a year later on Delos,[1301] even though the latter\r\nappears more archaic. This earliest example of treating a flying figure\r\nin Greek sculpture we find repeated almost unchanged for a long time\r\nafter, especially for _akroteria_ figures on temples and in the minor\r\narts. We might mention the bronze statuette of the end of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., found on the Akropolis, which comes from the edge of a\r\nvessel and represents a winged _Nike_ springing through the air, the\r\nlegs in profile and the head and upper body turned to the front, just\r\nas in the figure of Archermos.[1302] Such figures completely disprove\r\nthe contention of Sikes that the Greek idea of a winged _Nike_ did\r\nnot antedate the fifth century B. C.[1303] The early date of statues\r\nrepresented in a lunging attitude, like the _Tyrannicides_, is also\r\nshown by the story that Herakles destroyed his own statue by Daidalos\r\nin the agora of Elis, because in the night he mistook it for an enemy\r\nlunging at him. The scheme of combatants fighting with lances seems to\r\nhave been native to Rhodian art at the end of the seventh century B.\r\nC., for we see it first on a painted terra-cotta plate in the British\r\nMuseum, which represents Hektor and Menelaos fighting for the body of\r\nEuphorbos.[1304] This pose was taken over into other arts, as we see\r\nit in the bronze statuette of a warrior found in Dodona in 1880, now\r\nin the Antiquarium in Berlin, which dates from the end of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., or the beginning of the fifth.[1305] All these examples\r\nare sufficient to show that representing the human figure in motion was\r\nan ancient motive in Greek art.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYTHAGORAS AND MYRON.\r\n\r\nBesides Kritios, two other sculptors of the transitional\r\nperiod—Pythagoras and Myron—gave a great impetus to the type of\r\nstatue in motion in the first half of the fifth century B. C. Before\r\nproceeding further we shall briefly consider their artistic activity.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to ascribe something tangible to Pythagoras of Rhegion has\r\noften been made.[1306] Practically all we really know about him is\r\nthat he was celebrated for his statues of athletes. Pausanias mentions\r\nseven statues at Olympia of victors who won in many different events,\r\nin running (including the hoplite-race), wrestling, boxing, and the\r\nchariot-race; and Pliny, in giving a list of his works, praises the\r\nstatue of a pancratiast at Delphi.[1307] Thus Pausanias records the\r\nstatues of the Sicilian wrestler Leontiskos, who won two victories\r\nin Ols. 81 and 82 (= 456 and 452 B. C.);[1308] of the boy boxer\r\nProtolaos of Mantinea, who won in Ol. (?) 74 (= 484 B. C.);[1309] of\r\nthe boxer Euthymos of Lokroi, who won three times in Ols. 74, 76,\r\n77 (= 484, 476, 472 B. C.);[1310] of Dromeus of Stymphalos, who won\r\nthe long foot-race (δόλιχος) twice in Ols. (?) 80 and 81 (= 460 and\r\n456 B. C.);[1311] of Astylos of Kroton, who won the stade-race, the\r\ndouble foot-race (δίαυλος) three times, and the hoplite-race twice in\r\nOls. 73, 74, 75, 76 (= 488-476 B. C.);[1312] of the hoplite victor\r\nMnaseas of Kyrene, victor in Ol. 81 (= 456 B. C.);[1313] and of the\r\nlatter’s son Kratisthenes, who won the chariot-race in Ol. (?) 83 (=\r\n448 B. C.).[1314] Some of these statues at Olympia must have been\r\nrepresented at rest, while others appear to have been represented in\r\nmotion. Thus the statue of Mnaseas—though it is possible that it was\r\nrepresented in motion like that of Epicharinos by Kritios already\r\nmentioned—was probably represented at rest, since Pausanias described\r\nit simply as that of an ὁπλίτης ἀνήρ.[1315] When we inquire into the\r\nstyle of Pythagoras we do not find much that is definite to guide us.\r\nBesides the bare list of his works, we have little except the statement\r\nof Diogenes Laertios that he was the first to aim at rhythm and\r\nsymmetry.[1316] Nevertheless many attempts have been made to identify\r\nhis athlete statues with existing copies. Waldstein’s interpretation of\r\nthe _Choiseul-Gouffier_ statue in the British Museum (Pl. 7A), and of\r\nthe so-called _Apollo-on-the-Omphalos_ in Athens (Pl. 7B), as copies of\r\nan original athlete statue, is, as we have shown in the second chapter,\r\nwell-founded, since the muscular build and the coiffure of these\r\nstatues betoken the athlete. But his further attempt to show that the\r\noriginal was by Pythagoras, and his identifying it with the statue of\r\nthe boxer Euthymos at Olympia, is not so reasonable.[1317]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—Head of an Athlete, from Perinthos. Albertinum,\r\nDresden.]\r\n\r\nThe attempt to ascribe the head of a pancratiast from Perinthos in\r\nDresden (Fig. 33)[1318] to Pythagoras is not convincing, though\r\nFurtwaengler has included it in his provisional Pythagorean\r\ngroup,[1319] as he does the boxer in the Louvre known as _Pollux_\r\n(Fig. 58),[1320] the athlete of the Boboli Gardens in Florence formerly\r\ncalled _Harmodios_ by Benndorf,[1321] and the statue of an athlete of\r\nlater style in Lansdowne House, London.[1322] Other scholars have also\r\nconnected the Perinthos head with Pythagoras.[1323] Hermann brought it\r\ninto relation with the bust in the Riccardi Palace in Florence, which,\r\ndespite its swollen ears, we have already classed as representing\r\na hero and not an athlete, because of the garment thrown over the\r\nshoulder.[1324] Furtwaengler tried to show that this bust was Myronian\r\nin style, classing it and the head of an athlete in Ince Blundell Hall,\r\nLancashire, England,[1325] along with that of the earlier _Diskobolos_,\r\nexplaining the acknowledged differences in the three by Pliny’s\r\nstatement that Myron _primus multiplicasse veritatem videtur_.[1326]\r\nArndt lists the Perinthos, Riccardi, and Ince Blundell heads, together\r\nwith two others in the Jakobsen collection in Copenhagen,[1327]\r\nthe head of the so-called Pollux of the Louvre, a bearded head in\r\nPetrograd,[1328] and the so-called head of _Peisistratos_ in the\r\nVilla Albani, Rome,[1329] as works emanating from one school of\r\nsculptors—the differences being explained by the many copyists. But\r\nto attempt to differentiate within the group two different sculptors,\r\nMyron or Pythagoras, he finds impossible, chiefly because we are\r\ndealing in every case with copies and not with originals, and because\r\nin no case are we certain that the head belongs to the torso on which\r\nit is set.[1330] Still another critic, A. Schober, classes together\r\nas more or less related works the Riccardi, Ince Blundell, Perinthos,\r\nand Ny-Carlsberg heads, the Louvre boxer (_Pollux_), Chinnery\r\n_Hermes_ in the British Museum,[1331] the Boboli athlete, the athlete\r\nmetamorphosed into a _Hermes_ in the Loggia Scoperta of the Vatican,\r\nand the Lansdowne athlete, and finds them all Myronian. He believes the\r\nPerinthos head to be the prototype of the Riccardi and Ince Blundell\r\nheads.[1332]\r\n\r\nIn all this confusion of opinion as to the style of Pythagoras, and\r\nin the absence of any fixed criterion of judgment furnished by an\r\noriginal authenticated work, it seems hazardous to ascribe this or that\r\nsculpture to this little-known artist. The difficulty of separating\r\nMyron and Pythagoras is even greater than that which confronts us in\r\ntrying to distinguish works of Lysippos and Skopas in the next century.\r\nWe may some day recover a genuine Pythagorean athlete statue, though\r\nthis is extremely improbable now that we have no more to expect from\r\nOlympia and Delphi, where most of his statues appear to have stood. But\r\ndespite the difficulty, many identifications of his Olympia statues\r\nhave been suggested, some of which we shall now mention.\r\n\r\nAs Pausanias says that the victor Mnaseas was surnamed _Libys_, the\r\nLibyan, and that his statue was by Pythagoras, it may be that this is\r\nthe statue mentioned by Pliny in the words: _[Pythagoras] fecit ...\r\net Libyn, puerum tenentem tabellam eodem loco (= Olympiae) et mala\r\nferentem nudum._[1333] However, in that case we can not connect the\r\nwords _Libyn_ and _puerum_, since one represented a man and the other a\r\nboy.[1334] Consequently, Pliny is speaking of three different statues,\r\nand not two, by this artist. Reisch believes that the statues of the\r\nboy and the nude man were represented at rest,[1335] the boy bearing a\r\ntablet (_i. e._, an iconic πινάκιον) in his hand, like the Athenian\r\nyouth appearing on a vase-painting in Munich.[1336] Another scholar, L.\r\nvon Urlichs, formerly identified the boy carrying the tablet with the\r\nstatue of Protolaos at Olympia,[1337] explaining the tablet as a means\r\nof characterizing the young learner. He changed his theory later,[1338]\r\nwhen, in consequence of the discovery of the Corinthian tablets, he\r\ncalled it a votive tablet. His son, H. L. von Urlichs, agreed with him\r\nbecause of a passage in the collection of _Proverbs_ by Zenobios, the\r\nsophist of Hadrian’s age,[1339] according to which the marble statue\r\nof _Nemesis_ at Rhamnous by Pheidias’ favorite pupil, the Parian\r\nsculptor Agorakritos,[1340] held an apple-branch in her left hand, from\r\nwhich a small tablet containing the artist’s name was suspended, and\r\nalso because certain coins of Syracuse and Catania represent Nike as\r\ncarrying a tablet hung by a ribbon, on which the coin-striker’s name\r\nwas engraved.[1341] The same scholar further identified the nude man\r\ncarrying the apples with the statue of Dromeus at Olympia. Since Pliny\r\ndoes not expressly say that the statue of the nude man was at Olympia,\r\neven though the sense of the passage inclines us to think it was, L.\r\nvon Urlichs interprets the apples in the hand as an additional prize\r\nat Delphi, and so makes the statue that of a Pythian victor.[1342] All\r\nsuch identifications are based on too uncertain premises.\r\n\r\nThat Pythagoras did make statues in motion is proved by his statue of\r\na limping man at Syracuse mentioned by Pliny[1343] in very realistic\r\nterms. We know of other statues by him representing athletes in motion\r\nonly by inference. Thus, in the passage just quoted, Pliny says that he\r\nsurpassed Myron with his Delphian pancratiast, which appears, inasmuch\r\nas Pliny merely calls the statue a pancratiast without mentioning any\r\nattribute, to have been represented in the characteristic lunging\r\npose.[1344] However, we can not say definitely, since the contemporary\r\nstatue of the pancratiast Kallias, by Mikon of Athens, was represented\r\nin the attitude of rest, as we learn from the footprints on its\r\nrecovered base.[1345] Pliny also says that Pythagoras surpassed\r\nwith his Delphian pancratiast his own statue of Leontiskos,[1346] a\r\nstatement which similarly appears to mark the latter as a statue in\r\nmotion. Reisch assumes that the statue of Euthymos was in motion,\r\nsince Pausanias says it was an ἀνδριὰς θέας ἐς τὰ μάλιστα ἄξιος.[1347]\r\nOn the whole, then, we may assume that Pythagoras was a sculptor who\r\nrepresented many of his victors in the attitude of motion.\r\n\r\nLove of movement also characterized the artistic temperament of\r\nMyron, even though we know that he represented gods, heroes, and\r\neven athletes, at rest. Thus coins show that Athena in his _Marsyas_\r\ngroup was represented as standing in a tranquil pose.[1348] Similarly\r\nthe Riccardi bust in Florence, already discussed, which may be\r\nMyronian, comes from a statue of a hero shown in an attitude of rest.\r\nMyron was the first Greek sculptor to make his statues and groups\r\nself-sufficient,[1349] that is, he gave to them a concentration which\r\ndoes not allow the spectator’s attention to wander. We readily see this\r\nnew principle in art when we compare the _Diskobolos_ and the group of\r\nthe _Tyrannicides_. In the latter our attention is not concentrated,\r\nfor a third figure, that of the tyrant on whom the onset is being made,\r\nis required in imagination to complete the group. We have no originals\r\nfrom Myron’s hand, but we are in far better case in regard to his work\r\nthan in regard to that of Pythagoras, since we have unmistakable copies\r\nof two of his greatest works, the _Marsyas_ and the _Diskobolos_. In\r\nthem there is little trace of the archaic stiffness that is still\r\nvisible in the _Tyrannicides_. Both of these works are represented in\r\nviolent action, and in both there is complete concentration. While\r\nthe _Diskobolos_ represents a trained palæstra athlete executing a\r\ngraceful movement, the _Marsyas_ represents a wild Satyr of the woods,\r\nwholly untrained and controlled by savage passions, in the moment of\r\nfear.[1350] In the _Diskobolos_ the face is impassive, being little\r\naffected by the violent movement of the body—a contrast only partly to\r\nbe explained as due to the copyist; in the _Marsyas_, on the contrary,\r\nthere is complete harmony between the facial expression and the violent\r\naction of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 22\r\n\r\nStatue of the _Diskobolos_, from Castel Porziano, after Myron.\r\nMuseo delle Terme, Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—Statue of the _Diskobolos_, after Myron.\r\nVatican Museum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nSince we are chiefly dependent for our knowledge of Myron’s athletic\r\nwork on the marble copies of the _Diskobolos_, which represents a\r\nnew era in athletic art, and since this statue is perhaps the most\r\nfamous athletic statue of all times, it will be well to speak of it\r\nhere at some length. It is not, so far as we know, the statue of any\r\nparticular victor, but rather a study in athletic sculpture.[1351] Of\r\nthis work there are twelve full size replicas and several statuettes.\r\nWe shall discuss only those which give us the best idea of the lost\r\noriginal. The most faithful copy is the superb marble statue in the\r\nPalazzo Lancellotti, Rome, discovered on the Esquiline in 1781 (head\r\nseen in Pl. 23).[1352] As the head has never been broken away from the\r\nbody, this copy preserves the original pose, whereas all other copies\r\nhave the head turned in the wrong direction.[1353] The head and face\r\npreserve Attic proportions and the treatment of the hair and muscles\r\ndiffers from that of the other copies, which disclose later elements.\r\nThe hair, in particular, shows signs of archaism, just as it must have\r\nbeen treated in the original, as evinced by Pliny’s criticism.[1354]\r\nThe most carefully worked copy, however, is the Parian marble torso,\r\nwhich was found in 1906 at Castel Porziano, the site of the ancient\r\nLaurentum, and is now in the Museo delle Terme, Rome (Pl. 22).[1355]\r\nThis torso was already restored in antiquity. Since the villa in which\r\nit was found was built in Augustus’ day and was restored in the second\r\ncentury A. D., we have the approximate dates both of the origin and\r\nrestoration of the statue. A weak copy, discovered in Tivoli in 1791,\r\nis in the Sala della Biga of the Vatican; the head, left arm, and\r\nright leg below the knee have been restored, the head wrongly (Fig.\r\n34).[1356] A Græco-Roman copy discovered also in 1791, in Hadrian’s\r\nvilla, is in the British Museum (Fig. 35).[1357] Here the head,\r\nalthough antique, belongs to another copy, and has been set upon the\r\ntorso wrongly, in such a way that the throat has two Adam’s apples. It\r\nlooks straight to the ground and not upward as in the Lancellotti copy.\r\nThere is a better replica of the torso in the Capitoline Museum, which\r\nformerly belonged to the French sculptor Étienne Mounot (1658-1733),\r\nwho wrongly restored it as a falling warrior. It agrees in accuracy\r\nwith the Lancellotti copy, though it is dry and lifeless, and is a\r\nbetter guide to the original than either the Vatican or British Museum\r\nreplicas.[1358] A combination of these and other copies gives us an\r\nexcellent idea of the original bronze. In Pl. 23 we give a combination\r\nof the Vatican torso and the Lancellotti head from a cast in\r\nMunich.[1359] Perhaps a better combination is that given by Bulle[1360]\r\nfrom a cast made up of the delle Terme body, the Lancellotti head, the\r\nright arm and the diskos from the Casa Buonarroti in Florence, the feet\r\nfrom the British Museum copy and the fingers of the left hand being\r\nfreely restored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—Statue of the _Diskobolos_, after Myron.\r\nBritish Museum, London.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 23\r\n\r\nStatue of the _Diskobolos_, after Myron. A bronzed Cast from the Statue\r\nin the Vatican and Head from the Statue in the Palazzo Lancellotti,\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nThe pose of the Lancellotti copy agrees with Lucian’s description of\r\nthe original: “Surely, said I, you do not speak of the quoit-thrower\r\nwho stoops in the attitude of one who is making his cast, turning round\r\ntoward the hand that holds the quoit, and bending the other knee gently\r\nbeneath him, like one who will rise erect as he hurls the quoit?”[1361]\r\nThat the head of the original was turned back as in the Lancellotti\r\ncopy, and not downwards, as in the Vatican, British Museum and other\r\nreplicas, is shown by this description, which is corroborated by two\r\nbronze statuettes in Munich and Arolsen[1362] and by a gem in the\r\nBritish Museum.[1363] Myron chose the most difficult, but at the same\r\ntime the most characteristic, moment in swinging the diskos, the moment\r\nwhich combines the idea of rest and motion. The quoit has been swung\r\nback as far as it will go. The momentary pause before it is hurled\r\nforward suggests rest and at the same time implies motion, both that\r\nwhich has preceded and that which is to follow. It is this short pause\r\nat the end of the backward swing which the sculptor has fixed in the\r\nbronze. The right arm is stretched backwards as far as possible and\r\ndraws with it the body with the left arm and head; in another instant\r\nthe diskos will be hurled and the tension on the right leg relaxed.\r\nThe original statue rested upon the right foot; the tree trunk is\r\na necessary addition to the marble copies. As Greek art was mostly\r\ncharacterized by repose, we are not surprised that such a daring effect\r\nreceived the censure of the ancient critics. Quintilian says that if\r\nany one blames the statue for its labored effect, he is wrong, since\r\nthe novelty and the difficulty of the work are its chief merits.[1364]\r\nFor a statue of the transitional stage of Greek sculpture it is\r\nremarkably bold; only in imagination can we see the action by which\r\nthe body has got into this position and by which it will recover its\r\nequilibrium. It illustrates a principle laid down by Lessing in the\r\n_Laokoön_: “Of ever changing nature the artist can use only a single\r\nmoment and this from a single point of view. And as his work is meant\r\nto be looked at not for an instant, but with long consideration, he\r\nmust choose the most fruitful moment, and the most fruitful point of\r\nview, that, to wit, which leaves the power of imagination free.”[1365]\r\n\r\nMyron was the sculptor of five statues for four victors at Olympia,\r\none of a pancratiast, another of a boxer, a third of a runner, and\r\ntwo of a victor in the hoplite-race and the chariot-race.[1366] Pliny\r\nalso says that Myron made statues of pentathletes and pancratiasts\r\nat Delphi.[1367] Thus he showed as much versatility as Pythagoras in\r\nthe representation of victors in different contests. None of these\r\nstatues has survived and the identification of existing Roman copies\r\nwith any of them is, of course, highly problematical. Thus, a little\r\nfurther on we make the suggestion that the statue of the boxer in the\r\nLouvre, commonly known as _Pollux_ (Fig. 58), may be, because of its\r\nMyronian character, the statue of the unknown Arkadian boxer at Olympia\r\nmentioned by Pausanias (in connection with the boy boxer Philippos)\r\nas the work of Myron.[1368] Pliny, in the passage just cited, also\r\nmentions statues of _pristae_ by Myron, a word which has given rise to\r\nmany interpretations: _e. g._, sea-monsters (_pristes_ or _pistres_),\r\nmen working with a cross-cut saw (_pristae_), players at see-saw\r\n(_pristae_?),[1369] and boxers (_pyctae_).[1370] The manuscripts are\r\nunanimous for _pristae_, and hence it is probable that a realistic\r\ngroup by Myron is meant, since Myron is often classed as a realist in\r\nopposition to Polykleitos, the idealist. Long ago Dalecampius, followed\r\nin recent years by Furtwaengler,[1371] believed that these _pristae_\r\nformed a votive offering, and H. L. von Urlichs has shown that a group\r\nof sawyers as the dedication of some master-builder is quite in harmony\r\nwith fifth-century traditions.[1372] H. Stuart Jones[1373] connects\r\nthe words _Perseum et pristas_ of Pliny’s text, and follows the theory\r\nof Mayer[1374] that the carpenters or sawyers were a part of a group,\r\nwhich represented the inclosure of Danaë and Perseus in the chest.\r\n\r\nWhile the athletic statues in motion by Pythagoras and Myron became\r\nmodels for later sculptors, especially in the following century,[1375]\r\nthe rest statues of Polykleitos still remained in vogue in works by\r\nmembers of his family and school down through the fourth century, as we\r\nhave seen in our treatment of the Argive-Sikyonian sculptors at Olympia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTION STATUES REPRESENTING VICTORS IN VARIOUS CONTESTS.\r\n\r\nWe shall now review the types of victor statues, which reproduced in\r\ntheir pose the various contests, _i. e._, statues in motion. We shall\r\nfind it convenient to follow in the main the order of contests as\r\nthey appear on the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus[1376]—the stade-race (στάδιον),\r\ndouble race (δίαυλος), long race (δόλιχος), pentathlon (πένταθλον),\r\nwrestling, (πάλη), boxing (πύξ), pankration (παγκράτιον), hoplite-race\r\n(ὁπλίτης), chariot-race (τέθριππον), and horse-race (κέλης)—except that\r\nwe shall class the four running races (nos. 1, 2, 3, and 11) together\r\nand include the three boys’ contests (παίδων στάδιον, πάλη, πύξ, nos.\r\n8, 9, 10) under the corresponding men’s events. The classification of\r\ncompetitors by ages (ἡλικίαι), which varied at different festivals,\r\nwill need a word of explanation. While athletes at Nemea, the Isthmus,\r\nand Delphi were divided into three classes, παῖδες, ἀγένειοι, and\r\nἄνδρες,[1377] at Olympia they were divided into two, παῖδες and\r\nἄνδρες.[1378] At local competitions there was a more elaborate\r\nclassification. Thus at the Bœotian _Erotidia_, boys were divided\r\ninto younger and older;[1379] at the games held on the island of Chios\r\nthere were five divisions, boys, younger, middle, and older ephebes,\r\nand men;[1380] and at the Athenian _Theseia_, the boys were divided\r\ninto first, second, and third classes, while an open contest also\r\nexisted for boys of any age.[1381] Girls at the _Heraia_ at Olympia\r\nwere similarly divided into three classes.[1382] Plato proposed three\r\nclasses of athletes in his _Laws_—παιδικοί, ἄνδρες, and a third class,\r\nἀγένειοι, between boys and men.[1383] The classification of athletes\r\nat Athens into παῖδες and ἄνδρες, adopted by Boeckh, Dittenberger, and\r\nDumont,[1384] is now the one generally followed. According to it the\r\nπαῖδες were subdivided into three classes, those τῆς πρώτης ἡλικίας,\r\nτῆς δευτέρας, and τῆς τρίτης; and so the ἀγένειοι were merely the\r\nπαῖδες τῆς τρίτης ἡλικίας. The boys, including the ἀγένειοι, ranged\r\nfrom 12 to 18 years old; at 18 they became ἔφηβοι or ἄνδρες.[1385] We\r\nhave already seen that the age of boy victors at Olympia was over 17\r\nand under 20.[1386]\r\n\r\nAs we have already remarked in an earlier chapter, we are mostly\r\nindebted to Pausanias for our knowledge of the victor statues at\r\nOlympia.[1387] He mentions in his _periegesis_ of the Altis 192\r\nmonuments, which were erected to 187 victors.[1388] Some of these\r\nvictors won in more than one contest, so that there are 258 different\r\nvictories recorded in all. In the following sections we shall see how\r\nthese were distributed among the various contests.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNERS: STADIODROMOI, DIAULODROMOI, DOLICHODROMOI.\r\n\r\nRunning races formed at all times a part of the Greek games and of\r\nthe exercises of the youth in the gymnasia and palæstræ. A scholiast\r\non Pindar[1389] says that the running race had its origin in the\r\nfirst celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries. It figures largely in\r\nmythology, especially at Olympia, which also shows its antiquity.[1390]\r\nIn historic times many varieties of running developed, but four chief\r\nones were practised at the great games.[1391] First there was the\r\nsimple stade-race (στάδιον, δρόμος), which was merely the length of\r\nthe stadion or 600 Greek feet, corresponding with the running race of\r\nHomer.[1392] Then there was the double race (δίαυλος), twice as long as\r\nthe preceding, to the end of the course and back again.[1393] The long\r\nrace (δόλιχος, ὁ μακρὸς δρόμος), which Philostratos derives from the\r\ninstitution of messenger runners (_hemerodromoi_),[1394] is variously\r\ngiven as seven, twelve, fourteen, twenty, and twenty-four stades in\r\nlength, _i. e._, from about four-fifths of a mile to nearly three\r\nmiles.[1395] Lastly there was the race in armor (ὁπλιτοδρόμος,[1396]\r\nὁπλίτης,[1397] ἀσπίς.[1398]) The long race was instituted not so much\r\nas a contest of fleetness as of endurance. At Olympia only men were\r\nadmitted, though there was such a race for boys at Delphi.[1399] The\r\nCretans were famed in this style of running.[1400] The race in armor,\r\nwhich was a double race or two stades at Olympia, we shall discuss\r\nfurther on. Probably the boys’ stade-race at Olympia was shorter than\r\nthat of the men. Plato, who gives the historic division of running\r\nraces outlined above, has the boys run one-half of the men’s course\r\nand the ephebes (ἀγένειοι) two-thirds.[1401] Just so Pausanias has\r\nthe girl runners at the Olympia _Heraia_ run one-sixth of the men’s\r\nstadion.[1402]\r\n\r\nAt Olympia, as at the _Panathenaia_ in Athens and probably elsewhere,\r\nthe first event preceding all others was the stade-race. Pausanias says\r\nthat it was the oldest event at Olympia,[1403] and it existed there all\r\nthrough antiquity from the first recorded Olympiad (= 776 B. C.), when\r\nKoroibos of Elis won.[1404] But the notion generally held[1405] that\r\nthe stade-race for men was honored above all other events at Olympia,\r\nbecause the winner became ἐπώνυμος for the Olympiad and because his\r\nname occurs in the lists of Africanus for every Olympiad, is incorrect.\r\nIn two passages Thukydides cites Olympic pancratiasts for dates,[1406]\r\nand in the earliest inscription which makes use of Olympiads for\r\nchronology the later introduced pankration is the event used.[1407]\r\nThe literary supremacy of Athens, where, at the _Panathenaia_, the\r\nstade-race was the most important event, doubtless helped later in\r\nmaking the stade runner at Olympia eponymous. This custom, however, was\r\nnot generally employed before the third century B. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Athletic Scenes from a Bacchic Amphora in Rome.\r\nA. Stadiodromoi and Leaper. B. Diskobolos and Akontistai.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—Athletic Scenes from a Sixth-century B. C.\r\nPanathenaic Amphora. Stadiodromoi (left) and Dolichodromoi (right).]\r\n\r\nPausanias dates the introduction of the double foot-race at Olympia\r\nin Ol. 14 (= 724 B. C.).[1408] He does not say when the long race\r\nwas instituted, but Eusebios says that it was in Ol. 15 (= 720 B.\r\nC.).[1409] The boys’ stade-race was introduced there in Ol. 37 (= 632\r\nB. C.).[1410] The hoplite-race was inaugurated at the end of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., in Ol. 65 (= 520 B. C.).[1411] Pausanias mentions 24\r\n_stadiodromoi_ at Olympia, who won 32 victories, which makes this\r\nevent third in importance, next after boxing and wrestling. He mentions\r\n7 victors in the double race with 11 victories, and 5 victors in the\r\nlong race with 8 victories. He also mentions 12 hoplite victors with 14\r\nvictories. Consequently, in all four running events there, he records\r\n48 victors with 65 victories, which brings the running races only to\r\nsecond place in importance at Olympia, ranking next after boxing.[1412]\r\nThe ordinary sprinter or _stadiodromos_, and the double sprinter,\r\n_diaulodromos_ or _hoplitodromos_, naturally ran differently from the\r\nendurance runner or _dolichodromos_. Panathenaic vases clearly show\r\nthis difference. Thus while the sprinter swung his arms violently,\r\nspreading the fingers apart and touching the ground only with his\r\ntoes[1413] (Figs. 36A and 37, left), the endurance runner, who had to\r\nconserve his strength to the last, ran with a long stride, holding\r\nhis arms bent at the elbow and close to the body, his fists doubled\r\nand his body slightly bent forward, its weight resting on the ball\r\nof the foot, the heel being raised only a little. Thus Philostratos\r\nsays that the _dolichodromoi_ ran with their hands extended and with\r\ntheir fists balled, but that at the finish they also swung their arms\r\nviolently like wings.[1414] The race (showing balled fists) is seen\r\non a Panathenaic amphora dating from the archonship of Nikeratos\r\n(333 B. C.), now in the British Museum, and on another of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., pictured in Fig. 37 (right).[1415] In the _diaulos_ the\r\nmovement was less violent. Thus on an Athens vase inscribed, “I am a\r\ndiaulos runner,”[1416] the movement is between that of a sprinter and\r\nan endurance runner. It seems probable that this difference in the\r\nstyle of running was similarly shown in sculpture.[1417] We shall next\r\nconsider certain sculptural monuments which represent runners.\r\n\r\nThe typical scheme for archaic and archaistic art was to represent the\r\nrunner with one knee nearly touching the ground, the upper log forming\r\na right angle with the lower, the other leg being perpendicular to the\r\nupper. This scheme appears on many vases and reliefs and in statuettes\r\nand statues.[1418] This old method of depicting runners was kept up\r\nby vase-painters down to the time of the red-figured masters.[1419]\r\nWe see them on many reliefs, _e. g._, on the Ionic-Greek reliefs on\r\nthe three archaic bronze tripods of the middle of the sixth century\r\nB. C. in the possession of Mr. James Loeb;[1420] on a small bronze\r\nrelief in the Metropolitan Museum in New York which represents a\r\nwinged Boreas;[1421] and on the marble funerary stele of the so-called\r\ndying hoplite runner found in 1902 near the Theseion, and now in the\r\nNational Museum in Athens.[1422] Almost the same position as that of\r\nthe figure on this Athenian relief is seen in a small bronze in the\r\nMetropolitan Museum, whose primitive features and solidly massed hair\r\ndate it in the early part of the sixth century B. C.[1423] Another\r\nslightly larger bronze in the same museum represents Herakles running\r\nin a kneeling posture.[1424] Because a spearman is incongruous behind\r\na bowman, Kalkmann[1425] and Furtwaengler[1426] have interpreted the\r\ntwo kneeling figures near either end of the West gable of the temple on\r\nAegina as archaic runners (see Fig. 21, left). We may further compare\r\nwith these figures the positions, though not the motives, of two others\r\nfrom the West gable at Olympia,[1427] as well as that of the kneeling\r\nbowman _Herakles_ from the East gable of the temple on Aegina.[1428] In\r\nthis connection we shall also mention the life-size marble torso of\r\na kneeling youth found in Nero’s villa at Subiaco in 1884 and now in\r\nthe Museo delle Terme, Rome (Pl. 24).[1429] This statue, representing\r\na boy of delicate build apparently striding forward with the right leg\r\nand bending the left so that the knee nearly touches the ground, has\r\nbeen regarded by some scholars[1430] as a runner, whose pose copies\r\nthe archaic manner, being historically the last example known of its\r\nuse in sculpture. The right shoulder is turned backward and the head,\r\nnow missing, was turned back and upwards; the right arm is raised high\r\nand twisted about with the palm of the hand facing backward, the left\r\narm extended with its hand in some way related to the right knee. The\r\nimpression made on the spectator is that of a boy bending aside as if\r\nto ward off some danger. It is an excellent piece of work, evidently\r\nthe marble copy of an original bronze. This has been variously\r\nassigned to the fifth, fourth, and even later centuries B. C.,[1431]\r\nand interpreted in various ways[1432]—as a Niobid,[1433] as Ganymedes\r\nswooped down upon by the eagle,[1434] as Hylas drawn into the water by\r\nnymphs when he was filling his pitcher,[1435] as a ball-player,[1436]\r\nas a boy throwing a lasso,[1437] as a gable figure,[1438] as a runner\r\nat the games, etc. Many of these interpretations are purely fanciful;\r\nthe last is, perhaps, as good as any, though the strongly turned upper\r\nbody seems not quite fitted to it. If it represents a runner, the\r\nsculptor has reproduced the well-known archaic pose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUE OF THE RUNNER LADAS.\r\n\r\nWe shall next consider the famous statue of the runner Ladas by Myron,\r\nwhich is unfortunately known to us only from literary evidence, but\r\nwhich attained in antiquity an even greater fame than his nameless\r\n_Diskobolos_, since it portrayed even more tension than that wonderful\r\nwork. Its fame was partly due to the picturesque story how the victory\r\ncost the runner his life, for he died of strain while on his way home\r\nto Sparta; it was also due in no less degree to the striking way in\r\nwhich the victor was depicted.[1439]\r\n\r\nTwo fourth-century epigrams tell us of the statue. The first of these\r\nruns:\r\n\r\n  Λάδας τὸ στάδιον εἴθ’ ἥλατο, εἴτε διέπτη,\r\n  οὐδὲ φράσαι δυνατόν· δαιμόνιον τὸ τάχος.\r\n  [ὁ ψόφος ἦν ὕσπληγγος ἐν οὔασι, καὶ στεφανοῦτο\r\n  Λάδας καὶ κάμνων δάκτυλον οὐ προέβη.][1440]\r\n\r\nThe second epigram, naming Myron as the sculptor, runs:\r\n\r\n  Οἷος ἔης φεύγων τὸν ὑπήνεμον, ἔμπνοε Λάδα,\r\n  Θῦμον, ἐπ’ ἀκροτάτῳ πνεύματι θεὶς ὄνυχα,\r\n  τοῖον ἐχάλκευσέν σε Μύρων, ἐπὶ παντὶ χαράξας\r\n  σώματι Πισαίου προσδοκίην στεφάνου.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 24\r\n\r\nStatue of a Kneeling Youth, from Subiaco. Museo delle Terme, Rome.]\r\n\r\nTo these verses are added the following, which Benndorf thinks belonged\r\nto another epigram on the same statue:\r\n\r\n  πλήρης ἐλπίδος ἐστίν, ἄκροις δ’ ἐπὶ χείλεσιν ἆσθμα\r\n  ἐμφαίνει κοίλων ἔνδοθεν ἐκ λαγόνων.\r\n  πηδήσει τάχα χαλκὸς ἐπὶ στέφος, οὐδὲ καθέξει\r\n  ἁ βάσις· ὢ τέχνη πνεύματος ὠκυτέρα.[1441]\r\n\r\nProfessor Ernest Gardner translates the two parts of the second epigram\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“Like as thou wast in life, Ladas, breathing forth thy panting\r\nsoul,[1442] on tip-toe, with every sinew at full strain, such hath\r\nMyron wrought thee in bronze, stamping on thy whole body thy eagerness\r\nfor the victor’s crown of Pisa.”\r\n\r\n“He is filled with hope, and you may see the breath caught on his lips\r\nfrom deep within his flanks; surely the bronze will leave its pedestal\r\nand leap to the crown. Such art is swifter than the wind.”[1443]\r\n\r\nEven if part of the epigram is rhetorical, we can not doubt that Ladas\r\nwas represented in the final spurt just before he arrived at the goal.\r\nHis eagerness was not confined to the face—though the panting breath\r\ncould have been indicated by half opened lips, but was visible in the\r\nwhole body.[1444] Whereas the girl runner of the Vatican (Pl. 2) is\r\nrepresented at the beginning of the race, Myron’s statue represented\r\nLadas at the end of it. Probably the victor was represented with his\r\nweight thrown on the advanced foot and with the arms close to the sides\r\nand bent at the elbows—a treatment which would have been easy for the\r\nsculptor of the _Diskobolos_. Mahler tried to identify the statue with\r\none of the Naples group of so-called runners (Fig. 51).[1445] However,\r\nas we shall see, these probably represent wrestlers, and not runners,\r\nand neither of them shows any such tension as we should expect from the\r\ndescription of the statue of Ladas. Though Foerster believes that the\r\nstatue of Ladas stood in Olympia, in honor of his victory in the long\r\nrace there,[1446] we can not say definitely where it was.[1447]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—Statue of a Runner. Palazzo dei Conservatori,\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—Statue of a Runner. Palazzo dei Conservatori,\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps our best representation of runners is to be seen in the two\r\nmarble statues discovered near Velletri and now in the Palazzo dei\r\nConservatori, Rome (Figs. 38 and 39).[1448] The hair and the sharp\r\nedges of the modeling of the flesh, as well as the tree-stumps near the\r\nright legs, show that these statues are copies of bronze originals.\r\nThey were at first interpreted as runners, but later were regarded as\r\nforming a group of wrestlers, who were standing opposite one another\r\nand holding their hands out for an opening. However, there is nothing\r\nin the pose or the expression of these statues to show the tension\r\nof two opponents. Moreover, they certainly never formed a group,\r\nfor stylistic differences reveal that they are copies of statues by\r\ndifferent artists who lived at different times; one belongs to the\r\nsevere style of the last quarter of the fifth century,[1449] while\r\nthe other, with its softer forms, smaller head, and deeper-set eyes,\r\nis a product of the fourth century B. C.[1450] The prominent edge\r\nof the chest is doubtless meant to indicate the hard breathing of a\r\nrunner.[1451] Just in front of the tree-stump on the older statue is to\r\nbe seen a round hole in the plinth, which may have been made for the\r\nend of a club held in the right hand, as such an object is found in\r\nother works of art, notably in a statuette from Palermo, which is the\r\ncopy of a fifth-century B. C. original, and on a second-century B. C.\r\ngrave-stele from Crete.[1452] Its use, however, is not certainly known.\r\n\r\nFurtwaengler, by an ingenious process of reasoning, argued that he\r\nhad recovered an actual statue of an Olympic runner in the so-called\r\n_Alkibiades_, formerly in the Villa Mattei, but now in the Sala della\r\nBiga of the Vatican.[1453] This torso he ascribed to the sculptor\r\nKresilas, because of its likeness to the _Perikles_ of that master,\r\nwhich once stood on the Akropolis,[1454] and to a marble torso in\r\nNaples representing a wounded man ready to fall, which he thinks\r\nis a copy of the _Volneratus deficiens_ of Kresilas mentioned by\r\nPliny.[1455] The _Alkibiades_ is very similar to the Naples gladiator,\r\nthough later in date; the bearded head, drawn-in stomach, and muscular\r\nchest, and the veins in the upper arm are common to both. The restorer\r\nof the Vatican statue has placed a helmet under the right foot. But the\r\ndeep-breathing chest may indicate a runner, as we saw in the case of\r\nthe statues of the Conservatori just discussed. Furtwaengler has the\r\nbody bend further forward, so that the right foot may rest upon the\r\nground and the glance be fixed upon the goal, with the arms extended\r\nat the elbows, a position proved for the right arm, at least, by the\r\n_puntello_ above the hip. As the head shows portrait-like features and\r\nonly those athletes who had won three victories had portrait statues,\r\nhe has identified the original of the _Alkibiades_ with the statue\r\nof the famous stade-runner Krison of Himera, who won his victories\r\nat Olympia just after the middle of the fifth century B. C., the\r\napproximate date of the Vatican copy.[1456] Such an identification\r\nappears, however, to be too far-fetched to be convincing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUES OF BOY RUNNERS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—Statue of the _Thorn-puller_ (_Spinario_).\r\nPalazzo dei Conservatori, Rome.]\r\n\r\nProbably the statues of boy runners did not differ essentially from\r\nthose of men. That they were sometimes represented in motion is shown\r\nby the footprints on the recovered base of the statue of Sosikrates\r\nby an unknown artist. Here the right foot touched the ground only\r\nwith the front portion.[1457] The view has often been expressed that\r\nthe bronze statue in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, known as\r\nthe _Spinario_ (_Thorn-puller_) portrays a runner (Fig. 40).[1458]\r\nIt represents a boy, from twelve to fifteen years old, seated upon a\r\nrock bending over and engrossed in extracting a thorn from his left\r\nfoot, which rests upon the right knee. The severe hair treatment, low\r\nforehead, full cheeks, and strong chin appear to show the ideal beauty\r\nof a boy of the period of about 460 B. C. The motive seems to have been\r\ninspired directly by nature—witness the supple bend of the back, the\r\ndelicate arms, the naïve, though not too realistic, concentration of\r\ninterest in the act portrayed. Few pieces of ancient sculpture have\r\ngiven rise to more discussion and extraordinary difference of opinion\r\nthan this popular work. One school of archæologists[1459] believes\r\nit a late adaptation of a Hellenistic original, a more accurate copy\r\nbeing the one in the British Museum, and consequently views it as a\r\npurely _genre_ statue impossible of conception before Alexander’s time.\r\nAccording to this view the London copy was an archaistic work of the\r\ntime of Pasiteles. Another school, however, including Helbig, Wolters,\r\nKekulé, and many others, sees in the Roman statue an original work\r\nof 460 to 450 B. C., chiefly because the face shows great similarity\r\nto those of the statues of the Olympia gables (especially to that of\r\nApollo)[1460]. According to this view the statue can not have been\r\na _genre_ work, as such works of decorative character were of later\r\norigin, but the motive must be sought in some definite incident—in\r\nsome myth or historical event. Thus it has been referred to the\r\ncolonization of the Ozolian Lokroi, whose ancestor Lokros is said to\r\nhave got a thorn in his foot and to have founded cities near where\r\nthis occurred in fulfilment of an oracle. Many others, on the other\r\nhand, have seen in its motive that of a boy victor in running, who has\r\ngained his victory despite a thorn, which he is now pulling out, and\r\nwho has dedicated his statue to commemorate both the victory and the\r\nuntoward circumstances under which it was won. It has been assigned to\r\nvarious sculptors and schools—to Myron, Pythagoras, and Kalamis, and\r\nto Peloponnesian, Bœotian, and even Sicilian art.[1461] The boy’s\r\nabsorption in his task certainly reminds us of the concentration so\r\ncharacteristic of the _Diskobolos_ of Myron. In determining its age\r\nand artistic affiliations several things must be considered. In the\r\nfirst place, the Roman statue is a copy, as the rock on which the boy\r\nsits is cast with the figure, which would have been impossible in the\r\nfifth century B. C. The long hair on this copy, which is short on\r\nthe one in the British Museum, falls down the neck, but not over the\r\ncheeks, as it should on a head which is thus bent downwards. Pasiteles\r\nalmost certainly would have tied it with a ribbon. This shows that the\r\noriginal was the work of an artist who was used to making standing\r\nstatues, and was not aware of the change in the representation of\r\nthe hair brought about by drooping ones. Such considerations, in\r\nconjunction with the archaic facial characteristics, almost certainly\r\nrefer the original work to the fifth century B. C., a date when _genre_\r\nstatues, produced for adornment, did not exist. Consequently a definite\r\nincident must be represented by it, and it is quite possible that this\r\nincident should be sought in athletic sculpture in the representation\r\nof a boy runner.\r\n\r\nThe _Thorn-puller_ became a model for many imitations from the\r\nbeginning of Hellenistic times on. These imitations tended to greater\r\nrealism and consequently to the debasement of the original conception,\r\nfor they were made to represent peasants, shepherds, satyrs, and even\r\nnegroes. The _motif_ was also transferred to figures of girls, as,\r\n_e. g._, in the fragment of a terra-cotta statuette found in 1912 at\r\nNida-Haddernheim.[1462] In the early Empire it was frequently copied\r\nin marble, and again, during the Renaissance, the motive was used for\r\nsmall bronzes.[1463] Of Hellenistic copies, showing how the motive\r\ndeteriorated, we shall mention only two: the marble one found on the\r\nEsquiline, in 1874, and known as the Castellani copy, now in the\r\nBritish Museum,[1464] the sculptor of which has made it into a truly\r\n_genre_ fountain figure by transforming the noble features of the\r\nbeautiful Greek runner into the snub nose and thick lips of a street\r\nArab, and the still later bronze statuette found near Sparta and now\r\nin the Paris collection of Baron Edmund de Rothschild,[1465] which\r\nrepresents the boy extracting the thorn in anger.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the so-called _Sandal-binder_—with replicas in Paris (Fig.\r\n8), London, Athens, Munich, and elsewhere, has been looked upon,\r\nwithout decisive grounds, to be sure, as a runner who is tying on his\r\nsandals after the race.[1466] We have already discussed this statue in\r\nChapter II, in connection with the subject of assimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPLITODROMOI.\r\n\r\nThe race in armor had a practical value in the training of soldiers,\r\nand so became a popular sport, since it appealed not only to the\r\ntrained athlete, but to the citizen in general. It belonged to “mixed\r\nathletics,”[1467] _i. e._, to competitions which were conducted under\r\nhandicap conditions, such as our obstacle races, and consequently\r\nit never attained the prestige of the strictly athletic events. It\r\ncame last among the gymnic contests at Olympia and elsewhere,[1468]\r\nbeing followed by the equestrian events. It seems to have varied in\r\ndifferent places in the distance run, in the armor of the runner, and\r\nin the rules which governed the race. At Olympia, as at Athens, it\r\nappears to have been a _diaulos_ or a race of two stadia.[1469] The\r\nmost strenuous race of the sort was run at the _Eleutheria_ at Platæa,\r\nwhere the contestants were completely enveloped in armor[1470] and were\r\nsubject to peculiar rules. At Olympia the competitors originally ran\r\nwith helmets, greaves, and round shields, as we infer from scenes on\r\narchaic vases and from the statement of Pausanias that the statue of\r\nthe first victor in this event, Damaretos of Heraia, was represented\r\nwith these arms.[1471] In this passage Pausanias adds that the Eleans\r\nand other Greeks later (ἀνὰ χρόνον) gave up the greaves, and we find\r\nthat they disappear on the vase-paintings.[1472] Hauser has shown that\r\nthe vase-paintings, which, however, mostly illustrate the Athenian\r\npractice, display a varied custom in respect of the use of the greaves\r\nbefore about 520 B. C., the general use of them until about 450 B.\r\nC., and after that date their disuse.[1473] The helmet disappeared\r\nafter the greaves, but the shield was never given up.[1474] Thus the\r\nbronze statue of Mnesiboulos of Elateia, a victor (σὺν τῇ ἀσπίδι) of\r\nPausanias’ day, which stood in “Runner Street” of his native city,\r\nappears to have been represented with the shield.[1475] It was for this\r\nreason that the event was later sometimes called merely ἀσπίς.[1476]\r\nThe shields that appear on the vases are always round and the helmets\r\nare Attic.[1477] The gradual reduction in the amount of the armor may\r\nhave been a concession to the regular athletes, who probably looked\r\nupon the contest as a spurious sort of athletics. As for the style of\r\nthe race, the hoplite runners seem to have run somewhat as the stade\r\nand double-course runners, _i. e._, with their right hands up and their\r\narms violently swinging.[1478]\r\n\r\nThe picturesqueness of such a race appealed especially to\r\nvase-painters, who have given us all the details of the event. The\r\npreparations for the race are seen on a red-figured kylix from Vulci,\r\nnow in Paris, ascribed to Euphronios (Panaitios), on which one\r\nrunner is donning his armor, while others are practising preliminary\r\nruns.[1479] The start is seen in the right-hand figure depicted on a\r\nr.-f. kylix in Berlin (Fig. 41, a).[1480] On another r.-f. kylix we see\r\na pair of hoplites, one slowing up before reaching the central post,\r\nthe other turning it.[1481] The finish is seen on an obscene r.-f.\r\nkylix from Vulci in the style of Brygos, in the British Museum, where\r\nthe bearded winner, with his helmet in his hand, looks back on his\r\nrival, and the latter, apparently in disgust, drops his shield.[1482]\r\nThe most complete illustration of the race is to be seen on the r.-f.\r\nBerlin kylix just mentioned (Fig. 41, a, b, c.) Here on one side is a\r\ngroup of three runners; the right-hand one is bending over, ready to\r\nstart; the one at the left is about to turn the central post, and the\r\none in the centre, who is turned in an opposite direction, is on the\r\nhome stretch; on the other side of the vase are three runners in full\r\ncourse, while another appears on the interior of the vase.[1483] Some\r\nvases seem to show that the contest often had a semi-comic character,\r\nthe variations in running being used to amuse the spectators. Thus\r\nthe shield might be dropped and picked up again,[1484] or it might be\r\nheld in a peculiar manner.[1485] This comic element is brought out in\r\nthe _Aves_ of Aristophanes, in a scene in which Peisthetairos, while\r\nobserving the chorus of birds advancing with their crests (λόφωσις),\r\ncompares them with hoplite runners advancing to begin the race.[1486]\r\nThe regular painter outdid the vase-painter in representing the runner\r\nin violent motion, if we may rely on Pliny’s description of two\r\npaintings of hoplites by Parrhasios.[1487] In one of these the runner\r\nwas represented as perspiring as he ran, while in the other he was\r\nrepresented as having laid aside his arms and panting so realistically\r\nthat the observer seemed to hear him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—Hoplitodromes. Scenes from a r.-f. Kylix.\r\nMuseum of Berlin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—Bronze Statuette of a Hoplitodrome (?).\r\nUniversity Museum, Tuebingen.]\r\n\r\nWe have few representations of hoplitodromes in sculpture. In the\r\npreceding chapter we discussed the two marble helmeted heads found at\r\nOlympia (Fig. 30), one of which shows that the statue of which it was a\r\npart was represented at rest, while the other, because of the twist in\r\nthe neck, seems to have come from a statue which represented the runner\r\nin violent motion. Pausanias saw on the Athenian Akropolis the statue\r\nof the hoplite runner Epicharinos, the work of the sculptor Kritios,\r\nrepresented as practising starts (ὁπλιτοδρομεῖν ἀσκήσαντος).[1488] In\r\nthe well-known Tux bronze in the University Museum at Tuebingen, we\r\nhave a statuette in which the position of the statue of Epicharinos is\r\nprobably reproduced. This little bronze, which is only 0.16 meter tall\r\n(Fig. 42),[1489] represents a bearded man, entirely nude, except for\r\nthe Attic helmet on his head, standing with feet close together, knees\r\nslightly bent, and body inclined forward. The right arm is extended,\r\nwhile the left, crooked at the elbow, rests upon the hip. While Schwabe\r\nand Wolters, following the early theory of Hirt and of the sculptor\r\nDannecker, interpreted the bronze as the figure of a charioteer,\r\nwhose left hand was drawn back to hold the reins and whose right was\r\noutstretched in a gesture intended to quiet the horses, Hauser, de\r\nRidder, Bulle, and many other archæologists have interpreted it better\r\nas a hoplitodrome. The left arm, then, carried a round shield, such\r\nas we have seen on Attic vases. The next moment the right leg will be\r\nadvanced, the shield, held back to get a better start, will be pushed\r\nforward, and the runner will race to the goal in a series of leaps,\r\nsince the weight of the shield would prevent him from following the\r\nmore regular motion of the ordinary runner. It probably represents,\r\ntherefore, a hoplite runner, not in the actual course, as Hauser\r\nthought, but practicing a preliminary start, as de Ridder argued. If\r\nthe figure represented a charioteer, the legs would have been set\r\nfarther apart, in order to give a firmer position, and it would not be\r\nrepresented as standing on a base, nor would it be wearing a helmet.\r\nThe statuette stylistically belongs to the opening years of the fifth\r\ncentury B. C., and may well be a free imitation of a life-size original\r\nof such statues of hoplites as stood in the Altis at Olympia. Despite\r\nthe energy depicted in this figure, it is rash to connect it with the\r\nAeginetan sculptures, as Wolters and Collignon have done, since a\r\ncomparison between it and the _Champion_ of the East gable[1490] will\r\nshow great differences. Brunn ascribed the original to Pythagoras; de\r\nRidder, with reservations, to Kritios and Nesiotes; while Bulle is more\r\nreasonable in referring it to an important though unnamed artist of the\r\nearly fifth century B. C.\r\n\r\nHartwig has published a bronze statuette from Capua,[1491] now in\r\nthe Imperial collection at Vienna, representing a nude youth with a\r\ncrested helmet on his head. There is no trace of a shield, but the\r\nhelmet and the similarity of the pose to that of the Tuebingen bronze\r\nmake it probable that this statuette also represents a hoplitodrome\r\nstarting. The so-called _Diomedes_ of Myronian style in the Palazzo\r\nValentini, Rome,[1492] whose stooping posture recalls the _Diskobolos_\r\nand accordingly has been interpreted as one by Matz and von Duhn, more\r\nprobably also represents a hoplite-runner, as Furtwaengler maintained,\r\nbecause of the similarity of its pose to that of the Tux bronze and\r\nbecause of its helmeted head.[1493]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—Statue of the so-called _Borghese Warrior_.\r\nLouvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nSome other attempts to see hoplite runners in existing works of\r\nsculpture have not been so successful. Thus Rayet’s attempt to\r\nresuscitate the old interpretation of Quatremère de Quincy, who had\r\nexplained the statue of the so-called _Borghese Warrior_ by Agasias of\r\nEphesos (Fig. 43) as that of a hoplitodrome just before reaching the\r\ngoal, has been recently revived again by Six.[1494] This famous marble\r\nstatue of the Louvre, belonging to late Greek art, is an example of the\r\nlast development in the Argive-Sikyonian school, which for centuries\r\nhad been devoted to athletic sculpture.[1495] Since the statue has\r\nno helmet, there seems to be no valid reason for not adhering to the\r\nusual interpretation, according to which it represents a warrior—by\r\nrestoring the lost right arm and hand with a sword—who is defending\r\nhimself against a foe above him, conceived of as seated upon a horse.\r\nThe attitude and the upward gaze are certainly not those of a runner.\r\nThough Collignon, following Visconti, believes the figure to be one\r\nof a group, the man actually defending himself against a horseman and\r\ncovering himself with his shield as he looks up, it is doubtful whether\r\na second figure ever existed. The artist seems to have contented\r\nhimself with representing, not a fight, but only a fighting pose. We\r\nare beginning to understand that the Greek sculptor left something to\r\nthe imagination of the beholder.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has also been made to see a dying hoplite runner in the\r\nParian marble archaic grave-relief in the National Museum in Athens,\r\nwhich has already been mentioned as an example of the archaic scheme\r\nof representing running.[1496] It represents a beardless youth running\r\nin a half-kneeling posture, even though the head is bent and turned\r\nin the opposite direction. The eyes appear to be closed—due, perhaps,\r\nto the faulty sculptor—and the two hands are touching the breast.\r\nWhile no shield is represented (it is contended that its presence\r\nwould nearly hide the figure), still, because of the helmet and the\r\nposition of the arm, which latter is obviously that of a long-distance\r\nrunner, Philios, followed by Perrot-Chipiez and Bulle, explained it\r\nas the representation of a hoplite runner who is expiring at the end\r\nof his course. They date it about 520 B. C.,[1497] the date of the\r\nintroduction of this race at Olympia. However, the absence of the\r\nshield, to say nothing of the greaves, seems an insuperable objection\r\nto such an hypothesis, as the shield was never omitted in this race,\r\nbut was invariably its symbol. Svoronos is therefore more probably\r\nright in interpreting the relief as the monument of a military runner\r\n(δρομοκῆρυξ), even if his dating (490-480 B. C.) is somewhat too\r\nlate,[1498] and if his identifying it with some particular messenger\r\n(such as the Athenian runner Pheidippides, who ran to Sparta for aid\r\njust prior to the battle of Marathon) is fanciful.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTATHLETES.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar features of the pentathlon (πένταθλον) were the three\r\nevents, jumping, diskos-throwing, and javelin-throwing. All five events\r\nare summed up in Simonides’ epigram on the pentathlete Diophon, who\r\nwon at Delphi and on the Isthmus, the second line of which runs: ἅλμα,\r\nποδωκείην, δίσκον, ἄκοντα, πάλην.[1499]\r\n\r\nThe pentathlon did not exist in Homer’s time. Pindar expressly says\r\nthat it did not exist in heroic days, but that then a separate prize\r\nwas given for each feat.[1500] At the games on Scheria, King Alkinoos\r\nboasts to Odysseus of the superiority of his countrymen in πύξ τε\r\nπαλαισμοσύνῃ τε καὶ ἅλμασιν ἠδὲ πόδεσσιν.[1501] The pentathlon for\r\nmen was introduced at Olympia at the same time as wrestling toward\r\nthe end of the eighth century, in Ol. 18 (= 708 B. C.),[1502] and the\r\npentathlon for boys eighty years later, in Ol. 38 (= 628 B. C.), only\r\nto be stopped soon after.[1503] Pausanias mentions fifteen victors\r\nat Olympia, who had statues erected in their honor, for seventeen\r\nvictories in the pentathlon, thus giving the pentathletes sixth rank\r\nthere in point of number.\r\n\r\nThe b.-f. Bacchic amphora in Rome already discussed represents four\r\nevents out of the five: running, leaping, diskos-throwing, and\r\nakontion-throwing (Figs. 36 A and 36 B).[1504] On several Panathenaic\r\nvases we find one or more events, and the three characteristic ones on\r\nseveral, one of which we here reproduce (Fig. 44).[1505]\r\n\r\nThe various events are common on r.-f. vases,[1506] though these may\r\nnot represent the pentathlon contests, but merely gymnasium scenes,\r\nshowing that such contests were important. We have already said that\r\nthe pentathlon represented the whole physical training of Greek\r\nyouths; consequently the pentathlete was looked upon as the typical\r\nathlete, being superior to all others in all-round development, even\r\nif surpassed by them in certain special events. It was for this reason\r\nthat Polykleitos, in order to embody the principles of his athlete\r\ncanon, made a statue of a javelin-thrower (the _Doryphoros_) as the\r\nbest example of an all-round man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—Pentathletes. Scene from a Panathenaic Amphora\r\nin the British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nNone of the statues of pentathletes at Olympia has been recovered\r\nwith certainty in Roman copies. That some of them were represented\r\nat rest is shown by the base of the statue of the victor Pythokles\r\nof Elis, by the elder Polykleitos, which has been recovered.[1507]\r\nThis base supported two different statues in succession. The feet of\r\nthe earlier one by Polykleitos were riveted into circular holes, and\r\nbehind the right foot on the upper surface of the base was inscribed\r\nthe artist’s name, while the victor’s appeared on the vertical front.\r\nThis statue was later removed and was replaced by another, whose pose\r\nwas different, as we see from the footmarks, which show that the feet\r\nwere attached with lead in hollows. Probably the old inscription was\r\nrenewed in archaic letters when this second statue was set up, the\r\nolder letters being retained, perhaps, to conceal the theft. The\r\noriginal statue was removed by the first century B. C., or perhaps\r\nunder Nero;[1508] the new one was also inscribed as the work of\r\nPolykleitos. A base of the Hadrianic or Antonine age has been found in\r\nRome, inscribed with the names Polykleitos and Pythokles.[1509] Since\r\nthe footmarks do not agree with those of either one of the Olympia\r\nstatues, Petersen believes that the existing footmarks are due to an\r\nolder use of the base and that they have nothing to do with the statue\r\nof Pythokles. Perhaps the statue on the Roman base was the original\r\none by Polykleitos removed from Olympia to Rome, though it is possible\r\nthat it was only a copy, the original being elsewhere in Rome. While\r\nthe later statue at Olympia had the feet squarely on the ground, the\r\noriginal one stood on the right foot, the left being drawn back and\r\nturned out, touching the ground only with the ball. Hence the left\r\nknee must have turned outwards, a natural position, if the head of\r\nthe statue was turned slightly to the left. In other words, this is\r\nthe usual Polykleitan scheme. Furtwaengler has made a strong though\r\nhardly convincing attempt to identify this original statue with a copy\r\nsurviving in two replicas at Rome and Munich, which, as he believes,\r\nfit the conditions of the statue of Pythokles.[1510] These copies\r\nrepresent a nude youth standing with the weight of the body on the\r\nright leg, the left drawn back and outwards. The head is turned to\r\nthe left, the right arm is held close to the side (the hand, perhaps,\r\nonce holding a fillet), and the left forearm is outstretched from the\r\nelbow and holds an aryballos in the hand. The two works are manifestly\r\nPolykleitan in style—the body, head, and hair treatment resembling that\r\nof the _Doryphoros_. He assumed that the feet corresponded in scale\r\nwith the footmarks on the Olympia base.\r\n\r\nHelbig, in the first edition of his _Fuehrer_, recognized the kinship\r\nbetween the Vatican statuette and the _Doryphoros_ of Polykleitos,\r\nand was prone to accept Furtwaengler’s identification; but later\r\non, in the third edition, he ascribed the statuette only to the\r\nPolykleitan circle and denied that its foot position corresponded\r\nwith that of the Pythokles base. Amelung also, while accepting its\r\nPolykleitan character, has shown that the feet of the statuette are\r\ncloser together than those on the Olympia base and are placed at a\r\nslightly different angle. As for the Munich statue, both Helbig and\r\nAmelung have ruled it out of the evidence. The head, though similar\r\nto that of the statuette, also discloses marked differences, and the\r\nlegs of the two works do not have the same pose. Loewy agrees with\r\nAmelung that the statue of Pythokles conformed with the type of the\r\n_Diadoumenos_—especially with the Vaison copy (see Fig. 28)—and with\r\nthat of the _Doryphoros_.[1511] We can not, therefore, safely assume\r\nthat the statue of Pythokles has been recovered in any existing\r\ncopy.[1512] A further variant of the works just discussed should be\r\nmentioned here—the beautiful marble statue of a boy victor in Dresden,\r\nknown as the _Dresden Boy_ (Fig. 45).[1513] In this statue the leg\r\nposition is nearly like that indicated by the marks on the Pythokles\r\nbasis, though the left foot is not set so far back nor its tip so far\r\nout. The head is turned to the left and slightly lowered, the right\r\narm hung to the side, and the left forearm was outstretched, the hand\r\ndoubtless holding some athletic article, at which the boy is looking\r\ndown, perhaps a diskos[1514] or a fillet. This beautiful athlete\r\nstatue has many stylistic points in common with the _Diadoumenos_, and\r\nshows similar Attic influence, and its original may be referred with\r\nFurtwaengler to the later period of the master himself. It gives us an\r\nexcellent idea how Polykleitos may have made his Olympia boy victors\r\nappear. A more remote variant seems to be furnished by a fourth-century\r\nB. C. bronze statuette of a youthful athlete in the Louvre.[1515] Here\r\nthe position of the feet, the turn of the head, and the direction of\r\nthe gaze are the same as in the _Dresden Boy_. However, as the right\r\narm is raised horizontally, Furtwaengler believed that the right hand\r\nheld a fillet which the youth is letting fall into the palm of the left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—Statue of a Boy Victor (the _Dresden Boy_).\r\nAlbertinum, Dresden.]\r\n\r\nThat statues of pentathletes at Olympia were also represented in\r\nmotion is shown by the footmarks on the recovered base of one of the\r\ntwo statues mentioned by Pausanias as set up in honor of the Elean\r\nAischines, who won two victories some time between Ols. 126 and 132 (=\r\n276 and 252 B. C.).[1516] These marks show that the statue represented\r\nthe victor in violent movement, since the left foot was turned outwards\r\nand the right one was brought almost to the edge of the base.\r\n\r\nWe shall next consider in some detail how the pentathlete may have been\r\nrepresented at Olympia in the three characteristic contests of jumping,\r\ndiskos-throwing, and javelin-throwing. We have already discussed the\r\nrunner, and in a future section we shall discuss the wrestler, both of\r\nwhom contended in these events not only in the pentathlon, but also in\r\nthe corresponding independent competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMPERS.\r\n\r\nJumping was a well-known contest in heroic days. In Homer, however,\r\nit did not take place at the games of Patroklos, but only at those\r\nheld by King Alkinoos.[1517] Quintus Smyrnæus has the Trojan heroes\r\ncontend in jumping,[1518] and the contest goes back to mythology.[1519]\r\nThough Plato does not mention it, Aristotle does.[1520] Later it became\r\nan essential part of the pentathlon, though never an independent\r\ncontest at the great games. It was probably considered to be the\r\nmost representative feature of the pentathlon, perhaps because of\r\nthe customary use of the _halteres_ in the physical exercises of the\r\ngymnasium. Jumping-weights were, in fact, the special symbol of the\r\npentathlon, and, as we saw in the preceding chapter, were often the\r\ndefinitive attributes indicated on statues of pentathletes.[1521] We\r\nshall next discuss the appearance and use of such jumping-weights.\r\nTheir form is often a sure indication of the date of a statue.\r\n\r\nJuethner has made a careful study of the different shapes of\r\n_halteres_ and his conclusions have been followed, for the most part,\r\nby Gardiner.[1522] The _halteres_ do not appear in Homer, but were\r\nin existence at least by the beginning of the sixth century B. C.,\r\nand a little later they probably appeared on pentathlete statues.\r\nTo this period belongs the lead weight from Eleusis now in Athens,\r\nwhose inscription records that it was dedicated by one Epainetos to\r\ncommemorate his victory in jumping.[1523] On vase-paintings of the\r\nsixth and fifth centuries B. C., we see numerous types, but two main\r\nones. Early b.-f. vases show a semicircular piece of metal or stone\r\nwith a deep depression on one side for a finger grip, the two club-like\r\nends being equal (as in Figs. 36A and 44). In the early fifth century\r\nB. C., a club-like type came in, which shows many modifications in\r\nthe size and shape of the ends.[1524] In the fifth century B. C., the\r\nsecond main type appeared, of an elongated semispherical form, thickest\r\nin the middle and with the ends pointed or rounded. These correspond\r\nwith the “archaic” ones, which Pausanias saw on the figure of _Agon_\r\nin the dedicatory group of Mikythos at Olympia[1525] and describes as\r\nforming half an elongated circle and so fastened as to let the fingers\r\npass through. We have two stone examples of this type: one found at\r\nCorinth, now in the Polytechnic Institute in Athens,[1526] in which a\r\nhole is cut behind the middle for the fingers and thumbs, and a more\r\nprimitive single one from Olympia.[1527] Philostratos divides the Greek\r\njumping-weights into “long” and “spherical,”[1528] which Juethner\r\nidentifies with the two types just discussed. Gardiner, however, finds\r\nthis impossible, since Pausanias speaks of one type as “archaic,”\r\nand he consequently thinks that these were no longer in use in the\r\ntime of Philostratos. After the fifth century B. C. we have little\r\nevidence about _halteres_ until Roman days, when a cylindrical type\r\nappears on Roman copies of Greek statues of athletes, on mosaics and\r\nwall-paintings.[1529] Thus it appears on the tree-trunk in two athlete\r\nstatues in Dresden[1530] and the Pitti Gallery in Florence,[1531]\r\nand on the Lateran athlete mosaic from Tusculum of the imperial\r\nperiod.[1532] In Roman days jumping-weights were used for the most part\r\nin medical gymnastics, like our dumb-bells.[1533]\r\n\r\nPhilostratos says that the jump was the most difficult part of the\r\npentathlon.[1534] It never existed as an independent competition\r\ndespite its popularity in Greece. This popularity is attested by the\r\nfrequency with which it is depicted on vases from the sixth century\r\nB. C. onward. Here the jumper is regularly shown with weights, and\r\nwe can assume that many pentathlete statues were so represented, the\r\nsculptor ordinarily copying the kind of weight which was in use in his\r\nown age. While Philostratos in his day thought that the use of weights\r\nwas merely to aid in exercise, Aristotle long before had rightly\r\nunderstood that the jumper could make a longer jump with than without\r\nthem,[1535] a fact easily proved by the feats of modern jumpers. While\r\nthe modern record for the running broad jump is 25 feet 3 inches,[1536]\r\nan English athlete jumped 29 feet 7 inches with the use of 5-pound\r\nweights,[1537] and a German officer in full uniform jumped 23 feet\r\nfrom a springboard.[1538] The recorded jumps of Phaÿllos at Delphi and\r\nof Chionis at Olympia, the former 55 feet and the latter 52, can not,\r\nhowever, be explained as ordinary broad jumps, even if we assume that\r\nthe Greek jumper was far superior to the modern one. Such jumps would\r\nbe impossible even with springboards or raised platforms, and we have\r\nno evidence that the Greeks used such devices. We might explain them\r\non the theory of triple jumps[1539]—though the difficulty of such a\r\nsolution is very great—or simply as mistakes in the records. Thus the\r\nrecord of Phaÿllos is found in a late epigram, in which this athlete is\r\nalso said to have thrown the diskos 105 feet.[1540] That of Chionis is,\r\nto be sure, given by Africanus.[1541] But it is more than probable that\r\nνβʹ (52) of his record should read κβʹ (22), since the Armenian Latin\r\ntext reads _duos et viginti cubitus_.[1542]\r\n\r\nVase-paintings tell us how the _halteres_ were used.[1543] The jumper\r\nswung them forward and upward until they were level with or higher than\r\nthe head; then he brought them down, bending the body forward until\r\nthe hands were below the knees, the jump taking place on the return\r\nswing. We find the preliminary swing represented most commonly on the\r\nvases;[1544] we also see on them the top of the upward swing,[1545]\r\nthe bottom of the downward swing,[1546] the jumper in midair,[1547] and\r\nthe moment just before alighting.[1548] The act of landing is seen on\r\nan Etruscan wall-painting from a tomb at Chiusi.[1549] Running jumps\r\nare the ones most commonly depicted.[1550]\r\n\r\nThe representation of the jump, therefore, was specially adapted to the\r\nvase-painter and not to the sculptor. If any movement in the jump could\r\nhave been represented to advantage in sculpture, it would have been the\r\nearly position in which the weights were swung forward and upwards.\r\nThis is the one represented on an incised bronze diskos from Sicily\r\nnow in the British Museum,[1551] where an athlete, with his right leg\r\ndrawn back for the spring, is holding the weights in his outstretched\r\nhands. A small finely modelled bronze statuette dating from the middle\r\nof the fifth century B. C., in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, may\r\nrepresent a jumper either just taking off, or perhaps just finishing\r\nthe jump.[1552] The athlete is standing with his left foot advanced,\r\nhis knees bent back, and his body leaning forward, and is holding\r\nboth arms in front, the palms downwards. Such a concentrated attitude\r\nreminds us strongly of Myron, under whose influence this statuette\r\nmust have been made. Some have interpreted it as the representation\r\nof a diver, though the hands seem to be held too far apart and the\r\nbody wrongly poised for that position, as we see it in a statuette\r\nof a diver from Perugia.[1553] More likely a jumper is intended, as\r\nthe attitude is very similar to that depicted on several vases.[1554]\r\nHowever, as the jumper has no _halteres_, it can not represent a\r\npentathlete, but must be an ordinary gymnasium athlete.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISKOBOLOI.\r\n\r\nThe diskos-throw (δισκοβολία) goes back to mythology and heroic\r\ndays.[1555] In Homer, at the games of Patroklos, Achilles casts a metal\r\nmass called the σόλος.[1556] This was the primitive type of diskos.\r\nOf such early contests and feats of strength we have a good record in\r\nthe red-sandstone mass, weighing 143.5 kilograms (= 315 pounds), which\r\nhas been found at Olympia, marked with a sixth-century inscription\r\nto the effect that one Bybon threw it over his head.[1557] There is\r\nnothing athletic, however, about the use of such a stone or of the\r\nHomeric _solos_. The diskos was also known to Homer.[1558] It was of\r\nstone, and in Pindar the heroes Nikeus, Kastor, and Iolaos still hurl\r\nthe stone diskos instead of the metal one of the poet’s day.[1559] The\r\nstone diskos appears on sixth-century vases as a white object,[1560]\r\nbut metal ones were introduced at the end of the sixth century B.\r\nC. A bronze one from Kephallenia (?) in the British Museum has a\r\nsixth-century inscription in the Doric dialect and in the alphabet\r\nof the Ionian Islands, which gives the dedication of Exoïdas to the\r\nDioskouroi.[1561] Several others have been found in different parts of\r\nGreece, especially at Olympia.[1562] Pausanias says that boys used a\r\nlighter diskos than men.[1563]\r\n\r\nWhile only unimportant monuments outside of vase-paintings illustrate\r\nthe jump, those illustrating the diskos-throw are rich and varied,\r\nincluding not only vases, but statues, statuettes, small bronzes,\r\nreliefs, coins, and gems.[1564]\r\n\r\nIn his careful attempt at reconstructing the method of casting the\r\ndiskos, E. N. Gardiner has distinguished seven different positions,\r\nwhich are illustrated by the monuments.[1565] He shows that while the\r\nswing of the quoit was always the same, _i. e._, in a vertical and\r\nnot in a horizontal arc, and the throw was invariably made from a\r\nposition like that of Myron’s statue, the preliminary and certain other\r\nmovements varied. It will be well, before discussing representations\r\nof the diskos-thrower in sculpture, very briefly to recapitulate his\r\nsummary of positions, using the evidence which he and others have\r\ncollected. First, the preliminary position or stance, with three\r\nvariations: either the position of the _Standing Diskobolos_ of the\r\nVatican (Pl. 6), which occurs in bronzes, but not on vases; or the\r\nposition in which the diskobolos raises the quoit with the left hand\r\nlevel with the shoulder, which occurs on vase-paintings;[1566] or that\r\nin which the diskos is held outwards in both hands level with the\r\nwaist.[1567] From any of these stance positions, either with or without\r\nchange of feet, we reach the second position, in which the diskos is\r\nraised in both hands and extended either horizontally to the front\r\nand level with the head,[1568] or held above the head.[1569] Thirdly\r\nthe diskos is swung downwards and rests upon the right forearm, with\r\neither foot forward.[1570] This position leads up to that of Myron’s\r\nstatue, in which the diskos is swung as far back as possible (Pls. 22,\r\n23, and Figs. 34, 35).[1571] The fifth position is the beginning of\r\nthe forward swing, when the body is straightened.[1572] As the diskos\r\nswings downwards and the left foot advances, the sixth position is\r\nreached.[1573] Lastly the right foot is advanced after the diskos is\r\ncast.[1574]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—Bronze Statuette of a _Diskobolos_. Metropolitan\r\nMuseum, New York.]\r\n\r\nA victor statue of a diskobolos might conceivably have taken any one of\r\nthese seven positions. We have already considered the two statues, the\r\n_Standing Diskobolos_ of Naukydes in the Vatican (Pl. 6) and that of\r\nMyron (Pls. 22, 23, and Figs. 34, 35), the two most important works in\r\nsculpture to illustrate positions of the throw. The statue of Naukydes\r\nis not taking aim, as Juethner maintains, nor looking down the course.\r\nThe head is inclined a little to the right and downwards, and the eyes\r\nare directed to the ground only a short distance away, thus measuring\r\nthe distance the left foot is to be advanced, when the diskos is\r\nfinally swung forward for the cast, which takes place off the left and\r\nnot off the right foot. The right forearm is rightly restored, as it\r\nthus appears on bronzes which imitate this stance.[1575] A different\r\nstance is shown in a fine bronze statuette in the Metropolitan Museum\r\n(Fig. 46),[1576] dating from about 480 B. C. This little masterpiece\r\nof the transition period of Attic art, still disclosing archaic traits,\r\nrepresents a diskobolos standing firmly on both legs, the right being\r\nslightly advanced, and holding with the left hand the diskos level with\r\nthe head. That he is preparing for intense action is seen by the way\r\nin which the toes catch the ground. Though the right arm is broken off\r\nfrom below the shoulder, we can infer from vase-paintings which show\r\ndiskoboloi in the same position[1577] that it was lowered and bent\r\nat the elbow and the hand left open. From this position the diskos\r\nwill be raised high above the head with both hands, as in a bronze in\r\nAthens,[1578] which illustrates Gardiner’s second position.\r\n\r\nThe movement is carried a little further—showing the moment of\r\ntransition to the downward swing or third position—in a fifth-century\r\nB. C. bronze in the British Museum.[1579] Here a nude, beardless\r\nathlete is represented standing with the right foot advanced and\r\nholding the diskos in both hands before him above the head. The right\r\nhand grasps the quoit underneath and the left at the top.[1580] The\r\nthird position is well illustrated by the tiny archaic bronze on the\r\ncover of a lebes in the British Museum,[1581] which represents a nude\r\nand beardless youth standing with the left foot advanced and with the\r\nleft hand raised, while the right holds the diskos. Almost the same\r\npose is also seen in a small bronze in the Antiquarium, Berlin.[1582]\r\n\r\nTwo archaic statuettes from the Akropolis, now in the National Museum\r\nin Athens, and recently published, should be mentioned in this\r\nconnection.[1583] The more archaic of these represents a youth in an\r\nattitude which has been misunderstood. De Ridder interpreted it as\r\na dancing man, while Staïs thought it represented a youth walking\r\nalong with his left hand raised as if to ward off a blow. White,\r\nhowever, showed that it (like another less perfect example from the\r\nAkropolis, no. 6594) represents a diskobolos standing with the right\r\nfoot advanced and holding the diskos in front of the body with the\r\nright hand, resting it against the flat of the forearm, while the left\r\narm is raised above the head. Thus it is another example illustrating\r\nthe initial stage of Gardiner’s third position. The other statuette,\r\nwrongly mounted, should, according to White, be made to lean further\r\nforward; the knees are bent, the body swung forward from the hips, the\r\nhead thrown back and upward, the right arm stretched forth with the\r\nflat of the forearm uppermost and the left similarly placed. Gardiner\r\nand Staïs interpreted this figure as a charioteer, and de Ridder as\r\neither a jumper, who has raised his _halteres_ preparatory to the\r\nleap, or a diskobolos. White has shown that the position of the right\r\narm proves it to be a diskobolos, represented in a movement between\r\nGardiner’s third and fourth positions, just prior to that of Myron’s\r\nstatue. De Ridder believed both statues to be Aeginetan, but no. 6614,\r\nwhen compared with Myron’s statue, is certainly Attic, and resemblances\r\nin the treatment of the hair, eyes, and mouth show that both statuettes\r\nare of the same school. It has often been said that Myron’s great\r\nstatue had no predecessor, as it certainly had no successor. Its\r\nfame was enhanced by the assumption that Myron passed at one stride\r\nfrom such statues as the _Tyrannicides_ to that complex work. Such\r\nworks, however, as these statuettes—especially no. 6614—show that the\r\npreliminary problems had been solved on a humble scale before Myron\r\nundertook his consummate work. Here, then, we have works by artists who\r\nbelonged to the very movement which produced Myron.\r\n\r\nFor the last three positions analyzed by Gardiner (nos. 5, 6, 7) our\r\nonly illustrations appear to be vase-paintings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAKONTISTAI.\r\n\r\nJavelin-throwing (ἀκοντίζειν, ἀκοντισμός) was very old and was\r\nuniversal in Greece, its origin being traced back to mythology.[1584]\r\nStassoff tried to trace it to Oriental sources,[1585] but inasmuch as\r\nno such contest is shown on the monuments of Egypt or Assyria, Juethner\r\nis probably right in assuming that it was Greek in origin. In Homer\r\nit was a separate contest at the games of Patroklos.[1586] Juethner\r\nhas distinguished two types of javelin-throwing in the historical\r\nperiod: one in which the spear or akontion was pointed more or less\r\nupwards,[1587] the other in which it was held horizontally.[1588] Only\r\nthe former type is represented in illustrations of purely athletic\r\ncompetitions, the latter type referring to illustrations of the\r\npractical use of javelin-throwing, _i. e._, in war or in the chase.\r\nVase-paintings of palæstra scenes almost invariably show javelins with\r\nblunt points; the throwers’ heads are frequently turned back before the\r\nthrow, and there is no sign of any target. On vase-paintings, however,\r\nwhich represent practical javelin-throwing from horseback, the javelins\r\nare pointed. This proves that in athletic contests the throw was for\r\ndistance and not at a mark.[1589] The javelin used in Greek games had\r\nseveral names, ἄκων, ἀκόντιον, etc.[1590] It was about the height of\r\na man, as we know from its appearance on a Spartan relief,[1591] and\r\nfrom many vase-paintings representing palæstra scenes (Fig. 44). It was\r\nthrown by means of a thong (ἀγκύλη, Lat. _amentum_), which was fastened\r\nnear the centre and consisted of a detachable leathern strip from 12\r\nto 18 inches long. This was bound tight, with a loop left, into which\r\nthe thrower inserted his first and middle fingers.[1592] The method\r\nof casting is seen on many vases.[1593] Gardiner has analyzed three\r\ndifferent positions from vase-paintings. Usually the throw was made\r\nwith a short run, though standing throws are also pictured.[1594] First\r\nthe thrower extends the right arm back to its full length and, with the\r\nleft hand opposite the right breast, holds the end of the spear and\r\npushes it back, holding it downwards or horizontally.[1595] Next he\r\nstarts to run, turning his body sidewise and extending his left arm to\r\nthe front. On a r.-f. Munich kylix[1596] we see the first and second\r\npositions. The youth on the left is steadying the javelin with the left\r\nhand, while the one on the right has just let it go. A further turn of\r\nthe body to the right takes place and the right knee is bent, while the\r\nright shoulder is dropped and the hand is turned outwards.[1597] The\r\nactual cast is very uncommon on vase-paintings, because of difficulty\r\nin representing it.[1598]\r\n\r\nBecause of the assumed lack of sculptural monuments, Reisch[1599] and\r\nothers have wrongly doubted whether javelin-throwers were represented\r\nin sculpture as victors. There certainly is no a priori reason why\r\nathletic sculptors might not have made statues in any one of the three\r\nposes which Gardiner has distinguished on vase-paintings, even if this\r\ncontest, like jumping, was better adapted to the painter than to the\r\nsculptor. Furthermore, we shall attempt to show that such monuments\r\nactually did exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—Bust of the _Doryphoros_, after Polykleitos, by\r\nApollonios. Museum of Naples.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—Statue of the _Doryphoros_, after Polykleitos.\r\nVatican Museum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nThe best example of such a javelin-thrower seems to be the\r\n_Doryphoros_, the most famous statue of Polykleitos, in which he\r\nillustrated his canon of athletic forms. The _Doryphoros_ exists in\r\nmany copies, all of which agree fairly well in style and proportions.\r\nK. Friedrichs, in his monograph _Der Doryphoros des Polyklets_, which\r\nappeared in 1863,[1600] was the first to show that the statue found\r\nin 1797 in the Palaistra at Pompeii, and now in the Naples Museum\r\n(Pl. 4), was a copy of the original bronze, as it shows all the\r\npeculiarities of the master’s style known to us from tradition.[1601]\r\nMahler enumerates 7 statues, 17 torsos, and 36 heads copied from the\r\noriginal, and the fine, but expressionless, Augustan bronze bust from\r\nthe villa of the Pisos, Herculaneum, inscribed as the work of the\r\nsculptor Apollonios, son of Archios, of Athens, which is now in Naples\r\n(Fig. 47).[1602] The best-preserved copy of the statue, the one in\r\nNaples, is surpassed in workmanship by the green basalt torso in the\r\nUffizi Gallery in Florence[1603] and by the marble one formerly in the\r\npossession of Count Pourtalès in Berlin.[1604] A poorer copy is to be\r\nfound in the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican (Fig. 48).[1605] In these\r\ncopies we see a thick-set youth standing with the weight of the body\r\non the right leg, the left one thrown back and touching the ground\r\nonly with the toes, seemingly ready to advance, though the shoulders\r\ndo not partake of the walking action. He is represented, therefore,\r\nat the moment of transition from walking to a rest position—in other\r\nwords in a purely theoretical pose—at rest, indeed, but just ready\r\nagain to advance.[1606] His left hand held a short _akontion_ over the\r\nshoulder and not the long spear (δόρυ), whence the name _Doryphoros_\r\nor spear-bearer is derived.[1607] The head is turned to the same side\r\nas the advanced foot, which perhaps is an example of the monotony\r\nin the work of the master complained of by ancient critics; variety\r\nwould have been attained by turning it in the opposite direction.\r\nIn the carefully worked bronze original, which, however, must have\r\nhad an insignificant intellectual aspect, the apparently simple\r\nproblem—hitherto vainly attempted in Greek art—of representing a\r\nman standing almost motionless, but full of life, was for the first\r\ntime solved. It is a long way from the motionless figures known as\r\n“Apollos,” with their arms glued to the sides and their legs close\r\ntogether, to this vigorous athlete. As we have already indicated,\r\nGreek art developed the first step beyond the “Apollos” by further\r\nadvancing one leg of a statue and, it may be, extending one forearm\r\nhorizontally. The next step was to place one foot slightly sidewise and\r\nthus relieve it of the weight of the body—the well-known scheme of the\r\n“free” and “rest” leg. At first the relaxation was slight, the “free”\r\nleg not being intended to move forward, nor the parts of the body to be\r\nmuch shifted. Polykleitos’ innovation consisted in having the legs so\r\nplaced, one behind the other, that the figure, while apparently resting\r\non one,[1608] seemed to be advancing. On the ground of the familiar\r\npassage in Pliny cited, it has been generally assumed that Polykleitos\r\nintroduced the walking motive into sculpture. However, this motive\r\nwas probably the invention of the earlier Argive school, borrowed by\r\nPolykleitos for his canon, as seen in the statue of the so-called\r\n_Munich King_ (_Zeus_?), of the Glyptothek, which Furtwaengler has\r\nshown to be a work of about 460 B. C.[1609]\r\n\r\nDoes the _Doryphoros_ represent a pentathlete victor? Since Quintilian\r\nsays that it appears ready for war or for the exercises of the\r\npalæstra,[1610] Helbig and others have classed it as a warrior, perhaps\r\none of the _Achilleae_ mentioned by Pliny[1611] as set up in the Greek\r\ngymnasia. Furtwaengler stressed the incorrectness of calling an athlete\r\na _Doryphoros_[1612]—a name originally given to an attendant bearing a\r\nlance (δόρυ), and so inapplicable to the statue of Polykleitos, which\r\nrepresented not a server, but an athlete carrying an akontion (witness\r\nthe Berlin gem already mentioned)—but later[1613] concluded that an\r\nathlete statue with the akontion might have been vaguely described in\r\nlate art jargon as a spear-bearer. Consequently he found probable the\r\ninterpretation of the various _doryphoroi_ mentioned by Pliny[1614] as\r\nvictor statues, and thought that the original of the _Doryphoros_ of\r\nPolykleitos might very well have represented an Olympic pentathlete,\r\nwhich was originally set up at Argos, where it was also adopted for a\r\nfigure on the heroic grave-relief already mentioned, which represented\r\nthe youth with a spear over his shoulder standing beside a horse. Bulle\r\nalso thinks that the statue represented a victor athlete set up in some\r\nsacred spot.\r\n\r\nFor its interpretation as the statue of a pentathlete victor, an\r\nadded proof is furnished by the discovery of a late Roman copy of\r\nit at Olympia.[1615] This may very well have been the dedication of\r\nan athlete of late date—of the first century B. C. or of the first\r\nA. D.—who preferred to be represented by a copy of the famous work of\r\nPolykleitos rather than by a new statue. Treu’s contention that the\r\ntorso is too large for a victor statue,[1616] because Lucian says\r\nthat the Hellanodikai did not allow statues of victors to be over\r\nlife-size,[1617] falls to the ground, since we know that exceptions\r\nto the rule existed at Olympia.[1618] He agrees with Collignon[1619]\r\nin interpreting it as a decorative statue, which surely involves an\r\nanachronism in the middle of the fifth century B. C.; and his argument\r\nthat its good preservation shows it to have been set up in an interior\r\nroom, perhaps of the Bouleuterion, in whose ruins it was found,\r\nadducing this as additional evidence of its decorative character,\r\nis no proof, since victor statues at Olympia seem sometimes to have\r\nbeen housed.[1620] Thus the theory that the _Doryphoros_ represents a\r\npentathlete victor is well within the range of possibilities.\r\n\r\nTwo bronze statuettes in the Metropolitan Museum,[1621] New York,\r\nbelonging to the second half of the fifth century B. C., may be\r\nrepresentations on a small scale of pentathletes with the _akontion_.\r\nThe first shows a youth standing with the weight of the body on the\r\nleft foot, the right drawn slightly back. The left hand, held close to\r\nthe side, may have carried an akontion, the right arm being extended.\r\nThe other, more carelessly executed, represents a youth standing\r\nsimilarly with his weight on the left foot, the right being drawn back.\r\nHere again the left arm is hanging by the side, and probably held the\r\nsame attribute as the first statuette. The right arm is also bent at\r\nthe elbow. A patera may have been held in the outstretched hand of\r\neach. The square build, short thighs, flat abdomen, long skull, and\r\noval face are all Polykleitan characteristics, and remind us of the\r\nseries of kindred works already discussed, which, as Furtwaengler\r\nbelieved, went back to the original statue of the boy wrestler Xenokles\r\nat Olympia, the work of the younger Polykleitos.[1622]\r\n\r\n\r\nWRESTLERS.\r\n\r\nWrestling (πάλη) is perhaps the oldest, and in any case is the most\r\nuniversal, of athletic sports. Wall-paintings at Beni-Hasan on the\r\nNile, dating from about 2000 B. C., show nearly all the grips and\r\nthrows now known.[1623] Plato says that this sport was instituted in\r\nmythical times.[1624] In Greece its origin is lost in mythology.[1625]\r\nThe very name _palaistra_, “wrestling school,” indicates the early\r\nimportance of the contest. It was one of the most popular of Greek\r\nsports from the time of Homer down.[1626] This popularity is shown by\r\nthe frequency with which it appears in mythology and art. Early b.-f.\r\nvases picture Herakles wrestling with giants and monsters. Here we see\r\nthe same holds and throws as in the palæstra scenes on later r.-f.\r\nvases. The whole history of coins down to imperial days shows such\r\nscenes. No other exercise required so much strength and agility, and\r\nconsequently wrestling matches early became a part of the great games.\r\nAt Olympia wrestling was introduced in Ol. 18 (= 708 B. C.), the same\r\nyear in which the pentathlon was instituted.[1627] The boys’ match\r\nappeared there less than a century later in Ol. 37 (= 632 B. C.).[1628]\r\nPausanias mentions statues erected to 36 victors (for 45 victories),\r\nwhich makes this contest second only in importance to boxing there.\r\n\r\nThere were two sorts of wrestling in Greece, wrestling in the\r\nproper sense (ὀρθὴ πάλη), where each tried to throw his antagonist\r\nto the ground, making his shoulders touch three times, and ground\r\nwrestling (κύλισις, ἁλίνδησις), where the fight was continued on\r\nthe ground by using every means, except biting and gouging, till one\r\nwas exhausted. The first kind was the only one used in the event\r\ncalled πάλη at Olympia, as well as in the pentathlon; the other\r\nwas used only in the pankration. In this section we shall discuss\r\nonly the first.[1629] A recently discovered papyrus of the second\r\ncentury A. D., containing brief instructions for wrestling lessons\r\nintended to help the παιδοτρίβης, indicates that every movement in\r\nthe contest was systematically taught.[1630] The various positions\r\nused—grips and throws—are shown by many monuments, vase-paintings,\r\ngems, coins,[1631] statuettes, and statues. The vases[1632] especially\r\nillustrate the various holds assumed by wrestlers during a bout—front\r\n(σύστασις), side (παράθεσις), wrist, arm, neck (τραχηλίζειν), and body\r\nholds. Still others illustrate the various throws—flying mare,[1633]\r\nheave,[1634] buttocks and cross-buttocks (ἕδραν στρέφειν), and tripping\r\n(ὑποσκελίζειν). We here reproduce two such paintings. The first,\r\nthe obverse of a r.-f. amphora from Vulci, signed by Andokides and\r\nnow in Berlin (Fig. 49),[1635] shows two positions. In the central\r\ngroup the wrestler on the left side has grasped his opponent’s left\r\nwrist with his right hand. The latter, however, has rendered the grip\r\nuseless by passing his own right hand behind his opponent’s back and\r\ngrasping his right arm just below the elbow. In this way he keeps\r\nhis opponent from turning round, which movement would not have been\r\npossible if the latter had grasped him by the upper arm. In the group\r\nof wrestlers to the right we see an illustration of a body hold.\r\nHere a youthful athlete has lifted his bearded antagonist clear off\r\nhis feet preliminary to throwing him. However, the one lifted from\r\nthe ground has caught his foot around his opponent’s leg, which\r\nis an illustration of tripping. On a r.-f. kylix in the University\r\nof Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia (Fig. 50a),[1636] we see a\r\nbody hold preparatory to the heave; here to the right are two youths\r\nwrestling, and to the left stands a bearded trainer with his rod. One\r\nwrestler has already lost his balance and is supporting himself with\r\nboth hands on the ground, while the other with his left hand holds the\r\nother’s right arm down, and with his right prepares to throw him over\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—Wrestling Scenes. From Obverse of an Amphora,\r\nby Andokides. Museum of Berlin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5O.—Wrestling and Boxing Scenes. From a r.-f.\r\nKylix. University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—Bronze Statues of Wrestlers. Museum of Naples.]\r\n\r\nFrom vase-paintings, then, we can see what positions the sculptor might\r\nhave used in representing groups of wrestlers. For the positions of\r\nindividual figures of wrestlers, we are guided by several statues and\r\nsmall bronzes. The preliminary position (σύστασις) seems to be best\r\nrepresented by the bronze statues of wrestling boys discovered at\r\nHerculaneum in 1754, and now in the Museum of Naples (Fig. 51).[1637]\r\nThese figures have been variously interpreted as runners,[1638]\r\ndiskoboloi,[1639] and wrestlers. Their attitude, bent forward with\r\noutstretched hands, implies the utmost expectancy. If they were\r\nrunners, they would lean further forward; as they are standing, they\r\ncould not begin to run without loss of time in raising the heels of the\r\nforward feet. If, on the other hand, they represented diskos-throwers\r\nat the moment just subsequent to the throw, their right feet would be\r\nadvanced and not their left, in order to recover their balance, as\r\nwe have seen above in considering Gardiner’s seventh position. The\r\nposition of their arms, however, and the expression of their faces\r\nmake it almost certain that they are wrestlers eagerly watching for an\r\nopening. The two statues certainly belong together, and may have been\r\nset up as antagonists in the villa in whose ruins they were found. F.\r\nHauser was the first to show that the form of body and head in both was\r\nthe same.[1640] While most critics believe that they are Hellenistic\r\nin origin, Bulle is certainly right in showing that the body ideal\r\nexpressed is Lysippan—_i. e._, long legs and slender trunk—even if\r\nhe goes too far in ascribing them to the master himself, basing his\r\nconclusion chiefly on the similarity of their ears with those of the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_ (Pl. 29). A good illustration of a hand or wrist grip\r\nis afforded by a small wrestler group, which decorates the rim of a\r\nbronze bowl from Borsdorf.[1641] This is a poorly wrought Etruscan work\r\nof fifth-century B. C. Greek origin. The two wrestlers have already\r\ngripped and their heads are close together, though the lunge in each\r\ncase is much exaggerated. Similar are the two groups on the rim of a\r\nbronze bowl in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[1642] A third-century\r\nB. C. Etruscan cista in the Metropolitan Museum,[1643] has a handle on\r\nthe lid in the form of two nude wrestlers, whose bodies are inclined\r\ntoward one another, their heads in contact, and their arms locked\r\nbehind their heads. Groups of wrestlers in similar attitudes commonly\r\nappear as cista handles.[1644] A portion of a bronze group of wrestlers\r\nwas dredged from the sea near Kythera and is now in Athens.[1645] The\r\nheave is represented by a metope from the Theseion representing the\r\nwrestling bout between Theseus and Kerkyon.[1646] A later moment is\r\nseen in a bronze wrestling-group in Paris.[1647] The cross-buttocks is\r\nillustrated by a small Hellenistic bronze group in the collection of\r\nJames Loeb in Munich, of which five other copies are known.[1648] Here\r\ntwo athletes, one bearded and the other beardless, are just ending the\r\nbout. The youth is in the power of the man, who stands behind him and\r\npresses him down by holding his arms backward. All the other replicas\r\ndiffer from the Loeb example in that the victor has both legs and\r\nnot one in front of the right leg of the vanquished wrestler. A good\r\nillustration of tripping is seen in another related series of groups\r\nknown to us in five bronze copies. These represent a wrestler on the\r\nground supporting himself on his left arm, while over him stands the\r\nvictor, whose left foot is twisted around the other’s right. These\r\ngroups are, like the preceding, also Roman provincial copies of a\r\nHellenistic original.[1649] The two groups are very similar, the only\r\nreal difference being that the vanquished wrestler in the second series\r\nstill has his left arm free and holds himself up on his right knee.\r\nBoth series seem to have been influenced by the marble pancratiast\r\ngroup in the Uffizi (Pl. 25).[1650] The head of an athlete in the Museo\r\ndelle Terme, Rome,[1651] shows by its strongly projecting neck that\r\nit comes from the statue either of a runner ready to start or of a\r\nwrestler about to grip his adversary. The face is fourth-century B. C.\r\nAttic in character and the head may, therefore, come from Euphranor’s\r\ncircle. Pliny speaks of a panting wrestler (_luctator anhelans_) by the\r\nstatuary Naukeros, which must have exhibited the contestant in intense\r\nmovement.[1652] It might have represented him after victory, as in the\r\npainting of Parrhasios discussed above, which pictured a hoplitodrome\r\nafter the race, breathing hard.[1653] Pliny also mentions a painting of\r\na wrestler by Antidotos without describing it.[1654] As we have already\r\nremarked, doubtless some of the _apoxyomenoi_ and _perixyomenoi_\r\nmentioned by Pliny were also wrestlers.\r\n\r\nWhether wrestling-groups were set up at Olympia is doubtful.\r\nChariot-groups were indeed common, but there is no reason why the\r\nvictorious wrestler should have had himself coupled with his defeated\r\nopponent. Pausanias, moreover, mentions no such groups. We are\r\ntherefore safe in inferring that in most, if not in all, cases the\r\nwrestler would content himself with a single statue, and this might\r\nrepresent him in any position in which he was not actually interlocked\r\nwith his adversary. That such statues represented him both in repose\r\nand in motion is attested by recovered bases. The footprints on the\r\nbase of the statue of the Elean wrestler Paianios, a victor of the\r\nearly third century B. C.,[1655] shows us that he was represented\r\nas standing in repose, the weight of the body resting on the right\r\nleg, the left being drawn back and touching the ground with the toes\r\nonly. A hole in the base may have been for a spear on which the\r\nvictor’s hand rested, though the statue is not that of a pentathlete.\r\nThe perfectly preserved footprints on the base of the statue of the\r\nboy wrestler Xenokles by Polykleitos the Younger show that he was\r\nrepresented as standing with his weight on the right leg, the left\r\nbeing slightly advanced and to one side, though resting flat on the\r\nground. The head was probably turned a little to the right. Thus the\r\nwrestler was poised ready to grip his adversary.[1656] This statue must\r\nhave been a favorite among athlete monuments, since the same motive\r\nappears in various Roman copies, which Furtwaengler assigns to the\r\nimmediate circle of the pupils of Polykleitos. The statue of the Argive\r\nwrestler Cheimon by Naukydes may have represented him in motion, since\r\nPausanias, in mentioning two statues of the victor, one in Olympia and\r\nthe other in the temple of Concord at Rome, says that they were among\r\nthe most famous works of that sculptor. From this encomium Reisch has\r\nassumed that the one at Olympia was represented in lively motion.[1657]\r\n\r\n\r\nBOXERS.\r\n\r\nBoxing, like wrestling, was one of the oldest sports in Greece, as it\r\nhas been everywhere else. The fist is the simplest and most natural\r\nof all weapons.[1658] Boxing was popular already in Homer, matches\r\nbeing described both in the Iliad and the Odyssey.[1659] Homer speaks\r\nof it as πυγμαχίη ἀλεγεινή,[1660] and this “painful” character is\r\nalso mentioned by Xenophanes.[1661] However, boxing was far older\r\nthan epic poetry. We have already seen that it was the only form of\r\nreal athletics in Aegean Crete. One of the oldest representations of\r\na boxing match is seen on the fragments of a bronze shield discovered\r\nthere in the grotto of Zeus on Mount Ida. Here on a single concentric\r\nring are seen two warriors, armed like Assyrians with corslets,\r\nshields, and helmets, fighting with doubled fists.[1662] The high\r\nantiquity of boxing in Greece is also shown by myths.[1663] At Olympia\r\nApollo is said to have beaten Ares,[1664] and Polydeukes won a victory\r\nthere.[1665] Apollo appears as the god of boxing in the Iliad,[1666]\r\nand the Delphians sacrificed to Apollo Πύκτης.[1667] Herakles,\r\nPolydeukes, Tydeus, and Theseus were all famed boxers; the latter was\r\nsaid to have invented the art.[1668] The historical boxing match was\r\nintroduced at Olympia in Ol. 23 (= 688 B. C.), and Onomastos of Smyrna,\r\nthe first victor, instituted the rules of the contest.[1669] The boys’\r\ncontest was instituted in Ol. 41 (= 616 B. C.).[1670] It was by far the\r\nmost popular contest there. Of the 192 monuments erected to 187 victors\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, 56, or nearly one-third, were erected to men\r\nand boy boxers for 63 victories.\r\n\r\nGreek boxing[1671] is conveniently divided into two periods by the kind\r\nof glove used in the matches. From Homer down to the end of the fifth\r\ncentury B. C., soft gloves (ἱμάντες, ἱμάντες λεπτοί or μειλίχαι) were\r\nused; from then to late Roman days the heavy gloves (σφαῖραι or ἱμάντες\r\nὀξεῖς) were the fashion. The weighted Roman cestus was not used in the\r\nGreek contest. Before discussing representations of boxers in art, we\r\nshall devote a few words to these two kinds of boxing-gloves, which\r\nfrequently give us the date of a given monument.[1672] The Cretans are\r\nthought to have worn boxing-gloves, as they seem to be visible on the\r\nso-called _Boxer Vase_ from Hagia Triada (Fig. 1). Here, on the top and\r\nlower two rows, a leather gauntlet appears to cover the arm to beyond\r\nthe elbow, being padded over the fist and confined at the wrist by a\r\nstrap. Mosso derives the later Greek glove, which appears on athlete\r\nstatues, from this primitive thong.[1673] In any case the antiquity\r\nof the glove in Greece is attested by its origin being ascribed to\r\nthe myth of Amykos, king of the Bebrykes.[1674] Gloves were already\r\nknown to Homer, who speaks of “well-cut thongs of ox-hide.”[1675]\r\nThey are not mentioned in any detail before the time of Pausanias and\r\nPhilostratos, so that we are mostly dependent for our knowledge of them\r\non the monuments. The simplest form consisted of long, thin ox-hide\r\nthongs, which were wound round the hands, the soft gloves (ἱμάντες\r\nμαλακώτεροι or μειλίχαι) of later writers.[1676] They were used, not to\r\ndeaden the blow, but to increase its force. Vase-paintings show that\r\nthe thongs were about 10 or 12 feet long before being wound.[1677] On\r\nthe exterior of a r.-f. kylix from Vulci by Douris, in the British\r\nMuseum, showing chiefly boxing scenes, we see two youths standing\r\nbefore a _paidotribes_ preparing to put on the thongs (Fig. 54).[1678]\r\nOne of them is holding the unwound thong in his outstretched hands.\r\nA similar figure appears on the r.-f. vase in Philadelphia already\r\ndiscussed (Fig. 50b), which represents a palæstra scene.[1679] This\r\nscene has been wrongly interpreted as an illustration of the game\r\nof σκαπέρδη described by Pollux[1680] as a sort of tug-of-war, the\r\nunwound thong being explained as the rope used in this game,[1681] and\r\nthe hurling-sticks stuck in the ground at either end as goals instead\r\nof akontia. A wound thong is seen hanging on the wall to the left.\r\nPhilostratos describes how the boxing thongs were put on,[1682] and\r\nvase-paintings illustrate the method.[1683] The best example of the\r\nthongs on statuary is afforded by the bronze arm found in the sea off\r\nAntikythera (Cerigotto) (Fig. 52), which Svoronos[1684] believes to\r\nbe a remnant of the statue of the Nemean victor Kreugas of Epidamnos,\r\nwhich stood in the temple of Apollo Lykios in Argos.[1685] Pausanias\r\nsays that Kreugas was crowned notwithstanding that he was killed by his\r\nadversary Damoxenos, and his description of the soft glove corresponds\r\nso closely with the one on the recovered arm that it seems as if it\r\nhad been written in the presence of the statue: “In those days boxers\r\ndid not yet wear the sharp thong (ἱμὰς ὀξύς) on each wrist, but boxed\r\nwith the soft straps (μειλίχαις), which they fastened under the hollow\r\nof the hand in order that the fingers might be left bare; these soft\r\nstraps were thin thongs (ἱμάντες λεπτοί) of raw cowhide, plaited\r\ntogether in an ancient fashion.”[1686] The strap allowed the ends of\r\nthe fingers to project, and was held together by a cord wound around\r\nthe forearm, just as Philostratos says. These μειλίχαι were used at\r\nthe great games through the fifth century B. C., and were continued in\r\nthe palæstra in the fourth. Early in the latter century the σφαῖραι\r\nmentioned by Plato[1687] and other writers appeared. We see them\r\non Panathenaic vases of that century and on Etruscan cistæ of the\r\nfollowing one.[1688] About the same time the regular ἱμάντες ὀξεῖς came\r\nin,[1689] but the old μειλίχαι or something similar were still used in\r\nthe exercises of the palæstra.[1690]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—Bronze Arm of Statue of a Boxer, found in the\r\nSea off Antikythera. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—Forearm with Glove. From the Statue of the\r\n_Seated Boxer_ (Pl. 16). Museo delle Terme, Rome.]\r\n\r\nOur best illustration of these more formidable gloves on statuary\r\nis the gauntlet clearly represented on the forearms of the _Seated\r\nBoxer_ of the Museo delle Terme (Fig. 53). Here a close-fitting\r\nglove covers each forearm, leaving the upper joints of the fingers\r\nfree and the palm open. It extends to above the wrist and ends in a\r\nrim of fur. Over it are drawn three thick bands of leather, which\r\ncover the first joints of the fingers and are fastened together on\r\nthe outside of the hands with metal clasps. A soft pad keeps these\r\nbands from chafing the fingers. They are kept in place and the wrists\r\nare strengthened by two narrow straps which are interlaced several\r\ntimes around hand and wrist. Similar gloves appear on the Sorrento\r\nboxer in Naples (Fig. 57),[1691] on the bronze forearm of a statue\r\nfrom Herculaneum in Naples,[1692] on a left fist found in 1887 in\r\nthe arena at Verona,[1693] and on many other statues and fragments.\r\nThe last representation in art of this sort of glove appears on the\r\nRoman relief in the Lateran, which dates from the time of Trajan, and\r\nrepresents a fight between two pugilists.[1694] The metal cestus was a\r\nRoman invention. None of the late Greek writers—neither Plutarch, nor\r\nPausanias, nor Philostratos—makes any mention of this loaded glove. The\r\n“sharp thongs” were enough to cause all the injuries mentioned by the\r\nwriters of the _Greek Anthology_.[1695] The cestus, perhaps used in the\r\nlater gladiatorial shows in Greece, but never in the great games there,\r\ngave the death blow to real boxing. Virgil describes it and the vicious\r\nresults of its use.[1696]\r\n\r\nThere are fewer representations of boxing matches on vases than of\r\nalmost any other Greek sport, despite its great popularity. Gardiner\r\nhas collected a number of vase-paintings dating from the sixth to\r\nthe fourth centuries B. C., which illustrate the different positions\r\nassumed by boxers in action—attack, slipping, ducking, and leg and arm\r\nmovements. We reproduce two from r.-f. kylikes in the British Museum.\r\nIn one by Douris (Fig. 54)[1697] we have, besides the group already\r\nmentioned of two athletes preparing to put on thongs, three pairs of\r\nboxers engaged in a bout. In two groups one of the contestants is\r\nseen from behind; in all three the boxers extend their left arms for\r\nguarding and draw the right back for hitting—the fists being level\r\nwith the shoulders. In one group we see the beginning of the fight, in\r\nthe other two the middle, perhaps, and the end of it, respectively. In\r\nthe last scene one contestant has fallen to the ground on his knee,\r\nand his conqueror has swung his right hand far back for a final blow,\r\nonly to be stopped by the other, who raises his finger in token of\r\ndefeat. On the other vase we see, besides a scene from the pankration,\r\ntwo pairs of boxers sparring (Fig. 55).[1698] Here in one group the\r\ncontestants do not have their fists doubled, but keep their fingers\r\nopened. On an Attic b.-f. Panathenaic panel-amphora in the University\r\nMuseum in Philadelphia (Fig. 56),[1699] we see bearded boxers sparring,\r\nwhile a boxer with thongs in his right hand stands to the right, and\r\na trainer with his rod at the left. Statues of victorious boxers\r\nat Olympia were represented either in motion, _i. e._, probably in\r\nthe position of sparring, or in repose, like that of the boy boxer\r\nKyniskos by the elder Polykleitos discussed in the preceding chapter.\r\nThe same foot position visible on the _Kyniskos_ base[1700] occurs\r\non two other Olympia bases, which, therefore, must have supported\r\nPolykleitan statues represented in repose. One of these, in the form\r\nof an _astragalos_, will be discussed further on in our treatment\r\nof pancratiast statues; the other supported the statue of the boy\r\nboxer Hellanikos of Lepreon, who won a victory in Ol. 89 (= 424 B.\r\nC.).[1701] In this case the statue was also life-size, the left foot\r\nwas firmly placed, and the right was set back resting on the ball, the\r\nstride being a little longer than in the case of the _Kyniskos_. Three\r\nother Olympia bases supported statues of boxers represented in repose,\r\nthose of the boy Tellon from the Arkadian town Oresthasion,[1702]\r\nof the Epidaurian Aristion by the elder Polykleitos,[1703] and of\r\nthe Rhodian Eukles by Naukydes of the Polykleitan circle.[1704]\r\nFurtwaengler believed that a number of existing statues of the Hermes\r\ntype reproduced the statue of Aristion, because of a similar foot\r\nposition. Among them the Pentelic marble one in Lansdowne House,\r\nLondon, is the best preserved, and most faithfully reproduces the\r\nPolykleitan style.[1705]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—Boxing Scenes. From a r.-f. Kylix by Douris.\r\nBritish Museum, London.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—Boxing and Pankration Scenes. From a r.-f.\r\nKylix.

University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—Statue of a Boxer, from Sorrento. By Koblanos\r\nof Aphrodisias. Museum of Naples.]\r\n\r\nWe may infer how a Polykleitan statue of a boxer at rest looked, from\r\nthe Roman copy of one in Kassel.[1706] Here a youth just out of boyhood\r\nis represented as standing with the weight of the body resting upon the\r\nright leg and the head turned to the right. The forearms are covered\r\nwith gloves, the right fist being raised for attack and the left for\r\ndefense. Another marble statue, representing a boxer in repose, was\r\nfound in a fragmentary condition in Sorrento in 1888, and is now in the\r\nNational Museum at Naples (Fig. 57).[1707] It is inscribed as the work\r\nof Koblanos of Aphrodisias in Karia, whom we know as a copyist of the\r\nfirst century A. D., and who was active in reproducing Greek works for\r\nthe Roman market.[1708] The body forms are too badly injured for us\r\naccurately to date the original from which this copy was made, but the\r\nhead gives us the clue, as its style appears to be a connecting link\r\nbetween that of the seated statue of _Herakles_, in the Palazzo Altemps\r\nin Rome[1709] and the Munich _Oil-pourer_ (Pl. 11),[1710] as it shows\r\naffinity to both. Though Sogliano referred it to the school of Lysippos\r\nand Juethner to the beginning of the fourth century B. C., it shows\r\nindubitable Myronian characteristics and may have been the work of\r\nMyron’s pupil Lykios, who is known to us as an athlete sculptor.[1711]\r\nIn this statue the youth is resting his weight on his right leg, the\r\nleft, with full sole on the ground, being turned to one side. The left\r\nforearm is extended outwards and to the side, the head leaning toward\r\nthe right leg—in other words, the athlete is represented in an attitude\r\nsimilar to that of the _Idolino_ (Pl. 14). As there is an olive crown\r\nin the hair, it seems reasonable to conclude that the original statue\r\nwas that of an Olympic victor.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the fifth century B. C., if not earlier, boxers\r\nwere represented in violent motion, as we saw in the case of the statue\r\nof the boy boxer Glaukos, by the Aeginetan sculptor Glaukias,[1712]\r\nrepresented in the act of sparring (σκιαμαχῶν). Whether he was\r\nrepresented as facing an imaginary antagonist or as merely punching\r\na bag we can not say, though the latter seems the more probable. The\r\nmotive is depicted in many art works, notably in the figure of a youth\r\npunching a bag which hangs from a tree on the Ficoroni cista in the\r\nMuseo Kircheriano, Rome,[1713] and in that of another represented\r\non the so-called Peter cista in the Museo Gregoriano Etrusco of the\r\nVatican, whose engraved scenes show exercises of the palæstra.[1714]\r\nThe same motive is seen also in a statuette in the Museo Chiaramonti of\r\nthe Vatican, which is proved to be that of a boy boxer by the glove on\r\nthe right hand.[1715] Here the boy is represented with the right foot\r\nfar advanced and rising on the toes of both feet, the right shoulder\r\nbeing drawn back, the right forearm raised, and the left extended\r\nforwards. The marble torso of a copy of the same original on a large\r\nscale is in Berlin.[1716] While Amelung believes that the original of\r\nboth statuette and torso was a bronze of the second half of the fourth\r\ncentury B. C., Furtwaengler thought that the torso went back to the\r\nsevere style of the fifth century, and that this original once stood in\r\nOlympia, where it might have served as the inspiration for a carelessly\r\nworked bronze statuette of a boxer found there, which repeats the\r\nmotive of the torso and similarly belongs to the fifth century B. C.\r\n(Fig. 2).[1717] The Olympia statuette also has the right foot advanced,\r\nthe upper part of the body leans backward, and the left arm with open\r\npalm is outstretched for defense, while the right with balled fist\r\nis held up ready to strike. It certainly is a votive offering of an\r\nOlympic victor—doubtless one of the small reductions, which were not\r\nuncommonly erected for economy’s sake.[1718] Whether the Aeginetan\r\nGlaukias also made victor statues in repose is doubtful.\r\n\r\nWaldstein, on insufficient grounds, has argued that the so-called\r\n_Strangford Apollo_ in the British Museum (Fig. 14)[1719] is a copy\r\nof the statue at Olympia of the famous Thasian boxer and pancratiast\r\nTheagenes by Glaukias. Its close observation of nature finds its\r\nanalogy in the statues of the Aeginetan pediment groups (see Figs. 20,\r\n21). The statue of the boy boxer Athenaios of Ephesos, by an unknown\r\nsculptor, was represented as lunging at his adversary, as we see from\r\nthe footmarks on the recovered base. The left foot was advanced and\r\nturned outwards, while the right one touched the ground only with the\r\ntoes.[1720] Similarly the statue of the boxer Damoxenidas by Nikodamos\r\nof Arkadia was represented as about to strike. On its recovered base\r\nthe left foot stood solidly upon the ground, while the right foot\r\nwas drawn back and touched the ground only with the toes—if we judge\r\nrightly from the size of the missing part of the stone.[1721] The\r\nstatue of the Ionian boxer Epitherses by Pythokritos of Rhodes seems to\r\nhave had but one foot flat upon the ground, and consequently must have\r\nbeen represented in motion, though we are not sure of the position of\r\nthe other, since one stone of the base is missing.[1722]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—Statue known as _Pollux_. Louvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe bronze plate from the base of the statue of the boy boxer\r\nPhilippos, an Azanian of Pellene, was found at Olympia and has\r\nbeen referred to the end of the fourth or beginning of the third\r\ncentury B. C.[1723] However, since Pausanias says that Myron made\r\nthe statue,[1724] various attempts have been made to reconcile the\r\ndiscrepancy in dates. Our own solution is that the statue seen by\r\nPausanias did not represent Philippos at all, but some earlier unnamed\r\nArkadian boxer, who was contemporary with Myron.[1725] Years later\r\nthe Azanian boy Philippos won a victory at Olympia and attached the\r\nrecovered epigram to the old base, in which he implored Zeus to let\r\nthe ancient glory of Arkadia be revived in him, and also a newer one\r\nin which he said that he had restored the statue of Myron.[1726]\r\nPausanias saw the newer one, but omitted to mention the older, which\r\nwas probably illegible from weathering. He therefore thought that the\r\noriginal Myronian statue used by Philippos represented the latter\r\nvictor.[1727] The words on the affixed plate beginning ὧδε στὰς ὁ\r\nΠελασγὸς ἐπ’ Ἀλφειῷ ποκα πύκτας κ. τ. λ., may refer to the position of\r\nthe boxer rather than to a portrait of the victor.[1728] We have long\r\nago hazarded the suggestion[1729] that the so-called _Pollux_ of the\r\nLouvre (Fig. 58),[1730] whose body forms recall the _Marsyas_ and whose\r\nhead recalls the _Diskobolos_, may go back to the statue of the unnamed\r\nArkadian by Myron.[1731] But the uncertainty which we have found in a\r\nformer section[1732] in assigning this and kindred works to Myron or to\r\nPythagoras leaves it only a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANCRATIASTS.\r\n\r\nThe pankration (παγκράτιον)[1733] was a combination of boxing and\r\nwrestling, in which the contestants fought either standing, or prone on\r\nthe ground. While the wrestler merely tried to throw his opponent in\r\na series of bouts, the pancratiast continued the fight on the ground\r\nuntil one or the other acknowledged defeat. The etymology of the word\r\nshows that it was a contest in which every power of the contestants\r\nwas exerted to the utmost.[1734] Strangling, pummeling, kicking,\r\nand, in fact, everything but biting and gouging were allowed. Both\r\nLucian[1735] and Philostratos[1736] speak of the prohibition against\r\nbiting and gouging, which statements Gardiner thinks are quotations\r\nfrom the rules governing the contest at Olympia, as they are twice\r\nquoted by Aristophanes.[1737] Philostratos, however, says that the\r\nSpartans allowed both biting and gouging, but that the Eleans allowed\r\nonly strangling. A case of gouging the eye of an opponent with the\r\nthumb is seen on the r.-f. kylix in the British Museum, already\r\nmentioned (Fig. 55).[1738] Here the official is rushing up with his\r\nrod to punish such a breach of the rules. Philostratos calls the men’s\r\npankration the “fairest” of contests at Olympia, probably in reference\r\nto the impression made on the spectators by the various positions\r\nof the contestants, who had to rely quite as much on skill as on\r\nstrength. Pindar wrote eight odes in praise of this contest.[1739]\r\nHowever, even though it was carefully regulated at Olympia by rules,\r\nit was a dangerous sport—τὸ δεινὸν ἄεθλον ὅ παγκράτιον καλέουσιν,\r\nin the words of the protesting philosopher Xenophanes.[1740] But it\r\nwas never the brutal sport which some modern writers have pictured\r\nit.[1741] Plato, to be sure, kept it out of his ideal State,[1742] not,\r\nhowever, because of its brutality, but merely because its distinctive\r\nfeature, the struggle on the ground, was of no service in training a\r\nsoldier. The Greeks themselves considered the boxing match far more\r\ndangerous. Inasmuch as gloves were not used in the pankration, this\r\nseems reasonable.[1743] We have in the preceding section mentioned\r\nthe epithets applied to boxing. Pausanias, in speaking of the boxing\r\nmatch between Theagenes and Euthymos, says that the former was too much\r\nwearied by that contest to enter the pankration, and was in consequence\r\ncompelled to pay a talent to the god and another to Euthymos.[1744]\r\nIn speaking of another contest, between Kapros and Kleitomachos, he\r\nrecords that the latter told the umpires that the pankration should be\r\nbrought on before he had received hurts from boxing.[1745] Artemidoros\r\nstates that no wounds resulted from the pankration.[1746] However,\r\ndeath by strangulation was often the result of the bout. Thus the\r\npancratiast Arrhachion was crowned after he had been throttled by his\r\nadversary, for just before expiring he was able to put one of the toes\r\nof his opponent out of joint and the pain caused the latter to let go\r\nhis grip.[1747] Pausanias tells also how the boxer Kreugas was slain\r\nby Damoxenos in the pankration at Nemea, but adds that the body of the\r\nformer was proclaimed victor.[1748]\r\n\r\nThe pankration was not known to Homer, though later writers ascribed\r\nits invention either to Theseus or Herakles, the typical mythical\r\nexamples of skill as opposed to brute force.[1749] It was introduced\r\nat Olympia in Ol. 33 (= 648 B. C.),[1750] long after the separate\r\nevents, wrestling and boxing, had appeared there. The boys’ contest\r\nwas instituted at Olympia in Ol. 145 (= 200 B. C.),[1751] though it\r\nhad appeared elsewhere much earlier.[1752] It must have been a popular\r\nsport at Olympia, since Pausanias records statues erected to twenty\r\nvictors for thirty victories in this contest.\r\n\r\nVase-paintings[1753] show many grips and throws of the pankration—the\r\nflying mare, leg hold,[1754] tilting backwards by holding the\r\nantagonist’s foot, “chancery” (_i. e._ catching the adversary around\r\nthe neck with one arm and hitting his face with the other fist),\r\nstomach throw (_i. e._, seizing the adversary by the arms or shoulders\r\nand at the same time planting one’s foot in the other’s stomach, and\r\nthen throwing him over one’s head),[1755] jumping on the back of one’s\r\nopponent,[1756] strangling, wrestling and boxing combined, and kicking\r\nand boxing combined. Ground wrestling is very commonly depicted\r\non vases and especially on gems, since such groups were adapted to\r\noblong or oval spaces.[1757] We reproduce a pancratiast scene from\r\na Panathenaic amphora of Kittos, dating from the fourth century B.\r\nC., in the British Museum (Fig. 59).[1758] This is a conventional\r\nrepresentation of wrestling and boxing combined. The pancratiast at the\r\nright of the group has rushed in with his head down and has been caught\r\naround the neck by his adversary’s arm, a hopeless position, from which\r\nhe can not escape. The latter is either about to complete the neck hold\r\n(if it be an actual case of “chancery”), or perhaps to hit him with his\r\nright hand. A third pancratiast is looking on from the extreme right,\r\nwhile a _paidotribes_, switch in hand, appears at the left. The fight\r\non the ground is well depicted on the r.-f. kylix of the British Museum\r\nalready discussed as showing boxing scenes (Fig. 55).[1759]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—Pankration Scene. From a Panathenaic Amphora by\r\nKittos. British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nWe have but few representations of pancratiasts in sculpture.\r\nThe preliminary sparring—known as ἀκροχειρισμός[1760]—must have\r\ncharacterized the statue of the Sikyonian pancratiast Sostratos at\r\nOlympia by an unknown sculptor, since Pausanias says that this victor\r\nwas known as ὁ ἀκροχερσίτης, explaining the epithet as that of one\r\nwho gained his victories by seizing and bending his adversaries’\r\nfingers, holding them fast till he yielded.[1761] Since a Delphian\r\ninscribed base[1762] gives the same number of victories as Pausanias,\r\nwe infer that they were given also on the Olympia base, the source of\r\nPausanias’ information. Since nothing is said, however, of Sostratos’\r\nmode of fighting in the Delphi inscription, Pausanias must have argued\r\nit from the pose of the statue. The Sicilian wrestler Leontiskos of\r\na century earlier, whose statue was by Pythagoras, had, according to\r\nPausanias, used similar tactics, for “he vanquished his adversaries\r\nby bending back their fingers.”[1763] These cases show that statues\r\nof pancratiasts and wrestlers were frequently represented in vigorous\r\nlunging attitudes as well as in groups. The epigram on the base of the\r\nmonument of the pancratiast Teisikrates at Delphi shows that the statue\r\nwas represented in a similar way.[1764] The same lunging attitude is\r\nalso shown on the Halimous grave-relief.[1765] Sometimes the contest\r\nended with the preliminary sparring, though usually it developed into\r\nwrestling and boxing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—Bronze Statuette of a Pancratiast (?), from\r\nAutun, France. Louvre, Paris.]\r\n\r\nA good representation of a pancratiast trying to kick his antagonist\r\nseems to be furnished by the small bronze statuette from Autun, South\r\nFrance, now in the Louvre (Fig. 60).[1766] This statuette is of\r\nmediocre workmanship, its hard muscles, imperfect proportions, and\r\nrealism showing that it comes from the Hellenistic period of Greek art.\r\nIt represents a bearded athlete, who holds his hands ready to strike\r\nand his left foot raised apparently to kick his adversary’s leg. The\r\nfoot is just ready to return to its original position, so that the\r\nmotive of this poor little statuette discloses a transient period of\r\ntime between two movements, just as the _Diskobolos_ and _Marsyas_ of\r\nMyron did. We have already noted[1767] that on the head is a cap with a\r\nring in the top, by which it could be suspended as a decorative piece,\r\nor perhaps as part of a steelyard. Hauser believes that this motive\r\nwas known to the elder Polykleitos and that this is the interpretation\r\nof that sculptor’s statue of a _nudus talo incessens_ mentioned\r\nby Pliny, a statue which has formed the basis for much discussion\r\namong archæologists.[1768] The Plinian passage, therefore, is to be\r\ntranslated as “the nude man attacking with his heel (_talo_)”—in\r\nother words, it describes a statue represented as kicking, which was\r\nallowable in the pankration. The manuscripts of Pliny all read _talo_,\r\nwhich Benndorf[1769] thought could be retained only by assuming\r\nthat the naturalist mistranslated his Greek source γυμνὸς ἀστραγάλῳ\r\nἐπικείμενος, translating the word ἐπικείμενος “standing upon,” as\r\n_incessens_ “pursuing.” He therefore assumed that Polykleitos’ statue\r\nstood upon an astragalos (_talus_) basis, which he believed was the\r\nforerunner of the statue of _Opportunity_ (Καιρός) by Lysippos,[1770]\r\nand he referred it to the knuckle-bone basis found at Olympia.[1771]\r\nWoelfflin,[1772] however, has shown that _talo incessens_ can only\r\nmean “_mit einem Knochel nach Jemand einwerfen_.” Following this,\r\nFurtwaengler showed[1773] how impossible on grammatical and other\r\ngrounds it was to read _talo_ in Benndorf’s sense, since the passage\r\nthen would mean “advancing towards” or “pursuing,” by means of a\r\nknuckle-bone, which is manifestly nonsense. The word could be only\r\ninstrumental in use, as Woefflin said, _i. e._, the weapon by means\r\nof which the man was attacking. Furtwaengler, therefore, followed\r\nBenndorf’s earlier alternative reading _telo_, assuming that Pliny\r\nmistakenly wrote _talo_ because he was influenced by the presence of\r\nthe same word in the passage immediately following: _duosque pueros\r\nitem nudos talis ludentes qui vocantur astragalizontes_.[1774] But\r\nHauser’s interpretation of _talo_ meets all the conditions better,\r\nsince it keeps the manuscript readings, makes grammatical Latin, and\r\nseems to be illustrated by the statuette in question.\r\n\r\nSometimes the statues of Olympic pancratiasts were represented at\r\nrest with the weight of the body equally on both legs, as we see from\r\nthe recovered basis of the statue of the Athenian Kallias by the\r\nAthenian sculptor Mikon.[1775] Furtwaengler has identified a statue\r\nin the Somzée Collection as a copy of this work.[1776] The footprints\r\non the recovered base of the statue of the Rhodian Dorieus show that\r\nit was represented at rest with one leg slightly advanced.[1777]\r\nWe have actual remnants of statues of Olympic pancratiasts in the\r\nmarble head found at Olympia, which we are to assign to the statue\r\nof the Akarnanian Philandridas by Lysippos, mentioned by Pausanias\r\n(Frontispiece and Fig. 69),[1778] and the beautiful statue of Agias\r\ndiscovered by the French at Delphi in 1894, a work by the same sculptor\r\n(Pl. 28 and Fig. 68).[1779]\r\n\r\nThe struggle on the ground implies groups and not single statues.\r\nOur best representation of such a group is furnished by the famous\r\nmarble one in the Uffizi, Florence (Pl. 25).[1780] Though having no\r\npretensions to be a victor monument, this group is the most important\r\nmonument extant connected with the pankration, a fine anatomical study\r\nfrom Hellenistic times, evincing the direct influence of Lysippos\r\nin its proportions.[1781] It shows affinity of design to certain\r\nsculptures from the frieze of the Great Altar at Pergamon.[1782] Pliny\r\nspeaks of a _symplegma_ by Kephisodotos, the son of Praxiteles, at\r\nPergamon, but that group was of an erotic character and can not have\r\nhad anything to do with the Florentine one.[1783] Unfortunately the\r\ngroup in question has been much restored, though the restoration in\r\nthe main is right. The heads, though probably antique, do not seem to\r\nbelong to the statues, but both appear to be copies of the head of one\r\nof the Niobids, with which group the pancratiasts were discovered in\r\n1583. The right arm of the uppermost athlete seems to have been wrongly\r\nrestored; in any case this athlete is not strangling his opponent. One\r\nyouth has thrown the other down on to his knee, and his left leg is\r\nintertwined with the left leg of the other, and he is drawing back his\r\narm to aim a blow. The wrestler underneath supports himself upon his\r\nleft arm, and the intention of his opponent is to destroy this support\r\nby a blow of the fist, which would bring the contest to a sudden\r\nconclusion, since the right arm of the under youth is fast and he must\r\ndefend himself with the left. As Gardiner points out, such a situation\r\nis illustrated by Heliodoros’ description of the match between\r\nTheagenes and an Aethiopian champion.[1784] The under man’s position,\r\nhowever, may suddenly change and the issue yet be in his favor. Many\r\nwriters have explained the group as ordinary wrestlers,[1785] but\r\nGardiner has conclusively shown that it belongs to the pankration,\r\nsince in wrestling the contest is ended when one of the contestants has\r\nbeen thrown, while here the struggle is continuing on the ground.[1786]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 25\r\n\r\nMarble Group of Pancratiasts. Uffizi Gallery, Florence.]\r\n\r\nKapros of Elis was the first of seven Olympic victors to emulate\r\nthe fabled feat of Herakles by winning the pankration and wrestling\r\nmatches on the same day—that is, he was the first professional\r\nstrong man.[1787] The other six all came from the East. It has been\r\nsuggested[1788] that the colossal _Farnese Herakles_ found in Rome\r\nin the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla in 1540 and now in Naples,\r\ninscribed as the work of the Athenian Glykon, which represents the hero\r\nleaning wearily on his club against a rock,[1789] may represent\r\nthe type of these professional strong men, who called themselves the\r\nsuccessors of Herakles. But such a suggestion is as unfounded as the\r\none already examined, which identifies the original of the _Seated\r\nBoxer_ of the Museo delle Terme (Pl. 16 and Fig. 27) with Kleitomachos\r\nof Thebes, the redoubtable opponent of Kapros, since the dates in both\r\ncases are against such identifications. The Farnese statue and other\r\nreplicas of the same original[1790] obviously revert to a Lysippan\r\noriginal, though they are considerably metamorphosed by the taste of a\r\nlater age. Such big swollen muscles at first sight appear to be alien\r\nto the sculptor of the graceful _Agias_, but that the Naples copy by\r\nGlykon—who, from the inscription on the base, must be referred to the\r\nfirst century B. C.[1791]—really represents the work of Lysippos seems\r\nwell established by the fact that a smaller copy, though still over\r\nlife-size, of poorer workmanship, in the Pitti Gallery in Florence,\r\nis inscribed as Λυσίππου ἔργον.[1792] This type of weary hero appears\r\nin the _Telephos_ group on the small Pergamene frieze, but is even\r\nearlier, since the latter seems to have been borrowed from a statue\r\nwhich is reproduced on a coin of Alexander, which was struck at least\r\nas early as 300 B. C.[1793] The type of Herakles wearied by his\r\nsuperhuman labors was inaugurated still earlier by Lysippos, who was\r\nfond of representing the hero in many poses, seated and standing,\r\nresting and laboring. We might mention his colossal bronze statue\r\nof Herakles, which was set up in Tarentum and then carried to Rome\r\nand placed on the Capitol by Q. Fabius Maximus, when Tarentum was\r\ncaptured in 209 B. C., and was later transferred to the Hippodrome\r\nat Constantinople, where it remained until the sack of that city by\r\nthe Franks in 1204.[1794] It is hazardous, therefore, to reject the\r\nevidence, and it will be best to see in the original a genuine Lysippan\r\nwork, as do Bulle, Overbeck, von Mach, Schnaase,[1795] and others, and\r\nso to make Glykon responsible only for the exaggerations of his own\r\ncopy. Thus we have to face the fact of divergent styles in the great\r\nbronze founder of the fourth century B. C., even if we admit with\r\nRichardson that “for our peace of mind this statue might well have been\r\nsunk in the sea.”[1796]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A      B\r\nFIG. 61.—Bronze Head of Boxer (?), from Olympia. National Museum,\r\nAthens.]\r\n\r\nLong ago, I referred the life-size bronze portrait-like head of a\r\nboxer or pancratiast found at Olympia, now in the Athens Museum (Figs.\r\n61A and B),[1797] to one of two statues of the pancratiast Kapros\r\nmentioned by Pausanias.[1798] The remnant of a wild-olive crown in the\r\nhair proves that it comes from the statue of an Olympic victor. Its\r\nbruised appearance may, however, betoken the punishment administered by\r\nthe gloves of a boxer rather than by the bare fists of a pancratiast.\r\nThat Greek sculpture was not always ideal we have seen from the\r\ndescription of the _Seated Boxer_ of the Museo delle Terme (Pl. 16 and\r\nFig. 27). This peculiarly life-like head is another example of the\r\nsame realism; it would be hard to name a more brutal and repellent\r\npiece from the whole range of Greek sculpture. The profession of this\r\nbruiser is evident in every feature, for the sculptor has betrayed it\r\nby the swollen ears, flat nose, thick neck, swollen cheeks, projecting\r\nunder lip, frowning brows, and unkempt hair and beard. All these\r\ntraits—especially the treatment of the eyes—give to it the sullen\r\ngloomy look so characteristic of boxers and pancratiasts.[1799] The man\r\nappears to be awaiting the attack, his contracted brows showing alert\r\nexpectation, and his closed lips great determination. Furtwaengler,\r\nBulle, Flasch, and others have dated it in the fourth century B. C.,\r\nand are fain to see in it the work of an artist of the immediate\r\ncircle of Lysippos or Lysistratos;[1800] but its exaggerated realism\r\nseems rather to point to a later period, not earlier than the third\r\ncentury B. C.[1801] The bronze foot of a victor statue also found at\r\nOlympia (Fig. 62)[1802] has been assigned by Furtwaengler to one of the\r\nstatues of Kapros, an ascription which we also have followed.[1803]\r\nThe position of this foot shows—as an experiment with a living model\r\nhas disclosed—great movement, which makes it obvious that it comes\r\nfrom a statue in lively motion, probably of a boxer or pancratiast. It\r\nbelongs to the statue of a strong man of coarse build; there is not the\r\nslightest trace of unnecessary flesh on it, but the whole is vigorous\r\nmuscle, even the swollen veins being clearly visible in the photograph.\r\nWhile Furtwaengler finds its stylistic parallels in the copies of the\r\nPergamene works of the third century B. C., _e. g._, the _Dying Gaul_\r\nstatues, the material and form of the base fitting that period, Wolters\r\nemphasizes its stylistic analogy to the bronze head just discussed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—Bronze Foot of a Victor Statue, from Olympia.\r\nMuseum of Olympia.]\r\n\r\nThe monuments which represent equestrian victors will be left for\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMONUMENTS OF HIPPODROME AND MUSICAL VICTORS.\r\n\r\nPLATES 26-27 AND FIGURES 63-67.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have considered the monuments of victors\r\nin various gymnic contests, in which the victor won by his own strength\r\nand skill. In the present chapter we shall be concerned chiefly with\r\nthe monuments set up by victors at Olympia in chariot- and horse-races,\r\nin which the victory did not depend upon the athletic prowess of\r\nthe victor, but upon the skill of his charioteer or jockey and the\r\nendurance of his horses.[1804] Though such events were not in the\r\nstrict sense a part of Greek athletics, they formed a very important\r\nfeature of the festival at Olympia as elsewhere.[1805] Indeed the\r\nfour-horse chariot-race was the most spectacular and brilliant event\r\nat Olympia. Chariot-races, and to a less extent horse-races, were the\r\nsport only of the rich—kings, princes, and nobles.[1806] Thus victories\r\nwere won in these events at Olympia in the fifth century B. C. by Hiero\r\nand Gelo, kings of Syracuse, and Arkesilas IV of Kyrene; in the fourth,\r\nby Philip II of Macedonia, and in Roman days by Tiberius, Germanicus,\r\nNero, and many others. Alkibiades in Ol. 91 (= 416 B. C.), _i. e._, in\r\nthe midst of the great Peloponnesian war, entered seven chariots at\r\nOlympia and won three prizes.[1807] Sometimes a city entered a chariot\r\nor horse. Thus in Ol. 77 (= 472 _B. C._) the public chariot of Argos,\r\nand in Ol. 75 (= 480 B. C.) the public horse of the same city, won at\r\nOlympia.[1808] Such entries show not only the expense attending these\r\ncontests, but also their importance in the eyes of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nHippodromes, chariot-races, and horse-races were very common in Greece.\r\nA votive inscription in the museum at Sparta, dating from near the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century B. C., enumerates sixty victories by\r\nDamonon and his son Enymakratidas in both chariot- and horse-races\r\nat eight different meets in or near Lakonia, and Damonon was merely\r\na local victor, unknown at Olympia.[1809] Greeks of Sicily and\r\nMagna Græcia were especially fond of such contests, as we see these\r\nconstantly represented on coins of different cities there from the\r\nbeginning of the fifth century B. C. on.[1810] However, only a few of\r\nthe sites of these many hippodromes are now known, and only one can be\r\npositively identified, that mentioned by Pausanias on Mount Lykaios\r\nin Arkadia.[1811] The others are known from literary sources.[1812]\r\nThe one at Olympia was destroyed in the course of centuries by the\r\nfloods of the Alpheios, and its exact location can not be determined,\r\nthough we know in general that it lay somewhere southeast of the Altis,\r\nbetween the river and the Stadion, and surmise that it ran somewhat\r\nparallel to the latter.[1813]\r\n\r\nIts measurements, however, are known to us from a Greek metrological\r\nparchment manuscript in the old Seraglio, Constantinople, which dates\r\nfrom the eleventh century A. D.[1814] According to it the length of the\r\ncourse, _i. e._, from the starting-point to turning-post and return,\r\nwas about 8 stades (1538 meters, 16 centimeters) or nearly 1 mile. One\r\nof the two sides—which Pausanias says were of unequal length[1815]—was\r\n3 stades and 1 plethron long. The breadth of the course at the\r\nstarting-point was 1 stade and 4 plethra. We are told, however, that\r\nonly a portion of the entire course, six stades, or about two-thirds of\r\na mile, was traversed in the various races.\r\n\r\nThe oldest literary account of a Greek chariot-race is found in Homer\r\nin the description of the games of Patroklos—the longest and finest\r\nepisode there described.[1816] But the first trace of such a contest\r\ngoes back to mythology, to the story of Pelops and Oinomaos contending\r\nfor the hand of the latter’s daughter Hippodameia.[1817] This mythical\r\nrace began at the village of Pisa in Elis and ended at the altar of\r\nPoseidon on the Isthmus of Corinth.[1818] The chariot-race was the\r\nchief if not the only event at the oldest funeral games in Greece,\r\nthose mentioned by Pausanias as held in honor of Azan, the son of\r\nArkas, in Arkadia.[1819] It figured largely in mythology[1820] and\r\nwas represented in many works of art.[1821] At Olympia it was one of\r\nthe earliest, and perhaps the earliest, of the events. Pausanias says\r\nthat the four-horse chariot-race was introduced there in Ol. 25 (= 680\r\nB. C.),[1822] but this may merely mean, as Gardiner points out, the\r\ndate of exchanging the older prehistoric two-horse chariot for the one\r\ndrawn by four horses. In any case the antiquity of the race at Olympia\r\nis shown by the great number of early votive offerings in the form of\r\nmodels of chariots and horses, which have been found there in a stratum\r\nextending below the foundations of the Heraion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME OF HIPPODROME EVENTS.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the third century B. C. the fully developed programme\r\nof equestrian events at Olympia and elsewhere consisted of six races,\r\nthree for full-grown horses (τέλειοι), and three for colts (πῶλοι);\r\nfor each of these two classes there were a four-horse chariot-race\r\n(ἅρμα, τέθριππον), a two-horse chariot-race (συνωρίς), and a horse-race\r\n(κέλης), thus:\r\n\r\n  ἅρματι τελείῳ, συνωρίδι τελείᾳ, κέλητι τελείῳ.\r\n  ἅρματι πωλικῷ, συνωρίδι πωλικῇ, κέλητι πωλικῷ.\r\n\r\nThese six events comprised the ἀγὼν ἱππικός at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea,\r\nCorinth, Athens, and elsewhere, as opposed to the ἀγὼν γυμνικός.[1823]\r\nThe distinction between horses and colts was apparently a matter\r\nwhich was decided by the Hellanodikai at Olympia. Thus, Pausanias\r\nrecounts how the Spartan victor Lykidas entered a pair of colts for\r\nthe chariot-race, and that one of them was rejected by the judges; he\r\nthereupon entered both for the race with full-grown horses and won\r\nit.[1824] Though such a story does not fit the date of Lykidas, who won\r\nbefore the colt-race was introduced at Olympia, it shows the method\r\nof selection.[1825] The race in which the chariot was drawn by four\r\nfull-grown horses (ἵππων τελείων δρόμος) was introduced, as we have\r\nseen, in Ol. 25. The contestants drove twelve times round the course,\r\na distance of seventy-two stades or over eight miles.[1826] Pausanias\r\nmentions the monuments of eighteen such victors at Olympia for nineteen\r\nvictories. The race in which the chariot was drawn by four colts (πώλων\r\nἅρμα) was introduced in Ol. 99 (= 384 B. C.),[1827] and extended eight\r\ntimes round the course, or about 5.5 miles.[1828] Pausanias mentions\r\nthe monuments of only two such victors at Olympia.[1829] The race in\r\nwhich the chariot was drawn by pairs of full-grown horses (συνωρίς)\r\nwas introduced in Ol. 93 (408 B. C.) and extended eight times round\r\nthe course.[1830] Pausanias mentions but one victor in this event at\r\nOlympia[1831] and an Olympic victress who had a statue erected to her\r\nin Sparta for such a victory.[1832] This was probably the original\r\nchariot-race at Olympia revived in Ol. 93, since the two-horse chariot\r\nwas the historical descendant of the Homeric war-chariot.[1833]\r\nPanathenaic vases show that this race existed at Athens in the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., side by side with the four-horse chariot-race and\r\nhorseback-race. The earliest of these vases, the so-called Burgon\r\nvase in the British Museum,[1834] was a prize there for this event.\r\nThe race in which the chariot was drawn by a pair of colts (συνωρὶς\r\nπώλων) was introduced at Olympia in the third century B. C., in Ol.\r\n129 (= 264 B. C.),[1835] and extended three times around the course.\r\nPausanias mentions no monument erected to a victor in this race. The\r\nhorse-race (ἵππος κέλης) was instituted in Ol. 33 (= 648 B. C.)[1836],\r\nand the foal-race (πῶλος κέλης) nearly four centuries later, in Ol.\r\n131 (256 B. C.).[1837] Neither of these races was known to Homer, for\r\nκελετίζειν in the Iliad,[1838] as we saw in Chapter I, refers only to\r\nthe acrobatic feat of vaulting from the back of one horse to that of\r\nanother. Pausanias mentions monuments erected to eight victors (for\r\nnine victories) in the regular horse-race at Olympia. We conclude from\r\na passage of his work[1839] that the riding-race consisted of one lap\r\nonly or six stades, about two-thirds of a mile. A mule chariot-race\r\n(ἀπήνη) was introduced in Ol. 70 (= 500 B. C.), and a trotting-race\r\nwith mares (κάλπη) in Ol. 71 (= 496 B. C.), but both were abolished in\r\nOl. 84 (= 444 B. C.).[1840] Pausanias mentions one monument erected\r\nto an anonymous victor in κάλπη, who won some time between Ols. 72\r\nand 84 (= 492 and 444 B. C.).[1841] He mentions the first victor in\r\nthe mule-race, Thersias of Thessaly, but this does not occur in his\r\n_periegesis_ of the Altis.[1842] Only three other victors in this event\r\nare known to us, and they came from Sicilian towns.[1843]\r\n\r\nEquestrian events were discontinued at Olympia in the first century\r\nB. C., owing to the waning of interest in athletics in consequence of\r\nthe Roman conquest of Greece in 146 B. C. They were revived thereafter\r\nunder the Empire only spasmodically and were destined finally to be\r\nreplaced by the amusements of the Roman circus. Thus we learn from the\r\nArmenian version of Africanus that the chariot-race ceased at Olympia\r\nin Ol. 178 (= 68 B. C.). It must, however, have been reinstated toward\r\nthe end of the century, since Tiberius Claudius Nero—afterwards the\r\nEmperor Tiberius—won in Ol. 194 (= 4 B. C.).[1844] It again went into\r\ndisuse, since Africanus says that it, πάλαι κωλυθείς, was reintroduced\r\nin Ol. 199 (= 17 A. D.), when Germanicus, the adopted son of Tiberius,\r\nwon.[1845] Once more it was discontinued, and again renewed in Ol.\r\n222 (= 109 A. D.), according to the same authority, who, however, does\r\nnot name any victor for that date. Just when this discontinuance took\r\nplace, we can not say, but it was certainly after Ol. 211 (= 65 A. D.),\r\nwhen the emperor Nero is known to have won victories in various kinds\r\nof chariot-races.[1846] Three Olympiads before, an Elean, Tiberios\r\nKlaudios Aphrodeisios, had also won the horse-race.[1847]\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIONS OF THE CHARIOT-RACE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 26\r\n\r\nRacing Chariot and Horses. From an archaic b.-f. Hydria. Museum of\r\nBerlin.]\r\n\r\nRepresentations of the various chariot-races are commoner than\r\nthose of any other Olympic contest, appearing on vases, reliefs,\r\ncoins, and gems.[1848] There seem to have been two distinct types\r\nof racing-chariot in Greece.[1849] The four-horse chariot was a\r\nmodification of the heroic two-horse war-chariot, which was a low car\r\non two wheels, surmounted by a box consisting of a high framework,\r\nopen only at the rear, and large enough to contain the chieftain and\r\nthe charioteer. The war-chariot was known to both Mycenæan Greece and\r\nCrete. There is a relief of uncertain date in the Museum of Candia,\r\nwhich represents a chariot and charioteer.[1850] It is far superior\r\nto the type of chariots appearing in relief on the gravestones found\r\nat Mycenæ,[1851] though the type on both is of the same general\r\npattern, having the same box and four-spoked wheels. On the Mycenæan\r\nreliefs the box seems to rest directly upon the rim of the wheel, and\r\nthe portrayal of a single horse is very inartistic. On the Candia\r\nrelief, however, there are at least two horses discernible, and\r\nboth the horses and the warrior, who is about to mount the car, are\r\nlifelike. The Greek racing-car was much lighter than the Homeric and\r\nMycenæan war-chariot, and the box had room only for the charioteer.\r\nIt was drawn usually by four horses. The Athenian type appears on\r\nPanathenaic vases throughout the whole history of the manufacture\r\nof these vases,[1852] and also on Macedonian and Sicilian coins. On\r\ncertain vases of later date the car is still lighter and has larger\r\nwheels. One of the earliest racing-cars is seen on a vase in the\r\nBritish Museum,[1853] dating from the eighth century B. C. It seems\r\nto be a two-horse car, as we should expect at this early date, though\r\nthe artist has drawn but one horse. The charioteer is clothed in a\r\nlong chiton, a custom which was generally kept throughout the history\r\nof the chariot-race. The regular two-horse type of chariot appears on\r\nvases as a cart, the body of the old war-chariot being so diminished\r\nthat nothing is left but the driver’s seat with a square open framework\r\non the sides. The driver rests his feet on a footboard suspended from\r\nthe pole.[1854] Perhaps this represents a peculiarly Athenian type\r\nof chariot, since the two-horse chariot on coins of Philip II, son\r\nof Amyntas and father of Alexander the Great, a victor at Olympia in\r\nboth horse-racing and charioteering, resembles the ordinary four-horse\r\ncar, and the driver stands instead of sits.[1855] The mule-car was\r\nlike the two-horse chariot, as we see in representations of it on\r\ncoins of Rhegion and Messana.[1856] The best illustrations of racing\r\nwith four-horse cars are afforded by coins of Sicilian cities.[1857]\r\nWe see an excellent representation of such a race on a sixth-century\r\nB. C. Panathenaic vase recently found at Sparta, on which a chariot\r\ndriven by a standing charioteer is represented as passing a pillar on\r\nthe right, and therefore perhaps near the end of the race.[1858] The\r\nharnessing of two horses to a racing-car is seen on an archaic b.-f.\r\nhydria in Berlin (Pl. 26).[1859] Here a third horse appears, led by\r\na nude youth, who is crowned, and who therefore probably represents\r\na victorious horse-racer. Several other b.-f. vase-paintings showing\r\nfour-horse chariots have been collected by Gerhard.[1860] However,\r\nwe are not dependent upon vase-paintings and coins to judge of the\r\nmagnificence of Greek chariots of the historical period, for we have\r\nactual remains of them—war-chariots, to be sure, but not very unlike\r\nthe ones used at the corresponding dates in Olympia. Among these is\r\nthe fine bronze _biga_ found in the grave of an Italian prince at\r\nMonteleone, Etruria, in 1902, and now one of the chief treasures of\r\nthe Metropolitan Museum in New York.[1861] This is a war-chariot of the\r\nbeginning of the sixth century B. C., the only complete ancient bronze\r\nchariot now known. The restored frame of wood is sheathed with thin\r\nbronze plates richly ornamented with reliefs in repoussé. Because of\r\nits form and its relationship to chariots appearing on archaic Ionic\r\nmonuments of Asia Minor, for example, on the reliefs of sarcophagi\r\nfrom Klazomenai, and because of the strong resemblance between its\r\ndecorative designs and those of archaic Italian monuments of Ionicizing\r\nstyle, Furtwaengler has classed it as the product of Ionic Greek art.\r\nProfessor Chase, on the other hand, finds these decorations pure\r\nEtruscan in character, comparing them with the reliefs on three bronze\r\ntripods in the possession of Mr. James Loeb, which are dated some half\r\na century later.[1862] In any case this chariot is “_das glaenzendste,\r\nvollstaendigste_” archaic metal work yet recovered. In the British\r\nMuseum there are considerable remnants of the chariot-group of King\r\nMausolos and his wife Artemisia, which once stood on the apex of the\r\nMausoleion at Halikarnassos, the work, according to Pliny,[1863] of\r\nPythis (or Pytheos), the architect and historian of the tomb.[1864]\r\nBesides the figures of the royal pair, we have the head of one horse,\r\nthe hinder half of another, fragments of still others, and one wheel of\r\nthe chariot.[1865]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARIOT-GROUPS AT OLYMPIA.\r\n\r\nGreat artists were engaged to set up chariot-groups at Olympia and\r\nelsewhere. Many of the _quadrigae_ and _bigae_ mentioned by Pliny\r\nas the works of sculptors and painters must have been agonistic\r\nofferings.[1866] Aeginetan sculptors were especially in favor at\r\nOlympia. Thus Onatas, in conjunction with the Athenian Kalamis, made\r\na group for King Hiero,[1867] and Glaukias made another for Hiero’s\r\nbrother Gelo;[1868] Simon made an equestrian group for Phormis,[1869]\r\nand Philotimos made a statue for the horse-racer Xenombrotos of\r\nKos.[1870] The oldest dedication by a chariot victor at Olympia was\r\nthe votive offering of Miltiades, the son of Kypselos, of Athens,\r\nwhich consisted of an ivory horn of Amaltheia, inscribed with archaic\r\nletters and set up in the treasury of the Sikyonians. Miltiades won his\r\nvictory in Ol. (?) 54 (= 564 B. C.).[1871] The next oldest dedication\r\nat Olympia was that of a chariot, without any human figure, by the\r\nSpartan Euagoras, who won three victories in Ols. (?) 58-60 (= 548-540\r\nB. C.).[1872] This custom of dedicating merely the model of a chariot\r\ncontinued sporadically into the third century B. C. Thus Polypeithes\r\nof Sparta, who won a victory near the end of the sixth century B.\r\nC.,[1873] dedicated a chariot, while a figure of his father, the\r\nwrestler Kalliteles, stood beside it.[1874] A Pythian victor, Arkesilas\r\nIV, son of Battos IV, king of Kyrene, who won a victory in the 31st\r\nPythiad (= 462 B. C.), dedicated a chariot at Delphi.[1875] At the\r\nbeginning of the fourth century B. C. the Spartan princess Kyniska\r\nset up “bronze horses less than life-size” in the pronaos of the\r\ntemple of Zeus at Olympia. The recovered base shows that Pausanias was\r\nright about the size of this votive offering.[1876] Theochrestos of\r\nKyrene, who won some time between Ols. (?) 100 and 122 (= 380 and 292\r\nB. C.),[1877] and Glaukon of Athens, who won in the third century B.\r\nC.,[1878] also set up votive chariots. The recovered base of Glaukon’s\r\nchariot shows that it was small. Sometimes a chariot victor, for\r\neconomy’s sake, contented himself with dedicating merely a statue of\r\nhimself in honor of his victory—a custom which continued from the sixth\r\nto the third centuries B. C. Perhaps one of the oldest examples of such\r\na dedication of which we have record is that of the Elean Archidamas,\r\nwho won a victory at an unknown date, but certainly some time after\r\nOl. 66 (= 515 B. C.).[1879] In the fifth century B. C., the Spartans\r\nAnaxandros[1880] and Lykinos[1881] dedicated merely statues of\r\nthemselves. In the fourth century B. C. the Elean victors Timon,[1882]\r\nwhose monument was by Daidalos, Troilos, whose monument was by\r\nLysippos,[1883] and Telemachos, whose statue was by Philonides,[1884]\r\nset up statues in honor of their victories. The footprints on the\r\ninscribed base of the statue of Telemachos show that he was represented\r\nstanding at rest with both feet flat on the ground. This was probably\r\nthe position of the statues of the other two victors mentioned. The\r\nstatue of the Spartan victor Polykles, surnamed _Polychalkos_, stood\r\nin a singular group. He was represented as being greeted on his return\r\nhome by his children, one of whom held a small grace-hoop in his\r\nhand, while the other was trying to snatch the victor ribbon from his\r\nfather’s hand.[1885] We learn from Diogenes Laertios that the tyrant\r\nPeriandros of Corinth vowed to set up a golden statue of himself if he\r\nwon the chariot-race.[1886]\r\n\r\nThe first instance chronologically recorded by Pausanias of a chariot\r\nvictor dedicating his statue along with chariot and horses is that\r\nof king Gelo of Syracuse, the group being the work of the Aeginetan\r\nGlaukias.[1887] The first instance of a victor dedicating his statue in\r\na group with chariot, horses, and charioteer, is that of Kleosthenes\r\nof Epidamnos, the group being the work of the Argive Hagelaïdas.[1888]\r\nEven the names of the horses were inscribed on this monument.[1889] The\r\nowner of the chariot, to be sure, took the prize, but he felt that the\r\nvictory was due to the horses and driver, and so he associated them\r\nwith himself in the monument. Sometimes the victor acted as his own\r\ncharioteer. Thus the Spartan Damonon, already mentioned as the hero of\r\nmany chariot victories in and near Sparta, tells in the inscription\r\nappearing on his votive relief that he was his own charioteer.[1890] In\r\nthe first _Isthmian Ode_ Pindar congratulates Herodotos of Thebes, who\r\nwon the chariot-race (?) in 458 B. C., on not entrusting his chariot\r\nto strangers, but driving it himself.[1891] Thrasyboulos seems to\r\nhave driven his father’s car at the victory commemorated by the sixth\r\n_Pythian Ode_, sung in honor of the chariot victory of Xenokrates of\r\nAkragas in 490 B. C. at Delphi. Karrhotos, the charioteer of Arkesilas\r\nof Kyrene already mentioned, was the latter’s brother-in-law.[1892]\r\nSimilarly Aigyptos appears to have ridden his own horse at Olympia\r\ninstead of entrusting it to a jockey.[1893] Sophokles, in the\r\n_Electra_, has the hero Orestes drive his own chariot at the _Pythia_.\r\nKyniska, the daughter of king Archidamas of Sparta, was the first\r\nwoman to enter the contests at the race-course and the first to win an\r\nOlympic victory with her chariot.[1894] Apart from the small votive\r\noffering, already mentioned as standing in the temple of Zeus, she had\r\nalso a victor-group at Olympia, by the sculptor Apellas, consisting\r\nof chariot, horses, charioteer, and herself. The rounded form of the\r\nrecovered base,[1895] in connection with the description of Pausanias,\r\npermits us to assume that the statue of the princess stood in front on\r\nthe projecting rounded portion of the pedestal. This is the contention\r\nof Loewy, who opposes the theory of Furtwaengler[1896] that the statue\r\nstood away from the rest of the group, since Pausanias makes no mention\r\nof such an arrangement. In any case, the charioteer in the group can\r\nnot have been separated from the car.\r\n\r\nIn an unpublished paper by my former teacher, Dr. Alfred Emerson, which\r\nwas read by Professor D. M. Robinson before the Archæological Institute\r\nof America at its Christmas meeting in Providence in 1910, and entitled\r\n_The Case of Kyniska_,[1897] the argument was made that the chariot was\r\nin miniature; that the statue of Kyniska was a portrait, because of the\r\nwording of the recovered epigram; and, lastly that the smallest of the\r\nso-called bronze dancers from the villa of the Pisos in Herculaneum,\r\nnow in Naples, is a late reproduction of the statue at Olympia by\r\nApellas. Emerson thinks that Pliny no doubt often visited the villa and\r\nmay well have had these statues in mind when he mentioned Apellas as\r\nthe author of several statues of women adorning themselves.[1898]\r\n\r\nThe monument erected by Hiero, son of Deinomenes and brother and\r\nsuccessor of king Gelo at Syracuse, who won two horse-races and a\r\nfour-horse chariot victory at Olympia in Ols. 76, 77, 78 (= 476-468\r\nB. C.),[1899] consisted of a bronze chariot, on which the charioteer\r\nwas mounted, and on either side a race-horse with a jockey on each.\r\nOnatas made the chariot (and possibly the statue of the driver), while\r\nKalamis sculptured the horses and jockeys. Such a division among\r\nsculptors was not uncommon at Olympia. Thus the Aeginetan artist\r\nSimon and the Argive Dionysios made a group in common for Phormis,\r\nwhich we have already mentioned, consisting of two horses and two\r\ncharioteers.[1900] The Chian Pantias and the Aeginetan Philotimos made\r\na group in common for Xenombrotos of Kos, victor in horse-racing, and\r\nfor his son, the boy boxer Xenodikos, which consisted of statues of\r\nthe man and the boy on horseback.[1901] Pliny mentions a four-horse\r\nchariot-group for which the elder Praxiteles made the charioteer and\r\nKalamis the chariot, adding that Praxiteles did this out of kindness,\r\nnot wishing it to be thought that Kalamis had failed in representing\r\nthe man after succeeding in representing the horses.[1902]\r\n\r\nIn some of the Olympic chariot-groups doubtless the charioteer was\r\nrepresented at the moment of entering the chariot or already in it.\r\nSometimes a figure of Nike took the place of the charioteer, in order\r\nthat the victor’s exploit might be more exalted. Thus Pausanias, in\r\nmentioning the bronze chariot of Kratisthenes of Kyrene by Pythagoras\r\nof Rhegion,[1903] says that statues of Nike and Kratisthenes himself\r\nare mounted upon the car. The Nike in some cases was replaced by the\r\nfigure of a young maiden, who stood beside the victor, as in the cases\r\nof the Elean Timon[1904] and the Macedonian Lampos.[1905] Pliny notes a\r\nsimilar example in reference to the chariot of Teisikrates, a Delphian\r\nvictor in the two-horse chariot-race.[1906] The maiden in all these\r\ncases may have been merely a Nike personified or a mortal.[1907] Pliny\r\nrecords that the painter Nikomachos, son and pupil of Aristeides,\r\npainted a _Victoria quadrigam in sublime rapiens_.[1908] The figure\r\nof Nike appears often on reliefs. Thus on a terra-cotta sarcophagus\r\nfrom Klazomenai we see a two-horse chariot driven by a boy, while\r\nalongside is a winged female figure—Iris or Nike—mounting it.[1909]\r\nThe moment of victory is shown on an Attic marble votive relief\r\nrepresenting a four-horse chariot, now in the British Museum. Here a\r\nfigure of Nike is represented as floating in the air and extending\r\na wreath (now wanting) towards the head of the charioteer, who is\r\ndraped with a tunic girdled at the waist, as he mounts the car. If\r\nthe charioteer in this relief is a female (which is doubtful), it may\r\nhe the personification of the city to which the winner belongs.[1910]\r\nOn a votive relief in Athens a horse is represented as being crowned\r\nby Nike.[1911] On a relief in Madrid Nike is represented as driving\r\na chariot.[1912] A quadriga with a female figure, apparently Nike,\r\nappears on a relief dedicated to Hermes and the Nymphs, which was found\r\nin Phaleron.[1913] Doubtless some of the chariot-groups at Olympia\r\nrepresented movement—the start, the course, or the end of the race—as\r\ndo these and similar reliefs.[1914] We should add that the figure of\r\nNike was not confined to equestrian monuments. On the Ficoroni cista\r\nin Rome is represented the boxing match between Polydeukes and Amykos\r\namong the Bebrykes. In the centre we see Amykos hanged to a tree by the\r\nhands, while to the right stands Athena, and above her Nike is flying\r\nwith a crown and fillet of victory for Polydeukes.[1915]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAINS OF CHARIOT-GROUPS.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion of the literary evidence about the monuments\r\nof chariot victors at Olympia and elsewhere, we shall turn to a\r\nbrief consideration of certain existing works of sculpture, reliefs\r\nand statues, which will serve to illustrate the manner in which the\r\nsculptor represented this class of victor monuments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—Charioteer Mounting a Chariot. Bas-relief from\r\nthe Akropolis. Akropolis Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nThe motive of representing a figure in the act of mounting a\r\nchariot is old. Amphiaraos was thus represented on the chest of\r\nKypselos at Olympia[1916] and appears in a similar pose on the b.-f.\r\nCorinthian vase from Cerveteri, now in Berlin, which we have already\r\nmentioned.[1917] Among reliefs we shall first discuss the Parian (?)\r\nmarble one found in 1822 near the Propylaia at Athens and now in the\r\nAkropolis Museum (Fig. 63).[1918] Here we see represented a robed\r\nfigure stepping into a chariot, holding the reins in the extended\r\nhands. This Attic work, perhaps dating from the very beginning of the\r\nfifth century B. C., has long been admired for its vigor and grace.\r\nWhether the figure is male or female, human or divine, is still a\r\nmatter of debate. The head is too badly weathered to make the decision\r\nfinal. The upper part of the figure of Hermes (?) on another fragment,\r\nwhich appears to come from the same relief and which was found near the\r\nsouth wall of the Akropolis in 1859,[1919] has made it seem reasonable\r\nto call the charioteer a god, perhaps Apollo.[1920] The hair of\r\nHermes and of the charioteer is arranged in the old Attic _krobylos_\r\nfashion. This also makes it natural to interpret the charioteer as\r\nmale, despite the slender and delicate arms and hands, which appear to\r\nbe female.[1921] But such effeminate male figures are not unknown to\r\nAttic art, which was characterized by grace and softness.[1922] The\r\nline of the breast, however, shows no such fulness as archaic masters\r\nwere wont to give to female forms, and hence this figure may very well\r\nbe that of a male. Schrader has tried to refer the slab to the frieze\r\nof the Old Temple of Athena, which, he believes, survived the sack of\r\nthe Akropolis by Xerxes,[1923] thus assuming a chariot-frieze similar\r\nto the later one appearing on the Mausoleion at Halikarnassos, which\r\nantedated similar scenes on the Parthenon frieze by nearly a century.\r\nAs the Parthenon slabs represent mortal charioteers, who are doubtless\r\nmales, the relief may also represent a mortal. However, the Akropolis\r\nrelief may have had nothing to do with any temple frieze nor with the\r\nadornment of a great altar of Athena, as Furtwaengler contended,[1924]\r\nbut may be from a votive monument set up by a chariot victor.[1925]\r\n\r\nWe see a good representation in relief of a chariot-group on one side\r\nof the arched roof of the so-called Chimæra tomb discovered by Sir\r\nCharles Fellows at Xanthos in Lykia. Here is represented a chariot\r\ndrawn by four horses, in which stands a charioteer, with sleeved tunic\r\nand Phrygian cap, and an armed figure. Because of the figure of the\r\nChimæra in the lower right-hand corner, the charioteer, despite the\r\nabsence of Pegasos, has been called Bellerophon.[1926]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APOBATES CHARIOT-RACE.\r\n\r\nOn the north frieze of the Parthenon there were originally at least\r\n9 four-horse chariot groups,[1927] while on the south frieze there\r\nwere 10 such groups.[1928] These various groups represent a ceremonial\r\nchariot-race called the _apobates_, known at Athens and in Bœotia\r\nand a favorite contest at the Panathenaic games.[1929] This race\r\npreserved the tradition of Homeric warfare, when the chieftain was\r\ndriven to battle in his chariot, but dismounted to fight, remounting\r\nonly to pursue or avoid his enemy. During the race, while the\r\ncharioteer kept the horses at full speed, the _apobates_ dismounted,\r\nran alongside the chariot, and mounted again. In the last lap he\r\ndismounted and ran beside the chariot to the goal.[1930] In the North\r\nfrieze we see the charioteer in the chariot, and the _apobates_, armed\r\nwith shield and helmet, either stepping down from the chariot or\r\nstanding beside it; while a third figure, a marshal, stands nearby.\r\nThus on slab XIV we see the _apobates_ about to step down; on slab XV\r\nhe is standing up in the chariot; on slab XVII (Fig. 64) he is leaning\r\nback, supporting himself by means of his right hand, which grasps\r\nthe chariot rail, and is just ready to step down; on slab XXII he is\r\nremounting the chariot. In the scenes on the South frieze, on the\r\nother hand, the _apobates_ is not represented as dismounting, but is\r\nstanding either inside the chariot or by its side. The South frieze,\r\ntherefore, represents preparation or the beginning of the race, while\r\nthe North one represents the actual course. There is, therefore, as\r\nGardiner points out, no need to accept Michaelis’ theory that the two\r\nfriezes portray different motives, the North one representing the\r\n_apobates_ at the games and the South one representing war-chariots.\r\nThe double character of the race is shown by inscriptions which make\r\nboth charioteer and _apobates_ equally victors. Many other reliefs\r\nshow the _apobates_ dismounting. Thus, on a fragmentary relief found\r\nin 1886 at the Amphiareion at Oropos and now in Athens,[1931] we see\r\na nude and beardless youth standing in a chariot, which is moving\r\nrapidly to the left. He has a helmet on his head and a shield in his\r\nleft hand and holds on to the rim of the chariot, as in the Parthenon\r\nfrieze slab just mentioned. To his right is a charioteer with his arms\r\noutstretched to hold the reins. As this relief is obviously influenced\r\nby the Parthenon frieze, it must stand midway between that frieze and\r\nthe Hellenistic relief to be described below. Another relief, found\r\nat Oropos in 1835[1932] and dating from the first half of the fourth\r\ncentury B. C., represents a four-horse chariot moving to the left and\r\ncontaining two persons. One is the charioteer, who has long waving hair\r\nand a short beard and is clothed in the usual long tunic; the other\r\nis a nude _apobates_, who is armed with helmet and shield and holds\r\non to the rim of the chariot with his right hand, the upper part of\r\nhis body being inclined backwards, the knees bent, and the shield held\r\naway from the body.[1933] We can not say whether these two reliefs from\r\nthe Amphiareion represent offerings of _apobatai_, who were victorious\r\nat races held in Oropos or elsewhere in Bœotia, or represent the\r\nvictorious Panathenaic _apobatai_. They may well be _ex votos_ to\r\nthe hero Amphiaraos at the games held in Oropos. We see an excellent\r\nillustration of an _apobates_ in the very act of dismounting on a\r\nHellenistic votive relief discovered in 1880 on the Akropolis, which\r\ndates from the end of the fourth century B. C.[1934] A marble relief,\r\nsupposably from Herculaneum, but now in Portugal,[1935] represents a\r\nfigure dressed in a long chiton. Wolters suggests that it may represent\r\nan _apobates_, but the absence of the usual armor makes it probable\r\nthat a charioteer is intended. In a future section we shall discuss the\r\n_apobates_ in the horse-race at Olympia known as κάλπη.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—Apobates and Chariot. Relief from the North\r\nFrieze of the Parthenon, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—Charioteer. Relief from the small Frieze of the\r\nMausoleion, Halikarnassos. British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUES OF CHARIOTEERS.\r\n\r\nThe best-preserved slab from the small Parian marble chariot-frieze\r\nfrom the Mausoleion of Halikarnassos, now in the British Museum,\r\nrepresents a male figure standing in a chariot (Fig. 65).[1936]\r\nThis long-haired charioteer, dressed in a tunic which extends to\r\nthe feet and is girded at the waist, is leaning forward in an eager\r\nattitude. The folds of his garment curved to the wind show the speed\r\nof his horses, and the mutilated face discloses a look of intense\r\nexcitement. The deep-set eyes and overhanging brows recall the Tegea\r\nheads of Skopas (Fig. 73) and the combatants pictured on the so-called\r\n_Alexander Sarcophagus_ discovered near Sidon in 1887 and now in\r\nConstantinople.[1937] The pose is so characteristic and spirited that\r\nit was copied by later artists on reliefs and gems.[1938] The same\r\npose, forward inclination of the body, half-opened mouth, and intense\r\nlook seem to be reproduced in a statue of the fourth century B. C. now\r\nin the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (Pl. 27).[1939] Robinson, because\r\nof the similarity of its head to certain heads of Apollo published by\r\nOverbeck,[1940] interpreted this statue as Apollo starting to run. Von\r\nMach, however, has pointed out that its head bears a more striking\r\nresemblance to that of a _Kore_ in Vienna.[1941] Klein interpreted it\r\nas a jumper, assuming that the two supports on the legs were for the\r\nwrists, indicating that the arms were held downwards, the hands, then,\r\nholding _halteres_. But von Mach makes it clear that these supports\r\nare not parallel, as Klein thought, but that they diverge outwards\r\nand consequently may have made the connection with the sides of a\r\nchariot rim. Furthermore, the likeness to the figure on the Mausoleion\r\nfrieze (Fig. 65) makes it probable that we are here concerned with\r\na charioteer. The objection to this theory on the ground of nudity\r\nis baseless. Though the conventional garb of the charioteer in Greek\r\nart from the eighth century B. C. onwards[1942] was certainly a long,\r\nclose-fitting chiton, there are several examples in existence of\r\nnude charioteers.[1943] Similarly the objection that the artificial\r\nhead-dress does not belong to a charioteer is equally erroneous. Klein\r\nhas shown that it appears on several heads of boys, and, as von Mach\r\nsays, it is certainly no better suited to Apollo or a jumper than to\r\na boy driving colts in a chariot-race. The pose of the Boston statue\r\nalso reminds us somewhat of that of the small bronze statue of a boy\r\nfound in the Rhine near Xanten in 1858 and now in Berlin.[1944] This\r\nis a Roman work seemingly inspired by a Greek prototype, and has been\r\ninterpreted variously as the statue of _Bonus Eventus, Novus Annus_,\r\nand Dionysos. However, here again the forward inclination of the\r\nbody points to the interpretation of a charioteer,[1945] despite its\r\nnudity. The nude statue found on the Esquiline in 1874 and now in the\r\nPalazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, which has already been mentioned,[1946]\r\nhas been shown to be that of a charioteer by a comparison with\r\nfigures on Attic vases which represent mortals and gods entering\r\nchariots, and with a figure on the so-called _Satrap Sarcophagus_ in\r\nConstantinople.[1947] The youth is represented as standing on his left\r\nfoot; he places his right on the chariot floor and extends his hands\r\nto hold the reins. The statue seems to be a mediocre Roman copy of a\r\nGreek original bronze of about the middle of the fifth century _B.\r\nC._, as it shows certain traces of archaism. Furtwaengler has assigned\r\nit to the sculptor Kalamis along with a closely connected group of\r\nmonuments.[1948]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 27\r\n\r\nStatue of a Charioteer (?). Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—Bronze Statue of the Delphi _Charioteer_.\r\nMuseum of Delphi.]\r\n\r\nFinally, in this connection, even though it has nothing to do with\r\nmonuments set up at Olympia, we shall discuss the life-size bronze\r\nstatue of the _Charioteer_ discovered by the French in 1896 in the\r\nexcavations of Delphi, and now the cynosure of the village museum\r\nthere. (Fig. 66.)[1949] This example of ripe archaic art is one of\r\nthe finest bronzes yet recovered in Greece. Its ancient fame is\r\ndisclosed by the fact that it was copied in many monuments down to\r\nthe end of antiquity.[1950] The figure is clothed in a short-sleeved\r\nchiton, which reached nearly to the ground, and is girded above the\r\nwaist. With the figure were found also fragments of reins, which were\r\nheld in the extended right hand, portions of three horses, a chariot\r\npole, and the left arm and hand of a second figure, that of a boy or\r\nwoman, showing that the _Charioteer_ was part of a group. The group\r\nrested on a base on which was cut a two-line metrical inscription, the\r\nends of which are preserved. The first line ends Πολύζαλός μ’ ἀνέθηκεν.\r\nA part of the inscription is lost and another part, including the above\r\nwords, is written over the erased original, which is still partly\r\nlegible. The original inscription gives the name of the first dedicator\r\nas ending in ιλας. From this ending Professor Washburn recovers the\r\nname Ἀρκεσίλας. He refers the original dedication to Arkesilas IV of\r\nKyrene,[1951] and identifies it with the group known from Pausanias to\r\nhave been dedicated at Delphi by the people of Kyrene, representing\r\nBattos and the figure of Libya crowning him in a chariot and the\r\ncharioteer personified as Kyrene outside, the whole being the work of\r\nthe Knossian sculptor Amphion.[1952] Svoronos[1953] follows Washburn’s\r\nsuggestion and identifies the _Charioteer_ with Battos, believing that\r\nthe fragment of the left arm found with the statue is from the statue\r\nof Kyrene represented as a charioteer.[1954] Ingenious as the theory\r\nis, there are chronological difficulties in the way of accepting it\r\nunreservedly. Thus Amphion’s pupil Pison worked on the Spartan memorial\r\nof Aigospotamoi at Delphi in 404 B. C.[1955] Furthermore, the ending\r\nιλας may equally well refer to Anaxilas, the tyrant of Rhegion, as\r\nthe original dedicator,[1956] in which case it seems reasonable to\r\nassume that the group might have been the work of Pythagoras, the great\r\nsculptor of Rhegion.[1957] A Greek scholar believes that the original\r\ndedicator was Gelo, and that his name was erased and replaced by that\r\nof his brother Polyzalos; he consequently dates the group shortly\r\nafter Gelo’s death in 478 B. C.[1958] He refers it to Glaukias of\r\nAegina, while Joubin[1959] classes the _Charioteer_ as an Attic work.\r\nHowever, the whole subject of Greek sculpture in the years just after\r\nthe Persian war period is too complicated to name definitely the artist\r\nof this simple and severe work. Its deficiencies are as apparent as\r\nits virtues. Thus the parallel folds of the chiton show little of the\r\nform beneath; the feet are too flatly placed on the ground, and the\r\ncontour of the head and face is not altogether graceful.[1960] Whatever\r\nthe original purpose of the group was, it may well have been used by\r\nPolyzalos to honor the Pythian victory of his brother Hiero.[1961] From\r\nit, then, we can get, perhaps, an idea of the magnificence of Hiero’s\r\nmonument by Onatas and Kalamis at Olympia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATIONS OF VICTORS IN THE HORSE-RACE AT OLYMPIA AND ELSEWHERE.\r\n\r\nThe hippic victor at Olympia frequently dedicated merely the model of\r\nhis victorious horse without the jockey, just as the early chariot\r\nvictor dedicated a chariot without the charioteer. We have evidence\r\nof several instances of this custom from the sixth century B. C. on.\r\nKrokon of Eretria dedicated a small horse of bronze in the Altis.[1962]\r\nThe Corinthian Pheidolas dedicated a model of his horse alone, but\r\nfor a different reason.[1963] The jockey who rode for him fell off at\r\nthe start, but the mare, named _Aura_, continued the race and reached\r\nthe goal as victor. The owner was allowed by the judges to set up\r\na monument to her. The sons of Pheidolas were also victors in the\r\nhorse-race[1964] and set up a horse on a column with an epigram upon\r\nit—ἵππος ἐπὶ στήλῃ πεποιημένος καὶ ἐπίγραμμά ἐστιν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ. Just how\r\nthis monument looked is doubtful. Pausanias may have seen the bronze\r\nhorse of the father Pheidolas, and nearby a column with a bas-relief\r\nrepresenting the horse of the sons;[1965] or the horse may have stood\r\non top of the column in the round, since the epigram was ἐπ’ αὐτῷ (on\r\nthe horse) and not ἐπ’ αὐτῇ (on the stele).[1966]\r\n\r\nMore frequently a jockey was seated upon the model of the horse, just\r\nas we see frequently on vase-paintings. In the Olympic monument of\r\nKing Hiero already mentioned, race-horses with boys seated upon them\r\nstood on either side of the chariot in honor of his two victories in\r\nthe horse-race and one in the chariot-race.[1967] Another Olympia\r\ngroup represented the boy horse-racer Aigyptos on horseback, and his\r\nfather, the chariot victor Timon, standing beside him.[1968] This is\r\nalso a case in which the victor (Aigyptos) acted as his own jockey.\r\nIn the group representing Xenombrotos of Kos, the horse-racer, and\r\nhis son, the boy boxer Xenodikos, by the Aeginetan Philotimos and the\r\nChian Pantias respectively, the boy was seated on a horse and the\r\nstatue of the father stood nearby.[1969] The base of this group has\r\nbeen recovered, large enough to have carried the two monuments.[1970]\r\nPliny says that the sculptors Kanachos and Hegias made groups of\r\nhorse-racers.[1971] We have seen that Pausanias mentions others by\r\nKalamis and Daidalos. The work of Kalamis, the immediate predecessor\r\nof Pheidias, an artist noted for his grace and softness and as an\r\nunrivaled sculptor of horses,[1972] must have been excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONUMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE HORSE-RACE.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the monuments which illustrate the horse-race, we find\r\nas varied a number—vase-paintings, reliefs, coins, statuary, etc.—as in\r\nthe case of chariot victors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—Horse-Racer. From a Sixth-Century B. C. b.-f.\r\nPanathenaic Vase. British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nVase-paintings show that the jockey was generally nude and rode without\r\nstirrups or saddle. We see nude long-haired jockeys on horseback with\r\nwhips pictured on a sixth-century B. C. Panathenaic amphora in the\r\nBritish Museum.[1973] One also appears on a silver tetradrachm in\r\nthe same museum, which commemorates the Olympic victory of Philip II\r\nof Macedonia.[1974] Here the victorious mounted jockey has a palm in\r\nhis hand, the symbol of his victory. On the other hand, the jockey is\r\nsometimes represented as wearing a close-fitting short-sleeved chiton.\r\nWe see such a one on an archaic b.-f. Panathenaic vase of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C. in the British Museum (Fig. 67).[1975] In front of the\r\nmounted youth on this vase stands a herald in official robes, from\r\nwhose mouth issue the words “the horse of Dyneiketos is victorious.”\r\nBehind the jockey is an attendant bearing a wreath in his left hand and\r\nholding a prize tripod over his head. The short chiton also appears on\r\na horse-racer on the Amphiaraos vase.[1976] We see racing boys on a\r\nproto-Corinthian lekythos in the museum at Taranto, with tripods as\r\nprizes.[1977] A fine example of five nude horse-racers also appears on\r\na vase pictured in the Daremberg-Saglio Dictionary.[1978] Here one has\r\nfallen from his horse and is being dragged by the bridle.\r\n\r\nA boy on a galloping horse is shown on a terra-cotta relief from\r\nThera.[1979] On a funerary marble relief from Sicily, now in the Museo\r\nGregoriano, Rome, a rider is represented urging his horse on with\r\na whip.[1980] An Athenian relief shows victorious ephebes leading\r\nhorses,[1981] while another from Athens shows a mounted boy.[1982]\r\nHorsemen representing Athenian knights appear on many slabs of the\r\nParthenon frieze,[1983] either mounted or standing by their horses.\r\n\r\nThe inscribed base of Onatas found on the Akropolis seems to have borne\r\nthe statue of a horse-racer.[1984] The bronze statue of Isokrates at\r\nAthens, which represented him as a παῖς κελητίζων, is mentioned by\r\nthe pseudo-Plutarch.[1985] A bronze statuette in Athens from Dodona\r\nrepresents an ephebe on a galloping horse.[1986] A statue in the\r\nPalazzo Orlandi in Florence represents a horse-rider.[1987] In the\r\nAkropolis Museum there are two monuments which we should mention in\r\nthis connection. One is the lower part of the statue of a nude rider on\r\nhorseback, the mutilated horse being represented as pawing the ground\r\nwith its forefoot. Closely resembling it in scale and finish, though\r\nmore developed in style, is another fragmentary statue of a horse\r\nwithout a rider, the latter probably to be understood as standing in\r\nfront of the horse, as in some of the riders pictured on the Parthenon\r\nfrieze. The two are good examples of pre-Persian Attic sculpture.[1988]\r\nA later example is the small bronze statuette of an ephebe represented\r\nas a horseman (the horse is lacking) discovered recently at the French\r\nexcavations at Volubilis in Morocco. This almost perfectly preserved\r\nwork has been referred to the first half of the fifth century B.\r\nC.[1989] The position of the hands holding the reins reminds us\r\nstrongly of the Delphi _Charioteer_ (Fig. 66). The diadem in the hair\r\nshows that a victor is represented. A small bronze statuette in the\r\nLoeb collection in Munich represents a boy riding a prancing horse,\r\nwhich is standing on its hind legs. This vigorous, but poorly finished,\r\nwork is decorative in character and probably once belonged to the crown\r\nof a candelabrum. It appears to be either an Etruscan or early Roman\r\nwork based on a Hellenistic original.[1990]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APOBATES HORSE-RACE.\r\n\r\nIn a previous section we discussed the _apobates_ chariot-race run at\r\nthe Panathenaic games in Athens, in which the _apobates_ leaped down\r\nand ran to the goal abreast of the chariot. We shall now briefly speak\r\nof a similar race at Olympia (the κάλπη) in which the rider leaped\r\nfrom his mare in the last lap and ran with her to the goal.[1991]\r\nThere is no certain illustration in sculpture or on vase-paintings of\r\nthis race, but Gardiner believes that something like it appears on\r\ncoins of Tarentum, on which a nude youth, armed with a small round\r\nshield, is represented in the act of jumping from his horse.[1992]\r\nThe military character of this race, like that of the _apobates_\r\nchariot-race discussed, is shown by the shield held in the left hand of\r\nthe dismounting horseman. Helbig has shown that the Greek knight of the\r\nsixth century B. C. was merely a mounted infantryman, the successor of\r\nthe Homeric warrior who used his chariot merely for pursuit or flight,\r\nwhile actually fighting from the ground.[1993] Just so the knight rode\r\nto battle on his horse, but dismounted when near the enemy, leaving\r\nthe horse in charge of his squire, as the Homeric chieftain left his\r\nchariot in charge of his charioteer. This old custom of the heroic age\r\nsurvived not only in the Panathenaic chariot-race, but also, for a few\r\nyears in the fifth century B. C., in the Olympic mare-race known as\r\nthe κάλπη. It seems to have been instituted there for military reasons\r\nin order to revive the old form of fighting that had gone out of use\r\njust at the close of the sixth century B. C., but it endured for only a\r\nhalf century, from Ols. 71 to 84 (= 496 to 444 B. C.). The corresponding\r\nchariot-race at Athens and elsewhere continued at least to the end of\r\nthe fourth century B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATIONS OF MUSICAL VICTORS AT OLYMPIA AND ELSEWHERE.\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter we shall say a few words about monuments\r\nerected to trumpeters, heralds, and musical victors at Olympia, though\r\nsuch contests had nothing to do with athletics.\r\n\r\nContests for trumpeters and heralds were held in many parts of\r\nGreece.[1994] They were introduced at Olympia in Ol. 96 (= 396 B.\r\nC.), when Timaios of Elis won as trumpeter and Krates of Elis as\r\nherald.[1995] Pausanias mentions an altar, near the entrance to the\r\nstadion, upon which trumpeters and heralds stood when competing.[1996]\r\nSuch contests seem to have been mere displays of lung power. Herodoros,\r\nfor example, who won as trumpeter at Olympia ten times in the last\r\nquarter of the fourth and beginning of the third century B. C.[1997],\r\ncould blow two trumpets at once so loud that no one could stand near\r\nhim.[1998] To perform such a feat he was said to be a very large\r\nman.[1999] Diogenes, son of Dionysios of Ephesos, won five victories\r\nin trumpeting at Olympia. He was twice _periodonikes_ and also won\r\nmany other victories at the Isthmus, Nemea, and elsewhere—eighty in\r\nall.[2000] We have an excellent bronze statuette of a trumpeter,\r\nwhich was found in the Hieron of Athena Chalkioikos at Sparta, dating\r\nfrom the middle of the fifth century B. C., about a century and a\r\nhalf before the event was introduced at Olympia.[2001] This “little\r\nmasterpiece of Spartan art,” whose style resembles that of the Olympia\r\npediment sculptures, represents a nude man standing, the left arm\r\nhanging by his side, while the right is bent upwards to the mouth,\r\nwhere it held a tubular object pointing upwards. Since the lips are\r\ntightly compressed, Dickins has interpreted the object as a trumpet. A\r\nmuch damaged bronze statuette in the British Museum represents a man\r\nplaying on a long trumpet-shaped instrument.[2002] Trumpeters also\r\nappear now and then on r.-f. Attic vases of the middle of the fifth\r\ncentury B. C.\r\n\r\nMusic victors played a greater role at Delphi than elsewhere, since\r\nmusic from the first was the chief interest there. Monuments to such\r\nvictors, though few in number, by little-known artists were set up\r\nthere, but they seem to have enjoyed the same meagre honor at Delphi\r\nas the statues of athletic victors.[2003] We have record of a statue\r\nof the Epizephyrian Locrian _kitharoidos_ Eunomos, set up in his\r\nnative town in honor of his Pythian victory over Ariston of Rhegion.\r\nTimaios says that this monument showed a cicada seated on the singer’s\r\nlyre.[2004] Whether such monuments at Delphi or elsewhere were regarded\r\nas victor or votive in character, we can not say.[2005] Pausanias\r\nmentions several statues of poets and musicians, mostly mythical, on\r\nMount Helikon, which were set up partly in consequence of victories\r\nwon there or elsewhere.[2006] Of these the statue of the Thracian\r\nor Odrysian Thamyris was represented as a blind man holding a broken\r\nlyre;[2007] that of Arion of Methymna as riding a dolphin;[2008] that\r\nof Hesiod, seated, as holding a lute on his knees; and that of the\r\nThracian Orpheus with Telete at his side and round about beasts in\r\nstone and bronze listening to his song. Of the statue of the Argive\r\nSakadas, Pausanias says that the sculptor, not understanding Pindar’s\r\npoem on the victor, made the flutist no bigger than the flute.[2009]\r\nThe epigram on the statue of the Sikyonian flutist Bacchiadas,\r\nmentioned by Athenæus as standing on Mount Helikon,[2010] was votive\r\nin character. The inscribed base of the statue of the _kitharoidos_\r\nAlkibios has been found on the Athenian Akropolis.[2011] Musical\r\ncontests are pictured on many imitation Panathenaic vases, and many\r\nGreek reliefs seem to have been set up in honor of such victors. Among\r\nthe latter we might instance the one in the Louvre representing Apollo,\r\nArtemis, and Leto,[2012] and another found in Sparta in 1885, which\r\nrepresents Artemis pouring a libation before Apollo.[2013]\r\n\r\nAt Olympia flute-playing accompanied certain of the events of the\r\npentathlon. Pausanias says that the reason why the flute played a\r\nPythian air while the athletes jumped was that this air was sacred\r\nto Apollo, who had beaten Hermes in running and Ares in boxing at\r\nOlympia.[2014] Thus on the chest of Kypselos a flutist was represented\r\nas standing between Admetos and Mopsos at their boxing match.[2015]\r\nBut the explanation given by Philostratos seems more sensible, that\r\nleaping was a difficult contest, and that the flute stimulated the\r\njumpers.[2016] At Argos, at the games in honor of Zeus Σθένιος,\r\nwrestlers contended to the tune of the flute.[2017] Many vase-paintings\r\nillustrate flute-playing at the pentathlon.[2018] At Olympia only a\r\nfew monuments were set up in honor of musical victors, and these seem\r\nto have been statues erected _honoris causa_, instead of primarily for\r\nvictories. An example is that of the Sikyonian flutist Pythokritos, who\r\nwon a victory as αὐλητής in the sixth century B. C.[2019] Pausanias\r\nsays that his monument was that of a small man with a flute wrought\r\nin relief on an inscribed slab. The explanation of such a description\r\nprobably is that the size of the flute made the victor appear small,\r\njust as in the case of the monument of Sakadas just mentioned.[2020]\r\nWe know that artists, poets, prose writers, musicians, and actors all\r\nhad an audience at Olympia, and that statues were often erected there\r\nin honor of such men, though these are not to be treated as victor\r\nmonuments and do not properly fall within the scope of the present\r\nwork.[2021]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTWO MARBLE HEADS FROM VICTOR STATUES.[2022]\r\n\r\nPLATES 28-30 AND FIGURES 68-77.\r\n\r\nTHE GROUP OF DAOCHOS AT DELPHI, AND LYSIPPOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in these later years our knowledge of Skopas has been greatly\r\naugmented by the discovery of the Tegea heads (Fig. 73), that of\r\nLysippos has been almost revolutionized. With the discovery in\r\n1894 at Delphi of the group of statues dedicated by the Thessalian\r\nDaochos[2023] in honor of various members of his house, whose dates\r\ncovered nearly two centuries,[2024] an entirely new impetus was\r\ngiven to the study of the last of the great Greek sculptors. Homolle\r\nimmediately recognized the fourth-century origin of the group, and at\r\nfirst pronounced the statue of Agias Lysippan;[2025] later he saw in\r\nthe types, poses, and proportions of the group the mixed influences\r\nof Praxiteles, Skopas, and Lysippos, but referred the _Agias_ to the\r\nschool of Skopas,[2026] while still later he again pronounced it\r\nLysippan.[2027] But its true character was not destined to be long\r\nin doubt. When Erich Preuner[2028] found almost the same metrical\r\ninscription, which was on the base of the best preserved statue of\r\nthe group, that of Agias (Pl. 28 and Fig. 68),[2029] in the traveling\r\njournal of Stackelberg,[2030] copied from a base in Pharsalos, the\r\nThessalian home of Daochos, with the additional information that\r\nLysippos of Sikyon made the statue, our views of the work of that\r\nartist had to undergo a thorough revision. For this discovery brought\r\nthe _Agias_—if not the others of the group—into direct relation to\r\nLysippos by documentary evidence, while the easily recognized Lysippan\r\ncharacteristics of the statue—the slender body and limbs, the small\r\nhead, the proportions and pose—confirmed this connection on stylistic\r\ngrounds. It became clear that Daochos had set up a series of statues\r\nin honor of his ancestors both at Pharsalos and Delphi. Whether the\r\nThessalian group was of bronze, as is generally held, owing to the\r\nwidespread belief that Lysippos worked only in metal, and the Delphian\r\ngroup was composed of contemporary marble copies of those originals,\r\nwill be discussed further on. If the marble group was a copy, we may\r\ninfer that it reproduced the original statues, not mechanically and\r\nlaboriously as was often the case in Roman days, but accurately; for\r\nhaving employed a noted artist in the one case, the dedicator would\r\nhave desired an accurate reproduction of the work in the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 28\r\n\r\nStatue of the Pancratiast Agias, from Delphi. Museum of Delphi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—Head from the Statue of Agias (Pl. 28). Museum\r\nof Delphi.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APOXYOMENOS OF THE VATICAN, AND LYSIPPOS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 29\r\n\r\nStatue of the _Apoxyomenos_, after Lysippos or his School. Vatican\r\nMuseum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nBut another statue, the _Apoxyomenos_, of the Vatican (Pl. 29),[2031]\r\never since its discovery by Canina in 1849, had held the honored\r\nplace of being regarded as the centre of the stylistic treatment\r\nof Lysippos. Seldom has the discovery of a Roman copy of a Greek\r\noriginal proved so important for the study of ancient sculpture as\r\nthis athlete statue, which was found in an appropriate place, in the\r\nruins of a building, which almost certainly was a Roman bath. Despite\r\nunimportant restorations, the statue is well preserved. The fingers of\r\nthe right hand holding the die were wrongly restored by the sculptor\r\nTenerani at the suggestion of Canina who wrongly interpreted the\r\npassage in Pliny (XXXIV, 55), which refers to two works by Polykleitos,\r\n_destringentem se et nudum talo incessentem_, as meaning one and the\r\nsame monument.[2032] This slightly over life-size statue represents\r\na nude athlete, who is standing with legs far apart, employed in\r\nscraping the sand and oil from his extended right arm with a strigil\r\nheld in the left hand. This, as we saw in Chapter III, was a common\r\npalæstra motive.[2033] Despite certain portrait-like features, this\r\nstatue may not represent an individual victor, but, like Myron’s great\r\nwork, an athletic model. The words of Pliny,[2034] which mention one\r\nof the best-known works of Lysippos in antiquity—it heads the list\r\nin his account of the sculptor—as an athlete _destringentem se_,\r\nand his statement in another passage[2035] that Lysippos introduced\r\na new canon into art _capita minora faciendo quam antiqui, corpora\r\ngraciliora siccioraque, per quae proceritas signorum major videretur_,\r\n_i. e._, a canon of bodily proportions essentially different from\r\nthat of Polykleitos, seemed to have their best illustration in the\r\nslender and graceful body and limbs, and noticeably small head of\r\nthis statue. It was, therefore, though admittedly a Roman work, long\r\nregarded as a direct copy of the Lysippan original, and as faithfully\r\nrepresenting his style in every detail.[2036] Such a view, of course,\r\nwas founded entirely on circumstantial evidence, and could not survive\r\nany positive evidence to the contrary which might come to light in the\r\nfuture. G. F. Hill, in speaking of the insufficient evidence on which\r\nthe _Apoxyomenos_ had been accepted as the key to Lysippan style,\r\nrightly remarks: “It is more scientific, until we acquire documentary\r\nevidence of excellent character, to classify our extant examples\r\nof ancient art as representing tendencies rather than men.”[2037]\r\nThe Lysippan character of the Vatican statue had not been seriously\r\nattacked until the discovery of the _Agias_. Its original was certainly\r\na work worthy of Lysippos. Its rhythm, proportions, and fine modeling\r\nhave received praise of connoisseurs ever since its discovery. Its\r\ndifficult pose had been remarkably well executed. While appearing at\r\nrest, the statue suggests vigorous action both by its supple limbs\r\nand the suppressed excitement indicated by the partly opened lips,\r\nan excitement befitting a victorious athlete. Perhaps it was the\r\ndifficulty of such a pose that best explains why the _Apoxyomenos_\r\nhas left no other copy.[2038] The very excellence of the Vatican\r\nstatue prejudiced us in favor of regarding it as an illustration of\r\nLysippos’ ideal of bodily proportions. But we really knew very little\r\nof the original _Apoxyomenos_, only what we gathered from Pliny, that\r\nLysippos made such a statue and that it was carried to Rome by M.\r\nAgrippa and was set up in front of his Thermæ, whence it was removed\r\nby the enamored Tiberius to his bed-chamber, only to be restored when\r\nthe populace remonstrated. As for the proportions of the supposed copy\r\nin question, they only prove that this statue goes back to an original\r\nwhich was not earlier than Lysippos, but not that it was by the master\r\nhimself.[2039] The discovery of the _Agias_ showed us at last on\r\nwhat slender foundations our theory had been built. Despite certain\r\nwell-marked similarities in the pose, proportions, and relatively\r\nsmall head—characteristics which were not even exclusively Lysippan,\r\nsince they are just as prominent in certain other works, _e. g._, in\r\nthe warriors of the Mausoleion frieze—between the _Agias_ and the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_, nevertheless just as striking differences appear, which\r\nmake it difficult to keep both statues as examples of the artistic\r\ntendency of one and the same artist, even if we should assign them to\r\ndifferent periods of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGIAS AND THE APOXYOMENOS COMPARED, AND THE STYLE OF LYSIPPOS.\r\n\r\nThese differences are most apparent in the surface modeling and facial\r\nexpression of the two works. In the _Agias_ the muscles are not\r\nover-emphasized in detail, but show the simple observation of nature\r\ncharacteristic of artists who worked before the scientific study of\r\nanatomy at the Museum of Alexandria had reacted upon sculpture. In the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_, on the other hand, we see an intentional display of the\r\nnew learning in the labored and detailed treatment of the muscles,\r\nwhich disclose a knowledge of anatomy unknown before the Hellenistic\r\nage. This academic treatment, culminating later in such realistic works\r\nas the _Laocoön_ and the _Farnese Herakles_, can hardly have antedated\r\nthe beginning of the third century B. C., when anatomy was studied by\r\nthe physicians Herophilos and Erasistratos, a date after the close\r\nof the activity of Lysippos. We see no trace of this influence in\r\nthe _Agias_. Moreover, the face of the latter discloses the intense\r\nexpression, which is elsewhere seen only in works supposed to be by,\r\nor influenced by, Skopas, which recalls what Plutarch[2040] said of\r\nLysippos’ portraits of Alexander, that they reproduced his masculine\r\nand leonine air (αὐτοῦ τὸ ἀρρενωπὸν καὶ λεοντῶδες); for a comparison\r\nof this face with that of the _Apoxyomenos_, which exhibits the\r\nlifelessness and lack of expression so characteristic of many early\r\nHellenistic works, makes it still more evident that we must be on our\r\nguard against assuming that both works are representative of the same\r\nsculptor. The essential differences in physical type and artistic\r\nexecution between the two statues have been well summarized by K. T.\r\nFrost in a letter published by Prof. Percy Gardner in the latter’s\r\ntreatment of the same subject.[2041] After a careful analysis of these\r\ndifferences, Frost closes by saying: “It is difficult to believe that\r\nthe two statues represent works by the same artist; it is not only\r\nthe type of man, but the way in which that type is expressed which\r\nforms the contrast.” He compares the _Apoxyomenos_ with the _Borghese\r\nWarrior_ (Fig. 43) as true products of the Hellenistic age.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these differences between the two statues, we see\r\nthat our judgment of Lysippan art must depend on how we interpret\r\nthem. We may either flatly reject the _Apoxyomenos_ and put the\r\n_Agias_ in its place as representing the norm of Lysippan art, or\r\nkeep the _Apoxyomenos_ and reject the _Agias_ as evidence; or lastly\r\nwe may keep both as characteristic works of two different periods in\r\nthe artistic career of Lysippos, explaining the differences as the\r\nresult of influence or of the lapse of years. A recent writer, to be\r\nsure, has cut the Gordian knot by rejecting both statues, and placing\r\nthe _Apoxyomenos_ of the Uffizi—which we have treated at length in a\r\npreceding chapter (Pl. 12)—as the key to our knowledge of the art of\r\nLysippos.[2042] But such a solution of the problem raises even more\r\ndifficulties. Long before the _Agias_ came to light some critics,\r\nindeed, had doubted whether the _Apoxyomenos_ really represented\r\nthe work of Lysippos, as its Hellenistic character seemed evident.\r\nThus, in 1877, Ulrich Koehler,[2043] following a still earlier\r\njudgment,[2044] had come to the conclusion that the Vatican statue\r\nwas only a free reproduction of Lysippos’ masterpiece and attributed\r\nits Hellenistic characteristics to the Roman copyist; but even yet\r\nthe school which long recognized the _Apoxyomenos_ as the norm of\r\nLysippos has its supporters,[2045] though many archæologists have\r\nnow supplanted the _Apoxyomenos_ by the _Agias_.[2046] Others, not\r\nwilling to renounce the _Apoxyomenos_ as evidence, accept both it and\r\nthe _Agias_ as characteristic works of the master, appealing to the\r\nlength of his career to explain the differences, and suggesting that\r\nin his youth Lysippos was under the influence of Skopas, but later in\r\nlife attained independence, and followed a more anatomical rendering\r\nfor his athlete statues.[2047] However, despite the fact that other\r\nartists must have influenced Lysippos,[2048] the _Agias_ can not be\r\nshown to be a youthful work of his, nor can the special influence\r\nof Skopas be shown to have been that of master on pupil, but rather\r\nof one great master on another and equally great contemporary. The\r\ndifficulty about penetrating the obscurity surrounding Lysippos comes\r\nlargely from the fact that he borrowed traits from several of his\r\npredecessors and contemporaries. The influence of Polykleitos, Skopas,\r\nand Praxiteles, and especially of the last two, as Homolle emphasized\r\nin his study of the Daochos group,[2049] can be certainly traced in\r\nthe _Agias_. Fräulein Bieber, in a recent article,[2050] while denying\r\nthat Lysippos had anything to do with the Delphian group, tries to\r\nprove that one figure in it shows the influence of Praxiteles, another\r\nthat of Polykleitos, and a third that of Skopas. She believes that\r\nthe sculptor of the _Agias_ had seen the original bronze statue, the\r\nwork of Lysippos, which stood in Pharsalos. However, we may leave any\r\nsuch conclusion to one side, and judge between the _Agias_ and the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_ solely on the merits of the two statues.\r\n\r\nThe differences between them appear to us too great to be reconciled\r\non any such principles as those just rehearsed, for their style and\r\ntechnique seem to represent two distinct periods of art. If one is\r\nto be rejected, the connection of the _Agias_ with Lysippos certainly\r\nrests on better evidence than does the _Apoxyomenos_. By separating\r\nthem completely, it is possible both to assign to Lysippos the early\r\ndate which other evidence points to, and to remove the _Apoxyomenos_\r\nentirely from the fourth century B. C., thus explaining its later\r\nmodeling, comparatively expressionless features, body-build (which\r\nshows the use of three planes, instead of two), and other Hellenistic\r\ndetails. We should, then, see in its original a work not by Lysippos\r\nat all, but by some pupil or later member of his school, a work\r\nretaining merely traces of the style of the master. In thus eliminating\r\nthe _Apoxyomenos_ we are justified in following Homolle’s lead in\r\nassigning the statue of Agias to Lysippos, in spite of arguments which\r\nhave been adduced against attributing it to Lysippos and in spite\r\nof recent criticism of the inscriptions of the Delphian bases, by\r\nwhich Wolters tries to prove that the inscription on the base of the\r\nstatue of Agias, and consequently the _Agias_ itself, antedate the\r\ninscription and dedication at Pharsalos.[2051] We may, therefore, until\r\nfurther discoveries prove the contrary, consider it as the centre of\r\nour treatment of that sculptor. Whether the _Apoxyomenos_ is to be\r\nexplained as emanating from the immediate environment of Lysippos,\r\nor is to be regarded as a work illustrating the last phase of his\r\ndevelopment, or the innovation of another master—in any case it seems\r\nto us clearly to belong to an age essentially different from that which\r\nconceived the _Agias_.[2052]\r\n\r\nAs the _Agias_ is a statue of a victor in the pankration, we can learn\r\nfrom it how Lysippos represented such an athlete. In giving up the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_, we must also give up statues of athletes which have\r\nhitherto been assigned to Lysippos on the basis of their resemblance\r\nto it, and the future ascription of statues of this class must be\r\nbased on stylistic resemblances to the statue of Agias. Thus, for\r\nexample, we should give up the statue of a youth in Berlin, and the\r\ntwo statues of athletes represented in lunging attitudes in Dresden,\r\nwhich Furtwaengler, on the basis of the _Apoxyomenos_, believed were\r\ncopies of originals by Lysippos,[2053] and the Roman male head in\r\nTurin, published by A. J. B. Wace,[2054] whose original is somewhat\r\nlater than that of the _Apoxyomenos_. On the basis of the _Agias_, on\r\nthe other hand, we may regard as Lysippan the statue of an athlete in\r\nCopenhagen,[2055] and perhaps the Parian marble statue of an athlete\r\nfrom the Palazzo Farnese now in the British Museum,[2056] with copies\r\nin Paris and Rome.[2057] This latter statue Furtwaengler ascribed to\r\nthe school of Kalamis of the fifth century B. C., on account of the\r\nsimilarity of its style to that of the _Apollo-on-the-Omphalos_ (Fig.\r\n7B) and of its motive to that of the _Lansdowne Herakles_ (Fig. 71 and\r\nPl. 30); however, A. H. Smith finds it very similar to the _Agias_, and\r\nso rightly refers it to the fourth century B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD FROM OLYMPIA.\r\n\r\nImpressed by its remarkable likeness to the head of the _Agias_, I\r\nhazarded the opinion some years ago,[2058] that the much discussed\r\nPentelic marble head from Olympia (Frontispiece and Figure 69)[2059]\r\nwas Lysippan, and attempted to bring it into relation with the statue\r\nof the Akarnanian pancratiast (whose name I restored as Philandridas),\r\nwhich Pausanias[2060] says was the work of Lysippos. Since then, after\r\na careful revision of the evidence, this earlier opinion has become\r\nconviction, and I now have no hesitancy in expressing the belief that\r\nin this vigorous marble head we have to do with an original work\r\nby Lysippos himself. It will be our task briefly to rehearse the\r\nreasons for making such an ascription, despite the serious and weighty\r\nobjections which might be raised against it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—Marble Head, from Olympia. Museum of Olympia.]\r\n\r\nAt first this head was ascribed with surprising unanimity to the\r\nschool of Praxiteles,[2061] and subsequently, after the discovery of\r\nthe Tegea heads, with almost equal unanimity to that of Skopas. Treu,\r\nwho first published the head,[2062] pointed out its near relationship\r\nto the _Hermes_ of Praxiteles, which appeared to him to be obvious,\r\nnotwithstanding the injured condition of the chin, nose, mouth, and\r\nbrows. He found the general proportions, the shape of the cranium\r\nand forehead, and the form of the cheeks and mouth the same in both,\r\nwhile the differences, such as the deeper cut and wider opened eyes\r\nwith their γοργόν expression, the hair, and the fact that the head\r\nis harder, leaner, and bonier than that of the _Hermes_, were all\r\nexplained by the different character given to the statue of a victor\r\nor Herakles. Many other archæologists, as Boetticher,[2063] Laloux and\r\nMonceaux,[2064] and Furtwaengler,[2065] have also seen sure signs of\r\nthe hand of Praxiteles or his school in the graceful attitude, delicate\r\nchiseling, and finish of the work. Still others,[2066] however, found\r\nevery characteristic of Skopas in this head. Even Treu in his later\r\ntreatment of the head found it more Skopaic than Praxitelian, and yet,\r\nby a careful analysis,[2067] he conclusively showed that the formation\r\nof the eyes, the opening of the mouth, and the treatment of the hair\r\nwere so different in the heads from Tegea (and especially in that of\r\nthe _Herakles_, Fig. 73) as to preclude the possibility of assigning\r\nthem and the head from Olympia to the same sculptor, and so declared\r\nfor some independent sculptor among the contemporaries of Skopas.\r\nHowever, he did not see Lysippos in this allied but independent artist,\r\nthough he admitted the resemblance of the head in question to that of\r\nthe _Agias_, as also Homolle,[2068] Mahler,[2069] and other critics\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLYMPIA HEAD AND THAT OF THE AGIAS.\r\n\r\nA detailed comparison of this head with that of the _Agias_ will show\r\nwherein the wonderful resemblance—so striking at first glance—consists\r\nand will disclose its Lysippan character. Neither head is a portrait,\r\nnor even individualized; the _Agias_ could be no portrait, for Agias\r\nwas the great-grandfather of Daochos, who enlisted the services of his\r\ncontemporary Lysippos in erecting his statue, and he won his victory\r\nin the pankration more than a century before this statue was set\r\nup.[2070] A glance at the head from Olympia also clearly discloses its\r\nideal character; for it is no portrait of Philandridas, but the victor\r\nκατ’ ἐξοχήν in the pankration. The small head of the _Agias_—under\r\nlife-size—first arrests attention as the chief characteristic of the\r\nwhole statue and (taken with the other proportions of the body) as the\r\nchief mark of its Lysippan origin. As Homolle says, it is not that\r\nsmall heads are not found outside the school of Lysippos or before\r\nhis day—for Myron can furnish examples of them—but it is only with\r\nLysippos and after him that we see a conscious intention of having the\r\nproportions thus reduced. Now the head from Olympia is also less than\r\nlife-size,[2071] but as the head alone is preserved, we can only assume\r\nthat the proportions it bore to the body were similar to those we see\r\nin the statue of Agias. The conformation of the crania of both is, as\r\nin Attic works, round, with small, only slightly projecting occiputs,\r\nas opposed to the squareness of Polykleitan heads, which are longer\r\nfrom front to back and flatter on top—showing how Lysippos in this\r\nrespect departed from the creator of the _Doryphoros_. This cranial\r\nconformation is almost identical in the two heads, as is clearly shown\r\nin Fig. 70, where one is drawn in profile over the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—Profile Drawings of the Heads of the _Agias_\r\nand the _Philandridas_.]\r\n\r\nThe head of the _Agias_ is turned slightly upward and to the left.\r\nTreu found traces of the use of a file on the back of the neck of\r\nthe head from Olympia, which show from their position, what also\r\nwas clear from the muscles of the throat, that this head also was\r\ninclined somewhat to the left and upward, possibly more than that of\r\nthe _Agias_. The outlines of the face—lean and bony in both—are oval,\r\nin the head from Olympia somewhat broader, rounder, and fleshier\r\ntoward the chin. In both the forehead is remarkably low, with a low\r\ndepression or crease in the middle, and with a prominently projecting\r\nsuperciliary arcade, which breaks the continuous line from forehead\r\nto nose very perceptibly. This line is concave above and below, but\r\nconvex at the projection itself, though this is less prominent in the\r\n_Agias_. The powerful framing of the eyes, which are deep-set and\r\nthrown into heavy shadows by the projecting bony structure of the brows\r\nand the overhanging masses of flesh, the eyeballs slightly raised and\r\npeering eagerly into the far distance, the slight upward inclination\r\nof the head, and the prominent forehead drawn together, all combine\r\nto give both heads (though young and vigorous) a pensive, even a sad\r\nlook of heroic dignity, a look seemingly of one who takes no joy nor\r\npleasure in victory, though it is not mournful. This humid and pensive\r\nexpression was doubtless a characteristic of works of Lysippos—it was,\r\nas we know, present in his portraits of Alexander—but he did not treat\r\nit with as great intensity as did Skopas.\r\n\r\nThe eyeballs in both heads are strongly arched, though the inner angles\r\nare not so deep as in Skopaic heads; the raised upper lids form a\r\nsymmetrically narrow and sharply defined border over the eyeball,\r\nand in neither head is this lid covered by a fold of skin at the outer\r\ncorners, as in the Tegea heads; the mass of flesh at the outer corners\r\nis heavier in the head from Olympia, and the expression of the eyes is\r\nmore free and defiant than in the more meditative _Agias_. In both, the\r\ncheek bones are high and prominent. The elegant contour of the lips of\r\nthe _Agias_ is wholly wanting in the head from Olympia, in which the\r\nlips are broken off, like the nose and the chin, but it is clear that\r\nthe lips were slightly parted, just showing the teeth—not, however, as\r\nin the Tegea examples, as if the breath were being drawn with great\r\neffort. The look of pensiveness is also increased by the open lips. The\r\ncontour of the jawbone is not so visible as in the _Agias_, where it is\r\nclearly discernible beneath the closely drawn skin, giving the face a\r\nlook of greater leanness, as of an athlete in perfect training.\r\n\r\nIn both heads the swollen and battered ears, though small, are\r\nprominent, and in both the hair is closely cropped, as becomes the\r\nathlete. The hair of the _Agias_ does not show so much expression as\r\nis displayed in that of some Lysippan heads, nor the fine detail we\r\nshould expect from Pliny’s statement that Lysippos made improvements\r\nin the rendering of the hair[2072]—for it is in great measure only\r\nsketched out. In Lysippan portraits of Alexander the hair is generally\r\nexpressively treated, and this is often the case in early Hellenistic\r\nheads.[2073] However, we should not expect an elaborate treatment of\r\nthe hair in the statue of a pancratiast. The head from Olympia also\r\nshows great simplicity in this regard. As in Skopaic heads, the hair is\r\nfashioned into little ringlets ruffled straight up from the forehead in\r\nflat relief, but here the curls are shorter and more tense. It covers\r\nthe temples and surrounds the ears as in the _Agias_, but it is not,\r\nas there, bounded by a round, floating line across the forehead, nor\r\ndivided into little tufts modeled in relief radiating in concentric\r\ncircles from the top of the head. While lacking in detail, the hair of\r\nthe _Agias_ is treated carefully, and with the greatest variety. Narrow\r\nbands, perhaps the insignia of victory, despite their small size,\r\nencircle both heads; in the _Agias_ the band is dexterously used to\r\nheighten the effect of variety in the hair by alternately flattening\r\nand swelling it here and there. In neither head is there any sign of\r\nthe use of the drill to work out the tufts of the hair; only the chisel\r\nwas used.[2074]\r\n\r\nFinally, the whole expression of these two ideal heads is one of force\r\nand energy, of heroic dignity tempered by pensiveness and pathos,\r\nwhich is, in the head from Olympia at least, even a little dramatic.\r\nBoth heads, while ideal, show close observation of nature in modeling\r\nand expression; and both show the predilection of Lysippos for types\r\nin which force and energy predominate, and his indifference to the\r\nsofter and more delicate types of manly beauty so characteristic of his\r\ncontemporary, Praxiteles.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing comparison, we have tacitly assumed that this marble\r\nhead is from an athlete statue, and, moreover, that it, as the _Agias_,\r\nrepresents a victor in the pankration, though many have seen in it\r\nthe representation not of a victor, but of a youthful Herakles.[2075]\r\nThe swollen ears and the band in the hair might pass equally well for\r\neither, just as the fact that it was unearthed near the ruins of the\r\nGreat Gymnasion (if it were necessary to assume that the statue once\r\nstood there) might be adduced as evidence for either interpretation;\r\nfor statues of athletes as well as those of Herakles and Hermes (as\r\nwe have shown in Ch. II)[2076] adorned palæstræ and gymnasia. That\r\nthe head is of marble and slightly under life-size seems to lend\r\nsome support also to the belief that it is a fragment of a statue of\r\nHerakles, on the assumption that statues of victors in the Altis were\r\nuniformly of bronze, an assumption, however, not supported by the\r\nfacts, as will be shown in Chapter VII. So some have seen the heroic\r\nfeatures of the youthful hero in the γοργόν of the eyes, the energetic\r\nforehead, closely cropped hair, muscular neck, and almost challenging\r\ninclination of the head seemingly corresponding with an energetic\r\nraising of the left shoulder.[2077] In Chapter III we saw that swollen\r\nears were of little use in determining whether a given head belongs\r\nto the statue of a victor or to one of Herakles, since they formed no\r\npersonal characteristic, but only a professional one common to athletes\r\nand to gods, if these latter were concerned with athletics.[2078] Where\r\npersonal attributes are absent, it is often difficult, therefore, to\r\ndetermine whether an ideal athlete or Herakles is intended, for it may\r\nbe the hero in the guise of the athlete, or an athlete in the guise of\r\nthe hero. The head under discussion, then, may furnish merely another\r\nillustration of the process of assimilation of type which we have\r\nalready discussed. Thus it is not surprising that some have regarded\r\nthis head as that of a youthful Herakles. Yet such a view is wrong;\r\nfor, apart from all considerations which we shall adduce to identify it\r\nwith the Akarnanian pancratiast, and in the absence of distinguishing\r\nattributes, if we compare it with another Lysippan head from a statue\r\ngenerally recognized as that of a Herakles—the famous Pentelic marble\r\none in Lansdowne House, London (Pl. 30 and Fig. 71),[2079] which\r\nMichaelis long ago characterized as “unmistakably in the spirit of\r\nLysippos”—we can see how fundamentally different is the whole spiritual\r\nconception of the two, and how differently an athlete (even if highly\r\nidealized) and a hero are treated by the same sculptor. If we once\r\nrecognize a victor in the head from Olympia, then the swollen ears, the\r\nfierce, barbarous look of the eyes, and the half-painful expression of\r\nthe mouth, all concur in convincing us that we here have to do with a\r\nvictor in boxing or the pankration, the two most brutal and dangerous\r\ncontests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—Head of the Statue of Herakles (Pl. 30).\r\nLansdowne House, London.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTIFICATION OF THE OLYMPIA HEAD.\r\n\r\nHaving established, then, the Lysippan character of the head and the\r\nprobability that it comes from the statue of a boxer or pancratiast,\r\nwe shall next discuss the evidence for identifying it with one of the\r\nmonuments mentioned by Pausanias in his _periegesis_ of the Altis. He\r\nnames only five statues of victors by Lysippos: those of Troilos,[2080]\r\nvictor in the two- and four-horse chariot-races; of Philandridas[2081]\r\nand of Polydamas,[2082] victors in the pankration; of Cheilon,[2083]\r\nvictor in wrestling, and of Kallikrates,[2084] victor in the\r\nhoplite-race. Of these, the only two which can come into consideration\r\nare those of the two pancratiasts; and one of these, that of Polydamas,\r\ncan at once be eliminated; for this small head can have had nothing\r\nto do with the pretentious monument mentioned by Pausanias in these\r\nwords: ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ βάθρῳ τῷ ὑψηλῷ Λυσίππου μέν ἐστιν ἔργον, μέγιστος\r\nδὲ ἁπάντων ἐγένετο ἀνθρώπων, κ. τ. λ. Fragments of the base of this\r\nmonument have been recovered, and it stood in a part of the Altis[2085]\r\ntoo far removed from the spot where the statue of Philandridas stood,\r\nor from that where the marble head was found. Our choice is limited\r\nto the statue of the Akarnanian, the tenth in the series of 168\r\nvictors[2086] named by Pausanias in his first _ephodos_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 30\r\n\r\nStatue of Herakles. Lansdowne House, London.]\r\n\r\nWe can determine very closely the position of these first few statues\r\nin the Altis. Pausanias begins his enumeration ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ ναοῦ τῆς\r\nἭρας, in the northwest of the sacred enclosure.[2087] He is often\r\nloose in his employment of words to denote locations, and especially\r\nso in that of the terms ἐν δεξιᾷ and ἐν ἀριστερᾷ, which must sometimes be\r\ninterpreted from the viewpoint of the spectator, and sometimes from\r\nthat of a given monument. We shall show in Chapter VIII that these\r\nwords in this connection must be taken as referring to the temple\r\n_pro persona_, and consequently to the southern side of the Heraion.\r\nThe marble head was found in this neighborhood, in the wall of some\r\nlate Byzantine huts behind the southern end of the stadion-hall of\r\nthe Great Gymnasion, 23.50 meters north of its southeastern corner\r\nand 5 meters east of its back wall,[2088] and consequently very near\r\nthe Heraion. Inasmuch as the inscribed tablet from the base of the\r\nstatue of Troilos,[2089] the sixth statue mentioned by Pausanias, and\r\nthe inscribed base of the monument of Kyniska,[2090] the seventh,\r\nwere both found in the ruins of the Prytaneion nearby, and the basis\r\nof the statue of Sophios,[2091] the twenty-second in the series,\r\nwas discovered also in this part of the Altis, in the bed of the\r\nKladeos,[2092] we can conclude that all four monuments originally\r\nstood near together, and in the order named by Pausanias, along the\r\nsouthern side of the Heraion. The remarkably good preservation of the\r\nsurface of the marble head points to the fact that it was set up in a\r\nsheltered place.[2093] Furthermore, the unfinished condition of the\r\nback hair, which is only roughly blocked out, so that not even the\r\ncontour of the locks is indicated, shows that the statue was intended\r\nto be set up against a solid background, _i. e._, in front of a wall,\r\nniche, or column.[2094] From this fact we may conclude that the statue\r\nof Philandridas, and perhaps those of some of the other victors first\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, stood on the southern stylobate of the Heraion,\r\nover against the columns of the peristyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DATES OF PHILANDRIDAS AND LYSIPPOS.\r\n\r\nThe date of the victory of Philandridas is not recorded, but it\r\nprobably must lie within the years of the activity of Lysippos, who\r\nmade the statue.[2095] On the principle which has been sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated in my monograph _de olympionicarum Statuis_, that statues\r\nof nearly contemporaneous victors were grouped together in the Altis,\r\nas well as those of the same family and state, or those who had been\r\nvictorious in the same contest, I have already in that work[2096]\r\nproposed Ol. 102 or Ol. 103 (= 372 or 368 B. C.) as the probable date\r\nof his victory, as his statue stands among those of victors, none of\r\nwhom could have won later than Ol. 104 (= 364 B. C.). The first six\r\nnamed by Pausanias are Eleans and the dates of their victories fall\r\nbetween Ols. 94 and 104 (= 404 and 364 B. C.); the sixth, Troilos, is\r\nknown to have won his two victories in Ols. 102 and 103.[2097] None\r\nof the next seven Spartans—among whose statues that of Philandridas\r\nwas placed—can be dated later than Ol. 97 (= 392 B. C.), while most of\r\nthem belong to the close of the fifth century B. C. Sostratos of Sikyon\r\nwon in the same contest in which Philandridas did in Ol. 104 (= 364\r\nB. C.);[2098] and doubtless his two other known victories should be\r\nassigned to the two succeeding Olympiads. To bring Philandridas down\r\nas far as Ol. 107 (= 352 B. C.) is unwarranted, since no statue of so\r\nlate a date stood in this vicinity. On the other hand, to place his\r\nvictory earlier than Ol. 102, is also out of the question, owing to the\r\ninexpediency of dating Lysippos so early. Doubtless, therefore, his\r\nstatue by Lysippos was placed in the Spartan group about the same time\r\nthat the image of Troilos, by the same sculptor, was placed among the\r\nEleans. This is an independent argument, then, for so early a date for\r\nLysippos.[2099]\r\n\r\nPercy Gardner, in the discussion of the date of this artist,[2100] has\r\nshown how slight is the evidence for any date later than 320 B. C.\r\nThe date of the second Olympic victory of Cheilon of Patrai, whose\r\nstatue was by Lysippos, can not be later than 320 B. C.[2101] Pausanias\r\nquotes the inscription on the base of the statue to the effect that\r\nCheilon died in battle and was buried for his valor’s sake by the\r\nAchæan people. He infers the date of his death by reference to the\r\ndate of Lysippos as either 338 B. C. (Chæroneia) or 322 B. C. (Lamia).\r\nIn another passage, VII, 6.5, he says that the Olympic guide told him\r\nthat Cheilon was the only Achæan who fought at Lamia. Gardner justly\r\nremarks that either of these dates, the two occasions in the lifetime\r\nof Lysippos when the Achæans took part in an important war, fall\r\nwithin the dates of the artist’s activity.[2102] The dates of the two\r\nhoplite victories of Kallikrates of Magnesia, on the Meander, whose\r\nstatue was also the work of Lysippos, must be left indeterminate.[2103]\r\nGardner also shows that the wish not to separate Lysippos from the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_ has been the real reason which has influenced so\r\nmany archæologists to extend his activity to the end of the fourth\r\ncentury,[2104] and to explain away the evidence for an earlier date\r\noffered by the statue of Troilos, who won his second victory in 368 B.\r\nC. If we once for all give up the _Apoxyomenos_, the difficulty of an\r\nearly dating disappears, as does also the theory that Skopas could have\r\nstrongly influenced the youthful Lysippos as a master would influence a\r\npupil, and it becomes clear that this influence must have been mutual,\r\nthat of one great contemporary upon another. Although Lysippos worked\r\nlonger, as is attested by his work for Alexander and his generals,\r\nhe could have been but little if any younger than either Skopas or\r\nPraxiteles, from both of whom he learned. We have already quoted\r\nHomolle[2105] as saying that an analysis of the style of the _Agias_\r\ndiscloses the mixed influences of Praxiteles and Skopas, as well as the\r\nindependent work of Lysippos, in the pose, proportions, and whole type\r\nof the figure.\r\n\r\nLysippos was a great reformer in art, breaking away from Argive and\r\nPolykleitan traditions, even though he called the _Doryphoros_ as\r\nwell as Nature his master, and though the influence of Polykleitos\r\nis visible in the body of the _Agias_, just as that of Skopas in the\r\ntreatment of its forehead, eyes, and mouth, and in the intensity of its\r\nexpression. Evidently he was strongly affected by the work of his great\r\npredecessors and contemporaries, but developed at the same time new\r\nand independent tendencies. Thus the _Philandridas_ must have been—just\r\nas the lost statue of Troilos—an early work of the master, whereas the\r\n_Agias_ was the work of his mature genius. The difference between the\r\ntwo can thus be explained by the lapse of time between them, and by the\r\ninfluences that surrounded the youthful artist; but the similarities\r\nbetween them are, at the same time, striking, and there is little\r\nresemblance in either to the _Apoxyomenos_. This is another link in the\r\nchain of evidence that the latter work could not have been produced by\r\nthe same artist; for artists do not radically change their style after\r\nmany years of work, and Lysippos must have been at least fifty years\r\nold when he created the _Agias_.\r\n\r\nThe identification of this marble head with that of the victor statue\r\nof the Akarnanian pancratiast by Lysippos raises two questions which we\r\nshall briefly examine: whether the statues in the Altis were ever made\r\nof marble, and whether Lysippos ever worked in that material. The first\r\nof these questions will be left for the following chapter; the second\r\nwill be discussed in the present connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYSIPPOS AS A WORKER IN MARBLE, AND STATUE “DOUBLES.”\r\n\r\nTo regard a marble statue as an original work of Lysippos, who has been\r\nlooked upon almost universally as a sculptor in bronze exclusively,\r\nseems at first sight to be baseless. Pliny certainly classed Lysippos\r\namong the bronze-workers, for in the preface to his account of\r\nbronze-founders[2106] he tells us that this artist produced 1,500\r\nstatues, and doubtless we are to infer that the historian regarded\r\nthem all as being made of metal. He further[2107] speaks of Lysippos’\r\ncontributions to the (_ars_) _statuaria_, and it seems clear that this\r\nterm, as the modern title of Book XXXIV, is to be taken in its narrow\r\nsense of sculpture in bronze as opposed to _sculptura_,[2108] that\r\nin marble. How firmly the belief is established that Lysippos worked\r\nonly in bronze can be seen from the following words of Overbeck: “_Zu\r\nbeginnen ist mit wiederholter Hervorhebung der durchaus unzweifelhaften\r\nund wichtigen Tatsache dass Lysippos ausschliesslich Erzgiesser\r\nwar._”[2109] That Lysippos was preëminently a bronze-worker, and\r\nthat his ancient reputation was due chiefly to his bronze work, can\r\nnot be doubted. But to say that he never essayed to produce works\r\nin marble, as so many other Greek artists did who were famed as\r\nbronze-workers,[2110] is, as one writer has lately expressed it, a\r\n_kindisches Vorurtheil_.[2111] That marble work was done in his studio,\r\nif not by his hand, is well attested by the reliefs from the base\r\nof the victor statue of Polydamas mentioned above, which have been\r\ngenerally referred to Lysippos’ pupils.[2112] These are too damaged\r\nto be used as exact evidence of his style, but the legs of Polydamas\r\nhimself, in the central relief, so far as their contour can be made\r\nout, are thin and sinewy, as we should expect in Lysippan work, and\r\nthis relief doubtless would have been regarded as the work of the\r\nmaster himself, if it had not been taken for granted that he worked\r\nonly in bronze. But for the same assumption some critics would have\r\nseen an original from the hand of Lysippos in the statue of Agias at\r\nleast, if not in the others of the Delphian group.[2113] It will be\r\ninteresting to rehearse some of the arguments by which the statue of\r\nAgias has been adjudged a copy.[2114]\r\n\r\nIt has been generally assumed that the original group of statues at\r\nPharsalos was of bronze (though we have no proof that it may not have\r\nbeen of marble), while the one at Delphi was copied almost, if not\r\nquite, simultaneously in marble[2115]—so faithfully, indeed, that even\r\nthe proper marble support to the figure of Agias was omitted. While\r\nHomolle notes the absence of this support as evidence of the marble\r\nstatue being an exact copy of the original bronze, Gardner argues that\r\nthis proves a free imitation, where the support was not needed.[2116]\r\nThe inexact modeling of the hair, since hair can not be rendered so\r\nperfectly in marble as in bronze, has been adduced as a sign that the\r\nmarble statue was a copy of the bronze original. This in itself is a\r\nweak argument, since the slight and sketchy treatment of the hair of\r\nthe _Hermes_ of Praxiteles—which is, for the most part, merely blocked\r\nout[2117]—might with just as good reason be used as evidence that that\r\nstatue is only a copy, especially as we know that Praxiteles also\r\nworked in bronze.[2118] The omission of the artist’s signature on the\r\nbase of the _Agias_ has also been taken to indicate that some pupil of\r\nLysippos (Lysistratos, for example) did the work of transference in the\r\nmaster’s studio under his supervision and doubtless from his model.\r\n\r\nDespite all such arguments, which prove little, it must be admitted\r\nthat the careless finish of the Delphian statue is not what we should\r\nexpect in a masterpiece by so renowned a sculptor as Lysippos, as\r\nthe statue can not be said to be a first-rate work of art. But that\r\nit was made under the direct supervision of Lysippos can hardly be\r\nquestioned. It seems reasonable to believe that Daochos, who employed\r\nthe great artist in the one case, would not have trusted a mere copyist\r\nin the other, or one who was free to indulge his individual taste\r\nin details,[2119] especially as the statue was to be placed in so\r\nprominent a place as Delphi. He probably gave the orders for the two\r\nstatues at the same time, and Lysippos must have had the oversight of\r\nthe Delphian one. So it seems best to regard the statue of Agias as a\r\n“double,” and not as a copy in the later sense of the word. The custom\r\nof making such doubles goes back at least to the middle of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C. Thus the statue of the _Delian Apollo_ by Angelion and\r\nTektaios, known as the “_Healer_” (Οὔλιος),[2120] had a “double” in\r\nboth Delphi[2121] and Athens.[2122] Similarly the _Philesian Apollo_ of\r\nBranchidai near Miletos, by the elder Kanachos,[2123] had a double in\r\nThebes known as the _Ismenian Apollo_, which Pausanias says differed\r\nfrom the one in Miletos neither in form nor size, but only in material,\r\nfor it was of cedar-wood,[2124] while the Milesian one was of bronze.\r\nFurtwaengler[2125] has demonstrated that contemporary doubles of works\r\nby Polykleitos, Pheidias, and Praxiteles existed. The case of the\r\nstatues of the athlete Agias at Pharsalos and at Delphi is paralleled\r\nby that of the Olympic victor Promachos, who had statues, probably\r\nalike, both at Olympia and in his native city Pellene.[2126] A double\r\nof the base of the _Nike_ of Paionios at Olympia was discovered at\r\nDelphi,[2127] and a fine head in the collection of Miss Hertz in Rome\r\nis from the same original.[2128] A Polykleitan head in the British\r\nMuseum, similar to that of the _Westmacott Athlete_ (Pl. 19), seems\r\nto be a contemporary replica of an original of the fifth century\r\nB. C.[2129] Such examples (and many more could be cited) show the\r\ndifference between contemporary “doubles” and the later copies of Greek\r\nmasterpieces. The former are Greek originals in a very true sense,\r\nmade, as we assume the _Agias_ was, under the direct supervision of\r\nnoted sculptors. In this sense only the Delphian statue should be\r\ncalled a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAD OF A STATUE OF A BOY FROM SPARTA, AND THE ART OF SKOPAS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—Marble Head of a Boy, found near the Akropolis,\r\nSparta. In Private Possession in Philadelphia, U. S. A.]\r\n\r\nWe shall next discuss the beautiful Pentelic marble head of a boy,\r\nwith a lion’s scalp drawn over the top so that the muzzle comes down\r\nover the forehead, which is said to have been discovered near the\r\nAkropolis at Sparta in 1908 (Fig. 72). This head was for a time in the\r\nUniversity Museum, Philadelphia, and later was exhibited at the Boston\r\nMuseum of Fine Arts. At last accounts it was in private possession in\r\nPhiladelphia. It has been published as the head of a youthful Herakles\r\nby my colleague, Professor W. N. Bates, in the _American Journal of\r\nArchæology_.[2130] Of its style he says: “The points of resemblance\r\nwhich the Philadelphia Heracles bears to the heads from the Tegean\r\npediments are so many and so striking that they must all be traced\r\nback to the same sculptor; and that he was Skopas there can be little\r\ndoubt.” He therefore concludes that it is “probably a very good copy\r\nof a lost work of Skopas.”[2131] A little later, Dr. L. D. Caskey, of\r\nthe Museum in Boston, found these resemblances hardly close enough,\r\nin view of the influence of Skopas on later Greek sculpture, to\r\njustify so definite an attribution.[2132] He found them confined to\r\nthe upper part of the face, while he believed that the lower portion\r\nresembled heads which could be assigned to Praxiteles or his influence,\r\nand consequently he pronounced the head “an eclectic work in which\r\nfeatures borrowed from Skopas and Praxiteles have been combined with an\r\nunusually successful effect.”\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Bates points out, there is no recorded statue of Herakles by\r\nSkopas which corresponds with this head. The stone one mentioned\r\nby Pausanias as standing in the Gymnasion at Sikyon[2133] has been\r\nthought by the authors of the _Numismatic Commentary on Pausanias_\r\nto be reproduced on a Sikyonian copper coin of the age of Geta, now\r\nin the British Museum.[2134] Many statues and busts scattered in\r\nEuropean museums, which represent a beardless Herakles and show Skopaic\r\ninfluence, have been traced back to this original.[2135] However, the\r\ncoin represents the hero wearing a wreath, and so, if it was copied\r\nfrom the original in the Gymnasion, the latter could not have been the\r\nprototype of the head under discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is now universally acknowledged that all constructive criticism\r\nof the art of Skopas must be based on a study of the heads found at\r\nTegea. Besides those discovered in 1879, and now in the National Museum\r\nin Athens,[2136] two other male heads (in addition to the torso of a\r\nfemale figure draped as an Amazon, and a head on the same scale which\r\nprobably belongs to it, as both are of Parian marble, representing\r\nprobably _Atalanta_ of the East pediment) were discovered by M. Mendel\r\nin his excavations of the temple of Athena Alea in 1900-1901, and\r\nreferred to the pedimental groups described by Pausanias.[2137] As one\r\nof these (Fig.73) is characterized by a lion’s scalp worn as a helmet,\r\nthe hero’s face fitting into the jaws, its teeth showing above his\r\nforehead, it has been regarded as the head from a statue of Herakles,\r\nalthough Pausanias mentions no such statue in his enumeration of the\r\nfigures composing the group of the Eastern pediment, and although it\r\nis difficult to explain the presence of the hero in the group of the\r\nWestern pediment, which represented the battle between his son Telephos\r\nand Achilles. Mendel considers this head to be inferior in workmanship\r\nto the others, and so refers it to the school of Skopas rather than\r\nto the master himself, and designates it “_un travail d’atelier_.”\r\nIn describing it, however, he says: “_tous ces caractères, qui sont\r\nceux des têtes du Musée central, se retrouvent dans nôtre tête\r\nd’Héraclés_.”[2138] Here we have a head of a youthful Herakles (or of\r\nsome hero who has borrowed his attribute of the lion’s skin—perhaps\r\nTelephos), which, if not by Skopas himself, is still a work of his\r\nschool reproducing all his characteristics; consequently, of all these\r\nheads from Tegea, it is with this one chiefly that we should compare\r\nthe head from Sparta similarly covered with a lion’s scalp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—So-called Head of Herakles, from Tegea, by\r\nSkopas. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\nThough badly injured, it is still possible to see in this head of\r\nthe so-called _Herakles_ found at Tegea, both in full view and in\r\nprofile, the characteristic Skopaic expression of passion, and to\r\ndiscover the means by which the artist effected it. The expression is\r\ndue in great measure to the upward direction of the gaze, and to the\r\nheavy overshadowing of the deep-set eyes. It is further enhanced by\r\nthe contracted brow, dilated nostril, and half-open, almost panting,\r\nmouth, whose parted lips clearly disclose the teeth. The structure\r\nof the head is in keeping with the strength of character portrayed;\r\nthe skull is very deep from front to back, and its framework is\r\nmassive and bony; the face is broad and short and the chin is heavy;\r\neverything emphasizes the impression of a virile and muscular warrior\r\nviolently engaged in the fray. The subjects of the two pedimental\r\ngroups—the Kalydonian boar hunt and the battle between Achilles and\r\nTelephos—justified the expression of unrestrained violence which\r\nwe see in this and the other male heads, and gave the sculptor an\r\nopportunity to represent his heroes in the excitement of action and\r\ndanger. To effect this intensity of expression Skopas relied mainly on\r\nthe treatment of the eye. In one of the heads (the unhelmeted one in\r\nAthens) the gaze is not turned upwards as in the _Herakles_, nor are\r\nthe neck-muscles strained as in the others, and yet the expression is\r\neven more violent than in them. Thus it is the modeling of the flesh\r\nabout the eye which is the real distinguishing feature of Skopas’ work.\r\nIn describing the helmeted head in Athens, E. A. Gardner says:\r\n\r\n  “The eyes are set very deep in their sockets, and heavily\r\n  overshadowed, at their inner corners, by the strong\r\n  projection of the brow, which does not, however, as in\r\n  some later examples of a similar intention on the part of\r\n  the artist, meet the line of the nose at an acute angle,\r\n  but arches away from it in a bold curve. At the outer\r\n  corners the eyes are also heavily overshadowed, here by\r\n  a projecting mass of flesh or muscle which overhangs\r\n  and actually hides in part the upper lid. The eyes are\r\n  very wide-open—with a dilation which comes from fixing\r\n  the eyes upon a distant object—and therefore suggest the\r\n  far-away look associated with a passionate nature.”[2139]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE TEGEA HEADS AND THE HEAD FROM SPARTA.\r\n\r\nIt is to the facial characteristics in the Tegea heads that Dr. Bates\r\ncalls attention in basing his argument for the Skopaic origin of\r\nthe head from Sparta: the forehead horizontally divided by a median\r\nline, the swelling, prominent brow, the deep-set eyes with their\r\nnarrow lids—only 2 mm. wide—embedded in the projecting flesh at the\r\nouter corners, and the parted mouth. He also sees a resemblance in\r\nthe small round curls bunched together above the ears. But if there\r\nare resemblances (especially in the modeling of the eyes) there are\r\nalso great differences observable in the Tegea heads and the one from\r\nSparta. Let us confine our comparison of the latter with the _Herakles_\r\nof the Tegea pediment, though the comparison with any of the other male\r\nheads would lead to substantially the same results.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the structure of the two heads in question is very\r\ndifferent. As the head from Sparta is broken in two at the ears and the\r\nwhole back part is missing, we can not tell whether it had the great\r\ndepth of the one from Tegea. But of the massive, bony framework of the\r\nlatter there is little trace in the former. In the Tegea example we are\r\nstruck with the squareness of the head and the breadth of the central\r\npart of the face; the sides do not gradually converge toward the\r\nmiddle, but seem to form distinct planes. The distance between the eyes\r\nis also in keeping with the breadth of the skull as measured between\r\nthe ears; the breadth of the face almost equals its length from the top\r\nof the forehead to the chin, and this fact, together with the massive,\r\nprominent chin, gives an element of squareness to the whole.[2140]\r\nOn the other hand, the head from Sparta has a long, narrow face whose\r\nsides softly converge toward the middle in beautiful curves about the\r\ncheeks; its cheek-bones are not so high nor so prominent as those\r\nof the other; it ends in a delicate, almost effeminate chin, which\r\nslightly retreats and gives the whole lower part of the face an oval\r\nstructure, thus recalling Praxiteles and fourth-century Attic works.\r\nThe length of the face is accentuated by the considerable height to\r\nwhich the head rises above the forehead, in contrast with the flatness\r\nof the skull in the example from Tegea. The eyes are not so wide-open;\r\nthey are longer and not so swollen nor compressed toward the centre; if\r\nwe view the two heads from the side, we see that the eye-socket in the\r\nTegea head is larger and appreciably deeper than in the one from Sparta.\r\n\r\nApart from these surface differences in the structure of the head\r\nand face, it is in the resultant expression that we see the greatest\r\ndivergence from the Skopaic type. This seems to me to be fundamentally\r\ndifferent in the Sparta head. In the _Herakles_, as in all the other\r\nTegea male heads, and even in those of the boar and the dogs, the\r\nreally characteristic feature, which differentiates them from all\r\nother works of Greek sculpture, is the passionate intensity of their\r\nexpression. The one unforgettable impression left on the spectator by\r\nthem all is this expression of violent and unrestrained passion, which\r\nthe sculptor has succeeded in imparting to the marble. This is what\r\nmarks him as the master of passion and the originator of the dramatic\r\ntendencies carried to such lengths in the Hellenistic schools of\r\nsculpture; it is this which explains Kallistratos’ characterization of\r\nhis works as being κάτοχα καὶ μεστὰ μανίας.[2141] The head from Sparta\r\nshows only a little of this intensity. Notwithstanding the similar\r\nupward gaze and slightly parted lips, the intention of the artist\r\nseems to have been to portray the hero in an attitude of expectancy,\r\ntempered by a look almost of calmness. The look is deeply earnest,\r\nbut not violent; it is even melancholy. It is this last feature, the\r\ndelicate and compelling melancholy of the face, which impressed me\r\nmost on first viewing it. This is further enhanced by the full, soft\r\nmodeling of the lower face, that gives to the whole a delicate, almost\r\neffeminate character, which strongly reminds us of Praxitelean heads.\r\nIn fact, the shape of the lips and the modeling of the flesh on either\r\nside of the mouth, together with the soft, dimpled chin, have little\r\nin common with the massive strength and remarkable animation of the\r\nTegea heads. As Dr. Caskey has intimated, if we had only the lower\r\nportion of the face for comparison, we should be inclined to ascribe it\r\nto the influence of Praxiteles. If we considered the upper part only,\r\nresemblances to Skopaic work seem well marked; but if we take into\r\naccount the expression of the face as a whole, we see that it lacks the\r\nmost essential of Skopaic features, the look of passionate intensity.\r\nConsequently we shall find it difficult to bring the head into such\r\nclose relation to that artist; for here there is little analogy to\r\nthe vigorous warrior types of the Tegea pediments. For its quieter\r\nmien it might be better to compare it with the head of Atalanta,[2142]\r\nthough none of the gentle pathos or eagerness of the Sparta head is\r\nthere visible. The _Atalanta_, though full of vigorous life, utterly\r\nlacks the unrestrained passion so characteristic of her brothers; her\r\neyes are not so deeply set, nor so wide-open; they are narrower and\r\nlonger, and are not over-hung at the outer corners by heavy masses of\r\nflesh.[2143] In speaking of the absence of these rolls of muscle, E.\r\nA. Gardner notes a curious peculiarity: “This is a clearly marked,\r\nthough delicately rounded, roll of flesh between the brow and the upper\r\neyelid, which is continued right round above the inner corner of the\r\neye, to join the swelling at the side of the nose, which itself passes\r\non into the cheek.”[2144] He detects this same peculiarity in certain\r\nother Skopaic heads, notably in the _Apollo_ from the Mausoleion and\r\nthe _Demeter_ from Knidos, though it is quite lacking in the Tegea male\r\nheads. It all goes to show that Skopas was not strictly consistent in\r\nhis treatment of the eye. The lower face of the _Atalanta_ is also\r\nlonger and more oval than that of the male heads, and thus shows Attic\r\nrather than Peloponnesian influence. If it is difficult, then, to\r\nconceive of the _Atalanta_ and the male heads as the work of the same\r\nsculptor, the contrast, both in structure and expression, between these\r\ntwo heads of Herakles, the one from Tegea, the other from Sparta, makes\r\nit more difficult to assume the same authorship for both; for here we\r\ncan not explain the difference as the contrast between the types of\r\nhero and heroine; here we are comparing two heads which are supposedly\r\nof the same hero.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STYLES OF SKOPAS AND LYSIPPOS COMPARED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—Attic Grave-Relief, found in the Bed of the\r\nIlissos, Athens. National Museum, Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—Statue of the so-called _Meleager_. Vatican\r\nMuseum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nIn view, then, of the differences enumerated I should hesitate to\r\nassign a Skopaic origin to the head from Sparta. In the lower part of\r\nthe face, with its small mouth and delicate chin, I see signs only of\r\nPraxitelean influence; in the upper part I am much more inclined to see\r\naffinities to the art-tendencies of Lysippos, as we now know them from\r\nthe statue of Agias. In the present state of our knowledge it is not\r\ndifficult to separate works of Praxitelean origin from those of Skopas;\r\nbut it is a very different thing to distinguish those of Skopaic origin\r\nfrom those of Lysippos; here the line distinguishing the two masters\r\nis much finer and harder to draw. Before the discovery of the Tegea\r\nheads, the deep-set eye,[2145] prominent brow, and “breathing” mouth\r\nwere looked upon as characteristic features of Lysippos, as they were\r\nknown to us from representations of Alexander, especially on coins.\r\nWe now know that these traits belonged to Skopas to a much greater\r\nextent. When the _Agias_ was found, and before its true authorship had\r\nbeen determined, Homolle, as we have seen, had at first classed it\r\nas showing the manner of Lysippos, only later to see more of Skopas\r\nthan Lysippos in it. Such a conclusion was natural so long as we\r\nregarded the _Apoxyomenos_ as the key to Lysippan art. By assigning\r\nthese traits definitely to Skopas, we were compelled to view the work\r\nof Lysippos as conventional and somewhat lifeless in comparison. But\r\nwith the assumption that the statue of Agias represented true Lysippan\r\ncharacteristics, we were forced to recognize that the same traits\r\nbelonged to Lysippos also, though to a less degree, since the energy\r\nof the Tegea heads was absent from the features of the _Agias_ and\r\ntheir fierceness was here replaced by a look of quiet melancholy. The\r\nstudy of such allied works as the beautiful and excellently preserved\r\n_Lansdowne Herakles_ (Pl. 30 and Fig. 71), the athlete on the Pentelic\r\nmarble stele found in the bed of the Ilissos in 1874, and now in the\r\nNational Museum in Athens (Fig. 74),[2146] the so-called _Meleager_\r\nin the Vatican (Fig. 75),[2147] and other copies of the same original\r\n(_e. g._, Figs. 76, 77), also shows how closely the type of Lysippos\r\napproached that of Skopas. Long ago I expressed the view[2148] that\r\nthese and similar works should be assigned to Lysippos rather than\r\nto Skopas, to whom most critics had referred them. Thus, after the\r\ndiscovery of the Tegea heads, scholarly opinion began to follow the\r\narguments of Furtwaengler in bringing the _Lansdowne Herakles_ into the\r\nsphere of Skopas.[2149] But Michaelis, as far back as 1882, commenting\r\non the characteristically small head, short neck in comparison with\r\nthe mighty shoulders, and long legs in proportion to the thick-set\r\ntorso, had declared: “Without doubt the statue offers one of the finest\r\nspecimens, if not absolutely the best, of a Herakles according to the\r\nconception of Lysippos.”[2150] Now opinion varies again; only those\r\nwho believe that the _Agias_ is Lysippan class the _Herakles_ as a\r\nLysippan work.[2151] Of the _Meleager_, Graef[2152] gives eighteen\r\ncopies besides the one in the Vatican. This number shows how common\r\nan adornment it was of Roman villas and parks. Some of these copies\r\nhave a chlamys thrown over the arm, _e. g._, the Vatican example, and\r\nbelong to imperial times, while others without the mantle, _e. g._, the\r\ntorso in Berlin,[2153] are older. In addition to the Vatican example\r\nwe reproduce two other copies, the beautiful Parian marble head now\r\nplaced on the trunk of a Praxitelean _Apollo_ in the gardens of the\r\nMedici in Rome (Fig. 76),[2154] and the statue without arms or legs\r\nand without the chlamys, found in 1895 near Santa Marinella, 30 miles\r\nfrom Rome, and since 1899 in the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University\r\n(Fig. 77),[2155] one of the most beautiful of the many replicas. At\r\nfirst the original of these copies was supposed to be Lysippan, being\r\nidentified with the _Venator_ at Thespiai mentioned by Pliny as the\r\nwork of Euthykrates, the son and pupil of Lysippos,[2156] but after the\r\ndiscovery of the Tegea heads it was almost universally referred to\r\nSkopas.[2157] Here again the Skopaic group of Graef has been broken by\r\nP. Gardner[2158] and others, and the _Meleager_, like the _Herakles_,\r\nhas been given to Lysippos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—Head of the so-called _Meleager_. Villa Medici,\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nLet us analyze a little further wherein the difference between the\r\nclosely allied art of Skopas and Lysippos lies. We saw that it\r\nwas chiefly the formation of the eye and its surroundings which\r\ncharacterized Skopaic work—the depth of the balls in their sockets,\r\nand the heavy masses of flesh above the outer corners. This was in\r\nharmony with the breadth of brow and the massive build of the Tegea\r\nheads. In the _Agias_ and similar works the treatment of the eye is\r\nsomewhat different. The head of the _Agias_ is of slighter proportions\r\nthan the heads from Tegea; in conformity with the Lysippan canon it\r\nis below life-size, and consequently has no such heavy overshadowing\r\nof the outer corners of the eyes. Moreover, as we shall see, this\r\novershadowing is also relatively less in the statue of the Delphian\r\nathlete. The formation of the eye is thus described by E. A. Gardner:\r\n\r\n  “The inner corners of the eye are set very deep in the\r\n  head and very close together; the inner corners of the\r\n  eye-sockets form acute angles, running up close to one\r\n  another and leaving between them only a narrow ridge for\r\n  the base of the nose; thus they offer a strong contrast\r\n  to the line of the brow, arching away in a broad curve\r\n  from the solid base of the nose and forming an obtuse\r\n  angle with it, such as we see in the Skopaic heads.”[2159]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—Torso of the so-called _Meleager_. Fogg Art\r\nMuseum, Cambridge, U. S. A.]\r\n\r\nThe resultant expression is therefore somewhat different from that of\r\nthe heads from Tegea; while we still see animation and even intensity\r\nin the face of the _Agias_, we see it in a modified degree. The\r\nfar-away look of the Tegea heads is still present, but it appears to\r\nbe fixed on a nearer object, and so the look of intensity is tempered;\r\nit is also lightened by the fact that the overshadowing of the eyes at\r\nthe outer corners is less heavy. But even this latter so-called Skopaic\r\ntrait, though it is absent in the _Agias_, is certainly present in\r\nother Lysippan heads. Besides being prominent in representations\r\nof Alexander the Great on coins,[2160] it is seen in busts of the\r\nconqueror, especially in the splendid one from Alexandria in the\r\nBritish Museum.[2161] In the latter example we see just such heavy\r\nrolls of flesh as we note in the Skopaic heads. It shows that this\r\ntrait, introduced by Skopas, was used at times with equal effect by\r\nLysippos. We have already noted how in one example, at least, Skopas\r\nhimself laid it aside—in the _Atalanta_. Its presence on Lysippan heads\r\nshows that too much stress can be laid on this feature in deciding\r\nwhether a given piece of sculpture is to be referred to Skopas. This\r\ntrait complicates the whole problem of the style of the two masters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARTA HEAD COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE PHILANDRIDAS.\r\n\r\nAs the _Agias_ is considered by most critics to be a contemporary copy\r\nof the original statue at Pharsalos, perhaps it will be more just\r\nto compare the head from Sparta under discussion with the original\r\nmarble head from Olympia, which we have ascribed in the earlier part\r\nof the present chapter to the statue of Philandridas by Lysippos. Such\r\na comparison will, of course, show certain differences, but marked\r\nresemblances as well. We shall see that these resemblances are confined\r\nto the upper part of the face. In both we note the same low forehead\r\nwith a corresponding depression or crease across the middle; the\r\nsimilarly bulging brow which breaks very perceptibly the continuous\r\nline from forehead to nose, concave above and below and convex at the\r\nswelling itself; the same powerfully framed and deep-set eyes thrown\r\ninto shadows by the projecting bony structure of the brows and the\r\noverhanging masses of flesh. The eyeballs in both are similarly long\r\nand narrow, though they are slightly arched in the _Philandridas_ just\r\nas in the Tegea heads, and not so close together as in the _Agias_,\r\nbut their inner angles are farther apart and not almost hidden by\r\nthe flat bridge of the nose when viewed straight from the front. In\r\nthis respect they are strikingly like those of the Sparta head.[2162]\r\nThe raised upper lids in both form symmetrically narrow and sharply\r\ndefined borders over the eyeballs. These borders, in each case, are\r\nnot partially hidden by the folds of skin at the outer corners, as\r\nthey are in the Tegea heads; and yet the masses of flesh projecting\r\nfrom the brows are almost as heavy as in the latter. In both the heads\r\nfrom Olympia and Sparta the upper lids slightly overlap the under at\r\nthe outer corners. The eye-sockets in both seem to be equally deep\r\nand the cheek-bones similarly high and prominent. We remark in the\r\n_Philandridas_ the gradual converging of the sides of the face toward\r\nthe middle, a trait which we have already observed in the head from\r\nSparta as in contrast with the more angular formation with lateral\r\nplanes so characteristic of the Tegea male heads. The flatness of the\r\nnose and the curves which it makes with the brow on either side are\r\nvery similar in the two heads under discussion. In both, the hair is\r\ntreated in the same simple and sketchy manner, being fashioned into\r\nlittle ringlets ruffled back from the temples in flat relief quite in\r\nthe Skopaic manner, even if the curls seem shorter and more tense.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to a consideration of the lower part of each face, we\r\nimmediately detect differences. While both faces end in an oval, this\r\nis broader, heavier, and more bony in that of the _Philandridas_, as we\r\nshould expect in the case of a more mature man. Consequently here the\r\nmouth is larger and firmer. The elegant contour of the lips observable\r\nin the _Agias_ is also found, to a less degree, in the head from\r\nSparta, whose lips are fuller and more sensuous, but can not be traced\r\nin the _Philandridas_ owing to the damaged condition of the mouth.\r\nIt is clear, however, that the lips of the latter were also slightly\r\nparted, just showing the teeth, but not as in the Tegea heads, as if\r\nthe breath were being forced through them with great effort.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the expression of these two faces that we see the\r\ngreatest resemblance. In the _Philandridas_, the powerful framing of\r\nthe eyes, the slightly upward gaze of the balls, and the contracted\r\nforehead combine to give it a pensive, even melancholy, look of\r\ndignity, a look seemingly of one who takes no joy or pleasure in\r\nvictory, though, as we have already mentioned,[2163] it is earnest\r\nrather than mournful. The almost identical treatment of the eye and its\r\nsurroundings gives the still more youthful head from Sparta a similar\r\nexpression. Homolle’s analysis of the expression of the face of the\r\n_Agias_ would apply with equal fitness to the mood portrayed in both\r\nthe heads we are discussing: “_L’expression qui résulte de ces divers\r\ntraits, c’est, dans une figure jeune et vigoureuse, un air pensif ou\r\nlassé, une certaine mélancolie, qui ne va pas à la tristesse morne ou\r\nà la méditation profonde, mais qui reste plus loin encore de la joie\r\ninsouciante de la vie et de la pure allégresse de la victoire_”.[2164]\r\nPreuner remarked that a verse of the epigram found on the base of the\r\nstatue of Agias, which runs καὶ σῶν οὐδείς πω στῆσε τροπαῖα χερῶν, is\r\nalmost an exact copy of the words of Herakles in the _Trachiniae_ of\r\nSophocles.[2165] In these words the dedicator of the statue ends the\r\nrecital of his ancestor’s exploits with a melancholy reflection on the\r\nvanity of his glory. They suggest with no less truth the expression of\r\nboth the heads we are discussing. This expression of pensiveness tinged\r\nwith melancholy is enhanced in both by the slightly parted lips. We can\r\nsee the same expression carried much further in many of the portraits\r\nof Alexander which go back to originals by Lysippos, and we know from\r\nPlutarch that this sculptor was chosen by the conqueror to make his\r\nportraits, because Lysippos alone could combine his manly air with\r\nthe liquid and melting glance of his eyes.[2166] But how different is\r\nthe delicately indicated pathos of these heads from the violent and\r\nunrestrained, even panting, expression of the Tegea sculptures! Here\r\nthere is no trace of the μανία which Kallistratos said characterized\r\nthe works of Skopas. If it be objected that the expression of the\r\n_Philandridas_ is more dramatic than that of the head from Sparta, its\r\nfierce, almost barbarous, look of defiance may well be explained by the\r\nfact that here is represented a victor from Akarnania, a country noted\r\namong the other Greek states for anything but culture and refinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARTA HEAD AN ECLECTIC WORK AND AN EXAMPLE OF ASSIMILATION.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, in consequence of these resemblances to Lysippan work,\r\nand because of the differences between it and the Tegean heads, that I\r\nam led to see more of Lysippos than of Skopas in this beautiful head\r\nfrom Sparta. An analysis of its style permits us to discover in it the\r\nmixed influences of Praxiteles, of Lysippos, and of Skopas. It seems\r\nto me necessary, therefore, in view of this mixture of tendencies, to\r\nregard it as an eclectic work, in which the unknown artist has combined\r\nLysippan and Praxitelean elements chiefly; and that he was also under\r\nthe influence of Skopas is evinced by the peculiarities mentioned in\r\nthe treatment of the eyes and hair;[2167] but even in the modeling of\r\nthe eyes, I believe that his chief debt was to Lysippos. The fineness\r\nof surface modeling, commented on by both Professor Bates and Dr.\r\nCaskey, recalls the delicacy of execution in detail which is mentioned\r\nby Pliny as characteristic of Lysippan art.[2168] It surely points to a\r\ndate for the work not much if at all later than the end of the century\r\nwhich was made glorious in the history of sculpture by the labors of\r\nthese three great masters.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding account I have tacitly assumed with Professor Bates\r\nthat the head from Sparta represents a beardless Herakles. But, as Dr.\r\nCaskey remarks, one might hesitate to accept this identification if\r\nit were not for the attribute of the lion’s skin above the forehead,\r\nfor here there is little indication of the strength so characteristic\r\nof later representations of the hero. Dr. Caskey, however, observes\r\nthat a head of Herakles, now in the British Museum, which some have\r\nregarded as an original by Praxiteles, is even more boyish than this\r\none. However, it is very doubtful if the Sparta head should be referred\r\nto a statue of Herakles at all. Pausanias mentions only three statues\r\nof Herakles in Sparta, to any one of which it seems futile to try to\r\nrefer the head under discussion; thus in III, 14.6, he speaks of an\r\nἄγαλμα ἀρχαῖον to which the _Sphairians_, _i. e._, lads entering on\r\nmanhood, sacrificed, as standing on the road to the Δρόμος, outside\r\nthe city walls; in the same book, 14.8, he says that an image of the\r\nhero stood at the end of one of the two bridges across the moat to\r\nPlane-tree Grove, _i. e._, the boys’ exercise-ground; and again in\r\nthis book, 15.3, he says that an ἄγαλμα ὡπλισμένον of Herakles stood\r\nin the Herakleion close to the city wall, whose attitude (σχῆμα), was\r\nsuggested by the battle between the hero and Hippokoön and his sons.\r\nThe same writer enumerates only three other statues of Herakles in\r\nLakonia. One of these was in the market-place of Gythion (III, 21.8),\r\nanother in front of the walls of Las beyond Gythion (III, 24.6), and\r\nthe third on Mount Parnon near the boundaries of Argolis, Lakonia, and\r\nTegea (III, 10.6). The head under discussion is more probably only one\r\nmore example of the idealizing tendency of athletic Greek art, which\r\nassimilated the type of victor to that of god.[2169] In the case of\r\nthe _Agias_ the sculptor plainly wished to raise the victor to the\r\nideal height of the hero. The same idealization is visible in the head\r\nascribed to the statue of Philandridas. In both these heads the ears,\r\nwhile small, are battered and swollen; the remains of the ears in the\r\nhead from Sparta are too badly damaged to indicate whether these were\r\nswollen or not. But even if they were preserved and were in that\r\ncondition, they would not be a distinguishing factor in determining\r\nwhether the head belonged to the statue of a victor or of Herakles.\r\nIn our consideration of the Olympia head we saw by a comparison with\r\nthe _Lansdowne Herakles_, a statue universally recognized as that of\r\nthe hero, how fundamentally different were the two in their whole\r\nconception and how differently a highly idealized athlete and a hero\r\nwere treated by the same sculptor. The same might be said of the boyish\r\nhead from Sparta, when compared with a genuine head of Herakles. For\r\nthis reason, and because of the resemblance in expression between the\r\n_Philandridas_ and the head from Sparta, I am inclined to believe that\r\nthe latter, instead of being a representation of a youthful Herakles,\r\nis really the idealized portrait of an athlete, probably that of a boy\r\nvictor, either in the boxing or wrestling match,[2170] assimilated in\r\nform to that of the hero.[2171]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE MATERIALS OF OLYMPIC VICTOR MONUMENTS, AND THE OLDEST DATED VICTOR\r\nSTATUE.[2172]\r\n\r\nFIGURES 78-80.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed pretty generally by archæologists that the victor\r\nstatues set up in the Altis at Olympia were uniformly of bronze.\r\nScherer, in his inaugural dissertation _de olympionicarum Statuis_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1885, was the first to discuss the question\r\nfully,[2173] and his arguments and conclusions have been followed,\r\nfor the most part, by later investigators. Thus Dittenberger and\r\nPurgold state unequivocally that these statues were “_ausnahmslos aus\r\nBronze_”,[2174] while more recently Hitzig and Bluemner, in their great\r\ncommentary on Pausanias, have again pronounced the dictum that “_die\r\nSiegerstatuen waren durchweg von Erz_”.[2175] Others, however, have not\r\nbeen quite so sweeping in their generalization. Thus Wolters believes\r\nthat these statues, because they were set up in the open, were “_der\r\nRegel nach_” of bronze,[2176] and Furtwaengler and Urlichs assume that\r\nthey were “_fast ausschliesslich aus Bronze_”.[2177]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE FOR BRONZE.\r\n\r\nThe arguments adduced by Scherer and others in defense of the\r\ncontention seem at first sight, although inferential in character,\r\nquite conclusive. In the first place, it has been pointed out that all\r\nthe statuaries mentioned by Pausanias in his victor _periegesis_,[2178]\r\nif recorded at all in Pliny’s _Historia Naturalis_, appear there in\r\nthe catalogue of bronze founders as workers in bronze κατ’ ἐξοχήν,\r\nwhile none of them is known exclusively as a sculptor in marble. As\r\nHagelaïdas is the first in point of time, who flourished from the\r\nthird quarter of the sixth century B. C. to the second quarter of\r\nthe fifth,[2179] Scherer believed that all statues from his date\r\ndown—_posteriorum temporum_—were of bronze; and as Rhoikos and\r\nTheodoros, the inventors of bronze founding, flourished about\r\nOls. 50 to 60 (= 580 to 540 B. C.),[2180] he believed that bronze\r\nmight have been used up to their date. In the next place, the excavated\r\nbases, which have been identified as those of victor monuments, show\r\nfootprints of bronze statues. Thirdly, actual bronze fragments,\r\nindubitably belonging to victor statues (of which two are attested by\r\ninscriptions), were found during the excavations of the Altis. These\r\nconsist of the following:\r\n\r\n(_a_) An inscribed convex piece of bronze of imperial times,\r\n“_anscheinend vom Schenkel einer Bronzestatue herruehrend_.”[2181]\r\n\r\n(_b_) A similar inscribed fragment of the same period.[2182]\r\n\r\n(_c_) The remarkable life-size portrait head of a boxer or pancratiast,\r\nwhich we have already discussed and reproduced (Fig. 61 A and B).[2183]\r\n\r\n(_d_) A foot of masterly workmanship (Fig. 62) ascribed by\r\nFurtwaengler[2184] to the end of the third century B. C. Its position\r\nshows that the statue of which it was a part was represented in motion,\r\nand consequently it has been assigned to a victor statue.\r\n\r\n(_e_) A beautifully modeled right arm, somewhat under life-size,\r\nsupposedly from the statue of a boy victor.[2185]\r\n\r\n(_f_) A right lower leg of excellent workmanship, assigned by\r\nFurtwaengler to the same period as fragment _e_.[2186]\r\n\r\nStill other bronze fragments of statues found at Olympia may have\r\nbelonged to statues of victors, especially to those of boys.[2187]\r\nThe small number of such fragments recovered—Scherer wrongly thought\r\nthere was none—is explained by assuming that all of these statues\r\nwere of bronze, and consequently were destroyed by the barbarians in\r\ntheir inroads into Greece during the early Middle Ages, when this\r\nmetal was much prized.[2188] Another argument for believing that\r\nthese statues were of bronze is the silence of Pausanias concerning\r\nthe materials employed in them; for, in his enumeration of 192 such\r\nmonuments, he mentions the material of only two statues, those of\r\nthe boxer Praxidamas of Aegina[2189] and of the Opuntian pancratiast\r\nRhexibios,[2190] and he mentions these because of their great\r\nantiquity, peculiar position in the Altis apart from the others\r\n(near the column of Oinomaos), and the fact that they were made of\r\nwood.[2191] Furthermore, in his book on _Achaia_ there occurs this\r\npassage in reference to the statue of the victor Promachos, which\r\nwas set up in the Gymnasion of Pellene: καὶ αὐτοῦ [Προμάχου] καὶ\r\nεἰκόνας ποιήσαντες οἱ Πελληνεῖς τὴν μὲν ἐς Ὀλυμπίαν ἀνέθεσαν, τὴν δὲ\r\nἐν τῷ γυμνασίῳ, λίθου ταύτην καὶ οὐ χαλκοῦ.[2192] Most critics have\r\ninferred from these last words, “_the one in the Gymnasion being of\r\nstone and not of bronze_,” that, although Pausanias says nothing\r\nabout the material of statues of victors in the Altis (barring the\r\ntwo just mentioned), by implication all these statues were of bronze;\r\nand they point out the fact that other writers furnish no evidence\r\nconcerning the material used in them—an argument _ex silentio_ to\r\nthe same effect. Besides these arguments many others have been urged\r\non purely a priori grounds; _e. g._, that, since these statues stood\r\nin the open air, subject to all kinds of weathering, they must have\r\nbeen made of bronze;[2193] that metal statues would have been cheaper\r\nand more easily prepared than those of marble;[2194] that the later\r\nPeloponnesian schools of athletic sculpture, which were characterized\r\nby their predilection for bronze-founding, would nowhere have been more\r\nprominently in evidence than at Olympia; etc.\r\n\r\nThus the case for the use of metal in these statues seems very well\r\nsubstantiated, and, for the reasons given, it can not be reasonably\r\ndoubted that the vast majority of these monuments were made of bronze.\r\nBut that they were not exclusively of metal, and that there were many\r\nexceptions to the general rule, not only can be conjectured on good\r\ngrounds, but can be proved by discoveries made at the excavations. We\r\nshall briefly consider, then, each of the foregoing arguments in turn,\r\nand see whether, in the light of the accumulated evidence, they are\r\nreally as well founded as they appear to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE FOR STONE.\r\n\r\nAs for the first point, that the statuaries mentioned by Pausanias\r\nappear only in Pliny’s catalogue of bronze founders, we must remember\r\nthat Pausanias himself says[2195] that he is making only a selection of\r\nthe victor monuments in the Altis, those of the more famous athletes.\r\nTherefore, the 192 monuments (of 187 victors)[2196] which he does\r\nmention must be only a fraction of the multitude of such monuments\r\nwhich once stood at Olympia. Pliny, to be sure, says that it was the\r\ncustom for all victors to set up statues in the Altis;[2197] but this\r\nrefers only to the privilege, of which many victors could not or did\r\nnot avail themselves on account of poverty, early death, or for other\r\nreasons.[2198] Still, the number of such dedications must have been\r\nvery great. Manifestly, therefore, we should not base an argument\r\non the number mentioned. There must, then, have been many other\r\nartists employed at Olympia, some of whom may well have been workers\r\nin marble. Besides, of the statuaries actually named by Pausanias,\r\nmany do not appear at all in Pliny’s work, and many of these may have\r\nbeen sculptors exclusively in stone. Of the names found in Pliny,\r\nsix at least—Kalamis, Kanachos, Eutychides, Myron, Polykles, and\r\nTimarchides—appear both in the list of bronze-workers and in that of\r\nmarble-sculptors.[2199] Similarly, in answer to the second argument\r\nthat the excavated bases show footprints of bronze statues, we must\r\nadmit that only a fraction of the bases which once supported statues in\r\nthe Altis have been recovered. Not one-fifth of the victors mentioned\r\nby Pausanias are known to us through these bases.[2200]\r\n\r\nThe fact that actual remains of bronze statues have been excavated at\r\nOlympia is matched by the fact that remnants of marble statues have\r\nalso been found; and it does not seem reasonable, in the light of the\r\nevidence adduced by Treu, Furtwaengler, and others, to reject these\r\nas fragments of actual victor statues. These fragments include the\r\nfollowing:[2201]\r\n\r\n(_a_, _b_) The two life-size archaic helmeted heads (Fig. 30) which we\r\nhave ascribed to hoplite victors.[2202]\r\n\r\n(_c_, _d_, _e_) Fragments of statues of boy victors: _c_ = trunk with\r\nleft upper leg, three-fifths life-size (Fig. 78);[2203] _d_ = breast,\r\none-half life-size;[2204]\r\n\r\n_e_ = upper part of legs of a statue, two-thirds life-size.[2205]\r\nBesides these Treu also adduces fragments of four different boy\r\nstatues, all of which are less than life-size.[2206]\r\n\r\nThe reticence of Pausanias as to the material used in these statues\r\nis merely in accord with his custom, for he very rarely mentions the\r\nmaterials of monuments, and apparently only where monuments of bronze\r\nand stone or other materials stand close together in a circumscribed\r\narea, as for instance, in enumerating the various monuments in the\r\nHeraion at Olympia.[2207] The only inference, therefore, to be drawn\r\nfrom Pausanias’ statement about the statue of Promachos mentioned is\r\nthat this particular statue of a victor at Olympia was of bronze. We\r\nare not justified in going any further. Besides this stone statue at\r\nPellene we have other actual notices of marble statues of Olympic\r\nvictors outside Olympia, as those of Arrhachion at Phigalia[2208] (Fig.\r\n79) and of Agias by Lysippos at Delphi (Pl. 28 and Fig. 68). If they\r\nexisted outside Olympia, there is no reason why they should not have\r\nexisted in the Altis also, _e. g._, the Lysippan marble head found\r\nthere, which we assigned in the preceding chapter to the Akarnanian\r\nvictor Philandridas (Frontispiece, and Fig. 69). Many of the older\r\nstatues, like that of Arrhachion, conformed with the “Apollo” type, as\r\nwe have shown in Ch. III,[5] and doubtless many such at Olympia were of\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—Small Marble Torso of a Boy Victor, from\r\nOlympia. Museum of Olympia.]\r\n\r\nReinach’s argument that stone statues in Greece, because of their\r\npatina of color, were intended to be placed under cover in the\r\nporticoes or cellas of temples and elsewhere, while bronze ones were\r\nmeant to stand in the open air, has been sufficiently combatted by H.\r\nLechat,[2209] who argues that the use of paint in Greek architecture\r\nand on temple sculptures proves the contrary. As the paint was burnt\r\nin, it was reasonably durable, and if it did not prove so it was\r\nreadily renewed. At Olympia, among several examples, we may cite\r\nthe marble _Nike_ of Paionios, which stood in the open in the space\r\nto the east of the temple of Zeus[2210] (see Plans A and B), while,\r\non the other hand, a bronze statue of Aphrodite stood within the\r\nHeraion.[2211] The argument that metal statues were cheaper than marble\r\nmust also be questioned.[2212] In the earlier part of the present work\r\nwe saw that, for economy’s sake, many victors set up small bronze\r\nstatuettes instead of statues at Olympia, numbers of which have been\r\nrecovered. That such dedications were common elsewhere is shown by the\r\ncountless athlete statuettes—especially diskoboloi—which are to be\r\nfound in all European museums.[2213] For similar reasons victors would\r\nchoose in place of bronze the less durable and cheaper stone, as in\r\nthe cases of Arrhachion and Promachos cited, or even wood, as in those\r\nof Rhexibios and Praxidamas. Still others, especially boy victors,\r\nwould set up small marble statues, two-fifths to two-thirds life-size,\r\nas the fragments of the seven examples collected by Treu and already\r\nenumerated above show.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the contention that the victor statues at Olympia\r\nwere exclusively of bronze, in the light of the evidence adduced, is\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUE OF ARRHACHION AT PHIGALIA.\r\n\r\nIn his description of Arkadia, Pausanias mentions seeing the stone\r\nstatue of the pancratiast Arrhachion in the market-place of Phigalia.\r\nHe describes it as archaic, especially in pose, the feet being close\r\ntogether and the arms hanging by the sides to the hips; and adds\r\nthat he was told that it once bore an inscription which had become\r\nillegible in his day.[2214] This Arrhachion won three victories at\r\nOlympia in the pankration in Ols. 52-54 (= 572-564 B. C.).[2215]\r\nTherefore his statue is one of the oldest victor monuments of which\r\nwe have record. At so early a date, before individual types of victor\r\nstatues had been developed, we should expect, in harmony with the\r\ndescription of Pausanias, that this statue would conform in style with\r\nthe well-known archaic “Apollo” type, the most characteristic of early\r\nGreek sculpture, which, as we saw in Chapter III, is exemplified in the\r\nlong series of statues found all over the Greek world, the oldest class\r\nbeing represented by the example from Thera (Fig. 9), and one of the\r\nyoungest by that from Tenea near Corinth (Pl. 8A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—Stone Statue of the Olympic Victor Arrhachion,\r\nfrom Phigalia. In the Guards’ House at Bassai (Phigalia).]\r\n\r\nIn his commentary on the passage of Pausanias, Sir J. G. Frazer records\r\nthat during a visit in May, 1890, he saw a recently discovered archaic\r\nstone statue in a field just outside Pavlitsa, a village on the site of\r\nthe southeastern precincts of the old city of Phigalia, some 2.5 miles\r\nfrom the temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassai. He thought that this\r\nstatue agreed completely with Pausanias’ description of Arrhachion’s,\r\neven to the half-effaced inscription which he transcribed from its\r\nbreast just below the neck.[2216] Through the courtesy of Dr. Svoronos,\r\nof the National Numismatic Museum in Athens, I have been able to\r\nprocure a photograph of the monument from K. Kouroniotis, the Arkadian\r\n_Ephor_ of antiquities stationed at Bassai, and I present it herewith\r\n(Fig. 79). The statue is now cared for in the house of the temple\r\nguards. This statue, like all other examples of the series, represents\r\na nude youth standing in a stiff, constrained attitude. It is badly\r\nmutilated and its surface is rough from weathering. Besides having lost\r\nits head, arms, and the lower part of the legs, it has been broken into\r\ntwo parts across the abdomen. The ends of curls on either side of the\r\nneck, extending a few inches over the breast, show that the head looked\r\nstraight forward, thus following the usual law of “frontality,”[2217]\r\nwhich precluded any turning of the body; for a median line drawn\r\ndown through the middle of the breastbone, the navel, and the αἰδοῖα\r\nwould divide the statue into two equal halves. The body shows the\r\nquadrangular form of the earlier examples, the sculptor having worked\r\nin flat planes at right angles to one another, with the corners merely\r\nrounded off. The remains of arms broken off just below the shoulders\r\nshow that they must have hung close to the sides. The shoulders are\r\nbroad and square, and display none of the sloping lines characteristic\r\nof other examples, as, _e. g._, the one from Tenea. From the breast\r\ndown the body is slender, the hips being very narrow. The legs show the\r\nusual flatness and the left one is slightly advanced, as is uniformly\r\nthe case in every one of the series. They are somewhat more separated\r\nthan in many other examples. The αἰδοῖα form a rude pyramidal mass, not\r\nbeing differentiated as they are, _e. g._, in the statues from Naxos\r\nand Orchomenos[2218] (Fig. 10). Some attempt at modeling is visible\r\nin the muscles of the breast and lower abdomen. In general, it may be\r\nsaid that the similarity in attitude of this statue to Egyptian works\r\nimpresses us, as it does in all the examples of early Greek sculpture.\r\nAs the subject of Oriental, especially Egyptian, influence on early\r\nGreek art has given rise to very diverse views, we shall make a short\r\ndigression at this point to discuss this interesting question.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN INFLUENCE ON EARLY GREEK SCULPTURE.\r\n\r\nThis question has been under discussion in all its bearings ever since\r\nBrunn, in 1853, tried to demonstrate the originality of the Daidalian\r\nξόανα,[2219] but, strangely enough, archæologists are not yet agreed\r\nas to its proper settlement. While some emphasize the spontaneous\r\norigin of Greek art, others quite as strongly advocate that the\r\nearly Greek sculptor, at least, copied Egyptian models.[2220] Thus\r\nFurtwaengler, who early assumed a Cretan origin for the “Apollo” type\r\nof statues,[2221] later became convinced that it developed in Ionia\r\nthrough Greek contact with the colony of Naukratis in Egypt, which\r\nwas founded in the middle of the seventh century B. C. He concluded\r\nthat this plastic type “_ist bekanntlich nichts als die Nachahmung\r\ndes Haupttypus aegyptischer statuarischer Kunst_”.[2222] Similarly\r\nCollignon traces the archaic male type to Egyptian influence, and\r\nassumes that this influence from the Nile valley was exerted on\r\nthe Greek artist before the latter half of the seventh century B.\r\nC.[2223] On the other hand, H. Lechat, in his review of the evolution\r\nof Greek sculpture from its beginning, believes that the early\r\nsculptor owed but little to Egypt or the East.[2224] Deonna entirely\r\nrejects the assumption of Egyptian influence, believing that all the\r\nso-called characteristics of early Greek statues can be explained\r\nas the result of natural evolution in Greece itself.[2225] Von Mach\r\nalso completely excludes all foreign influence when he says: “In her\r\nsculpture at least, Greece was independent of influence of any one\r\nof the countries that can at all come under consideration in this\r\nconnection, Phœnicia, Assyria, and Egypt.”[2226] But here, as in\r\nso many questions about Greek art, the truth must lie between the two\r\nextremes.[2227] The economic conditions of early Greece certainly\r\nprove that the Greeks were dependent on outside peoples in many ways,\r\nand there is no a priori reason for denying this dependence in art.\r\nWe clearly see Egyptian influence, for example, in the ceiling of\r\nthe treasury of Orchomenos,[2228] and that the Greeks learned many\r\nanimal decorative forms as well as a correct observation of nature\r\nfrom Assyrian art is clear, if we study the best examples of the\r\nlate period of that art, the reliefs from the palace of Assurbanipal\r\nat Nineveh (Konyonjik), now in the British Museum. Such decorative\r\ndesigns could be easily transmitted to the Greeks by the Phœnicians\r\non embroidered fabrics. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that\r\nearly Greek artists, especially in the Greek colonies to the east and\r\nsouth of Greece, were acquainted with earlier models and especially\r\nwith those of Egypt. The Greeks themselves of a later date recognized\r\nthis debt to Egypt. This is shown by many passages in Pausanias, which\r\nmention the similarity existing between early Greek and Egyptian\r\nsculptures,[2229] and by the curious tale told by Diodoros about the\r\nSamian artist family of Rhoikos, according to which the latter’s two\r\nsons made the two halves of the statue of the _Pythian Apollo_ for\r\nSamos separately, Telekles working in Samos and Theodoros in Ephesos.\r\nWhen joined together the two parts fitted exactly, just as if they had\r\nbeen made by one and the same artist. Diodoros adds that τοῦτο δὲ τὸ\r\nγένος τῆς ἐργασίας παρὰ μὲν τοῖς Ἕλλησι μηδαμῶς ἐπιτηδεύεσθαι, παρὰ δὲ\r\nτοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις μάλιστα συντελεῖσθαι.[2230] Such a story is valuable\r\nin that it shows that the later Greeks believed that they had adopted\r\nthe conventional Egyptian canon of proportions. If we compare any of\r\nthe “Apollo” statues with Egyptian standing figures of any period of\r\nEgyptian art, as Bulle has done, the resemblances in detail between the\r\ntwo types will be found to be very striking. Thus from the Old Kingdom\r\n(Memphitic), which included the first eight dynasties of Manetho,[2231]\r\nwe may cite the painted limestone statue of Ra-nefer and the wooden one\r\nof Tepemankh in the Museum of Cairo (Fig. 80), two men prominent in\r\nthe fifth dynasty;[2232] or the wood statue of Ka-aper, the so-called\r\n_Sheik-el-Beled_, which represents the apogee of Memphitic art, and\r\nthat of his “wife,” without legs or arms, the two statues being found\r\nsimilarly in a grave at Sakkarah (Memphis), and now being in the same\r\nmuseum.[2233] From the Middle Kingdom, including the eleventh to the\r\nseventeenth dynasties,[2234] we may mention the painted statue found at\r\nDahshur and now in Cairo, which represents Horfuabra, the co-regent of\r\nAmenemhat III, who was one of the kings of the twelfth dynasty.[2235]\r\nFrom the New Empire, including the eighteenth to the twentieth\r\ndynasties,[2236] we cite the draped wood statue of the priestess Tui, a\r\ngem of Egyptian art, which was found in a grave near Gurna, and is now\r\nin the Louvre;[2237] and lastly the draped alabaster statue of Queen\r\nAmenerdis (or Amenartas) in Cairo, the wife of the Aethiopian King\r\nPiankhi, who began to absorb Egypt by 721-722 B. C., just before the\r\ntwenty-fourth dynasty.[2238] After the early dynasties, the Egyptian\r\ntype of statue was reduced to a fixed and mechanical canon, which was\r\nused over and over again with lifeless monotony. In all these statues,\r\nwhose dates extend over a period of many centuries, we note the same\r\ntechnical characteristics which are observable in the Greek “Apollos,”\r\nwith the exception that the latter are always nude and lifelike. These\r\ncharacteristics may be summarized thus: long hair falling down over\r\nthe shoulders in a mass;[2239] shoulders broad in comparison with the\r\nhips; arms hanging down stiffly by the sides[2240] or crooked at the\r\nelbows;[2241] hands closed, with the thumbs facing forward and touching\r\nthe ends of the index fingers; the left leg slightly advanced and the\r\nsoles placed flat on the ground; high ears,[2242] and the upper body\r\nand head turned straight to the front.[2243] Only minor differences in\r\nthe two types appear. Thus the left foot is always further advanced\r\nin the Egyptian than in the Greek statues, so that the former appear\r\nto have less movement and life.[2244] Since there is no trace of this\r\ntype in Mycenæan art it seems impossible not to conclude that in some\r\nway, doubtless through Ionian sources, it was originally borrowed\r\nfrom Egypt. The imitation of the Egyptian models, however, was never\r\nslavishly done. The Greek artist immediately rendered the type his\r\nown by making it nude,[2245] and by transmuting the abstract lifeless\r\nschema of the Egyptians into a highly individualized one characterized\r\nby life and vigor.[2246] This Egyptian influence, it must be remarked,\r\nwas operative only in the initial stage of Greek sculpture; it was soon\r\nlost, as the Greek artist came to rely upon himself. F. A. Lange has\r\ntruly said: “_Die wahre Unabhaengigkeit der hellenischen Kultur ruht in\r\nihrer Vollendung, nicht in ihren Anfaengen_”.[2247]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—Statues of Ra-nefer and Tepemankh, from\r\nSakkarah. Museum of Cairo.]\r\n\r\nAfter this digression we will return to the statue of Arrhachion. Dr.\r\nFrazer was unable to decipher the inscription upon the breast with\r\ncertainty, but made out the following letters, the last four of which\r\nare plainly visible in the photograph: ΕΥΝΛΙΑΔ. He believed them to\r\nbe archaic and the first instance of an inscription on this class of\r\nstatues. He thought that the name was that of a man, which favored the\r\nview that the “Apollo” statues represented mortals rather than gods.\r\nThe letters form a combination manifestly not Greek, and so may have\r\nno significance; it is even possible that they were engraved in modern\r\ntimes.[2248] In any case we have the statement of Pausanias that the\r\ninscription was illegible in his day.\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt, then, that this mutilated and weather-worn\r\nstatue is the very one seen and described by Pausanias and referred\r\nby him to the victor Arrhachion.[2249] It is presented here for two\r\nreasons. In the first place, it is the oldest dated Olympic victor\r\nstatue in existence. Only three older ones are recorded, and none\r\nof these has survived to our time. These three are the statues of\r\nthe Spartan Eutelidas at Olympia, who won the boys’ wrestling and\r\npentathlon matches in Ol. 38 (= 628 B. C.);[2250] of the Athenian\r\nKylon on the Akropolis, who won the double running-race in Ol. 35 (=\r\n640 B. C.);[2251] of the Spartan Hetoimokles at Sparta, who won five\r\ntimes in wrestling at the beginning of the sixth century B. C.[2252]\r\nThe statue of Oibotas of Dyme, who won the stade-race in Ol. 6 (= 756\r\nB. C.), was not set up until Ol. 80 (= 460 B. C.);[2253] that of the\r\nSpartan Chionis, who won five running-races in Ols. 28-31 (= 668-656\r\nB. C.), was made later by Myron.[2254] Pausanias’ statement (VI.\r\n18.7) that the wooden statues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios, who won in\r\nOls. 59 and 61 respectively (= 544 and 536 B. C.), were the oldest at\r\nOlympia, is of course incorrect. In the second place, the statue of\r\nArrhachion actually proves what has often been assumed, that some of\r\nthe statues classed as “Apollos” are really victor monuments. As this\r\nquestion has provoked a good deal of discussion in recent years, I will\r\nbriefly review the arguments by which the opinion has gradually gained\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY VICTOR STATUES AND THE “APOLLO” TYPE.\r\n\r\nAs the earlier examples of the series were discovered under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, they gave no clue to their meaning. Thus the “Apollo”\r\nof Naxos was found in the quarries of the island, while that from\r\nOrchomenos (Fig. 10) was first seen in the convent of Skripou, its\r\nexact provenience being unknown. From the first they were denominated\r\n“Apollos,” chiefly because of their long hair[2255] and nudity,[2256]\r\nwhile the existence of many small bronzes in the same schema dedicated\r\nto the god,[2257] and cult statues of similar pose appearing on vase-\r\nand wall-paintings,[2258] helped to make the identification more\r\nprobable. Certain ancient texts, describing archaic statues of Apollo\r\nin this pose, were also cited as evidence, and it was pointed out that\r\nmany of these statues were actually found in or near sanctuaries of the\r\ngod. Thus Diodoros, in his description of the ξόανον of the _Pythian\r\nApollo_ made for the Samians by Telekles and Theodoros, which we have\r\nalready mentioned, says: τὰς μὲν χεῖρας ἔχον παρατεταμένας, τὰ δὲ σκέλη\r\nδιαβεβηκότα.[2259] Probably the gilded image by the Cretan Cheirisophos\r\nin the temple of Apollo at Tegea was of this type.[2260] The later\r\ntype of “Apollo,” with the arms extended at the elbows, was doubtless\r\nfollowed in the statue of Apollo made for the Delians by Tektaios and\r\nAngelion,[2261] and in the works ascribed to Dipoinos and Skyllis\r\nand their school. It would be easy to give an extended list of such\r\n“Apollo” statues found in sanctuaries.[2262] We might instance one from\r\nNaukratis, Egypt;[2263] one from Delos;[2264] two from Aktion;[2265]\r\nseveral from Mount Ptoion in Bœotia;[2266] a copy of the head of the\r\n_Choiseul-Gouffier_ Apollo (Pl. 7A) found in Kyrene.[2267] Still others\r\nhave been found in _temenoi_ of temples, _e. g._, two in that of Apollo\r\nat Naukratis,[2268] and one in that of Aphrodite there.[2269]\r\n\r\nHowever, against this exclusive interpretation doubts have been\r\nraised with ever-increasing precision, until now we can predicate\r\nwith certainty what Loeschke long ago assumed, that the more statues\r\nof the series there are found, the less probable will it become that\r\nthey should all be ascribed to Apollo.[2270] Conze and Michaelis\r\nfirst argued on the basis of Pausanias’ description of Arrhachion’s\r\nstatue that this type was employed for victor statues.[2271] Koerte’s\r\nobjection to their view on the ground of the long hair was refuted\r\nby Waldstein, who demonstrated that athletes were not represented\r\nwith short hair until after the Persian wars; he pointed out that the\r\narchaic grave-figures of the mortals Dermys and Kitylos discovered at\r\nTanagra, which were sculptured in a constrained attitude analogous\r\nto that of the “Apollos,” had long hair.[2272] We now know that the\r\nhair of some of the “Apollos” is short, which shows the irrelevancy of\r\nthis argument,[2273] and we also know that nudity characterizes many\r\narchaic statues of mortals. Nor do we learn much from dedications,\r\nfor we have examples of statues of gods dedicated to other gods and\r\neven to goddesses.[2274] _Ex votos_ were often more concerned with the\r\ndedicator than with the god to whom the statue was dedicated. Doubtless\r\nthe cult statues portrayed on vase-paintings are actually those of\r\nApollo, for at this epoch other gods, such as Hermes and Dionysos, are\r\nbearded.[2275]\r\n\r\nMoreover, that a more advanced _schema_ for representing the god Apollo\r\nhad already become fixed toward the end of the sixth century B. C., we\r\nknow from ancient descriptions of the statue of the god made for the\r\nDelians by Tektaios and Angelion, which represented him in the usual\r\narchaic attitude, _i. e._, of the statue of Arrhachion, but with the\r\nnotable difference that the forearms were outstretched.[2276] That\r\nthis was the recognized type in the early years of the fifth century\r\nB. C., is attested by the bronze statue of the god fashioned by the\r\nelder Kanachos of Sikyon for Branchidai, the pose of which is known\r\nfrom several statuettes and from a long series of Milesian coins.[2277]\r\nFor conservative reasons this favorite pose was kept for cult statues\r\neven into the fourth century B. C., as we learn from representations\r\non coins of the golden statue of the god set up in the inmost shrine\r\nof the temple at Delphi.[2278] But that many of the earlier examples\r\nof the “Apollo” series do represent the god, should not be denied. We\r\nagree with Homolle that the old appellation “Apollo,” after having\r\nreceived too much favor, has now by reaction become censured too\r\nseverely, and in general should still be applied to those statues\r\nof the series which have been discovered in or near sanctuaries of\r\nthe god, and in the absence of any other indication to the contrary,\r\nalso to those which stand upon bases inscribed with dedications to\r\nhim.[2279] Such a statue was found on the island of Thasos at the\r\nbottom of the cella of the temple of Apollo at Alki and is now in\r\nConstantinople.[2280] The colossal statue found on the island of Delos\r\njust south of the temple of Apollo,[2281] and the huge torso discovered\r\nin Megara[2282] may be referred to the god, for their size favors an\r\nascription to a deity rather than to mortals. And many other examples\r\nof the type found in sanctuaries may very well represent Apollo and\r\nother gods.[2283]\r\n\r\nThat several of the series were also funerary in character is\r\nabundantly proved by the fact that they were discovered in the\r\nneighborhood of tombs. Thus the _Apollo of Tenea_ (Pl. 8A) decorated\r\na tomb in the necropolis of Tenea near Corinth.[2284] Likewise the\r\nexample from Thera (Fig. 9) was found in a rock-cut niche.[2285]\r\nAnother, now in the British Museum, was found in the _dromos_ of a\r\ntomb on the island of Cyprus,[2286] while a fourth was unearthed from\r\nthe necropolis of Megara Hyblaia in Sicily.[2287] The one found at\r\nVolomandra in Attika in 1900 was also found in an old cemetery.[2288]\r\nThese furnish proof enough of the sepulchral character of many of these\r\nstatues. Such funerary monuments may, of course, have been been set up\r\nalso in memory of victors.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position, on the basis of Pausanias’ description of\r\nArrhachion’s statue and the actual monument itself, to maintain with\r\ncertainty what hitherto has been conjectured only, that although some\r\nof these archaic sculptures represent Apollo and other gods, sepulchral\r\ndedications, and _ex votos_ in general, others were intended to\r\nrepresent athletes also. Doubtless the other early victor monuments\r\nrecorded, such as the wooden statues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios, and\r\nthose of Eutelidas, Kylon, and Hetoimokles, already discussed in Ch.\r\nIII, conformed with the earlier type, while that of Milo, described\r\nby Philostratos,[2289] conformed with the later. Certain examples of\r\nthe series have already been ascribed to victors. Thus the marble\r\nhead of Attic workmanship found in or near Athens and known as the\r\nRayet-Jacobsen head (Fig. 22), has been referred to a pancratiast\r\nbecause of its swollen and deformed ears.[2290] Certain statuettes\r\nof the same pose as the “Apollos” have been looked upon as copies of\r\nathlete statues.[2291] So the early doubts[2292] as to the meaning of\r\nthese archaic sculptures have been resolved in many cases. We have\r\nadded one well-attested example to show that they sometimes represented\r\nvictor monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPOSITIONS OF VICTOR STATUES IN THE ALTIS; OLYMPIC VICTOR MONUMENTS\r\nERECTED OUTSIDE OLYMPIA; STATISTICS OF OLYMPIC VICTOR STATUARIES.[2293]\r\n\r\nPLANS A AND B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part of this final chapter is a special study in the\r\ntopography of the Altis at Olympia. It is an attempt to fix, more or\r\nless exactly, the positions of victor statues erected there, so far as\r\nthese can be determined from the data furnished by Pausanias, and from\r\nthe locations of the inscribed fragmentary bases of the statues which\r\nhave been recovered during the excavations at Olympia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUES MENTIONED BY PAUSANIAS.\r\n\r\nWe shall first attempt to give the positions of the statues mentioned\r\nby Pausanias, who is our chief source of information. After describing\r\nthe votive offerings (ἀναθήματα) at the end of Book V, he begins\r\nthe enumeration of the monuments of “race-horses ... and athletes\r\nand private individuals” at the beginning of Book VI.[2294] This\r\ndescription falls into two routes (ἔφοδοι), the first of which is\r\nconcerned with the statues of 168 victors,[2295] and the second with\r\nthose of 19.[2296] Both accounts also include many “honor” monuments\r\nerected to private persons. The first route begins at the Heraion\r\nin the northwestern part of the sacred enclosure, while the second\r\nbegins—manifestly where the first ends—at the Leonidaion at its\r\nsouthwestern corner, and extends to a point near the so-called Great\r\nAltar of Zeus near the centre of the Altis (see Plans A and B).[2297]\r\nBesides these meagre indications of his two routes furnished by\r\nPausanias himself, we are fortunate in knowing exactly the position of\r\none statue, that of Telemachos, the 122d victor mentioned, the base of\r\nwhich still stands _in situ_ near the South wall of the Altis, a little\r\nsoutheast of the temple of Zeus, showing that the route passed before\r\nthe eastern front of this temple and thence westward to the Leonidaion.\r\nWith these data and with the help of some forty inscribed bases of\r\nstatues and other monuments mentioned by Pausanias, many of which were\r\nfound in or near their original positions, it is possible to trace yet\r\nmore definitely his routes. Several attempts have been made, since the\r\nGerman excavations, to define topographically the positions of these\r\nstatues, especially by Hirschfeld,[2298] Scherer,[2299] Flasch,[2300]\r\nDoerpfeld,[2301] and the present writer.[2302]\r\n\r\nThe position of several inscribed base-fragments of statues,\r\ncorresponding with Pausanias’ order of presentation, should alone\r\nbe sufficient to confute the doubts raised by some scholars that\r\nthese routes through the Altis were not topographical.[2303] But in\r\nany attempt to reconstruct them we must constantly be on our guard\r\nagainst assuming that Pausanias describes a continuous line or row\r\nof monuments, as both Hirschfeld and Scherer have done. Though here\r\nand there this may have been true, still, generally speaking, we\r\nmust conceive of these statues as being strewn about the Altis in no\r\nother order than that they stood in groups, and that these groups had\r\nonly a general direction; for we shall see that Pausanias sometimes\r\nreturns to the same spot without mentioning it and often leaves long\r\nspaces unnoticed. Apart from the indication of such groups in the\r\ndescription itself, as attested by the use of such words as παρά,\r\nἐφεξῆς, μετά, πλησίον, ἀνάκειται ἐπί, ἐγγύτατα, ὄπισθεν, μεταξύ, οὐ\r\nπόρρω, οὐ πρόσω, κ. τ .λ., I have already shown in my previous work that\r\nit is possible to reconstruct many other groups, for abundant proof\r\nis there given that statues of nearly contemporaneous victors were\r\noften grouped together, as were those of the same family or state, or\r\nthose victorious in the same contest, or those whose statues were made\r\nby the same artist.[2304] So, in general, we can group only certain\r\nstatues in belts or “zones” around some building or monument which\r\nis still _in situ_. Further than this we can seldom go. W. Gurlitt\r\nhas thus well expressed the difficulty of following these routes\r\nof Pausanias: “_Jede folgende Statue ist nach der vorhergehenden\r\norientirt zu denken ... Beziehungen auf frueher oder spaeter erwaehnte\r\nMonumente waren ueberfluessig ... wir sind ... auf wenige Fixpunkte\r\nangewiesen und verfallen daher leicht in den Fehler, die Wegrichtungen\r\nin den Plan zu schematisch einzuzeichnen.... Das Hin und Her auf\r\nden viel verschlungenen Wegen der Altis koennen wir nicht mehr\r\ncontrollieren_”.[2305] In his description of the scattered altars (V,\r\n14.4-15.12), Pausanias had not the same problem to meet as in that of\r\nthe victor statues. As there was so little continuity in describing\r\nthe altars, which were strewn all over the Altis, he had to introduce\r\nmany other monuments to make their locations known; but in the case\r\nof the victor statues there was great continuity, and consequently\r\nsuch indications would have been superfluous.[2306] And, in general,\r\nowing to the number and variety of monuments crowded together in the\r\ncircumscribed area of the Altis, he was not compelled to describe\r\nOlympia with such definite detail as Athens. That these victor statues,\r\nhowever, are described in topographical order is not only attested\r\nby the internal evidence of Pausanias’ words,[2307] but also by the\r\nfinding of many of their bases in the order of his presentation. With\r\nthis introductory warning, let us take up the routes of Pausanias in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EPHODOS OF PAUSANIAS.\r\n\r\nPausanias begins his enumeration in the northeastern part of the Altis:\r\nἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ ναοῦ τῆς Ἥρας[2308]—words which have been the subject of\r\nmuch discussion as to whether they are to be understood of the temple\r\n_pro persona_, _i. e._, the southern side,[2309] or of the viewpoint of\r\none facing it, _i. e.,_ the space (especially the northern or right hand\r\nhalf) before the eastern front.[2310] From the immediate whereabouts of\r\nPausanias we get no clue; for at the end of Book V (27.11) he says that\r\nhe is in the middle of the Altis, and yet in the following paragraph\r\n(27.12)—evidently added as a transition from the account of the altars\r\nto that of the victors—he mentions the trophy of the people of Mende,\r\nin Thrace, which he says he nearly mistook for the statue of the\r\npancratiast Anauchidas (131), and this, as we shall see, stood near the\r\nSouth wall of the Altis far from the centre. Doerpfeld’s contention,\r\ntherefore, that Pausanias approached the Heraion from this point, and\r\nthat consequently the words ἐν δεξιᾷ must refer to its eastern front,\r\nis untenable, and we are left dependent on the meaning of these words\r\nas gathered from other passages in Pausanias’ work. An examination of\r\nseveral such passages seems to be convincing that they are used here\r\nof the Heraion _pro persona_.[2311] Furthermore, the finding of the\r\ninscribed tablet from the base of the statue of Troilos (6) and the\r\npedestal of that of Kyniska (7) in the ruins of the Prytaneion, _i.\r\ne._, not far from the western end of the Heraion, and the base of that\r\nof Sophios (22) in the bed of the Kladeos still further west,[2312]\r\nmakes it reasonable to conclude that the first statues mentioned (VI,\r\n1.3-3.7), those of the Spartan group (Kyniska-Lichas, 7-14), all of the\r\nfifth century, B. C., flanked on either side by statues of the fourth,\r\nmostly of Eleans (Symmachos-Troilos, 1-6, and Timosthenes-Eupolemos,\r\n15-28), originally stood in the order named by Pausanias along the\r\nsouthern front of the temple.[2313]\r\n\r\nLeaving the Heraion, we get no further fixed point until we arrive\r\nopposite the eastern front of the temple of Zeus. For here around the\r\nfoundation of the statue of the _Eretrian Bull_—still _in situ_ 32\r\nmeters east of the northeastern corner of the temple (see Plans A and\r\nB)[2314]—have been found fragments of the pedestals of the statues of\r\nNarykidas (49) and Hellanikos (65) to the south, of Kallias (50) and\r\nEukles (52), beneath that of Kallias, to the north, of Euthymos (56)\r\nand Charmides (58) close together to the east.[2315] So it is clear\r\nthat the series of statues from Narykidas to Charmides (49-58, P., VI,\r\n6. 1-7.1) stood in this neighborhood. Now the statues of the family of\r\nDiagoras, the Rhodian athlete, stood together (59-63), as Pausanias\r\nsays (VI, 7.1-2); one of them, that of Eukles (52), seems to have been\r\nmoved from its original position later, as we learn from a scholiast on\r\nPindar’s seventh Olympian ode,[2316] who, on the authority of the lost\r\nworks of Aristotle and Apollas on the Olympic victors,[2317] enumerates\r\nthese statues in an order different from that adopted by Pausanias,\r\nshowing that a change in their positions must have taken place some\r\ntime between the date of Aristotle and that of the Periegete.[2318]\r\nThe statues of Alkainetos and his son Hellanikos (64-65) must also\r\nhave stood together. Inasmuch as the victors from Euthymos to Lykinos\r\n(56-68) are, with one exception, all pugilists or pancratiasts and of\r\nthe fifth century B. C., they must have been grouped together, with the\r\nfamily groups of Diagoras and Alkainetos in the centre.[2319] We may\r\nalso add the statues of Dromeus and Pythokles[2320] (69-70) of nearly\r\nthe same date, and we can also extend the group in the other direction;\r\nfor the same scholiast says that the statue of Diagoras stood near that\r\nof the Spartan Lysandros (35 a).[2321] Pausanias (VI, 3.14 and 4.1)\r\nsays that the statue of Lysandros stood between those of Pyrilampes and\r\nAthenaios (35-36). Thus we can conclude that the 36 statues (35-70,\r\nVI, 3.13-7.10) stood in the zone of the _Eretrian Bull_, extending\r\nperhaps across the Altis to the vicinity of the Echo Colonnade along\r\nits eastern boundary.\r\n\r\nIt would follow, then, that the intervening statues from Oibotas to\r\nXenophon (29-34, P., VI, 3.8-3.13) stood somewhere between the Heraion\r\nand the _Eretrian Bull_. It is idle to discuss the route between these\r\ntwo monuments more definitely.[2322]\r\n\r\nOur next fixed point is the _Victory_ of Paionios, whose foundation\r\nis still standing in its original position, 37 meters due east of\r\nthe southeast corner of the temple of Zeus.[2323] For, of the next\r\nfew statues mentioned, the base of that of Sosikrates (71) was found\r\n“somewhere” east of the temple, that of Kritodamos (80) before\r\nthe “Southeast Building,” and that of Xenokles (85), 4 meters to\r\nthe northeast of the _Victory_ base, presumably near its original\r\nposition.[2324] Pausanias groups the three Arkadian athletes,\r\nEuthymenes-Kritodamos (78-80, P., VI, 8.5); then, after naming four\r\nstatues of victors from other states, he mentions two more Arkadians\r\ntogether, Xenokles and Alketos (85-86, VI, 9.2); and he continues by\r\nsaying that the statues of the Argives Aristeus and Cheimon (87-88, VI,\r\n9.3) stood together. One more statue, that of Phillen or Philys[2325]\r\nof Elis (89), is named before he comes to the chariot of Gelo. Thus we\r\nmay conclude that the series of statues denoted by the numbers 71-89\r\n(P., VI, 8.1-9.4) stood to the south of the _Eretrian Bull_ in the\r\nparallel zone of the _Victory_.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the series of statues mentioned between the chariots\r\nof Gelo and Kleosthenes (90-99). The position of the bases of these\r\nchariots is practically certain. In describing the statues of Zeus in\r\nBook V, Pausanias says he is proceeding north from the Council-house\r\n(23.1), and first mentions a statue of Zeus set up by the Greeks who\r\nfought at Platæa; in describing the victor statues he says that the\r\nchariot of Kleosthenes stands behind this statue of Zeus (P., VI,\r\n10.6). After describing the _Zeus_ of Platæa, he mentions a bronze\r\ninscribed tablet as standing in front of it (V, 23.4), which recorded\r\nthe thirty years’ treaty of peace between Sparta and Athens, and\r\nthen says that the statue of the _Zeus_ of the Megarians stands near\r\nthe chariot of Kleosthenes (23.5). As he is proceeding north, this\r\nMegarian _Zeus_ must have stood north of the Platæan one; thus in one\r\ngroup we have the two statues of Zeus and the chariot of Kleosthenes.\r\nImmediately to the north he next mentions the chariot of the Syracusan\r\ntyrant Gelo (90), which he says is near the statue of the _Zeus_ of\r\nthe Hyblæans (23.6). Now in coming south, in the athlete _periegesis_,\r\nhe names eight statues between these chariots. Doerpfeld[2326] has\r\nidentified the base of the Platæan _Zeus_ with a large pedestal to the\r\nnorthwest of that of the victor Telemachos (122) found _in situ_ near\r\nthe South Altis wall,[2327] a position which is in harmony with the\r\ndescription of the statues of Zeus; just behind it he has identified\r\ntwo large foundations near together as those of the two chariots. So\r\nthe eight intervening statues stood here. Of the statues between the\r\nchariot of Kleosthenes and the base of the statue of Telemachos, the\r\nbase of that of Tellon (102) was found in the East Byzantine wall near\r\nthe South Altis wall; that of Aristion (115) nearby, embedded in the\r\nsame wall; that of Akestorides (119), whose name I have inserted in the\r\nlacuna in the text of Pausanias (VI, 13.7),[2328] just northeast of the\r\nbase of Telemachos.[2329] Thus the series of statues from that of Gelo\r\nto that of Agathinos (90-121a, P., VI, 9.4-13.11) can be grouped in the\r\nzone of the _Chariots_.\r\n\r\nAs the fragment of the base of the statue of the Athenian pancratiast\r\nAristophon (123) was found near the base of Telemachos, but to the\r\neast of it, and likewise that which supported the equestrian monument\r\nof Xenombrotos and Xenodikos (133-134) still further to the east near\r\nthe Echo Colonnade,[2330] we can conclude that the twenty-one statues\r\nfrom Aristophon to Prokles (123-138, P., VI, 13.11-14.13), mostly\r\nof the fifth century B. C., stood near the South Altis wall to the\r\neast (and not to the west of the base of Telemachos, where all other\r\ninvestigators have wrongly placed them),[2331] and thus form a group\r\nwhich we can call the zone of _Telemachos_. So we conclude that the\r\nlong list of statues from Pyrilampes to Prokles (35-138), nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of all those mentioned in the first ἔφοδος of Pausanias,\r\nstood in the space to the east and southeast of the temple of Zeus,\r\ngrouped in the parallel zones of the _Bull_, _Victory_, _Chariots_, and\r\n_Telemachos_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the statues beginning with the two of Aischines\r\n(139) and extending to that of Philonides (154 a) (P., VI, 14.13-16.5)\r\nmust have stood to the west of the base of Telemachos and along the\r\nSouth Terrace wall some 20 meters south of the temple of Zeus, where\r\nmany of the following pedestals were found in the order named by\r\nPausanias: that of Aischines (139) was found in the Council-house;\r\nthat of Archippos (140) nearby between the South Terrace wall and the\r\nnorth wing of the Council-house; that of Epitherses (147) opposite the\r\nsixth column of the temple from the west, some eleven paces from the\r\nSouth Terrace wall, and the fragment of the base of the honor statue of\r\nAntigonos (147 f) very near it; the bronze foot of one of the statues\r\nof Kapros (150) was found in the South Terrace wall, 24.40 meters from\r\nthe southwest corner of the temple; and lastly, the base of the “honor”\r\nstatue of Philonides (154 a), Alexander’s courier, was found in the\r\nsouthwest corner of the Altis at the extreme west end of the South\r\nTerrace wall, almost, if not exactly, in its original position.[2332]\r\nThus Pausanias, after coming south to the statue of Telemachos, first\r\ngoes eastward as far as the statue of Prokles, then returns, repassing\r\nthe two chariots on the way without remark, and then continues westward\r\nto the southwestern corner of the Altis. All statues west of that\r\nof Telemachos are of the fifth and fourth centuries B. C., with the\r\nexception of one, that of Eutelidas (148), who won in Ol. 38. This is\r\nthe oldest statue in the Altis, despite Pausanias’ statement,[2333] and\r\nit doubtless originally stood in the area occupied later toward the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century B. C. by the temple of Zeus, but was then\r\ntransferred to its new position south of the temple.\r\n\r\nAfter the statue of Philonides, there are still 19 statues of victors\r\nand “honor” men to dispose of in this first ἔφοδος, those from Brimias\r\nto Glaukon (155-169, P., VI, 16.5-16.9). Of these statues, the base of\r\nthat of Leonidas of Naxos (155a), the founder of the great building\r\njust outside the southwestern corner of the Altis named after him, was\r\ndiscovered in a Byzantine wall before the eastern end of the north\r\nfront of that building, while that of Seleadas (159) was unearthed\r\nwithin the ruins of the same building; the base which supported the\r\ngroup-monument of Polypeithes and Kalliteles (160-161)—which, owing\r\nto the early dates of their victories, some time between Ols. (?) 66\r\nand 70 (= 516 and 500 B. C.), must have stood originally in the area\r\nlater occupied by the temple of Zeus, like that of the above-mentioned\r\nEutelidas—a little to the south of the Byzantine church, between the\r\nbases of the statues of Leonidas and Glaukon; two fragments of the base\r\nof the statue of Deinosthenes (163) have been found, one east of the\r\napse of the church, the other in the ruins of the Palaistra further\r\nnorth; and lastly, that of Glaukon, built into late walls northwest\r\nof the church.[2334] As the statue of Philonides stood at the extreme\r\nwestern end of the South Altis wall, and as most of these fragments\r\nwere found in the vicinity of the Leonidaion, it would be natural to\r\nconclude that the majority of these later statues stood in the spaces\r\njust outside the West Altis wall. But at the end of the first ἔφοδος\r\n(VI, 17.1) Pausanias says that he has so far named statues “within the\r\nAltis”; hence most investigators have placed these 19 statues either\r\nwest of the temple of Zeus or in the space at the southwestern corner\r\nof the Altis. A little further on we shall see that many other victor\r\nstatues, not mentioned by Pausanias, stood just outside the West Altis\r\nwall, and it is doubtful whether his words ἐν τῇ Ἄλτει (VI, 17.1)\r\nshould be taken thus literally, especially on any theory of his use\r\nof earlier accounts in the final compiling of his own. If they were\r\n“within” the Altis, they could scarcely have stood to the west or\r\nsouthwest of the temple of Zeus, for the second ἔφοδος, as we shall\r\nsee, passed there.\r\n\r\nA better alternative can be found. In describing the Leonidaion (V,\r\n15.2), Pausanias says that this building stood “outside the sacred\r\nenclosure at the processional entrance into the Altis ... separated\r\nfrom this entrance by a street; for what the Athenians call lanes,\r\nthe Eleans name streets.”[2335] Now Doerpfeld has shown that inside\r\nthe West Altis wall and parallel to it—just south of the base of\r\nPhilonides’ statue—is a line of bases ending in the later South wall\r\nof the Altis, so that this West wall and row of pedestals form a _cul\r\nde sac_ (see Plan B).[2336] It is clear that no such row of statues\r\nwould have been placed leading up to a dead wall; therefore these\r\nstatues must have stood there before the wall was built, and must once\r\nhave formed the eastern boundary of a broad street skirting the eastern\r\nside of the Leonidaion, which was twice as wide as later, when the wall\r\ncut off half its breadth and made it a “lane,” though the older name\r\n“street” was retained. The later Roman enlargement of the Altis is\r\nwell known. The long row of pedestals to the south of and parallel to\r\nthose already discussed as standing along the line of the South Terrace\r\nwall, westward of the base of Telemachos, once constituted the southern\r\nboundary of the “Processional Way” (ὁδὸς πομπική), which ran from the\r\nLeonidaion to where it debouched into the Altis at its southeastern\r\ncorner. Originally outside the Altis, they were later, together\r\nwith the road itself, included in it. The pedestals, then, in the\r\nabove-mentioned _cul de sac_, and also the fourteen (among them that\r\nof Metellus Macedonicus; see Plan B) that adorned the south side of\r\nthe Processional Way, may be the remains of some of these last statues\r\nmentioned by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND EPHODOS OF PAUSANIAS.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the second ἔφοδος, which is introduced by these\r\nwords: Εἰ δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ Λεωνιδαίου πρὸς τὸν βωμὸν τὸν μέγαν ἀφικέσθαι\r\nτῇ δεξιᾷ θελήσειας, τοσάδε ἔστι σοὶ τῶν ἀνηκόντων ἐς μνήμην.[2337]\r\nThe Leonidaion, the site of which was still in dispute till after\r\nthe close of the excavations, was finally identified by Treu[2338]\r\nwith the so-called _Suedwestbau_, as had been already assumed by many\r\ninvestigators.[2339] The site of the Great Altar, however, is still\r\nundetermined. The elliptical depression to the east of the Pelopion,\r\nwhose dimensions (125 feet in circumference) agree with the figures\r\nof Pausanias[2340] for the _prothysis_, or lowest stage of the\r\naltar, identified with it by most scholars,[2341] must now be given\r\nup since the more recent excavations of Doerpfeld, which prove it to\r\nbe the remains of two prehistoric dwelling houses with apse-like\r\nends.[2342] Nor can the remains of walls lying between the Heraion and\r\nthe Pelopion, formerly supposed to be those of an altar, any longer\r\nbe referred to the Great Altar (as Puchstein and Wernicke referred\r\nthem)[2343] since Doerpfeld’s recent discoveries. So we are dependent\r\non the words of Pausanias alone for its location, who says that it\r\nstood “equidistant from the Pelopion and the sanctuary of Hera, but in\r\nfront of both,”[2344] therefore somewhat northwest of the elliptical\r\ndepression nearer the centre of the Altis.[2345] Our problem, then, is\r\nto find Pausanias’ route between these two points, and here again, as\r\nat the beginning of the first ἔφοδος, we must rightly interpret the\r\nwords ἐν δεξιᾷ. Michaelis, in his article on the use of ἐν δεξιᾷ and\r\nἐν ἀριστερᾷ in Pausanias’ work, made these words refer to the southern\r\nside of the Processional Way, _i. e._, to the side at the right of\r\nPausanias, who was facing east after arriving at the Leonidaion.[2346]\r\nThus the statues already mentioned along the South Terrace wall\r\n(Aischines to Philonides, 139-154a) would now be on his left side.\r\nOn this interpretation both Hirschfeld and Doerpfeld had the second\r\nἔφοδος follow the Processional Way eastward parallel to the first—thus\r\nincluding the line of pedestals, which we have referred to the end of\r\nthe first—and then, near the Councilhouse, curve northward in front\r\nof the temple of Zeus, which virtually would be a repetition of the\r\nfirst ἔφοδος. On this theory Doerpfeld[2347] wrongly explained the\r\nfirst route as containing statues ἐν τῇ Ἄλτει, while the second was\r\noutside the older Altis, and so, though equally long, contained fewer\r\nstatues. But against this interpretation it must be urged that the\r\nPeriegete is describing the Altis of his day, when the road in question\r\nwas included within its boundaries, and that the Great Altar and the\r\ntwo last statues mentioned (187, 188) as standing near the pillar of\r\nOinomaos were always inside.[2348] And neither this Processional Way\r\nnor the space before the eastern front of the temple of Zeus were\r\nlocalities for “unimportant mixed statues.”[2349] Furthermore, if he\r\nhad merely retraced his steps after arriving at the Leonidaion—and he\r\nsays nothing of returning—he would not have begun a new route[2350],\r\nbut would have said something like this: Εἰ δὲ ὀπίσω ἀναστρέψας ἀπὸ τοῦ\r\nΛεωνιδαίου πρὸς τὸν βωμὸν αὖθις ἀφικέσθαι τῇ δεξιᾷ θελήσειας.[2351] So\r\nit is simpler to conclude that the new route wound around the western\r\nand northern sides of the temple of Zeus over the temple terrace.[2352]\r\nAs no building is mentioned on the way, and as the north side of the\r\ntemple would probably have been called ἀριστερὰ πλευρά (in accordance\r\nwith the usage discussed above in connection with the Heraion), and\r\nas the Pelopion faces southwest, the words ἐν δεξιᾷ can refer only\r\nto the right hand of Pausanias, _i. e._, the right side of the road\r\nfollowed. If we assume that these words originally stood after τοσάδε\r\nἔστι σοί and were transferred by a later copyist, the difficulty is\r\nresolved.[2353]\r\n\r\nOf the nineteen victor statues in this second route (170-188, VI,\r\n17.1-18.7) no bases have been found.[2354] But of the three “honor”\r\nstatues included, one base, that of the rhetorician Gorgias of\r\nLeontini (184a), was recovered 10 meters northeast of the temple of\r\nZeus, and so probably not very far from its original position;[2355]\r\nfor Pausanias mentions only three more statues, before he comes to the\r\nlast two in this ἔφοδος, which two stood in this vicinity. The parts\r\nof the Altis to the west and north of the temple were unimportant\r\ntill the time of Alexander the Great, and were, therefore, remarkably\r\nfree of monuments. In the whole description of Pausanias, we know of\r\nonly three altars (those of Aphrodite, the Seasons, and the Nymphs)\r\nand a wild olive tree (the “Olive of the Beautiful Crown”) to the\r\nwest of the temple (V, 15.3), and only of the votive offerings of a\r\ncertain Mikythos or Smikythos to the north of it (V, 26.2).[2356] As\r\nthe statue of Gorgias stood among the “unimportant mixed statues”\r\nalready mentioned (184-186), these must have stood somewhere north\r\nof the temple near its eastern end. Finally, the two ancient wooden\r\nstatues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios (187-188, P., VI, 18.7) are\r\nmentioned by themselves as near the column of Oinomaos, which Pausanias\r\nelsewhere[2357] says stood near the Great Altar of Zeus to the left of\r\na road running south from it to the temple. Pausanias, after describing\r\nthese “mixed” statues, may have finally left the route thus far\r\nfollowed and introduced these last two statues as quite distinct from\r\nthe second ἔφοδος.[2358] But he does not seem to have gone far from his\r\nroute, for immediately after ending his account of the victor statues,\r\nhe begins his account of the Treasuries, which lay beyond the Great\r\nAltar farther north.[2359] (Plans A and B.)\r\n\r\nThus Pausanias ends his second route somewhere short of the Great\r\nAltar, and it appears after all to be only a continuation of the first,\r\nforming with it one unbroken “_Rundgang_,” though in quite a different\r\nsense of the word from that intended by Doerpfeld.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of these two routes, and a comparison of the dates of the\r\nvictorious athletes,[2360] we can draw the following conclusions as to\r\nthe positions of the victor statues mentioned by Pausanias as standing\r\nin the Altis at Olympia:\r\n\r\n1. The twenty-eight oldest statues—exclusive of the five already\r\nmentioned as having been removed from the area of the later temple of\r\nZeus[2361]—dating from Ol. 58 (= 548 B. C., Pythokritos, 128 b) to Ol.\r\n76 (= 476 B. C., Theognetos, 83), _i. e._, approximately down to the\r\ndate of the founding of the temple,[2362] stood in the space between\r\nthe eastern front of the temple and the Echo Colonnade, or to the south\r\nof it near the South Altis wall. Only one statue (that of Protolaos,\r\n48) stood as far north as the _Eretrian Bull_. Thus the southeastern\r\npart of the Altis was the oldest part dedicated to victor statues.\r\n\r\n2. After this space was mostly filled, the next statues, those dating\r\nfrom Ol. 77 (= 472 B. C., Kallias, 50) to Ol. 93 (= 408 B. C., Eubotas,\r\n75), _i. e._, from about the time of the foundation of the temple to\r\nnear the date of the battle of Aigospotamoi, fifty-one in number,\r\nstood between the Heraion and the _Victory_ of Paionios; only one\r\nstood as far south as the Altis wall, while seven stood around the\r\n_Chariots_, ten around the _Victory_, twenty around the _Bull_, and\r\nthe rest further north (including 176, 185 of the second ἔφοδος, which\r\nstood north of the eastern end of the temple). Diagoras and his family\r\n(59-63), boxers and pancratiasts, had their statues near the older\r\nfamous boxer Euthymos (56); Alkainetos and his sons (64-66), boxers,\r\nbesides many other pugilists, had theirs near the Diagorids; Tellon\r\n(102) had his near that of his compatriot Epikradios (101); later\r\nAchæans had theirs near that of their countryman Oibotas (29), and\r\nSpartans near that of Chionis (111); some, as the three victors from\r\nHeraia (176, 177, 32),[2363] stood far apart only apparently, for the\r\nlast one had his statue near the _Bull_, and so not far from the other\r\ntwo, though these are named in the second ἔφοδος.\r\n\r\n3. From near the date of the battle of Aigospotamoi, down to about the\r\nbirth of Alexander the Great, _i. e._, from Ol. 94 to Ol. 106 (= 404\r\nto 356 B. C.), thirty-six statues filled in the intervals left among\r\nthese older statues; fifteen stood near the Heraion; five between it\r\nand the _Bull_, seven around the _Bull_, five around the _Victory_, one\r\nnear the _Chariots_, and three along the South Altis wall. Euthymenes\r\nand Kritodamos (78, 80) had their monuments near that of their older\r\ncountryman (79), whose statue was made by Myron; the Ephesians,\r\nPyrilampes and Athenaios (35, 36), had their statues beside that of\r\ntheir benefactor Lysandros (35 a).\r\n\r\n4. After Alexander’s time, in consequence of the recent building of\r\nthe Philippeion, Leonidaion, and Theekoleon to the west of the Altis,\r\nthe western side of the temple of Zeus (and, to a lesser extent, the\r\nnorthern) became important, and henceforth statues surrounded the\r\ntemple on all sides. Of the thirty-three statues of this epoch, nine\r\nstood to the west of the temple, four to the north, and seven to the\r\nsouth, while the rest stood either to the east, or, perhaps, near the\r\nHeraion. We shall see also that many later statues, known to us from\r\ninscriptions only, stood outside the Altis, to the west and northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUES NOT MENTIONED BY PAUSANIAS, BUT KNOWN FROM RECOVERED BASES.\r\n\r\nHaving established these data, it is not difficult, from the positions\r\nof the many inscribed fragmentary bases found at Olympia and referred\r\nto victor statues not mentioned by Pausanias, from the approximate\r\ndates of the victories as gained from the age of the inscriptions, and\r\nby again employing the system of groups already mentioned, to state\r\nquite definitely where many of these other statues stood. Pausanias,\r\nwho mentions 187 victors with 192 monuments in his two ἔφοδοι,\r\nexpressly states that he enumerates only those “who had some title\r\nto fame or whose statues were better made.”[2364] The reasons for\r\nhis selection and the fact that he mentions the statue of no athlete\r\ncertainly later than the middle of the second century B. C. (although\r\nwe know from inscriptions that statues were set up far into the third\r\ncentury A. D., at least)[2365] have been subjects of much discussion,\r\nbut hardly concern us here.[2366] The three latest statues of victors\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, whose dates are fixed, may be given: those of\r\nKleitomachos, who won παγκράτιον and πύξ in Ols. 141 and 142 (= 216\r\nand 212 B. C.);[2367] of Kapros, victor in παγκράτιον and πάλη in\r\nOl. 142 (= 212 B. C.);[2368] and of Akestorides, victor πώλων ἅρματι\r\nsometime between Ols. 142 and 144 (= 212 and 204 B. C.).[2369] Still\r\nlater statues of victors named by Pausanias, whose dates can not be\r\nexactly determined, are those of Sodamas, who won παίδων στάδιον some\r\ntime between Ols. 142 and 145 (= 212 and 200 B. C.);[2370] of Amyntas,\r\nvictor in παίδων παγκράτιον in Ol. (?) 146 (= 196 B. C.);[2371]\r\nof Timon, victor in πένταθλον in Ols. 146 or 147 (= 196 or 192 B.\r\nC.);[2372] and of Lysippos, victor in παίδων πάλη some time between\r\nOls. 149 and 157 (= 184 and 152 B. C.).[2373] Of the first century A.\r\nD., Pausanias mentions three victors without statues: Artemidoros,\r\nwho won παγκράτιον in Ol. 212 (= 69 A. D.);[2374] Polites, victor\r\nin στάδιον, δίαυλος and δόλιχος in Ol. 212;[2375] and Hermogenes,\r\nvictor in στάδιον twice, δίαυλος once, and as ὁπλίτης thrice, in Ols.\r\n215, 216, 217 (= 81-89 A. D.).[2376] The words of Pliny, _Olympiae,\r\nubi omnium qui vicissent statuas dicari mos erat_[2377] refer, of\r\ncourse, as we have already pointed out, only to the privilege and not\r\nto the actual fact, for many victors would have no statues, as it\r\nwas necessary for them or their relatives or city-states to meet the\r\nexpenses of their erection.[2378] No more is the rest of his statement\r\nto be taken literally, _i. e._, that those victors who were victorious\r\nthree times had the right to erect portrait statues in their honor;\r\nfor we have, as has already been shown, at least one exception.[2379]\r\nBesides we know that portrait statues were practically unknown\r\nbefore the fourth century B. C. Most of the victor statues were mere\r\ntypes—those of Hermes and Herakles being common—without individualized\r\nfeatures, simply representing the various contests by position or\r\nsome characteristic, _e. g._, the helmet and shield for “hoplite”\r\nvictors.[2380]\r\n\r\nFive of these inscriptions have been referred to the sixth and fifth\r\ncenturies B. C.[2381] Of these the inscribed base of Pantares was\r\nfound near the South Altis wall, and the statue must originally have\r\nstood east of the temple of Zeus, near the chariot of Gelo (90), for\r\nthese two were the only victors from Gela, and won in the same kind\r\nof contest and at nearly the same date.[2382] The statues of Phrikias\r\nof Pelinna and Phanas of Pellene, both representing victors in the\r\nheavy-armed race, to which I have ascribed the two archaic marble\r\nheads (Fig. 30), the former found west of the temple of Zeus and the\r\nlatter to the south of it, must originally have stood in the area of\r\nthe later temple and then have been removed.[2383] That of an unknown\r\nvictor, whose name ended in ...αδας,[2384] the two fragments of whose\r\nbase were found, one near the Heraion and the other to the east of the\r\ntemple of Zeus, should have stood near the statues of the only other\r\npancratiasts of a similar age, either near those of Dorieus (61), who\r\nwon in Ols. 87 to 89 (= 432 to 424 B. C.), and Damagetos (62), who won\r\nin Ols. 82 and 83 (= 452 and 448 B. C.), in the zone of the _Bull_, or\r\nnear that of Timasitheos (82), who won some time between Ols. (?) 65\r\nand 67 inclusive (= 520 and 512 B. C.), in the zone of the _Victory_.\r\nLastly, the second inscribed base of Xenombrotos (133), found near\r\nthe Council-house outside the South Altis wall, doubtless once stood\r\nnear the first (the epigram from which is preserved by Pausanias, VI,\r\n14.12), along this wall to the east of the base of Telemachos.[2385]\r\n\r\nNo inscribed fragments of bases dating from the fourth century B. C.\r\nhave been found.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the third century B. C., we shall see that most of the\r\nrecovered bases were found either in the western part of the Altis,\r\nin the neighborhood of the Philippeion, Theekoleon, and Leonidaion,\r\non both sides of the West Altis wall, or still farther west and\r\nnorthwest, especially in or near the Palaistra and Prytaneion. We have\r\nalready seen that most of the statues named by Pausanias dating from\r\nAlexander’s time stood to the west (and north) of the temple of Zeus.\r\nAs Pausanias enumerates only statues ἐν δεξιᾷ of his route around the\r\ntemple to the Great Altar, these statues farther west and northwest\r\nare omitted from his account. Of the four bases of statues referred\r\nto the third century, all belong to Elean victors; three were found\r\nwest and northwest of the Prytaneion and beyond, showing that these\r\nstatues once stood in the vicinity of this building, and the fourth\r\nwas found farther south, by the Palaistra, where it probably stood.\r\nThus the base of the wrestler Nikarchos, son of Physsias, was found\r\nin a late wall west of the Prytaneion;[2386] that of the statue of an\r\nunknown victor, son of Taurinos, was found at the southeast corner of\r\nthe Palaistra;[2387] that of another unknown victor, the son of\r\n...phinos, was found in the _Nordwestgraben_;[2388] the base of the\r\nstatue of Thersonides, son of Paianodoros, victor κέλητι πωλικῷ, was\r\nfound northwest of the Prytaneion, between the Roman baths and east\r\nhall of the Gymnasion.[2389]\r\n\r\nOf the four statues referred with certainty to the second century\r\nB. C., all but one were found to the west of the Altis, in a region\r\nranging from the Philippeion, northwest of the temple of Zeus, to the\r\nLeonidaion southwest of it. Two of them were found outside the West\r\nAltis wall, between the Leonidaion and the Byzantine church. Thus the\r\nbase of the statue of D...gonos, twice victor in πύξ, was found\r\noutside the apse of the Byzantine church and west of the West Altis\r\nwall;[2390] the fragments of that of an unknown boy victor in wrestling\r\nor the pankration were found in the East Byzantine wall;[2391] that\r\nof an unknown victor, συνωρίδι τελείᾳ (twice), and ἅρματι τελείῳ, was\r\nfound south of the Philippeion.[2392] The fragment of the base of the\r\nstatue of another unknown victor in wrestling, the son of the Elean\r\nAigyptos, was found to the northeast of the Leonidaion.[2393]\r\n\r\nOf the seven bases referred to the second and first centuries B. C.,\r\nthree were found in or near the Byzantine church, showing that such\r\nstatues may have stood in the Greek building which was later converted\r\ninto the church.[2394] Two more were found near the southwest corner\r\nof the Altis, and therefore may once have stood near the statue of\r\nPhilonides, which Pausanias mentions as standing in that vicinity.\r\nTwo others stood farther away, one inside the Prytaneion, the other\r\nnortheast of the temple of Zeus. Thus the base of an unknown victor,\r\nthe son of Aristotle, συνωρίδι πωλικῇ, was found in front of the north\r\nside of the Byzantine church;[2395] that of Aristodamos, the son of\r\nAleximachos of Elis, was found in the floor of the church;[2396] that\r\nof an unknown victor was found northeast of the temple of Zeus;[2397]\r\nthat of a victor συνωρίδι πωλικῇ, whose name ended in ...chos, the\r\nson of the Elean Nikodromos, was found southwest of the Altis before\r\nthe West Altis wall;[2398] the base of two unknown victors from Elis\r\nwere found respectively in the Prytaneion[2399] and northwest of the\r\nByzantine church,[2400] while that of another Elean, Antigenes, the son\r\nof Jason, victor συνωρίδι πωλικῇ, was found in the southwest corner of\r\nthe Altis.[2401]\r\n\r\nThe positions of the twenty-four bases (belonging to monuments of\r\ntwenty-two victors) with certainty referred to the first pre-Christian\r\ncentury were very scattered. One large Pentelic marble _bathron_,\r\nsupporting the monuments of seven victors of the family of Philistos,\r\nmust have stood just south of the Philippeion, where most of the\r\nfragments were found. The bases of the statues of two other sons and\r\na grandson of the same victor have been recovered, and doubtless\r\nstood near by, thus forming a family group of ten, outnumbering that\r\nof Diagoras (59-63 and 52) mentioned by Pausanias. The omission of\r\nso important a monument in the description of the Periegete has, of\r\ncourse, been used as an indication of his employment of earlier lists.\r\nOf the other bases, two were found outside the South Altis wall, west\r\nof the Council-house, and two east of it; two east of the temple of\r\nZeus (one of them that of the youthful Tiberius, afterwards Roman\r\nemperor, which must have stood near the _Eretrian Bull_, where it was\r\nfound); one southwest of the temple, along the South Terrace wall,\r\npointing to a position among the statues there named by Pausanias;\r\none east of the Byzantine church, pointing to a position south of\r\nthe Theekoleon, two to the northwest of the Altis in the vicinity of\r\nthe Prytaneion; while the others were found scattered all the way\r\nfrom the northeastern part of the Altis to the bed of the Kladeos.\r\nThus over half (13) of these statue-bases were found in the west and\r\nnorthwest of the Altis and beyond; the space to the east of the temple\r\nof Zeus—called _frequentissimus celeberrimusque_ by Scherer—seems now\r\nnot to have been greatly prized. Most of these victories were gained\r\nin hippic contests. Horse-racing had early been discontinued, but\r\nwas revived at the end of the first century B. C., when members of\r\nthe imperial family, emulating the earlier triumphs of the princes\r\nof Sicily and Macedonia, became competitors. Thus Tiberius won in\r\nthe chariot-race, and a few years later his nephew Germanicus in the\r\nsame event. The list of these bases of victor statues of the first\r\ncentury B. C. and their provenience follows. A fragment of the base\r\nof the victor Agilochos, son of Nikeas of Elis, victor κέλητι πωλικῷ,\r\nwas found in the East Byzantine wall.[2402] One fragment of the\r\n_bathron_ of the family group of the Elean Philistos,[2403] victors\r\nin hippic contests, was found southwest of the Pelopion, while four\r\nothers were discovered south of the Philippeion; the base of the\r\nstatue of Philonikos, a son of Philistos, was also found south of the\r\nPhilippeion,[2404] and that of another unnamed son was discovered to\r\nthe west of the Prytaneion,[2405] while the place of finding of that\r\nof Charops, the son of Telemachos, has not been recorded.[2406] The\r\nbase of the monument of Aristarchos was found east of the Byzantine\r\nchurch,[2407] that of Damaithidas, son of Menippos of Elis, a victor\r\nσυνωρίδι πωλικῇ, west of the Council-house (south building),[2408] and\r\nthat of Thrasymachos (or Thrasymedes) in the _Nordostgraben_.[2409] A\r\nfragment of the base of the statue of Demokrates of Antioch in Karia\r\nwas found in the bed of the river Kladeos,[2410] that of a victor whose\r\nname began with Demo..., northeast of the Prytaneion,[2411] while\r\nthat of Thaliarchos, the son of Soterichos of Elis, victor πὺξ παίδων\r\nκαὶ ἀνδρῶν, was found east of the Council-house.[2412] Bases from\r\ntwo statues of Menedemos, son of Menedemos of Elis, victor συνωρίδι\r\nπωλικῇ, were found, one east of the temple of Zeus, the other inside\r\nthe Heraion.[2413] Lykomedes, the son of Aristodemos of Elis, victor\r\nσυνωρίδι πωλικῇ, also had two statues; the base of one was found in\r\nfront of the West Byzantine wall on the south side of the temple of\r\nZeus, that of the other in the _Westgraben_.[2414] The front part of\r\nthe base of the statue of Archiadas, the son of Timolas of Elis, who\r\nwon κέλητι πωλικῷ, was discovered southwest of the temple of Zeus, on\r\nthe Terrace wall.[2415] That of an unknown victor in the δίαυλος, the\r\nson of ...krates of Miletos, was found near the _Osthalle_,[2416]\r\nwhile that inscribed with the name of Tiberius Claudius Nero of Rome,\r\nwho won a victory τεθρίππῳ just before the end of the century, was\r\nfound south of the _Eretrian Bull_.[2417]\r\n\r\nNineteen inscribed base-fragments have been referred to the\r\npost-Christian centuries, thirteen to the first, three to the\r\nsecond, and three to the third. The spaces around the temple of Zeus\r\n(especially its eastern front) are again the favorite ones. Thus the\r\nbases of three statues were found east of the temple (one _in situ_),\r\ntwo near its southeastern corner, three at the northeastern corner\r\n(one, that of Germanicus Cæsar, the nephew of Tiberius, just to the\r\nnorth of the _Eretrian Bull_, and so originally standing here near\r\nthat of his uncle), while another stood opposite the fifth column from\r\nthe east on the north side of the temple. Most of these statues must\r\nhave been passed by Pausanias in his first ἔφοδος, which is, perhaps,\r\nanother evidence of his dependence on older lists in compiling his\r\nown. Two other bases were found to the southwest of the temple, one of\r\nthem near its corner, and the other nearer the corner of the Altis,\r\n_i. e._, near the base of the statue of Philonides (154a). Thus eleven\r\nstatues stood near the temple. Of the others, four were found in the\r\nvicinity of the Palaistra (one inside _in situ_), one to the northeast\r\nof the Prytaneion, another northeast of the Byzantine church, while the\r\ntwo remaining ones were found in the eastern part of the Altis, near\r\nthe entrance to the Stadion and before the Echo Colonnade respectively.\r\nThe base of the last statue of a victor known to have been erected at\r\nOlympia, that of Valerios Eklektos of Sinope, previously mentioned, was\r\nfound _in situ_ in the Palaistra. We append a detailed list of these\r\nbases, giving the provenience of each.\r\n\r\nOf the first century A. D., the fore part of the base of the monument\r\nof Germanicus, son of Nero Claudius Drusus, was found east of the\r\ntemple of Zeus, north of the _Eretrian Bull_;[2418] the base of that\r\nof Gnaios Markios was found opposite the southeast corner of the\r\ntemple;[2419] that of Markos Antonios Kallippos Peisanos, son of M.\r\nAntonios Alexion of Elis, who won κέλητι πωλικῷ in Ol. 177 (= 72 A.\r\nD.), was found in the West Byzantine wall at the southwest corner\r\nof the temple.[2420] The base of the monument of Polyxenos, son of\r\nApollophanes of Zakynthos, victor in πάλη παίδων, was discovered at\r\nthe southwest corner of the Altis far from its probable original\r\nlocation;[2421] that of P. Kornelios Ariston, son of Eirenaios of\r\nEphesos, victor in παγκράτιον παίδων in Ol. 207 (= 49 A. D.), in front\r\nof the north wall of the Palaistra;[2422] the marble plate from that\r\nof Tiberios Klaudios Aphrodeisios of Elis (?), who won κέλητι τελείῳ\r\nin Ol. 208 (= 53 A. D.), was unearthed near its semicircular base,\r\nwhich was found _in situ_ east of the temple.[2423] Four fragments\r\nof the base of the monument of the boy pancratiast Nikanor, son of\r\nSokles of Ephesos, were recovered east of the temple, and another one\r\nnear its southeastern corner.[2424] The base of that of Markos Deida\r\nof Antioch, victor in πάλη παίδων in Ol. 219 (= 97 A. D.), was found\r\nsoutheast of the temple;[2425] that of an unknown victor in the δίαυλος\r\nand as ὁπλίτης (three times) in the North Byzantine wall;[2426] that of\r\nHermas, son of Ision of Antioch, a victor in παγκράτιον, between the\r\nWest Altis wall and the southeastern corner of the Palaistra;[2427]\r\nthat of Diogenes, son of Dionysios of Ephesos, victor σαλπίγγι five\r\ntimes, before the centre of the Echo Colonnade.[2428] The inscribed\r\nfragments of the bronze legs of the statues of two unknown victors\r\nhave also been excavated, the one near the starting-place in the\r\nStadion,[2429] the other near the fifth column from the east on the\r\nnorth side of the temple of Zeus.[2430]\r\n\r\nOf the second century A. D., we have the following bases: that of Kasia\r\nM[nasithea], daughter of M. Betilenos (or Vetulenos) Laitos of Elis,\r\nwho won ἅρματι πωλικῷ, was found northeast of the Prytaneion;[2431] the\r\nupper part of the pedestal of the _quadriga_ of L. Minicius Natalis of\r\nRome, victor ἅρματι τελείῳ in Ol. 227 (= 129 A. D.), was unearthed in\r\nthe east wall of the Palaistra.[2432] The base of the statue erected to\r\nthe herald P. Ailios Artemas of Laodikeia (in Phrygia?) was found 20\r\nmeters north of the northeastern corner of the temple of Zeus.[2433]\r\n\r\nOf the third century A. D., _i. e._, after the time of Pausanias, we\r\nhave these bases: that of P. Ailios Alkandridas, son of Damokratidas of\r\nSparta, twice victor in (?) πάλη, was found northeast of the Byzantine\r\nchurch;[2434] that of Theopropos of Rhodes, who won κέλητι, was\r\nunearthed east of the temple of Zeus, just south of the basis of the\r\n_Nike_ of Paionios;[2435] the base of the statue of Valerios Eklektos\r\nof Sinope, victor as κῆρυξ in Ols. 256, 258-260 (= 245, 253-261 A.\r\nD.), was found _in situ_ in the Palaistra.[2436] We should add for\r\nthis century also the inscribed bronze diskos, the votive (not victor)\r\noffering of Poplios (Publius) Asklepiades of Corinth, which was found\r\n2.5 meters south of the Southwest gate of the Altis.[2437]\r\n\r\nA study of these inscriptions shows that the practice of setting up\r\nvictor statues decreased in the fourth and third centuries B. C., but\r\nwas revived in the second and first, only to decrease again after\r\nthe first century A. D. On the other hand, the inscriptions show that\r\nthe number of “honor” statues correspondingly increased. Of the later\r\nstatues, most were erected to Eleans; names of victors from Sicily and\r\nItaly, and from the older Greek states, as Sparta and Athens, are rare,\r\nbeing replaced by those from Asia Minor and the newer towns of the\r\nGreek mainland. This falling off of interest in the games was largely\r\ndue to professionalism. In the second century B. C., we begin to read\r\nin the inscriptions of περιοδονῖκαι, _i. e._, victors winning prizes\r\nat all the four national games, a sure indication of the professional\r\nspirit. Even Pausanias mentions two such victors.[2438]\r\n\r\nFrom these inscribed base-fragments, we have knowledge of 61 victors\r\n(63 monuments)[2439] who had statues erected to them, though they are\r\nnot named in the lists of Pausanias. Of the 192 monuments mentioned by\r\nPausanias, 40 are known to us from recovered fragments of bases and\r\nstatues. So if we assume the same ratio between known and unknown for\r\nthose not mentioned by Pausanias, we should have the proportion 40 :\r\n192 : : 63 : _x_, where _x_ would equal 302, making a grand total of\r\n494 monuments, which number can not be far from the actual number of\r\nvictor statues adorning the Altis.[2440]\r\n\r\n\r\nOLYMPIC VICTOR MONUMENTS ERECTED OUTSIDE OLYMPIA.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter I, we showed that frequently statues or other monuments\r\nwere erected in their native towns as a part of the honor paid to\r\nOlympic victors. We shall now give a list of all such monuments set\r\nup in various parts of the Greek world which are known to us from\r\nnotices in ancient literature and from inscriptions.[2441] These, like\r\nthe statues in the Altis, range in date from the seventh century B.\r\nC. to the fourth A. D., and offer still greater variety in the kinds\r\nof dedication. It will be best to arrange the list as far as possible\r\nchronologically and in numerical sequence, adding the authorities for\r\nthe dates of the various victories in the footnotes.[2442]\r\n\r\nVictors with monuments of the seventh century B. C.:\r\n\r\n1. Chionis, of Sparta.[2443] Besides his statue by Myron and the tablet\r\ncontaining a list of his victories at Olympia mentioned by Pausanias\r\n(VI, 13.2), the same writer records a similar tablet in Sparta, erected\r\nnear the royal tomb of the Agids, likewise set up by his townspeople\r\n(III, 14.3). The Spartan tablet, like the monuments in his honor at\r\nOlympia, was doubtless set up long after the victory, about Ols. 77 or\r\n78 (= 472 or 468 B. C.).\r\n\r\n2. Kylon, of Athens.[2444] Pausanias records that a bronze statue of\r\nthis victor stood upon the Athenian Akropolis, erected, as he supposes,\r\nin honor of his beauty and reputation as an Olympic victor (I, 28.1).\r\nKylon was the leader of the well-known conspiracy of 632 B. C., when\r\nhe tried to make himself tyrant of Athens.[2445] Furtwaengler has\r\nproposed the theory that this monument was not set up in honor of Kylon\r\nby the Athenians, as Pausanias says, but that it was a dedication by\r\nhis family after his Olympic victory.[2446] A. Schaefer,[2447] however,\r\nmore justly believed that the statue was an expiatory offering for the\r\nmassacre of Kylon’s companions on the Akropolis,[2448] set up in the\r\ntime of Perikles, the date of which would account for the “beauty” of\r\nthe statue. Still another scholar[2449] believes that Pausanias’ remark\r\nwas called forth by the epigram on the statue.[2450]\r\n\r\n3. Hipposthenes, of Sparta.[2451] Pausanias records that a temple was\r\ndedicated to him in Sparta, where he received divine worship (III,\r\n15.7). It has been argued that the words of Pausanias (_l. c._) show\r\nthat Hipposthenes here was worshiped only in the character of Poseidon,\r\nwhose epithet was ἵππιος (_cf._ P., I, 30.4).[2452]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the sixth century B. C.:\r\n\r\n4. Hetoimokles, son of Hipposthenes of Sparta.[2453] Pausanias mentions\r\na statue of this victor at Sparta (III, 13.9).\r\n\r\n5. Arrhachion, of Phigalia.[2454] Pausanias records the stone statue\r\nin the archaic pose, and with weathered inscription, erected to this\r\nvictor in the market-place at Phigalia (VIII, 40.1), which we have\r\ndiscussed at length in the preceding chapter (Fig. 79).\r\n\r\n6. Kimon, the son of Stesagoras, of Athens.[2455] Aelian mentions αἱ\r\nΚίμωνος ἵπποι χαλκαῖ, very true to the originals, in Athens,[2456]\r\nwhich seem to have been set up in honor of his three chariot victories\r\nat Olympia. His first victory was won when he was in banishment at the\r\nhands of the tyrant Peisistratos, son of Hippokrates. Having entered\r\nhis horses under the tyrant’s name for the second contest, he was in\r\nconsequence recalled, and a third time entered them and won under his\r\nown name.[2457] The pseudo-Andokides confuses this older Kimon with the\r\nyounger, when he calls the latter an Olympic victor.[2458] Similarly a\r\nscholiast on Aristophanes[2459] confuses him with Megakles, who won a\r\nvictory τεθρίππῳ in Ol. 47 (= 592 B. C.).[2460]\r\n\r\n7. Philippos, son of Boutakides, of Kroton.[2461] The people of Egesta\r\nin Sicily erected a shrine over his grave in their town, and paid him\r\ndivine honors on account of his beauty, in which he surpassed all his\r\ncontemporaries.[2462]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fifth century B. C.:\r\n\r\n8. Astylos, or Astyalos, of Kroton.[2463] Besides mentioning his statue\r\nby Pythagoras of Rhegion at Olympia, Pausanias in the same passage (VI,\r\n13.1) mentions another in the temple of Lakinian Hera near Kroton,\r\nwhich his fellow-townsmen pulled down in anger, because he had called\r\nhimself a Syracusan in order to please the Sicilian tyrant Hiero.[2464]\r\nCollignon believes that the statue at Kroton was also a copy of the\r\nwork of Pythagoras at Olympia.[2465]\r\n\r\n9. Euthymos, son of Astykles, of Lokroi Epizephyrioi in South\r\nItaly.[2466] In addition to his statue at Olympia by Pythagoras,\r\nmentioned by Pausanias (VI, 6.4-6),[2467] we know of another statue by\r\nPythagoras set up in Lokroi in honor of this victor.[2468] According to\r\nKallimachos, both statues were struck by lightning at the same time.\r\nOther writers tell wondrous tales of this boxer.[2469]\r\n\r\n10. Theagenes, son of Timosthenes, of Thasos, one of the most famous\r\nOlympic victors.[2470] Besides his statue at Olympia by Glaukias of\r\nAegina (VI, 11.2 and 9), Pausanias says that he knows of many other\r\nplaces in Greece and elsewhere where images of this victor were set up\r\n(VI, 11.9), and records one at Thasos to which the Thasians sacrificed\r\nas to a god (VI, 11.6). The story which he tells about this Thasian\r\nstatue being scourged and falling on the enemy of Theagenes is also\r\nrecounted at greater length by Dio Chrysostom[2471] and is mentioned\r\nby Eusebios.[2472] Lucian says that the statue cured fevers, just as\r\ndid that of Polydamas at Olympia.[2473] Studniczka has argued that the\r\nstatues at Thasos and elsewhere were set up to honor the hero and not\r\nthe victor.[2474]\r\n\r\n11. Ladas, of Sparta.[2475] Two fourth-century epigrams celebrate the\r\nfleetness of Ladas, and the second names Myron as the statuary of a\r\nbronze statue of him.[2476] Pausanias mentions a statue of the same\r\nvictor in the temple of Apollo Lykios in Argos (II, 19.7). Whether the\r\nlatter statue was identical with the one named in the epigram can not\r\nbe finally determined.[2477] Pausanias refers to a stadion of Ladas,\r\nsituated between Mantinea and Orchomenos in Arkadia, in which Ladas\r\npracticed running (VIII, 12.5), and also to his grave between Belemina\r\nand Sparta (III, 21.1).\r\n\r\n12. Kallias, son of Didymias of Athens.[2478] Apart from his statue at\r\nOlympia made by the Athenian painter and sculptor Mikon, mentioned by\r\nPausanias (VI, 6.1),[2479] there was a dedication to him at Athens, as\r\nwe learn from the preserved inscription, which enumerates his thirteen\r\nvictories at Olympia and elsewhere.[2480]\r\n\r\n13. Diagoras, son of Damagetos, of Rhodes, the most famous of Greek\r\nboxers.[2481] In addition to his statue at Olympia by Kallikles, son of\r\nTheokosmos of Megara, mentioned by Pausanias (VI, 7.1-2) as standing\r\namong the group of statues of his sons and grandsons, we learn from\r\nthe scholiast on Pindar, _Ol._ VII, Argum., who quotes Gorgon as his\r\nauthority,[2482] that this ode, which celebrated the Olympic victory of\r\nDiagoras, was attached in golden letters to the walls of the temple of\r\nAthena at Lindos.\r\n\r\n14. Agias, of Pharsalos.[2483] We have already, in Ch. VI, discussed\r\nthe group of marble statues set up at Delphi by Daochos of Pharsalos\r\nin honor of his ancestors who had won in various athletic contests,\r\nwhich was discovered by the French excavators there in 1894. We there\r\nmentioned that Preuner found the same metrical inscription which\r\nappeared on the base of the statue of Agias, the best preserved of\r\nthe group (Pl. 28 and Fig. 68), in the journal of Stackelberg,[2484]\r\nwho had copied it in the early part of the nineteenth century from\r\na base in Pharsalos which has since disappeared. This Thessalian\r\ninscription contained the additional words that Lysippos of Sikyon was\r\nthe sculptor. In both inscriptions the victories of Agias at Olympia\r\nand elsewhere are noted. Thus we know of two statues of Agias, one at\r\nDelphi, the other at Pharsalos, both presumably by Lysippos. Preuner\r\nalso thinks that a third statue may have stood in Olympia.\r\n\r\n15. Cheimon, of Argos.[2485] In mentioning the statue of Cheimon at\r\nOlympia by the sculptor Naukydes of Argos, Pausanias, in the same\r\npassage (VI, 9.3), records another which once stood in Argos, but was\r\nlater removed to the temple of Peace in Rome.[2486]\r\n\r\n16. Leon, son of Antikleidas (or Antalkidas), of Sparta.[2487] A\r\nfragment of Polemon[2488] mentions a statue of this victor. It may have\r\nstood in Olympia, as Foerster without good grounds assumes, or it may\r\nhave stood elsewhere.\r\n\r\n17. Eubotas (Eubatas or Eubatos), of Kyrene.[2489] Besides his statue\r\nat Olympia recorded by Pausanias (VI, 8.3), we learn of another set up\r\nat Kyrene by the victor’s wife for his devotion.[2490]\r\n\r\n18. Promachos, son of Dryon, of Pellene in Achaia.[2491] Pausanias not\r\nonly mentions a bronze statue of this victor at Olympia (VI, 8.5-6),\r\nbut also records one of stone dedicated likewise by his townsmen in the\r\nOld Gymnasion of Pellene (VII, 27.5).\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fifth or fourth centuries B. C.:\r\n\r\n19. An unknown victor, of Argos or (?) Tegea.[2492] Aristotle mentions\r\nan inscription from a statue of an Olympic victor in two passages of\r\nhis _Rhetoric_.[2493] This epigram was repeated by Aristophanes of\r\nByzantion,[2494] who wrongly ascribed it to Simonides.[2495] Where this\r\nstatue stood can not be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fourth century B. C.:\r\n\r\n20. Kyniska, daughter of Archidamos I, of Sparta.[2496] Pausanias,\r\nbefore mentioning the monumental group at Olympia by Apellas of Megara,\r\nwhich consisted of the statues of Kyniska and her charioteer standing\r\nbeside a huge bronze chariot and horses (VI. 1.6), and the small bronze\r\nchariot by the same sculptor, set up in her honor in the vestibule of\r\nthe temple of Zeus (V, 12.5), records that there was a shrine in Sparta\r\nat Plane-tree Grove, near the youths’ exercise ground, erected to the\r\nheroine Kyniska (III, 15.1). This latter dedication, therefore, was not\r\nproperly a victor monument, though Pausanias in the same book says that\r\nKyniska was the first Greek woman to train horses and to win a prize at\r\nOlympia (III, 8.1).\r\n\r\n21. Euryleonis, a victress of Sparta.[2497] Pausanias says that she\r\nhad a statue in her native city near the so-called Σκήνωμα, “Tent”\r\n(III, 17.6). Curtius has suggested that this may be the small building\r\nmentioned by Thukydides as the place where King Pausanias took refuge\r\nwhen pursued by the ephors.[2498]\r\n\r\n22. Archias, son of Eukles, of Hybla.[2499] An epigram in the _Greek\r\nAnthology_[2500] speaks of a statue of this victor at Delphi.\r\n\r\n23. [Phil]okrates, son of Antiphon, of Athens (deme of Krioa).[2501]\r\nAn inscribed base of the statue of this victor has been found in\r\nAthens.[2502]\r\n\r\n24. An unknown victor. An inscribed base, found near the Portico of\r\nAttalos in Athens, records the victories of an unknown athlete at\r\nseveral games, including one in the παγκράτιον ἀνδρῶν at Olympia.[2503]\r\n\r\n25. Phorystas, son of Thriax (or Triax), of (?) Tanagra.[2504]\r\nThe inscribed base of the statue of this victor, giving Kaphisias\r\nof Bœotia as the sculptor, has been discovered in the ruins of\r\nTanagra.[2505] His brother Pammachos won παγκράτιον παίδων at Nemea,\r\nand had a statue at Thebes, the work of Teisikrates, the inscribed base\r\nof which has been recovered.[2506]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fourth or third centuries B. C.:\r\n\r\n26. Aristophon, son of Lysinos, of Athens.[2507] Besides his statue\r\nat Olympia, set up at the cost of the people of Athens, mentioned by\r\nPausanias (VI, 13.11; _cf._ VI, 14.1), we have the inscription from the\r\nbase of another which was set up on the Athenian Akropolis.[2508]\r\n\r\n27. Attalos, father of King Attalos I,[2509] of Pergamon.[2510] The\r\ninscribed base of his great victor monument, erected by Epigonos, has\r\nbeen dis- covered at Pergamon.[2511]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the second century B. C.: none.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the first century B. C.: none.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the first century A. D.:\r\n\r\n28. Xenodamos, of Antikyra in Phokis.[2512] Pausanias mentions a bronze\r\nstatue of this victor in the Old Gymnasion at Antikyra (X, 36.9). G.\r\nHirschfeld[2513] had objected to the statement of Pausanias, in the\r\npassage cited, “that this was the only Olympiad omitted in the Elean\r\nregister,” because of its inconsistency with other passages which\r\nstate that in the 8th Olympiad,[2514] in the 34th,[2515] and in the\r\n104th,[2516] the games were celebrated by intruders, and not by the\r\nEleans, and hence these Olympiads were regarded as invalid and were not\r\nentered in the Elean registers. However, as Frazer points out,[2517]\r\nthe case with Ol. 211 was different. It was doubtless celebrated by\r\nthe Eleans themselves and its validity was not questioned, but either\r\nit was never entered in the register, or, if entered, was later struck\r\nout. Africanus (_cf._ Philostratos)[2518] says that the celebration\r\nof this Olympiad, which should have fallen 65 A. D., was deferred two\r\nyears to favor Nero, who in 67 A. D. received prizes in six events,\r\nincluding the ten-horse chariot-race.[2519] The Eleans, later being\r\nashamed of thus favoring the tyrant, probably removed Ol. 211 from the\r\nregister after his death. It may be that for the same reason statues\r\nof victors of that Olympiad were not set up in the Altis, which would\r\nexplain why that of Xenodamos was set up in his native city, where\r\nPausanias saw it. Not finding his name in the Elean register, Pausanias\r\nwould reason that this victory fell in the disgraced Ol. 211.[2520]\r\n\r\n28a. Titos Phlabios Artemidoros, son of Artemidoros, of Adana in\r\nKilikia.[2521] The inscribed marble tablet from the base of the statue\r\nwhich this victor erected in Naples in honor of his father Artemidoros,\r\nson of Athenodoros, is preserved. It contains a list of his own many\r\nvictories in παγκράτιον and πάλη in games held in Greece, Italy, Asia\r\nMinor, and Egypt. Though the statue was erected to his father, the long\r\ninscription shows that it was intended quite as much to celebrate his\r\nown athletic prowess.[2522]\r\n\r\n29. Titos Phlabios Metrobios, son of Demetrios, of Iasos, Karia.[2523]\r\nThe inscribed base of his statue has been found in Iasos.[2524]\r\n\r\n30. Sarapion, of Alexandria, Egypt.[2525] Pausanias mentions two\r\nstatues of this victor, which stood on either side of the entrance\r\nto the Gymnasion in Elis known as the Maltho. He adds that they were\r\nerected by the Eleans in gratitude for the bestowal of corn in a time\r\nof famine (VI, 23.6). He is not to be confounded with other victors of\r\nthe same name.[2526]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the second century A. D.:\r\n\r\n31. Markos Aurelios Demetrios, of Alexandria, Egypt.[2527] His son,\r\nM. Aurelios Asklepiades, dedicated a statue to him in Rome, the\r\ninscription from the base of which has been recovered.[2528]\r\n\r\n32. Unknown victor, from Magnesia ad Sipylum, in Lydia.[2529] His\r\nstatue in Magnesia is known from the recovered inscribed base.[2530]\r\n\r\n33. Kranaos or Granianos, of Sikyon.[2531] Pausanias mentions a bronze\r\nstatue of this victor as standing in the precincts of the temple of\r\nAsklepios, on the hill of Titane, near Sikyon (II, 11.8).\r\n\r\n34. Titos Ailios Aurelios Apollonios, of Tarsos.[2532] A statue of\r\nthis victor stood in Athens, as we learn from its preserved inscribed\r\nbase.[2533]\r\n\r\n35. Mnasiboulos, of Elateia in Phokis.[2534] His fellow citizens\r\nerected a bronze statue in honor of his repelling the robber horde of\r\nthe Kostobokoi, who overran Greece in the days of Pausanias (X, 34.5).\r\nThe statue stood in “Runner” street.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the third century A. D.:\r\n\r\n36. Aurelios Toalios, of (?) Oinoanda, Lykia.[2535] The inscribed base\r\nof the statue of this victor has been found in Oinoanda.[2536]\r\n\r\n37. Aurelios Metrodoros, of Kyzikos.[2537] The inscribed base of his\r\nstatue was found in Kyzikos, and is now in Constantinople.[2538]\r\n\r\n38. Valerios Eklektos, of Sinope.[2539] Besides his monument at\r\nOlympia, which was erected immediately after 261 A. D.,[2540] we know,\r\nfrom an inscription, of another statue dedicated to him in Athens some\r\ntime between 253 and 257 A. D.[2541]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fourth century A. D.:\r\n\r\n39. Klaudios Rhouphos, also called Apollonios the Pisan, son of\r\nKlaudios Apollonios, of Smyrna.[2542] We learn from an inscription\r\nfound in the Baths of Titus in Rome that his statue stood in the\r\ncouncil-chamber of the Guild of Athletes of Hercules at Rome.[2543]\r\n\r\n40. Philoumenos, of Philadelphia, in Lydia.[2544] The closing verse\r\nof an inscription belonging to the base of his statue is preserved in\r\nPanodoros.[2545] Where the statue stood can not be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf unknown dates:\r\n\r\n41. Ainetos, of (?) Amyklai.[2546] Pausanias mentions the portrait\r\nstatue of this victor at Amyklai (III, 18. 7). He says that he expired\r\neven while the crown was being placed on his head.\r\n\r\n42. Nikokles, of Akriai in Lakonia.[2547] Pausanias mentions a monument\r\n(μνῆμα) erected in his honor at Akriai, between the Gymnasion and the\r\nsea-wall (III, 22.5).\r\n\r\n43. Aigistratos, son of Polykreon, of Lindos in Rhodes.[2548] A statue\r\nof this victor was set up at Lindos, as we learn from the preserved\r\ninscription on its base found there.[2549] He is called in the\r\ninscription the first Lindian victor at Olympia.\r\n\r\n44. An unknown victor, of (?) Delphi.[2550] The inscribed base of his\r\nstatue, with remains of the dedication, was found many years ago at\r\nDelphi by Cockerell.[2551]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have records of other monuments erected to victors, but it is not\r\nclear whether the victories recorded were won at Olympia or elsewhere.\r\nWe list the following three doubtful cases, which have already been\r\nnoted in earlier chapters:\r\n\r\n1. Epicharinos. Pausanias mentions the statue Ἐπιχαρίνου ὁπλιτοδρομεῖν\r\nἀσκήσαντος, by the sculptor Kritios, as standing upon the Athenian\r\nAkropolis (I, 23.9). The inscribed base of this monument was found in\r\n1839, between the Propylaia and the Parthenon.[2552] The inscription\r\nstates that the statue was the joint work of Kritios (thus correcting\r\nthe spelling Κριτίας of Pausanias) and Nesiotes. It was, therefore,\r\na work of the first half of the fifth century B. C., the date of\r\nthe sculptors of the _Tyrannicides_ (Fig. 32). Ross added the word\r\nὁπλιτοδρόμος after the name in the inscription. Michaelis,[2553]\r\nhowever, has inserted the name of the victor’s father. Wilamowitz[2554]\r\nwent further and assumed that Polemon, from whom Pausanias derived the\r\naccount, had already falsely restored the inscription and that the\r\nstatue did not represent Epicharinos, but another victor. This theory\r\nhas been rightly controverted by many scholars.[2555] It is clear that\r\nPausanias got his information from the monument, and not from the\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\n2. Hermolykos, son of Euthoinos or Euthynos. Pausanias mentions the\r\nstatue of the pancratiast Hermolykos as standing on the Akropolis\r\nat Athens (I, 23.10). This was probably Hermolykos the pancratiast,\r\nwho is recorded by Herodotos as having distinguished himself at the\r\nbattle of Mykale in 479 B. C., and as having been afterwards killed in\r\nbattle at Kyrnos in Euboia and buried at Geraistos.[2556] Some scholars\r\nhave advocated the theory that the portrait statue here mentioned by\r\nPausanias was none other than the statue which stood on the Akropolis\r\non the base which was discovered in 1839, dedicated by Hermolykos,\r\nthe son of Diitrephes, the work of the sculptor Kresilas,[2557]\r\nand that the Periegete mistook the latter for the one mentioned by\r\nHerodotos.[2558] However, Frazer finds this explanation “arbitrary and\r\nhighly improbable,” and believes that the base in question supported\r\nthe statue of Diitrephes, pierced with arrows, also mentioned by\r\nPausanias (I, 23.3).[2559] Kirchhoff distinguished not only the statue\r\nof Hermolykos mentioned by Pausanias and the dedication of Hermolykos\r\nrevealed by the recovered base, but both of these from the statue of\r\nthe wounded man mentioned by Pliny (_H. N._, XXXIV, 74). While J. Six\r\nassumed that Hermolykos, son of Diitrephes, dedicated the Kresilæan\r\nstatue in honor of his grandfather Hermolykos, son of Euthoinos, and\r\nthat Pausanias wrongly gathered from the inscribed base that the statue\r\nrepresented Diitrephes,[2560] Furtwaengler believed that Diitrephes was\r\nthe older warrior of the name, mentioned by Thukydides,[2561] and that\r\nPausanias, who knew nothing of him, wrongly connected his statue with\r\nthe younger one of that name.[2562]\r\n\r\n3. Isokrates, son of Theodoros, of Athens. The pseudo-Plutarch mentions\r\na bronze statue of Isokrates, in the form of a παῖς κελητίζων, on the\r\nAthenian Akropolis.[2563] As the orator was born in 436 B. C., his\r\nyouthful victory among the horse-racers must have occurred about 420 B.\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS.\r\n\r\nWe have found, then, from the literary sources examined, that there\r\nare at least 44 Olympic victors, to whom a total of 47 monuments were\r\nerected outside Olympia.[2564] These monuments were of various kinds—1\r\ninscribed tablet, 1 Pindaric ode engrossed on a temple wall, 3 temples\r\nor shrines, 37 statues (one of them apparently iconic), bronze horses\r\n(? quadriga), and 4 dedications which are not further described. Thus\r\nthe bulk of these monuments, as of those at Olympia, consisted of\r\nstatues. Of the 29 monuments erected to 27 victors in the pre-Christian\r\ncenturies, 3 were dedicated in the seventh,[2565] 4 in the sixth,\r\n13 (to 11 victors) in the fifth, 1 in the fifth or fourth, 6 in the\r\nfourth,[2566] 1 in the fourth or third, and 1 in the third. There is\r\nno record of such a dedication in the second and first centuries B.\r\nC. Of the 14 monuments erected to 13 victors known to belong to the\r\npost-Christian centuries, 4 (to 3 victors) belong to the first, 5 to\r\nthe second, 3 to the third and 2 to the fourth; 4 others were set up\r\nto 4 victors whose dates can not be determined. Of other monuments\r\nmentioned (though not included in our figures) 3 may or may not have\r\nbeen erected to Olympic victors. We find that the greatest number of\r\ndedications was made in the fifth century B. C., just as we found was\r\nthe case in regard to those at Olympia.[2567] Of these victors, 10 also\r\nhad monuments at Olympia. The total number of Olympic victor monuments,\r\ntherefore, at Olympia and elsewhere of which we have record, amounts to\r\n302.[2568]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF OLYMPIC VICTOR STATUARIES.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we shall briefly summarize the number and dates of the\r\nsculptors of Olympic victor monuments who are known to us from all\r\nsources.[2569] Pausanias names 52 such sculptors, who made 102 of the\r\n192 monuments listed by him. Of the 42 “honor” statues erected in the\r\nAltis to 35 men, Pausanias mentions only two sculptors, Lysippos, who\r\nalso appears among the victor statuaries, and Mikon of Syracuse, who\r\ndoes not.[2570] Pliny names 24, or nearly one-half of the athlete\r\nsculptors mentioned by Pausanias.[2571] No new name of an artist\r\nappears either on the inscribed bases found at Olympia and referred\r\nto the monuments recorded by Pausanias, or on the 63 bases discovered\r\nthere, which can not be so referred. Of the 52 sculptors known to us\r\nfrom Pausanias and inscriptions, the dates can be assigned definitely\r\nor approximately thus: of the seventh century B. C., none; of the\r\nsixth century B. C., second half, 2; end, 2; of the end of the sixth\r\nand beginning of the fifth centuries B. C., 1; of the fifth century B.\r\nC., first half, 9; middle, 4; second half, 3; end, 2; of the fourth\r\ncentury B. C., first half, 11; middle, 1; second half, 2; end, 3; of\r\nthe end of the fourth and beginning of the third centuries B. C., 3;\r\nof the third century B. C., first half, 1; second half, 1; end, 2; of\r\nthe end of the third and beginning of the second centuries B. C., 1;\r\nof the second century B. C., first half, 2. No sculptor is named who\r\nlived certainly later than the second century B. C. In addition to\r\nthese results, 1 sculptor can be assigned only roughly to the period\r\nsubsequent to Alexander the Great, and the epoch of still another\r\ncan not be determined. Of the 37 statues listed above as erected to\r\nOlympic victors outside Olympia—_i. e.>/i>, the major portion of the\r\nwhole number of 47 monuments of various sorts set up in honor of 44\r\nvictors—the names of only four artists are known. Three of these—Myron,\r\nPythagoras of Rhegion, and Lysippos—also worked at Olympia. The name,\r\ntherefore, of only one new sculptor, Kaphisias of Bœotia, who lived\r\nin the fourth century B. C., can be added from this source, which makes\r\nthe grand total of victor statuaries known to us 53.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN A\r\n\r\n  THE ALTIS AT OLYMPIA\r\n  IN THE GREEK PERIOD\r\n  (THIRD CENTURY B.

However, the charioteers painted white on\r\nfrescoes discovered at Tiryns in 1910, which represent a boar hunt\r\n(see Rodenwaldt, _A. M._, XXXVI, 1911, pp. 198 f. and fig. 2, p. 201,\r\nrestored; see also _Tiryns_, II, Pl. XII, in color) are regarded by\r\nHall as youths and not women. He remarks that in Egypt young princes,\r\nwho led the “sheltered life,” were often represented on monuments as\r\npale, though red was the more usual color: see Hall, _op. cit._, p. 58\r\nand n. 1; _id._, _Aegean Archæology_, 1914, p. 190 and fig. 74 on p.\r\n192.

Though discovered in 1889\r\nin a bee-hive tomb near Sparta, these famous cups are obviously\r\nimportations from Crete, the work of an artist of the late Minoan I\r\nperiod. Similarly, the lion-hunt on the dagger-blade from Mycenæ is\r\nakin to Cretan art, if not its product. These cups have been often\r\npictured: _e. g._, _Arch. Eph._, 1889, Pl. IX; Schuchhardt, Pl. III\r\n(App., pp. 350 f.); _B. C. H._, IV, 1891, Pls. XI-XII (in color),\r\nXIII-XIV; Tsountas-Manatt, _op. cit._, pp. 227-8, figs. 113-114;\r\nPerrot-Chipiez, VI, Pl.

Breasted, _Ancient\r\nTimes_, 1916, fig. 140, opp. p. 234.\r\n\r\n[17] This interpretation of the scene has been compared with the design\r\nof a lion and goat on the short sword-blade from the chieftain’s\r\ngrave at Knossos: see Burrows, _op. cit._, p. 88 and _cf._ pp. 136-7.\r\nHere there are two successive scenes; first the agrimi (wild goat) is\r\nstartled and springs away; then the lion is represented triumphant at\r\nthe end of the chase with one paw on the beast’s hind quarter and the\r\nother raised to strike: see Evans, _Prehistoric Tombs of Knossos_,\r\n1906, p. 57, fig. 59; _cf._ also bronze inlaid dagger-blade from\r\nMycenæ, showing hunting scenes on each face; Perrot-Chipiez, VI, Pl.\r\nXVII, 1 (panther hunting wild ducks, in color), XVIII, 3-4, (lion-hunt\r\nby men and lions chasing gazelles, in color); _cf._ Tsountas-Manatt,\r\n_op. cit._, pp. 200-2; Springer-Michaelis, Pl.

The same word occurs also\r\nin an inscription on a late relief from Smyrna, which shows horsemen\r\npursuing bulls, leaping on their backs and seizing their horns; _C. I.\r\nG._, II, 3212; also in an inscription from Sinope: _ibid._, III, 4157\r\n(line 5); an inscription from Aphrodisias calls such men ταυροκαθάπται;\r\n_ibid._, II, Add., 2759b. The evidence shows that Gardiner, p. 9, n.\r\n2, is wrong in connecting the _taurokathapsia_ with the hunting-field\r\ninstead of with the circus. He cites the Smyrna relief above mentioned\r\n(in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, no. 219), which, however, should\r\nbe interpreted as an acrobatic scene. See J. Baunack, _Rhein. Mus._,\r\nXXXVIII, 1883, pp. 293 f., who discusses bull-fighting in Thessaly and\r\nRome and quotes five inscriptions of Hellenic times to show that beast\r\nfights were common in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[20] _Cf._ Mosso, _op. cit._, pp. 214-215.\r\n\r\n[21] Iliad, XVIII, 605-6 (= Od., IV, 18-19).\r\n\r\n[22] Iliad, XVI, 742-50.\r\n\r\n[23] Hdt., VI, 129.\r\n\r\n[24] No. 243; see Salzmann, _Le Nécropole de Cameiros_, Pl.

In this respect it should be compared with\r\nthe relief on the archaic (sixth-century B. C.)

The acrobat wears just\r\nsuch striped boots and bracelets as the man and women on the fresco\r\nfrom Knossos. The man binding the legs of the bull on the Vapheio\r\ncup wears similar apparel. Similar scenes of gymnasts vaulting over\r\na bull’s back are seen on the seal of a bracelet found at Knossos in\r\n1902: _B. S.

II, III (one from Klazomenai).\r\n\r\n[39] The true _hoplomachia_ described by Homer and later\r\npractised by the Mantineans and Kyreneans (_cf._ Athenæus, IV, 41, p.\r\n154) should not be confounded, as Gardiner, p. 21, n. 3, remarks, with\r\nthe later competition of the same name held at the Athenian _Theseia_\r\nand taught in the gymnasia, which was a purely military exercise like\r\nfencing: Plato, _Laches_, 182B and _passim_; _Gorgias_, 456D; _de\r\nLeg._, 833E; _cf._ Dar.-Sagl., _s. v._ _Hoplomachia_.\r\n\r\n[40] _E. g._, Leaf, in his _Companion to the Iliad_, 1892, p.\r\n380; _id._, _The Iliad_, II, p. 417, note on line 621.\r\n\r\n[41] Iliad, XXIII, 634 f.; _ibid._, 621-3, where Achilles\r\ngives Nestor a prize because he will never again be able to contend in\r\nboxing, wrestling, hurling the javelin, or running. In Od., VIII, 103\r\nand 128, leaping is substituted for chariot-racing.\r\n\r\n[42] _E. g._, Iliad, XXII, 163-4: “The great prize ... of a\r\nman that is dead”; XXIII, 630 f., where Nestor recalls victories in the\r\ngames held by the Epeians at Bouprasion in Elis at the funeral of the\r\nlocal hero Amarynkeus. Bouprasion is also mentioned in Iliad, XI, 756,\r\nin Nestor’s story of the war between the Pylians and Epeians and of\r\nthe war waged by his father Neleus on Augeas, for stealing four horses\r\nwhich had been sent to Elis to contend for a tripod.\r\n\r\n[43] Examples of panegyric games in honor of gods are found\r\nalso in the Homeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo, I, 146 f.; in Pindar,\r\n_Ol._, IX. 6 (Zeus); P., VIII, 2.1 (Zeus) and schol.; and Hdt., I, 144\r\n(Apollo) and schol.; etc.\r\n\r\n[44] P., VIII, 4.5. For other examples of funeral games, see\r\nreferences in Krause, p. 9, n. 3. He also shows that musical contests\r\nwere funerary in character.\r\n\r\n[45] The scholiast on Pindar, _Nem._, Argum., Boeckh, p. 424\r\nB, and _Isthm._, Argum., p. 514, calls the Nemean and Isthmian games\r\nfunerary; Clem. Alex., _Protrept._, Ch. II, 34, 29 P. (quoted by\r\nEusebios, _Praep. evang._, II, 6, 72 b. c.) says that all four great\r\ngames were funerary in origin.\r\n\r\n[46] P., I., 44.8; Clem.

The _Pythia_ were reorganized by the\r\nAmphictyons as a funeral contest in honor of the soldiers who fell in\r\nthe first Sacred War.\r\n\r\n[49] _Cf._ P., V, 13.1-2; Clem.

According to Pindar,\r\n_ll. cc._ and the scholiast on _Ol._, II, 2, 5, and 7, Boeckh, pp.\r\n58-9, Herakles, the son of Zeus, instituted the games in honor of\r\nZeus; but Statius, _Theb._, VI, 5 f., Solinus, I, 28 (ed. Mommsen),\r\nHyg., _Fab._, 273. Clem. Alex., _Strom._, I, Ch. 21, 137, say it was\r\nin honor of Pelops. On the traditional connection of Herakles with\r\nOlympia, see E. Curtius, _Abh. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. zu Berlin,\r\nphilos.-histor. Kl._, 1894, pp. 1098 f.; Busolt, _Griech. Gesch_^2,\r\n1893, I, pp. 240 f.

Since the simple theory\r\nof the origin of the Olympic Festival in the funeral games in honor\r\nof Pelops does not explain all the legends of the games nor all the\r\npeculiar customs of the festival, and because of the inadequate\r\ncharacter of the literary evidence (the earliest mention of it being a\r\nDelphic oracle quoted by Phlegon, _F. H. G._, p. 604; _cf._ Clem. Alex.,\r\n_Protrept_, II, 34, p. 29), it has been attacked by F. M. Cornford\r\n(in Miss Harrison’s _Themis_, pp. 212 f.) and others. These scholars\r\nhave tried to find the origin of the Olympic games rather in a ritual\r\ncontest of succession to the throne, the honors extended to a victor\r\nbeing held to prove his kingly or divine character. The theory was\r\nfirst proposed by A. B. Cook, The European Sky God, _Folk Lore_, 1904,\r\nand has recently been elaborated by Frazer in his _Golden Bough_,^3\r\nIII, pp. 89 f., who has attempted to harmonize it with his earlier\r\nfuneral theory. The inadequacy of the newer theory has been shown by E.\r\nN. Gardiner, The Alleged Kingship of the Olympic Victor, _B. S. A._,\r\nXXII, 1916-18, pp. 85 f. For a review of his paper, see also _J.

The description of the throne (P., III,\r\n18.9 f; _cf._ Apollodoros, I, 9.28) is merely summary, as Pausanias\r\nonly mentions the games represented on it without describing them in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n[69] The best reconstruction of the scenes on the chest is by\r\nH.

C., and must have been dedicated before 586-5 B.\r\nC., when the Kypselid dynasty ended at Corinth; see Busolt, _Griech.\r\nGesch._,^2 I, pp. 638 and 657. However, the chest at Olympia had\r\nnothing to do with the legendary one, but was merely a richly decorated\r\noffering to the gods, the work of a Corinthian artist of the end of the\r\nseventh or beginning of the sixth century B.

Dar.-Sagl., IV, i, pp. 194 f.,\r\nlist 34 local _Olympia_. Most of these lesser _Olympia_ are known to us\r\nonly from inscriptions and coins. Peisistratos appears to have founded\r\nannual _Olympia_ at Athens, when he began to build the Olympieion;\r\nPindar seems to allude to them in _Nem._ II, 23 (_cf._ schol. _ad\r\nloc._); they were reorganized magnificently by Hadrian in A. D. 131;\r\nSpartianus, _Vit. Hadriani_, 13. _Cf._ Gardiner, p. 229.\r\n\r\n[78] Lysias, _Paneg._, notes this fact, when he says that\r\nHerakles restored peace and unity by instituting the games. Pausanias\r\nspeaks similarly of the restoration of the games by Iphitos and\r\nLykourgos: V, 4.5 f.\r\n\r\n[79] P., V, 1.3; 3.6; Strabo, VIII, 3.33 (C.357).\r\n\r\n[80] The decree governing the festival was inscribed on a\r\ndiskos, which dates probably from the seventh century B. C., and was\r\npreserved in the Heraion down to the time of Pausanias. On it the names\r\nof Iphitos and Lykourgos were legible down to Aristotle’s day: P., V,\r\n20.1; Plut., _Lycurgus_, I. 1. Phlegon, _F. H. G._, III, p. 602, and a\r\nscholion on Plato, _de Rep._, 465 D, mention Kleosthenes; _cf._ Louis\r\nDyer, _Harvard Classical Studies_, 1908, pp. 40 f.; Gardiner, p. 43, n.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[81] For a discussion of the sources and history of this\r\nregister, originally compiled near the end of the fifth century B. C.\r\nby Hippias of Elis (Plut., _Numa_, I, 4; _cf._ Mahaffy, _J. H.

From it a complete list of stade-runners\r\nwas copied by the church-historian Eusebios from Africanus, who had\r\nbrought it down to 217 A. D.\r\n\r\n[82] V, 8.6.\r\n\r\n[83] Mentioned by P., V, 4.6 and elsewhere; for the mythical\r\naccount see P., V, 7.6-8.5 (from Herakles to Oxylos); V, 8.5, and V,\r\n9.4 (revived under the presidency of Iphitos and the descendants of\r\nOxylos). Phlegon, _F. H. G._, III, p. 603, says that the games were\r\ndiscontinued for 28 Olympiads from the time of Herakles and Pelops\r\nto that of Koroibos. Velleius Paterculus, I, 8 (ed. Halm), dates the\r\nrevival under Iphitos, 793 B. C. Strabo, quoting Ephoros, says that\r\nthe Achæans controlled Olympia to the time of Oxylos; for his mythical\r\naccount of the games, see VIII, 3.33 (C. 357). On presidents of the\r\ngames being elected from the Eleans, see P., V, 9.4-6.\r\n\r\n[84] Especially by Xenophon, _Hell._, III, 2.31; VII, 4.28.\r\nPausanias omits all evidence of the part played by Kleosthenes in the\r\ntruce. See Gardiner, pp. 44 f.\r\n\r\n[85] See Doerpfeld, _A. M._, XXXIII, 1908, pp. 185 f.\r\n\r\n[86] Recently E. N. Gardiner has argued that the worship of\r\nZeus came directly from Dodona to Olympia before it had reached Crete\r\nand that Cretan elements in the cult first appear at Olympia in the\r\nVIII century B. C. He believes that the worship of Hera reached Olympia\r\nfrom Argos later than that of Zeus, toward the end of the VIII century\r\nB. C., when he supposes the Heraion was built as a joint temple to both\r\ndeities; _B. S. A._, XXII, 1916-18, pp. 85-86.\r\n\r\n[87] On his cult see P., V, 13.2, and scholion on Pindar,\r\n_Ol._ I, 146 and 149, Boeckh, p. 43. After being reduced to the rank\r\nof hero, Pelops still kept his own precinct in the Altis throughout\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n[88] On the history of Olympia, see Gardiner, pp. 38 f.\r\n\r\n[89] For the legends connected with the origin of the three,\r\nsee Krause, _Die Pythien, Nemeen und Isthmien_, and the various\r\narticles in Dar.-Sagl.\r\n\r\n[90] Schol. on Pindar, _Pyth._, Argum., Boeckh, p. 298.\r\n\r\n[91] On the Sacred or Krisaian War (590 B. C.), see Bury,\r\n_History of Greece_, 1913, pp. 158-9. The first Pythiad was reckoned\r\nfrom 586 (not from 582 as Bury and others state): see Frazer, V, p.\r\n244; Boeckh, _Explic. ad Pind._, _Ol._, XII, pp. 206 f.\r\n\r\n[92] See Strabo, IX, 3.10, (C. 421); P., X, 7.4-5; schol. on\r\nPind., _Pyth._, Argum., Boeckh, p. 298.

On the Pythian games, see Gardiner, pp. 208 f.\r\n\r\n[93] On the Nemean games, see Gardiner, pp. 223-6. As no\r\nproper excavations have been made on the site, our knowledge of the\r\ngames is confined almost entirely to literary evidence.\r\n\r\n[94] P., II, 15.3, and VI, 16.4, mentions a winter\r\ncelebration. The scholiast on Pindar’s _Nem._, Argum., Boeckh, pp.\r\n424-5, says that it was a τριετής held on the 12th of the month\r\nPanemos, and so it was a summer and not a winter celebration. On\r\ntheories of two celebrations, see Frazer, II, pp. 92-3.\r\n\r\n[95] They were not held in midsummer as some have maintained:\r\nsee Thukyd., VIII, 9-10; Unger, _Philologus_, XXXVII, 1877, 1-42;\r\nNissen, _Rhein.

Ol._, 173; he won sometime between\r\nOls. (?) 115 and 125 (= 320 and 280 B. C.): Hyde, 140; Foerster, 757\r\n(undated). Since Pausanias mentions this as a remarkable record, we\r\nshould suspect his statement that the boy runner Damiskos of Messene\r\nwas but twelve when he won the stade-race: VI, 2.10; he won Ol. 103 (=\r\n368 B. C.): Afr.; Hyde, 20; Foerster, 343. Another victor, of unknown\r\ndate, Nikasylos of Rhodes, was disqualified when eighteen years old\r\nfrom entering the boys’ wrestling match because of his age, and so\r\nentered that of the men: P., VI, 14.1-2; Hyde, 125; Foerster, 787. He\r\ndied at twenty. Such inconsistencies in Pausanias’ account show that\r\nthe Hellanodikai exercised some discretion in their judgment, taking\r\ninto consideration not merely age, but size and strength.\r\n\r\n[315] On maintenance at the Prytaneion, see Plato, _de Rep._,\r\nV, 465 D; _Apology_, 36 D; Plut., _Aristeides_, 27; Athenæus, VI, 32\r\n(p. 237, quoting Timokles), and X, 6 (p. 414, quoting Xenophanes);\r\nR.

He concludes that\r\nthis honor was given to Athenian victors only in the chariot-race\r\nat Olympia, and in gymnic contests at the other great games.

I. A._, II, 3, 1301, and in that of\r\na Panathenaic victor, _ibid._, 1302. The presence of the word in an\r\nAthenian inscription referring to the Olympic victor Kallias rests on\r\nan uncertain restoration; _ibid._, I, 419; he won Ol. 77 (= 472 B.

Again he speaks of the “chariot and statue\r\nof Gelo”: VI, 9.4-5; in referring to the chariot of Kleosthenes by\r\nHagelaïdas he says: “Along with the statue of the chariot and horses,\r\nhe [Kleosthenes] dedicated statues of himself and the charioteer,” and\r\neven adds the names of the horses: VI, 10.6. In VI, 18.1, he mentions\r\nthe group of Kratisthenes as “the chariot, Nike mounting it, and\r\nKratisthenes”; in VI, 16.6 he speaks of “a small chariot and figure\r\nof the father of Polypeithes, the wrestler Kalliteles”; etc. _Cf._\r\nDittenberger, _op. cit._, pp. 239-40.\r\n\r\n[389] He won in Ol. 255 (= 241 A.

Deinosthenes, who won the\r\nstade-race in Ol. 116 (= 316 B.

He shows that Augustus\r\nonly followed a long-established precedent. Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV,\r\n36, in speaking of the great number of statues plundered from Greece\r\nby Mummius and the Luculli, quotes G. Licinius Mucianus (three times\r\nconsul), who died before 77 B. C., to the effect that 73,000 statues\r\nwere still to be seen at Rhodes in his time, and that supposably as\r\nmany more were yet to be found in Athens, Olympia, and Delphi.\r\n\r\n[417] At the beginning of his description of Elis (V, 1.2), Pausanias\r\nsays that 217 years had passed since the restoration of Corinth. As\r\nthat event fell in 44 B. C., he was writing his fifth book in 174 A.\r\nD., _i. e._, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. With this date other\r\nchronological references in his work agree. That the fifth book was\r\nwritten before the sixth is deduced from a comparison of V, 14.6\r\nwith VI, 22.8 f. Though the sixth book, therefore, can not have been\r\ncomposed earlier than 174 A. D., it may, of course, have been written\r\nmuch later. On the dates of the various books, see Frazer, I, pp. xv\r\nf. On the great importance of Pausanias for the whole history of Greek\r\nart, see C. Robert, _Pausanias als Schriftsteller_, 1909, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[418] _Historia naturalis_, Bks. XXXIV-XXXVI (ed.

The Solonian cubit of 444 mm. gives 17.53\r\ninches, the finger .73 inch, which makes Diagoros’ statue 6 feet 1.75\r\ninches tall.Though the cubit was later lengthened to about 2 feet,\r\nthe old size was retained for measuring wood and stone: _cf._ Boeckh,\r\n_Metrologische Untersuchungen_, 1838, p. 212.\r\n\r\n[429] Scherer, p. 11, gave its height as 6 feet and 5 inches.\r\n\r\n[430] Diagoras won in Ol. 79 (= 464 B.

Isidoros, in a confused passage, _Orig._, XVIII, 17.2,\r\nsays that athletes were early girded and dropped the loin-cloth in\r\nconsequence of a runner getting weary, whence a decree of the time of\r\nthe archon Hippomenes at Athens (Ol. 14.2) allowed athletes to contend\r\nnude; the same story is told in the _Schol.

Here the historian is speaking of athletes in general;\r\nDionysios, VII, 72 and P., I, 44.1, speak only of runners.\r\n\r\nScherer, p. 20, n. 1 (following Krause, I, pp. 405 and 501, n. 18)\r\nthought that the words of Thukydides (τὸ δὲ πάλαι) referred to the\r\ntime antedating Ol. 15, and not later, and concluded that in wrestling\r\n(introduced in Ol. 18 = 708 B. C.) and boxing (introduced in Ol. 23 =\r\n688 B. C.) the contestants were always nude. Boeckh, however, rightly\r\nconcluded that the historian meant that in Ol. 15 only the runners laid\r\noff the loin-cloth, while other athletes did so just before his day:\r\n_C. I.

He says that the custom of nudity was\r\nintroduced first by the Cretans and then by the Spartans.\r\n\r\n[453] Thus von Mach says (p. 240): “They were dedicatory statues\r\nrepresenting events that had taken place in honor of the gods,” and\r\nadds that on such occasions persons were draped, except where such\r\ndrapery would cause inconvenience, _i. e._, in gymnastic contests.\r\n\r\n[454] See Gardiner, p. 465, fig. 172.\r\n\r\n[455] _E. g._, the statue in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome:\r\nHelbig, _Fuehrer_, II, no. 973 (fig. 29, p. 557, restored); _Guide_,\r\n597 (fig. 28); Joubin, p. 134, fig. 40; Reinach, _Rép._, II, 2, 536.6;\r\n_B. Com. Rom._, XVI, 1888, Pls. XV, XVI, 1, 2, (two views) and XVIII\r\n(restored), pp. 335-365 (G. Ghirardini).\r\n\r\n[456] Pollux, III, 155, wrongly states that runners wore soft leathern\r\nboots (ἐνδρομίδες); these never appear on vases, as Krause, I, p. 362\r\nand n. 5, and Gardiner, p. 273, point out, and were the usual footwear\r\nof messengers. _Cf._ Mueller, _Arch. d. Kunst_, §363, 6.\r\n\r\n[457] At Ephesos in Thukydides’ day: III, 104; earlier on Delos:\r\nThukyd., _ibid._, and Homeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo, 146 f. Maidens\r\nand youths wrestled in the gymnasia on Chios: Athenæus, XIII, 20 (p.\r\n566 e.); _cf._ Boeckh, _C. I. G._, II, text to no. 2214.\r\n\r\n[458] On athletic contests for women in Sparta, see Plutarch,\r\n_Lykourgos_, 14; Xen., _de Rep. lac._, I, 4. Aristoph., _Lysistr._, 80\r\nf., says that the beauty and color of the Lakonian woman Lampito came\r\nfrom gymnastic exercises.\r\n\r\n[459] P., V, 6.7. He says that those who broke the Elean rule were\r\nthrown from Mount Typaion (a rock south of the river). Their exclusion\r\nwas doubtless due to a religious taboo and not to modesty; Gardiner, p.\r\n47. P., VI, 20.9, says that the restriction did not include maidens.\r\nAs there is no other reference about unmarried girls at Olympia, it is\r\nprobable that girls were not admitted; _cf._ Krause, _Olympia_, p. 54\r\nand n. 9.\r\n\r\n[460] _E. g._, Kyniska, P., VI, 1.6, and other Spartan victresses, III,\r\n8.1; Euryleonis, who won in a two-horse chariot-race in Ol. (?) 103\r\n(= 368 B. C.): P., III, 17.6; Foerster, 344; Belistiche, mistress of\r\nPtolemy Philadelphus, was the first to win συνωρίδι πώλων in Ol. 129 (=\r\n264 B. C.): P., V, 8.11; Foerster, 443; Theodota, daughter of the Elean\r\nAntiphanes, won ἅρματι πωλικῷ in the first century B. C.: _Inschr. v.\r\nOl._, 203; Foerster, 547.\r\n\r\n[461] P., VI, 20.9. The inscribed marble base of a statue of one of\r\nthese priestesses has been found at Olympia: see _Inschr. v. Ol._, 485.\r\n\r\n[462] See P., V, 6.7-8.\r\n\r\n[463] However, we do not know if they were held in the same year as\r\nthat of the Olympic festival, or at what time of the year. See L.\r\nWeniger, _Klio, Beitraege zur alten Geschichte_, V, 1905, pp. 22 f.\r\n\r\n[464] P., V, 162-4. These πίνακες were probably iconic (portrait)\r\npaintings. Holes have been found on columns of the Heraion to which\r\nthey may have been attached. On the girls’ race, see B. B., text to no.\r\n521 (Arndt).\r\n\r\n[465] It is a marble copy of an original bronze which is generally\r\ndated about 470 B. C., because of archaic reminiscences in the head.\r\nIt represents a girl of about 14 years. See Helbig, _Fuehrer_, I,\r\nno. 364; _Guide_, 378, and references; F. W., 213; Bulle, pp. 304 f.\r\nOverbeck, II, p. 475, refers it to the school of Pasiteles. It is\r\npictured in B. B., no. 521; Bulle, 142; Baum., III, p. 2111, fig. 2362;\r\nSpringer-Michaelis, p. 224, fig. 412; von Mach, 73; Amelung, _Museums\r\nof Rome_, I, fig. 74; Reinach, _Rép._, I, 527.6; Clarac, Pl. 864, 2199.\r\nA similar statue is the torso in Berlin: _Beschr. der Skulpt._, no.\r\n229; and _cf._ Kekulé, _Annali_, XXXVI, 1865, p. 66 (who points out the\r\nresemblance of the head of the Vatican statue to that of the figure by\r\nStephanos, Pl. 12); Clarac, Pl. 864, 2200. The height of the Vatican\r\nstatue is given by Bulle as 1.56 meters. _Cf._ also a statuette of a\r\nsimilar girl runner from Dodona: Rayet, I, Pl. 17, 3.\r\n\r\n[466] However, B. Schroeder believes that it is merely a victorious\r\ndanseuse, and gives several examples of dancers from vase-paintings and\r\nthe lesser arts: _R. M._, XXIV, 1909, pp. 109 ff. (figs. 1-3). In all\r\nof these lively motion is expressed and the free foot is raised high\r\nfrom the ground. When the curious little plat under the statue’s right\r\nfoot (perhaps intended to represent the starting-stone at the stadion)\r\nis removed, the position of the statue does not fit the dance; see\r\nBulle, p. 304, for discussion of this starting-stone.\r\n\r\n[467] VIII, 48.2; _cf._ Plut., _Quaest. conviv._, VIII, 4, I, (p. 982).\r\n\r\n[468] Bulle compares it with the Tuebingen hoplite-runner (Fig. 42)\r\nready to start, though the quieter pose of the Vatican statue befits a\r\ngirl rather than the impetuous energy of the man.\r\n\r\n[469] On the Διονυσίαδες, see P., III, 13.7; Hesychios, _s. v._; _cf._\r\nTheokr., XVIII, 22; Plut., _Lycurgus_, 14; Pauly-Wissowa, _s. v._\r\n_agones_, I, p. 847; Reisch, p. 46, n. 4. Pauly-Wissowa, _s. v._ χιτών\r\n(III, 2, p. 2314) shows that the use of the chiton closed on one side\r\nwas a Dorian, and especially a Spartan, custom.\r\n\r\n[470] On the running race at Kyrene, _cf._ Boeckh, _Explic. ad Pind._,\r\n_Pyth._, IX, p. 328. Plato, in his _de Leg._, VIII, 833, D, E, ordained\r\nfor girls the three running races (στάδιον, δίαυλος, and δόλιχος); the\r\nyoungest girls should run nude, the others (from 13 to 18) suitably\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\n[471] Suet., _Domitian_, 4; Dio Cassius, LXVII, 8.\r\n\r\n[472] Arndt believes it is Myronian in character: B.

The Latin of the last\r\nportion of this passage runs: _Olympiae, ubi omnium qui vicissent\r\nstatuas dicari mos erat, eorum vero qui ter ibi superavissent ex\r\nmembris ipsorum similitudine expressa, quas iconicas vocant._\r\n\r\n[503] Hirt, _Ueber das Bildniss der Alten_, 1814-15, p. 7; Visconti,\r\n_Iconographie grecque_ (1st ed.

They argued from Lucian’s _pro Imag._, 11, a\r\npassage already discussed _supra_, p. 45 and n. 3.\r\n\r\n[504] Scherer, pp. 9 f., and especially p. 13; Lessing, _Laokoön_, II,\r\n13, made Pliny’s words a text for a famous passage.\r\n\r\n[505] For the latest discussion of Pliny’s passage, see _Inschr. v.\r\nOl._, pp. 236 and 295-6 (the latter in reference to the inscribed base\r\nof the statue of Xenombrotos to be discussed a few lines _infra_).\r\n\r\n[506] Klein, quoted by Jex-Blake, p. 14, footnote to line 7, believes\r\nPliny’s statement apocryphal, an idea escaping all scholars except,\r\nperhaps, Bluemner in his commentary on the _Laokoön_ (p. 503).\r\nEvidently Pliny, or his source, is explaining the discrepancy between\r\nideal and portrait statues as the result of an improbable rule, since\r\nthe ancients applied little historical criticism to art, and hence did\r\nnot distinguish between works representing types and those representing\r\nindividuals. Dio Chrysostom, in his treatise Περὶ κάλλους (_Orat._,\r\nXXI, 1, p. 501 R), tries to explain the difference between early and\r\nlate statues on the ground of physical degeneration in the latter.\r\n\r\n[507] _Inschr. v. Ol_, 170. He won in Ol. (?) 83 (= 448 B. C.): P.,\r\nVI, 14.12; Hyde, 133; Foerster, 327. This date follows the reasoning\r\nof Robert, _O. S._, pp. 180 f. Pausanias, _l. c._, mentions another\r\nmonument of the victor, the inscribed base of which has been found:\r\n_Inschr. v. Ol._, 154, though Dittenberger wrongly refers it to\r\nDamasippos: Foerster, 812; Hyde, pp. 53-4. The same authority refers\r\nno. 170 to the middle of the fourth century B. C., or a couple\r\nof decades later, because of the lettering and orthography. The\r\nmonument of no. 170 must, therefore, have been set up long after the\r\nvictory—about a century later.\r\n\r\n[508] Dittenberger, _Inschr. v. Ol._, p. 296, compares two other\r\ninscriptions with no. 170, viz, no. 174 (in which the words ὧδε στάς\r\noccur) and _C. I. G. G. S._, I, 2470, l. 3 (where the words τοίας ἐκ\r\nπροβολᾶς occur). However, as he says, these two refer to the poses\r\nof the statues of gymnic victors and not to portraits. Pausanias\r\nfrequently uses the word εἰκών for ἀνδριάς (_e. g._, III, 18.7) of a\r\nvictor, but this seems to be no indication of a portrait statue.\r\n\r\n[509] _Cf._ Dittenberger, _op. cit._, p. 296. Hitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, p.\r\n530, think the case of Xenombrotos may simply be exceptional.\r\n\r\n[510] VI, 3.11-12; he was three times victor in running races in Ols.\r\n(?) 95, (?) 97, and 99 (= 400, 392, 384 B.

We can not say that his victories fell at a date when\r\niconic statues were in vogue.\r\n\r\n[514] VI, 6.6; he won in Ols. 74, 76, 77 (= 484, 476-2 B.

However, Hitz.-Bluemn., I, p. 307,\r\n_ad loc._ Paus., think that the word ἀνδριάς used by Pausanias can not\r\napply to a terminal bust; Furtw., _Mp._, p. 117, n. 4, says that the\r\nword does not necessarily mean a whole statue. _Cf._ Bernouilli, _Jb._,\r\nXI, 1896, pp. 107 f.; Furtw., _Mp._, pp. 117 f.\r\n\r\n[519] See _I.

The latter gives\r\nseveral examples of similarly shortened forms of names and believes the\r\npassage in Xenophon emphasizes the fact that Polykleitos was employed\r\nat Athens. Plato frequently mentions Polykleitos by his full name: _e.\r\ng._, _Protag._, 328 C (sons of Polykleitos), 311 C (Polykleitos and\r\nPheidias). P.

He shows that Cicero’s\r\nreferences to art proceed from his instinct as a stylist and not from\r\nany enthusiasm for art itself.\r\n\r\n[551] _Imag._, 6, p. 464. His eclectic statue is made up of works by\r\nPraxiteles, Alkamenes, Pheidias, and Kalamis.\r\n\r\n[552] _Rhetorum praeceptor_, 9-10.

Vitruvius, _de Arch._, I, 2, makes\r\nsymmetry in architecture a quality of _eurythmia: Item symmetria est ex\r\nipsius operis membris conveniens consensus ex partibusque separatis ad\r\nuniversae figurae speciem ratae partis responsus_.\r\n\r\n[577] I, 2: _Haec [eurythmia] efficitur, cum membra operis convenientia\r\nsunt, altitudinis ad latitudinem, latitudinis ad longitudinem, et ad\r\nsummam omnia respondent suae symmetriae_; _cf._ III, 1; Lucian, _pro\r\nImag._, 14 (ῥυθμίζειν τὸ ἄγαλμα); Clem.

Brunn, Ueber tektonischen Styl in der griech. Plastik\r\nund Malerei, in _Sitzb. Muen. Akad._, 1883, pp. 299 f., 1884, pp. 507\r\nf. Overbeck, I, pp. 266-277, explains rhythm in art as the _Ordnung\r\nder Bewegung_, in accordance with the definition of Plato: τῇ δὴ τῆς\r\nκινήσεως τάξει ῥυθμὸς ὄνομα εἴη: _de Leg._, 665 A.\r\n\r\n[584] _H. N._, XXXIV, 58 (S. Q., 533): _Numerosior in arte quam\r\nPolyclitus et in symmetria diligentior_. The interpretation of this\r\ndisputed passage depends, of course, on the meaning of _numerosior_,\r\nand whether we accept the curious statement of the manuscript that\r\nMyron surpassed Poykleitos in symmetry, or, by omitting the _et_\r\n(with Sillig), make it mean just the contrary and in harmony with the\r\nusual ancient view that symmetry was the salient characteristic of\r\nPolykleitan art. The passage, then, would contrast the symmetry of\r\nPolykleitos with the variety of Myron. This accords with Pliny’s use of\r\n_numerosus_ elsewhere (_e. g._, XXXV, 130 and 138), which always refers\r\nto number. See Gardner, _Hbk._, p. 275 (note).\r\n\r\n[585] _Op. cit._, XXXIV, 65, he says: _Nova intactaque ratione\r\nquadratas veterum staturas permutando_.\r\n\r\n[586] _Op. cit._, XXXV, 67.\r\n\r\n[587] VIII.

See Lepsius, _Monum. funéraires de l’Égypte_ (figure,\r\nreproduced in Dar.-Sagl, I, 2, p. 892, fig. 1125); _cf._ his _Descript.\r\nde l’Égypte_, IV, LXII; Wilkinson, _History of Egypt_, p. 113, Pl. IV;\r\nthese references are given by Foat, _op. cit._, p. 225, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[589] Vitruv., I, 2. However, in thus following the statement of the\r\nRoman architect, it must be said that the attempt to recover and\r\nestablish such a canon in Greek architecture is still unproved. The\r\nsubject is complicated and has led to very different views. Thus,\r\nwhile many scholars have defended the theory of the canon (_e. g._,\r\nPennethorne, _Geom. and Optics of Anc. Arch._, 1878; Penrose, in\r\nWhibley, _Comp. to Gk. Stud._^1, 1905, pp. 220-1; Ferguson, _Hist.\r\nArch._, ed. 1887, I, p. 251; P. Gardner, _Princ. Gk. Art._, p. 21;\r\nStatham, _Short Crit. Hist. Arch._, 1912, p. 130), others are opposed,\r\nand believe that design in Greek architecture was a matter of feeling,\r\nand that the orders were first reduced to formulæ in Roman days\r\n(_e. g._, A. K. Porter, _Med. Arch._, 1909, I, 9; Goodyear, _Greek\r\nRefinements, Studies in Temperamental Arch._, 1912, esp. p. 83, quoting\r\nJoseph Hoffer from _Wiener Bauzeitung_, 1838). See on the subject a\r\nrecent article by my pupil, Dr. A. W. Barker, in _A. J. A._, XXII,\r\n1918, pp. 1 f., in which the above and other references are given.\r\n\r\n[590] Gardner, _Sculpt._, pp. 22-3, says: “Paradoxical as it may seem\r\nat first sight, the very freedom of Greek sculpture is to a great\r\nextent due to its close adherence to tradition.” He shows how the free\r\nplay of imagination depends on external conditions and tradition.\r\n\r\n[591] _E. g._, Vitruv., I, 2; especially these words: _Ut in hominis\r\ncorpore e cubito, pede, palmo, digito, ceterisque particulis (partibus)\r\nsymmetria est eurythmiae qualitas_; also III, 1: _Pes vero altitudinis\r\ncorporis sextae_ <_partis_>; _cubitum quartae; pectus item quartae_,\r\netc. Also Philostr., _Imag._, Proem.; the third-century A.

Foat, _op. cit._, offers a scheme or typical design,\r\nbased on wide data, which will serve as a universal basis for securing\r\nfacts about any statue under examination.\r\n\r\n[595] On the influence of such canons of proportion on contemporary\r\nartists, see Balcarres, _Evolution of Italian Sculpture_, p. 128.\r\n\r\n[596] _Cf._ Vitruvius, quoted above. The scholion on Pindar, _Ol._,\r\nVII, Argum., Boeckh, p. 158, speaks of πηχῶν τεσσάρων δακτύλων πέντε as\r\nthe height of the statue of Diagoras at Olympia, etc.\r\n\r\n[597] Vitruvius, _de Arch._, VII, Praef., 14, lists writers who\r\n_praecepta symmetriarum conscripserunt_. See V. Mortet, _Rev. Arch._,\r\nSér. IV, XIII, 1909, pp. 46 f, and figs. 1 and 2. In this discussion\r\nof ancient canons he shows that the chief ratio was that of the head\r\nto the height of the body; the proportion of 8 heads to the body was\r\nthat adopted by da Vinci and J. Cousin: 7 to 8 is found in the figures\r\nof the Parthenon frieze; a little under 7 in the _Diadoumenos_ of\r\nPolykleitos.\r\n\r\n[598] See Furtw., _Mp._, pp. 49-52. As examples, he gives the statue of\r\nApollo from the Tiber now in the Museo delle Terme: _Mp._, pp. 50-51,\r\nfigs. 8 and 9; _cf._ _R. M._, 1891, pp. 302, 377 and Pls. X-XII; the\r\nMantuan _Apollo_: _cf._ _50stes Berliner Winckelmannsprogr._, p. 139,\r\nn. 61 (for replicas); etc.\r\n\r\n[599] For Polykleitos’ canon, see Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 55; _S. Q._,\r\n953 f.; Furtw., _Mp._, p. 249.\r\n\r\n[600] So Pliny, _op. cit._, XXXV, 128; _cf._ J. Six, _Jb._, XXIV, 1909,\r\npp. 7 f.\r\n\r\n[601] _H. N._, XXXIV, 61; see Jex-Blake, p. XLVIII.\r\n\r\n[602] _H. N._, XXXIV, 65.\r\n\r\n[603] However, other fourth-century artists, notably Praxiteles, used\r\nimpressionism in the treatment of the hair: see Bulle, pp. 444 f.\r\n\r\n[604] In XXXIV, 80, he mentions Menaichmos, who wrote on the toreutic\r\nart probably in the fourth century B. C.; in XXXIV, 83 (_cf._ XXXV,\r\n68), he mentions Xenokrates, of the school of Lysippos, who wrote books\r\non art; he is probably identical with an artist of the same name known\r\nto us from inscriptions from Oropos and Elateia: _I. G. B._, 135, a, b\r\n(Oropos), c (Elateia); _Arch. Eph._, 1892, 52 (Oropos); the identity\r\nis doubted by Jex-Blake, p. xx, n. 2. In XXXIV, 84 (_cf._ XXXV, 68)\r\nhe speaks of Antigonos, who wrote on painting and who was employed\r\nby Attalos I of Pergamon to work on the trophies of his victory\r\nover the Gauls. For Antigonos as a writer on the criticism of art,\r\nsee Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, _Antigonos von Karystos_ (Kiessling and\r\nWilamowitz, _Philolog. Untersuchungen_, IV, 1881), Ch. I, pp. 7 f.\r\n\r\n[605] _H. N._, XXXIV, 55. According to the exact words of Pliny, the\r\n_Canon_ and the _Doryphoros_ were distinct works. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that Pliny’s words conceal the same statue under two names,\r\nhis commentary on each coming from a different source: see Furtw.,\r\n_Mp._, p. 229 and n. 4; _Mw._, p. 422 and n. 2; _cf._ Muenzer,\r\n_Hermes_, XXX, 1895, p. 530, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[606] Cicero, _Brut._, 86, 296. On the fame of the _Doryphoros_, see\r\n_id._, _Orator_, 2.\r\n\r\n[607] _Instit. Orat._, V, 12.21. In Philon’s treatise περὶ βελοποιϊκῶν,\r\nIV, 2, we read: τὸ γὰρ εὖ παρὰ μικρὸν διὰ πολλῶν ἀριθμῶν ἔφη γίνεσθαι,\r\nsc. Πολύκλειτος, (“Beauty,” he said, “was produced from a small\r\nunit through a long chain of numbers”), a description which rightly\r\ncharacterizes the _Doryphoros_. The system given by Vitruv., III, 1,\r\nhardly agrees with Polykleitan statues and so has been connected by\r\nKalkmann, though on insufficient grounds, with the canon of Euphranor:\r\nsee _50stes Berlin Winckelmannsprogr._, 1890 (Proport. des Gesichts),\r\npp. 43 f.; _cf._ H.

Most modern\r\ncommentators, however, refer the word to the statue, translating it\r\n“classical” or “chosen”: thus Urlichs, _Chrest. Pl._, 1857, p. 325; O.\r\nJahn, Ueber die Kunsturteile des Plinius (_Ber. saechs. Ges. d. Wiss._,\r\n1850), p. 125; H. L. von Urlichs, _Blaetter f. d. bayr. Gymnasialsch._,\r\n1894, pp. 609 f., translates it “klassisch” or “mustergueltig,” _i.\r\ne._, serving as a pattern or standard. But the term was too well known\r\nas an athletic one for it ever to have been applied to a statue. The\r\npresent participle, instead of the usual aorist (ἐγκριθείς), shows\r\nthat Alkamenes’ statue represented an athlete in the act of undergoing\r\nselection. The old emendation into ἐγχριόμενος has been recently\r\ndefended by Klein, _Praxiteles_, p. 50, who identifies Pliny’s statue\r\nwith the Glyptothek _Oil-pourer_ (Pl. 11); it is discredited by the\r\noccurrence of the epithet _Encrinomenos_ as a Roman proper name, _C. I.\r\nL._, V, 1, 4429, which shows how familiar it was. See Jex-Blake, on the\r\npassage of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[666] _Cf._ Gardner, _Hbk._, p. 345; Helbig, _l. c._\r\n\r\n[667] It seems to be a Hadrianic copy of an original which stood on the\r\nAthenian Akropolis.\r\n\r\n[668] Now in the Antiquarium, Rome: Helbig, _Fuehrer_, I, no. 1030;\r\nnoted in _B.

He also colored it to resemble bronze.\r\nThe method used in the restoration is certainly open to objection, but\r\nnot to the extent asserted by certain scholars, _e. g._, by von Mach,\r\nwho asserts that no Greek statue has received such unworthy treatment,\r\nand that the restoration makes it possible to refer the statue to\r\nalmost any age or admixture of influences: _Greek Sculpture, Its\r\nSpirit and Principles_, p. 326. Much of the beauty of the statue, to\r\nbe sure, is gone, but the style is not obscured. It has been restored\r\ntoo full, which gives it a sensuous appearance.

He thinks that the\r\noriginal may have been identical with the statue of Ἀπόλλων ἀναδούμενος\r\nstanding before the temple of Ares at Athens, P., I, 8.4, and that the\r\nπαῖς ἀναδούμενος of Pheidias at Olympia, P. VI, 4.5, also may have\r\nbeen an Apollo. He also interprets the figure of a charioteer entering\r\na chariot on an Attic relief (Fig. 63), to be discussed later, as an\r\nApollo: _Jb._, VII, 1892, pp. 54 f. For the relief, see B.

W., 1298;\r\nReinach, _Rép._ I, 133, 1-3; etc.), the weight on the left foot, _i.\r\ne._, essentially different from the Polykleitan pose.\r\n\r\n[770] _R.

In V, 7.7, the Idæan Herakles is said to have first\r\ncrowned his brother as victor there; _cf._ V, 8.3-4. We have already\r\n(p. 10) spoken of the difference of opinion as to whether it was the\r\nCretan (Idæan) Herakles, or the more famous son of Zeus and Alkmena,\r\nwho founded the games. On the traditional connection of the hero with\r\nOlympia, see E. Curtius, _Sitzb. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. zu\r\nBerlin_, 1894, pp. 1098 f.; Busolt, _Gr.

Apoll. Tyan._, IV, 28.\r\n\r\n[849] VI, 14.6-7.\r\n\r\n[850] Frazer, IV, p. 44, believes that this description may be\r\nimaginary, concocted from stories of Milo’s feats of strength; but\r\nHitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, p. 601, cite Guttman, _de olympionicis apud\r\nPhilostratum_, p. 7, Matz, _de Philostr. in describ. imag. Fide_, p.\r\n33, and Gurlitt, _Ueber Pausanias_, 1890, p. 413, as believing that it\r\nwas based on the appearance of the statue. Scherer, pp. 23 f., thought\r\nthat Philostratos followed Pausanias in interpreting the attributes of\r\nthe statue, and that the latter got his idea of the strength of the\r\nvictor from the statue or from a cicerone. Pliny, _H. N._, VII, 19,\r\nsays of Milo: _Malum tenenti nemo digitum corrigebat_. Aelian mentions\r\nMilo’s feat with the pomegranate in _Var. Hist._, II, 24 and _de Nat.\r\nanim._, VI, 55.\r\n\r\n[851] _Cf._ Philostr., _l. c._, ll. 27, 28: καὶ τὸ μήπω διεστὼς τῇ\r\nἀρχαίᾳ ἀγαλματοποιίᾳ προσκείσθω.\r\n\r\n[852] _Op. cit._, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[853] _Cf._ P., VIII, 46.3.\r\n\r\n[854] Pliny, _H.

It is 0.27 meter high (Bulle).\r\n\r\n[861] It will be considered later on in this chapter: p. 119 and n. 3.\r\nIt is 0.185 meter high (Bulle).\r\n\r\n[862] This statuette, showing Peloponnesian tendencies, is in the\r\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston; it is 0.25 meter high (Bulle).\r\n\r\n[863] In the same way the pediment statues from Aegina differ from\r\nAttic works by straighter lines and more compact forms.\r\n\r\n[864] He won a chariot victory some time between Ols. (?) 98 and 101\r\n(= 388 and 376 B. C.): P., VI, 2.8; Hyde, 17 (= 105 d; P., VI, 1.26);\r\nFoerster, 310.\r\n\r\n[865] He won in chariot-racing some time between Ols. (?) 115 and 130\r\n(= 320 and 260 B. C.): P., VI, 13.11; Hyde, 122; Foerster, 513. The\r\ndate is from the lettering on the recovered base: _Inschr. v. Ol._,\r\n177; _cf._ Hyde, p. 51. On such statues, _cf._ Reisch, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[866] The spelling Ηαγελαιδας occurs on two blocks, d, e, from the\r\nPraxiteles bathron at Olympia: _Inschr. v. Ol._, 631 = _I. G. B._,\r\n30; for the whole Praxiteles bathron see _Inschr. v. Ol._, 266.\r\nDittenberger and Purgold keep the reading Hagelaïdas. Possibly the\r\nspelling Ἁγελαίδα stands for ὁ Ἀγελαίδα; the MSS. of Pliny read\r\nHagelades; see _I. G. B._, p. xviii, Add. to no. 30; Gardner, _Hbk._,\r\np. 217, n. 1. On the sculptor, see Lechat, p. 380 and n. 4, and pp. 454\r\nf.; Collignon, I, pp. 316 f.; Joubin, pp. 14 f., 83 f., 92 f., etc.;\r\nBrunn, pp. 63 f.; Gardner, _Hbk._, pp. 216 f.; and especially Pfuhl, in\r\nPauly-Wissowa, VII, pp. 2189 f.\r\n\r\n[867] For Myron, see Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 57. Furtwaengler, _Mp._, p.\r\n196, _Mw._, 379-80, thinks that the connection is not literally true,\r\neven if considerations of chronology are not against it, and derives\r\nthe story of Hagelaïdas teaching Myron from the similarity between\r\nthe work of the two. For Polykleitos, see Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 55.\r\nThe tradition that Hagelaïdas was the master of Polykleitos has been\r\nunreasonably assailed by many scholars: _e. g._, by Robert, _Arch.\r\nMaerchen_, 1886, p. 97; Mahler, _Polyklet u. s. Sch._, 3912, pp. 6 f.;\r\nKlein, I, p. 340; _cf._ II, p. 143; _cf._ Springer-Michaelis, I, p.\r\n210. Furtwaengler, _Mp._, p. 196, _Mw._, p. 380, believes it impossible\r\nbecause of chronological difficulties, and assumes a sculptor of an\r\nintermediate generation as the teacher of Polykleitos; he, followed\r\nby Mahler, _l. c._, and Klein, I, 340, names Argeiadas (mentioned in\r\n_I. G. B._, no. 30) as this intermediate artist. However, he admits\r\nthat the statement is true in a general sense, since Polykleitos\r\ndeveloped his canon from that of Hagelaïdas: _cf._ _50stes Berl.\r\nWinckelmannsprogr._, p. 149; Pfuhl, however, p. 2192, has shown that\r\nthe relationship is perfectly possible.\r\n\r\n[868] To be mentioned _infra_, p. III and note 2.\r\n\r\n[869] Dio Chrysost., _de Hom. et Socr._, 1; here Mueller amends the\r\nMSS. reading ΗΠΟΥ to ΗΓΙΟΥ; E. A. Gardner, _Class. Rev._, 1894, p. 70,\r\nwrongly reads Ἡγελάδου.\r\n\r\n[870] _Mp._, pp. 53 and 196; _Mw._, pp. 80-81, and 380.\r\n\r\n[871] Wilamowitz has shown that it comes from Apollonios, son of\r\nChairis, who lived _circa_ 100 B. C., and that it goes back probably\r\nto the _Chronica_ of Apollodoros of Athens, who lived in the middle of\r\nthe second century B. C.: _Aus Kydathen_ (Kiessling and Wilamowitz,\r\n_Philolog. Untersuchungen_, I, 1880), pp. 154 f. Kalkmann, in his\r\n_Quellen der Kunstgesch. d. Plinius_, p. 41, believes that the date\r\nwhich is given by Pliny (XXXIV, 49) for the _floruit_ of Hagelaïdas,\r\nOl. 87 (= 423-429 B. C.), comes from the same Apollodoros.\r\n\r\n[872] _Op. cit._, pp. 41 and 65 f.; Pfuhl, p. 2194. Brunn, _l. c._,\r\nOverbeck, I, p. 140, and Robert, _l. c._, had assumed an earlier plague\r\nat the beginning of the fifth century B. C.; but the real occasion for\r\nthe dedication of the _Herakles_ remains obscure.\r\n\r\n[873] P., IV, 33.2.\r\n\r\n[874] P., VI, 8.6; Hyde, 82; Foerster, 142, 148.\r\n\r\n[875] P., VI, 14.11; Hyde, 132; Foerster, 133, 134.\r\n\r\n[876] P., VI, 10.6 f.; Hyde, 99; Foerster, 143. There is no reason for\r\nfollowing Brunn in his contention that these statues were set up some\r\ntime after the victories, as these dates fit the chronology of the\r\nartist outlined above.\r\n\r\n[877] A fifth-century type of statue occurs on these coins,\r\nrepresenting the god standing with the left foot forward, the knee\r\nslightly bent, a thunderbolt held in the extended right hand and an\r\neagle in the extended left: _B.

Frickenhaus,\r\nquoted by Pfuhl, p. 2194, believes that the pose is seen also in the\r\nsmall bronze pictured in _B. S. A._, III, 1896-7, Pl. X, 1.\r\n\r\n[878] P., VII, 24.4. See _B. M.

Winckelmannsprogr._, 1893, pp. 77\r\nf., thought that the Stephanos figure went back to an original by\r\nPythagoras, the rival of Myron, which Furtwaengler, _Mp._, p. 49,\r\nrightly characterizes as “wide of the mark”; Pfuhl, p. 2197, Bulle,\r\nand others regard its ascription to the school of Hagelaïdas as\r\nprobable, even if not capable of proof. Furtwaengler, _50stes Berl.\r\nWinckelmannsprogr._, p. 152, believes it was _vermutlich ein Werk des\r\nMeisters_ (_i. e._, _Hagelaïdas_) _selbst_: on pp. 146-7 he pronounces\r\nthe life-size marble torso of a statue of a nude man found in a wall\r\nover the ruins of the Palaistra at Olympia (Treu, _A. Z._, XXXVIII,\r\n1880, p. 45)—because of its resemblance in pose to that of the Ligourió\r\nstatuette—a Roman school copy of an original bronze victor statue going\r\nback to Hagelaïdas.\r\n\r\n[886] _E. g._, the marble group formerly in the Boncompagni-Ludovisi\r\ncollection, now in the Museo delle Terme, Rome: Helbig, _Fuehrer_, II,\r\n1314; _Guide_, 887; B.

M._, III, 1878, p. 194) and J.\r\nSix (_J. H. S._, X, 1889, pp. 109 f.), assumed two sculptors of the\r\nname of Alkamenes, ascribing the gable statues and that of _Hera_ at\r\nPhaleron (mentioned by P., I, 1.5) to the elder one. Furtwaengler later\r\nretracted the theory of two artists and assumed but one (_Mp._, p. 90,\r\nn. 3; _Mw._, p. 122 and n. 6). Koepp has shown that the _Hera_ is of no\r\nuse in dating, since the story of Pausanias that the temple of Hera was\r\ndestroyed by the Persians is an invention (_Jb._, V, 1890, p. 277). The\r\nidea of an elder Alkamenes based on the inscription on a herm recently\r\nfound in Pergamon (_A. A._, 1904, fig. on p. 76) has also been refuted\r\nby Winter (_A. M._, XXIX, 1904, pp. 208-211, and Pls. XVIII-XXI), who\r\nhas shown that the inscription and statue do not go so far back.\r\n\r\n[891] See Baum., pp. 1104 KK.\r\n\r\n[892] P. 243.\r\n\r\n[893] _A.

Naukydes and Daidalos describe themselves as sons of\r\nPatrokles in two inscriptions: _I. G. B._, 86 and 88.

Robert, _O. S._, pp. 186\r\nf., gives his activity as Ols. 98 to 103 (= 388-368 B.

B._, 90; Furtwaengler\r\nwrongly ascribed the statue of Xenokles to the elder Polykleitos and\r\nthat of Aristion to the younger: _Mp._, pp. 224-5. Loewy had already\r\nassumed the eider for Aristion, _Strena Helbigiana_, p. 180, n. 4, and\r\nthis was confirmed by the early dating of his victory in the _Oxy.

The argument derived from the _Amazon_ of Kresilas,\r\nmentioned by Pliny, XXXIV, 53, and apparently repeated in the present\r\npassage, is strong.

This\r\nvictor fillet is mentioned by Lucian in reference to the _Diadoumenos_\r\nof Polykleitos: _Philops._, 18.\r\n\r\n[1115] Xen., _Symp._, V, 9; Plato, _Symp._, 212 E; it appears often\r\non statues of Dionysos: _e. g._, on one in Furtwaengler’s _Samml.\r\nSabouroff_, Pl. XXIII; Dionysos is called Χρυσομίτρης in Soph., _Oed.\r\nTyr._, 209. The fillet was used as a breast-band for women’s dresses:\r\nPollux, VII, 65; etc.\r\n\r\n[1116] _J. H. S._, I, 1880, p. 177. In older days the athletic fillet\r\nwas called μίτρα (Lat. _mitella_): Pindar, _Ol._, IX, 84; _Isthm._,\r\nV, 62 (of wool); Boeckh, _Explic. ad Pind._, p. 193. In the Iliad\r\nμίτρα was the kilt or apron worn around the waist under the cuirass\r\n(a ζωστήρ being worn outside): IV, 137; IV, 187; V, 857; etc. It was\r\nused also later as a wrestler’s girdle: _A. G._, XV, 44; and for\r\nwomen’s headbands: Alkm., I; _cf._ Eurip., _Bacchae_, 833. Athletes on\r\nvase-paintings representing palæstra scenes often wear the fillet: _e.\r\ng._, the wrestlers and other athletes on the Philadelphia r.-f. kylix\r\npictured in Fig. 50, have red bands in their hair. Later the μίτρα\r\nwas specially used of women; if of men, it was a sign of effeminacy:\r\nAristoph., _Thesmophoriazusae_, 163. The home of the μίτρα appears to\r\nhave been Asia, as it was commonly worn by Asiatics: see Hdt., I, 195;\r\nVII, 62 (headdress); Virgil, _Aen._, IV, 216. We learn from Alkman\r\nthat it came from Lydia to Greece: fragm. 23, verses 67 f. On it, see\r\nBekker, _Charikles_, II, pp. 393 f., and Pauly-Wissowa, VII, 2, p. 2033\r\n(Bremer).\r\n\r\n[1117] See F. W., on 322.

It is 4 ft. 10.25 in. high\r\n(Smith); 1.48 meters (Bulle).\r\n\r\n[1139] Brunn, following older writers such as Winckelmann, had\r\npronounced it Polykleitan: _Annali_, LI, 1879, pp. 218 f.; _cf._\r\nMurray, I, pp. 313 f. and Pl. IX. Kekulé called it Myronian: _49stes\r\nBerl. Winckelmannsprogr._, 1889, p. 12; Gardner, _Sculpt._, p. 128,\r\nfinds it unrelated to Polykleitos and defends its Attic origin.\r\nEverything about it—except the mode of tying the fillet—differs from\r\nthe copies of Polykleitos’ statue, and especially the pose. Against\r\nBrunn’s view, see Michaelis, _Annali_, LV, 1883, pp. 154 f.\r\n\r\n[1140] So Bulle, Arndt (text to B.

Arndt believes that\r\nthe right arm with the palm in the hand is modern, like the head and\r\nleft arm; they are of a different marble from the torso. The torso\r\nis a replica of a statue in the Villa Albani, Rome: _op. cit._, fig.\r\n13; _cf._ Furtwaengler, _Mw._, p. 738 (= god type).

Furtw., _Mp._, p. 204, n. 6, shows that the Athens head\r\nbears no resemblance to the Capitoline. Furthermore, heads on coins of\r\nJuba differ from both and show no trace of the complicated head-dress.\r\nA marble head from Shershel (= Cæsarea) seems to be an authentic\r\nportrait of Juba II: see _Annali_, XXIX, 1857, Pl.

The meaning is explained by a similar\r\narchaistic Parian marble relief in Wilton House, Wiltshire, England,\r\nwhere the youth stands before a statue of Zeus, washing his hands\r\npreparatory to making a thank-offering to the god who gave him victory:\r\nsee Michaelis, p. 680, no. 48 and wood-cut on p. 681; Arndt, _La Glypt.\r\nNy-Carlsberg_, text, fig. 33; F.

The same archaistic traits are seen on a votive relief to Zeus\r\nXenios in the Museo delle Terme: Helbig, _Fuehrer_, II, 1405; Arndt,\r\n_op. cit._, fig. 34; this is to be dated in the first century B.

The boxer’s swollen ears are mentioned by Theokritos, XXII,\r\n45. The word ὠτοκάταξις seems to have meant a boxer whose ears were\r\nbattered by the gloves: Aristoph., _Fragm._, 72; Pollux, II, 83\r\n(whence Dindorf corrects the form ὠτοκαταξίας in Poll., IV, 144).

Though first called\r\nan _Artemis_ by Homolle (because of its resemblance to the so-called\r\nOriental winged _Artemis_ on a bronze relief from Olympia, von Mach,\r\ntext, opp. p. 36, fig. 5), it has generally been called a _Nike_ since\r\nits first ascription by Furtwaengler (_A. Z._, XL, 1882, pp. 324 f.),\r\nand brought into connection with a base in two parts found near the\r\nstatue on Delos in 1880 and 1881, inscribed with the names of Archermos\r\nand his father Mikkiades.

As the figure is only 0.143 meter tall, it seems to have\r\ndecorated the rim of a bronze bowl. It may be later than the Tuebingen\r\nbronze (Fig. 42) and is certainly of a different school.

Stuart Jones, _Select Passages from Anc.\r\nWriters Illustrative of the History of Gk.

The\r\nboy holding the whip, then, is Mnaseas’ son Kratisthenes, the chariot\r\nvictor mentioned by P., VI, 18.1. Stuart Jones follows Furtwaengler\r\n(_Jahrbuecher fuer Class.

(I, 33.3), Mela (_de Situ orbis_, II, 3.6), Tzetzes (S. Q.,\r\n838-9), and Zenobios (_l. c._), say that it was Pheidias, while Pliny\r\n(_H.

He dates it in the\r\nsecond half of the fifth century B. C., contemporary with the _Idolino_.\r\n\r\n[1439] The fleetness of Ladas was often extolled, especially by late\r\nGreek and Roman writers: P, III, 21.1; Plut., _Praecip. ger. reip._,\r\n10; Catullus, LV, 25; Juvenal, XIII, 97; Martial, II, LXXXVI, 8, and\r\nXC, 5; Seneca, _Ep._, LXXXV, 4; Solinus, 7; etc.\r\n\r\n[1440] _A.

See Benndorf, _de anthologiae Graecae Epigrammatis quae ad\r\nartes spectant_, Diss. inaug., 1862, pp. 13 f., and Kalkmann, _Jb._,\r\nX, 1895, pp. 76-77 and notes. Studniczka (see next note) reads line 4:\r\nΛάδας, οἱ δ’ ἄλλοι δάκτυλον οὐ προέβαν.\r\n\r\n[1441] _A. Pl._, IV, 54. Benndorf corrects the Mss. reading of the\r\nlast half of l. 2 as νεῦρα ταθεὶς ὄνυχι; others read the whole line:\r\nθυνὸν [= δρόμον] ἐπ’ ἀκροτάτῳ σκάμματι θεὶς ὄνυχα.

He\r\nbelieves that the helmet is not alien to the statue as some think, but\r\npoints out that the head, which is much restored and is akin to the\r\n_Perseus_, is wrongly attached to the body. Hauser, _Jb._, II, 1887, p.\r\n101, n. 24, because of the tree-trunk, does not believe that the statue\r\nrepresents a hoplite-runner; but Furtwaengler shows that the tree-trunk\r\noffers no objection to restoring a shield to the statue.\r\n\r\n[1494] Rayet, II, Pls. 64, 65 (head); B.

M. Vases_, B 380; _J. H.\r\nS._, XXVII, p. 252, fig. 2; Gardiner, p. 342, fig. 93. It was commonly\r\nheld slopingly over the shoulder level with the head in representations\r\nof the athletic style; _e. g._, the second athlete from the left in the\r\nsixth-century B. C. b.-f. Panathenaic amphora in the British Museum\r\n(Fig. 44): _B. M. Vases_, B 134; _cf._ also a similar figure on the\r\nsixth-century B. C. amphora in Leyden: _A. Z._, XXXIX, 1881, Pl. IX;\r\nGardiner, p. 361, fig. 108.\r\n\r\n[1589] At Athens as early as the fifth century B. C. there were\r\npractical javelin contests from horseback with a target, and such\r\ncontests kept up in Thessaly to the time of Hadrian: Gardiner, pp.\r\n356-8. Throwing the javelin at a target from horseback is seen on a\r\nPanathenaic amphora in the British Museum: Gardiner, p. 357, fig. 106;\r\n_J. H. S._, XXVII, Pl. XX. Pindar mentions javelin-throwing three\r\ntimes, and in each case the throw was for distance: _Nem._, VII, 70-1;\r\n_Isthm._, II, 35; _Pyth._, I, 44. Lucian, in a passage referring to\r\nthe pentathlon at Olympia, says that athletes competed for distance:\r\n_Anacharsis_, 27. On this question, see Juethner, pp. 54 f.\r\n\r\n[1590] Hesychios calls it ἀποτομάς, _s. v._; see also Pollux, X, 64.\r\n\r\n[1591] _A. Z._, XLI, 1883, Pl.

Fastening the thong is commonly depicted on vases: _e. g._, a\r\nyouth seated on the ground attaching the _amentum_ is pictured on a\r\nr.-f. hydria in the British Museum: _B. M. Vases_, E 164; _J.

On a r.-f. amphora\r\nfrom Vulci attributed to Euthymides, and now in the British Museum, we\r\nsee an akontistes holding the spear pointed to the ground and drawing\r\nthe _amentum_ tight preparatory to the throw: _B.

(?) 79 (= 464 B. C.): P., VI, 1.7; Hyde, 8; Foerster,\r\n233.\r\n\r\n[1881] He won in two events, the hoplite-race and charioteering,\r\nin Ols. (?) 83, 84 (= 448, 444 B. C.): P., VI, 2.1-2; Hyde, 12;\r\nFoerster, 211A. Perhaps one of his two statues by Myron represented\r\nhis charioteer (so Foerster), though more probably the two statues\r\nrepresented the victor for his two victories.\r\n\r\n[1882] He won some time between Ols. (?) 98 and 101 (= 388 and 376 B.\r\nC.): P., VI, 2.8; Hyde, 17; Foerster, 310; his statue stood beside that\r\nof his son Aigyptos on horseback; the latter won κέλητι about the date\r\nof his father’s victory: P., VI, 2.8; Hyde 18; Foerster, 301. The two\r\nmonuments were by the Sikyonian Daidalos.\r\n\r\n[1883] He won συνωρίδι καὶ τεθρίππῳ in Ols. 102, 103 (= 372, 368 B.\r\nC.): P., VI, 1.4; Hyde, 6; Foerster, 338, 345.\r\n\r\n[1884] He won some time between Ols. (?) 115 and 130 (= 320 and 260 B.\r\nC.): P., VI, 13.11; Hyde, 122; Foerster, 513: _Inschr. v. Ol._, 177.\r\n\r\n[1885] Polykles won in Ol. (?) 89 (= 424 B. C.): P., VI, 1.7; Hyde,\r\n9; Foerster, 796 (undated). For this athletic _genre_ group, see\r\nHitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, p. 534. On children’s hoops (τρόχοι) see L.

G._, 1, pp. 262-3).\r\nPeriandros won a chariot victory at Olympia at the end of the seventh\r\nor beginning of the sixth century B. C.: Foerster, 80, who assumes that\r\nit was a statue of Zeus, and not of Periandros.\r\n\r\n[1887] Gelo won in Ol. 73 (= 488 B. C.): P., VI, 9.4; Hyde, 90;\r\nFoerster, 180; _Inschr. v. Ol._, 143. This inscription on the recovered\r\nbase and another from the base of the monument of Pantarkes, who won\r\napparently in the chariot-race at the end of the sixth century B. C.\r\n(_Inschr. v. Ol._, 142; Foerster, 149), are the two oldest inscriptions\r\nknown of chariot victors at Olympia.\r\n\r\n[1888] He won Ol. 66 (= 516 B.

On the basis of this and other references,\r\nReisch built up a theory that there was also a fourth-century B. C.\r\nKalamis, the contemporary of the younger Praxiteles: _Jh. oest. arch.\r\nInst._, IX, 1906, pp. 199 f. He was followed by Amelung (_R. M._, XXI,\r\n1906, pp. 285 and 287) and Studniczka (_Abh. d. k. saechs. Gesellsch.\r\nd. Wiss., philolog.-histor. Klasse_, XXV, no. IV, 1907, pp. 5 f.).\r\nFurtwaengler has shown the weakness of such an argument and has rightly\r\nreferred the monument mentioned by Pliny to the great Kalamis and his\r\nyounger contemporary, the elder Praxiteles: _Sitzb. Muen. Akad._, 1907,\r\npp. 160 f.\r\n\r\n[1903] P., VI, 18.1. Kratisthenes won Ol. (?) 83 (= 448 B. C.): Hyde,\r\n185; Foerster, 193 A.\r\n\r\n[1904] P., VI, 12.6; Hyde, 105d. The same Timon is mentioned again:\r\nP., VI, 2.8; Hyde, 17. This monument may have been set up for a\r\nsecond victory or even for the victory mentioned by Pausanias, VI,\r\n2.8; however, I have classed it as an honor dedication, assuming two\r\nmonuments: Hyde, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[1905] Lampos won some time after Ol. (?) 105 (= 360 B. C.): P., VI,\r\n4.10; Hyde, 44; Foerster, 420. Philippi, the native city of Lampos, was\r\nfounded in Ol. 105 by Philip, father of Alexander, on the site of an\r\nolder town, Krenides.\r\n\r\n[1906] _H. N._, XXXIV, 89; it was by the statuary Piston.\r\n\r\n[1907] Reisch, p. 49, believes that she represented a _Nike apteros_;\r\nRouse, p. 164, also believes that such figures were Victories.\r\n\r\n[1908] _H. N._, XXXV, 108.\r\n\r\n[1909] _Ant. Denkm._, I, 4, 1889, Pl. XLIV.\r\n\r\n[1910] _B. M. Sculpt._, I, 814; _Museum Marbles_, IX, Pl. XXXVIII,\r\nfig. 2. A. H.

A small\r\npiece of the adjacent slab to the right (found on the eastern slope\r\nof the Akropolis in 1859-1860), fitting the main block exactly, shows\r\ntwo horses’ tails and one hind leg and proves that the chariot was\r\nrepresented at rest.\r\n\r\n[1919] This fragment contains a head whose pointed beard and petasos\r\nhave been thought to indicate the god: Dickins, no. 1343; Collignon, I,\r\np. 378, fig. 195; von Mach, fig. 11, opp. p. 58; Conze, _Nuove Memorie\r\ndell’ Instituto_, II, pp. 408 f. and Pl.

He\r\nalso (p. 320) favors the well-known view of Doerpfeld (_A. M._, XII,\r\n1887, pp. 25-61, 190-211; XV, 1890, pp. 420-439) that the Hekatompedon\r\nor Old Temple of Athena, rebuilt by the Athenians shortly after the\r\nPersian wars, existed not only down to 406 B. C., when Xenophon says\r\nthat it was burnt (_Hell._, I, 6), but down at least to the time of\r\nPausanias. This view is held by J. Harrison, _Mythology and Monuments\r\nof Ancient Athens_, 1890, pp. 505 f., Dickins, _l. c._, and many\r\narchæologists. It has been rejected by many others, _e. g._, Petersen\r\n(_A. M._, XII, pp. 62-72), Wernicke (_ibid._, pp. 184-189), and _in\r\nextenso_ Frazer (_J. H. S._, XIII, 1892-1893, pp. 153-187; reprinted\r\nin his edition of Pausanias, II, pp. 553-82). Murray, I, p. 143 and\r\nfig. 35, referred the relief to one of the metopes of the Old Temple of\r\nAthena.\r\n\r\n[1924] _Sitzb. Muen. Akad._, 1906, II, pp. 147 f.; _cf._ also _ibid._,\r\n1905, pp. 433 f.\r\n\r\n[1925] Springer-Michaelis (_l. c._) think that it may represent a\r\nchariot victor; similarly Purgold (_Arch. Eph._, 1885, p. 251).\r\nBoetticher (_Die Akropolis_, 1888, pp. 85-6) believes that it\r\nrepresents a Panathenaic victor.\r\n\r\n[1926] In the British Museum: _B. M. Sculpt._, II, 951 and Pl. XIII;\r\nSir Charles Fellows, _An Account of Discoveries in Lycia_, 1841, p.\r\n166. The Chimæra may be introduced as a heraldic device of the owner\r\nof the tomb (Smith). Bellerophon appears on Pegasos on a relief from a\r\nrock tomb of Pinara: _B. M. Sculpt._, I, 760. We should also compare\r\nwith these the reliefs found by Fellows at Xanthos and now in the\r\nBritish Museum. They show a two-horse chariot with a seated charioteer\r\n(F. W., 131; Murray, I, Pl. IV), a two-horse chariot with a charioteer\r\nand a seated man (F. W., 133; Murray, Pl. III), and a young rider (F.\r\nW., 134).

Furtwaengler, _l. c._, found von Duhn’s\r\nview that the _Charioteer_ is an original work of Pythagoras untenable.\r\nHe also combated his interpretation of πολύζαλος as a proper name,\r\npreferring the suggestion of Washburn that it might be an adjective.\r\nHowever, in a former article (_Sitzb. Muen. Akad._, 1897, pp. 129\r\nf.) he had emphasized the similarity between the statue and a bronze\r\nstatuette in London (_B. M. Bronzes_, 515 and Pl. XVI; _Sitzb._, _l.\r\nc._, Pl. V, two views) which he believed was almost certainly a product\r\nof Magna Græcia. He found the style of the _Charioteer_ Ionic-Attic\r\nwithout Peloponnesian affiliations, and referred it to Amphion or\r\nto some unknown artist of the circle of Kritios and Nesiotes. For a\r\nsimilar view, see Homolle, _Mon. Piot_, IV, 1897, p. 207.

This torso had the\r\nleft leg free, while the Vatican one had the right one free; it is also\r\ndry and hard in its technique.\r\n\r\n[2044] That of Emil Braun, in _Annali_, L, 1850, p. 249.\r\n\r\n[2045] _E. g._, Loewy, _R.

H. S._,\r\nXXIII, 1903, pp. 130-131 (where he identifies the _Apoxyomenos_ with\r\nthe _Perixyomenos_ of Daïppos, the son or pupil of Lysippos, a work\r\nmentioned by Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 87); _ibid._, XXV, 1905, pp. 234\r\nf., especially p. 236 (on pp. 255 f. he dates the _Apoxyomenos_ just\r\nafter 300 B. C., though ultimately deriving it from the school of\r\nLysippos); _id._, _Class. Rev._, 1913, p. 56; E. A. Gardner, _Sculpt._,\r\np. 222; _Hbk._, p. 443. T. L. Shear, _A. J.

N._, XXXIV, 61 (= S. Q. no. 1444), quotes Douris\r\nas saying that Lysippos was the pupil of no artist. He tells how\r\nthe painter Eupompos advised the sculptor as a boy _naturam ipsam\r\nimitandam, esse non artificem_. Such a judgment, of course, can not be\r\nliterally true, as every artist is to a large extent a child of his age\r\nand circumstances. _Cf._ Jex-Blake, pp. xlviii f., for the anecdotal\r\ncharacter of Pliny’s statement. That the statement comes, perhaps, from\r\nEupompos is the view of Kalkmann, _Quellen der Kunstgeschichte des\r\nPlinius_, 1898, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[2049] _B. C.

Of this head, which\r\nis earlier than that of the _Apoxyomenos_, Furtwaengler says that it\r\nis “one of the finest and most purely Lysippan works in existence.”\r\nIn _Mp._, p. 338, he mentions a bronze statuette of Hermes from\r\nAthens now in Berlin (Invent. 6305) “in the swinging posture of the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_,” and says that it is of the purest Lysippan style.\r\n\r\n[2054] _J.

N._, XXXIV, 65.\r\n\r\n[2073] The hair, however, of the _Apoxyomenos_ is an exception, for,\r\neven if worked out with some care, it is devoid of expression.\r\n\r\n[2074] The use of the drill is seen in the Praxitelian _Hermes_, but is\r\nnot seen in the Tegea heads, nor is it common in the first half of the\r\nfourth century B. C.: _cf._ Furtwaengler, _Mp._, p. 309.\r\n\r\n[2075] So Treu, _Bildw. v. Ol._, p. 208 (though formerly in _A.

See Plans A and B.\r\n\r\n[2093] This fact, together with its place of finding not far from the\r\nGreat Gymnasion, led Treu to believe that the statue once adorned the\r\ninterior of the exercise-place of the athletes: _Bildw. v. Ol._, p. 209.\r\n\r\n[2094] The Praxitelian _Hermes_ similarly shows an unfinished treatment\r\nof the back hair; in fact the entire back of the statue is carelessly\r\ndone (_Bildw. v. Ol._, p. 203, fig. 233), though chisel-rasps show\r\na subsequent attempt to better it. This condition led Treu at first\r\n(_Ausgrab. v. Ol._, V, p. 10; followed by Furtwaengler, _Mp._, p.\r\n308, n. 7; _Mw._, p. 531, n. 3) to believe that the statue was made\r\nat Olympia with regard to its position in the Heraion. Later (_Bildw.\r\nv. Ol._, pp. 204-5) Treu believed that this merely indicated that the\r\nstatue was intended to stand against a wall; and since the present\r\nbase is not the original one (see Bulle, _apud_ Purgold, _Ergebnisse\r\nv. Ol._, II, pp. 157 f.), that the statue was not originally meant for\r\nthe temple, but was moved thither, perhaps in Nero’s day; _cf._ also\r\nWernicke, _Jb._, IX, 1894, pp. 108 f. For the _Hermes_, mentioned by\r\nP., V, 17.3, and found in the cella of the Heraion on May 8, 1877, see\r\n_Bildw. v. Ol._, Tafelbd., Pls. XLIX-LIII; Textbd., pp. 194 f. and\r\nfigs. 225-234.\r\n\r\n[2095] However, Lysippos made the statue of Polydamas of Skotoussa,\r\nwho won the pankration in Ol. 93 (= 408 B. C.), many years after the\r\nvictory: see P., VI, 5.1; Hyde, 47; Foerster, 279; H. L. von Urlichs,\r\n_Ueber Griech. Kunstschriftsteller_, Diss. inaug., 1887, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[2096] P. 27.\r\n\r\n[2097] _Inschr. v.

See Hyde, 37; Foerster, 349, 353, 359.\r\n\r\n[2099] For the earlier dating of Lysippos, see Winter, _Jb._, VII,\r\n1892, p. 169 (who begins the artist’s activity with the seventies),\r\nTreu, _Bildw. v. Ol._, p. 211, and Milchhoefer, _Arch. Stud. fuer H.\r\nBrunn_, p. 66, n. 2; see also Hyde, pp. 26-7, (who gives the sculptor’s\r\nartistic activity as Ols. 103-115 = 368-320 B. C.); E. A. Gardner,\r\n_Sculpt._, pp. 216-217, who dates his activity 366-316 B. C.; P.\r\nGardner, _infra_, next note.\r\n\r\n[2100] _J. H. S._, XXV, 1905, pp. 243-249; on p. 245 he says: “There is\r\nsome evidence for work by Lysippos at a later date than B. C. 320. And\r\nif he were born, as seems probable, about B. C. 390, he may well have\r\naccepted commissions, to be executed mainly by his pupils, for several\r\nyears after 320.”\r\n\r\n[2101] P., VI, 4, 6-7; Hyde, 41; Foerster, 384 and 392, who, on the\r\nbasis of _I. G. B._, p. 75, to no. 93b, dates the victories Ols. (?)\r\n112 and 113 (= 332 and 328 B. C.).\r\n\r\n[2102] _L. c._, p. 246.\r\n\r\n[2103] P., VI, 17, 3; Hyde, 175; Foerster, 390 and 397 (= Ols. ? 113\r\nand 114, = 328 and 324 B. C. on the basis of _I. G. B._, p. 75).\r\n\r\n[2104] _E. g._, Furtwaengler, who gives 350-300 B. C. as the period of\r\nhis artistic activity: _Mw._, p. 523, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[2105] _B. C. H._, XXI, 1897, p. 598 (and copied in XXIII, 1899, p.\r\n422). The _Agias_ is but slightly later than the _Hermes_, if we\r\naccept Furtwaengler’s dating for the latter, about 343 B. C.: _Mp._,\r\npp. 307-308; _Mw._, pp. 529-531. Brunn had regarded the _Hermes_ as\r\na youthful work of Praxiteles: _Deutsche Rundschau_, VIII, 1882, pp.\r\n188 f. Purgold, _Aufsaetze E. Curtius gewidmet_, pp. 233 f., and S.\r\nReinach, _Gaz. Arch._, 1887, p. 282, n. 9, had assigned it to the year\r\n363 B. C.\r\n\r\n[2106] _H. N._, XXXIV, 37.\r\n\r\n[2107] _Ibid._, 61 f.\r\n\r\n[2108] The two are contrasted in XXXV, 156: _[Varro] laudat et\r\nPasitelen qui plasticen matrem caela turae et statuariae scalpturaeque\r\n(= sculpturae) dixit_, etc. _Cf. infra_, Ch. VII, p. 324, n. 4. They\r\nare also contrasted in XXXVI, 15. _Sculptura_ is the modern title of\r\nBk. XXXVI.\r\n\r\n[2109] II, p. 150. See also Bulle, p. 137. Amongst recent writers who\r\noppose this view are Koepp, _Ueber d. Bildnisse Alex. d. Gr._, p. 29,\r\nand Preuner, _op. cit._, pp. 46-7.\r\n\r\n[2110] Thus the Sikyonian Kanachos worked in marble, bronze, gold and\r\nivory, and cedar-wood: Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 50 and 75; XXXVI, 41; P.,\r\nII, 10.5; IX, 10.2; etc.\r\n\r\n[2111] F. Spiro, _Woch. f. kl. Philologie_, XXI, 1904, col. 792 (in his\r\nreview of my _de olymp. Stat. a Paus. commem._).\r\n\r\n[2112] See _Bildw. v. Ol._, Tafelbd., Pl. LV, 1-3; Textbd., pp. 209 f.\r\n\r\n[2113] This is substantially Preuner’s view: _op. cit._, pp. 39-40 and\r\n46-47; the later view of P. Wolters that the Delphi group was older\r\nthan the statue at Pharsalos has already been mentioned _supra_, p.\r\n292; see _Sitzb. Muen. Akad._, 1913, III, no. 4, pp. 44-45.\r\n\r\n[2114] In _A. J. A._, XI, 1907, pp. 414-16, I argued that the statue of\r\nAgias was an original and not a copy; in the present work this view is\r\nsomewhat modified.\r\n\r\n[2115] So Homolle, _B. C. H._, XXIII, 1899, pp. 445 and 459; S.\r\nReinach, _C. R. Acad. Inscr._, 1900, pp. 8 f.; H. Lechat, _Rev. des\r\nÉtudes anciennes_, II, 1900, pp. 195 f.; Gardner, _Hbk._, p. 441;\r\nP. Gardner, _J. H. S._, XXIII, p. 127; _cf._ Preuner, _op. cit._,\r\np. 38; etc. Homolle, _l. c._, p. 471, says that if the _Agias_ is a\r\ncopy, “_c’est celui d’une copie authentique immédiate, contemporaine\r\ndu modèle_.” The view that the Delphi group was not original is well\r\nexpressed by P. Wolters, _l. c._, p. 50, who says that “_niemand die\r\ndelphischen Statuen fuer Originale des Lysippos erklaeren wird_.”\r\n\r\n[2116] _Hbk._, p. 441, n. 2; only two small marble props, reaching to\r\nthe calves, support the ankles.\r\n\r\n[2117] This treatment gives the impression of texture and profusion;\r\nsee Furtwaengler, _Mp._, p. 309.\r\n\r\n[2118] Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 69-71 (list of bronze works).\r\n\r\n[2119] Mechanically exact copies were unknown in the fourth century\r\nB. C. Furtwaengler has shown that such copies began to be made in the\r\nsecond century B. C., or possibly at the end of the third, and became\r\ncommon only in the first: _Ueber Statuencopien im Altertum_, 1896.\r\n\r\n[2120] It is mentioned by Pausanias, IX, 35.3, and the Surname\r\n“_Oulios_” by Strabo, XIV, 1.6 (C. 635); it is described by Plutarch,\r\n_de Musica_, 14 (= 1136 A), and Macrobius, _Sat._, I, 1713.\r\n\r\n[2121] Schol. on Pindar, _Ol._, XIV, 16, Boeckh, p. 293.\r\n\r\n[2122] Bekker, _Anecd. gr._, p. 299, 8-9; _cf._ Athen., X, 24 (p. 424\r\nf.).

S._, XXVI, 1906, pp.\r\n172-3, quoted in part by Dr. Bates, _l. c._, pp. 155-6.\r\n\r\n[2140] It was chiefly the preponderance of the lower part of the face\r\nover the upper, in consequence of the large chin and strongly marked\r\ncheek-bones, that led Treu to predicate Peloponnesian rather than Attic\r\ninfluence in the Tegea heads: _A. M._, VI, 1881, p. 408. He found\r\nthem Polykleitan in character, as did also Graef, _l. c._, p. 210,\r\nFurtwaengler, _Mp._, p. 523, and Collignon, II, p. 238. L. R. Farnell,\r\nhowever, long ago combated the theory of Peloponnesian influence, and\r\nfound analogies in fifth-century Attic works of the time of Pheidias,\r\nas well as in works from the beginning of the fourth century B. C.: see\r\n_J. H. S._, VII, 1886, pp. 114 f.\r\n\r\n[2141] _Descriptiones stat._, B (in _Philostrati opera_, ed. Kayser,\r\np. 891). He also says (_ibid._) that Skopas ὥσπερ ἔκ τινος ἐπιπνοίας\r\nκινηθεὶς εἰς τὴν τοῦ ἀγάλματος δημιουργίαν τὴν θεοφορίαν ἐφῆκε.\r\nThe words with which Diodoros (Fragm. 1, Bk. XXVI) characterized\r\nPraxiteles, as ὁ καταμίξας ἄκρως τοῖς λιθίνοις ἔργοις τὰ τῆς ψυχῆς\r\nπάθη, apply much better to Skopas, for Praxiteles’ “emotions of the\r\nsoul” are mood and temperament rather than emotion and passion.\r\n\r\n[2142] _B. C. H._, XXV, 1901, Pls. IV-V.\r\n\r\n[2143] The same overhanging masses of flesh, which we see in the male\r\nheads, are, however, visible in several other female heads attributed\r\nto Skopas: _e. g._, in the colossal one called _Artemisia_ from the\r\nEastern pediment of the Mausoleion: Gardner, _Sculpt._, Pl. LIX; in the\r\nhead of an _Aphrodite_ found in the sea off Laurion: _J. H. S._, XV,\r\n1895, pp. 194f. and fig. (Aphrodite?); in the head of a goddess found\r\nsouth of the Akropolis (and in the copy of it in Berlin): Gardner,\r\n_Hbk._, p. 457, fig. 119; and in the Dresden statuette of a _Mænad_:\r\nTreu, _Mélanges Perrot_, Pl. V; Gardner, _Sculpt._, Pl. LII; etc.;\r\nthey are also plainly visible in the _Demeter of Knidos_: Gardner,\r\n_Sculpt._, Pl. LIII; etc. These heads are discussed by Gardner,\r\n_Sculpt._, pp. 190f., and are ascribed by him to Skopas.\r\n\r\n[2144] _J. H. S._, XXVI, 1906, p. 174. Gardner (_ibid._) does not\r\nexplain this contrast in expression between the _Atalanta_ and the\r\nsurrounding heroes on the analogy of the contrast in the calmness of\r\n_Apollo_ among the struggling _Lapiths_ from the Olympia pediment,\r\nsince the action in the torso of _Atalanta_ shows that she was no mere\r\nspectator. He finds the explanation rather in the sex and youth of the\r\nheroine; for this reason he thinks that the sculptor did not represent\r\nher as sharing equally with the others the passion of the combat. He\r\nfinds a truer analogy in the contrast between calm and passion in the\r\n_Lapiths_ and _Centaurs_ of the Parthenon metopes, where the human and\r\nbestial are thus distinguished; just so the heroine-goddess is here\r\ndistinguished from her human companions. He also supposes that Skopas\r\nwas not ready thus early in his career (just after 395 B. C., when the\r\ntemple of Athena Alea was destroyed by fire) to apply his new extreme\r\nof expression to female heads. However, it must not be overlooked that\r\nthese male heads—because of their marked individuality—presuppose\r\na more mature genius, and so can just as well be assigned to the\r\nperiod of the Arkadian revival of 370 B. C. It has recently been\r\nseriously disputed whether the _Atalanta_ should be assigned at all\r\nto the Eastern pediment, where the French excavators placed it; thus\r\nCultrera has looked upon it as an akroterion figure, while Thiersch\r\nand Neugebauer have identified it with a single figure representing\r\n_Nike_. See Cultrera, _Atti dell’ Accad. dei Lincei_, 1910, pp. 22f.;\r\nH. Thiersch, Zum Problem des Tegeatempels, _Jb._, XXVIII, 1913, p.\r\n270; Neugebauer, _Studien ueber Skopas_, Leipsic, 1913; the latter has\r\nargued that the head and torso do not belong together, while Dugas has\r\nmaintained the older view, that the turn and position of the neck fit\r\nthe torso: _Rev. de l’art anc. et mod._, 1911, pp. 9f.\r\n\r\n[2145] The effect in the Tegea heads is heightened by the abrupt\r\ntransition from the brow to the socket—the outer end of the upper lid\r\nbeing almost hidden.\r\n\r\n[2146] Kabbadias, I, p. 416, no. 869; Staïs, _Marbres et Bronzes_,\r\npp. 168 f. and fig.; Conze, _Griech.

N._, XXXIV, 66; in the text, _et Alexandrum Thespiis\r\nvenatorem_, it is best to understand _venatorem_ as an appositive,\r\ntherefore indicating a statue of Alexander as hunter. As the boar (in\r\nthe bronze original no support was necessary) is a Roman accessory\r\nlike the chlamys, it is best to call the work under discussion not\r\n_Meleager_, but merely hunter and dog (so Furtw.-Urlichs, _Denkm._, _l.\r\nc._). It was probably dedicated by a successful hunter to Artemis, or\r\nelse it was a grave-monument, as such figures are common on sarcophagi:\r\nsee Robert, _Ant. Sarcoph. Reliefs_, IV, Pls. XLVII, 154, and XLIX,\r\n155, pp. 188 f.; and also on Attic grave-reliefs: _e. g._, on the\r\nIlissos relief mentioned above (Fig. 74).\r\n\r\n[2157] Furtw., _Mp._, pp. 304-5; Furtw.-Urlichs, Amelung, Helbig, von\r\nMach, Arndt, E. Sellers-Strong (see introduction to Furtw., _Mp._, p.\r\nXIII), etc.\r\n\r\n[2158] _J. H. S._, XXIII, 1903, pp. 128-129.\r\n\r\n[2159] _Sculpt._, p. 219.\r\n\r\n[2160] _Cf._ P. Gardner, _Types of Greek Coins_, 1883, Pl. XII, 16.\r\n\r\n[2161] Pl. LXIX in _Six Greek Sculptors_. E. A. Gardner (p. 226) is\r\ndoubtless right in believing that this form of brow was a personal\r\npeculiarity of Alexander, as it recurs so often in his portraits. It\r\nis seen in the head of Alexander on the sarcophagus from Sidon (either\r\nby a pupil of Lysippos or by some sculptor under his influence), the\r\nreliefs from which portray the same subject as the bronze group by\r\nLysippos in Delphi mentioned by Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 64, dedicated\r\nby Krateros on the occasion narrated by Plutarch, _Vita Alex. Magni_,\r\n40, who states that the group was executed conjointly with Leochares:\r\nsee Hamdy Bey et Th. Reinach, _Une nécropole royale à Sidon_, 1892,\r\nPl. XXXIII, no. 6 (reproduced by Gardner, _Sculpt._, Pl. LXXI). So\r\nfar as I know, it occurs in Lysippan work to a prominent degree\r\nonly in likenesses of Alexander. We know that Lysippos created the\r\nAlexander-type of head, as he alone could reproduce his manly and\r\nleonine air (_cf._ Plut., _de Alex. M. fortuna aut virtute_, _oratio_\r\nII, 2, = p. 335). It is, to a less extent, present in the Azara\r\nhead in the Louvre, which, owing to its likeness to the head of the\r\n_Apoxyomenos_, used to be taken as the nearest copy of the original by\r\nLysippos.\r\n\r\n[2162] It should be observed that the axis of the right eye in the head\r\nfrom Sparta droops slightly, which causes the eyeball to turn in. This\r\nseems to me to be merely the result of imperfect skill in modeling. It\r\nhas a tendency to give to the face a look of greater intensity.\r\n\r\n[2163] See _supra_, pp. 295-6.\r\n\r\n[2164] _B. C. H._ XXIII, 1899, p. 455. Furtwaengler, _Bronz. v. Ol._,\r\npp. 10 f., has shown that it was a favorite device to represent boxers\r\nand pancratiasts with a sombre look (“_der finstere Blick_”).\r\n\r\n[2165] 1102: κοὐδεὶς τροπαῖ’ ἔστησε τῶν ἐμῶν χερῶν.\r\n\r\n[2166] In the passage already cited from _de Alex. Magn. fort. aut\r\nvirtute_, Orat. II, 2, (= p. 385c); ... καὶ τῶν ὀμμάτων τὴν διάχυσιν\r\nκαὶ ὑγρότητα, κ. τ. λ.; _cf._ also his _Vita Alex. Magni_, IV (= p.\r\n666), ... τὴν ὑγρότητα τῶν ὀμμάτων.\r\n\r\n[2167] The hair of the head from Sparta, like that of the _Agias_ and\r\nthe _Philandridas_, has not the expression displayed in some Lysippan\r\nheads (notably in portraits of Alexander), nor the detail which we\r\nshould expect from Pliny’s statement that Lysippos excelled in his\r\ntreatment of hair (_H. N._, XXXIV, 65; see next note). But the _Agias_\r\nand the _Philandridas_ represent pancratiasts, and here we should not\r\nexpect such expression. In the _Agias_, the hair, even if lacking in\r\ndetail, is treated carefully and with variety.\r\n\r\n[2168] _H. N._, XXXIV, 65: _propriae huius videntur esse argutiae\r\noperum custoditae in minimis quoque rebus_. Here the word _argutiae_\r\nmeans “subtlety,” rather than “animation,” as given in Harper’s Latin\r\nDictionary.\r\n\r\n[2169] I need hardly add that such an idealizing tendency should be\r\ncarefully distinguished from the deification of mortals which came into\r\nprominence after the time of Alexander, but existed in Greece from the\r\nearly fifth century B. C., at least. The case of heroizing the Thasian\r\nTheagenes, who won at Olympia in boxing and the pankration in Ols. 75\r\nand 76 (= 480 and 475 B. C.), has been discussed with similar ones in\r\nCh. I, p. 35. But the fact that a victor wanted his statue to be more\r\nor less assimilated to the ideal type of the hero, whom he regarded as\r\nhis athletic prototype and ideal, does not mean that he had any idea of\r\nlooking upon himself as a god.\r\n\r\n[2170] This would explain the simple, even sketchy, treatment of the\r\nclosely cropped hair, just as in the _Agias_ and the _Philandridas_.\r\nThe similarly parted lips of the Sparta head are certainly more\r\nappropriate to an athlete represented as weary with his toil than\r\nto a youthful Herakles. The slightly fierce expression of the face,\r\naugmented by the already noted imperfection in the modeling of the\r\nright eyeball, recalls the γοργόν look characteristic of boxers and\r\npancratiasts; _cf. supra_, p. 317, n. 2. On the threatening eyes\r\nof contestants in general, see Xenophon, _Mem._, III, 10, 6-8, and\r\n_supra_, p. 59.\r\n\r\nThe head appears to me to be that of a boy of about sixteen years;\r\nits style is too early for a victor in the boys’ pankration, as this\r\nevent was not introduced at Olympia until the 145th Olympiad (= 200 B.\r\nC.): see Paus., V, 8.11 and Ph., 13. The wrestling match for boys was\r\nintroduced in 01. 37 (= 632 B. C.): see Paus., V, 8.9, and Afr. Boys\r\nwere first allowed to box in Ol. 41 (= 616 B. C.): see Paus., _ibid._\r\n(though Philostratos, 13, gives two traditions, Ols. 41 and 60).\r\n\r\n[2171] We have record of only one statue of a victor set up in Sparta,\r\nthat of the wrestler Hetoimokles, who won at the beginning of the sixth\r\ncentury B. C.: see Paus., III, 13.9, and _cf. infra_, Ch. VIII, p. 362,\r\nno. 4.\r\n\r\n[2172] In the present chapter I have partly rewritten two articles\r\nwhich have appeared in the _A. J.

Scherer also, p. 18, n. 4, adduces a passage from\r\nthe work of the second-century A. D. rhetorician Aristeides, κατὰ\r\nτῶν ἐξορχ., II, p. 544 (ed. Dindorf), which he thinks points to the\r\nexclusive use of metal for victor statues: τοὺς ἐπὶ στεφανιτῶν ἀγώνων\r\nσκεψώμεθα, οἷον τὸν Δωριέα ... καὶ πάντας, ὧν εἰκόνες χαλκαί; he also\r\nrefers to a passage in Dio Chrysost., _Orat._, XXVIII, A, p. 531 R (289\r\nM).\r\n\r\n[2193] F.

This has\r\nbeen discussed in Ch. I, p. 27.\r\n\r\n[2199] Pliny differentiates carefully between _ars sculptura_ (_i.\r\ne._, sculpture in stone) and _ars statuaria_ (_i. e._, in bronze):\r\nthus Bk. XXXIV of the _H. N._ is concerned with the latter, Bk. XXXVI\r\nwith the former. In XXXVI, 15, he says that _sculptura_ is the older,\r\nand that both bronze statuary and painting began with Pheidias in Ol.\r\n83 (= 448-445 B. C.), a statement which is inconsistent with XXXIV,\r\n83, where he speaks of Theodoros (of the middle or second half of the\r\nsixth century B. C.) as casting a likeness of himself in bronze. But\r\nit is well known that Pliny in his long work quotes from a variety of\r\nsources, without any attempt to reconcile them.\r\n\r\n[2200] Gurlitt, _Ueber Pausanias_, p. 414, says, less correctly,\r\none-sixth. Forty inscribed bases may be referred to victor statues\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, while 63 others have been referred to victor\r\nstatues not mentioned by him: see _infra_, Ch. VIII, pp. 340 f., 353 f.\r\n\r\n[2201] Taken from Treu’s account in _Bildw. v. Ol._, pp. 29-34 and\r\n216-218.\r\n\r\n[2202] Chapter III, _supra_, pp. 162-3; _a_ = _Bildw. v. Ol._,\r\nTafelbd., Pl.

To-day marble is far commoner\r\nthan bronze for artistic work; the reverse was true in antiquity.\r\nMany varieties of bronze—a combination of copper and tin in varying\r\nproportions—were named from places where it was manufactured: _e. g._,\r\nCorinthian, Delian (the favorite with Myron), Aeginetan (the favorite\r\nwith Polykleitos), etc.\r\n\r\n[2213] _Cf._ Furtwaengler, _Bronz. v.

The story how Arrhachion expired\r\nat the moment of victory, throttled by his adversary, whose toe he\r\nsucceeded in putting out of joint, is told by Africanus, Pausanias\r\n(VIII, 40.2), and Philostratos (_Imag._, II, 6 = p. 411); Pausanias\r\nalso mentions that the body was crowned.\r\n\r\n[2216] Frazer, IV, pp. 391-2; III, pp. 40-1. The statue has otherwise\r\nnot been published. In all probability it is the same one listed by\r\nWaldemar Deonna, in his _Les Apollons archaïques_, Geneva, 1909, p.\r\n187, no. 79. This was seen at Phigalia in 1891 by M. Chamonard and\r\nnotices of it are to be found in the following works: _B. C. H._, XV,\r\n1891, pp. 440 and 448; _Chroniques d’Orient_, II, p. 36; _R.

Fowler, _History of Sculpture_, 1916, pp. 59-60; etc.\r\n\r\n[2244] Pottier, _op. cit._, p. 414, assumes a religious reason for\r\nthe left foot being advanced in both types. For another, natural\r\nexplanation, see Homolle, _de antiquiss. Dianae Simul._, p. 95, quoted\r\nby Collignon, I, p. 118, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[2245] The Greeks first copied the type in statuettes: _e. g._,\r\nalabaster figurines from Naukratis: W.

Pottier, _op.\r\ncit._, p. 409, cites two alabaster examples from Egypt (probably\r\nfrom Naukratis) which are nude, and on Pl. XVII, he reproduces four\r\nterra-cotta draped figurines in the Louvre, of Phœnician manufacture,\r\nsimilar to Egyptian works. The nudity of the “Apollos” marks the\r\ndistinction between Greek and barbarian art.\r\n\r\n[2246] Brunn, in his _Kunst bei Homer_, 1868, quoted by Gardner,\r\n_Hbk._, p. 47, showed by a very true analogy the way in which the Greek\r\nartist became an imitator. The Greeks borrowed their alphabet from\r\nPhœnicia, but wrote Greek and not Phœnician with it; just so the Greek\r\nartist borrowed the alphabet of art from Egypt, but with it wrote his\r\nown language of art.\r\n\r\n[2247] _Gesch. des Materialismus_,^3 I, p. 127 (quoted by F. W., on p.\r\n12).\r\n\r\n[2248] This is the view of K. Kouroniotis, who carefully examined them.\r\nI quote his words incorporated in Dr. Svoronos’ letter to me of Dec.\r\n29, 1911: τὰ γράμματα ἐπὶ τοῦ κορμοῦ, νομίζω ὅτι δὲ ἔχουσι καμμίαν\r\nσημασίαν, ἴσως δὲ μάλιστα εἶνε τὰ χαράγματα νέου τινός.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions on the great majority of victor monuments found at\r\nOlympia were engraved upon the horizontal upper face of the base in\r\nfront of the feet—at least down to the fourth century B. C.: see\r\n_Inschr. v. Ol._, p. 235. Dittenberger and Purgold have referred two\r\ninscribed convex bronze fragments found in the Altis to the flanks of\r\nvictor statues set up in imperial times: _ibid._, nos. 234-5.\r\n\r\n[2249] Only one other victor from Phigalia is known, Narykidas, who\r\nwon πάλῃ some time in the first half of the fourth century B. C., as\r\nthe mutilated epigram and artist’s name found upon fragments of the\r\npedestal of his statue at Olympia attest, a date out of the question\r\nfor our statue: see _Inschr. v.

In a\r\npreceding note (p. 334, n. 4) we have already listed examples of the\r\ntype of Apollo appearing on vases, etc.; see _B. M. Sculpt._, I, p. 82.\r\n\r\n[2276] The date of these sculptors is fixed by that of their pupil,\r\nthe Aeginetan Kallon, who lived at the beginning of the fifth century\r\nB. C.; _cf._ Akropolis inscription, _I. G. B._, no. 27. This statue\r\nis mentioned by P., IX, 35. 3, as holding the _Graces_ in one hand.\r\nPlutarch, who cites Antikles and Istros as his authorities, gives a\r\nbetter description of it in _de Musica_, 14; he says that it held the\r\nbow in the right hand and the _Graces_ playing on musical instruments\r\nin the left. A scholion on Pindar, _Ol._, XIV, 16, Boeckh, p. 293,\r\nmentions such an image of Apollo in Delphi, manifestly a copy of the\r\nDelian one. Both the scholiast and Macrobius, _Saturnalia_, 1, 17.\r\n13, place the bow in the left hand and the _Graces_ in the right, an\r\narrangement confirmed by Athenian coins which are copied from the\r\nreplica of the statue in Athens (Bekker, _Anecdota gr._, I, p. 299, ll.\r\n8-9). Frazer, V, p. 174, figs. 8-9, reproduces two of these coins.\r\n\r\n[2277] This image, known as the _Philesian Apollo_, already discussed\r\non pp. 118f., is described by Pliny, _H. N._, XXXIV, 75. It was made\r\nbetween 494 and 479 B. C.: see Frazer, IV, pp. 429-30. It is copied on\r\nMilesian coins, which represent the god nude, holding a stag in the\r\nright hand and a bow in the left: see Overbeck, _Griech. Mythol._,\r\nIII, _Apollon_, Muenztafel I, 22 f. P., IX, 10.2, mentions a cedar\r\nreplica of the statue in Thebes. In the British Museum is a bronze, the\r\nso-called Payne Knight statuette, a copy of the one on the coins; it is\r\nreproduced by Frazer, _l. c._, p. 430, fig. 45 (= _B. M. Bronzes_, no.\r\n209); Frazer mentions as other copies a statuette in Berlin, described\r\nin _A. Z._, XXXVII, 1879, pp. 84-91, and one from the Ptoian sanctuary,\r\ndescribed in _B. C. H._, X, 1886, pp. 190-6, and Pl. IX. On Milesian\r\nreliefs, see one published by Kekulé von Stradonitz, Ueber d. Apoll.\r\ndes Kanachos, _Sitzb. Berl. Akad. d.

Scherer,\r\n_op. cit._, pp. 23 ff., thought that this statue conformed with the\r\ntype of the _Apollo_ of Kanachos already mentioned. Reisch, p. 40,\r\nrightly believes that it had “_noch geschlossene Beine, aber geloeste\r\nArme_,” _i. e._, like the _Apollo_ of Tektaios and Angelion already\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n[2290] Arndt, _La Glyptothèque Ny-Carlsberg_, pp. 1-2 and Pls. I-II;\r\nDeonna, pp. 143-4, no. 21. It has been ascribed to different artists\r\nof the last quarter of the sixth century B. C.: Lechat, _Au Musée de\r\nl’Acropole_, pp. 359-60; Klein, I, p. 246 f.; we have already discussed\r\nit on pp. 127-8. E. A. Gardner, _J. H. S._, VIII, 1887, p. 190, refers\r\nsome of the statues found at the Ptoian sanctuary to athletes, but\r\nHolleaux believes that these statues represent Apollo: _B. C. H._, X,\r\n1886, p. 68; _cf._ also Staïs, _Marbres et Bronzes_, p. 8. W. Vischer,\r\n_Kleine Schriften_, II, 1878, p. 307, admits that some of the “Apollos”\r\ncan be athletes, as Conze and Michaelis had done: _Annali_, XXXIII,\r\n861, p. 80.\r\n\r\n[2291] See Deonna, p. 253.\r\n\r\n[2292] Thus Scherer, p. 22, n. 3, and Reisch, p. 40, leave the question\r\nunsettled; Gardner, _Hbk._, p. 98, n. 1, thinks that the material for\r\na decision as to a given statue, whether of this god or that, or of a\r\nworshiper or athlete, hardly exists; Collignon, _Mythol. figurée de la\r\nGrèce_, p. 84, recognizes that these statues stood for both gods and\r\nathletes; Hitz.-Bluemn., III, 1, p. 262, think that the type passes\r\nequally well for gods and sepulchral statues; Overbeck, I, pp. 114-115,\r\nand F. W., p. 11, believe that it represents a general scheme for\r\nathletes, sepulchral statues, and Apollos.\r\n\r\n[2293] The first part of this chapter appeared, under the title The\r\nPositions of Victor Statues at Olympia, in _A.

The numbers of the victors from the\r\ncatalogue of that work, showing the order of presentation by Pausanias,\r\nare here retained in parentheses: _e. g._, Telemachos (122). A letter\r\nafter the number indicates either that an adjacent “honor” statue,\r\n_e. g._, Philonides (154a), stood next to a victor statue, _e. g._,\r\nMenalkeas (154), or that no statue is mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2303] _E. g._, Kalkmann, _Pausanias der Perieget_, 1886, p. 88.\r\n\r\n[2304] _E. g._, nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 were Eleans; 7-9 and 11-14 were\r\nSpartans; 17-18 and 23-26 were Eleans; 45 and 48-49, 51, 54, 57 were\r\nArkadians; 6-9 and 11-14 were victors in chariot-races; 30, 34, 37, 40\r\nwere pancratiasts; 25-28 had statues by Sikyonian artists; 39-40 had\r\nstatues by Athenian artists; 59-63 formed a family group; etc.\r\n\r\n[2305] _Ueber Pausanias_, 1890, p. 393.\r\n\r\n[2306] The lack of continuity in describing the altars led R. Heberdey,\r\n_Eranos Vindobonensis_, 1893, pp. 39 f., (Die Olympische Altarperiegese\r\ndes Pausanias), to conclude wrongly that Pausanias took over bodily\r\nfrom an earlier work his enumeration of the altars, only here and\r\nthere interposing a remark of his own, as _e. g._, V, 15. 2, where he\r\nparenthetically describes the Leonidaion.\r\n\r\n[2307] _E. g._, the statue of the Akarnanian boxer (10) stood among\r\nthose of Spartan victors (7-14); Eukles (52), a grandson of Diagoras,\r\nhad his statue away from his family group (59-63); the two statues of\r\nTimon (17 and 105 d) stood in different parts of the Altis.\r\n\r\n[2308] VI, 1.3.\r\n\r\n[2309] So Furtwaengler, _A. Z._, XXXVII, 1879, p. 146; Treu, _ibid._,\r\np. 207; Flasch, Hirschfeld, and Scherer, in the works already cited.\r\n\r\n[2310] So Doerpfeld, _l. c._, p. 88; Michaelis, _A. Z._, XXXIV, 1876,\r\np. 164; Hitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, p. 531; etc.\r\n\r\n[2311] Hyde, p. 64. I here append three such passages: in V, 24.3, in\r\nspeaking of the statue of the _Zeus_ of the Lacedæmonians, he says\r\nthat it τοῦ ναοῦ δέ ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ μεγάλου Ζεὺς πρὸς ἀνατολὰς\r\nἡλίου, _i. e._, at the southeast corner of the temple near where\r\nthe pedestal was found (_cf._ _Inschr. v. Ol._, 252, and _Olympia,\r\nErgebn._, Textbd., I, p. 86); in V, 26.2, in speaking of the offerings\r\nof Mikythos, he says that they stood παρὰ δὲ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου τὴν\r\nἐν ἀριστερᾷ πλεύραν, _i. e._, on the northern side of the temple of\r\nZeus, where most authorities find their foundations (_cf._ _Inschr. v.\r\nOl._, 267-269, and Flasch, _op. cit._, p. 1093); in VIII, 38.2, he says\r\nthat Mount Lykaion is ἐν ἀριστερᾷ δὲ τοῦ ἱεροῦ τῆς Δεσποίνης, _i. e._,\r\nto the north of that temple. _Cf._ also V, 21.2. Professor Bluemner,\r\nreviewing my monograph _de olymp. Stat._, in the _Berl. Philol.\r\nWochenschr._, XXIV, 1904, col. 1382, objects to my interpretation of ἐν\r\nδεξιᾷ, and admits not one but three possibilities: (_a_) of the temple\r\n_pro persona_, _i. e._, its south side; (_b_) of a spectator facing\r\nthe chief, _i. e._, east front, the northern half of the space before\r\nit; (_c_) of a spectator with his back to this front, _i. e._, the\r\nsouthern half of this space. But if Pausanias had meant either of the\r\ntwo latter, he would have said πρὸ τοῦ ναοῦ, as in VIII, 37.2, κατὰ τὸν\r\nναόν, _cf._ V, 15.3, or ἀντικρὺ τοῦ ναοῦ, _cf._ V, 27.1.\r\n\r\n[2312] For locations of bases, see _Insch. v. Ol._, nos. 166 (Troilos),\r\n160 (Kyniska), 172 (Sophios). Because of the finds in the Prytaneion\r\nboth Hirschfeld and Scherer started this ἔφοδος west of the Heraion.\r\n\r\n[2313] From the unfinished condition of the back of the Lysippan marble\r\nhead from the statue of Philandridas (10), as well as its excellent\r\nsurface preservation (Frontispiece and Fig. 69), we have already argued\r\nthat some of these early statues may have stood along the southern\r\nsteps of the temple against the columns of the peristyle: _supra_, p.\r\n300.\r\n\r\n[2314] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, no. 248; _cf._ P., V, 27.9.\r\n\r\n[2315] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, nos. 161 (Narykdas); 146 (Kallias); 159\r\n(Eukles); 144 (Euthymos); 156 (Charmides); 155 (Hellanikos). Other\r\nbases of statues which must have stood in this vicinity have also been\r\nfound, far from their original positions: _i. e._, those of Athenaios\r\n(36), 56 meters west of the Leonidaion; of Polydamas (47), fragments\r\n26 meters southeast of the Echo Hall; of Diagoras (59), five fragments\r\nnear the Metroon; of Damagetos (62), in the Leonidaion; of Dorieus\r\n(61), near the _Victory_ of Paionios; of Kyniskos (45), inside the\r\nByzantine church; of Damoxenidas (54), near the Heraion. See _Inschr.\r\nv. Ol._, nos. 168 (Athenaios), 151 (Diagoras), 152 (Damagetos), 153\r\n(Dorieus), 149 (Kyniskos), 158 (Damoxenidas); for the sculptured base\r\nof Polydamas (47), see _Bildw. v. Ol._, Tafelbd., PI. LV, 1-3; Textbd.,\r\npp. 209 f.\r\n\r\n[2316] Argum., Boeckh, pp. 157-8. Pausanias names them in the order:\r\nDiagoras, Akousilaos, Dorieus, Damagetos, Peisirhodos. The scholiast\r\nnames them in the order: Diagoras, Damagetos, Dorieus, Akousilaos,\r\nEukles, Peisirhodos.\r\n\r\n[2317] See for Aristotle, _F. H. G._, II, p. 183, fragm. 264. Apollas\r\nPonticus is little known: _cf._ _F. H. G._, IV, p. 307, fragm. 7; he\r\nprobably copied from Aristotle’s work.\r\n\r\n[2318] This is Dittenberger’s explanation, _Inschr. v. Ol._, nos. 151\r\nand 159; and also that of Robert, _O. S._, p. 195, Scherer, p. 49, and\r\nGurlitt, _op. cit._, p. 411; Purgold, however, _Inschr. v. Ol._, p.\r\n262, has tried to reconcile the two accounts on the theory of no change.\r\n\r\n[2319] However, Kalkmann, _Pausanias der Perieget_, p. 90, thinks that\r\nthe two groups of Diagoras and Alkainetos stood apart.\r\n\r\n[2320] The base of the statue of Pythokles was found between the\r\nHeraion and the Pelopion: see _Inschr. v. Ol._, 162-163.\r\n\r\n[2321] Gurlitt, _Ueber Pausanias_, p. 412, assumed the possibility of\r\nthe existence of two different statues of Lysandros, one 35 a, and the\r\nother somewhere after Charmides (58) in the family group of Diagoras;\r\nKalkmann, _op. cit._, p. 105 and note 4, explains the discrepancy\r\nbetween the scholiast and Pausanias on the theory that the latter\r\nborrowed from older lists; Purgold, _Aufsaetze E. Curtius gewidmet_,\r\npp. 238 f., assumed but one statue of Lysandros.\r\n\r\n[2322] Scherer, p. 51 (_cf._ Plan opposite p. 56), and Flasch, _l. c._,\r\np. 1095, note 1, proposed a route south from the Heraion to the west of\r\nthe so-called Great Altar site, while Hirschfeld, _l. c._, p. 119, made\r\nit run to the east of it. Doerpfeld, _op. cit._, p. 88, starting east\r\nof the Heraion, made the route run first to the west along the south\r\nside of the temple, and thence around the western side of the Pelopion,\r\nand so across to the _Eretrian Bull_; Michaelis, _l. c._, p. 164, with\r\nthe same starting-point, had it bear first to the east parallel with\r\nthe Treasury Terrace, and thence south. See Plans A and B.\r\n\r\n[2323] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, no. 259, and _Ol., Ergebn._, Textbd., II,\r\npp. 153-155, etc.; _cf._ P., V, 26.1.\r\n\r\n[2324] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, nos. 157 (So[si]krates; for the\r\nrestoration of the name, see Hyde, p. 37); 167 (Kritodamos); 164\r\n(Xenokles). The plate from the pedestal of the statue of the unknown\r\nArkadian victor (79) was found far away from this point, in the\r\nPalaistra. We have shown (_supra_, pp. 244-5,) that the statue of\r\nPhilippos (79a), mentioned by Pausanias as the work of Myron (_cf._ VI,\r\n8.5), was probably only that of this older unknown Arkadian, later used\r\nfor Philippos, who won some time between Ols. (?) 119 and 125 (= 304\r\nand 280 B. C.); see _Inschr. v. Ol._, no. 174; _cf._ Hyde, _op. cit._,\r\npp. 39-41.\r\n\r\n[2325] On the name, see Hyde, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[2326] See _Ol., Ergebn._, Textbd., I, p. 86, and _cf._ II, p. 78. A\r\nslit in the lower step of the base of the _Zeus_ may have contained the\r\ntablet mentioned by P., V, 23.4. Three of the four inscribed blocks\r\nof Gelo’s chariot base were found in the Palaistra: _Inschr. v. Ol._,\r\nunder no. 143.\r\n\r\nFor Doerpfeld’s identification of the Council-house (Bouleuterion) with\r\nthe tripartite building south of the temple of Zeus just outside the\r\nSouth Altis wall, see _Ausgrab. zu Ol._, IV, 1878-1879, pp. 40-46, and\r\n_Olympia, Ergebn._, Textbd., II, pp. 76-79. Others, on the basis of a\r\npassage in Xenophon’s _Hell._, VII, 4.31, wrongly place it near the\r\nPrytaneion in the northwestern part of the Altis. _Cf._ Frazer, III,\r\npp. 636 f., and Doerpfeld, _l. c._, pp. 78 f. See Plans A and B.\r\n\r\n[2327] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, no. 177. It stands on the south edge of\r\nthe South Terrace wall between its gateway and the later East Byzantine\r\nwall of the Altis.\r\n\r\n[2328] Hyde, pp. 49 f., where I assume that the passage VI, 13.8 is a\r\ndigression, and that the name of a victor has dropped out at the end\r\nof 13.7. There I have inserted, from a recovered inscription, the name\r\nof Akestorides of Alexandria Troas, placing his statue next to that of\r\nAgemachos (118) of similar date, the only other Asiatic in this part\r\nof the Altis. Foerster, 501, dates Akestorides wrongly in the second\r\ncentury B. C. (on the basis of Furtwaengler, _A. M._, V, 1880, p. 30,\r\nn. 2, end), although the inscription from the base is referred by\r\nDittenberger to the end of the third; Agemachos won in Ol. 147 (= 192\r\nB. C.); I have therefore dated Akestorides tentatively between Ol. (?)\r\n142 and Ol. (?) 144 (= 212 and 204 B. C.).\r\n\r\n[2329] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, 147, 148 (Tellon, inscription renewed in\r\nthe first century B. C.); 165 (Aristion); 184 (Akestorides).\r\n\r\nRoehl (_I. G. A._, no. 355 and Add., p. 182) referred an inscription\r\non two marble fragments found in 1879 (_cf._ _A. Z._, XXXVII, 1879, p.\r\n161, no. 312), one found near the Heraion, the other east of the temple\r\nof Zeus, to the victor Agiadas (103); Dittenberger (_cf._ _Inschr.\r\nv. Ol._, no. 150) and others have rightly rejected this ascription.\r\nSimilarly the inscribed base of the statue of Areus (105 b), son of\r\nAkrotatos, King of Sparta, found in the Heraion (see _Inschr. v.\r\nOl._, no. 308), belongs rather to the second statue of Areus (148 a)\r\ndedicated by Ptolemy Philadelphus; _cf._ Hyde, pp. 44-45. I have also\r\nreferred the second inscription of the artist Pythagoras (_Inschr. v.\r\nOl._, no. 145) found in the Leonidaion, to the statue of Astylos (110),\r\nbecause of its similarity to that on the base of the statue of Euthymos\r\n(56) likewise by Pythagoras: _ibid._, pp. 47-48.\r\n\r\n[2330] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, nos. 169 (Aristophon), 154 (Xenombrotos\r\nand Xenodikos), following Robert’s ascription, _O. S._, 1900, pp.\r\n179 f.; a second epigram referring to Xenombrotos alone (_Inschr. v.\r\nOlymp._, no. 170) must belong to a second monument not mentioned by\r\nPausanias; _cf._ Hyde, p. 53.\r\n\r\n[2331] _E. g._, Furtwaengler, _A.

For the bronze foot (Fig. 62) of one of\r\nthem, see _supra_, p. 255 and n. 3.\r\n\r\n[2333] VI, 18.7. He gives this honor to Praxidamas and Rhexibios\r\n(187-188), who won in Ols. 59 and 61 (= 544 and 536 B. C.)\r\nrespectively. We have already pointed out that the statue of Oibotas\r\n(29), who won in Ol. 6 (= 756 B. C.), was set up in Ol. 80 (= 460 B.\r\nC.) by the Achæans (VI, 3.8).\r\n\r\n[2334] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, nos. 294 (Leonidas; _cf._ _A. M._, XIII,\r\n1888, p. 322, note 1, Treu); 183 (Seleadas; this is my own ascription;\r\nsee Hyde, p. 58; Dittenberger wrongly restored the name as Σέλευκος);\r\n632 (Polypeithes and Kalliteles); 171 (Deinosthenes); 178 (Glaukon;\r\nhis monument was a little bronze chariot, not a statue, thus imitating\r\nearlier sixth-century victor dedications, like that of Kyniska (7);\r\nno. 296 is another inscription from a statue of Glaukon dedicated by\r\nPtolemy Euergetes).\r\n\r\nThe pedestal of the statue of Paianios (167) was found behind the south\r\nside of the Echo Colonnade and therefore far removed (_Inschr. v. Ol._,\r\nno. 179); Pausanias again mentions Paianios in VI, 15.10. Another\r\npedestal (no. 632), found south of the west end of the Byzantine\r\nchurch, has been referred by Purgold to the statue of Lysippos (162):\r\n_cf._ _A. Z._, XXXIX, 1881, pp. 85 f., no. 387. Hitz.-Bluemn., II, 2,\r\np. 615, and others have rejected the ascription.\r\n\r\n[2335] Διέστηκε δὲ ἀγυιὰν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐσόδου τῆς πομπικῆς, τοὺς γὰρ δὴ ὑπὸ\r\nἈθηναίων καλουμένους στενωποὺς ἀγυιὰς ὀνομάζουσιν οἱ Ἠλεῖοι.\r\n\r\n[2336] See _A. M._, XIII, 1888, pp. 327-336 and Pl. VII (Die Altis\r\nMauer in Olympia). On the west of the Altis are the ruins of two\r\nparallel walls, the inner Greek, the outer Roman; the original South\r\nwall of the Altis ran along the line of the South Terrace wall, the\r\nlater Roman wall (dating from Nero’s time) to the south of it. Thus\r\nin Pausanias’ day, the ἔσοδος πομπική was opposite the Leonidaion.\r\nIn two other passages, however, it appears to be at the southeast\r\ncorner of the Altis (V, 15.7; VI, 20.7). R. Heberdey (in _Eranos\r\nVindobonensis_, 1893, pp. 34-47) explains this discrepancy by saying\r\nthat Pausanias, in mentioning the southwestern entrance, is writing\r\nfrom his own observation after the Roman extension, and in the other\r\npassages is copying from other writers who wrote before that extension.\r\nDoerpfeld’s explanation, however, is better: in the Roman extension a\r\ngate was built at the southwest corner of the new West wall superseding\r\nthe older southeast entrance. Processions still passed along the same\r\nway, but were now _inside_ the Altis, the great gateway of Nero at the\r\nsoutheast corner being given up after his death. _Cf._ Frazer, III, pp.\r\n570-572; Hitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, pp. 375-6.\r\n\r\n[2337] P., VI, 17.1.\r\n\r\n[2338] _A.

This view was already refuted\r\nby Adler, _A. A._, 1895, p. 108, and Doerpfeld, _Ergebn. v. Ol._,\r\nTextbd., II, pp. 162 f. Doerpfeld later referred these remains also to\r\nprehistoric houses (_cf._ preceding note)\r\n\r\n[2344] V, 13.8. The exact site of the Pelopion is given in V, 13.1 (see\r\nPlans A and B). Wernicke, (_l. c._, pp. 94 f.) placed the older altar\r\nof Zeus (who was at first worshiped in common with Hera) between the\r\nHeraion and Pelopion (as Puchstein also did). He believed that later,\r\nhowever, after the building of the temple of Zeus and the Pelopion,\r\nthe altar was moved east of both and stood somewhere northwest of the\r\nelliptical depression, where Pausanias saw it. He explained the lack\r\nof remains on the theory that the Christians would completely destroy\r\nthis, the chief pagan altar. But it is difficult to see why the few\r\nChristian settlers in this out of the way place should have shown any\r\nsuch anger. Doerpfeld (_Ergebn. v. Ol._, Textbd., II, _Baudenkmaeler_,\r\np. 163) suggested that it may have stood south of the _Exedra_ of\r\nHerodes Attikos, where its site must certainly be sought.\r\n\r\n[2345] Hitz.-Bluemn., II, i, p. 359, rightly say that the words of\r\nPausanias point to a place in the Altis where there are neither\r\nfoundations nor ashes. Since it is incredible that the Christians\r\nshould have destroyed it so completely, they assume that Pausanias\r\nmade a mistake in his directions. Their conclusion that the elliptical\r\ndepression best fits the conditions is untenable now.\r\n\r\n[2346] _Op. cit._, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[2347] See _A. M._, XIII, 1888, pp. 335-336, and _Ergebn._, Textbd., I,\r\np. 88. In the latter he says: “_Zu unserer Verwunderung sehen wir, dass\r\nder zweite Teil die ununterbrochene Fortsetzung des ersten Teiles ist,\r\nalso in Wirklichkeit nur eine Ephodos, nur ein einziger Rundgang._”\r\n\r\n[2348] This pillar stood between the Great Altar and the temple of\r\nZeus: P., V, 20. 6.\r\n\r\n[2349] Ἀνδριάντας δὲ ἀναμεμιγμένους οὐκ ἐπιφα<νέ>σιν ἄγαν ἀναθήμασιν,\r\nκ. τ. λ., (VI, 17.7); again in VI, 18.2 he says that he discovered the\r\nstatue of Anaximenes “by searching” (ἀνευρών).\r\n\r\n[2350] Similarly, on arriving at the statue of Telemachos, he\r\nmoved first to the east and then returned (passing the chariot of\r\nKleosthenes) before proceeding west, without mentioning it: see\r\n_supra_, p. 345.\r\n\r\n[2351] On analogy with V, 15.1. See Hyde, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[2352] The Terrace wall can still be traced before the western front\r\nof the temple and also to the north-east of it; _cf._ Treu, _A. Z._,\r\nXXXVI, 1878, p. 36: “_So umgab denn vermutlich einst den ganzen Tempel\r\neine statuenbekroente Terrasse._” Hitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, p. 619, suppose\r\nsuch a road to the west and north of the temple, but would interpret it\r\nas being ἐν ἀριστερᾷ.\r\n\r\n[2353] _Cf._ Hyde, p. 70. Hitz.-Bluemn. (see preceding note) rejected\r\nthis textual change of mine as unnecessary, and followed Hirschfeld and\r\nDoerpfeld in having Pausanias return along the south side of the temple\r\nof Zeus. I proposed this change by analogy with the text of V, 24.1, V,\r\n21.2, and other passages.\r\n\r\n[2354] The bronze tablet of Demokrates (170), found south of the\r\nsouthwest corner of the temple of Zeus, did not belong to his victor\r\nstatue, but to a base which stood probably inside the temple: _Inschr.\r\nv. Ol._ no. 39. Also the archaic marble helmeted head and arm with\r\nthe remains of a shield attached (see _Bildw. v. Ol._, Tafelbd., Pl.\r\nVI, 1-4, and 5-6), the head being found west of the temple and the\r\narm before the gate of the Pelopion, wrongly ascribed by Treu (_A.\r\nZ._, XXXVIII, 1880, pp. 48 f., and _Bildw. v. Ol._, III, pp. 33-34)\r\nand Overbeck (I, pp. 198 f., and p. 178) to Eperastos (183), I have\r\nreferred to an older hoplite, Phrikias of Pelinna (Foerster, nos. 151,\r\n155): see Hyde, p. 43, and _supra_, Ch. III, pp. 162-3 and Fig. 30a, b.\r\n\r\n[2355] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, no. 293.\r\n\r\n[2356] See _Inschr. v. Ol._, nos. 267-269. The supposed foundation was\r\nfound thirty feet north of the temple; _cf._ Frazer, III, pp. 646 f.;\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[2357] V, 20.6 f. A large foundation, between the pedestal of Dropion,\r\nKing of the Paionians, _Inschr. v. Ol._, no. 303, (see Plans A and B),\r\nand the pedestal of the _Eretrian Bull_, may have formed part of the\r\nhouse of Oinomaos (_cf._ Curtius-Adler, _op. cit._, p. 40; Flasch, _l.\r\nc._, p. 1074). Wernicke, (_Jb._, IX, 1894, p. 95), however, refers it\r\nto the oval depression called the Great Altar site. Doerpfeld (_Ergebn.\r\nv. Ol._, Textbd., I, p. 82) is opposed to this view and places it\r\nfurther north, near the Metroon.\r\n\r\n[2358] This is Kalkmann’s theory (_op. cit._, p. 89), who calls this\r\nsection (VI, 18.7) the “_letzter Trumpf_,” an addition having no\r\nconnection with the second ἔφοδος. He compares it with V, 24.9, where\r\nPausanias, after ending the _periegesis_ of the altars, adds one more,\r\nthat of “Zeus Horkios,” which stood in the Council House, though he had\r\nalready passed this point twice without mentioning the fact. Kalkmann\r\nalso compares it with V, 27.12 (the transition to the account of the\r\nvictor statues). Gurlitt (_op. cit._, p. 392) explains this last\r\nsection, _i. e._, V, 27.12, as due to a later revision of Pausanias’\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[2359] VI, 19.1.\r\n\r\n[2360] See the Catalogue in my _de olymp. Stat._, (pp. 3 f.) for dates;\r\nand _cf. ibid._, Ch. IV, pp. 72 f., for results.

C.), _cf._\r\nDoerpfeld, _Ol., Ergebn._, Textbd., II, pp. 19. f.\r\n\r\n[2363] Enation (176) is simply called an Arkadian by P., VI, 17.3.\r\n\r\n[2364] VI, 1.2, and _cf._ his words in VI, 17.1.\r\n\r\n[2365] The last dated victor statue at Olympia, known from\r\ninscriptions, is that of Valerios Eklektos of Sinope, four times victor\r\nas herald, winning in Ols. 256, 258, 259, 260 (= 245, 253-261 A.\r\nD.): Foerster, 741-744. Philoumenos of Philadelphia in Lydia, victor\r\nin wrestling (?) in Ol. (?) 288 (= 373 A. D.), Foerster, 750, had a\r\nstatue, as we learn from the conclusion of an epigram preserved by\r\nPanodoros in Cramer’s _Anecd. gr. Parisiensia_, 1839-41, II, p. 155, 17\r\nf.; _cf._ _Inscr. Graecae metricae_, ed. Preger, 1891, no. 133. It may\r\nhave been in Olympia.\r\n\r\n[2366] On his use of older lists of victors and especially of the Elean\r\nregister, see P. Hirt, _de Fontibus Pausaniae in Eliacis_ (Greifswald,\r\n1878), pp. 12 f.; Mie, _Quaestiones agonisticae_ (Rostock, 1888),\r\npp. 17 f.; Kalkmann, _Pausanias der Perieget_, pp. 72 f. and 103 f.;\r\nGurlitt, _Ueber Pausanias_, p. 426, note 43; Robert, _Hermes_, XXIII,\r\n1888, pp. 444 f.; Hirschfeld, _A.

Asklepiades\r\nof Corinth mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[2440] Foerster, pp. 26-30, records the names of 634 Olympic victors\r\nwho are known to us from all available sources.\r\n\r\n[2441] Sepulchral monuments are either entirely excluded or mentioned\r\nonly incidentally. The tombs of nine Olympic victors are known from\r\nvarious sources.\r\n\r\n[2442] The dating of victories in the present section will necessitate\r\ncertain repetitions of dates already given elsewhere in this work.\r\nWhile heretofore dates have been referred usually to the compilations\r\nof Foerster and Hyde, the original authorities for them will be cited\r\nin this section.\r\n\r\n[2443] Chionis, (= Charmis in Afr.), according to P., III, 14.3, won\r\nseven victories at Olympia: four in the στάδιον, in Ols. 28 to 31 (=\r\n668 to 656 B. C.); 1-4 = Afr.; 1 = P., IV, 23.4; 2 = IV, 23.10; 3 =\r\nVIII, 39.3; three in the δίαυλος, probably in Ols. (?) 29-31: see\r\nRutgers, p. 11, n. 4, and pp. 10-11; Hyde, 111 and p. 48; Foerster, 39,\r\n41-46.\r\n\r\n[2444] Kylon won the δίαυλος in Ol. 35 (= 640 B. C.): Afr.; _cf._\r\nRutgers p. 13; Foerster, 55.\r\n\r\n[2445] Hdt., V, 71; Thukyd., I, 126; Plut., _Solon_, 12.\r\n\r\n[2446] _A. M._, V, 1880, p. 27 and n. 1. Kuhnert, _Jahrb. f. classische\r\nPhilol._, Supplbd., XIV, 1885, pp. 278 f., and n. 2, agrees with\r\nFurtwaengler, and thinks that it was set up long after the death of\r\nKylon, and that it is possible that the name of the conspirator became\r\nmixed with that of an Athenian victor of the same name, but of later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[2447] _A. Z._, XXIV, 1866, pp. 183 f.; he is followed by Frazer, II,\r\np. 348.\r\n\r\n[2448] Thukyd., I, 134.\r\n\r\n[2449] Loeschke, _A.

C.): P., V, 8.9; Afr.; πάλη ἀνδρῶν in\r\nOls. 39-43 (= 624-608 B. C.): Afr.; Foerster, 60, 64, 66, 68, 71, 73.\r\nHe is mentioned by Ph., I.\r\n\r\n[2452] See Wide, _Lakonische Kulte_, 1893, pp. 38 f.; Hitz.-Bluemn., I,\r\n2, pp. 792-3.\r\n\r\n[2453] Pausanias, III, 13.9, mentions his five victories in πάλη. He\r\nmust have won after his father’s victories, and so at the beginning of\r\nthe sixth century B. C. Rutgers, pp. 109 f., conjectures that the first\r\nvictory was πάλη παίδων; Foerster, 86-90.\r\n\r\n[2454] Arrhachion (on various spellings of the name, _cf._ Rutgers, p.\r\n19) won thrice in the παγκράτιον in Ols. 52-54 (= 572-564 B. C.). The\r\nthird victory is recorded by Afr. and P., VIII, 40.1; the first two by\r\nP., _l. c._ _Cf._ also Ph., 21. Foerster, 98, 101, 103. See _supra_,\r\npp. 326 f.\r\n\r\n[2455] He had the nickname _Koalemos_: Plut., _Cimon_, 4. He won two\r\nvictories τεθρίππῳ in Ols. 62 and 64 (= 532 and 524 B. C.); his horses,\r\nunder the name of Peisistratos, won in the same event in Ol. 63 (= 528\r\nB. C.): Hdt., VI, 103; they were buried in front of the city beyond\r\nthe so-called “Hollow Way,” opposite the tomb of Kimon; Hdt., _l. c._;\r\nPlutarch, _Cato Major_, 5. _Cf._ Aelian, _de Animal._, XII, 40, where\r\nhe says that the mares of Miltiades—meaning Kimon—were buried in the\r\nKerameikos. See Foerster, 124, 128 and 132.\r\n\r\n[2456] _Var. Hist._, IX, 32.\r\n\r\n[2457] Hdt., VI, 103.\r\n\r\n[2458] IV, 33.\r\n\r\n[2459] On _Nubes_, 64.\r\n\r\n[2460] Foerster, 85.\r\n\r\n[2461] He won in an unknown contest. He accompanied Dorieus, the\r\nyounger brother of Kleomenes I of Sparta, on his futile expedition to\r\nSicily, and died there: Hdt., V, 47. Kleomenes began to reign in 519\r\nB. C., and the Sicilian expedition occurred about 510 B. C.; Foerster,\r\n138, therefore dates the victory of Philippos about Ol. 65 (= 520 B.\r\nC.).\r\n\r\n[2462] Hdt., V, 47; Eustath., on Iliad, Bk. III (p. 383, 43).\r\n\r\n[2463] Astylos (on variations of the name, see Rutgers, pp. 32 f.) won\r\nvictories in στάδιον and δίαυλος in three successive Ols.: P., VI,\r\n13.1: στάδιον in Ols. 73-75 (= 488-480 B. C.): 1 = Afr., and Dionys.\r\nHal., VIII, 1; 2 = Afr., and Dionys., VIII, 77; 3 = Afr., Dionys., IX,\r\n1, and Diod. Sic., XI, 1. So the victories in δίαυλος, 1, 2, 3, must\r\nhave been in the same Ols. The _Oxy. Pap._ also names Astylos a victor\r\ntwice as ὁπλίτης, in Ols. 75 and 76 (= 480 and 476 B. C.). So Grenfell\r\nand Hunt thought that P. had mixed the victories in δίαυλος and as\r\nὁπλίτης; Robert, _O. S._, pp. 163 f., however, supports P., and thinks\r\nthat Astylos won eight victories, the victories in δίαυλος and στάδιον\r\nall preceding Ol. 76, as other names appear here in the _Oxy. Pap._\r\nAstylos, therefore, won three victories in Ol. 75, one in Ol. 76, and\r\nthe other four in Ols. 73-74. _Cf._ Rutgers, pp. 32, 34-35; Foerster,\r\n176-177, 181-182, 187-188; Hyde, 110.\r\n\r\n[2464] Rutgers, p. 34, n. 1 (_cf._ Robert, _O.

C.): P., VI, 11.4; _Oxy.\r\nPap._; he was twice περιοδονίκης and won many victories elsewhere,\r\ncarrying off 1400 crowns, according to P., VI, 11.5, and 1200,\r\naccording to Plut., _Praec. reipub. ger._, 15, p. 811 D. _Cf._ Rutgers,\r\npp. 36, 38; Foerster, 191, 196; Hyde, 104.

C.): Robert, _O.\r\nS._, p. 165, because of an older dating for Myron, 480-444 B. C.,\r\nnecessitated by the _Oxy. Pap._ (see also _ibid._, p. 184). Foerster,\r\n249, has given Ol. (?) 85 (= 440 B.

G._, III, p. 473, no 125 and note, and\r\nRutgers p. 107.\r\n\r\n[2476] _A. Pl._, nos. 53, 54; see _supra_, Ch. IV, pp. 196-197.\r\n\r\n[2477] Foerster assumed that the statue by Myron stood in\r\nOlympia. Against this view, see Furtwaengler (_Mw._, p. 379, n. 5),\r\nKalkmann (_Jb._, X, 1895, p. 56, and XI, 1896, p. 197), Studniczka\r\n(article cited in note on Theagenes preceding), Brunn (_Sitzb. Muen.\r\nAkad._, 1880, pp. 474 f.). Benndorf (_de anthol. Gr. Epigram._, 1862,\r\n15, n. 1) thought it more probable that the statue stood formerly at\r\nOlympia, but in the time of Pausanias was in Rome. Thus it is best\r\nto assume two statues, the one in Argos not by Myron. Brunn (p. 475)\r\nshowed that Ladas was a Spartan because of P., III, 21. I and VIII,\r\n12.5; Benndorf (_op. cit._, p. 13) thought that he was an Argive.\r\nKuhnert (_Jahrbuecher f. cl. Philol._, Supplbd., XIV, p. 269 n. 13)\r\nargued that the Argive statue was set up by the Argive state, an\r\nimprobable assumption if Ladas were a Spartan. A different Ladas is the\r\nstade runner from Aigion, mentioned by P., III, 21.1, and X, 23.14.\r\n\r\n[2478] Kallias won παγκράτιον in Ol. 77 (= 472 B. C.): P. V, 9.3.\r\nHe was περιοδονίκης: _C. I. A._, I, 419. _Cf._ Foerster, 208; Hyde,\r\n50. Three other Athenian victors at Olympia named Kallias are known:\r\nKallias, son of Pheinippos, won κέλητι in Ol. 54 (= 564 B.

C.): Foerster, 186 a, 242, 247; Rutgers, p. 142; Kallias,\r\nmentioned by Polyb., XXVIII, 16, won παγκράτιον in the second century\r\nB. C.: _cf._ Foerster, under no. 208.\r\n\r\n[2479] Inscribed base found: _Inschr. v. Ol._, 146; _I. G. B._, 41.\r\n\r\n[2480] _C. I. A._, I, 419. The painter Mikon, mentioned by Pliny, _H.\r\nN._, XXXV, 59, is also named by him as a sculptor of athlete statues:\r\n_op. cit._, XXXIV, 88; he is also known from an inscription found on\r\nthe Akropolis at Athens: _C. I. A._, I, 418; _I. G. B._, 42.\r\n\r\n[2481] Diagoras won πύξ in Ol. 79 (= 464 B. C.): schol. on Pindar,\r\n_Ol._, VII, Argum., Boeckh, p. 157, and _Oxy. Pap._ He was\r\nπεριοδονίκης, and his other victories are mentioned by Pindar and the\r\nscholiast on the ode cited. On Diagoras, see H. van Gelder, _Geschichte\r\nder alten Rhodier_, 1900, p. 435; on Kallikles, see Robert, _O.

The date of his victory in the\r\nπαγκράτιον at Olympia can not be determined exactly. Although the\r\ndedication of Daochos occurred in the latter half of the fourth century\r\nB. C., the time of Lysippos (Preuner = between 339 and 331 B. C.: see\r\n_Ein delphisches Weihgeschenk_, 1900, p. 12; Homolle dates it more\r\nclosely between 338 and 334 B. C.; _B. C. H._, XXIII, 1899, 440), the\r\nvictory of Agias fell over a century earlier. Homolle proposed 428\r\nB. C. as the _floruit_ of Agias, but gave no date for his victory at\r\nOlympia; Preuner (p. 17) sets the victory before the middle of the\r\nfifth century B. C.; K. K. Smith (_Class. Phil._, 1910, pp. 169-174)\r\nhas proposed Ol. 80 (= 460 B. C.), the only lacuna for παγκράτιον in\r\nthe _Oxy. Pap._; however, Robert (_O. S._, p. 183) has placed Timodemos\r\nof Acharnai in that place. Foerster, 214, dates Timodemos Ol. (?) 78 (=\r\n468 B. C.).\r\n\r\n[2484] _Pharsalos_, p. 28. See _supra_, pp. 286-287.\r\n\r\n[2485] Cheimon won πάλη in Ol. 83 (= 448 B. C.): _Oxy. Pap._; _cf._\r\nRobert, _O. S._, pp. 171 and 191; Hyde, no. 88. Foerster, 285, had\r\nproposed Ol. (?) 94 (= 404 B. C.), on the basis of the older dating of\r\nNaukydes = 423-390 B. C. (see Robert, _Arch. Maerchen_, 1886, p. 107).\r\nKalkmann, _Pausanias der Perieget_, 1886, p. 192, n. 1, thought that\r\nthe statue at Olympia and the one at Rome were identical; Gurlitt,\r\n_Ueber Pausanias_, 1890, pp. 374 and 423, n. 38 a, has shown that the\r\nassumption is unfounded.\r\n\r\n[2486] The temple of Peace was built by Vespasian (between A. D. 70 and\r\n75) east of the _Forum Augusti_. Pliny (_H. N._, XXXIV, 84, and XXXV,\r\n102) mentions works of art in it; Josephus (_de Bell. Judaico_, VII,\r\n5.7) also describes it.\r\n\r\n[2487] Leon, according to Eustathius, on Iliad, II, 851 (= p. 361,\r\n10), won τεθρίππῳ in Ol. 85 (= 440 B. C.). This date is followed by\r\nSchubart, Pausanias und seine Anklaeger, _Jb. f. cl. Philol._, XXX,\r\n1884, p. 99, and Preger, _Inscript. Gr. metricae ex scriptoribus\r\npraeter anthologiam collectae_, (Lipsiae, 1891), on no. 128. He won\r\nin Ol. 89 (= 424 B. C.), according to Polemon (fragm. 22), the date\r\nfollowed by Foerster, 264 and 264 N. Foerster places Arkesilaos of\r\nSparta (= 250) as victor τεθρίππῳ in Ol. (?) 85; Hyde (13) places\r\nArkesilaos either in Ol. 86 or Ol. 87, leaving Ol. 85 free for Leon.\r\nPolemon (fragm. 22) calls Leon the “father of Antikleidas”; Preger,\r\n_op. cit._, p. 49, proposes the “son of Antikleidas,” thus having Leon\r\nwin with his father’s chariot. Bergk, _P. l. G._, III, p. 40, note,\r\nchanged the name to Antalkidas.\r\n\r\n[2488] Fragm., 22 (= schol. on Euripides, _Hippolytus_, 230); see _F.\r\nH. G._, III, p. 122; _cf._ _P. l.

Pausanias (VI,\r\n8.3) says that his Olympia statue was made before his victory. Ol. 104\r\nwas a non-Olympiad; see on no. 28 _infra_ (Xenodamos), p. 369 and notes.\r\n\r\n[2490] Aelian, _Var.

C.: Preger, _op. cit._, no. 144, on the basis of\r\nthe epigram. _Cf._ Foerster, 293a; Foerster, in another place, under\r\nno. 159, wrongly refers this same epigram (which he there ascribes to\r\nSimonides) to another unknown victor of Argos who won in some gymnic\r\ncontest, some time between Ols. 65 and 76 (= 527 and 476 B. C.), the\r\ndates of Simonides’ sojourn in Greece (_cf._ K. Sittl, _Gesch. d.\r\ngriech. Litt._, 1884-1887, III, pp. 59 f.).

D.) to enter the παγκράτιον, but ran away the day\r\nbefore the contest and was fined for cowardice; Sarapion of Magnesia\r\nad Sipylum, victor in an unknown contest and at an unknown date, known\r\nfrom an inscription from Tralles: _C. I. G._, II, 2933; Foerster, 824;\r\nRutgers, p. 156.\r\n\r\n[2527] M. Aurelios Demetrios won παγκράτιον some time before his son’s\r\nvictory in the same contest in Ol. 240 (= 181 A.

He dates the four last victories in Ols. (?) 232 and 233 (=\r\n149 and 153 A. D.).\r\n\r\nMost writers have identified the Granianos of Pausanias with Kranaos\r\nof Africanus, as both are from Sikyon; _cf._ Rutgers, p. 94 and n. 1.\r\nKalkmann, _Pausanias der Perieget_, p. 74, note 6, however, is doubtful\r\nof the identification.\r\n\r\n[2532] T.

Foerster, under nos. 788-792,\r\nexplains these words by arranging victories in δίαυλος, δόλιχος, and as\r\nὁπλίτης in one Olympiad, and two of these contests in the next; none\r\nof them could have been in στάδιον, since his name does not appear in\r\nAfricanus. _Cf._ Rutgers, pp. 105-106, 107, and 126.

C.); and 33\r\nmonuments (referred to 32 victors) from that date, to the close of the\r\ndescription of the athlete _periegesis_, i_. e._, from Ols. 107 to 149\r\n(= 352 to 184 B. C.). See Hyde, _op. cit._, Ch. IV, pp. 72 sq., and\r\n_supra_, pp. 352-3. (In my victor lists, _op. cit._, pp. 3-24, I have\r\nenumerated 188 victors; however, Philon of Kerkyra is listed twice,\r\nnos. 91 and 136, for two different statues.) Of these 153 monuments,\r\nnearly one-half (_i. e._, 74) belong properly to the fifth century\r\n(Ols. 70 to 94 = 500 to 404 B. C.).\r\n\r\n[2568] Pausanias mentions 192 (referred to 187 victors, as above);\r\nwe have found in the present chapter that 63 others (referred to 61\r\nvictors) are known from inscribed base fragments found at Olympia; and\r\nthat 47 (referred to 44 victors) are known from literary sources as\r\nhaving stood elsewhere. If we deduct 10 victors who had monuments both\r\nat Olympia and elsewhere, we have a grand total of 282 victors, in\r\nwhose honor these 302 monuments of various kinds were erected.\r\n\r\n[2569] See Hyde, pp. v-vi, for an alphabetic list of sculptors\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, or known from the recovered bases of statues at\r\nOlympia. See _supra_, p. 339, n. 1, end.\r\n\r\n[2570] Lysippos made two statues _honoris causa_ for Pythes, son of\r\nAndromachos, of Abdera: P., VI, 14.12; Hyde, 134a. Mikon made two\r\nstatues for King Hiero of Syracuse, one represented on foot and the\r\nother on horseback, which I have classed as “honor” statues: P., VI,\r\n12.2; Hyde, 105a. All the “honor” statues at Olympia named by Pausanias\r\nare listed in the work cited, on p. v.\r\n\r\n[2571] _H. N._, Bk. XXXIV, _passim_.
