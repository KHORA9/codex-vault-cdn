The one is to\r\ndescribe and differentiate the national parks in a manner which will\r\nenable the reader to appreciate their importance, scope, meaning,\r\nbeauty, manifold uses and enormous value to individual and nation. The\r\nother is to use these parks, in which Nature is writing in large plain\r\nlines the story of America's making, as examples illustrating the\r\nseveral kinds of scenery, and what each kind means in terms of world\r\nbuilding; in other words, to translate the practical findings of science\r\ninto unscientific phrase for the reader's increased profit and pleasure,\r\nnot only in his national parks but in all other scenic places great and\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nAt the outset I have been confronted with a difficulty because of this\r\ndouble objective. The role of the interpreter is not always welcome. If\r\nI write what is vaguely known as a \"popular\" book, wise men have warned\r\nme that any scientific intrusion, however lightly and dramatically\r\nrendered, will displease its natural audience. If I write the simplest\r\nof scientific books, I am warned that a large body of warm-blooded,\r\nwholesome, enthusiastic Americans, the very ones above all others whose\r\nkeen enjoyment I want to double by doubling their sources of pleasure,\r\nwill have none of it. The suggestion that I make my text \"popular\" and\r\ncarry my \"science\" in an appendix I promptly rejected, for if I cannot\r\ngive the scientific aspects of nature their readable values in the text,\r\nI cannot make them worth an appendix.\r\n\r\nNow I fail to share with my advisers their poor opinion of the taste,\r\nenterprise, and intelligence of the wide-awake American, but, for the\r\nsake of my message, I yield in some part to their warnings. Therefore I\r\nhave so presented my material that the miscalled, and, I verily believe,\r\nbadly slandered \"average reader,\" may have his \"popular\" book by\r\nomitting the note on the Appreciation of Scenery, and the several notes\r\nexplanatory of scenery which are interpolated between groups of\r\nchapters. If it is true, as I have been told, that the \"average reader\"\r\nwould omit these anyway, because it is his habit to omit prefaces and\r\nnotes of every kind, then nothing has been lost.\r\n\r\nThe keen inquiring reader, however, the reader who wants to know values\r\nand to get, in the eloquent phrase of the day, all that's coming to him,\r\nwill have the whole story by beginning the book with the note on the\r\nAppreciation of Scenery, and reading it consecutively, interpolated\r\nnotes and all. As this will involve less than a score of additional\r\npages, I hope to get the message of the national parks in terms of their\r\nfullest enjoyment before much the greater part of the book's readers.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of writing this book has many times repaid its cost in\r\nlabor, and any helpfulness it may have in advancing the popularity of\r\nour national parks, in building up the system's worth as a national\r\neconomic asset, and in increasing the people's pleasure in all scenery\r\nby helping them to appreciate their greatest scenery, will come to me as\r\npure profit. It is my earnest hope that this profit may be large.\r\n\r\nA similar spirit has actuated the very many who have helped me acquire\r\nthe knowledge and experience to produce it; the officials of the\r\nNational Park Service, the superintendents and several rangers in the\r\nnational parks, certain zoologists of the United States Biological\r\nSurvey, the Director and many geologists of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey, scientific experts of the Smithsonian Institution, and\r\nprofessors in several distinguished universities. Many men have been\r\npatient and untiring in assistance and helpful criticism, and to these I\r\nrender warm thanks for myself and for readers who may benefit by their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            PAGE\r\n\r\n    PREFACE                                                  vii\r\n\r\n         THE BOOK OF THE NATIONAL PARKS\r\n\r\n         ON THE APPRECIATION OF SCENERY                        3\r\n\r\n      I.

To him, the\r\nglacier-hollowed valley of Yosemite, the stream-scooped abyss of the\r\nGrand Canyon, the volcanic gulf of Crater Lake, the bristling granite\r\ncore of the Rockies, and the ancient ice-carved shales of Glacier\r\nNational Park all are one--just scenery, magnificent, incomparable,\r\nmeaningless. As a people we have been content to wonder, not to know;\r\nyet with scenery, as with all else, to know is to begin fully to enjoy.\r\nAppreciation measures enjoyment. And this brings me to my proposition,\r\nnamely, that we shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest\r\nscenery in the world until we realize that scenery is the written page\r\nof the History of Creation, and until we learn to read that page.\r\n\r\nThe national parks of America include areas of the noblest and most\r\ndiversified scenic sublimity easily accessible in the world;\r\nnevertheless it is their chiefest glory that they are among the\r\ncompletest expressions of the earth's history. The American people is\r\nwaking rapidly to the magnitude of its scenic possession; it has yet to\r\nlearn to appreciate it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless we love scenery. We are a nation of sightseers. The year\r\nbefore the world war stopped all things, we spent $286,000,000 in going\r\nto Europe. That summer Switzerland's receipts from the sale of\r\ntransportation and board to persons coming from foreign lands to see her\r\nscenery was $100,000,000, and more than half, it has been stated\r\napparently with authority, came from America. That same year tourist\r\ntravel became Canada's fourth largest source of income, exceeding in\r\ngross receipts even her fisheries, and the greater part came from the\r\nUnited States; it is a matter of record that seven-tenths of the hotel\r\nregistrations in the Canadian Rockies were from south of the border. Had\r\nwe then known, as a nation, that there was just as good scenery of its\r\nkind in the United States, and many more kinds, we would have gone to\r\nsee that; it is a national trait to buy the best. Since then, we have\r\ndiscovered this important fact and are crowding to our national parks.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true,\" a woman asked me at the foot of Yosemite Falls, \"that this\r\nis the highest unbroken waterfall in the world?\"\r\n\r\nShe was the average tourist, met there by chance. I assured her that\r\nsuch was the fact. I called attention to the apparent deliberation of\r\nthe water's fall, a trick of the senses resulting from failure to\r\nrealize height and distance.\r\n\r\n\"To think they are the highest in the world!\" she mused.\r\n\r\nI told her that the soft fingers of water had carved this valley three\r\nthousand feet into the solid granite, and that ice had polished its\r\nwalls, and I estimated for her the ages since the Merced River flowed at\r\nthe level of the cataract's brink.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen the tallest building in the world,\" she replied dreamily,\r\n\"and the longest railroad, and the largest lake, and the highest\r\nmonument, and the biggest department store, and now I see the highest\r\nwaterfall. Just think of it!\"\r\n\r\nIf one has illusions concerning the average tourist, let him compare the\r\nhundreds who gape at the paint pots and geysers of Yellowstone with the\r\ndozens who exult in the sublimated glory of the colorful canyon. Or let\r\nhim listen to the table-talk of a party returned from Crater Lake. Or\r\nlet him recall the statistical superlatives which made up his friend's\r\nlast letter from the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nI am not condemning wonder, which, in its place, is a legitimate and\r\npleasurable emotion. As a condiment to sharpen and accent an abounding\r\nsense of beauty it has real and abiding value.\r\n\r\nLove of beauty is practically a universal passion. It is that which\r\nlures millions into the fields, valleys, woods, and mountains on every\r\nholiday, which crowds our ocean lanes and railroads. The fact that few\r\nof these rejoicing millions are aware of their own motive, and that,\r\nstrangely enough, a few even would be ashamed to make the admission if\r\nthey became aware of it, has nothing to do with the fact. It's a wise\r\nman that knows his own motives. The fact that still fewer, whether\r\naware or not of the reason of their happiness, are capable of making the\r\nleast expression of it, also has nothing to do with the fact. The\r\ntourist woman whom I met at the foot of Yosemite Falls may have felt\r\nsecretly suffocated by the filmy grandeur of the incomparable spectacle,\r\nnotwithstanding that she was conscious of no higher emotion than the\r\ncheap wonder of a superlative. The Grand Canyon's rim is the stillest\r\ncrowded place I know. I've stood among a hundred people on a precipice\r\nand heard the whir of a bird's wings in the abyss. Probably the majority\r\nof those silent gazers were suffering something akin to pain at their\r\ninability to give vent to the emotions bursting within them.\r\n\r\nI believe that the statement can not be successfully challenged that, as\r\na people, our enjoyment of scenery is almost wholly emotional. Love of\r\nbeauty spiced by wonder is the equipment for enjoyment of the average\r\nintelligent traveller of to-day. Now add to this a more or less equal\r\npart of the intellectual pleasure of comprehension and you have the\r\nequipment of the average intelligent traveller of to-morrow. To hasten\r\nthis to-morrow is one of the several objects of this book.\r\n\r\nTo see in the carved and colorful depths of the Grand Canyon not only\r\nthe stupendous abyss whose terrible beauty grips the soul, but also\r\nto-day's chapter in a thrilling story of creation whose beginning lay\r\nuntold centuries back in the ages, whose scene covers three hundred\r\nthousand square miles of our wonderful southwest, whose actors include\r\nthe greatest forces of nature, whose tremendous episodes shame the\r\nimagination of Dore, and whose logical end invites suggestions before\r\nwhich finite minds shrink--this is to come into the presence of the\r\ngreat spectacle properly equipped for its enjoyment. But how many who\r\nsee the Grand Canyon get more out of it than merely the beauty that\r\ngrips the soul?\r\n\r\nSo it is throughout the world of scenery. The geologic story written on\r\nthe cliffs of Crater Lake is more stupendous even than the glory of its\r\nindigo bowl. The war of titanic forces described in simple language on\r\nthe rocks of Glacier National Park is unexcelled in sublimity in the\r\nhistory of mankind. The story of Yellowstone's making multiplies many\r\ntimes the thrill occasioned by its world-famed spectacle. Even the\r\nsimplest and smallest rock details often tell thrilling incidents of\r\nprehistoric tunes out of which the enlightened imagination reconstructs\r\nthe romances and the tragedies of earth's earlier days.\r\n\r\nHow eloquent, for example, was the small, water-worn fragment of dull\r\ncoal we found on the limestone slope of one of Glacier's mountains!\r\nImpossible companionship! The one the product of forest, the other of\r\nsubmerged depths. Instantly I glimpsed the distant age when thousands of\r\nfeet above the very spot upon which I stood, but then at sea level,\r\nbloomed a Cretaceous forest, whose broken trunks and matted foliage\r\ndecayed in bogs where they slowly turned to coal; coal which, exposed\r\nand disintegrated during intervening ages, has long since--all but a\r\nfew small fragments like this--washed into the headwaters of the\r\nSaskatchewan to merge eventually in the muds of Hudson Bay. And then,\r\nstill dreaming, my mind leaped millions of years still further back to\r\nlake bottoms where, ten thousand feet below the spot on which I stood,\r\ngathered the pre-Cambrian ooze which later hardened to this very\r\nlimestone. From ooze a score of thousand feet, a hundred million years,\r\nto coal! And both lie here together now in my palm! Filled thus with\r\nvisions of a perspective beyond human comprehension, with what\r\nmultiplied intensity of interest I now returned to the noble view from\r\nGable Mountain!\r\n\r\nIn pleading for a higher understanding of Nature's method and\r\naccomplishment as a precedent to study and observation of our national\r\nparks, I seek enormously to enrich the enjoyment not only of these\r\nsupreme examples but of all examples of world making. The same readings\r\nwhich will prepare you to enjoy to the full the message of our national\r\nparks will invest your neighborhood hills at home, your creek and river\r\nand prairie, your vacation valleys, the landscape through your car\r\nwindow, even your wayside ditch, with living interest. I invite you to a\r\nnew and fascinating earth, an earth interesting, vital, personal,\r\nbeloved, because at last known and understood!\r\n\r\nIt requires no great study to know and understand the earth well enough\r\nfor such purpose as this. One does not have to dim his eyes with acres\r\nof maps, or become a plodding geologist, or learn to distinguish\r\nschists from granites, or to classify plants by table, or to call wild\r\ngeese and marmots by their Latin names. It is true that geography,\r\ngeology, physiography, mineralogy, botany and zoology must each\r\ncontribute their share toward the condition of intelligence which will\r\nenable you to realize appreciation of Nature's amazing earth, but the\r\nshare of each is so small that the problem will be solved, not by\r\nexhaustive study, but by the selection of essential parts. Two or three\r\npopular books which interpret natural science in perspective should\r\npleasurably accomplish your purpose. But once begun, I predict that few\r\nwill fail to carry certain subjects beyond the mere essentials, while\r\nsome will enter for life into a land of new delights.\r\n\r\nLet us, for illustration, consider for a moment the making of America.\r\nThe earth, composed of countless aggregations of matter drawn together\r\nfrom the skies, whirled into a globe, settled into a solid mass\r\nsurrounded by an atmosphere carrying water like a sponge, has reached\r\nthe stage of development when land and sea have divided the surface\r\nbetween them, and successions of heat and frost, snow, ice, rain, and\r\nflood, are busy with their ceaseless carving of the land. Already\r\nmountains are wearing down and sea bottoms are building up with their\r\nrefuse. Sediments carried by the rivers are depositing in strata, which\r\nsome day will harden into rock.\r\n\r\nWe are looking now at the close of the era which geologists call\r\nArchean, because it is ancient beyond knowledge. A few of its rocks are\r\nknown, but not well enough for many definite conclusions. All the\r\nearth's vast mysterious past is lumped under this title.\r\n\r\nThe definite history of the earth begins with the close of the dim\r\nArchean era. It is the lapse from then till now, a few hundred million\r\nyears at most out of all infinity, which ever can greatly concern man,\r\nfor during this time were laid the only rocks whose reading was assisted\r\nby the presence of fossils. During this time the continents attained\r\ntheir final shape, the mountains rose, and valleys, plains, and rivers\r\nformed and re-formed many times before assuming the passing forms which\r\nthey now show. During this time also life evolved from its inferred\r\nbeginnings in the late Archean to the complicated, finely developed, and\r\nin man's case highly mentalized and spiritualized organization of\r\nTo-day.\r\n\r\nSurely the geologist's field of labor is replete with interest,\r\ninspiration, even romance. But because it has become so saturated with\r\ntechnicality as to become almost a popular bugaboo, let us attempt no\r\nspecial study, but rather cull from its voluminous records those simple\r\nfacts and perspectives which will reveal to us this greatest of all\r\nstory books, our old earth, as the volume of enchantment that it really\r\nis.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the Archean, the earth had not yet settled into the\r\nperfectly balanced sphere which Nature destined it to be. In some places\r\nthe rock was more compactly squeezed than in others, and these denser\r\nmasses eventually were forced violently into neighbor masses which were\r\nnot so tightly squeezed. These movements far below the surface shifted\r\nthe surface balance and became one of many complicated and little known\r\ncauses impelling the crust here to slowly rise and there to slowly fall.\r\nThus in places sea bottoms lifted above the surface and became land,\r\nwhile lands elsewhere settled and became seas. There are areas which\r\nhave alternated many times between land and sea; this is why we find\r\nlimestones which were formed in the sea overlying shales which were\r\nformed in fresh water, which in turn overlie sandstones which once were\r\nbeaches--all these now in plateaus thousands of feet above the ocean's\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nSometimes these mysterious internal forces lifted the surface in long\r\nwaves. Thus mountain chains and mountain systems were created. Often\r\ntheir summits, worn down by frosts and rains, disclose the core of rock\r\nwhich, ages before, then hot and fluid, had underlain the crust and bent\r\nit upward into mountain form. Now, cold and hard, these masses are\r\ndisclosed as the granite of to-day's landscape, or as other igneous\r\nrocks of earth's interior which now cover broad surface areas, mingled\r\nwith the stratified or water-made rocks which the surface only produces.\r\nBut this has not always been the fate of the under-surface molten rocks,\r\nfor sometimes they have burst by volcanic vents clear through the crust\r\nof earth, where, turned instantly to pumice and lava by release from\r\npressure, they build great surface cones, cover broad plains and fill\r\nbasins and valleys.\r\n\r\nThus were created the three great divisions of the rocks which form the\r\nthree great divisions of scenery, the sediments, the granites, and the\r\nlavas.\r\n\r\nDuring these changes in the levels of enormous surface areas, the frosts\r\nand water have been industriously working down the elevations of the\r\nland. Nature forever seeks a level. The snows of winter, melting at\r\nmidday, sink into the rocks' minutest cracks. Expanded by the frosts,\r\nthe imprisoned water pries open and chips the surface. The rains of\r\nspring and summer wash the chippings and other debris into rivulets,\r\nwhich carry them into mountain torrents, which rush them into rivers,\r\nwhich sweep them into oceans, which deposit them for the upbuilding of\r\nthe bottoms. Always the level! Thousands of square miles of California\r\nwere built up from ocean's bottom with sediments chiselled from the\r\nmountains of Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah, and swept seaward through the\r\nGrand Canyon.\r\n\r\nThese mills grind without rest or pause. The atmosphere gathers the\r\nmoisture from the sea, the winds roll it in clouds to the land, the\r\nmountains catch and chill the clouds, and the resulting rains hurry back\r\nto the sea in rivers bearing heavy freights of soil. Spring, summer,\r\nautumn, winter, day and night, the mills of Nature labor unceasingly to\r\nproduce her level. If ever this earth is really finished to Nature's\r\nliking, it will be as round and polished as a billiard ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Bailey Willis_\r\n\r\nMIDDLE FORK OF THE BELLY RIVER, GLACIER NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nVery ancient shales and limestone fantastically carved by glaciers. The\r\nillustration shows Glenns Lake, Pyramid Peak, Chaney Glacier, and Mount\r\nKipp]\r\n\r\nYears mean nothing in the computation of the prehistoric past. Who can\r\nconceive a thousand centuries, to say nothing of a million years? Yet\r\neither is inconsiderable against the total lapse of time even from the\r\nArchean's close till now.\r\n\r\nAnd so geologists have devised an easier method of count, measured not\r\nby units of time, but by what each phase of progress has accomplished.\r\nThis measure is set forth in the accompanying table, together with a\r\nconjecture concerning the lapse of time in terms of years.\r\n\r\nThe most illuminating accomplishment of the table, however, is its\r\nbird's-eye view of the procession of the evolution of life from the\r\nfirst inference of its existence to its climax of to-day; and,\r\nconcurrent with this progress, its suggestion of the growth and\r\ndevelopment of scenic America. It is, in effect, the table of contents\r\nof a volume whose thrilling text and stupendous illustration are\r\nengraved immortally in the rocks; a volume whose ultimate secrets the\r\nscholarship of all time perhaps will never fully decipher, but whose\r\ndramatic outlines and many of whose most thrilling incidents are open to\r\nall at the expense of a little study at home and a little thoughtful\r\nseeing in the places where the facts are pictured in lines so big and\r\ngraphic that none may miss their meanings.\r\n\r\nMan's colossal egotism is rudely shaken before the Procession of the\r\nAges. Aghast, he discovers that the billions of years which have wrought\r\nthis earth from star dust were not merely God's laborious preparation\r\nof a habitation fit for so admirable an occupant; that man, on the\r\ncontrary, is nothing more or less than the present master tenant of\r\nearth, the highest type of hundreds of millions of years of succeeding\r\ntenants only because he is the latest in evolution.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF CREATION\r\n\r\n     Chart of the Divisions of Geologic Time, and an Estimate in Years\r\n     based on the assumption that a hundred million years have elapsed\r\n     since the close of the Archean Period, together with a condensed\r\n     table of the Evolution of Life from its Inferred Beginnings in the\r\n     Archean to the Present Time.

The recent tendency has been greatly to increase\r\n     conceptions of geologic time over the highly conservative estimates\r\n     of a few years ago, and a strong disposition is shown to regard the\r\n     Algonkian period as one of very great length, extremists even\r\n     suggesting that it may have equalled all time since. For the\r\n     purposes of this popular book, then, let us conceive that the earth\r\n     has existed for a hundred million years since Archean times, and\r\n     that one-third of this was Algonkian; and let us apportion the\r\n     two-thirds remaining among succeeding eras in the average of the\r\n     proportions adopted by Professor Joseph Barrell of Yale University,\r\n     whose recent speculations upon geologic time have attracted wide\r\n     attention.\r\n\r\nFantastic, you may say. It is fantastic. So far as I know there exists\r\nnot one fact upon which definite predictions such as these may be based.\r\nBut also there exists not one fact which warrants specific denial of\r\npredictions such as these. And if any inference whatever may be made\r\nfrom earth's history it is the inevitable inference that the period in\r\nwhich man lives is merely one step in an evolution of matter, mind and\r\nspirit which looks forward to changes as mighty or mightier than those I\r\nhave suggested.\r\n\r\nWith so inspiring an outline, the study to which I invite you can be\r\nnothing but pleasurable. Space does not permit the development of the\r\ntheme in the pages which follow, but the book will have failed if it\r\ndoes not, incidental to its main purposes, entangle the reader in the\r\ncharm of America's adventurous past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL PARKS OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Parks of the United States are areas of supreme scenic\r\nsplendor or other unique quality which Congress has set apart for the\r\npleasure and benefit of the people. At this writing they number\r\neighteen, sixteen of which lie within the boundaries of the United\r\nStates and are reached by rail and road. Those of greater importance\r\nhave excellent roads, good trails, and hotels or hotel camps, or both,\r\nfor the accommodation of visitors; also public camp grounds where\r\nvisitors may pitch their own tents. Outside the United States there are\r\ntwo national parks, one enclosing three celebrated volcanic craters, the\r\nother conserving the loftiest mountain on the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe starting point for any consideration of our national parks\r\nnecessarily is the recently realized fact of their supremacy in world\r\nscenery. It was the sensational force of this realization which\r\nintensely attracted public attention at the outset of the new movement;\r\nmany thousands hastened to see these wonders, and their reports spread\r\nthe tidings throughout the land and gave the movement its increasing\r\nimpetus.\r\n\r\nThe simple facts are these:\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Alps, except for several unmatchable individual features, are\r\nexcelled in beauty, sublimity and variety by several of our own national\r\nparks, and these same parks possess other distinguished individual\r\nfeatures unrepresented in kind or splendor in the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Rockies are more than matched in rich coloring by our\r\nGlacier National Park. Glacier is the Canadian Rockies done in Grand\r\nCanyon colors. It has no peer.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone outranks by far any similar volcanic area in the world.\r\nIt contains more and greater geysers than all the rest of the world\r\ntogether; the next in rank are divided between Iceland and New Zealand.\r\nIts famous canyon is alone of its quality of beauty. Except for portions\r\nof the African jungle, the Yellowstone is probably the most populated\r\nwild animal area in the world, and its wild animals are comparatively\r\nfearless, even sometimes friendly.\r\n\r\nMount Rainier has a single-peak glacier system whose equal has not yet\r\nbeen discovered. Twenty-eight living glaciers, some of them very large,\r\nspread, octopus-like, from its centre. It is four hours by rail or motor\r\nfrom Tacoma.\r\n\r\nCrater Lake is the deepest and bluest accessible lake in the world,\r\noccupying the hole left after one of our largest volcanoes had slipped\r\nback into earth's interior through its own rim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL GRANT TREE\r\n\r\nIt has a National Park all to itself]\r\n\r\nYosemite possesses a valley whose compelling beauty the world\r\nacknowledges as supreme. The valley is the centre of eleven hundred\r\nsquare miles of high altitude wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe Sequoia contains more than a million sequoia trees, twelve thousand\r\nof which are more than ten feet in diameter, and some of which are the\r\nlargest and oldest living things in the wide world.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon of Arizona is by far the hugest and noblest example of\r\nerosion in the world. It is gorgeously carved and colored. In sheer\r\nsublimity it offers an unequalled spectacle.\r\n\r\nMount McKinley stands more than 20,000 feet above sea level, and 17,000\r\nfeet above the surrounding valleys. Scenically, it is the world's\r\nloftiest mountain, for the monsters of the Andes and the Himalayas which\r\nsurpass it in altitude can be viewed closely only from valleys from five\r\nto ten thousand feet higher than McKinley's northern valleys.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaii National Park contains the fourth greatest dead crater in the\r\nworld, the hugest living volcano, and the Kilauea Lake of Fire, which is\r\nunique and draws visitors from the world's four quarters.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal features of America's world supremacy. They are\r\nincidental to a system of scenic wildernesses which in combined area as\r\nwell as variety exceed the combined scenic wilderness playgrounds of\r\nsimilar class comfortably accessible elsewhere. No wonder, then, that\r\nthe American public is overjoyed with its recently realized treasure,\r\nand that the Government looks confidently to the rapid development of\r\nits new-found economic asset. The American public has discovered\r\nAmerica, and no one who knows the American public doubts for a moment\r\nwhat it will do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe idea still widely obtains that our national parks are principally\r\nplaygrounds. A distinguished member of Congress recently asked: \"Why\r\nmake these appropriations? More people visited Rock Creek Park here in\r\nthe city of Washington last Sunday afternoon than went to the Yosemite\r\nall last summer. The country has endless woods and mountains which cost\r\nthe Treasury nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThis view entirely misses the point. The national parks are\r\nrecreational, of course. So are state, county and city parks. So are\r\nresorts of every kind. So are the fields, the woods, the seashore, the\r\nopen country everywhere. We are living in an open-air age. The nation of\r\noutdoor livers is a nation of power, initiative, and sanity. I hope to\r\nsee the time when available State lands everywhere, when every square\r\nmile from our national forest reserve, when even many private holdings\r\nare made accessible and comfortable, and become habited with summer\r\ntrampers and campers. It is the way to individual power and national\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nBut the national parks are far more than recreational areas. They are\r\nthe supreme examples. They are the gallery of masterpieces. Here the\r\nvisitor enters in a holier spirit. Here is inspiration. They are also\r\nthe museums of the ages. Here nature is still creating the earth upon a\r\nscale so vast and so plain that even the dull and the frivolous cannot\r\nfail to see and comprehend.\r\n\r\nThis is no distinction without a difference. The difference is so marked\r\nthat few indeed even of those who visit our national parks in a\r\nfrivolous or merely recreational mood remain in that mood. The spirit of\r\nthe great places brooks nothing short of silent reverence. I have seen\r\nmen unconsciously lift their hats. The mind strips itself of affairs as\r\none sheds a coat. It is the hour of the spirit. One returns to daily\r\nliving with a springier step, a keener vision, and a broader horizon for\r\nhaving worshipped at the shrine of the Infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Coast Expositions of 1915 marked the beginning of the\r\nnation's acquaintance with its national parks. In fact, they were the\r\noccasion, if not the cause, of the movement for national parks\r\ndevelopment which found so quickly a country-wide response, and which is\r\ndestined to results of large importance to individual and nation alike.\r\nBecause thousands of those whom the expositions were expected to draw\r\nwestward would avail of the opportunity to visit national parks,\r\nSecretary Lane, to whom the national parks suggested neglected\r\nopportunity requiring business experience to develop, induced Stephen T.\r\nMather, a Chicago business man with mountain-top enthusiasms, to\r\nundertake their preparation for the unaccustomed throngs. Mr. Mather's\r\nvision embraced a correlated system of superlative scenic areas which\r\nshould become the familiar playgrounds of the whole American people, a\r\nsystem which, if organized and administered with the efficiency of a\r\ngreat business, should even become, in time, the rendezvous of the\r\nsightseers of the world. He foresaw in the national parks a new and\r\ngreat national economic asset.\r\n\r\nThe educational and other propaganda by which this movement was\r\npresented to the people, which the writer had the honor to plan and\r\nexecute, won rapidly the wide support of the public. To me the national\r\nparks appealed powerfully as the potential museums and classrooms for\r\nthe popular study of the natural forces which made, and still are\r\nmaking, America, and of American fauna and flora. Here were set forth,\r\nin fascinating picture and lines so plain that none could fail to read\r\nand understand, the essentials of sciences whose real charm our rapid\r\neducational methods impart to few. This book is the logical outgrowth of\r\na close study of the national parks, beginning with the inception of the\r\nnew movement, from this point of view.\r\n\r\nHow free from the partisan considerations common in governmental\r\norganization was the birth of the movement is shown by an incident of\r\nMr. Mather's inauguration into his assistant secretaryship. Secretary\r\nLane had seen him at his desk and had started back to his own room. But\r\nhe returned, looked in at the door, and asked:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Haynes, St. Paul_\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT GEYSER--GREATEST IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nYellowstone National Park]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by the way, Steve, what are your politics?\"\r\n\r\nThis book considers our national parks as they line up four years after\r\nthe beginning of this movement. It shows them well started upon the long\r\nroad to realization, with Congress, Government, and the people united\r\ntoward a common end, with the schools and the universities interested,\r\nand, for the first time, with the railroads, the concessioners, the\r\nmotoring interests, and many of the public-spirited educational and\r\noutdoor associations all pulling together under the inspiration of a\r\nrecognized common motive.\r\n\r\nOf course this triumph of organization, for it is no less, could not\r\nhave been accomplished nearly so quickly without the assistance of the\r\nclosing of Europe by the great war. Previous to 1915, Americans had been\r\nspending $300,000,000 a year in European travel. Nor could it have been\r\naccomplished at all if investigation and comparison had not shown that\r\nour national parks excel in supreme scenic quality and variety the\r\ncombined scenery which is comfortably accessible in all the rest of the\r\nworld together.\r\n\r\nTo get the situation at the beginning of our book into full perspective,\r\nit must be recognized that, previous to the beginning of our propaganda\r\nin 1915, the national parks, as such, scarcely existed in the public\r\nconsciousness. Few Americans could name more than two or three of the\r\nfourteen existing parks. The Yosemite Valley and the Yellowstone alone\r\nwere generally known, but scarcely as national parks; most of the\r\nschool geographies which mentioned them at all ignored their national\r\ncharacter. The advertising folders of competing railroads were the\r\nprincipal sources of public knowledge, for few indeed asked for the\r\ncompilation of rates and charges which the Government then sent in\r\nresponse to inquiries for information. The parks had practically no\r\nadministration. The business necessarily connected with their upkeep and\r\ndevelopment was done by clerks as minor and troublesome details which\r\ndistracted attention from more important duties; there was no one clerk\r\nwhose entire concern was with the national parks. The American public\r\nstill looked confidently upon the Alps as the supreme scenic area in the\r\nworld, and hoped some day to see the Canadian Rockies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOriginally the motive in park-making had been unalloyed conservation. It\r\nis as if Congress had said: \"Let us lock this up where no one can run\r\naway with it; we don't need it now, but some day it may be valuable.\"\r\nThat was the instinct that led to the reservation of the Hot Springs of\r\nArkansas in 1832, the first national park. Forty years later, when\r\nofficial investigation proved the truth of the amazing tales of\r\nYellowstone's natural wonders, it was the instinct which led to the\r\nreservation of that largely unexplored area as the second national park.\r\nSeventeen years after Yellowstone, when newspapers and scientific\r\nmagazines recounted the ethnological importance of the Casa Grande Ruin\r\nin Arizona, it resulted in the creation of the third national park,\r\nnotwithstanding that the area so conserved enclosed less than a square\r\nmile, which contained nothing of the kind and quality which to-day we\r\nrecognize as essential to parkhood. This closed what may be regarded as\r\nthe initial period of national parks conservation. It was wholly\r\ninstinctive; distinctions, objectives, and policies were undreamed of.\r\n\r\nLess than two years after Casa Grande, which, by the way, has recently\r\nbeen re-classed a national monument, what may be called the middle\r\nperiod began brilliantly with the creation, in 1890, of the Yosemite,\r\nthe Sequoia, and the General Grant National Parks, all parks in the true\r\nsense of the word, and all of the first order of scenic magnificence.\r\nNine years later Mount Rainier was added, and two years after that\r\nwonderful Crater Lake, both meeting fully the new standard.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was human and natural. The term national park had begun to\r\nmean something in the neighborhoods of the parks. Yellowstone and\r\nYosemite had long been household words, and the introduction of other\r\nareas to their distinguished company fired local pride in neighboring\r\nstates. \"Why should we not have national parks, too?\" people asked.\r\nCongress, always the reflection of the popular will, and therefore not\r\nalways abreast of the moment, was unprepared with reasons. Thus, during\r\n1903 and 1904, there were added to the list areas in North Dakota,\r\nSouth Dakota, and Oklahoma, which were better fitted for State parks\r\nthan for association with the distinguished company of the nation's\r\nnoblest.\r\n\r\nA reaction followed and resulted in what we may call the modern period.\r\nFar-sighted men in and out of Congress began to compare and look ahead.\r\nNo hint yet of the splendid destiny of our national parks, now so\r\nclearly defined, entered the minds of these men at this time, but ideas\r\nof selection, of development and utilization undoubtedly began to take\r\nform. At least, conservation, as such, ceased to become a sole motive.\r\nInsensibly Congress, or at least a few men of vision in Congress, began\r\nto take account of stock and figure on realization.\r\n\r\nThis healthy growth was helped materially by the public demand for the\r\nimprovement of several of the national parks. No thought of\r\nappropriating money to improve the bathing facilities of Hot Springs had\r\naffected Congressional action for nearly half a century; it was enough\r\nthat the curative springs had been saved from private ownership.\r\nYellowstone was considered so altogether extraordinary, however, that\r\nCongress began in 1879 to appropriate yearly for its approach by road,\r\nand for the protection of its springs and geysers; but this was because\r\nYellowstone appealed to the public sense of wonder. It took twenty years\r\nmore for Congress to understand that the public sense of beauty was also\r\nworth appropriations. Yosemite had been a national park for nine years\r\nbefore it received a dollar, and then only when public demand for roads,\r\ntrails, and accommodations became insistent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Pillsbury_\r\n\r\nTHE YOSEMITE FALLS--HIGHEST IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nFrom the brink of the upper falls to the foot of the lower falls is\r\nalmost half a mile]\r\n\r\nBut, once born, the idea took root and spread. It was fed by the press\r\nand magazine reports of the glories of the newer national parks, then\r\nattracting some public attention. It helped discrimination in the\r\ncomparison of the minor parks created in 1903 and 1904 with the greater\r\nones which had preceded. The realization that the parks must be\r\ndeveloped at public expense sharpened Congressional judgment as to what\r\nareas should and should not become national parks.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on Congress has made no mistakes in selecting national\r\nparks. Mesa Verde became a park in 1905, Glacier in 1910, Rocky Mountain\r\nin 1915, Hawaii and Lassen Volcanic in 1916, Mount McKinley in 1917, and\r\nLafayette and the Grand Canyon in 1919. From that time on Congress, most\r\nconservatively, it is true, has backed its judgment with increasing\r\nappropriations. And in 1916 it created the National Park Service, a\r\nbureau of the Department of the Interior, to administer them in\r\naccordance with a definite policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the national forests and the national parks is\r\nessential to understanding. The national forests constitute an enormous\r\ndomain administered for the economic commercialization of the nation's\r\nwealth of lumber. Its forests are handled scientifically with the object\r\nof securing the largest annual lumber output consistent with the proper\r\nconservation of the future. Its spirit is commercial. The spirit of\r\nnational park conservation is exactly opposite. It seeks no great\r\nterritory--only those few spots which are supreme. It aims to preserve\r\nnature's handiwork exactly as nature made it. No tree is cut except to\r\nmake way for road, trail or hotel to enable the visitor to penetrate and\r\nlive among nature's secrets. Hunting is excellent in some of our\r\nnational forests, but there is no game in the national parks; in these,\r\nwild animals are a part of nature's exhibits; they are protected as\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIt follows that forests and parks, so different in spirit and purpose,\r\nmust be handled wholly separately. Even the rangers and scientific\r\nexperts have objects so opposite and different that the same individual\r\ncannot efficiently serve both purposes. High specialization in both\r\nservices is essential to success.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL PARKS AT A GLANCE\r\n\r\n[Number, 18; total area, 10,739 square miles]\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNATIONAL PARKS |                 | AREA IN|\r\nIN ORDER       |    LOCATION     | SQUARE | DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS\r\nOF CREATION    |                 | MILES  |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHot Springs,   | Middle Arkansas | 1-1/2  | 46 hot springs possessing\r\n1832           |                 |        | curative properties--Many\r\n               |                 |        | hotels and boarding houses--20\r\n               |                 |        | bath-houses under public\r\n               |                 |        | control.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nYellowstone,   | Northwestern    |  3,348 | More geysers than in all rest\r\n1872           |  Wyoming        |        | of world together--Boiling\r\n               |                 |        | springs--Mud\r\n               |                 |        | volcanoes--Petrified\r\n               |                 |        | forests--Grand Canyon of the\r\n               |                 |        | Yellowstone, remarkable for\r\n               |                 |        | gorgeous coloring--Large\r\n               |                 |        | lakes--Many large streams and\r\n               |                 |        | waterfalls--Greatest wild bird\r\n               |                 |        | and animal preserve in world.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nSequoia, 1890  | Middle eastern  |   252  | The Big Tree National\r\n               |  California     |        | Park--12,000 sequoia trees\r\n               |                 |        | over 10 feet in diameter, some\r\n               |                 |        | 25 to 36 feet in\r\n               |                 |        | diameter--Towering mountain\r\n               |                 |        | ranges--Startling\r\n               |                 |        | precipices--Large limestone\r\n               |                 |        | cave.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nYosemite, 1890 | Middle eastern  |  1,125 | Valley of world-famed\r\n               |  California     |        | beauty--Lofty cliffs--Romantic\r\n               |                 |        | vistas--Many waterfalls of\r\n               |                 |        | extraordinary height--3 groves\r\n               |                 |        | of big trees--High\r\n               |                 |        | Sierra--Waterwheel falls.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nGeneral Grant, | Middle eastern  |    4   | Created to preserve the\r\n1890           |  California     |        | celebrated General Grant\r\n               |                 |        | Tree, 35 feet in diameter--6\r\n               |                 |        | miles from Sequoia National\r\n               |                 |        | Park.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nMount Rainier, | West central    |   324  | Largest accessible single peak\r\n1899           |  Washington     |        | glacier system--28 glaciers,\r\n               |                 |        | some of large size--48 square\r\n               |                 |        | miles of glacier, 50 to 500\r\n               |                 |        | feet thick--Wonderful\r\n               |                 |        | sub-alpine wild flower fields.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nCrater Lake,   | Southwestern    |   249  | Lake of extraordinary blue in\r\n1902           |  Oregon         |        | crater of extinct\r\n               |                 |        | volcano--Sides 1,000 feet\r\n               |                 |        | high--Interesting lava\r\n               |                 |        | formations.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nWind Cave, 1903| South Dakota    |   17   | Cavern having many miles of\r\n               |                 |        | galleries and numerous chambers\r\n               |                 |        | containing peculiar formations.\r\n               |                 |        |\r\nPlatt, 1904    | S.

The one is an area of size\r\ncreated by Congress upon the assumption that it is a supreme example of\r\nits kind and with the purpose of developing it for public occupancy and\r\nenjoyment. The other is made by presidential proclamation to conserve an\r\narea or object which is historically, ethnologically, or scientifically\r\nimportant. Size is not considered, and development is not contemplated.\r\nThe distinction is often lost in practice. Casa Grande is essentially a\r\nnational monument, but had the status of a national park until 1918. The\r\nGrand Canyon, from every point of view a national park, was created a\r\nnational monument and remained such until 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANITE NATIONAL PARKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANITE'S PART IN SCENERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe granite national parks are Yosemite, Sequoia, including the proposed\r\nRoosevelt Park, General Grant, Rocky Mountain, and Mount McKinley.\r\nGranite, as its name denotes, is granular in texture and appearance. It\r\nis crystalline, which means that it is imperfectly crystallized. It is\r\ncomposed of quartz, feldspar, and mica in varying proportions, and\r\nincludes several common varieties which mineralogists distinguish\r\nscientifically by separate names.\r\n\r\nBecause of its great range and abundance, its presence at the core of\r\nmountain ranges where it is uncovered by erosion, its attractive\r\ncoloring, its massiveness and its vigorous personality, it figures\r\nimportantly in scenery of magnificence the world over. In color granite\r\nvaries from light gray, when it shines like silver upon the high\r\nsummits, to warm rose or dark gray, the reds depending upon the\r\nproportion of feldspar in its composition.\r\n\r\nIt produces scenic effects very different indeed from those resulting\r\nfrom volcanic and sedimentary rocks. While it bulks hugely in the higher\r\nmountains, running to enormous rounded masses below the level of the\r\nglaciers, and to jagged spires and pinnacled walls upon the loftiest\r\npeaks, it is found also in many regions of hill and plain. It is one of\r\nour commonest American rocks.\r\n\r\nMuch of the loftiest and noblest scenery of the world is wrought in\r\ngranite. The Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas, all of which are\r\nworld-celebrated for their lofty grandeur, are prevailingly granite.\r\nThey abound in towering peaks, bristling ridges, and terrifying\r\nprecipices. Their glacial cirques are girt with fantastically toothed\r\nand pinnacled walls.\r\n\r\nThis is true of all granite ranges which are lofty enough to maintain\r\nglaciers. These are, in fact, the very characteristics of Alpine,\r\nAndean, Himalayan, Sierran, Alaskan, and Rocky Mountain summit\r\nlandscape. It is why granite mountains are the favorites of those daring\r\nclimbers whose ambition is to equal established records and make new\r\nones; and this in turn is why some mountain neighborhoods become so much\r\nmore celebrated than others which are quite as fine, or finer--because,\r\nI mean, of the publicity given to this kind of mountain climbing, and of\r\nthe unwarranted assumption that the mountains associated with these\r\nexploits necessarily excel others in sublimity. As a matter of fact, the\r\naccident of fashion has even more to do with the fame of mountains than\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nBut by no means all granite mountains are lofty. The White Mountains,\r\nfor example, which parallel our northeastern coast, and are far older\r\nthan the Rockies and the Sierra, are a low granite range, with few of\r\nthe characteristics of those mountains which lift their heads among the\r\nperpetual snows. On the contrary, they tend to rounded forested summits\r\nand knobby peaks. This results in part from a longer subjection of the\r\nrock surface to the eroding influence of successive frosts and rains\r\nthan is the case with high ranges which are perpetually locked in frost.\r\nBesides, the ice sheets which planed off the northern part of the United\r\nStates lopped away their highest parts.\r\n\r\nThere are also millions of square miles of eroded granite which are not\r\nmountains at all. These tend to rolling surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe scenic forms assumed by granite will be better appreciated when one\r\nunderstands how it enters landscape. The principal one of many igneous\r\nrocks, it is liquefied under intense heat and afterward cooled under\r\npressure. Much of the earth's crust was once underlaid by granites in a\r\nmore or less fluid state. When terrific internal pressures caused the\r\nearth's crust to fold and make mountains, this liquefied granite invaded\r\nthe folds and pushed close up under the highest elevations. There it\r\ncooled. Thousands of centuries later, when erosion had worn away these\r\nmountain crests, there lay revealed the solid granite core which frost\r\nand glacier have since transformed into the bristling ramparts of\r\nto-day's landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nYOSEMITE, THE INCOMPARABLE\r\n\r\nYOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, MIDDLE EASTERN CALIFORNIA. AREA, 1,125 SQUARE\r\nMILES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first emotion inspired by the sight of Yosemite is surprise. No\r\nprevious preparation makes the mind ready for the actual revelation. The\r\nhardest preliminary reading and the closest study of photographs, even\r\nfamiliarity with other mountains as lofty, or loftier, fail to dull\r\none's first astonishment.\r\n\r\nHard on the heels of astonishment comes realization of the park's\r\nsupreme beauty. It is of its own kind, without comparison, as individual\r\nas that of the Grand Canyon or the Glacier National Park. No single\r\nvisit will begin to reveal its sublimity; one must go away and return to\r\nlook again with rested eyes. Its devotees grow in appreciative enjoyment\r\nwith repeated summerings. Even John Muir, life student, interpreter, and\r\napostle of the Sierra, confessed toward the close of his many years that\r\nthe Valley's quality of loveliness continued to surprise him at each\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly comes the higher emotion which is born of knowledge. It is\r\nonly when one reads in these inspired rocks the stirring story of their\r\nmaking that pleasure reaches its fulness. The added joy of the\r\ncollector upon finding that the unsigned canvas, which he bought only\r\nfor its beauty, is the lost work of a great master, and was associated\r\nwith the romance of a famous past is here duplicated. Written history\r\nnever was more romantic nor more graphically told than that which Nature\r\nhas inscribed upon the walls of these vast canyons, domes and monoliths\r\nin a language which man has learned to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Yosemite National Park lies on the western slope of the Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains in California, nearly east of San Francisco. The snowy\r\ncrest of the Sierra, bellying irregularly eastward to a climax among the\r\njagged granites and gale-swept glaciers of Mount Lyell, forms its\r\neastern boundary. From this the park slopes rapidly thirty miles or more\r\nwestward to the heart of the warm luxuriant zone of the giant sequoias.\r\nThis slope includes in its eleven hundred and twenty-five square miles\r\nsome of the highest scenic examples in the wide gamut of Sierra\r\ngrandeur. It is impossible to enter it without exaltation of spirit, or\r\ndescribe it without superlative.\r\n\r\nA very large proportion of Yosemite's visitors see nothing more than the\r\nValley, yet no consideration is tenable which conceives the Valley as\r\nother than a small part of the national park. The two are inseparable.\r\nOne does not speak of knowing the Louvre who has seen only the Venus de\r\nMilo, or St. Mark's who has looked only upon its horses.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a whole, the park is a sagging plain of solid granite,\r\nhung from Sierra's saw-toothed crest, broken into divides and transverse\r\nmountain ranges, punctured by volcanic summits, gashed and bitten by\r\nprehistoric glaciers, dotted near its summits with glacial lakes,\r\nfurrowed by innumerable cascading streams which combine in singing\r\nrivers, which, in turn, furrow greater canyons, some of majestic depth\r\nand grandeur. It is a land of towering spires and ambitious summits,\r\nserrated cirques, enormous isolated rock masses, rounded granite domes,\r\npolished granite pavements, lofty precipices, and long, shimmering\r\nwaterfalls.\r\n\r\nBare and gale-ridden near its crest, the park descends in thirty miles\r\nthrough all the zones and gradations of animal and vegetable life\r\nthrough which one would pass in travelling from the ice-bound shores of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean the continent's length to Mariposa Grove. Its tree\r\nsequence tells the story. Above timber-line there are none but inch-high\r\nwillows and flat, piney growths, mingled with tiny arctic flowers, which\r\nshrink in size with elevation; even the sheltered spots on Lyell's lofty\r\nsummit have their colored lichens, and their almost microscopic bloom.\r\nAt timber-line, low, wiry shrubs interweave their branches to defy the\r\ngales, merging lower down into a tangle of many stunted growths, from\r\nwhich spring twisted pines and contorted spruces, which the winds curve\r\nto leeward or bend at sharp angles, or spread in full development as\r\nprostrate upon the ground as the mountain lion's skin upon the home\r\nfloor of his slayer.\r\n\r\nDescending into the great area of the Canadian zone, with its thousand\r\nwild valleys, its shining lakes, its roaring creeks and plunging rivers,\r\nthe zone of the angler, the hiker, and the camper-out, we enter forests\r\nof various pines, of silver fir, hemlock, aged hump-backed juniper, and\r\nthe species of white pine which Californians wrongly call tamarack.\r\n\r\nThis is the paradise of outdoor living; it almost never rains between\r\nJune and October. The forests fill the valley floors, thinning rapidly\r\nas they climb the mountain slopes; they spot with pine green the broad,\r\nshining plateaus, rooting where they find the soil, leaving unclothed\r\ninnumerable glistening areas of polished uncracked granite; a striking\r\ncharacteristic of Yosemite uplands. From an altitude of seven or eight\r\nthousand feet, the Canadian zone forests begin gradually to merge into\r\nthe richer forests of the Transition zone below. The towering sugar\r\npine, the giant yellow pine, the Douglas fir, and a score of deciduous\r\ngrowths--live oaks, bays, poplars, dogwoods, maples--begin to appear and\r\nbecome more frequent with descent, until, two thousand feet or more\r\nbelow, they combine into the bright stupendous forests where, in\r\nspecially favored groves, King Sequoia holds his royal court.\r\n\r\nWild flowers, birds, and animals also run the gamut of the zones. Among\r\nthe snows and alpine flowerets of the summits are found the ptarmigan\r\nand rosy finch of the Arctic circle, and in the summit cirques and on\r\nthe shores of the glacial lakes whistles the mountain marmot.\r\n\r\nThe richness and variety of wild flower life in all zones, each of its\r\ncharacteristic kind, astonishes the visitor new to the American\r\nwilderness. Every meadow is ablaze with gorgeous coloring, every copse\r\nand sunny hollow, river bank and rocky bottom, becomes painted in turn\r\nthe hue appropriate to the changing seasons. Now blues prevail in the\r\nkaleidoscopic display, now pinks, now reds, now yellows. Experience of\r\nother national parks will show that the Yosemite is no exception; all\r\nare gardens of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Yosemite and the Sequoia are, however, the exclusive possessors\r\namong the parks of a remarkably showy flowering plant, the brilliant,\r\nrare, snow-plant. So luring is the red pillar which the snow-plant lifts\r\na foot or more above the shady mould, and so easily is it destroyed,\r\nthat, to keep it from extinction, the government fines covetous visitors\r\nfor every flower picked.\r\n\r\nThe birds are those of California--many, prolific, and songful. Ducks\r\nraise their summer broods fearlessly on the lakes. Geese visit from\r\ntheir distant homes. Cranes and herons fish the streams. Every tree has\r\nits soloist, every forest its grand chorus. The glades resound with the\r\ntapping of woodpeckers. The whirr of startled wings accompanies passage\r\nthrough every wood. To one who has lingered in the forests to watch and\r\nto listen, it is hard to account for the wide-spread fable that the\r\nYosemite is birdless. No doubt, happy talkative tourists, in companies\r\nand regiments, afoot and mounted, drive bird and beast alike to silent\r\ncover--and comment on the lifeless forests. \"The whole range, from\r\nfoothill to summit, is shaken into song every summer,\" wrote John Muir,\r\nto whom birds were the loved companions of a lifetime of Sierra summers,\r\n\"and, though low and thin in winter, the music never ceases.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two birds which the unhurried traveller will soon know well.\r\nOne is the big, noisy, gaudy Clark crow, whose swift flight and\r\ncompanionable squawk are familiar to all who tour the higher levels. The\r\nother is the friendly camp robber, who, with encouragement, not only\r\nwill share your camp luncheon, but will gobble the lion's share.\r\n\r\nOf the many wild animals, ranging in size from the great, powerful,\r\ntimid grizzly bear, now almost extinct here, whose Indian name, by the\r\nway, is Yosemite, to the tiny shrew of the lowlands, the most frequently\r\nseen are the black or brown bear, and the deer, both of which, as\r\ncompared with their kind in neighborhoods where hunting is permitted,\r\nare unterrified if not friendly. Notwithstanding its able protection,\r\nthe Yosemite will need generations to recover from the hideous slaughter\r\nwhich, in a score or two of years, denuded America of her splendid\r\nheritage of wild animal life.\r\n\r\nOf the several carnivora, the coyote alone is occasionally seen by\r\nvisitors. Wolves and mountain lions, prime enemies of the deer and\r\nmountain sheep, are hard to find, even when officially hunted in the\r\nwinter with dogs trained for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Yosemite Valley is the heart of the national park. Not only is it\r\nthe natural entrance and abiding place, the living-room, so to speak,\r\nthe central point from which all parts of the park are most comfortably\r\naccessible; it is also typical in some sense of the Sierra as a whole,\r\nand is easily the most beautiful valley in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to analyze the quality of the Valley's beauty. There\r\nare, as Muir says, \"many Yosemites\" in the Sierra. The Hetch Hetchy\r\nValley, in the northern part of the park, which bears the same relation\r\nto the Tuolumne River that the Yosemite Valley bears to the Merced, is\r\nscarcely less in size, richness, and the height and magnificence of its\r\ncarved walls. Scores of other valleys, similar except for size, abound\r\nnorth and south, which are, scientifically and in Muir's meaning,\r\nYosemites; that is, they are pauses in their rivers' headlong rush, once\r\nlakes, dug by rushing waters, squared and polished by succeeding\r\nglaciers, chiselled and ornamented by the frosts and rains which\r\npreceded and followed the glaciers. Muir is right, for all these are\r\nYosemites; but he is wrong, for there is only one Yosemite.\r\n\r\nIt is not the giant monoliths that establish the incomparable Valley's\r\nworld supremacy; Hetch Hetchy, Tehipite, Kings, and others have their\r\ngiants, too. It is not its towering, perpendicular, serrated walls; the\r\nSierra has elsewhere, too, an overwhelming exhibit of titanic granite\r\ncarvings. It is not its waterfalls, though these are the highest, by\r\nfar, in the world, nor its broad, peaceful bottoms, nor its dramatic\r\nvistas, nor the cavernous depths of its tortuous tributary canyons. Its\r\nsecret is selection and combination. Like all supremacy, Yosemite's lies\r\nin the inspired proportioning of carefully chosen elements. Herein is\r\nits real wonder, for the more carefully one analyzes the beauty of the\r\nYosemite Valley, the more difficult it is to conceive its ensemble the\r\nchance of Nature's functioning rather than the master product of supreme\r\nartistry.\r\n\r\nEntrance to the Yosemite by train is from the west, by automobile from\r\neast and west both. From whatever direction, the Valley is the first\r\nobjective, for the hotels are there. It is the Valley, then, which we\r\nmust see first. Nature's artistic contrivance is apparent even in the\r\nentrance. The train-ride from the main line at Merced is a constant\r\nup-valley progress, from a hot, treeless plain to the heart of the\r\ngreat, cool forest. Expectation keeps pace. Changing to automobile at El\r\nPortal, one quickly enters the park. A few miles of forest and\r\nbehold--the Gates of the Valley. El Capitan, huge, glistening, rises\r\nupon the left, 3,000 feet above the valley floor. At first sight its\r\nbulk almost appalls. Opposite upon the right Cathedral Rocks support the\r\nBridal Veil Fall, shimmering, filmy, a fairy thing. Between them, in the\r\ndistance, lies the unknown.\r\n\r\nProgress up the valley makes constantly for climax. Seen presently\r\nbroadside on, El Capitan bulks double, at least. Opposite, the valley\r\nbellies. Cathedral Rocks and the mediaeval towers known as Cathedral\r\nSpires, are enclosed in a bay, which culminates in the impressive needle\r\nknown as Sentinel Rock--all richly Gothic. Meantime the broadened\r\nvalley, another strong contrast in perfect key, delightfully alternates\r\nwith forest and meadow, and through it the quiet Merced twists and\r\ndoubles like a glistening snake. And then we come to the Three Brothers.\r\n\r\nAlready some notion of preconception has possessed the observer. It\r\ncould not have been chance which set off the filmy Bridal Veil against\r\nEl Capitan's bulk; which designed the Gothic climax of Sentinel Rock;\r\nwhich wondrously proportioned the consecutive masses of the Three\r\nBrothers; which made El Capitan, now looked back upon against a new\r\nbackground, a new and appropriate creation, a thing of brilliance and\r\nbeauty instead of bulk, mighty of mass, powerful in shape and poise, yet\r\nmysteriously delicate and unreal. As we pass on with rapidly increasing\r\nexcitement to the supreme climax at the Valley's head, where gather\r\ntogether Glacier Point, Yosemite Falls of unbelievable height and\r\ngraciousness, the Royal Arches, manifestly a carving, the gulf-like\r\nentrances of Tenaya and the Merced Canyons, and above all, and pervading\r\nall, the distinguished mysterious personality of Half Dome, presiding\r\npriest of this Cathedral of Beauty, again there steals over us the\r\nuneasy suspicion of supreme design. How could Nature have happened upon\r\nthe perfect composition, the flawless technique, the divine inspiration\r\nof this masterpiece of more than human art? Is it not, in fact, the\r\nmaster temple of the Master Architect?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by J.T. Boysen_\r\n\r\nEL CAPITAN, SURVIVOR OF THE GLACIERS\r\n\r\nLooking eastward up the Yosemite Valley, Half Dome is seen on the right\r\nhorizon]\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the Valley we must consider certain details. It is eight\r\nmiles long, and from half a mile to a mile wide. Once prehistoric Lake\r\nYosemite, its floor is as level as a ball field, and except for\r\noccasional meadows, grandly forested. The sinuous Merced is forested to\r\nits edges in its upper reaches, but lower down occasionally wanders\r\nthrough broad, blooming opens. The rock walls are dark pearl-hued\r\ngranite, dotted with pines wherever clefts or ledges exist capable of\r\nsupporting them; even El Capitan carries its pine-tree half way up its\r\nsmooth precipice. Frequently the walls are sheer; they look so\r\neverywhere. The valley's altitude is 4,000 feet. The walls rise from\r\n2,000 to 6,000 feet higher; the average is a little more than 3,000 feet\r\nabove the valley floor; Sentinel Dome and Mount Watkins somewhat exceed\r\n4,000 feet; Half Dome nearly attains 5,000 feet; Cloud's Rest soars\r\nnearly 6,000 feet.\r\n\r\nTwo large trench-like canyons enter the valley at its head, one on\r\neither side of Half Dome. Tenaya Canyon enters from the east in line\r\nwith the valley, looking as if it were the Valley's upper reach. Merced\r\nCanyon enters from the south after curving around the east and south\r\nsides of Half Dome. Both are extremely deep. Half Dome's 5,000 feet form\r\none side of each canyon; Mount Watkin's 4,300 feet form the north side\r\nof Tenaya Canyon, Glacier Point's 3,200 feet the west side of Merced\r\nCanyon. Both canyons are superbly wooded at their outlets, and lead\r\nrapidly up to timber-line. Both carry important trails from the Valley\r\nfloor to the greater park above the rim.\r\n\r\nTo this setting add the waterfalls and the scene is complete. They are\r\nthe highest in the world. Each is markedly individualized; no two\r\nresemble each other. Yet, with the exception of the Vernal Fall, all\r\nhave a common note; all are formed of comparatively small streams\r\ndropping from great heights; all are wind-blown ribbons ending in clouds\r\nof mist. They are so distributed that one or more are visible from most\r\nparts of the Valley and its surrounding rim. More than any other\r\nfeature, they differentiate and distinguish the Yosemite.\r\n\r\nThe first of the falls encountered, Bridal Veil, is a perfect example of\r\nthe valley type. A small stream pouring over a perpendicular wall drops\r\nsix hundred and twenty feet into a volume of mist. The mist, of course,\r\nis the bridal veil. How much of the water reaches the bottom as water is\r\na matter of interesting speculation. This and the condensed mists reach\r\nthe river through a delta of five small brooks. As a spectacle the\r\nBridal Veil Fall is unsurpassed. The delicacy of its beauty, even in the\r\nhigh water of early summer, is unequalled by any waterfall I have seen.\r\nA rainbow frequently gleams like a colored rosette in the massed chiffon\r\nof the bride's train. So pleasing are its proportions that it is\r\ndifficult to believe the fall nearly four times the height of Niagara.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by J.T. Boysen_\r\n\r\nHALF DOME, YOSEMITE'S HOODED MONK\r\n\r\nRising nearly four thousand feet above the valley floor; the view is up\r\nTenaya Canyon to the High Sierra]\r\n\r\nThe Ribbon Fall, directly opposite Bridal Veil, a little west of El\r\nCapitan, must be mentioned because for a while in early spring its\r\nsixteen hundred foot drop is a spectacle of remarkable grandeur. It is\r\nmerely the run of a snow-field which disappears in June. Thereafter a\r\ndark perpendicular stain on the cliff marks its position. Another minor\r\nfall, this from the south rim, is that of Sentinel Creek. It is seen\r\nfrom the road at the right of Sentinel Rock, dropping five hundred feet\r\nin one leap of several which aggregate two thousand feet.\r\n\r\nNext in progress come Yosemite Falls, loftiest by far in the world, a\r\nspectacle of sublimity. These falls divide with Half Dome the honors of\r\nthe upper Valley. The tremendous plunge of the Upper Fall, and the\r\nmagnificence of the two falls in apparent near continuation as seen from\r\nthe principal points of elevation on the valley floor, form a spectacle\r\nof extraordinary distinction. They vie with Yosemite's two great rocks,\r\nEl Capitan and Half Dome, for leadership among the individual scenic\r\nfeatures of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Fall pours over the rim at a point nearly twenty-six hundred\r\nfeet above the valley floor. Its sheer drop is fourteen hundred and\r\nthirty feet, the equal of nine Niagaras. Two-fifths of a mile south of\r\nits foot, the Lower Fall drops three hundred and twenty feet more. From\r\nthe crest of the Upper Fall to the foot of the Lower Fall lacks a little\r\nof half a mile. From the foot of the Lower Fall, after foaming down the\r\ntalus, Yosemite Creek, seeming a ridiculously small stream to have\r\nproduced so monstrous a spectacle, slips quietly across a half mile of\r\nlevel valley to lose itself in the Merced.\r\n\r\nFrom the floods of late May when the thunder of falling water fills the\r\nvalley and windows rattle a mile away, to the October drought when the\r\nslender ribbon is little more than mist, the Upper Yosemite Fall is a\r\nthing of many moods and infinite beauty. Seen from above and opposite at\r\nGlacier Point, sideways and more distantly from the summit of Cloud's\r\nRest, straight on from the valley floor, upwards from the foot of the\r\nLower Fall, upwards again from its own foot, and downwards from the\r\noverhanging brink toward which the creek idles carelessly to the very\r\nstep-off of its fearful leap, the Fall never loses for a moment its\r\npower to amaze. It draws and holds the eye as the magnet does the iron.\r\n\r\nLooking up from below one is fascinated by the extreme leisureliness of\r\nits motion. The water does not seem to fall; it floats; a pebble dropped\r\nalongside surely would reach bottom in half the time. Speculating upon\r\nthis appearance, one guesses that the air retards the water's drop, but\r\nthis idea is quickly dispelled by the observation that the solid inner\r\nbody drops no faster than the outer spray. It is long before the\r\nwondering observer perceives that he is the victim of an illusion; that\r\nthe water falls normally; that it appears to descend with less than\r\nnatural speed only because of the extreme height of the fall, the eye\r\nnaturally applying standards to which it has been accustomed in viewing\r\nfalls of ordinary size.\r\n\r\nOn windy days the Upper Fall swings from the brink like a pendulum of\r\nsilver and mist. Back and forth it lashes like a horse's tail. The gusts\r\nlop off puffy clouds of mist which dissipate in air. Muir tells of\r\npowerful winter gales driving head on against the cliff, which break the\r\nfall in its middle and hold it in suspense. Once he saw the wind double\r\nthe fall back over its own brink. Muir, by the way, once tried to pass\r\nbehind the Upper Fall at its foot, but was nearly crushed.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with the lofty temperamental Upper Fall, the Lower Fall\r\nappears a smug and steady pigmy. In such company, for both are always\r\nseen together, it is hard to realize that the Lower Fall is twice the\r\nheight of Niagara. Comparing Yosemite's three most conspicuous features,\r\nthese gigantic falls seem to appeal even more to the imagination than to\r\nthe sense of beauty. El Capitan, on the other hand, suggests majesty,\r\norder, proportion, and power; it has its many devotees. Half Dome\r\nsuggests mystery; to many it symbolizes worship. Of these three, Half\r\nDome easily is the most popular.\r\n\r\nThree more will complete the Valley's list of notable waterfalls. All\r\nof these lie up the Merced Canyon. Illilouette, three hundred and\r\nseventy feet in height, enters from the west, a frothing fall of great\r\nbeauty, hard to see. Vernal and Nevada Falls carry the Merced River over\r\nsteep steps in its rapid progress from the upper levels to the valley\r\nfloor. The only exception to the valley type, Vernal Fall, which some\r\nconsider the most beautiful of all, and which certainly is the\r\nprettiest, is a curtain of water three hundred and seventeen feet high,\r\nand of pleasing breadth. The Nevada Fall, three-fifths of a mile above,\r\na majestic drop of nearly six hundred feet, shoots watery rockets from\r\nits brink. It is full-run, powerful, impressive, and highly\r\nindividualized. With many it is the favorite waterfall of Yosemite.\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast with these valley scenes is the view from Glacier\r\nPoint down into the Merced and Tenaya Canyons, and out over the magical\r\npark landscape to the snow-capped mountains of the High Sierra. Two\r\ntrails lead from the valley up to Glacier Point, and high upon the\r\nprecipice, three thousand feet above the valley floor, is a picturesque\r\nhotel; it is also reached by road. Here one may sit at ease on shady\r\nporches and overlook one of the most extended, varied and romantic views\r\nin the world of scenery. One may take dinner on this porch and have\r\nsunset served with dessert and the afterglow with coffee.\r\n\r\nHere again one is haunted by the suggestion of artistic intention, so\r\nhappy is the composition of this extraordinary picture. The foreground\r\nis the dark, tremendous gulf of Merced Canyon, relieved by the silver\r\nshimmer of Vernal and Nevada Falls. From this in middle distance rises,\r\nin the centre of the canvas, the looming tremendous personality of Half\r\nDome, here seen in profile strongly suggesting a monk with outstretched\r\narms blessing the valley at close of day. Beyond stretches the horizon\r\nof famous, snowy, glacier-shrouded mountains, golden in sunset glow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEvery summer many thousands of visitors gather in Yosemite. Most of\r\nthem, of course, come tourist-fashion, to glimpse it all in a day or two\r\nor three. A few thousands come for long enough to taste most of it, or\r\nreally to see a little. Fewer, but still increasingly many, are those\r\nwho come to live a little with Yosemite; among these we find the lovers\r\nof nature, the poets, the seers, the dreamers, and the students.\r\n\r\nLiving is very pleasant in the Yosemite. The freedom from storm during\r\nthe long season, the dry warmth of the days and the coldness of the\r\nnights, the inspiration of the surroundings and the completeness of the\r\nequipment for the comfort of visitors make it extraordinary among\r\nmountain resorts. There is a hotel in the Valley, and another upon the\r\nrim at Glacier Point. There are three large hotel-camps in the Valley,\r\nwhere one may have hotel comforts under canvas at camp prices. Two of\r\nthese hotel-camps possess swimming pools, dancing pavilions, tennis\r\ncourts electrically lighted for night play, hot and cold-water tubs and\r\nshowers, and excellent table service. One of the hotel-camps, the\r\nlargest, provides evening lectures, song services, and a general\r\natmosphere suggestive of Chatauqua. Still a third is for those who\r\nprefer quiet retirement and the tradition of old-fashioned camp life.\r\n\r\nAbove the valley rim, besides the excellent hotel upon Glacier Point,\r\nthere are at this writing hotel-camps equipped with many hotel comforts,\r\nincluding baths, at such outlying points as Merced Lake and Tenaya Lake;\r\nthe former centering the mountain climbing and trout fishing of the\r\nstupendous region on the southwest slope of the park, and the latter the\r\nkey to the entire magnificent region of the Tuolumne. These camps are\r\nreached by mountain trail, Tenaya Lake Camp also by motor road. The\r\nhotel-camp system is planned for wide extension as growing demand\r\nwarrants. There are also hotels outside park limits on the south and\r\nwest which connect with the park roads and trails.\r\n\r\nThe roads, by the way, are fair. Three enter from the west, centering at\r\nYosemite Village in the Valley; one from the south by way of the\r\ncelebrated Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias; one from El Portal,\r\nterminus of the Yosemite Railway; and one from the north, by way of\r\nseveral smaller sequoia groves, connecting directly with the Tioga Road.\r\n\r\nAbove the valley rim and north of it, the Tioga Road crosses the\r\nnational park and emerges at Mono Lake on the east, having crossed the\r\nSierra over Tioga Pass on the park boundary. The Tioga Road, which was\r\nbuilt in 1881, on the site of the Mono Trail, to connect a gold mine\r\nwest of what has since become the national park with roads east of the\r\nSierra, was purchased in 1915 by patriotic lovers of the Yosemite and\r\ngiven to the Government. The mine having soon failed, the road had been\r\nimpassable for many years. Repaired with government money it has become\r\nthe principal highway of the park and the key to its future development.\r\nThe increase in motor travel to the Yosemite from all parts of the\r\ncountry which began the summer following the Great War, has made this\r\ngift one of growing importance. It affords a new route across the\r\nSierra.\r\n\r\nBut hotels and hotel-camps, while accommodating the great majority of\r\nvisitors, by no means shelter all. Those who camp out under their own\r\ncanvas are likely to be Yosemite's most appreciative devotees. The\r\ncamping-out colony lives in riverside groves in the upper reaches of the\r\nValley, the Government assigning locations without charge. Many families\r\nmake permanent summer homes here, storing equipment between seasons in\r\nthe village. Others hire equipment complete, from tents to salt-cellars,\r\non the spot. Some who come to the hotels finish the season under hired\r\ncanvas, and next season come with their own. An increasing number come\r\nin cars, which they keep in local garages or park near their canvas\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nLiving is easy and not expensive in these camp homes. Midday\r\ntemperatures are seasonable, and nights are always cool. As it does not\r\nrain, tents are concessions to habit; many prefer sleeping under the\r\ntrees. Markets in the village supply meats, vegetables, milk, bread, and\r\ngroceries at prices regulated by Government, and deliver them at your\r\nkitchen tent. Shops furnish all other reasonable needs. It is not\r\ncamping out as commonly conceived; you are living at home on the banks\r\nof the Merced, under the morning shadow of Half Dome, and within sight\r\nof Yosemite Falls.\r\n\r\nFrom these Valley homes one rides into the High Sierra on horses hired\r\nfrom the government concessioner, tours to the Tuolumne Meadows or the\r\nMariposa Grove by automobile, wanders long summer afternoons in the\r\nValley, climbs the great rocks and domes, picnics by moonlight under the\r\nshimmering falls or beneath the shining tower of El Capitan, explores\r\nfamous fishing waters above the rim, and, on frivolous evenings, dances\r\nor looks at motion pictures at the greater hotel-camps.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that camp homes in the Yosemite are growing in popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe trail traveller finds the trails the best in the country, and as\r\ngood as the best in the world; they are the models for the national\r\nsystem. Competent guides, horses, supplies, and equipment are easy to\r\nhire at regulated prices in the village.\r\n\r\nAs for the field, there is none nobler or more varied in the world.\r\nThere are dozens of divides, scores of towering, snow-splashed peaks,\r\nhundreds of noble valleys and shining lakes, thousands of cascading\r\nstreams, great and small, from whose depths fighting trout rise to the\r\ncast fly. There are passes to be crossed which carry one through\r\nconcentric cirques of toothed granite to ridges from which the High\r\nSierra spreads before the eye a frothing sea of snowy peaks.\r\n\r\nSuch a trip is that through Tuolumne Meadows up Lyell Canyon to its\r\nheadwaters, over the Sierra at Donohue Pass, and up into the birth\r\nchambers of rivers among the summit glaciers of Lyell and McClure--a\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten journey, which may be continued, if one has time\r\nand equipment, down the John Muir Trail to Mount Whitney and the Sequoia\r\nNational Park. Or one may return to the park by way of Banner Peak and\r\nThousand Island Lake, a wonder spot, and thence north over Parker and\r\nMono Passes; trips like these produce views as magnificent as the land\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nSpace does not permit even the suggestion of the possibilities to the\r\ntrail traveller of this wonderland above the rim. It is the summer\r\nplayground for a nation.\r\n\r\nSecond in magnificence among the park valleys is Hetch Hetchy, the\r\nYosemite of the north. Both are broad, flowered and forested levels\r\nbetween lofty granite walls. Both are accented by gigantic rock\r\npersonalities. Kolana Rock, which guards Hetch Hetchy at its western\r\ngateway as El Capitan guards Yosemite, must be ranked in the same class.\r\nWere there no Yosemite Valley, Hetch Hetchy, though it lacks the\r\ndistinction which gives Yosemite Valley its world-wide fame, would be\r\nmuch better known than it now is--a statement also true about other\r\nfeatures of the national park.\r\n\r\nHetch Hetchy is now being dammed below Kolana Rock to supply water for\r\nSan Francisco. The dam will be hidden from common observation, and the\r\ntimber lands to be flooded will be cut so as to avoid the unsightliness\r\nusual with artificial reservoirs in forested areas. The reservoir will\r\ncover one of the most beautiful bottoms in America. It will destroy\r\nforests of luxuriance. It will replace these with a long sinuous lake,\r\nfrom which sheer Yosemite-like granite walls will rise abruptly two or\r\nthree thousand feet. There will be places where the edges are forested.\r\nDown into this lake from the high rim will cascade many roaring streams.\r\n\r\nThe long fight in California, in the press of the whole country, and\r\nfinally in Congress, between the advocates of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir\r\nand the defenders of the scenic wilderness is one of the stirring\r\nepisodes in the history of our national parks. At this writing, time\r\nenough has not yet passed to heal the wounds of battle, but at least we\r\nmay look calmly at what remains. One consideration, at least, affords a\r\nlittle comfort. Hetch Hetchy was once, in late prehistoric times, a\r\nnatural lake of great nobility. The remains of Nature's dam, not far\r\nfrom the site of man's, are plain to the geologist's eye. It is possible\r\nthat, with care in building the dam and clearing out the trees to be\r\nsubmerged, this restoration of one of Nature's noble features of the\r\npast may not work out so inappropriately as once we feared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by J.T. Boysen_\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMAX OF YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nMount Lyell and its glacier from Lyell Fork]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREATEST WATERWHEEL OF THE TUOLUMNE\r\n\r\nIt is fifty feet in height and seventy-five feet long; Yosemite National\r\nPark]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, through which the river descends from\r\nthe level of the Tuolumne Meadows almost five thousand feet to the Hetch\r\nHetchy Valley, possesses real Yosemite grandeur. Much of this enormous\r\ndrop occurs within a couple of amazing miles west of the California\r\nFalls. Here the river slips down sharply tilted granite slopes at\r\nbreathless speed, breaking into cascades and plunging over waterfalls at\r\nfrequent intervals. It is a stupendous spectacle which few but the\r\nhardiest mountaineers saw previous to 1918, so steep and difficult was\r\nthe going. During that season a trail was opened which makes accessible\r\nto all one of the most extraordinary examples of plunging water in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe climax of this spectacle is the Waterwheels. Granite obstructions in\r\nthe bed of the steeply tilted river throw solid arcs of frothing water\r\nfifty feet in air. They occur near together, singly and in groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe fine camping country south of the Yosemite Valley also offers its\r\nsensation. At its most southern point, the park accomplishes its forest\r\nclimax in the Mariposa Grove. This group of giant sequoias (Sequoia\r\nwashingtoniana) ranks next, in the number and magnificence of its trees,\r\nto the Giant Forest of the Sequoia National Park and the General Grant\r\ngrove.\r\n\r\nThe largest tree of the Mariposa Grove is the Grizzly Giant, which has a\r\ndiameter of twenty-nine feet, a circumference of sixty-four feet, and a\r\nheight of two hundred and four feet. One may guess its age from three\r\nthousand to thirty-two hundred years. It is the third in size and age of\r\nliving sequoias; General Sherman, the largest and oldest, has a diameter\r\nof thirty-six and a half feet, and General Grant a diameter of\r\nthirty-five feet, and neither of these, in all probability, has attained\r\nthe age of four thousand years. General Sherman grows in the Sequoia\r\nNational Park, seventy miles or more south of Yosemite; General Grant\r\nhas a little national park of its own a few miles west of Sequoia.\r\n\r\nThe interested explorer of the Yosemite has so far enjoyed a wonderfully\r\nvaried sequence of surprises. The incomparable valley with its towering\r\nmonoliths and extraordinary waterfalls, the High Sierra with its\r\nglaciers, serrated cirques and sea of snowy peaks, the Grand Canyon of\r\nthe Tuolumne with its cascades, rushing river and frothing Waterwheels,\r\nare but the headliners of a long catalogue of the unexpected and\r\nextraordinary. It only remains, to complete this new tale of the Arabian\r\nNights, to make one's first visit to the sequoias of Mariposa Grove. The\r\nfirst sight of the calm tremendous columns which support the lofty roof\r\nof this forest temple provokes a new sensation. Unconsciously the\r\nvisitor removes his hat and speaks his praise in whispers.\r\n\r\nThe sequoias are considered at greater length in the chapter describing\r\nthe Sequoia National Park, which was created especially to conserve and\r\nexhibit more than a million of these most interesting of trees. It will\r\nsuffice here to say that their enormous stems are purplish red, that\r\ntheir fine, lace-like foliage hangs in splendid heavy plumes, that their\r\nenormous limbs crook at right angles, the lowest from a hundred to a\r\nhundred and fifty feet above the ground, and that all other trees, even\r\nthe gigantic sugar pine and Douglas fir, are dwarfed in their presence.\r\nSeveral of the sequoias of the Mariposa grove approach three hundred\r\nfeet in height. The road passes through the trunk of one.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe human history of the Yosemite is quickly told. The country north of\r\nthe Valley was known from early times by explorers and trappers who used\r\nthe old Mono Indian Trail, now the Tioga Road, which crossed the divide\r\nover Mono Pass. But, though the trail approached within a very few miles\r\nof the north rim of the Yosemite Valley, the valley was not discovered\r\ntill 1851, when Captain Boling of the Mariposa Battalion, a volunteer\r\norganization for the protection of settlers, entered it from the west in\r\npursuit of Indians who had raided mining settlements in the foothills.\r\n\r\nThese savages were known as the Yosemite or Grizzly Bear Indians.\r\nTenaya, their chief, met their pursuers on the uplands and besought them\r\nto come no further. But Captain Boling pushed on through the heavy\r\nsnows, and on March 21, entered the valley, which proved to be the\r\nIndians' final stronghold. Their villages, however, were deserted.\r\n\r\nThe original inhabitants of the Valley were called the Ahwahneechees,\r\nthe Indian name for the Valley being Ahwahnee, meaning a deep grassy\r\ncanyon. The Ahwahneechees, previous to Captain Boling's expedition, had\r\nbeen decimated by war and disease. The new tribe, the Yosemites, or\r\nGrizzly Bears, was made up of their remainder, with Monos and Piutes\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nCaptain Boling's report of the beauty of the valley having been\r\nquestioned, he returned during the summer to prove his assertions to a\r\nfew doubters. Nevertheless, there were no further visitors until 1853,\r\nwhen Robert B. Stinson of Mariposa led in a hunting-party. Two years\r\nlater J.M. Hutchings, who was engaged in writing up the beauties of\r\nCalifornia for the _California Magazine_, brought the first tourists;\r\nthe second, a party of sixteen, followed later the same year.\r\n\r\nPleasure travel to the Yosemite Valley may be said to have commenced\r\nwith 1856, the year the first house was built. This house was enlarged\r\nin 1858 by Hite and Beardsley and used for a hotel. Sullivan and Cushman\r\nsecured it for a debt the following year, and it was operated in turn by\r\nPeck, Longhurst, and Hutchings until 1871. Meantime J.C. Lamon settled\r\nin 1860, the first actual resident of the valley, an honor which he did\r\nnot share with others for four years.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the valley spread over the country and in 1864 Congress\r\ngranted to the State of California \"the Cleft or Gorge of the Granite\r\nPeak of the Sierra Nevada Mountains\" known as the Yosemite Valley, with\r\nthe understanding that all income derived from it should be spent for\r\nimproving the reservation or building a road to it. The Mariposa Big\r\nTree Grove was also granted at the same time. California carefully\r\nfulfilled her charge. The Yosemite Valley became world-famous, and in\r\n1890 the Yosemite National Park was created.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe Yosemite's geological history is much more thrilling. Everyone who\r\nsees it asks, How did Nature make the Yosemite Valley? Was it split by\r\nearth convulsions or scooped by glacier? Few ask what part was played by\r\nthe gentle Merced.\r\n\r\nThe question of Yosemite's making has busied geologists from Professor\r\nWhitney of the University of California, who first studied the problem,\r\ndown to F.E. Matthes, of the United States Geological Survey, whose\r\nrecent exhaustive studies have furnished the final solution. Professor\r\nWhitney maintained that glaciers never had entered the valley; he did\r\nnot even consider water erosion. At one time he held that the valley\r\nwas simply a cleft or rent in the earth's crust. At another time he\r\nimagined it formed by the sudden dropping back of a large block in the\r\ncourse of the convulsions that resulted in the uplift of the Sierra\r\nNevada. Galen Clark, following him, carried on his idea of an origin by\r\nforce. Instead of the walls being cleft apart, however, he imagined the\r\nexplosion of close-set domes of molten rock the riving power, but\r\nconceived that ice and water erosion finished the job. With Clarence\r\nKing the theory of glacial origin began its long career. John Muir\r\ncarried this theory to its extreme.\r\n\r\nSince the period of Muir's speculations, the tremendous facts concerning\r\nthe part played by erosion in the modification of the earth's surface\r\nstrata have been developed. Beginning with W.H. Turner, a group of\r\nYosemite students under the modern influence worked upon the theory of\r\nthe stream-cut valley modified by glaciers. The United States Geological\r\nSurvey then entered the field, and Matthes's minute investigations\r\nfollowed; the manuscript of his monograph has helped me reconstruct the\r\ndramatic past.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Yosemite Valley was cut from the solid granite\r\nnearly to its present depth by the Merced River; before the glaciers\r\narrived, the river-cut valley was twenty-four hundred feet deep opposite\r\nEl Capitan, and three thousand feet deep opposite Eagle Peak. The valley\r\nwas then V-shaped, and the present waterfalls were cascades; those which\r\nare now the Yosemite Falls were eighteen hundred feet deep, and those\r\nof Sentinel Creek were two thousand feet deep. All this in pre-glacial\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nLater on the glaciers of several successive epochs greatly widened the\r\nvalley, and measurably deepened it, making it U-shaped. The cascades\r\nthen became waterfalls.\r\n\r\nBut none will see the Yosemite Valley and its cavernous tributary\r\ncanyons without sympathizing a little with the early geologists. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine a gash so tremendous cut into solid granite by\r\nanything short of force. One can think of it gouged by massive glaciers,\r\nbut to imagine it cut by water is at first inconceivable.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend it we must first consider two geological facts. The first\r\nis that no dawdling modern Merced cut this chasm, but a torrent\r\nconsiderably bigger; and that this roaring river swept at tremendous\r\nspeed down a sharply tilted bed, which it gouged deeper and deeper by\r\nfriction of the enormous masses of sand and granite fragments which it\r\ncarried down from the High Sierra. The second geological fact is that\r\nthe Merced and Tenaya torrents sand-papered the deepening beds of these\r\ncanyons day and night for several million years; which, when we remember\r\nthe mile-deep canyons which the Colorado River and its confluents cut\r\nthrough a thousand or more miles of Utah and Arizona, is not beyond\r\nhuman credence, if not conception.\r\n\r\nBut, objects the sceptical, the Merced couldn't keep always tilted; in\r\ntime it would cut down to a level and slow up; then the sand and gravel\r\nit was carrying would settle, and the stream stop its digging. Again, if\r\nthe stream-cut valley theory is correct, why isn't every Sierra canyon a\r\nYosemite?\r\n\r\nLet us look for the answer in the Sierra's history.\r\n\r\nThe present Sierra Nevada is not the first mountain chain upon its site.\r\nThe granite which underlay the folds of the first Sierra are still\r\ndisclosed in the walls of the Yosemite Valley. The granites which\r\nunderlay the second and modern Sierra are seen in the towering heights\r\nof the crest.\r\n\r\nOnce these mountains overran a large part of our present far west. They\r\nformed a level and very broad and high plateau; or, more accurately,\r\nthey tended to form such a plateau, but never quite succeeded, because\r\nits central section kept caving and sinking in some of its parts as fast\r\nas it lifted in others. Finally, in the course, perhaps, of some\r\nmillions of years, the entire central section settled several thousand\r\nfeet lower than its eastern and western edges; these edges it left\r\nstanding steep and high. This sunken part is the Great Basin of to-day.\r\nThe remaining eastern edge is the Wasatch Mountains; the remaining\r\nwestern edge is the Sierra. That is why the Sierra's eastern front rises\r\nso precipitously from the deserts of the Great Basin, while its western\r\nside slopes gradually toward the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBut other crust changes accompanied the sinking of the Great Basin. The\r\nprincipal one was the rise, in a series of upward movements, of the\r\nremaining crest of the Sierra. These movements may have corresponded\r\nwith the sinkings of the Great Basin; both were due to tremendous\r\ninternal readjustments. And of course, whenever the Sierra crest lifted,\r\nit tilted more sharply the whole granite block of which it was the\r\neastern edge. These successive tiltings are what kept the Merced and\r\nTenaya channels always so steeply inclined that, for millions of years,\r\nthe streams remained torrents swift enough to keep on sandpapering their\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nThe first of these tiltings occurred in that far age which geologists\r\ncall the Cretaceous. It was inconsiderable, but enough to hasten the\r\nspeed of the streams and establish general outlines for all time. About\r\nthe middle of the Tertiary Period volcanic eruptions changed all things.\r\nNearly all the valleys except the Yosemite became filled with lava. Even\r\nthe crest of the range was buried a thousand feet in one place. This was\r\nfollowed by a rise of the Sierra Crest a couple of thousand feet, and of\r\ncourse a much sharper tilting of the western slopes. The Merced and\r\nTenaya Rivers must have rushed very fast indeed during the many thousand\r\nyears that followed.\r\n\r\nThe most conservative estimate of the duration of the Tertiary Period is\r\nfour or five million years, and until its close volcanic eruptions\r\ncontinued to fill valleys with lava, and the Great Basin kept settling,\r\nand the crest of the Sierra went on rising; and with each lifting of the\r\ncrest, the tilt of the rivers sharpened and the speed of the torrents\r\nhastened. The canyon deepened during this time from seven hundred to a\r\nthousand feet. The Yosemite was then a mountain valley whose sloping\r\nsides were crossed by cascades.\r\n\r\nThen, about the beginning of the Quaternary Period, came the biggest\r\nconvulsion of all. The crest of the Sierra was hoisted, according to\r\nMatthes's calculations, as much as eight thousand feet higher in this\r\none series of movements, and the whole Sierra block was again tilted,\r\nthis time, of course, enormously.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of centuries following, the torrents from Lyell's and\r\nMcClure's melting snows must have descended at a speed which tore\r\nboulders from their anchorages, ground rocks into sand, and savagely\r\nscraped and scooped the river beds. Armed with sharp hard-cutting tools\r\nripped from the granite cirques of Sierra's crest, these mad rivers must\r\nhave scratched and hewn deep and fast. And because certain valleys,\r\nincluding the Yosemite, were never filled with lava like the rest, these\r\ngrew ever deeper with the centuries.\r\n\r\nThe great crust movement of the Quaternary Period was not the last, by\r\nany means, though it was the last of great size. There were many small\r\nones later. Several even have occurred within historic times. On March\r\n26, 1872, a sudden earth movement left an escarpment twenty-five feet\r\nhigh at the foot of the range in Owens Valley. The village of Lone Pine\r\nwas levelled by the accompanying earthquake. John Muir, who was in the\r\nYosemite Valley at the time, describes in eloquent phrase the\r\naccompanying earthquake which was felt there. A small movement,\r\ndoubtless of similar origin, started the San Francisco fire in 1906.\r\n\r\nConditions created by the great Quaternary tilting deepened the valley\r\nfrom eighteen hundred feet at its lower end to twenty-four hundred feet\r\nat its upper end. It established what must have been an unusually\r\ninteresting and impressive landscape, which suggested the modern aspect,\r\nbut required completion by the glaciers.\r\n\r\nGeologically speaking, the glaciers were recent. There were several ice\r\ninvasions, produced probably by the same changes in climate which\r\noccasioned the advances of the continental ice sheet east of the\r\nRockies. Matthes describes them as similar to the northern glaciers of\r\nthe Canadian Rockies of to-day. For unknown thousands of years the\r\nValley was filled by a glacier three or four thousand feet thick, and\r\nthe surrounding country was covered with tributary ice-fields. Only\r\nCloud's Rest, Half Dome, Sentinel Dome, and the crown of El Capitan\r\nemerged above this ice. The glacier greatly widened and considerably\r\ndeepened the valley, turned its slopes into perpendiculars, and changed\r\nits side cascades into waterfalls. When it receded it left Yosemite\r\nValley almost completed.\r\n\r\nThere followed a long period of conditions not unlike those of to-day.\r\nFrosts chipped and scaled the granite surfaces, and rains carried away\r\nthe fragments. The valley bloomed with forests and wild flowers. Then\r\ncame other glaciers and other intervening periods. The last glacier\r\nadvanced only to the head of Bridal Veil Meadow. When it melted it left\r\na lake which filled the Valley from wall to wall, three hundred feet\r\ndeep. Finally the lake filled up with soil, brought down by the streams,\r\nand made the floor of the present valley.\r\n\r\nThe centuries since have been a period of decoration and enrichment.\r\nFrost and rain have done their perfect work. The incomparable valley is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSED ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nINCLUDING THE PRESENT SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, WEST CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.\r\nAREA, 1,600 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhere the lava billows of the Cascade Mountains end in northern\r\nCalifornia the granite knobs of the Sierra begin. Sharply differentiated\r\nin appearance and nature a few miles further in either direction, here\r\ntheir terminals overlap, and so nearly merge that the southern end of\r\nthe one and the northern beginning of the other are not easily\r\ndistinguished by the untrained eye.\r\n\r\nBut southward the Sierra Nevada, the snowy saw-toothed range of the\r\nSpaniards, the Sierra of modern American phrase, rapidly acquires the\r\nbulk and towering height, the craggy cirqued summits and the snowy\r\nshoulders which have made it celebrated. Gathering grandeur as it sweeps\r\nsouthward close to the western boundary of California, its western\r\nslopes slashed deep with canyons, its granite peaks and domes pushing\r\never higher above the scattering forests of its middle zones, its\r\neastern ramparts dropping in precipices to the desert, it valiantly\r\nguards its sunny state against the passage of eastern highways, and\r\nforces hard engineering problems upon the builders of transcontinental\r\nrailroads. Where it becomes the eastern boundary of the Yosemite\r\nNational Park it breaks into climaxes of magnificence.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on the Sierra broadens and bulks. It throws out spurs,\r\nmultiplies paralleling ranges, heaps peaks and ridges between gulf-like\r\ncanyons which carry roaring waters through their forested trenches.\r\nPushing ever higher above timber-line, it breaks into large lake-bearing\r\ncirques, sometimes cirque within cirque, walled in silvery granite, hung\r\nwith garlands of snow and dripping with shining glaciers. Ninety miles\r\nsouth of Yosemite it culminates in a close grouping of snow-daubed,\r\nglacier-gouged, lightning-splintered peaks, one of which, Mount Whitney,\r\nhighest summit in the United States, raises his head just a little above\r\nhis gigantic neighbors.\r\n\r\nSouth of Whitney, the Sierra subsides rapidly and merges into the high\r\nplateaus and minor ranges of southern California.\r\n\r\nSeventy-five miles of the crest of this titanic range at the climax of\r\nits magnificence, sixty-five miles of it north of Whitney and ten miles\r\nof it south, constitute the western boundary of an area of sixteen\r\nhundred square miles which Congress is considering setting apart under\r\nthe title of the Roosevelt National Park; a region so particularly\r\ncharacterized by ruggedness, power, and unified purpose that it is\r\neminently fitted to serve as the nation's memorial to Theodore\r\nRoosevelt. Besides its stupendous mountains, it includes the wildest and\r\nmost exuberant forested canyons, and the most luxuriant groves in the\r\nUnited States, for its boundaries will enclose also the present Sequoia\r\nNational Park, in which a million trunks of the famous Sequoia\r\nWashingtoniana cluster around the General Sherman Tree, believed to be\r\nthe biggest and oldest living thing in all the world.\r\n\r\nWide though its range from bleak crest to warm forest, every part of\r\nthis region is a necessary part of its whole. Nature's subtle finger has\r\nso knitted each succeeding zone into the fabric of its neighbors that it\r\nwould be a vandal's hand which should arbitrarily cut the picture short\r\nof the full completion of its perfect composition. It is one of Nature's\r\nmasterpieces, through whose extremest contrasts runs the common note of\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\nWhether or not, then, Congress insures its perpetuity and unified\r\ndevelopment, we can consider it scenically only as a whole.\r\n\r\nSimilar in kind to the Yosemite National Park, Roosevelt is far ruggeder\r\nand more masterful. It will be the national park of superlatives. Yet\r\neach of these similar areas is a completed unit of striking\r\nindividuality. Yosemite, taking its note from its incomparable Valley,\r\nnever will be equalled for sheer beauty; Roosevelt knows no peer for\r\nexuberance and grandeur. Yosemite will remain Mecca for the tourist;\r\nRoosevelt will draw into its forest of giant trees, and upon its\r\nshoulders of chiselled granite, thousands of campers-out and lovers of\r\nthe high trail.\r\n\r\nJoined near the crest of the Sierra by the John Muir Trail,\r\nCalifornia's memorial to her own prophet of the out-of-doors, these two\r\nnational parks, so alike and yet so different, each striking surely its\r\nown note of sublimity, are, in a very real sense, parts of one still\r\ngreater whole; the marriage of beauty and strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe region is roughly pear-shaped. A straight line drawn from Pine Creek\r\nPass at its northern end to Sheep Mountain on the southern base line\r\nmeasures sixty-eight miles; the park is thirty-six miles wide at its\r\nwidest, just north of Mount Whitney. Its eastern boundary, the crest of\r\nthe Sierra, divides many notable peaks. From north to south we pass, as\r\nwe travel the John Muir Trail, Mount Humphreys, 13,972 feet; Mount\r\nDarwin, 13,841 feet; Mount Winchell, 13,749 feet; Split Mountain, 14,051\r\nfeet; Striped Mountain, 13,160 feet; Mount Baxter, 13,118 feet; Junction\r\nPeak, 13,903 feet; Mount Tyndall, 14,025 feet; and Mount Whitney, 14,501\r\nfeet; supporting Whitney on the south is Mount Langley, 14,042 feet; all\r\nthese connected by splintered peaks, granite ledges, and mountain masses\r\nscarcely less in altitude.\r\n\r\nBetween the bristling crest of this snow-daubed eastern boundary and the\r\npark's western boundary, thousands of feet lower where the forests\r\nbegin, the region roughly divides into parallel zones. That which\r\nimmediately adjoins the crest upon its west side, a strip ten miles or\r\nmore in width, is known to its devotees as the High Sierra. It is a\r\ncountry of tremendous jagged peaks, of intermediate pinnacled walls, of\r\nenormous cirques holding remnants of once mighty glaciers, of great\r\nfields of sun-cupped snow, of turquoise lakes resting in chains upon\r\nenormous granite steps; the whole gleaming like chased silver in the\r\nnoon sun; a magical land of a thousand Matterhorns, whose trails lead\r\nfrom temple to temple, so mighty of size and noble of design that no\r\nmind less than the Creator's could ever have conceived them.\r\n\r\nThe High Sierra has been celebrated for many years in the fast-growing\r\nbrotherhood of American mountain climbers, east as well as west, many of\r\nwhom proclaim its marked superiority to all parts of the Swiss Alps\r\nexcept the amazing neighborhood of Mont Blanc. With the multiplication\r\nof trails and the building of shelters for the comfort of the\r\ninexperienced, the veriest amateur of city business life will find in\r\nthese mountains of perpetual sunshine a satisfaction which is only for\r\nthe seasoned mountaineer abroad.\r\n\r\nThe zone adjoining the High Sierra upon its west is one of far wider\r\nrange of pleasure. Subsiding rapidly in elevation, it becomes a knobbed\r\nand bouldered land which includes timber-line and the thin forests of\r\nwind-twisted pines which contend with the granite for foothold. It is\r\ncrossed westward by many lesser ranges buttressing the High Sierra; from\r\nthese cross ranges many loftier peaks arise, and between them roar the\r\nrivers whose thousands of contributing streams drain the snow-fields and\r\nthe glaciers of the white heights.\r\n\r\nFinally, paralleling the western boundary, is the narrow zone in which\r\nthis region meets and merges with the greater forests and the meadows\r\nbeyond the boundary. Here, in the southwestern corner, is the marvellous\r\nwarm forest in which trees of many kinds attain their maximum of size\r\nand proportion, and which encloses a million sequoia trees, including\r\nthe greatest and oldest embodiments of the principle of life. This\r\nextraordinary forest was reserved in 1890 under the title of the Sequoia\r\nNational Park. At the same time was created the General Grant National\r\nPark, a reservation of four square miles of similar forest, virtually a\r\npart of it, but separated because of an intervening area of privately\r\nowned lands.\r\n\r\nThus does this region run the gamut of supremacy from the High Sierra\r\nupon its east, to the Giant Forest upon its west.\r\n\r\nOf no less distinction are its waters. Innumerable lakelets of the High\r\nSierra, born of the snows, overflow in tiny streams which combine into\r\nroaring, frothing creeks. These in turn, augmented by the drainage of\r\nthe lofty tumbled divides, combine into powerful little rivers. Four\r\nriver systems originate in this region.\r\n\r\nFar in the north a lake, more than eleven thousand feet high, lying at\r\nthe western foot of Mount Goddard, begins the South Fork of the San\r\nJoaquin River, which drains the park's northern area. Incidentally, it\r\nhas cut a canyon of romantic beauty, up which the John Muir Trail finds\r\nits way into the park.\r\n\r\nThe northern middle area of the park is drained by the Middle and South\r\nForks of the Kings River, which find their origins in perhaps forty\r\nmiles of Sierra's crest. The drainage basins of these splendid streams\r\ncover nearly half of the park's total area, and include some of the\r\nbiggest, as well as some of the wildest and most beautiful mountain\r\nscenery in the world. Bounded upon their west by an arc of snowy\r\nmountains, separated by the gigantic Monarch Divide, flanked by twisted\r\nranges and towering peaks, they cascade westward through meadows of rank\r\ngrasses and vividly colored wild-flowers, alternating with steep-sided\r\ngorges and canyons of sublimity. Dropping thousands of feet within a few\r\nmiles, they abound in cascades and majestic falls, between which swift\r\nrapids alternate with reaches of stiller, but never still, waters which\r\nare the homes of cut-throat trout. Each of these rivers has its canyon\r\nof distinguished magnificence. The Tehipite Valley of the Middle Fork\r\nand the Kings River Canyon of the South Fork are destined to world\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\nThe southwestern area of the park is drained by five forks of the\r\nbeautiful Kaweah River. These streams originate on the north in the\r\ndivide of the South Fork of the Kings River, and on the east in a\r\nconspicuously fine range known as the Great Western Divide. They wind\r\nthrough the wooded valleys of the Sequoia National Park. Upon their\r\nbanks grow the monsters of the American forest.\r\n\r\nThe southern area is drained by the Kern River, into which flow the\r\nwaters of Mount Whitney and his giant neighbors. The Kern Canyon is one\r\nof Roosevelt's noblest expressions. Flowing southward between\r\nprecipitous walls three thousand feet and more in height, flanked upon\r\nthe east by monsters of the High Sierra, and on the west by the splendid\r\nelevations of the Great Western Divide, it is a valley supremely fitted\r\nfor the highest realization of the region's gifts of enjoyment. From\r\ncamps beside its trout-haunted waters, it is a matter of no difficulty\r\nfor those equipped for the trail to reach the summit of Whitney, on the\r\none hand, and the Giant Forest on the other.\r\n\r\nNear the southern boundary of the park, Golden Trout Creek enters the\r\nKern. It originates at the very crest of the Sierra, which it follows\r\nclosely for many miles before swinging westward to its outlet. In this\r\nstream is found a trout which appears, when fresh caught, as though\r\ncarved from gold. Popularly it is known as the golden trout; its\r\nscientific name is Salmo Rooseveltii. Originally, no doubt, the color\r\nevolved from the peculiar golden hues of the rocks through which its\r\nwaters flow. The golden trout has been transplanted into other Sierra\r\nstreams, in some of which, notably the open upper waters of the Middle\r\nFork of the Kings, it has thrived and maintained its vivid hue. In\r\nsheltered waters it has apparently disappeared, a fact which may merely\r\nmean that its color has changed with environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere are many gateways, two by road, the rest by trail. For years to\r\ncome, as in the past, the great majority of visitors will enter through\r\nthe Giant Forest of the Sequoia National Park and through the General\r\nGrant National Park. The traveller by rail will find motor stages at\r\nVisalia for the run into the Giant Forest, and at Fresno for the General\r\nGrant National Park. The motorist will find good roads into both from\r\nCalifornia's elaborate highway system. In both the traveller will find\r\nexcellent hotel camps, and, if his purpose is to live awhile under his\r\nprivate canvas, public camp grounds convenient to stores and equipped\r\nwith water supply and even electric lights. Under the gigantic pines,\r\nfirs, and ancient sequoias of these extraordinary forests, increasing\r\nthousands spend summer weeks and months.\r\n\r\nFrom these centres the lovers of the sublime take saddle-horses and\r\npack-trains, or, if they are hikers, burros to carry their equipment,\r\nand follow the trails to Kern Canyon, or the summit of Whitney, or the\r\nKings River Canyon, or the Tehipite Valley, or the John Muir Trail upon\r\nthe Sierra's crest. Many are the trip combinations, the choice of which\r\ndepends upon the time and the strenuousness of the traveller.\r\nCamping-out on trail in Roosevelt is an experience which demands\r\nrepetition. Sure of clear weather, the traveller does not bother with\r\ntents, but snuggles at night in a sleeping-bag under a roof of spreading\r\npine.\r\n\r\nBut it is possible to equip for the trail elsewhere. The principal\r\npoint upon the north is the Yosemite National Park, where one may\r\nprovide himself with horses and supplies for a journey of any desired\r\nduration. Starting in the Yosemite Valley, and leaving the park near the\r\ncarved cirques of Mount Lyell, the traveller will find the intervening\r\nmiles of the John Muir Trail a panorama of magnificence. Thousand Island\r\nLake, reflecting the glorious pyramid of Banner Peak, the Devil's\r\nPostpile, a group of basaltic columns, far finer than Ireland's\r\ncelebrated Giant's Causeway, the Mono Valley, with its ancient volcano\r\nsplit down through the middle so that all may see its vent and spreading\r\ncrater, are merely the more striking features of a progress of\r\nspectacles to the north entrance of Roosevelt Park; this is at the\r\njunction of the South Fork of the San Joaquin River and Piute Creek. The\r\nprincipal eastern gateway is Kearsarge Pass, on the crest of the Sierra\r\na few miles north of Mount Whitney. The trail ascends from Independence,\r\nwhere one also may comfortably outfit.\r\n\r\nThese four are, at this writing, the principal entrance gates, each\r\nopening from points at which parties may be sure of securing horses,\r\nequipment, and guides. But several other trails enter from the east,\r\nsouth, southwest, and west sides. All of these in time will become, with\r\ndevelopment, well travelled trails into the heart of the great\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAny description of the glories of the John Muir Trail from its entrance\r\ninto the park to its climax upon the summit of Mount Whitney far passes\r\nthe limits of a chapter. In time it will inspire a literature.\r\n\r\nApproaching from Yosemite through the canyon of the San Joaquin, the\r\ntraveller swings around the north side of Mount Goddard, crosses\r\ngorgeous Muir Pass, and enters the fringe of cirques and lakes which\r\nborders the western edge of Sierra's crest from end to end. Through this\r\nhe winds his way southward, skirting lakes, crossing snow-fields,\r\nencircling templed cirques, plunging into canyons, climbing divides,\r\nrounding gigantic peaks, surprising views of sublimity, mounting ever\r\nhigher until he stands upon the shoulders of Mount Whitney. Dismounting\r\nhere, he scrambles up the few hundred feet of stiff climb which places\r\nhim on the summit, from which he looks out north, west, and south over\r\nthe most diversified high mountain landscape in America, and eastward\r\nover the Sierra foothills to Death Valley, lowest land in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNo thrilling Alpine feat is the ascent of our loftiest summit. But those\r\nwho want to measure human strength and skill in terms of perpendicular\r\ngranite may find among Whitney's neighbors peaks which will present\r\nharder problems than those offered abroad, peaks which themselves well\r\nmay become as celebrated in future years.\r\n\r\nThe John Muir Trail is destined to a fame and a use perhaps many times\r\nas great as those men thought who conceived it as a memorial to a lover\r\nof the trail, and of all that that implies. It will play a distinguished\r\npart in the education of the nation in the love of mountains. It will\r\nwin artists to a phase of the sublime in America which they have\r\noverlooked. It will bring students to the classrooms where Nature\r\ndisplays her most tremendous exhibits.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Roosevelt's lower levels will draw many times as many\r\ndevotees as will the High Sierra; and these visitors will stay longer.\r\nIt is the valleys and the canyons which will prove the greatest lure,\r\nfor here one may camp leisurely and in entire comfort, and thence make\r\nwhat trips he chooses into the regions of the peaks and the cirques.\r\n\r\nThere are literally thousands of canyons and of many kinds. Besides the\r\nKern Canyon there are two which must rank with Yosemite. In the summer\r\nof 1916 I travelled the length of the park, as far as the Giant Forest,\r\nwith a party led by Director Stephen T. Mather, of the National Park\r\nService, then Assistant to the Secretary of the Interior, and was\r\npowerfully impressed with the scenic qualities of the Tehipite Valley,\r\nand the Kings River Canyon, at that time little known.\r\n\r\nTime will not dim my memory of Tehipite Dome, the august valley and the\r\nleaping, singing river which it overlooks. Well short of the Yosemite\r\nValley in the kind of beauty that plunges the observer into silence,\r\nthe Tehipite Valley far excels it in bigness, power, and majesty.\r\nLookout Point on the north rim, a couple of miles south of the Dome,\r\ngave us our first sensation. Three thousand feet above the river, it\r\noffered by far the grandest valley view I have looked upon, for the rim\r\nview into Yosemite by comparison is not so grand as it is beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe canyon revealed itself to the east as far as Mount Woodworth, its\r\nlofty diversified walls lifting precipitously from the heavy forests of\r\nthe floor and sides, and yielding to still greater heights above.\r\nEnormous cliffs abutted, Yosemite-like, at intervals. South of us,\r\ndirectly across the canyon, rose the strenuous heights of the Monarch\r\nDivide, Mount Harrington, towering a thousand feet higher above the\r\nvalley floor than Clouds Rest above the Yosemite. Down the slopes of the\r\nMonarch Divide, seemingly from its turreted summits, cascaded many\r\nfrothing streams. The Eagle Peaks, Blue Canyon Falls, Silver Spur, the\r\nGorge of Despair, Lost Canyon--these were some of the romantic and\r\nappropriate titles we found on the Geological Survey map.\r\n\r\nAnd, close at hand, opposite Mount Harrington and just across Crown\r\nCreek Canyon, rose mighty Tehipite. We stood level with its rounded\r\nglistening dome. The Tehipite Dome is a true Yosemite feature. It\r\ncompares in height and prominence with El Capitan. In fact, it stands\r\nhigher above the valley floor and occupies a similar position at the\r\nvalley's western gate. It is not so massive as El Capitan, and therefore\r\nnot so impressive; but it is superb. It is better compared with Half\r\nDome, though again perhaps not so impressive. But it has its own august\r\npersonality, as notably so as either of these world-famed rocks; and, if\r\nit stood in the Yosemite, would share with them the incomparable\r\nvalley's highest honors.\r\n\r\nDescending to the floor, the whole aspect of the valley changed. Looking\r\nup, Tehipite Dome, now outlined against the sky, and the neighboring\r\nabrupt castellated walls, towered more hugely than ever. We did not need\r\nthe contour map to know that some of these heights exceeded Yosemite's.\r\nThe sky-line was fantastically carved into spires and domes, a\r\ncounterpart in gigantic miniature of the Great Sierra of which it was\r\nthe valley climax. The Yosemite measure of sublimity, perhaps, lacked,\r\nbut in its place was a more rugged grandeur, a certain suggestion of\r\nvastness and power that I have not seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis impression was strengthened by the floor itself, which contains no\r\nsuggestion whatever of Yosemite's exquisiteness. Instead, it offers\r\nrugged spaciousness. In place of Yosemite's peaceful woods and meadows,\r\nhere were tangled giant-studded thickets and mountainous masses of\r\nenormous broken talus. Instead of the quiet winding Merced, here was a\r\nsurging, smashing, frothing, cascading, roaring torrent, several times\r\nits volume, which filled the valley with its turbulence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Herbert W. Gleason_\r\n\r\nTEHIPITE DOME, GUARDIAN ROCK OF THE TEHIPITE VALLEY\r\n\r\nIt rises abruptly more than three thousand feet; proposed Roosevelt\r\nNational Park]\r\n\r\nOnce step foot on the valley floor and all thought of comparison with\r\nYosemite vanishes forever. This is a different thing altogether, but a\r\nthing in its own way no less superlative. The keynote of the Tehipite\r\nValley is wild exuberance. It thrills where Yosemite enervates. Yet its\r\ntemperature is quite as mild.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Fork contains more trout than any other stream I have fished.\r\nWe found them in pools and riffles everywhere; no water was too white to\r\nget a rise. In the long, greenish-white borders of fast rapids they\r\nfloated continually into view. In five minutes' watching I could count a\r\ndozen or more such appearances within a few feet of water. They ran from\r\neight to fourteen inches. No doubt larger ones lay below. So I got great\r\nfun by picking my particular trout and casting specially for him. Stop\r\nyour fly's motion and the pursuing fish instantly stops, backs, swims\r\nround the lure in a tour of examination, and disappears. Start it moving\r\nand he instantly reappears from the white depth, where, no doubt, he has\r\nbeen cautiously watching. A pause and a swift start often tempted to a\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nThese rainbows of the torrents are hard fighters. And many of them, if\r\nungently handled, availed of swift currents to thresh themselves free.\r\n\r\nYou must fish a river to appreciate it. Standing on its edges, leaping\r\nfrom rock to rock, slipping waist deep at times, wading recklessly to\r\nreach some pool or eddy of special promise, searching the rapids,\r\npeering under the alders, testing the pools; that's the way to make\r\nfriends with a river. You study its moods and its ways as those of a\r\nmettlesome horse.\r\n\r\nAnd after a while its spirit seeps through and finds yours. Its\r\npersonality unveils. A sweet friendliness unites you, a sense of mutual\r\nunderstanding. There follows the completest detachment that I know.\r\nYears and the worries disappear. You and the river dream away the\r\nunnoted hours.\r\n\r\nPassing on from the Tehipite Valley to the Kings River Canyon, the\r\napproach to Granite Pass was nothing short of magnificent. We crossed a\r\nsuperb cirque studded with lakelets; we could see the pass ahead of us\r\non a fine snow-crowned bench. We ascended the bench and found ourselves,\r\nnot in the pass, but in the entrance to still another cirque, also\r\nlake-studded, a loftier, nobler cirque encircling the one below. Ahead\r\nof us upon another lofty bench surely was the pass. Those inspiring\r\nsnow-daubed heights whose serrated edges cut sharply into the sky\r\ncertainly marked the supreme summit. Our winding trail up steep, rocky\r\nascents pointed true; an hour's toil would carry us over. But the hour\r\npassed and the crossing of the shelf disclosed, not the glowing valley\r\nof the South Fork across the pass, but still a vaster, nobler cirque\r\nabove, sublime in Arctic glory!\r\n\r\nHow the vast glaciers that cut these titanic carvings must have swirled\r\namong these huge concentric walls, pouring over this shelf and that,\r\npiling together around these uplifting granite peaks, concentrating\r\ncombined effort upon this unyielding mass and that, and, beaten back,\r\npouring down the tortuous main channel with rendings and tearings\r\nunimaginable!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Herbert W. Gleason_\r\n\r\nEAST VIDETTE FROM A FOREST OF FOXTAIL PINES\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great granite peaks of the proposed Roosevelt\r\nNational Park]\r\n\r\nGranite Pass is astonishing! We saw no less than four of these vast\r\nconcentric cirques, through three of which we passed. And the Geological\r\nSurvey map discloses a tributary basin adjoining which enclosed a group\r\nof large volcanic lakes, and doubtless other vast cirque-like chambers.\r\n\r\nWe took photographs, but knew them vain.\r\n\r\nA long, dusty descent of Copper Creek brought us, near day's end, into\r\nthe exquisite valley of the South Fork of the Kings River, the Kings\r\nRiver Canyon.\r\n\r\nStill another Yosemite!\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy to differentiate the two canyons of the Kings. They\r\nare similar and yet very different. Perhaps the difference lies chiefly\r\nin degree. Both lie east and west, with enormous rocky bluffs rising on\r\neither side of rivers of quite extraordinary beauty. Both present carved\r\nand castellated walls of exceptional boldness of design. Both are\r\nheavily and magnificently wooded, the forests reaching up sharp slopes\r\non either side. Both possess to a marked degree the quality that lifts\r\nthem above the average of even the Sierra's glacial valleys.\r\n\r\nBut the outlines here seem to be softer, the valley floor broader, the\r\nriver less turbulent. If the keynote of the Tehipite Valley is wild\r\nexuberance, that of the Kings River Canyon is wild beauty. The one\r\nexcites, the other lulls. The one shares with Yosemite the distinction\r\nof extraordinary outline, the other shares with Yosemite the distinction\r\nof extraordinary charm.\r\n\r\nThere are few nobler spots than the junction of Copper Creek with the\r\nKings. The Grand Sentinel is seldom surpassed. It fails of the\r\npersonality of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Tehipite, but it only just\r\nfails. If they did not exist, it would become the most celebrated rock\r\nin the Sierra, at least. The view up the canyon from this spot has few\r\nequals. The view down the canyon is not often excelled. When the day of\r\nthe Kings River Canyon dawns, it will dawn brilliantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe western slopes of the Pacific ranges, from the Canadian border\r\nsouthward to the desert, carry the most luxuriant forest in the United\r\nStates. The immense stands of yellow pine and Douglas fir of the far\r\nnorth merge into the sugar pines and giant sequoias of the south in\r\npractically an unbroken belt which, on Sierra's slopes, lies on the\r\nmiddle levels between the low productive plains of the west and the\r\ntowering heights of the east. The Sequoia National Park and its little\r\nneighbor, the General Grant National Park, enclose areas of remarkable\r\nfertility in which trees, shrubs, and wild flowers reach their greatest\r\ndevelopment. The million sequoia trees which grow here are a very small\r\npart, numerically, of this amazing forest.\r\n\r\nThese slopes are rich with the soil of thousands of years of\r\naccumulations. They are warmed in summer by mild Pacific winds heated in\r\ntheir passage across the lowlands, and blanketed in winter by many feet\r\nof soft snow. They are damp with countless springs and streams sheltered\r\nunder heavy canopies of foliage. In altitude they range from two\r\nthousand feet at the bottom of Kaweah's canyon, as it emerges from the\r\npark, to eight thousand feet in the east, with mountains rising three or\r\nfour thousand feet higher. It is a tumbled land of ridges and canyons,\r\nbut its slopes are easy and its outline gracious. Oases of luscious\r\nmeadows dot the forests.\r\n\r\nThis is the Court of King Sequoia. Here assemble in everlasting\r\nattendance millions of his nobles, a statelier gathering than ever bowed\r\nthe knee before human potentate. Erect, majestic, clothed in togas of\r\nperpetual green, their heads bared to the heavens, stand rank upon rank,\r\nmile upon mile, the noblest personalities of the earth.\r\n\r\nChief among the courtiers of the king is the sugar-pine, towering here\r\nhis full two hundred feet, straight as a ruler, his stem at times eight\r\nfeet in thickness, scarcely tapering to the heavy limbs of his high\r\ncrown. Largest and most magnificent of the Pacific pines, reaching\r\nsometimes six hundred years of age, the greater trunks clear themselves\r\nof branches a hundred feet from the ground, and the bark develops long\r\ndark plates of armor. So marked is his distinguished personality that,\r\nonce seen, he never can be mistaken for another.\r\n\r\nNext in rank and scarcely less in majesty is the massive white fir,\r\nrising at times even to two hundred feet, his sometimes six-foot trunk\r\nconspicuously rough, dark brown in color, deeply furrowed with ashen\r\ngray. His pale yellow-green crown is mysteriously tinged with white. His\r\nlimit of age is three hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nLast of the ranking trio is the western yellow pine, a warrior clad in\r\nplates of russet armor. A hundred and sixty feet in natural height, here\r\nhe sometimes towers even with his fellow knights. He guards the outer\r\nprecincts of the court, his cap of yellow-green, his branching arms\r\nresting upon his sides.\r\n\r\nThese are the great nobles, but with them are millions of lesser\r\ncourtiers, the incense cedar from whose buttressed, tapering trunks\r\nspring countless branches tipped with fan-like plumes; many lesser\r\nconifers; the splendid Pacific birches in picturesque pose; the oaks of\r\nmany kinds far different from their eastern cousins. And among the feet\r\nof these courtiers of higher degree crowd millions upon millions of\r\nflowering shrubs, massing often in solid phalanxes, disputing passage\r\nwith the deer.\r\n\r\nAll mingle together, great and small. The conifers, in the king's honor,\r\nflaunt from stem and greater branch long fluttering ribbons of pale\r\ngreen moss. Thousands of squirrels chatter in the branches. Millions of\r\nbirds make music. It is a gala day.\r\n\r\nEnter the King.\r\n\r\nThe King of Trees is of royal lineage. The patient searchers in the\r\nrocks of old have traced his ancestry unknown millions of years, back to\r\nthe forests of the Cretaceous Period. His was Viking stock from arctic\r\nzones where trees can live no more.\r\n\r\nTo-day he links all human history. The identical tree around which\r\ngather thousands of human courtiers every year emerged, a seedling,\r\nwhile Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem. No man knows how old his\r\npredecessors were when finally they sank into death--mighty fall! But\r\nJohn Muir counted four thousand rings in the trunk of one fallen giant,\r\nwho must have lived while Pharaoh still held captive the Children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nThe General Sherman Tree of the Giant Forest, the oldest living thing\r\nto-day, so far as I have been able to ascertain, probably has seen\r\nthirty-six hundred years. It is evident to the unlearned observer that,\r\nwhile mature, he is long short of the turn of life. A thousand years\r\nfrom now he still may be the earth's biggest and oldest living thing;\r\nhow much beyond that none may venture to predict.\r\n\r\nPicture, now, the Giant Forest, largest of the several sequoia groves in\r\nthe Sequoia National Park. You have entered, say, in the dusk of the\r\nnight before, and after breakfast wander planless among the trees. On\r\nevery side rise the huge pines and firs, their dark columns springing\r\nfrom the tangled brush to support the cathedral roof above. Here an\r\nenormous purplish-red column draws and holds your astonished eye. It is\r\na gigantic thing in comparison with its monster neighbors; it glows\r\namong their dull columns; it is clean and spotless amid their mosshung\r\ntrunks; branchless, it disappears among their upper foliage, hinting at\r\nsteeple heights above. Yet your guide tells you that this tree is small;\r\nthat its diameter is less than twenty feet; that in age it is a\r\nyoungster of only two thousand years! Wait, he tells you, till you see\r\nthe General Sherman Tree's thirty-six and a half feet of diameter; wait\r\ntill you see the hundreds, yes thousands, which surpass this infant!\r\n\r\nBut you heed him not, for you see another back among those sugar pines!\r\nYes, and there's another. And there on the left are two or three in a\r\nclump! Back in the dim cathedral aisles are reddish glows which must\r\nmean still others. Your heart is beating with a strange emotion. You\r\nlook up at the enormous limbs bent at right angles, at the canopy of\r\nfeathery foliage hanging in ten thousand huge plumes. You cry aloud for\r\nthe sheer joy of this great thing, and plunge into the forest's heart.\r\n\r\nThe Giant Forest contains several thousand sequoia trees of large size,\r\nand many young trees. You see these small ones on every hand, erect,\r\nsharply pointed, giving in every line a vivid impression of quivering,\r\nbounding life. Later on, as they emerge above the roof of the forest,\r\nfor some of them are more than three hundred feet high, they lose their\r\nsharp ambitious tops; they become gracefully rounded. Springing from\r\nseed less than a quarter of an inch in diameter, they tend, like their\r\ncousins the redwoods, to grow in groups, and these groups tend to grow\r\nin groves. But there are scattering individuals in every grove, and many\r\nsmall isolated groves in the Sierra. The Giant Forest is the largest\r\ngrove of greatest trees. The General Grant Grove, in a small national\r\npark of its own, near by, is the second grove in size and importance;\r\nits central figure is the General Grant Tree, second in size and age to\r\nthe General Sherman Tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by S.H. Willard_\r\n\r\nBULL FROG LAKE, PROPOSED ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nAlong the crest of the Sierra extends a region of lofty cirques and\r\ninnumerable glacier-fed lakelets]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNDER A GIANT SEQUOIA\r\n\r\nFrom right to left: Benjamin Ide Wheeler, William Loeb, Jr., Nicholas\r\nMurray Butler, John Muir, Surgeon-General Rixey, U.S.N., Theodore\r\nRoosevelt, then President, George C.

Imagine these limbs bent\r\nhorizontally at right angles, like huge elbows, as though holding its\r\ngreen mantle close about its form. Imagine the upper branches nearly\r\nbare, shattered perhaps by lightning. And imagine its crown of foliage,\r\ndark yellowish-green, hanging in enormous graceful plumes.\r\n\r\nThis is the King of Trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF THE ROCKIES\r\n\r\nTHE ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, NORTH CENTRAL COLORADO. AREA, 398\r\nSQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and the Cascade Range of\r\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington have each three national parks which\r\nfully represent their kind and quality. The great central system of the\r\nUnited States, the Rocky Mountains, which also possess three national\r\nparks, are represented in kind by only one, for Yellowstone is an\r\nexceptional volcanic interlude, and Glacier is the chance upheaval of\r\nshales and limestones from a period antedating the granite Rockies by\r\nmany millions of years; neither in any sense exhibits the nature and\r\nscenic quality of the backbone of our continent.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons for the extraordinary distinction of the\r\nreservation appropriately called the Rocky Mountain National Park,\r\nnamely that it is the only true example of the continental mountain\r\nsystem in the catalogue of our national parks. It is well, therefore, to\r\nlay the foundations for a sound comprehension of its differentiating\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountains, which began to rise at the close of the Cretaceous\r\nPeriod at a rate so slow that geologists think they are making a pace\r\nto-day as rapid as their maximum, extend from the plateau of New Mexico\r\nnorthwesterly until they merge into the mountains of eastern Alaska. In\r\nthe United States physiographers consider them in two groups, the\r\nNorthern Rockies and the Southern Rockies, the point of division being\r\nthe elevated Wyoming Basin. There are numerous ranges, known, like the\r\nWasatch Mountains, by different names, which nevertheless are consistent\r\nparts of the Rocky Mountain System.\r\n\r\nThe Rockies attain their most imposing mass and magnificence in their\r\nsouthern group, culminating in Colorado. So stupendous is this heaping\r\ntogether of granitic masses that in Colorado alone are found forty-two\r\nof the fifty-five named peaks in the United States which attain the\r\naltitude of fourteen thousand feet. Of the others, twelve are in the\r\nSierra of California, and one, Mount Rainier, in Washington. Mount\r\nElbert, in Colorado, our second highest peak, rises within eighty-two\r\nfeet of the height of California's Mount Whitney, our first in rank;\r\nColorado's Mount Massive attains an altitude only four feet less than\r\nWashington's Mount Rainier, which ranks third. In point of mass, one\r\nseventh of Colorado rises above ten thousand feet of altitude. The state\r\ncontains three hundred and fifty peaks above eleven thousand feet of\r\naltitude, two hundred and twenty peaks above twelve thousand feet, and a\r\nhundred and fifty peaks above thirteen thousand feet; besides the\r\nforty-two named peaks which exceed fourteen thousand feet, there are at\r\nleast three others which are unnamed.\r\n\r\nGeologists call the Rockies young, by which they mean anything, say,\r\nfrom five to twenty million years. They are more or less contemporary\r\nwith the Sierra. Like the Sierra, the mountains we see to-day are not\r\nthe first; several times their ranges have uplifted upon wrecks of\r\nformer ranges, which had yielded to the assaults of frost and rain.\r\nBefore they first appeared, parts of the Eastern Appalachians had\r\nparalleled our eastern sea coast for many million years. The Age of\r\nMammals had well dawned before they became a feature in a landscape\r\nwhich previously had been a mid-continental sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Front Range, carrying the continental divide, is a gnarled and\r\njagged rampart of snow-splashed granite facing the eastern plains, from\r\nwhich its grim summits may be seen for many miles. Standing out before\r\nit like captains in front of gray ranks at parade rise three conspicuous\r\nmountains, Longs Peak, fifty miles northwest of Denver, Mount Evans,\r\nwest of Denver, and Pikes Peak, seventy miles to the south. Longs Peak\r\nis directly connected with the continental divide by a series of jagged\r\ncliffs. Mount Evans is farther away. Pikes Peak stands sentinel-like\r\nseventy-five miles east of the range, a gigantic monadnock, remainder\r\nand reminder of a former range long ages worn away.\r\n\r\nThough many massive mountains of greater altitude lie farther west, the\r\nFront Range for many reasons is representative of the Rockies' noblest.\r\nTo represent them fully, the national park should include the three\r\nsentinel peaks and their neighborhoods, and it is earnestly hoped that\r\nthe day will come when Congress will recognize this need. At this\r\nwriting only the section of greatest variety and magnificence, the\r\nnearly four hundred square miles of which Longs Peak is the climax, has\r\nbeen thus entitled. In fact, even this was unfortunately curtailed in\r\nthe making, the straight southern boundary having been arbitrarily drawn\r\nthrough the range at a point of sublimity, throwing out of the park the\r\nSt. Vrain Glaciers which form one of the region's wildest and noblest\r\nspectacles, and Arapaho Peak and its glaciers which in several respects\r\nconstitute a climax in Rocky Mountain scenery.\r\n\r\nThus carelessly cropped, despoiled of the completeness which Nature\r\nmeant it to possess, nevertheless the Rocky Mountain National Park is a\r\nreservation of distinguished charm and beauty. It straddles the\r\ncontinental divide, which bisects it lengthwise, north and south. The\r\nwestern slopes rise gently to the divide; at the divide, the eastern\r\nfront drops in a precipice several thousand feet deep, out of which\r\nfrosts, rains, glaciers and streams have gouged gigantic gulfs and\r\ngranite-bound vales and canyons, whose intervening cliffs are\r\nbattlemented walls and monoliths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Wiswall Brothers_\r\n\r\nESTES PARK PLATEAU, LOOKING EAST\r\n\r\nShowing the village and the foothills, which are remnants of a former\r\ngreat range, now almost washed away by erosion; Rocky Mountain National\r\nPark]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Wiswall Brothers_\r\n\r\nFRONT RANGE OF THE ROCKIES FROM BIERSTADT LAKE\r\n\r\nFrom right to left: Flattop Mountain, Tyndall Glacier, Hallett Peak,\r\nOtis Peak, Andrews Glacier]\r\n\r\nAs if these features were not enough to differentiate this national\r\npark from any other, Nature has provided still another element of\r\npopularity and distinction. East of this splendid rampart spreads a\r\nbroad area of rolling plateau, carpeted with wild flowers, edged and\r\ndotted with luxuriant groves of pine, spruce, fir, and aspen, and\r\ndiversified with hills and craggy mountains, carved rock walls, long\r\nforest-grown moraines and picturesque ravines; a stream-watered,\r\nlake-dotted summer and winter pleasure paradise of great size, bounded\r\non the north and west by snow-spattered monsters, and on the east and\r\nsouth by craggy wooded foothills, only less in size, and no less in\r\nbeauty than the leviathans of the main range. Here is summer living room\r\nenough for several hundred thousand sojourners from whose comfortable\r\ncamps and hotels the wild heart of the Rockies may be visited afoot or\r\non horseback between early breakfast and late supper at home.\r\n\r\nThis plateau has been known to summer visitors for many years under the\r\ntitles of several settlements; Moraine Park, Horseshoe Park, and Longs\r\nPeak, each had its hotels long before the national park was created;\r\nEstes Park and Allen's Park on the east side, and Grand Lake on the west\r\nside lie just outside the park boundaries, purposely excluded because of\r\ntheir considerable areas of privately owned land. Estes Park, the\r\nprincipal village and the distributing centre of all incoming routes\r\nfrom the east, is the Eastern Gateway; Grand Lake is the Western\r\nGateway.\r\n\r\nAnd still there is another distinction, one which will probably always\r\nhold for Rocky Mountain its present great lead in popularity. That is\r\nits position nearer to the middle of the country than other great\r\nnational parks, and its accessibility from large centres of population.\r\nDenver, which claims with some justice the title of Gateway to the\r\nNational Parks, meaning of course the eastern gateway to the western\r\nparks, is within thirty hours by rail from Chicago and St. Louis,\r\nthrough one or other of which most travellers from the east find it\r\nconvenient to reach the west. It is similarly conveniently located for\r\ntouring motorists, with whom all the national parks are becoming ever\r\nmore popular. From Denver several railroads lead to east-side towns,\r\nfrom which the park is reached by motor stages through the foothills,\r\nand a motor stage line runs directly from Denver to Estes Park,\r\nparalleling the range. The west side is reached through Granby.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEntry to the park by any route is dramatic. If the visitor comes the\r\nall-motor way through Ward he picks up the range at Arapaho Peak, and\r\nfollows it closely for miles. If he comes by any of the rail routes, his\r\nmotor stage emerges from the foothills upon a sudden spectacle of\r\nmagnificence--the snowy range, its highest summits crowned with cloud,\r\nlooming upon the horizon across the peaceful plateau. By any route the\r\nappearance of the range begins a panorama of ever-changing beauty and\r\ninspiration, whose progress will outlive many a summer's stay.\r\n\r\nHaving settled himself in one of the hotels or camps of the east-side\r\nplateau, the visitor faces the choice between two practical ways of\r\nenjoying himself. He may, as the majority seem to prefer, spend his\r\nweeks in the simple recreations familiar in our eastern hill and country\r\nresorts; he may motor a little, walk a little, fish a little in the Big\r\nThompson and its tributaries, read and botanize a little in the meadows\r\nand groves, golf a little on the excellent courses, climb a little on\r\nthe lesser mountains, and dance or play bridge in hotel parlors at\r\nnight. Or else he may avail himself of the extraordinary opportunity\r\nwhich Nature offers him in the mountains which spring from his\r\ncomfortable plateau, the opportunity of entering into Nature's very\r\nworkshop and of studying, with her for his teacher, the inner secrets\r\nand the mighty examples of creation.\r\n\r\nIn all our national parks I have wondered at the contentment of the\r\nmultitude with the less when the greater, and such a greater, was there\r\nfor the taking. But I ceased to criticize the so-called popular point of\r\nview when I realized that its principal cause was ignorance of the\r\nwealth within grasp rather than deliberate choice of the more\r\ncommonplace; instead, I write this book, hoping that it may help the\r\ncause of the greater pleasure. Especially is the Rocky Mountain National\r\nPark the land of opportunity because of its accessibility, and of the\r\nease with which its inmost sanctuaries may be entered, examined, and\r\nappreciated. The story is disclosed at every step. In fact the\r\nrevelation begins in the foothills on the way in from the railroad, for\r\nthe red iron-stained cliffs seen upon their eastern edges are remainders\r\nof former Rocky Mountains which disappeared by erosion millions of years\r\nago. The foothills themselves are remnants of mountains which once were\r\nmuch loftier than now, and the picturesque canyon of the Big Thompson,\r\nthrough which it may have been your good fortune to enter the park, is\r\nthe stream-cut outlet of a lake or group of lakes which once covered\r\nmuch of the national park plateau.\r\n\r\nSummer life on the plateau is as effective as a tonic. The altitude\r\nvaries from seven to nine thousand feet; Rocky Mountain's valley bottoms\r\nare higher than the summits of many peaks of celebrity elsewhere. On\r\nevery hand stretch miles of tumbled meadows and craggy cliffs. Many are\r\nthe excellent roads, upon which cluster, at intervals of miles, groups\r\nof hotels and camps. Here one may choose his own fashion of living, for\r\nthese hostelries range from the most formal and luxurious hotel to the\r\nsimplest collection of tents or log cabins around a central log dining\r\nstructure. Some of these camps are picturesque, the growth of years from\r\nthe original log hut. Some are equipped with modern comforts; others are\r\nas primitive as their beginnings. All the larger resorts have stables of\r\nriding horses, for riding is the fashion even with those who do not\r\nventure into the mountains.\r\n\r\nOr, one may camp out in the good old-fashioned way, and fry his own\r\nmorning bacon over his fire of sticks.\r\n\r\nWherever one lives, however one lives, in this broad tableland, he is\r\nunder the spell of the range. The call of the mountains is ever present.\r\nRiding, walking, motoring, fishing, golfing, sitting under the trees\r\nwith a book, continually he lifts his eyes to their calm heights.\r\nUnconsciously he throws them the first morning glance. Instinctively he\r\ngazes long upon their gleaming moonlit summits before turning in at\r\nnight. In time they possess his spirit. They calm him, exalt him,\r\nennoble him. Unconsciously he comes to know them in all their myriad\r\nmoods. Cold and stern before sunrise, brilliant and vivid in\r\nmid-morning, soft and restful toward evening, gorgeously colored at\r\nsunset, angry, at times terrifying, in storm, their fascination never\r\nweakens, their beauty changes but it does not lessen.\r\n\r\nMountains of the height of these live in constant communion with the\r\nsky. Mummy Mountain in the north and Longs Peak in the south continually\r\ngather handfuls of fleecy cloud. A dozen times a day a mist appears in\r\nthe blue, as if entangled while passing the towering summit. A few\r\nmoments later it is a tiny cloud; then, while you watch, it thickens and\r\nspreads and hides the peak. Ten minutes later, perhaps, it dissipates as\r\nrapidly as it gathered, leaving the granite photographed against the\r\nblue. Or it may broaden and settle till it covers a vast acreage of sky\r\nand drops a brief shower in near-by valleys, while meadows half a mile\r\naway are steeped in sunshine. Then, in a twinkling, all is clear again.\r\nSometimes, when the clearing comes, the summit is white with snow. And\r\nsometimes, standing upon a high peak in a blaze of sunshine from a\r\ncleared sky, one may look down for a few moments upon the top of one of\r\nthese settled clouds, knowing that it is sprinkling the hidden valley.\r\n\r\nThe charm of the mountains from below may satisfy many, but sooner or\r\nlater temptation is sure to beset. The desire comes to see close up\r\nthose monsters of mystery. Many, including most women, ignorant of\r\nrewards, refuse to venture because they fear hardship. \"I can never\r\nclimb mountains in this rarefied air,\" pleads one, and in most cases\r\nthis is true; it is important that persons unused to the higher\r\naltitudes be temperate and discreet. But the lungs and muscles of a\r\nwell-trained mountain horse are always obtainable, and the least\r\npractice will teach the unaccustomed rider that all he has to do is to\r\nsit his saddle limply and leave everything else to the horse. It is my\r\nproud boast that I can climb any mountain, no matter how high and\r\ndifficult, up which my horse can carry me.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last and inevitably, we ascend into the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe mountains within the park fall naturally in two groupings. The Front\r\nRange cuts the southern boundary midway and runs north to Longs Peak,\r\nwhere it swings westerly and carries the continental divide out of the\r\npark at its northwestern corner. The Mummy Range occupies the park's\r\nentire north end. The two are joined by a ridge 11,500 feet in altitude,\r\nover which the Fall River Road is building to connect the east and the\r\nwest sides of the park.\r\n\r\nThe lesser of these two, the Mummy Range, is a mountain group of\r\ndistinguished beauty. Its climax is an arc of gray monsters, Ypsilon\r\nMountain, 13,507 feet, Mount Fairchild, 13,502 feet, Hagues Peak, 13,562\r\nfeet, and Mount Dunraven, 12,326 feet; these gather around Mummy\r\nMountain with its 13,413 feet. A noble company, indeed, herded in close\r\ncomradeship, the centre of many square miles of summits scarcely less.\r\nYpsilon's big Greek letter, outlined in perpetual snow, is one of the\r\nfamous landmarks of the northern end. Hagues Peak supports Hallett\r\nGlacier, the most interesting in the park. Dunraven, aloof and of\r\nslenderer outline, offers marked contrast to the enormous sprawling bulk\r\nof Mummy, always portentous, often capped with clouds. The range is\r\nsplit by many fine canyons and dotted with glacial lakes, an undeveloped\r\nwilderness designed by kindly nature for summer exploration.\r\n\r\nBut it is the Front Range, the snowy pinnacled rampart, which commands\r\nprofoundest attention.\r\n\r\nFrom Specimen Mountain in the far northwest, a spill of lava, now the\r\nhaunt of mountain sheep, the continental divide southward piles climax\r\nupon climax. Following it at an elevation well exceeding twelve thousand\r\nfeet, the hardy, venturesome climber looks westward down a slope of bald\r\ngranite, thickly strewn with boulders; eastward he gazes into a\r\nsuccession of gigantic gorges dropping upon the east, forest grown,\r\nlake-set canyons deep in mid-foreground, the great plateau spreading to\r\nits foothills far beyond the canyons, with now and then a sun glint from\r\nsome irrigation pond beyond the foothills on the misty plains of eastern\r\nColorado. Past the monolith of Terra Tomah Peak, with its fine glacial\r\ngorge of many lakes, past the Sprague Glacier, largest of the several\r\nshrunken fields of moving ice which still remain, he finds, from the\r\nsummit of Flattop Mountain, a broad spectacle of real sublimity.\r\n\r\nBut there is a greater viewpoint close at hand. Crossing the Flattop\r\nTrail which here ascends from the settlements below on its way to the\r\nwest side, and skirting the top of the Tyndall Glacier, a scramble of\r\nfour hundred feet lands him on the summit of Hallett Peak, 12,725 feet\r\nin altitude. Here indeed is reward. Below him lies the sheer abyss of\r\nthe Tyndall Gorge, Dream Lake, a drop of turquoise in its depths; beyond\r\nit a moraine reaches out upon the plateau--six miles in length, a mile\r\nand more in width, nearly a thousand feet in height, holding Bierstadt\r\nLake upon its level forested crown, an eloquent reminder of that ancient\r\ntime when enormous glaciers ripped the granite from these gorges to heap\r\nit in long winding hills upon the plains below. Turning southerly, the\r\nWild Gardens further spread before his gaze, a tumble of granite masses\r\nrising from lake-dotted, richly forested bottoms. The entrance to Loch\r\nVale, gem canyon of the Rockies, lies in the valley foreground.\r\nAdjoining it, the entrance to Glacier Gorge, showing one of its several\r\nlakes, rests in peaceful contrast with its impressive eastern wall, a\r\nlong, winding, sharp-edged buttress pushing southward and upward to\r\nsupport the northern shoulder of the monster, Longs Peak, whose squared\r\nsummit, from here for all the world like a chef's cap, outlines sharply\r\nagainst the sky. Hallett Peak welcomes the climber to the Heart of the\r\nRockies at perhaps their most gorgeous point.\r\n\r\nSouth of Hallett difficult going will disclose new viewpoints of supreme\r\nwildness. Otis Peak, nearly as high as Hallett, looks down upon the\r\nAndrews Glacier, and displays the length of Loch Vale, at whose head\r\ntowers Taylor Peak, a giant exceeding thirteen thousand feet.\r\n\r\nI have not sketched this tour of the continental divide as a suggestion\r\nfor travel, for there are no trails, and none but the mountaineer,\r\nexperienced in pioneering, could accomplish it with pleasure and\r\nsuccess, but as a convenient mode of picturing the glories of the\r\ncontinental divide. Some day a trail, even perhaps a road, for one is\r\npracticable, should make it fully accessible to the greater public.\r\nMeantime Flattop Trail invites valley dwellers of all degrees, afoot and\r\nhorseback, up to a point on the divide from which Hallett's summit and\r\nits stupendous view is no great conquest.\r\n\r\nThe gorges of the Wild Gardens are most enjoyed from below. Trails of no\r\ndifficulty lead from the settlements to Fern and Odessa Lakes in a\r\ncanyon unsurpassed; to Bear Lake at the outlet of the Tyndall Gorge; to\r\nLoch Vale, whose flower-carpeted terraces and cirque lakelets, Sky Pond\r\nand the Lake of Glass, are encircled with mighty canyon walls; and to\r\nGlacier Gorge, which leads to the foot of Longs Peak's western\r\nprecipice. These are spots, each a day's round trip from convenient\r\novernight hotels, which deserve all the fame that will be theirs when\r\nthe people come to know them, for as yet only a few hundreds a summer of\r\nRocky Mountain's hundred thousand take the trouble to visit them.\r\n\r\nTo better understand the charm of these gray monsters, and the valleys\r\nand chasms between their knees, we must pause a moment to picture what\r\narchitects call the planting, for trees and shrubs and flowers play as\r\nimportant a part in the informal architectural scheme of the Front Range\r\nas they do in the formality of a palace. It will be recalled that the\r\nzones of vegetation from the equator to the frozen ice fields of the far\r\nnorth find their counterparts in altitude. The foothills bordering the\r\nRocky Mountain National Park lie in the austral zone of our middle and\r\neastern states; its splendid east-side plateau and inter-mountain\r\nvalleys represent the luxuriance of the Canadian zone; its mountains\r\npass rapidly up in a few thousand feet through the Hudsonian zone,\r\nincluding timber-line at about 11,500 feet; and its highest summits\r\ncarry only the mosses, lichens, stunted grasses, and tiny alpine\r\nflowerets of the Arctic Zone.\r\n\r\nThus one may walk waist deep through the marvellous wild flower meadows\r\nof Loch Vale, bordered by luxuriant forests of majestic Engelmann\r\nspruce, pines, firs, junipers, and many deciduous shrubs, and look\r\nupward at the gradations of all vegetation to the arctic seas.\r\n\r\nEspecially interesting is the revelation when one takes it in order,\r\nclimbing into the range. The Fall River Road displays it, but not\r\ndramatically; the forest approach is too long, the climb into the\r\nHudsonian Zone too short, and not typical. The same is true of the trail\r\nup beautiful Forest Canyon. The reverse is true of the Ute Trail, which\r\nbrings one too quickly to the stupendous arctic summit of Trail Ridge.\r\nThe Flattop Trail is in many respects the most satisfying, particularly\r\nif one takes the time to make the summit of Hallett Peak, and hunts for\r\narctic flowerets on the way. But one may also accomplish the purpose in\r\nLoch Vale by climbing all the way to Sky Pond, at the very foot of steep\r\nlittle Taylor Glacier, or by ascending Glacier Gorge to its head, or by\r\nclimbing the Twin Sisters, or Longs Peak as far as Boulder Field, or up\r\nthe St. Vrain valley to the top of Meadow Mountain, or Mount Copeland.\r\n\r\nAll of these ascents are made by fair trails, and all display the\r\nfascinating spectacle of timber-line, which in Rocky Mountain National\r\nPark, I believe, attains its most satisfying popular expression; by\r\nwhich I mean that here the panorama of the everlasting struggle between\r\nthe ambitious climbing forests and the winter gales of the summits seems\r\nto be condensed and summarized, to borrow a figure from the textbooks,\r\nas I have not happened to find it elsewhere. Following up some sheltered\r\nforested ravine to its head, we swing out upon the wind-swept slopes\r\nleading straight to the summit. Snow patches increase in size and number\r\nas the conifers thin and shrink. Presently the trees bend eastward,\r\npermanently mis-shaped by the icy winter blasts. Presently they curve in\r\nsemi-circles, or rise bravely in the lee of some great rock, to bend at\r\nright angles from its top. Here and there are full-grown trees growing\r\nprostrate, like a rug, upon the ground.\r\n\r\nClose to the summit trees shrink to the size of shrubs, but some of\r\nthese have heavy trunks a few feet high, and doubtless have attained\r\ntheir fulness of development. Gradually they thin and disappear, giving\r\nplace to wiry, powerful, deciduous shrubs, and these in turn to growths\r\nstill smaller. There are forests of willows just above Rocky Mountain's\r\ntimber-line, two or three inches tall, and many acres in extent.\r\n\r\nFrom the Front Range, well in the south of the park, a spur of toothed\r\ngranite peaks springs two miles eastward to the monarch of the park,\r\nLongs Peak. It is this position in advance of the range, as much as the\r\nadvantage of its 14,255 feet of altitude, which enables this famous\r\nmountain to become the climax of every east-side view.\r\n\r\nLongs Peak has a remarkable personality. It is an architectural\r\ncreation, a solid granite temple, strongly buttressed upon four sides.\r\nFrom every point of view it is profoundly different, but always\r\nconsistent and recognizable. Seen from the east, it is supported on\r\neither side by mountains of majesty. Joined with it on the north, Mount\r\nLady Washington rises 13,269 feet, the cleft between their summits being\r\nthe way of the trail to Longs Peak summit. Merging with it in mass upon\r\nthe south, Mount Meeker rises 13,911 feet. Once the three were one\r\nmonster mountain. Frosts and rains carried off the crust strata, bared\r\nthe granite core, and chipped it into three summits, while a glacier of\r\nlarge size gouged out of its middle the abyss which divides the\r\nmountains, and carved the precipice, which drops twenty-four hundred\r\nfeet from Longs Peak summit to Chasm Lake. The Chasm, which is easily\r\nreached by trail from the hotels at the mountain's foot, is one of the\r\nwildest places in America. It may be explored in a day.\r\n\r\nMountain climbing is becoming the fashion in Rocky Mountain National\r\nPark among those who never climbed before, and it will not be many years\r\nbefore its inmost recesses are penetrated by innumerable trampers and\r\ncampers. The \"stunt\" of the park is the ascent of Longs Peak. This is no\r\nparticular matter for the experienced, for the trail is well worn, and\r\nthe ascent may be made on horseback to the boulder field, less than two\r\nthousand feet from the summit; but to the inexperienced it appears an\r\nundertaking of first magnitude. From the boulder field the trail carries\r\nout upon a long sharp slant which drops into the precipice of Glacier\r\nGorge, and ascends the box-like summit cap by a shelf trail which\r\nsometimes has terrors for the unaccustomed. Several hundred persons make\r\nthe ascent each summer without accident, including many women and a few\r\nchildren. The one risk is that accidental snow obscure the trail; but\r\nLongs Peak is not often ascended without a guide.\r\n\r\nThe view from the summit of the entire national park, of the splendid\r\nrange south which should be in the park but is not, of the foothills and\r\npond-spotted plains in the east, of Denver and her mountain background,\r\nand of the Medicine Bow and other ranges west of the park, is one of the\r\ncountry's great spectacles. Longs Peak is sometimes climbed at night for\r\nthe sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe six miles of range between Longs Peak and the southern boundary of\r\nthe park show five towering snow-spotted mountains of noble beauty,\r\nMount Alice, Tanima Peak, Mahana Peak, Ouzel Peak, and Mount Copeland.\r\nTributary to the Wild Basin, which corresponds, south of Longs Peak, to\r\nthe Wild Gardens north of it, are gorges of loveliness the waters of\r\nwhose exquisite lakes swell St. Vrain Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Basin is one of Rocky Mountain's lands of the future. The\r\nentire west side is another, for, except for the lively settlement at\r\nGrand Lake, its peaks and canyons, meadows, lakes, and valleys are\r\nseldom visited. It is natural that the east side, with its broader\r\nplateaus and showier range, should have the first development, but no\r\naccessible country of the splendid beauty of the west side can long\r\nremain neglected. Its unique feature is the broad and beautiful valley\r\nof the North Fork of the Grand River, here starting for its great\r\nadventure in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Wiswall Brothers_\r\n\r\nSUMMIT OF LONGS PEAK, ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hundred feet from water to peak, a mighty chasm carved by an\r\nancient glacier]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Rockies are a masterpiece of erosion. When forces below the surface\r\nbegan to push them high in air, their granite cores were covered\r\nthousands of feet deep with the sediments of the great sea of whose\r\nbottom once they were a part. The higher they rose the more insistently\r\nfrosts and rains concentrated upon their uplifting summits; in time all\r\nsedimentary rocks were washed away, and the granite beneath exposed.\r\n\r\nThen the frosts and rains, and later the glaciers, attacked the granite,\r\nand carved it into the jagged forms of to-day. The glaciers moulded the\r\ngorges which the streams had cut. The glaciers have passed, but still\r\nthe work goes on. Slowly the mountains rise, and slowly, but not so\r\nslowly, the frosts chisel and the rains carry away. If conditions remain\r\nas now, history will again repeat itself, and the gorgeous peaks of\r\nto-day will decline, a million years or more from now, into the low\r\nrounded summits of our eastern Appalachians, and later into the flat,\r\nsoil-hidden granites of Canada.\r\n\r\nThese processes may be seen in practical example. Ascend the precipitous\r\neast side by the Flattop Trail, for instance, and notice particularly\r\nthe broad, rolling level of the continental divide. For many miles it\r\nis nothing but a lofty, bare, undulating plain, interspersed with\r\nsummits, but easy to travel except for its accumulation of immense loose\r\nboulders. This plain slopes gently toward the west, and presently\r\nbreaks, as on the east, into cliffs and canyons. It is a stage in the\r\nreduction by erosion of mountains which, except for erosion, might have\r\nrisen many thousands of feet higher. Geologists call it a peneplain,\r\nwhich means nearly-a-plain; it is from fragmentary remains of peneplains\r\nthat they trace ranges long ages washed away. History may, in some dim\r\nfuture age, repeat still another wonder, for upon the flattened wreck of\r\nthe Front Range may rise, by some earth movement, a new and even nobler\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nBut what about the precipitous eastern front?\r\n\r\nThat masterpiece was begun by water, accomplished by ice, and finished\r\nby water. In the beginning, streams determined the direction of the\r\nvalleys and carved these valleys deep. Then came, in very recent times,\r\nas geologists measure earth's history, the Great Ice Age. As a result of\r\nfalling temperature, the mountains became covered, except their higher\r\nsummits and the continental divide, with glaciers. These came in at\r\nleast two invasions, and remained many hundreds of thousands of years.\r\nWhen changing climate melted them away, the Rocky Mountain National Park\r\nremained not greatly different from what it is to-day. Frosts and rains\r\nhave softened and beautified it since.\r\n\r\nThese glaciers, first forming in the beds of streams by the\r\naccumulations of snow which presently turned to ice and moved slowly\r\ndown the valleys, began at once to pluck out blocks of granite from\r\ntheir starting-points, and settle themselves in cirques. They plucked\r\ndownward and backward, undermining their cirque walls until falling\r\ngranite left precipices; armed with imprisoned rocks, they gouged and\r\nscraped their beds, and these processes, constantly repeated for\r\nthousands of centuries, produced the mountain forms, the giant gorges,\r\nthe enormous precipices, and the rounded granite valleys of the\r\nstupendous east elevation of the Front Range.\r\n\r\nThere is a good illustration in Iceberg Lake, near the base of Trail\r\nRidge on the Ute Trail. This precipitous well, which every visitor to\r\nRocky Mountain should see, originally was an ice-filled hollow in the\r\nhigh surface of the ridge. When the Fall River Glacier moved eastward,\r\nthe ice in the hollow slipped down to join it, and by that very motion\r\nbecame itself a glacier. Downward and backward plucking in the cirque\r\nwhich it presently made, and the falling of the undermined walls,\r\nproduced in, say, a few hundred thousand years this striking well, upon\r\nwhose lake's surface visitors of to-day will find cakes of floating ice,\r\nbroken from the sloping snow-field which is the old glacier's remainder\r\nand representative of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers which shaped Rocky Mountain's big canyons had enormous size\r\nand thickness. Ice streams from scores of glacial cirques joined\r\nfan-like to form the Wild Basin Glacier, which swept out through the\r\nnarrow valley of St. Vrain. Four glaciers headed at Longs Peak, one west\r\nof Mount Meeker, which gave into the Wild Basin; one west of Longs Peak,\r\nwhich joined the combination of glaciers that hollowed Loch Vale; one\r\nupon the north, which moulded Glacier Gorge; and the small but powerful\r\nglacier which hollowed the great Chasm on the east front of Longs Peak.\r\nThe Loch Vale and Glacier Gorge glaciers joined with giant ice streams\r\nas far north as Tyndall Gorge to form the Bartholf Glacier; and north of\r\nthat the mighty Thompson Glacier drained the divide to the head of\r\nForest Canyon, while the Fall River Glacier drained the Mummy Range\r\nsouth of Hagues Peak.\r\n\r\nThese undoubtedly were the main glacial streams of those ancient days,\r\nthe agencies responsible for the gorgeous spectacle we now enjoy. The\r\ngreater glaciers reached a thickness of two thousand feet; they have\r\nleft records scratched high upon the granite walls.\r\n\r\nAs the glaciers moved down their valleys they carried, imprisoned in\r\ntheir bodies and heaped upon their backs and sides, the plunder from\r\ntheir wreckage of the range. This they heaped as large moraines in the\r\nbroad valleys. The moraines of the Rocky Mountain National Park are\r\nunequalled, in my observation, for number, size, and story-telling\r\nability. They are conspicuous features of the great plateau upon the\r\neast, and of the broad valley of the Grand River west of the park. Even\r\nthe casual visitor of a day is stirred to curiosity by the straight,\r\nhigh wall of the great moraine for which Moraine Park is named, and by\r\nthe high curved hill which springs from the northeastern shoulder of\r\nLongs Peak, and encircles the eastern foot of Mount Meeker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Willis T. Lee_\r\n\r\nTHE ANDREWS GLACIER HANGS FROM THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE\r\n\r\nA glacier in the Rocky Mountain National Park which can be studied by\r\nvisitors]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by H.T. Cowling_\r\n\r\nA ROCKY MOUNTAIN CIRQUE CARVED FROM SOLID GRANITE\r\n\r\nIceberg Lake was cut eighteen hundred feet deep by an ancient glacier]\r\n\r\nThese and other moraines are fascinating features of any visit to Rocky\r\nMountain National Park. The motor roads disclose them, the trails travel\r\nthem. In combination with the gulfs, the shelved canyons and the scarred\r\nand serrated peaks and walls, these moraines offer the visitor a\r\nthrilling mystery story of the past, the unravelling of whose threads\r\nand the reconstruction of whose plot and climax will add zest and\r\ninterest to a summer's outing, and bring him, incidentally, in close\r\ncommunion with nature in a thousand happy moods.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe limitations of a chapter permit no mention of the gigantic\r\nprehistoric monsters of land, sea, and air which once haunted the site\r\nof this noble park, nor description of its more intimate beauties, nor\r\ndetail of its mountaineering joys; for all of which and much other\r\ninvaluable information I refer those interested to publications of the\r\nNational Park Service, Department of the Interior, by Doctor Willis T.\r\nLee and Major Roger W. Toll. But something must be told of its early\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the exploring expedition which President Madison sent west under\r\nColonel S.H. Long, while camping at the mouth of La Poudre River, was\r\ngreatly impressed by the magnificence of a lofty, square-topped\r\nmountain. They approached it no nearer, but named it Longs Peak, in\r\nhonor of their leader. Parkman records seeing it in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers, of course, knew the country. Deer, elk, and sheep were\r\nprobably hunted there in the forties and fifties. Joel Estes, the first\r\nsettler, built a cabin in the foothills in 1860, hence the title of\r\nEstes Park. James Nugent, afterward widely celebrated as \"Rocky Mountain\r\nJim,\" arrived in 1868. Others followed slowly.\r\n\r\nWilliam N. Byers, founder of the _Rocky Mountain News_, made the first\r\nattempt to climb Longs Peak in 1864. He did not succeed then, but four\r\nyears later, with a party which included Major J.W. Powell, who made the\r\nfirst exploration of the Grand Canyon the following year, he made the\r\nsummit. In 1871 the Reverend E.J. Lamb, the first regular guide on Longs\r\nPeak, made the first descent by the east precipice, a dangerous feat.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Dunraven visited Estes Park in 1871, attracted by the big\r\ngame hunting, and bought land. He projected an immense preserve, and\r\ninduced men to file claims which he planned to acquire after they had\r\nsecured possession; but the claims were disallowed. Albert Bierstadt\r\nvisited Dunraven in 1874, and painted canvases which are famous in\r\nAmerican art.\r\n\r\nIt was Dunraven, also, who built the first hotel. Tourists began to\r\narrive in 1865. In 1874 the first stage line was established, coming in\r\nfrom Longmont. Telephone connection was made in 1906.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Estes Park, the region prospered. Fifty thousand\r\npeople were estimated to have visited it in 1914. It was not, however,\r\ntill the national park was created, in 1915, that the mountains assumed\r\nconsiderable importance except as an agreeable and inspiring background\r\nto the broad plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMcKINLEY, GIANT OF GIANTS\r\n\r\nMOUNT MCKINLEY NATIONAL PARK, ALASKA. AREA, ABOUT 2,200 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monster mountain of this continent, \"the majestic, snow-crowned\r\nAmerican monarch,\" as General Greeley called it, was made a national\r\npark in 1917. Mount McKinley rises 20,300 feet above tide-water, and\r\n17,000 feet above the eyes of the beholder standing on the plateau at\r\nits base. Scenically, it is the highest mountain in the world, for those\r\nsummits of the Andes and Himalayas which are loftier as measured from\r\nsea level, can be viewed closely only from valleys whose altitudes range\r\nfrom 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Its enormous bulk is shrouded in perpetual\r\nsnow two-thirds down from its summit, and the foothills and broad plains\r\nupon its north and west are populated with mountain sheep and caribou in\r\nunprecedented numbers.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate Mount McKinley's place among national parks, one must know\r\nwhat it means in the anatomy of the continent. The western margin of\r\nNorth America is bordered by a broad mountainous belt known as the\r\nPacific System, which extends from Mexico northwesterly into and through\r\nAlaska, to the very end of the Aleutian Islands, and includes such\r\ncelebrated ranges as the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade, and the St. Elias.\r\nIn Alaska, at the head of Cook Inlet, it swings a sharp curve to the\r\nsouthwest and becomes Alaska's mountain axis. This sharp curve, for all\r\nthe world like a monstrous granite hinge connecting the northwesterly\r\nand southwesterly limbs of the System, is the gigantic Alaska Range,\r\nwhich is higher and broader than the Sierra Nevada, and of greater\r\nrelief and extent than the Alps. Near the centre of this range, its\r\nclimax in position, height, bulk, and majesty, stands Mount McKinley.\r\nIts glistening peak can be seen on clear days in most directions for two\r\nhundred miles.\r\n\r\nFor many years Mount St. Elias, with its eighteen thousand feet of\r\naltitude, was considered North America's loftiest summit. That was\r\nbecause it stands in that part of Alaska which was first developed. The\r\nKlondike region, far northward, was well on the way to development\r\nbefore McKinley became officially recognized as the mountain climax of\r\nthe continent. But that does not mean that it remained unknown. The\r\nnatives of the Cook Inlet country on the east knew it as Doleika, and\r\ntell you that it is the rock which a god threw at his eloping wife. They\r\nsay it was once a volcano, which is not the fact. The Aleutes on the\r\nsouth called it Traleika, the big mountain. The natives of the Kuskokwim\r\ncountry on the west knew it as Denalai, the god, father of the great\r\nrange. The Russians who established the first permanent white settlement\r\nin Alaska on Kodiak Island knew it as Bulshia Gora, the great mountain.\r\nCaptain Cook, who in 1778 explored the inlet which since has borne his\r\nname, does not mention it, but Vancouver in 1794 unquestionably meant it\r\nin his reference to \"distant stupendous mountains.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the United States acquired Alaska, in 1867, there is little\r\nmention of it for some years. But Frank Densmore, an explorer of 1889,\r\nentered the Kuskokwim region, and took such glowing accounts of its\r\nmagnificence back to the Yukon that for years it was known through the\r\nsettlements as Densmore's Mountain. In 1885 Lieutenant Henry C. Allen,\r\nU.S.A., made a sketch of the range from his skin boat on the Tanana\r\nRiver, a hundred and fifty miles away, which is the earliest known\r\npicture of McKinley.\r\n\r\nMeantime the neighborhood was invaded by prospectors from both sides.\r\nThe Cook Inlet gold fields were exploited in 1894. Two years later W.A.\r\nDickey and his partner, Monks, two young Princeton graduates, exploring\r\nnorth from their workings, recognized the mountain's commanding\r\nproportions and named it Mount McKinley, by which it rapidly became\r\nknown, and was entered on the early maps. With crude instruments\r\nimprovised on the spot, Dickey estimated the mountain's height as twenty\r\nthousand feet--a real achievement. When Belmore Browne, who climbed the\r\ngreat peak in 1912, asked Dickey why he chose the name, Dickey told him\r\nthat he was so disgusted with the free-silver arguments of men\r\ntravelling with him that he named the mountain after the most ardent\r\ngold-standard man he knew.\r\n\r\nThe War Department sent several parties to the region during the next\r\nfew years to explore, and the United States Geological Survey, beginning\r\nin 1898 with the Eldridge-Muldrow party, has had topographical and\r\ngeological parties in the region almost continuously since. In 1915 the\r\nGovernment began the railroad from Seward to Fairbanks. Its course lies\r\nfrom Cook Inlet up the Susitna River to the headwaters of the Nenana\r\nRiver, where it crosses the range. This will make access to the region\r\neasy and comfortable. It was to safeguard the enormous game herds from\r\nthe hordes of hunters which the railroad was expected to bring rather\r\nthan to conserve an alpine region scenically unequalled that Congress\r\nset aside twenty-two hundred square miles under the name of the Mount\r\nMcKinley National Park.\r\n\r\nFrom the white sides of McKinley and his giant neighbors descend\r\nglaciers of enormous bulk and great length. Their waters drain on the\r\neast and south, through the Susitna River and its tributaries, into the\r\nPacific; and on the north and west, through tributaries of the Yukon and\r\nKuskokwim, into Bering Sea.\r\n\r\nThe south side of McKinley is forbidding in the extreme, but its north\r\nand west fronts pass abruptly into a plateau of gravels, sands, and\r\nsilts twenty-five hundred to three thousand feet in altitude, whose\r\ngentle valleys lead the traveller up to the very sides of the granite\r\nmonster, and whose mosses and grasses pasture the caribou.\r\n\r\nThe national park boundaries enclose immense areas of this plateau. The\r\ncontours of its rounded rolling elevations mark the courses of\r\ninnumerable streams, and occasionally abut upon great sweeping glaciers.\r\nLow as it is, the plateau is generally above timber-line. The day will\r\ncome when roads will wind through its valleys, and hotels and camps will\r\nnestle in its sheltered hollows; while the great herds of caribou, more\r\nthan one of which has been estimated at fifteen hundred animals, will\r\npasture like sheep within close range of the camera. For the wild\r\nanimals of McKinley National Park, having never been hunted, were\r\nfearless of the explorers, and now will never learn to fear man. The\r\nsame is true in lesser measure of the more timid mountain sheep which\r\nfrequent the foothills in numbers not known elsewhere. Charles Sheldon\r\ncounted more than five hundred in one ordinary day's foot journey\r\nthrough the valleys.\r\n\r\nThe magic of summer life on this sunlit plateau, with its limitless\r\ndistances, its rushing streams, its enormous crawling glaciers, its\r\nwaving grasses, its sweeping gentle valleys, its myriad friendly\r\nanimals, and, back of all and commanding all, its never-forgotten and\r\never-controlling presence, the shining Range and Master Mountain,\r\npowerfully grip imagination and memory. One never can look long away\r\nfrom the mountain, whose delicate rose tint differentiates it from other\r\ngreat mountains. Here is ever present an intimate sense of the infinite,\r\nwhich is reminiscent of that pang which sometimes one may get by gazing\r\nlong into the starry zenith. From many points of view McKinley looks\r\nits giant size. As the climber ascends the basal ridges there are places\r\nwhere its height and bulk appall.\r\n\r\nAlong the northern edge of the park lies the Kantishna mining district.\r\nIn 1906 there was a wild stampede to this region. Diamond City, Bearpaw\r\nCity, Glacier City, McKinley City, Roosevelt, and other rude mining\r\nsettlements came into rapid existence. Results did not adequately reward\r\nthe thousands who flocked to the new field, and the \"cities\" were\r\nabandoned. A hundred or two miners remain, scattered thinly over a large\r\narea, which is forested here and there with scrubby growths, and, in\r\nlocalities, is remarkably productive of cultivated fruits and\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nFew know and few will know Mount McKinley. It is too monstrous for any\r\nbut the hardiest to discover its ice-protected secrets. The South Peak,\r\nwhich is the summit, has been climbed twice, once by the Parker-Browne\r\nparty in 1912, after two previous unsuccessful expeditions, and once,\r\nthe year following, by the party of Archdeacon Hudson Stuck, who\r\ngratified an ambition which had arisen out of his many years of\r\nstrenuous missionary work among the Alaskan Indians. From the records of\r\nthese two parties we gather nearly all that is known of the mountain.\r\nThe North Peak, which is several hundred feet lower, was climbed by\r\nAnderson and Taylor of the Tom Lloyd party, in 1913.\r\n\r\nFrom each of these peaks an enormous buttressing ridge sweeps northward\r\nuntil it merges into the foothills and the great plain. These ridges\r\nare roughly parallel, and carry between them the Denali Glacier, to\r\nadopt Belmore Browne's suggested name, and its forks and tributaries. Up\r\nthis glacier is the difficult passage to the summit. Tremendous as it\r\nis, the greatest perhaps of the north side, the Denali Glacier by no\r\nmeans compares with the giants which flow from the southern front.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 Judge James Wickersham, afterward Delegate to Congress from\r\nAlaska, made the first attempt to climb McKinley; it failed through his\r\nunderestimation of the extensive equipment necessary. In 1906 Doctor\r\nFrederick A. Cook, who meantime also had made an unsuccessful attempt\r\nfrom the north side, led an expedition from the south which included\r\nProfessor Herschel Parker of Columbia University, and Mr. Belmore\r\nBrowne, artist, explorer, and big game hunter. Ascending the Yentna\r\nRiver, it reached a point upon the Tokositna Glacier beyond which\r\nprogress was impossible, and returned to Cook Inlet and disbanded.\r\nParker returned to New York, and Cook proposed that Browne should lay in\r\na needed supply of game while he, with a packer named Barrill, should\r\nmake what he described as a rapid reconnaissance preparatory to a\r\nfurther attempt upon the summit the following year. Browne wanted to\r\naccompany him, but was overpersuaded. Cook and Barrill then ascended the\r\nSusitna, struck into the country due south of McKinley, and returned to\r\nTyonik with the announcement that they had reached the summit. Cook\r\nexhibited a photograph of Barrill standing upon a crag, which he said\r\nwas the summit. A long and painful controversy followed upon Cook's\r\nreturn east with this claim.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the object of the Parker-Browne expedition of 1910\r\nwas as much to follow Cook's course and check his claim as to reach the\r\nsummit. The first object was attained, and Herman L. Tucker, a national\r\nforester, was photographed standing on the identical crag upon which\r\nCook had photographed Barrill four years before. This crag was found\r\nmiles south of McKinley, with other peaks higher than its own\r\nintervening. From here the party advanced up a glacier of enormous size\r\nto the very foot of the upper reaches of the mountain's south side, but\r\nwas stopped by gigantic snow walls, which defeated every attempt to\r\ncross. \"At the slightest touch of the sun,\" writes Browne, \"the great\r\ncliffs literally _smoke_ with avalanches.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parker-Browne expedition undertaken in 1912 for purposes of\r\nexploration, also approached from the south, but, following the Susitna\r\nRiver farther up, crossed the Alaska Range with dog trains to the north\r\nside at a hitherto unexplored point. Just before crossing the divide it\r\nentered what five years later became the Mount McKinley National Park,\r\nand, against an April blizzard, descended into a land of many gorgeous\r\nglaciers. \"We were now,\" writes Belmore Browne, \"in a wilderness\r\nparadise. The mountains had a wild, picturesque look, due to their bare\r\nrock summits, and big game was abundant. We were wild with enthusiasm\r\nover the beauty of it all, and every few minutes as we jogged along some\r\none would gaze fondly at the surrounding mountains and ejaculate: 'This\r\nis sure a white man's country.'\"\r\n\r\nOf these \"happy hunting grounds,\" as Browne chapters the park country in\r\nhis book, Stephen R. Capps of the United States Geological Survey says\r\nin his report:\r\n\r\n\"Probably no part of America is so well supplied with wild game,\r\nunprotected by reserves, as the area on the north slope of the Alaska\r\nRange, west of the Nanana River. This region has been so little visited\r\nby white men that the game herds have, until recent years, been little\r\nmolested by hunters. The white mountain sheep are particularly abundant\r\nin the main Alaska Range, and in the more rugged foothills. Caribou are\r\nplentiful throughout the entire area, and were seen in bands numbering\r\nmany hundred individuals. Moose are numerous in the lowlands, and range\r\nover all the area in which timber occurs. Black bears may be seen in or\r\nnear timbered lands, and grizzly bears range from the rugged mountains\r\nto the lowlands. Rabbits and ptarmigan are at times remarkably\r\nnumerous.\"\r\n\r\nParker and Browne camped along the Muldrow Glacier, now a magnificent\r\ncentral feature of the park. Then they made for McKinley summit.\r\nStriking the Denali Glacier, they ascended it with a dog train to an\r\naltitude of eleven thousand feet, where they made a base camp and went\r\non afoot, packing provisions and camp outfit on their backs. At one\r\nplace they ascended an incoming glacier over ice cascades, four thousand\r\nfeet high. From their last camp they cut steps in the ice for more than\r\nthree thousand feet of final ascent, and attained the top on July 1 in\r\nthe face of a blizzard. On the northeastern end of the level summit, and\r\nonly five minutes' walk from the little hillock which forms the supreme\r\nsummit, the blizzard completely blinded them. It was impossible to go\r\non, and to wait meant rapid death by freezing; with extreme difficulty\r\nthey returned to their camp. Two days later they made a second attempt,\r\nbut were again enveloped in an ice storm that rendered progress\r\nimpossible. Exhaustion of supplies forbade another try, and saved their\r\nlives, for a few days later a violent earthquake shook McKinley to its\r\nsummit. Later on Mr. Browne identified this earthquake as concurrent\r\nwith the terrific explosive eruption which blew off the top of Mount\r\nKatmai, on the south coast of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe following spring the Stuck-Karstens party made the summit upon that\r\nrarest of occasions with Mount McKinley, a perfect day. Archdeacon Stuck\r\ndescribes the \"actual summit\" as \"a little crater-like snow basin, sixty\r\nor sixty-five feet long, and twenty to twenty-five feet wide, with a\r\nhay-cock of snow at either end--the south one a little higher than the\r\nnorth.\" Ignoring official and recognized nomenclature, and calling\r\nMcKinley and Foraker by their Kuskokwim Indian names, he writes of Mount\r\nForaker: \"Denali's Wife does not appear at all save from the actual\r\nsummit of Denali, for she is completely hidden by his South Peak, until\r\nthe moment when his South Peak is surmounted. And never was nobler sight\r\ndisplayed to man than that great isolated mountain spread out\r\ncompletely, with all its spurs and ridges, its cliffs and its glaciers,\r\nlofty and mighty, and yet far beneath us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Above us,\" he writes a few pages later, \"the sky took on a blue so deep\r\nthat none of us had ever gazed upon a midday sky like it before. It was\r\ndeep, rich, lustrous, transparent blue, as dark as Prussian blue, but\r\nintensely blue; a hue so strange, so increasingly impressive, that to\r\none at least it 'seemed like special news of God,' as a new poet sings.\r\nWe first noticed the darkening tint of the upper sky in the Grand Basin,\r\nand it deepened as we rose. Tyndall observed and discussed this\r\nphenomenon in the Alps, but it seems scarcely to have been mentioned\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of months before the Parker-Browne party started for the top,\r\nthere was an ascent of the lower North Peak which, for sheer daring and\r\nendurance must rank high in the history of adventure. Four prospectors\r\nand miners from the Kantishna region organized by Tom Lloyd, took\r\nadvantage of the hard ice of May, and an idle dog team, to make for the\r\nsummit. Their motive seems to have been little more than to plant a pole\r\nwhere it could be seen by telescope, as they thought, from Fairbanks;\r\nthat was why they chose the North Peak. They used no ropes, alpenstocks,\r\nor scientific equipment of any sort, and carried only one camera, the\r\nchance possession of McGonagall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by G.B. Gordon_\r\n\r\nMOUNT McKINLEY, LOOMING ABOVE THE GREAT ALASKAN RANGE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by LaVoy_\r\n\r\nARCHDEACON STUCK'S PARTY HALF-WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT McKINLEY]\r\n\r\nThey made their last camp at an altitude of eleven thousand feet. Here\r\nLloyd remained, while Anderson, Taylor, and McGonagall attempted the\r\nsummit in one day's supreme effort. Near the top McGonagall was overcome\r\nby mountain sickness. Anderson and Taylor went on and planted their pole\r\nnear the North summit, where the Stuck-Karstens party saw it a year\r\nlater in their ascent of the South Peak.\r\n\r\nSo extraordinary a feat of strength and endurance will hardly be\r\naccomplished again unless, perhaps, by hardy miners of the arctic\r\nwilderness. \"The North Pole's nothing to fellows like us,\" one of them\r\nsaid later on; \"once strike gold there, and we'll build a town on it in\r\na month.\"\r\n\r\nThe published records of the Parker-Browne and Stuck-Karstens\r\nexpeditions emphasize the laborious nature of the climbing. The very\r\nisolation which gives McKinley its spectacular elevation multiplies the\r\ndifficulties of ascent by lowering the snow line thousands of feet below\r\nthe snow line of the Himalayas and Andes with their loftier surrounding\r\nvalleys. Travel on the glaciers was trying in the extreme, for much of\r\nthe way had to be sounded for hidden crevasses, and, after the selection\r\nof each new camping place, the extensive outfit must be returned for and\r\nsledded or carried up. Frequent barriers, often of great height, had to\r\nbe surmounted by tortuous and exhausting detours over icy cliffs and\r\nsoft snow. And always special care must be taken against avalanches;\r\nthe roar of avalanches for much of the latter journey was almost\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nToward the end, the thermometer was rarely above zero, and at night far\r\nbelow; but the heat and glare of the sun was stifling and blinding\r\nduring much of the day; often they perspired profusely under their\r\ncrushing burdens, with the thermometer nearly at zero. Snow fell daily,\r\nand often several times a day.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that no other of the world's mountain giants presents\r\nclimbing conditions so strenuous. Farming is successfully carried on in\r\nthe Himalayas far above McKinley's level of perpetual snow, and Tucker\r\nreports having climbed a twenty-thousand-foot peak in the Andes with\r\nless exertion than it cost the Parker-Browne party, of which he had been\r\na member, to mount the first forty-five hundred feet of McKinley.\r\n\r\nWhile McKinley will be climbed again and again in the future, the feat\r\nwill scarcely be one of the popular amusements of the national park.\r\n\r\nYet Mount McKinley is the northern landmark of an immense unexplored\r\nmountain region south of the national park, which very far surpasses the\r\nAlps in every feature that has made the Alps world-famous. Of this\r\nregion A.H. Brooks, Chief of the Alaska Division of the United States\r\nGeological Survey, writes:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies a rugged highland area far greater in extent than all of\r\nSwitzerland, a virgin field for explorers and mountaineers. He who would\r\nmaster unattained summits, explore unknown rivers, or traverse\r\nuntrodden glaciers in a region whose scenic beauties are hardly\r\nequalled, has not to seek them in South America or Central Asia, for\r\ngenerations will pass before the possibilities of the Alaskan Range are\r\nexhausted. But this is not Switzerland, with its hotels, railways,\r\ntrained guides, and well-worn paths. It will appeal only to him who\r\nprefers to strike out for himself, who can break his own trail through\r\ntrackless wilds, can throw the diamond hitch, and will take the chances\r\nof life and limb so dear to the heart of the true explorer.\"\r\n\r\nThe hotels will come in time to the Mount McKinley National Park, and\r\nperhaps they will come also to the Alaskan Alps. Perhaps it is not\r\nstraining the credulity of an age like ours to suggest that McKinley's\r\ncommanding summit may be attained some day by aeroplane, with many of\r\nthe joys and none of the distressing hardships endured by the weary\r\nclimber. When this time comes, if it does come, there will be added\r\nmerely another extraordinary experience to the very many unique and\r\npleasurable experiences of a visit to the Mount McKinley National Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE AND THE EAST\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE NATIONAL PARK, MAINE. AREA, 10,000 ACRES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of Congress to create national parks only from\r\npublic lands, the title to which costs nothing to acquire. It may be\r\nmany years before the nation awakes to the fact that areas distinguished\r\nfor supreme scenery, historical association, or extraordinary scientific\r\nsignificance are worth conserving even if conservation involves their\r\npurchase. The answer to the oft-asked question why the national parks\r\nare all in the west is that the east passed into private possession\r\nbefore the national park idea assumed importance in the national\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the two national parks east of the Rocky Mountains\r\nmerely emphasizes the fact. The Hot Springs of Arkansas were set apart\r\nin 1832 while the Ozark Mountains were still a wilderness. The Lafayette\r\nNational Park, in Maine, is made up of many small parcels of privately\r\nowned land which a group of public-spirited citizens, because of the\r\nimpossibility of securing national appropriations, patiently acquired\r\nduring a series of laborious years, and presented, in 1916, to the\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile refusing to purchase land for national parks, Congress\r\nnevertheless is buying large areas of eastern mountain land for\r\nnational forest, the purpose being not only to conserve water sources,\r\nwhich national parks would accomplish quite as thoroughly, but\r\nparticularly to control lumbering operations in accord with principles\r\nwhich will insure the lumber supply of the future. Here and there in\r\nthis reserve are limited areas of distinguished national park quality,\r\nbut whether they will be set aside as national parks is a question for\r\nthe people and the future to decide. Certainly the mountain topography\r\nand the rich deciduous forests of the eastern United States should be\r\nrepresented in the national parks system by several fine examples.\r\n\r\nThe Lafayette National Park differs from all other members of the\r\nnational parks system in several important respects. It is in the far\r\neast; it combines seashore and mountain; it is clothed with a rich and\r\nvaried growth of deciduous trees and eastern conifers; it is intimately\r\nassociated with the very early history of America. Besides which, it is\r\na region of noble beauty, subtle charm and fascinating variety.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian Mountain uplift, which, roughly speaking, embraces all\r\nthe ranges constituting the eastern rib of the continent, may be\r\nconsidered to include also the very ancient peneplains of New England.\r\nThese tumbled hills and shallow valleys, accented here and there by\r\nranges and monadnocks, by which the geologist means solitary peaks, are\r\nall that the frosts and rains of very many millions of years and the\r\nglaciers of more recent geologic times have left of what once must have\r\nbeen a towering mountain region crested in snow. The wrinkling of the\r\nearth's surface which produced this range occurred during the Devonian\r\nperiod when fishes were the predominant inhabitants of the earth, many\r\nmillions of years before birds or even reptiles appeared. Its rise was\r\naccompanied by volcanic disturbances, whose evidences are abundant on\r\nislands between the mouth of the Penobscot and Mount Desert Island,\r\nthough not within the park. The mind cannot conceive the lapse of time\r\nwhich has reduced this range, at an erosional speed no greater than\r\nto-day's, to its present level. During this process the coast line was\r\nalso slowly sinking, changing valleys into estuaries and land-encircled\r\nbays. The coast of Maine is an eloquent chapter in the continent's\r\nancient history, and the Lafayette National Park is one of the most\r\ndramatic paragraphs in the chapter.\r\n\r\nWhere the Penobscot River reaches the sea, and for forty miles east, the\r\nsinking continental shore has deeply indented the coast line with a\r\nnetwork of broad, twisting bays, enclosing many islands. The largest and\r\nfinest of these is Mount Desert Island, for many years celebrated for\r\nits romantic beauty. Upon its northeast shore, facing Frenchman's Bay,\r\nis the resort town of Bar Harbor; other resorts dot its shores on every\r\nside. The island has a large summer population drawn from all parts of\r\nthe country. Besides its hotels, there are many fine summer homes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN LAFAYETTE NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nEcho Lake in the foreground, Sommes Harbor beyond Acadia]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA CAVES IN THE GRANITE\r\n\r\nThus does the ocean everlastingly undermine the foundations of the\r\nmountains. Photograph taken at low tide; Lafayette National Park]\r\n\r\nThe feature which especially distinguishes Mount Desert Island from\r\nother islands, in fact from the entire Atlantic coast, is a group of\r\ngranitic mountains which rise abruptly from the sea. They were once\r\ntowering monsters, perhaps only one, unquestionably the loftiest for\r\nmany miles around. They are the sole remainders upon the present coast\r\nline of a great former range. They are composed almost wholly of\r\ngranite, worn down by the ages, but massive enough still to resist the\r\nagencies which wiped away their comrades. They rise a thousand feet or\r\nmore, grim, rounded, cleft with winding valleys and deep passes, divided\r\nin places by estuaries of the sea, holding in their hollows many\r\ncharming lakes.\r\n\r\nTheir abrupt flanks gnawed by the beating sea, their valleys grown with\r\nsplendid forests and brightened by wild flowers, their slopes and domes\r\nsprinkled with conifers which struggle for foothold in the cracks which\r\nthe elements are widening and deepening in their granite surface, for\r\nyears they have been the resort of thousands of climbers, students of\r\nnature and seekers of the beautiful; the views of sea, estuary, island,\r\nplain, lake, and mountain from the heights have no counterpart\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAll this mountain wilderness, free as it was to the public, was in\r\nprivate ownership. Some of it was held by persons who had not seen it\r\nfor years. Some of it was locked up in estates. The time came when\r\nowners began to plan fine summer homes high on the mountain slopes. A\r\nfew, however, believed that the region should belong to the whole\r\npeople, and out of this belief grew the movement, led by George B. Dorr\r\nand Charles W. Eliot, to acquire title and present it to the nation\r\nwhich would not buy it. They organized a holding association, to which\r\nthey gave their own properties; for years afterward Mr. Dorr devoted\r\nmost of his time to persuading others to contribute their holdings, and\r\nto raising subscriptions for the purchase of plots which were tied up in\r\nestates. In 1916 the association presented five thousand acres to the\r\nGovernment, and President Wilson created it by proclamation the Sieur de\r\nMonts National Monument. The gift has been greatly increased since. In\r\n1918 Congress made appropriations for its upkeep and development. In\r\nFebruary, 1919, Congress changed its name and status; it then became the\r\nLafayette National Park.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to name the new national park after the French general who\r\ncame to our aid in time of need arose, of course, out of the war-time\r\nwarmth of feeling for our ally, France. The region had been identified\r\nwith early French exploration; the original monument had been named in\r\ncommemoration of this historical association. The first European\r\nsettlement in America north of the latitude of the Gulf of Mexico was\r\nhere. Henry of Navarre had sent two famous adventurers to the new world,\r\nde Monts and Champlain. The first colony established by de Monts was at\r\nthe mouth of the St. Croix River, which forms the eastern boundary of\r\nMaine, and the first land within the present United States which was\r\nreached by Champlain was Mount Desert Island. This was in 1604. It was\r\nChamplain who gave the island its present name, after the mountains\r\nwhich rise so prominently from its rock-bound shore. To him, however,\r\nthe name had a different significance than it first suggests to us.\r\nL'Isle des Monts Deserts meant to him the Island of the Lonely\r\nMountains, and lonely indeed they must have seemed above the flat shore\r\nline. Thus named, the place became a landmark for future voyagers; among\r\nothers Winthrop records seeing the mountains on his way to the\r\nMassachusetts colony in 1630. He anchored opposite and fished for two\r\nhours, catching \"sixty-seven great cod,\" one of which was \"a yard\r\naround.\"\r\n\r\n\"By a curious train of circumstances,\" writes George B. Dorr, \"the\r\ntitles by which these mountains to the eastward of Somes Sound are held\r\ngo back to the early ownership of Mount Desert Island by the Crown of\r\nFrance. For it was granted by Louis XIV, grandson of Henry IV, to\r\nAntoine de la Mothe Cadillac, an officer of noble family from\r\nsouthwestern France, then serving in Acadia, who afterward became\r\nsuccessively the founder of Detroit and Governor of Louisiana--the\r\nMississippi Valley. Cadillac lost it later, through English occupation\r\nof the region, ownership passing, first to the Province, then to the\r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. But presently the Commonwealth gave back\r\nto his granddaughter--Madame de Gregoire--and her husband, French\r\nrefugees, the Island's eastern half, moved thereto by the part that\r\nFrance had taken in the recent War of Independence and by letters they\r\nhad brought from Lafayette. And they came down and lived there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it naturally followed that, under stress of war enthusiasm, this\r\nreservation with its French associations should commemorate not only the\r\nold Province of Acadia, which the French yielded to England only after\r\nhalf a century of war, and England later on to us after another war, but\r\nthe great war also in which France, England, and the United States all\r\njoined as allies in the cause of the world's freedom. In accord with\r\nthis idea, the highest mountain looking upon the sea has been named the\r\nFlying Squadron, in honor of the service of the air, born of an American\r\ninvention, and carried to perfection by the three allies in common.\r\n\r\nThe park may be entered from any of the surrounding resorts, but the\r\nmain gateway is Bar Harbor, which is reached by train, automobile, and\r\nsteamboat. No resort may be reached more comfortably, and hotel\r\naccommodations are ample.\r\n\r\nThe mountains rise within a mile of the town. They extend westward for\r\ntwelve miles, lying in two groups, separated by a fine salt-water fiord\r\nknown as Somes Sound. The park's boundary is exceedingly irregular, with\r\ndeep indentations of private property. It is enclosed, along the shore,\r\nby an excellent automobile road; roads also cross it on both sides of\r\nSomes Sound.\r\n\r\nThere are ten mountains in the eastern group; the three fronting Bar\r\nHarbor have been renamed, for historic reasons, Cadillac Mountain, the\r\nFlying Squadron, and Champlain Mountain. For the same reason mountains\r\nupon Somes Sound have been renamed Acadia Mountain, St. Sauveur\r\nMountain, and Norumbega Mountain, the last an Indian name; similar\r\nchanges commemorating the early English occupation also have been made\r\nin the nomenclature of the western group. Tablets and memorials are also\r\nprojected in emphasis of the historical associations of the place.\r\n\r\nBoth mountain groups are dotted with lakes; those of the western group\r\nare the largest of the island.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures, then, of the Lafayette National Park cover a wide range\r\nof human desire. Sea bathing, boating, yachting, salt-water and\r\nfresh-water fishing, tramping, exploring the wilderness, hunting the\r\nview spots--these are the summer occupations of many visitors, the\r\ndiversions of many others. The more thoughtful will find its historical\r\nassociations fascinating, its geological record one of the richest in\r\nthe continent, its forests well equipped schools for tree study, their\r\nbranches a museum of bird life.\r\n\r\nTo climb these low mountains, wandering by the hour in their hollows and\r\nupon their sea-horizoned shoulders, is, for one interested in nature, to\r\nget very close indeed to the secrets of her wonderful east. One may\r\nstand upon Cadillac's rounded summit and let imagination realize for him\r\nthe day when this was a glaciered peak in a mighty range which forged\r\nsouthward from the far north, shoulder upon shoulder, peak upon peak,\r\npushing ever higher as it approached the sea, and extending far beyond\r\nthe present ocean horizon; for these mountains of Mount Desert are by no\r\nmeans the terminal of the original mighty range; the slow subsidence of\r\nthe coast has wholly submerged several, perhaps many, that once rose\r\nsouth of them. The valley which now carries the St. Croix River drained\r\nthis once towering range's eastern slopes; the valley of the Penobscot\r\ndrained its western slopes.\r\n\r\nThe rocks beneath his feet disclose not only this vision of the geologic\r\npast; besides that, in their slow decay, in the chiselling of the\r\ntrickling waters, in the cleavage of masses by winter's ice, in the\r\npeeling of the surface by alternate freezing and melting, in the\r\ndissolution and disintegration everywhere by the chemicals imprisoned in\r\nair and water, all of which he sees beneath his feet, they disclose to\r\nhim the processes by which Nature has wrought this splendid ruin. And\r\nif, captivated by this vision, he studies intimately the page of history\r\nwritten in these rocks, he will find it full of fascinating detail.\r\n\r\nThe region also offers an absorbing introduction to the study of our\r\neastern flora. The exposed bogs and headlands support several hundred\r\nspecies of plants typical of the arctic, sub-arctic, and Hudsonian\r\nzones, together with practically all of the common plants of the\r\nCanadian zone, and many of the southern coasts. So with the trees.\r\nEssentially coastal, it is the land of conifers, the southern limit of\r\nsome which are common in the great regions of the north, yet exhibiting\r\nin nearly full variety the species for many miles south; yet it is also,\r\nin its sheltered valleys, remarkably representative of the deciduous\r\ngrowths of the entire Appalachian region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCHMAN'S BAY FROM THE EAST CLIFF OF CHAMPLAIN\r\nMOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nLafayette National Park]\r\n\r\nThe bird life is full and varied. The food supply attracts migratory\r\nbirds, and aquatic birds find here the conditions which make for\r\nincrease. Deer are returning in some numbers from the mainland.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the Lafayette National Park, small though it is, is one of the\r\nmost important members of the national parks system. For the pleasure\r\nseeker no other provides so wide and varied an opportunity. To the\r\nstudent, no other offers a more readable or more distinctive volume; it\r\nis the only national museum of the fascinating geology of the east, and\r\nI can think of no other place in the east where classes can find so\r\nvaried and so significant an exhibit. To the artist, the poet, and the\r\ndreamer it presents vistas of ocean, inlet, fiord, shore, wave-lashed\r\npromontory, bog, meadow, forest, and mountain--an answer to every mood.\r\n\r\nIf this nation, as now appears, must long lack national parks\r\nrepresentative of the range of its splendid east, let us be thankful\r\nthat this one small park is so complete and so distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANIC NATIONAL PARKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE VOLCANO IN SCENERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volcanic national parks are Lassen Volcanic, Crater Lake, Mount\r\nRainier, Yellowstone, and Hawaii. Though several of them exhibit\r\nextremely high mountains, their scenic ensemble differs in almost all\r\nrespects from that of the granite parks. The landscape tends to broad\r\nelevated surfaces and rolling hills, from which rise sharp towering\r\ncones or massive mountains whose irregular bulging knobs were formed by\r\noutbreaks of lava upon the sides of original central vents.\r\n\r\nThe Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon, and northern California are\r\none of the best examples of such a landscape; from its low swelling\r\nsummits rise at intervals the powerful master cones of Shasta, Rainier,\r\nAdams, Hood, Baker, and others. Fujiyama, the celebrated mountain of\r\nJapan, may be cited as a familiar example of the basic mountain form,\r\nthe single-cone volcanic peak. Vesuvius is a familiar example of simple\r\ncomplication, the double-cone volcano, while Mauna Loa in Hawaii,\r\nincluding Kilauea of the pit of fire, a neighbor volcano which it has\r\nalmost engulfed in its swollen bulk, well illustrates the volcano built\r\nup by outpourings of lava from vents broken through its sides. Flat and\r\nrolling Yellowstone with its geyser fields, is one of the best possible\r\nexamples of a dead and much eroded volcanic region.\r\n\r\nThe scenic detail of the volcanic landscape is interesting and different\r\nfrom any other. Centuries and the elements create from lava a soil of\r\ngreat fertility. No forests and wild flowers excel those growing on the\r\nlavas of the Cascades, and the fertility of the Hawaiian Islands, which\r\nare entirely volcanic, is world-famous. Streams cut deep and often\r\nhighly colored canyons in these broad lava lands, and wind and rain,\r\nwhile eroding valleys, often leave ornately modelled edifices of harder\r\nrock, and tall thin needles pointing to the zenith.\r\n\r\nIn the near neighborhood of the volcanoes, as well as on their sloping\r\nsides, are found lava formations of many strange and wonderful kinds.\r\nHot springs and bubbling paint pots abound; and in the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park, geysers. Fields of fantastic, twisted shapes, masses\r\nsuggesting heaps of tumbled ropes, upstanding spatter cones, caves\r\narched with lava roofs, are a very few of the very many phenomena which\r\nthe climber of a volcano encounters on his way. And at the top, broad,\r\nbowl-shaped craters, whose walls are sometimes many hundred feet deep,\r\nenclose, if the crater has long been dormant, sandy floors, from which,\r\nperhaps, small cinder cones arise. If the crater still is active, the\r\nadventurer's experiences are limited only by his daring.\r\n\r\nThe entire region, in short, strikingly differs from any other of scenic\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nOf the several processes of world-making, all of which are progressing\r\nto-day at normal speed, none is so thrilling as volcanism, because no\r\nother concentrates action into terms of human grasp. Lassen Peak's\r\neruption of a thousand cubic yards of lava in a few hours thrills us\r\nmore than the Mississippi's erosion of an average foot of her vast\r\nvalley in a hundred thousand years; yet the latter is enormously the\r\ngreater. The explosion of Mount Katmai, the rise and fall of Kilauea's\r\nboiling lava, the playing of Yellowstone's monster geysers, the\r\nspectacle of Mazama's lake-filled crater, the steaming of the Cascade's\r\nmyriad bubbling springs, all make strong appeal to the imagination. They\r\ncarry home the realization of mysterious, overwhelming power.\r\n\r\nLava is molten rock of excessively high temperature, which suddenly\r\nbecomes released from the fearful pressures of earth's interior. Hurled\r\nfrom volcanic vents, or gushing from cracks in the earth's skin, it\r\nspreads rapidly over large neighborhoods, filling valleys and raising\r\nbulky rounded masses.\r\n\r\nOften it is soft and frothy, like pumice. Even in its frequent glass\r\nforms, obsidian, for example, it easily disintegrates. There are as many\r\nkinds of lava as there are kinds of rock from which it is formed.\r\n\r\nVolcanic scenery is by no means confined to what we call the volcanic\r\nnational parks. Volcanoes were frequent in many parts of the continent.\r\nWe meet their remnants unexpectedly among the granites of the Rockies\r\nand the Sierra, and the sedimentary rocks of the west and the southwest.\r\nSeveral of our national parks besides those prevailingly volcanic, and\r\nseveral of our most distinguished national monuments, exhibit\r\ninteresting volcanic interludes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nLASSEN PEAK AND MOUNT KATMAI\r\n\r\nTHE ONE A NATIONAL PARK IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE OTHER A NATIONAL\r\nMONUMENT IN ALASKA\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause most of the conspicuous volcanic eruptions of our day have\r\noccurred in warmer climes nearer the equator, we usually think of\r\nvolcanoes as tropical, or semi-tropical, phenomena. Vesuvius is in the\r\nMediterranean, Pelee in the Caribbean, Mauna Loa and Kilauea on the\r\nHawaiian Islands. Of course there is Lassen Peak in California--the\r\nexception, as we say, which proves the rule.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, many of the world's greatest volcanoes are very far indeed\r\nfrom the tropics. Volcanoes result from the movement of earth masses\r\nseeking equilibrium underneath earth's crust, but near enough to the\r\nsurface to enable molten rock under terrific pressure to work upward\r\nfrom isolated pockets and break through. Volcanoes occur in all\r\nlatitudes. Even Iceland has its great volcano. It is true that the\r\nvolcano map shows them congregating thickly in a broad band, of which\r\nthe equator is the centre, but it also shows them bordering the Pacific\r\nCoast from Patagonia to Alaska, crossing the ocean through the Aleutian\r\nIslands, and extending far down the Asian coast. It also shows many\r\ninland volcanoes, isolated and in series. The distribution is\r\nexceedingly wide.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes usually occur in belts which may or may not coincide with\r\nlines of weakening in the earth's crust below. Hence the series of\r\nflaming torches of prehistoric days which, their fires now extinguished\r\nand their sides swathed in ice, have become in our day the row of\r\nspectacular peaks extending from northern California to Puget Sound.\r\nHence also the long range of threatening summits which skirts Alaska's\r\nsouthern shore, to-day the world's most active volcanic belt. Here it\r\nwas that Katmai's summit was lost in the mighty explosion of June, 1912,\r\none of enormous violence, which followed tremendous eruptions elsewhere\r\nalong the same coast, and is expected to be followed by others, perhaps\r\nof even greater immensity and power.\r\n\r\nThese two volcanic belts contain each an active volcano which Congress\r\nhas made the centre of a national reservation. Lassen Peak, some wise\r\nmen believe, is the last exhibit of activity in the dying volcanism of\r\nthe Cascade Mountains. Mount Katmai is the latest and greatest exhibit\r\nin a volcanic belt which is believed to be young and growing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING OF THE CASCADES\r\n\r\nMillions of years ago, in the period which geologists call Tertiary, the\r\npressure under that part of the crust of the earth which now is\r\nWashington, Oregon, and northern California, became too powerful for\r\nsolid rock to withstand. Long lines of hills appeared parallel to the\r\nsea, and gradually rose hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of feet. These\r\ncracked, and from the long summit-fissures issued hot lava, which spread\r\nover enormous areas and, cooling, laid the foundations for the coming\r\nCascade Mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen the gaping fissures eased the pressure from beneath, they filled\r\nwith ash and lava except at certain vent holes, around which grew the\r\nvolcanoes which, when their usefulness as chimneys passed, became those\r\ncones of ice and snow which now are the glory of our northwest.\r\n\r\nThere may have been at one time many hundreds of these volcanoes, big\r\nand little. Most of them doubtless quickly perished under the growing\r\nslopes of their larger neighbors, and, as they became choked with ash,\r\nthe lava which had been finding vent through them sought other doors of\r\nescape, and found them in the larger volcanoes. Thus, by natural\r\nselection, there survived at last that knightly company of monsters now\r\nuniformed in ice, which includes, from north to south, such celebrities\r\nas Mount Baker, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Mount\r\nHood, vanished Mount Mazama, Mount Shasta, and living Lassen Peak.\r\n\r\nWhether or not several of these vast beacons lit Pacific's nights at one\r\ntime can never be known with certainty, but probability makes the claim.\r\nWhether or not in their decline the canoes of prehistoric men found\r\nharbor by guidance of their pillars of fire by night, and their pillars\r\nof smoke by day is less probable but possible. One at least of the giant\r\nband, Lassen Peak, is semi-active to-day. At least two others, Mount\r\nRainier and Mount Baker, offer evidences of internal heat beneath their\r\nmail of ice. And early settlers in the northwest report Indian\r\ntraditions of the awful cataclysm in which Mount Rainier lost two\r\nthousand feet of cone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASSEN PEAK NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nLassen Peak, the last of the Cascades in active eruption, rises between\r\nthe northern end of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, of which it is locally\r\nbut wrongly considered a part, and the Klamath Mountains, a spur of the\r\nCascades. Actually it is the southern terminus of the Cascades.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThough quiet for more than two hundred years, the region long has\r\nenjoyed scientific and popular interest because it possesses hot\r\nsprings, mud volcanoes and other minor volcanic phenomena, and\r\nparticularly because its cones, which are easily climbed and studied,\r\nhave remained very nearly perfect. Besides Lassen Peak, whose altitude\r\nis 10,437 feet, there are others of large size and great interest close\r\nby. Prospect Peak attains the altitude of 9,200 feet; Harkness Peak\r\n9,000 feet; and Cinder Cone, a specimen of unusual beauty, 6,907 feet.\r\n\r\nBecause it seemed desirable to conserve the best two of these examples\r\nof recent volcanism, President Taft in 1906 created the Lassen Peak and\r\nthe Cinder Cone National Monuments. Doubtless there would have been no\r\nchange in the status of these reservations had not Lassen Peak broken\r\nits long sleep in the spring of 1914 with a series of eruptions covering\r\na period of nineteen months. This centred attention upon the region, and\r\nin August, 1916, Congress created the Lassen Volcanic National Park, a\r\nreservation of a hundred and twenty-four square miles, which included\r\nboth national monuments, other notable cones of the neighborhood, and\r\npractically all the hot springs and other lesser phenomena. Four months\r\nafter the creation of the national park Lassen Peak ceased activity with\r\nits two hundred and twelfth eruption. It is not expected to resume. For\r\nsome years, however, scientists will continue to class it as\r\nsemi-active.\r\n\r\nThese eruptions, none of which produced any considerable lava flow, are\r\nregarded as probably the dying gasps of the volcanic energy of the\r\nCascades. They began in May, 1914, with sharp explosions of steam and\r\nsmoke from the summit crater. The news aroused wide-spread interest\r\nthroughout the United States; it was the first volcanic eruption within\r\nthe national boundaries. During the following summer there were\r\nthirty-eight slight similar eruptions, some of which scattered ashes in\r\nthe neighborhood. The spectacle was one of magnificence because of the\r\nheavy columns of smoke. Eruptions increased in frequency with winter,\r\nfifty-six occurring during the balance of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by J.S. Diller_\r\n\r\nLASSEN PEAK SEEN FROM THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\nOn the left is the material last erupted from the slope of the peak. It\r\nis called Chaos]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by J.S. Diller_\r\n\r\nLASSEN PEAK CLOSE UP\r\n\r\nShowing the northeast slope as seen from Chaos]\r\n\r\nAbout the end of March, 1915, according to Doctor J.S. Diller of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, new lava had filled the crater and\r\noverflowed the west slope a thousand feet. On May 22 following occurred\r\nthe greatest eruption of the series. A mushroom-shaped cloud of smoke\r\nburst four miles upward in air. The spectacle, one of grandeur, was\r\nplainly visible even from the Sacramento Valley. \"At night,\" writes\r\nDoctor Diller, \"flashes of light from the mountain summit, flying\r\nrocket-like bodies and cloud-glows over the crater reflecting the light\r\nfrom incandescent lavas below, were seen by many observers from various\r\npoints of view, and appear to indicate that much of the material erupted\r\nwas sufficiently hot to be luminous.\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting phenomenon was the blast of superheated gas which\r\nswept down Lost Creek and Hot Creek Valleys. For ten miles it withered\r\nand destroyed every living thing in its path. Large trees were uprooted.\r\nForests were scorched to a cinder. Snow-fields were instantly turned to\r\nwater and flooded the lower valleys with rushing tides.\r\n\r\nLater examination showed that this explosion had opened a new fissure,\r\nand that the old and new craters, now joined in one, were filled with a\r\nlava lid. Following this, the eruptions steadily declined in violence\r\ntill their close the following December.\r\n\r\nAs a national park, though undeveloped and unequipped as yet, Lassen has\r\nmany charms besides its volcanic phenomena. Its western and southern\r\nslopes are thickly forested and possess fine lakes and streams. Several\r\nthousand persons, largely motorists, have visited it yearly of late.\r\nThere are hot springs at Drakesbad, just within the southern border,\r\nwhich have local popularity as baths. The trout-fishing in lake and\r\nstream is excellent, and shooting is encouraged in the extensive\r\nnational forest which surrounds the park, but not in the park itself,\r\nwhich is sanctuary. In spite of the hunting, deer are still found.\r\n\r\nThe greatest pleasure, however, will be found in exploring the\r\nvolcanoes, from whose summits views are obtainable of many miles of this\r\ntumbled and splendidly forested part of California and of the dry plains\r\nof the Great Basin on its east.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KATMAI NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nWe turn from the dying flutter of California's last remaining active\r\nvolcano to the excessive violence of a volcano in the extremely active\r\nAlaskan coast range. The Mount Katmai National Monument will have few\r\nvisitors because it is inaccessible by anything less than an\r\nexploring-party. We know it principally from the reports of four\r\nexpeditions by the National Geographic Society. Informed by these\r\nreports, President Wilson created it a national monument in 1918.\r\n\r\nA remarkable volcanic belt begins in southern Alaska at the head of Cook\r\nInlet, and follows the coast in a broad southwesterly curve fifteen\r\nhundred miles long through the Alaskan Peninsula to the end of the\r\nAleutian Islands, nearly enclosing Behring Sea. It is very ancient. Its\r\nmainland segment contains a dozen peaks, which are classed as active or\r\nlatent, and its island segment many other volcanoes. St. Augustine's\r\neruption in 1883 was one of extreme violence. Kugak was active in 1889.\r\nVeniaminof's eruption in 1892 ranked with St. Augustine's. Redoubt\r\nerupted in 1902, and Katmai, with excessive violence, in June, 1912. The\r\nentire belt is alive with volcanic excitement. Pavlof, at the\r\npeninsula's end, has been steaming for years, and several others are\r\nunder expectant scientific observation. Katmai may be outdone at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nKatmai is a peak of 6,970 feet altitude, on treacherous Shelikof Strait,\r\nopposite Kodiak Island. It rises from an inhospitable shore far from\r\nsteamer routes or other recognized lines of travel. Until it announced\r\nitself with a roar which was heard at Juneau, seven hundred and fifty\r\nmiles away, its very existence was probably unknown except to a few\r\nprospectors, fishermen, geographers, and geologists. Earthquakes\r\nfollowed the blast, then followed night of smoke and dust. Darkness\r\nlasted sixty hours at Kodiak, a hundred miles away. Dust fell as far as\r\nKetchikan, nine hundred miles away. Fumes were borne on the wind as far\r\nas Vancouver Island, fifteen hundred miles away. Weather Bureau reports\r\nnoted haziness as far away as Virginia during succeeding weeks, and the\r\nextraordinary haziness in Europe during the following summer is noted by\r\nDoctor C.S. Abbott, Director of the Astrophysical Observatory of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, in connection with this eruption.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Katmai's is by no means the greatest volcanic eruption.\r\nKatmai's output of ash was about five cubic miles. Several eruptions\r\nhave greatly exceeded that in bulk, notably that of Tomboro, in the\r\nisland of Sumbawa, near Java, in 1815, when more than twenty-eight cubic\r\nmiles of ash were flung to the winds. Comparison with many great\r\neruptions whose output was principally lava is of course impossible.\r\n\r\nThe scene of this explosion is the national monument of to-day. The\r\nhollowed shell of Katmai's summit is a spectacle of wonderment and\r\ngrandeur. Robert F. Griggs, who headed the expeditions which explored\r\nit, states that the area of the crater is 8.4 square miles, measured\r\nalong the highest point of the rim. The abyss is 2.6 miles long, 7.6\r\nmiles in circumference, and 4.2 square miles in area. A lake has formed\r\nwithin it which is 1.4 miles long and nine-tenths of a mile wide. Its\r\ndepth is unknown. The precipice from the lake to the highest point of\r\nthe rim measures thirty-seven hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting exhibit of the Katmai National Monument, however,\r\nis a group of neighboring valleys just across the western divide, the\r\nprincipal one of which Mr. Griggs, with picturesque inaccuracy, named\r\nthe \"Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes\"; for, from its floor and sides and\r\nthe floors and sides of smaller tributary valleys, superheated steam\r\nissues in thousands of hissing columns. It is an appalling spectacle.\r\nThe temperatures of this steam are extremely high; Griggs reports one\r\ninstance of 432 degrees Centigrade, which would equal 948 degrees\r\nFahrenheit; in some vents he found a higher temperature at the surface\r\nthan a few feet down its throat. The very ground is hot.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenal valley is not to be fully explained offhand; as Griggs\r\nsays, there are many problems to work out. The steam vents appear to be\r\nvery recent. They did not exist when Spurr crossed the valley in 1898,\r\nand Martin heard nothing of them when he was in the near neighborhood in\r\n1903 and 1904. The same volcanic impulse which found its main relief in\r\nthe explosive eruption of near-by Katmai in 1912 no doubt cracked the\r\ndeep-lying rocks beneath this group of valleys, exposing superheated\r\nrocks to subterranean waters which forthwith turned to steam and forced\r\nthese vents for escape. Griggs reports that volcanic gases mingle freely\r\nwith the steam.\r\n\r\nThe waters may have one or more of several sources; perhaps they come\r\nfrom deep springs originating in surface snows and rains; perhaps they\r\nseep in from the sea. Whatever their origin the region especially\r\ninterests us as a probably early stage of phenomena whose later stages\r\nfind conspicuous examples in several of our national parks. Some day,\r\nwith the cooling of the region, this may become the valley of ten\r\nthousand hot springs.\r\n\r\nBut it is useful and within scientific probability to carry this\r\nconception much further. The comparison between Katmai's steaming\r\nvalleys and the geyser basin of Yellowstone is especially instructive\r\nbecause Yellowstone's basins doubtless once were what Katmai's steaming\r\nvalleys are now. The \"Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes\" may well be a\r\ncoming geyser-field of enormous size. The explanation is simple.\r\nBunsen's geyser theory, now generally accepted, presupposes a column of\r\nwater filling the geyser vent above a deep rocky superheated chamber, in\r\nwhich entering water is being rapidly turned into steam. When this steam\r\nbecomes plentiful enough and sufficiently compressed to overcome the\r\nweight of the water in the vent, it suddenly expands and hurls the water\r\nout. That is what makes the geyser play.\r\n\r\nNow one difference between the Yellowstone geyser-fields and Katmai's\r\nsteaming valleys is just a difference in temperature. The entire depth\r\nof earth under these valleys is heated far above boiling-point, so that\r\nit is not possible for water to remain in the vents; it turns to steam\r\nas fast as it collects and rushes out at the top in continuous flow. But\r\nwhen enough thousands of centuries elapse for the rocks between the\r\nsurface and the deep internal pockets to cool, the water will remain in\r\nmany vents as water until, at regular intervals, enough steam gathers\r\nbelow to hurl it out. Then these valleys will become basins of geysers\r\nand hot springs like Yellowstone's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMOUNT RAINIER, ICY OCTOPUS\r\n\r\nMOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, WEST CENTRAL WASHINGTON. AREA, 324 SQUARE\r\nMILES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMount Rainier, the loftiest volcano within the boundaries of the United\r\nStates, one of our greatest mountains, and certainly our most imposing\r\nmountain, rises from western central Washington to an altitude of 14,408\r\nfeet above mean tide in Puget Sound. It is forty-two miles in direct\r\nline from the centre of Tacoma, and fifty-seven miles from Seattle, from\r\nboth of which its glistening peak is often a prominent spectacle. With\r\nfavoring atmospheric conditions it can be seen a hundred and fifty miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\nNorth and south of Rainier, the Cascade Mountains bear other snow-capped\r\nvolcanic peaks. Baker rises 10,703 feet; Adams, 12,307 feet; St. Helens,\r\n9,697 feet; Hood, 11,225 feet, and Shasta, 14,162 feet. But Rainier\r\nsurpasses them all in height, bulk, and majesty. Once it stood 16,000\r\nfeet, as is indicated by the slopes leading up to its broken and\r\nflattened top. The supposition is that nearly two thousand feet of its\r\napex were carried away in one or more explosive eruptions long before\r\nhistory, but possibly not before man; there are Indian traditions of a\r\ncataclysm. There were slight eruptions in 1843, 1854, 1858, and 1870,\r\nand from the two craters at its summit issue many jets of steam which\r\ncomfort the chilled climber.\r\n\r\nThis immense sleeping cone is blanketed in ice. Twenty-eight\r\nwell-defined glaciers flow down its sides, several of which are nearly\r\nsix miles long. Imagining ourselves looking down from an airplane at a\r\ngreat height, we can think of seeing it as an enormous frozen octopus\r\nsprawling upon the grass, for its curving arms of ice, reaching out in\r\nall directions, penetrate one of the finest forests even of our\r\nnorthwest. The contrast between these cold glaciers and the luxuriantly\r\nwild-flowered and forest-edged meadows which border them as snugly as so\r\nmany rippling summer rivers affords one of the most delightful features\r\nof the Mount Rainier National Park. Paradise Inn, for example, stands in\r\na meadow of wild flowers between Rainier's icy front on the one side and\r\nthe snowy Tatoosh Range on the other, with the Nisqually Glacier fifteen\r\nminutes' walk away!\r\n\r\nThe casual tourist who has looked at the Snowy Range of the Rockies from\r\nthe distant comfort of Estes Park, or the High Sierra from the\r\ndining-porch of the Glacier Point Hotel, receives an invigorating shock\r\nof astonishment at beholding Mount Rainier even at a distance. Its\r\nisolation gives it enormous scenic advantage. Mount Whitney of the\r\nSierra, our loftiest summit, which overtops it ninety-three feet, is\r\nmerely the climax in a tempestuous ocean of snowy neighbors which are\r\nonly less lofty; Rainier towers nearly eight thousand feet above its\r\nsurrounding mountains. It springs so powerfully into the air that one\r\ninvoluntarily looks for signs of life and action. But no smoke rises\r\nfrom its broken top. It is still and helpless, shackled in bonds of ice.\r\nWill it remain bound? Or will it, with due warning, destroy in a day the\r\nelaborate system of glaciers which countless centuries have built, and\r\nleave a new and different, and perhaps, after years of glacial recovery,\r\neven a more gloriously beautiful Mount Rainier than now?\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary individuality of the American national parks, their\r\ndifference, each from every other, is nowhere more marked than here.\r\nSingle-peaked glacial systems of the size of Rainier's, of course, are\r\nfound wherever mountains of great size rise in close masses far above\r\nthe line of perpetual snow. The Alaskan Range and the Himalayas may\r\npossess many. But if there is anywhere another mountain of approximate\r\nheight and magnitude, carrying an approximate glacier system, which\r\nrises eight thousand feet higher than its neighbors out of a parkland of\r\nlakes, forests, and wild-flower gardens, which Nature seems to have made\r\nespecially for pleasuring, and the heart of which is reached in four\r\nhours from a large city situated upon transatlantic railway-lines, I\r\nhave not heard of it.\r\n\r\nSeen a hundred miles away, or from the streets of Seattle and Tacoma, or\r\nfrom the motor-road approaching the park, or from the park itself, or\r\nfrom any of the many interglacier valleys, one never gets used to the\r\nspectacle of Rainier. The shock of surprise, the instant sense of\r\nimpossibility, ever repeats itself. The mountain assumes a thousand\r\naspects which change with the hours, with the position of the beholder,\r\nand with atmospheric conditions. Sometimes it is fairy-like, sometimes\r\nthreatening, always majestic. One is not surprised at the Indian's fear.\r\nOften Rainier withdraws his presence altogether behind the horizon\r\nmists; even a few miles away no hint betrays his existence. And very\r\noften, shrouded in snow-storm or cloud, he is lost to those at his foot.\r\n\r\nMysterious and compelling is this ghostly mountain to us who see it for\r\nthe first time, unable to look long away while it remains in view. It is\r\nthe same, old Washingtonians tell me, with those who have kept watching\r\nit every day of visibility for many years. And so it was to Captain\r\nGeorge Vancouver when, first of white men, he looked upon it from the\r\nbridge of the _Discovery_ on May 8, 1792.\r\n\r\n\"The weather was serene and pleasant,\" he wrote under that date, \"and\r\nthe country continued to exhibit, between us and the eastern snowy\r\nrange, the same luxuriant appearance. At its eastern extremity, mount\r\nBaker bore by compass N. 22 E.; the round snowy mountain, now forming\r\nits southern extremity, and which, after my friend Rear Admiral Rainier,\r\nI distinguished by the name of MOUNT RAINIER, bore N. (S.) 42 E.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by A.H. Barnes_\r\n\r\nSOUTHEAST SLOPE OF MOUNT RAINIER\r\n\r\nThe winding glacier is the Cowlitz. Gibraltar is the rock on the right\r\nnear the summit]\r\n\r\nThus Mount Rainier was discovered and named at the same time,\r\npresumably on the same day. Eighteen days later, having followed \"the\r\ninlet,\" meaning Puget Sound, to his point of nearest approach to the\r\nmountain, Vancouver wrote:\r\n\r\n\"We found the inlet to terminate here in an extensive circular compact\r\nbay whose waters washed the base of mount Rainier, though its elevated\r\nsummit was yet at a very considerable distance from the shore, with\r\nwhich it was connected by several ridges of hills rising towards it with\r\ngradual ascent and much regularity. The forest trees and the several\r\nshades of verdure that covered the hills gradually decreased in point of\r\nbeauty until they became invisible; when the perpetual clothing of snow\r\ncommenced which seemed to form a horizontal line from north to south\r\nalong this range of rugged mountains, from whose summit mount Rainier\r\nrose conspicuously, and seemed as much elevated above them as they were\r\nabove the level of the sea; the whole producing a most grand,\r\npicturesque effect.\"\r\n\r\nVancouver made no attempt to reach the mountain. Dreamer of great dreams\r\nthough he was, how like a madhouse nightmare would have seemed to him a\r\ntrue prophecy of mighty engines whose like no human mind had then\r\nconceived, running upon roads of steel and asphalt at speeds which no\r\nhuman mind had then imagined, whirling thousands upon thousands of\r\npleasure-seekers from the shores of that very inlet to the glistening\r\nmountain's flowered sides!\r\n\r\nJust one century after the discovery, the Geological Society of America\r\nstarted the movement to make Mount Rainier a national park. Within a\r\nyear the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the\r\nNational Geographic Society, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the\r\nSierra Club joined in the memorialization of Congress. Six years later,\r\nin 1899, the park was created.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance to the park is up the Nisqually River at the\r\nsouth. Here entered the pioneer, James Longmire, many years ago, and the\r\nroads established by him and his fellows determined the direction of the\r\nfirst national-park development. Longmire Springs, for many years the\r\nnearest resort to the great mountain, lies just within the southern\r\nboundary. Beyond it the road follows the Nisqually and Paradise valleys,\r\nunder glorious groves of pine, cedar, and hemlock, along ravines of\r\nstriking beauty, past waterfalls and the snout of the Nisqually Glacier,\r\nfinally to inimitable Paradise Park, its inn, its hotel camp, and its\r\npublic camping-grounds. Other centres of wilderness life have been since\r\nestablished, and the marvellous north side of the park will be opened by\r\nthe construction of a northwesterly highway up the valley of the Carbon\r\nRiver; already a fine trail entirely around the mountain connects these\r\nvarious points of development.\r\n\r\nBut the southern entrance and Paradise Park will remain for many years\r\nthe principal centre of exploration and pleasuring. Here begins the\r\npopular trail to the summit. Here begin the trails to many of the\r\nfinest viewpoints, the best-known falls, the most accessible of the many\r\nexquisite interglacier gardens. Here the Nisqually Glacier is reached in\r\na few minutes' walk at a point particularly adapted for ice-climbing,\r\nand the comfortable viewing of ice-falls, crevasses, caves, and other\r\nglacier phenomena grandly exhibited in fullest beauty. It is a spot\r\nwhich can have in the nature of things few equals elsewhere in scenic\r\nvariety and grandeur. On one side is the vast glistening mountain; on\r\nthe other side the high serrated Tatoosh Range spattered with perpetual\r\nsnow; in middle distance, details of long winding glaciers seamed with\r\ncrevasses; in the foreground gorgeous rolling meadows of wild flowers\r\ndotted and bordered with equally luxuriant and richly varied forest\r\ngroves; from close-by elevations, a gorgeous tumbled wilderness of\r\nhills, canyons, rivers, lakes, and falls backgrounded by the Cascades\r\nand accented by distant snowy peaks; the whole pervaded by the\r\never-present mountain, always the same yet grandly different, from\r\ndifferent points of view, in the detail of its glaciered sides.\r\n\r\nThe variety of pleasuring is similarly very large. One can ride\r\nhorseback round the mountain in a leisurely week, or spend a month or\r\nmore exploring the greater wilderness of the park. One can tramp the\r\ntrails on long trips, camping by the way, or vary a vacation with\r\nnumerous short tramps. Or one can loaf away the days in dreamy content,\r\nwith now and then a walk, and now and then a ride. Or one can explore\r\nglaciers and climb minor mountains; the Tatoosh Range alone will furnish\r\nthe stiffest as well as the most delightful climbing, with wonderful\r\nrewards upon the jagged summits; while short climbs to points upon\r\nnear-by snow-fields will afford coasting without sleds, an exciting\r\nsport, especially appreciated when one is young. In July, before the\r\nvalley snows melt away, there is tobogganing and skiing within a short\r\nwalk of the Inn.\r\n\r\nThe leisurely tour afoot around the mountain, with pack-train following\r\nthe trail, is an experience never to be forgotten. One passes the snouts\r\nof a score of glaciers, each producing its river, and sees the mountain\r\nfrom every angle, besides having a continuous panorama of the\r\nsurrounding country, including Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Mount\r\nBaker, Tacoma, Seattle, Mount Olympus, the Pacific Ocean, and the\r\nCascades from the Columbia to the international line. Shorter excursions\r\nto other beautiful park-lands offer a wide variety of pleasure. Indian\r\nHenry's Hunting Ground, Van Trump Park, Summerland, and others provide\r\ncharm and beauty as well as fascinating changes in the aspect of the\r\ngreat mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by A.H. Barnes_\r\n\r\nMOUNT ST. HELENS SEEN FROM MOUNT RAINIER PARK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by A.H. Barnes_\r\n\r\nMOUNT ADAMS SEEN FROM MOUNT RAINIER PARK]\r\n\r\nOf course the ascent of the mountain is the ultimate objective of the\r\nclimber, but few, comparatively, will attempt it. It is a feat in\r\nendurance which not many are physically fit to undertake, while to the\r\nunfit there are no rewards. There is comparatively little rock-climbing,\r\nbut what there is will try wind and muscle. Most of the way is tramping\r\nup long snow-covered and ice-covered slopes, with little rest from the\r\nstart at midnight to the return, if all goes well, before the following\r\nsundown. Face and hands are painted to protect against sunburn, and\r\ncolored glasses avert snow-blindness. Success is so largely a matter of\r\nphysical condition that many ambitious tourists are advised to practise\r\nawhile on the Tatoosh Range before attempting the trip.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see Pinnacle Peak up there?\" they ask you. \"If you can make that\r\nyou can make Rainier. Better try it first.\"\r\n\r\nAnd many who try Pinnacle Peak do not make it.\r\n\r\nAs with every very lofty mountain the view from the summit depends upon\r\nthe conditions of the moment. Often Rainier's summit is lost in mists\r\nand clouds, and there is no view. Very often on the clearest day clouds\r\ncontinually gather and dissipate; one is lucky in the particular time he\r\nis on top. Frequently there are partial views. Occasionally every\r\ncondition favors, and then indeed the reward is great. S.F. Emmons, who\r\nmade the second ascent, and after whom one of Rainier's greatest\r\nglaciers was named, stood on the summit upon one of those fortunate\r\nmoments. The entire mountain in all its inspiring detail lay at his\r\nfeet, a wonder spectacle of first magnitude.\r\n\r\n\"Looking to the more distant country,\" he wrote, \"the whole stretch of\r\nPuget Sound, seeming like a pretty little lake embowered in green, could\r\nbe seen in the northwest, beyond which the Olympic Mountains extend out\r\ninto the Pacific Ocean. The Cascade Mountains, lying dwarfed at our\r\nfeet, could be traced northward into British Columbia and southward into\r\nOregon, while above them, at comparatively regular intervals, rose the\r\nghostlike forms of our companion volcanoes. To the eastward the eye\r\nranged over hundreds of miles, over chain on chain of mountain ridges\r\nwhich gradually disappeared in the dim blue distance.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rigors of the ascent parties leave Paradise Inn for\r\nthe summit every suitable day. Hundreds make the ascent each summer. To\r\nthe experienced mountain-climber it presents no special difficulties. To\r\nthe inexperienced it is an extraordinary adventure. Certainly no one\r\nknows his Mount Rainier who has not measured its gigantic proportions in\r\nunits of his own endurance.\r\n\r\nThe first successful ascent was made by General Hazard Stevens and P.B.\r\nVan Trump, both residents of Washington, on August 17, 1870. Starting\r\nfrom James Longmire's with Mr. Longmire himself as guide up the\r\nNisqually Valley, they spent several days in finding the Indian\r\nSluiskin, who should take them to the summit. With him, then, assuming\r\nLongmire's place, Stevens and Van Trump started on their great\r\nadventure. It proved more of an adventure than they anticipated, for not\r\nfar below the picturesque falls which they named after Sluiskin, the\r\nIndian stopped and begged them to go no farther. From that compilation\r\nof scholarly worth, by Professor Edmond S. Meany, President of the\r\nMountaineers, entitled \"Mount Rainier, a Record of Exploration,\" I\r\nquote General Stevens's translation of Sluiskin's protest:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, my good friends,\" said Sluiskin, \"I must talk with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your plan to climb Takhoma is all foolishness. No one can do it and\r\nlive. A mighty chief dwells upon the summit in a lake of fire. He brooks\r\nno intruders.\r\n\r\n\"Many years ago my grandfather, the greatest and bravest chief of all\r\nthe Yakima, climbed nearly to the summit. There he caught sight of the\r\nfiery lake and the infernal demon coming to destroy him, and fled down\r\nthe mountain, glad to escape with his life. Where he failed, no other\r\nIndian ever dared make the attempt.\r\n\r\n\"At first the way is easy, the task seems light. The broad snow-fields\r\nover which I have often hunted the mountain-goat offer an inviting path.\r\nBut above them you will have to climb over steep rocks overhanging deep\r\ngorges, where a misstep would hurl you far down--down to certain death.\r\nYou must creep over steep snow-banks and cross deep crevasses where a\r\nmountain-goat would hardly keep his footing. You must climb along steep\r\ncliffs where rocks are continually falling to crush you or knock you off\r\ninto the bottomless depths.\r\n\r\n\"And if you should escape these perils and reach the great snowy dome,\r\nthen a bitterly cold and furious tempest will sweep you off into space\r\nlike a withered leaf. But if by some miracle you should survive all\r\nthese perils, the mighty demon of Takhoma will surely kill you and throw\r\nyou into the fiery lake.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you go. You make my heart sick when you talk of climbing Takhoma.\r\nYou will perish if you try to climb Takhoma. You will perish and your\r\npeople will blame me.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go! Don't go! If you go I will wait here two days and then go to\r\nOlympia and tell your people that you perished on Takhoma. Give me a\r\npaper to them to let them know that I am not to blame for your death. My\r\ntalk is ended.\"\r\n\r\nExcept for the demon and his lake of fire, Sluiskin's portent of\r\nhardship proved to be a literal, even a modest, prophecy. At five\r\no'clock in the evening, after eleven hours of struggle with precipices\r\nand glaciers, exhausted, chilled, and without food, they faced a night\r\nof zero gales upon the summit. The discovery of comforting steam-jets in\r\na neighboring crater, the reality perhaps of Sluiskin's lake of fire,\r\nmade the night livable, though one of suffering. It was afternoon of the\r\nfollowing day before they reached camp and found an astonished Sluiskin,\r\nthen, in fact, on the point of leaving to report their unfortunate\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nStevens and Van Trump were doubly pioneers, for their way up the\r\nmountain is, in general direction at least, the popular way to-day,\r\ngreatly bettered since, however, by the short cuts and easier detours\r\nwhich have followed upon experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOur four volcanic national parks exemplify four states of volcanic\r\nhistory. Lassen Peak is semi-active; Mount Rainier is dormant;\r\nYellowstone is dead, and Crater Lake marks the spot through which a\r\nvolcano collapsed and disappeared. Rainier's usefulness as a volcanic\r\nexample, however, is lost in its supreme usefulness as a glacial\r\nexhibit. The student of glaciers who begins here with the glacier in\r\naction, and then studies the effects of glaciers upon igneous rocks\r\namong the cirques of the Sierra, and upon sedimentary rocks in the\r\nGlacier National Park, will study the masters; which, by the way, is a\r\ntip for universities contemplating summer field-classes.\r\n\r\nUpon the truncated top of Mount Rainier, nearly three miles in diameter,\r\nrise two small cinder cones which form, at the junction of their\r\ncraters, the mountain's rounded snow-covered summit. It is known as\r\nColumbia Crest. As this only rises four hundred feet above the older\r\ncontaining crater, it is not always identified from below as the highest\r\npoint. Two commanding rocky elevations of the old rim, Point Success on\r\nits southwest side, 14,150 feet, and Liberty Cap on its northwest side,\r\n14,112 feet, appear to be, from the mountain's foot, its points of\r\ngreatest altitude.\r\n\r\nRainier's top, though covered with snow and ice, except in spots bared\r\nby internal heat, is not the source of its glaciers, although its\r\nextensive ice-fields flow into and feed several of them. The glaciers\r\nthemselves, even those continuous with the summit ice, really originate\r\nabout four thousand feet below the top in cirques or pockets which are\r\nprincipally fed with the tremendous snows of winter, and the wind\r\nsweepings and avalanches from the summit. The Pacific winds are charged\r\nheavily with moisture which descends upon Rainier in snows of great\r\ndepth. Even Paradise Park is snowed under from twelve to thirty feet.\r\nThere is a photograph of a ranger cabin in February which shows only a\r\nslight snow-mound with a hole in its top which locates the hidden\r\nchimney. F.E. Matthes, the geologist, tells of a snow level of fifty\r\nfeet depth in Indian Henry's Hunting Ground, one of Rainier's most\r\nbeautiful parks, in which the wind had sunk a crater-like hollow from\r\nthe bottom of which emerged a chimney. These snows replenish the\r\nglaciers, which have a combined surface of forty-five square miles,\r\nalong their entire length, in addition to making enormous accumulations\r\nin the cirques.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLUISKIN RIDGE AND COLUMBIA CREST]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by A.H. Barnes_\r\n\r\nMOUNT RAINIER SEEN FROM TACOMA]\r\n\r\nBeginning then in its cirque, as a river often begins in its lake, the\r\nglacier flows downward, river-like, along a course of least resistance.\r\nHere it pours over a precipice in broken falls to flatten out in perfect\r\ntexture in the even stretch below. Here it plunges down rapids, breaking\r\ninto crevasses as the river in corresponding phase breaks into ripples.\r\nHere it rises smoothly over rocks upon its bottom. Here it strikes\r\nagainst a wall of rock and turns sharply. The parallel between the\r\nglacier and the river is striking and consistent, notwithstanding that\r\nthe geologist for technical reasons will quarrel with you if you\r\npicturesquely call your glacier a river of ice. Any elevated viewpoint\r\nwill disclose several or many of these mighty streams flowing in\r\nsnakelike curves down the mountainside, the greater streams swollen here\r\nand there by tributaries as rivers are swollen by entering creeks. And\r\nall eventually reach a point, determined by temperature and therefore\r\nnot constant, where the river of ice becomes the river of water.\r\n\r\nBeginning white and pure, the glacier gradually clothes itself in rock\r\nand dirt. Gathering as it moves narrow edges of matter filched from the\r\nshores, later on it heaps these up upon its lower banks. They are\r\nlateral moraines. Two merging glaciers unite the material carried on\r\ntheir joined edges and form a medial moraine, a ribbon broadening and\r\nthickening as it descends; a glacier made up of several tributaries\r\ncarries as many medial moraines. It also carries much unorganized matter\r\nfallen from the cliffs or scraped from the bottom. Approaching the\r\nsnout, all these accumulations merge into one moraine; and so soiled has\r\nthe ice now become that it is difficult to tell which is ice and which\r\nis rock. At its snout is an ice-cave far inside of which the resultant\r\nriver originates.\r\n\r\nBut the glacier has one very important function which the river does not\r\nshare. Far up at its beginnings it freezes to the back wall of its\r\ncirque, and, moving forward, pulls out, or plucks out, as the\r\ngeologists have it, masses of rock which it carries away in its current.\r\nThe resulting cavities in the back of the cirque fill with ice, which in\r\nits turn freezes fast and plucks out more rock. And presently the back\r\nwall of the cirque, undermined, falls on the ice and also is carried\r\naway. There is left a precipice, often sheerly perpendicular; and, as\r\nthe process repeats itself, this precipice moves backward. At the\r\nbeginning of this process, it must be understood, the glacier lies upon\r\na tilted surface far more elevated than now when you see it in its old\r\nage, sunk deep in its self-dug trench; and, while it is plucking\r\nbackward and breaking off an ever-increasing precipice above it, it is\r\nplucking downward, too. If the rock is even in structure, this downward\r\ncutting may be very nearly perpendicular, but if the rock lies in strata\r\nof varying hardness, shelves form where the harder strata are\r\nencountered because it takes longer to cut them through; in this way are\r\nformed the long series of steps which we often see in empty glacial\r\ncirques.\r\n\r\nBy this process of backward and downward plucking, the Carbon Glacier\r\nbit its way into the north side of the great volcano until it invaded\r\nthe very foundations of the summit and created the Willis Wall which\r\ndrops avalanches thirty-six hundred feet to the glacier below. Willis\r\nWall is nearly perpendicular because the lava rock at this point was\r\nhomogeneous. But in the alternating shale and limestone strata of\r\nGlacier National Park, on the other hand, the glaciers of old dug\r\ncirques of many shelves. The monster ice-streams which dug Glacier's\r\nmighty valleys have vanished, but often tiny remainders are still seen\r\nupon the cirques' topmost shelves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Asahel Curtis_\r\n\r\nMOUNT RAINIER AND PARADISE INN IN SUMMER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Jacobs_\r\n\r\nWINTER PLEASURES AT PARADISE INN, MOUNT RAINIER]\r\n\r\nSo we see that the glacier acquires its cargo of rock not only by\r\nscraping its sides and plucking it from the bottom of its cirque and\r\nvalley, but by quarrying backward till undermined material drops upon\r\nit; all of this in fulfilment of Nature's purpose of wearing down the\r\nhighlands for the upbuilding of the hollows.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for a detailed description of Mount Rainier's\r\ntwenty-eight glaciers. A glance at the map will tell something of the\r\nstory. Extending northeasterly from the summit will be seen the greatest\r\nunbroken glacial mass. Here are the Emmons and the Winthrop Glaciers,\r\nmuch the largest of all. This is the quarter farthest from the sun, upon\r\nwhich its rays strike at the flattest angle. The melting then is least\r\nhere. But still a more potent reason for their larger mass is found in\r\ntheir position on the lee quarter of the peak, the prevailing winds\r\nwhirling in the snow from both sides.\r\n\r\nThe greater diversification of the other sides of the mountain with\r\nextruding cliffs, cleavers, and enormous rock masses tends strongly to\r\nscenic variety and grandeur. Some of the rock cleavers which divide\r\nglaciers stand several thousand feet in height, veritable fences. Some\r\nof the cliffs would be mountains of no mean size elsewhere, and around\r\ntheir sides pour mighty glacial currents, cascading to the depths below\r\nwhere again they may meet and even merge.\r\n\r\nThe Nisqually Glacier naturally is the most celebrated, not because of\r\nscenic superiority, but because it is the neighbor and the playground of\r\nthe visiting thousands. Its perfect and wonderful beauty are not in\r\nexcess of many others; and it is much smaller than many. The Cowlitz\r\nGlacier near by exceeds it in size, and is one of the stateliest; it\r\nsprings from a cirque below Gibraltar, a massive near-summit rock, whose\r\nwell-deserved celebrity is due in some part to its nearness to the\r\ntravelled summit trail. The point I am making is not in depreciation of\r\nany of the celebrated sights from the southern side, but in emphasis of\r\nthe fact that a hundred other sights would be as celebrated, or more\r\ncelebrated, were they as well known. The Mount Rainier National Park at\r\nthis writing is replete with splendors which are yet to be discovered by\r\nthe greater travelling public.\r\n\r\nThe great north side, for instance, with its mighty walls, its\r\nmagnificently scenic glaciers, its lakes, canyons, and enormous areas of\r\nflowered and forested pleasure-grounds, is destined to wide development;\r\nit is a national park in itself. Already roads enter to camps at the\r\nfoot of great glaciers. The west side, also, with its four spectacular\r\nglaciers which pass under the names of Mowich and Tahoma, attains\r\nsublimity; it remains also for future occupation.\r\n\r\nMany of the minor phenomena, while common also to other areas of snow\r\nand ice, have fascination for the visitor. Snow-cups are always objects\r\nof interest and beauty. Instead of reducing a snow surface evenly, the\r\nwarm sun sometimes melts it in patterned cups set close together like\r\nthe squares of a checker-board. These deepen gradually till they suggest\r\na gigantic honeycomb, whose cells are sometimes several feet deep. In\r\none of these, one summer day in the Sierra, I saw a stumbling horse\r\ndeposit his rider, a high official of one of our Western railroads; and\r\nthere he sat helpless, hands and feet emerging from the top, until we\r\nrecovered enough from laughter to help him out.\r\n\r\nPink snow always arouses lively interest. A microscopic plant,\r\nProtococcus nivalis, growing in occasional patches beneath the surface\r\nof old snow gradually emerges with a pink glow which sometimes covers\r\nacres. On the tongue its flavor suggests watermelon. No doubt many other\r\nmicroscopic plants thrive in the snow-fields and glaciers which remain\r\ninvisible for lack of color. Insects also inhabit these glaciers. There\r\nare several Thysanura, which suggest the sand-fleas of our seashores,\r\nbut are seldom noticed because of their small size. More noticeable are\r\nthe Mesenchytraeus, a slender brown worm, which attains the length of an\r\ninch. They may be seen in great numbers on the lower glaciers in the\r\nsummer, but on warm days retreat well under the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary forest luxuriance at the base of Mount Rainier is due\r\nto moisture and climate. The same heavy snowfalls which feed the\r\nglaciers store up water-supplies for forest and meadow. The winters at\r\nthe base of the mountain are mild.\r\n\r\nThe lower valleys are covered with a dense growth of fir, hemlock, and\r\ncedar. Pushing skyward in competition for the sunlight, trees attain\r\ngreat heights. Protected from winter's severity by the thickness of the\r\ngrowth, and from fire by the dampness of the soil, great age is assured,\r\nwhich means thick and heavy trunks. The Douglas fir, easily the most\r\nimportant timber-tree of western America, here reaches its two hundred\r\nfeet in massive forests, while occasional individuals grow two hundred\r\nand fifty to two hundred and seventy feet with a diameter of eight feet.\r\nThe bark at the base of these monsters is sometimes ten inches thick.\r\nThe western hemlock also reaches equal heights in competition for the\r\nlight, with diameters of five feet or more. Red cedar, white pines of\r\nseveral varieties, several firs, and a variety of hemlocks complete the\r\nlist of conifers. Deciduous trees are few and not important.\r\nBroad-leaved maples, cottonwoods, and alders are the principal species.\r\n\r\nHigher up the mountain-slopes the forests thin and lessen in size, while\r\nincreasing in picturesqueness. The Douglas fir and other monsters of the\r\nlower levels disappear, their places taken by other species. At an\r\naltitude of four thousand feet the Englemann spruce and other\r\nmountain-trees begin to appear, not in the massed ranks of the lower\r\nlevels, but in groves bordering the flowered opens.\r\n\r\nThe extreme limit of tree growth on Mount Rainier is about seven\r\nthousand feet of altitude, above which one finds only occasional\r\ndistorted, wind-tortured mountain-hemlocks. There is no well-defined\r\ntimber-line, as on other lofty mountains. Avalanches and snow-slides\r\nkeep the upper levels swept and bare.\r\n\r\nThe wild-flower catalogue is too long to enumerate here. John Muir\r\nexpresses the belief that no other sub-alpine floral gardens excel\r\nRainier's in profusion and gorgeousness. The region differs little from\r\nother Pacific regions of similar altitude in variety of species; in\r\nluxuriance it is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAccording to Theodore Winthrop who visited the northwest in 1853 and\r\npublished a book entitled \"The Canoe and the Saddle,\" which had wide\r\nvogue at the time and is consulted to-day, Mount Rainier had its Indian\r\nRip Van Winkle. The story was told him in great detail by Hamitchou, \"a\r\nfrowsy ancient of the Squallyamish.\" The hero was a wise and wily\r\nfisherman and hunter. Also, as his passion was gain, he became an\r\nexcellent business man. He always had salmon and berries when food\r\nbecame scarce and prices high. Gradually he amassed large savings in\r\nhiaqua, the little perforated shell which was the most valued form of\r\nwampum, the Indian's money. The richer he got the stronger his passion\r\ngrew for hiaqua, and, when a spirit told him in a dream of vast hoards\r\nat the summit of Rainier, he determined to climb the mountain. The\r\nspirit was Tamanoues, which, Winthrop explains, is the vague Indian\r\npersonification of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nSo he threaded the forests and climbed the mountain's glistening side.\r\nAt the summit he looked over the rim into a large basin in the bottom of\r\nwhich was a black lake surrounded by purple rock. At the lake's eastern\r\nend stood three monuments. The first was as tall as a man and had a head\r\ncarved like a salmon; the second was the image of a camas-bulb; the two\r\nrepresented the great necessities of Indian life. The third was a stone\r\nelk's head with the antlers in velvet. At the foot of this monument he\r\ndug a hole.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a noise behind him caused him to turn. An otter clambered over\r\nthe edge of the lake and struck the snow with its tail. Eleven others\r\nfollowed. Each was twice as big as any otter he had ever seen; their\r\nchief was four times as big. The eleven sat themselves in a circle\r\naround him; the leader climbed upon the stone elk-head.\r\n\r\nAt first the treasure-seeker was abashed, but he had come to find hiaqua\r\nand he went on digging. At every thirteenth stroke the leader of the\r\notters tapped the stone elk with his tail, and the eleven followers\r\ntapped the snow with their tails. Once they all gathered closer and\r\nwhacked the digger good and hard with their tails, but, though\r\nastonished and badly bruised, he went on working. Presently he broke his\r\nelkhorn pick, but the biggest otter seized another in his teeth and\r\nhanded it to him.\r\n\r\nFinally his pick struck a flat rock with a hollow sound, and the otters\r\nall drew near and gazed into the hole, breathing excitedly. He lifted\r\nthe rock and under it found a cavity filled to the brim with pure-white\r\nhiaqua, every shell large, unbroken and beautiful. All were hung neatly\r\non strings.\r\n\r\nNever was treasure-quest so successful! The otters, recognizing him as\r\nthe favorite of Tamanoues, retired to a distance and gazed upon him\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n\"But the miser,\" writes the narrator, \"never dreamed of gratitude, never\r\nthought to hang a string from the buried treasure about the salmon and\r\ncamas tamanoues stones, and two strings around the elk's head; no, all\r\nmust be his own, all he could carry now, and the rest for the future.\"\r\n\r\nGreedily he loaded himself with the booty and laboriously climbed to the\r\nrim of the bowl prepared for the descent of the mountain. The otters,\r\npuffing in concert, plunged again into the lake, which at once\r\ndisappeared under a black cloud.\r\n\r\nStraightway a terrible storm arose through which the voice of Tamanoues\r\nscreamed tauntingly. Blackness closed around him. The din was horrible.\r\nTerrified, he threw back into the bowl behind him five strings of\r\nhiaqua to propitiate Tamanoues, and there followed a momentary lull,\r\nduring which he started homeward. But immediately the storm burst again\r\nwith roarings like ten thousand bears.\r\n\r\nNothing could be done but to throw back more hiaqua. Following each\r\nsacrifice came another lull, followed in turn by more terrible\r\noutbreaks. And so, string by string, he parted with all his gains. Then\r\nhe sank to the ground insensible.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke he lay under an arbutus-tree in a meadow of camas. He was\r\nshockingly stiff and every movement pained him. But he managed to gather\r\nand smoke some dry arbutus-leaves and eat a few camas-bulbs. He was\r\nastonished to find his hair very long and matted, and himself bent and\r\nfeeble. \"Tamanoues,\" he muttered. Nevertheless, he was calm and happy.\r\nStrangely, he did not regret his lost strings of hiaqua. Fear was gone\r\nand his heart was filled with love.\r\n\r\nSlowly and painfully he made his way home. Everything was strangely\r\naltered. Ancient trees grew where shrubs had grown four days before.\r\nCedars under whose shade he used to sleep lay rotting on the ground.\r\nWhere his lodge had stood now he saw a new and handsome lodge, and\r\npresently out of it came a very old decrepit squaw who, nevertheless,\r\nthrough her wrinkles, had a look that seemed strangely familiar to him.\r\nHer shoulders were hung thick with hiaqua strings. She bent over a pot\r\nof boiling salmon and crooned:\r\n\r\n  \"My old man has gone, gone, gone.\r\n  My old man to Tacoma has gone.\r\n  To hunt the elk he went long ago.\r\n  When will he come down, down, down\r\n  To salmon pot and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has come down,\" quavered the returned traveller, at last recognizing\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nHe asked no questions. Charging it all to the wrath of Tamanoues, he\r\naccepted fate as he found it. After all, it was a happy fate enough in\r\nthe end, for the old man became the Great Medicine-Man of his tribe, by\r\nwhom he was greatly revered.\r\n\r\nThe name of this Rip Van Winkle of Mount Rainier is not mentioned in Mr.\r\nWinthrop's narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nCRATER LAKE'S BOWL OF INDIGO\r\n\r\nCRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, SOUTHWESTERN OREGON. AREA, 249 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nCrater Lake is in southwestern Oregon among the Cascade Mountains, and\r\nis reached by an automobile ride of several hours from Medford. The\r\ngovernment information circular calls it \"the deepest and bluest lake in\r\nthe world.\" Advertising circulars praise it in choicest professional\r\nphrase. Its beauty is described as exceeding that of any other lake in\r\nall the world. Never was blue so wonderful as the blue of these waters;\r\nnever were waters so deep as its two thousand feet.\r\n\r\nLured by this eloquence the traveller goes to Crater Lake and finds it\r\nall as promised--in fact, far better than promised, for the best\r\nintended adjectives, even when winged by the energetic pen of the most\r\ntalented ad writer, cannot begin to convey the glowing, changing,\r\nmysterious loveliness of this lake of unbelievable beauty. In fact, the\r\ntourist, with expectation at fever-heat by the time he steps from the\r\nauto-stage upon the crater rim, is silenced as much by astonishment as\r\nby admiration.\r\n\r\nBefore him lies a crater of pale pearly lava several miles in diameter.\r\nA thousand feet below its rim is a lake whose farthest blues vie in\r\ndelicacy with the horizon lavas, and deepen as they approach till at\r\nhis feet they turn to almost black. There is nothing with which to\r\ncompare the near-by blue looked sharply down upon from Crater's rim. The\r\ndeepest indigo is nearest its intensity, but at certain angles falls far\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nNor is it only the color which affects him so strongly; its kind is\r\nsomething new, startling, and altogether lovely. Its surface, so\r\nmagically framed and tinted, is broken by fleeting silver wind-streaks\r\nhere and there; otherwise, it has the vast stillness which we associate\r\nwith the Grand Canyon and the sky at night. The lava walls are pearly,\r\nfaintly blue afar off, graying and daubed with many colors nearer by.\r\nPinks, purples, brick-reds, sulphurs, orange-yellows and many\r\nintermediates streak and splash the foreground gray. And often\r\npine-green forests fringe the rim, and funnel down sharply tilted\r\ncanyons to the water's edge; and sometimes shrubs of livelier green find\r\nfoothold on the gentler slopes, and, spreading, paint bright patches.\r\nOver all, shutting down and around it like a giant bowl, is a sky of\r\nCalifornian blue overhead softening to the pearl of the horizon. A\r\nwonder spectacle indeed!\r\n\r\nAnd then our tourist, recovering from his trance, walks upon the rim and\r\ndescends the trail to the water's edge to join a launch-party around the\r\nlake. Here he finds a new and different experience which is quite as\r\nsensational as that of his original discovery. Seen close by from the\r\nlake's surface these tinted lava cliffs are carved as grotesquely as a\r\nJapanese ivory. Precipices rise at times two thousand feet, sheer as a\r\nwall. Elsewhere gentle slopes of powdery lava, moss-tinted, connect rim\r\nand water with a ruler line. And between these two extremes are found\r\nevery fashion and kind and degree of lava wall, many of them\r\nprecipitous, most of them rugged, all of them contorted and carved in\r\nthe most fantastic manner that imagination can picture. Caves open their\r\ndark doors at water's edge. Towered rocks emerge from submerged reefs. A\r\nmimic volcano rises from the water near one side. Perpetual snow fills\r\nsheltered crevices in the southern rim.\r\n\r\nAnd all this wonder is reflected, upside down, in the still mirror\r\nthrough which the launch ploughs its rapid way. But looking backward\r\nwhere the inverted picture is broken and tossed by the waves from the\r\nlaunch's prow, he looks upon a kaleidoscope of color which he will\r\nremember all his life; for, to the gorgeous disarray of the broken image\r\nof the cliffs is added the magic tint of this deep-dyed water, every\r\nwavelet of which, at its crest, seems touched for the fraction of a\r\nsecond with a flash of indigo; the whole dancing, sparkling, shimmering\r\nin a glory which words cannot convey; and on the other side, and far\r\nastern, the subsiding waves calming back to normal in a flare of\r\nrobin's-egg blue.\r\n\r\nOur tourist returns to the rim-side hotel to the ceremony of sunset on\r\nCrater Lake, for which the lake abandons all traditions and clothes\r\nitself in gold and crimson. And in the morning after looking, before\r\nsunrise, upon a Crater Lake of hard-polished steel from which a falling\r\nrock would surely bounce and bound away as if on ice, he breakfasts and\r\nleaves without another look lest repetition dull his priceless memory of\r\nan emotional experience which, all in all, can never come again the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIt is as impossible to describe Crater Lake as it is to paint it. Its\r\noutlines may be photographed, but the photograph does not tell the\r\nstory. Its colors may be reproduced, but the reproduction is not Crater\r\nLake. More than any other spot I know, except the Grand Canyon from its\r\nrim, Crater Lake seems to convey a glory which is not of line or mass or\r\ncolor or composition, but which seems to be of the spirit. No doubt this\r\nvivid impression which the stilled observer seems to acquire with his\r\nmortal eye, is born somehow of his own emotion. Somehow he finds himself\r\nin communion with the Infinite. Perhaps it is this quality which seems\r\nso mysterious that made the Klamath Indians fear and shun Crater Lake,\r\njust as the Indians of the great plateau feared and shunned the Grand\r\nCanyon. It is this intangible, seemingly spiritual quality which makes\r\nthe lake impossible either to paint or to describe.\r\n\r\nSo different is this spectacle from anything else upon the continent\r\nthat the first question asked usually is how it came to be. The answer\r\ndiscloses one of the most dramatic incidents in the history of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of the Cascades, many have been the misadventures of\r\nvolcanoes. Some have been buried alive in ash and lava, and merged into\r\nconquering rivals. Some have been buried in ice which now, organized as\r\nglaciers, is wearing down their sides. Some have died of starvation and\r\npassed into the hills. Some have been blown to atoms. Only one in\r\nAmerica, so far as known, has returned into the seething gulf which gave\r\nit birth. That was Mount Mazama.\r\n\r\nThe processes of creation are too deliberate for human comprehension.\r\nThe Mississippi takes five thousand years to lower one inch its valley's\r\nsurface. The making of Glacier National Park required many--perhaps\r\nhundreds--of millions of years. It seems probable that the cataclysm in\r\nwhich Mount Mazama disappeared was exceptional; death may have come\r\nsuddenly, even as expressed in human terms.\r\n\r\nWhat happened seems to have been this. Some foundation underpinning gave\r\nway in the molten gulf below, and the vast mountain sank and disappeared\r\nwithin itself. Imagine the spectacle who can! Mount Mazama left a\r\nclean-cut rim surrounding the hole through which it slipped and\r\nvanished. But there was a surging back. The eruptive forces, rebounding,\r\npushed the shapeless mass again up the vast chimney. They found it too\r\nheavy a load. Deep within the ash-choked vent burst three small craters,\r\nand that was all. Two of these probably were short-lived, the third\r\nlasted a little longer. And, centuries later, spring water seeped\r\nthrough, creating Crater Lake.\r\n\r\nCrater Lake is set in the summit of the Cascade Range, about sixty-five\r\nmiles north of the California boundary. The road from the\r\nrailway-station at Medford leads eighty miles eastward up the\r\npicturesque volcanic valley of the Rogue River. The country is\r\nmagnificently forested. The mountains at this point are broad, gently\r\nrolling plateaus from which suddenly rise many volcanic cones, which,\r\nseen from elevated opens, are picturesque in the extreme. Each of these\r\ncones is the top of a volcano from whose summit has streamed the\r\nprehistoric floods of lava which have filled the intervening valleys,\r\nraising and levelling the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS-SECTION OF CRATER LAKE SHOWING PROBABLE OUTLINE OF\r\nMOUNT MAZAMA]\r\n\r\nEntering the park, a high, broad, forested elevation is quickly\r\nencountered which looks at a glance exactly what it is, the base which\r\nonce supported a towering cone. At its summit, this swelling base is\r\nfound to be the outside supporting wall of a roughly circular lake,\r\nabout five miles in diameter, the inside wall of which is steeply\r\ninclined to the water's surface a thousand feet below. The strong\r\ncontrast between the outer and inner walls tells a plainly read story.\r\nThe outer walls, all around, slope gently upward at an angle of about\r\nfifteen degrees; naturally, if carried on, they would converge in a\r\npeaked summit higher than that of Shasta. The inner walls converge\r\ndownward at a steep angle, suggesting a funnel of enormous depth. It was\r\nthrough this funnel that Mount Mazama, as men call the volcano that man\r\nnever saw, once collapsed into the gulf from which it had emerged.\r\n\r\nStudying the scene from the Lodge on the rim where the automobile-stage\r\nhas left you, the most vivid impressions of detail are those of the\r\nconformation of the inner rim, the cliffs which rise above it, and the\r\nsmall volcano which emerges from the blue waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous inner slope of the rim is not a continuous cliff, but a\r\nhighly diversified succession of strata. Examination shows the layers of\r\nvolcanic conglomerate and lava of which, like layers of brick and stone,\r\nthe great structure was built. The downward dip of these strata away\r\nfrom the lake is everywhere discernible. The volcano's early story thus\r\nlies plain to eyes trained to read it. The most interesting of these\r\nstrata is the lava flow which forms twelve thousand feet of the total\r\nprecipice of Llao Rock, a prominence of conspicuous beauty.\r\n\r\nMany of these cliffs are magnificently bold. The loftiest is Glacier\r\nPeak, which rises almost two thousand feet above the water's surface.\r\nBut Dutton Cliff is a close rival, and Vidae Cliff, Garfield Peak, Llao\r\nRock, and the Watchman fall close behind. Offsetting these are breaks\r\nwhere the rim drops within six hundred feet of the water. The statement\r\nof a wall height of a thousand feet expresses the general impression,\r\nthough as an average it is probably well short of the fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Scenic America Company_\r\n\r\nDUTTON CLIFF AND THE PHANTOM SHIP, CRATER LAKE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Scenic America Company_\r\n\r\nSUNSET FROM GARFIELD PEAK, CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS-SECTION OF CRATER LAKE]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of all the walls, at water's edge, lie slopes of talus, the\r\nrocky fragments which erosion has broken loose and dropped into the\r\nabyss. Nowhere is there a beach. The talus shallows the water for a few\r\nhundred feet, and descending streams build small deltas. These shallows\r\nedge the intense blue of the depths with exquisite lighter tints which\r\ntend to green. But this edging is very narrow.\r\n\r\nThe next most striking object after the gigantic carven cliffs is Wizard\r\nIsland. This complete volcano in miniature, notwithstanding that it is\r\nforest-clothed and rises from water, carries the traveller's mind\r\ninstantly to the thirteen similar cones which rise within the enormous\r\ndesert crater of dead Haleakala, in the Hawaii National Park. Wizard\r\nIsland's crater may easily be seen in the tip of its cone. Its two\r\nfellow volcanoes are invisible four hundred feet under water.\r\n\r\nScanning the blue surface, one's eye is caught by an interesting\r\nsail-like rock rising from the waters on the far right close to the foot\r\nof Dutton Cliff. This is the Phantom Ship. Seen two miles away in\r\ncertain lights the illusion is excellent. The masts seem to tilt\r\nrakishly and the sails shine in the sun. There are times when the\r\nPhantom Ship suddenly disappears, and times again when it as suddenly\r\nappears where nothing was before. Hence its name and mysterious repute.\r\nBut there is nothing really mysterious about this ghostly behavior,\r\nwhich occurs only when the heated atmosphere lends itself readily to\r\nmirage.\r\n\r\nDays and weeks of rare pleasure may be had in the exploration of these\r\namazing walls, a pleasure greatly to be enhanced by discovering and\r\nstudying the many plain evidences of Mazama's slow upbuilding and sudden\r\nextinction. The excellent automobile road around the rim affords easy\r\napproach afoot as well as by automobile and bicycle. Its passage is\r\nenlivened by many inspiring views of the outlying Cascades with their\r\ngreat forests of yellow pine and their lesser volcanic cones, some of\r\nwhich, within and without the park boundaries, hung upon the flanks of\r\nMount Mazama while it was belching flame and ash, while others, easing\r\nthe checked pressure following the great catastrophe, were formed anew\r\nor enlarged from older vents.\r\n\r\nFrom this road any part of the fantastic rim may be reached and\r\nexplored, often to the water's edge, by adventurous climbers. What more\r\nenjoyable day's outing, for instance, than the exploration of the\r\nsplendid pile of pentagonal basaltic columns suspended half-way in the\r\nrim at one point of picturesque beauty? What more inspiring than the\r\nclimbing of Dutton Cliff, or, for experienced climbers, of many of the\r\nstriking lava spires? The only drawback to these days of happy wandering\r\nalong this sculptured and painted rim is the necessity of carrying\r\ndrinking-water from the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThen there are days of pleasure on the water. Wizard Island may be\r\nthoroughly explored, with luncheon under its trees by the lakeside. The\r\nPhantom Ship's gnarled lavas may be examined and climbed. Everywhere the\r\nsteep rocky shore invites more intimate acquaintance; its caves may be\r\nentered, some afoot, at least one afloat. The lake is well stocked with\r\nrainbow trout, some of them descendants of the youngsters which Will G.\r\nSteel laboriously carried across country from Gordon's Ranch, forty-nine\r\nmiles away, in 1888. They are caught with the fly from shore and boat. A\r\npound trout in Crater Lake is a small trout. Occasionally a monster of\r\neight or ten pounds is carried up the trail to the Lodge.\r\n\r\nDuring all these days and weeks of pleasure and study, the vision of\r\nancient Mount Mazama and its terrible end grows more and more in the\r\nenlightened imagination. There is much in the conformation of the base\r\nto justify a rather definite picture of this lost brother of Hood,\r\nShasta, St. Helens, and Rainier. At the climax of his career, Mazama\r\nprobably rose sixteen thousand feet above the sea, which means ten\r\nthousand feet above the level of the present lake. We are justified too\r\nin imagining his end a cataclysm. Volcanic upbuildings are often\r\nspasmodic and slow, a series of impulses separated by centuries of\r\nquiescence, but their climaxes often are sudden and excessively violent.\r\nIt seems more probable that Mazama collapsed during violent eruption.\r\nPerhaps like a stroke of lightning at the moment of triumph, death came\r\nat the supreme climax of his career.\r\n\r\nCertainly no mausoleum was ever conceived for human hero which may be\r\ncompared for a moment with this glorified grave of dead Mazama!\r\n\r\nThe human history of Crater Lake has its interest. The Indians feared\r\nit. John W. Hillman was the first white man to see it. Early in 1853 a\r\nparty of Californian miners ascended the Rogue River to rediscover a\r\nlost gold-mine of fabulous richness. The expedition was secret, but\r\nseveral Oregonians who suspected its object and meant to be in at the\r\nfinding, quickly organized and followed. Hillman was of this party. The\r\nCalifornians soon learned of the pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" wrote Hillman half a century later, \"it was a game of hide and\r\nseek until rations on both sides got low. The Californians would push\r\nthrough the brush, scatter, double backward on their trail, and then\r\ncamp in the most inaccessible places to be found, and it sometimes\r\npuzzled us to locate and camp near enough to watch them.\"\r\n\r\nEventually the rivals united. A combination search-party was chosen\r\nwhich included Hillman, and this party, while it found no gold-mine,\r\nfound Crater Lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Fred H. Kiser_\r\n\r\nAPPLEGATE CLIFF, CRATER LAKE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Fred H. Kiser_\r\n\r\nPHANTOM SHIP FROM GARFIELD PEAK]\r\n\r\n\"While riding up a long sloping mountain,\" Hillman continued, \"we\r\nsuddenly came in sight of water and were very much surprised as we did\r\nnot expect to see any lakes. We did not know but what we had come in\r\nsight and close to Klamath Lake, and not until my mule stopped within a\r\nfew feet of the rim of Crater Lake did I look down, and if I had been\r\nriding a blind mule I firmly believe I would have ridden over the edge\r\nto death and destruction....\"\r\n\r\n\"The finding of Crater Lake,\" he concludes, \"was an accident, as we were\r\nnot looking for lakes; but the fact of my being the first upon its banks\r\nwas due to the fact that I was riding the best saddle mule in southern\r\nOregon, the property of Jimmy Dobson, a miner and packer with\r\nheadquarters at Jacksonville, who had furnished me the mule in\r\nconsideration of a claim to be taken in his name should we be\r\nsuccessful. Stranger to me than our discovery was the fact that after\r\nour return I could get no acknowledgment from any Indian, buck or squaw,\r\nold or young, that any such lake existed; each and every one denied any\r\nknowledge of it, or ignored the subject completely.\"\r\n\r\nThe next development in Crater's history introduces Will G. Steel,\r\nwidely known as \"the Father of Crater Lake National Park,\" a pioneer of\r\nthe highest type, a gold-seeker in the coast ranges and the Klondike, a\r\nschool-teacher for many years, and a public-spirited enthusiast. In\r\n1869, a farmer's boy in Kansas, he read a newspaper account of an Oregon\r\nlake with precipice sides five thousand feet deep. Moving to Oregon in\r\n1871, he kept making inquiries for seven years before he verified the\r\nfact of the lake's existence, and it was two years later before he found\r\na man who had seen it. This man's description decided him to visit it,\r\nthen an undertaking of some difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe got there in 1885. Standing on the rim he suggested to Professor\r\nJoseph Le Conte that an effort be made to induce the national government\r\nto save it from defacement and private exploitation. Returning home they\r\nprepared a petition to President Cleveland, who promptly withdrew ten\r\ntownships from settlement pending a bill before Congress to create a\r\nnational park. Congress refused to pass the bill on the ground that\r\nOregon should protect her own lake. Then Steel began an effort, or\r\nrather an unbroken succession of efforts, to interest Congress. For\r\nseventeen years he agitated the project at home, where he made speeches\r\nwinter and summer all over the State, and at Washington, which he\r\ndeluged with letters and circulars. Finally the bill was passed. Crater\r\nLake became a national park on May 22, 1902.\r\n\r\nMr. Steel's work was not finished. He now began just as vigorous a\r\ncampaign to have the lake properly stocked with trout. It required years\r\nbut succeeded. Then he began a campaign for funds to build a road to the\r\nlake. This was a stubborn struggle which carried him to Washington for a\r\nwinter, but it finally succeeded.\r\n\r\nDuring most of this time Mr. Steel was a country school-teacher without\r\nother personal income than his salary. He spent many of his summers\r\ntalking Crater-Lake projects to audiences in every part of the State,\r\ndepending upon his many friends for entertainment and for \"lifts\" from\r\ntown to town. He was superintendent of the park from 1913 to the winter\r\nof 1920, when he became United States commissioner for the park.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Indians toward Crater Lake remains to be told. Steel\r\nis authority for the statement that previous to 1886 no modern Indian\r\nhad looked upon its waters. Legends inherited from their ancestors made\r\nthem greatly fear it. I quote O.C. Applegate's \"Klamath Legend of La-o,\"\r\nfrom _Steel Points_ for January, 1907:\r\n\r\n\"According to the mythology of the Klamath and Modoc Indians, the chief\r\nspirit who occupied the mystic land of Gaywas, or Crater Lake, was La-o.\r\nUnder his control were many lesser spirits who appeared to be able to\r\nchange their forms at will. Many of these were monsters of various\r\nkinds, among them the giant crawfish (or dragon) who could, if he chose,\r\nreach up his mighty arms even to the tops of the cliffs and drag down to\r\nthe cold depths of Crater Lake any too venturesome tourist of the primal\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"The spirits or beings who were under the control of La-o assumed the\r\nforms of many animals of the present day when they chose to go abroad on\r\ndry land, and this was no less true of the other fabulous inhabitants of\r\nKlamath land who were dominated by other chief spirits, and who occupied\r\nseparate localities; all these forms, however, were largely or solely\r\nsubject to the will of Komookumps, the great spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Now on the north side of Mount Jackson, or La-o Yaina (La-o's\r\nMountain), the eastern escarpment of which is known as La-o Rock, is a\r\nsmooth field sloping a little toward the north which was a common\r\nplayground for the fabled inhabitants of Gaywas and neighboring\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n\"Skell was a mighty spirit whose realm was the Klamath Marsh country,\r\nhis capital being near the Yamsay River on the eastern side of the\r\nmarsh. He had many subjects who took the form of birds and beasts when\r\nabroad on the land, as the antelope, the bald eagle, the bliwas or\r\ngolden eagle, among them many of the most sagacious and active of all\r\nthe beings then upon the earth.\r\n\r\n\"A fierce war occurred between Skell and La-o and their followers, which\r\nraged for a long time. Finally Skell was stricken down in his own land\r\nof Yamsay and his heart was torn from his body and was carried in\r\ntriumph to La-o Yaina. Then a great gala day was declared and even the\r\nfollowers of Skell were allowed to take part in the games on Mount\r\nJackson, and the heart of Skell was tossed from hand to hand in the\r\ngreat ball game in which all participated.\r\n\r\n\"If the heart of Skell could be borne away so that it could be restored\r\nto his body he would live again, and so with a secret understanding\r\namong themselves the followers of Skell watched for the opportunity to\r\nbear it away. Eventually, when it reached the hands of Antelope, he\r\nsped away to the eastward like the wind. When nearly exhausted, he\r\npassed it on to Eagle, and he in turn to Bliwas, and so on, and although\r\nLa-o's followers pursued with their utmost speed, they failed to\r\novertake the swift bearers of the precious heart. At last they heard the\r\nfar-away voice of the dove, another of Skell's people, and then they\r\ngave up the useless pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"Skell's heart was restored and he lived again, but the war was not over\r\nand finally La-o was himself overpowered and slain and his bleeding body\r\nwas borne to the La-o Yaina, on the very verge of the great cliff, and a\r\nfalse message was conveyed to La-o's monsters in the lake that Skell had\r\nbeen killed instead of La-o, and, when a quarter of the body was thrown\r\nover, La-o's monsters devoured it thinking it a part of Skell's body.\r\nEach quarter was thrown over in turn with the same result, but when the\r\nhead was thrown into the lake the monsters recognized it as the head of\r\ntheir master and would not touch it, and so it remains to-day, an island\r\nin the lake, to all people now known as Wizard Island.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1885, at Fort Klamath, Steel obtained from Allen David, the\r\nwhite-headed chief of the Klamath Indians, the story of how the Indians\r\nreturned to Crater Lake. It was \"long before the white man appeared to\r\ndrive the native out.\" Several Klamaths while hunting were shocked to\r\nfind themselves on the lake rim, but, gazing upon its beauty, suddenly\r\nit was revealed to them that this was the home of the Great Spirit.\r\nThey silently left and camped far away. But one brave under the spell of\r\nthe lake returned, looked again, built his camp-fire and slept. The next\r\nnight he returned again, and still again. Each night strange voices\r\nwhich charmed him rose from the lake; mysterious noises filled the air.\r\nMoons waxed and waned. One day he climbed down to the water's edge,\r\nwhere he saw creatures \"like in all respects to Klamath Indians\"\r\ninhabiting the waters. Again and again he descended, bathed, and soon\r\nbegan to feel mysteriously strong, \"stronger than any Indian of his\r\ntribe because of his many visits to the waters.\"\r\n\r\nOthers perceiving his growing power ventured also to visit the lake,\r\nand, upon bathing in its waters also received strength.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion,\" said David solemnly, \"the brave who first visited the\r\nlake killed a monster, or fish, and was at once set upon by untold\r\nnumbers of excited Llaos (for such they were called), who carried him to\r\nthe top of the cliffs, cut his throat with a stone knife, then tore his\r\nbody into small pieces which were thrown down to the waters far beneath\r\nand devoured by angry Llaos.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1886 two Klamaths accompanied Captain Clarence E. Dutton's Geological\r\nSurvey party to Crater Lake and descended to the water's edge. The news\r\nof the successful adventure spread among the Indians, and others came to\r\nlook upon the forbidden spot. That was the beginning of the end of the\r\nsuperstition. Steel says that two hundred Klamaths camped upon the rim\r\nin 1896, while he was there with the Mazamas.\r\n\r\nThe lake was variously named by its early visitors. The Hillman party\r\nwhich discovered it named it Deep Blue Lake on the spot. Later it was\r\nknown as Lake Mystery, Lake Majesty, and Hole in the Ground. A party\r\nfrom Jacksonville named it Crater Lake on August 4, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nYELLOWSTONE, A VOLCANIC INTERLUDE\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYOMING, NORTHWESTERN WYOMING. AREA,\r\n3,348 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJohn Coulter's story of hot springs at the upper waters of the\r\nYellowstone River was laughed at by the public of 1810. Jim Bridger's\r\naccount of the geysers in the thirties made his national reputation as a\r\nliar. Warren Angus Ferris's description of the Upper Geyser Basin was\r\nreceived in 1842 in unbelieving silence. Later explorers who sought the\r\nYellowstone to test the truth of these tales thought it wholesome to\r\nkeep their findings to themselves, as magazines and newspapers refused\r\nto publish their accounts and lecturers were stoned in the streets as\r\nimpostors. It required the authority of the semiofficial\r\nWashburn-Langford expedition of 1869 to establish credence.\r\n\r\nThe original appeal of the Yellowstone, that to wonder, remains its most\r\npopular appeal to-day, though science has dissipated mystery these many\r\nyears. Many visitors, I am persuaded, enjoy the wonder of it more even\r\nthan the spectacle. I have heard people refuse to listen to the\r\nexplanation of geyser action lest it lessen their pleasure in Old\r\nFaithful. I confess to moods in which I want to see the blue flames and\r\nsmell the brimstone which Jim Bridger described so eloquently. There are\r\nplaces where it is not hard to imagine both.\r\n\r\nFor many years the uncanny wonders of a dying volcanic region absorbed\r\nthe public mind to the exclusion of all else in the Yellowstone\r\nneighborhood, which Congress, principally in consequence of these\r\nwonders, made a national park in 1872. Yet all the time it possessed two\r\nother elements of distinction which a later period regards as equal to\r\nthe volcanic phenomena; elements, in fact, of such distinction that\r\neither one alone, without the geysers, would have warranted the\r\nreservation of so striking a region for a national park. One of these is\r\nthe valley of the Yellowstone River with its spectacular waterfalls and\r\nits colorful canyon. The other is its population of wild animals which,\r\nin 1872, probably was as large and may have been larger than to-day's.\r\nYet little was heard of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone in those\r\ndays, although Moran's celebrated painting, now in the Capitol at\r\nWashington, helped influence Congress to make it a national park; and so\r\nlittle did the wild animals figure in the calculations of the period\r\nthat they were not even protected in the national park until 1894, when\r\nhunting had reduced the buffalo to twenty-five animals.\r\n\r\nEven in these days of enlightenment and appreciation the great majority\r\nof people think of the Yellowstone only as an area enclosing geysers.\r\nThere are tourists so possessed with this idea that they barely glance\r\nat the canyon in passing. I have heard tourists refuse to walk to\r\nInspiration Point because they had already looked over the rim at a\r\nconvenient and unimpressive place. Imagine coming two thousand miles to\r\nbalk at two miles and a half to the only spectacle of its kind in the\r\nworld and one of the world's great spectacles at that! As for the\r\nanimals, few indeed see any but the occasional bears that feed at the\r\nhotel dumps in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone National Park lies in the recesses of the Rocky\r\nMountains in northwestern Wyoming. It slightly overlaps Montana on the\r\nnorth and northwest, and Idaho on the southwest. It is rectangular, with\r\nan entrance about the middle of each side. It is the largest of the\r\nnational parks, enclosing 3,348 square miles. It occupies a high plain\r\ngirt with mountains. The Absarokas bound it on the east, their crest\r\ninvading the park at Mount Chittenden. The Gallatin Range pushes into\r\nthe northwestern corner from the north. The continental divide crosses\r\nthe southwestern corner over the lofty Madison Plateau and the ridge\r\nsouth of Yellowstone Lake. Altitudes are generally high. The plains\r\nrange from six to eight thousand feet; the mountains rise occasionally\r\nto ten thousand feet. South of the park the Pitchstone Plateau merges\r\ninto the foothills of the Teton Mountains, which, thirty miles south of\r\nthe southern boundary, rise precipitously seven thousand feet above the\r\ngeneral level of the country.\r\n\r\nThough occupying the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the region is not of\r\nthem. In no sense is it typical. The Rockies are essentially granite\r\nwhich was forced molten from the depths when, at the creation of this\r\nvast central mountain system, lateral pressures lifted the earth's skin\r\nhigh above sea-level, folded it, and finally eroded it along the crest\r\nof the folds. In this granite system the Yellowstone is a volcanic\r\ninterlude, and of much later date. It belongs in a general way to the\r\nimpulse of volcanic agitation which lighted vast beacons over three\r\nhundred thousand square miles of our northwest. The Cascade Mountains\r\nbelong in this grouping. Four national parks of to-day were then in the\r\nmaking, Mount Rainier in Washington, Crater Lake in Oregon, Lassen\r\nVolcanic in California, and the Yellowstone in Wyoming. Subterranean\r\nheat, remaining from those days of volcanic activity, to-day boils the\r\nwater which the geysers hurl in air.\r\n\r\nIn the northeastern part of the Yellowstone a large central crater was\r\nsurrounded by smaller volcanoes. You can easily trace the conformation\r\nfrom Mount Washburn which stood upon its southeastern rim, heaped there,\r\ndoubtless, by some explosion of more than common violence. This volcanic\r\nperiod was of long duration, perhaps hundreds of thousands of years. In\r\nthe northeastern part of the park the erosion of a hill has exposed the\r\npetrified remains of thirteen large forests in layers one on top of the\r\nother, the deep intervening spaces filled with thick deposits of ashes.\r\nThirteen consecutive times were great forests here smothered in the\r\nproducts of eruption. Thirteen times did years enough elapse between\r\neruptions for soil to make and forests to grow again, each perhaps of\r\nmany generations of great trees.\r\n\r\nYellowstone's mountains, then, are decayed volcanoes, its rock is lava,\r\nits soil is ash and disintegrated lava. The resulting outline is soft\r\nand waving, with a tendency to levels. There are no pinnacled heights,\r\nno stratified, minareted walls, no precipiced cirques and\r\nglacier-shrouded peaks. Yet glaciers visited the region. The large\r\ngranite boulder brought from afar and left near the west rim of the\r\nGrand Canyon with thousands of feet of rhyolite and other products of\r\nvolcanism beneath it is alone sufficient proof of that.\r\n\r\nBetween the periods from volcano to glacier and from glacier to to-day,\r\nstream erosion has performed its miracles. The volcanoes have been\r\nrounded and flattened, the plateaus have been built up and levelled, and\r\nthe canyons of the Yellowstone, Gibbon, and Madison Rivers have been\r\ndug. Vigorous as its landscape still remains, it has thus become the\r\nnatural playground for a multitude of people unaccustomed to the rigors\r\nof a powerfully accented mountain country.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, in spite of its poverty of peaks and precipices, the\r\nYellowstone country is one of the most varied and beautiful wildernesses\r\nin the world. Among national parks it gains rather than loses by its\r\ndifference. While easily penetrated, it is wild in the extreme, hinting\r\nof the prairies in its broad opens, pasture for thousands of wild\r\nruminants, and of the loftier mountains in its distant ranges, its\r\nisolated peaks and its groups of rugged, rolling summits. In the number,\r\nmagnitude, and variety of its waters it stands quite alone. It contains\r\nno less than three watersheds of importance, those of the Yellowstone,\r\nMadison, and Snake Rivers, flowing respectively north, west, and south.\r\nThe waters of the Yellowstone and Madison make it an important source of\r\nthe Missouri. There are minor rivers of importance in the park and\r\ninnumerable lesser streams. It is a network of waterways. Its waterfalls\r\nare many, and two of them are large and important. Its lakes are many,\r\nand several are large. Yellowstone Lake is the largest of its altitude\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nAs a wilderness, therefore, the Yellowstone is unequalled. Its\r\ninnumerable waters insure the luxuriance of its growths. Its forested\r\nparts are densely forested; its flower-gardens are unexcelled in range,\r\ncolor, and variety, and its meadows grow deep in many kinds of rich\r\ngrass. If it were only for the splendor of its wilderness, it still\r\nwould be worth the while. Imagine this wilderness heavily populated with\r\nfriendly wild animals, sprinkled with geysers, hot springs, mud\r\nvolcanoes, painted terraces and petrified groves, sensational with\r\nbreath-taking canyons and waterfalls, penetrable over hundreds of miles\r\nof well built road and several times the mileage of trails, and\r\ncomfortable because of its large hotels and public camps located\r\nconveniently for its enjoyment, and you have a pleasure-ground of\r\nextraordinary quality. Remember that one may camp out almost anywhere,\r\nand that all waters are trout waters. Yellowstone offers the best\r\nfishing easily accessible in the continent.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage possessed by the Yellowstone is a position near the\r\ncentre of the country among great railroad systems. The Northern Pacific\r\nreaches it on the north, the Burlington on the east, and the Union\r\nPacific on the west. One can take it coming or going between oceans; it\r\nis possible to buy tickets in by any one railroad and out by either of\r\nthe others. An elaborate system of automobile-coaches swings the\r\npassenger where he pleases, meeting all incoming trains and delivering\r\nat all outgoing trains. It is much easier now to see the Yellowstone\r\nthan in the much-vaunted stage-coach times previous to 1915, times\r\nsorely lamented by the romantic because their passing meant the passing\r\nof the picturesque old horse-drawn stage-coach from its last stand in\r\nthe United States; times when a tour of the Yellowstone meant six and a\r\nhalf days of slow, dusty travel, starting early and arriving late, with\r\na few minutes or hours at each \"sight\" for the soiled and exhausted\r\ntraveller to gape in ignorant wonder, watch in hand.\r\n\r\nTo-day one travels swiftly and comfortably in entire leisure, stopping\r\nat hotels or camps as he pleases, and staying at each as long as he\r\nlikes. The runs between the lingering places are now a pleasure. If\r\nhurried, one can now accomplish the stage-coach trip of the past in two\r\ndays, while the old six and a half days now means a leisurely and\r\ndelightful visit.\r\n\r\nWith the new order of travel began a new conception of the\r\nYellowstone's public usefulness. It ceased to be a museum of wonders and\r\nbegan to be a summer pleasure-ground. Instead of the fast\r\nautomobile-stage decreasing the average length of visit, the new idea\r\nwhich it embodied has lengthened it. This new idea is a natural\r\nevolution which began with the automobile and spread rapidly. The\r\nrailroads had been bringing tourists principally on transcontinental\r\nstop-overs. Automobiles brought people who came really to see the\r\nYellowstone, who stayed weeks at public camps to see it, or who brought\r\noutfits and camped out among its spectacles. The first Ford which\r\nentered the park on the morning of August 1, 1915, the day when private\r\ncars were first admitted, so loaded with tenting and cooking utensils\r\nthat the occupants scarcely could be seen, was the herald of the new and\r\ngreater Yellowstone. Those who laughed and those who groaned at sight of\r\nit, and there were both, were no seers; for that minute Yellowstone\r\nentered upon her destiny.\r\n\r\nThe road scheme is simple and effective. From each entrance a road leads\r\ninto an oblong loop road enclosing the centre of the park and touching\r\nthe principal points of scenic interest. This loop is connected across\r\nthe middle for convenience. From it several short roads push out to\r\nspecial spectacles, and a long road follows Lamar Creek through a\r\nnortheastern entrance to a mining town which has no other means of\r\ncommunication with the world outside. This is the road to Specimen\r\nRidge with its thirteen engulfed forests, to the buffalo range, and,\r\noutside the park boundaries, to the Grasshopper Glacier, in whose glassy\r\nembrace may be seen millions of grasshoppers which have lain in very\r\ncold storage indeed from an age before man. All are automobile roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe hot-water phenomena are scattered over a large area of the park. The\r\nMammoth Hot Springs at the northern entrance are the only active\r\nexamples of high terrace-building. The geysers are concentrated in three\r\nadjoining groups upon the middle-west side. But hot springs occur\r\neverywhere at widely separated points; a steam jet is seen emerging even\r\nfrom the depths of the Grand Canyon a thousand feet below the rim.\r\n\r\nThe traveller is never long allowed to forget, in the silent beauty of\r\nthe supreme wilderness, the park's uncanny nature. Suddenly encountered\r\ncolumns of steam rising from innocent meadows; occasional half-acres of\r\ndead and discolored brush emerging from hot and yellow mud-holes within\r\nthe glowing forest heart; an unexpected roaring hillside running with\r\nsmoking water; irregular agitated pools of gray, pink, or yellow mud,\r\nspitting, like a pot of porridge, explosive puffs of steam; the warm\r\nvaporing of a shallow in a cold forest-bound lake; a continuous violent\r\nbellowing from the depths of a ragged roadside hole which at intervals\r\nvomits noisily quantities of thick brown and purple liquid; occasional\r\ngroups of richly colored hot springs in an acre or more of dull yellows,\r\nthe whole steaming vehemently and interchanging the pinks and blues of\r\nits hot waters as the passing traveller changes his angle of\r\nvision--these and other uncouth phenomena in wide variety and frequent\r\nrepetition enliven the tourist's way. They are more numerous in geyser\r\nneighborhoods, but some of them are met singly, always with a little\r\nshock of surprise, in every part of the park.\r\n\r\nThe terrace-building springs in the north of the park engulf trees. The\r\nbulky growing mounds of white and gray deposit are edged with minutely\r\ncarven basins mounted upon elaborately fluted supports of ornate design,\r\nover whose many-colored edges flows a shimmer of hot water. Basin rises\r\nupon basin, tier upon tier, each in turn destined to clog and dry and\r\nmerge into the mass while new basins and new tiers form and grow and\r\nglow awhile upon their outer flank. The material, of course, is\r\nprecipitated by the water when it emerges from the earth's hot interior.\r\nThe vivid yellows and pinks and blues in which these terraces clothe\r\nthemselves upon warm days result from minute vegetable algae which thrive\r\nin the hot saturated lime-water but quickly die and fade to gray and\r\nshining white on drying. The height of some of these shapeless masses of\r\nterrace-built structures is surprising. But more surprising yet is the\r\nvividness of color assumed by the limpid springs in certain lights and\r\nat certain angles.\r\n\r\nClimbing the terraces at the expense of wet feet, one stands upon\r\nbroad, white, and occasionally very damp plateaus which steam vigorously\r\nin spots. These spots are irregularly circular and very shallow pools of\r\nhot water, some of which bubble industriously with a low, pleasant hum.\r\nThey are not boiling springs; the bubbling is caused by escaping gases;\r\nbut their waters are extremely hot. The intense color of some of these\r\npools varies or disappears with the changing angle of vision; the water\r\nitself is limpid.\r\n\r\nElsewhere throughout the park the innumerable hot springs seem to be\r\nless charged with depositable matter; elsewhere they build no terraces,\r\nbut bubble joyously up through bowls often many feet in depth and\r\ndiameter. Often they are inspiringly beautiful. The blue Morning Glory\r\nSpring is jewel-like rather than flower-like in its color quality, but\r\nits bowl remarkably resembles the flower which gives it name. Most\r\nsprings are gloriously green. Some are the sources of considerable\r\nstreams. Some stir slightly with the feeling rather than the appearance\r\nof life; others are perpetually agitated, several small springs\r\nbetraying their relationship to the geysers by a periodicity of\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is dry and the temperature low, the springs shoot thick\r\nvolumes of steam high in air. To the incomer by the north or west\r\nentrance who has yet to see a geyser, the first view of the Lower Geyser\r\nBasin brings a shock of astonishment no matter what his expectation. Let\r\nus hope it is a cool, bracing, breezy morning when the broad yellow\r\nplain emits hundreds of columns of heavy steam to unite in a\r\nwind-tossed cloud overlying and setting off the uncanny spectacle.\r\nSeveral geysers spout vehemently and one or more roaring vents bellow\r\nlike angry bulls in a nightmare. This is appropriately the introduction\r\nto the greater geyser basins which lie near by upon the south.\r\n\r\nWho shall describe the geysers? What pen, what brush, shall do justice\r\nto their ghostly glory, the eager vehemence of their assaults upon the\r\nsky, their joyful gush and roar, their insistence upon conscious\r\npersonality and power, the white majesty of their fluted columns at the\r\ninstant of fullest expansion, the supreme loveliness of their feathery\r\nflorescence at the level of poise between rise and fall, their\r\ngraciousness of form, their speedy airiness of action, their giant\r\nconvolutions of sun-flecked steam rolling aloft in ever-expanding volume\r\nto rejoin the parent cloud?\r\n\r\nPerhaps there have been greater geyser basins somewhere in the\r\nprehistoric past. There may be greater still to come; one or two\r\npromising possibilities are in Alaska. But for the lapse of geologic\r\ntime in which man has so far lived, Yellowstone has cornered the world's\r\ngeyser market. There are only two other places where one may enjoy the\r\nspectacle of large geysers. One of these is New Zealand and the other\r\nIceland; but both displays combined cannot equal Yellowstone's either in\r\nthe number or the size of the geysers.\r\n\r\nYellowstone has dozens of geysers of many kinds. They range in size from\r\nthe little spring that spurts a few inches every minute to the monster\r\nthat hurls hundreds of tons of water three hundred feet in air every six\r\nor eight weeks. Many spout at fairly regular intervals of minutes or\r\nhours or days. Others are notably irregular, and these include most of\r\nthe largest. Old Faithful won its name and reputation by its regularity;\r\nit is the only one of the group of monsters which lives up to its\r\ntime-table. Its period ranges from intervals of about fifty-five minutes\r\nin seasons following winters of heavy snow to eighty or eighty-five\r\nminutes in seasons following winters of light snow. Its eruptions are\r\nannounced in the Old Faithful Inn a few minutes in advance of action and\r\nthe population of the hotel walks out to see the spouting. At night a\r\nsearchlight is thrown upon the gushing flood.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Old Faithful is the most satisfactory of geysers. Several are\r\nmore imposing. Sometimes enthusiasts remain in the neighborhood for\r\nweeks waiting for the Giant to play and dare not venture far away for\r\nfear of missing the spectacle; while Old Faithful, which is quite as\r\nbeautiful and nearly as large, performs hourly for the pleasure of\r\nthousands. Even the most hurried visitor to the Upper Basin is sure,\r\nbetween stages, of seeing several geysers in addition to one or more\r\nperformances of Old Faithful.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of known geysers ceased playing in 1888. I have found no\r\nauthentic measurements or other stated records concerning the famous\r\nExcelsior. It hurled aloft an enormous volume of water, with a fury of\r\naction described as appalling. Posterity is fortunate in the existence\r\nof a striking photograph of this monster taken at the height of its play\r\nby F. Jay Haynes, then official photographer of the park.\r\n\r\n\"The first photographs I made were in the fall of 1881,\" Mr. Haynes\r\nwrites me. \"The eruptions continued during the winter at increasing\r\nintervals from two hours, when the series began, to four hours when it\r\nceased operations before the tourist season of 1882. Not having the\r\nmodern photographic plates for instantaneous work in 1881, it was\r\nimpossible to secure instantaneous views then, but in the spring of\r\n1888, I made the view which you write about. It was taken at the fulness\r\nof its eruption.\r\n\r\n\"The explosion was preceded by a rapid filling of the crater and a great\r\noverflow of water. The column was about fifty feet wide and came from\r\nthe centre of the crater. Pieces of formation were torn loose and were\r\nthrown out during each eruption; large quantities eventually were\r\nremoved from the crater, thus enlarging it to its present size.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have a witness's description of the process which clouds the\r\ncareer of the Excelsior Geyser. The enlargement of the vent eventually\r\ngave unrestrained passage to the imprisoned steam. The geyser ceased to\r\nplay. To-day the Excelsior Spring is one of the largest hot springs in\r\nthe Yellowstone and the world; its output of steaming water is constant\r\nand voluminous. Thus again we find relationship between the hot spring\r\nand the geyser; it is apparent that the same vent, except perhaps for\r\ndifferences of internal shaping, might serve for both. It was the\r\nremoval of restraining walls which changed the Excelsior Geyser to the\r\nExcelsior Spring.\r\n\r\nFor many years geyser action remained a mystery balanced among\r\nconflicting theories, of which at last Bunsen's won general acceptance.\r\nSpring waters, or surface waters seeping through porous lavas, gather\r\nthousands of feet below the surface in some pocket located in strata\r\nwhich internal pressures still keep hot. Boiling as they gather, the\r\nwaters rise till they fill the long vent-hole to the surface. Still the\r\nsteam keeps making in the deep pocket, where it is held down by the\r\nweight of the water in the vent above. As it accumulates this steam\r\ncompresses more and more. The result is inevitable. There comes a moment\r\nwhen the expansive power of the compressed steam overcomes the weight\r\nabove. Explosion follows. The steam, expanding now with violence, drives\r\nthe water up the vent and out; nor is it satisfied until the vent is\r\nemptied.\r\n\r\nUpon the surface, as the geyser lapses and dies, the people turn away to\r\nthe Inn and luncheon. Under the surface, again the waters gather and\r\nboil in preparation for the next eruption. The interval till then will\r\ndepend upon the amount of water which reaches the deep pocket, the size\r\nof the pocket, and the length and shape of the vent-hole. If conditions\r\npermit the upward escape of steam as fast as it makes in the pocket, we\r\nhave a hot spring. If the steam makes faster than it can escape, we have\r\na geyser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Haynes_\r\n\r\nTHE EXCELSIOR GEYSER WHICH BLEW OUT IN 1888; YELLOWSTONE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Haynes_\r\n\r\nONE OF THE TERRACES AT MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS; YELLOWSTONE]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSo interesting are the geysers and their kin that, with their splendid\r\nwilderness setting, other glories seem superfluous. I have had my\r\nmoments of impatience with the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone for being\r\nin the Yellowstone. Together, the canyon and the geysers are almost too\r\nmuch for one place, even perhaps for one visit. One can only hold so\r\nmuch, even of beauty, at once. Spectacles of this quality and quantity\r\nneed assimilation, and assimilation requires time. Nevertheless, once\r\nenter into sympathetic relations with the canyon, once find its heart\r\nand penetrate its secret, and the tables are quickly turned. Strangely,\r\nit now becomes quite easy to view with comparative coolness the claims\r\nof mere hot-water wonders.\r\n\r\nThe canyon cannot be considered apart from its river any more than a\r\ngeyser apart from its environment of hot spring and basin, and any\r\nconsideration of the Yellowstone River begins with its lake. As compared\r\nwith others of scenic celebrity, Yellowstone Lake is unremarkable. Its\r\nshores are so low and the mountains of its southern border so flat and\r\nunsuggestive that it curiously gives the impression of surface\r\naltitude--curiously because it actually has the altitude; its surface is\r\nmore than seven thousand seven hundred feet above tide. If I have the\r\nadvertisement right, it is the highest water in the world that floats a\r\nline of steamboats.\r\n\r\nThe lake is large, twenty miles north and south by fifteen miles east\r\nand west; it is irregular with deep indentations. It is heavily wooded\r\nto the water's edge. All its entering streams are small except the\r\nYellowstone River, which, from its source in the Absarokas just south of\r\nthe park boundary, enters the Southeast Arm through the lowland\r\nwilderness home of the moose and the wild buffalo. The lake is the\r\npopular resort of thousands of large white pelicans, its most\r\npicturesque feature.\r\n\r\nThat part of the Yellowstone River which interests us emerges from the\r\nlake at its most northerly point. It is here a broad swift stream of\r\nsome depth and great clarity, so swarming with trout that a half-dozen\r\nor more usually may be seen upon its bottom at any glance from boat or\r\nbridge. A number of boats usually are anchored above the bridge from\r\nwhich anglers are successfully trailing artificial flies and spinners in\r\nthe fast current; and the bridge is usually lined with anglers who, in\r\nspite of crude outfits, frequently hook good trout which they pull up by\r\nmain strength much as the phlegmatic patrons of excursion-steamers to\r\nthe Banks yank flopping cod from brine to basket on the top deck.\r\n\r\nThe last time I crossed the Fishing Bridge and paused to see the fun, a\r\nwoman whose face beamed with happiness held up a twenty-inch trout and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Just look! My husband caught this and he is seventy-six years old--last\r\nmonth. It's the first fish he ever caught, for he was brought up in\r\nKansas, you know, where there isn't any fishing. My! but he's a proud\r\nman! We're going to get the camp to cook it for us. He's gone now to\r\nlook for a board to draw its measurements to show the folks at home.\"\r\n\r\nFrom here to the river's emergence from the park the fishing is not\r\ncrude. In fact, it taxes the most skilful angler's art to steer his\r\nfighting trout through boiling rapids to the net. For very soon the\r\nYellowstone narrows and pitches down sharper slants to the climax of the\r\nfalls and the mighty canyon.\r\n\r\nThis intermediate stretch of river is beautiful in its quietude. The\r\nforests often touch the water's edge. And ever it narrows and deepens\r\nand splashes higher against the rocks which stem its current; forever it\r\nis steepening to the plunge. Above the Upper Fall it pinches almost to a\r\nmill-race, roars over low sills, swings eastward at right angles, and\r\nplunges a hundred and nine feet. I know of no cataract which expresses\r\nmight in action so eloquently as the Upper Fall of the Yellowstone.\r\nPressed as it is within narrow bounds, it seems to gush with other\r\nmotive power than merely gravity. Seen from above looking down, seen\r\nsideways from below, or looked at straight on from the camp site on the\r\nopposite rim, the water appears hurled from the brink.\r\n\r\nLess than a mile south of the Upper Fall, the river again falls, this\r\ntime into the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nImposing as the Great Fall is, it must chiefly be considered as a part\r\nof the Grand Canyon picture. The only separate view of it looks up from\r\nthe river's edge in front, a view which few get because of the difficult\r\nclimb; every other view poses it merely as an element in the canyon\r\ncomposition. Compared with the Upper Fall, its more than double height\r\ngives it the great superiority of majesty without detracting from the\r\nUpper Fall's gushing personality. In fact, it is the King of Falls.\r\nComparison with Yosemite's falls is impossible, so different are the\r\nelements and conditions. The Great Fall of the Yellowstone carries in\r\none body, perhaps, a greater bulk of water than all the Yosemite\r\nValley's falls combined.\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to the canyon. In figures it is roughly a thousand feet\r\ndeep and twice as wide, more or less, at the rim. The supremely scenic\r\npart reaches perhaps three miles below the Great Fall. Several rock\r\npoints extend far into the canyon, from which the gorgeous spectacle may\r\nbe viewed as from an aeroplane. Artists' Point, which is reached from\r\nthe east side, displays the Great Fall as the centre of a noble\r\ncomposition. It was Moran's choice. Inspiration Point, which juts far in\r\nfrom the west side, shows a deeper and more comprehensive view of the\r\ncanyon and only a glimpse of the Great Fall. Both views are essential to\r\nany adequate conception. From Artists' Point the eye loses detail in the\r\novermastering glory of the whole. From Inspiration Point the canyon\r\nreveals itself in all the intimacy of its sublime form and color. Both\r\nviews dazzle and astonish. Neither can be looked at very long at one\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Gifford_\r\n\r\nYELLOWSTONE VALLEY FROM THE UPPER FALL TO THE LOWER FALL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Gifford_\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER FALL AND THE GRAND CANYON OF THE YELLOWSTONE]\r\n\r\nIt will help comprehension of the picture quality of this remarkable\r\ncanyon to recall that it is carved out of the products of volcanism; its\r\npromontories and pinnacles are the knobbed and gnarled decomposition\r\nproducts of lava rocks left following erosion; its sides are gashed and\r\nfluted lava cliffs flanked by long straight slopes of coarse volcanic\r\nsand-like grains; its colors have the distinctness and occasional\r\nluridness which seem natural to fused and oxidized disintegrations.\r\nGeologically speaking, it is a young canyon. It is digging deeper all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nYellow, of course, is the prevailing color. Moran was right. His was the\r\ngeneral point of view, his message the dramatic ensemble. But, even from\r\nArtists' Point, closer looking reveals great masses of reds and grays,\r\nwhile Inspiration Point discloses a gorgeous palette daubed with most of\r\nthe colors and intermediate tints that imagination can suggest. I doubt\r\nwhether there is another such kaleidoscope in nature. There is\r\napparently every gray from purest white to dull black, every yellow from\r\nlemon to deep orange, every red, pink, and brown. These tints dye the\r\nrocks and sands in splashes and long transverse streaks which merge into\r\na single joyous exclamation in vivid color whose red and yellow accents\r\nhave something of the Oriental. Greens and blues are missing from the\r\ndyes, but are otherwise supplied. The canyon is edged with lodge-pole\r\nforests, and growths of lighter greens invade the sandy slants, at times\r\nnearly to the frothing river; and the river is a chain of emeralds and\r\npearls. Blue completes the color gamut from the inverted bowl of sky.\r\n\r\nNo sketch of the canyon is complete without the story of the great\r\nrobbery. I am not referring to the several hold-ups of the old\r\nstage-coach days, but to a robbery which occurred long before the coming\r\nof man--the theft of the waters of Yellowstone Lake; for this splendid\r\nriver, these noble falls, this incomparable canyon, are the ill-gotten\r\nproducts of the first of Yellowstone's hold-ups.\r\n\r\nOriginally Yellowstone Lake was a hundred and sixty feet higher and very\r\nmuch larger than it is to-day. It extended from the headwaters of the\r\npresent Yellowstone River, far in the south, northward past the present\r\nGreat Fall and Inspiration Point. It included a large part of what is\r\nnow known as the Hayden Valley. At that time the Continental Divide,\r\nwhich now cuts the southwest corner of the park, encircled the lake on\r\nits north, and just across the low divide was a small flat-lying stream\r\nwhich drained and still drains the volcanic slopes leading down from\r\nDunraven Peak and Mount Washburn.\r\n\r\nThis small stream, known as Sulphur Creek, has the honor, or the\r\ndishonor if you choose, of being the first desperado of the Yellowstone,\r\nbut one so much greater than its two petty imitators of human times that\r\nthere is no comparison of misdeeds. Sulphur Creek stole the lake from\r\nthe Snake River and used it to create the Yellowstone River, which in\r\nturn created the wonderful canyon. Here at last is a crime in which all\r\nwill agree that the end justified the means.\r\n\r\nHow this piracy was accomplished is written on the rocks; even the\r\nformer lake outlet into the Snake River is plainly discernible to-day.\r\nAt the lake's north end, where the seeping waters of Sulphur Creek and\r\nthe edge of the lake nearly met on opposite sides of what was then the\r\nlow flat divide, it only required some slight disturbance indirectly\r\nvolcanic, some unaccustomed rising of lake levels, perhaps merely some\r\nspecial stress of flood or storm to make the connection. Perhaps the\r\ncreek itself, sapping back in the soft lava soils, unaided found the\r\nlake. Connection once made, the mighty body of lake water speedily\r\ndeepened a channel northward and Sulphur Creek became sure of its\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nAt that time, hidden under the lake's surface, two rhyolite dikes, or\r\nupright walls of harder rock, extended crosswise through the lake more\r\nthan half a mile apart. As the lake-level fell, the nearer of these\r\ndikes emerged and divided the waters into two lakes, the upper of which\r\nemptied over the dike into the lower. This was the beginning of the\r\nGreat Fall. And presently, as the Great Fall cut its breach deeper and\r\ndeeper into the restraining dike, it lowered the upper-lake level until\r\npresently the other rhyolite dike emerged from the surface carrying\r\nanother cataract. And thus began the Upper Fall.\r\n\r\nMeantime the stream below kept digging deeper the canyon of Sulphur\r\nCreek, and there came a time when the lower lake drained wholly away.\r\nIn its place was left a bottom-land which is now a part of the Hayden\r\nValley, and, running through it, a river. Forthwith this river began\r\nscooping, from the Great Fall to Inspiration Point, the scenic ditch\r\nwhich is world-celebrated to-day as the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNow imagine this whole superlative wilderness heavily populated with\r\nwild animals in a state of normal living. Imagine thirty thousand elk,\r\nfor instance, roaming about in bands of half a dozen to half a thousand.\r\nImagine them not friendly, perhaps, but fearless, with that entire\r\nindifference which most animals show to creatures which neither help nor\r\nharm them--as indifferent, say, as the rabbits in your pasture or the\r\nsquirrels in your oak woods. Imagine all the wild animals, except the\r\nsneaking, predatory kind, proportionally plentiful and similarly\r\nfearless--bear, antelope, mountain-sheep, deer, bison, even moose in the\r\nfastnesses, to say nothing of the innumerable smaller beasts. There has\r\nbeen no hunting of harmless animals in the Yellowstone since 1894, and\r\nthis is one result.\r\n\r\nIt is true that comparatively few visitors see many animals, but that is\r\nthe fault of their haste or their temperament or their inexperience of\r\nnature. One must seek in sympathy to find. Tearing over the wilderness\r\nroads in noisy motors smelling of gasolene is not the best way to find\r\nthem, although the elk and deer became indifferent to automobiles as\r\nsoon as they discovered them harmless. One may see them not infrequently\r\nfrom automobiles and often from horse-drawn wagons; and one may see them\r\noften and intimately who walks or rides horseback on the trails.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the automobile to Yellowstone roads changed seeing\r\nconditions materially. In five days of quiet driving in 1914 with\r\nColonel L.M. Brett, then superintendent of the park, in a direction\r\nopposite to the stages, I saw more animals from my wagon-seat than I had\r\nexpected to see wild in all my life. We saw bear half a dozen times, elk\r\nin numbers, black-tailed and white-tailed deer so frequently that count\r\nwas lost the second morning, four bands of antelope, buffalo, foxes,\r\ncoyotes, and even a bull moose. Once we stopped so as not to hurry a\r\nlarge bear and two cubs which were leisurely crossing the road. Deer\r\nwatched us pass within a hundred yards. Elk grazed at close quarters,\r\nand our one bull moose obligingly ambled ahead of us along the road.\r\nThere was never fear, never excitement (except my own), not even haste.\r\nEven the accustomed horses no more than cocked an ear or two while\r\nwaiting for three wild bears to get out of the middle of the road.\r\n\r\nOf course scenic completeness is enough in itself to justify the\r\nexistence of these animals in the marvellous wilderness of the\r\nYellowstone. Their presence in normal abundance and their calm\r\nat-homeness perfects nature's spectacle. In this respect, also,\r\nYellowstone's unique place among the national parks is secure.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of the Yellowstone are plain. It is now too late to restore\r\nelsewhere the great natural possession which the thoughtless savagery of\r\na former generation destroyed in careless ruth, but, thanks to this\r\nearly impulse of conservation, a fine example still remains in the\r\nYellowstone. But it is not too late to obliterate wholly certain\r\nmisconceptions by which that savagery was then justified. It is not too\r\nlate to look upon wild animals as fellow heritors of the earth,\r\npossessing certain natural rights which men are glad rather than bound\r\nto respect. It is not too late to consider them, with birds and forests,\r\nlakes, rivers, seas, and skies, a part of nature's glorious gift for\r\nman's manifold satisfaction, a gift to carefully conserve for the study\r\nand enjoyment of to-day, and to develop for the uses of larger and more\r\nappreciative generations to come.\r\n\r\nOf course if this be brought to universal accomplishment (and the\r\nimpulse has been advancing fast of late), it must be Yellowstone's part\r\nto furnish the exhibit, for we have no other.\r\n\r\nTo many the most surprising part of Yellowstone's wild-animal message is\r\nman's immunity from hatred and harm by predatory beasts. To know that\r\nwild bears if kindly treated are not only harmless but friendly, that\r\ngrizzlies will not attack except in self-defense, and that wolves, wild\r\ncats, and mountain-lions fly with that instinctive dread which is man's\r\ndependable protection, may destroy certain romantic illusions of youth\r\nand discredit the observation if not the conscious verity of many an\r\nhonest hunter; but it imparts a modern scientific fact which sets the\r\nwhole wild-animal question in a new light. In every case of assault by\r\nbears where complete evidence has been obtainable, the United States\r\nBiological Survey, after fullest investigation, has exonerated the bear;\r\nhe has always been attacked or has had reason to believe himself\r\nattacked. In more than thirty summers of field-work Vernon Bailey, Chief\r\nField-Naturalist of the Biological Survey, has slept on the ground\r\nwithout fires or other protection, and frequently in the morning found\r\ntracks of investigating predatory beasts. There are reports but no\r\nrecords of human beings killed by wolves or mountain-lions in America.\r\nYet, for years, all reports susceptible of proof have been officially\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nOne of Yellowstone's several manifest destinies is to become the\r\nwell-patronized American school of wild-life study. Already, from its\r\nabundance, it is supplying wild animals to help in the long and\r\ndifficult task of restoring here and there, to national parks and other\r\nfavorable localities, stocks which existed before the great slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThirty miles south of this rolling volcanic interlude the pristine\r\nRockies, as if in shame of their moment of gorgeous softness, rear in\r\ncontrast their sharpest and most heroic monument of bristling granite.\r\nScarcely over the park's southern boundary, the foothills of the Teton\r\nMountains swell gently toward their Gothic climax. The country opens and\r\nroughens. The excellent road, which makes Jackson's Hole a practical\r\npart of the Yellowstone pleasure-ground, winds through a rolling, partly\r\nwooded grazing-ground of elk and deer. The time was when these wild\r\nherds made living possible for the nation's hunted desperadoes, for\r\nJackson's Hole was the last refuge to yield to law and order.\r\n\r\nAt the climax of this sudden granite protest, the Grand Teton rises\r\n7,014 feet in seeming sheerness from Jackson Lake to its total altitude\r\nof 13,747 feet. To its right is Mount Moran, a monster only less. The\r\nothers, clustering around them, have no names.\r\n\r\nAll together, they are few and grouped like the units of some fabulous\r\nbarbaric stronghold. Fitted by size and majesty to be the climax of a\r\nmighty range, the Tetons concentrate their all in this one giant group.\r\nQuickly, north and south, they subside and pass. They are a granite\r\nisland in a sea of plain.\r\n\r\nSeen across the lake a dozen miles which seem but three, these clustered\r\nsteepled temples rise sheer from the water. Their flanks are\r\nsnow-streaked still in August, their shoulders hung with glaciers, their\r\nspires bare and shining. A greater contrast to the land from which we\r\ncame and to which we presently return cannot be imagined. Geologically,\r\nthe two have nothing in common. Scenically, the Tetons set off and\r\ncomplete the spectacle of the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Charles D. Walcott_\r\n\r\nTHE TETON MOUNTAIN FROM JACKSON HOLE, SOUTH OF YELLOWSTONE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Haynes_\r\n\r\nTHE LAVA LANDSCAPE OF THE YELLOWSTONE AND GIBBON FALLS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHREE MONSTERS OF HAWAII\r\n\r\nHAWAII NATIONAL PARK, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. AREA, 118 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this chapter is confined to the three volcano tops which Congress\r\nreserved on the islands of Hawaii and Maui in 1917, wonderful though\r\nthese are, it will describe a small part indeed of the wide range of\r\nnovelty, charm, and beauty which will fall to the lot of those who visit\r\nthe Hawaii National Park. One of the great advantages enjoyed by this\r\nnational park, as indeed by Mount McKinley's, is its location in a\r\nsurrounding of entire novelty, so that in addition to the object of his\r\nvisit, itself so supremely worth while, the traveller has also the\r\npleasure of a trip abroad.\r\n\r\nIn novelty at least the Hawaii National Park has the advantage over the\r\nAlaskan park because it involves the life and scenery of the tropics. We\r\ncan find snow-crowned mountains and winding glaciers at home, but not\r\nequatorial jungles, sandalwood groves, and surf-riding.\r\n\r\nEnormous as this element of charm unquestionably is, this is not the\r\nplace to sing the pleasures of the Hawaiian Islands. Their palm-fringed\r\nhorizons, surf-edged coral reefs, tropical forests and gardens,\r\nplantations of pineapple and sugar-cane are as celebrated as their\r\nrainbows, earthquakes, and graceful girls dancing under tropical stars\r\nto the languorous ukelele.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF HAWAII NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\nLeaving these and kindred spectacles to the steamship circulars and the\r\nlibrary shelf, it is our part to note that the Hawaii National Park\r\npossesses the fourth largest volcanic crater in the world, whose aspect\r\nat sunrise is one of the world's famous spectacles, the largest active\r\nvolcano in the world, and a lake of turbulent, glowing, molten lava,\r\n\"the House of Everlasting Fire,\" which fills the beholder with awe.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all, then, the gentle poetic aspects of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands which led Congress to create a national park there, though these\r\nform its romantic, contrasted setting. It was the extraordinary volcanic\r\nexhibit, that combination of thrilling spectacles of Nature's colossal\r\npower which for years have drawn travellers from the four quarters of\r\nthe earth. The Hawaii National Park includes the summits of Haleakala,\r\non the island of Maui, and Mauna Loa and Kilauea, on the island of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\nSpain claims the discovery of these delectable isles by Juan Gaetano, in\r\n1555, but their formal discovery and exploration fell to the lot of\r\nCaptain James Cook, in 1778. The Hawaiians thought him a god and loaded\r\nhim with the treasures of the islands, but on his return the following\r\nyear his illness and the conduct of his crew ashore disillusioned them;\r\nthey killed him and burned his flesh, but their priests deified his\r\nbones, nevertheless. Parts of these were recovered later and a monument\r\nwas erected over them. Then civil wars raged until all the tribes were\r\nconquered, at the end of the eighteenth century, by one chieftain,\r\nKamehameha, who became king. His descendants reigned until 1874 when,\r\nthe old royal line dying out, Kalakaua was elected his successor.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the end hastened. A treaty with the United States ceded\r\nPearl Harbor as a coaling-station and entered American goods free of\r\nduty, in return for which Hawaiian sugar and a few other products\r\nentered the United States free. This established the sugar industry on\r\na large and permanent scale and brought laborers from China, Japan, the\r\nAzores, and Madeira. More than ten thousand Portuguese migrated to the\r\nislands, and the native population began a comparative decrease which\r\nstill continues.\r\n\r\nAfter Kalakaua's death, his sister Liliuokalani succeeding him in 1891,\r\nthe drift to the United States became rapid. When President Cleveland\r\nrefused to annex the islands, a republic was formed in 1894, but the\r\ndanger from Japanese immigration became so imminent that in 1898, during\r\nthe Spanish-American War, President McKinley yielded to the Hawaiian\r\nrequest and the islands were annexed to the United States by resolution\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe setting for the picture of our island-park will be complete with\r\nseveral facts about its physical origin. The Hawaiian Islands rose from\r\nthe sea in a series of volcanic eruptions. Originally, doubtless, the\r\ngreater islands were simple cones emitting lava, ash, and smoke, which\r\ncoral growths afterward enlarged and enriched. Kauai was the first to\r\ndevelop habitable conditions, and the island southeast of it followed in\r\norder. Eight of the twelve are now habitable.\r\n\r\nThe most eastern island of the group is Hawaii. It is also much the\r\nlargest. This has three volcanoes. Mauna Loa, greatest of the three, and\r\nalso the greatest volcanic mass in the world, is nearly the centre of\r\nthe island; Kilauea lies a few miles east of it; the summits of both are\r\nincluded in the national park. Mauna Kea, a volcanic cone of great\r\nbeauty in the north centre of the island, forming a triangle with the\r\nother two, is not a part of the national park.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Hawaii across sixty miles or more of salt water is the\r\nisland of Maui, second largest of the group. In its southern part rises\r\nthe distinguished volcano of Haleakala, whose summit and world-famous\r\ncrater is the third member of the national park. The other habited\r\nislands, in order westward, are Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai,\r\nand Niihau; no portions of these are included in the park. Kahoolawe,\r\nLanai, and Niihau are much the smallest of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALEAKALA\r\n\r\nOf the three volcanic summits which concern us, Haleakala is nearest the\r\nprincipal port of Honolulu, though not always the first visited. Its\r\nslopes nearly fill the southern half of the island of Maui.\r\n\r\nThe popular translation of the name Haleakala is \"The House of the Sun\";\r\nliterally the word means \"The House Built by the Sun.\" The volcano is a\r\nmonster of more than ten thousand feet, which bears upon its summit a\r\ncrater of a size and beauty that make it one of the world's show-places.\r\nThis crater is seven and a half miles long by two and a third miles\r\nwide. Only three known craters exceed Haleakala's in size. Aso san, the\r\nmonster crater of Japan, largest by far in the world, is fourteen miles\r\nlong by ten wide and contains many farms. Lago di Bolseno, in Italy,\r\nnext in size, measures eight and a half by seven and a half miles; and\r\nMonte Albano, also in Italy, eight by seven miles.\r\n\r\nExchanging your automobile for a saddle-horse at the volcano's foot, you\r\nspend the afternoon in the ascent. Wonderful indeed, looking back, is\r\nthe growing arc of plantation and sea, islands growing upon the horizon,\r\nMauna Kea and Mauna Loa lifting distant snow-tipped peaks. You spend the\r\nnight in a rest-house on the rim of the crater, but not until you have\r\nseen the spectacle of sunset; and in the gray of the morning you are\r\nsummoned to the supreme spectacle of sunrise. Thousands have crossed\r\nseas for Haleakala's sunrise.\r\n\r\nThat first view of the crater from the rim is one never to be forgotten.\r\nIts floor lies two thousand feet below, an enormous rainless, rolling\r\nplain from which rise thirteen volcanic cones, clean-cut, as regular in\r\nform as carven things. Several of these are seven hundred feet in\r\nheight. \"It must have been awe-inspiring,\" writes Castle, \"when its\r\ncones were spouting fire, and rivers of scarlet molten lava crawled\r\nalong the floor.\"\r\n\r\nThe stillness of this spot emphasizes its emotional effect. A word\r\nspoken ordinarily loud is like a shout. You can hear the footsteps of\r\nthe goats far down upon the crater floor. Upon this floor grow plants\r\nknown nowhere else; they are famous under the name of Silver\r\nSwords--yucca-like growths three or four feet high whose drooping\r\nfilaments of bloom gleam like polished silver stilettos.\r\n\r\nWhen Mark Twain saw the crater, \"vagrant white clouds came drifting\r\nalong, high over the sea and valley; then they came in couples and\r\ngroups; then in imposing squadrons; gradually joining their forces, they\r\nbanked themselves solidly together a thousand feet under us and totally\r\nshut out land and ocean; not a vestige of anything was left in view, but\r\njust a little of the rim of the crater circling away from the pinnacle\r\nwhereon we sat, for a ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy\r\nhosts without had drifted through a chasm in the crater wall and filed\r\nround and round, and gathered and sunk and blended together till the\r\nabyss was stored to the brim with a fleecy fog. Thus banked, motion\r\nceased, and silence reigned. Clear to the horizon, league on league, the\r\nsnowy folds, with shallow creases between, and with here and there\r\nstately piles of vapory architecture lifting themselves aloft out of the\r\ncommon plain--some near at hand, some in the middle distances, and\r\nothers relieving the monotony of the remote solitudes. There was little\r\nconversation, for the impressive scene overawed speech. I felt like the\r\nLast Man, neglected of the judgment, and left pinnacled in mid-heaven, a\r\nforgotten relic of a vanished world.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary perfection of this desert crater is probably due to\r\ntwo causes. Vents which tapped it far down the volcano's flanks\r\nprevented its filling with molten lava; absence of rain has preserved\r\nits walls intact and saved its pristine beauty from the defacement of\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nHaleakala has its legend, and this Jack London has sifted to its\r\nelements and given us in \"The Cruise of the _Snark_.\" I quote:\r\n\r\n\"It is told that long ago, one Maui, the son of Hina, lived on what is\r\nnow known as West Maui. His mother, Hina, employed her time in the\r\nmaking of kapas. She must have made them at night, for her days were\r\noccupied in trying to dry the kapas. Each morning, and all morning, she\r\ntoiled at spreading them out in the sun. But no sooner were they out\r\nthan she began taking them in in order to have them all under shelter\r\nfor the night. For know that the days were shorter then than now. Maui\r\nwatched his mother's futile toil and felt sorry for her. He decided to\r\ndo something--oh, no, not to help her hang out and take in the kapas. He\r\nwas too clever for that. His idea was to make the sun go slower. Perhaps\r\nhe was the first Hawaiian astronomer. At any rate, he took a series of\r\nobservations of the sun from various parts of the island. His conclusion\r\nwas that the sun's path was directly across Haleakala. Unlike Joshua, he\r\nstood in no need of divine assistance. He gathered a huge quantity of\r\ncocoanuts, from the fibre of which he braided a stout cord, and in one\r\nend of which he made a noose, even as the cowboys of Haleakala do to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n\"Next he climbed into the House of the Sun. When the sun came tearing\r\nalong the path, bent on completing its journey in the shortest time\r\npossible, the valiant youth threw his lariat around one of the sun's\r\nlargest and strongest beams. He made the sun slow down some; also, he\r\nbroke the beam short off. And he kept on roping and breaking off beams\r\ntill the sun said it was willing to listen to reason. Maui set forth his\r\nterms of peace, which the sun accepted, agreeing to go more slowly\r\nthereafter. Wherefore Hina had ample time in which to dry her kapas, and\r\nthe days are longer than they used to be, which last is quite in accord\r\nwith the teachings of modern astronomy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUNA LOA\r\n\r\nSixty miles south of Maui, Hawaii, largest of the island group, contains\r\nthe two remaining parts of our national park. From every point of view\r\nMauna Loa and Mauna Kea, both snow-crowned monsters approaching fourteen\r\nthousand feet of altitude, dominate the island. But Mauna Kea is not a\r\npart of the national park; Kilauea, of less than a third its height,\r\nshares that honor with Mauna Loa. Of the two, Kilauea is much the older,\r\nand doubtless was a conspicuous figure in the old landscape. It has been\r\nlargely absorbed in the immense swelling bulk of Mauna Loa, which,\r\nspringing later from the island soil near by, no doubt diverting\r\nKilauea's vents far below sea-level, has sprawled over many miles. So\r\nnearly has the younger absorbed the older, that Kilauea's famous pit of\r\nmolten lava seems almost to lie upon Mauna Loa's slope.\r\n\r\nMauna Loa soars 13,675 feet. Its snowy dome shares with Mauna Kea,\r\nwhich rises even higher, the summit honors of the islands. From Hilo,\r\nthe principal port of the island of Hawaii, Mauna Loa suggests the back\r\nof a leviathan, its body hidden in the mists. The way up, through\r\nforests of ancient mahogany and tangles of giant tree-fern, then up many\r\nmiles of lava slopes, is one of the inspiring tours in the mountain\r\nworld. The summit crater, Mokuaweoweo, three-quarters of a mile long by\r\na quarter mile wide, is as spectacular in action as that of Kilauea.\r\n\r\nThis enormous volcanic mass has grown of its own output in comparatively\r\na short time. For many decades it has been extraordinarily frequent in\r\neruption. Every five or ten years it gets into action with violence,\r\nsometimes at the summit, oftener of recent years since the central vent\r\nhas lengthened, at weakened places on its sides. Few volcanoes have been\r\nso regularly and systematically studied.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILAUEA\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular exhibit of the Hawaii National Park is the lake of\r\nfire in the crater of Kilauea.\r\n\r\nKilauea is unusual among volcanoes. It follows few of the popular\r\nconceptions. Older than the towering Mauna Loa, its height is only four\r\nthousand feet. Its lavas have found vents through its flanks, which they\r\nhave broadened and flattened. Doubtless its own lavas have helped Mauna\r\nLoa's to merge the two mountains into one. It is no longer explosive\r\nlike the usual volcano; since 1790, when it destroyed a native army, it\r\nhas ejected neither rocks nor ashes. Its crater is no longer definitely\r\nbowl-shaped. From the middle of a broad flat plain, which really is what\r\nis left of the ancient great crater, drops a pit with vertical sides\r\nwithin which boil its lavas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by E.M. Newman_\r\n\r\nTHE KILAUEA PIT OF FIRE, HAWAII NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nPhotographed at night by the light of its flaming lava]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Newman Travel Talks and\r\nBrown and Dawson_\r\n\r\nWITHIN THE CRATER OF KILAUEA]\r\n\r\nThe pit, the lake of fire, is Halemaumau, commonly translated \"The\r\nHouse of Everlasting Fire\"; the correct translation is \"The House of the\r\nMaumau Fern,\" whose leaf is twisted and contorted like some forms of\r\nlava. Two miles and a little more from Halemaumau, on a part of the\r\nancient crater wall, stands the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, which is\r\nunder the control of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The\r\nobservatory was built for the special purpose of studying the pit of\r\nfire, the risings and fallings of whose lavas bear a relationship toward\r\nthe volcanism of Mauna Loa which is scientifically important, but which\r\nwe need not discuss here.\r\n\r\nThe traveller enters Hawaii by steamer through Hilo. He reaches the rim\r\nof Kilauea by automobile, an inspiring run of thirty-one miles over a\r\nroad of volcanic glass, bordered with vegetation strange to eyes\r\naccustomed only to that of the temperate zone--brilliant hibiscus,\r\nnative hardwood trees with feathery pompons for blossoms, and the giant\r\nferns which tower overhead. On the rim are the hotels and the\r\nobservatory. Steam-jets emerge at intervals, and hot sulphur banks\r\nexhibit rich yellows. From there the way descends to the floor of the\r\ncrater and unrolls a ribbon of flower-bordered road seven miles long to\r\nthe pit of fire. By trail, the distance is only two miles and a half\r\nacross long stretches of hard lava congealed in ropes and ripples and\r\nstrange contortions. Where else is a spectacle one-tenth as appalling so\r\ncomfortably and quickly reached?\r\n\r\nHalemaumau is an irregular pit a thousand feet long with perpendicular\r\nsides. Its depth varies. Sometimes one looks hundreds of feet down to\r\nthe boiling surface; sometimes its lavas overrun the top. The fumes of\r\nsulphur are very strong, with the wind in your face. At these times,\r\ntoo, the air is extremely hot. There are cracks in the surrounding lava\r\nwhere you can scorch paper or cook a beefsteak.\r\n\r\nMany have been the attempts to describe it. Not having seen it myself, I\r\nquote two here; one a careful picture by a close student of the\r\nspectacle, Mr. William R. Castle, Jr., of Honolulu; the other a rapid\r\nsketch by Mark Twain.\r\n\r\n\"By daylight,\" writes Castle, \"the lake of fire is a greenish-yellow,\r\ncut with ragged cracks of red that look like pale streaks of stationary\r\nlightning across its surface. It is restless, breathing rapidly,\r\nbubbling up at one point and sinking down in another; throwing up sudden\r\nfountains of scarlet molten lava that play a few minutes and subside,\r\nleaving shimmering mounds which gradually settle to the level surface of\r\nthe lake, turning brown and yellow as they sink.\r\n\r\n\"But as the daylight fades the fires of the pit shine more brightly.\r\nMauna Loa, behind, becomes a pale, gray-blue, insubstantial dome, and\r\noverhead stars begin to appear. As darkness comes the colors on the\r\nlake grow so intense that they almost hurt. The fire is not only red; it\r\nis blue and purple and orange and green. Blue flames shimmer and dart\r\nabout the edges of the pit, back and forth across the surface of the\r\nrestless mass. Sudden fountains paint blood-red the great plume of\r\nsulphur smoke that rises constantly, to drift away across the poisoned\r\ndesert of Kau. Sometimes the spurts of lava are so violent, so\r\nexaggerated by the night, that one draws back terrified lest some atom\r\nof their molten substance should spatter over the edge of the precipice.\r\nSometimes the whole lake is in motion. Waves of fire toss and battle\r\nwith each other and dash in clouds of bright vermilion spray against the\r\nblack sides of the pit. Sometimes one of these sides falls in with a\r\nroar that echoes back and forth, and mighty rocks are swallowed in the\r\nliquid mass of fire that closes over them in a whirlpool, like water\r\nover a sinking ship.\r\n\r\n\"Again everything is quiet, a thick scum forms over the surface of the\r\nlake, dead, like the scum on the surface of a lonely forest pool. Then\r\nit shivers. Flashes of fire dart from side to side. The centre bursts\r\nopen and a huge fountain of lava twenty feet thick and fifty high,\r\nstreams into the air and plays for several minutes, waves of blinding\r\nfire flowing out from it, dashing against the sides until the black\r\nrocks are starred all over with bits of scarlet. To the spectator there\r\nis, through it all, no sense of fear. So intense, so tremendous is the\r\nspectacle that silly little human feelings find no place. All\r\nsensations are submerged in a sense of awe.\"\r\n\r\nMark Twain gazed into Halemaumau's terrifying depths. \"It looked,\" he\r\nwrites, \"like a colossal railroad-map of the State of Massachusetts done\r\nin chain lightning on a midnight sky. Imagine it--imagine a coal-black\r\nsky shivered into a tangled network of angry fire!\r\n\r\n\"Here and there were gleaming holes a hundred feet in diameter, broken\r\nin the dark crust, and in them the melted lava--the color a dazzling\r\nwhite just tinged with yellow--was boiling and surging furiously; and\r\nfrom these holes branched numberless bright torrents in many directions,\r\nlike the spokes of a wheel, and kept a tolerably straight course for a\r\nwhile and then swept round in huge rainbow curves, or made a long\r\nsuccession of sharp worm-fence angles, which looked precisely like the\r\nfiercest jagged lightning. Those streams met other streams, and they\r\nmingled with and crossed and recrossed each other in every conceivable\r\ndirection, like skate-tracks on a popular skating-ground. Sometimes\r\nstreams twenty or thirty feet wide flowed from the holes to some\r\ndistance without dividing--and through the opera-glasses we could see\r\nthat they ran down small, steep hills and were genuine cataracts of\r\nfire, white at their source, but soon cooling and turning to the richest\r\nred, grained with alternate lines of black and gold. Every now and then\r\nmasses of the dark crust broke away and floated slowly down these\r\nstreams like rafts down a river.\r\n\r\n\"Occasionally, the molten lava flowing under the superincumbent crust\r\nbroke through--split a dazzling streak, from five hundred to a thousand\r\nfeet long, like a sudden flash of lightning, and then acre after acre of\r\nthe cold lava parted into fragments, turned up edgewise like cakes of\r\nice when a great river breaks up, plunged downward, and were swallowed\r\nin the crimson caldron. Then the wide expanse of the 'thaw' maintained a\r\nruddy glow for a while, but shortly cooled and became black and level\r\nagain. During a 'thaw' every dismembered cake was marked by a glittering\r\nwhite border which was superbly shaded inward by aurora borealis rays,\r\nwhich were a flaming yellow where they joined the white border, and from\r\nthence toward their points tapered into glowing crimson, then into a\r\nrich, pale carmine, and finally into a faint blush that held its own a\r\nmoment and then dimmed and turned black. Some of the streams preferred\r\nto mingle together in a tangle of fantastic circles, and then they\r\nlooked something like the confusion of ropes one sees on a ship's deck\r\nwhen she has just taken in sail and dropped anchor--provided one can\r\nimagine those ropes on fire.\r\n\r\n\"Through the glasses, the little fountains scattered about looked very\r\nbeautiful. They boiled, and coughed, and spluttered, and discharged\r\nsprays of stringy red fire--of about the consistency of mush, for\r\ninstance--from ten to fifteen feet into the air, along with a shower of\r\nbrilliant white sparks--a quaint and unnatural mingling of gouts of\r\nblood and snowflakes.\"\r\n\r\nOne can descend the sides and approach surprisingly close to the\r\nflaming surface, the temperature of which, by the way, is 1750 degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nSuch is \"The House of Everlasting Fire\" to-day. But who can say what it\r\nwill be a year or a decade hence? A clogging or a shifting of the vents\r\nbelow sea-level, and Kilauea's lake of fire may become again explosive.\r\nWho will deny that Kilauea may not soar even above Mauna Loa? Stranger\r\nthings have happened before this in the Islands of Surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEDIMENTARY NATIONAL PARKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nON SEDIMENTARY ROCK IN SCENERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national parks which are wrought in sedimentary rocks are Glacier,\r\nMesa Verde, Hot Springs, Platt, Wind Cave, Sully's Hill, and Grand\r\nCanyon. Zion National Monument is carved from sedimentary rock; also\r\nseveral distinguished reservations in our southwest which conserve\r\nnatural bridges and petrified forests.\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks have highly attractive scenic quality. Lying in strata\r\nusually horizontal but often inclined by earth movements, sometimes even\r\nstanding on end, they form marked and pleasing contrasts with the heavy\r\nmassing of the igneous rocks and the graceful undulations and occasional\r\nsharp-pointed summits of the lavas.\r\n\r\nAs distinguished from igneous rocks, which form under pressure in the\r\nearth's hot interior, and from lava, which results from volcanic\r\neruption when fluid igneous rocks are released from pressure,\r\nsedimentary rocks are formed by the solidification of precipitations in\r\nwater, like limestone; or from material resulting from rock\r\ndisintegrations washed down by streams, like sandstone and shale. The\r\nbeds in which they lie one above another exhibit a wide range of tint\r\nand texture, often forming spectacles of surpassing beauty and\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nThese strata tend to cleave vertically, sometimes producing an\r\nappearance suggestive of masonry, frequently forming impressive cliffs;\r\nbut often they lie in unbroken beds of great area. When a number of\r\nwell-defined strata cleave vertically, and one end of the series sags\r\nbelow the other, or lifts above it, the process which geologists call\r\nfaulting, the scenic effect is varied and striking; sometimes, as in\r\nGlacier National Park, it is puzzling and amazing.\r\n\r\nMany granitic and volcanic landscapes are variegated in places by\r\naccidental beds of sedimentary rock; and conversely occasional\r\nsedimentary landscapes are set off by intrusions of igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nBesides variety of form, sedimentary rocks furnish a wide range of color\r\nderived from mineral dyes dissolved out of rocks by erosion. The\r\ngorgeous tint of the Vermilion Cliff in Utah and Arizona, the reds and\r\ngreens of the Grand Canyon and Glacier National Park, the glowing cliffs\r\nof the Canyon de Chelly, and the variegated hues of the Painted Desert\r\nare examples which have become celebrated.\r\n\r\nGeologists distinguish many kinds of sedimentary rocks. Scenically, we\r\nneed consider only four: limestone, conglomerate, sandstone, and shale.\r\n\r\nLimestone is calcium carbonate derived principally from sea-water,\r\nsometimes from fresh water, either by the action of microscopic\r\norganisms which absorb it for their shells, or occasionally by direct\r\nprecipitation from saturated solutions. The sediment from organisms,\r\nwhich is the principal source of American scenic limestones, collects as\r\nooze in shallow lakes or seas, and slowly hardens when lifted above the\r\nwater-level. Limestone is a common and prominent scenic rock; generally\r\nit is gray or blue and weathers pale yellow. Moisture seeping in from\r\nabove often reduces soluble minerals which drain away, leaving caves\r\nwhich sometimes have enormous size.\r\n\r\nThe other sedimentary rocks which figure prominently in landscape are\r\nproducts of land erosion which rivers sweep into seas or lakes, where\r\nthey are promptly deposited. The coarse gravels which naturally fall\r\nfirst become conglomerate when cemented by the action of chemicals in\r\nwater. The finer sandy particles become sandstone. The fine mud, which\r\ndeposits last, eventually hardens into shale.\r\n\r\nShale has many varieties, but is principally hardened clay; it tends to\r\nsplit into slate-like plates each the thickness of its original deposit.\r\nIt is usually dull brown or slate color, but sometimes, as in Glacier\r\nNational Park and the Grand Canyon, shows a variety of more or less\r\nbrilliant colors and, by weathering, a wide variety of kindred tints.\r\n\r\nSandstone, which forms wherever moving water or wind has collected\r\nsands, and pressure or chemical action has cemented them, is usually\r\nbuff, but sometimes is brilliantly colored.\r\n\r\nThe processes of Nature have mixed the earth's scenic elements in\r\nseemingly inextricable confusion, and the task of the geologist has\r\nbeen colossal. Fortunately for us, the elements of scenery are few, and\r\ntheir larger combinations broad and simple. Once the mind has grasped\r\nthe outline and the processes, and the eye has learned to distinguish\r\nelements and recognize forms, the world is recreated for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nGLACIERED PEAKS AND PAINTED SHALES\r\n\r\nGLACIER NATIONAL PARK, NORTHWESTERN MONTANA. AREA, 1,534 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTo say that Glacier National Park is the Canadian Rockies done in Grand\r\nCanyon colors is to express a small part of a complicated fact. Glacier\r\nis so much less and more. It is less in its exhibit of ice and snow.\r\nBoth are dying glacial regions, and Glacier is hundreds of centuries\r\nnearer the end; no longer can it display snowy ranges in August and\r\nlong, sinuous Alaska-like glaciers at any time. Nevertheless, it has its\r\nglaciers, sixty or more of them perched upon high rocky shelves, the\r\nbeautiful shrunken reminders of one-time monsters. Also it has the\r\nprecipice-walled cirques and painted, lake-studded valleys which these\r\nmonsters left for the enjoyment of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is these cirques and valleys which constitute Glacier's unique\r\nfeature, which make it incomparable of its kind. Glacier's innermost\r\nsanctuaries of grandeur are comfortably accessible and intimately\r\nenjoyable for more than two months each summer. The greatest places of\r\nthe Canadian Rockies are never accessible comfortably; alpinists may\r\nclamber over their icy crevasses and scale their slippery heights in\r\nAugust, but the usual traveller will view their noblest spectacles from\r\nhotel porches or valley trails.\r\n\r\nThis comparison is useful because both regions are parts of the same\r\ngeological and scenic development in which Glacier may be said to be\r\nscenically, though by no means geologically, completed and the Canadian\r\nRockies still in the making. A hundred thousand years or more from now\r\nthe Canadian Rockies may have reached, except for coloring, the present\r\nscenic state of Glacier.\r\n\r\nGlacier National Park hangs down from the Canadian boundary-line in\r\nnorthwestern Montana, where it straddles the continental divide.\r\nAdjoining it on the north is the Waterton Lakes Park, Canada. The\r\nBlackfeet Indian Reservation borders it on the east. Its southern\r\nboundary is Marias Pass, through which the Great Northern Railway\r\ncrosses the crest of the Rocky Mountains. Its western boundary is the\r\nNorth Fork of the Flathead River. The park contains fifteen hundred and\r\nthirty-four square miles.\r\n\r\nCommunication between the east and west sides within the park is only by\r\ntrail across passes over the continental divide.\r\n\r\nThere are parts of America quite as distinguished as Glacier: Mount\r\nMcKinley, for its enormous snowy mass and stature; Yosemite, for the\r\nquality of its valley's beauty; Mount Rainier, for its massive radiating\r\nglaciers; Crater Lake, for its color range in pearls and blues; Grand\r\nCanyon, for its stupendous painted gulf. But there is no part of America\r\nor the Americas, or of the world, to match it of its kind. In respect\r\nto the particular wondrous thing these glaciers of old left behind them\r\nwhen they shrank to shelved trifles, there is no other. At Glacier one\r\nsees what he never saw elsewhere and never will see again--except at\r\nGlacier. There are mountains everywhere, but no others carved into\r\nshapes quite like these; cirques in all lofty ranges, but not cirques\r\njust such as these; and because of these unique bordering highlands\r\nthere are nowhere else lakes having the particular kind of charm\r\npossessed by Glacier's lakes.\r\n\r\nVisitors seldom comprehend Glacier; hence they are mute, or praise in\r\ngeneralities or vague superlatives. Those who have not seen other\r\nmountains find the unexpected and are puzzled. Those who have seen other\r\nmountains fail to understand the difference in these. I have never heard\r\ncomparison with any region except the Canadian Rockies, and this seldom\r\nvery intelligent. \"I miss the big glaciers and snowy mountain-tops,\"\r\nsays the traveller of one type. \"You can really see something here\r\nbesides snow, and how stunning it all is!\" says the traveller of another\r\ntype. \"My God, man, where are your artists?\" cried an Englishman who had\r\ncome to St. Mary Lake to spend a night and was finishing his week. \"They\r\nought to be here in regiments. Not that this is the greatest thing in\r\nthe world, but that there's nothing else in the world like it.\" Yet this\r\nemotional traveller, who had seen the Himalayas, Andes, and Canadian\r\nRockies, could not tell me clearly why it was different. Neither could\r\nthe others explain why they liked it better than the Canadian Rockies,\r\nor why its beauty puzzled and disturbed them. It is only he whom\r\nintelligent travel has educated to analyze and distinguish who sees in\r\nthe fineness and the extraordinary distinction of Glacier's mountain\r\nforms the completion of the more heroic undevelopment north of the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe elements of Glacier's personality are so unusual that it will be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to make phrase describe it. Comparison\r\nfails. Photographs will help, but not very efficiently, because they do\r\nnot convey its size, color, and reality; or perhaps I should say its\r\nunreality, for there are places like Two Medicine Lake in still pale\r\nmid-morning, St. Mary Lake during one of its gold sunsets, and the\r\ncirques of the South Fork of the Belly River under all conditions which\r\nnever can seem actual.\r\n\r\nTo picture Glacier as nearly as possible, imagine two mountain ranges\r\nroughly parallel in the north, where they pass the continental divide\r\nbetween them across a magnificent high intervening valley, and, in the\r\nsouth, merging into a wild and apparently planless massing of high peaks\r\nand ranges. Imagine these mountains repeating everywhere huge pyramids,\r\nenormous stone gables, elongated cones, and many other unusual shapes,\r\nincluding numerous saw-toothed edges which rise many thousand feet\r\nupward from swelling sides, and suggest nothing so much as overturned\r\nkeel-boats. Imagine ranges glacier-bitten alternately on either side\r\nwith cirques of three or four thousand feet of precipitous depth.\r\nImagine these cirques often so nearly meeting that the intervening walls\r\nare knife-like edges; miles of such walls carry the continental divide,\r\nand occasionally these cirques meet and the intervening wall crumbles\r\nand leaves a pass across the divide. Imagine places where cirque walls\r\nhave been so bitten outside as well as in that they stand like\r\namphitheatres builded up from foundations instead of gouged out of rock\r\nfrom above.\r\n\r\nImagine these mountains plentifully snow-spattered upon their northern\r\nslopes and bearing upon their shoulders many small and beautiful\r\nglaciers perched upon rock-shelves above and back of the cirques left by\r\nthe greater glaciers of which they are the remainders. These glaciers\r\nare nearly always wider than they are long; of these I have seen only\r\nthree with elongated lobes. One is the Blackfeet Glacier, whose\r\ninteresting west lobe is conveniently situated for observation south of\r\nGunsight Lake, and another, romantically beautiful Agassiz Glacier, in\r\nthe far northwest of the park, whose ice-currents converge in a tongue\r\nwhich drops steeply to its snout. These elongations are complete\r\nminiatures, each exhibiting in little more than half a mile of length\r\nall usual glacial phenomena, including caves and ice-falls.\r\nOccasionally, as on the side of Mount Jackson at Gunsight Pass and east\r\nof it, one notices small elongated glaciers occupying clefts in steep\r\nslopes. The largest and most striking of these tongued glaciers is the\r\nwesternmost of the three Carter Glaciers on the slopes of Mount Carter.\r\nIt cascades its entire length into Bowman Valley, and Marius R.\r\nCampbell's suggestion that it should be renamed the Cascading Glacier\r\ndeserves consideration.\r\n\r\nImagine deep rounded valleys emerging from these cirques and twisting\r\nsnakelike among enormous and sometimes grotesque rock masses which often\r\nare inconceivably twisted and tumbled, those of each drainage-basin\r\nconverging fan-like to its central valley. Sometimes a score or more of\r\ncirques, great and small, unite their valley streams for the making of a\r\nriver; seven principal valleys, each the product of such a group, emerge\r\nfrom the east side of the park, thirteen from the west.\r\n\r\nImagine hundreds of lakes whose waters, fresh-run from snow-field and\r\nglacier, brilliantly reflect the odd surrounding landscape. Each glacier\r\nhas its lake or lakes of robin's-egg blue. Every successive shelf of\r\nevery glacial stairway has its lake--one or more. And every valley has\r\nits greater lake or string of lakes. Glacier is pre-eminently the park\r\nof lakes. When all is said and done, they constitute its most\r\ndistinguished single element of supreme beauty. For several of them\r\nenthusiastic admirers loudly claim world pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nAnd finally imagine this picture done in soft glowing colors--not only\r\nthe blue sky, the flowery meadows, the pine-green valleys, and the\r\ninnumerable many-hued waters, but the rocks, the mountains, and the\r\ncirques besides. The glaciers of old penetrated the most colorful depths\r\nof earth's skin, the very ancient Algonkian strata, that from which a\r\npart of the Grand Canyon also was carved. At this point, the rocks\r\nappear in four differently colored layers. The lowest of these is called\r\nthe Altyn limestone. There are about sixteen hundred feet of it, pale\r\nblue within, weathering pale buff. Whole yellow mountains of this rock\r\nhang upon the eastern edge of the park. Next above the Altyn lies\r\nthirty-four hundred feet of Appekunny argillite, or dull-green shale.\r\nThe tint is pale, deepening to that familiar in the lower part of the\r\nGrand Canyon. It weathers every darkening shade to very dark\r\ngreenish-brown. Next above that lies twenty-two hundred feet of Grinnell\r\nargillite, or red shale, a dull rock of varying pinks which weathers\r\nmany shades of red and purple, deepening in places almost to black.\r\nThere is some gleaming white quartzite mixed with both these shales.\r\nNext above lies more than four thousand feet of Siyeh limestone, very\r\nsolid, very massive, iron-gray with an insistent flavor of yellow, and\r\nweathering buff. This heavy stratum is the most impressive part of the\r\nGlacier landscape. Horizontally through its middle runs a dark broad\r\nribbon of diorite, a rock as hard as granite, which once, while molten,\r\nburst from below and forced its way between horizontal beds of\r\nlimestone; and occasionally, as in the Swiftcurrent and Triple Divide\r\nPasses, there are dull iron-black lavas in heavy twisted masses. Above\r\nall of these colored strata once lay still another shale of very\r\nbrilliant red. Fragments of this, which geologists call the Kintla\r\nformation, may be seen topping mountains here and there in the northern\r\npart of the park.\r\n\r\nImagine these rich strata hung east and west across the landscape and\r\nsagging deeply in the middle, so that a horizontal line would cut all\r\ncolors diagonally.\r\n\r\nNow imagine a softness of line as well as color resulting probably from\r\nthe softness of the rock; there is none of the hard insistence, the\r\nuncompromising definiteness of the granite landscape. And imagine\r\nfurther an impression of antiquity, a feeling akin to that with which\r\none enters a mediaeval ruin or sees the pyramids of Egypt. Only here is\r\nthe look of immense, unmeasured, immeasurable age. More than at any\r\nplace except perhaps the rim of the Grand Canyon does one seem to stand\r\nin the presence of the infinite; an instinct which, while it baffles\r\nanalysis, is sound, for there are few rocks of the earth's skin so aged\r\nas these ornate shales and limestones.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, you can imagine Glacier!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut, with Glacier, this is not enough. To see, to realize in full its\r\nbeauty, still leaves one puzzled. One of the peculiarities of the\r\nlandscape, due perhaps to its differences, is its insistence upon\r\nexplanation. How came this prehistoric plain so etched with cirques and\r\nvalleys as to leave standing only worm-like crests, knife-edged walls,\r\namphitheatres, and isolated peaks? The answer is the story of a romantic\r\nepisode in the absorbing history of America's making.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between forty and six hundred million years ago, according to\r\nthe degree of conservatism controlling the geologist who does the\r\ncalculating, these lofty mountains were deposited in the shape of muddy\r\nsediments on the bottom of shallow fresh-water lakes, whose waves left\r\nmany ripple marks upon the soft muds of its shores, fragments of which,\r\nhardened now to shale, are frequently found by tourists. So ancient was\r\nthe period that these deposits lay next above the primal Archean rocks,\r\nand marked, therefore, almost the beginning of accepted geological\r\nhistory. Life was then so nearly at its beginnings that the forms which\r\nWalcott found in the Siyeh limestone were not at first fully accepted as\r\norganic.\r\n\r\nThereafter, during a time so long that none may even estimate it,\r\ncertainly for many millions of years, the history of the region leaves\r\ntraces of no extraordinary change. It sank possibly thousands of feet\r\nbeneath the fresh waters tributary to the sea which once swept from the\r\nGulf of Mexico to the Arctic, and accumulated there sediments which\r\nto-day are scenic limestones and shales, and doubtless other sediments\r\nabove these which have wholly passed away. It may have alternated above\r\nand below water-level many times, as our southwest has done.\r\nEventually, under earth-pressures concerning whose cause many theories\r\nhave lived and died, it rose to remain until our times.\r\n\r\nThen, millions of years ago, but still recently as compared with the\r\nwhole vast lapse we are considering, came the changes which seem\r\ndramatic to us as we look back upon them accomplished; but which came to\r\npass so slowly that no man, had man then lived, could have noticed a\r\nsingle step of progress in the course of a long life. Under\r\nearth-pressures the skin buckled and the Rocky Mountains rose. At some\r\nstage of this process the range cracked along its crest from what is now\r\nMarias Pass to a point just over the Canadian border, and, a couple of\r\nhundred miles farther north, from the neighborhood of Banff to the\r\nnorthern end of the Canadian Rockies.\r\n\r\nThen the great overthrust followed. Side-pressures of inconceivable\r\npower forced upward the western edge of this crack, including the entire\r\ncrust from the Algonkian strata up, and thrust it over the eastern edge.\r\nDuring the overthrusting, which may have taken a million years, and\r\nduring the millions of years since, the frosts have chiselled open and\r\nthe rains have washed away all the overthrust strata, the accumulations\r\nof the geological ages from Algonkian times down, except only that one\r\nbottom layer. This alone remained for the three ice invasions of the\r\nGlacial Age to carve into the extraordinary area which is called to-day\r\nthe Glacier National Park.\r\n\r\nThe Lewis Overthrust, so called because it happened to the Lewis Range,\r\nis ten to fifteen miles wide. The eastern boundary of the park roughly\r\ndefines its limit of progress. Its signs are plain to the eye taught to\r\nperceive them. The yellow mountains on the eastern edge near the gateway\r\nto Lake McDermott lie on top of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, whose\r\nsurface is many millions of years younger and quite different in\r\ncoloring. Similarly, Chief Mountain, at the entrance of the Belly River\r\nValley, owes much of its remarkable distinction to the incompatibility\r\nof its form and color with the prairie upon which it lies but out of\r\nwhich it seems to burst. The bottom of McDermott Falls at Many Glacier\r\nHotel is plainly a younger rock than the colored Algonkian limestones\r\nwhich form its brink.\r\n\r\nPerhaps thousands of years after the overthrust was accomplished another\r\ntremendous faulting still further modified the landscape of to-day. The\r\noverthrust edge cracked lengthwise, this time west of the continental\r\ndivide all the way from the Canadian line southward nearly to Marias\r\nPass. The edge of the strata west of this crack sank perhaps many\r\nthousands of feet, leaving great precipices on the west side of the\r\ndivide similar to those on the east side. There was this great\r\ndifference, however, in what followed: the elongated gulf or ditch thus\r\nformed became filled with the deposits of later geologic periods.\r\n\r\nThis whole process, which also was very slow in movement, is important\r\nin explaining the conformation and scenic peculiarities of the west side\r\nof the park, which, as the tourist sees it to-day, is remarkably\r\ndifferent from those of the east side. Here, the great limestone ranges,\r\nglaciered, cirqued, and precipiced as on the east side, suddenly give\r\nplace to broad, undulating plains which constitute practically the whole\r\nof the great west side from the base of the mountains on the east to the\r\nvalley of the Flathead which forms the park's western boundary. These\r\nplains are grown thickly with splendid forests. Cross ranges, largely\r\nglacier-built, stretch west from the high mountains, subsiding rapidly;\r\nand between these ranges lie long winding lakes, forest-grown to their\r\nedges, which carry the western drainage of the continental divide\r\nthrough outlet streams into the Flathead.\r\n\r\nThe inconceivable lapse of time covered in these titanic operations of\r\nNature and their excessive slowness of progress rob them of much of\r\ntheir dramatic quality. Perhaps an inch of distance was an extraordinary\r\nadvance for the Lewis Overthrust to make in any ordinary year, and\r\ndoubtless there were lapses of centuries when no measurable advance was\r\nmade. Yet sometimes sudden settlings, accompanied by more or less\r\nextended earthquakes, must have visibly altered local landscapes.\r\n\r\nWere it possible, by some such mental foreshortening as that by which\r\nthe wizards of the screen compress a life into a minute, for imagination\r\nto hasten this progress into the compass of a few hours, how\r\noverwhelming would be the spectacle! How tremendously would loom this\r\nadvancing edge, which at first we may conceive as having enormous\r\nthickness! How it must have cracked, crumbled, and fallen in frequent\r\ntitanic crashes as it moved forward. It does not need the imagination of\r\nDore to picture this advance, thus hastened in fancy, grim, relentless\r\nas death, its enormous towering head lost in eternal snows, its feet\r\nshaken by earthquakes, accumulating giant glaciers only to crush them\r\ninto powder; resting, then pushing forward in slow, smashing,\r\nreverberating shoves. How the accumulations of all periods may be\r\nimagined crashing together into the depths! Silurian gastropods, strange\r\nDevonian fishes, enormous Triassic reptiles, the rich and varied shells\r\nof the Jurassic, the dinosaurs and primitive birds of Cretaceous, the\r\nlittle early horses of Eocene, and Miocene's camels and mastodons\r\nmingling their fossil remnants in a democracy of ruin to defy the\r\neternal ages!\r\n\r\nIt all happened, but unfortunately for a romantic conception, it did not\r\nhappen with dramatic speed. Hundreds, thousands, sometimes millions of\r\nyears intervened between the greater stages of progress which, with\r\nintervening lesser stages, merged into a seldom-broken quietude such as\r\nthat which impresses to-day's visitor to the mountain-tops of Glacier\r\nNational Park. And who can say that the landscape which to-day's\r\nvisitor, with the inborn arrogance of man, looks upon as the thing which\r\nthe ages have completed for his pleasure, may not merely represent a\r\nminor stage in a progress still more terrible?\r\n\r\nThe grist of Creation's past milling has disappeared. The waters of\r\nheaven, collected and stored in snow-fields and glaciers to be released\r\nin seasonal torrents, have washed it all away. Not a sign remains to-day\r\nsave here and there perhaps a fragment of Cretaceous coal. All has been\r\nground to powder and carried off by flood and stream to enrich the soils\r\nand upbuild later strata in the drainage basins of the Saskatchewan, the\r\nColumbia, and the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that little remained but the Algonkian shales and\r\nlimestones when the Ice Age sent southward the first of its three great\r\ninvasions. Doubtless already there were glaciers there of sorts, but the\r\nlowering temperatures which accompanied the ice-sheets developed local\r\nglaciers so great of size that only a few mountain-tops were left\r\nexposed. It was then that these extraordinary cirques were carved. There\r\nwere three such periods during the Ice Age, between which and after\r\nwhich stream erosion resumed its untiring sway. The story of the ice is\r\nwritten high upon Glacier's walls and far out on the eastern plains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nInto this wonderland the visitor enters by one of two roads. Either he\r\nleaves the railroad at Glacier Park on the east side of the continental\r\ndivide or at Belton on the west side. In either event he can cross to\r\nthe other side only afoot or on horseback over passes. The usual way in\r\nis through Glacier Park. There is a large hotel at the station from\r\nwhich automobile-stages run northward to chalets at Two Medicine Lake,\r\nthe Cut Bank Valley, and St. Mary Lake, and to the Many Glacier Hotel\r\nand chalets at Lake McDermott. A road also reaches Lake McDermott from\r\nCanada by way of Babb, and Canadian visitors can reach the trails at the\r\nhead of Waterton Lake by boat from their own Waterton Lakes Park. Those\r\nentering at Belton, where the park headquarters are located, find\r\nchalets at the railroad-station and an excellent hotel near the head of\r\nLake McDonald. There is also a comfortable chalet close to the Sperry\r\nGlacier.\r\n\r\nTo see Glacier as thoroughly as Glacier deserves and to draw freely on\r\nits abundant resources of pleasure and inspiration, one must travel the\r\ntrails and pitch his tent where day's end brings him. But that does not\r\nmean that Glacier cannot be seen and enjoyed by those to whom\r\ncomfortable hotel accommodations are a necessity, or even by those who\r\nfind trail-travelling impossible.\r\n\r\nVisitors, therefore, fall into three general classes, all of whom may\r\nstudy scenery which quite fully covers the range of Glacier's natural\r\nphenomena and peculiar beauty. The largest of these classes consists of\r\nthose who can travel, or think they can travel, only in vehicles, and\r\ncan find satisfactory accommodations only in good hotels. The\r\nintermediate class includes those who can, at a pinch, ride ten or\r\ntwelve miles on comfortably saddled horses which walk the trails at two\r\nor three miles an hour, and who do not object to the somewhat primitive\r\nbut thoroughly comfortable overnight accommodations of the chalets.\r\nFinally comes the small class, which constantly will increase, of those\r\nwho have the time and inclination to leave the beaten path with tent and\r\ncamping outfit for the splendid wilderness and the places of supreme\r\nmagnificence which are only for those who seek.\r\n\r\nThe man, then, whose tendency to gout, let us say, forbids him ride a\r\nhorse or walk more than a couple of easy miles a day may, nevertheless,\r\nmiss nothing of Glacier's meaning and magnificence provided he takes the\r\ntrouble to understand. But he must take the trouble; he must comprehend\r\nthe few examples that he sees; this is his penalty for refusing the rich\r\nexperience of the trail, which, out of its very fulness, drives meaning\r\nhome with little mental effort. His knowledge must be got from six\r\nplaces only which may be reached by vehicle, at least three of which,\r\nhowever, may be included among the world's great scenic places. He can\r\nfind at Two Medicine, St. Mary, and McDermott superb examples of\r\nGlacier's principal scenic elements.\r\n\r\nEntering at Glacier Park, he will have seen the range from the plains,\r\nan important beginning; already, approaching from the east, he has\r\nwatched it grow wonderfully on the horizon. So suddenly do these painted\r\nmountains spring from the grassy plain that it is a relief to recognize\r\nin them the advance guard of the Lewis Overthrust, vast fragments of the\r\nupheavals of the depths pushed eastward by the centuries to their final\r\nresting-places upon the surface of the prairie. From the hotel porches\r\nthey glow gray and yellow and purple and rose and pink, according to the\r\nnatural coloring of their parts and the will of the sun--a splendid\r\never-changing spectacle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO MEDICINE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nAn hour's automobile-ride from Glacier Park Hotel will enable our\r\ntraveller to penetrate the range at a point of supreme beauty and stand\r\nbeside a chalet at the foot of Two Medicine Lake. He will face what\r\nappears to be a circular lake in a densely forested valley from whose\r\nshore rises a view of mountains which will take his breath. In the near\r\ncentre stands a cone of enormous size and magnificence--Mount\r\nRockwell--faintly blue, mistily golden, richly purple, dull silver, or\r\nred and gray, according to the favor of the hour and the sky. Upon its\r\nleft and somewhat back rises a smaller similar cone, flatter but quite\r\nas perfectly proportioned, known as Grizzly Mountain, and upon its right\r\nless regular masses. In the background, connecting all, are more distant\r\nmountains flecked with snow, the continental divide. Towering mountains\r\nclose upon him upon both sides, that upon his right a celebrity in red\r\nargillite known as Rising Wolf. He sees all this from a beach of\r\nmany-colored pebbles.\r\n\r\nFew casual visitors have more than a midday view of Two Medicine Lake,\r\nfor the stage returns in the afternoon. The glory of the sunset and the\r\nwonder before sunrise are for the few who stay over at the chalet. The\r\nlover of the exquisite cannot do better, for, though beyond lie scenes\r\nsurpassing this in the qualities which bring to the lips the shout of\r\njoy, I am convinced that nothing elsewhere equals the Two Medicine\r\ncanvas in the perfection of delicacy. It is the Meissonier of Glacier.\r\n\r\nNor can the student of Nature's processes afford to miss the study of\r\nTwo Medicine's marvellously complete and balanced system of cirques and\r\nvalleys--though this of course is not for the rheumatic traveller but\r\nfor him who fears not horse and tent. Such an explorer will find thrills\r\nwith every passing hour. Giant Mount Rockwell will produce one when a\r\nsideview shows that its apparent cone is merely the smaller eastern end\r\nof a ridge two miles long which culminates in a towering summit on the\r\ndivide; Pumpelly Piller, with the proportions of a monument when seen\r\nfrom near the lake, becomes, seen sideways, another long and exceedingly\r\nbeautiful ridge; striking examples, these, of the leavings of converging\r\nglaciers of old. Two Medicine Lake proves to be long and narrow, the\r\nchalet view being the long way, and Upper Two Medicine Lake proves to be\r\nan emerald-encircled pearl in a silvery-gray setting. The climax of such\r\na several days' trip is a night among the coyotes at the head of the\r\nmain valley and a morning upon Dawson Pass overlooking the indescribable\r\ntangle of peak, precipice, and canyon lying west of the continental\r\ndivide.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the Two Medicine drainage-basin is an epitome of\r\nGlacier in miniature. To those entering the park on the east side and\r\nseeing it first it becomes an admirable introduction to the greater\r\npark. To those who have entered on the west side and finish here it is\r\nan admirable farewell review, especially as its final picture sounds the\r\nnote of scenic perfection. Were there nothing else of Glacier, this spot\r\nwould become in time itself a world celebrity. Incidentally, exceedingly\r\nlively Eastern brook-trout will afford an interesting hour to one who\r\nfloats a fly down the short stream into the lakelet at the foot of Two\r\nMedicine Lake not far below the chalet. There are also fish below Trick\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTACLE OF ST. MARY\r\n\r\nSt. Mary Lake, similarly situated in the outlet valley of a much greater\r\ngroup of cirques north of Two Medicine, offers a picture as similar in\r\nkind as two canvases are similar which have been painted by the same\r\nhand; but they widely differ in composition and magnificence; Two\r\nMedicine's preciousness yields to St. Mary's elemental grandeur. The\r\nsteamer which brings our rheumatic traveller from the motor-stage at the\r\nfoot of the lake lands him at the upper chalet group, appropriately\r\nSwiss, which finds vantage on a rocky promontory for the view of the\r\ndivide. Gigantic mountains of deep-red argillite, grotesquely carved,\r\nclose in the sides, and with lake and sky wonderfully frame the amazing\r\ncentral picture of pointed pyramids, snow-fields, hanging glaciers, and\r\nsilvery ridges merging into sky. Seen on the way into Glacier, St. Mary\r\nis a prophecy which will not be fulfilled elsewhere in charm though\r\noften far exceeded in degree. Seen leaving Glacier, it combines with\r\nsurpassing novelty scenic elements whose possibilities of further\r\ngorgeous combination the trip through the park has seemed to exhaust.\r\n\r\nThe St. Mary picture is impossible to describe. Its colors vary with the\r\nhours and the atmosphere's changing conditions. It is silver, golden,\r\nmauve, blue, lemon, misty white, and red by turn. It is seen clearly in\r\nthe morning with the sun behind you. Afternoons and sunsets offer\r\ntheatrical effects, often baffling, always lovely and different. Pointed\r\nFusillade and peaked Reynolds Mountains often lose their tops in\r\nlowering mists. So, often, does Going-to-the-Sun Mountain in the near-by\r\nright foreground. So, not so often, does keel-shaped Citadel Mountain on\r\nthe near-by left; also, at times, majestic Little Chief, he of lofty\r\nmien and snow-dashed crown, and stolid Red Eagle, whose gigantic\r\nreflection reddens a mile of waters. It is these close-up monsters even\r\nmore than the colorful ghosts of the Western horizon which stamp St.\r\nMary's personality.\r\n\r\nFrom the porches of the chalets and the deck of the steamer in its\r\nevening tour of the lake-end the traveller will note the enormous size\r\nof those upper valleys which once combined their glaciers as now they do\r\ntheir streams. He will guess that the glacier which once swept through\r\nthe deep gorge in whose bottom now lies St. Mary Lake was several\r\nthousand feet in thickness. He will long to examine those upper valleys\r\nand reproduce in imagination the amazing spectacle of long ago. But they\r\nare not for him. That vision is reserved for those who ride the trails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENIC CLIMAX OF THE SWIFTCURRENT\r\n\r\nAgain passing north, the automobile-stage reaches road's end at\r\nMcDermott Lake, the fan-handle of the Swiftcurrent drainage-basin.\r\nOverlooking a magnificent part of each of its contributing valleys, the\r\nlake, itself supremely beautiful, may well deserve its reputation as\r\nGlacier's scenic centre. I have much sympathy with the thousands who\r\nclaim supremacy for McDermott Lake. Lake McDonald has its wonderfully\r\nwooded shores, its majestic length and august vista; Helen Lake its\r\nunequalled wildness; Bowman Lake its incomparable view of\r\nglacier-shrouded divide. But McDermott has something of everything; it\r\nis a composite, a mosaic masterpiece with every stone a gem. There is no\r\nbackground from which one looks forward to \"the view.\" Its horizon\r\ncontains three hundred and sixty degrees of view. From the towering\r\nsouth gable of that rock-temple to God the Creator, which the map calls\r\nMount Gould, around the circle, it offers an unbroken panorama in\r\nsuperlative.\r\n\r\nIn no sense by way of comparison, which is absurd between scenes so\r\ndifferent, but merely to help realization by contrast with what is well\r\nknown, let us recall the Yosemite Valley. Yosemite is a valley,\r\nSwiftcurrent an enclosure. Yosemite is gray and shining, Swiftcurrent\r\nricher far in color. Yosemite's walls are rounded, peaked, and polished,\r\nSwiftcurrent's toothed, torn, and crumbling; the setting sun shines\r\nthrough holes worn by frost and water in the living rock. Yosemite\r\nguards her western entrance with a shaft of gray granite rising\r\nthirty-six hundred feet from the valley floor, and her eastern end by\r\ngranite domes of five thousand and six thousand feet; Swiftcurrent's\r\nrocks gather round her central lake--Altyn, thirty-two hundred feet\r\nabove the lake's level; Henkel, thirty-eight hundred feet; Wilbur,\r\nforty-five hundred feet; Grinnell, four thousand; Gould, forty-seven\r\nhundred; Allen, forty-five hundred--all of colored strata, green at\r\nbase, then red, then gray. Yosemite has its winding river and\r\nwaterfalls, Swiftcurrent its lakes and glaciers.\r\n\r\nSwiftcurrent has the repose but not the softness of Yosemite. Yosemite\r\nis unbelievably beautiful. Swiftcurrent inspires wondering awe.\r\n\r\nMcDermott Lake, focus point of all this natural glory, is scarcely a\r\nmile long, and narrow. It may be vivid blue and steel-blue and\r\nmilky-blue, and half a dozen shades of green and pink all within twice\r\nas many minutes, according to the whim of the breeze, the changing\r\natmosphere, and the clouding of the sun. Often it suggests nothing so\r\nmuch as a pool of dull-green paint. Or it may present a reversed image\r\nof mountains, glaciers, and sky in their own coloring. Or at sunset it\r\nmay turn lemon or purple or crimson or orange, or a blending of all. Or,\r\nwith rushing storm-clouds, it may quite suddenly lose every hint of any\r\ncolor, and become a study in black, white, and intermediate grays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Bailey Willis_\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT GABLE OF GOULD MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nThe water is McDermott Lake, one of the most beautiful in Glacier\r\nNational Park]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by A.J. Baker_\r\n\r\nTHE CIRQUE AT THE HEAD OF CUT BANK CREEK\r\n\r\nFine examples of glacier cirques throughout the park. The peak is Mount\r\nMorgan, Glacier National Park.]\r\n\r\nThere are times when, from hotel porch, rock, or boat, the towering\r\npeaks and connecting limestone walls become suddenly so fairy-like that\r\nthey lose all sense of reality, seeming to merge into their background\r\nof sky, from which, nevertheless, they remain sharply differentiated.\r\nThe rapidity and the variety of change in the appearance of the water is\r\nnothing to that in the appearance of these magical walls and mountains.\r\nNow near, now distant; now luring, now forbidding; now gleaming as if\r\nwith their own light; now gloomy in threat, they lose not their hold on\r\nthe eye for a moment. The unreality of McDermott Lake, the sense it\r\noften imparts of impossibility, is perhaps its most striking feature.\r\nOne suspects he dreams, awake.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENIC CIRCLE\r\n\r\nTo realize the spot as best we may, let us pause on the bridge among\r\nthose casting for trout below the upper fall and glance around. To our\r\nleft rises Allen Mountain, rugged, irregular, forest-clothed half-way up\r\nits forty-five hundred feet of elevation above the valley floor. Beyond\r\nit a long gigantic wall sets in at right angles, blue, shining,\r\nserrated, supporting, apparently on the lake edge, an enormous gable end\r\nof gray limestone banded with black diorite, a veritable personality\r\ncomparable with Yosemite's most famous rocks. This is Mount Gould. Next\r\nis the Grinnell Glacier, hanging glistening in the air, dripping\r\nwaterfalls, backgrounded by the gnawed top of the venerable Garden Wall.\r\nThen comes in turn the majestic mass of Mount Grinnell, four miles long,\r\nculminating at the lakeside in an enormous parti-colored pyramid more\r\nimpressive from the hotel than even Rockwell is from Two Medicine\r\nchalets. Then, upon its right, appears a wall which is the unnamed\r\ncontinuation of the Garden Wall, and, plastered against the side of\r\nSwiftcurrent Mountain, three small hanging glaciers, seeming in the\r\ndistance like two long parallel snow-banks. Then Mount Wilbur, another\r\ngiant pyramid, gray, towering, massively carved, grandly proportioned,\r\nkingly in bearing! Again upon its right emerges still another\r\ncontinuation, also unnamed, of the Garden Wall, this section loftiest of\r\nall and bitten deeply by the ages. A part of it is instantly recognized\r\nfrom the hotel window as part of the sky-line surrounding famous Iceberg\r\nLake. Its right is lost behind the nearer slopes of red Mount Henkel,\r\nwhich swings back upon our right, bringing the eye nearly to its\r\nstarting-point. A glance out behind between mountains, upon the\r\nlimitless lake-dotted plain, completes the scenic circle.\r\n\r\nMcDermott Lake, by which I here mean the Swiftcurrent enclosure as seen\r\nfrom the Many Glacier Hotel, is illustrative of all of Glacier. There\r\nare wilder spots, by far, some which frighten; there are places of\r\nnobler beauty, though as I write I know I shall deny it the next time I\r\nstand on McDermott's shores; there are supreme places which at first\r\nglance seem to have no kinship with any other place on earth.\r\nNevertheless, McDermott contains all of Glacier's elements, all her\r\ncharm, and practically all her combinations. It is the place of places\r\nto study Glacier. It is also a place to dream away idle weeks.\r\n\r\nSo he who cannot ride or walk the trails may still see and understand\r\nGlacier in her majesty. Besides the places I have mentioned he may see,\r\nfrom the Cut Bank Chalet, a characteristic forested valley of great\r\nbeauty, and at Lewis's hotel on Lake McDonald the finest spot accessible\r\nupon the broad west side, the playground, as the east side is the\r\nshow-place, of hundreds of future thousands.\r\n\r\nSo many are the short horseback trips from Many Glacier Hotel to places\r\nof significance and beauty that it is hard for the timid to withstand\r\nthe temptation of the trail. Four miles will reach Grinnell Lake at the\r\nfoot of its glacier, six miles will penetrate the Cracker Lake Gorge at\r\nthe perpendicular base of Mount Siyeh, eight miles will disclose the\r\nastonishing spectacle of Iceberg Lake, and nine miles will cross the\r\nSwiftcurrent Pass to the Granite Park Chalet.\r\n\r\n\r\nICEBERG LAKE TYPICAL OF ALL\r\n\r\nIn some respects Iceberg Lake is Glacier's supreme spectacle. There are\r\nfew spots so wild. There may be no easily accessible spot in the world\r\nhalf so wild. Imagine a horseshoe of perpendicular rock wall,\r\ntwenty-seven hundred to thirty-five hundred feet high, a glacier in its\r\ninmost curve, a lake of icebergs in its centre. The back of the\r\ntower-peak of Mount Wilbur is the southern end of this horseshoe. This\r\nenclosure was not built up from below, as it looks, but bitten down\r\nwithin and without; it was left. On the edge of the lake in early July\r\nthe sun sets at four o'clock.\r\n\r\nStupendous as Iceberg Lake is as a spectacle, its highest purpose is\r\nillustrative. It explains Glacier. Here by this lakeside, fronting the\r\nglacier's floating edge and staring up at the jagged top in front and on\r\neither side, one comprehends at last. The appalling story of the past\r\nseems real.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMAX AT GRANITE PARK\r\n\r\nIt is at Granite Park that one realizes the geography of Glacier. You\r\nhave crossed the continental divide and emerged upon a lofty abutment\r\njust west of it. You are very nearly in the park's centre, and on the\r\nmargin of a forested canyon of impressive breadth and depth, lined on\r\neither side by mountain monsters, and reaching from Mount Cannon at the\r\nhead of Lake McDonald northward to the Alberta plain. The western wall\r\nof this vast avenue is the Livingston Range. Its eastern wall is the\r\nLewis Range. Both in turn carry the continental divide, which crosses\r\nthe avenue from Livingston to Lewis by way of low-crowned Flattop\r\nMountain, a few miles north of where you stand, and back to Livingston\r\nby way of Clements Mountain, a few miles south. Opposite you, across the\r\nchasm, rises snowy Heavens Peak. Southwest lies Lake McDonald, hidden by\r\nHeavens' shoulder. South is Logan Pass, carrying another trail across\r\nthe divide, and disclosing hanging gardens beyond on Reynolds' eastern\r\nslope. Still south of that, unseen from here, is famous Gunsight Pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Haynes_\r\n\r\nPTARMIGAN LAKE AND MOUNT WILBUR, GLACIER NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by A.J. Thiri_\r\n\r\nSCOOPED BOTH SIDES BY GIANT GLACIERS\r\n\r\nWall on the left encloses Iceberg Lake; on the right is the Belly River\r\nabyss; Glacier National Park]\r\n\r\nIt is a stirring spectacle. But wait. A half-hour's climb to the summit\r\nof Swiftcurrent Mountain close at hand (the chalet is most of the way\r\nup, to start with) and all of Glacier lies before you like a model in\r\nrelief. Here you see the Iceberg Cirque from without and above. The\r\nBelly River chasm yawns enormously. Mount Cleveland, monarch of the\r\nregion, flaunts his crown of snow among his near-by court of only lesser\r\nmonsters. The Avenue of the Giants deeply splits the northern half of\r\nthe park, that land of extravagant accent, mysterious because so little\r\nknown; the Glacier of tourists lying south. A marvellous spectacle,\r\nthis, indeed, and one which clears up many misconceptions. The Canadian\r\nRockies hang on the misty northern horizon, the Montana plains float\r\neastward, the American Rockies roll south and west.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER GUNSIGHT PASS\r\n\r\nTo me one of the most stirring sights in all Glacier is the view of\r\nGunsight Pass from the foot of Gunsight Lake. The immense glaciered\r\nuplift of Mount Jackson on the south of the pass, the wild whitened\r\nsides of Gunsight Mountain opposite dropping to the upturned strata of\r\nred shale at the water's edge, the pass itself--so well named--perched\r\nabove the dark precipice at the lake's head, the corkscrew which the\r\ntrail makes up Jackson's perpendicular flank and its passage across a\r\nmammoth snow-bank high in air--these in contrast with the silent black\r\nwater of the sunken lake produce ever the same thrill however often\r\nseen. The look back, too, once the pass is gained, down St. Mary's\r\ngracious valley to Going-to-the-Sun Mountain and its horizon companions!\r\nSun Mountain (for short), always a personality, is never from any other\r\npoint of view so undeniably the crowned majesty as from Gunsight Pass.\r\nAnd finally, looking forward, which in this speaking means westward, the\r\nfirst revelation of Lake Ellen Wilson gives a shock of awed astonishment\r\nwhose memory can never pass.\r\n\r\nTruly, Gunsight is a pass of many sensations, for, leaving Lake Ellen\r\nWilson and its eighteen hundred feet of vertical frothing outlet, the\r\nwestward trail crosses the shoulder of Lincoln Peak to the Sperry\r\nGlacier and its inviting chalet (where the biggest hoary marmot I ever\r\nsaw sat upon my dormitory porch), and, eight miles farther down the\r\nmountain, beautiful Lake McDonald.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTINY OF THE WEST SIDE\r\n\r\nAlthough it was settled earlier, Glacier's west side is less developed\r\nthan its east side; this because, for the most part, its scenery is less\r\nsensational though no less gorgeously beautiful. Its five long lakes, of\r\nwhich McDonald is much the longest and largest, head up toward the snowy\r\nmonsters of the divide; their thin bodies wind leisurely westward among\r\nsuperbly forested slopes. Its day is still to come. It is the land of\r\nthe bear, the moose, the deer, the trout, and summer leisure. Its\r\ndestiny is to become Glacier's vacation playground.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING SPLENDORS OF THE NORTH\r\n\r\nThe wild north side of Glacier, its larger, bigger-featured, and\r\noccasionally greater part, is not yet for the usual tourist; for many\r\nyears from this writing, doubtless, none will know it but the traveller\r\nwith tent and pack-train. He alone, and may his tribe increase, will\r\nenjoy the gorgeous cirques and canyons of the Belly River, the wild\r\nquietude of the Waterton Valley, the regal splendors of Brown Pass, and\r\nthe headwater spectacles of the Logging, Quartz, Bowman, and Kintla\r\nvalleys. He alone will realize that here is a land of greater power,\r\nlarger measures, and bigger horizons.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with Kintla comes climax. Crossing the border the mountains\r\nsubside, the glaciers disappear. Canada's Waterton Lakes Park begins at\r\nour climax and merges in half a dozen miles into the great prairies of\r\nAlberta. It is many miles northwest before the Canadian Rockies assume\r\nproportions of superlative scenic grandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLY RIVER VALLEYS\r\n\r\nTo realize the growing bigness of the land northward one has only to\r\ncross the wall from Iceberg Lake into the Belly River canyon. \"Only,\"\r\nindeed! In 1917 it took us forty miles of detour outside the park, even\r\nunder the shadow of Chief Mountain, to cross the wall from Iceberg Lake,\r\nthe west-side precipice of which is steeper even than the east. The\r\nBelly River drainage-basin is itself bigger, and its mountains bulk in\r\nproportion. Eighteen glaciers contribute to the making of perhaps as\r\nmany lakes. The yellow mountains of its northern slopes invade Canada.\r\nThe borders of its principal valley are two monster mountains,\r\nCleveland, the greatest in the park for mass and height and intricate\r\noutline; the other, Merritt, in some respects the most interesting of\r\nGlacier's abundant collection of majestic peaks.\r\n\r\nThere are three valleys. The North Fork finds its way quickly into\r\nCanada. The Middle Fork rises in a group of glaciers high under the\r\ncontinental divide and descends four giant steps, a lake upon each step,\r\nto two greater lakes of noble aspect in the valley bottom. The South\r\nFork emerges from Helen Lake deep in the gulf below the Ahern Glacier\r\nacross the Garden Wall from Iceberg Lake. Between the Middle and South\r\nForks Mount Merritt rises 9,944 feet in altitude, minareted like a\r\nmediaeval fort and hollow as a bowl, its gaping chasm hung with glaciers.\r\n\r\nThis is the valley of abundance. The waters are large, their trout many\r\nand vigorous; the bottoms are extravagantly rich in grasses and flowers;\r\nthe forests are heavy and full-bodied; there is no open place, even\r\nmiles beyond its boundaries, which does not offer views of extraordinary\r\nnobility. Every man who enters it becomes enthusiastically prophetic of\r\nits future. After all, the Belly River country is easily visited. A\r\nleisurely horseback journey from McDermott, that is all; three days\r\namong the strange yellow mountains of the over thrust's eastern edge,\r\nincluding two afternoons among the fighting trout of Kennedy Creek and\r\nSlide Lake, and two nights in camp among the wild bare arroyos of the\r\nAlgonkian invasion of the prairie--an interesting prelude to the fulness\r\nof wilderness life to come.\r\n\r\nI dwell upon the Belly valleys because their size, magnificence, and\r\naccessibility suggest a future of public use; nothing would be easier,\r\nfor instance, than a road from Babb to join the road already in from\r\nCanada. The name naturally arouses curiosity. Why Belly? Was it not the\r\nAnglo-Saxon frontier's pronunciation of the Frenchman's original Belle?\r\nThe river, remember, is mainly Canadian. Surely in all its forks and\r\ntributaries it was and is the Beautiful River.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AVENUE OF THE GIANTS\r\n\r\nThe Avenue of the Giants looms in any forecast of Glacier's future. It\r\nreally consists of two valleys joined end on at their beginnings on\r\nFlattop Mountain; McDonald Creek flowing south, Little Kootenai flowing\r\nnorth. The road which will replace the present trail up this avenue from\r\nthe much-travelled south to Waterton Lake and Canada is a matter\r\ndoubtless of a distant future, but it is so manifestly destiny that it\r\nmust be accepted as the key to the greater Glacier to come. Uniting at\r\nits southern end roads from both sides of the divide, it will reach the\r\nBelly valleys by way of Ahern Pass, the Bowman and Kintla valleys by way\r\nof Brown Pass, and will terminate at the important tourist settlement\r\nwhich is destined to grow at the splendid American end of Waterton Lake.\r\nIncidentally it will become an important motor-highway between Canada\r\nand America. Until then, though all these are now accessible by trail,\r\nthe high distinction of the Bowman and the Kintla valleys' supreme\r\nexpression of the glowing genius of this whole country will remain\r\nunknown to any considerable body of travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMAX OF BOWMAN AND KINTLA\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, the Bowman and Kintla regions are Glacier's ultimate\r\nexpression, Bowman of her beauty, Kintla of her majesty. No one who has\r\nseen the foaming cascades of Mount Peabody and a lost outlet of the\r\nlofty Boulder Glacier emerging dramatically through Hole-in-the-Wall\r\nFall, for all the world like a horsetail fastened upon the face of a\r\ncliff, who has looked upon the Guardhouse from Brown Pass and traced the\r\ndistant windings of Bowman Lake between the fluted precipice of Rainbow\r\nPeak and the fading slopes of Indian Ridge; or has looked upon the\r\nmighty monolith of Kintla Peak rising five thousand feet from the lake\r\nin its gulf-like valley, spreading upon its shoulders, like wings\r\nprepared for flight, the broad gleaming glaciers known as Kintla and\r\nAgassiz, will withhold his guerdon for a moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by the U.S. Geological Survey_\r\n\r\nSHOWING THE AGASSIZ GLACIER\r\n\r\nKintla Peak, Glacier National Park, 5,000 feet above the lake spreads\r\nglaciers out either way like wings]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by M.R.

AREA, 77 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMany years, possibly centuries, before Columbus discovered America, a\r\ncommunity of cliff-dwellers inhabiting a group of canyons in what is now\r\nsouthwestern Colorado entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nMany generations before that, again possibly centuries, the founders of\r\nthis community, abandoning the primitive pueblos of their people\r\nelsewhere, had sought new homes in the valleys tributary to the Mancos\r\nRiver. Perhaps they were enterprising young men and women dissatisfied\r\nwith the poor and unprogressive life at home. Perhaps they were\r\ndissenters from ancient religious forms, outcasts and pilgrims, for\r\nthere is abundant evidence that the prehistoric sun-worshippers of our\r\nsouthwest were deeply religious, and human nature is the same under\r\nskins of all colors in every land and age. More likely they were merely\r\nthrifty pioneers attracted to the green cedar-grown mesas by the hope of\r\nbetter conditions.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason for their pilgrimage, it is a fair inference that,\r\nlike our own Pilgrim Fathers, they were sturdy of body and progressive\r\nof spirit, for they had a culture which their descendants carried\r\nbeyond that of other tribes and communities of prehistoric people in\r\nAmerica north of the land of the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nBeginning with modest stone structures of the usual cliff-dwellers' type\r\nbuilt in deep clefts in the mesa's perpendicular cliff, safe from\r\nenemies above and below, these enterprising people developed in time a\r\ncomplicated architecture of a high order; they advanced the arts beyond\r\nthe practice of their forefathers and their neighbors; they herded\r\ncattle upon the mesas; they raised corn and melons in clearings in the\r\nforests, and watered their crops in the dry seasons by means of simple\r\nirrigation systems as soundly scientific, so far as they went, as those\r\nof to-day; outgrowing their cliff homes, they invaded the neighboring\r\nmesas, where they built pueblos and more ambitious structures.\r\n\r\nThen, apparently suddenly, for they left behind them many of their\r\nhousehold goods, and left unfinished an elaborate temple to their god,\r\nthe sun, they vanished. There is no clew to the reason or the manner of\r\ntheir going.\r\n\r\nMeantime European civilization was pushing in all directions. Columbus\r\ndiscovered America; De Soto explored the southeast and ascended the\r\nMississippi; Cortez pushed into Mexico and conquered the Aztecs; Spanish\r\npriests carried the gospel north and west from the Antilles to the\r\ncontinent; Raleigh sent explorers to Virginia; the Pilgrim Fathers\r\nlanded in Massachusetts; the white man pushed the Indian aside, and at\r\nlast the European pioneer sought a precarious living on the sands of the\r\nsouthwest.\r\n\r\nOne December day in 1888 Richard and Alfred Wetherill hunted lost cattle\r\non the top of one of the green mesas north and west of the Mancos River.\r\nThey knew this mesa well. Many a time before had they rounded up their\r\nherds and stalked the deer among the thin cedar and pinyon forests.\r\nOften, doubtless, in their explorations of the broad Mancos Valley\r\nbelow, they had happened upon ruins of primitive isolated or grouped\r\nstone buildings hidden by sage-brush, half buried in rock and sand. No\r\ndoubt, around their ranch fire, they had often speculated concerning the\r\nmanner of men that had inhabited these lowly structures so many years\r\nbefore that sometimes aged cedars grew upon the broken walls.\r\n\r\nBut this December day brought the Wetherills the surprise of their\r\nuneventful lives. Some of the cattle had wandered far, and the search\r\nled to the very brink of a deep and narrow canyon, across which, in a\r\nlong deep cleft under the overhang of the opposite cliff, they saw what\r\nappeared to be a city. Those who have looked upon the stirring spectacle\r\nof Cliff Palace from this point can imagine the astonishment of these\r\nranchmen.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the lost cattle were ever found is not recorded, but we\r\nmay assume that living on the mesa was not plentiful enough to make the\r\nWetherills forget them in the pleasure of discovering a ruin. But they\r\nlost no time in investigating their find, and soon after crossed the\r\ncanyon and climbed into this prehistoric city. They named it Cliff\r\nPalace, most inappropriately, by the way, for it was in fact that most\r\ndemocratic of structures, a community dwelling. Pushing their\r\nexplorations farther, presently they discovered also a smaller ruin,\r\nwhich they named Spruce Tree House, because a prominent spruce grew in\r\nfront of it. These are the largest two cliff-dwellings in the Mesa Verde\r\nNational Park, and, until Doctor J. Walter Fewkes unearthed Sun Temple\r\nin 1915, among the most extraordinary prehistoric buildings north of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of prehistoric ruins in our southwest, and many\r\nbesides those of the Mesa Verde are examples of an aboriginal\r\ncivilization. Hundreds of canyons tell the story of the ancient\r\ncliff-dwellers; and still more numerous are the remains of communal\r\nhouses built of stone or sun-dried brick under the open sky. These\r\npueblos in the open are either isolated structures like the lesser\r\ncliff-dwellings, or are crowded together till they touch walls, as in\r\nour modern cities; often they were several stories high, the floors\r\nconnected by ladders. Sometimes, for protection against the elements,\r\nwhole villages were built in caves. Pueblos occasionally may be seen\r\nfrom the car-window in New Mexico. The least modified of the prehistoric\r\ntype which are occupied to-day are the eight villages of the Hopi near\r\nthe Grand Canyon in Arizona; a suggestive reproduction of a model\r\npueblo, familiar to many thousands who have visited the canyon, stands\r\nnear the El Tovar Hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was not therefore because of the rarity of prehistoric dwellings of\r\neither type that the cliff villages of the Mesa Verde were conserved as\r\na national park, nor only because they are the best preserved of all\r\nNorth American ruins, but because they disclose a type of this culture\r\nin advance of all others.\r\n\r\nThe builders and inhabitants of these dwellings were Indians having\r\nphysical features common to all American tribes. That their\r\naccomplishment differed in degree from that of the shiftless war-making\r\ntribes north and east of them, and from that of the cultured and\r\nartistic Mayas of Central America, was doubtless due to differences in\r\nconditions of living. The struggle for bare existence in the southwest,\r\nlike that of the habitats of other North American Indians, was intense;\r\nbut these were agriculturalists and protected by environment. The desert\r\nwas a handicap, of course, but it offered opportunity in many places for\r\ndry farming; the Indian raised his corn. The winters, too, were short.\r\nIt is only in the southwest that enterprise developed the architecture\r\nof stone houses which distinguish pueblo Indians from others in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers in the Mesa Verde were more fortunate even than their\r\nfellow pueblo dwellers. The forested mesas, so different from the arid\r\ncliffs farther south and west, possessed constant moisture and fertile\r\nsoil. The grasses lured the deer within capture. The Mancos River\r\nprovided fish. Above all, the remoteness of these fastness canyons from\r\nthe trails of raiders and traders and their ease of defense made for\r\nlong generations of peace. The enterprise innate in the spirit of man\r\ndid the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe history of the Mesa Verde National Park began with the making of\r\nAmerica. All who have travelled in the southwest have seen mesas from\r\nthe car-window. New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and Utah, the\r\nregion of the pueblos, constitute an elevated plateau largely arid. Many\r\nmillions of years ago all was submerged in the intercontinental sea; in\r\nfact the region was sea many times, for it rose and fell alternately,\r\naccumulating thousands of feet of sands and gravels much of which\r\nhardened into stone after the slow great uplifting which made it the\r\nlofty plateau of to-day. Erosion did its work. For a million years or\r\nmore the floods of spring have washed down the sands and gravels, and\r\nthe rivers have carried them into the sea. Thousands of vertical feet\r\nhave disappeared in this way from the potential altitude of the region.\r\nThe spring floods are still washing down the sands and gravels, and the\r\ncanyons, cliffs, and mesas of the desert are disclosed to-day as stages\r\nin the eternal levelling.\r\n\r\nThus were created the canyons and mesas of the Mesa Verde. Mesa, by the\r\nway, is Spanish for table, and verde for green. These, then, are the\r\ngreen tablelands, forest-covered and during the summer grown scantily\r\nwith grass and richly with flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Mesa Verde National Park was created by act of Congress in June,\r\n1906, and enlarged seven years later. The Mancos River, on its way to\r\nthe San Juan and thence to the Colorado and the passage of the Grand\r\nCanyon, forms its southern boundary. Scores of canyons, large and small,\r\nnearly all dry except at the spring floods, are tributary. All of these\r\ntrend south; in a general way they are parallel. Each of the greater\r\nstems has its lesser tributaries and each of these its lesser forks.\r\nBetween the canyons lie the mesas. Their tops, if continued without\r\nbreak, would form a more or less level surface; that is, all had been a\r\nplain before floods cut the separating canyons.\r\n\r\nThe region has a wonderful scenic charm. It is markedly different in\r\nquality from other national parks, but in its own way is quite as\r\nstartling and beautiful. Comparison is impossible because of the lack of\r\nelements in common, but it may be said that the Mesa Verde represents\r\nour great southwest in one of its most fascinating phases, combining the\r\nfundamentals of the desert with the flavor of the near-by mountains. The\r\ncanyons, which are seven or eight hundred feet deep and two or three\r\ntimes as wide where the cliff-dwellings gather, are prevailingly tawny\r\nyellow. Masses of sloping talus reach more than half-way up; above them\r\nthe cliffs are perpendicular; it is in cavities in these perpendiculars\r\nthat the cliff-dwellings hide. Above the cliffs are low growths of\r\nyellowish-green cedar with pinyons and other conifers of darker foliage.\r\nBeneath the trees and covering the many opens grows the familiar sage of\r\nthe desert, a gray which hints at green and yellow both but realizes\r\nneither. But the sage-brush shelters desert grasses, and, around the\r\noccasional springs and their slender outlets, grass grows rank and\r\nplenteous; a little water counts for a great deal in the desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLINE OF THE MESA VERDE FORMATION\r\n\r\nShowing the manner in which water erosion is reducing the plains to\r\ncanyons and mesas. The Mesa Verde cliff-dwellers built their homes in\r\ncaves in the perpendicular cliffs above the sloping talus]\r\n\r\nSummer, then, is delightful on the Mesa Verde. The plateau is high and\r\nthe air invigorating, warm by day in midsummer, always cool at night.\r\nThe atmosphere is marvellously clear, and the sunsets are famous. The\r\nwinter snows, which reach three or four feet in depth, disappear in\r\nApril. From May to Thanksgiving the region is in its prime. It is\r\nimportant to realize that this land has much for the visitor besides its\r\nruins. It has vigor, distinction, personality, and remarkable charm. It\r\nis the highest example of one of America's most distinctive and\r\nimportant scenic phases, and this without reference to its prehistoric\r\ndwellings. No American traveller knows his America, even the great\r\nsouthwest, who does not know the border-land where desert and forest\r\nmingle.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Ute Indian Reservation bites a large rectangle from the\r\nsoutheast corner of the park, but its inhabitants are very different in\r\nquality of mind and spirit from the ancient and reverent builders of Sun\r\nTemple. Reservation Indians frequently enter the park, but they cannot\r\nbe persuaded to approach the cliff-dwellings. The \"little people,\" they\r\ntell you, live there, and neither teaching nor example will convince\r\nthem that these invisible inhabitants will not injure intruders. Some\r\nof these Indians allege that it was their own ancestors who built the\r\ncliff-dwellings, but there is neither record nor tradition to support\r\nsuch a claim. The fact appears to be that the Utes were the ancient\r\nenemies of this people. There is a Ute tradition of a victory over the\r\nancient pueblo-dwellers at Battle Rock in McElmo Canyon.\r\n\r\nThere are, on the other hand, many reasons for the opinion that the Hopi\r\nIndians of the present day, so far at least as culture goes, are\r\ndescendants of this remarkable prehistoric people. Besides the many\r\nsimilarities between the architectural types of the Mesa Verde and the\r\npueblos of the modern Hopi, careful investigators have found suggestive\r\npoints of similarity in their utensils, their art forms, and their\r\ncustoms. Doctor Fewkes cites a Hopi tradition to that effect by\r\nmentioning the visit of a Hopi courier a few years ago to prehistoric\r\nruins in the Navajo National Monument to obtain water from an ancestral\r\nspring for use in a Hopi religious ceremonial. If these traditions are\r\nfounded in fact, the promising civilization of the Mesa Verde has sadly\r\nretrograded in its transplanting. Hopi architecture and masonry shows\r\nmarked retrogression from the splendid types of the Mesa Verde.\r\n\r\nWhen the telephone-line was under construction to connect the park with\r\nthe outside world, the Indians from the adjoining Ute reservation became\r\nsuspicious and restless. Upon hearing its purpose, they begged the\r\nsuperintendent not to go on with the work, which was certain to bring\r\nevil to the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"The little people,\" they solemnly declared, \"will not like it.\"\r\n\r\nThey assured the superintendent that the wires would not talk.\r\n\r\n\"The little people will not let them talk,\" they told him.\r\n\r\nBut the line was completed and the wires talked.\r\n\r\nThe park is reached by motor and rail. From Denver, Salt Lake City, and\r\nSanta Fe railroad routes offer choice of some of the biggest country of\r\nthe Rockies. From either direction a night is spent en route in a\r\nmountain mining-town, an experience which has its usefulness in\r\npreparation for the contrasted and unusual experience to come. Entrance\r\nis through Mancos, from which motor-stages thread the maze of canyons\r\nand mesas from the highlands of the northern border to the deep canyons\r\nof the south where cluster the ruins of distinction.\r\n\r\nThis entry is delightful. The road crosses the northern boundary at the\r\nbase of a lofty butte known as Point Lookout, the park's highest\r\nelevation. Encircling its eastern side and crossing the Morefield Canyon\r\nthe road perches for several miles upon the sinuous crest of a ridge\r\nmore than eight thousand feet in altitude, whose north side plunges\r\neighteen hundred feet into the broad Montezuma Valley, and whose gentle\r\nsouthern slope holds the small beginnings of the great canyons of the\r\ncliff-dwellers. Both north and south the panorama unfolds in impressive\r\ngrandeur, eloquent of the beautiful scanty land and of the difficult\r\nconditions of living which confronted the sturdy builders whose ancient\r\nmasterpieces we are on our way to see. At the northern end of Chapin\r\nMesa we swing sharply south and follow its slope, presently entering the\r\nwarm, glowing, scented forests, through which we speed to the hotel-camp\r\nperched upon a bluff overlooking the depths of Spruce Canyon.\r\n\r\nUpon the top and under the eaves of this mesa are found very fine types\r\nof prehistoric civilization. At Mummy Lake, half-way down the mesa, we\r\npassed on the way a good example of pueblo architecture, and within an\r\neasy walk of our terminal camp we find some of the noblest examples of\r\ncliff-dwellings in existence. Here it was, near the head of this remote,\r\nnearly inaccessible, canyon, guarded by nature's ramparts, that\r\naboriginal American genius before the coming of the Anglo-Saxon found\r\nits culminating expression.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit the thoughtful American of to-day enters the Mesa Verde\r\nNational Park and examines its precious memorials.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAlthough the accident of the road brings the traveller first to the\r\nmesa-top pueblos of the Mummy Lake district, historical sequence\r\nsuggests that examination begin with the cliff-dwellings.\r\n\r\nOf the many examples of these remains in the park, Cliff Palace, Spruce\r\nTree House, and Balcony House are the most important because they\r\nconcisely and completely cover the range of life and the fulness of\r\ndevelopment. This is not the place for detailed descriptions of these\r\nruins. The special publications of the National Park Service and\r\nparticularly the writings of Doctor J. Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, who has devoted many years of brilliant investigation to\r\nAmerican prehistoric remains, are obtainable from government sources.\r\nHere we shall briefly consider several types.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, without reference to photographs, to convey a concise\r\nadequate idea of Cliff Palace. Seen from across its canyon the splendid\r\ncrescent-shaped ruin offers to the unaccustomed eye little that is\r\ncommon to modern architecture. Prominently in the foreground, large\r\ncircular wells at once challenge interest. These were the kivas, or\r\nceremonial rooms of the community, centres of the religious activities\r\nwhich counted so importantly in pueblo life. Here it was that men\r\ngathered monthly to worship their gods. In the floors of some kivas are\r\nsmall holes representing symbolically the entrance to the underworld,\r\nand around these from time to time priests doubtless performed archaic\r\nceremonies and communicated with the dead. Each family or clan in the\r\ncommunity is supposed to have had its own kiva.\r\n\r\nThe kiva walls of Cliff Palace show some of the finest prehistoric\r\nmasonry in America. All are subterranean, which in a few instances\r\nnecessitated excavation in floors of solid rock. The roofs were\r\nsupported by pedestals rising from mural banquettes, usually six\r\npedestals to a kiva; the kiva supposed to have belonged to the chiefs\r\nclan had eight pedestals, and one, perhaps belonging to a clan of lesser\r\nprominence, had only two. Several kivas which lack roof-supports may\r\nhave been of different type or used for lesser ceremonials. All except\r\nthese have fireplaces and ventilators. Entrance was by ladder from the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nOther rooms identified are living-rooms, storage-rooms, milling-rooms,\r\nand round and square towers, besides which there are dark rooms of\r\nunknown use and several round rooms which are neither kivas nor towers.\r\nSeveral of the living-rooms have raised benches evidently used for beds,\r\nand in one of them pegs for holding clothing still remain in the walls.\r\nThe rooms are smoothly plastered or painted.\r\n\r\nMills for grinding corn were found in one room in rows; in others,\r\nsingly. The work was done by women, who rubbed the upper stone against\r\nthe lower by hand. The rests for their feet while at work still remain\r\nin place; also the brushes for sweeping up the meal. The small\r\nstorage-rooms had stone doors, carefully sealed with clay to keep out\r\nmice and prevent moisture from spoiling the corn and meal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking buildings in Cliff Palace is the Round Tower,\r\ntwo stories high, which not only was an observatory, as is indicated by\r\nits peep-holes, but also served purposes in religious festivals. Its\r\nmasonry belongs to the finest north of Mexico. The stones are\r\nbeautifully fitted and dressed. The Square Tower which stands at the\r\nsouthern end of the village is four stories high, reaching the roof of\r\nthe cave. The inner walls of its third story are elaborately painted\r\nwith red and white symbols, triangles, zigzags, and parallels, the\r\nsignificance of which is not known.\r\n\r\nThe ledge under which Cliff Palace is built forms a roof that overhangs\r\nthe structure. An entrance, probably the principal one, came from below\r\nto a court at a lower level than the floor, from which access was by\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nSpruce Tree House, which may have been built after Cliff Palace, has a\r\ncircular room with windows which were originally supposed to have been\r\nport-holes for defense. Doctor Fewkes, however, suggests a more probable\r\npurpose, as the position of the room does not specially suggest a\r\nfortress. Through the openings in this room the sun-priest may have\r\nwatched the setting sun to determine the time for ceremonies. The room\r\nwas entered from above, like a kiva. Another room, differing from any in\r\nother cliff-dwellings, has been named the Warriors' Room because, unlike\r\nsleeping-rooms, its bench surrounds three sides, and because, unlike any\r\nother room, it is built above a kiva. Only the exigencies of defense, it\r\nis supposed, would warrant so marked a departure from the prescribed\r\nreligious form of room.\r\n\r\nBalcony House has special interest, apart from its commanding location,\r\nperfection of workmanship and unusual beauty, and because of the\r\ningenuity of the defenses of its only possible entrance. At the top of a\r\nsteep trail a cave-like passage between rocks is walled so as to leave a\r\ndoor capable of admitting only one at a time, behind which two or three\r\nmen could strike down, one by one, an attacking army.\r\n\r\nOut of these simple architectural elements, together with the utensils\r\nand weapons found in the ruins, the imagination readily constructs a\r\npicture of the austere, laborious, highly religious, and doubtless happy\r\nlives led by the earnest people who built these ancient dwellings in the\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nWhen all the neighborhood caves were filled to overflowing with\r\nincreasing population, and generations of peace had wrought a confidence\r\nwhich had not existed when the pioneers had sought safety in caves,\r\nthese people ventured to move out of cliffs and to build upon the tops\r\nof the mesa. Whether all the cave-dwellers were descended from the\r\noriginal pilgrims or whether others had joined them afterward is not\r\nknown, but it seems evident that the separate communities had found some\r\ncommon bond, probably tribal, and perhaps evolved some common\r\ngovernment. No doubt they intermarried. No doubt the blood of many\r\ncliff-dwelling communities mingled in the new communities which built\r\npueblos upon the mesa. In time there were many of these pueblos, and\r\nthey were widely scattered; there are mounds at intervals all over the\r\nMesa Verde. The largest group of pueblos, one infers from the number of\r\nvisible mounds, was built upon the Chapin Mesa several miles north of\r\nthe above-mentioned cliff-dwelling near a reservoir known to-day as\r\nMummy Lake. It is there, then, that we shall now go in continuation of\r\nour story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREHISTORIC POTTERY FROM MESA VERDE\r\n\r\nColoring and design as well as form show high artistic sense and clean\r\nworkmanship]\r\n\r\nMummy Lake is not a lake and no mummies were ever found there. This\r\nold-time designation applies to an artificial depression surrounded by a\r\nlow rude stone wall, much crumbled, which was evidently a storage\r\nreservoir for an irrigation system of some size. A number of conspicuous\r\nmounds in the neighborhood suggest the former existence of a village of\r\npueblos dependent upon the farms for which the irrigation system had\r\nbeen built. One of these, from which a few stones protruded, was\r\nexcavated in 1916 by Doctor Fewkes, and has added a new and important\r\nchapter to the history of this people. This pueblo has been named Far\r\nView House. Its extensive vista includes four other groups of similar\r\nmounds. Each cluster occurs in the fertile sage-brush clearings which\r\nbloom in summer with asters and Indian paint-brush; there is no doubt\r\nthat good crops of Indian corn could still be raised from these sands\r\nto-day by dry-farming methods.\r\n\r\nFar View House is a pueblo, a hundred and thirteen feet long by more\r\nthan fifty feet wide, not including a full-length plaza about\r\nthirty-five feet wide in which religious dances are supposed to have\r\ntaken place. The differences between this fine structure and the\r\ncliff-cities are considerable. The most significant evidence of\r\nprogress, perhaps, is the modern regularity of the ground-plan. The\r\npartitions separating the secular rooms are continuous through the\r\nbuilding, and the angles are generally accurately right angles.\r\n\r\nThe pueblo had three stories. It is oriented approximately to the\r\ncardinal points and was terraced southward to secure a sunny exposure.\r\nThe study of the solar movements became an advanced science with these\r\npeople in the latter stages of their development. It must be remembered\r\nthat they had no compasses; knowing nothing of the north or any other\r\nfixed point, nevertheless there is evidence that they successfully\r\nworked out the solstices and planned their later buildings accurately\r\naccording to cardinal points of their own calculation.\r\n\r\nAnother difference indicating development is the decrease in the number\r\nof kivas, and the construction of a single very large kiva in the middle\r\nof the building. Its size suggests at once that the individual clan\r\norganization of cliff-dwelling days had here given place to a single\r\npriestly fraternity, sociologically a marked advance. Drawing parallels\r\nwith the better-known customs of other primitive people, we are at\r\nliberty, if we please, to infer similar progress in other directions.\r\nThe original primitive communism was developing naturally, though\r\ndoubtless very slowly, into something akin to organized society,\r\nprobably involving more complicated economic relationships in all\r\ndepartments of living.\r\n\r\nWhile their masonry did not apparently improve in proportion, Far View\r\nHouse shows increase in the number and variety of the decorative figures\r\nincised on hewn stones. The spiral, representing the coiled serpent,\r\nappears a number of times, as do many combinations of squares, curves,\r\nand angles arranged in fanciful design, which may or may not have had\r\nsymbolic meanings.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the neighborhood discloses few details of the\r\nirrigation system, but it shows a cemetery near the southeast corner of\r\nthe building in which the dead were systematically buried.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of minor antiquities were found in this interesting\r\nstructure. Besides the usual stone implements of the mason and the\r\nhousekeeper, many instruments of bone, such as needles, dirks, and\r\nbodkins, were found. Figurines of several kinds were unearthed, carved\r\nfrom soft stone, including several intended to symbolize Indian corn;\r\nall these may have been idols. Fragments of pottery were abundant, in\r\nfull variety of form, decoration, and color, but always the most ancient\r\ntypes. Among the bones of animals, the frequency of those of rabbits,\r\ndeer, antelope, elk, and mountain-sheep indicate that meat formed no\r\ninconsiderable part of the diet. Fabrics and embroideries were not\r\ndiscovered, as in the cliff-dwellings, but they may have disappeared in\r\nthe centuries through exposure to the elements.\r\n\r\nFar View House may not show the highest development of the Mummy Lake\r\ncluster of pueblos, and further exhumations here and in neighboring\r\ngroups may throw further light upon this interesting people in their\r\ngropings from darkness to light. Meantime, however, returning to the\r\nneighborhood of the cliff-dwellings, let us examine a structure so late\r\nin the history of these people that they left it unfinished.\r\n\r\nSun Temple stands on a point of Chapin Mesa, somewhat back from the\r\nedge of Cliff Canyon, commanding an extraordinary range of country. It\r\nis within full view of Cliff Palace and other cliff-dwellings of\r\nimportance and easy of access. From it, one can look southward to the\r\nMancos River. On every side a wide range of mesa and canyon lies in full\r\nview. The site is unrivalled for a temple in which all could worship\r\nwith devotion.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Fewkes, in the early summer of 1915, attacked the mound\r\nwhich had been designated Community House under the supposition that it\r\ncovered a ruined pueblo, he had no idea of the extraordinary nature of\r\nthe find awaiting him, although he was prepared from its shape and other\r\nindications for something out of the usual. So wholly without parallel\r\nwas the disclosure, however, that it was not till it was entirely\r\nuncovered that he ventured a public conjecture as to its significance.\r\nThe ground-plan of Sun Temple is shaped like the letter D. It encloses\r\nanother D-shaped structure occupying nearly two-thirds of its total\r\narea, within which are two large kivas. Between the outer and the inner\r\nD are passages and rooms, and at one end a third kiva is surrounded by\r\nrooms, one of which is circular.\r\n\r\nSun Temple is also impressive in size. It is a hundred and twenty-one\r\nfeet long and sixty-four feet wide. Its walls average four feet in\r\nthickness, and are double-faced, enclosing a central core of rubble;\r\nthey are built of the neighborhood sandstone. The masonry is of fine\r\nquality. This, together with its symmetrical architectural design, its\r\nfine proportions, and its many decorated stones, mark it the highest\r\ntype of Mesa Verde architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by George L. Beam_\r\n\r\nSUN TEMPLE, MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nBuilt by prehistoric people to their god, the sun, and unfinished when\r\nthey suddenly disappeared]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by George L. Beam_\r\n\r\nSPRUCE TREE HOUSE FROM ACROSS THE CANYON\r\n\r\nShowing the overhanging rock roof and the forest which tops the Mesa\r\nVerde]\r\n\r\nIt was plainly unfinished. Walls had risen in some places higher than\r\nin others. As yet there was no roofing. No rooms had been plastered. Of\r\ninternal finishing little was completed, and of contents, of course,\r\nthere was none. The stone hammers and other utensils of the builders\r\nwere found lying about as if thrown down at day's close.\r\n\r\nThe kivas, although circular, are unlike those of Cliff Palace, inasmuch\r\nas they are above ground, not subterranean. The mortar used in pointing\r\nshows the impress of human hands; no trowels were used. The walls\r\nexhibit many stones incised with complicated designs, largely geometric;\r\nsome may be mason's marks; others are decorative or symbolic. These\r\ndesigns indicate a marked advance over those in Far View House; in fact\r\nthey are far more complicated and artistic than any in the southwest.\r\n\r\nBare and ineloquent though its unfinished condition left it, the\r\nreligious purposes of the entire building are clear to the archaeologist\r\nin its form. And, as if to make conjecture certainty, a shrine was\r\nuncovered on the corner-stone of the outer wall which frames in solid\r\nstone walls a large fossil palm-leaf whose rays strongly suggest the\r\nsun!\r\n\r\nIt requires no imagination to picture the effect which the original\r\ndiscovery of this image of their god must have had upon a primitive\r\ncommunity of sun-worshippers. It must have seemed to them a divine gift,\r\na promise, like the Ark of the Covenant, of the favor of the Almighty.\r\nIt may even have first suggested the idea of building this temple to\r\ntheir deity.\r\n\r\nThis is all the story. Go there and study it in detail. Enlightened,\r\nprofoundly impressed, nevertheless you will finish at this point. The\r\ntale has no climax. It just stops.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the people of the Mesa Verde?\r\n\r\nSome archaeologists believe that they emigrated to neighboring valleys\r\nsouthwest. But why should they have left their prosperous farms and fine\r\nhomes for regions which seem to us less desirable? And why, a profoundly\r\nreligious people, should they have left Sun Temple unfinished?\r\n\r\nWhat other supposition remains?\r\n\r\nOnly, I think, that, perhaps because of their prosperity and the\r\nunpreparedness that accompanies long periods of peace, they were\r\nsuddenly overwhelmed by enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE HEALING WATERS\r\n\r\nHOT SPRINGS RESERVATION, ARKANSAS. PLATT NATIONAL PARK, OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFrom a hillside on the edge of the Ozark Mountains in central Arkansas\r\nissue springs of hot water which are effective in the alleviation of\r\nrheumatic and kindred ills. Although chemical analysis fails to explain\r\nthe reason, the practice of many years has abundantly proved their\r\nworth. Before the coming of the white man they were known to the\r\nIndians, who are said to have proclaimed them neutral territory in time\r\nof war. Perhaps it was rumor of their fame upon which Ponce de Leon\r\nfounded his dream of a Fountain of Youth.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the last century hundreds of settlers toiled many\r\nmiles over forest trails to camp beside them and bathe daily in their\r\nwaters. The bent and suffering were carried there on stretchers. So many\r\nand so striking were the cures that the fame of these springs spread\r\nthroughout the young nation, and in 1832, to prevent their falling into\r\nhands outstretched to seize and exploit them for private gain, Congress\r\ncreated them a national reservation. The Hot Springs Reservation was our\r\nfirst national park.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this a couple of log houses built by visitors served for\r\nshelter for the pilgrims at the shrine of health. Soon after, other\r\nbuildings quite as primitive were erected. A road was constructed\r\nthrough the forests from the settled portions of the State, and many\r\ndrove laboriously in with tents and camping outfits. I have seen a copy\r\nof a photograph which was taken when photographs were new, showing\r\nseveral men and women in the odd conventional costume of that period\r\nsitting solemnly upon the banks of a steaming spring, their clothes\r\ndrawn up, their bare legs calf deep in the hot water.\r\n\r\nOnce started, Hot Springs grew rapidly. Unfortunately, this first act of\r\nnational conservation failed to foresee the great future of these\r\nsprings, and the reservation line was drawn so that it barely enclosed\r\nthe brook of steaming vapors which was their outlet. To-day, when the\r\nnation contemplates spending millions to beautify the national spa, it\r\nfinds the city built solidly opposite.\r\n\r\nRailroads soon pushed their way through the Ozark foothills and landed\r\nthousands yearly beside the healing waters. Hotels became larger and\r\nmore numerous. The government built a public bathhouse into which the\r\nwaters were piped for the free treatment of the people. Concessioners\r\nbuilt more elaborate structures within the reservation to accommodate\r\nthose who preferred to pay for pleasanter surroundings or for private\r\ntreatment. The village became a town and the town a city.\r\nBoarding-houses sprang up everywhere with accommodations to suit the\r\nneeds of purses of all lengths. Finally, large and costly hotels were\r\nbuilt for the prosperous and fashionable who began to find rare\r\nenjoyment in the beautiful Ozark country while they drank their hot\r\nwater and took their invigorating baths. Hot Springs became a national\r\nresort.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, in its way, Hot Springs has reflected the social\r\ndevelopment of the country. It has passed through the various stages\r\nthat marked the national growth in taste and morals. During the period\r\nwhen gambling was a national vice it was noted for its high play, and\r\nthen gamblers of all social grades looked forward to their season in the\r\nSouth. During the period of national dissipation, when polite\r\ndrunkenness was a badge of class and New Year's day an orgy, it became\r\nthe periodic resort of inebriates, just as later, with the elevation of\r\nthe national moral sense, it became instead the most conservative of\r\nresorts, the periodic refuge of thousands of work-worn business and\r\nprofessional men seeking the astonishing recuperative power of its\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTrue again to the spirit of the times, Hot Springs reflects to the full\r\nthe spirit of to-day. It is a Southern mountain resort of quiet charm\r\nand wonderful natural beauty set on the edge of a broad region of hills,\r\nravines, and sweet-smelling pines, a paradise for the walker, the hiker,\r\nand the horseback rider. Down on the street a long row of handsome\r\nmodern bath-houses, equipped with all the scientific luxuries, and more\r\nbesides, of the most elaborate European spa, concentrates the business\r\nof bath and cure. Back of this rise directly the beautiful Ozark hills.\r\nOne may have exactly what he wishes at Hot Springs. He may live with the\r\nsick if that is his bent, or he may spend weeks of rich enjoyment of the\r\nSouth in holiday mood, and have his baths besides, without a suggestion\r\nof the sanitarium or even of the spa.\r\n\r\nMeantime the mystery of the water's potency seems to have been solved.\r\nIt is not chemical in solution which clears the system of its ills and\r\nrestores the jaded tissues to buoyancy, but the newly discovered\r\nprinciple of radioactivity. Somewhere deep in Nature's laboratory these\r\nwaters become charged with an uplifting power which is imparted to those\r\nwho bathe according to the rules which many years of experience have\r\nprescribed. Many physicians refuse to verify the waters' virtues; some\r\nopenly scoff. But the fact stands that every year hundreds who come\r\nhelpless cripples walk jauntily to the station on their departure, and\r\nmany thousands of sufferers from rheumatic ills and the wear and tear of\r\nstrenuous living return to their homes restored. I myself can testify to\r\nthe surprising recuperative effect of only half a dozen daily baths, and\r\nI know business men who habitually go there whenever the stress of\r\noverwork demands measures of quick relief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON HOT SPRINGS MOUNTAIN, HOT SPRINGS OF ARKANSAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATH HOUSE ROW, HOT SPRINGS OF ARKANSAS]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that more than a hundred thousand persons visit\r\nHot Springs every year. The recognized season begins after the winter\r\nholidays; then it is that gayety and pleasuring, riding, driving,\r\nmotoring, golfing, and the social life of the fashionable hotels reach\r\ntheir height. But, for sheer enjoyment of the quieter kind, the spring,\r\nearly summer, and the autumn are unsurpassed; south though it lies, Hot\r\nSprings is delightful even in midsummer.\r\n\r\nTwo railroads land the visitor almost at the entrance of the\r\nreservation. A fine road brings the motorist sixty miles from the lively\r\ncity of Little Rock. The elaborate bath-houses line the reservation side\r\nof the principal street, opposite the brick city. But back of them rises\r\nabruptly the beautiful forested mountain from whose side gush the\r\nhealing waters, and back of this roll the beautiful pine-grown Ozarks.\r\nThe division is sharply drawn. He who chooses may forget the city except\r\nat the hour of his daily bath.\r\n\r\nThe plans for realizing in stone and landscape gardening the ideal of\r\nthe great American spa, which this spot is in fact, contemplate the work\r\nof years.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn southern Oklahoma not far from the Texas boundary, a group of thirty\r\nhealing springs, these of cold sparkling water, were set apart by\r\nCongress in 1904 under the title of the Platt National Park. Most of\r\nthem are sulphur springs; others are impregnated with bromides and other\r\nmineral salts. Many thousands visit yearly the prosperous bordering city\r\nof Sulphur to drink these waters; many camp in or near the reservation;\r\nthe bottled waters bring relief to thousands at home.\r\n\r\nThrough the national park, from its source in the east to its entry into\r\nRock Creek, winds Travertine Creek, the outlet of most of these springs.\r\nRock Creek outlines the park's western boundary, and on its farther bank\r\nlies the city. Springs of importance within the park pour their waters\r\ndirectly into its current. All these Platt springs, like those of Hot\r\nSprings, Arkansas, were known to the Indians for their curative\r\nproperties for many generations before the coming of the white settler.\r\n\r\nThe park is the centre of a region of novelty and charm for the visitor\r\nfrom the North and East. The intimate communion of prairie and rich\r\nforested valley, the sophistication of the bustling little city in\r\ncontrast with the rough life of the outlying ranches, the mingling in\r\ncommon intercourse of such differing human elements as the Eastern\r\ntourist, the free and easy Western townsman, the cowboy and the Indian,\r\ngive rare spice to a visit long enough to impart the spirit of a country\r\nof so many kinds of appeal. The climate, too, contributes to enjoyment.\r\nThe long spring lasts from February to June. During the short summer,\r\nsocial life is at its height. The fall lingers to the holidays before it\r\ngives way to a short winter, which the Arbuckle Mountains soften by\r\ndiverting the colder winds.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures are those of prairie and valley. It is a great land for\r\nriding. There is swimming, rowing, and excellent black-bass fishing in\r\nthe larger lakes. It is a region of deer and many birds. Its altitude\r\nis about a thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe rolling Oklahoma plateau attains in this neighborhood its\r\npleasantest outline and variety. Broad plains of grazing-land alternate\r\nwith bare rocky heights and low mountains. The creeks and rivers which\r\naccumulate the waters of the springs scattered widely among these\r\nprairie hills are outlined by winding forested belts and flowered\r\nthickets of brush. Great areas of thin prairie yield here and there to\r\nrounded hills, some of which bear upon their summits columns of flat\r\nrocks heaped one upon the other high enough to be seen for miles against\r\nthe low horizon.\r\n\r\nThese, which are known as the Chimney Hills, for many years have been a\r\ncause of speculation among the settlers who have nearly replaced the\r\nIndians since the State of Oklahoma replaced the Indian Territory with\r\nwhich we became familiar in the geographies of earlier days. Who were\r\nthe builders of these chimneys and what was their purpose?\r\n\r\n\"At a hearing in Ardmore a few years ago before a United States court\r\ntaking testimony upon some ancient Indian depredation claims,\" writes\r\nColonel R.A. Sneed, for years the superintendent of the Platt National\r\nPark, \"practically all the residents of the Chickasaw Nation, Indian and\r\nnegro, whose memories of that country extend back fifty years or more,\r\nwere in attendance. In recounting his recollections of a Comanche raid\r\nin which his master's horses were stolen, one old negro incidentally\r\ngave a solution of the Chimney Hills which is the only one the writer\r\never heard, and which probably accounts for all of them.\r\n\r\n\"He said that his master lived at Big Sulphur Springs, farthest west of\r\nany of the Chickasaws; that the Kiowas and Comanches raided the country\r\nevery summer and drove out horses or cattle wherever they could find\r\nthem unprotected; that he had often gone with his master to find these\r\nstolen cattle; that these forages were so frequent that the Chickasaws\r\nhad never undertaken to occupy any of their lands west of Rock Creek,\r\nnorth of Big Sulphur Springs, nor west of the Washita River south of the\r\nsprings; that the country west of Sulphur Springs was dry, and water was\r\nhard to find unless one knew just where to look; and that the Comanches\r\nhad a custom of marking all the springs they could find by building rock\r\nchimneys on the hills nearest to the springs. Only one chimney would be\r\nbuilt if the spring flowed from beneath the same hill, but if the spring\r\nwas distant from the hill two chimneys would be built, either upon the\r\nsame hill or upon two distant hills, and a sight along the two chimneys\r\nwould indicate a course toward the spring.\r\n\r\n\"The old man said that every hill in their pasture had a Comanche\r\nchimney on it and that his master would not disturb them because he did\r\nnot want to make the wild Indians mad. There never was open war between\r\nthe Chickasaws and the Comanches, but individual Chickasaws often had\r\ntrouble with Comanche hunting-parties.\r\n\r\n\"The Big Sulphur Springs on Rock Creek in the Chickasaw Nation\r\nafterward became the centre around which the city of Sulphur was built,\r\nand after the town was grown to a population of two thousand or more it\r\nwas removed bodily to make room for the Platt National Park, around\r\nwhich has been built the new city of Sulphur, which now has a population\r\nof forty-five hundred.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the Comanche monuments are extant and the great bluff above the\r\nBromide Springs of the national park looks out toward the north and west\r\nover a prairie that extends to the Rocky Mountains; the monument that\r\nstood on the brow of that bluff must have been visible for many miles to\r\nthe keen vision of the Comanche who knew how to look for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian Territory became the State of Oklahoma in 1907; the story of\r\nthe white man's peaceful invasion is one of absorbing interest; the\r\nhuman spectacle of to-day is complex, even kaleidoscopic. In the\r\nthirties and forties the government had established in the territory the\r\nfive civilized Indian nations, the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws,\r\nCreeks, and Seminoles, each with its allotted boundaries, its native\r\ngovernment, its legislatures, and its courts. In many respects these\r\nwere foreign nations within our boundaries. Besides them, the Osage\r\nIndians had their reservation in the north, and fragments of no less\r\nthan seventeen other tribes lived on assigned territory.\r\n\r\nGradually white men invaded the land, purchased holdings from the\r\nIndian nations, built cities, established businesses of many kinds, ran\r\nrailroads in all directions. In time, the nations were abolished and\r\ntheir remaining lands were divided up among the individuals composing\r\nthem; the Indians of these nations became American citizens; their negro\r\nslaves, for they had been large slaveholders, received each his portion\r\nof the divided land. Then came Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nTo-day there is only one Indian reservation in the State, that of the\r\nOsages. Oil has been found on their land and they are the wealthiest\r\npeople in the world to-day, the average cash income of each exceeding\r\nfive thousand dollars a year. In a state with a total population of two\r\nand a quarter millions live 336,000 Indians representing twenty-three\r\ntribes and 110,000 negroes descended from slaves. There has been much\r\nintermarrying between Indians and whites, and some between Indians and\r\nblacks. Here is a mixture of races to baffle the keenest eye.\r\n\r\nElsewhere than in the Osage Reservation, wealth also has come to the\r\nIndians. Many have very large incomes, large even for the rich of our\r\nEastern cities. Asphalt also has enriched many. Cotton is raised\r\nextensively in the southern counties. Grazing on a large scale has\r\nproved profitable. Many Indians own costly and luxurious homes, ride in\r\nautomobiles, and enter importantly into business, politics, and the\r\nprofessions; these usually have more or less white blood. Many\r\nfull-bloods who have grown rich without effort possess finely furnished\r\nbedrooms, and sleep on the floor in blankets; elaborate dining-rooms\r\nwith costly table equipments, and eat cross-legged on the kitchen floor;\r\ngas-ranges, and cook over chip fires out-of-doors; automobiles, and ride\r\nblanketed ponies. Many wealthy men are deeply in debt because of useless\r\nluxuries which they have been persuaded to buy.\r\n\r\nPlatt National Park lies about the centre of what was once the Chickasaw\r\nnation. It is a grazing and a cotton country. There are thousands of\r\nIndians, many of them substantial citizens, some men of local influence.\r\nNative dress is seldom seen.\r\n\r\nQuoting again from my correspondence with Colonel Sneed, here is the\r\nlegend of the last of the Delawares:\r\n\r\n\"Along about 1840, a very few years after the Chickasaws and Choctaws\r\nhad arrived in Indian Territory, a small band of about sixty Delaware\r\nIndians arrived in the Territory, having roved from Alabama through\r\nMississippi and Missouri, and through the northwest portion of Arkansas.\r\nBeing a small band, they decided to link their fortunes with those of\r\nsome other tribe of Indians, and they first pitched their tepees with\r\nthose of the Cherokees. But the Cherokee Chief and old Chief Wahpanucka\r\nof the Delawares did not agree. So the little band of Delawares\r\ncontinued rambling until they reached the Choctaw Nation, where they\r\nagain tried to make terms with the Chief of the tribe. Evidently no\r\nagreement was reached between that Chief and Wahpanucka, for the\r\nDelawares continued their roving until they reached the Chickasaw\r\nNation, where they remained.\r\n\r\n\"Old Chief Wahpanucka had a beautiful daughter whose name was Deerface;\r\ntwo of the Delaware braves were much in love with her, but Deerface\r\ncould not decide which one of these warriors she should take to become\r\nChief after the death of Wahpanucka.\r\n\r\n\"Chief Wahpanucka called the two warriors before him and a powwow was\r\nagreed upon. The council was held around the Council Rocks (which is now\r\na point of interest within the Platt National Park), and a decision was\r\nreached to the effect that at a certain designated time the Delawares\r\nshould all assemble on the top of the Bromide Cliff, at the foot of\r\nwhich flow the now famous Bromide and Medicine Springs, and that the two\r\nbraves should ride their Indian ponies to the edge of the cliff, which\r\nwas at that time known as Medicine Bluff, and jump off to the bed of the\r\ncreek about two hundred feet below. The one who survived was to marry\r\nDeerface, and succeed Wahpanucka as Chief of the Delawares.\r\n\r\n\"The race was run and both Indian braves made the jump from the bluff,\r\nbut both were killed. When Deerface saw this she threw herself from the\r\nbluff and died at the foot of the cliff where her lovers had met their\r\ndeath. To-day her image may be seen indelibly fixed on one of the rocks\r\nof the cliff where she fell, and the water of the Medicine Spring is\r\nsupposed to be the briny tears of the old Chief when he saw the havoc\r\nhis decision had wrought. These tears, filtering down through the cliff\r\nwhere the old Chief stood, are credited with being so purified that the\r\nwater of the spring which they form is possessed with remedial qualities\r\nwhich make it a cure for all human ailments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON AND OUR NATIONAL MONUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE SCENERY OF THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n\r\nTo most Americans the southwest means the desert, and it is true that\r\nmost of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, and portions of Colorado and\r\nsouthern California, are arid or semiarid lands, relieved, however, by\r\nregions of fertility and agricultural prosperity. In popular conception\r\nthe desert has been the negative of all that means beauty, richness, and\r\nsublimity; it has been the synonym of poverty and death. Gradually but\r\nsurely the American public is learning that again popular conception is\r\nwrong, that the desert is as positive a factor in scenery as the\r\nmountain, that it has its own glowing beauty, its own intense\r\npersonality, and occasionally, in its own amazing way, a sublimity as\r\ngorgeous, as compelling, and as emotion-provoking as the most stupendous\r\nsnow-capped range.\r\n\r\nThe American desert region includes some of the world's greatest\r\nscenery. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is sunk in a plateau\r\nwhich, while sprinkled with scant pine, is nearly rainless. Zion Canyon\r\nis a palette of brilliant color lying among golden sands. A score of\r\nnational monuments conserve large natural bridges, forests of petrified\r\ntrees, interesting volcanic or other phenomena of prehistoric times,\r\nareas of strange cactus growths, deposits of the bones of monstrous\r\nreptiles, and remains of a civilization which preceded the discovery of\r\nAmerica; and, in addition to these, innumerable places of remarkable\r\nmagnificence as yet unknown except to the geologist, the topographer,\r\nthe miner, the Indian, and the adventurer in unfrequented lands.\r\n\r\nThis arid country consists of rolling sandy plains as broad as seas,\r\ndotted with gray sage-brush and relieved by bare craggy monadnocks and\r\nnaked ranges which the rising and the setting sun paints unbelievable\r\ncolors. Here and there thin growths of cottonwood outline thin ribbons\r\nof rivers, few and far between. Here and there alkali whitens the edges\r\nof stained hollows where water lies awhile after spring cloudbursts.\r\nHere and there are salt ponds with no outlet. Yet even in the desolation\r\nof its tawny monotony it has a fascination which is insistent and\r\ncumulative.\r\n\r\nBut the southwest is not all desert. There are great areas of thin\r\ngrazing ranges and lands where dry farming yields fair crops. There are\r\nvalleys which produce fruits and grains in abundance. There are hamlets\r\nand villages and cities which are among the oldest in America, centres\r\nof fertile tracts surrounded by deserts which need only water to become\r\nthe richest lands on the continent. There are regions reclaimed by\r\nirrigation where farming has brought prosperity. In other places the\r\nplateau covers itself for hundreds of square miles with scrubby pine and\r\ncedar.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it is a land of rare charm and infinite variety.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate a region which more and more will enter into American\r\nconsciousness and divide travel with the mountains, the reader should\r\nknow something of its structural history.\r\n\r\nThe southwestern part of the United States rose above sea-level and sank\r\nbelow it many times during the many thousands of centuries preceding its\r\npresent state, which is that of a sandy and generally desert plateau,\r\nfive to ten thousand feet in altitude. How many times it repeated the\r\ncycle is not fully known. Some portions of it doubtless were submerged\r\noftener than others. Some were lifting while others were lowering. And,\r\nmeantime, mountains rose and were carried away by erosion to give place\r\nto other mountains which also wore away; river systems formed and\r\ndisappeared, lakes and inland seas existed and ceased to exist. The\r\nhistory of our southwest would have been tempestuous indeed had it been\r\ncompassed within say the life of one man; but, spread over a period of\r\ntime inconceivable to man, there may have been no time when it might\r\nhave seemed to be more active in change than its still hot deserts seem\r\nto-day to the traveller in passing trains.\r\n\r\nOther parts of the continent, no doubt, have undergone as many changes;\r\nour southwest is not singular in that. But nowhere else, perhaps, has\r\nthe change left evidences so plain and so interesting to the\r\nunscientific observer. The page of earth's history is more easily read\r\nupon the bare deserts of our southwest than on the grass-concealed\r\nprairies of the Mississippi Valley or the eroded and forested ranges of\r\nthe Appalachians.\r\n\r\nBefore the Rockies and the Sierra even existed, in the shallow sea which\r\ncovered this part of the continent were deposited the ooze which later,\r\nwhen this region rose above the sea, became the magnificent limestones\r\nof the Grand Canyon. Muds accumulated which to-day are seen in many\r\nhighly colored shales. Long ages of erosion from outlying mountain\r\nregions spread it thick with gravels and sands which now appear in rocky\r\nwalls of deep canyons. A vast plain was built up and graded by these\r\ndeposits. The trunks of trees washed down by the floods from far distant\r\nuplands were buried in these muds and sands, where, in the course of\r\nunnumbered centuries, they turned to stone. They are the petrified\r\nforests of to-day.\r\n\r\nMountains, predecessors of our modern Sierra, lifted in the south and\r\nwest, squeezed the moisture from the Pacific winds, and turned the\r\nregion into desert. This was in the Jurassic Period. Sands thousands of\r\nfeet deep were accumulated by the desert winds which are to-day the\r\nsandstones of the giant walls of Zion Canyon.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the last desert, for again the region sank below the\r\nsea. Again for half a million years or more ooze settled upon the sands\r\nto turn to limestone millions of years later. In this Jurassic sea\r\nsported enormous marine monsters whose bones settled to the bottom to be\r\nunearthed in our times, and great flying reptiles crossed its water.\r\n\r\nAgain the region approached sea-level and accumulated, above its new\r\nlimestones, other beds of sands. New river systems formed and brought\r\nother accumulations from distant highlands. It was then a low swampy\r\nplain of enormous size, whose northern limits reached Montana, and which\r\ntouched what now is Kansas on its east. Upon the borders of its swamps,\r\nin Cretaceous times, lived gigantic reptiles, the Dinosaurs and their\r\nungainly companions whose bones are found to-day in several places.\r\n\r\nFor the last time the region sank and a shallow sea swept from the Gulf\r\nof Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Again new limestones formed, and as the\r\nsurface very slowly rose for the last time at the close of the\r\nCretaceous Period many new deposits were added to the scenic exhibit of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nMeantime other startling changes were making which extended over a lapse\r\nof time which human mind cannot grasp. Responding to increasing\r\npressures from below, the continent was folding from north to south. The\r\nmiracle of the making of the Rockies was enacting.\r\n\r\nDuring all of Tertiary times earth movements of tremendous energy rocked\r\nand folded the crust and hastened change. The modern Sierra rose upon\r\nthe eroded ruins of its predecessor, again shutting off the\r\nmoisture-laden western winds and turning the southwest again into a\r\ndesert. One of the mountain-building impulses spread eastward from the\r\nSierra to the Wasatch Mountains, but Nature's project for this vast\r\ngranite-cored tableland never was realized, for continually its central\r\nsections caved and fell. And so it happened that the eastern edge of the\r\nSierra and the western edge of the Wasatch Mountains became the\r\nprecipitous edges, thousands of feet high, of a mountain-studded desert\r\nwhich to-day is called the Great Basin. It includes southeastern Oregon,\r\nnearly all of Nevada, the western half of Utah, and a large area in the\r\nsouth of California, besides parts of Idaho and Wyoming. It is 880 miles\r\nnorth and south and 572 miles wide. Its elevation is five thousand feet,\r\nmore or less, and its area more than two hundred thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nThis enormous bowl contained no outlet to the sea, and the rivers which\r\nflowed into it from all its mountainous borders created a prehistoric\r\nlake with an area of fifty-four thousand square miles which was named\r\nLake Bonneville after the army officer whose adventures in 1833 were\r\nnarrated by Washington Irving; but it was Fremont who first clearly\r\ndescribed it. Lake Bonneville has evaporated and disappeared, but in its\r\nplace are many salty lakes, the greatest of which is Great Salt Lake in\r\nUtah. Attenuated rivers still flow into the Great Basin, but are lost in\r\ntheir sands. The greatest of these, the Mohave River, is a hundred miles\r\nlong, but is not often seen because it hides its waters chiefly under\r\nthe surface sands. Lake Bonneville's prehistoric beaches exist to-day.\r\nTranscontinental passengers by rail cross its ancient bed, but few know\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin to-day is known to travellers principally by the many\r\nlesser deserts which compose it, deserts separated from each other by\r\nlesser mountain ranges and low divides. Its southern and southeastern\r\nboundaries are the plateaus and mountains which form the northern\r\nwatershed of the muddy Colorado River and its confluents. South of the\r\nColorado, the plateaus of New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California\r\ngradually subside to the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nDuring this period and the Quaternary which followed it, volcanoes\r\nappeared in many places; their dead cones diversify our modern\r\nlandscape. It was during the Quaternary Period, in whose latter end\r\nlives man, that erosion dug the mighty canyons of our great southwest.\r\nThe Colorado was sweeping out the Grand Canyon at the same time that,\r\nfar in the north, the glaciers of the Great Ice Age were carving from\r\nAlgonkian shales and limestones the gorgeous cirques and valleys of\r\nGlacier National Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nA PAGEANT OF CREATION\r\n\r\nGRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, ARIZONA. AREA, 958 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one Grand Canyon. It lies in northern Arizona, and the\r\nColorado River, one of the greatest of American rivers, flows through\r\nits inner gorge. It must not be confused with the Grand Canyon of the\r\nYellowstone, or with any of the _grande canyons_ which the Spaniards so\r\nnamed because they were big canyons.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon is 217 miles long, 8 to 12 miles wide at the rim, and\r\nmore than a mile deep. It is the Colossus of canyons, by far the hugest\r\nexample of stream erosion in the world. It is gorgeously colored. It is\r\nby common consent the most stupendous spectacle in the world. It may be\r\nconceived as a mountain range reversed. Could its moulded image,\r\nsimilarly colored, stand upon the desert floor, it would be a spectacle\r\nsecond only to the vast mould itself.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred thousand persons visit the Grand Canyon each year.\r\nIn other lands it is our most celebrated scenic possession. It was made\r\na national park in 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon is not of America but of the world. Like the Desert of\r\nSahara and the monster group of the Himalayas, it is so entirely the\r\ngreatest example of its kind that it refuses limits. This is true of it\r\nalso as a spectacle; far truer, in fact, for, if it is possible to\r\ncompare things so dissimilar, in this respect certainly it will lead all\r\nothers. None see it without being deeply moved--all to silence, some\r\neven to tears. It is charged to the rim with emotion; but the emotion of\r\nthe first view varies. Some stand astounded at its vastness. Others are\r\nstupefied and search their souls in vain for definition. Some tremble.\r\nSome are uplifted with a sense of appalling beauty. For a time the souls\r\nof all are naked in the presence.\r\n\r\nThis reaction is apparent in the writings of those who have visited it;\r\nno other spectacle in America has inspired so large a literature.\r\nJoaquin Miller found it fearful, full of glory, full of God. Charles\r\nDudley Warner pronounced it by far the most sublime of earthly\r\nspectacles. William Winter saw it a pageant of ghastly desolation.\r\nHamlin Garland found its lines chaotic and disturbing but its\r\ncombinations of color and shadow beautiful. Upon John Muir it bestowed a\r\nnew sense of earth's beauty.\r\n\r\nMarius R. Campbell, whose geological researches have familiarized him\r\nwith Nature's scenic gamut, told me that his first day on the rim left\r\nhim emotionally cold; it was not until he had lived with the spectacle\r\nthat realization slowly dawned. I think this is the experience of very\r\nmany, a fact which renders still more tragic a prevailing public\r\nassumption that the Grand Canyon is a one-day stop in a transcontinental\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that wonder is deeply stirred by its vastness, its\r\ncomplexity, and the realization of Nature's titanic labor in its making.\r\nIt is far from strange that extreme elation sometimes follows upon a\r\nrevelation so stupendous and different. That beauty so extraordinary\r\nshould momentarily free emotion from control is natural enough. But why\r\nthe expressions of repulsion not infrequently encountered upon the\r\nprinted pages of the past? I have personally inquired of many of our own\r\nday without finding one, even among the most sensitive, whom it\r\nrepelled. Perhaps a clew is discovered in the introductory paragraphs of\r\nan inspired word-picture which the late Clarence E. Dutton hid in a\r\ntechnical geological paper of 1880. \"The lover of nature,\" he wrote,\r\n\"whose perceptions have been trained in the Alps, in Italy, Germany, or\r\nNew England, in the Appalachians or Cordilleras, in Scotland or\r\nColorado, would enter this strange region with a shock and dwell there\r\nwith a sense of oppression, and perhaps with horror. Whatsoever things\r\nhe had learned to regard as beautiful and noble he would seldom or never\r\nsee, and whatsoever he might see would appear to him as anything but\r\nbeautiful or noble. Whatsoever might be bold or striking would seem at\r\nfirst only grotesque. The colors would be the very ones he had learned\r\nto shun as tawdry or bizarre. The tones and shades, modest and tender,\r\nsubdued yet rich, in which his fancy had always taken special delight,\r\nwould be the ones which are conspicuously absent.\"\r\n\r\nI suspect that this repulsion, this horror, as several have called it,\r\nwas born of the conventions of an earlier generation which bound\r\nconceptions of taste and beauty, as of art, dress, religion, and human\r\nrelations generally, in shackles which do not exist in these days of\r\nindividualism and broad horizons. To-day we see the Grand Canyon with\r\nprofound astonishment but without prejudice. Its amazing size, its\r\nbewildering configuration, its unprecedented combinations of color\r\naffect the freed and elated consciousness of our times as another and\r\nperhaps an ultimate revelation in nature of law, order, and beauty.\r\n\r\nIn these pages I shall make no attempt to describe the Grand Canyon.\r\nNature has written her own description, graving it with a pen of water\r\nin rocks which run the series of the eternal ages. Her story can be read\r\nonly in the original; translations are futile. Here I shall try only to\r\nhelp a little in the reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon was cut by one of the great rivers of the continent,\r\nthe Colorado, which enters Arizona from the north and swings sharply\r\nwest; thence it turns south to form most of Arizona's western boundary,\r\nand a few miles over the Mexican border empties into the head of the\r\nGulf of California. It drains three hundred thousand square miles of\r\nArizona, Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. It is formed in Utah by the\r\nconfluence of the Green and the Grand Rivers. Including the greater of\r\nthese, the Green River, it makes a stream fifteen hundred miles in\r\nlength which collects the waters of the divide south and east of the\r\nGreat Basin and of many ranges of the Rocky Mountain system. The Grand\r\nRiver, for its contribution, collects the drainage of the Rockies'\r\nmighty western slopes in Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe lower reaches of these great tributaries and practically all of the\r\nColorado River itself flow through more than five hundred miles of\r\ncanyons which they were obliged to dig through the slowly upheaving\r\nsandstone plateaus in order to maintain their access to the sea.\r\nSucceeding canyons bear names designating their scenic or geologic\r\ncharacter. Progressively southward they score deeper into the strata of\r\nthe earth's crust until, as they approach their climax, they break\r\nthrough the bottom of the Paleozoic limestone deep into the heart of the\r\nArchean gneiss. This limestone trench is known as the Marble Canyon, the\r\nArchean trench as the Granite Gorge. The lower part of the Marble Canyon\r\nand all the Granite Gorge, together with their broad, vividly colored\r\nand fantastically carved upper canyon ten miles across from rim to rim,\r\na mile high from water to rim-level, the climax of the world of canyons\r\nand the most gorgeous spectacle on earth, is the Grand Canyon of the\r\nColorado. It lies east and west in the northern part of the State.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend it, recall one of those ditches which we all have seen\r\ncrossing level fields or bordering country roads. It is broad from rim\r\nto rim and deeply indented by the side washes which follow heavy\r\nshowers. Its sides descend by terraces, steep in places with gentle\r\nslopes between the steeps, and on these slopes are elevations of rock or\r\nmud which floods have failed to wash away. Finally, in the middle, is\r\nthe narrow trench which now, in dry weather, carries a small trickling\r\nstream. Not only does this ditch roughly typify the Grand Canyon,\r\nreproducing in clumsy, inefficient miniature the basic characteristics\r\nof its outline, but it also is identical in the process of its making.\r\n\r\nImagining it in cross-section, we find its sides leading down by\r\nsuccessive precipices to broad intermediate sloping surfaces. We find\r\nupon these broad surfaces enormous mesas and lofty, ornately carved\r\nedifices of rock which the floods have left standing. We find in its\r\nmiddle, winding snakelike from side to side, the narrow gorge of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThe parallel goes further. It is not at all necessary to conceive that\r\neither the wayside ditch or the Grand Canyon was once brimful of madly\r\ndashing waters. On the contrary, neither may ever have held much greater\r\nstreams than they hold to-day. In both cases the power of the stream has\r\nbeen applied to downward trenching; the greater spreading sides were cut\r\nby the erosion of countless side streamlets resulting temporarily from\r\nperiods of melting snow or of local rainfall. It was these streamlets\r\nwhich cut the side canyons and left standing between them the bold\r\npromontories of the rim. It was these streamlets, working from the\r\nsurface, which separated portions of these promontories from the plateau\r\nand turned them into isolated mesas. It was the erosion of these mesas\r\nwhich turned many of them into the gigantic and fantastic temples and\r\ntowers which rise from the canyon's bowl.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the rim and overlooking miles of these successive\r\nprecipices and intermediate templed levels, we see the dark gorge of the\r\ngranite trench, and, deep within it, wherever its windings permit a view\r\nof its bottom, a narrow ribbon of brown river. This is the Colorado--a\r\nrill; but when we have descended six thousand feet of altitude to its\r\nedge we find it a rushing turbulent torrent of muddy water. Its average\r\nwidth is three hundred feet; its average depth thirty feet. It is\r\nindustriously digging the Grand Canyon still deeper, and perhaps as\r\nrapidly as it ever dug since it entered the granite.\r\n\r\nDeveloping the thought in greater detail, let us glance at the\r\nillustrations of this chapter and at any photographs which may be at\r\nhand, and realization will begin. Let imagination dart back a million\r\nyears or more to the time when this foreground rim and that far run\r\nacross the vast chasm are one continuous plain; perhaps it is a pine\r\nforest, with the river, no greater than to-day, perhaps not so great,\r\nwinding through it close to the surface level. As the river cuts\r\ndownward, the spring floods following the winter snows cave in its banks\r\nhere and there, forming sharply slanted valleys which enclose\r\npromontories between them. Spring succeeds spring, and these side\r\nvalleys deepen and eat backward while the promontories lengthen and\r\ngrow. The harder strata resist the disintegration of alternate heat and\r\ncold, and, while always receding, hold their form as cliffs; the softer\r\nstrata between the cliffs crumbles and the waste of spring waters\r\nspreads them out in long flattened slopes. The centuries pass. The ruin\r\nburies itself deep in the soft sandstone. The side valleys work miles\r\nback into the pine forest. Each valley acquires its own system of\r\nerosion; into each, from either side, enter smaller valleys which\r\nthemselves are eating backward into the promontories.\r\n\r\nThe great valley of the Colorado now has broad converging cliff-broken\r\nsides. Here and there these indentations meet far in the background\r\nbehind the promontories, isolating island-like mesas.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story is simple repetition. Imagine enough thousands of\r\ncenturies and you will imagine the Grand Canyon. Those myriad temples\r\nand castles and barbaric shrines are all that the rains and melting\r\nsnows have left of noble mesas, some of which, when originally isolated,\r\nenclosed, as the marble encloses the future statue, scores of the lesser\r\nbut mighty structures which compose the wonder city of the depths.\r\n\r\nThese architectural operations of Nature may be seen to-day in midway\r\nstages. Find on the map the Powell Plateau in the northwest of the\r\ncanyon. Once it was continuous with the rim, a noble promontory. It was\r\ncut out from the rim perhaps within the existence of the human race. A\r\nfew hundred thousand years from now it will be one or more Aladdin\r\npalaces.\r\n\r\nFind on the map the great Walhalla Plateau in the east of the canyon.\r\nNote that its base is nearly separated from the parental rim; a thousand\r\ncenturies or so and its isolation will be complete. Not long after that,\r\nas geologists reckon length of time, it will divide into two plateaus;\r\nit is easy to pick the place of division. The tourist of a million years\r\nhence will see, where now it stands, a hundred glowing castles.\r\n\r\nLet us look again at our photographs, which now we can see with\r\nunderstanding. To realize the spectacle of the canyon, let imagination\r\npaint these strata their brilliant colors. It will not be difficult; but\r\nhere again we must understand.\r\n\r\nIt is well to recall that these strata were laid in the sea, and that\r\nthey hardened into stone when the earth's skin was pushed thousands of\r\nfeet in air. Originally they were the washings of distant highlands\r\nbrought down by rivers; the coloring of the shales and sandstones is\r\nthat of the parent rock modified, no doubt, by chemical action in\r\nsea-water. The limestone, product of the sea, is gray.\r\n\r\nAs these differently colored strata were once continuous across the\r\ncanyon, it follows that their sequence is practically identical on both\r\nsides of the canyon. That the colors seem confused is because, viewing\r\nthe spectacle from an elevation, we see the enormous indentations of the\r\nopposite rim in broken and disorganized perspective. Few minds are\r\npatient and orderly enough to fully disentangle the kaleidoscopic\r\ndisarray, but, if we can identify the strata by form as well as color,\r\nwe can at least comprehend without trouble our principal outline; and\r\ncomprehension is the broad highway to appreciation.\r\n\r\nTo identify these strata, it is necessary to call them by name. The\r\nnames that geologists have assigned them have no scientific significance\r\nother than identity; they are Indian and local.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the canyon rim we have a stalwart cliff of gray limestone\r\nknown as the Kaibab Limestone, or, conversationally, the Kaibab; it is\r\nabout seven hundred feet thick. Of this product of a million years of\r\nmicroscopic life and death on sea-bottoms is formed the splendid\r\nsouth-rim cliffs from which we view the chasm. Across the canyon it is\r\nalways recognizable as the rim.\r\n\r\nBelow the talus of the Kaibab is the Coconino sandstone, light\r\nyellowish-gray, coarse of grain, the product of swift currents of untold\r\nthousands of centuries ago. This stratum makes a fine bright cliff\r\nusually about four hundred feet in thickness, an effective roofing for\r\nthe glowing reds of the depths.\r\n\r\nImmediately below the Coconino are the splendid red shales and\r\nsandstones known as the Supai formation. These lie in many strata of\r\nvarying shades, qualities, and thicknesses, but all, seen across the\r\ncanyon, merging into a single enormous horizontal body of gorgeous red.\r\nThe Supai measures eleven hundred feet in perpendicular thickness, but\r\nas it is usually seen in slopes which sometimes are long and gentle, it\r\npresents to the eye a surface several times as broad. This is the most\r\nprominent single mass of color in the canyon, for not only does it form\r\nthe broadest feature of the opposite wall and of the enormous\r\npromontories which jut therefrom, but the main bodies of Buddha,\r\nZoroaster, and many others of the fantastic temples which rise from the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nBelow the Supai, a perpendicular wall of intense red five hundred feet\r\nhigh forces its personality upon every foot of the canyon's vast length.\r\nThis is the famous Redwall, a gray limestone stained crimson with the\r\ndrip of Supai dye from above. Harder than the sloping sandstone above\r\nand the shale below, it pushes aggressively into the picture, squared,\r\nperpendicular, glowing. It winds in and out of every bay and gulf, and\r\nfronts precipitously every flaring promontory. It roofs with overhanging\r\neaves many a noble palace and turns many a towering monument into a\r\npagoda.\r\n\r\nNext below in series is the Tonto, a deep, broad, shallow slant of\r\ndull-green and yellow shale, which, with the thin broad sandstone base\r\non which it rests, forms the floor of the outer canyon, the tessellated\r\npavement of the city of flame. Without the Tonto's green the spectacle\r\nof the Grand Canyon would have missed its contrast and its fulness.\r\n\r\nThrough this floor the Granite Gorge winds its serpentine way, two\r\nthousand feet deep, dark with shadows, shining in places where the\r\nriver swings in view.\r\n\r\nThese are the series of form and color. They occur with great regularity\r\nexcept in several spots deep in the canyon where small patches of\r\ngleaming quartzites and brilliant red shales show against the dark\r\ngranite; the largest of these lies in the depths directly opposite El\r\nTovar. These rocks are all that one sees of ancient Algonkian strata\r\nwhich once overlay the granite to a depth of thirteen thousand\r\nfeet--more than twice the present total depth of the canyon. The erosion\r\nof many thousands of centuries wore them away before the rocks that now\r\ncompose the floor, the temples and the precipiced walls of the great\r\ncanyon were even deposited in the sea as sand and limestone ooze, a fact\r\nthat strikingly emphasizes the enormous age of this exhibit. Geologists\r\nspeak of these splashes of Algonkian rocks as the Unkar group, another\r\nlocal Indian designation. There is also a similar Chuar group, which\r\nneed not concern any except those who make a close study of the canyon.\r\n\r\nThis is the picture. The imagination may realize a fleet, vivid\r\nimpression from the photograph. The visitor upon the rim, outline in\r\nhand, may trace its twisting elements in a few moments of attentive\r\nobservation, and thereafter enjoy his canyon as one only enjoys a new\r\ncity when he has mastered its scheme and spirit, and can mentally\r\nclassify its details as they pass before him.\r\n\r\nTo one thus prepared, the Grand Canyon ceases to be the brew-pot of\r\nchaotic emotion and becomes the orderly revelation of Nature, the master\r\ncraftsman and the divine artist.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEntrance is from the south. The motor-road to Grand View is available\r\nfor most of the year. The railroad to the El Tovar Hotel serves the year\r\naround, for the Grand Canyon is an all-year resort. There is a short\r\nwinter of heavy snows on the rim, but not in the canyon, which may be\r\ndescended at all seasons. Both routes terminate on the rim. Always\r\ndramatic, the Grand Canyon welcomes the pilgrim in the full panoply of\r\nits appalling glory. There is no waiting in the anteroom, no sounding of\r\ntrumpets, no ceremony of presentation. He stands at once in the\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nMost visitors have bought tickets at home which permit only one day's\r\nstay. The irrecoverable sensation of the first view is broken by the\r\nnecessity for an immediate decision upon how to spend that day, for if\r\none is to descend horseback to the river he must engage his place and\r\ndon his riding-clothes at once. Under this stress the majority elect to\r\nremain on the rim for reasons wholly apart from any question of\r\nrespective merit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Fred Harvey_\r\n\r\nSUNSET FROM GRAND VIEW, GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nAll the strata from the rim to the river may be seen in this picture]\r\n\r\nAfter all, if only one day is possible, it is the wise decision. With\r\nthe rim road, over which various drives are scheduled, and several\r\ncommanding points to whose precipices one may walk, it will be a day to\r\nremember for a lifetime. One should not attempt too much in this one\r\nday. It is enough to sit in the presence of the spectacle. Fortunate is\r\nhe who may stay another day and descend the trail into the streets of\r\nthis vast city; many times fortunate he who may live a little amid its\r\nglories.\r\n\r\nBecause of this general habit of \"seeing\" the Grand Canyon between\r\nsunrise and sunset, the admirable hotel accommodations are not\r\nextensive, but sufficient. There are cottage accommodations also at\r\ncheaper rates. Hotels and cottages are well patronized summer and\r\nwinter. Upon the rim are unique rest-houses, in one of which is a\r\nhigh-power telescope. There is a memorial altar to John Wesley Powell,\r\nthe first explorer of the canyon. There is an excellent reproduction of\r\na Hopi house. There is an Indian camp. The day's wanderer upon the rim\r\nwill not lack entertainment when his eyes turn for rest from the chasm.\r\n\r\nFrom the hotel, coaches make regular trips daily to various viewpoints.\r\nHopi Point, Mohave Point, Yavapai Point, and Grandeur Point may all be\r\nvisited; the run of eight miles along the famous Hermit Rim Road permits\r\nbrief stops at Hopi, Mohave, and Pima Points. Automobiles also make\r\nregular runs to the gorgeous spectacle from Grand View. Still more\r\ndistant points may be made in private or hired cars. Navajo Point offers\r\nunequalled views up and down the full length of the canyon, and an\r\nautomobile-road will bring the visitor within easy reach of Bass Camp\r\nnear Havasupai Point in the far west of the reservation.\r\n\r\nMany one-day visitors take none of these stage and automobile trips,\r\ncontented to dream the hours away upon Yavapai or Hopi Points near by.\r\nAfter all, it is just as well. A single viewpoint cannot be mastered in\r\none's first day, so what's the use of others? On the other hand, seeing\r\nthe same view from different viewpoints miles apart will enrich and\r\nelaborate it. Besides, one should see many views in order to acquire\r\nsome conception, however small, of the intricacy and grandeur of the\r\ncanyon. Besides, these trips help to rest the eyes and mind. It is hard\r\nindeed to advise the unlucky one-day visitor. It is as if a dyspeptic\r\nshould lead you to an elaborate banquet of a dozen courses, and say: \"I\r\nhave permission to eat three bites. Please help me choose them.\"\r\n\r\nWherever he stands upon the rim the appalling silence hushes the voice\r\nto whispers. No cathedral imposes stillness so complete. It is sacrilege\r\nto speak, almost to move. And yet the Grand Canyon is a moving picture.\r\nIt changes every moment. Always shadows are disappearing here, appearing\r\nthere; shortening here, lengthening there. With every passing hour it\r\nbecomes a different thing. It is a sun-dial of monumental size.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning the light streams down the canyon from the east.\r\nCertain promontories shoot miles into the picture, gleaming in vivid\r\ncolor, backed by dark shadows. Certain palaces and temples stand in\r\nmagnificent relief. The inner gorge is brilliantly outlined in certain\r\nplaces. As the day advances these prominences shift positions; some\r\nfade; some disappear; still others spring into view.\r\n\r\nAs midday approaches the shadows fade; the promontories flatten; the\r\ntowering edifices move bodily backward and merge themselves in the\r\nopposite rim. There is a period of several hours when the whole canyon\r\nhas become a solid wall; strata fail to match; eye and mind become\r\nconfused; comprehension is baffled by the tangle of disconnected bands\r\nof color; the watcher is distressed by an oppressive sense of\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nIt is when afternoon is well advanced that the magician sun begins his\r\nmost astonishing miracles in the canyon's depths. Out from the blazing\r\nwall, one by one, step the mighty obelisks and palaces, defined by\r\never-changing shadows. Unsuspected promontories emerge, undreamed-of\r\ngulfs sink back in the perspective. The serpentine gorge appears here,\r\nfades there, seems almost to move in the slow-changing shadows. I shall\r\nnot try even to suggest the soul-uplifting spectacle which culminates in\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nDays may be spent upon the rim in many forms of pleasure; short camping\r\ntrips may be made to distant points.\r\n\r\nThe descent into the canyon is usually made from El Tovar down the\r\nBright Angel Trail, so called because it faces the splendid Bright Angel\r\nCanyon of the north side, and by the newer Hermit Trail which starts a\r\nfew miles west. There are trails at Grand View, eight miles east, and at\r\nBass Camp, twenty-four miles west of El Tovar, which are seldom used\r\nnow. All go to the bottom of the Granite Gorge. The commonly used trails\r\nmay be travelled afoot by those physically able, and on mule-back by any\r\nperson of any age who enjoys ordinary health. The Bright Angel trip\r\nreturns the traveller to the rim at day's end. The Hermit Trail trip\r\ncamps him overnight on the floor of the canyon at the base of a magic\r\ntemple. The finest trip of all takes him down the Hermit Trail, gives\r\nhim a night in the depths, and returns him to the rim by the Bright\r\nAngel Trail. Powell named Bright Angel Creek during that memorable first\r\npassage through the Canyon. He had just named a muddy creek Dirty Devil,\r\nwhich suggested, by contrast, the name of Bright Angel for a stream so\r\npure and sparkling.\r\n\r\nThe Havasupai Indian reservation may be visited in the depths of\r\nCataract Canyon by following the trail from Bass Camp.\r\n\r\nThe first experience usually noted in the descent is the fine quality of\r\nthe trail, gentle in slope and bordered by rock on the steep side. The\r\nnext experience is the disappearance of the straight uncompromising\r\nhorizon of the opposite rim, which is a distinctive feature of every\r\nview from above. As soon as the descent fairly begins, even the smaller\r\nbluffs and promontories assume towering proportions, and, from the Tonto\r\nfloor, the mighty elevations of Cheops, Isis, Zoroaster, Shiva, Wotan,\r\nand the countless other temples of the abyss become mountains of\r\nenormous height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Fred Harvey_\r\n\r\nCAMPING PARTY ON THE SOUTH RIM\r\n\r\nThis is within a few hundred feet of the Grand Canyon abyss]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph copyright by Fred Harvey_\r\n\r\nDOWN HERMIT TRAIL FROM RIM TO RIVER\r\n\r\nGrand Canyon National Park]\r\n\r\nFrom the river's side the elevations of the Granite Gorge present a new\r\nseries of precipitous towers, back of which in places loom the tops of\r\nthe painted palaces, and back of them, from occasional favored\r\nview-spots, the far-distant rim. Here, and here only, does the Grand\r\nCanyon reveal the fulness of its meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon was discovered in 1540 by El Tovar, one of the captains\r\nof Cardenas, in charge of one of the expeditions of the Spanish\r\nexplorer, Diaz, who was hunting for seven fabled cities of vast wealth.\r\n\"They reached the banks of a river which seemed to be more than three or\r\nfour leagues above the stream that flowed between them.\" It was seen in\r\n1776 by a Spanish priest who sought a crossing and found one at a point\r\nfar above the canyon; this still bears the name Vado de los Padres.\r\n\r\nBy 1840 it was probably known to the trappers who overran the country.\r\nIn 1850 Lieutenant Whipple, surveying for a Pacific route, explored the\r\nBlack Canyon and ascended the Grand Canyon to Diamond Creek.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Lieutenant Ives, sent by the War Department to test the\r\nnavigability of the Colorado, ascended as far as the Virgin River in a\r\nsteamboat which he had shipped in pieces from Philadelphia. From there\r\nhe entered the Grand Canyon afoot, climbed to the rim, and, making a\r\ndetour, encountered the river again higher up. In 1867 James White was\r\npicked up below the Virgin River lashed to floating logs. He said that\r\nhis hunting-party near the head of the Colorado River, attacked by\r\nIndians, had escaped upon a raft. This presently broke up in the rapids\r\nand his companions were lost. He lashed himself to the wreckage and was\r\nwashed through the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Major John Wesley Powell, a school-teacher who had lost\r\nan arm in the Civil War, determined to explore the great canyons of the\r\nGreen and Colorado Rivers. Besides the immense benefit to science, the\r\nexpedition promised a great adventure. Many lives had been lost in these\r\ncanyons and wonderful were the tales told concerning them. Indians\r\nreported that huge cataracts were hidden in their depths and that in one\r\nplace the river swept through an underground passage.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with the financial backing of the State institutions of\r\nIllinois and the Chicago Academy of Science, Powell got together a party\r\nof ten men with four open boats, provisions for ten months, and all\r\nnecessary scientific instruments. He started above the canyons of the\r\nGreen River on May 24, 1869.\r\n\r\nThere are many canyons on the Green and Colorado Rivers. They vary in\r\nlength from eight to a hundred and fifty miles, with walls successively\r\nrising from thirteen hundred to thirty-five hundred feet in height. The\r\nclimax of all, the Grand Canyon, is two hundred and seventeen miles\r\nlong, with walls six thousand feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by A.J. Baker_\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE GRANITE GORGE SURGES THE MUDDY COLORADO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Fred Harvey_\r\n\r\nWHEN MORNING MISTS LIFT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nOn August 17, when Powell and his adventurers reached the Grand Canyon,\r\ntheir rations had been reduced by upsets and other accidents to enough\r\nmusty flour for ten days, plenty of coffee, and a few dried apples. The\r\nbacon had spoiled. Most of the scientific instruments were in the bottom\r\nof the river. One boat was destroyed. The men were wet to the skin and\r\nunable to make a fire. In this plight they entered the Grand Canyon,\r\nsomewhere in whose depths a great cataract had been reported.\r\n\r\nThe story of the passage is too long to tell here. Chilled, hungry, and\r\nworn, they struggled through it. Often they were obliged to let their\r\nboats down steep rapids by ropes, and clamber after them along the\r\nslippery precipices. Often there was nothing to do but to climb into\r\ntheir boats and run down long foaming slants around the corners of which\r\ndeath, perhaps, awaited. Many times they were upset and barely escaped\r\nwith their lives. With no wraps or clothing that were not soaked with\r\nwater, there were nights when they could not sleep for the cold.\r\n\r\nSo the days passed and the food lessened to a few handfuls of wet flour.\r\nThe dangers increased; some falls were twenty feet in height. Finally\r\nthree of the men determined to desert; they believed they could climb\r\nthe walls and that their chances would be better with the Indians than\r\nwith the canyon. Powell endeavored to dissuade them, but they were firm.\r\nHe offered to divide his flour with them, but this they refused.\r\n\r\nThese men, two Howlands, brothers, and William Dunn, climbed the canyon\r\nwalls and were killed by Indians. Two or three days later Powell and the\r\nrest of his party emerged below the Grand Canyon, where they found food\r\nand safety.\r\n\r\nTaught by the experience of this great adventure, Powell made a second\r\ntrip two years later which was a scientific achievement. Later on he\r\nbecame Director of the United States Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nSince then, the passage of the Grand Canyon has been made several times.\r\nR.B. Stanton made it in 1889 in the course of a survey for a proposed\r\nrailroad through the canyon; one of the leaders of the party was\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe history of the Grand Canyon has been industriously collected. It\r\nremains for others to gather the legends. It is enough here to quote\r\nfrom Powell the Indian story of its origin.\r\n\r\n\"Long ago,\" he writes, \"there was a great and wise chief who mourned the\r\ndeath of his wife, and would not be comforted until Tavwoats, one of the\r\nIndian gods, came to him and told him his wife was in a happier land,\r\nand offered to take him there that he might see for himself, if, upon\r\nhis return, he would cease to mourn. The great chief promised. Then\r\nTavwoats made a trail through the mountains that intervene between that\r\nbeautiful land, the balmy region of the great West, and this, the desert\r\nhome of the poor Numa. This trail was the canyon gorge of the Colorado.\r\nThrough it he led him; and when they had returned the deity exacted from\r\nthe chief a promise that he would tell no one of the trail. Then he\r\nrolled a river into the gorge, a mad, raging stream, that should engulf\r\nany that might attempt to enter thereby.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe bill creating the Grand Canyon National Park passed Congress early\r\nin 1919, and was signed by President Wilson on February 26. This closed\r\nan intermittent campaign of thirty-three years, begun by President\r\nHarrison, then senator from Indiana, in January, 1886, to make a\r\nnational park of the most stupendous natural spectacle in the world.\r\nPolitics, private interests, and the deliberation of governmental\r\nprocedure were the causes of delay. A self-evident proposition from the\r\nbeginning, it illustrates the enormous difficulties which confront those\r\nwho labor to develop our national-parks system. The story is worth the\r\ntelling.\r\n\r\nSenator Harrison's bill of 1886 met an instant response from the whole\r\nnation. It called for a national park fifty-six miles long and\r\nsixty-nine miles wide. There was opposition from Arizona and the bill\r\nfailed. In 1893 the Grand Canyon National Forest was created. In 1898,\r\ndepredations and unlawful seizures of land having been reported, the\r\nSecretary of the Interior directed the Land-Office to prepare a new\r\nnational-park bill. In 1899 the Land-Office reported that the bill could\r\nnot be drawn until the region was surveyed. It took the Geological\r\nSurvey five years to make the survey. The bill was not prepared because\r\nmeantime it was discovered that the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, now\r\nthe Santa Fe, owned rights which first must be eliminated.\r\n\r\nFailing to become a national park, President Roosevelt proclaimed the\r\nGrand Canyon a national monument in 1908. In 1909 a bill was introduced\r\nentitling Ralph H. Cameron to build a scenic railway along the canyon\r\nrim, which created much adverse criticism and failed. In 1910 the\r\nAmerican Scenic and Historic Preservation Society proposed a bill to\r\ncreate the Grand Canyon a national park of large size. The Geological\r\nSurvey, to which it was referred, recommended a much smaller area. By\r\nthe direction of President Taft, Senator Flint introduced a\r\nnational-park bill which differed from both suggestions. The opposition\r\nof grazing interests threw it into the hands of conferees. In 1911\r\nSenator Flint introduced the conferees' bill, but it was opposed by\r\nprivate interests and failed.\r\n\r\nMeantime the country became aroused. Patriotic societies petitioned for\r\na national park, and the National Federation of Women's Clubs began an\r\nagitation. The Department of the Interior prepared a map upon which to\r\nbase a bill, and for several years negotiated with the Forest Service,\r\nwhich administered the Grand Canyon as a national monument, concerning\r\nboundaries. Finally the boundaries were reduced to little more than the\r\nactual rim of the canyon, and a bill was prepared which Senator Ashurst\r\nintroduced in February, 1917. It failed in committee in the House owing\r\nto opposition from Arizona. It was the same bill, again introduced by\r\nSenator Ashurst in the new Congress two months later, which finally\r\npassed the House and became a law in 1919; but it required a favoring\r\nresolution by the Arizona legislature to pave the way.\r\n\r\nMeantime many schemes were launched to utilize the Grand Canyon for\r\nprivate gain. It was plastered thickly with mining claims, though the\r\nGeological Survey showed that it contained no minerals worth mining;\r\nmining claims helped delay. Schemers sought capital to utilize its\r\nwaters for power. Railroads were projected. Plans were drawn to run\r\nsightseeing cars across it on wire cables. These were the interests, and\r\nmany others, which opposed the national park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE RAINBOW OF THE DESERT\r\n\r\nZION NATIONAL MONUMENT, SOUTHERN UTAH. AREA, 120 SQUARE MILES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in the seventies, Major J.W. Powell, the daring adventurer of the\r\nGrand Canyon, faced Salt Lake City on his return from one of his notable\r\ngeological explorations of the southwest, he laid his course by a temple\r\nof rock \"lifting its opalescent shoulders against the eastern sky.\" His\r\nparty first sighted it across seventy miles of a desert which \"rose in a\r\nseries of Cyclopean steps.\" When, climbing these, they had seen the West\r\nTemple of the Virgin revealed in the glory of vermilion body and shining\r\nwhite dome, and had gazed between the glowing Gates of Little Zion into\r\nthe gorgeous valley within, these scenery-sated veterans of the Grand\r\nCanyon and the Painted Desert passed homeward profoundly impressed and\r\nplanning quick return.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Brigham Young, who had visited it many years before with\r\na party of Mormons seeking a refuge in event of Indian raids or of exile\r\nfrom their Zion, Salt Lake City, had looked upon its glory as prophetic,\r\nand named it Little Zion.\r\n\r\nGeologists found the spot a fruitful field of study. They found it also\r\na masterpiece of desert beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Again we are impressed with the marvellous beauty of outline, the\r\ninfinite complication of these titanic buttes,\" wrote F.S. Dellenbaugh,\r\ntopographer of the Powell party, on his second visit. \"It is doubtful if\r\nin this respect the valley has its equal. Not even the Grand Canyon\r\noffers a more varied spectacle; yet all is welded together in a superb\r\nensemble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can exceed the wondrous beauty of Little Zion Canyon,\" wrote\r\nC.E. Dutton. \"In its proportions it is about equal to Yosemite, but in\r\nthe nobility and beauty of its sculptures there is no comparison. It is\r\nHyperion to a Satyr. No wonder the fierce Mormon zealot who named it was\r\nreminded of the Great Zion on which his fervid thoughts were bent, of\r\n'houses not built with hands, eternal in the heavens.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd Doctor G.K. Gilbert, whose intimate study of its recesses has become\r\na geological classic, declared it \"the most wonderful defile\" that it\r\nhad been even his experienced fortune to behold.\r\n\r\nTechnical literature contains other outbursts of enthusiastic\r\nadmiration, some of eloquence, hidden, however, among pages so\r\nincomprehensible to the average lover of the sublime in Nature that the\r\nglory of Little Zion was lost in its very discovery. So remote did it\r\nlie from the usual lines of travel and traffic that, though its\r\nimportance resulted in its conservation as a national monument in 1909,\r\nit was six or seven years more before its fame as a spectacle of the\r\nfirst order began to get about. The tales of adventurous explorers, as\r\nusual, were discounted. It was not until agencies seeking new tourist\r\nattractions sent parties to verify reports that the public gaze was\r\ncentred upon the canyon's supreme loveliness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo picture Zion one must recall that the great plateau in which the\r\nVirgin River has sunk these canyons was once enormously higher than now.\r\nThe erosion of hundreds of thousands, or, if you please, millions of\r\nyears, has cut down and still is cutting down the plateau. These\r\n\"Cyclopean steps,\" each step the thickness of a stratum or a series of\r\nstrata of hardened sands, mark progressive stages in the decomposition\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nLittle Zion Canyon is an early stage in Nature's process of levelling\r\nstill another sandstone step, that is all; this one fortunately of many\r\ngorgeous hues. From the top of this layer we may look down thousands of\r\nvertical feet into the painted canyon whose river still is sweeping out\r\nthe sands that Nature chisels from the cliffs; or from the canyon's\r\nbottom we may look up thousands of feet to the cliffed and serrated top\r\nof the doomed plateau. These ornate precipices were carved by trickling\r\nwater and tireless winds. These fluted and towered temples of master\r\ndecoration were disclosed when watery chisels cut away the sands that\r\nformerly had merged them with the ancient rock, just as the Lion of\r\nLucerne was disclosed for the joy of the world when Thorwaldsen's chisel\r\nchipped away the Alpine rock surrounding its unformed image.\r\n\r\nThe colors are even more extraordinary than the forms. The celebrated\r\nVermilion Cliff, which for more than a hundred miles streaks the desert\r\nlandscape with vivid red, here combines spectacularly with the White\r\nCliff, another famous desert feature--two thousand feet of the red\r\nsurmounted by a thousand feet of the white. These constitute the body of\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nBut there are other colors. The Vermilion Cliff rests upon the so-called\r\nPainted Desert stratum, three hundred and fifty feet of a more insistent\r\nred relieved by mauve and purple shale. That in turn rests upon a\r\nhundred feet of brown conglomerate streaked with gray, the grave of\r\nreptiles whose bones have survived a million years or more. And that\r\nrests upon the greens and grays and yellows of the Belted Shales.\r\n\r\nNor is this all, for far in the air above the wonderful White Cliff rise\r\nin places six hundred feet of drab shales and chocolate limestones\r\nintermixed with crimsons whose escaping dye drips in broad vertical\r\nstreaks across the glistening white. And even above that, in places, lie\r\nremnants of the mottled, many-colored beds of St. Elmo shales and\r\nlimestones in whose embrace, a few hundred miles away, lie embedded the\r\nbones of many monster dinosaurs of ages upon ages ago.\r\n\r\nThrough these successive layers of sands and shales and limestones, the\r\ndeposits of a million years of earth's evolution, colored like a Roman\r\nsash, glowing in the sun like a rainbow, the Virgin River has cut a\r\nvertical section, and out of its sides the rains of centuries of\r\ncenturies have detached monster monoliths and temples of marvellous size\r\nand fantastic shape, upon whose many-angled surfaces water and wind have\r\nsculptured ten thousand fanciful designs and decorations.\r\n\r\nThe way in to this desert masterpiece of southern Utah is a hundred\r\nmiles of progressive preparation. From railroad to canyon there is not\r\nan unuseful mile or hour. It is as if all were planned, step by step, to\r\nmake ready the mind of the traveller to receive the revelation with\r\nfullest comprehension.\r\n\r\nTo one approaching who does not know the desert, the motion-picture on\r\nthe screen of the car-window is exciting in its mystery. These vast arid\r\nbottomlands of prehistoric Lake Bonneville, girded by mountain groups\r\nand ranges as arid as the sands from which they lift their tawny sides,\r\nprovoke suggestive questions of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WESTERN TEMPLE THE EASTERN TEMPLE OUTLINES OF THE\r\nWESTERN AND EASTERN TEMPLES, ZION NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\n_From drawings by William H. Holmes_]\r\n\r\nIn this receptive mood the traveller reaches Lund and an automobile.\r\nThe ride to Cedar City, where he spends the night, shows him the\r\nsage-dotted desert at close range. His horizon is one of bare, rugged\r\nmountains. In front of him rise the \"Cyclopean steps\" in long,\r\nirregular, deeply indented sweeps. The vivid Pink Cliff, which, had it\r\nnot long since been washed away from Little Zion, would have added\r\nanother tier of color to its top, here, on the desert, remains a distant\r\nhorizon. The road climbs Lake Bonneville's southern shore, and, at Cedar\r\nCity, reaches the glorified sandstones.\r\n\r\nFrom Cedar City to the canyon one sweeps through Mormon settlements\r\nfounded more than sixty years ago, a region of stream-watered valleys\r\nknown of old as Dixie. The road is part of the Arrowhead Trail, once in\r\nfact a historic trail, now a motor-highway between Salt Lake and Los\r\nAngeles. The valleys bloom. Pomegranates, figs, peaches, apricots,\r\nmelons, walnuts, and almonds reach a rare perfection. Cotton, which\r\nBrigham Young started here as an experiment in 1861, is still grown.\r\nLusty cottonwood-trees line the banks of the little rivers. Cedars dot\r\nthe valleys and cover thickly the lower hills. And everywhere, on every\r\nside, the arid cliffs close in. The Pink Cliff has been left behind, but\r\nthe Vermilion Cliff constantly appears. The White Cliff enters and\r\nstays. Long stretches of road overlie one and another colored stratum;\r\npresently the ground is prevailingly red, with here and there reaches of\r\nmauve, yellow, green, and pink.\r\n\r\nCedar City proves to be a quaint, straggling Mormon village with a touch\r\nof modern enterprise; south of Cedar City the villages lack the\r\nenterprise. The houses are of a gray composition resembling adobe, and\r\nmany of them are half a century old and more. Dilapidated square forts,\r\nreminders of pioneer struggles with the Indians, are seen here and\r\nthere. Compact Mormon churches are in every settlement, however small.\r\nThe men are bearded, coatless, and wear baggy trousers, suggestive of\r\nHolland. Bronzed and deliberate women, who drive teams and work the\r\nfields with the men, wear old-fashioned sunbonnets. Many of these people\r\nhave never seen a railroad-train. Newspapers are scarce and long past\r\ndate. Here Mormonism of the older fashion is a living religion,\r\naffecting the routine of daily life.\r\n\r\nDixie is a land of plenty, but it is a foreign land. It is reminiscent,\r\nwith many differences, of an Algerian oasis. The traveller is immensely\r\ninterested. Somehow these strange primitive villages, these simple,\r\nearnest, God-fearing people, merge into unreality with the desert, the\r\nsage-dotted mountains, the cedar-covered slopes, the blooming valleys,\r\nthe colored sands, and the vivid cliffs.\r\n\r\nThrough Bellevue, Toquerville, the ruins of Virgin City, Rockville, and\r\nfinally to Springdale winds the road. Meantime the traveller has speeded\r\nsouth under the Hurricane Cliff, which is the ragged edge left when all\r\nthe land west of it sank two thousand feet during some geologic time\r\nlong past. He reaches the Virgin River where it emerges from the great\r\ncliffs in whose recesses it is born, and whence it carries in its broad\r\nmuddy surge the products of their steady disintegration.\r\n\r\nFrom here on, swinging easterly up-stream, sensation hastens to its\r\nclimax. Here the Hurricane Cliff sends aloft an impressive butte painted\r\nin slanting colors and capped with black basalt. Farther on a rugged\r\npromontory striped with vivid tints pushes out from the southern wall\r\nnearly to the river's brink. The cliffs on both sides of the river are\r\ncarved from the stratum which geologists call the Belted Shales.\r\nGreenish-grays, brownish-yellows, many shades of bright red, are\r\nprominent; it is hard to name a color or shade which is not represented\r\nin its horizontal bands. \"The eye tires and the mind flags in their\r\npresence,\" writes Professor Willis T. Lee. \"To try to realize in an\r\nhour's time the beauty and variety of detail here presented is as\r\nuseless as to try to grasp the thoughts expressed in whole rows of\r\nvolumes by walking through a library.\"\r\n\r\nFar up the canyon which North Creek pushes through this banded cliff,\r\ntwo towering cones of glistening white are well named Guardian\r\nAngels--of the stream which roars between their feet. Eagle Crag, which\r\nMoran painted, looms into view. On the south appears the majestic\r\nmassing of needle-pointed towers which Powell named the Pinnacles of the\r\nVirgin. The spectacular confuses with its brilliant variations.\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of the Virgin River and its North Fork, known of old\r\nas the Parunuweap and the Mukuntuweap, the road sweeps northward up the\r\nMukuntuweap. There have been differing reports of the meaning of this\r\nword, which gave the original name to the national monument. It has\r\nbeen popularly accepted as meaning \"Land of God,\" but John R. Wallis, of\r\nSt. George, Utah, has traced it to its original Indian source.\r\nMukuntuweap, he writes, means \"Land of the Springs,\" and Parunuweap\r\n\"Land of the Birds.\"\r\n\r\nReaching Springdale, at the base of the Vermilion Cliff, the traveller\r\nlooks up-stream to the valley mouth through which the river emerges from\r\nthe cliffs, and a spectacle without parallel meets his eye. Left of the\r\ngorgeous entrance rises the unbelievable West Temple of the Virgin, and,\r\nmerging with it from behind, loom the lofty Towers of the Virgin.\r\nOpposite these, and back from the canyon's eastern brink, rises the\r\nloftier and even more majestic East Temple of the Virgin. Between them\r\nhe sees a perspective of red and white walls, domes, and pinnacles which\r\nthrills him with expectation.\r\n\r\nAnd so, fully prepared in mind and spirit, awed and exultant, he enters\r\nZion.\r\n\r\nFew natural objects which have been described so seldom have provoked\r\nsuch extravagant praise as the West Temple. It is seen from a foreground\r\nof gliding river, cottonwood groves, and talus slopes dotted with\r\nmanzanita, sage, cedars, and blooming cactus. From a stairway of mingled\r\nyellows, reds, grays, mauves, purples, and chocolate brown, it springs\r\nabruptly four thousand feet. Its body is a brilliant red. Its upper\r\nthird is white. It has the mass and proportions, the dignity and\r\ngrandeur, of a cathedral. It is supremely difficult to realize that it\r\nwas not designed, so true to human conception are the upright form and\r\nmass of its central structure, the proportioning and modelling of its\r\nextensive wings and buttresses. On top of the lofty central rectangle\r\nrests, above its glistening white, a low squared cap of deepest red. It\r\nis a temple in the full as well as the noblest sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThe East Temple, which rises directly opposite and two miles back from\r\nthe rim, is a fitting companion. It is a thousand feet higher. Its\r\ncentral structure is a steep truncated cone capped like the West Temple.\r\nIts wings are separated half-way down, one an elongated pyramid and the\r\nother a true cone, both of magnificent size and bulk but truly\r\nproportioned to the central mass. Phrase does not convey the suggestion\r\nof architectural calculation in both of these stupendous monuments. One\r\ncan easily believe that the Mormon prophet in naming them saw them the\r\ndesigned creations of a personal deity.\r\n\r\nA more definite conception of Nature's gigantic processes follows upon\r\nrealization that these lofty structures once joined across the canyon,\r\nstratum for stratum, color for color. The rock that joined them,\r\ndisintegrated by the frosts and rains, has passed down the muddy current\r\nof the Virgin, down the surging tide of the Colorado, through the Grand\r\nCanyon, and into the Pacific. Some part of these sands doubtless helped\r\nto build the peninsula of Lower California.\r\n\r\nPassing the gates the traveller stands in a trench of nearly\r\nperpendicular sides more than half a mile deep, half a mile wide at the\r\nbottom, a mile wide from crest to crest. The proportions and\r\nmeasurements suggest Yosemite, but there is little else in common. These\r\nwalls blaze with color. On the west the Streaked Wall, carved from the\r\nWhite Cliff, is stained with the drip from the red and drab and\r\nchocolate shales and limestones not yet wholly washed from its top. It\r\nis a vivid thing, wonderfully eroded. Opposite is the Brown Wall, rich\r\nin hue, supporting three stupendous structures of gorgeous color, two of\r\nwhich are known as the Mountain of the Sun and the Watchman. Together\r\nthey are the Sentinels. Passing these across a plaza apparently\r\nbroadened for their better presentation rise on the west the Three\r\nPatriarchs, Yosemite-like in form, height, and bulk, but not in\r\npersonality or color. The brilliance of this wonder-spot passes\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nHere the canyon contracts, and we come to the comfortable hotel-camp,\r\nterminal of the automobile journey. It is on the river side in a shady\r\nalcove of the east wall near a spring. Here horses may be had for\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nA mile above the camp stands one of the most remarkable monoliths of the\r\nregion. El Gobernador is a colossal truncated dome, red below and white\r\nabove. The white crown is heavily marked in two directions, suggesting\r\nthe web and woof of drapery. Directly opposite, a lesser monolith,\r\nnevertheless gigantic, is suggestively if sentimentally called Angel's\r\nLanding. A natural bridge which is still in Nature's workshop is one of\r\nthe interesting spectacles of this vicinity. Its splendid arch is fully\r\nformed, but the wall against which it rests its full length remains,\r\nbroken through in one spot only. How many thousands or hundreds of\r\nthousands of years will be required to wipe away the wall and leave the\r\nbridge complete is for those to guess who will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Douglas White_\r\n\r\nEL GOBERNADOR, ZION NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThree thousand feet high; the lower two thousand feet is a brilliant\r\nred, the upper thousand feet is white]\r\n\r\nHere also is the valley end of a wire cable which passes upward\r\ntwenty-five hundred feet to cross a break in the wall to a forest on the\r\nmesa's top. Lumber is Dixie's most hardly furnished need. For years sawn\r\ntimbers have been cabled down into the valley and carted to the villages\r\nof the Virgin River.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the most fascinating part of Little Zion is still\r\nbeyond. A mile above El Gobernador the river swings sharply west and\r\ndoubles on itself. Raspberry Bend is far nobler than its name implies,\r\nand the Great Organ which the river here encircles exacts no imaginative\r\neffort. Beyond this the canyon narrows rapidly. The road has long since\r\nstopped, and soon the trail stops. Presently the river, now a shrunken\r\nstream, concealing occasional quicksands, offers the only footing. The\r\nwalls are no less lofty, no less richly colored, and the weary traveller\r\nworks his difficult way forward.\r\n\r\nThere will come a time if he persists when he may stand at the bottom of\r\na chasm more than two thousand feet deep and, nearly touching the walls\r\non either side, look up and see no sky.\r\n\r\n\"At the water's edge the walls are perpendicular,\" writes Doctor G.K.\r\nGilbert, of the U.S. Geological Survey, who first described it, \"but in\r\nthe deeper parts they open out toward the top. As we entered and found\r\nour outlook of sky contracted--as we had never before seen it between\r\ncanyon cliffs--I measured the aperture above, and found it thirty-five\r\ndegrees. We had thought this a minimum, but soon discovered our error.\r\nNearer and nearer the walls approached, and our strip of blue narrowed\r\ndown to twenty degrees, then ten, and at last was even intercepted by\r\nthe overhanging rocks. There was, perhaps, no point from which, neither\r\nforward nor backward, could we discover a patch of sky, but many times\r\nour upward view was completely cut off by the interlocking of the walls,\r\nwhich, remaining nearly parallel to each other, warped in and out as\r\nthey ascended.\"\r\n\r\nHere he surprises the secret of the making of Zion.\r\n\r\n\"As a monument of denudation, this chasm is an example of downward\r\nerosion by sand-bearing water. The principle on which the cutting\r\ndepends is almost identical with that of the marble saw, but the sand\r\ngrains, instead of being embedded in rigid iron, are carried by a\r\nflexible stream of water. By gravity they have been held against the\r\nbottom of the cut, so that they should make it vertical, but the current\r\nhas carried them, in places, against one side or the other, and so far\r\nmodified the influence of gravity that the cut undulates somewhat in its\r\nvertical section, as well as in its horizontal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by the U.S. Geological Survey_\r\n\r\nZION CANYON FROM THE RIM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE PATRIARCHS, ZION CANYON\r\n\r\nThese red-and-white structures rise more than two thousand feet above\r\nthe canyon floor]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is how Nature began, on the original surface of the\r\nplateau, perhaps with the output of a spring shower, to dig this whole\r\nmighty spectacle for our enjoyment to-day. We may go further. We may\r\nimagine the beginning of the titanic process that dug the millions of\r\nmillions of chasms, big and little, contributing to the mighty Colorado,\r\nthat dug the Grand Canyon itself, that reduced to the glorified thing it\r\nnow is the enormous plateau of our great southwest, which would have\r\nbeen many thousands of feet higher than the highest pinnacle of Little\r\nZion had not erosion more than counteracted the uplifting of the\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nLittle else need be said to complete this picture. The rains and melting\r\nsnows of early spring produce mesa-top torrents which pour into the\r\nvalley and hasten for a period the processes of decorating the walls and\r\nlevelling the plateau. So it happens that waterfalls of power and beauty\r\nthen enrich this wondrous spectacle. But this added beauty is not for\r\nthe tourist, who may come in comfort only after its disappearance.\r\n\r\nBut springs are many. Trickling from various levels in the walls, they\r\ndevelop new tributary gorges. Gushing from the foundations, they create\r\nalcoves and grottos which are in sharp contrast with their desert\r\nenvironment, enriching by dampness the colors of the sandstone and\r\ndecorating these refreshment-places with trailing ferns and flowering\r\ngrowths. In these we see the origin of the Indian name, Mukuntuweap,\r\nLand of the Springs.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, however, always stood in awe of Little Zion. They entered\r\nit, but feared the night.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 President Wilson changed the name from Mukuntuweap to Zion. At\r\nthe same time he greatly enlarged the reservation. Zion National\r\nMonument now includes a large area of great and varied desert\r\nmagnificence, including the sources and canyons of two other streams\r\nbesides Mukuntuweap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nHISTORIC MONUMENTS OF THE SOUTHWEST\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven national monuments in the States of Arizona, New Mexico, and\r\nColorado illustrate the history of our southwest from the times when\r\nprehistoric man dwelt in caves hollowed in desert precipices down\r\nthrough the Spanish fathers' centuries of self-sacrifice and the Spanish\r\nexplorers' romantic search for the Quivira and the Seven Cities of\r\nCibola.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of the absorbing story of the Spanish\r\noccupation is its twofold inspiration. Hand in hand the priest and the\r\nsoldier boldly invaded the desert. The passion of the priest was the\r\nsaving of souls, and the motive of the soldier was the greed of gold.\r\nThe priest deprecated the soldier; the soldier despised the priest. Each\r\nused the other for the realization of his own purposes. The zealous\r\npriest, imposing his religion upon the shrinking Indian, did not\r\nhesitate to invoke the soldier's aid for so holy a purpose; the soldier\r\nused the gentle priest to cloak the greedy business of wringing wealth\r\nfrom the frugal native. Together, they hastened civilization.\r\n\r\nGlancing for a moment still further back, the rapacious hordes already\r\nhad gutted the rich stores of Central America and the northern regions\r\nof South America. The rush of the lustful conqueror was astonishingly\r\nswift. Columbus himself was as eager for gold as he was zealous for\r\nreligion. From the discovery of America scarcely twenty years elapsed\r\nbefore Spanish armies were violently plundering the Caribbean Islands,\r\nruthlessly subjugating Mexico, overrunning Venezuela, and eagerly\r\nseeking tidings of the reputed wealth of Peru. The air was supercharged\r\nwith reports of treasure, and no reports were too wild for belief;\r\nmyths, big and little, ran amuck. El Dorado, the gilded man of rumor,\r\nbecame the dream, then the belief, of the times; presently a whole\r\nnation was conceived clothed in dusted gold. The myth of the Seven\r\nCities of Cibola, each a city of vast treasure, the growth of years of\r\nrumor, seems to have perfected itself back home in Spain. The twice-born\r\nmyth of Quivira, city of gold, which cost thousands of lives and\r\nhundreds of thousands of Spanish ducats, lives even to-day in remote\r\nneighborhoods of the southwest.\r\n\r\nPizarro conquered Peru in 1526; by 1535, with the south looted, Spanish\r\neyes looked longingly northward. In 1539 Fray Marcos, a Franciscan, made\r\na reconnaissance from the Spanish settlements of Sonora into Arizona\r\nwith the particular purpose of locating the seven cities. The following\r\nyear Coronado, at his own expense, made the most romantic exploration in\r\nhuman history. Spanish expectation may be measured by the cost of this\r\nand its accompanying expedition by sea to the Gulf of California, the\r\ncombined equipment totalling a quarter million dollars of American money\r\nof to-day. Coronado took two hundred and sixty horsemen, sixty\r\nfoot-soldiers, and more than a thousand Indians. Besides his\r\npack-animals he led a thousand spare horses to carry home the loot.\r\n\r\nHe sought the seven cities in Arizona and New Mexico, and found the\r\npueblo of Zuni, prosperous but lacking its expected hoard of gold; he\r\ncrossed Colorado in search of Quivira and found it in Kansas, a wretched\r\nhabitation of a shiftless tribe; their houses straw, he reported, their\r\nclothes the hides of cows, meaning bison. He entered Nebraska in search\r\nof the broad river whose shores were lined with gold--the identical\r\nyear, curiously, in which De Soto discovered the Mississippi. Many were\r\nthe pueblos he visited and many his adventures and perils; but the only\r\ntreasure he brought back was his record of exploration.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of more than two centuries of Spanish expeditions.\r\nFifty years after Coronado, the myth of Quivira was born again;\r\nthereafter it wandered homeless, the inspiration of constant search, and\r\nfinally settled in the ruins of the ancient pueblo of Tabira, or, as\r\nBandelier has it, Teypana, New Mexico; the myth of the seven cities\r\nnever wholly perished.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to follow the fascinating fortunes of Spanish\r\nproselyting and conquest. I merely set the stage for the tableaux of the\r\nnational monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards found our semiarid southwest dotted thinly with the\r\npueblos and its canyons hung with the cliff-dwellings of a large and\r\nfairly prosperous population of peace-loving Indians, who hunted the\r\ndeer and the antelope, fished the rivers, and dry-farmed the mesas and\r\nvalleys. Not so advanced in the arts of civilization as the people of\r\nthe Mesa Verde, in Colorado, nevertheless their sense of form was patent\r\nin their architecture, and their family life, government, and religion\r\nwere highly organized. They were worshippers of the sun. Each pueblo and\r\noutlying village was a political unit.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider those national monuments which touch intimately\r\nthe Spanish occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAN QUIVIRA NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nEighty miles southeast of Albuquerque, in the hollow of towering desert\r\nranges, lies the arid country which Indian tradition calls the Accursed\r\nLakes. Here, at the points of a large triangle, sprawl the ruins of\r\nthree once flourishing pueblo cities, Abo, Cuaray, and Tabira. Once,\r\nsays tradition, streams flowed into lakes inhabited by great fish, and\r\nthe valleys bloomed; it was an unfaithful wife who brought down the\r\ncurse of God.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards came these cities were at the flood-tide of\r\nprosperity. Their combined population was large. Tabira was chosen as\r\nthe site of the mission whose priests should trudge the long desert\r\ntrails and minister to all.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, it was one of the most important of the early Spanish\r\nmissions. The greater of the two churches was built of limestone, its\r\nouter walls six feet thick. It was a hundred and forty feet long and\r\nforty-eight feet wide. The present height of the walls is twenty-five\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe ancient community building adjoining the church, the main pueblo of\r\nTabira, has the outlines which are common to the prehistoric pueblos of\r\nthe entire southwest and persist in general features in modern Indian\r\narchitecture. The rooms are twelve to fifteen feet square, with ceilings\r\neight or ten feet high. Doors connect the rooms, and the stories, of\r\nwhich there are three, are connected by ladders through trapdoors. It\r\nprobably held a population of fifteen hundred. The pueblo has well stood\r\nthe rack of time; the lesser buildings outside it have been reduced to\r\nmounds.\r\n\r\nThe people who built and inhabited these cities of the Accursed Lakes\r\nwere of the now extinct Piro stock. The towns were discovered in 1581 by\r\nFrancisco Banchez de Chamuscado. The first priest assigned to the field\r\nwas Fray Francisco de San Miguel, this in 1598. The mission of Tabira\r\nwas founded by Francisco de Acevedo about 1628. The smaller church was\r\nbuilt then; the great church was built in 1644, but was never fully\r\nfinished. Between 1670 and 1675 all three native cities and their\r\nSpanish churches were wiped out by Apaches.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Lummis, from whom some of these historical facts are quoted,\r\nhas been at great pains to trace the wanderings of the Quivira myth.\r\nBandelier mentions an ancient New Mexican Indian called Tio Juan Largo,\r\nwho told a Spanish explorer about the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nthat Quivira was Tabira. Otherwise history is silent concerning the\r\nprocess by which the myth finally settled upon that historic city, far\r\nindeed from its authentic home in what now is Kansas. The fact stands,\r\nhowever, that as late as the latter half of the eighteenth century the\r\nname Tabira appeared on the official map of New Mexico. When and how\r\nthis name was lost and the famous ruined city with its Spanish churches\r\naccepted as Gran Quivira perhaps never will be definitely known.\r\n\r\n\"Mid-ocean is not more lonesome than the plains, nor night so gloomy as\r\nthat dumb sunlight,\" wrote Lummis in 1893, approaching the Gran Quivira\r\nacross the desert. \"The brown grass is knee-deep, and even this shock\r\ngives a surprise in this hoof-obliterated land. The bands of antelope\r\nthat drift, like cloud shadows, across the dun landscape suggest less of\r\nlife than of the supernatural. The spell of the plains is a wondrous\r\nthing. At first it fascinates. Then it bewilders. At last it crushes. It\r\nis intangible but resistless; stronger than hope, reason, will--stronger\r\nthan humanity. When one cannot otherwise escape the plains, one takes\r\nrefuge in madness.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the setting of the \"ghost city\" of \"ashen hues,\" that \"wraith\r\nin pallid stone,\" the Gran Quivira.\r\n\r\n\r\nEL MORRO NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nDue west from Albuquerque, New Mexico, not far from the Arizona\r\nboundary, El Morro National Monument conserves a mesa end of striking\r\nbeauty upon whose cliffs are graven many inscriptions cut in passing by\r\nthe Spanish and American explorers of more than two centuries. It is a\r\nhistorical record of unique value, the only extant memoranda of several\r\nexpeditions, an invaluable detail in the history of many. It has helped\r\ntrace obscure courses and has established important departures. To the\r\ntourist it brings home, as nothing else can, the realization of these\r\ngrim romances of other days.\r\n\r\nEl Morro, the castle, is also called Inscription Rock. West of its\r\nsteepled front, in the angle of a sharp bend in the mesa, is a large\r\npartly enclosed natural chamber, a refuge in storm. A spring here\r\nbetrays the reason for El Morro's popularity among the explorers of a\r\nsemidesert region. The old Zuni trail bent from its course to touch this\r\nspring. Inscriptions are also found near the spring and on the outer\r\nside of the mesa facing the Zuni Road.\r\n\r\nFor those acquainted with the story of Spanish exploration this national\r\nmonument will have unique interest. To all it imparts a fascinating\r\nsense of the romance of those early days with which the large body of\r\nAmericans have yet to become familiar. The popular story of this\r\nromantic period of American history, its poetry and its fiction remain\r\nto be written.\r\n\r\nThe oldest inscription is dated February 18, 1526. The name of Juan de\r\nOnate, later founder of Santa Fe, is there under date of 1606, the year\r\nof his visit to the mouth of the Colorado River. One of the latest\r\nSpanish inscriptions is that of Don Diego de Vargas, who in 1692\r\nreconquered the Indians who rebelled against Spanish authority in 1680.\r\n\r\nThe reservation also includes several important community houses of\r\ngreat antiquity, one of which perches safely upon the very top of El\r\nMorro rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASA GRANDE NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nIn the far south of Arizona not many miles north of the boundary of\r\nSonora, there stands, near the Gila River, the noble ruin which the\r\nSpaniards call Casa Grande, or Great House. It was a building of large\r\nsize situated in a compound of outlying buildings enclosed in a\r\nrectangular wall; no less than three other similar compounds and four\r\ndetached clan houses once stood in the near neighborhood. Evidently, in\r\nprehistoric days, this was an important centre of population; remains of\r\nan irrigation system are still visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASA GRANDE NATIONAL MONUMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREHISTORIC CAVE HOMES IN THE BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThe holes worn by erosion have been enlarged for doors and windows]\r\n\r\nThe builders of these prosperous communal dwellings were probably Pima\r\nIndians. The Indians living in the neighborhood to-day have traditions\r\nindicated by their own names for the Casa Grande, the Old House of the\r\nChief and the Old House of Chief Morning Green. \"The Pima word for green\r\nand blue is the same,\" Doctor Fewkes writes me. \"Russell translates the\r\nold chief's name Morning Blue, which is the same as my Morning Green. I\r\nhave no doubt Morning Glow is also correct, no doubt nearer the Indian\r\nidea which refers to sun-god. This chief was the son of the Sun by a\r\nmaid, as was also Tcuhu-Montezuma, a sun-god who, legends say, built\r\nCasa Grande.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever its origin, the community was already in ruins when the\r\nSpaniards first found it. Kino identified it as the ruin which Fray\r\nMarcos saw in 1539 and called Chichilticalli, and which Coronado passed\r\nin 1540. The early Spanish historians believed it an ancestral\r\nsettlement of the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nIts formal discovery followed a century and a half later. Domingo\r\nJironza Petriz de Cruzate, governor of Sonora, had directed his nephew,\r\nLieutenant Juan Mateo Mange, to conduct a group of missionaries into the\r\ndesert, where Mange heard rumors from the natives of a fine group of\r\nruins on the banks of a river which flowed west. He reported this to\r\nFather Eusebio Francisco Kino, the fearless and famous Jesuit missionary\r\namong the Indians from 1687 to 1711; in November, 1694, Kino searched\r\nfor the ruins, found them, and said mass within the walls of the Casa\r\nGrande.\r\n\r\nThis splendid ruin is built of a natural concrete called culeche. The\r\nexternal walls are rough, but are smoothly plastered within, showing the\r\nmarks of human hands. Two pairs of small holes in the walls opposite\r\nothers in the central room have occasioned much speculation. Two look\r\neast and west; the others, also on opposite walls, look north and\r\nsouth. Some persons conjecture that observations were made through them\r\nof the solstices, and perhaps of some star, to establish the seasons for\r\nthese primitive people. \"The foundation for this unwarranted\r\nhypothesis,\" Doctor Fewkes writes, \"is probably a statement in a\r\nmanuscript by Father Font in 1775, that the 'Prince,' 'chief' of Casa\r\nGrande, looked through openings in the east and west walls 'on the sun\r\nas it rose and set, to salute it.' The openings should not be confused\r\nwith smaller holes made in the walls for placing iron rods to support\r\nthe walls by contractors when the ruin was repaired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMACACORI NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nOne of the best-preserved ruins of one of the finest missions which\r\nSpanish priests established in the desert of the extreme south of\r\nArizona is protected under the name of the Tumacacori National Monument.\r\nIt is fifty-seven miles south of Tucson, near the Mexican border. The\r\noutlying country probably possessed a large native population.\r\n\r\nThe ruins are most impressive, consisting of the walls and tower of an\r\nold church building, the walls of a mortuary chapel at the north end of\r\nthe church, and a surrounding court with adobe walls six feet high.\r\nThese, like all the Spanish missions, were built by Indian converts\r\nunder the direction of priests, for the Spanish invaders performed no\r\nmanual labor. The walls of the church are six feet thick and plastered\r\nwithin. The belfry and the altar-dome are of burned brick, the only\r\nexample of brick construction among the early Spanish missions. There is\r\na fine arched doorway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUMACACORI MISSION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by T.H. Bate_\r\n\r\nMONTEZUMA CASTLE]\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, this splendid church is well worth a visit. It was\r\nfounded and built about 1688 by Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, and was\r\nknown as the Mission San Cayetano de Tumacacori. About 1769 the\r\nFranciscans assumed charge, and repaired and elaborated the structure.\r\nThey maintained it for about sixty years, until the Apache Indians laid\r\nsiege and finally captured it, driving out the priests and dispersing\r\nthe Papagos. About 1850 it was found by Americans in its present\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAJO NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThe boundary-line which divides Utah from Arizona divides the most\r\ngorgeous expression of the great American desert region. From the Mesa\r\nVerde National Park on the east to Zion National Monument on the west,\r\nfrom the Natural Bridges on the north to the Grand Canyon and the\r\nPainted Desert on the south, the country glows with golden sands and\r\ncrimson mesas, a wilderness of amazing and impossible contours and\r\nindescribable charm.\r\n\r\nWithin this region, in the extreme north of Arizona, lie the ruins of\r\nthree neighboring pueblos. Richard Wetherill, who was one of the\r\ndiscoverers of the famous cliff-cities of the Mesa Verde, was one of the\r\nparty which found the Kit Siel (Broken Pottery) ruin in 1894 within a\r\nlong crescent-shaped cave in the side of a glowing red sandstone cliff;\r\nin 1908, upon information given by a Navajo Indian, John Wetherill,\r\nProfessor Byron Cumming, and Neil Judd located Betatakin (Hillside\r\nHouse) ruin within a crescent-shaped cavity in the side of a small red\r\ncanyon. Twenty miles west of Betatakin is a small ruin known as\r\nInscription House upon whose walls is a carved inscription supposed to\r\nhave been made by Spanish explorers who visited them in 1661.\r\n\r\nWhile these ruins show no features materially differing from those of\r\nhundreds of other more accessible pueblo ruins, they possess quite\r\nextraordinary beauty because of their romantic location in cliffs of\r\nstriking color in a region of mysterious charm.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBut the Indian civilization of our southwest began very many centuries\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniard, who found, besides the innumerable\r\npueblos which were crowded with busy occupants, hundreds of pueblos\r\nwhich had been deserted by their builders, some of them for centuries,\r\nand which lay even then in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe desertion of so many pueblos with abundant pottery and other\r\nevidences of active living is one of the mysteries of this prehistoric\r\ncivilization. No doubt, with the failure of water-supplies and other\r\nchanging physical conditions, occasionally communities sought better\r\nliving in other localities, but it is certain that many of these\r\ndesertions resulted from the raids of the wandering predatory tribes of\r\nthe plains, the Querechos of Bandelier's records, but usually mentioned\r\nby him and others by the modern name of Apaches. These fierce bands\r\ncontinually sought to possess themselves of the stores of food and\r\nclothing to be found in the prosperous pueblos. The utmost cruelties of\r\nthe Spanish invaders who, after all, were ruthless only in pursuit of\r\ngold, and, when this was lacking, tolerant and even kindly in their\r\ntreatment of the natives, were nothing compared to the atrocities of\r\nthese Apache Indians, who gloried in conquest.\r\n\r\nOf the ruins of pueblos which were not identified with Spanish\r\noccupation, six have been conserved as national monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nMany centuries before the coming of the Spaniards, a deep gorge on the\r\neastern slope of the Sierra de los Valles, eighteen miles west of Santa\r\nFe, New Mexico, was the home of a people living in caves which they\r\nhollowed by enlarging erosional openings in the soft volcanic sides of\r\nnearly perpendicular cliffs. The work was done with pains and skill. A\r\nsmall entrance, sometimes from the valley floor, sometimes reached by\r\nladder, opened into a roomy apartment which in many cases consisted of\r\nseveral connecting rooms. These apartments were set in tiers or stories,\r\nas in a modern flat-house. There were often two, sometimes three,\r\nfloors. They occurred in groups, probably representing families or\r\nclans, and some of these groups numbered hundreds. Seen to-day, the\r\ncliff-side suggests not so much the modern apartment-house, of which it\r\nwas in a way the prehistoric prototype, as a gigantic pigeon-house.\r\n\r\nIn time these Indians emerged from the cliff and built a great\r\nsemi-circular pueblo up the valley, surrounded by smaller habitations.\r\nOther pueblos, probably still later in origin, were built upon\r\nsurrounding mesas. All these habitations were abandoned perhaps\r\ncenturies before the coming of the Spaniards. The gorge is known as the\r\nRito de la Frijoles, which is the Spanish name of the clear\r\nmountain-stream which flows through it. Since 1916 it has been known as\r\nthe Bandelier National Monument, after the late Adolf Francis Bandelier,\r\nthe distinguished archaeologist of the southwest.\r\n\r\nThe valley is a place of beauty. It is six miles long and nowhere\r\nbroader than half a mile; its entrance scarcely admits two persons\r\nabreast. Its southern wall is the slope of a tumbled mesa, its northern\r\nwall the vertical cliff of white and yellowish pumice in which the caves\r\nwere dug. The walls rise in crags and pinnacles many hundreds of feet.\r\nWillows, cottonwoods, cherries, and elders grow in thickets along the\r\nstream-side, and cactus decorates the wastes. It is reached by\r\nautomobile from Santa Fe.\r\n\r\nThis national monument lies within a large irregular area which has been\r\nsuggested for a national park because of the many interesting remains\r\nwhich it encloses. The Cliff Cities National Park, when it finally comes\r\ninto existence, will include among its exhibits a considerable group of\r\nprehistoric shrines of great value and unusual popular interest.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians of to-day,\" writes William Boone Douglass, \"guard with\r\ngreat tenacity the secrets of their shrines. Even when the locations\r\nhave been found they will deny their existence, plead ignorance of their\r\nmeaning, or refuse to discuss the subject in any form.\" Nevertheless,\r\nthey claim direct descent from the prehistoric shrine-builders, many of\r\nwhose shrines are here found among others of later origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHACO CANYON NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nFor fourteen miles, both sides of a New Mexican canyon sixty-five miles\r\nequidistant from Farmington and Gallup are lined with the ruins of very\r\nlarge and prosperous colonies of prehistoric people. Most of the\r\nbuildings were pueblos, many of them containing between fifty and a\r\nhundred rooms; one, known to-day as Pueblo Bonito, must have contained\r\ntwelve hundred rooms.\r\n\r\nThese ruins lie in their original desolation; little excavation, and no\r\nrestoration has yet been done. Chaco Canyon must have been the centre of\r\na very large population. For miles in all directions, particularly\r\nwestward, pueblos are grouped as suburbs group near cities of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that so populous a desert neighborhood required\r\nextensive systems of irrigation. One of these is so well preserved that\r\nlittle more than the repair of a dam would be necessary to make it again\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEZUMA CASTLE NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nSmall though it is, Montezuma Castle is justly one of the most\r\ncelebrated prehistoric ruins in America. Its charming proportions, and\r\nparticularly its commanding position in the face of a lofty precipice,\r\nmake it a spectacle never to be forgotten. It is fifty-four miles from\r\nPrescott, Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis structure was a communal house which originally contained\r\ntwenty-five rooms. The protection of the dry climate and of the shallow\r\ncave in which it stands has well preserved it these many centuries. Most\r\nof the rooms are in good condition. The timbers, which plainly show the\r\nhacking of the dull primeval stone axes, are among its most interesting\r\nexhibits. The building is crescent-shaped, sixty feet in width and about\r\nfifty feet high. It is five stories high, but the fifth story is\r\ninvisible from the front because of the high stone wall of the facade.\r\nThe cliff forms the back wall of the structure.\r\n\r\nMontezuma's Castle is extremely old. Its material is soft calcareous\r\nstone, and nothing but its sheltered position could have preserved it.\r\nThere are many ruined dwellings in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONTO NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nFour miles east of the Roosevelt Dam and eighty miles east of Phoenix,\r\nArizona, are two small groups of cliff-dwellings which together form the\r\nTonto National Monument. The southern group occupies a cliff cavern a\r\nhundred and twenty-five feet across. The masonry is above the average.\r\nThe ceilings of the lower rooms are constructed of logs laid lengthwise,\r\nupon which a layer of fibre serves as the foundation for the four-inch\r\nadobe floor of the chamber overhead.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of cliff-dwellings which exceed this in charm and\r\ninterest, but its nearness to an attraction like the Roosevelt Dam and\r\nglimpses of it which the traveller catches as he speeds over the Apache\r\nTrail make it invaluable as a tourist exhibit. Thousands who are unable\r\nto undertake the long and often arduous journeys by trail to the greater\r\nruins, can here get definite ideas and a hint of the real flavor of\r\nprehistoric civilization in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT CANYON NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThirty cliff-dwellings cling to the sides of picturesque Walnut Canyon,\r\neight miles from Flagstaff, Arizona. They are excellently preserved. The\r\nlargest contains eight rooms. The canyon possesses unusual beauty\r\nbecause of the thickets of locust which fringe the trail down from the\r\nrim. One climbs down ladders to occasional ruins which otherwise are\r\ninaccessible. Because of its nearness to Flagstaff several thousand\r\npersons visit this reservation yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGILA CLIFFS NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nFifty miles northeast of Silver City, New Mexico, a deep rough canyon in\r\nthe west fork of the Gila River contains a group of four cliff-dwellings\r\nin a fair state of preservation. They lie in cavities in the base of an\r\noverhanging cliff of grayish-yellow volcanic rock which at one time\r\napparently were closed by protecting walls. When discovered by\r\nprospectors and hunters about 1870, many sandals, baskets, spears, and\r\ncooking utensils were found strewn on the floors. Corn-cobs are all that\r\nvandals have left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nDESERT SPECTACLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American desert, to eyes attuned, is charged with beauty. Few who\r\nsee it from the car-window find it attractive; most travellers quickly\r\nlose interest in its repetitions and turn back to their novels. A little\r\nintimacy changes this attitude. Live a little with the desert. See it in\r\nits varied moods--for every hour it changes; see it at sunrise, at\r\nmidday, at sunset, in the ghostly night, by moonlight. Observe its\r\nlife--for it is full of life; its amazing vegetation; its varied\r\noutline. Drink in its atmosphere, its history, its tradition, its\r\nromance. Open your soul to its persuading spirit. Then, insensibly but\r\nswiftly, its flavor will enthrall your senses; it will possess you. And\r\nonce possessed, you are charmed for life. It will call you again and\r\nagain, as the sea calls the sailor and the East its devotees.\r\n\r\nThis alluring region is represented in our national parks system by\r\nreservations which display its range. The Zion National Monument, the\r\nGrand Canyon, and the Mesa Verde illustrate widely differing phases. The\r\nhistorical monuments convey a sense of its romance. There remain a few\r\nto complete the gamut of its charms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAINBOW BRIDGE NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nImagine a gray Navajo desert dotted with purple sage; huge mesas, deep\r\nred, squared against the gray-blue atmosphere of the horizon; pinnacles,\r\nspires, shapes like monstrous bloody fangs, springing from the sands; a\r\nfloor as rough as stormy seas, heaped with tumbled rocks, red, yellow,\r\nblue, green, grayish-white, between which rise strange yellowish-green\r\nthorny growths, cactus-like and unfamiliar; a pathless waste, strewn\r\nwith obsidian fragments, glaring in the noon sun, more confusing than\r\nthe crooked mazes of an ancient Oriental city.\r\n\r\nImagine shapeless masses of colored sandstone, unclimbable, barring the\r\nway; acres of polished mottled rock tilted at angles which defy\r\ncrossing; unexpected canyons whose deep, broken, red and yellow\r\nprecipices force long detours.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere color, color, color. It pervades the glowing floor, the\r\nuprising edifices. The very air palpitates with color, insistent,\r\nirresistible, indefinable.\r\n\r\nThis is the setting of the Rainbow Bridge.\r\n\r\nScarcely more than a hundred persons besides Indians, they tell me, have\r\nseen this most entrancing spectacle, perhaps, of all America. The way in\r\nis long and difficult. There are only two or three who know it, even of\r\nthose who have been there more than once, and the region has no\r\ninhabitants to point directions among the confusing rocks. There is no\r\nwater, nor any friendly tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROOSEVELT PARTY IN MONUMENT VALLEY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAINBOW BRIDGE IN FULL PERSPECTIVE]\r\n\r\nThe day's ride is wearying in the extreme in spite of its fascinations.\r\nThe objective is Navajo Mountain, which, strange spectacle in this\r\ndesert waste, is forested to its summit with yellow pine above a\r\nsurrounding belt of juniper and pinyon, with aspen and willows, wild\r\nroses, Indian paint-brush, primrose, and clematis in its lower valleys.\r\nBelow, the multicolored desert, deep cut with the canyons which carry\r\noff the many little rivers.\r\n\r\nDown one of these wild and highly colored desert canyons among whose\r\nvivid tumbled rocks your horses pick their course with difficulty, you\r\nsuddenly see a rainbow caught among the vivid bald rocks, a slender arch\r\nso deliciously proportioned, so gracefully curved among its sharp\r\nsurroundings, that your eye fixes it steadfastly and your heart bounds\r\nwith relief; until now you had not noticed the oppression of this\r\nangled, spine-carpeted landscape.\r\n\r\nFrom now on nothing else possesses you. The eccentricity of the going\r\nconstantly hides it, and each reappearance brings again the joy of\r\ndiscovery. And at last you reach it, dismount beside the small clear\r\nstream which flows beneath it, approach reverently, overwhelmed with a\r\nstrange mingling of awe and great elation. You stand beneath its\r\nenormous encircling red and yellow arch and perceive that it is the\r\nsupport which holds up the sky. It is long before turbulent emotion\r\npermits the mind to analyze the elements which compose its extraordinary\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nDimensions mean little before spectacles like this. To know that the\r\nspan is two hundred and seventy-eight feet may help realization at home,\r\nwhere it may be laid out, staked and looked at; it exceeds a block of\r\nFifth Avenue in New York. To know that the apex of the rainbow's curve\r\nis three hundred and nine feet above your wondering eyes means nothing\r\nto you there; but to those who know New York City it means the height of\r\nthe Flatiron Building built three stories higher. Choose a building of\r\nequal height in your own city, stand beside it and look up. Then imagine\r\nit a gigantic monolithic arch of entrancing proportions and fascinating\r\ncurve, glowing in reds and yellows which merge into each other\r\ninsensibly and without form or pattern. Imagine this fairy unreality\r\noutlined, not against the murk which overlies cities, but against a sky\r\nof desert clarity and color.\r\n\r\nAll natural bridges are created wholly by erosion. This was carved from\r\nan outstanding spur of Navajo sandstone which lay crosswise of the\r\ncanyon. Originally the stream struck full against this barrier, swung\r\nsideways, and found its way around the spur's free outer edge. The end\r\nwas merely a matter of time. Gradually but surely the stream, sand-laden\r\nin times of flood, wore an ever-deepening hollow in the barrier. Finally\r\nit wore it through and passed under what then became a bridge. But\r\nmeantime other agencies were at work. The rocky wall above, alternately\r\nhot and cold, as happens in high arid lands, detached curved, flattened\r\nplates. Worn below by the stream, thinned above by the destructive\r\nprocesses of wind and temperature, the window enlarged. In time the\r\nRainbow Bridge evolved in all its glorious beauty. Not far away is\r\nanother natural bridge well advanced in the making.\r\n\r\nThe Rainbow Bridge was discovered in 1909 by William Boone Douglass,\r\nExaminer of Surveys in the General Land Office, Santa Fe. Following is\r\nan abstract of the government report covering the discovery:\r\n\r\n\"The information had come to Mr. Douglass from a Paiute Indian, Mike's\r\nBoy, who later took the name of Jim, employed as flagman in the survey\r\nof the three great natural bridges of White Canyon. Seeing the white\r\nman's appreciation of this form of wind and water erosion, Jim told of a\r\ngreater bridge known only to himself and one other Indian, located on\r\nthe north side of the Navajo Mountain, in the Paiute Indian reservation.\r\nBending a twig of willow in rainbow-shape, with its ends stuck in the\r\nground, Jim showed what his bridge looked like.\r\n\r\n\"An effort was made to reach the bridge in December. Unfortunately Jim\r\ncould not be located. On reaching the Navajo trading-post, Oljato,\r\nnothing was known of such a bridge, and the truth of Jim's statement was\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n\"The trip was abandoned until August of the following year, when Mr.\r\nDouglass organized a second party at Bluff, Utah, and under Jim's\r\nguidance, left for the bridge. At Oljato the party was augmented by\r\nProfessor Cummings, and a party of college students, with John Wetherill\r\nas packer, who were excavating ruins in the Navajo Indian Reservation.\r\nAs the uninhabited and unknown country of the bridge was reached,\r\ntravel became almost impossible. All equipment, save what was absolutely\r\nindispensable, was discarded. The whole country was a maze of box\r\ncanyons, as though some turbulent sea had suddenly solidified in rock.\r\nOnly at a few favored points could the canyon walls be scaled even by\r\nman, and still fewer where a horse might clamber. In the sloping\r\nsandstone ledges footholds for the horses must be cut, and even then\r\nthey fell, until their loss seemed certain. After many adventures the\r\nparty arrived at 11 o'clock, A.M., August 14, 1909.\r\n\r\n\"Jim had indeed made good. Silhouetted against a turquoise sky was an\r\narch of rainbow shape, so delicately proportioned that it seemed as if\r\nsome great sculptor had hewn it from the rock. Its span of 270 feet\r\nbridged a stream of clear, sparkling water, that flowed 310 feet below\r\nits crest. The world's greatest natural bridge had been found as Jim had\r\ndescribed it. Beneath it, an ancient altar bore witness to the fact that\r\nit was a sacred shrine of those archaic people, the builders of the\r\nweird and mysterious cliff-castles seen in the Navajo National Monument.\r\n\r\n\"The crest of the bridge was reached by Mr. Douglass and his three\r\nassistants, John R. English, Jean F. Rogerson, and Daniel Perkins, by\r\nlowering themselves with ropes to the south abutment, and climbing its\r\narch. Probably they were the first human beings to reach it.\r\n\r\n\"No Indian name for the bridge was known, except such descriptive\r\ngeneric terms as the Paiute 'The space under a horse's belly between its\r\nfore and hind legs,' or the 'Hole in the rock' (nonnezoshi) of the\r\nNavajo, neither of which was deemed appropriate. While the question of a\r\nname was still being debated, there appeared in the sky, as if in\r\nanswer, a beautiful rainbow, the 'Barahoni' of the Paiutes.\r\n\r\n\"The suitability of the name was further demonstrated by a superstition\r\nof the Navajos. On the occasion of his second visit, the fall of the\r\nsame year, Mr. Douglass had as an assistant an old Navajo Indian named\r\nWhite Horse, who, after passing under the bridge, would not return, but\r\nclimbed laboriously around its end. On being pressed for an explanation,\r\nhe would arch his hand, and through it squint at the sun, solemnly\r\nshaking his head. Later, through the assistance of Mrs. John Wetherill,\r\nan experienced Navajo linguist, Mr. Douglass learned that the formations\r\nof the type of the bridge were symbolic rainbows, or the sun's path, and\r\none passing under could not return, under penalty of death, without the\r\nutterance of a certain prayer, which White Horse had forgotten. The aged\r\nNavajo informant would not reveal the prayer for fear of the 'Lightning\r\nSnake.'\"\r\n\r\nIf your return from Rainbow Bridge carries you through Monument Valley\r\nwith its miles of blazing red structures, memory will file still another\r\namazing sensation. Some of its crimson monsters rise a thousand feet\r\nabove the grassy plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL BRIDGES NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nNot many miles north of the Rainbow Bridge, fifty miles from Monticello\r\nin southern Utah, in a region not greatly dissimilar in outline, and\r\nonly less colorful, three natural bridges of large size have been\r\nconserved under the title of the Natural Bridges National Monument.\r\nHere, west of the Mesa Verde, the country is characterized by long,\r\nbroad mesas, sometimes crowned with stunted cedar forests, dropping\r\nsuddenly into deep valleys. The erosion of many thousands of centuries\r\nhas ploughed the surface into winding rock-strewn canyons, great and\r\nsmall. Three of these canyons are crossed by bridges stream-cut through\r\nthe solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe largest, locally known as the Augusta Bridge, is named Sipapu, Gate\r\nof Heaven. It is one of the largest natural bridges in the world,\r\nmeasuring two hundred and twenty-two feet in height, with a span of two\r\nhundred and sixty-one feet. It is a graceful and majestic structure, so\r\nproportioned and finished that it is difficult, from some points of\r\nview, to believe it the unplanned work of natural forces. One crosses it\r\non a level platform twenty-eight feet wide.\r\n\r\nThe other two, which are nearly its size, are found within five miles.\r\nThe Kachina, which means Guardian Spirit, is locally called the Caroline\r\nBridge. The Owachomo, meaning Rock Mound, is locally known as the Edwin\r\nBridge. The local names celebrate persons who visited them soon after\r\nthey were first discovered by Emery Knowles in 1895.\r\n\r\nThey may be reached by horse and pack-train from Monticello, or Bluff,\r\nUtah. One of the five sections of the reservation conserves two large\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nDINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThe Age of Reptile developed a wide variety of monsters in the central\r\nregions of the continent from Montana to the Gulf of Mexico. The\r\ndinosaurs of the Triassic and Jurassic periods sometimes had gigantic\r\nsize, the Brontosaurus attaining a length of sixty feet or more. The\r\nfemur of the Brachiosaurus exceeded six feet; this must have been the\r\ngreatest of them all.\r\n\r\nThe greater dinosaurs were herbivorous. The carnivorous species were not\r\nremarkable for size; there were small leaping forms scarcely larger than\r\nrabbits. The necessity for defense against the flesh-eaters developed,\r\nin the smaller dinosaurs, extremely heavy armor. The stegosaur carried\r\nhuge plates upon his curved back, suggesting a circular saw; his long\r\npowerful tail was armed with sharp spikes, and must have been a\r\ndangerous weapon. Dinosaurs roamed all over what is now called our\r\nmiddle west.\r\n\r\nIn those days the central part of our land was warm and swampy.\r\nFresh-water lagoons and sluggish streams were bordered by low forests of\r\npalms and ferns; one must go to the tropics to find a corresponding\r\nlandscape in our times. The waters abounded in reptiles and fish. Huge\r\nwinged reptiles flew from cover to cover. The first birds were evolving\r\nfrom reptilian forms.\r\n\r\nThe absorbing story of these times is written in the rocks. The life\r\nforms were at their full when the sands were laid which to-day is the\r\nwide-spread layer of sandstone which geologists call the Morrison\r\nformation. Erosion has exposed this sandstone in several parts of the\r\nwestern United States, and many have been the interesting glimpses it\r\nhas afforded of that strange period so many millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the Uintah Basin of northwestern Utah, a region of bad lands crossed\r\nby the Green River on its way to the Colorado and the Grand Canyon, the\r\nMorrison strata have been bent upward at an angle of sixty degrees or\r\nmore and then cut through, exposing their entire depth. The country is\r\nextremely rough and bare. Only in occasional widely separated bottoms\r\nhas irrigation made farming possible; elsewhere nothing grows upon the\r\nbald hillsides.\r\n\r\nHere, eighteen miles east of the town of Vernal, eighty acres of the\r\nexposed Morrison strata were set aside in 1915 as the Dinosaur National\r\nMonument. These acres have already yielded a very large collection of\r\nskeletons. Since 1908 the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh has been\r\ngathering specimens of the greatest importance. The only complete\r\nskeleton of a dinosaur ever found was taken out in 1909. The work of\r\nquarrying and removal is done with the utmost care. The rock is\r\nchiselled away in thin layers, as no one can tell when an invaluable\r\nrelic may be found. As fast as bones are detached, they are covered with\r\nplaster of Paris and so wrapped that breakage becomes impossible. Two\r\nyears were required to unearth the skeleton of a brontosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary massing of fossil remains at this point suggests that\r\nfloods may have swept these animals from a large area and lodged their\r\nbodies here, where they were covered with sands. But it also is possible\r\nthat this spot was merely a favorite feeding-ground. It may be that\r\nsimilarly rich deposits lie hidden in many places in the wide-spread\r\nMorrison sandstone which some day may be unearthed. The bones of\r\ndinosaurs have been found in the Morrison of Colorado near Boulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nFor a hundred and twenty-five or thirty miles southwest of the Grand\r\nCanyon, the valley of the Little Colorado River is known as the Painted\r\nDesert. It is a narrow plain of Carboniferous and Triassic marls,\r\nshales, sandstones, and conglomerates, abounding in fossils, the most\r\narid part of Arizona; even the river's lower reaches dry up for a part\r\nof each year. But it is a palette of brilliant colors; it will be\r\ndifficult to name a tint or shade which is not vividly represented in\r\nthis gaudy floor and in the strata of the cliffs which define its\r\nnorthern and eastern limits. Above and beyond these cliffs lies that\r\nother amazing desert, the Navajo country, the land of the Rainbow Bridge\r\nand the Canyon de Chelly.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the Painted Desert because it is shaped like a long\r\nnarrow finger pointed straight at the Petrified Forests lying just\r\nbeyond its touch. Here the country is also highly colored, but very\r\ndifferently. Maroon and tawny yellow are the prevailing tints of the\r\nmarls, red and brown the colors of the sandstones. There is a rolling\r\nsandy floor crisscrossed with canyons in whose bottoms grow stunted\r\ncedars and occasional cottonwoods. Upon this floor thousands of\r\npetrified logs are heaped in confusion. In many places the strong\r\nsuggestion is that of a log jam left stranded by subsiding floods.\r\nNearly all the logs have broken into short lengths as cleanly cut as if\r\nsawn, the result of succeeding heat and cold.\r\n\r\nAreas of petrified wood are common in many parts of the Navajo country\r\nand its surrounding deserts. The larger areas are marked on the\r\nGeological Survey maps, and many lesser areas are mentioned in reports.\r\nThere are references to rooted stumps. The three groups in the Petrified\r\nForest National Monument, near the town of Adamana, Arizona, were chosen\r\nfor conservation because they are the largest and perhaps the finest; at\r\nthe time, the gorgeously colored logs were being carried away in\r\nquantities to be cut up into table-tops.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, these are not forests. Most of these trees grew\r\nupon levels seven hundred feet or more higher than where they now lie\r\nand at unknown distances; floods left them here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PETRIFIED FOREST OF ARIZONA\r\n\r\nShowing the formation in colored strata. The logs seen on the ground\r\ngrew upon a level seven hundred feet higher]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETRIFIED TRUNK FORMING A BRIDGE OVER A CANYON\r\n\r\nThe trunk is 111 feet long. The stone piers were built to preserve it]\r\n\r\nThe First Forest, which lies six miles south of Adamana, contains\r\nthousands of broken lengths. One unbroken log a hundred and eleven feet\r\nlong bridges a canyon forty-five feet wide, a remarkable spectacle. In\r\nthe Second Forest, which lies two miles and a half south of that, and\r\nthe Third Forest, which is thirteen miles south of Adamana and eighteen\r\nmiles southeast of Holbrook, most of the trunks appear to lie in their\r\noriginal positions. One which was measured by Doctor G.H. Knowlton of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution was more than seven feet in diameter and a\r\nhundred and twenty feet long. He estimates the average diameters at\r\nthree or four feet, while lengths vary from sixty to a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe coloring of the wood is variegated and brilliant. \"The state of\r\nmineralization in which most of this wood exists,\" writes Professor\r\nLester F. Ward, paleobotanist, \"almost places them among the gems or\r\nprecious stones. Not only are chalcedony, opals, and agates found among\r\nthem, but many approach the condition of jasper and onyx.\" \"The\r\nchemistry of the process of petrifaction or silicification,\" writes\r\nDoctor George P. Merrill, Curator of Geology in the National Museum, \"is\r\nnot quite clear. Silica is ordinarily looked upon as one of the most\r\ninsoluble of substances. It is nevertheless readily soluble in alkaline\r\nsolutions--_i.e._, solutions containing soda or potash. It is probable\r\nthat the solutions permeating these buried logs were thus alkaline, and\r\nas the logs gradually decayed their organic matter was replaced,\r\nmolecule by molecule, by silica. The brilliant red and other colors are\r\ndue to the small amount of iron and manganese deposited together with\r\nthe silica, and super-oxydized as the trunks are exposed to the air.\r\nThe most brilliant colors are therefore to be found on the surface.\"\r\n\r\nThe trees are of several species. All those identified by Doctor\r\nKnowlton were Araucaria, which do not now live in the northern\r\nhemisphere. Doctor E.C. Jeffrey, of Harvard, has described one genus\r\nunknown elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo get the Petrified Forest into full prospective it is well to recall\r\nthat these shales and sands were laid in water, above whose surface the\r\nland raised many times, only to sink again and accumulate new strata.\r\nThe plateau now has fifty-seven hundred feet of altitude.\r\n\r\n\"When it is known,\" writes Doctor Knowlton, \"that since the close of\r\nTriassic times probably more than fifty thousand feet of sediments have\r\nbeen deposited, it is seen that the age of the Triassic forests of\r\nArizona can only be reckoned in millions of years--just how many it\r\nwould be mere speculation to attempt to estimate. It is certain, also,\r\nthat at one time the strata containing these petrified logs were\r\nthemselves buried beneath thousands of feet of strata of later ages,\r\nwhich have in places been worn away sufficiently to expose the\r\ntree-bearing beds. Undoubtedly other forests as great or greater than\r\nthose now exposed lie buried beneath the later formations.\"\r\n\r\nA very interesting small forest, not in the reservation, lies nine miles\r\nnorth of Adamana.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPAGO SAGUARO NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of a desert of dry drifting sand unrelieved except at\r\noccasional oases by evidences of life was born of our early geographies,\r\nwhich pictured the Sahara as the desert type. Far different indeed is\r\nour American desert, most of which has a few inches of rainfall in the\r\nearly spring and grows a peculiar flora of remarkable individuality and\r\nbeauty. The creosote bush seen from the car-windows shelters a few\r\ngrasses which brown and die by summer, but help to color the landscape\r\nthe year around. Many low flowering plants gladden the desert\r\nspringtime, and in the far south and particularly in the far southwest\r\nare several varieties of cactus which attain great size. The frequenter\r\nof the desert soon correlates its flora with its other scenic elements\r\nand finds all rich and beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern Arizona and along the southern border of California this\r\nstrange flora finds its fullest expression. Here one enters a new\r\nfairy-land, a region of stinging bushes and upstanding monsters lifting\r\nungainly arms to heaven. In 1914, to conserve one of the many rich\r\ntracts of desert flora, President Wilson created the Papago Saguaro\r\nNational Monument a few miles east of Phoenix, Arizona. Its two thousand\r\nand fifty acres include fine examples of innumerable desert species in\r\nfullest development.\r\n\r\nAmong these the cholla is at once one of the most fascinating and the\r\nmost exasperating. It belongs to the prickly pear family, but there\r\nresemblance ceases. It is a stocky bush two or three feet high covered\r\nwith balls of flattened powerful sharp-pointed needles which will\r\npenetrate even a heavy shoe. In November these fall, strewing the ground\r\nwith spiny indestructible weapons. There are many varieties of chollas\r\nand all are decorative. The tree cholla grows from seven to ten feet in\r\nheight, a splendid showy feature of the desert slopes, and the home,\r\nfortress, and sure defense for all the birds who can find nest-room\r\nbehind its bristling breastwork.\r\n\r\nThe Cereus thurberi, the pipe-organ, or candelabrum cactus, as it is\r\nvariously called, grows in thick straight columns often clumped closely\r\ntogether, a picturesque and beautiful creation. Groups range from a few\r\ninches to many feet in height. One clump of twenty-two stems has been\r\nreported, the largest stem of which was twenty feet high and twenty-two\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nAnother of picturesque appeal is the bisnaga or barrel cactus, of which\r\nthere are many species of many sizes. Like all cacti, it absorbs water\r\nduring the brief wet season and stores it for future use. A specimen the\r\nsize of a flour-barrel can be made to yield a couple of gallons of\r\nsweetish but refreshing water, whereby many a life has been saved in the\r\nsandy wastes.\r\n\r\nBut the desert's chief exhibit is the giant saguaro, the Cereus\r\ngiganteus, from which the reservation got its name. This stately cactus\r\nrises in a splendid green column, accordion-plaited and decorated with\r\nstar-like clusters of spines upon the edges of the plaits. The larger\r\nspecimens grow as high as sixty or seventy feet and throw out at\r\nintervals powerful branches which bend sharply upward; sometimes there\r\nare as many as eight or nine of these gigantic branches.\r\n\r\nNo towering fir or spreading oak carries a more princely air. A forest\r\nof giant saguaro rising from a painted desert far above the tangle of\r\ncreosote-bush, mesquite, cholla, bisnaga, and scores of other strange\r\ngrowths of a land of strange attractions is a spectacle to stir the\r\nblood and to remember for a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORADO NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nOn the desert border of far-western Colorado near Grand Junction is a\r\nregion of red sandstone which the erosion of the ages has carved into\r\ninnumerable strange and grotesque shapes. Once a great plain, then a\r\ngroup of mesas, now it has become a city of grotesque monuments. Those\r\nwho have seen the Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs can imagine\r\nit multiplied many times in size, grotesqueness, complexity, and area;\r\nsuch a vision will approximate the Colorado National Monument. The two\r\nregions have other relations in common, for as the Garden of the Gods\r\nflanks the Rockies' eastern slopes and looks eastward to the great\r\nplains, so does the Colorado National Monument flank the Rockies'\r\nwestern desert. Both are the disclosure by erosion of similar strata of\r\nred sandstone which may have been more or less continuous before the\r\ngreat Rockies wrinkled, lifted, and burst upward between them.\r\n\r\nThe rock monuments of this group are extremely highly colored. They rise\r\nin several neighboring canyons and some of them are of great height and\r\nfantastic design. One is a nearly circular column with a diameter of a\r\nhundred feet at the base and a height of more than four hundred feet.\r\n\r\nCaves add to the attractions, and there are many springs among the\r\ntangled growths of the canyon floors. There are cedars and pinyon trees.\r\nThe region abounds in mule-deer and other wild animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPULIN MOUNTAIN NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nAfter the sea-bottom which is now our desert southwest rose for the last\r\ntime and became the lofty plateau of to-day, many were the changes by\r\nwhich its surface became modified. Chief of these was the erosion which\r\nhas washed its levels thousands of feet below its potential altitude and\r\ncarved it so remarkably. But it also became a field of wide-spread\r\nvolcanic activity, and lavas and obsidians are constantly encountered\r\namong its gravels, sands, and shales. Many also are the cones of dead\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nCapulin Mountain in northeastern New Mexico near the Colorado line is a\r\nvery ancient volcano which retains its shape in nearly perfect\r\ncondition. It was made a national monument for scientific reasons, but\r\nit also happily rounds out the national parks' exhibit of the influences\r\nwhich created our wonderful southwest. Its crater cone is composed\r\npartly of lava flow, partly of fine loose cinder, and partly of cemented\r\nvolcanic ash. It is nearly a perfect cone.\r\n\r\nCapulin rises fifteen hundred feet from the plain to an altitude of\r\neight thousand feet. Its crater is fifteen hundred feet across and\r\nseventy-five feet deep. To complete the volcanic exhibit many blister\r\ncones are found around its base. It is easily reached from two railroads\r\nor by automobile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE MUIR WOODS AND OTHER NATIONAL MONUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nNational monuments which commemorate history, conserve forests, and\r\ndistinguish conspicuous examples of world-making dot other parts of the\r\nUnited States besides the colorful southwest. Their variety is great and\r\nthe natural beauty of some of them unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nTheir number should be much greater. Every history-helping exploration\r\nof the early days, from Cortreal's inspection of the upper Atlantic\r\ncoast in 1501 and Ponce de Leon's exploration of Florida eleven years\r\nlater, from Cabrillo's skirting of the Pacific coast in 1542 and\r\nVancouver's entrance into Puget Sound in 1792, including every early\r\nexpedition from north and south into the country now ours and every\r\nexploration of the interior by our own people, should be commemorated,\r\nnot by a slab of bronze or marble, but by a striking and appropriate\r\narea set apart as a definite memorial of the history of this nation's\r\nearly beginnings.\r\n\r\nThese areas should be appropriately located upon or overlooking some\r\nimportant or characteristic landmark of the explorations or events which\r\nthey commemorated, and should have scenic importance sufficient to\r\nattract visitors and impress upon them the stages of the progress of\r\nthis land from a condition of wilderness to settlement and civilization.\r\n\r\nNor should it end here. The country is richly endowed, from the Atlantic\r\nto the Pacific, with examples of Nature's amazing handicraft in the\r\nmaking of this continent, the whole range of which should be fully\r\nexpressed in national reservations.\r\n\r\nBesides these, examples of our northeastern forests, the pines of the\r\nsouthern Appalachians, the everglades of Florida, the tangled woodlands\r\nof the gulf, and other typical forests which perchance may have escaped\r\nthe desolation of civilization, should be added to the splendid forest\r\nreserves of the national parks of the West, first-grown as Nature made\r\nthem, forever to remain untouched by the axe.\r\n\r\nThus will the national parks system become the real national museum for\r\nto-day and forever.\r\n\r\nThere follows a brief catalogue of the slender and altogether fortuitous\r\nbeginnings of such an exhibit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUIR WOODS NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nOne of the last remaining stands of original redwood forest easily\r\naccessible to the visitor is the Muir Woods in California. It occupies a\r\npicturesque canyon on the slope of Mount Tamalpais, north of the Golden\r\nGate and opposite San Francisco, from which it is comfortably reached by\r\nferry and railroad. It was rescued from the axe by William Kent of\r\nCalifornia, who, jointly with Mrs. Kent, gave it to the nation as an\r\nexhibit of the splendid forest which once crowded the shores of San\r\nFrancisco Bay. It is named after John Muir, to whom this grove was a\r\nfavorite retreat for many years.\r\n\r\nIt exhibits many noble specimens of the California redwood, Sequoia\r\nsempervirens, cousin of the giant sequoia. Some of them attain a height\r\nof three hundred feet, with a diameter exceeding eighteen feet. They\r\nstand usually in clusters, or family groups, their stems erect as\r\npillars, their crowns joined in a lofty roof, rustling in the Pacific\r\nwinds, musical with the songs of birds. Not even in the giant sequoia\r\ngroves of the Sierra have I found any spot more cathedral-like than\r\nthis. Its floor is brown and sweet-smelling, its aisles outlined by the\r\ntread of generations of worshippers. Its naves, transepts, alcoves, and\r\nsanctuaries are still and dim, yet filled mysteriously with light.\r\n\r\nThe Muir Woods is a grove of noble redwoods, but it is much more. Apart\r\nfrom its main passages, in alcove, gateway, and outlying precinct it is\r\nan exhibit of the rich Californian coast forest. The Douglas fir here\r\nreaches stately proportions. Many of the western oaks display their\r\nmanifold picturesqueness. A hundred lesser trees and shrubs add their\r\ngrace and variety. The forest is typical and complete. Though small in\r\nscope it is not a remnant but naturally blends into its surroundings.\r\nThe shaded north hill slopes carry the great trees to the ridge line;\r\nthe southern slope exhibits the struggle for precedence with the\r\nmountain shrubs. At the lower end one bursts out into the grass country\r\nand the open hills. Every feature of the loveliest of all forests is at\r\nhand: the valley floor with its miniature trout-stream overhung with\r\nfragrant azaleas; the brown carpet interwoven with azaleas and violets.\r\nThere is the cool decoration of many ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Tibbitts_\r\n\r\nCATHEDRAL ISLE OF THE MUIR WOODS]\r\n\r\nThe straight-growing redwoods compel a change of habit in the trees\r\nthat would struggle toward a view of the sky. Mountain-oaks and madrona\r\nare straight-trunked and clear of lower branches. There is rivalry of\r\nthe strong and protection for the weak.\r\n\r\nThe grove is, in truth, a complete expression in little of Nature's\r\nforest plan. The characteristics of the greater redwood forests which\r\nrequire weeks or months to compass and careful correlation to bring into\r\nperspective, here are exhibited within the rambling of a day. The Muir\r\nWoods is an entity. Its meadow borders, its dark ravines, its valley\r\nfloor, its slopes and hilltops, all show fullest luxuriance and perfect\r\nproportion. The struggle of the greater trees to climb the hills is\r\nexemplified as fully as in the great exhibits of the north, which spread\r\nover many miles of hill slope; here one may see its range in half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe coloring, too, is rich. The rusty foliage and bark, the brighter\r\ngreen of the shrubs, the brown carpet, the opal light, stirs the spirit.\r\nThe powerful individuality of many of its trees is the source of\r\nnever-ending pleasure. There is a redwood upon the West Fork which has\r\nno living base, but feeds, vampire-like, through another's veins; or,\r\nif you prefer the figure of family dependence so strikingly exemplified\r\nin these woods, has been rescued from destruction by a brother. The base\r\nof this tree has been completely girdled by fire. Impossible to draw\r\nsubsistence from below, it stands up from a burned, naked, slender\r\nfoundation. But another tree fell against it twenty-five or thirty feet\r\nabove the ground, in some far past storm, and lost its top; this tree\r\npours its sap into the veins of the other to support its noble top. The\r\ntwin cripples have become a single healthy tree.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking exhibits of the Muir Woods is its tangle of\r\nCalifornia laurel. Even in its deepest recesses, the bays, as they are\r\ncommonly called, reach great size. They sprawl in all directions, bend\r\nat sharp angles, make great loops to enter the soil and root again;\r\nsometimes they cross each other and join their trunks; in one instance,\r\nat least, a large crownless trunk has bent and entered head first the\r\nstem of still a larger tree.\r\n\r\nThere are greater stands of virgin redwoods in the northern wilderness\r\nof California which the ruthless lumberman has not yet reached but is\r\napproaching fast; these are inland stands of giants, crowded like\r\nbattalions. But there is no other Muir Woods, with its miniature\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVIL'S POSTPILE NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nSoutheast of craggy Lyell, mountain climax and eastern outpost of the\r\nYosemite National Park, the Muir Trail follows the extravagantly\r\nbeautiful beginnings of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River through\r\na region of myriad waters and snow-flecked mountains. Banner Peak,\r\nRitter Mountain, Thousand Island Lake, Volcanic Ridge, Shadow\r\nLake--national park scenery in its noblest expression, but not yet\r\nnational park.\r\n\r\nA score of miles from Lyell, the trail follows the river into a volcanic\r\nbottom from whose forest rises the splendid group of pentagonal basaltic\r\ncolumns which was made a national monument in 1911 under the title of\r\nthe Devil's Postpile. Those who know the famous Giant's Causeway of the\r\nIrish coast will know it in kind, but not in beauty.\r\n\r\nThe enormous uplift which created the Sierra was accompanied on both its\r\nslopes by extensive volcanic eruptions, the remains of which are\r\nfrequently visible to the traveller. The huge basaltic crystals of the\r\nDevil's Postpile were a product of this volcanic outpouring; they formed\r\ndeep within the hot masses which poured over the region for miles\r\naround. Their upper ends have become exposed by the erosion of the ages\r\nby which the cinder soil and softer rock around them have been worn\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe trail traveller comes suddenly upon this splendid group. It is\r\nelevated, as if it were the front of a small ridge, its posts standing\r\non end, side by side, in close formation. Below it, covering the front\r\nof the ridge down to the line of the trail, is an enormous talus mass of\r\nbroken pieces. The appropriateness of the name strikes one at the first\r\nglance. This is really a postpile, every post carefully hewn to pattern,\r\nall of nearly equal length. The talus heap below suggests that his\r\nSatanic Majesty was utilizing it also as a woodpile, and had sawn many\r\nof the posts into lengths to fit the furnaces which we have been taught\r\nthat he keeps hot for the wicked.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is a beautiful, interesting, and even an imposing\r\nspectacle. One also thinks of it as a gigantic organ, whose many hundred\r\npipes rise many feet in air. Its lofty position, seen from the viewpoint\r\nof the trail, is one of dignity; it overlooks the pines and firs\r\nsurrounding the clearing in which the observer stands. The trees on the\r\nhigher level scarcely overtop it; in part, it is outlined against the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\"The Devil's Postpile,\" writes Professor Joseph N. LeConte, Muir's\r\nsuccessor as the prophet of the Sierra, \"is a wonderful cliff of\r\ncolumnar basalt, facing the river. The columns are quite perfect prisms,\r\nnearly vertical and fitted together like the cells of a honeycomb. Most\r\nof the prisms are pentagonal, though some are of four or six sides. The\r\nstanding columns are about two feet in diameter and forty feet high. At\r\nthe base of the cliff is an enormous basalt structure, but, wherever the\r\nbed-rock is exposed beneath the pumice covering, the same formation can\r\nbe seen.\"\r\n\r\nAn error in the proclamation papers made the official title of this\r\nmonument the Devil Postpile, and thus it must legally appear in all\r\nofficial documents.\r\n\r\nThe reservation also includes the Rainbow Fall of the San Juan River,\r\none of the most beautiful waterfalls of the sub-Sierra region, besides\r\nsoda springs and hot springs. This entire reservation was originally\r\nincluded in the Yosemite National Park, but was cut out by an\r\nunappreciative committee appointed to revise boundaries. It is to be\r\nhoped that Congress will soon restore it to its rightful status.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVIL'S TOWER NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nA structure similar in nature to the Devil's Postpile, but vastly\r\ngreater in size and sensational quality, forms one of the most striking\r\nnatural spectacles east of the Rocky Mountains. The Devil's Tower is\r\nunique. It rises with extreme abruptness from the rough Wyoming levels\r\njust west of the Black Hills. It is on the banks of the Belle Fourche\r\nRiver, which later, encircling the Black Hills around the north, finds\r\nits way into the Big Cheyenne and the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary tower emerges from a rounded forested hill of\r\nsedimentary rock which rises six hundred feet above the plain; from the\r\ntop of that the tower rises six hundred feet still higher. It is visible\r\nfor a hundred miles or more in every direction. Before the coming of the\r\nwhite man it was the landmark of the Indians. Later it served a useful\r\npurpose in guiding the early explorers.\r\n\r\nTo-day it is the point which draws the eye for many miles. The visitor\r\napproaching by automobile sees it hours away, and its growth upon the\r\nhorizon as he approaches is not his least memorable experience. It has\r\nthe effect at a distance of an enormous up-pointing finger which has\r\nbeen amputated just below the middle joint. When near enough to enable\r\none to distinguish the upright flutings formed by its closely joined\r\npentagonal basaltic prisms, the illusion vanishes. These, bending inward\r\nfrom a flaring base, straighten and become nearly perpendicular as they\r\nrise. Now, one may fancy it the stump of a tree more than a hundred feet\r\nin diameter whose top imagination sees piercing the low clouds. But\r\nclose by, all similes become futile; then the Devil's Tower can be\r\nlikened to nothing but itself.\r\n\r\nThis column is the core of a volcanic formation which doubtless once had\r\na considerably larger circumference. At its base lies an immense talus\r\nof broken columns which the loosening frosts and the winter gales are\r\nconstantly increasing; the process has been going on for untold\r\nthousands of years, during which the softer rock of the surrounding\r\nplains has been eroded to its present level.\r\n\r\nOne may climb the hill and the talus. The column itself cannot be\r\nclimbed except by means of special apparatus. Its top is nearly flat and\r\nelliptical, with a diameter varying from sixty to a hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINNACLES NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by Tibbitts_\r\n\r\nPINNACLES NATIONAL MONUMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph by N.H. Darion_\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S TOWER]\r\n\r\nForty miles as the crow flies east of Monterey, California, in a spur\r\nof the low Coast Range, is a region which erosion has carved into many\r\nfantastic shapes. Because of its crowded pointed rocks, it has been set\r\napart under the title of the Pinnacles National Monument. For more than\r\na century and a quarter it was known as Vancouver's Pinnacles because\r\nthe great explorer visited it while his ships lay at anchor in Monterey\r\nBay, and afterward described it in his \"Voyages and Discoveries.\" It is\r\nunfortunate that the historical allusion was lost when it became a\r\nnational reservation.\r\n\r\nTwo deep gorges, bordered by fantastic walls six hundred to a thousand\r\nfeet high, and a broad semi-circular, flower-grown amphitheatre,\r\nconstitute the central feature. Deep and narrow tributary gorges furnish\r\nmany of the curious and intricate forms which for many years have made\r\nthe spot popular among sightseers. Rock masses have fallen upon the side\r\nwalls of several of these lesser gorges, converting them into\r\npicturesque winding tunnels and changing deep alcoves into caves which\r\nrequire candles to see.\r\n\r\nIt is a region of very unusual interest and charm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOSHONE CAVERN NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nOn the way to the Yellowstone National Park by way of the Wyoming\r\nentrance at Cody, and three miles east of the great Shoshone Dam, a\r\nlimestone cave has been set apart under the title of the Shoshone Cavern\r\nNational Monument. The way in is rough and precipitous and, after\r\nentering the cave, a descent by rope is necessary to reach the chambers\r\nof unusual beauty. One may then journey for more than a mile through\r\ngalleries some of which are heavily incrusted with crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS AND CLARK CAVERN NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nApproaching the crest of the Rockies on the Northern Pacific Railroad,\r\nthe Lewis and Clark Cavern is passed fifty miles before reaching Butte.\r\nIts entrance is perched thirteen hundred feet above the broad valley of\r\nthe Jefferson River, which the celebrated explorers followed on their\r\nwestward journey; it overlooks fifty miles of their course.\r\n\r\nThe cavern, which has the usual characteristics of a limestone cave,\r\nslopes sharply back from its main entrance, following the dip of the\r\nstrata. Some of its vaults are decorated in great splendor. The\r\ndepredations of vandals were so damaging that in 1916 its entrance was\r\nclosed by an iron gate.\r\n\r\nThis cavern is the only memorial of the Lewis and Clark expedition in\r\nthe national parks system; there is no record that the explorers entered\r\nit or knew of its existence.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and thirty miles east of the Cavern, Clark inscribed his\r\nname and the date, July 25, 1806, upon the face of a prominent butte\r\nknown as Pompey's Pillar. This would have been a far more appropriate\r\nmonument to the most important of American explorations than the\r\nlimestone cave. In fact, the Department of the Interior once attempted\r\nto have it proclaimed a national monument; the fact that it lay within\r\nan Indian allotment prevented. The entire course of this great\r\nexpedition should be marked at significant points by appropriate\r\nnational monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND CAVE NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nIn the southwestern corner of South Dakota, on the outskirts of the\r\nBlack Hills, is one of the most interesting limestone caverns of the\r\ncountry. It was named Wind Cave because, with the changes of temperature\r\nduring the day, strong currents of wind blow alternately into and out of\r\nits mouth. It has many long passages and fine chambers gorgeously\r\ndecorated. It is a popular resort.\r\n\r\nThe United States Biological Survey maintains a game-preserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWEL CAVE NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Wind Cave, thirteen miles west and south of Custer, South\r\nDakota boasts another limestone cavern of peculiar beauty, through whose\r\nentrance also the wind plays pranks. It is called Jewel Cave because\r\nmany of its crystals are tinted in various colors, often very\r\nbrilliantly. Under torchlight the effect is remarkable.\r\n\r\nConnecting chambers have been explored for more than three miles, and\r\nthere is much of it yet unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON CAVES NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nIn the far southwestern corner of Oregon, about thirty miles south of\r\nGrant's Pass, upon slopes of coast mountains and at an altitude of four\r\nthousand feet, is a group of large limestone caves which have been set\r\napart by presidential proclamation under the title of the Oregon Caves\r\nNational Monument. Locally they are better known as the Marble Halls of\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nThere are two entrances at different levels, the passages and chambers\r\nfollowing the dip of the strata. A considerable stream, the outlet of\r\nthe waters which dissolved these caves in the solid limestone, passes\r\nthrough. The wall decorations, and, in some of the chambers, the\r\nstalagmites and stalactites, are exceedingly fine. The vaults and\r\npassages are unusually large. There is one chamber twenty-five feet\r\nacross whose ceiling is believed to be two hundred feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT OLYMPUS NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nFor sixty miles or more east and west across the Olympian Peninsula,\r\nwhich is the forested northwestern corner of Washington and the United\r\nStates between Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean, stretch the Olympian\r\nMountains. The country is a rugged wilderness of tumbled ranges, grown\r\nwith magnificent forests above which rise snowy and glaciered summits.\r\nIts climax is Mount Olympus, eight thousand one hundred feet in\r\naltitude, rising about twenty-five miles equidistant from the Strait of\r\nJuan de Fuca upon the north and the Pacific Ocean upon the west.\r\n\r\nThe entire peninsula is extremely wild. It is skirted by a road along\r\nits eastern and part of its northern edges, connecting the water-front\r\ntowns. Access to the mountain is by arduous trail. The reservation\r\ncontains nine hundred and fifty square miles. Although possessing\r\nunusual scenic beauty, it was reserved for the purpose of protecting the\r\nOlympic elk, a species peculiar to the region. Deer and other wild\r\nanimals also are abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEELER NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nHigh under the Continental Divide in southwestern Colorado near Creede,\r\na valley of high altitude, grotesquely eroded in tufa, rhyolite, and\r\nother volcanic rock, is named the Wheeler National Monument in honor of\r\nCaptain George Montague Wheeler, who conducted geographical explorations\r\nbetween 1869 and 1879. Its deep canyons are bordered by lofty pinnacles\r\nof rock. It is believed that General John C. Fremont here met the\r\ndisaster which drove back his exploring-party of 1848, fragments of\r\nharness and camp equipment and skeletons of mules having been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERENDRYE NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nThe first exploration of the northern United States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains is commemorated by the Verendrye National Monument at the Old\r\nCrossing of the Missouri River in North Dakota. Here rises Crowhigh\r\nButte, on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, an eminence commanding a\r\nwide view in every direction.\r\n\r\nVerendrye, the celebrated French explorer, started from the north shore\r\nof Lake Superior about 1740 and passed westward and southward into the\r\nregions of the great plains. He or his sons, for the records of their\r\njourneys are confusing, passed westward into Montana along a course\r\nwhich Lewis and Clark paralleled in 1806, swung southward in the\r\nneighborhood of Fort Benton, and skirted the Rockies nearly to the\r\nmiddle of Wyoming, passing within a couple of hundred miles of the\r\nYellowstone National Park.\r\n\r\nCrowhigh Butte is supposed to have given the Verendryes their first\r\nextensive view of the upper Missouri. The butte was long a landmark to\r\nguide early settlers to Old Crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULLY'S HILL NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nCongress created the Sully's Hill National Park in North Dakota in 1904\r\nin response to a local demand. Its hills and meadows constitute a museum\r\nof practically the entire flora of the State. The United States\r\nBiological Survey maintains there a wild-animal preserve for elk, bison,\r\nantelope, and other animals representative of the northern plains.\r\n\r\n\r\nSITKA NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nOn Baranoff Island, upon the southeastern shore of Alaska, is a\r\nreservation known as the Sitka National Monument which commemorates an\r\nimportant episode in the early history of Alaska. On this tract, which\r\nlies within a mile of the steamboat-landing at Sitka, formerly stood the\r\nvillage of the Kik-Siti Indians who, in 1802, attacked the settlement of\r\nSitka and massacred the Russians who had established it. Two years\r\nlater the Russians under Baranoff recovered the settlement from the\r\nIndians, contrary to the active opposition of Great Britain, and\r\nestablished the title which they afterward transferred to the United\r\nStates. Graves of some of those who fell in the later battle may be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe reservation is also a fine exhibit of the forest and flora of the\r\nAlexander Archipelago. Sixteen totem-poles remain from the old native\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD KASAAN NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nRemains of the rapidly passing native life of the Alexander Archipelago\r\non the southeast coast of Alaska are conserved in the Old Kasaan\r\nNational Monument on the east shore of Prince of Wales Island. The\r\nvillage of Old Kasaan, occupied for many years by the Hydah tribe and\r\nabandoned a decade or more ago, contains several community houses of\r\nsplit timber, each of which consists of a single room with a common\r\nfireplace in the middle under a smoke-hole in the centre of the roof.\r\nCedar sleeping-booths, each the size of an ordinary piano-box, are built\r\naround the wall.\r\n\r\nThe monument also possesses fifty totem-poles, carved and richly\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-six national monuments, twenty-four are administered by\r\nthe National Parks Service, ten by the Department of Agriculture, and\r\ntwo by the War Department. Congress made the assignments to the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture on the theory that, as these monuments\r\noccurred in forests, they could be more cheaply administered by the\r\nForest Service; but, as many of the other monuments and nearly all the\r\nnational parks also occur in forests, the logic is not apparent, and\r\nthese monuments suffer from disassociation with the impetus and\r\nmachinery of the National Park Service.\r\n\r\nThe Big Hole Battlefield National Monument, about fifty-five miles\r\nsouthwest of Butte, Montana, was assigned to the War Department because\r\na battle took place there in 1877 between a small force of United States\r\ntroops and a large force of Indians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, CALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROPOSED ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK AND THE SEQUOIA AND\r\nGENERAL GRANT NATIONAL PARKS, CALIFORNIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, COLORADO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, OREGON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYOMING\r\n\r\nThe proposed Jackson Hole addition is enclosed by a broken line south of\r\nboundary]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, MONTANA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, COLORADO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, ARIZONA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZION NATIONAL MONUMENT, UTAH]",
