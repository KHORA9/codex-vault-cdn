LTD.\r\n                        AT THE BALLANTYNE PRESS\r\n                            LONDON, ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900 the present writer published a small volume entitled\r\n“Studies in Jamaica History,” giving the records of certain historic\r\nsites in the colony.\r\n\r\nIn its issue of October 27, 1908, the Editor of the “West India\r\nCommittee Circular,” commenting on the appointment of a Royal Commission\r\nto enumerate and report upon the historical monuments in England, drew\r\nattention to the need for the preservation of historic sites and\r\nbuildings in the West Indies, and stated that a letter on the subject\r\nhad been addressed by the West India Committee to the Colonial Office.\r\nOn November 24 he was able to state that the Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies (the Earl of Crewe) sympathised with the object of the West\r\nIndia Committee and had forwarded their representations to the governors\r\nof the various West Indian colonies, recommending them to their\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica the present writer, at the request of the Governor (Sir\r\nSydney Olivier) and with the consent of the Board of Governors of the\r\nInstitute of Jamaica, undertook to prepare a list, parish by parish, of\r\nhistoric sites, buildings and monuments, stating in each case the nature\r\nof its interest and the name of its owner. This list was published as a\r\nspecial supplement to the “Jamaica Gazette” on December 23, 1909; and in\r\nNovember 1912 it was reprinted as part of a report relating to the\r\npreservation of historic sites and ancient monuments and buildings in\r\nthe West Indian colonies presented to Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the present writer had commenced a series of articles in\r\nthe “West India Committee Circular” dealing with historic sites and\r\nmonuments in Jamaica, which appeared from October 1909 till October\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of various persons interested in the subject it was\r\ndecided to reprint these articles. In doing this it has been thought\r\nwell to arrange them parish by parish and to add a few words of general\r\nhistory, taken in part from the writer’s contributions to the “Handbook\r\nof Jamaica,” and of descriptions of sites and monuments which have not\r\nbeen treated of individually.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the following notes may not only serve the double\r\npurpose of evoking interest in the history of the colony in the minds of\r\nits inhabitants and proving a source of information to visitors, but may\r\nbe the means of steps being taken to preserve old buildings and other\r\nmonuments alike from decay and the hand of man.\r\n\r\nA list of works consulted in the compilation of the notes embodied in\r\nthis volume would comprise almost all the books in the Jamaica section\r\nof the West India Library of the Institute of Jamaica, some 1400 in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Mrs. Lionel Lee for making the illustrations and to\r\nMr. Algernon E. Aspinall for kind assistance in seeing the work through\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\n                                                                   F.

How long they had been here\r\nwhen Columbus discovered the island no one can say for certain, though\r\nthe thickness and extent of their middens, some thirty of which have\r\nbeen opened from time to time, offer evidence of value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARAWÂK BOWL\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs in Hispaniola, the natives of Jamaica were ruled over by caciques or\r\nchieftains. The estimates of historians of the number of inhabitants in\r\nthe West Indian islands differ widely. Las Casas says that the islands\r\nabounded with inhabitants as an ant-hill with ants, and puts them down\r\nat 6,000,000. But Peter Martyr gives but 1,200,000 to Hispaniola and,\r\ntaking this as a guide, there would probably have been about 600,000 in\r\nJamaica—or, roughly speaking, three-quarters of its present population.\r\nNot many were left when the English took the island in 1655.\r\n\r\nJudged by the English standard, Indians are short in stature. The\r\nArawâks of Guiana to-day are described as being of a red cinnamon in\r\ncolour. The hair on the scalp is thick, long, very straight and very\r\nblack. The features of the face are strikingly like those familiarly\r\nknown as Chinese (Mongolian), and the expression is decidedly gentle.\r\nPhysically they are weak, and life hardly ever exceeds fifty years. The\r\nnatives of Jamaica—as a few skulls found from time to time\r\ntestify—possessed, in common with other West Indian tribes, the\r\npeculiarity of tying boards on to the foreheads of their children in\r\nsuch a way that the skulls assumed and permanently retained an\r\nextraordinarily flat shape.\r\n\r\nPeter Martyr, who heard it spoken, said that the language in the Greater\r\nAntilles was “soft and not less liquid than the Latin,” and “rich in\r\nvowels and pleasant to the ear.” Of words of West Indian origin, those\r\nmost frequently in use in the English language are avocado (aguacate)\r\npear, barbecue, buccaneer, canoe, Carib and its derivative cannibal,\r\nguava, hammock, hurricane, iguana, maize, manatee, pirogue, potato and\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nColumbus has told us of a cacique of Cuba who believed in a future state\r\ndependent on one’s actions in this world, but Sir Everard im Thurn found\r\nnothing of the kind amongst the Indians of Guiana, and it is probable\r\nthat Columbus’s guide from Guanahani (Watling Island) only partially\r\nunderstood the cacique, or that Columbus only partially understood his\r\nguide. Their houses were primitive alike in shape and construction. In\r\nJamaica, they were probably circular, and were provided with walls of\r\nwattle work plastered with mud, and with a high-pitched roof of palm\r\nleaves; they probably had no windows. The Indians slept in hammocks. The\r\nweapons of the Arawâks of Jamaica and the other large islands consisted\r\nof darts and war clubs; but they apparently did not possess bows and\r\narrows, which were the form of weapons preferred by the Caribs, and the\r\nuse of which gave them a great advantage over their more peaceful foes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEALING-STONE\r\n]\r\n\r\nOrnaments were more worn by the men than the women. Painting was the\r\nsimplest form of ornamentation; the colours used being blue, black,\r\ncarmine, white and yellow, derived from plants and earths. They wore\r\nnecklets of hogs’ teeth and stone beads, crowns of feathers in their\r\nheads, aprons of palm-leaves or woven cotton, and bands round their arms\r\nand legs. Their chief occupations and means of living were hunting and\r\nfishing and agricultural pursuits with, in some cases, a certain amount\r\nof trading. As they required nothing more than canoes for travelling on\r\nthe water, simple houses to live in, baskets for domestic purposes,\r\nhammocks for rest, rude weapons of the chase, and implements such as\r\nhatchets and chisels, earthen vessels, and a few ornaments and articles\r\nof dress, these, with a few crude rock-carvings, formed the sum total of\r\ntheir arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\nIn common with the other aborigines of the West Indies generally and\r\nwith the natives of New Zealand and with all the nomad tribes of the new\r\nworld from Patagonia to the Arctic circle, the Arawâks of Jamaica were,\r\nwhen discovered, without any knowledge of the metals as such. From their\r\nkitchen middens we know that they were great fish eaters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARAWÂK PESTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\nUntil 1895, but few remains had been discovered to testify to the\r\nexistence of a tribe which not so very long ago lived by gathering the\r\nfruits of the land and sea of Jamaica. During that and the following\r\nyears several collections of Indian remains were found.[2] They are\r\nscattered fairly throughout the island, except curiously enough, the\r\neastern end, and are thickly grouped in St. Andrew and Vere, in St. Ann,\r\nand in the west end of Westmoreland. They all supply objects similar in\r\ncharacter and giving evidence of no very high advance in civilization or\r\nthe arts; being considerably below those of Mexico and Peru. The objects\r\nconsist for the most part of petaloid or almond-shaped polished celts of\r\nmetamorphic or igneous rocks, found somewhat abundantly all over the\r\nisland; circular or oval, shallow, unglazed bowls of baked pottery, with\r\nbut crude ornamentation, used in the preparation of food, and some as\r\nmortuary vessels for the heads of their chiefs—found here and there in\r\nthe caves and on the sites of dwellings; calcedony beads, hitherto\r\nfound, curiously enough, only in Vere; stone and wooden images and\r\nrock-carvings and the rock-pictures; and a few shell and flint\r\nimplements and mealing-stones rarely found.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  For this subject consult “Aboriginal Indian Remains in Jamaica. By J.\r\n  E. Duerden, A.R.C.Sc., Kingston, Ja., 1897.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that many of the objects shown at an exhibition of\r\nnative remains held at the Institute of Jamaica in 1895, following on\r\nthe discovery of the Halberstadt cave, as well as others discovered\r\nlater, should have been allowed to leave the island. Such things once\r\nlost can rarely be regained.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the early Spanish historians—putting as they frequently did X\r\nfor J—wrote the name of the island _Xaymaca_, but it appears in its\r\npresent form as early as 1511 in Peter Martyr’s “Decades.” He called it\r\n_Jamaica_ and _Jamica_. The island is unnamed in Juan de la Cosa’s map\r\nof 1500.\r\n\r\nIts first appearance in cartography is on the map made by Bartolommeo\r\nColombo, Columbus’s younger brother, to illustrate the admiral’s fourth\r\nvoyage, where it is spelled _Jamaicha_. In Cantino’s map (1502–04) it\r\nappears as _Jamaiqua_: in Caneiro as _Jamaiqua_ and in Waldseemüller’s\r\nmap of 1507 as _Jamaiana_. In the so-called Admiral’s map of 1507 it\r\nappears as _Jamaqua_: the name does not appear in Ruysch’s map of 1508,\r\nbut in the Ptolemaeus edition, Strasburg 1513, it is given as\r\n_Jamaiqua_, and in the Waldseemüller map of 1516 it is also _Jamaiqua_.\r\n\r\nIn the Maggiolo map of 1519 it is _Jamaica_, but in the Maggiolo map of\r\n1527 it is _Jamaicha_: in Ribero’s “Antilles” of 1529 and in Mercator’s\r\nmap of 1541 it is _Jamaica_: but in Herrera’s map of 1601, it goes back\r\nto the old form _Xamaica_, and as late as 1734 in Charlevoix’s “L’isle\r\nEspagnole,” it appears as _Xamayca_. Amongst Englishmen who wrote of it\r\nfrom personal knowledge immediately after the British occupation,\r\nCommissioner Butler (1655) wrote it _Gemecoe_ and _Gemegoe_. Daniell\r\n(1655) calls it _Jamico_, Gwakin (1657) wrote it _Jammaca_, and General\r\nFleetwood (1658) wrote it _Jamecah_.\r\n\r\nColumbus on his return from his first journey was told by the natives\r\nwhen off Tortuga, that if he sailed in a certain direction two days he\r\nwould arrive at Babeque, where he would find gold. Columbus mentions\r\nBabeque many times in his journals, but he never found it, at least\r\nunder that name. The “Historie,” of 1571, identifies it with Hispaniola\r\nbut this is doubted. Las Casas thought that it might refer to Jamaica.\r\n\r\nIn common with most other West Indian native names Jamaica has come to\r\nus through a Spanish source; and the native pronunciation was possibly\r\nsomething like Hâmîca. Several derivations have been given of the\r\nmeaning of the word. The most extraordinary is that which seeks to\r\nconnect it with James II. On Moll’s map of the island, published early\r\nin the eighteenth century, it is stated that it was first called St.\r\nJago by Columbus, who discovered it, but that the name was afterwards\r\nchanged to Jamaica, after James, Duke of York. In this connection it is\r\nsomewhat sad to note that not one of the Greater Antilles retained the\r\nname given to it by Columbus. Española, Santiago and Juana, went back to\r\ntheir native Hayti, Jamaica and Cuba; and St. Juan Bautista became Porto\r\nRico, but Hispaniola still survives to some extent and is the most\r\nconvenient name for the island which contains two republics. Of the\r\nsmaller islands, the names of Trinidad, Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat\r\nand Guadeloupe still remind us of their great discoverer.\r\n\r\nJames Knight, in the rough draft of his history of Jamaica (1742) in the\r\nBritish Museum, gives the following derivation of the word Jamaica: “In\r\nthe original it was Jamajaco. Jamo in the Indian language is a country,\r\nand Jaco is water.”\r\n\r\nJohn Atkins, in his “Voyage to the Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies”\r\n(1737), says that “Jamaica was altered by King James, it being a\r\ncompound of his name and ‘_ca_’ an island.” He was possibly not far\r\nwrong in regard to the “island.” The West Indian word for an island,\r\n_cai_ (or the Biscayan word cay) is supposed to appear in Lucayos\r\n(Bahamas), “Men of the Island”; in the Caicos islands, and also in\r\nvarious cays or keys in the West Indies; albeit modern etymology makes\r\ncay or key the same word as the Welsh cae.\r\n\r\nLong wrote in 1774 that “it is not improbable that Jamaica is a name of\r\nIndian extraction, perhaps derived from Jamacaru, the Brazilian name of\r\nthe prickly pear, which overspreads the maritime parts of the south\r\nside, where the aboriginal Indian discoverers of this island might have\r\nfirst landed,” but this derivation has found no supporters among later\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nBryan Edwards, writing in 1793, says: “The early Spanish historians\r\nwrote the word _Xaymaca_. It is said to have signified in the language\r\nof the natives, a country abounding in springs.”\r\n\r\nBridges, who as a rule displays a more fertile imagination than Long\r\nwithout half his trustworthiness as a historian, says, writing in 1828:\r\n“In the speech of Florida, _Chaübaan_ signified water and _makia_ wood\r\n(Lescarbot, I.6, c.6). The compound sound would approach to Chab-makia;\r\nand, harmonized to the Spanish ear, would be Chamakia, or some such\r\nindistinct union of these two significant expressions, denoting a land\r\ncovered with wood, and therefore watered by shaded rivulets, or, in\r\nother words, fertile.” This suggested origin has been usually adopted by\r\nlater writers. Why Bridges sought in Florida the meaning of words of\r\nJamaica, he does not explain. Carib and Arawâk are probably the only two\r\nlanguages which Columbus heard spoken in the Greater Antilles. Wood, in\r\nArawâk, is _ada_; woods are in Arawâk _konoko_ and in Carib _eotch_; and\r\nwater is in Arawâk _winiab_ (Hillhouse) or _comiaboo_ (im Thurn), and in\r\nCarib _tona_.\r\n\r\nBryan Edwards points out that Fernando Columbus’s “Historie” states that\r\nthe Indian name of Antigua was Jamaica, and he adds: “It is a singular\r\ncircumstance that this word which in the language of the larger islands\r\nsignified a country abounding in springs, should in the dialect of the\r\nCharaibs have been applied to an island that has not a single spring or\r\nrivulet of fresh water in it.” Until further research proves the\r\ncontrary Jamaica must remain, what it truly is, the land of woods and\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nApart from the name of the island itself, there are few names of native\r\norigin left. These will be referred to in the body of the work as they\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in discriminating between the native Indian and\r\nSpanish origin of West Indian names: and too great a faith in the laws\r\nof philology are apt to lead one astray. Placenames are not infrequently\r\nrather evolved in accordance with the rule of phonetics.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Long wrote: “From the resemblance which the language of\r\nthese islanders bears in some respects to the Spanish, I am apt to\r\nsuspect that many of their words have been altered by the Spanish mode\r\nof pronunciation, and the difficulty which the discoverers found in\r\narticulating and accenting them without some intermixture of their own\r\npatronymic. In some this is exceedingly obvious, where the letter _b_ is\r\nused indiscriminately for _v_, agreeably to their idiom. This perversion\r\nmay easily lead us to ascribe a Spanish or Moorish origin to the names\r\nof places, such as rivers, mountains, headlands, &c., which in fact are\r\nof Indian derivation. Thus the article _gua_, so commonly met with both\r\nin these islands and on the Southern continent, was often prefixed or\r\nappended to the Indian names of places and things; and even of their\r\nprovincial _caciques_. Of the latter were Gua-rionexius, Gua-canarillus,\r\nGua-naboa, and others. Of the former a vast multitude occurs, as\r\nGua-nama, Xa-gua, Gua-há-gua, Camayá-gua, Aicayazá-gua, Má-gua,\r\nNicará-gua, Verá-gua, Xará-guo, Gua-ríco, Ni-gua (Chigger), etc., which\r\nmay seem to confound them with derivatives from the Spanish or Moorish\r\nword _agua_ (water). So the terminations, _ao_, _ana_, _coa_, and _boa_\r\nor _voa_, as Manabax-ao, Cib-ao, Gu-ana, Magu-ana, Yagu-ana, Ligu-ana,\r\nZav-ana (Savannah), Furac-ana (Hurricane), Caym-ana, Guaiac-ana\r\n(Guiacum), Haba-coa, Cuana-boa, and so forth. The names therefore\r\noccurring in our island of Liguana, Cagua, Tilboa, Guanaboa, Guadibocoa,\r\nand others of similar finals are with more propriety to be traced from\r\nthe Indian than the Spanish dialect.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Spanish occupation of the island both history and\r\narchæology are almost as scantily supplied as in the case of the\r\nArawâks.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that when Jamaica fell into the hands of the English the\r\npopulation of the capital was half Spanish and Portuguese or their\r\ndescendants and half slaves; but it is a curious fact that a negro is\r\nmentioned as holding the position of priest of the Roman Catholic\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe more important islands of Cuba and Hispaniola, to say nothing of the\r\nrich mines of South America, offered greater attractions to the\r\nSpaniards than did Jamaica, where—then, as now—the field had to be\r\nploughed before the harvest could be reaped. They utilized for their\r\n_hatos_, or pastures, the low-lying lands on the sea-coast, which had\r\nformerly been used by the native Arawâks for the cultivation of Indian\r\ncorn and cassava.\r\n\r\nOf these hatos the principal were, going from east to west, Morante (the\r\nname of which still lives in Morant Bay), Ayala (Yallahs), Lezama (where\r\nMona now is), Liguanea (Lower St. Andrew), Guanaboa (the name of which\r\nstill exists), Guatabaco (about Old Harbour), Yama (in Vere), Pereda\r\n(Pedro Plains), El Eado (behind Bluefields) and Cabonico (near\r\nSavanna-la-Mar).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMAICA, CIRCA 1661]\r\n\r\nThey had settlements at St. Jago de la Vega (the present Spanish town,\r\nestablished in 1520), Puerto de Esquivella (Old Harbour, named after the\r\nfirst governor about 1501), Parattee (still bearing the same name),\r\nOristan (Bluefield, named after a town in Sardinia then subject to the\r\ncrown of Spain), Savanna-la-Mar, Melilla (in the north-west corner of\r\nSt. James, named after a town on the coast of Barbary, then in the\r\npossession of Spain), Sevilla Nueva (St. Ann’s Bay), Chireras (Ocho\r\nRios), Rio Nuevo and Hibanal (somewhere near Buff Bay).\r\n\r\nRoads ran from Puerto Antonio westerly along the coast to Punta\r\nNegrilla, connecting their townships of Santa Anna, Melilla and Manteca.\r\nFrom Manteca a road ran southerly to where Savanna-la-Mar now is, and\r\nthence easterly to Old Harbour, and thence northerly to Santa Anna.\r\n\r\nThere are but scanty remains of Spanish masonry in the island; none of\r\ngreat importance. The “Columbian Magazine” in 1796 recorded that an old\r\nSpanish tavern, with laths of bamboo, was taken down to make way for\r\nRodney’s statue, and the adjacent buildings, but there is, of course, no\r\ncertain proof that this was Spanish work. The only known relic of\r\nSpanish Jamaica is the church bell from Port Royal now in the Institute\r\nof Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf their buildings in general, Sir Hans Sloane, who was here in 1687–88,\r\nonly thirty-three years after the conquest, says that they were “usually\r\none storey high, having a porch, parlour, and at each end a room, with\r\nsmall ones behind. They built with posts put deep in the ground; on the\r\nsides their houses were plastered up with clay or reeds, or made of the\r\nsplit trunks of cabbage trees nailed close to one another and covered\r\nwith tiles or palmetto thatch. The lowness, as well as fixing the posts\r\ndeep in the earth, was for fear their houses should be ruined by\r\nearthquakes, as well as for coolness.” It seems strange, according to\r\nmodern ideas, to build a house one storey only for coolness; although\r\none might do so for fear of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nLong tells us that “a certain number of posts of the hardest timber,\r\ngenerally _lignum vitæ_, brazilletto, or fustick, of about 18 feet in\r\nlength and 6 to 8 inches in diameter, being first well-seasoned and\r\nhardened in smoke, were fixed at proper distances to the depth of 2 or 3\r\nfeet in the ground; then a wall of brick, enclosing these posts, was\r\ncarried up with very strong mortar to the plate, which was pinned with\r\nwooden spikes to the tops of the posts. The main rafters were small, but\r\nbeing of the like hard wood, and perfectly well-seasoned, were\r\nsufficiently strong; these were likewise pinned upon each other, and at\r\ntheir angle of intersection at top formed a crutch to receive the ridge\r\npole. The smaller rafters were of the lesser ebony trees, stripped of\r\ntheir bark, hardened in smoke, notched at bottom, and being placed at\r\nthe distance of about 18 inches from each other, were pinned to the\r\nplate. Athwart these on all rafters a stratum of the wild cane (_Arundo\r\nIndica_, bamboo species), previously smoked, was tied on by way of\r\nwattling with straps made of the bark of mahoe or mangrove trees. Upon\r\nthese wattles some mortar was laid, to the thickness of about 4 inches;\r\nand the whole covered with large pantiles, well bedded in. The thickness\r\nof these roofs, from the outward shell or tile-covering to the ceiling\r\nwithin, was about 8 or 10 inches. A canopy of so solid a texture was\r\ncertainly well contrived to shelter the inhabitants from the\r\ndisagreeable effects of a vertical sun,” and accordingly it is found by\r\nexperience that these old Spanish houses are much cooler than our modern\r\nones covered with shingles. After regretting the failure to establish a\r\nmanufacture of tiles, and the importation of North American shingles,\r\nLong goes on to say: “The chief error the Spaniards committed in their\r\nbuildings was the placing their ground floors too low; these were nearly\r\non a level with the surface of the earth out of doors, or at most raised\r\nonly a few inches higher.” In his time there were, he tells us, upwards\r\nof fifty Spanish houses remaining in Spanish Town “very little the worse\r\nfor time or weather.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Spanish names given to towns and villages, St. Jago de la Vega (St.\r\nJames of the plain) still survives in custom, although supplanted\r\nofficially by Spanish Town. So also do Ocho Rios, Savanna-la-Mar (the\r\nplain by the sea) and Oracabessa; Esquivel became Old Harbour soon after\r\nthe British occupation.\r\n\r\nOf the Spanish names of rivers, many survive; the principal being Rio\r\nAlto (deep river), Rio Cobre (copper river), Rio Grande, Rio Minho, Rio\r\nBueno (the good river), Rio Magno (the great river), Rio Novo (new\r\nriver), Rio d’oro (golden river), Rio Pedro (Peter’s river). It is\r\nthought that Rio Pedro may be a corruption of Rio Piedra (stony river).\r\nThe Rio Minho is said to have been named after a river in Portugal or,\r\nas Long says in another place, after some mine in the neighbourhood. It\r\nis thought by some that it should be Rio Mina, (the river by the mine).\r\nOthers are named after rivers in Spain.\r\n\r\nAmongst districts we have Santa Cruz (Holy Cross); as well as Pedro both\r\nin St. Ann and in St. Elizabeth. The former is said to have been named\r\nafter Pedro Esquivel, the Spanish governor.\r\n\r\nThe following derivations of Spanish names in Jamaica are given by Long.\r\nNotes by the present writer are added between square brackets:\r\n\r\n  _Auracabeza._ Aura, air or breeze; Cabeza, head or high land. [This is\r\n    now Ora Cabessa in St. Mary. Others derive it from Oro Cabeza, the\r\n    golden head.]\r\n\r\n  _Alta Mela._ Deep Gap. (Alta Mela, Savannah, St. James.)\r\n\r\n  _Agua Alta Bahia._ Deep water Bay, corruptly Wag-Water. [Still known\r\n    as Wag Water.]\r\n\r\n  _Los Angelos._ The Angels. [Angels in St. Catherine was the first\r\n    terminus of the railway.]\r\n\r\n  _Rio Bonito._ The Pretty River.\r\n\r\n  _Cabo Bonito._ The Pretty Cape. [In St. Catherine.]\r\n\r\n  _Cabarita Punta._ Kid or Goat Point. [In Westmoreland, where there is\r\n    a river of the same name; there is another Cabaritta Point in Old\r\n    Harbour Bay, and a Cabaritta Island in Port Maria Harbour.]\r\n\r\n  _Rio de Camarones._ Perhaps from Gambaro, a crab, from the abundance\r\n    of black crabs hereabouts.\r\n\r\n  _Cobre Rio._ Copper River, or Cobra Port, Snake River. [Still known as\r\n    Rio Cobre.]\r\n\r\n  _Caborido._ _Quasi_ Caba Arido, the dry or withered cape (part of\r\n    Healthshire highlands.)\r\n\r\n  _Carvil or Caravel Bahia._ Caravela signifies a light round kind of a\r\n    ship formerly used by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n  _Diablo Monte._ Devil’s Mount. [Now called Mount Diavolo.]\r\n\r\n  _Escondido Puerto._ The hidden harbour. [In Portland; now called\r\n    Turtle Crawle Harbour.]\r\n\r\n  _Flora Ria._ Flower River.\r\n\r\n  _Fortaleza Punta._ Fort Point. [On Blome’s map there are two in St.\r\n    Ann.]\r\n\r\n  _Gallina Punta._ Hen Point. [Galina Point is in St. Mary.]\r\n\r\n  _Guada Bocca._ Guada, brook of water; boca, mouth.\r\n\r\n  _Hoja Rio._ River of leaves, now corruptly Riho Hoa. [Now called Rio\r\n    Hoe.]\r\n\r\n  _Jarisse Punta._ Cross-bow or arrow, probably refers to some action\r\n    with the Indians.\r\n\r\n  _Javareen._ Rustic expression, signifying a wild boar.\r\n\r\n  _Lacovia._ _Quasi_ Lago-via, or the way by the lake. [A village in St.\r\n    Elizabeth. Elsewhere Long suggests it may be a corruption of La agua\r\n    via, the watery way. It was once in the possession of the Gladstone\r\n    family.]\r\n\r\n  _Liguanea._ Lia-withe-guana, the name of an animal, probably one\r\n    frequent in that part of the island. [That part of Lower St. Andrew,\r\n    bordered by the Long Mountain, the St. Andrew Mountains and the Red\r\n    Hills.]\r\n\r\n  _Moneque or Monesca Savannah._ Savannah of monkeys. [Now confined to\r\n    the village of Moneague.]\r\n\r\n  _Mari bona._ Maria-buena, Mary the Good. [Maria Buena Bay is in\r\n    Trelawny.]\r\n\r\n  _Multi-bezon Rio._ Multi, many; buzon, conduit.\r\n\r\n  _Macari Bahia._ Macari, a tile, such as is made for floors, which the\r\n    Spaniards universally used here and probably manufactured them near\r\n    this bay, the soil being proper for that purpose.\r\n    [Long adds as a footnote to Macari: “Or perhaps it may derive more\r\n    properly from the Indian word Macarij (which signifies bitter), and\r\n    allude to the tree commonly called the Majoe, or Macary-bitter which\r\n    grows in great abundance along this part of the coast, and with\r\n    whose leaves, bark and root, which are all of them extremely bitter,\r\n    some very notable cures in cases of inveterate ulcers, the yaws, and\r\n    venereal distempers, were some years ago performed by an old negress\r\n    named Majoe, in commemoration of whom it took its name.” Macary Bay\r\n    is in Vere. Majoe Bitter, or Macary Bitter (_Picramnia Antidesnia\r\n    Sus._) is a shrub about 8 feet high, with small whitish green\r\n    flowers, and berries first scarlet, then black.]\r\n\r\n  _Mantica Bahia._ Butter (now Montego Bay). This part abounding\r\n    formerly with wild hogs, the Spaniards probably made here what they\r\n    called hog’s butter (lard) for exportation. [In a very old deed of\r\n    conveyance of land in St. James a road is marked as leading to Lard\r\n    Bay.]\r\n\r\n  _Ocho Rios_ said to mean eight rivers. [In St. Ann. It was more\r\n    commonly called Chareiras in Long’s time; and indeed as late as\r\n    1841, William Rob wrote “Ocho Rios, called to this day by the old\r\n    inhabitants ‘Cheireras,’ its early and appropriate name ‘the Bay of\r\n    the Water-Falls,’ but has now gone back to Ocho Rios.” It is not\r\n    unlikely that the present form Ocho Rios and the derivation from\r\n    eight rivers is wrong, and that the real name is Chorréra, a spout.\r\n    There is a Chorréra River in Cuba, near Havannah.]\r\n\r\n  _Perexil Insula._ Samphire Island.\r\n\r\n  _Sombrio Rio._ Shady river. [Now called the Sambre.]\r\n\r\n  _Yalos._ Frosts (whence, perhaps corruptly, Yallahs), the high white\r\n    cliffs having the appearance of a frosty covering. [Now called\r\n    Yallahs. Long was probably wrong in connecting Yallahs with Yalos.\r\n    The Hatô de Ayala extended from Bull Bay nearly to Morant Bay, and\r\n    the name is probably a personal one. Pedro Lopez de Ayala was a\r\n    celebrated poet and politician in the fourteenth century; Pedro de\r\n    Ayala was Spanish envoy to the Court of St. James in 1498; and,\r\n    curiously, a recent Spanish representative at Havana bore the name\r\n    de Ayala. There was a Captain Yhallahs, a privateer who flourished\r\n    in Jamaica in and about 1671, and the locality may have been named\r\n    after him.]\r\n\r\n  _Luidas._ Perhaps from Luzida; gay, fine. [Lluidas Vale is in St.\r\n    Catherine.]\r\n\r\n  _Martha Brea._ Martha, a woman’s name; Brea, tar; perhaps a nickname\r\n    of some Spanish sailor’s Dulcinea like the English vulgar\r\n    appellation _Jack Tar_. [Martha Brea village and river are in\r\n    Trelawny. The name is a corruption of Rio Matibereon.]\r\n\r\nNo traces are to be found to-day of the following: Alta Mela, Rio de\r\nCamarones, Caborida, Carvil Bahia, Guada Bocca, Jarisse Punta, Javareen,\r\nMulti Bezon Rio, Perexil Insula.\r\n\r\nOf corruptions of Spanish names the best known are: Agualta (Agua Alta,\r\nthe deep river); Bog Walk (Boca d’Agua, water’s mouth); and Mount\r\nDiablo. Cagua became with the English Caguay, then Cagway when it was\r\nrenamed Port Royal.\r\n\r\nThose who see in Porus a survival of the name of Columbus’s companion,\r\nPorras, are probably drawing on a fertile imagination. Columbus and his\r\ncompanions saw little of the interior of the island. It is more probably\r\ncalled after some well sunk there, or from the porous nature of the\r\nsoil, “pitted with holes.” In the English edition of Ferdinand\r\nColumbus’s “Historie,” we read that the Morant Cays were called by\r\nColumbus _Los Poros_ because “not finding water in them they dug pits in\r\nthe sand”; but in the Italian edition (Venice, 1571) they are called “le\r\npozzi” (the pits), and in the Spanish edition of 1749 they are called\r\n“Las Poças” (the pits). It is possible that in the case of Porus, as in\r\nthat of the Morant Cays, there has been a confusion between _Poros_ and\r\n_Pocas_; and that the town in Manchester should be called Poças. The\r\nSpaniards called the Black River, el Caovana (the Mahogany River).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the English section of Jamaica history for the two centuries from\r\n1655 to 1855, there is a wide field of exploration.\r\n\r\nWhat with earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, the march of time, and\r\nrebuilding, the typical old-time planter’s houses are getting scarcer.\r\nThen, again, there are the monuments and gravestones which contribute to\r\nour knowledge of Jamaica genealogy and history. Captain Lawrence-Archer,\r\nin the middle of the last century, did much in his “Monumental\r\nInscriptions of the British West Indies,” to put this information in a\r\nhandy form, but his work, which is often inaccurate, by no means covers\r\nthe whole field. Something of late years has been done in that direction\r\nby Mr. Oliver in “Caribbeana.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Jamaica is probably no worse than other countries in its\r\ndisregard for ancient monuments, that there is need for improvement\r\ncannot be denied by those who have looked into the matter. The Spanish\r\ninvaders burned the Arawâk huts; the old-time English planters despoiled\r\nSpanish buildings to find material for their sugar works; and in our own\r\nday a ruined seventeenth-century building which withstood the recent\r\nearthquake was later pulled down by peasants for the sake of its stones.\r\nWhen Lawrence-Archer wrote less than fifty years ago, he recorded a\r\nstatue by Bacon to Richard Batty in the cathedral. Only a fragment of it\r\nremains to-day. The author of his epitaph little thought that the\r\nliteral truth of part of it would be so early established when he wrote\r\nin 1796:\r\n\r\n              “Yet vain the Record, which sculptured stone\r\n              Would raise to those pre-eminently known.”\r\n\r\nThe most strongly constructed building will wear out with time and, in\r\nthe tropics especially, vegetation is apt to interfere with monuments\r\nand gravestones; but a little care without much expense should be all\r\nthat is needed to render unnecessary an expensive restoration, which\r\nmany individuals and bodies find themselves unprepared to meet and\r\nwhich, after all, can never take the place of preservation.\r\n\r\nIn 1672 Port Royal contained 800 well-built houses, “as dear rented,”\r\nBlome tells us, “as if they stood in well-traded streets in London.”\r\nTwenty years later, when it was at its zenith, the number was 2000, “the\r\ngreatest number of which were of brick, several storeys in height.” In\r\n1692, as is well known, a large part of the town perished by an\r\nearthquake, and from that event Kingston dates its origin, Port Royal\r\nbeing partially destroyed again, by fire, in 1703 and by hurricane in\r\n1722.\r\n\r\nCharles Leslie, writing in 1739, says of Jamaica: “One is not to look\r\nfor the beauties of architecture here; the public buildings are neat but\r\nnot fine. The churches in the town are generally in form of a cross,\r\nwith a small cupola a-top, built high in the walls, paved within, and\r\nadorned with no manner of finery.” The churches, he says, except those\r\nat Spanish Town and Halfway-Tree, are “decent small houses, scarce to be\r\nknown for such,” and he adds, “the clergy trouble them little, and their\r\ndoors are seldom open,” in marked contrast to the present state of\r\naffairs. “The gentlemen’s houses,” he says, “are generally built low, of\r\none storey, consisting of five or six handsome apartments, beautifully\r\nlined and floored with mahogany.... In the towns there are several\r\nhouses which are two storeys, but that way of building is disapproved of\r\nbecause they seldom are known to stand the shock of an earthquake or the\r\nfury of a storm.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Craskell and Simpson’s large map of Surrey, of the year 1763, is\r\nshown a view of a presumably typical Jamaica house, two storeys high,\r\nwith an open veranda in front only. It is evident from what Long says\r\nthat, at all events for the first century of the island’s occupation by\r\nthe British, not much attention was paid to domestic architecture by the\r\nplanters of the island. “It is,” he says, “but of late that the planters\r\nhave paid much attention to elegance in their habitations; their general\r\nrule was to build what they called a makeshift; so that it was not\r\nunusual to see a plantation adorned with a very expensive set of works,\r\nof brick or stone, well executed, and the owner residing in a miserable\r\nthatched hovel, hastily put together with wattles and plaster, damp,\r\nunwholesome, and infested with every species of vermin. But the houses\r\nin general, as well in the country parts as in the towns, have been\r\ngreatly improved within these last twenty years.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this connection mention may be made of the aqueducts on some of the\r\nsugar estates, which are amongst the best pieces of architectural work\r\nin the island. They and some of the old stone bridges compare more than\r\nfavourably with the modern bridges, many of which—excellent monuments of\r\nengineering skill as they may be—their best friends would never venture\r\nto call works of art. Moreover the stone bridges will probably be\r\nstanding when the iron ones have perished by decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Marsden, writing a little later (1788), says: “Except a few\r\nexcellent houses which have lately been built of brick and two or three\r\nof stone, after the English fashion, by rich merchants, the houses are\r\nin general of wood, very often mahogany, which is plentiful in this\r\nisland. They consist but of a room or two below stairs, with piazzas all\r\nround and a storey above.” Stewart, whose account of the island was\r\npublished in 1808, gives much the same account of the domestic houses,\r\nbut goes on to say: “As for bridges and other public structures of the\r\nkind, in this part of the world there are few that deserve mention,\r\nexcept a neat cast-iron bridge imported from Great Britain and some\r\nyears ago thrown across the Rio Cobra. There is, indeed, often a marked\r\ndeficiency here of public spirit in undertakings of this sort.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the houses on the sea-coast were, in the eighteenth century,\r\nmade defensible with loopholes and fortified by guns, so as to guard\r\nagainst the attacks in war time of the enemy’s privateers. In other\r\ncases a like precaution was taken against the risings of slaves; houses\r\nin some instances being supplied with towers at the corners, each of\r\nwhich commanded two sides of the building.\r\n\r\nOf direct records of slavery days there are not many prominent relics.\r\n\r\nHere and there a punishment cell is found, with indications of the\r\nfixing of shackles; but of stocks and such-like implements no traces\r\nremain. A few examples of branding-irons exist. In this connection it\r\nmay be of interest to quote Bryan Edwards’s account of the method\r\nadopted in branding slaves:\r\n\r\n“A gentleman of my acquaintance, who had purchased at the same time ten\r\nKoromantyn boys and the like number of Eboes (the eldest of the whole\r\napparently not more than thirteen years of age) caused them all to be\r\ncollected and brought before him in my presence, to be marked on the\r\nbreast. This operation is performed by heating a small silver brand\r\ncomposed of one or two letters, in the flame of spirits of wine, and\r\napplying it to the skin, which is previously anointed with sweet oil.\r\nThe application is instantaneous and the pain momentary. Nevertheless,\r\nit may be easily supposed that the apparatus must have a frightful\r\nappearance to a child. Accordingly when the first boy, who happened to\r\nbe one of the Eboes, and the stoutest of the whole, was led forward to\r\nreceive the mark, he screamed dreadfully, while his companions of the\r\nsame nation manifested strong emotions of sympathetic terror. The\r\ngentleman stopt his hand, but the Koromantyn boys, laughing aloud, and,\r\nimmediately coming forward of their own accord, offered their bosoms\r\nundauntedly to the brand, and receiving its impression without flinching\r\nin the least, snapt their fingers in exultation over the poor Eboes.”\r\n\r\nA branding-iron such as that mentioned above, in the Institute of\r\nJamaica, is shown in the accompanying illustration. It is 6⅞ inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BRANDING-IRON\r\n]\r\n\r\nDoyley’s Council had been elected by the people, and so, in a sense, was\r\na forerunner of the Assembly. But the first regular Assembly was\r\nsummoned by Lyttelton and met at Spanish Town on January 20, 1664, and\r\nfrom that day until the Assembly of the time resigned its powers to the\r\nCrown on December 21, 1865, the political destiny of the colony is to be\r\nread in the pages of its Journal and its Votes.\r\n\r\nThe first Assembly chose as its speaker Robert Freeman, who represented\r\nMorant, one of the then twelve districts that returned members.\r\n\r\nThe troubles which Doyley, the first governor, had had in inducing\r\nadventure-loving soldiers to become planters had given place to a more\r\nsettled state of affairs, and when the House rose on February 12, 1664,\r\nit “parted with all kindness and feastings, having passed as good a body\r\nof laws as could be expected from such young statesmen.” But this\r\npeaceful condition was not destined to last. Familiarity with\r\nlegislative functions bred contempt for the opinions of others, and\r\nunreasonable demands on the part of these young statesmen were met by\r\nhigh-handed actions on the part of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn his opening speech to the Assembly Carlisle said that the King looked\r\non Jamaica as “his darling plantation, and has taken more pains to make\r\nthis island happy than any other of his colonies.” These kind words\r\nwere, however, nullified by the fact that the new governor had brought\r\nwith him forty acts which Charles had had drawn up (and to which he had\r\naffixed the great seal of England) in lieu of the acts which the\r\nAssembly had passed under Vaughan, and that he was instructed to get the\r\nHouse to pass them. This plan had been suggested in a letter written in\r\nEngland by a Mr. Nevil (who was evidently acquainted with Jamaica) to\r\nCarlisle just before he started to take up his appointment, and had been\r\nadopted because—to quote the words of the Lords of Trade and Plantations\r\nto the King in Council—“of the irregular, violent and unwarrantable\r\nproceedings of the Assembly.”\r\n\r\nThe virtual point of difference was this, that under the original\r\nconstitution the island (through the Governor, Council and Assembly)\r\nmade its own laws in accordance with what it conceived to be its needs\r\nand sent them home for approval, they remaining in force for two years\r\ntill the royal pleasure was known, while under the new arrangement\r\n(based on Poynings’s Law, or the Statutes of Drogheda, in use in\r\nIreland), the laws were to be made in England (on the advice of the\r\nGovernor and Council), and remitted for the approval of the Assembly.\r\nThe style of enactment was altered from the “Governor, Council and\r\nAssembly, etc.” to the “King, by and with the advice, etc. of the\r\nAssembly.”\r\n\r\nThis proposed change, which had been decided on by the Lords of Trade\r\nand Plantations, in opposition to the advice of Lynch, who knew Jamaica\r\nwell—the Assembly resisted with might and main, but though they were in\r\na very great measure successful, it was not until 1728 that the complete\r\nlegislative power for which Jamaica contended was granted.\r\n\r\nLynch, when he returned as governor, was able to tell the people of\r\nJamaica, “His Majesty, upon the Assembly’s humble address, was pleased\r\nto restore us to our beloved form of making laws, wherein we enjoy\r\nbeyond dispute all the deliberative powers in our Assembly that the\r\nHouse of Commons enjoy in their House.”\r\n\r\nIn return for the constitution now conceded the Assembly pledged itself\r\nto grant to the King a fixed revenue, which if not perpetual should at\r\nleast last for seven years. The quarrel, however, with regard to the\r\nrevenue bills lasted up till 1728; the Crown desiring a perpetual\r\nrevenue, the Assembly persistently declining to do more than grant bills\r\nfor a few years’ duration. The Crown on the other hand declined to\r\napprove many of their laws. In 1728 the Assembly gave way and settled a\r\npermanent revenue in return for the royal confirmation of various acts\r\nof importance to the island and a concession as to their past laws which\r\nthey regarded as “the grand charter of their liberties.”\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the early struggles, we find that under the\r\nDuke of Albemarle, a very unwise governor, matters were far from\r\nsatisfactory. He dissolved the House suddenly because one of the\r\nmembers, John Towers, in a debate repeated the old adage _salus populi\r\nsuprema lex_, in protesting against the Speaker’s refusal to grant him\r\npermission to attend a race meeting. Albemarle had the offender taken in\r\ncustody and fined £600. In his dispatch on the subject he wrote: “The\r\nAssembly have done very little, the major part having made it their\r\nbusiness to wrangle and oppose all things that are for the King’s\r\nservice and the good of the country.” The freedom of election was\r\ngrossly violated by the duke, who admitted hosts of servants and\r\ndischarged seamen to the poll at the election, and actually imprisoned\r\nmany legal voters of wealth and consideration. He imposed fines on the\r\nlatter to a large amount, and threatened to whip two gentlemen for\r\nrequesting a habeas corpus for their friends. In spite of this he had\r\nthe effrontery to write home to the Board of Trade and Plantations:\r\n“While the elections were going forward there were unwarrantable\r\noppositions made in most parishes as well as malicious practices to\r\nprevent fair election!”\r\n\r\nHis successor, Inchiquin, met with considerable opposition from a\r\nsection of the Assembly whose temper had been ruffled by Albemarle’s\r\narbitrary government, and whom he treated in a somewhat tactless manner.\r\nThat they would not do what he wanted he considered “an indignity and\r\naffront to himself and the board.” He finally rejected their address of\r\ncongratulation, and “then it was thrown to them with some contempt.”\r\n\r\nThe franchise established by the law of 1681 for appointing the members\r\nof the Assembly was still in force in 1812: “Freeholders in the same\r\nparish where the election is to be made.” At a by-election in 1804, in\r\nSt. Andrew, seventy-nine freeholders voted, forty-six for the successful\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nThe House met usually from October to Christmas, the time of the year\r\nwhen the planters could be absent from their estates with least\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe closing scene in the life of the Assembly was acted on December 21,\r\n1865, around amendments to the “Act to alter and amend the Political\r\nConstitution of the Island,” and especially to that to the second\r\nclause, which ran:\r\n\r\n  “It shall be lawful for Her Majesty’s Imperial Government to assume\r\n  the entire management and control of the affairs of this island, and\r\n  by orders in Council or otherwise, as Her Majesty may be advised, to\r\n  conduct the affairs of this island as Her Majesty may think fit: and\r\n  such orders shall have the effect and force of law.”\r\n\r\nThe Council’s amendment was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “It shall be lawful for Her Majesty the Queen to create and constitute\r\n  a Government in this island, in such form and with such power as to\r\n  Her Majesty shall seem fit, and from time to time to alter and amend\r\n  such Government.”\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Council had adjourned while their amendments to the\r\nConstitution Bill were being discussed by the Assembly, and some of them\r\nwere in the House during the discussion. So soon as they saw that the\r\namendments had passed, they retired and formed a board, which passed the\r\nbill in almost ten minutes after it left the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn proroguing the assembly on the following day Governor Eyre said:\r\n\r\n  “In releasing you from further attendance upon your legislative\r\n  duties, I cannot lose sight of the probability that you may never be\r\n  called upon to exercise these duties again, under the existing form of\r\n  constitution, and that this general sacrifice has been consummated by\r\n  yourselves from an earnest and sincere desire, regardless of all\r\n  personal considerations, to benefit the colony.\r\n\r\n  “On behalf of the colony and of the many interests associated with it,\r\n  I return you the thanks which are so justly your due. History will\r\n  record the heroic act, and I trust that history will show from the\r\n  ameliorated state of the country, and a renewed prosperity, that your\r\n  noble self devotion has not been in vain.”\r\n\r\nIn concluding, he said, with reference to the Morant Bay outbreak:\r\n\r\n  “The session which is now about to terminate has been the most\r\n  important that has ever taken place since Jamaica became a dependency\r\n  of the British Crown.\r\n\r\n  “It is impossible to help regretting the necessity which has enforced\r\n  the abandonment of institutions so deservedly dear to every British\r\n  heart, and which, even in this colony, have remained unchanged for a\r\n  period of 200 years; but it is wiser and better, circumstanced as we\r\n  are, to give up institutions which are valued rather for the\r\n  associations which are connected with them, than for any advantages\r\n  which have resulted to the colony from their existence in Jamaica, and\r\n  to substitute in their place a perhaps less showy and less\r\n  time-honoured form of Government, but which is certainly more\r\n  practicable and better suited to the altered circumstances of our\r\n  position.\r\n\r\n  “Well, I think, it is that we have taken warning by the terrible\r\n  circumstances which have forced upon us the conviction that a\r\n  Government, to be effective, in times of difficulty and danger, must\r\n  be a strong and united one; and well will it be if by a voluntary\r\n  reconstruction, the community may receive some compensation in future\r\n  good government, for the dreadful calamity with which it has just been\r\n  afflicted.”\r\n\r\nThe House took a deep interest from time to time in the barracks for\r\nwhich they voted funds. In 1702 orders were received from home to build\r\nbarracks to receive 3000 men. Handasyd, the Lieutenant-governor, said\r\nthat it would cost more than £40,000 “where such buildings are\r\nunreasonably dear” to build such as were built in Ireland, but that\r\nsuitable barracks could be built of wood for £3000.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the state of the forts and barracks in the\r\nisland in May 1745, taken from the “Journals of the House of Assembly,”\r\nmay be fittingly quoted here.\r\n\r\n  “Then the House resolved itself into a Committee of the whole House,\r\n  upon the report made on Friday last, of the number and condition of\r\n  the barracks already built, and of such others as were necessary to be\r\n  provided; and the plans laid before the House, and the said report,\r\n  being read, is in the words following:\r\n\r\n  MR. SPEAKER,—Your Committee, appointed to make enquiry into the number\r\n  and condition of the barracks already built, and what more shall be\r\n  necessary to be provided, have accordingly done the same; and, by the\r\n  best information they have been able to get, find to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Port-Morant._ A complete barrack, newly built by the Parish of\r\n  St.-Thomas-in-the-East, framed, boarded, and shingled, in good order,\r\n  which will contain about sixty men.\r\n\r\n  _Manchioneal._ A barrack, formerly built by the said parish of\r\n  St.-Thomas-in-the-East, which will contain thirty men; the body built\r\n  with stone, a framed roof, wants new shingling, and already ordered to\r\n  be forthwith done, and to be put in good repair.\r\n\r\n  _Morant-Bay._ A new barrack now building at the expense of the\r\n  aforesaid parish of St.-Thomas-in-the-East for twenty-five men.\r\n\r\n  _Yallahs Bay._ A large house with proper conveniencies belonging to\r\n  Mr. Donaldson, already hired for a barrack, to receive twenty-five\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  _Cow-Bay._ A barrack for twenty men going to be built, by Mr. Vallete,\r\n  in the room of the former barrack destroyed by the hurricane.\r\n\r\n  _Westmoreland._ A barrack already built, capable of receiving a whole\r\n  company, situate at Savanna-la-Mar, as informed by Mr. Hall.\r\n\r\n  _St. Ann’s._ A barrack now building at St. Ann’s Bay, and is\r\n  calculated to be a crutched house, wattled and plastered, and capable\r\n  to receive fifty men, as informed by Mr. Whitehorne.\r\n\r\n  _Moneague._ A barrack which now lodges twenty men, and capable of\r\n  holding thirty; is at present water-tight, but will soon want new\r\n  shingling, as informed by lieutenant Troah.\r\n\r\n  _Vere._ The barrack was blown down in the late hurricane but the\r\n  parish has agreed with Mr. Pusey for his storehouse in Carlisle Bay,\r\n  which is boarded, shingled and in good order and capable to receive\r\n  one hundred men.\r\n\r\n  _St. Elizabeth._ A barrack situate at Black-River; it being a crutched\r\n  house, wattled and plastered, injured by the storm, but is now ordered\r\n  by the parish to be repaired.\r\n\r\n  _St. James._ A barrack at St. James, of a hundred feet long and twenty\r\n  feet wide, with a stone wall, a framed roof, well shingled, in good\r\n  order, which will completely contain fifty men as informed by Mr.\r\n  Hall.\r\n\r\n  _Hanover._ A barrack situate at Lusea-Fort, which will be capable of\r\n  receiving fifty men; a crutched house, wattled, plastered and\r\n  thatched, in good order; and a convenient house for the reception of\r\n  four officers, well shingled and floored.\r\n\r\n  _Port Antonio._ A barrack in good order, which now lodges one company,\r\n  and will soon be in a condition to receive another, by the information\r\n  of lieutenant Bailey.\r\n\r\n  _St. Mary’s._ No barrack built in said parish, but as the Committee\r\n  are informed his excellency intends to send some soldiers for their\r\n  protection, a barrack is necessary to be forthwith built.\r\n\r\n  _Old Harbour._ No barrack built, but the parish of St. Dorothy have\r\n  hired a house for a detachment of thirty soldiers, as informed by Mr.\r\n  Edmund Pusey.\r\n\r\n  _Spanish Town._ The barrack-house is in good order, the officers’\r\n  cook-room wants repairing, the cook-room for the private men is\r\n  entirely down, and the palisado enclosure, on the back part of the\r\n  out-houses, carried away by the late storm; said barrack contains\r\n  sixty men.\r\n\r\n  The Committee are informed that his excellency intends four companies\r\n  of soldiers to be in this town, if proper lodgements were provided for\r\n  them; and, as the barrack contains so few, it will be necessary either\r\n  to enlarge the present barrack or to buy such house or houses as may\r\n  be convenient and sufficient to lodge the aforesaid four companies, as\r\n  are intended for this town; but as we are informed that the house\r\n  belonging to the estate of the late Colonel Heywood is as proper and\r\n  convenient for the purpose aforesaid as any building in this town, and\r\n  to be sold, we think proper to lay before the house a plan relating\r\n  thereto, as also a plan of a barrack to be built adjoining to the\r\n  present barrack, or such other place as shall be judged most\r\n  convenient; all which is submitted to the consideration of the house.\r\n\r\n  _Kingston._ No barracks built, and his excellency is willing to let\r\n  this town have one or more companies of His Majesty’s troops was there\r\n  proper lodgement to receive them.\r\n\r\n  _Port Royal._ The barracks in that town being too small for receiving\r\n  the number of men intended to be quartered there, your Committee are\r\n  informed that said barracks are to be enlarged for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  And, after some time spent in the Committee, Mr. Speaker resumed the\r\n  chair, and Mr. Chief Justice, from a Committee, reported that they had\r\n  gone through the matter to them referred, and come to several\r\n  resolutions, which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered them\r\n  in at the table; where they being again read were agreed unto by the\r\n  House, and are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. _Resolved._ It is the opinion of this Committee, that it be\r\n  recommended to the House, to appoint a Committee to bring in a bill\r\n  for obliging the several parishes to repair and keep up the respective\r\n  barracks already built.\r\n\r\n  _Ordered._ That Mr. Fuller, Mr. Fearon and Mr. March be a committee\r\n  for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  2. _Resolved._ It is the opinion of this Committee, that it be\r\n  recommended to the House, to appoint a committee to treat with the\r\n  attornies of Abraham Elton and Mary Heywood for the purchase of a\r\n  house and footland, late of James Heywood, deceased, for a barrack for\r\n  the service of the public.\r\n\r\n  _Ordered._ That Mr. Arcedeckne, Mr. R. Beckford and Mr. Fuller be a\r\n  committee for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  3. _Resolved._ It is the opinion of this Committee that a barrack be\r\n  built at Kingston, at the expense of the parish of Kingston.\r\n\r\n  4. _Resolved._ It is the opinion of this Committee that the barrack at\r\n  Port-Royal be enlarged.\r\n\r\n  _Ordered._ That it be an instruction to the committee appointed to\r\n  bring in the bill for obliging the several parishes to repair and keep\r\n  up the respective barracks already built, to insert a clause therein\r\n  to oblige the parish of Kingston to build a barrack at the expense of\r\n  the parish.”\r\n\r\nWe learn from Foster’s “Alumini Oxonienses” that William Dennys, of New\r\nCollege, a chaplain who took his B.A. degree in 1652, obtained leave of\r\nabsence from the parliamentary visitors, for special service at sea in\r\n1654, and died at Jamaica in 1655. He probably came out with Penn and\r\nVenables, and predeceased Thomas Gage who was chaplain to the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nIn 1655, the very year in which the English took the island, Admiral\r\nWilliam Goodson, one of the Commissioners charged with the conduct of\r\nPenn and Venables’s expedition, requested that “some godly ministers\r\nwith monies for their maintenance” should be sent out. Two years later\r\nthe want of ministers in Jamaica was referred by the Council of State to\r\nthe Committee for America for suggestions. It was one of the\r\ninstructions to Doyley, when he was made governor in 1661, that he\r\nshould give the best encouragement to ministers “that Christianity and\r\nthe Protestant religion, according to the profession of the Church of\r\nEngland, may have due reverence amongst them”; and later in the year it\r\nwas resolved that the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London\r\nshould choose five able ministers to be maintained in Jamaica at the\r\nKing’s expense for one year, the governor to provide for their\r\nmaintenance afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1664 Sir Thomas Modyford, the governor, stated that there was “but\r\none church (in the whole island) at St. Katherine’s [at Spanish Town],\r\nbeing a fair Spanish Church ruined by the old soldiers, but lately in\r\nsome measure repaired by Sir Charles Lyttelton; but they are now levying\r\ncontributions to raise churches in some of the richest parishes.” There\r\nwere then five ministers in the island, Henry Howser (a Switzer) being\r\nat St. Catherine’s.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 Sir Thomas Modyford replied to enquiries of His Majesty’s\r\nCommissioners that: “Their Lordships will find among the statutes with\r\nthese presented a law for the maintenance of the ministry; until this\r\nHis Majesty was piously pleased to pay five ministers £100 each, but\r\nsince they were left upon the charity of the inhabitants, he has\r\nencouraged them to enlarge their payments at St. Katherine’s, where he\r\nlives, from £50 to £140, and at Port Royal £200. At St. Katherine’s, Mr.\r\nHowser, a Switzer, officiates; at Port Royal, Mr. Maxwell, a Scotchman;\r\nat St. John’s, Mr. Lemmings, an Englishman, lately sent by my Lord of\r\nLondon; and in St. Andrew’s, Mr. Zellers, another Switzer; all these are\r\northodox men, of good life and conversation, live comfortably on their\r\nmeans, and preach every Sunday. Mr. Pickering, of St. Thomas and St.\r\nDavid’s, at Port Morant and Yallows, is lately dead, and they have none\r\nto supply his place. But, alas, these five do not preach to one-third of\r\nthe island, and the plantations are at such distance that it is\r\nimpossible to make up congregations; but they meet at each others’\r\nhouses, as the primitive Christians did, and there pray, read a chapter,\r\nsing a psalm, and home again; so that did not the accessors to this\r\nisland come so well instructed in the article of faith, it might well be\r\nfeared the Christian religion would be quite forgot. I have, my Lords,\r\nand shall use all the persuasive means I can to advance this people’s\r\nknowledge of the true God, as also of all Christian and moral virtues.”\r\n\r\nIn 1675 a Mr. Crandfield reported that there were six churches and four\r\nministers, and two years later there were but three clergy in the\r\nisland. In a MS., once in the House of Assembly Library, entitled “The\r\nState of the Church in His Majesty’s Island of Jamaica,” dated May 1675\r\n(which was allowed to perish after Richard Hill quoted from it in 1864),\r\nit was stated, after enumerating the then stipended ministers of\r\nreligion: “All the other parishes on the northside, and St. Elizabeth’s\r\non the south, are great and ill-settled, without churches, they being\r\nalmost planted in Sir Thomas Lynch’s time, who ordered Glebe lands to be\r\nreserved in two or three places in every parish, that in time may prove\r\nconvenient.”\r\n\r\nIn 1677 Howser and Zellers, “His Majesty’s chaplains in Jamaica,”\r\npetitioned that they might receive the pay promised to them, and\r\ndeclared that “the island, in regard of its great poverty, is not able\r\nto allow maintenance for four chaplains resident there.” In the same\r\nyear the Bishop of London represented the ill-usage of ministers in the\r\nPlantations, and their too great subjection to the vestrymen, especially\r\nin Jamaica; and the Lords of Trade and Plantations resolved that the\r\nclergy should, in future, “make a part of the vestry in the regulation\r\nof all matters, except in the settlement of their maintenance.”\r\n\r\nIn 1681 an Act was passed for the maintenance of ministers and the poor,\r\nand erecting and repairing churches. Ten vestrymen and two churchwardens\r\nwere yearly elected by the freeholders of each parish. The law provided\r\nfor the keeping of a register of births, christenings, marriages and\r\nburials. Port Royal was to pay £250 to its minister, St. Catherine £120,\r\nSt. Thomas, St. Andrew and St. John £100, and other parishes £80. These\r\nstipends were apparently not sufficient inducement, for in 1706 an Act\r\nwas passed “for the encouragement of good and able ministers to come to\r\nthis island.” The salary of St. Catherine was fixed at £150 (or £250 if\r\nthe vestry wished); for St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, St. Dorothy, Kingston,\r\nVere, and Clarendon, it was £150 (or £200), and for the other parishes\r\n(including Port Royal, by reason of its recent disasters) £100 (or £150\r\nif the vestry wished). This system of payment of the rectors by the\r\nparishes was continued till late in the eighteenth century, when they\r\nwere placed on the Island Establishment.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 Sir Thomas Lynch sent home to the Bishop of London a detailed\r\nreport of the state of the Church in Jamaica. He says: “At St. Jaga de\r\nla Vega the minister is also a Swiss, Mr. Howsyer; he has £140 a year by\r\nlaw, and, since I came, £150. He is a reasonable preacher, a good liver,\r\nwell esteemed, and very rich. The church is a Spanish church, and the\r\nparsonage good. The parish is called St. Catherine’s.”\r\n\r\nWhen, by an Act passed in 1789, burying in churches was prohibited, on\r\npenalty of £500 imposed on any rector who permitted it, the rectors\r\nreceived compensation in lieu of fees, the largest amount falling to the\r\nrector of Kingston, who received £100 per annum, St. Catherine being\r\nnext with £70.\r\n\r\nAs evidence of the relative value of the livings in the island at the\r\ntime it is interesting to quote from the “Jamaica Magazine” that in\r\nNovember 1814, “The Reverend Alexander Campbell has been translated from\r\nthe living of Kingston to that of St. Andrew’s, vacant by the death of\r\nhis father, the reverend John Campbell; the Reverend Isaac Mann to that\r\nof Kingston; the Reverend William Vaughan Hamilton from St. Elizabeth’s\r\nto St. Catherine’s; and the Reverend William Peat from St. Dorothy’s to\r\nSt. Elizabeth’s.”\r\n\r\nIn 1800 Ecclesiastical Commissioners were appointed. But it is evident\r\nthat they had not been able to effect much by April 1802, when Lady\r\nNugent wrote: “I will conclude my tour through the island with a few\r\nremarks. In this country it appears as if everything were bought and\r\nsold. Clergymen make no secret of making a traffic of their livings; but\r\nGeneral N—— has set his face against such proceedings, and has refused\r\nmany applications for the purpose. He is determined to do all he can\r\ntowards the reformation of the Church, and thus rendering it\r\nrespectable. It is indeed melancholy to see the general disregard of\r\nboth religion and morality throughout the whole island.”\r\n\r\nMatters were much improved when the see of Jamaica, which then included\r\nthe Bahamas and British Honduras, was formed in 1824; and in 1870, when\r\nDisestablishment threw the Church almost entirely on to voluntary\r\nresources, it gave to it a new vitality.\r\n\r\nMany of the old Baptismal, Marriage and Burial registers are deposited\r\nfor safe keeping in the Record Office at Spanish Town, where all the old\r\nchurch registers should be, as they would there have a chance of longer\r\nlife than when exposed to the vicissitudes of local vestries, and would,\r\nmoreover, be more readily available for research than when scattered\r\nthroughout the island.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient to give here a list of the earliest date of the\r\nBaptismal, Marriage and Burial registers for the island, taken from\r\n“Sketch Pedigrees of some of the early Settlers in Jamaica.

B. Livingston, were published\r\nin “Caribbeana” for January and April 1910. A full account of the\r\nhistory of the Church of England in Jamaica may be gathered from the\r\nwork of the Rev. J. B. Ellis, published in 1913, “The Diocese of\r\nJamaica.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Department of Public Gardens and Plantations, now\r\nknown as the Agricultural Department, is intimately connected with the\r\nvarious vicissitudes through which the island has passed. The following\r\nparticulars have been taken in great measure from the account in the\r\n“Handbook of Jamaica for 1900.”\r\n\r\nDirectly and indirectly during the last hundred years and more the\r\nDepartment has been the means of introducing and propagating some of the\r\nmost valuable plants, now the sources of the staple products of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact that with the exception of pimento and a few\r\nothers of comparatively little value, most of the staple products of the\r\nisland are derived from exotics or plants introduced from other parts of\r\nthe globe, either by accident or by direct intention.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane, though here in the time of the Spaniards, was first\r\ncultivated by the English, by Sir Thomas Modyford, in 1660; but its most\r\nvaluable varieties, the Otaheite and Bourbon canes, were introduced in\r\nHis Majesty’s ships by Captain Bligh as late as 1796. Coffee was\r\nintroduced by Governor Sir Nicholas Lawes in 1718. The mango, brought by\r\nCaptain Marshall of Rodney’s squadron in 1782, was first planted in\r\nHinton East’s botanic garden, in Liguanea, and is now one of the\r\ncommonest trees in the island. The plentiful and free-growing logwood\r\nwas introduced from Honduras by Dr. Barham, the author of “Hortus\r\nAmericanus,” in 1715. The beautiful akee was obtained by Dr. Thomas\r\nClarke, first Island Botanist, from a West African slave ship in 1778.\r\nThe cinnamon came with the mango in Captain Marshall’s ship in 1782, and\r\nwas distributed from the Bath Garden by Dr. Dancer. The ubiquitous but\r\ngraceful bamboo is also an exotic and owes its introduction to M.\r\nWallen, who brought it from Hispaniola and first planted it in the\r\nparish of St. Thomas-in-the-East. To Wallen, formerly owner of Cold\r\nSpring and Wallenford, the friend of Swartz and a successful botanist,\r\nwe are no doubt indebted for the first plants of the watercress,\r\nchickweed, wild pansy, groundsel, dead nettles, dandelion, common\r\nhoneysuckle, black-berried elder, evening primrose, nasturtium, common\r\nmyrtle, the English oak, white clover, and the sweet violet, now common\r\non the Port Royal and Blue Mountains, being possibly escapes from his\r\ngarden at Cold Spring, which even in 1793 was well stocked with choice\r\nselections of introduced flowers and European trees and shrubs. For the\r\ncherimoyer we are indebted to Hinton East, who introduced if from South\r\nAmerica in 1786; to East and his magnificent garden we also owe the\r\njasmines and many species of lilies, many convolvuli, the oleander, the\r\nhorse-radish tree, numerous roses, the trumpet-flower, monkey-bread, the\r\ncamellia, _Calla æthiopica_, the weeping willow, the mulberry tree, the\r\n_Arbor vitæ_, and the sweet-scented mimosa. Dr. Clarke, on his arrival\r\nas Island Botanist in 1777, brought with him the jujube tree, and the\r\nlitchi, the purple dracæna, the sago palm, and the valuable camphor\r\ntree; at the same time there came the now common “almond tree,” the tea\r\ntree, and the “sunn” hemp plant. The wanglo, or zezegary, was sent by\r\nSir Simon Haughton Clarke in 1801. The nutmeg tree, first brought by\r\nRodney in 1782, was reintroduced by Dr. Marter in 1788, together with\r\nthe clove and black pepper, for which he received the thanks of the\r\nHouse of Assembly and an honorarium of £1000. The seeds of the valuable\r\nand now indispensable Guineagrass were accidentally introduced from the\r\nWest Coast of Africa as bird food in 1745. Scotch grass received its\r\nname from having been first brought from Scotland to Barbados.\r\n\r\nPindars were brought to Hinton East from South America; the afou, the\r\nacorn and Guinea yam, and indeed all but one of the cultivated yams, are\r\nfrom the coast of Africa or East Indies. The seeds of the guango were\r\nbrought over from the mainland by Spanish cattle. Cacao is indigenous to\r\nCentral America. The shaddock was brought to the West Indies from China\r\nby Captain Shaddock, hence its name. The genip was brought to Jamaica\r\nfrom Surinam by one Guaf, a Jew. The ginger is a native of the East\r\nIndies, introduced to Jamaica by a Spaniard, Francisco de Mendiza. The\r\nlocust tree and blimbling were brought to Jamaica from the South Seas in\r\nH.M.S. _Providence_ in the year 1793. The orange, both sweet and\r\nSeville, the lime, the lemon and citron, were brought hither by the\r\nSpaniards. The Jerusalem thorn is from the Spanish main. The prickly\r\npear is a Mexican plant.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the first public garden established in the island was\r\nthe old Botanic Garden at Bath; and in the Journals of the House of\r\nAssembly mention is made of Dr. Thomas Clarke, “Practitioner in Physic\r\nand Surgery,” who came to the island in 1777, at the particular instance\r\nand request of Sir Basil Keith, to superintend two botanic gardens, then\r\nintended to be established in the island. One was to be a European\r\nGarden, which however was not established till long after, at Cinchona,\r\nand the other was the Tropical Garden at Bath.\r\n\r\nA private garden possessing many rare and valuable plants had already\r\nbeen formed by Hinton East in Liguanea (Gordon Town), which, on the\r\ndeath of the founder, became the property of his nephew, E. H. East,\r\n“who with great generosity offered it to the Assembly of Jamaica for the\r\nuse of the public at their own price.”\r\n\r\nBryan Edwards remarks that “the Assembly of Jamaica, cooperating with\r\nthe benevolent intentions of His Majesty (to introduce valuable exotics\r\nand productions of the most distant regions to the West Indies)\r\npurchased in 1792–93 the magnificent Botanical Garden of Mr. East and\r\nplaced it on the public establishment, under the care of skilful\r\ngardeners, one of whom, Mr. James Wiles, had circumnavigated the globe\r\nwith Captain Bligh.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting catalogue of the plants in this garden, at the time of\r\nEast’s decease, was prepared by Dr. A. Broughton, and forms an appendix\r\nunder the title of “Hortus Eastensis” to Bryan Edwards’s “History of the\r\nBritish West Indies.”\r\n\r\nFrom a letter addressed to Sir Joseph Banks by the Botanic Gardener,\r\nJamaica, 1793, we gather that the bread-fruit trees “were upwards of 11\r\nfeet high, with leaves 36 inches long, and the success in cultivating\r\nthem has exceeded the most sanguine expectations; the cinnamon tree is\r\nbecome very common, and mangoes are in such plenty as to be planted in\r\nthe negro grounds. There are, also, several bearing trees of the jack or\r\nbastard bread-fruit ... and we have one nutmeg plant.” For his services\r\nin introducing the bread-fruit tree, 1000 guineas were granted in 1793\r\nto Captain Bligh and 500 guineas to Lieutenant Portlock.\r\n\r\nThe Botanic Garden at Liguanea continued to be under Wiles’s care\r\n(superintended by a Committee of the House of Assembly) for many years,\r\nwhile that at Bath was entrusted to Dr. Dancer as Island Botanist. The\r\nallowance for the two gardens was fixed at £800. The duties of the\r\nIsland Botanist were defined as follows: “To collect, class and describe\r\nthe native plants of the island; to use his endeavours to find out their\r\nmedicinal virtues; to discover if they possess any qualities useful to\r\nthe arts, and annually to furnish the House with a correct list of such\r\nplants as are in the Botanic Gardens, together with such information as\r\nhe may have acquired relative to their uses and virtues.”\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of distributing the bread-fruit and other valuable\r\nplants from the Botanic Garden the Committee of the House “appointed\r\nseveral Committees for each county, to receive and distribute the\r\nallotments destined for them,” and, according as sufficient numbers were\r\nprepared for propagation, the Chairmen of the County Committees were\r\napprised and their respective proportions delivered and distributed, “by\r\nwhich means,” it is quaintly remarked, “the public has derived all the\r\nadvantages to be expected from these establishments.”\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1791–1807 the Committee in charge of the Botanic\r\nGardens, with Shirley as Chairman, greatly developed and improved them.\r\nEnquiries were made everywhere for new products; thanks and gratuities\r\nwere voted for the introduction of valuable plants, and these were\r\ncultivated and distributed with great assiduity and care. In order to\r\nmake the islands less dependent on America for supplies every\r\nencouragement was given to the cultivation of yams, cocoas, maize,\r\nplantain, and such products as the bread-fruit, zezegary or wanglo,\r\nnutmeg, clove, cinnamon, pindars and coffee, it being believed that the\r\n“cultivation of these valuable exotics will without doubt in a course of\r\nyears lessen the dependence of the Sugar Islands on North America for\r\nfood and necessaries; and not only supply subsistence for future\r\ngenerations, but probably furnish fresh incitements to industry, new\r\nimprovements in the arts, and new subjects of commerce.”\r\n\r\nThese beneficial efforts, long and successfully maintained, were however\r\ngreatly relaxed after the year 1807, and under the influence of domestic\r\ntroubles, want of due appreciation of the value and nature of botanic\r\ngardens, or the need of strict economy, a bill was introduced into the\r\nHouse of Assembly in 1810 “for vesting the Botanic Garden in Liguanea in\r\nthe Commissioners of the Board of Works, to be sold and the money to be\r\nbrought to the credit of the public.” This bill was finally passed\r\nDecember 1810, and, the garden passing to private hands, many of the\r\nvaluable plants contained in it, and collected with so much care and\r\nindustry, were entirely lost.\r\n\r\nThe garden at Bath was however maintained, though in a very reduced\r\nstate. Dr. Stewart West acted for some time as Island Botanist, and was\r\nengaged in collecting the plants that had been lost from the gardens,\r\nfor the purpose of propagating and distributing them.\r\n\r\nThe first record to be found of any agricultural society in Jamaica\r\noccurs in 1807. The society, which had evidently been in existence for\r\nsome little time, belonged to Cornwall. As it was called the\r\nAgricultural Society it was presumably the only one of its kind in\r\nexistence. In 1825 a Jamaica Horticultural Society was formed at\r\nKingston, which two years later became the Jamaica Society for the\r\nCultivation of Agriculture and other Arts and Sciences, which did good\r\nwork till it ceased to exist in 1850.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1824 an effort was made to restore the value and usefulness\r\nof the botanic gardens, and Sir M. B. Clare, from the Committee\r\nappointed to enquire into the state of the Botanic Garden, reported:\r\n“That the Botanic Garden in St.-Thomas-in-the-East, established more\r\nthan fifty years ago, has during that period received and transmitted\r\nfor propagation throughout the island many valuable plants. That the\r\nroyal munificence of his late Majesty promoted the object of this\r\ninstitution by vessels of war employed to collect plants in the\r\nsettlements of the east and south seas, some of which are now\r\nnaturalized in this island, and more might be added, greatly to the\r\nadvantage of its inhabitants. Your Committee therefore recommend that\r\nproper care may be taken to preserve the valuable plants which the\r\nGarden now contains. That in addition to the above considerations, Your\r\nCommittee are of opinion that one object of this institution of chief\r\nimportance has never been properly attended to, namely, the\r\ninvestigation of the many unknown native plants of this island, which,\r\nfrom the properties of those already known, it is reasonable to infer\r\nwould prove highly beneficial in augmenting our internal resources, by\r\nsupplying various articles either for food, for medicine, or for\r\nmanufactures, to be cultivated, prepared and exported as staple\r\ncommodities, by which great commercial advantages might be obtained;\r\namong others the various vegetable dyes claim particular attention as\r\npromising a fruitful field for discovery. That it appears to your\r\nCommittee that the person fit for undertaking such enquiries ought to be\r\na well-educated and scientific man, combining with his botanical\r\nknowledge sufficient information in experimental chemistry to enable him\r\nto discover the useful qualities of such indigenous plants, and improve\r\nthe productions of those already known; but at the same time your\r\nCommittee strongly recommend that such person should not be a medical\r\nman, as his whole time and attention ought to be applied to promote the\r\nabove objects. Your Committee recommends to the House to instruct the\r\nCommissioners of Correspondence to direct the Agent to apply for such a\r\nperson to the President of the Linnean Society in London.” As a result\r\nof this proposal James Macfadyen was selected and approved of as a\r\nbotanist, and arrived in the island in 1825.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it was felt that the botanic garden at Bath was too\r\ndistant from Kingston and the seat of government to answer the intention\r\nproposed, and it was recommended that a bill be brought in for\r\npurchasing a proper place for such a garden in the vicinity of Kingston\r\nand Spanish Town.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was, however, never carried into execution, and the garden\r\nat Bath on the removal and death of Macfadyen, “fast falling to decay,”\r\nwas placed in charge of Thomas Higson; and his petitions addressed to\r\nthe House of Assembly during 1830–32 show that the allowances made were\r\nnot sufficient for the maintenance of the garden even in its reduced\r\nstate, and that no remuneration had been made to him for its\r\nsuperintendence.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, in another fit of economy, owing to domestic troubles and the\r\nneed for retrenchment, a Committee was appointed to “report on the best\r\nmeans of diminishing the contingencies and expenditure of the island and\r\nto consider whether the Botanic Gardens at Bath could be sold for the\r\nbenefit of the public.” The report was made at the close of the year and\r\nordered to lie on the table. Nothing further, however, appears to have\r\nbeen done for the garden till 1840, when the sum of £300 was “voted for\r\nthe improvement of the Garden at Bath and for the services of a\r\nBotanist.” This sum, afterwards reduced to £200, was placed in the hands\r\nof the members of St. Thomas-in-the-East, Portland and St. David, by\r\nwhom it appears to have been administered down to the year 1852, when\r\nthe garden was transferred to the Board of Directors of the Bath of St.\r\nThomas the Apostle. Nathaniel Wilson was appointed Curator of the Garden\r\nin 1847, and devoted many years, often labouring under great\r\ndiscouragements, in maintaining and improving the garden and introducing\r\nnew plants. His yearly reports contain sufficient evidence of the value\r\nof the garden, small as it was, to an island entirely dependent for its\r\nprosperity on its agricultural interest; and, assisted and encouraged by\r\nthe Rev. Thomas Wharton, Wilson laboured most successfully in the\r\npropagation and distribution of valuable plants, and especially in\r\ndeveloping the “fibre” resources of the colony.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 we find there were local agricultural societies in St. Dorothy,\r\nSt. John, St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, St. Thomas-in-the-East, St. Catherine,\r\nSt. Andrew, St. James and Trelawny. In the following year a general\r\nAgricultural Society was established, with the governor as patron, with\r\neighteen vice-patrons, and local committees in each of the parishes. In\r\n1845 this society became the Royal Agricultural Society of Jamaica. In\r\n1854 a Jamaica Society of Arts was established, which two years later\r\nbecame the Royal Society of Arts of Jamaica. This in 1864 was\r\namalgamated with the Royal Agricultural Society—the two becoming the\r\nRoyal Society of Arts and Agriculture, but it ceased after about 1873:\r\nthe present Jamaica Agricultural Society being established in 1895.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 a grant was passed by the Legislature for purchasing land and\r\nfor a botanic garden at Castleton, in the parish of St. Mary, nineteen\r\nmiles from Kingston, and steps were at once taken to establish the\r\ngarden and remove such plants as could be spared from Bath.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1861 Wilson referred to the successful introduction of seeds\r\nof the valuable cinchona tree to Jamaica, through the liberality of the\r\nBritish Government and recommendation of Sir W. J. Hooker of Kew. By the\r\nmonth of October 1861 Wilson reported that he had over four hundred\r\nhealthy plants quite ready for planting out. As the climate of Bath was\r\nunsuitable for the successful growth of cinchona, by the kindness of Dr.\r\nHamilton, they were tried at Cold Spring coffee plantation in St.\r\nAndrew, at an elevation of 4000 feet. Here Wilson found “the climate and\r\nsoil to be all he could desire,” and as it afforded every facility for\r\ncarrying out so valuable an experiment he at once availed himself of it,\r\nand planted out in the coffee fields, November 1861, several plants of\r\neach species.\r\n\r\nThe garden at Castleton was then finally established, and ultimately the\r\ngovernment Cinchona plantations were opened in 1868, and placed under\r\nthe management of Robert Thompson, who on Wilson’s retirement had been\r\nappointed superintendent of the Botanic Gardens. The cinchona trees\r\nflourished, but the industry was killed by the cheaper production of\r\nbark from India.\r\n\r\nThompson retired in 1878, and was succeeded by Mr. (now Sir) Daniel\r\nMorris till 1886, then Mr. William Fawcett till 1908, when the\r\nDepartment was changed into an agricultural Department, with Mr. H. H.\r\nCousins as Director and a Farm School and Stock Farm were added to the\r\nHope establishment. At the same time the Government Laboratory,\r\noriginated in 1870 as a separate department, and in 1901 brought into\r\ndirect connexion with agricultural work, was amalgamated with it.\r\n\r\nThe Palisadoes plantation of coco-nuts, which in 1884 had some 23,000\r\npalms in bearing, was while in the care of lessee later attacked by\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nMining operations have been carried on with more or less success in\r\nJamaica from time to time. In 1857 there were four mining companies\r\noperating: the Clarendon Consolidated Copper Mining Company in\r\nClarendon, where mining has recently been reintroduced; the\r\nWheal-Jamaica, with a capital of £100,000; the Ellerslie and Bardowie\r\nCopper Mines (capital £50,000) in St. Andrew; and the Rio Grande Copper\r\nMine (capital £60,000) in Portland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest reference to Education in the history of Jamaica occurs\r\nunder date February 23, 1663, when a warrant was issued to prepare a\r\nbill for the king’s signature authorizing the treasurer of the exchequer\r\nto pay the sum of £500 yearly to Thomas Povey to be by him transmitted\r\nand equally distributed to five ministers serving in Jamaica or to four\r\nministers and a schoolmaster as shall seem fit to the governor.\r\n\r\nJamaica then apparently preferred preaching to teaching—there being at\r\nthe time obviously few children of a teachable age—for there is no\r\nfurther reference to the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 the last of twenty-four enquiries sent to the governor, Sir\r\nThomas Modyford, was “what provision for instructing the people in the\r\nChristian religion and for paying the ministry?”; but there was no\r\nmention made of secular education.\r\n\r\nIn 1675 Sir Thomas Lynch reported that “Mr. Lemon, a sobergoing man and\r\na very good preacher, is minister of Guinaboa, St. John’s parish; he has\r\n£100 per annum from the parish, and about as much from Colonel Coape for\r\nkeeping a free school he has erected.” To John Coape, who was a member\r\nof the first Council, Custos of Precinct VII (consisting of the parishes\r\nof St. John, St. Ann, St. George and St. Mary) and a Quaker, is due the\r\nhonour of having spent the first money recorded in the cause of\r\neducation in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe art of self-defence was not neglected. Sara Lyssons, of St. Thomas,\r\nemployed John Lookmore, “a master of the noble science of defence,” to\r\nteach her sons, in 1678.\r\n\r\nTill the end of the seventeenth century the safety of trade and\r\ncommerce, the means of defence against Spanish or French invasion, the\r\nencouragement of immigration, government, and legislation, formed the\r\nsubjects of discussion with the home government, and the comparatively\r\nnewly formed colony was too unsettled to think of imparting knowledge to\r\nthe rising generation.\r\n\r\nThe only reference to education found in the legislation of the century\r\nis in an “Act for Confirmation of Pious, Charitable and Public Gifts and\r\nGrants,” to “erecting or maintaining of Churches, Chappels, Schools,\r\nUniversities, Colledges, or other places for education of Youth or\r\nmaintenance of men of Learning, or any Alms-houses or Hospitals, or any\r\nother uses whatsoever, heretofore made, and hereafter to be made within\r\nthe time aforesaid.” But it was long ere “Colledges” came into being,\r\nand the Universities are as yet in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1688, Sir Henry Morgan, of buccaneering fame, gave £100 to\r\naid the bequest of £100 sterling by Joachim Hane to found a school in\r\nSt. Mary, but nothing was rendered available to the establishment of\r\nsuch a school.\r\n\r\nBridges tells us that “in the year 1695 Sir Nicolas Lawes bequeathed his\r\nestate, in default of heirs, to found a free school for the benefit of\r\nthe parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew. A school was consequently\r\nincorporated, with a seal, bearing the founder’s arms, but it failed for\r\nwant of sufficient means, and the land was attached to the rectory.\r\nTwelve years afterwards Zacariah Gaulton left £80 per annum to pay a\r\nmaster and £500 to build a schoolhouse, and in 1721 Benjamin Cotman\r\nbequeathed his estate for the same purpose.” As a matter of fact Sir\r\nNicholas Lawes’s will is dated August 21, 1730, and the bequest was not\r\nto _establish_ a school, but “unto the Governors of the Free School of\r\nSt. Andrews in the Island of Jamaica for the time being, and in case\r\nthere be no Governors at that time as the Law directs then to such\r\nGovernors as the Chancellor or Commander-in-Chief of the said Island\r\nshall direct and appoint Governors of the said Free School then I say I\r\ngive to such Governors of the said Free School and their successors for\r\never the estate and premisses aforesaid for and towards the maintenance\r\nof the Masters Teachers and other Officers of the said Free School the\r\nrepairing and making new Buildings more fitt and comodious large house\r\nor houses on the land at Halfway Tree which I formerly gave for that use\r\nfinishing and furnishing the same and for and towards the maintenance\r\nsupport education and learning of so many Scholars (native youths of\r\nJamaica) as the said Governors of the said School or the major part of\r\nthem shall from time to time think fitt to admit to that benefit and the\r\nsaid bequest can support and maintain.”\r\n\r\nBut this bequest never took effect, for all his children who were living\r\nwhen he made his will—his sons James and Temple and his daughter Judith\r\nMaria—survived him.\r\n\r\nRoger Elletson, Speaker of the House of Assembly, and Chief Justice, in\r\nthe year 1690 gave £20 towards the foundation of a school in St. Andrew.\r\nEdward Harrison, in 1695, and Charles Delacree, in the succeeding year,\r\neach bequeathed £10 per annum for the same purpose. The bequests,\r\nhowever, were allowed to lie dormant until the year 1789, when the\r\nprincipal and interest were estimated at £14,710, no part of which was,\r\nhowever, recovered.\r\n\r\nJohn Mills, in 1711, after several entails, left money to establish a\r\nfree school in St. Elizabeth, but no such institution ever existed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736, Edward Pennant left £200 for a school and books, in\r\nClarendon; and a school was founded in Old Woman’s Savannah, aided by\r\nsubscriptions to the amount of £2000. It flourished about the year 1758,\r\nwhen, by some ill-management, it failed; the premises were vested in\r\ntrustees for sale, and the institution vanished.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the seventeenth century the need of education for the sons\r\nand daughters of the colonists must have become pressing. The plan\r\nusually adopted by those who could afford it was to send their children\r\n(often the illegitimate as well as the legitimate) home; and so it\r\ncontinued in the main till the end of the following century, and indeed\r\nfar into the nineteenth. Many a son of Jamaica acquired a good education\r\nin England, and not a few graduated at the universities. A manuscript\r\n“Catalogue of Men born in the Island of Jamaica who matriculated at\r\nOxford 1689–1885 extracted from Alumni Oxonienses. (To which I have\r\nadded a few stray names of men connected with the island.) By William\r\nCowper, M.A.,” in the Library of the Institute of Jamaica, contains 268\r\nnames of men known to have matriculated at Oxford. Peter Beckford, who\r\nmatriculated in 1688, and afterwards became lieutenant-governor of\r\nJamaica, is the first on the list which includes other well-known names,\r\nsuch as Garbrand, Dawkins, Nedham, Ellis, Price, Gale, Gregory,\r\nHaughton, Morant, Barham, Lawrence, Lewis, Clarke, Barrett, East,\r\nDallas, Dwarris and Scarlett.\r\n\r\nA review of the state of education in the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury is given by Leslie in his “New History of Jamaica” (1740). He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  “Learning is here at the lowest Ebb; there is no publick School in the\r\n  whole Island, neither do they seem fond of the thing; several large\r\n  Donations have been made for such Uses, but have never taken Effect.\r\n  The Office of a Teacher is looked upon as contemptible and no\r\n  Gentleman keeps Company with one of that Character; to read, write and\r\n  cast Accounts, is all the Education they desire, and even these are\r\n  but scurvily taught. A Man of any Parts or Learning, that would employ\r\n  himself in that Business, would be despised and starve. The Gentlemen\r\n  whose Fortunes can allow it, send their Children to _Great Britain_,\r\n  where they have the Advantage of a polite generous Education; but\r\n  others are spoil’d, and make such an inconsiderable Figure ever after,\r\n  that they are the common Butt in every Conversation. Mr. _Beckford_[3]\r\n  has lately bequeathed £2000 _sterling_, for a Free-School: It is\r\n  doubtful whether this Gentleman’s Intentions will be answered by the\r\n  Managers; for by their way of proceeding there is small Appearance\r\n  they design to encourage Men of Merit to take upon them such an\r\n  Office. Several have lately offered themselves who were every way\r\n  qualified for the Undertaking; and some promised themselves Success,\r\n  from the good Disposition they perceived in many to encourage their\r\n  Design; but after a Trial were of Necessity obliged to quit it. ’Tis\r\n  Pity, in a Place like this, where the Means could be so easily\r\n  afforded, something of a publick Nature should not be done for the\r\n  Advantage of Posterity; but when such a Spirit will appear, is hard to\r\n  determine. There are indeed several Gentlemen who are well acquainted\r\n  with Learning, in some of its most valuable Branches: but these are\r\n  few; and the Generality seem to have a greater Affection for the\r\n  moodish Vice of Gaming than the _Belles Lettres_, and love a Pack of\r\n  Cards better than the Bible. To talk of a _Homer_, or a _Virgil_, of a\r\n  _Tully_, or a _Demosthenes_, is quite unpolite; and it cannot be\r\n  otherwise; for a Boy, till the Age of Seven or Eight, diverts himself\r\n  with the Negroes, acquires their broken way of talking, their Manners\r\n  of Behaviour, and all the Vices which these unthinking Creatures can\r\n  teach: Then perhaps he goes to School; but young Master must not be\r\n  corrected; if he learns, ’tis well; if not, it can’t be helped. After\r\n  a little Knowledge of reading, he goes to the Dancing-school, and\r\n  commences Beau, learns the common Topicks of Discourse, and visits and\r\n  rakes with his Equals. This is their Method; and how can it be\r\n  supposed one of such a Turn can entertain any generous Notions,\r\n  distinguish the Beauties of Virtue, act for the Good of his Country,\r\n  or appear in any Station of Life, so as to deserve Applause? Some of\r\n  the Ladies read, they all dance a great deal, coquet much, dress for\r\n  Admirers; and at last, for the most part, run away with the most\r\n  insignificant of their humble Servants. Their Education consists\r\n  intirely in acquiring these little Arts. ’Tis a thousand Pities they\r\n  do not improve their Minds, as well as their Bodies; they would then\r\n  be charming Creatures indeed.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Peter Beckford, the grandfather of William Beckford of Fonthill, who\r\n  behaved badly with respect to the Drax property.\r\n\r\nThat the object of those few who, amongst a community indifferent to\r\nsuch matters, wished to benefit education in Jamaica, had been in the\r\nmain disregarded during the eighteenth century, is evident from a report\r\nof a Committee of the Assembly presented in November 1791 by Bryan\r\nEdwards, the historian. The Committee had been appointed to “enquire\r\ninto and prepare an account of the several charities and donations that\r\nhave been made and devised from time to time, by well disposed persons\r\nfor the establishment of free-schools in the different parts of this\r\nIsland, and which have not been carried into effect agreeably to the\r\nintention of the donors; and further to report a state of the landed and\r\nother real property, funds, and securities for money, which, in the\r\njudgment of the Committee, are at this time subject and liable to such\r\ndonations; and their opinion what steps are proper to be taken for the\r\nrecovery and establishment thereof for the purposes intended.”\r\n\r\nThey reported “that the committee, limiting their enquiries to such\r\ncharities or donations only, in the recovery whereof there appears at\r\nthis time any visible property to which resort can be had, confine\r\nthemselves to the several Parishes of St. Ann, St. Andrew, Vere, and\r\nWestmoreland: In each of these parishes donations have been made for the\r\npurpose in the resolution of the House mentioned; some of which\r\ndonations have not been carried into full effect, and others have\r\nremained wholly unapplied and unaccounted for by the several devisees,\r\nexecutors, purchasers, or possessors, under the original granters or\r\ndonors of such estates or properties as were specially charged with such\r\ndonations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat matters had not much improved by the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury is evident from “An Account of Jamaica and its Inhabitants,”\r\npublished in 1808. “Literature,” the author says, “is little cultivated\r\nin Jamaica, nor is reading a very favorite amusement. There is a\r\ncirculating Library in Kingston, and, in one or two other places a\r\npaltry attempt at such a thing, these collections of books not being of\r\nthat choice and miscellaneous nature which they ought to be, but usually\r\ncomposed of a few good novels mixed with a much larger proportion of\r\nthese ephemeral ones which are daily springing up, and which are a\r\ndisgrace to literature, and an insult to common sense.”\r\n\r\nJohn Rippingham, the author of “Jamaica considered in its Present State,\r\nPolitical, Financial, and Philosophical” (1817), presented a memorial to\r\nthe Assembly, setting forth that “there is no establishment provided by\r\nthis Island for the education of sons of gentlemen, that he had had\r\nconsiderable experience in the higher departments of education, and had\r\npublished several works upon intellectual improvement, and that he\r\noffered his abilities, acquirements, and assiduity to supply the\r\ndeficiency and craved the aid of the house.” The matter was referred to\r\na Committee and the House agreed, on their report, that they did not\r\nconsider it expedient to adopt any measure on the subject. Whether the\r\nHouse thought higher education was not necessary or doubted Rippingham’s\r\nability to give it, is not stated.\r\n\r\n\r\nBridges, writing in his “Annals,” gives some account of the educational\r\nefforts of the past. He reports “no endowments of any kind” in the\r\nparishes of Trelawny, Manchester, St. Dorothy (now part of St.\r\nCatherine), St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, and St. Thomas-in-the-East or in St.\r\nJames, although the Legislature had early in the eighteenth century\r\nappropriated £1400 per annum for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the Charity Commissioners of England reported on the schools of\r\nJamaica:\r\n\r\n“With this view, then, we may be permitted to observe that almost all\r\nthe schools in question have been greatly modified by, and that many owe\r\ntheir very existence, or their increased income to, acts of the\r\nLegislature. The original bequest to the Jamaica Free School would\r\nprobably have been lost to that institution, but for the interference of\r\nthe Legislature, and a great part of its present funds was derived from\r\na grant of the Crown. So at Vere, the Act 2 Geo. 4, c. 19, recites that\r\nthe school was failing for want of scholars, and its original\r\nconstitution was accordingly varied, by throwing it open for the\r\nreception of children from the adjoining and other parishes. Grants\r\nhave, from time to time, been made to each of these schools for\r\ntemporary purposes, _e.g._ repairs, etc., and a permanent rate of\r\ninterest amounting to no less than 8 per cent. is paid by the Receiver\r\nGeneral to both. It is not, therefore, we think, too much to say that\r\nthe Legislature has thus acquired (even if it did not necessarily\r\npossess it) a right to deal with the funds of these institutions, in\r\nsuch manner as it may deem expedient. Least of all can this be denied\r\nwhere the object is not to divert them from, but to apply them more\r\nusefully to the great purpose of education, for which they were\r\noriginally intended. More especially does this remark apply to the\r\nJamaica Free School, which appears by the Act 18, Geo. 3, c. 25, s. 5,\r\nto have been expressly intended to fulfil this end, and was even\r\npermitted to incorporate with its own funds those of any other\r\ncharitable institution, which were either unappropriated, or which\r\nparties were willing to transfer to it, with a view to carry out this\r\nvery object.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the condition of education in the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\nGardner, in his “History” (1873), states:\r\n\r\n“Another Commission, first appointed in 1843, was also discharging the\r\nduty of enquiring into the extent and management of the different\r\ncharities of the island, and quietly preparing the way for some\r\nwholesome reforms. Many painful facts were brought to light relative to\r\nthe culpable alienation of benevolent bequests from their intended\r\npurpose; and other facts equally discreditable, in reference to the mode\r\nin which existing charities were managed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRobson, in “The Story of our Jamaica Mission” (1894), says:\r\n\r\n“In 1855 the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, in a despatch to the Colonial\r\nSecretary, said: ‘By far the most creditable institution in the island\r\nis the Presbyterian Academy, principally intended for training young men\r\nof the ministry or the scholastic profession. It still held a foremost\r\nplace and was accomplishing excellent work; there were twenty-four\r\nmissionary students and fifty-six public scholars in attendance. But the\r\nexpense to the Home Church, amounting to nearly £500 a year, appeared to\r\ncall for some more economical scheme.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a chapter in his “History” devoted to “Religion, Education, and\r\nSocial Progress, from 1839 to 1865,” Gardner makes no reference to\r\nSecondary Education, unless the foundation of Calabar College in 1843\r\nfor the training of a native Baptist Ministry can be so considered.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 an Act (28 Vic., c. 23) was passed by which the Government\r\nappropriated the sums of money deposited from time to time in the Public\r\nTreasury by various charities and institutions at varying rates of\r\ninterest, and became responsible for the payment of perpetual annuities\r\nin lieu thereof, thereby preventing for the future so far as those funds\r\nwere concerned any of that misapplication alluded to in the reports of\r\nthe Committee of 1791.\r\n\r\nUnder that able organizer, Sir John Peter Grant (1866–1874), elementary\r\neducation was put on a sound basis of encouragement and support; by him\r\nwas also founded the too ambitious and short-lived College at Spanish\r\nTown which aimed at providing a university education for a community\r\nthat was not yet ready for it.\r\n\r\nDuring the governorship of Sir Anthony Musgrave the needs of Secondary\r\nEducation—which was defined as being the encouragement of education of a\r\nhigher grade “among those classes of the community who would value it,\r\nif placed within their reach, but whose means do not enable them to send\r\ntheir children to Europe for the purpose of obtaining it”—received full\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBy the creation in 1879 of the Jamaica Schools Commission, which\r\nexercises over endowed schools in Jamaica the same sort of supervision\r\nformerly exercised by the Charity Commissioners in England over English\r\nschools, means were afforded for placing the old endowed schools of the\r\nisland under suitable management. The Jamaica High School was\r\nestablished, the Jamaica Scholarship was started, and the Cambridge\r\nLocal Examinations were held for the first time in 1882; and later in\r\n1891 the University of London was induced to hold its examinations in\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nThe Wesleyan Church started their High School at York Castle, in St.\r\nAnn, in 1876; and the Institute of Jamaica for the encouragement of\r\nLiterature, Science and Art was founded by the Government in 1879.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a Secondary Education Law (32 of 1892) was passed, empowering\r\nthe Governor in Privy Council on the recommendation of the Board of\r\nEducation—a Board formed with the main object of advising on elementary\r\neducation—to declare any important centre of population to be without\r\nadequate provision for secondary education and to establish a school\r\nthere, to be managed by a local committee of management under the\r\nsupervision of the Board. A subsequent act of the Legislature\r\ntransferred the duty of supervision of all such schools from the Board\r\nof Education to the Jamaica Schools Commission. In 1911 the secondary\r\nschools of the island were first inspected and reported on by an English\r\nschool inspector.\r\n\r\nTaverns must have existed in Jamaica from early times. They are\r\nmentioned in the Deficiency law, by which one white hired or indentured\r\nservant had to be kept for every tavern or retail shop; and White’s\r\nTavern in Kingston is referred to in the Journals of the Assembly in\r\n1730. That there was a tavern at Dry Harbour in 1769 is evident from a\r\nrare view published in that year entitled “Dry Harbour in the Parish of\r\nSt. Ann’s, Jamaica, taken from the West end of the Tavern, with the Fort\r\nand Barracks, now in Ruins.”\r\n\r\nBut when one considers the large amount of travelling by road that was\r\ndone in Jamaica in the past, there were, comparatively speaking, few\r\ntaverns or posting houses, the truth being that planters and even\r\nstrangers relied in the main on the proverbial hospitality of the\r\ninhabitants. Of “the Permanent natives, or Creole men,” Long tells us in\r\nhis history (written in 1774), “their hospitality is unlimited; they\r\nhaving lodging and entertainment always at the service of transient\r\nstrangers and travellers; and receive in the most friendly manner those,\r\nwith whose character and circumstances they are often utterly\r\nunacquainted.” And he adds as a footnote: “One obvious proof of this is,\r\nthat there is scarcely one tolerable inn throughout the whole Island,\r\nexcept at a great distance from any settlement.” He refers to\r\nKnockpatrick, now in Manchester, and “two good taverns” at Lacovia in\r\nSt. Elizabeth. He says: “The Tavern at Knockpatrick (belonging also to\r\nMr. W—stn—y), the next settlement we come to, stands very commodiously,\r\nand enjoys a most excellent climate. The English beans, pease, and other\r\nculinary vegetables of Europe grow here in most seasons of the year, to\r\nthe utmost perfection. A gentleman who supped here could not help\r\nremarking, that the victuals were literally brought smoaking-hot to\r\ntable, a phenomenon seldom observed in the low lands, where the air is\r\nso much more rarefied.” Elsewhere he states that “Mr. W—stn—y” is said\r\nto be a natural son of the late “Duke of L—ds.”\r\n\r\nBryan Edwards in 1806 says: “As Mr. Long has remarked, there is not one\r\ntolerable inn throughout all the West Indies.” He then goes on to\r\ncontrast the general plenty and magnificence of the Jamaica planter’s\r\ntable and the meanness of their houses and apartments: “it being no\r\nuncommon thing to find, at the country habitations of the planters, a\r\nsplendid sideboard loaded with plate and the choicest wines, a table\r\ncovered with the finest damask, and a dinner of perhaps sixteen or\r\ntwenty covers; and all this in a hovel not superior to an English barn.”\r\n\r\nMonk Lewis, writing on his visits to the Island in 1816 and 1818, in his\r\n“Journal of a West India Proprietor,” alluded to a “solitary tavern\r\ncalled Blackheath” near Claremont, and to a lodging-house in St. Ann’s\r\nBay where he found “an excellent breakfast at an inn quite in the\r\nEnglish fashion;” to the “Wellington Hotel” at Rio Bueno in Trelawny; to\r\n“Judy James’s” in Montego Bay, in St. James; to “Miss Hetley’s” inn at\r\nYallahs in St.-Thomas-in-the-East; to a “solitary tavern” at Bluefields\r\nin Westmoreland, where he met “the handsomest creole that I have ever\r\nseen,” Antonietta by name, of Spanish-African parentage; and to “West\r\nTavern,” which must have been somewhere near Ewarton, as it was nineteen\r\nmiles from Spanish Town on the north road. He also alludes to “The\r\nGutturs” in St. Elizabeth, where they found “everything that travellers\r\ncould wish.”\r\n\r\nLewis says: “All the inns upon this road [the western half of the north\r\nside] are excellent, with the solitary exception of the Blackheath\r\nTavern, which I stopped at by mistake instead of that at Montague [an\r\nobvious misprint for Moneague].” While elsewhere he says: “Inns would be\r\nbowers of Paradise if they were all rented by mulatto ladies like Judy\r\nJames.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA strangely long time was allowed to elapse after the settling of the\r\nvarious islands in the West Indies before printing presses were\r\nestablished. Perhaps some of the governors thought like Berkeley of\r\nVirginia, who, in his report to the Lords of Trade in 1671, wrote: “But\r\nI thank God, _there are no free schools_, nor _printing_, and I hope we\r\nshall not have, these hundred years; for _learning_ has brought\r\ndisobedience, and heresy and sects into the world, and _printing_ has\r\ndivulged them, and libels against the best of government. God keep us\r\nfrom both.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest printing press in America was set up in Mexico before the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first printing press in English Colonies was set up in Massachusetts\r\nin 1638. In Jamaica it was established in 1721, sixty-six years after\r\nthe acquisition of the colony by the British. The first almanac printed\r\nin the colonies was produced at Cambridge in 1639. Unfortunately no copy\r\nis known to exist: the earliest existing being one issued at Cambridge\r\nin 1646 in private possession. Printing was practised at Havanna, in\r\nCuba, as early as 1729, and in Martinique as early as 1727; a Royal\r\nprinting house was established in St. Domingo in 1750. The “Barbados\r\nGazette,” published weekly, has been called the earliest British West\r\nIndian newspaper. Its first issue appeared on May 18, 1731, but Isaiah\r\nThomas, in his “History of Printing,” says that the “Weekly Jamaica\r\nCourant” was published at Kingston as early as 1722.\r\n\r\nThe first Jamaica wall almanac and the earliest piece of Jamaica\r\nprinting known to be extant dates from 1734, a copy of which is in the\r\nLibrary of the Institute of Jamaica. The earliest Jamaica-printed book\r\nknown is the “Merchant’s Pocket Companion,” printed in Kingston—be it\r\nobserved, not in Spanish Town, the then capital of the island—in 1751.\r\nThe next oldest Jamaica-printed book known is a volume of Love Elegies\r\nby Peter Pindar of the year 1773. A copy of each is in the Institute\r\nLibrary. The best known of the early Jamaica newspapers was the “St.\r\nJago de la Vega Gazette.” There may be early volumes of the “St. Jago de\r\nla Vega Gazette” (founded in 1756) in existence, but the earliest in the\r\nInstitute Library bears date 1791, and the earliest of the “Royal\r\nGazette” (founded in 1779) there bears date 1780. The earliest example\r\nof a Jamaica newspaper in the Library is an issue of “The St. Jago\r\nIntelligencer” of Kingston of the year 1757, possibly the earliest copy\r\nof a Jamaica newspaper extant.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Hickeringill’s “Jamaica View’d,” published in the year 1661, appears\r\nwhat is probably the oldest English map of the island. With the\r\nexception of Guanaboa, The Seven Plantations, The Angels, and St. Jago\r\nde la Vega, only towns on the sea-board are mentioned in it, and there\r\nis no attempt to divide the island into parishes.\r\n\r\nIn a census taken in 1662 the Island was divided into ten districts, as\r\nfollows: the Precincts of Port Moranto; Morant; Yealoth; and Legene; the\r\ntown of Saint Angelo Delvega [St. Jago de la Vega]; Between Black River,\r\nBower Savanna and thereabouts; In the Angles Quarter; In the Seven\r\nPlantations, Macaria, Quathebeca; In the Quarters Quanaboa and\r\nQuardelena; and Point Caugway.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Modyford, in his “View of the Condition of Jamaica, the 1st\r\nof October, 1664,” reprinted in the appendix to the first volume of the\r\n“Journals of the House of Assembly” ([Spanish Town] 1811), says “there\r\nis in the said island but seven established parishes: _videlicet_, the\r\ntown and parish of St. Katherine’s, St. John’s, the town and parish of\r\nPort Royal, Clarendon, St. David’s, St. Andrew’s, and St. Thomas, which\r\nare very large, and in them all but one church, that at St.\r\nKatherine’s.”\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. David was part of the precinct of St.\r\nThomas-in-the-East, and St. George was part of the precinct of St. Mary.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the survey ordered by Sir Thomas Modyford, and made by\r\n“Serjeant-Major John Man, Surveyor-General for His Majesty,” who\r\ncalculated that the island comprised seven millions of acres, a map was\r\nprepared by Man and copied by “Mr. Innians, the surveyor,” and published\r\nin Blome’s “Description of the Island of Jamaica” in 1671. There are\r\nincluded on this map, in addition to two unnamed precincts occupying\r\napproximately the positions of the present Hanover and Manchester, the\r\nprecincts of St. Catherine, St. Andrew, Port Royal, St. David, St.\r\nThomas, St. George, St. Mary, St. John, St. Ann, St. James, St.\r\nElizabeth and Clarendon.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1673, Vere was formed by cutting off a portion of Clarendon,\r\nbut it still remained part of the precinct of Clarendon; and in 1675\r\nwhen an Act was passed for dividing His Majesty’s Island of Jamaica into\r\nseveral parishes and precincts, St. Thomas-in-the-Vale was taken from\r\nSt. Catherine; and Clarendon lost another piece out of which was formed\r\nSt. Dorothy, which parish became part of the precinct of St. Catherine.\r\n\r\nIn “The State of Jamaica under Sir Thomas Lynch, His Majesty’s present\r\nCaptain-General and Chief Governour, September 20th, 1683,” prefixed to\r\nthe “Laws of Jamaica” (London 1684), it states “since that time (1661)\r\nit has been divided into Fifteen Parishes and they into eight Provinces\r\nor Precincts.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMAICA\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first act on record having reference to the parishes of the island\r\nwas read on the 11th of May, 1675, by the Council, and sent to the\r\nAssembly with this amendment, that the Magotty be annexed to the\r\nsixteen-mile-walk, but continue still to pay all parochial duties to St.\r\nJohn’s except to the repairing of the highways, until a church be built\r\nand a parish settled in the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-Vale. A law was\r\npassed in 1677. The law itself had not been preserved, but it is recited\r\nin a law passed in 1681 (33 Car. 2), “An Act for the maintenance of\r\nMinisters and the Poor, and erecting and Repairing of churches.” (“The\r\nLaws of Jamaica,” London 1684): “and whereas this Island, in the\r\ntwenty-ninth year of His Majesty’s reign, by an Act of this Country, was\r\ndivided into fifteen parishes, which were called, distinguished and\r\nknown, by the several names hereafter mentioned, that is to say, _St.\r\nThomas_, _St. Davids_, _Port Royal_, _St. Andrews_, _St. Katherines_,\r\n_St. Dorothys_, _St. Thomas in the Valley_, _Clarendon_, _Vere_, _St.\r\nJohns_, _St. Georges_, _St. Maries_, _St. Anns_, _St. James_, and _St.\r\nElizabeths_; Be it therefore enacted and ordained by the Authority\r\naforesaid, That all and every of the said Parishes, rest, remain, and\r\nfor ever hereafter be distinguished and known by the aforesaid\r\nrespective Names, and by no other whatsoever, anything in this or any\r\nother Law to the contrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nIn 1692, on the destruction of the greater part of Port Royal by\r\nearthquake, most of the inhabitants that survived settled in hastily\r\nerected buildings in St. Andrew, on the harbour, and in the following\r\nyear the parish of Kingston was formed.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 Westmoreland was formed out of a portion of St. Elizabeth. In\r\n1723 Portland was formed, the land being taken partly from St.\r\nThomas-in-the-East, and partly from St. George (by 10 Geo. 1); and\r\nHanover was formed out of part of Westmoreland. In 1739 (12 Geo. 2, ch.\r\n6) parts of the Carpenters Mountains, heretofore esteemed part of St.\r\nElizabeth and Clarendon, were transferred to Vere.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 the three counties of Surrey, Middlesex and Cornwall were\r\ncreated (by 31 Geo. 2, ch. 15) with a view to the more convenient\r\nholding of courts of justice. The middle county was appropriately called\r\nMiddlesex; the westernmost was named after the most western county in\r\nEngland, Cornwall; and the eastern division was called Surrey, probably\r\nbecause, like Surrey in England, its principal town was Kingston.\r\n\r\nKingston was declared the county town of Surrey; St. Jago de la Vega,\r\nthat of Middlesex; and Savanna-la-Mar, that of Cornwall. In the\r\nfirst-named were the seven parishes of Port Royal, Kingston, St. Andrew,\r\nSt. David, Portland, St. George and St. Thomas-in-the-East; Middlesex\r\ncomprised St. Catherine, St. John, St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, St. Dorothy,\r\nClarendon, Vere, St. Ann, and St. Mary; while Cornwall had but four\r\nparishes, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James. The next\r\nchange was in 1770, when Trelawny was formed out of a portion of St.\r\nJames. In 1814 Manchester was created by taking parts from Clarendon,\r\nVere and St. Elizabeth, thus transferring a portion of Cornwall to\r\nMiddlesex.\r\n\r\nIn many old maps of the island, notably James Robertson’s (published in\r\n1804) the names of the owners are given rather than the names of\r\nproperties, and in many instances these proper names exist to this day;\r\nand to-day the negro peasantry are often able to tell one the name of\r\nthe owner when they are ignorant of the name of the estate or house.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 a law was passed (50 Geo. 3) for fixing the boundaries of the\r\nseveral counties and parishes of this island, by which the extent and\r\nboundaries of the counties and parishes as laid down and delineated in\r\nthe three maps of the counties and the general map of the island, made\r\nand published by Robertson, were taken as the bounds of the counties and\r\nparishes, and printed copies of the maps were recognized as evidence in\r\nall courts of justice in the island.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 McGeachy and Smith, surveyors, proposed to publish by\r\nsubscription maps of the three counties at £20 apiece. They received the\r\nnames of eighty-six subscribers, but the maps were never published, as\r\nwe learn by “St. Jago de la Vega Gazette” for February 12, 1831.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the last parish to be created in the history of Jamaica,\r\nMetcalfe, was formed out of the parishes of St. Mary and St. George,\r\nwhereby Middlesex again gained land, this time at the expense of Surrey.\r\nThe parishes then numbered twenty-two. In 1844 an Act (8 Vic. c. 39) was\r\npassed defining the boundaries of Kingston Harbour.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, as part of the reformation scheme of Sir John Peter Grant, was\r\npassed the law for the reduction of the number of parishes. In Surrey,\r\nKingston, was increased by taking part of St. Andrew, a part of the\r\nparish and the whole town of Port Royal. St. Andrew took the remaining\r\npart of Port Royal parish; and St. David was merged into St.\r\nThomas-in-the-East, and St. George into Portland, which also took the\r\nManchioneal district of St. Thomas-in-the-East.\r\n\r\nIn Middlesex the recently created parish of Metcalfe was merged into the\r\nparish of St. Mary. St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, St. John, and St. Dorothy\r\nwere all merged into St. Catherine, and Vere again became part of\r\nClarendon; St. Ann and Manchester remaining as they were. In Cornwall\r\nthere was no alteration, the five parishes remaining as they were.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Port Royal was made a separate parish for municipal purposes,\r\nremaining still part of the electoral district of Kingston.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf names given owing to natural features, there are numbers in\r\nJamaica—the Blue Mountains; the Red Hills; the Great, White, Swift, Dry,\r\nand Milk Rivers; Green Island; Dry Harbour; Dry Mountains; the Round\r\nHill (in Vere), and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Y. S. River (pronounced Wyers) is, Long tells us, so called from the\r\nGallic word Y. S., which signifies crooked or winding. Another authority\r\nsays the name of the property was Wyess, and its commercial mark for\r\nshipping purposes was Y. S.\r\n\r\nLabour-in-vain Savannah in St. Elizabeth is a name perfectly descriptive\r\nof its nature. So, too, is Burnt Savannah.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for and the success of emancipation have left their names\r\non many a free negro settlement; some of which, it is to be feared, have\r\nnot realized their early promise: Clarkson Ville, Sturge Town,\r\nWilberforce, Buxton, Liberty Hill and others.\r\n\r\nSome names are typical of the simple faith and language of the negro,\r\nsuch as Wait-a-bit and Come-see. Me-no-sen-you-no-come, in Trelawny,\r\nmust have been named by folk of recluse habits. Others are not\r\neuphonious—Fat Hog Quarter, Running Gut (which Lawrence Archer, in his\r\n“Monumental Inscriptions of the British West Indies,” thinks may\r\nprobably be a corruption by some seafaring man of _Harangutta_, a branch\r\nof the Ganges), Starve Gut Bay; and one rather wonders whether they are\r\nnot vulgar corruptions of different designations. We find, however,\r\nsimilar names in the other islands: _Dos d’Ane_ in Dominica, and _Mal\r\nd’Estomac_ in Trinidad. On the other hand _Kick-em-Jenny_, the rock\r\nbetween St. Vincent and Grenada, is said to have been originally called\r\n_Cay qu’on gêne_—the islet that bothers one, from the roughness of the\r\nneighbouring sea.\r\n\r\nMany names of townships and properties have been translated from the old\r\ncountry—Oxford, Ipswich, Cambridge, Newmarket and the like—and the\r\nnumber of Bellevues, Belvideres, Contents, speak little for the\r\ninventive faculties of those who named them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf its trade with the outside world Jamaica has evidences in Jamaica\r\nBay, in Acklin’s Island, Bahamas; in Jamaica (as old at least as 1699),\r\nLong Island; in Jamaica Plain near Boston; in Jamaica Street in Glasgow;\r\nin Jamaica Street in Greenock; and formerly in the Jamaica coffee house\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaica coffee house was in St. Michael’s Alley, Cornhill, which\r\nruns out of Cornhill to the west of St. Michael’s church. This alley is\r\nfamous as having contained the first coffee house established in London.\r\nThe Jamaica coffee house is kept in memory there by the Jamaica wine\r\nhouse which adjoins the office of a wine merchant (E. J. Rose & Co.) and\r\nby Jamaica buildings. Like all city alleys, the place has been entirely\r\nrebuilt.\r\n\r\nJamaica Street, one of the busiest streets in Glasgow, leading to\r\nJamaica Bridge over the Clyde, was named in 1763, and its name was\r\ndoubtless suggested by the business connexion. There are other evidences\r\nin Glasgow of West Indian trade in St. Vincent Street, Tobago Street,\r\nand the “Havannah” (Street); but the name of Kingston Dock has no\r\nconnection with Kingston, Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThere is a Jamaica Road in Bermondsey and a Jamaica Street in Shadwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n                               PORT ROYAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of Port Royal lies rather in the silent witness which\r\nthrough two and a half centuries she has borne to the naval activities\r\nof the island of Jamaica, and in a measure to those of the British\r\nfleets which have from time to time visited these waters, than in any\r\npart which she has played in the internal domestic development of the\r\ncolony, although she has now and again sent to the Assembly such notable\r\nmembers as William Beeston, Samuel Long, Marmaduke Freeman, Peter\r\nBeckford, Matthew Concanen, Roger Hope Elletson and Samuel Jackson\r\nDallas. The three last, however, were connected, not with “the Point,”\r\nbut with that portion of the old parish of Port Royal which now forms\r\npart of St. Andrew and is known to-day as the Port Royal Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn these days of pageants, Port Royal would fittingly make either\r\nbackground or proscenium to many a stirring episode illustrative of the\r\nisland’s history.\r\n\r\nThough Jamaica since its occupation by the English has escaped the\r\ncapture and recapture which was the fate of many of the smaller West\r\nIndian islands which are now British, and its forts have never had to\r\nface besieging ships, the vessels sent out from its harbour from that\r\ndate till the early years of the last century played no insignificant\r\npart in the sum total of Britannia’s naval history; and Port Royal was a\r\ntoll-gate on Britain’s path of Admiralty at which many heavy tolls were\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Swiftsure_, Admiral Penn’s flagship in the expedition which\r\ngained the island for England, to the _Suffolk_ and _Sydney_, many of\r\nthe finest ships in the British Navy have sailed or steamed past Port\r\nRoyal’s shores; and the flags of not a few of England’s most celebrated\r\nseamen have waved near its walls—Myngs, Morgan (who was buried there),\r\nNevell, Benbow (who died there), Vernon, Hosier, Ogle, Keppel, Rodney,\r\nPeter Parker, Nelson, Joshua Rowley, McClintock, and lastly Admiral\r\nLloyd.\r\n\r\nColumbus, who was intimately acquainted with the north side of Jamaica,\r\nprobably only saw Port Royal from the _Niña’s_ deck as he, after\r\ndiscovering the island on his second voyage, in 1494, beat slowly\r\nhomeward along the south side, after having exchanged courtesies with\r\nthe caciques in Old Harbour bay, putting in here and there for shelter\r\nfrom the contrary wind.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish occupation the Point remained unoccupied and the\r\nharbour of Kingston was disregarded till 1520, when the Spaniards\r\nremoved their northside capital to St. Jago de la Vega.\r\n\r\nIn January 1596–97, the inhabitants of Port Royal, had there been any,\r\nwould have seen that adventurous soldier of fortune, Sir Anthony\r\nShirley, sail up the harbour, whence he plundered the island and burnt\r\nSt. Jago; in March 1643, the buccaneering hero Captain William Jackson,\r\nwith his marauding company of three ships sent out from England by the\r\nEarl of Warwick, recruited at Barbados and St. Kitts, again insulted the\r\npowerless or supine Spaniards, passing Port Royal, which was then an\r\nisland; and in May 1655, the inhabitants fell an easy prey to a\r\nragamuffin army of 8000 troops contained in thirty-eight ships under\r\nPenn and Venables, who tried to atone thereby for their ineffectual\r\nattempt on Hispaniola. This was probably the largest fleet which up to\r\nthat moment had entered Kingston harbour.\r\n\r\nThe English conquerors soon saw the strategic advantage of Cagua (which\r\nthey corrupted into Cagway), or the Point, as they called it, as a\r\nprotection to the harbour and the capital at St. Jago de la Vega.\r\n\r\nThe earliest act of this motley crew, when they tired of killing the\r\ncattle which the Spaniards had been at great pains to breed on the\r\nsea-washed savannahs on the south side, was to erect a fort at Cagway\r\nunder Sedgwick in March 1656. At the Restoration it not unnaturally\r\nreceived the name of Fort Charles, and the collection of houses that\r\ngrew up around it was called Port Royal, at the dictates of loyalty or\r\nsycophancy, according to the political creed of the members of the new\r\ncolony. But the governor and council had often great difficulty in\r\npersuading the Assembly to vote the funds necessary for its upkeep and\r\nimprovement. A writer during Sir Charles Lyttelton’s governorship,\r\n1662–1664, says it was called Port Royal from the excellency of the\r\nharbour; but it was apparently not till February 1674 that that became\r\nits official name, when the Assembly voted “Point Conway (an obvious\r\nmisprint for Cagway) to be called Port Royal.” In addition to Fort\r\nCharles there were three other principal forts called James, Carlisle\r\nand Rupert.\r\n\r\nFor a time Port Royal was the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nwhile the Governor’s official residence was at Spanish Town. In November\r\n1661, it was ordered “that no person remain on Point Cagua without\r\ngiving security to a Justice of the Peace not to be chargeable to the\r\ninhabitants for more than one month. Any waterman bringing a person\r\nlikely to be chargeable to pay a piece of eight and carry him back\r\nagain.” In 1664 the Assembly desired and advised the Council that the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas should be held constantly “in St. Jago de la Vego\r\nand no more at Port Royal,” and the Council agreed. In March 1674–5\r\nPeter Beckford wrote home:\r\n\r\n  Lord Vaughan arrived on the 13th inst. at night and landed at Port\r\n  Royal; next day his commission was read, and he was entertained as\r\n  well as the island could afford; 15th, he remained on Port Royal,\r\n  viewing the fortifications; came next day to St. Jago, being received\r\n  at the seaside [at Passage Fort, probably] by 150 horse and a company\r\n  of foot, besides the gentlemen of the country and seven coaches, all\r\n  which attended him to the town, where he was received with two\r\n  companies of foot, and dined with Sir Thos. Modyford.\r\n\r\nBy 1675, residence by the Governor at Port Royal had gone out of favour.\r\nIn that year was passed a resolution to the effect that—the\r\n“Captain-General’s salary to be £2000 per annum, residing usually at St.\r\nJago, his residence at Port Royal to be omitted.”\r\n\r\nIn 1680, the custos of Port Royal was Sir Henry Morgan, J.P. The judges\r\nof court of common pleas were William Beeston, Reginald Wilson and\r\nAnthony Swimmer. The justices of the peace were, besides the judges,\r\nJohn White, Theodore Cary, Prichard Herne and Harbottle Wingfield.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Lynch wrote, in 1682, to the Bishop of London, of Beeston:\r\n“You may be disposed to credit him as Dr. Beeston’s brother, and a very\r\ningenious man, to whose skill and zeal we owe the building of our church\r\nat Port Royal, the handsomest in America....” This church, called\r\nChristchurch, perished in the earthquake. The present building, erected\r\nin 1725–26, contains monuments to many of those who succumbed to yellow\r\nfever. Its most notable monument is that to Lieutenant Stapleton (d.\r\n1754) by Roubiliac. Of the rest the most interesting is that to Captain\r\nde Crespigny (d. 1825), who had served under St. Vincent, Nelson and\r\nCollingwood, and during his career saved no less than sixteen lives. The\r\ncarved organ loft was erected in 1743.\r\n\r\nIn the Council minutes for June 1685, occurs the valuation of two\r\nparcels of land taken for the public use. One “contiguous to the breast\r\nwork” (probably identical with the “Redoute” in Lilly’s plan) was valued\r\nat £125.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1661 there were in Fort Charles “some as good cannon planted\r\nas the Tower of London would afford,” but it was not ever thus. The fort\r\nwas “not shook down, but much shattered” by the earthquake of 1692.\r\nSeven or eight years later it was reconstructed by Colonel Christian\r\nLilly, an engineer officer of considerable ability, who had laid out the\r\ntown of Kingston in 1694, and who, in 1734, was captain of the fort. He\r\nwas probably the author of “An Account of Commodore Wilmot’s Expedition\r\nto Hispaniola” of the year 1696, in which occurs a very caustic\r\ndescription of the “small fort” at Port Royal, which he regarded as\r\n\r\n  Of little significance in case of an attack. It is something like a\r\n  square redoubt of forty or fifty paces to a side with two small\r\n  bastions towards the town, but nothing towards the sea but a small\r\n  semi-circular advance in the middle of that side, capable of\r\n  containing three or four pieces of cannon. The walls are built after\r\n  the ancient way of fortifications and are not cannon-proof. The\r\n  embrasures are arched over, and so large as to be more like gates for\r\n  the enemy to enter at than port-holes. There is not so much as a\r\n  trench or palisade round it, and I believe not six pieces of cannon\r\n  that can bear at one time upon a ship when opposite to it. Outside\r\n  this fort, when I was there, there was a long line of cannon; but so\r\n  extremely exposed to the enemy’s fire that it would be hard matter for\r\n  any one to use them in case of an attack, and they are of no use at\r\n  all in case an enemy gets into the harbour, for they can then be taken\r\n  in reverse. This is the chief artificial fortification of Port Royal,\r\n  and the natural fortification is not much except that it is now an\r\n  island, for the town is all open to the harbour and partly to the sea.\r\n  In my opinion, therefore, there would be no difficulty for a small\r\n  fleet to master it, and less risk than in encountering two stout\r\n  men-of-war, were it not for our own ships in the harbour, as I can\r\n  explain if required. This place, being the bulwark and gate to the\r\n  conquest of the island, should be better secured. The side of the fort\r\n  towards the sea, already falling down, should be rebuilt in some\r\n  figure better suited for its defence, and the whole should be\r\n  surrounded by a good deep ditch and a row or two of strong palisades.\r\n  The embrasures should be lessened to two feet at most to protect the\r\n  gunners at their guns. The battery on the east side should be made\r\n  defencible and cannon-proof. The plot of land to north-west of the\r\n  fort should be taken into a horn-work and fitted for several guns, to\r\n  defend it against attack in reverse. To eastward of the town a work\r\n  should be thrown up to cover it against the isthmus, and to guard\r\n  against surprise by boats on that side. These fortifications could\r\n  also be built of earth and wood; which would save much expense and\r\n  would suffice if they lasted to the end of the war.\r\n\r\nThis account tallies with a description of Port Royal, dated October 25,\r\n1699, signed by Lilly himself.\r\n\r\nSir William Beeston, writing to the Council of Trade and Plantations in\r\nFebruary 1700, said—with all the self-sufficiency of one in authority:\r\n\r\n  The storehouses are finished and of great use, and so is Fort Charles\r\n  with all the advantage the ground will afford. Captain Lilly would\r\n  have had it built in another figure, but that was more to show his\r\n  desire it might be done by his directions than of any use, for, as he\r\n  proposed, there would have been much less room, and the spurs were not\r\n  capacious enough to contain any guns. I had the approbation of all\r\n  people in the figure I proposed, and it’s not only very useful but\r\n  very beautiful also. The next public work we go about is to lay a line\r\n  of thirty or forty guns in good stone work to the eastward of Fort\r\n  Charles, which guns will be right up the channel where all ships come\r\n  in, and make the place not easy to be attempted by sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the members of the House of Assembly, ever ready\r\nto insist on their rights, were admitted to view the forts and\r\nfortifications, and a joint committee of the Assembly and Council used\r\nto report annually on Fort Charles. After pointing out various defects\r\nfor thirty or forty years, the committee in 1736 got angry, and\r\ncomplained “that the present state and condition of the fortifications\r\nin Port Royal, which is very defenceless, require the immediate\r\nconsideration of the Legislature, as they are the strength and security\r\nof the island,” and that “little or no notice had been taken to remedy\r\nthe grievances complained of.”\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century there were thirty forts and\r\nbatteries in the island. At present there are but three worthy of the\r\nname—Fort Nugent at Harbour Head, Fort Clarence, opposite Port Royal,\r\nand Rocky Point, on the Palisadoes.\r\n\r\nAs the island became more settled under the British colonists, vessels\r\nwhich had at first been equipped for home defence began to assume the\r\nposition of private men-of-war, or privateers, and to bring into Port\r\nRoyal, sometimes with the warrant of the governor, sometimes without,\r\nspoils from the Spaniards. When it suited the home programme the local\r\nGovernor was praised for zeal in Imperial service. When the complaints\r\nof the Spanish court became too insistent, he was made a scapegoat and\r\nrecalled. But the habit of plundering the hated Spaniard had got into\r\nthe blood of men who were ill-fitted to lead a sedentary life, and the\r\nsteps from authorized privateersmen, first to unauthorized buccaneer,\r\nand then to pirate and murderer, were easy. And no close scrutiny was\r\nplaced upon the origin of the wealth poured into Port Royal, which its\r\nowners squandered in drinking and gaming as quickly as they had gained\r\nit. Port Royal was then the centre of much debauchery.\r\n\r\nModyford, the governor, wrote home, “The Spaniards wondered much at the\r\nsickness of our people, until they knew of the strength of their drinks,\r\nbut then they wondered more that they were not all dead.” The\r\nbuccaneers, another writer tells us, “have been known to spend 2000 or\r\n3000 pieces of eight in one night.”\r\n\r\nThe memory of the wild deeds done by those who put off from Port Royal’s\r\nshore is kept alive in the name of =Gallows Point=, where many notorious\r\npirates were, when condemned, hung up, and where the last of those\r\nexecutions, of which one is graphically described by Michael Scott in\r\n“Tom Cringle’s Log,” took place in 1831. Rackham, another pirate, was\r\nexecuted on the cay which still bears his name.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of Port Royal is given, in Francis\r\nHanson’s account of Jamaica, written in 1682, appended to the first\r\nprinted edition of the “Laws of Jamaica”:\r\n\r\n  The Town of Port Royal, being as it were the Store House or Treasury\r\n  of the West Indies, is always like a continual Mart or Fair, where all\r\n  sorts of choice Merchandizes are daily imported, not only to furnish\r\n  the Island, but vast quantities are thence again transported to supply\r\n  the Spaniards, Indians, and other Nations, who in exchange return us\r\n  bars and cakes of Gold, wedges and pigs of Silver, Pistoles, Pieces of\r\n  Eight and several other Coyns of both Mettles, with store of wrought\r\n  Plate, Jewels, rich Pearl Necklaces, and of Pearl unsorted or\r\n  undrill’d several Bushels; besides which, we are furnished with the\r\n  purest and most fine sorts of Dust Gold from Guiney, by the Negroe\r\n  Ships, who first come to Jamaica to deliver their Blacks, and there\r\n  usually refit and stay to reload three or four Months; in which time\r\n  (though the Companies Gold may be partly sent home) yet the Merchants,\r\n  Masters of Ships, and almost every Mariner (having private Cargoes)\r\n  take occasion to sell or exchange great quantities; some of which our\r\n  Goldsmiths there work up, who being yet but few grow very wealthy, for\r\n  almost every House hath a rich Cupboard of Plate, which they\r\n  carelessly expose, scarce shutting their doors in the night, being in\r\n  no apprehension of Thieves for want of receivers as aforesaid. And\r\n  whereas most other Plantations ever did and now do keep their accounts\r\n  in Sugar, or the proper Commodities of the place, for want of Money,\r\n  it is otherwise in Jamaica, for in Port-Royal there is more plenty of\r\n  running Cash (proportionably to the number of its inhabitants) than is\r\n  in London....\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest to bring lustre to the crown of Port Royal was\r\nAdmiral Myngs, by his capture in 1662 of St. Jago de Cuba, and other\r\nnaval exploits.\r\n\r\nThen came Sir Henry Morgan, the conqueror of Panama, whose deeds of\r\nundoubted valour were smirched by cowardly conduct towards priests and\r\ndefenceless women. In later life he turned respectable, even to the\r\nextent of persecuting his former comrades, when he acted as\r\nlieutenant-governor. But the old spirit died hard, and we are not\r\nsurprised when we read that the governor, Lord Vaughan, complained that\r\nMorgan made himself “so cheap at the port drinking and gaming at the\r\ntaverns” that he intended to remove thither himself, from Spanish Town,\r\nfor the credit of the island. In justice to Morgan’s memory it may be\r\nsaid that some historians hold that Oexmelin’s account of the buccaneers\r\nis a libel on Morgan, and that he was not nearly so black as he has been\r\npainted: and when we find his methods of warfare, and worse, adopted by\r\na nation that has hitherto claimed to be in the forefront of\r\ncivilization we are tempted to forgive Morgan much. As admiral of the\r\nJamaica fleet, Morgan at the time commanded twenty-eight English-built\r\nships and eight taken from the French—thirty-six in all, with a tonnage\r\nof 1585, the size of a small passenger steamer of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Council was sitting at Port Royal on June 7, 1692, when by the ever\r\nmemorable earthquake of that day many important colonists lost their\r\nlives. Houses, said to have been as good as many in the city of London,\r\nwere destroyed; and the part of the town bordering on the sea entirely\r\ndisappeared, owing to insecure foundations. A century later remains of\r\nthese houses were still visible. Lewis Galdy, a French immigrant, was\r\nswallowed and cast up again, and lived many years. He will be referred\r\nto in the chapter on St. Catherine. The mace brought out by Lord Windsor\r\nin 1662 (erroneously supposed to have been the bauble which Cromwell\r\nordered out of the House of Commons), was damaged at the time of the\r\nearthquake, and repaired after it; but it has since disappeared. The two\r\nmaces in the Institute of Jamaica are of later date.\r\n\r\nThe principal authorities usually quoted on the earthquake of 1692 are\r\nSir Hans Sloane’s account in the “Philosophical Transactions”; the\r\ndescription given by Long, in his History of Jamaica; and a letter by\r\nthe rector of the parish which appeared in the “Gentleman’s Magazine”\r\nfor 1750, and was reprinted by Bridges—all of which information was\r\nepitomized by Gardner in his history.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these is available a broadside in the British Museum, a\r\ncopy of which is in the Institute of Jamaica. The key and letter which\r\nform part of the broadside appeared in the “Journal of the Institute of\r\nJamaica,” in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe following accounts of the earthquake have also been printed in the\r\n“Journal of the Institute of Jamaica”:\r\n\r\n  (1) Sir Hans Sloane’s account consisting of (_a_) “An account ...\r\n  which I wrote myself being present in it.” (_b_) “Extract from a\r\n  letter from one in Jamaica who was in the terrible earthquake.” (_c_)\r\n  “Extract of a letter ... giving an account of the sickness that\r\n  followed the earthquake.” (_d_) “Part of a letter ... giving a further\r\n  account from another hand.” (_e_) “Part of another from the same\r\n  hand.” (_f_) “Part of a letter from a gentleman in Jamaica ... not\r\n  being present in the earthquake ... very curious.” (2) Notes by Mr.\r\n  Maxwell Hall on an article by Colonel A. B. Ellis in “Popular Science\r\n  Monthly” for 1892. (3) “A full account of the late dreadful earthquake\r\n  at Port Royal in Jamaica written in two letters from the minister of\r\n  the place [Dr. Heath],” which is copied incompletely and incorrectly\r\n  by Bridges. (4) An account by Mrs. Akers of Nevis, printed in a\r\n  “Natural History of Nevis ... by the Rev. Mr. Smith ... 1745.” (5)\r\n  “The Truest and Largest account of the earthquake in Jamaica ...\r\n  written by a Reverend Divine there to his friend in London ... 1693,”\r\n  a copy of which is in the West India Library in the Institute. The\r\n  letter is dated “Withy Wood in the parish of Vere,” and it is possible\r\n  that the “Reverend Divine” was Thomas Hardwicke, who was appointed\r\n  Rector of Vere by the Earl of Carlisle. (6) “A letter to a friend from\r\n  Jamaica, Spanish Town, the 29th of June, 1692,” by John Pike, printed\r\n  in a pamphlet, a copy of which is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThere were also two letters dated from Port Royal on June 20 and June\r\n28, 1692, given in “Earthquakes explained and Practically Improved ...\r\nby Thomas Doolittle, M.A., Jamaica’s Miseries show London Mercies ...\r\nLondon, 1693.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these there is a letter sent home by the Council to\r\nthe Lords of Plantations, which is given in an abbreviated form in the\r\n“Calendar of State Papers (Colonial Series)—America and West\r\nIndies—1689–1692.” The following is copied in extenso from the\r\nmanuscript Council minutes in the Colonial Secretary’s office, Jamaica,\r\na manuscript copy of which is in the Library of the Institute:\r\n\r\n  A letter from the President and Council of Jamaica to Lords of Trade\r\n  and Plantations of the date June 20 from on board the _Richard and\r\n  Sarah_, Jamaica. May it please Your Lordships on the seventh instant\r\n  it pleased God to afflict this whole island with an earthquake, the\r\n  dreadfullness whereof will sensibly enough appear in acquainting Your\r\n  Lordships that in the space of two minutes [the “Calendar of State\r\n  Papers” has ten] all the churches, the dwelling houses and sugar works\r\n  of the whole island were thrown down: two-thirds of Port Royal\r\n  swallowed up by sea, all its forts and fortifications demolished and a\r\n  great part of its inhabitants miserably either knockt o’th head or\r\n  drowned. As we are become by this an instance of God Almighty’s severe\r\n  judgment, so we hope we shall be of Your Lordships compassion. We have\r\n  in the midst of this confusion applied ourselves with all vigour to\r\n  the restoring of things. We have taken into Their Majesties’ service\r\n  the _Richard and Sarah_, a merchantship, where though to a great loss\r\n  in the neglect of our own private affairs, we sit _de die in diem_ in\r\n  Council; protecting the merchants in their fishing on the ruins of\r\n  their own houses; preventing robbery and stealing amongst the ruins;\r\n  deciding controversies and punishing quarrels too frequently arising\r\n  from the uncertain right of things. In sinking floating carcasses,\r\n  taking care of the sick and wounded; lastly, in feeding and sustaining\r\n  the necessitous which must now be done out of the Country stock, all\r\n  kinde of stores being lost in the ruin of Port Royall. We have sett\r\n  the masters of ships to the sounding a channell leading further up\r\n  into this harbour, where we are like to have a scituation equal to\r\n  Port Royall in everything and exceeding it in its being capable of\r\n  relieving the country or being on any invasion relieved by it. This\r\n  may it please Your Lordships we doe in all humble confidence hoping\r\n  Your Lordships will consider us as we are all open and exposed to the\r\n  attempts of enemyes by sea as well as by land. At land at this instant\r\n  we are contending against a party of French who have been for some\r\n  time ravageing the north side of the island, and though we have sent a\r\n  proportionable force against them both by sea and land, yet by reason\r\n  of the violent rains and earthquakes at land and blowing weather at\r\n  sea it has not pleased God as yet to make us able to give much account\r\n  of them as we still hope to doe. Among other accidents of the\r\n  earthquake, their Majesties ship the _Swan_, which was lying at the\r\n  wharves for careening, was suckt among the houses of Port Royall, has\r\n  lost her guns, rigging, cables, and anchors, and her keel damaged, and\r\n  is on survey cast, and we must inform Your Lordships that could\r\n  repeated persuasions or even threats have prevailed on Captain Nevill\r\n  to any degree of diligence, the _Swan_ had either been out of harbour\r\n  or rid out of danger. Many of the guns of the fortifications are two\r\n  fathoms under water, and are in danger of being lost. The small arms\r\n  of the country are generally broke by the fall of the houses, which\r\n  gives us apprehensions from the slaves. This being the true state of\r\n  our condition we must humbly beseech Your Lordships effectually to\r\n  intercede with their most gracious Majesties that we may have a\r\n  proportionable reliefe in time, and in all humility we think till we\r\n  shall be able to fortify it cannot be less than three fifth Rates with\r\n  one or two good fourth Rates for a battery, together with four or five\r\n  hundred land soldiers and all sorts of arms and ammunition (great shot\r\n  excepted), and that Your Lordships would procure us such a Governor\r\n  whose generous care and charity may be equall to the needs of this\r\n  distressed place, and we humbly take leave to inform Your Lordships\r\n  that a tollerable choice may be made from amongst ourselves till, by\r\n  the blessing of God and the just and equal administration of the\r\n  Government, it may again grow to be fitt reward for greater persons.\r\n  We humbly beg that this advice sloop may be speedily returned and the\r\n  master and men protected. All which is humbly submitted. We are, may\r\n  it please your honours, Your Lordships most humble servants, John\r\n  White, P.C., John Bourden, Peter Heywood, Samuell Bernard, John\r\n  Towers, Nicholas Laws, Francis Blackmore, Charles Knight, Thomas\r\n  Sutton.\r\n\r\n  Postscript—Since the foregoing their Majesties’ ship _Guernsey_ with\r\n  the sloop which we sent out against the French that had landed on the\r\n  north side of this island are come into port and have had good\r\n  success, having burnt the enemy’s ship and taken and destroyed all the\r\n  men both by land and sea, except eighteen which escaped in a sloop.\r\n\r\n  In all humility we are your Lordships most humble and obedient\r\n  servants.\r\n\r\n  Jamaica. From on board the _Richard and Sarah_, June the 20th, 1692.\r\n\r\nThe old bell in the Institute of Jamaica, is said to have been sunk\r\noriginally by the great earthquake, and to have been recovered during\r\nsome dredging operations off Port Royal. Tradition said that it was\r\ngiven to the old Spanish church at Port Royal, by a convent in Spain,\r\nbut this is obviously incorrect as the Spaniards had no church, or in\r\nfact, any building at the Point. It is, of course, possible that the\r\nearly English settlers took it from the ruins of some Spanish Town\r\nchurch, for use in the church they built at the Point, or it may have\r\nbeen taken to Port Royal at a later date. In any case it is curious that\r\nthe only Spanish bell known in Jamaica should have been discovered at\r\nPort Royal and not at Spanish Town or at St. Ann’s Bay, where the first\r\nSpanish settlement stood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SPANISH CHURCH BELL\r\n]\r\n\r\nEither in the ordinary course of events by the continual beating of the\r\nclapper, or through a flaw in the metal, or through its fall at the time\r\nof the earthquake or at some other time, the bell was cracked; but after\r\nits recovery the crack was stayed by a drill hole, and the bell is said\r\nto have been hung in the new church which had been built at Port Royal\r\nin 1725.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, as the crack had extended in two directions and rendered the\r\nbell useless, the “whitewash and plaster” churchwardens of the day sold\r\nit for old metal. During the administration of Sir John Peter Grant it\r\nwas pointed out to the Government that it was lying in an old curiosity\r\nshop in Kingston, in imminent danger of being melted down; and it was\r\npurchased by the Government and deposited at the Ordnance Wharf, whence\r\nit found its way to the Institute of Jamaica. It is 2 feet 1¾ inch in\r\nheight and 6 feet 7 inches in circumference at the base. Round the edge\r\nruns the following inscription:\r\n\r\n_Ihesv Maria et Verbum Caro Factum Est et Abita_.\r\n\r\nIn the Vulgate, the 14th verse of the 1st chapter of St. John’s Epistle\r\ncommences thus: “_Et Verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis_.”\r\n\r\nThe bell also bears a cross made of a series of stars, and two small\r\ndesigns in relief placed in duplicate on opposite sides, representing\r\nthe one the Virgin and Child, and the other, a saint, probably St.\r\nGeorge or St. Michael.\r\n\r\nThe bell, in the opinion of an expert to whom a photograph was sent, is\r\ncertainly Spanish; the cross and letter are from fifteenth-century\r\nmoulds, but the small designs are later, probably sixteenth century. In\r\ncasting, old moulds were frequently used. The cross is decidedly\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\nIn September 1692, the Council wrote home, “Port Royal which was our\r\nchief stay and where we could muster two thousand effective men is,\r\nsince the earthquake, reduced to about two hundred men.”\r\n\r\nThe old plan of Port Royal which was reproduced on page 442 of the “West\r\nIndia Committee Circular” of September 23, 1913, was formerly in the\r\nDockyard there, having been presented to that office by Commodore the\r\nHon. W. J. Ward, in August 1880. It was handed over to the Institute of\r\nJamaica by the last commodore after the dockyard was given up. It is\r\nobviously a copy of an older plan in the Colonial Secretary’s office. In\r\nmistake it is stated on it that the original plan was surveyed in June\r\n1857. It should have been 1827.\r\n\r\nThe wording on the original plan is as follows: “A general plan of the\r\ntown, forts and fortifications, etc., of Port Royal, performed by an\r\norder from His Grace William, Duke of Manchester, Captain-General and\r\nGovernor-in-Chief of His Majesty’s Island of Jamaica and the territories\r\nthereon depending in America, Chancellor and Vice-Admiral of the same.\r\nSurveyed in June 1827 by Philip A. Morris, Crown Surveyor.”\r\n\r\nOn the original plan are the following notes: “All within the yellow\r\nlines is Crown property.” “The blue lines represent the town of Port\r\nRoyal before the great earthquake of 1692.” “The red line is what\r\nremained of the town after the earthquake.” “The ochre colouring\r\nrepresents the town as it now stands.” “True copy from Morris, original\r\nSurvey. The blue, red and yellow lines added by me.” (Signed) Thos.\r\nHarrison, Govt. Surveyor, 20th September, 1870; (Signed) J. R. Mann, D.\r\nof Rds. and Surveyor-General, 24th October, 1870.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting experience of a diver during his visit to\r\nsubmerged Port Royal, appeared in the “Falmouth Post,” of October 7,\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n  SIR,—Being aware that many erroneous statements regarding my\r\n  explorations of old Port Royal have been circulated, I beg to offer\r\n  the public, through the medium of your valuable journal, the following\r\n  statement, should you deem it worthy a place in your columns.\r\n\r\n  I first went down on the remains of the old Port Royal on the 29th\r\n  August, and found that what I had heard with regard to some of the\r\n  buildings being seen when the water was clear was correct. I landed\r\n  among the remains of ten or more houses, the walls of which were from\r\n  3 to 10 feet above the sand. The day was rather cloudy and I could\r\n  only get a view of a small portion at a time.\r\n\r\n  After repairing H.M. Ship _Valorous_, I went down again on the 9th\r\n  instant, at what is called at Port Royal, “The Church Buoy,” but which\r\n  ought to be called the “Fort Buoy,” it being placed on the remains of\r\n  old Fort James; but the day was unfavourable, the water being muddy—so\r\n  that I could not see much; and being impressed with the idea that it\r\n  must have been the remains of the church on which I was, my\r\n  explorations that day were not satisfactory. About 12 o’clock (being\r\n  then down four hours) the water cleared a little, and getting a better\r\n  view I concluded that the ruins which I was on must have been those of\r\n  a fort. But soon after I found a large granite stone somewhat the\r\n  shape and size of a tombstone, which was covered with a coral\r\n  formation, so that I could not tell whether it had an inscription or\r\n  not. Fancying this stone to have been a tombstone, thereby indicating\r\n  the vicinity of a churchyard, I was not satisfied what the character\r\n  of the building could have been. I came to the surface about 1 o’clock\r\n  determined to wait a more favourable day. In the meantime Mr. de Pass\r\n  was so good as to obtain for me, from the collection of Henry\r\n  Hutchings, Esq., a map of the old town as it stood before the\r\n  earthquake, by which I learnt that the ruins, of the nature of which I\r\n  had all along my doubts, were in fact the ruins of old Fort James, and\r\n  that the Church stood about the east end of the present dockyard.\r\n\r\n  Monday, the 19th instant, being a very clear day, I went down about 2\r\n  o’clock, and had a very good view of the Fort. At times I could see\r\n  objects 100 feet each away from me. The Fort forms an obtuse angle to\r\n  the west, on a line with the north end of the hospital—the wall of the\r\n  angle runs in a N.E. direction, the other in a S.S.E. The walls are\r\n  built of brick, and are as solid as so much rock. I have traced and\r\n  examined several of the embrasures and have no doubt but that the guns\r\n  in them are covered with coral; that known as “brain stone,” being\r\n  large and numerous on the fort. After being down about two hours, I\r\n  found an iron gun in one of the embrasures almost covered in the\r\n  ruins, with a heavy copper chain to the breech. After sending up the\r\n  gun next day, I found the end of another chain not far from where the\r\n  gun lay. On heaving it out of the sand and mud, I found it was\r\n  attached to a granite stone similar to the one I had seen before. I\r\n  have no doubt these stones were part of the embrasures and that the\r\n  copper chains were used for slinging the guns. The gun which I found\r\n  had no trunnions to it, and therefore could not have been used on a\r\n  carriage.\r\n\r\n  I am of opinion, from what I have seen of old Port Royal, that many of\r\n  the houses remained perfect after the earthquake, though sunk in the\r\n  water, and that the sand has been thrown up, and the mud settled\r\n  around and in them from time to time, until all the largest buildings\r\n  are covered over, so that the remains of the houses which I have seen\r\n  may have been the top part of the highest buildings; which is\r\n  apparently the case from the irregularity of the heights.\r\n\r\n  I intend paying another visit to the ill-fated town, in a week or two;\r\n  and I will take the first opportunity of informing you, and through\r\n  you the public, of anything new that may come to my notice.\r\n\r\n                                      I remain, Sir, &c.,\r\n                                              (Sgd.) JEREMIAH D. MURPHY.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know what became of the gun referred to.\r\n\r\nPort Royal as a town, never recovered from the effects of the earthquake\r\nof June 17, 1692.\r\n\r\nShortly after, the town of Kingston rose on the mainland across the\r\nharbour, and thither much of the wealth of Port Royal went, and the\r\nprincipal commercial and shipping street was not unnaturally called Port\r\nRoyal Street.\r\n\r\nIn August 1702, brave old Benbow sailed into Port Royal after his fight\r\nwith Du Casse off Santa Marta, extending over five days (a fight which,\r\nthanks to his cowardly captains, was one of the darkest blots on\r\nBritannia’s shield) only to die here of his wounds two months later....\r\nHe was buried in Kingston parish church.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 arrived from Massachusetts one good foot company of volunteers,\r\n“the first men in armes that ever went out of this Province, or from the\r\nShoar of America”: they were intended for a further expedition.\r\n\r\nIn January 1703–04, a fire destroyed that part of Port Royal which the\r\nearthquake had spared. The occurrence is thus described by Christian\r\nLilly: “Between 11 and 12 of the clock in the morning a fire hapn’d thro\r\ncarelessness to break out in a warehouse at Port Royall which before\r\nnight consumed all ye Town, and left not one house of it standing, by\r\nwhich meanes a great many people, especially merchants are ruin’d. For\r\nthis Town being scituated upon a small Cay, now, of about Thirty Acres\r\nof Land surrounded with the sea, and the whole place taken up with\r\nhouses and the streets and lanes extreamly narrow, the poor people had\r\nnot that conveniency of saving their goods as might have been expected\r\nin a place where they might have been more at large.”\r\n\r\nIn 1708, Admiral Sir Charles Wager, commander-in-chief of Jamaica, met\r\nand conquered a Spanish treasure ship, and though, owing to the\r\ncowardice of two of his captains, much of the treasure (said to have\r\nbeen worth from four to ten millions) was lost, Wager became a wealthy\r\nman. During his command (1707–9), a greater number of prizes were taken\r\nthan at any former period of like duration.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1692–93, Beeston, in writing home, had said: “But there is\r\nlittle of Port Royal left, being now a perfect island of about\r\ntwenty-five acres and too small to hold the trade and people.” After the\r\nfire a bill was passed in the Assembly to prevent the re-settling of the\r\ntown, but this was warmly opposed and in October 1703 another bill was\r\npassed entitled “an Act for making the Key, whereon Fort Charles and\r\nFort William are erected, a port of entry”; and in a letter written from\r\nJamaica in 1712, Port Royal is referred to as a “small island about\r\nfourteen miles from Spanish Town”: In 1716, William Wood, in his preface\r\nto “The Laws of Jamaica” says, “The Town of Port Royal, formerly much\r\nlarger and very populous, is built on a key, which before the great\r\nearthquake, joyned to an Isthmus of Land that divides the sea and the\r\nHarbour of Kingston,” and there is additional evidence that, at various\r\nstages in the history of the Palisadoes, channels were formed by the sea\r\nacross what is, after all, nothing but a string of islands more or less\r\nclosely connected by drifted sand and stone. And an engraving, in Long’s\r\nHistory, as late as 1774, shows it as an island.\r\n\r\nA manuscript chart, in the Institute of Jamaica, entitled “A plan of the\r\nHarbour of Port Royal in Jamaica, survey’d in the year 1724, and\r\ncarefully examin’d in the year 1728, by Capt. John Gascoigne,” tells of\r\nthe severe shocks which the town and harbour have received within\r\nhistoric times. As we see by the map, the hurricane of 1722 once more\r\ncut it off from the isthmus to which it is now connected, if, indeed,\r\nthe passage existing ten years before had silted up.\r\n\r\nProfessor Robert T. Hill, in “The Geology and Physical Geography of\r\nJamaica,” writes:\r\n\r\n  The Kingston formation is the oldest of the formations of old gravel\r\n  and other alluvium occurring upon the plains of the Liguanea type.\r\n  This is the formation upon which the city of Kingston and suburbs are\r\n  built, including the strip of land known as the Palisades, and the\r\n  plain extending back of Kingston to the foot of the mountains. The\r\n  material consists of boulders, gravel, and pebble of varying sizes,\r\n  usually very angular, and representing every known material of the\r\n  Blue Mountain series. These are embedded in a matrix of dull red\r\n  arenaceous clay, producing a chocolate soil and derived from the Minho\r\n  beds so completely exposed _in situ_ in the mountains north of\r\n  Kingston.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the chart, Mr. Charlton Thompson, R.N., the harbour\r\nmaster, wrote in 1907 as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I have always been of opinion that the Palisadoes were originally\r\n  coral cays joined gradually by sand-spits. To my knowledge of Port\r\n  Royal Point (thirty-one years), I am sure it had grown out about 50\r\n  feet during that time, which portion sank during the last earthquake;\r\n  and the depressions or subsidences which took place then were all\r\n  made-up land. There were also subsidences in the Palisadoes.”\r\n\r\nThe following account of the hurricane of 1722 above referred to is from\r\n“A Voyage to Guinea, Brasil, and the West Indies; in His Majesty’s ships\r\nthe _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_” by John Atkins, a naval surgeon (2nd\r\nedition, London, 1737).\r\n\r\n  The present hurricane was a week after our arrival; began at eight in\r\n  the morning, two days before the change of the moon, gave at least\r\n  forty-eight hours notice, by a noisy breaking of the waves upon the\r\n  kays, very disproportioned to the breeze, a continued swell, without\r\n  reflux of the water; and the two nights preceding, prodigious\r\n  lightnings and thunder; which all the old experienced men foretold\r\n  would be a hurricane; or that one already had happened at no great\r\n  distance. I was ashore at _Port Royal_ and found all the pilots\r\n  returned from the windward part of the island, (where they customarily\r\n  attend the coming down of ships,) and observing upon the unusual\r\n  intumescence of the water, so great the day before, and beat so high,\r\n  that our boats could not possibly put on shore at _Gun Kay_ to take\r\n  the men off that were set there, to the number of twenty, for trimming\r\n  up our cask; themselves making signals not to attempt it. Betimes next\r\n  morning, the wind began in flurrys at N.E. and flew quickly round to\r\n  S.E. and S.S.E. where it continued the stress of the storm, bringing\r\n  such quantities of water, that our little island was overflowed 4 foot\r\n  at least; so that what with the fierce driving of shingles (wooden\r\n  staves used instead of tiling upon their houses) about our ears, and\r\n  the water floating their boats, empty hogheads, and lumber about the\r\n  streets, those without doors were every moment in danger of being\r\n  knocked on the head, or carried away by the stream. Within it was\r\n  worse, for the waters sapping the foundations, gave continual and just\r\n  apprehensions of the houses falling, as in effect half of them did,\r\n  and buried their inhabitants! Nor indeed after the storm had began,\r\n  was it safe to open a door, especially such as faced the wind, lest it\r\n  should carry the roofs off; and escaping thence, there was no place of\r\n  retreat, we remaining in a very melancholly scituation, both from wind\r\n  and water. _The perils of false brethren was nothing to it._ It may be\r\n  worth notice, what became of the purser in this common danger; I was\r\n  regardless at first, as suspecting more of timidity in the people,\r\n  till finding myself left alone proprietor of a shaking old house, the\r\n  streets full of water and drift, with shingles flying about like\r\n  arrows; I began to meditate a little more seriously upon my safety,\r\n  and would have compounded all my _credit_ in the victualling, my\r\n  hoops, and bags, for one acre (as _Gonzalo_ says in the _Tempest_) _of\r\n  barren ground, long heath, or brown furze_, to have trod dry upon. Our\r\n  neighbours had retreated towards the church, as the strongest\r\n  building, and highest ground, which I was luckily too late to recover;\r\n  but endeavouring to stem upwards for a safer station, was taken into a\r\n  house in the lower street, with an old woman wading in the same manner\r\n  from her ruined habitation. We were no sooner in, but new fears of\r\n  this also falling, thrust us into the yard (the water then at eleven\r\n  o’clock, breast high) where we helped one another upon a low\r\n  brick-built outhouse, that being more out of the wind, and surrounded\r\n  with others, kept the water still. The unhappiness of those who\r\n  suffered in stronger, was their facing the wind, which brought the sea\r\n  upon them with violence. A platform of one and twenty guns and mortars\r\n  were drove some of them to the market-place; the two lines of houses\r\n  next the sea, with the church, was undermined and levelled with the\r\n  torrent, and in their ruin was our safety; for altho’ we had a greater\r\n  depth, they were by such a bank made motionless. The whole rise of the\r\n  water was computed at 16 or 18 foot, very admirable at a place where\r\n  it is not ordinarily observed to flow above one or two. At 5 in the\r\n  evening the waters abated, and with so quick a retreat as to leave the\r\n  streets dry before 6; when every one was congratulating his own safety\r\n  in condolancies upon the loss of their friends. Of 50 sail in this\r\n  harbour, only four men-of-war and 2 merchant ships rid it out, but\r\n  with all their masts and booms blown away. All the men we left at _Gun\r\n  Kay_ were washed off and perished, except one _Indian_ that drove into\r\n  harbour upon a broken gallows that had been there erected. Wrecks and\r\n  drowned men were everywhere seen along shore; general complaints of\r\n  loss at land (least at _St. Jago_) which made it a melancholy scene,\r\n  and to finish the misfortune, the slackness of the sea-breezes, calms,\r\n  and lightning, stagnating waters, broods of insects thence, and a\r\n  shock or two of earthquake that succeeded to the hurricane, combined\r\n  to spread a baneful influence, and brought on a contagious distemper,\r\n  fatal for some months through the island. There being no volcanos, the\r\n  earthquakes felt here are always after great rains, on a parched earth\r\n  that admits their penetration; and possibly nigher the coast, as at\r\n  _Port Royal_, may be from the sea in a long process of time\r\n  undermining in some manner a loose earth, or finding in its deep\r\n  recesses new caverns; or subterranean heats working towards them, the\r\n  dreadful contest shocks.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane occurred on the tenth anniversary of one that visited\r\nJamaica on August 28, 1712. In it about four hundred persons perished,\r\nand August 28 was appointed by the House of Assembly as a “perpetual\r\nanniversary fast.”\r\n\r\nAt this time it was “ordered that all masters of sloops and vessels\r\nemployed as sugar-drogers in and about this island, shall before they\r\nare permitted to pass His Majesty’s fort at Port Royal, be obliged to\r\nbring one load of stones each, in order to repair the damages done to\r\nthe fortifications by the late hurricane.” The Marquis Duquesne got into\r\ntrouble with the assembly owing to the manner in which he enforced the\r\norder, and generally in his duties as captain of the fort, and had to\r\nvindicate his position, in “The Marquis Duquesne vindicated in a letter\r\nto a noble lord,” published in 1728.\r\n\r\nIn a petition presented by the garrison of Fort Charles to a committee\r\nof the Assembly that was inspecting the fort in September 1725, the\r\nfollowing representations occur:\r\n\r\n  That abundance of us from time to time have been swept away into our\r\n  graves; besides several of us, by reson of divers sorts of lingering\r\n  distempers, are rendered incapable of doing further service:\r\n\r\n  “... You are sensible, sirs, our beds are the hard stones, our\r\n  covering nothing but the expanded canopy of the heavens! This\r\n  certainly is very grievous, especially when we see the company at\r\n  Spanish-Town lie in beds, and having barracks fit for men of their\r\n  function. Are they more loyal subjects, or more dutiful soldiers, than\r\n  we are? Be it far from us to reflect on them or their happiness! but\r\n  with sorrow and regret we behold our own misfortunes.\r\n\r\nIn 1733 Fort Charles was considered not sufficient protection to\r\nKingston Harbour and a fort at Mosquito Point was suggested; this was\r\nthe origin of Fort Augusta.\r\n\r\nIn 1734 was passed an act to vest Lands in Port Royal in His Majesty,\r\nHis Heirs and Successors for the use of His ships of war. The property\r\nconsisted of “Lands, tenements, hereditaments or shoal water.” The act,\r\nin the edition of 1738, is accompanied by a plan of land proposed to be\r\nacquired to the north-east of Port Royal. From this it appears that\r\nthere was at the time a town wall on the sea front.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the eighteenth century smuggling was prevalent in\r\nthe British colonies, and subject to violent repression on the part of\r\nSpain. The well-known case in 1731 of Robert Jenkins, master of the brig\r\n_Rebecca_, who lost his ear on his way from Jamaica to London was not\r\nunique. Rear-Admiral Stewart, who then commanded on the Jamaica station,\r\nsaw that the fault lay largely with the Jamaica merchants, but the\r\nEnglish merchants made their wrongs felt in the House of Parliament, and\r\nVernon was amongst their warmest supporters. He pleaded for the\r\ndestruction of Porto Bello (where the Spanish guardacostas fitted out),\r\nand offered to effect it with six ships; which he did to his own renown\r\nand the gratification of the English nation in general and the Jamaica\r\nmerchants in particular. While in command on the Jamaica station, Vernon\r\nissued an order, which was quickly adopted by the Admiralty, and made\r\nmarked improvement in the discipline and efficiency of the British navy,\r\nand enriched the English language with the word grog. The order was to\r\nthe effect that the sailors should qualify their rum with water—a quart\r\nof water to half a pint of rum. The sailors did not like their “grog,”\r\nas they nicknamed the new drink, adopting the nickname of Vernon,\r\nderived, it is said, from his using a grogram boat cloak.\r\n\r\nWriting about 1740, Leslie, in his “New and Exact Account of Jamaica,”\r\nsays:—“Port Royal was once the fairest seaport in America, it flowed in\r\nRiches and Trade, now it is only a small place, but yet it consists of\r\nthree handsome streets, several cross lanes and a fine Church. They have\r\na Hospital for sick or disabled Sailors, and there is lately built a\r\nYard for the King’s Naval Stores and conveniency of Workmen employed\r\nabout His Majesty’s Ships of War.”\r\n\r\nAlthough doubt had been expressed as to the wisdom of appointing Port\r\nRoyal as a rendezvous, “for fear of the soldiers staying too long there,\r\nand getting sickness, by drinking too much rum, as has usually been the\r\ncase,” on January 17, 1740–41, by far the largest force that ever\r\nassembled in Jamaica waters was gathered together. On that day\r\ntwenty-four ships of the line under Sir Chaloner Ogle, with nine\r\nthousand soldiers under Brigadier Wentworth, reached Port Royal as a\r\nreinforcement for Vernon’s fleet. The attempt on Cartagena was a\r\nmiserable failure, owing to divided command, lack of ability on\r\nWentworth’s part, disease caused by the rainy season, and general\r\nmismanagement, which was exposed by Smollett, the novelist, who was\r\nsurgeon’s mate on one of Ogle’s vessels. He married a Jamaica lady (the\r\noriginal of Narcissa in “Roderick Random”) and lived for a time in\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\nIll-feeling also between Vernon and Wentworth was responsible for the\r\nlack of success which attended the attack on St. Jago de Cuba.\r\n\r\nDuring a storm in 1744 the larger part of the fleet was luckily at sea\r\nunder Sir Chaloner Ogle, but there were in the harbour nine men-of-war\r\nand ninety-six merchant-ships. One hundred and four were stranded,\r\nwrecked or foundered, so that only the _Rippon_ rode it out with the\r\nloss of her masts. A great number of marines perished.\r\n\r\nWe learn from a petition from the inhabitants of Port Royal to the\r\nAssembly, in October 1751, that during the hurricane of that year, the\r\nsea “by forcing up the sand to a level with the wall, has rendered it\r\nquite unserviceable, as it gained, by that means, a free and easy\r\npassage into the town, and filled the greatest part of it with such a\r\nquantity of water, that many of the inhabitants, in the extremity of the\r\nweather, were obliged to abandon their houses, and fly for shelter to\r\nplaces of greater safety.” It then appeared that the law of 1717\r\narranging for the repairing of the wall had been a dead letter since\r\n1737.\r\n\r\nWhen Rodney assumed command in 1771, he found that apartments only were\r\nprovided for the admiral at Port Royal, and it was doubtless due to his\r\naction that “Admiral’s Pen” near Kingston (the present poor-house), was\r\npurchased just before he left in 1774. One of the chief objects to which\r\nhe devoted his attention while on this station was the watering of the\r\nfleet—the water having hitherto been purchased by the naval authorities;\r\nand he, after investigation at Kingston and the Rio Cobre, decided on\r\nRock Fort, Vernon’s old spot, at =Harbour Head= as a source of supply.\r\nThe sailors, when they found themselves spared the task of rolling heavy\r\nwater casks long distances in the hot sun, said “God bless the Admiral,”\r\nbut when they realized that improved methods of watering meant shorter\r\nleave on shore, they changed their tune and said, “The devil take the\r\nAdmiral.”\r\n\r\nTill about the year 1902, when pipes were laid along the Palisadoes to\r\nPort Royal, that town had its water conveyed to it, from Rodney’s source\r\nat Rock Fort, in a sailing ship fitted for the purpose.\r\n\r\nRodney, in order to get timely notice of the approach of foreign ships,\r\nhad a look-out erected on the top of the Healthshire Hills on the\r\nopposite side of the harbour from Port Royal; and on the site of\r\n=Rodney’s Look-out= there is still a mark for navigation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that during the voyage which Nelson made to the West\r\nIndies in 1771–72 in a merchant ship he visited Jamaica, as the ship\r\nbelonged to a Jamaica firm; but no such visit has been recorded.\r\n\r\nOn September 19, 1771, Rodney wrote from Port Royal:\r\n\r\n  Since my letter to their Lordships [of the Admiralty] of the 4th\r\n  instant, giving their Lordships an account of the violent earthquake\r\n  which happened the day before, which has been attended with frequent\r\n  shocks till within these few days and, in the opinion of the\r\n  inhabitants, done more damage than any since the great one in 1692,\r\n  particularly in the towns of Port Royal and Kingston, in the former of\r\n  which there is not a single house that has not been damaged, I find\r\n  His Majesty’s dockyard has suffered considerably. The pitch-house is\r\n  split up the middle of the arch, the chimney thrown down, the coppers\r\n  and chimney where the people cook while at the wharf are rendered\r\n  useless; the smith’s shop split in several places, and so shaken as to\r\n  be quite unserviceable. The foundations of the capstern and\r\n  mast-houses have likewise received much damage.\r\n\r\n  His Majesty’s hospital at Port Royal seems to have suffered more than\r\n  any other building, the chimneys shaken down, the walls shattered; the\r\n  partition walls and gable end of the northern wing, and a southern\r\n  wall next the dispensary greatly damaged.\r\n\r\n  As the sick men were very much alarmed, and really in danger, I found\r\n  it necessary to order the surgeon and agent to repair it with all\r\n  possible despatch. There have been nine shocks since the first, but as\r\n  each has appeared weaker, I hope we shall experience no more of them.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant period of Port Royal’s glory was perhaps the command\r\nof Sir Peter Parker, from 1778–1782.\r\n\r\nOf all the forts which have been erected from time to time round the\r\ncoast of Jamaica for its protection the oldest, and most important from\r\nan historic standpoint, is undoubtedly =Fort Charles= at Port Royal. It\r\nwas not the first fort built at The Point, for Sedgwick writing home in\r\nNovember 1655, to the Commissioners of the Admiralty, said, “Are\r\nbuilding a fort at the harbour’s mouth, and 9 or 10 guns are mounted.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Nelson’s Quarter-deck\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe construction of Fort Charles, named after Charles II, was commenced\r\nin the reign of that monarch. When originally built it was washed by the\r\nsea on two sides. In course of time Chocalatta Hole became silted up,\r\nand is now the parade-ground. It is thus referred to in a “Journal Kept\r\nby Colonel William Beeston from his first coming to Jamaica,” in\r\nconnection with a fear that the Spaniards, enraged by the loss of St.\r\nJago de Cuba, might meditate revenge, and make some attempt on the\r\nisland:\r\n\r\n“Therefore what money was due to the King was called in, and in November\r\n[1662] about forty men hired to work on the fort, which is now called\r\nFort Charles, with intent to finish it, which hitherto lay open, with\r\nonly a round tour of stone and banks of board and sand towards the\r\nsea....”\r\n\r\nAnd on May 29, 1678, he writes: “Being the King’s birthday, and all the\r\nflags abroad upon all the forts, the great flag of Fort Charles blew\r\ndown, which we doubted was ominous, being so noted a day and on the most\r\nnoted Fort....”\r\n\r\nThe fort was “not shook down, but much shattered” by the earthquake of\r\n1692. It was subsequently reconstructed in 1699 by Colonel Christian\r\nLilley, who had laid out the city of Kingston four years earlier, and\r\nwho in 1734 was captain of the fort.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the members of the House of Assembly were\r\nadmitted to view the forts and fortifications, and a joint committee of\r\nthe Assembly and Council used to report annually on Fort Charles.\r\n\r\nLong, writing in 1774, says: “The Captain of the fort [Fort Charles] has\r\nof late years been appointed by the Governor’s warrant, upon the\r\nnomination of his Ministry. His salary is only £109 10_s._ per annum,\r\nbut the profits of this post make it far more considerable.”\r\n\r\nIn June 1779, war was declared with Spain, and on the 11th of that month\r\nNelson was promoted to the command of the _Hinchinbrook_, thus becoming\r\na post-captain while yet four months under twenty-one years of age. The\r\nship was then at sea, and had not returned by July 28, when Nelson wrote\r\nfrom Port Royal to his friend Captain Locker, and she apparently did not\r\nreturn till September 1. During this period Nelson was in command of the\r\nbatteries at Port Charles, as he twice mentions in his published\r\ncorrespondence—once when writing under date August 12, 1779, to Locker,\r\nand once in the “Sketch of My Life,” written twenty years later. At this\r\ntime Jamaica was, to use Nelson’s own words, “turned upside down” by\r\nfear of capture of a French fleet. In his own letter to Locker he says,\r\nspeaking of the measures of defence taken:\r\n\r\n  Five thousand men were encamped between the Ferry and Kingston, 1000\r\n  at Fort Augusta, 300 at the Apostles’ Battery, and we expect to have\r\n  500 in Fort Charles, where I am to command. _Lion_, _Salisbury_,\r\n  _Charon_, and _Janus_ in a line from the Point to the outer shoal;\r\n  _Ruby_ and _Bristol_ in the narrows going to Kingston, to rake any\r\n  ships that may attack Fort Augusta; _Pomona_ and _Speke_ Indiaman\r\n  above Rock Fort, and _Lowestoffe_ at the end of the dock wall.... I\r\n  have fairly stated our situation, and I leave you in England to judge\r\n  what stand we shall make; I think you must not be surprised to hear of\r\n  my learning to speak French.\r\n\r\nIn his sketch of his life, Nelson tells us:\r\n\r\n  In this critical state [_i.e._ fear of invasion] I was by both Admiral\r\n  and General entrusted with the command of the Batteries at Port Royal,\r\n  and I need not say, as the defence of this place was the key to the\r\n  port of the whole naval force, the town of Kingston, and Spanish Town,\r\n  it was the most important place in the whole island.\r\n\r\nThe admiral was Sir Peter Parker, Nelson’s lifelong friend and patron;\r\nthe general was the Governor, Dalling.\r\n\r\nThis was Nelson’s first actual command after he was posted, though it\r\nlasted probably but three or four weeks, and gave him no opportunity of\r\nshowing what he could do in that capacity.\r\n\r\nNelson’s reputation still survives in Port Charles itself, and there\r\nstill exists his wooden “quarter-deck” from which he could, while pacing\r\nup and down, command a view to windward.\r\n\r\nThere is also an inscription to his memory in gilt letters on a white\r\nmarble tablet fixed into the brickwork of the west wall of Port Charles.\r\nIn size the tablet is 2½ feet by 1½ feet, and the following is a copy of\r\nthe inscription:\r\n\r\n                             IN THIS PLACE\r\n                                 DWELT\r\n                            HORATIO NELSON.\r\n\r\n                      You who tread his footprints\r\n                          Remember his glory.\r\n\r\nNelson’s memory was kept green in Jamaica for many years. Monk Lewis\r\nsaw, at Black River, at New Year, 1816, a “Nelson’s Car” with\r\n“Trafalgar” written on it, which formed part of the procession of Blue\r\nGirls in the John Canoe festivities. But there is no monument to the\r\ngreat hero in Jamaica as there is at Barbados; and yet the larger island\r\nowes just as much to Nelson as does the smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KINGSTON HARBOUR IN 1774\r\n\r\n  From an engraving in Long’s “History of Jamaica”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Figure-head of the Aboukir\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following, amongst others, commanded at Fort Charles: Major Man\r\n(1661–64), Major Byndloss (1664–65), Sir James Modyford (1667), Col.\r\nTheodore Cary (1675), Col. Charles Morgan (1682), Col. Molesworth\r\n(1683), Col. James O’Brien (1691–92), Peter Beckford (1692), Col. Knight\r\n(1703), Major Howard (1713), Col. Joseph Delawnay (1715), Gabriel,\r\nMarquis Duquesne (1723–25), Captain Dalrymple (1730–33), Col. Christian\r\nLilly (1733–35), Captain Charles Knowles (1734), Col. Philips (1737),\r\nCaptain Newton (1742), Captain Hamilton (1743), Lieut.-Col. Spragge\r\n(1753), Captain Trower (1762), Exelbee Lawford (1776), John Dalling\r\n(1776–77), Horatio Nelson (1777), Edward FitzGerald (1777–79),\r\nMontgomery Mathan (1779–80), Hans Carsden (1780).\r\n\r\nA portrait bust in wood, which formed the figurehead of the _Aboukir_,\r\nport guardship from 1862 to 1877, and now rests in the dockyard\r\n(alongside the figureheads of the _Imaum_, the port guardship from 1856\r\nto 1862; the _Argent_, the port guardship from 1877 to 1903, and the\r\n_Megaera_, wrecked on Bare Bush Cay in 1843), was until quite lately\r\nthought to represent Nelson; but recent investigation has tended to\r\nprove that it is a portrait of the celebrated general Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby, who received his death wound in the hour of victory at the\r\nbattle of Alexandria, on August 1, 1801 (when he was conveyed to\r\nNelson’s old flagship, the _Foudroyant_): the blind eye of the\r\n_soi-disant_ Nelson has been removed, and the figure painted to\r\nrepresent Abercromby. If this be the true version, one rather wonders\r\nwhat wag had the audacity to transform it into a Nelson.\r\n\r\nAfter a cruise of a few months in his ship, the _Hinchinbrook_, Nelson\r\nwrote to Locker from Port Royal on January 23, 1780, “Our mess is broken\r\nup. Captain Cornwallis and myself live together.... I have been twice\r\ngiven over since you left this country with that cursed disorder, the\r\ngout.” Early in 1780, Nelson went on that ill-fated expedition to\r\nNicaragua, originated by Dalling, the governor, in which Dr. Dancer, the\r\nisland botanist, and the unfortunate Colonel Despard took part.\r\n\r\nThis expedition, while it laid the foundation of his subsequent fame,\r\nnearly cost Nelson his life. On his return to Port Royal he was\r\nsuffering so much from fever and dysentery that he had to be carried\r\nashore in his cot to the lodging-house of his former black nurse, Couba\r\nCornwallis, a favourite nurse with naval officers. From Couba’s hands\r\nNelson passed under the care of Sir Peter and Lady Parker, who first\r\nnursed him at Admiral’s Pen, and afterwards sent him to Admiral’s\r\nMountain[4] (as the Admiral’s hill residence was named) to recuperate;\r\nbut there he missed their kind attention, and wished himself back with\r\nCouba. While at Jamaica Nelson made many friends—in addition to his\r\nnaval companions, Parker, Prince William, Locker and Collingwood—such as\r\nSimon Taylor, a wealthy sugar planter and Hercules Ross, the Navy agent,\r\nto whose son Horatio, afterwards a celebrated sportsman, Nelson stood\r\ngodfather. A portrait of Charles II (said to have been painted in 1679\r\nand to have been in the possession of Bishop Falconer), presented by\r\nHercules Ross, for many years hung in the Royal Artillery and Royal\r\nEngineers’ mess at Fort Charles, and now adorns the former residence of\r\nthe commodores, now used as the mess room.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  This was probably in the Red Hills, but has never been identified. It\r\n  was possibly Mount Salus.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of Parker’s service at Jamaica, Rodney gained his\r\ncelebrated victory over the brave De Grasse off Dominica, on April 12,\r\n1782. De Grasse after fighting hard all day till only himself and two\r\nmen remained unwounded, at the setting of the sun and the arrival of the\r\n_Barfleur_ fresh to the fray, lowered with his own hands his flag on his\r\nship the _Ville de Paris_, the gay Lutetia’s present to Louis XV, and\r\nthus completed the British victory which had commenced the moment that\r\nRodney’s flagship the _Formidable_ had broken the French line.\r\n\r\nOn April 24, news reached Jamaica from St. Lucia, that both French and\r\nEnglish fleets had sailed. The worst was feared, and the suspense was\r\nintense; but on the morrow arrived the joyful news from Rodney that\r\nJamaica was saved from invasion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Monday, April 29, Rodney’s fleet with nine prizes was\r\nseen approaching, and though it was evident that it would be near sunset\r\nbefore the ships could be moored we can imagine that that would not have\r\nrestrained many from starting off from Kingston to Port Royal to witness\r\nthe triumphal entry.\r\n\r\n  Those, however, who remained behind and lined every vantage spot of\r\n  view and every housetop, witnessed a goodly sight, for a long line of\r\n  tall ships, on the tallest of which flew the lilies of France with the\r\n  Red Cross of St. George of England surmounting it, followed by ship\r\n  after ship each bearing similar signs of subjugation, and attended by\r\n  a brave show of their captors, swept in slow but stately array past\r\n  the Palisadoes with the last of the sea breeze, and rounding the point\r\n  brought up in good order, their enormous wooden anchor stocks causing\r\n  such a splash as they fell from their bows as to be visible by help of\r\n  a good glass from Kingston Church tower.\r\n\r\nThe _Ville de Paris_, was, it is said, the first first-rate man-of-war\r\never taken and carried into port by any commander of any nation. A\r\npainting by Pine, of Rodney in action aboard the _Formidable_, attended\r\nby his principal officers, is, with a volume of charts taken from De\r\nGrasse’s cabin, and a series of prints illustrating the engagement, in\r\nthe Institute of Jamaica. The prizes were sent home under convoy, which\r\nwas of course a special one. In those days the planters, merchants and\r\nothers interested were wont to meet and settle the rates of freight to\r\nbe paid by the fleet of merchantmen which went home four times a year,\r\nunder the convoy of a man-of-war. In war time the rates were nearly\r\nthree times as high as in peace. The merchantmen were then wont to\r\nassemble at Bluefields in order to await their convoy for England.\r\n\r\nThe _Ville de Paris_ and the other prizes encountered a hurricane on\r\ntheir way to England on September 16; and being hove to on the wrong\r\ntack, and perhaps overladen with the captured battering train and other\r\nstores, besides being weakened by the heavy fire to which they had been\r\nexposed, they with the exception of the _Ardent_ foundered with 1200\r\nmen; several ships of the convoy also sank.\r\n\r\nA series of four aquatints by Robert Dodd, published in 1783,\r\nillustrates the fate of this convoy with special reference to the _Lady\r\nJuliana_.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of record that two sons of Flora Macdonald went down in the\r\nlate flagship of the Comte De Grasse.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the following extract from the Minutes of a Meeting\r\nof the West India Merchants—now the West India Committee—held on January\r\n29, 1782, Mr. Long presiding, may be of interest:\r\n\r\n  The following letter from the Chairman, and Deputy Chairman, to Mr.\r\n  Stephens, was read.\r\n\r\n  SIR,—We take the Liberty of desiring you to submit to the Lords of the\r\n  Admiralty, to recommend to their Commander in Chief, the request we\r\n  made at the Board some time ago, of having _early and frequent_\r\n  Convoys home, both from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands, instead of\r\n  the Ships being sent home in such large and delayed Fleets, which in\r\n  the present Situation of Affairs, is found to be attended with great\r\n  Inconveniences, and very severe losses, besides, a greater Object of\r\n  Attention to the Enemy.—Early Convoys are particularly desirable, from\r\n  the Produce being extremely wanted, on account of its scarcity, and\r\n  coming home in a favourable season for safe Passages, the Strength of\r\n  the Convoys may be regulated by the number of the Trade in each.\r\n\r\n  We decline naming the Times of the Appointment of the Convoys (as has\r\n  been usually done) in order to prevent their expected arrival in\r\n  Europe being known to our Enemies.\r\n\r\n                                              We are, etc.,\r\n\r\n              10th January, 1782.      (Signed)            BEESTON LONG.\r\n                                                           RICHD. NEAVE.\r\n\r\nFrom 1796 to 1800, Sir Hyde Parker was commander-in-chief of Jamaica,\r\nand the cruising ships as stationed by him were exceptionally fortunate,\r\nand brought into Port Royal a great many prizes, merchantmen, privateers\r\nand ships of war, “by which both himself and his country were materially\r\nbenefited.”\r\n\r\nFrom October 1782 to July 1783, Nelson was cruising under Hood in West\r\nIndian waters, and more than once put into Port Royal.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, William IV, as a midshipman on the celebrated _Barfleur_, came\r\ninto Port Royal, the first prince of the blood royal of England to put\r\nfoot on Jamaica’s shore. He then made the acquaintance of Couba\r\nCornwallis, the _chère amie_ of the admiral of that name and the kindly\r\nnurse of Nelson, who lived till 1848.\r\n\r\nLady Nugent in her voluminous Journal, does not make much reference to\r\nPort Royal. On their arrival in July 1801, she records:\r\n\r\n  It is now seven o’clock in the evening and we have only just anchored\r\n  in Port Royal Harbour. An express is just sent off to the Governor at\r\n  Spanish Town. Colonel Ramsay of the Artillery, and Captain Coates of\r\n  the 69th Regiment, with a Navy officer from Lord Hugh Seymour, came on\r\n  board immediately. I am disappointed. I hoped to have landed\r\n  instantly, but there is so much etiquette about it, that it is settled\r\n  we are not to stir till to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n  29th [July]. General N. landed at six o’clock under salutes from the\r\n  forts and all the ships of war in the harbour. The _Ambuscade_ fired\r\n  on his leaving the deck, and I lay down to my cot, with a pillow over\r\n  my ears, the noise was so stunning.\r\n\r\nAll this is in marked contrast to the simpler landing of a governor in\r\nthese days—even on his first arrival.\r\n\r\nIn March 1804, Lady Nugent records:\r\n\r\n  Dress by candle-light, and our whole party proceeded to Port Royal\r\n  where the Admiral gave us a grand breakfast on board the\r\n  _Hercules_.... The _lion_ for the morning for the gentlemen was a\r\n  large cannon, taken from the French, but I own it did not interest me\r\n  much.\r\n\r\nThis was probably one of those cannons which were removed to the present\r\nKing’s House on the shutting up of the dockyard.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Port Royal saw the victorious Duckworth bring in three French\r\nships taken off Santo Domingo after what was called, before the days of\r\nTogo, “one of the completest victories on record.”\r\n\r\nIn the memorable year 1805, Dacres was commander-in-chief of Jamaica,\r\nand he detained at Port Royal for the protection of the island four of\r\nthe six ships (of Cochrane’s squadron), which had come out in chase of\r\nMissiessy, and Nelson had hoped would reach him at Barbados, when he\r\nsailed in pursuit of the French fleet under Villeneuve, immediately\r\nbefore Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nWith Trafalgar, Port Royal’s chief importance as a naval station may be\r\nsaid to have ended. Nothing of great moment, except the almost complete\r\ndestruction of the town by fire in 1815, occurred afterwards, although\r\nJamaica remained as a separate station for some twenty years more.\r\n\r\nMonk Lewis writes in February 1816:\r\n\r\n  The Jamaica canoes are hollowed cotton-trees. We embarked in one of\r\n  them at six in the morning, and visited the ruins of Port Royal,\r\n  which, last year, was destroyed by fire: some of the houses were\r\n  rebuilding; but it was a melancholy sight, not only from the look of\r\n  the half-burnt buildings, but the dejected countenances of the ruined\r\n  inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBleby records in his “Scenes in the Caribbean Sea” (1854) having seen as\r\nhe entered the harbour in 1831, several slavers captured by British\r\ncruisers and sent in here to be condemned and broken up.\r\n\r\nIn “The Wanderings of a Marine,” a series of letters to a friend\r\ncomprising descriptive sketches at sea and on shore, at home and abroad,\r\nwritten in 1831—a manuscript volume in the West India Library of the\r\nInstitute of Jamaica, we read:\r\n\r\n  As we approached Port Royal Bay a novel and pleasing sight was again\r\n  displayed to our view. The hills now gradually gave place to gentle\r\n  slopes and green knolls till towards the entrance the land became\r\n  perfectly level. Still advancing, we found ourselves in a narrow\r\n  channel between the projecting headlands beautifully ornamented with\r\n  cocoanut trees and separated from each other by a very small distance,\r\n  scarcely sufficient to permit two large vessels to pass. At the\r\n  extremity of these headlands, where the bay begins to sweep, there are\r\n  placed two very strong forts, and there is a third at the opposite\r\n  side so that no enemy can force an entrance if a good outlook is kept.\r\n  The water in this channel is remarkably clear, and exhibits with great\r\n  distinctness the tops and chimneys of houses at the bottom. It is now\r\n  many years since a dreadful earthquake destroyed great part of the\r\n  town of Port Royal and covered it with the sea, by which means the\r\n  site of the harbour was completely changed, and what was formerly dry\r\n  land, on which stood the town, became part of the entrance of the bay.\r\n\r\nIn the “Statistical Report of the Sickness, Mortality, and Invaliding\r\nAmong the Troops in the West Indies,” published as a Parliamentary paper\r\nin 1838, the following is the account given of Port Royal:\r\n\r\n  ... The barracks stand at the very extremity of the peninsula on which\r\n  the town is built, only three feet above the level of the sea, and\r\n  frequently at high water a great portion of the parade-ground is\r\n  inundated by the tide. The hospital is in a narrow street leading from\r\n  the town to the barracks, and consists of a ground floor and upper\r\n  storey, divided into six wards, with balconies in front and rear....\r\n\r\n  ... During the above period [1817–1836] the average mortality has been\r\n  about 113 per thousand of the strength annually, but it exhibits\r\n  remarkable variations at different periods. Last year it was less than\r\n  1 per cent., while in 1825 about a third part of the force was cut\r\n  off; thus demonstrating how difficult it is to form any fair estimate\r\n  of the influence of these climates, except on the average of a long\r\n  series of years. This station suffered very severely from the epidemic\r\n  fevers which raged throughout the island in 1819, 1822, and 1825. A\r\n  large proportion of the force also was cut off in 1821, when most of\r\n  the other stations were comparatively healthy....\r\n\r\n  On comparing the ratio of deaths by each of the above classes of\r\n  diseases with that which has prevailed generally throughout the\r\n  island, there appears little difference in any except fevers, which\r\n  have been rather under the average, particularly since 1830; and so\r\n  irregular has been their operation that, though in 1819 and 1825, they\r\n  cut off a third part of the force; in 1831 not a death took place from\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nOn visiting Jamaica in 1844, while the captain and the other passengers\r\nof the ship, which was bound for Savanna-la-Mar, went up the harbour, to\r\nsee Kingston, Gosse spent his time in examining the fauna and flora of\r\nthe Palisadoes.\r\n\r\n  It is true there was little of the luxuriance or beauty that we\r\n  associate with tropical scenery here. It is a low land of sand nearly\r\n  nine miles in length; but scarcely anywhere more than a few hundred\r\n  yards in breadth, forming a natural breakwater that separates the\r\n  broad lake-like harbour of Kingston from the Caribbean Sea. I found it\r\n  barren enough; but it was all strange, and to feet which for nearly\r\n  two months had not felt the firm earth, even a run along the beach was\r\n  exhilarating. The graceful cocoanut palm sprang up in groups from the\r\n  water’s edge, waving its feathery fronds over the rippling waters that\r\n  dashed about its fibrous foot. Great bushes of prickly-pear and other\r\n  _Cacti_ were growing on the low summit of the bank, covering large\r\n  spaces of ground, with their impenetrable masses, presenting a\r\n  formidable array of spines: as did also a species of _Acacia_ that\r\n  grew in thickets and single trees. All along the line of high water\r\n  lay heaps of seaweeds drying in the sun, among which was particularly\r\n  abundant a species of _Padina_, closely resembling the pretty\r\n  “Peacock’s tail” of our own shores, though less regularly beautiful.\r\n  Sponges of various forms, and large Fan-corals with the gelatinous\r\n  flesh dried on the horny skeleton, were also thrown up on the higher\r\n  beach; and I found in some abundance, a _Coralline_, of a soft\r\n  consistence, and of a bright grass green hue, each branch of which was\r\n  terminated by a radiating tuft of slender filaments.\r\n\r\n  Shells were very scarce on the sea beach; but on the harbour side many\r\n  species were found in the crevices and pools of the low rocks, and\r\n  just within the margin of the water. All were small, and few presented\r\n  any facts worthy of being noticed: they were chiefly of the genera\r\n  _Turbo_, _Phasianella_, _Planaxis_, _Buccinum_, _Vermetus_, and\r\n  _Fusus_; the bivalves _Ostrea_, _Anomia_, _Spondylus_, _Avicula_,\r\n  _Arca_, _Cardium_, _Venus_, and _Pholas_. Several specimens of a\r\n  brilliant little _Choetodon_ were swimming and darting about the\r\n  narrow, but deep pools; they were not more than an inch in length,\r\n  marked with alternate bands of black and golden yellow. In the\r\n  vertical position in which they swim, with the eye of the observer\r\n  looking down upon them, they appear to bear the slender proportions of\r\n  ordinary fishes; and it is only by accident as in turning, or on\r\n  capturing one, that we detect the peculiar form, high and vertically\r\n  flattened, of this curious genus.\r\n\r\nFor the naturalist there is a work of lasting interest in the form of a\r\nsmall rare volume published in 1855, by Richard Hill, the friend and\r\ncollaborator of Gosse, entitled “A Week at Port Royal.” Even in his day\r\nit was “a place for the memory.”\r\n\r\nOne passage records that:\r\n\r\n  Admiral Sir Charles Hamilton related that in 1780 the submerged houses\r\n  were plainly discernible between the town as it now stands and the\r\n  usual anchorage of vessels of war. Bryan Edwards says, in 1793, the\r\n  ruins were visible in clear weather from the boats which sailed over\r\n  them; and Lieutenant B. Jeffrey, of the Royal Navy, states that when\r\n  engaged in the surveys made between the years 1824 and 1835, he\r\n  repeatedly traced sites of buildings where the depth of the water is\r\n  from four to six fathoms. When there was little wind, he perceived\r\n  traces of houses, especially distinct when he used the instrument\r\n  called “the diver’s eye” let down below the ripple of the wave.\r\n\r\nA later work, published in 1893 by Major M. M[artin] and others,\r\nentitled “Port Royal and its Harbour,” is of more general interest.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, at the time of the exhibition, Jamaica was visited by the\r\npresent King and his elder brother, and Port Royal was not overlooked;\r\nnor was it when Prince Albert visited Jamaica in the spring of 1913.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, experimental borings were made by the military authorities with\r\na view to obtaining a supply of fresh water, but these were abandoned\r\nwhen a depth of 270 feet had been reached.\r\n\r\nBy the irony of fate, the impetus given a few years since to British\r\nnaval development was destined to result not in the increase in\r\nimportance, but in the withdrawal of the remnants of the faded glory, of\r\na fort which was formerly one of the principal advance guards of\r\nBritannia’s realm.\r\n\r\nA shadow of coming events was cast in 1903 by the sale of the old depot\r\nship, the _Urgent_, which for many years, after serving as a troop ship,\r\nhad swung to the tide at the entrance to the harbour, which before the\r\ndays of monster vessels boasted that it could hold the navies of the\r\nworld. By a special order in council the commodore then flew for a short\r\ntime his broad pennant in the dockyard instead of in the _Urgent_, which\r\nwas destined to spend her last days in the inglorious capacity of a coal\r\nhulk in Boston harbour. Then the edict went forth that the office of\r\ncommodore, which in 1838 replaced that of admiral, when Jamaica ceased\r\nto be an independent command, was to be abolished, and on March 31,\r\n1905, Commodore Fisher struck his flag.\r\n\r\nOf later years Port Royal has become most important as a military fort;\r\nif that glory were taken from it, it would sink almost into the\r\ninsignificance of its neighbour Port Henderson, across the harbour’s\r\nmouth—where the old _Aboukir_, rebuilt, does duty as a storehouse, and\r\nwhere memory still lingers of the days when it formed a seaside resort\r\nfor the gay folk of St. Jago de la Vega—and it would be without Port\r\nHenderson’s importance as a banana port.\r\n\r\nIts ancient glory was recalled on September 10, 1914, when a large crowd\r\nassembled to see H.M.S. _Essex_ bring in as prize the Hamburg-Amerika\r\nline steamer _Bethania_ with five hundred naval reservists on board.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the completion of the Panama Canal may give to\r\nPort Royal a new era of commercial prosperity, unaccompanied by the\r\ndrawbacks which attended its acquisition of wealth in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n                             ST. CATHERINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Catherine derived its name from the queen of Charles\r\nII., who was king of England when the parish was formed. In the first\r\nact in which it is mentioned it is correctly spelled Katharine. It\r\nconsists of what before the passing of law 20 of 1867 constituted the\r\nparishes of St. Catherine, St. Dorothy, St. John and St.\r\nThomas-in-the-Vale. St. Thomas-in-the-Vale was probably named after Sir\r\nThomas Lynch. St. Dorothy, Roby, in his “Memorials of the Cathedral\r\nChurch and Parish of St. Catherine” (1831), conjectures, received its\r\nname in compliment to Dorthy Wale, who had probably a large estate\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n=Passage Fort=, at first known as The Passage, probably so called by the\r\nSpaniards as being their place of embarkation from St. Jago de la Vega\r\n(Spanish Town), situated at the west end of Kingston harbour, first\r\nappears in the annals of Jamaica as the landing-place of a predatory\r\nexpedition fitted out chiefly in Barbados and St. Kitts in 1642 by a\r\ncertain Captain William Jackson, of whom little is known but of whose\r\nexpedition a graphic account is given in a manuscript in the Sloane MSS.\r\nin the British Museum entitled: “CXVIII—Mercurius Americanus—A Briefe\r\nJournall, or a succinct and true relation of the most Remarkable\r\nPassages observed in the Voyage undertaken by Captain William Jackson to\r\nthe West Indies or Continent of America. Anno Domini, 1642, September\r\n27,” reprinted in “The West India Committee Circular,” May 9,\r\n1911—January 16, 1912. The date, September 27, 1642, it may be\r\nmentioned, is the date of sailing, not of the writing of the account.\r\n\r\nRichard Norwood, who was a minister of religion and a school teacher,\r\nwriting under date May 14, 1645, from Somers Islands, now known as\r\nBermuda, to the Governor and Company of Adventurers to the Somers\r\nIslands, alluded to the time when of late the valiant and victorious\r\nGeneral Capt. Jackson arrived after his voyage through the West Indies,\r\nand added “it was doubtful how things would go.”\r\n\r\nAfter attempts more or less successful on various islands and the\r\nSpanish main, Jackson, in the _Charles_, accompanied by the _Dolphin_\r\nand the _Valentine_, put into Port Royal harbour on March 25, 1643.\r\nAfter trying the west coast of the harbour, where they perceived “noe\r\npassage,” they interrogated some prisoners and were led to Passage Fort\r\n“at a place where we found an Old Trench and a storehouse of Timber,\r\nlately sett by but not fully finished,” where, after a skirmish with\r\nboth horse and foot of the enemy, they took the fort and marched past\r\n“divers workes,” one of which they dismantled, into Spanish Town.\r\nJackson’s men were so pleased that they wished “to sett by their stacon\r\nhere”; but the general, bent on robbing the Spaniards, had no taste for\r\nbucolic simplicity and gave up the town for “200 Beaves and 10,000\r\nweight of cassavi bread for ye victualling of our ships, besides 20\r\nBeaves every day for ye general expense till our departure and 7,000\r\npieces of Eight.” After spending sixteen days in “salting up our Beaves”\r\nJackson and his men sailed away, but a few days later took a Spanish\r\nfrigate “in an Harbour next to that where wee had formerly ridd at\r\nankor,” probably Old Harbour.\r\n\r\nThe most important event, however, in the history of Passage Fort is the\r\ntaking of Jamaica by the English in 1655. After an inexcusable failure\r\non Hispaniola (or, to give it its original name, Haiti), due in some\r\nmeasure to silly jealousy between the naval and military authorities,\r\nwhen, to use Venables’s own words, passion usurped the seat of reason,\r\nand also to want of care—one might almost say of honesty—on the part of\r\nthose responsible for the organization of the expedition, Penn and\r\nVenables, joint commanders of an expedition intended “to assault the\r\nSpaniard in the West Indies,” entered what we now call Kingston harbour\r\non May 10, 1655, and anchored at about 11 A.M. On nearing the island it\r\nhad been proclaimed to the whole army, as a result of the cowardice\r\ndisplayed in the attack on Hispaniola, that whoever should be found to\r\nturn his back on the enemy and run away, the next officer (that brought\r\nup the rear of that division) should immediately run him through, on\r\npenalty of death if he failed to do it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PASSAGE FORT\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere were thirty-eight ships in the three squadrons, and about seven\r\nthousand troops, without counting the sea regiment, who numbered nearly\r\none thousand more.\r\n\r\nA few shots fired into the fort from the _Martin_ (one of the smallest\r\nof the fleet, carrying but twelve guns and sixty men), which was run\r\nashore as near the fort as possible, and the landing of the troops,\r\nseemed to have sufficed to disperse the Spaniards, whose best soldier, a\r\nmajor, had been disabled by a shot. They left three guns mounted in the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nThus Jamaica was captured by a wretched army without the loss of a man.\r\nColonel Clarke, who had died at sea on the 9th from wounds received at\r\nHispaniola, was buried at Passage Fort on May 11.\r\n\r\nThe following account, signed W.B., and written probably by William\r\nBurrows, who was Sir William Penn’s chief clerk in the Navy Office after\r\nthe Restoration, is taken from the journal of the _Swiftsure_:\r\n\r\n  The landing-places are two, and are only banks supported with stakes,\r\n  a matter of twenty yards long towards the water; all the rest being\r\n  trees and bushes, among which can be no good going ashore. At the more\r\n  eastward, where we landed, we saw the ordnance the Spaniards left; the\r\n  army having landed at the other, within that to the westward. A pretty\r\n  parcel of ground is cleared within the landing-places. About a furlong\r\n  and a half thence, the way leads into the wood, which continues till\r\n  within a quarter of a mile of the town; all the way being even,\r\n  without hills, and a fair path for eight to march abreast. At the\r\n  issuing out of the wood begins the Savanna, which stretches about, and\r\n  is very fair and plain to the westward of the town; so that I deemed\r\n  there might be room enough for 50,000 men to draw up in battalia.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Cobre has, since the conquest of the island, brought down so\r\nmuch sand and deposited it at its mouth that the site of Passage Fort is\r\nnow some four or five hundred yards off the sea. In dry weather, it now\r\nmeanders through a new course which it cut for itself in 1838, across\r\nthe beach to the harbour, giving no idea of the power which it acquires\r\nin the rainy season. Here, as of old, is there “no good going ashore,”\r\nthe slope of the beach being very gradual.\r\n\r\nIn “The Present State of Jamaica” (1683) we read: “Going from Port Royal\r\nto St. Jago de la Vega, people land at Passage, where a fort was in Col.\r\nDoyly’s time, and there is about thirty houses that are storehouses,\r\nalehouses, and horse keepers, and hackney coaches; this being the\r\ngreatest passage in the island, it is two leagues from Port Royal by\r\nsea, and six miles from St. Jago by land.”\r\n\r\nTotally destroyed by the earthquake of 1692, the village was but\r\npartially rebuilt, and was, when Long wrote his history (1774), of small\r\nimportance, consisting of about fifteen houses, chiefly inhabited by\r\nwharfingers, warehouse keepers and the masters of wherries and hackney\r\nchaises, which plied with passengers to and from Port Royal and Spanish\r\nTown. Large ships could not lie alongside as there was not sufficient\r\ndepth of water; and for this reason it was in a measure superseded by\r\nPort Henderson, where the depth of water is greater; but, with the\r\nabandonment of Spanish Town as the seat of government, both villages\r\ngradually diminished, and Passage Fort is to-day a mere fishing hamlet.\r\n\r\nRichard Hill, in his “A Week at Port Royal” (1855), says:\r\n\r\n  The early maps of Saint Catherine’s show that there have occurred\r\n  deviations in the course of the Rio Cobre, that are not easily to be\r\n  reconciled by abundant rains. Antecedent to the discovery of the West\r\n  Indies, the embouchure of the river was perceptively in the ponds,\r\n  shut in by the narrow belt of land on which Fort Augusta stands, the\r\n  river having been at that time more of a surface stream, and striking\r\n  to _the sea due south; the outlet curving northward_, and embaying\r\n  Passage Fort. At the time of the conquest of the island by the English\r\n  the river flowed in an opposite direction _due north_, coursing the\r\n  foot of the Caymanas Mountains, and making the present lagoons in the\r\n  upper part of that plain its channel, seeking the _sea southward_,\r\n  through what is now an independent stream, called the Ferry River\r\n  (Fresh River). In 1722, in the midst of an extraordinary rain-storm,\r\n  this channel was suddenly quitted, and a straight line made\r\n  _eastward_. The settling waters, as they reached the Harbour of\r\n  Kingston, impeded by the easterly winds, regurgitated through the\r\n  lakelet into which they gathered themselves, and digging out the soil\r\n  at the foot of the mountains, made the present lagoons, increasing the\r\n  sea-board lands of Hunt’s Bay 3000 feet (three thousand).\r\n\r\nIn Spanish Town, the ancient capital, although there is nothing to speak\r\nto us of the native Arawâk, we can perhaps, better than anywhere else in\r\nthe island, picture to ourselves the deeds of the Spaniards in the\r\nfifteenth and early sixteenth century; and especially the long struggles\r\nbetween the people’s or rather planters’ representatives and the\r\ngovernment in the House of Assembly for a century and a half; together\r\nwith the political and social entertainments at King’s House, as\r\nnarrated for one short period in the graphic pages of Lady Nugent’s\r\nJournal, until, with the removal of the government to Kingston by Sir\r\nJohn Peter Grant, Spanish Town was shorn of its grandeur, to be only\r\nrevived at rare intervals by such episodes as the consecration of the\r\nBishop of Antigua in 1911.\r\n\r\nJackson gives the following account of the town in 1643.\r\n\r\n  The fame of our proceedings in other places had arrived here eight\r\n  days before us, so that they had time enough to convey all their best\r\n  household stuff away, leaving nothing behinde them of any value, but\r\n  onely ye possession of empty houses, with some few chaires, bedsteads,\r\n  jarres of Mountego, and ye like poore materialls. However, we feasted\r\n  ourselves this night with Hoggs, Henns, and other good provisions,\r\n  which wee found in and about ye Towne. This place is called by ye\r\n  inhabitants Sant Jago de la Vega, being a faire Town, consisting of\r\n  four or five hundred houses, built for ye most part with canes,\r\n  overcast with morter and lime, and covered with Tyle. It is beautiful\r\n  with five or six stately churches and chapples, and one Monastery of\r\n  Franciscan Fryers, and situated upon descent of a delectable and\r\n  spacious plaine, on ye North West whereof runneth a pleasant River,\r\n  whose streame doth empty itself into ye Harbour, distant from hence\r\n  about four miles Eastward, where our Fleet lay at ankor.\r\n\r\n  The houses, unlesse it bee in ye Markitt Place, stand somewhat\r\n  separated one from another, by which means it taketh up farr more\r\n  roome than thrice ye number of our comparted building in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe churches and houses of the Spaniards were for the most part\r\ndestroyed by the Venables’s soldiery in sheer wantonness. But when they\r\nbegan to settle the island, they repaired those which were worth\r\nrepairing. It is doubtful, however, if much Spanish work exists to-day.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of St. Jago de la Vega were probably laid by the then\r\nviceroy, Diego Columbus, about the year 1523. His son Lewis, created\r\nDuke of Veragua, had for a second title Marquis de la Vega, after this\r\ntown. Hickeringill (writing in 1661) tells us that when the English took\r\nthe island it contained 2000 houses, sixteen churches and chapels and\r\none abbey, and that of these the English soldiery left but two churches\r\nand 500 houses undemolished, but it is thought by Long that this was an\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nIn April 1755 when the penkeepers of St. Catherine, St. John, St.\r\nDorothy and St. Thomas-in-the-Vale petitioned the Assembly against the\r\nproposed removal of the courts of justice and public offices to Kingston\r\n(the assembly itself being then sitting there) they stated that St. Jago\r\nde la Vega then consisted of 499 houses, of a rental value of nearly\r\n£20,000, and 866 settled white inhabitants exclusive of visitors, and\r\n405 mulattoes and negroes: that there were 472 pens and provision\r\nplantations in the neighbourhood, and there were 24,000 inhabitants in\r\nthe parishes named.\r\n\r\nWhen Doyley, on the death of Brayne in September 1657, found himself in\r\nsupreme command in the newly acquired island of Jamaica, he set himself\r\nresolutely to work to establish the colony on a firm basis. After having\r\nsuccessfully repelled three attempts made by Sasi, the last Spanish\r\ngovernor, to retake the island from Hispaniola, he, in August 1660, was\r\nmet by internal rebellion, got up by Colonel Raymond, who persuaded\r\nColonel Tyson, the gallant commander of the English troops in the last\r\ndefeat of Sasi a few months earlier, to participate in it.\r\n\r\nOf Raymond little is known beyond that Beeston calls him “a discontented\r\nreformed officer,” and Long “a factious officer.” Tyson, we know, was\r\nnot one of those who came out with Venables, but arrived a year later.\r\nLeslie tells us that they were “two gentlemen who adhered to the\r\nProtector and had a mighty influence on the soldiers.”\r\n\r\nIn the face of contradictory evidence it is a little difficult to\r\ndiscover the real origin of the outbreak. An interesting contemporary\r\naccount of it is given by Colonel (afterwards Sir) William Beeston, in a\r\njournal kept by him “from his first coming to Jamaica,” and printed from\r\nthe MSS. now in the British Museum, in “Interesting Tracts relating to\r\nthe Island of Jamaica ... St. Jago de la Vega, 1800.” He says:\r\n\r\n  April 27, 1660. At my arrival the people were still as an Army, but\r\n  without pay, commanded by General Doyley, under whom, as chief\r\n  ministers, were Major Fairfax and Captain Burroughs; the government\r\n  was only by a court-martial held once a month at St. Jago, and what\r\n  disputes General Doyley [_gap in the print here_] self, who lived very\r\n  near and private, did not by any means love planting, but hindered\r\n  those that were willing to plant, by telling them they would be all\r\n  called off. The people were now healthful, and provisions began to be\r\n  plenty, and trade to increase; the privateering was carried on, and\r\n  good prizes often brought in by them....\r\n\r\n  About this time the rump parliament being again up in England no\r\n  recruits came for the Army, and they had no pay which made the\r\n  soldiers deem themselves neglected, and a general expectation there\r\n  was that all would be called off, and the island deserted, there being\r\n  no news of His Majesty’s happy restoration; this gave occasion to one\r\n  of the Regiments at Guanaboe, and formerly commanded by Colonel\r\n  Barrington, but now by Lieutenant-Colonel Tyson, who being set on by a\r\n  discontented reformed officer called Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond, who\r\n  lived near him, began to mutiny and set up for themselves, saying,\r\n  they would live no more as an Army. And accordingly, August 2, they\r\n  declared they would have the Island settled in Colonies, and make\r\n  constables and civil officers. These, General Doyley not being able to\r\n  appease with words, drew some forces to St. Jago to appease them, but\r\n  was cautious, not being certain but that those he brought if it came\r\n  to the push, would fail him, and be of the mind of the others; and,\r\n  therefore, he ordered a ship of Southampton, called the _Mary_,\r\n  Captain Richard Tylar, Commander, to lay ready without the fort that\r\n  if he saw things grow desperate he might embark and leave them; but by\r\n  sending several messengers to them, and at length Major Richard Hope,\r\n  of the Liguanea Regiment, he so prevailed with them, telling them the\r\n  danger if they persisted, and, on the contrary, that if they delivered\r\n  up the two Lieutenant-Colonels they should all be pardoned, that they\r\n  promised the next morning to deliver up their officers. Accordingly,\r\n  in the morning, the soldiers brought down the two Lieutenant-Colonels,\r\n  and delivered them up; on whom there presently sat a Court-Martial who\r\n  adjudged them worthy of death, and accordingly, in a very short time,\r\n  in sight of both parties, they were shot to death. Then the soldiers\r\n  were all ordered to their several quarters, but were grown so\r\n  insolent, that the General was forced to give them leave to plunder\r\n  the houses of Tyson and Raymond in St. Jago, which flushed them to\r\n  plunder more, even any that they could pretend had any correspondence\r\n  with those men; and yet after all this, and all the fair words that\r\n  were given them, it was as much as the General and their Officers\r\n  could do to keep them from mutinying and to get them to return to\r\n  their precincts.\r\n\r\nTyson and Raymond were shot on August 3, 1660, tradition says, under the\r\nlarge tamarind tree which still stands in Spanish Town, in =Mulberry\r\nGarden=, now used as a poor-house. August 2 is the date usually given,\r\nbut Beeston’s account makes it clear that they were shot on “the next\r\nmorning,” _i.e._ the 3rd.\r\n\r\nLeslie, without giving the source of his information, adds, “Raymond\r\nexpressed no concern, but died with a haughty kind of Resolution. Tyson\r\nbehaved in a manner more becoming, and seemed penitent for the part he\r\nhad acted.” We learn from the “Calendar of State Papers,” that in May\r\n1660 an Order in Council was made “To permit Mary Tyson to repair to her\r\nhusband, Lieut.-Col. Edward Tyson, in Jamaica, in the ship _Bear_, now\r\nbound thither, with accommodation for two maid-servants and one\r\nmanservant.” Her arrival must have been a sad one. She found her gallant\r\nbut misguided husband laid in a rebel’s grave.\r\n\r\nLong says that Raymond was probably encouraged in his attempt by the\r\nknowledge that Doyley was not armed with any express commission or power\r\nto punish such offence capitally; and Gardner, thus fortified, says that\r\nDoyley’s action was illegal. But Beeston tells us that “the government\r\nwas only by court-martial,” and this surely implied the right to shoot a\r\nrebel. The news of the Restoration reached Jamaica twelve days after the\r\naffair, but Doyley did not receive his commission to act as a\r\nconstitutional governor until February 8, 1661.\r\n\r\nLeslie makes the outbreak a Cavalier and Roundhead affair, and Bridges\r\nand Hill concur in that view. Gardner, following Beeston, thinks it was\r\nmainly due to a desire for a simple civil life. Long says, “Raymond’s\r\nobject, it has been supposed, was to seize the Government himself; but\r\nthe real design is not certainly known.” In contradistinction to\r\nBeeston, Long tells us that Doyley was “a steady advocate for pursuing\r\nthe cultivation of the island, to which most of the private men were\r\ndisinclined.”\r\n\r\nThe outbreak was probably just as much due to a desire for a more civil\r\nform of government than that favoured by Doyley as to any feeling of\r\nloyalty to the Stuarts; and the fact that Doyley felt compelled to take\r\nprecautions for his personal safety in case of defeat may have been\r\ndictated as much by fear of the soldiers’ dislike for him as a martinet,\r\nas of the antipathy of the Roundhead portion of them to him as a\r\ncavalier.\r\n\r\nOf the ecclesiastical buildings at St. Jago de la Vega trustworthy\r\nrecords exist only of an abbey, and a chapel of the red cross and a\r\nchapel of the white cross. The present =Cathedral=, the oldest cathedral\r\nin the British colonies, stands on the site of the red cross chapel. The\r\nbases of two piers (Long calls them columns) 8 feet square, part of the\r\nentrance to the abbey (which stood to the south of the present parade),\r\nwere, in Long’s time, standing near the south end of the public offices.\r\nThey were of brickwork, strongly cemented. He says: “I have seen in this\r\ntown a great many large stone mouldings for the bases and other parts of\r\ncolumns, which, as well as the sculptures dug out of the ruins of\r\nSevilla Nueva, in St. Ann’s, appeared to have been executed by no mean\r\nartist. The Spanish ecclesiastics ... must be allowed some merit in\r\nhaving cultivated the elegances of architecture in these remote parts of\r\nthe world. Some of their public structures at St. Domingo, the Havannah,\r\nLa Vera Cruz, Carthagena, Panama, &c., would make a noble figure even in\r\nEuropean cities.” Unfortunately it would seem that, judging from his\r\ncomments on buildings still standing, art criticism was not one of\r\nLong’s strong points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SPANISH-TOWN CATHEDRAL\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe original church, erected by the English, probably on the foundations\r\nand of the materials of the Spanish building, as the parish church of\r\nSt. Catherine, was thrown down by the hurricane of 1712, and was rebuilt\r\nof red brick in 1714, as is stated on a tablet over the entrance door in\r\nthe tower at the west end:\r\n\r\n  D. O. M.\r\n\r\n  This Church Dedicated to ye Service of Almighty God was thrown downe\r\n  by ye dreadfull Hurricane of August ye 28th Anno Domini MDCCXII., and\r\n  was by ye Divine Assistance, through ye Piety and at ye expence of ye\r\n  Parishioners, more beautifully and substantially rebuilt upon its old\r\n  foundation in ye thirteenth year of ye Reigne of our most gracious\r\n  Sovereigne Queen Ann and in ye Government of his Excellency the Lord\r\n  Archibald Hamilton, in the year of our Lord MDCCXIV.\r\n\r\n                                 Matthew Gregory, Esq^r.\r\n                                           &             Church Wardens.\r\n                                 Mr. Beaument Pestell.\r\n\r\nBelow this on another marble slab is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                        This tower was erected,\r\n            And the above Tablet removed from the inner Wall\r\n                         In the year MDCCCXVII.\r\n               His Grace the Duke of Manchester Governor.\r\n               John Lunan, Francis Smith, Churchwardens.\r\n\r\nWhen Long published his History in 1774, the church being without a\r\ntower, the congregation was “summoned by a small bell hung in a wooden\r\nframe erected in the churchyard.”\r\n\r\nHakewill (1821), one of the few artists who have ever seen the\r\ncathedral, calls it “an ancient brick structure of no exterior beauty.”\r\nIn Roby’s time (1831) the walls were wainscoted, and the roof was coved\r\nand ornamented with circles, ovals, and lozenges. In 1843 the letters\r\npatent creating Aubrey George Spencer second bishop of Jamaica, created\r\nthe parish church of St. Catherine the cathedral of the diocese. The\r\nchancel was restored and extended in 1853. A chapter was formed in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe church, which had fallen into disrepair, was restored in 1901, as is\r\nduly recorded on the tower, “in commemoration of the glorious reign of\r\nher most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, 1837–1901.” Considerable\r\ndamage was wrought by the earthquake of 1907, and a further restoration\r\nwas completed during the year 1908.\r\n\r\nOn state occasions, such as the burial of the governor, the House of\r\nAssembly was wont to attend in a body; and the church was, from the\r\ntaking of the island till the removal of the capital to Kingston in\r\n1866, intimately associated with all the important events in the\r\nisland’s history, being near both to the House of Assembly and the\r\ngovernor’s residence. Nearly all its celebrated personages were at some\r\ntime or another within its walls, and many of them are buried within its\r\nprecincts.\r\n\r\nOf its monuments the most important are those to the Earl and Countess\r\nof Effingham (d. 1791); the wife of Sir Adam Williamson (d. 1794); and\r\nDr. Brodbelt (d. 1795), all by Bacon; Sir Basil Keith (d. 1777), by J.\r\nWilton, R.A.; the Countess of Elgin (d. 1842), by Sir John Steell;\r\nColonel John Colbeck (d. 1682), who came out with Penn and Venables;\r\nWilliam Nedham (d. 1746), four times elected speaker of the Assembly;\r\nWilliam Selwyn (d. 1702), governor; Henry Cunningham (d. 1735–6),\r\ngovernor; Sir Thomas Modyford (d. 1679), governor; Elizabeth Modyford\r\n(d. 1694), wife successively of Samuel Barry and Sir Nicholas Lawes; Sir\r\nThomas Lynch (d. 1684), governor; Samuel Long (d. 1683), the patriot\r\nwho, with William Beeston, succeeded in maintaining the privileges of\r\nthe island as against the restrictions attempted to be imposed by the\r\nEarl of Carlisle, acting on instructions from home; Peter Beckford (d.\r\n1710), lieutenant-governor; Major-General James Bannister (d. 1674), at\r\none time governor of Surinam.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Trelawny died, the Assembly expended 1000 guineas on\r\nhis funeral, but no monument or slab marks his last resting-place. Other\r\ngovernors who have died in the island and are without a monument are,\r\nthe Duke of Albemarle, the Duke of Portland, Sir Nicholas Lawes, General\r\nHunter and General Haldane; the bodies of the two first-named (as was\r\nthat of Sir Basil Keith) were sent across the Atlantic for interment;\r\nbut portions of Albemarle’s body were buried under the altar. Inchiquin\r\nwas buried in the church, but there was no memorial of him until the\r\npresent Lord Inchiquin erected a brass tablet in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe earliest monument is that to Catherine, wife of Sir Charles\r\nLyttelton (January 1662).\r\n\r\nThe following plate is in the Cathedral:\r\n\r\n  FLAGON: The Rev. John Lindsay, D.D., Rector; Samuel Howell, James\r\n    Trowers, Esq., Churchwardens. From the old plate of St. Catherine,\r\n    Jamaica, 1685. Refashioned 1777. Maker’s name S. W., like that of\r\n    the maker of a pair of Candlesticks of the year 1759 in Trinity\r\n    College, Oxford (recorded by Cripps).\r\n\r\n  2 PATENS: On each—The Gift of Susannah Butler, widow, of St.\r\n    Catherine, Jamaica, 1702. Refashioned 1777. Maker’s name S. W.\r\n\r\n  2 PATENS (Small), with foot. The gift of Mrs. Jane Spencer to the\r\n    Altar of St. Catherine, Jamaica. Refashioned 1777.

Refashioned 1777.\r\n\r\n  FLAGON AND 2 CUPS AND 2 PATENS: With the year mark 1789. Maker’s name,\r\n    W. P.\r\n\r\n  1 FLAGON, 2 CHALICES AND 2 PATENS: On each—Presented by Sarah Cole to\r\n    Trinity Chapel, St. Catherine’s, Jamaica. Christmas, A.D. 1851.\r\n\r\n  PATEN (Small): The gift of Wm. G. Macfarlane, in memory of his sister,\r\n    Elizabeth E. Jackson, born October 8th, 1819, died Dec. 5th, 1854.\r\n\r\n  STRAINER SPOON: Year mark 1855. Maker’s name G. A.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the old plate of 1685 was refashioned in\r\n1777.\r\n\r\nThe church at Spanish Town is the oldest foundation in the colony,\r\ndating from the year of the British occupation, 1655; the next oldest\r\nbeing St. Andrew (Halfway-Tree), dating from 1666, the Alley, 1671, and\r\nSt. John’s Guanaboa Vale, which dates from 1699.\r\n\r\nThe Baptismal and Marriage registers date from 1668: the Burial from\r\n1671.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that one of the earliest bequests recorded in\r\nthe island was that of Edward Morgan of July 14, 1674, of “his house for\r\na parsonage house” in St. Jago de la Vega.\r\n\r\nIn April 1677, the Assembly gave “Thanks to Mr. Howser for his sermon;\r\nto be desired to say prayers in the House every morning between six and\r\nseven o’clock, who answered that he would give his attendance at that\r\ntime. Every member not attending prayers to be fined 15d.”\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Assembly requested Mr. Howser “to say prayers\r\nevery morning between 6 and 7 o’clock.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the rectors. Since 1899 they have been _ex\r\nofficio_ senior canons of the cathedral.\r\n\r\n 1664–1683—Rev. Henry Howser (d. Dec. 29, 1683).\r\n 1683–1700—Rev. Philip Bennett (d. Sept. 5, 1707).\r\n 1700–1702—Rev. James Cunningham.\r\n 1702–1703–4—Rev. William Alsop (d. Jan. 10, 1703–4).\r\n 1704–1720—Richard Tabor (d. April 6, 1720).\r\n 1720–1734—Rev. John Scott (d. Nov. 22, 1734).\r\n 1735–1748—Rev. Calvin Galpine (d. Aug. 20, 1748).\r\n 1748–1764—Rev. John Venn, B.A. (d. April 6, 1764).\r\n 1764–1773—Rev. Samuel Griffiths, A.M.\r\n 1773–1788—Rev. John Lindsay, D.D. (d. Nov. 3, 1788).\r\n 1789–1791—Rev. Alexander Cumine, D.D. (d. July 18, 1791).\r\n 1791–1808—Rev. Robert Stanton Woodham, M.A.\r\n 1808–1813—Rev. Isaac Mann.\r\n 1814–1822—Rev. William Vaughan Hamilton.\r\n 1823–1843—Rev. Lewis Bowerbank, A.M.\r\n 1843–1857—Rev. Samuel Paynter Musson, D.D.\r\n 1857–1864—Rev. G. J. Handfield, M.A.\r\n 1864–1868—Rev. Joseph Williams.\r\n 1869–1875—Rev. F. S. Bradshaw, LL.D.\r\n 1876–1891—Rev. Charles Frederick Douet, A.M. (afterwards Assistant\r\n    Bishop).\r\n 1892–1900—Rev. Canon Edward Jocelyn Wortley.\r\n 1901–1904—Rev. Canon Reginald John Ripley.\r\n 1904–1908—Rev. Canon John Walton Austin.\r\n 1909–    —Rev. Canon Samuel Purcell Hendrick, M.A.\r\n\r\nTabor is referred to in “The Groans of Jamaica.”\r\n\r\nOf the Rev. John Venn, Bryan Edwards wrote an epitaph beginning:\r\n\r\n                Beneath this stone lies plain John Venn,\r\n                Neither the best, nor the worst of men;\r\n\r\nand ending:\r\n\r\n                To sum in short—yet speak in full—\r\n                Our plain John Venn was blunt John Bull.\r\n\r\nLindsay was ordained in December 1753 in Conduit Street Chapel, Hanover\r\nSquare, London; he was presented to the rectory of St. Thomas-ye-Vale,\r\nJamaica, in 1768, and was made rector of St. Catherine in 1773; and he\r\nwas made D.D. by the University of Edinburgh in the same year. He\r\nofficiated at Spanish Town till his death in 1788. The sermon which he\r\npreached at the funeral of Sir Basil Keith, the governor, in 1777, was\r\npublished. In 1770 he petitioned the House of Assembly to assist him in\r\npublishing his collection of “drawings of the most curious and beautiful\r\nplants, trees, fruits, birds, insects, fishes,” but received but cold\r\ncomfort—the House resolving that the drawings “will merit the attention\r\nof the curious in natural history.” In 1781 and 1783 he published in\r\n“The Gentleman’s Magazine,” “An Examination of the Hypothetical Doctrine\r\nof Waterspouts, in Opposition to the Ingenious Speculations of Dr. B.\r\nFranklin, of Philadelphia, F.R.S.,” which was reprinted in “The Journal\r\nof the Institute of Jamaica,” for December 1897. It is curious that one\r\nof his illustrations represents the church of St. Catherine with a tower\r\nand spire, for it had not even a tower in 1781. In the Bristol Museum\r\nare four volumes of coloured drawings of Jamaica plants and animals made\r\nby Lindsay from 1758 to 1771, many of them accompanied by descriptive\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Robert Stanton Woodham was rector in Nugent’s time, and is\r\nfrequently mentioned in Lady Nugent’s Journal. She appears to have\r\nformed no very high opinion of the clergy of the island.\r\n\r\nDr. Musson, who died in 1857, is the only rector whose resting-place is\r\nrecorded in the church.\r\n\r\nDr. C. F. Douet was for many years assistant bishop of the\r\ndiocese—1888–1904. He died in England in 1905. The stained glass window\r\nwas erected to his memory in 1914, at the same time as the Children’s\r\nwindow over the north door.\r\n\r\nAfter the Rodney memorial, the monument in the cathedral, Spanish Town,\r\nerected to the memory of the =Earl of Effingham=, governor of Jamaica,\r\nand his countess, is the most important and the most beautiful work by\r\nBacon in Jamaica. It is of marble, and bears the legend “J. Bacon,\r\nsculptor, London, 1796.”\r\n\r\nOn a base stands an urn, decorated with festoons of flowers, and\r\nbearing, under an earl’s coronet, the arms of Effingham: Quarterly, 1st\r\ngules on a bend between six cross crosslets fitchée argent, an\r\nescutcheon or, bearing a demi-lion rampant pierced through the mouth\r\nwith an arrow within a double tressure flory counterflory of the first.\r\n2nd gules three lions passant guardant in pale or (England) with a label\r\nof three points. 3rd checky, or and azure. 4th gules a lion rampant\r\nargent. In fess point of the shield a mullet for difference. Supporters\r\ntwo lions rampant. Motto, _Virtus mille scuta_. Above the urn, hanging\r\non an obelisk which rises from the base of the monument, are represented\r\nthe Chancellor’s seal, the mace and sword in saltire, and the usual\r\nemblematic scales.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the monument, clasping the urn, is an elegant female\r\nfigure personifying Jamaica, bearing the crest of the colony, an\r\nalligator passant proper, on her zone. On the other side is a lovely\r\nboy, his left hand holding an olive branch, resting on a cornucopia full\r\nof tropical fruits, and his right hand upon a shield bearing the arms of\r\nJamaica as granted by Charles II, viz,: Argent on a cross gules five\r\npineapples proper.

Motto, _Indus\r\nuterque serviet uni_. The epitaph, written by Bryan Edwards, the\r\nhistorian of the West Indies, and then member of Assembly for Trelawny,\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n  TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n  THOMAS EARL OF EFFINGHAM BARON HOWARD, CAPTAIN GENERAL AND CHIEF\r\n  GOVERNOR OF THIS ISLAND IN THE YEARS 1790 AND 1791, AND OF CATHERINE\r\n  HIS WIFE. THE LATTER DEPARTED THIS LIFE ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF\r\n  OCTOBER, 1791, IN A VOYAGE UNDERTAKEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER HEALTH,\r\n  IN HIS MAJESTY’S SHIP DIANA: THE FORMER ON THE 19TH OF THE FOLLOWING\r\n  MONTH, THE THIRD WEEK AFTER THE MELANCHOLY RETURN OF THE DIANA WITH\r\n  THE REMAINS OF HIS BELOVED CONSORT, WHOM HE SEEMED UNWILLING TO\r\n  SURVIVE, AND WITH WHOM HE WAS DEPOSITED IN THE SAME GRAVE, THUS,\r\n  UNITED IN THEIR LIVES BY THE MOST TENDER AND EXALTED TIES,\r\n\r\n                  HE—THE FOND AND INDULGENT HUSBAND,\r\n                  SHE—THE CHEERFUL AND OBEDIENT WIFE—\r\n                  IN THEIR DEATHS THEY WERE NOT DIVIDED.\r\n\r\n  TO PERPETUATE THE REMEMBRANCE OF SO ILLUSTRIOUS A PATTERN OF CONJUGAL\r\n  AFFECTION, TO MANIFEST THE PUBLIC SENSE OF THE MANY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE\r\n  VIRTUES OF THEIR RESPECTED GOVERNOR, AND TO RECORD FOR THE BENEFIT OF\r\n  POSTERITY THE CLEARNESS OF THAT SAGACITY, THE EXTENT OF THAT\r\n  KNOWLEDGE, AND THE PURITY AND FIRMNESS OF THAT INTEGRITY, WHICH\r\n  RENDERED HIS ADMINISTRATION THE BOAST AND SECURITY OF A GRATEFUL\r\n  PEOPLE; THE ASSEMBLY OF JAMAICA, HAVING CAUSED THE REMAINS OF THIS\r\n  NOBLE AND LAMENTED PAIR TO BE INTERR’D WITH FUNERAL HONOURS AT THE\r\n  PUBLIC EXPENSE, THE WHOLE HOUSE ATTENDING EACH PROCESSION AS MOURNERS,\r\n  AS A FURTHER TESTIMONY OF MERITED ESTEEM, INSCRIBE THIS MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nBy an Act passed in 1789, burying in churches had been recently\r\nprohibited, and a penalty of £500 imposed on any rector permitting such\r\nburial; but two bills, dispensing with that Act and indemnifying the\r\nRev. Robert Stanton Woodham, the then lately appointed rector of St.\r\nCatherine, from its penalties in the special cases of the Earl and\r\nCountess were introduced in the Assembly by Bryan Edwards and passed\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nOn November 19 the House “resolved, _nem. con._, in order to testify the\r\ngrateful respect which this House entertain of his late Excellency’s\r\nmerit and virtues, his firm and independent conduct, and the sense they\r\nhave of the great and universal satisfaction which his mild and\r\nequitable administration, in every department, gave to all ranks of\r\npeople, and the regret which they feel at his loss, that the funeral of\r\nthe late Earl of Effingham be conducted at the public expense”; and on\r\nDecember 7, 1791, the Assembly voted £500 sterling toward this monument.\r\nThe monument, together with the two funerals, which were attended by the\r\nmembers of the Assembly, cost the island £8700.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thomas Warren, rector of St. Elizabeth, and domestic chaplain\r\nto the governor—the same Thomas Warren who ten years later disgusted\r\nLady Nugent by his toadyism while conducting the service at Black\r\nRiver-preached the funeral sermons, which are given in the “Columbian\r\nMagazine or Monthly Miscellany” published in Kingston in June 1797.\r\n\r\nThe Earl and Countess of Effingham arrived at Port Royal on March 17,\r\n1790, in the ship _Catherine Countess of Effingham_. During his short\r\nperiod of governorship the condition of Jamaica was the cause of some\r\nanxiety owing to the nearness of the republican movement in San Domingo;\r\nso much so, that during the Christmas holidays of 1791 two ships of war\r\npatrolled round the island. The National Assembly of France passed a\r\ndecree of thanks to the King of Great Britain, to the English nation,\r\nand to Lord Effingham, governor of Jamaica, for his generous conduct in\r\nrelieving the planters of St. Domingo from the horrors of famine, and in\r\nfurnishing them with arms and military stores against the rebel negroes.\r\nIt was during Effingham’s governorship that the bread-fruit and other\r\ntrees were imported from the south seas, and a collection of Jamaica\r\nplants was sent home to Kew Gardens.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly addressed the governor on the subject of proposed\r\nadditional duties by England on sugar and rum, but to their\r\nrepresentations the governor made a diplomatic reply.\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s mother was daughter of Peter Beckford, speaker of the\r\nAssembly, and sister to the celebrated lord mayor of London. His wife,\r\nwhom he married in 1765, was the daughter of Metcalfe Proctor, of\r\nThorpe, near Leeds. They had no children.\r\n\r\nNext to the Effingham monument that to the =Countess of Elgin= is the\r\nmost interesting from an art point of view.\r\n\r\nIn April 1841, Elizabeth Mary, the twenty-year-old daughter of Charles\r\nLennox Cumming Bruce, was married to Lord Bruce, the son of the earl of\r\n“Elgin Marbles” fame. He had the year before become heir to the earldom\r\nthrough the death of his elder half-brother; and in the July following\r\nhe was elected member of Parliament for Southampton, and succeeded to\r\nthe title in the November of the same year (1841), becoming a peer of\r\nScotland without a seat in the House of Lords. In the April of the\r\nfollowing year he was made governor of Jamaica at the early age of\r\nthirty-one years, and there served his apprenticeship to his greater\r\nwork as governor-general of Canada and viceroy of India. He experienced\r\na period of depression, owing to the effects of emancipation, and of\r\nstorms and floods; but in spite of difficulties he endeavoured, not\r\nwithout success, to improve the social conditions and develop the\r\nindustrial resources of the island. The Royal Agricultural Society of\r\nJamaica (later merged into the Royal Society of Arts and Agriculture of\r\nJamaica) and several parochial agricultural associations were\r\nestablished by him; the first batch of coolies arrived from India in\r\n1845, and the railway was opened for traffic in the same year.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the countess within less than a twelvemonth of her\r\nlanding, and after a little more than two years of married life, the\r\nHouse of Assembly voted three hundred guineas for a monument to be\r\nerected in the cathedral at Spanish Town. It was carved by Sir John\r\nSteell, and is inscribed on the back “Jn. Steell, Sculptor, Edinr.,\r\n1849.” He is best known for his statues in Edinburgh of Sir Walter Scott\r\nand the Prince Consort, and for his colossal statue of Burns in New\r\nYork. The first-named is said to have been the first marble statue\r\ncommissioned in Scotland from a native artist; the second secured him\r\nhis knighthood. Steell in early life patriotically declined Chantrey’s\r\nflattering offer to remove from Edinburgh to London, in order that he\r\nmight devote himself to the improvement of the art of his native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHis busts are said to be distinguished by great dignity and refinement.\r\nThese characteristics are evident in his posthumous portrait of Lady\r\nElgin.\r\n\r\nThe following is the inscription on the monument:\r\n\r\n  IN MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n  ELIZABETH MARY, COUNTESS OF ELGIN AND KINCARDINE, ONLY CHILD OF\r\n  CHARLES LENNOX CUMMING BRUCE, ESQR., OF ROSEISLE AND KINNAIRD IN\r\n  SCOTLAND, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE COUNTIES OF ELGIN AND NAIRN,\r\n  AND OF MARY ELIZABETH BRUCE. GRANDDAUGHTER AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE\r\n  DISTINGUISHED TRAVELLER IN ABYSSINIA. BORN ON THE 13TH APRIL, 1821,\r\n  SHE WAS MARRIED ON THE 22ND APRIL, 1841, AND HAVING ACCOMPANIED HER\r\n  HUSBAND, HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES EARL OF ELGIN AND KINCARDINE, TO\r\n  JAMAICA, IN APRIL, 1842, SHE DIED AT CRAIGTON, IN THE PARISH OF ST.\r\n  ANDREW’S, ON THE 7TH JUNE, 1843: RESTING WITH ASSURED FAITH ON THE\r\n  LOVE OF HER REDEEMER, AMIDST THE UNSPEAKABLE SORROW OF HER RELATIVES\r\n  AND FRIENDS, AND THE DEEP LAMENT OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAD WITNESSED\r\n  THE RICH PROMISE OF HER EARLY VIRTUES. THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED BY\r\n  THE LEGISLATURE OF THE COLONY NOT AS A COLD TRIBUTE OF RESPECT DUE TO\r\n  EXALTED RANK, BUT TO MARK THE PUBLIC REGRET, FOR DISTINGUISHED WORTH\r\n  AND TALENT, SO EARLY LOST TO HER COUNTRY AND HER FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  “BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD.”\r\n\r\nCraigton, used as a mountain residence by the Earl of Elgin, is in the\r\nBlue Mountains, by the fourteenth milestone on the driving road to\r\nNewcastle.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from Professor Wrong’s “Earl of Elgin” tells in a\r\nfew words the sad cause of Lady Elgin’s death:\r\n\r\n  In April 1842 Lord Elgin left England for Jamaica. On the way he\r\n  experienced the dramatic and, for him, tragic consequences of\r\n  shipwreck; the steamer struck on the coral reefs surrounding Turk’s\r\n  Island, one of the Bahamas, and became a total wreck. No lives were\r\n  lost, but Lady Elgin received a shock from which she never recovered.\r\n  When, in the following summer, she died in Jamaica, Lord Elgin was so\r\n  prostrated by grief that his recovery seemed doubtful. He was left\r\n  with one infant daughter. From utter loneliness the society of his own\r\n  kindred saved him; with him were his sister Charlotte, afterwards Lady\r\n  Charlotte Locker, and his brother Robert, the latter as his Secretary.\r\n  Though living chiefly at the country house, Craighton (sic), in the\r\n  Blue Mountains, he did not neglect holding at Spanish Town, then the\r\n  capital of Jamaica, the receptions and entertainments which must be a\r\n  heavy burden upon the time and patience of those in high official\r\n  position. The life was sufficiently monotonous, and after three years\r\n  he longed for more active employment.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of Lady Elgin’s death was the birth of an infant\r\ndaughter, who only lived a few hours. Her only surviving child, Elma,\r\nmarried Baron Thurlow.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the actual spot where the body is interred, we read in\r\nthe “Morning Journal” of June 1843:\r\n\r\n  His Honour, the Chief Justice, the Custos, and several other\r\n  officials, then proceeded to the selection of a proper place for the\r\n  sepulture of her Ladyship. The spot they selected was immediately\r\n  below the Communion Table, in the Cathedral, and in which the remains\r\n  of the Earl and Countess of Effingham were interred in 1791. The\r\n  excavation took place under the superintendence of His Honor the\r\n  Custos, assisted by Mr. Churchwarden M’Anuff; and about five o’clock\r\n  on Thursday morning the vaulting and arches were complete.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was attended by all the high officials, civil, naval and\r\nmilitary, and by the members of the House of Assembly.\r\n\r\nThough the present =House of Assembly= probably only dates from about\r\nthe same period as King’s House (1762) or a little later, the Assembly\r\nalways met (with a slight diversion, in favour of Kingston, under\r\nAdmiral Knowles in 1755) in Spanish Town, and the old capital was thus\r\nassociated with the story of the long series of struggles which took\r\nplace between the people’s representatives and the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn 1702 the Assembly met at the Queen’s House and at the Court House. In\r\nhis speech to the Assembly on September 5, 1706, Handasyd said, “That\r\nthe public building, I mean the Assembly House, being ready to fall, I\r\ndon’t doubt but you will give orders for the rebuilding of the same.”\r\n\r\nIn 1728 the Duchess of Portland, widow of the late Governor, gave a\r\nportrait of George I to the Assembly. It was hung over the speaker’s\r\nchair. One wonders where it now is.\r\n\r\nOne of the most dramatic incidents which ever happened during a session\r\nof the Assembly is that which caused the death of Peter Beckford, a\r\nformer lieutenant-governor of the colony, the president of the Council,\r\nand the first custos of Kingston.\r\n\r\nThe incident is thus described by Bridges:\r\n\r\n  During a warm debate in the Assembly on June 8, 1711, on the right of\r\n  adjournment for a longer period than _de die in diem_, Peter Beckford,\r\n  the Speaker (son of the President), repeatedly called to order; and\r\n  was at length compelled to enforce it by adjournment. But irritation\r\n  had gone so far that, when he rose to quit the chair, the Members drew\r\n  their swords and held him there, while the obnoxious questions in\r\n  debate were put and carried. The doors were barred; the uproar was\r\n  alarming; and the Speaker’s father heard the disturbance in the\r\n  Council Chamber. He recognised the voice of his son crying aloud for\r\n  help, and rushed into the Governor’s apartment. Sir Thomas Handasyde\r\n  seized his sword, ordered the sentinels to follow him, forced the door\r\n  of the Court House, and dissolved the Assembly in the Queen’s name.\r\n  But the fray was fatal to the elder Beckford; in his agitation his\r\n  foot slipped, and he was precipitated down the staircase, and the\r\n  effects of terror were deadly to his aged frame.\r\n\r\nFrom this account we incidentally learn that the Assembly then had no\r\nHouse of its own and met in the court house, which probably stood where\r\nthe present court house stands, at the south side of the square; the\r\nHouse of Assembly being on the east side, the King’s House on the west,\r\nand Rodney’s memorial on the north. In 1679 the church was first used as\r\na House of Assembly, and was so used occasionally, as well as the court\r\nhouse, till its destruction by hurricane in 1712.\r\n\r\nIn “A View of the Proceedings of the Assemblies of Jamaica for some\r\nyears past,” published in London in 1716, occurs a letter dated from\r\nKingston, December 4, 1715, which begins, “The Grand Court is Sitting,\r\nas also the Assembly (who as former Assemblies have done in Court time)\r\nSit in the Great Church [at Spanish Town]....”\r\n\r\nThe speaker alluded to above, Peter Beckford, held that office no less\r\nthan four times. He will ever be remembered, in Spanish Town at all\r\nevents, as the founder of Beckford and Smith’s School.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of any detailed reference to the continual\r\nstruggles which took place between the Assembly and the Governor in\r\nCouncil, or the Assembly and the Crown, for in some cases the Assembly\r\nfound governors who from the larger knowledge gained by local experience\r\nwere in sympathy with many of their claims for equitable treatment. But\r\nwe may perhaps for a moment try to picture to ourselves the scene at the\r\nopening of an assembly a hundred years ago. There were then forty-three\r\nmembers representing twenty constituencies or parishes. Of these all but\r\na few came from outside Spanish Town, and had perforce to find temporary\r\nhomes for themselves, their servants, and their horses: and the old\r\ncapital must have offered a gay appearance. If the member for noble St.\r\nJames did not drive his own horses it must have cost him some £8 to £10\r\nto post.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Feurtado mentions ten lodging-houses and six hotels or\r\ntaverns as existing at the time of the removal of the Government from\r\nSpanish Town to Kingston in 1870; but it is somewhat curious that,\r\nthough travellers and historians have recorded the names of some ten or\r\ntwelve taverns throughout the colony in the eighteenth century, no\r\nmention is made of any such institution of importance in the old\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the lieutenant-governor was Lieutenant-General Edward Morrison.\r\nHis secretary was William Bullock, who later, under the Duke of\r\nManchester, became a great pluralist and wielded much power. The speaker\r\nof the Assembly was James Lewis, who represented St. Catherine. John\r\nJacques, the mayor, was one of Kingston’s three representatives. St.\r\nAndrew sent as one member a James Stewart, Trelawny sent another James\r\nStewart, and Westmoreland a third—which suggests numerous pitfalls for\r\nthe unwary student of genealogy—while a fourth Stewart, John by name,\r\nsat for St. Ann. John Shand, the custos of St. Catherine, represented\r\nSt. John. One of Vere’s members was J. P. Edwards, while Robert Allwood\r\ncame up from St. Elizabeth. Hanover was represented by a Scarlett.\r\nPortland sent two Minots. The wealthy and powerful Simon Taylor\r\nrepresented St. Thomas-in-the-East, where most of his property lay.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Assembly were: _Clerk_, F. Smith; _Serjeant-at-arms\r\nand Librarian_, John Clement; _Chaplain_, Isaac Mann (rector of St.\r\nCatherine); _Printer_, A. Aikman; and _Doorkeeper_, J. Wintle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KING’S HOUSE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COURT HOUSE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RODNEY MEMORIAL\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY\r\n]\r\n\r\n                        THE SQUARE, SPANISH TOWN\r\n\r\nThe president of the Council, which was not infrequently recruited from\r\nthe Assembly, was John Lewis, the chief justice, a relative of the\r\nwell-known “Monk” Lewis; and other members (twelve in all) bore the\r\nwell-known Jamaica names of Broadbelt, Ross, Pinnock, Cuthbert,\r\nScarlett, Nembhardt and Jackson. Its chaplain was the Rev. John Campbell\r\n(rector of St. Andrew). Its librarian was Alexander Dallas, a relation\r\nof the author of the “History of the Maroons.” The Assembly opened daily\r\nwith prayer.\r\n\r\nUntil 1842, when a new judicature law, which transferred to a\r\nvice-chancellor the authority of chancellor, came into force, the\r\ngovernor for the time being was _ex-officio_ chancellor of the island,\r\nand sat in a Chancellor’s Court which was held in the Egyptian hall of\r\nRing’s House.\r\n\r\nAt its first session the House was wont to go over “in grand\r\nprocession”—the speaker preceded by the macebearer with the mace—to\r\nKing’s House at 4 P.M. to hear the governor read his speech. They then\r\nreturned and deliberated on the speech, to which they sent a reply. They\r\nformally elected a speaker. He was wont to plead his unworthiness but\r\nallowed himself to be over-persuaded, and the governor gave his\r\napproval. After the passing of many compliments the pendulum not\r\ninfrequently swung round to the point of contention and bickering, but\r\nmany of the Assembly honestly did their best in legislating for the\r\nwell-being of the colony. To do honour to Sir Henry Barkly the Assembly\r\nturned their hall into a ballroom, each member subscribing £10 toward\r\nthe cost of the entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the House committed to jail, where he was kept for upwards of\r\ntwenty-four hours, one of the judges of the supreme court, William\r\nStevenson (afterwards governor of Mauritius), for an alleged breach of\r\nprivilege in writing a letter to the public press, in which he accused\r\nthem of violating public faith and confiscating the property of public\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAn English merchant describing Jamaica in 1726 says, “Nor is the keeping\r\nof a coach and six any more credit than keeping a horse in England, it\r\nis so common in the lowlands where the roads will admit”; and, even\r\nwithin the memory of those living, members of the Council and Assembly\r\nwere wont to drive into Spanish Town in style. The late Mr. Judah, in\r\n“Old St. Jago” (1894), says:\r\n\r\n  We come to so late as 1848–49 when Sir Charles Grey was Governor. He\r\n  rode in a State Coach drawn by four horses, and had outriders as part\r\n  of his equipage. Besides coachman and groom he had two footmen behind\r\n  his coach holding, in their dignity, their straps in holders; all in\r\n  splendid livery. When the Honourable James Gayleard was President of\r\n  the Council, he rode too in State Coach and pair, with coachman and\r\n  groom on the box and a footman behind standing with strap and holder,\r\n  all too in livery. Sir Joshua Rowe, Chief Justice, in his stately\r\n  barouche with liveried servants. The Honourable William Church\r\n  Macdougall driving in uniform with high-booted postilion. The\r\n  Honourable Alexandre Bravo, always arriving in town on the first day\r\n  of the meeting of the Council, of which he was a member, with four in\r\n  hand, his wife and then young family inside, himself on the driving\r\n  box with his son Alexandre, afterwards Major and Acting Governor in\r\n  one of Her Majesty’s Colonies in Africa, seated beside him; while Mr.\r\n  Moses Bravo followed with his wife, driving a gay and attractive\r\n  tandem. “Old Saint Jago” has its traditions, and is full of memories\r\n  of the old past and the greater days of Jamaica. A hundred of these\r\n  memories as it were pass before my eyes, and I feel a real pleasure in\r\n  recalling some of them, associated as they are with the days of my\r\n  boyhood and my early manhood. I well remember the first day of the\r\n  inauguration of a new Governor, attended at old King’s House by all\r\n  the heads of departments and highest officials of the colony. The\r\n  Lieutenant-Governor, who was always then the Major-General commanding\r\n  the Forces in this island, and his brilliant staff, the Admiral with\r\n  his staff, the Commodore on the station—the whole in full dress\r\n  uniform. The Bishop with his mitre on, and his black silk gown with\r\n  ample lawn sleeves. The three Archdeacons in their full college dress\r\n  and honours. The Chief Justice and Puisne Judges in their purple\r\n  robes. The Registrar in Chancery and Clerk of Patents, gowned in black\r\n  silk and bearing on a scarlet velvet cushion the insignia in gold of\r\n  Equity and of his office. The Clerk of the Crown and Supreme Court\r\n  with parchment scroll surmounted by the British Crown in gold. The\r\n  Military and Navy in full dress uniform. The foreign Consuls also in\r\n  uniform—those of Spain, France, Austria, and the Mosquito territory\r\n  being most conspicuous for their splendour. The three members of “the\r\n  mixed Commission” (for the adjudication of cases arising out of the\r\n  slave trade treaties) in their peculiar dress of white kerseymeres\r\n  trimmed in silver, and their silver-sheathed swords suspended in fine\r\n  silver chains. The military band of music arriving from the barracks,\r\n  at the head of the regiment, with standards flying and taking up their\r\n  position in the present garden on the left hand opposite to the front\r\n  of the King’s House. During the administration of the usual oaths to\r\n  the new Governor the playing of the National Anthem, and this followed\r\n  by a salvo of fourteen guns from two field pieces positioned in front\r\n  of Rodney’s statue, then on its original site, under the dome of the\r\n  colonnade, at the north side of the public square.\r\n\r\n  Then there was the opening day of the annual meeting of the\r\n  Legislature, with almost the like pageantry and with the members of\r\n  the Privy Council in Windsor uniform, and the members of the\r\n  Legislative Council, attended by “Black Rod” in full Court dress with\r\n  his _chapeau bras_. The entrance of the Governor into the Egyptian\r\n  Hall of King’s House, in full military dress as Captain-General and\r\n  Commander-in-Chief, attended by his Secretary in Windsor uniform, and\r\n  his aide-de-camp in full military dress. The despatch of “Black Rod”\r\n  by the Governor, summoning the Assembly to attend him in the Council\r\n  Chamber. The arrival of “Black Rod” at the bar of the Assembly Hall,\r\n  delivering the message, and his retiring backways, making his\r\n  obeisance three times to the Chair while retiring. The attendance of\r\n  the Speaker and the whole House, headed by the Serjeant-at-Arms\r\n  carrying, with head covered by his _chapeau bras_, the large gilt mace\r\n  of the House, and with his ivory-hilted sword at side, while the band\r\n  plays the grand and stately “God Save the Queen.” These pageantries\r\n  followed by a grand dinner at King’s House to the Lieutenant-Governor\r\n  and staff, Admiral and staff, Chief Justice, Bishop, and the high\r\n  officials of the day.\r\n\r\nThe mace mentioned above is now in the history gallery in the Institute\r\nof Jamaica.\r\n\r\nTradition has it that the old house known as =Eagle House=, behind the\r\nPublic Hospital in King street, Spanish Town, was the residence of\r\nWilliam O’Brien, second earl of Inchiquin, who was governor of Jamaica\r\nin 1690–91–2. Its local name, from the remaining eagle that surmounts\r\none of the gate-posts, is John Crow House; John Crow being the popular\r\ndesignation of the vulture of Jamaica (_Cathartes aura_).\r\n\r\nA discussion on the subject of this house took place in the “Gleaner”\r\nnewspaper during August and September 1911, with the result that, though\r\nsome light was thrown on the subject, nothing was settled for certain.\r\nMr. G. F. Judah, whose antiquarian knowledge of Jamaica was unequalled,\r\ninformed us that his father told him that when he first visited the\r\nhouse as a boy in 1808–9 both eagles were _in situ_; but that when he\r\nwent to reside in Spanish Town in 1830–31 only one remained; and further\r\nthat tradition said that it had once been the residence of Sir James de\r\nCastillo, the agent of the Assiento Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Judah seemed to think that “Eagle House” is identical with the “Fort\r\nHouse,” which he told us was granted first in 1662 to Sir Charles\r\nLyttelton, deputy governor to Lord Windsor, being the first of the\r\nrecords of Patents in the island, and dating only seven years after the\r\nBritish occupation. Lyttelton sold it to Charles Brayne, who sold it to\r\nSir Thomas Modyford. Modyford’s nephew succeeded to the baronetcy and\r\nhis executors sold the “Fort House” in 1715 to John Stewart, president\r\nof the Council, who had the title to the house confirmed by a special\r\nact of the Legislature in 1733. From an act which was passed in 1736 it\r\nappears that the Fort House bounded north-east on a street between a\r\nstorehouse belonging to John Stewart, Esquire, and the dwelling-house\r\nformerly belonging to Arnold Brown, Esquire, deceased, to the Parade;\r\nsouth-east on land belong to William Careless, Esquire, deceased;\r\nsouth-west on the town Savanna; and north-west on the land lately\r\nbelonging to Ursula Hunt, widow, deceased, by indenture.\r\n\r\nIt was conveyed to Thomas Brayne, descended to his daughter, Mary\r\nElizabeth, wife of Alexander Henderson. They conveyed it to Walter\r\nThomas, and he and his wife conveyed it to John Stewart. Stewart sold it\r\nto Robert Delap (nephew of Francis Delap, provost marshal), and the\r\nplace subsequently fell into the hands of Bogle & Co., of which firm\r\nMichael Scott, the well-known author of “Tom Cringle’s Log,” was a\r\nmember. It then passed successively into the possession of Alexander\r\nYoung, William Taylor and Robert Nichol. Mr. Oscar Plummer, quoting from\r\nmanuscripts in his possession, of which however he gave no details, said\r\nthat various personages—Robert Russell, Andrew Gregory Johnson, and\r\nRichard Hill—in the earlier part of the nineteenth century, gave\r\ncredence to the legend that Eagle House was the residence of the Earl of\r\nInchiquin, and that some of them alluded to Eagle House as the Moat\r\nHouse. In this case, although there is no proof, it is quite likely that\r\nthe legend that Inchiquin inhabited it is true; but it is not likely\r\nthat much of the old fabric remains, though the present house is of\r\nconsiderable antiquity. There is nothing in all this to aid in the\r\nidentification of Eagle House with the residence of Lord Inchiquin; but\r\nas the rent for the house he occupied was paid to Samuel Bernard, the\r\nchief justice, it was probably not identical with Fort House, which, as\r\nwe have seen, belonged to the Modyfords.\r\n\r\nThe early life of the Earl of Inchiquin was spent with his father in\r\nforeign military service, during which he lost an eye and suffered\r\nimprisonment in Algiers. In 1764 he was appointed captain-general of the\r\nKing’s forces in Africa, and governor and vice-admiral of the royal\r\ncitadel of Tangier, ceded by the Portuguese to Britain as part of the\r\nmarriage portion of Catherine of Braganza. He held the post for six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nInchiquin welcomed the Prince of Orange in 1688, and in the following\r\nyear he and his son were attainted by the Irish Parliament of James II,\r\nand their estates were sequestrated. He appealed to arms, but was\r\ndefeated and fled to England.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution he was appointed governor of Jamaica. On going to\r\ntake up office he was allowed £500 in lieu of fifty tons of baggage, and\r\nalso passage and victuals for seventy-five menial servants. It is\r\ninteresting to note that on his journey he drew half-pay salary (_i.e._\r\nat the rate of £1000 a year).\r\n\r\nHe, after escaping great dangers by sea and a malignant fever brought on\r\nboard by the soldiers embarked at Plymouth, arrived at Jamaica,\r\naccompanied by Lady Inchiquin, on May 31, 1690, in H.M.S. _Swan_, “so\r\nbad a sailor that she is little better than nothing”—the same ship that\r\nwas “forced over the tops of many houses” in the earthquake of two years\r\nlater. Inchiquin was sworn in as governor on the same day.\r\n\r\nHe met with considerable opposition from a portion of the Assembly,\r\nwhose temper had been ruffled by Albemarle’s arbitrary government, and\r\nwhom he treated in a somewhat tactless manner. That, added to troubles\r\narising from incursions by French cruisers on the seaside\r\nplantations—the result of the war—plunderings by the runaway slaves, the\r\noriginal maroons, and an outbreak of slaves in Clarendon, undermined his\r\nconstitution. Nineteen months of worry were terminated by his death, on\r\nSaturday, January 16, 1691–2, “after long indisposition through fever\r\nand plague which ended in a flux”; he was buried that night in the\r\nparish church at St. Jago de la Vega. Until recently no monument marked\r\nthe spot. A memorial brass has now, however, been erected in the\r\ncathedral by Lord Inchiquin with the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                              IN MEMORY OF\r\n                 WILLIAM O’BRIEN, 2ND EARL OF INCHIQUIN\r\n                          GOVERNOR OF JAMAICA\r\n            FROM 31ST MAY, 1690, TILL 16TH JANUARY, 1691–2.\r\n            _When he died of fever at St. Jago de la Vega_,\r\n                     AND WAS BURIED IN THIS CHURCH\r\n           ERECTED IN 1912 BY LUCIUS W. XVTH BARON INCHIQUIN.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his governorship of Tangier, Inchiquin has been\r\ndescribed as “a well-meaning impulsive man, devoid of discretion,” and\r\nthis description seems equally applicable to his Jamaica career.\r\n\r\nBy his first wife, Lady Margaret Boyle, daughter of the first Earl of\r\nOrrery, he had three sons, of whom the third, James, was a member of the\r\nCouncil of Jamaica, Captain of Fort Charles, and chief of an expedition\r\nthat destroyed French settlements in Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nJames O’Brien returned to England at his father’s death.\r\n\r\nFor the first thirty-four years of British occupation, the governors of\r\nJamaica lived partly at Spanish Town and partly at Port Royal. In 1675\r\nthe Assembly voted £500 to be employed in buying the house Lord Vaughan\r\nlived in at Spanish Town “for the Governor’s use for ever.”\r\n\r\nOn January 13, 1690, however, the President and Council passed an “Order\r\nfor hiring a house in Port Royal and for provision for the reception of\r\nLord Inchiquin.”\r\n\r\nOn March 27, 1690, they passed an “Order for King’s House to be made\r\nready for Lord Inchiquin,” but the Order does not state whether Port\r\nRoyal or St. Jago de la Vega was meant, probably the latter.\r\n\r\nOn June 18 it was resolved that “Their Majesties’ house at St. Jago de\r\nla Vega being extremely out of repair and almost ruinous so it is in no\r\nmanner fit for the reception of His Excellency, it was decided by the\r\nBoard if His Excellency would be pleased to let it be ordered, and it is\r\nhereby ordered that the rent of the house where His Excellency now lives\r\nbe paid out of their Majesties’ revenue for the island till the other be\r\nso repaired or built, that it may be fit for his reception.”\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 1690, it was “ordered that £600 be allowed for building\r\nan addition to the King’s House on Port Royal to be paid out of their\r\nMajesties’ revenue for this island.”\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1691–2, just after the death of Lord Inchiquin, the\r\nCouncil wrote home to the Lords of Trade and Plantations: “We beg that\r\nthe Governor’s residence may be fixed at St. Jago de la Vega, which is\r\nthe most convenient place.”\r\n\r\nAt a Council meeting on March 15, 1691–2, it was ordered that £250 be\r\npaid to Samuel Bernard for “rent of the house the Earl of Inchiquin,\r\nlate Governor, lived in at the Towne of St. Jago de la Vega.”\r\n\r\nOn May 9, 1692, just after the earthquake, the Council made an “Order\r\nfor agreement as to the goods belonging to the late Governor at King’s\r\nHouse, for the accommodation of the next Governor,” and on June 24, they\r\npassed an “Order for material for rebuilding King’s House.” This\r\npresumably refers to St. Jago de la Vega.\r\n\r\nOn July 8 of that year the Lords of Trade and Plantations at a meeting\r\nat which Beeston, who was then agent for Jamaica in England, and was\r\nsoon to be appointed lieutenant-governor, was in attendance, resolved\r\nthat the “King’s House at St. Jago de la Vega should be sold, and the\r\nproceeds devoted to the purchase of another house”—at the very time that\r\nit was probably being rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOn the Earl of Inchiquin’s death, the Government bought of Lady\r\nInchiquin for the use of the Government, goods to the value of £90.\r\nThese included the “King and Queen’s picture” valued at £20. Where is\r\nthat picture now?\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in the contemporary manuscript Council\r\nMinutes the name Inchiquin is always spelt phonetically Insiquin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sir Hans Sloane= studied botany, materia medica, and pharmacy, in\r\nEngland and France. It is said that, before consenting to accompany\r\nAlbemarle, the newly appointed governor, to Jamaica in 1687, he\r\nconsulted Sydenham on the subject, and that the father of English\r\nmedicine told him that he had better drown himself in Rosamond’s Pond, a\r\nsheet of water in St. James’s Park, which was then a fashionable resort\r\nfor intending suicides. He, however, decided to come. While in Jamaica\r\nhe attended, in addition to the duke’s “numerous family,” many people\r\nprofessionally, including the whilom buccaneering governor, Morgan;\r\nmaking in his reports very frank references to their mode of life.\r\n\r\nIn fifteen months he collected 800 plants, most of which were new\r\nspecimens; of these he published, in 1696, his “Catalogus Plantarum.” On\r\nApril 16, 1691, Evelyn writes: “I went to see Dr. Sloane’s curiosities,\r\nbeing a universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica,\r\nconsisting of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells,\r\nanimals and insects, collected with great judgement; several folios of\r\ndried plants, and one which had about eighty several sorts of ferns and\r\nanother of grasses; the Jamaica pepper in branch, leaves, flower, fruit,\r\n&c. This collection, with his Journal, and other philosophical and\r\nnatural discourses and observations, indeed very copious and\r\nextraordinary, sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which\r\nI encouraged him.” In 1707 and 1725 Sloane issued two large volumes\r\nentitled, “A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, St.\r\nChristopher and Jamaica, with the Natural History ... of the last of\r\nthose Islands,” with many engravings from crayon drawings. The work was\r\nparodied by the clever but drunken Dr. William King, under the title\r\n“The Present State of Physic in the Island of Cajami.”\r\n\r\nSloane’s wife, whom he married in 1695 and who died in 1724, was\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Alderman Langley and widow of Ffulk Rose, of\r\nSt. Catherine, who from 1675 to 1693 represented first St.\r\nThomas-in-the-Vale, and afterwards St. John, in the House of Assembly.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of his patron, the Duke of Albemarle, Sloane\r\nreturned to England. In 1693 he was secretary to the Royal Society, of\r\nwhich he edited the transactions for twenty years, contributing\r\ntwenty-two papers. Of these one was an account of the earthquake of 1692\r\nwhich destroyed Port Royal, already alluded to. Meantime he practised\r\nwith great success as a physician. In 1716 he was created a baronet,\r\nbeing the first physician so honoured, and made physician-general to the\r\narmy; from 1719 to 1735 he was president of the College of Physicians;\r\nand in 1727 president of the Royal Society. He bequeathed his books,\r\nmanuscripts, prints and curiosities (including his Jamaica collections)\r\nto the nation, on condition that £20,000 (or less than half of what they\r\nhad cost him) was paid to his executors. The collection formed the basis\r\nof the British Museum. He gave to the Apothecaries Company the freehold\r\nof the physic garden at Chelsea, and he assisted to start the Foundling\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nTradition points to a house (now No. 14), in what has been known as\r\nNugent Street, Spanish Town, for upwards of a century, as the residence\r\nof Sloane.\r\n\r\nIn a MS. scrap book called “The Omnibus, or Jamaica Scrap Book,” in the\r\nWest India Library of the Institute of Jamaica, dating from about 1840,\r\nthere is an account of Sir Hans Sloane, wherein it states: “This\r\ncelebrated naturalist during his stay in Jamaica resided in the old\r\nSpanish fronted building which was till about the year 1828 to be\r\ndiscerned in the lane at the back of the King’s House in Spanish Town,\r\nand which about that period came by purchase into the hands of a\r\ntradesman, who, without any respect to its former possessor, razed it to\r\nthe ground and erected upon the site a blacksmith’s shop and other\r\ntradesmen’s offices, at which period some of his etchings, were\r\ndiscovered in a ruined outhouse.” The present building is of a type that\r\nhas existed in the colony “from time.”\r\n\r\nPrevious to the building of a _King’s House_, the governors of Jamaica\r\napparently lived in whatever house they chose. From the following entry\r\nin the Council Minutes of June 16, 1684, it would appear that there were\r\nin 1683 two King’s Houses, one at Port Royal and one at Spanish Town:\r\n“Ordered that His Excellency’s order shall be sufficient warrant for\r\nissuing money for the fortifications, repair of the King’s Houses, &c.,\r\naccording to the Act of this country”; and this is confirmed by the\r\naccounts of the Receiver-General for 1684–85, which contains references\r\nto the “King’s House at Town” [Spanish Town] and the King’s House at\r\nPort Royal. In July 1689 it was reported that in the Duke of Albemarle’s\r\ntime (December 1687 to October 1688) the King’s House at Port Royal had\r\nbeen appointed for a Popish priest, Thomas Churchill, to say Mass in.\r\n\r\nIn June 1689 Colonel Hender Molesworth, who did not live to take up his\r\nposition as governor for a second term of office, suggested, in his\r\nproposals as to the government of Jamaica, that “it would be well to\r\nsell the old King’s House [presumably at Port Royal], and build a new\r\none at Spanish Town”; but in January 1690 it was ordered, as we have\r\nseen, that a house should be built in Port Royal, and provision made for\r\nthe reception of Lord Inchiquin. There was, however, a King’s House at\r\nSpanish Town in Beeston’s time. On July 8, 1692, it was decided by the\r\nLords of Trade and Plantations that “the King’s House at St. Jago de la\r\nVega should be sold, and the proceeds devoted to the purchase of another\r\nhouse”; but on July 27, 1693, Beeston wrote home: “I hope also to get\r\nthem to raise money to put King’s House at St. Jago (where I live) in\r\norder, for at present it only protects me from the sun and rain, having\r\nno convenience for horses or servants, nor room for but few in a family,\r\nand being as common as the highway. Nevertheless, my cost of living, for\r\nthe honour of the Government, is more than double what I am allowed, nor\r\nis there money nor like to be yet awhile, to pay me what I am allowed by\r\ntheir Majesty’s.”\r\n\r\nIn October 1700 he wrote home: “I am also enlarging to more than double\r\nthe King’s House, which was too little for any indifferent family, and\r\nhave taken in all the land belonging to it with a bricke wall, and have\r\nmade aditions of out houses for the reception of servants and for\r\noffices, all which will bee finished in a short time, and will be very\r\ncomodious and useful, tho’ not so beautyfull, being built not one entire\r\nfabricke, but by peices.”\r\n\r\nThere was a Queen’s House when Lord Archibald Hamilton arrived in 1711,\r\nbut it was in a “ruinous condition” and “could not be made tenable under\r\n£2000,” which was voted. The Duke of Portland (1724–6) expended £1544\r\n0_s._ 1¾_d._ over the £4000 voted on the then King’s House, but this sum\r\nwas not refunded to his widow although a committee of the Assembly\r\nrecommended it.\r\n\r\nThe original residence of the governors consisted partly of the old\r\nSpanish edifice and partly of irregular additions made from time to time\r\nby Sir William Beeston and other governors. The Spanish hall of audience\r\nwas demolished in 1761 to make way for the present building. Of it Long\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  Nothing of art or elegance graced the inside of this hall: it was\r\n  lined throughout with boards, or rather planks, unequally hewn with an\r\n  adze, none of them appearing to have undergone the embellishment of\r\n  the plane; these were rudely nailed to upright posts, which supported\r\n  the roof. The posts were for the most part crooked, not even squared,\r\n  and many of them had some remnant of their bark, but they retained for\r\n  the most part their primitive solidity. The whole of the woodwork,\r\n  indeed, seemed to have passed through no other hands than those of a\r\n  clumsy ship-carpenter.\r\n\r\nThis description might almost apply to the dwellings of the native\r\nArawâks.\r\n\r\nThe former official residence of the governors of Jamaica, or King’s\r\nHouse, as it is called, stands on the west side of the square. The plan\r\nwas designed by Craskell, the engineer of the island, and approved\r\nduring the administration of Lieutenant-Governor Henry Moore in 1759–62;\r\nbut the building was not completed until the arrival of Governor William\r\nHenry Lyttelton in 1762.\r\n\r\nThe expense of building and furnishing amounted to nearly £30,000\r\ncurrency (or £21,428 sterling), and in Long’s time (_circa_ 1774) it was\r\n“thought to be the noblest and best edifice of the kind, either in North\r\nAmerica or any of the British colonies in the West Indies.” The façade\r\nis about 200 feet long; the freestone used in the construction came from\r\nthe Hope river course in St. Andrew. The columns supporting the portico\r\nare of Portland stone, the pavement of white marble, of which much came\r\nout, as ballast, from time to time in the old sugar ships, and is still\r\nseen in many a great house and town dwelling. The following is taken\r\nfrom Long’s description of the interior:\r\n\r\n  Two principal entrances lead through it into the body of the house;\r\n  the one opens into a lobby, or ante-chamber; the other into the great\r\n  saloon, or hall of audience, which is well proportioned, the\r\n  dimensions being about 73 by 30 feet, and the height about 32; from\r\n  the ceiling, which is coved, hang two brass gilt lustres. A screen of\r\n  seven large Doric pillars divides the saloon from an upper and lower\r\n  gallery of communication, which range the whole length on the West\r\n  side; and the upper one is secured with an elegant entrelas of figured\r\n  iron work. The East or opposite side of the saloon is finished with\r\n  Doric pilasters, upon each of which are brass girandoles double-gilt;\r\n  and between each pilaster, under the windows of the Attic story, are\r\n  placed, on gilt brackets, the busts of several ancient and modern\r\n  philosophers and poets, large as life; which being in bronze, the\r\n  darkness of their complexion naturally suggests the idea of so many\r\n  Negro Caboceros, exalted to this honourable distinction for some\r\n  peculiar services rendered to the country. At the North end, over a\r\n  door which opens into the lobby, is a small moveable orchestra, made\r\n  to hold a band of music on festive occasions. The furniture below\r\n  consists of a great number of mahogany chairs and settees, sufficient\r\n  to accommodate a large company, the room being chiefly used for public\r\n  audiences, entertainments, balls, and the hearings of chancery and\r\n  ordinary. At the South end are three folding doors opening into a\r\n  spacious apartment, in which, by the Governor’s permission, the\r\n  Council usually meet; whence it has received the name of the Council\r\n  Chamber....\r\n\r\nMonk Lewis, writing in 1834, says: “The Government House is a large\r\nclumsy-looking brick building with a portico, the stucco of which has\r\nsuffered by the weather, and it can advance no pretensions to\r\narchitectural beauty.” And with this criticism one must fain agree.\r\n\r\nIn Long’s time a new governor was usually feasted for three successive\r\ndays in Spanish Town; after which he was wont to make a kind of public\r\nentry into Kingston, where more festivities were got up in his\r\nhonour—the two towns vying the one with the other; and Lady Nugent, in\r\nher Journal, makes many references to gay doings in King’s House,\r\nSpanish Town.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Queen Victoria, King’s House—in common with its\r\nyounger rival in the plain of Liguanea—remained King’s House, and did\r\nnot permanently change its name to Queen’s House, as did the official\r\nresidences of other British colonies, although in 1840 the House of\r\nAssembly alluded to the Queen’s House.\r\n\r\nWith the removal of the seat of Government the remaining glory departed\r\nfrom Spanish Town. With the exception of the year 1873, when it was\r\nutilised for a little more than twelve months by Queen’s College, of\r\nwhich Grant Allen was one of the staff, and the occupation by a\r\ntemporary tenant of recent years, King’s House has been practically\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nJamaica’s former capital is like one of her bridges, which now and\r\nagain, through the change of a rivercourse, is left to span a dry\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nIn the palmy days of old the lot of a governor and his wife could not\r\nhave been altogether a happy one. Lady Nugent writes, under date August\r\n3, 1801, soon after their arrival in the island:\r\n\r\n  Up at six. A grand breakfast at eight and a council at ten. Lord\r\n  B[alcarres] set off immediately for his country-house, called The\r\n  Penn. A salute was fired, and all due honours paid to him, as he drove\r\n  off. General Nugent then walked in procession to the House of\r\n  Assembly, and was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor and\r\n  Commander-in-Chief. Then another salute was fired, and he came back\r\n  and held a levee. I remained above stairs until four o’clock, seeing\r\n  all the proceedings from my windows, or the gallery round the Egyptian\r\n  Hall. I then went to the drawing-room, and received all the ladies of\r\n  Spanish Town, &c., the principal officers of the Navy and Army, the\r\n  members of Council, and a number of the gentlemen of the House of\r\n  Assembly, who had come to compliment the new Governor and his Lady;\r\n  bowing, curtseying, and making speeches, till six o’clock. The ladies\r\n  then dined with me in the Ball-room, and the gentlemen with General N.\r\n  in the Egyptian Hall. My guests were forty in number, with ten\r\n  gentlemen to carve for us. General N. had three or four times that\r\n  number with him; but we should not call them _our_ guests, as these\r\n  dinners were given to us by the public. I must remark the loads of\r\n  turtle, turkies, hams, and whole kids, that crowded my table, and\r\n  increased the heat of the climate. The room, too, was filled with\r\n  black servants; and all the population, I believe, both white and\r\n  black, were admitted to walk round the table, and stare at me after\r\n  dinner. They did General N. the same favour, being, I suppose, very\r\n  curious to see what sort of looking people we were; but their\r\n  curiosity added most exceedingly to the heat, and, indeed, I never\r\n  felt anything like it in all my life. At two o’clock all the ladies\r\n  took their leave, and some of the gentlemen; but General N. left those\r\n  that remained to enjoy their bottle, and he and I retired to our own\r\n  apartment, but not to rest, for the garrison gave us a grand serenade,\r\n  and the house was a scene of dancing, singing, and merriment almost\r\n  the whole night.\r\n\r\nNo wonder she writes on the following day “This day we have kept to\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n=Rodney=, who was for three and a half years commander-in-chief on the\r\nJamaica station, crowned that service by his ever-memorable victory over\r\nDe Grasse on April 12, 1782. The early days of that April had been dark\r\nindeed for Jamaica. The militia had been called up for the defence of\r\nthe capital, extra taxation had been imposed to meet the cost of\r\ndefensive preparations, and the roads had been rendered impassable by\r\nthe placing of large trees across them. After weeks of doubt and fear,\r\nRodney’s letter, written on the 14th, “between Guadaloupe and\r\nMontserrat,” announcing his victory, was received on the 25th, and fear\r\nwas replaced by rejoicing, which received additional impetus when four\r\ndays later Rodney himself appeared with his fleet, accompanied by nine\r\nprizes, including the famous _Ville de Paris_.\r\n\r\nOn February 20, 1783, the House of Assembly resolved to write to the\r\nagent of the colony in England, Stephen Fuller, desiring him “to apply\r\nto the most eminent artist in England, to prepare an elegant marble\r\nstatue of Lord Rodney, with a handsome pedestal of the same, to be\r\nerected in Spanish Town in commemoration of the glorious victory\r\nobtained by that gallant commander and the brave officers and seamen\r\nserving under him, over the French fleet on April 12, 1782.”\r\n\r\nPremiums for designs to be approved by the Royal Academy were to be\r\noffered, and the most eminent statuary employed to carry them out.\r\n\r\nInstead of an anonymous competition for premiums open to all English\r\nsculptors, which would have included the young Flaxman, who had already\r\nshown signs of genius, the Council of the Academy directed Bacon,\r\nCarlini, Nollekens, Tyler and Wilton to prepare designs. Only Bacon and\r\nTyler sent models, and the work was entrusted to Bacon, who was “at the\r\nextraordinary trouble of making two trips to Italy for the purpose of\r\nprocuring a block of marble large enough for the design.”\r\n\r\nWe read in Leslie and Taylor’s “Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds,” that the\r\nPresident, “according to Barry (letter to the Dilettanti Society, 1798),\r\nwas much disappointed at the poor result, complaining that it in some\r\nmeasure defeated the object of those who intrusted the commission to the\r\nAcademy.” But inasmuch as Bacon was recognised as the best sculptor of\r\nthe time, it is a little difficult to understand what Sir Joshua\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly voted £1000 sterling for the object, but, as is\r\nusually the case in such matters, the monument cost them considerably\r\nmore before it was completed—£5200 in fact; of which £500 was for\r\nfreight and erection.\r\n\r\nThe statue did not arrive until 1790; and in that year the inhabitants\r\nof Kingston and Port Royal, having heard with concern a report that it\r\nwas to be erected in Spanish Town, petitioned the House that it might be\r\nplaced in the Parade in Kingston. The petition says:\r\n\r\n  Conscious that such an ornament can only be adapted to decorate a\r\n  place equally conspicuous in point of situation, and convenient with\r\n  respect to proximity to those harbours which his victory graced, they\r\n  have anticipated the public approbation of seeing his statue erected\r\n  in the centre of the first commercial town in the West Indies, and,\r\n  solicitous to improve every advantage of position as well as to add\r\n  every possible embellishment to this testimony of public gratitude,\r\n  they, some time ago, subscribed a large sum of money for the purpose\r\n  of conveying water from the Hope River to the Parade of Kingston, by\r\n  means of which they propose to form a spacious basin to surround the\r\n  statue, and have lately subscribed a further considerable sum to\r\n  assist in erecting it, but are penetrated with the greatest concern,\r\n  to find a report prevails of its being intended to be placed in\r\n  Spanish Town.\r\n\r\nThe petition was rejected by the vote only of the speaker _pro tem._\r\n(William Blake), the House dividing equally; and a further sum of £3000\r\nwas voted for a “proper building” to contain it, in Spanish Town, making\r\nan expenditure of £8200. The total cost of Jamaica’s tribute to the\r\ngreat hero (including the public offices which form wings to the\r\ncolonnade, and £3650 for the purchase of the necessary land) was £30,918\r\n(currency).\r\n\r\nThis grant for a “proper building” was ill-spent. Memorial statues\r\nshould be erected “plain for all folk to see.” It is difficult to get a\r\ngood view of Rodney, placed as he is beneath a low-roofed temple which,\r\nfitting as it might be for a statue of Jupiter or Venus, ill accords\r\nwith the breezy life of a sailor; and if the good people of Kingston had\r\nbeen supported by the Assembly, Rodney’s statue would certainly have\r\nlooked better in the centre of the Parade. When it was in Kingston\r\ntemporarily from 1872 to 1889 it was on that barest of bare pedestals at\r\nthe bottom of King street (to which Lord Metcalfe has once more been\r\nrelegated) and lacked subsidiary adornment altogether.\r\n\r\nAlthough West, in 1771, broke through tradition in painting in the\r\nmatter of classic costume, and dared, to the great advantage of Art, to\r\nrepresent Wolfe and his soldiers in their own dress; and Pine painted\r\nRodney himself and his officers as they appeared on board the\r\n_Formidable_ in the dress they wore, in sculpture the result was slower,\r\nand Rodney was clothed by Bacon in the dress of a Roman, as a matter of\r\ncourse; the fondness on the part of sculptors for classic costume dying\r\nhard. Gibson, it is said, refused in the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to execute his statue of Sir Robert Peel unless he was allowed\r\nto clothe him in a toga. In general treatment Rodney’s statue is not\r\nunlike the Augustus Cæsar of the Capitol. He is clad in a short-sleeved\r\ntunic (of which the part that should cover the body is by artistic\r\nlicence omitted), and wears his paludamentum (or cloak) over his right\r\narm, He has no greaves, but wears sandals on his feet. From a torques,\r\nor necklace (usually worn by Oriental barbarians) is suspended a\r\nMedusa’s head. His left hand, holding a sword-hilt, rests on the\r\nordinary oblong shield of the Romans. His right arm is outstretched, and\r\nin his hand is a baton.\r\n\r\nOn the front panel of the pedestal is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                          GEORG. BRYDG.

On the one side is a\r\nrepresentation of Britannia protecting Jamaica, who has a shield bearing\r\nthe arms of the colony and her foot on a crocodile. The French flag\r\nappears to the right. On the other side is a representation of Britannia\r\nsitting in her chariot, with her foot on the French flag, in the grasp\r\nof a seaman. On her shield is the head of George III. On the back panel\r\nis a well-executed bas-relief of the chief feature in the great battle,\r\nshowing the sterns of the _Ville de Paris_ and the _Barfleur_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE “LADY JULIANA” IN TOW OF THE “PALLAS” IN 1782\r\n\r\n  From an aquatint by Robert Dodd\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn front of the monument, typifying the spoils of war, are two handsome\r\nbrass cannons, _Le Modeste_ and _Le Précipice_, founded at Douay in\r\n1748, by Jean Maritz, and bearing the proud legend “Nec pluribus\r\nimpar”—the motto of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe initials P. R. and B. E. refer to Philip Redwood (member of the\r\nAssembly for St. Catherine, later speaker, and afterwards chief\r\njustice), and Bryan Edwards, the historian, who selected the passages\r\nfrom Horace, cut in each side of the pedestal.\r\n\r\nOver the front arch of the superstructure is the Rodney coat-of-arms\r\ncarved in bold relief.\r\n\r\nRodney’s statue is mentioned in Cecil’s “Life of Bacon” as one of his\r\nprincipal works; and it was doubtless through the commission for this\r\nwork that Bacon gained the orders for the other monuments by him erected\r\nin Jamaica—to the Countess of Effingham, Rosa Palmer, Lady Williamson,\r\nJohn Wolmer and others.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish Town, streets named after governors, are Beckford street,\r\nNugent street, Manchester street, and Conran lane (after General Conran,\r\n1813); the origin of Adelaide street (after the Queen of that name),\r\nWilliam street (after the Prince who was later King), Brunswick street\r\n(after the Duke of Brunswick), and Nelson lane and Wellington street,\r\nare obvious.\r\n\r\nCanning lane and Melbourne lane tell of two English prime ministers. In\r\nCochrane lane we have probably a reminiscence of Sir Alexander Cochrane,\r\nwho was admiral on the Jamaica station in 1814–15. Ellis street tells of\r\nthe family of Lord Seaford who had properties in the island: the first\r\nLord Seaford having been born in Spanish Town.\r\n\r\nBarrett street recalls a family long resident in the island on the\r\nNorth-side.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. John, merged in St. Catherine since 1867, dates from\r\nthe first partition of the island under Modyford in 1664. The old name\r\nof =Guanaboa= is either Arawâk or Spanish, possibly, as Long suggests,\r\na mixture of both, but the prefix _gua_ is suggestive of an aboriginal\r\norigin. It may perhaps be formed from the Cuban Indian word meaning\r\nany kind of palm, or the native Indian word for sour-sop, guabana.\r\nGuanaboa occurs as the name of a district in Hayti. The earliest\r\nreference to the district in English days is under date July 15, 1661,\r\nwhen the justices of peace of Guanaboa were ordered by the Governor\r\nand Council “to nominate a person to sell drink at Cowhides,” and in\r\nthe map in Hickeringill’s “Jamaica View’d,” published in that year,\r\nGuanaboa is one of the four inland names given. In the earlier edition\r\nof Slaney’s map of Jamaica of 1678, published by William Berry, there\r\nis a church marked at Guanaha, north-west of Spanish-Town, but in the\r\nlater edition, published by Morden, Guanaha has been erased from the\r\nplate. Cowhides is marked on the map which accompanies the “Laws of\r\nJamaica,” of 1684, as a pen for cattle; it probably indicated the\r\nplace where the skins of the wild cattle were disposed of and possibly\r\nsurvives to-day in Cowpen estate; albeit a spot near Aylmers is still\r\ncalled Cowhide. On August 1 of the same year permission was given to\r\nCaptain Anthony Collier and Lieutenant Edward Morris “to pen their own\r\nwith other wild horses for one month, with the assistance of the\r\nofficers of Guanaboa, to whom half the wild horses are to be\r\ndelivered.” In 1663–64 to the first Assembly Guanaboa returned two\r\nmembers. One was William Clee, of whom even the erudite Roby has\r\nnothing to record. He was not a landowner in 1670. The other was\r\nThomas Freeman, who was later member for St. Thomas-in-the-East, a\r\nbrother-in-law of Colonel Cope (a member of the Council and colonel of\r\none of the seven regiments, and possibly a kinsman of Colonel Doyley)\r\nwho lived at Cope Place hard by.\r\n\r\nAmongst the representatives whom St. John sent to the Assembly were\r\nmembers of the most noted families in Jamaica history—Aylmer, Beckford,\r\nPrice, Ayscough, Rose, Brodrick, Kelly, Modd, Fuller, Beach and Shand.\r\n\r\nIn 1664 when Sir Thomas Modyford wrote home, St. John was one of the\r\nseven established parishes. By the survey of the island in 1670, it was\r\nshown to have eightythree families, and an estimated total population of\r\n996; and a rate of one penny per acre then produced £200 in the parish.\r\nThe largest landowner was John Styles with 3200 acres. Styles, in a\r\nletter to the principal Secretary of State in that year, states that\r\nJamaica “would maintain more people than the whole of England.”\r\n\r\nIn May 1675 a petition was presented by him “that his land be made a\r\ndistinct parish under the name of Styles Langley, he having left it by\r\nwill to Christ Church College, Oxford, from whence he expects it will be\r\nsupplied with preachers,” and offering to build a church. The petition\r\nwas refused on the ground that the land, which was at Magatee, was not\r\nsufficiently extensive. It was later taken from St. John and made part\r\nof St. Thomas-in-the-Vale. Research at Christ Church, Oxford, has failed\r\nto reveal any trace of Styles’s bequest.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 of the four clergymen ministering in Jamaica, at St. John’s was\r\n“Mr. Lemmings, an Englishman, lately sent by my Lord of London.” In 1675\r\n“Mr. Lemon” (evidently the same man), “a sober young man and very good\r\npreacher,” was minister at Guanaboa. “He has £100 per annum for the\r\nparish, and about as much from Colonel Coape for keeping a free school\r\nhe has erected.”\r\n\r\nIn 1682 we learn from a very interesting account of the state of the\r\nChurch in Jamaica, sent to the Bishop of London by Sir Thomas Lynch, who\r\ntook a keen interest in the cause of religion, that “St. John’s parish\r\nor Guanaboa is supplied by Mr. Lemon, who has £100 a year by law. He had\r\nsome advantages by a school built by Colonel Cope, but on the failure of\r\nthat and on his marriage to a poor gentleman’s widow he has been a\r\nlittle uneasy. However, since I came he has sold some land I gave him\r\nfor £500, so that he is in a reasonably good condition. For all I have\r\nheard he is a very honest, sober, fair-conditioned man, and esteemed the\r\nbest preacher in the island. I think he has a parsonage, but the church\r\nis decayed, and he preaches in the schoolhouse.” This reference to the\r\ndecayed condition of the church is, curiously enough, the earliest\r\ndirect evidence of the existence of a church at Guanaboa, though it was\r\nprobably one of the six churches existing in 1675. It was presumably at\r\nall events existing when Richard Guy was buried in 1681, the earliest\r\ndated tombstone in the church; but it is curious that there is no mark\r\nfor a church at Guanaboa in the map of 1684 above referred to. The\r\nexisting register of baptisms, marriages and burials only goes back as\r\nfar as 1751. Part of the original fabric probably exists in the present\r\nbuilding, which only dates from about 1845, the older church having been\r\nburnt down shortly before then.\r\n\r\nRoby, in his “History of the Parish of St. James” (1849), says, “In a\r\nwood near Aylmer’s in St. John’s, is a monument inscribed, under arms\r\n(the colours added) sable, a chevron erminois, between three spear-heads\r\nargent, embrued at the points, proper. Crest, a dragon’s head vert,\r\nerased gules, holding in its mouth a sinister hand, erect, couped,\r\ndropping blood from the wrist, all proper.”\r\n\r\nRoby gives the inscription with, marvellous to relate, one or two\r\nmistakes, _e.g._ _He_ for _Who_ in the fourth line; _High_ for _Hon._ in\r\nthe tenth; and he corrects the Mason’s _Pallidæ_ into _Pallida_. It runs\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Near to this Mournfull Marble lies Interr’d the Body of the Hon. Coll.\r\n  Charles Price who was divested of the Robe of Mortality on the 23d day\r\n  of May, 1730, Aged 52 years.\r\n\r\n  Who was a Loving Husband, an Indulgent Parent, a peaceable Neighbour,\r\n  and a faithful Friend; Just, Charitable, Courteous, Affable to his\r\n  Inferiors, patient of Injuries and Slow to wrath.\r\n\r\n  A Man of Integrity, and so firm to his word, that he inviolably\r\n  preserv’d the same even to the strictest Nicety of Honour; meek he was\r\n  but truly Brave, and every way fited for his Hon. station, and for a\r\n  Loyalist was second to none.\r\n\r\n  He was possessed of such a singular ingaging temper and sincerity of\r\n  mind, which render’d him a very desirable Companion to all, but more\r\n  especialy to those who had the happyness of being intimately\r\n  acquainted with him for he knew no guile neither was deceit found in\r\n  his heart. If he had any Enemies, they must have been the Sons of\r\n  Envy, and became such not thro’ any real cause by him given, but from\r\n  some invidious and Malignant seeds planted and foster’d in their own\r\n  turbulent and uneasie breasts.\r\n\r\n  To say more of him would be but still to say too little, only that he\r\n  is now gone to that place which alone knows how to reward those\r\n  vertues, of which he was here the happy possessor.\r\n\r\n           O may we then like him resign our breath,\r\n           In life his vertues share, and be like him in Death.\r\n\r\n  Pallidæ [_sic_] mors æquo pulsat Pede pauperum Tabernas Regumque\r\n  Turres.\r\n\r\nLawrence-Archer, in his “Monumental Inscriptions of the British West\r\nIndies” (1875), gives the same information as Roby. Nothing is now known\r\nof such a tomb near Aylmers, and the tombstone in memory of Price, as\r\nquoted by Roby, is now on the floor of the church near the north door;\r\nbut the tinctures on the arms are quite gone. There is no record of the\r\nremoval from wood to church. It was evidently subsequent to 1849, but\r\nthe reference in Lawrence-Archer is no certain proof that it was still\r\nin the wood in 1875.\r\n\r\nCharles Price was the third son of Francis Price, who came to Jamaica as\r\na captain under Venables. His eldest son, Charles, who achieved much\r\nfame in Jamaica and was made a baronet in 1768, and lies buried at\r\nDecoy, his estate in St. Mary, will be dealt with under that parish.\r\nCharles Price was member for St. John in 1713 and St. James in 1725, but\r\nwas expelled for non-attendance in the same year. He was custos of St.\r\nCatherine. His two sons and six daughters, who all died between 1716 and\r\n1727, lie buried in the church. He left three surviving sons.\r\n\r\nAmongst other monuments in the church are those to the following:\r\nRichard Guy, who represented in the Assembly “the North-side” (1671–2),\r\nSt. Ann and St. James in 1673–74, and St. James from 1675 to 1679. In\r\n1676 he patented 1000 acres of which Latium (not Latimer as\r\nLawrence-Archer and Feurtado—after him—have it) in St. John, formed\r\npart: George Modd, who represented St. John in the Assembly in 1718,\r\n1719, and 1722, and St. Catherine in 1721, in which year he was speaker;\r\nand Colonel Whitgift Aylmer. The arms on his monument are: a cross\r\nbetween four Cornish choughs close; the crest, a Cornish chough rising\r\nout of a ducal coronet. From the title “Honourable” it is possible, Roby\r\npoints out, that he was custos of the precinct of St. Catherine (which\r\ncomprehended the parish of St. John with St. Dorothy and St.\r\nThomas-in-the-Vale), as he does not appear to have been a member of the\r\nCouncil; and although from the arms on his monument it may be inferred\r\nthat he was of the now noble family of Aylmers, of Balrath, Co. Meath,\r\nyet that family was not ennobled until 1718, seventeen years after his\r\ndecease, when Matthew (second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer, who was\r\ncreated a baronet of Ireland in 1682), rear-admiral of the red, was\r\ncreated Baron Aylmer of Balrath.\r\n\r\nThe family, which had been long settled in Ireland, is said to have been\r\ndescended from Aylmer, a Saxon duke of Cornwall, and Sir Gerald Alymer,\r\nwho, 25 Hen. VIII (1533), was a Baron of the Exchequer in Ireland, was\r\ngreat-great-grandfather to Sir Christopher, the first baronet before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe family gave an archbishop to Canterbury, and Whitgift Aylmer is\r\nsupposed to have descended from Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury. He\r\nwas member of Assembly for St. John’s 1673–74, 1677, 1677 again; St.\r\nAnn’s 1680–81 and 1687–88; and for St. John’s 1701. The Christian name\r\nof his wife was Joyce, as appears from the register of St. Catherine’s,\r\nin which parish two of their children were baptized—Mary, June 11, 1669,\r\nand John, September 5, 1687. His son was also a member of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe following notice of his election for this parish appears under the\r\ndate of June 26, 1701.\r\n\r\n  It appearing by the return of the writs, that Lieutenant-Colonel\r\n  Whitgift Aylmer was elected for the parish of St. John, and Whitgift\r\n  Aylmer for the parish of St. James, and it being doubted whether the\r\n  said Whitgift Aylmer, elected for the parish of St. James, was Colonel\r\n  Whitgift Aylmer the father or Whitgift Aylmer the son, and a debate\r\n  thereon, it was put to the vote whether the House understood by the\r\n  said returns, that Lieutenant-Colonel Whitgift Aylmer or Whitgift\r\n  Aylmer his son were elected for the parish of St. James.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, that it was understood by the return to be Whitgift Aylmer\r\n  the son.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the family still lives in Aylmers estate hard by.\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Dorothy, which was formed out of part of Clarendon and\r\npart of St. Catherine in 1675, was, on the general reduction of the\r\nnumber of parishes in 1867, merged into St. Catherine.\r\n\r\n=Old Harbour= bay was called by Columbus _Puerto de las Vacas_, probably\r\nbecause he saw a number of manatees there when he visited it on his\r\nhomeward way after he had discovered Jamaica.\r\n\r\nBernaldez tells us that:\r\n\r\n  Thus sailing in a southerly direction they anchored one evening in a\r\n  bay in a territory where there were many large villages; and the\r\n  cacique of a very large village which was above the ships came and\r\n  brought them a quantity of fresh provisions and the admiral gave some\r\n  of the things which he had on board to him and his followers, and they\r\n  were much pleased; and the cacique asked whence they came and what the\r\n  admiral’s name was, and the admiral answered that he was a vassal of\r\n  the mighty and illustrious sovereigns the king and queen of Castile,\r\n  his masters, who had sent him to these parts to learn and discover\r\n  those lands and to do much honour to good men but to destroy the bad.\r\n  Now he spoke to them by means of his Indian interpreter and the said\r\n  cacique was much pleased, and he asked the interpreter at great length\r\n  about things in Spain, and he told him at great length at which the\r\n  cacique and the other Indians were much astonished and pleased and\r\n  they stayed there until night, and then took leave of the admiral.\r\n  Next day the admiral departed, and as he was sailing with a light\r\n  wind, the cacique came with three canoes and overtook the admiral\r\n  coming in an orderly and stately manner; one of the canoes was as\r\n  large as a sea-going ship and was painted all over: the cacique came\r\n  and his wife and two daughters and two young lads, his sons and five\r\n  brothers and others who were followers; one of the daughters was 18\r\n  years old, and very beautiful; she was quite naked according to the\r\n  custom of those parts, the other was younger.\r\n\r\n  In the prow of the canoe stood the standard-bearer of the cacique clad\r\n  in a mantle of variegated feathers, with a tuft of gay plumes on his\r\n  head, and bearing in his hand a fluttering white banner. Two Indians\r\n  with caps or helmets of feathers of uniform shape and colour and their\r\n  faces painted in a similar manner, beat upon tabors; two others, with\r\n  hats curiously wrought of green feathers, held trumpets of a fine\r\n  black wood, ingeniously carved; there were six others, in large hats\r\n  of white feathers, who appeared to be guards to the cacique.\r\n\r\n  Having arrived alongside of the admiral’s ship, the cacique entered on\r\n  board with all his train. He appeared in full regalia. Around his head\r\n  was a band of small stones of various colours, but principally green,\r\n  symmetrically arranged, with large white stones at intervals, and\r\n  connected in front by a large jewel of gold. Two plates of gold were\r\n  suspended to his ears by rings of very small green stones. To a\r\n  necklace of white beads, of a kind deemed precious by them, was\r\n  suspended a large plate, in the form of a fleur-de-lys, of guanin, an\r\n  inferior species of gold; and a girdle of variegated stones, similar\r\n  to those around his head, completed his regal decorations. His wife\r\n  was adorned in a similar manner, having also a very small apron of\r\n  cotton, and bands of the same round her arms and legs. The daughters\r\n  were without ornaments, excepting the eldest and handsomest, who had a\r\n  girdle of small stones, from which was suspended a tablet, the size of\r\n  an ivyleaf, composed of various coloured stones embroidered on network\r\n  of cotton.\r\n\r\n  When the cacique entered on board the ship he distributed presents of\r\n  the productions of his island among the officers and men.\r\n\r\nColumbus tells us that Old Harbour was inhabited by the most intelligent\r\nand most civilized of all the aborigines that he had met in the\r\nAntilles. Later it was called Esquivel, after the Spanish governor who\r\nestablished it as a port for ship-building.\r\n\r\nThe land on which the =Church of St. Dorothy=, commonly called\r\nTamarind-tree church, at Old Harbour, was built, was given as a free\r\ngift by Colonel Fuller and his wife Catherine Fuller, and also the land\r\nand glebe consisting of about 30 acres of land on which the rectory\r\nhouse was built. Colonel Fuller was among the foremost of the\r\nParliamentary officers who came here with Penn and Venables, and\r\nreceived large grants of land, comprising Fuller’s Pen and Thetford in\r\nSt. Dorothy, and Fuller’s Pen in St. John’s. At a Council meeting held\r\nat St. Jago de la Vega, May 9, 1692,\r\n\r\n  Thomas Scambler Clerke, Minister and Rector of the Parish of St.\r\n  Dorothy, being at the Board tendered the oaths appointed by Act of\r\n  Parliament to be taken instead of the oaths of Supremacy and\r\n  Allegiance, and also to repeat and subscribe the Declaration as by the\r\n  said Act is Required Peremtarily refuse to take the same ordered that\r\n  he be from henceforth _ipso facto_ deprived of his said benefice as by\r\n  the said Act is Directed, and that notice thereof be given to the\r\n  Churchwardens of the said parish.\r\n\r\nOn May 19, at a meeting of the council, it was\r\n\r\n  ordered that the Provost Marshall forthwith take into custody the body\r\n  of Thomas Scambler Clerke, late Minister and Rector of the Parish of\r\n  St. Dorothy for refusing to take the oaths ... and that the\r\n  Attorney-General prosecute him thereupon.\r\n\r\nAmongst the rectors was the Rev. William Leacock, who was of the Leacock\r\nfamily in Barbados. He gave up the living in 1836–37 and went to America\r\nand was the leading divine of the Episcopal church in New Orleans. He\r\nwas succeeded by the Rev. Charles Hall, the Rev. McAlves, and the Rev.\r\nGeorge Wilkinson Rowe, brother of Sir Joshua Rowe, the chief justice of\r\nJamaica, who held the rectory for upwards of 30 years, and the Rev. W.\r\nC. McCalla, who commenced the building of the chancel and organ chamber\r\nabout 1890.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1845–46 the old church was usually called the Old Harbour\r\n“barn,” with red brick walls and wooden window shutters. The church was\r\nrenovated and restored and a belfry was put on the roof by the late\r\nAlexander Bravo in the time of the Rev. George W. Rowe.\r\n\r\nIn the church are monuments to Colonel Thomas Fuller (d. 1690) and John\r\nPusey (d. 1767).\r\n\r\n=Colebeck Castle=, which stands on a ridge of land on the west bank of\r\nthe Colebeck gully, about a mile and a half to the north-west of Old\r\nHarbour town, overlooking the bay, probably dates from the end of the\r\nseventeenth century. It must have been the most imposing building of the\r\nkind erected in Jamaica. It was evidently at one time partially\r\ndestroyed by fire. It is rectangular in plan, about 114 feet wide and 90\r\nfeet deep, consisting of four three-storied, square, tower-like\r\nbuildings at each corner, rising to a height of about 40 feet, connected\r\nby two-storied arched arcades, consisting on two sides of three arches,\r\non the other sides of five arches. The windows on the ground floor are\r\ncircular. The walls are formed of stone, filled in between with rubble,\r\nwith brick quoins and window facings, and are about 2 feet 6 inches\r\nthick; at every fourth or fifth course is a course of larger sized\r\nbricks. The inside walls have been coated with plaster work. Some of the\r\nlintels of doors and windows still remain, and are of bully-wood, as\r\ngood as when they were first put up. A concrete terrace ran around the\r\ncastle, with steps at front and back.\r\n\r\nParts of a projecting wall—at a distance of about 114 feet from the\r\ncastle on each side, enclosing a square of about 300 feet—about 12\r\ninches thick, still remain, and show crudely-formed loopholes for\r\nfiring. In some places there is a drop of from 12 to 20 feet on the\r\noutside. At each corner of the outer wall was a substantial building\r\nsome 60 feet square, and underneath three of them were vaulted dungeons.\r\nTwo dungeons are no higher than 6 feet, 8 feet wide, and 24 feet long,\r\nwith only one very small aperture low down at one end. The dungeon at\r\nanother corner measures 60 feet by 20 feet, and is reached by a flight\r\nof twenty steps.\r\n\r\nTo-day the castle is surrounded by bush, and is the abode of bats and\r\nowls. On the surrounding property sugar has given place to tobacco.\r\n\r\nFrom his black marble gravestone on the floor of the south transept in\r\nthe cathedral, we learn that “Collnel John Colbeck of Colbeck in St.\r\nDorothyes was born ye 30th of May, 1630, and came with ye army that\r\nconquered this island ye 10th day of May, 1655, where haveing discharged\r\nseveral honble. offices both civill and military with great applause he\r\ndeparted this life ye 22d day of February 1682.”\r\n\r\nHe was returned member for Old Harbour in the first Assembly of Jamaica,\r\nwhich met on January 20, 1663–64. In 1664, as Sedgwick had prophesied in\r\na letter to Thurloe, the Maroons proved a thorn in the side of the\r\nEnglish settlers. Though the main body under Juan de Bolas had\r\nsurrendered after the defeat of the Spaniards by Doyley, other parties\r\nremained in inaccessible retreats, and, augmented by runaway slaves,\r\ngave great trouble by intermittent descents on the planters in the\r\ninterior. Foremost amongst these were the Vermaholis negroes. After the\r\ndeath, in action, of Juan de Bolas, who on surrendering had been made a\r\ncolonel of the Black regiment, Captain Colebeck, in March 1664, was\r\nemployed to endeavour to quell them. “He went,” Long tells us, “by sea\r\nto the north side, and having gained some advantages over them, he\r\nreturned, with one who pretended to treat for the rest. This embassy,\r\nhowever, was only calculated to amuse the whites, and gain some respite;\r\nfor they no sooner found themselves in a proper condition, and the white\r\ninhabitants lulled into security, than they began to renew hostilities.”\r\n\r\nIn the survey of Jamaica sent home by Modyford in 1670, under St.\r\nKatherine’s parish we read: “John Colebeck (812 acres); Capt. Colebeck\r\nand inhabitants (1340 acres).”\r\n\r\nIn the third Assembly, which met on February 1, 1671–72, Colebeck’s name\r\nappears among the representatives of St. Catherine as “Major John\r\nColebeck for Bowers,” Bowers being the district in which Colebeck Castle\r\nstands. On February 14 following “the Gentlemen of the Assembly in a\r\nbody came to the Council and informed the Governor [Sir Thomas Lynch,\r\nLieutenant-Governor] of the sickness of their Speaker, Captain Samuel\r\nLong, who recommended unto them Major John Colebeck, with whom they went\r\nback to their House and immediately returned their thanks to the\r\nGovernor for his proposing so fit and able a person to be their\r\nSpeaker.”\r\n\r\nColebeck remained speaker of the Assembly until Samuel Long was\r\nre-elected in May 1673; but on Long’s election to the Council, Colebeck\r\nwas passed over for the speakership, and Beeston was elected.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth Assembly, May 10, 1673, Colebeck was again returned under\r\nthe general head of St. Catherine as chosen specially for Bowers. In the\r\nnext Assembly, which met on February 13, 1673–74, his name appears as\r\none of the three representatives for St. Catherine generally, the return\r\nomitting the former distinctions of one member for St. Jago, another for\r\nSixteen Mile Walk, and a third for Bowers. In the sixth Assembly, April\r\n26, 1675, he was elected for the newly formed parish of St. Dorothy, and\r\ncontinued until his death to represent that parish in every successive\r\nassembly, viz. on April 9, 1677, when he had been promoted to the rank\r\nof lieutenant-colonel; on September 6, 1677; September 2, 1678; August\r\n19, 1679, when he had attained his colonelcy; and finally on March 19,\r\n1680–81.\r\n\r\nIn a “Brief Account of the Government of Jamaica,” drawn up in 1680, his\r\nname appears fourth on the list of justices of the peace for Precinct IV\r\n(St. Catherine’s, St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, and St. Dorothy’s), coming\r\nafter those of Byndloss, Ballard and Long.\r\n\r\nIn 1679 he was one of a committee of fourteen of the Council and\r\nAssembly for the Defence of Jamaica, who signed specific recommendations\r\nto the governor for strengthening the breastwork, arming the new works,\r\nand providing four fire-ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COLEBECK CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 1682, the Lords of Trade and Plantations agreed to\r\nrecommend, and the King approved, Colonel John Colebeck to be of the\r\nCouncil of Jamaica, in the room of Colonel Whitfield deceased, but he\r\nhad died before the decision reached Jamaica. His will, dated February\r\n20, was proved on March 15, 1682–83. He does not seem to have had\r\nrelations for whom he cared, for he named none. He left all his estate,\r\nreal and personal, to his executors, Hender Molesworth and Samuel\r\nBernard (to each of whom he gave £40), to hold for payment of his just\r\ndebts and legacies. He bequeathed money to purchase a ring to each of\r\nSir Thomas Lynch, Robert Byndloss and Sir Henry Morgan. He left £20 to\r\nHenry Howser, the rector of St. Catherine, to preach his funeral sermon.\r\nHe left £10 each to Dr. Ross and Edmund Duck, the Attorney-General, and\r\n£300 to Mrs. Ann Ash; and to every one of “ye Gentlemen of Councill each\r\na ring of 30/- price. To ye church of St. Dorothy’s ye charge of\r\nglassing all ye windows and putting in iron barrs.”\r\n\r\nAfter his death, the name of Colebeck does not appear in Jamaica\r\nhistory. As his arms are not given on his tombstone, there is nothing to\r\nshow whether he came of the Bedfordshire or the Lincolnshire branch of\r\nthe family; but there is a tradition in the Colbeck family that a member\r\nof the Lincolnshire branch at Louth was transported to the West Indies\r\nfor cutting down an elm tree; that he acquired a fortune, and that his\r\nestate went into Chancery.\r\n\r\nThe principal reminiscence of the great earthquake of 1692 which\r\noverthrew Port Royal is the =Tomb of Lewis Galdy=, which is on the\r\nopposite side of Kingston harbour, at Green Bay, where at one time many\r\nnaval officers were interred. On a brick tomb rests a white marble slab\r\nwith Galdy’s crest and arms. The arms are a cock, two mullets in chief\r\nand a crescent in base. The crest, on an esquire’s helmet, is a plume,\r\nand the motto “Dieu sur tout.” The following is the inscription:\r\n\r\n  Here Lyes the Body of LEWIS GALDY, Esq., who departed this life at\r\n  _Port Royal_ the 22nd December 1739. Aged 80. He was Born at\r\n  _Montpelier_ in _France_, but left that Country for his Religion and\r\n  came to settle in this _Island_, where he was swallowed up in the\r\n  Great Earthquake in the year 1692 and by the Providence of God was by\r\n  another Shock thrown into the _Sea_, and miraculously saved by\r\n  swimming until a boat took him up: He lived many years after in great\r\n  Reputation, Beloved by all who knew him and much lamented at his\r\n  death.\r\n\r\nLawrence-Archer, in recording this inscription, adds: “Mr. Galdy\r\nprobably exaggerated the circumstances of his escape, especially as\r\nthere was no one left to contradict his statement.” There must have been\r\nat the time of his death many persons living who could have borne\r\nwitness to Galdy’s escape. Galdy probably did not write his own epitaph.\r\nMoreover, if Lawrence-Archer had experienced an earthquake himself he\r\nwould not have been so ready to scoff; and the following contemporary\r\naccounts all tend to prove the truth of the monumental inscription. In\r\nthe earthquake of 1907 there were many escapes almost as miraculous as\r\nGaldy’s.\r\n\r\nIn “The Truest and Largest Account of the Earthquake in Jamaica, June\r\nthe 7th, 1692, Written by a Reverend Divine there to his friend in\r\nLondon” (London, 1693) it is stated:\r\n\r\n  You would admire at the Goodness of God in the Preservation of the\r\n  residue; some were very miraculously delivered from death, swallowed\r\n  down into the Bowels of the Earth alive and spewed up again, and saved\r\n  by the violent Eruption of Water through those Gaps; some (as they say\r\n  themselves, if they were alive at that time to know what was done to\r\n  them) were swallowed up in one place, and by the rushing of Waters to\r\n  and fro by reason of the agitation of the Earth at that time, were\r\n  cast up again by another Chasm at places far distant.\r\n\r\nThis account is corroborated by the contemporary account given by\r\nCaptain Crocket, writing from Port Royal on June 30, 1692. He says:\r\n\r\n  Several People were Swallow’d up of the Earth, when the Sea breaking\r\n  in before the Earth could Close, were washed up again and Miraculously\r\n  saved from Perishings; Others the Earth received up to their Necks,\r\n  and then Closed upon them and squeez’d them to Death; with their Heads\r\n  above ground, many of which the Dogs Eat; Multitudes of People\r\n  Floating up and down, having no Burial.\r\n\r\nAlso in “A full Account of the Late Dreadful Earthquake at Port Royal in\r\nJamaica, Written in two Letters from the Minister of that Place”\r\n(London, 1692), we read:\r\n\r\n  But no place suffered like Port Royal; where whole Streets were\r\n  swallowed up by the opening Earth, and the Houses and Inhabitants went\r\n  down together, some of them were driven up again by the Sea, which\r\n  arose in those breaches and wonderfully escaped; some were swallowed\r\n  up to the Neck, and then the Earth shut upon them, and squeezed them\r\n  to death; and in that manner several are left buried with their Heads\r\n  above ground, and some Heads the Dogs have eaten, others are covered\r\n  with Dust and Earth by the people which yet remain in the Place to\r\n  avoid the stench.\r\n\r\nAlso in a letter, dated Jamaica, September 20, 1692, quoted by Sir Hans\r\nSloane:\r\n\r\n  The Earth when it opened up and swallowed up people, they rose in\r\n  other streets, some in the middle of the Harbour, and yet saved;\r\n  though at the same time I believe there was lost about 2000 Whites and\r\n  Blacks.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the same letter it says:\r\n\r\n  She [the anonymous writer’s wife] told me when she felt the House\r\n  shake, she run out, and called all within to do the same: She was no\r\n  sooner out but the Sand lifted up; and her Negro Woman grasping about\r\n  her, they both dropped into the Earth together; and at the same\r\n  Instant the Water coming in rowled them over and over, till at length\r\n  they catched hold of a beam, where they hung, till a Boat came from a\r\n  Spanish Vessel and took them up.\r\n\r\nAnd again, in a letter of July 3, 1693, “Some were swallowed quite down,\r\nand cast up again by great Quantities of Water; others went down and\r\nwere never more seen. These were the smallest openings: Others that were\r\nmore large swallowed up great Houses, and out of some gapings would\r\nissue great Rivers of Water, spouted up a great height into the Air,\r\nwhich seemed to threaten a Deluge to that part of Port-Royal.”\r\n\r\nBut the most detailed account of all is given in “A Natural History of\r\nNevis and the rest of the English Leeward Charibee Islands in America.\r\nWith many other Observations on Nature and Art. In Eleven Letters from\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Smith, sometime Rector of St. John’s, at Nevis, and now\r\nRector of St. Mary’s in Bedford; to the Rev. Mr. Mason, B.D.,\r\nWoodwardian Professor, and Fellow of Trinity College, in Cambridge,\r\n1745.”\r\n\r\n  One Mrs. Akers of Nevis was a native of Port Royal in Jamaica, and\r\n  lived there in the year of our Lord 1692, when the great earthquake\r\n  made such a dismal havoc and destruction, as will hardly ever be\r\n  forgotten by the inhabitants of that Island. She told me, ‘That the\r\n  earth opened wide, swallowed her with many others, and then\r\n  immediately closed up again’; she said she was in a state of\r\n  insensibility during her short stay there. It could not exceed the\r\n  tenth part of a minute before it opened once more to vomit some of\r\n  them up again. I asked her what might be her thoughts of the matter\r\n  just the moment before the Earth swallowed her down; and she answered,\r\n  that imagining herself upon the brink of a boundless Eternity, she put\r\n  up a short ejaculation to Almighty God, begging him to pardon her\r\n  Sins, and to receive her Soul. The Hiatus she fell into was all Water,\r\n  so that being very wet she received no other harm, excepting in one of\r\n  her Cheeks, which grated a little against something that did but just\r\n  draw blood. This water Hiatus closed again the next moment, catching\r\n  hold of some people by a Leg, of others by the middle of the Body, and\r\n  of others some by the Arm &c., detaining them in dismal torture, but\r\n  immovably fixed in the ground, till they, with almost the whole Town\r\n  besides, sunk under Water; which happen’d within three minutes after\r\n  she had got safe on board a Ship then riding at anchor in the Harbour.\r\n\r\nGaldy was an affluent merchant of Port Royal, churchwarden from 1726,\r\nand member of Assembly for St. Mary, 1707; for Port Royal, 1708–09; for\r\nSt. George, 1711; for Port Royal again, 1716; and for St. Anne, 1718. He\r\nenriched himself by the slave trade, as factor for the Assiento.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil about the middle of the last century various inns and\r\nposting-houses, or taverns, as they were generally called, were kept in\r\nJamaica. Some were rendered unnecessary by the advent of the railway,\r\nand some were superseded owing to the more rapid travelling rendered\r\npossible by better roads.\r\n\r\nOf these the =Ferry Inn=, formerly the halfway house between Kingston\r\nand Spanish Town, has survived hurricane and earthquake, only to live on\r\nits departed glory, and no longer as a tavern.\r\n\r\nIn 1677 “An Act for the Ferry between St. Catherines and St. Andrews”\r\nwas passed, of which the preamble runs:\r\n\r\n  Whereas William Parker, of the parish of St. Andrews, Esquire, hath at\r\n  his particular Charge found out and made a very convenient Way between\r\n  the Salt and Fresh River in the Parish of St. Andrews and St.\r\n  Catherines, which will be of great use and advantage to the whole\r\n  Island, in causing a more near and easie Correspondence with the\r\n  several Precincts and whereas the said William Parker hath likewise\r\n  set up and erected a Ferry for the better Accommodation of the said\r\n  Passage, and whereas the same cannot be maintained without great and\r\n  constant charges....\r\n\r\nIn return for the right to demand Toll over the Ferry, Parker was bound\r\nto “compleat the said Way and Passage within twelve months from and\r\nafter the making of this Act, and that in all places it be not less than\r\neight foot broad.”\r\n\r\nThis was one of a batch of laws that was not assented to by the King,\r\nand included in the laws passed under the Great Seal of England in 1678,\r\nand brought out by Carlisle for the Assembly’s acceptance which was\r\nrefused. It was repeated in an Act of 1683. An Act of 1699, confirmed in\r\n1703, directed the building of a bridge, and the 1683 Act does not\r\nappear in subsequent editions of the laws. The Ferry river—once known as\r\nthe Lagoon river from its source to the Ferry and thence to its junction\r\nwith the Salt river as the Fresh river—rises at Governor’s Spring in\r\nEllis’s Caymanas and runs into the Salt river; the united stream then\r\nruns into the old course of the Rio Cobre just before it enters Hunt’s\r\nBay in Kingston harbour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE FERRY INN\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy the Act of 1677, “William Parker, his Heirs and Assigns” were\r\n“Impowered and Authorized, for the space and term of fourteen years from\r\nthe making thereof, to ask, demand, sue for, recover, and receive as a\r\nDuty and Toll for the Transporting of any Person over the said Ferry,\r\nSeven pence half peny; for every Horse and Man, fifteen pence; for every\r\ngrown Beast that hath no Rider, seven Pence half peny; for every Sheep,\r\nCalf, or Hog, sixpence; and that the said William Parker, his Heirs and\r\nAssigns, may and shall erect a Tavern or Victualling-house near the said\r\nFerry, and shall not be compelled to renew or pay any License Money for\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\nLady Nugent, in her Journal, mentions visits to the Ferry Inn on three\r\noccasions, all in 1803; on February 10, when the Governor’s party\r\nbreakfasted there prior to the review of the St. Andrew’s militia by\r\nGeneral Nugent; on May 27, when “most of our family dined at the Ferry\r\nHouse, on the Kingston Road, and our dinner party was very small”; and\r\nlastly, on June 13, when she writes: “13th—Sent carriages, soon after\r\n5, into Spanish Town, for the Murphy family, who slept there. Soon\r\nafter breakfast, General N. set off with Mr. M. in the curricle, to\r\nvisit the estates between this and Kingston called the Camoens\r\n[Caymanas]. After second breakfast Mrs. and the Misses Murphy with me\r\nin the sociable. The rest of the party in kittareens, phaetons, and on\r\nhorseback, all proceded to the Ferry Inn to meet the Admiral and a\r\nlarge party at dinner. We had sent on to order the dinner, a few days\r\nbefore, and all that Jamaica produces was ready to be served up. The\r\npoor Admiral however, was so overcome with fatigue and the heat of the\r\nday, that he was quite ill, and obliged to leave the table. In\r\nconsequence we all separated early. Mr. and Mrs. M. went with the\r\nAdmiral, and are to be his guests till Wednesday. I took my seat in\r\nthe curricle with General N., and all our young people went in the\r\nsociable; and really if it had not been for Sir J. T. Duckworth’s\r\nillness it would have been a merry party. As it was I was much\r\nentertained; for the Inn is situated on the road between Kingston and\r\nSpanish Town, and it was very diverting to see the odd figures and\r\nextraordinary equipages constantly passing—kittareens, sulkies, mules,\r\nand donkies. Then a host of gentlemen, who were taking their\r\n_sangaree_ in the Piazza; and their vulgar buckism amused me very\r\nmuch. Some of them got half tipsy; and then began petitioning me for\r\nmy interest with _his Honour_—to redress the grievance of one, to give\r\na place to another, and so forth; in short it was a picture of\r\nHogarth....”\r\n\r\nTo-day one can drive by the road and meet perhaps only a few drays,\r\nladen with wood or guinea-grass for Kingston, or, it may be, bananas or\r\nother agricultural produce. Of the “host of gentlemen” one sees nothing.\r\nThe Ferry was in the early nineteenth century one of the places where\r\ntolls were charged. In the “Royal Gazette” for November 17, 1827, the\r\nLease of the Ferry Toll was advertised for tender.\r\n\r\nThe records of the House of Assembly contain many references to the\r\ngrants made in aid of roads, their management and the like. It may be\r\ninteresting to take the history of the Spanish Town road, which until\r\nthe advent of the railway was the principal, as typical of the rest.\r\n\r\n“An Act for the Highways,” passed in 1681 (the third Act passed by the\r\nlegislature of the colony) provides “That the Highways be sixty foot\r\nwide in standing Wood, forty foot where the Wood is only on one side,\r\nand twenty-four foot in open ground.”\r\n\r\nThe early “Act for the Highways” is alluded to in a slightly later Act\r\n(passed before 1695): “For making and Clearing a Publick Road from St.\r\nMary’s and St. George’s into the Parish of St. Andrew’s.”\r\n\r\nIn 1698 Parker was brought before the House for collecting toll at the\r\nFerry although the law had expired. A Committee to whom the matter was\r\nreferred, reported that they had\r\n\r\n  examined the business referred to them by the House, concerning the\r\n  Ferry between St. Catherine’s and St. Andrews and upon perusal of the\r\n  Patent granted anno 1682, the whole Committee came to this resolution,\r\n  viz. That the patent was void and the law expired:\r\n\r\n  Whereupon the said letters patent and the law being read in the house,\r\n  it was put to the vote, whether the House would concur to the report\r\n  of the committee of grievances;\r\n\r\n  Carried in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n  Michael Holdsworth and John Moone, esquires, ordered to wait on the\r\n  Governor and acquaint him of the resolution of the House about the\r\n  ferry, who returning, reported the delivery of the message, and that\r\n  the Governor said that he hoped the house would take care to make a\r\n  law that the benefit of the ferry should go to the two parishes, but\r\n  that he thought it reasonable that the parish of St. Andrew shall have\r\n  somewhat the more of the benefit, in regard that the road on the other\r\n  side the ferry is to be maintained by them, which will be chargeable.\r\n\r\n  Whereupon Michael Holdsworth, Usher Tyrrell, John Walters, John Dove,\r\n  Emanuel Moreton, William Hall, Jervis Sleigh, and John James,\r\n  esquires, were appointed a committee to bring in a bill for that\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd in the following year an Act was passed “to oblige the parishes of\r\nSt. Catherine and St. Andrew to build a bridge over the Rio Cobre.” The\r\nbridge was to be at least twelve foot wide.\r\n\r\nIn October 1723 a Committee of the Assembly, appointed to consider the\r\nmost effectual means for repairing the public roads, reported:\r\n\r\n  1. That although the road leading from Spanish-Town to the Parish of\r\n  St. Andrew were repaired according to the Act of this island directing\r\n  the repairing the public roads, yet it would be of no effect, unless\r\n  the Rio Cobre were first cleared.\r\n\r\n  To which the House agreed....\r\n\r\nAnd a committee was appointed to bring in a bill for repairing the road\r\nleading from St. Jago de la Vega to the town of Kingston. The committee\r\nwas, five days later, ordered to insert a clause for cutting a new\r\nchannel for the Rio Cobre.\r\n\r\nBy 1745 the road was known as the Ferry Road, and in that year a\r\nCommittee of the Assembly was appointed to enquire into matters\r\nrespecting it.\r\n\r\nIn 1748 the Assembly again considered the state of the Ferry Road, and\r\npassed “An Act to empower Commissioners to keep the Ferry, and erect a\r\ntoll-gate or turnpike, between St. Catherine’s and St. Andrew’s, to\r\ncommence at the expiration of an Act entitled An Act for empowering\r\nWilliam Peete, Esquire to keep the Ferry, and erect a toll-gate or\r\nturnpike between St. Catherine’s and St. Andrew’s, and taking up runaway\r\nnegroes.”\r\n\r\nIn 1758 an Act was passed for “Vesting in Trustees a toll to keep the\r\nferry, and erect a toll-gate or turnpike between St. Catherine’s and St.\r\nAndrew’s ...” and a similar Act was passed in 1761.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 a Committee reported:\r\n\r\n  4. On consideration of the motion for £4000 to be applied towards\r\n  carrying on the road from the church in Spanish Town to the church in\r\n  Kingston, it appears to your Committee, from accounts solemnly\r\n  attested and rendered in, and also from vouchers produced, that the\r\n  sum of £2000 granted last session of Assembly, for carrying on the new\r\n  road from the town of St. Jago de la Vega to the Ferry, in the parish\r\n  of St. Catherine, and of £2000 for carrying on the new road from the\r\n  Ferry, in the parish of St. Andrew, to the Town of Kingston, have been\r\n  all expended on the said roads; your Committee were therefore of\r\n  opinion, the sum of £4000 now applied for, should be granted: Your\r\n  Committee have come to two resolutions respecting this road:\r\n\r\n  1st. _Resolved_: It is the opinion of this Committee that the road\r\n  between Spanish Town and Kingston is laid out on too large a scale;\r\n  that therefore, it ought to be contracted that thirty feet in the\r\n  centre well paved and gravelled (except in the Salina which ought to\r\n  be paved forty feet) would answer every purpose to the public, and\r\n  save a considerable expense.\r\n\r\n  2nd. _Resolved_: It is the opinion of this Committee that the salaries\r\n  allowed to the Superintendent, and his assistants, amounting to about\r\n  £900 per annum, are too large; and that, in future, they ought to be\r\n  reduced.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 an Act was passed “for explaining and amending the several\r\nHighway Laws now in force, and rendering the said Laws more effectual.”\r\nIt was repealed and expired by 1792.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 an Act “for continuing the Act commonly called the Highways Act\r\nfor a certain time longer,” was passed, but expired in 1812.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 a Highway law was passed, but was repealed in 1805.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 a law was passed “for rendering more effectual the several laws\r\nrelating to the public road from the church in the town of Saint Jago de\r\nla Vega to the church in Kingston,” and “the Trustees of the Ferry Road”\r\nwere thereby appointed.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 an Act was passed giving “fuller powers to the Trustees of the\r\nFerry Road,” as it was found that “the present state of the Ferry Road\r\nrequires that their powers shall be extended, and that prompt and\r\nefficacious means should be used to repair and keep the same in good\r\norder especially by causing it to be frequently examined.”\r\n\r\nThe oldest tablet in the =Church of St. Thomas-in-the-Vale= at Linstead\r\nis that of one Elizabeth Burton, who died in 1742. At the time of the\r\nthreatened invasion by the French in 1805 the Records of the island were\r\nremoved to this church, and were protected by a militia guard. The said\r\nchurch was blown down by a hurricane in March 1822, and was shortly\r\nafterwards rebuilt. A tower was added to the church in 1830.\r\n\r\nThe church was destroyed by earthquake on January 14, 1907, and was\r\nrebuilt of reinforced concrete with eternit roofing at a total cost of\r\n£950 and was consecrated in 1911.\r\n\r\nAlthough the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-Vale dates from 1675, when the\r\nauthor of “The Present State of Jamaica” (published in 1683) wrote his\r\nwork, its church was not one of the seven churches in the island; the\r\nnearest church then being St. John’s, Guanaboa Vale, which had been in\r\nexistence since 1669. The earliest rector recorded was the Rev. Thomas\r\nGarbrand, appointed in 1705. In “The Early English Colonies” (1908), by\r\nMr. Sadler Phillips, is given “A List of the Parishes, Churches and\r\nMinisters in Jamaica, April 18th, 1715,” in which is included “St.\r\nThomas-in-the-Vale, a church blown down, Mr. Reinolds.” The Rev. James\r\nReynolds had come out in 1709, sent by the Bishop of London, who since\r\n1702 had had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Jamaica. In 1798 the\r\nrector was the Rev. William Williamson. In 1820 and for some years after\r\nthe rector was the Rev. William Buston.\r\n\r\n=Williamsfield=, in St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, on the road between St. Mary\r\nand Spanish Town, was first settled by Needham, a large proprietor, but\r\nwas soon purchased by one Harvey from Barbados, who in turn sold it to\r\nDaniel Lascelles, brother to the first Baron Harewood. It remained in\r\nthe Lascelles’ hands for many years. In 1743, Henry Lascelles went to\r\nLondon from Barbados, and being a wealthy man purchased the Harewood\r\nestate, carried on business in London as West India merchants with\r\nGeorge Maxwell. His son Edwin was created Baron Harewood in 1790.\r\n\r\nAt a Council meeting held on July 11, 1692, at St. Jago de la Vega (the\r\nfirst held there after the earthquake) it was “ordered that the Councill\r\nmeet on Wednesday next at Musqueto Point to view and consider of a place\r\nin order to the Building a fortification for to secure the Channell.”\r\n\r\nAnd on August 8 it was “ordered that a fortification be made at Mosquito\r\nPoint, of the ground &c. fitt to erect the same and that Charles\r\nBouchier, Esq. goe and veiw the same and draw out Plott thereof and the\r\nsame Returne to this Board.” This was the origin of =Fort Augusta=.\r\n\r\nLong gives the following account of the fort in his time. He makes a\r\nstrong attack on the policy of fortifying a place which he designates a\r\n“still unfinished battery stuck into a quagmire at the entrance of\r\nKingston Harbour,” and says that the immense charges incurred on its\r\nbehalf had by 1757 helped to cripple the island financially. He says:\r\n\r\n  This fort mounts eighty-six large guns, kept in excellent order. It\r\n  contains a large magazine, a house for the commandant, barracks to\r\n  contain three hundred soldiers, with all convenient offices, and\r\n  casemates. It was projected to mount one hundred and sixteen guns; but\r\n  it is not yet compleated. The walls and bastions are built upon piles\r\n  of the palmeto or thatch-pole tree, which is endued with the property\r\n  of lasting in water without being liable to erosion by the worm. These\r\n  were driven down through the loose land, until they reached a firm\r\n  bed. If the same precaution had been used in constructing the houses\r\n  of Port Royal, it is probable that the greater part of the town would\r\n  have survived the earthquake. This fort contains an hospital, besides\r\n  habitations for the officers, and is looked upon to be an healthy\r\n  garrison. The neck of sand which joins it to the main is not above\r\n  fifty or sixty feet wide in most places, and so low, that an enemy\r\n  could not carry on approaches, on account of the water rising near the\r\n  surface; and it is flanked by a lagoon, or inlet of water from the\r\n  harbour, of some extent; for these reasons, and because the ships, in\r\n  passing up the channel towards Kingston, must come within point-blank\r\n  shot of a whole line of guns, a governor of this island pronounced it\r\n  impregnable both by land and sea.\r\n\r\nDuring a storm in 1744 a new fort begun at Mosquito Point was entirely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe present fort was erected on Mosquito Point in Kingston Harbour in\r\n1753. On September 13, 1782, the magazine, with three hundred barrels of\r\npowder, blew up. Amongst the military tombs is that to Major John Sankey\r\nDarley, 2nd W.I.R., who was killed in a mutiny of the West India\r\nRegiment there in May 1808. Recruits of the 2nd West India Regiment,\r\nChamba and Koromantyn negroes, mutinied on parade, aided by some of the\r\nolder men. The Lieutenant and Adjutant Ellis was killed on the spot, and\r\nDarley died of the wounds he received. The general officer commanding,\r\nCarmichael, got into conflict with the House of Assembly by directing\r\nhis officers not to answer any questions that that body might put to\r\nthem with reference to the occurrence. Darley was brother to Alderman\r\nDarley of Dublin, of Orange notoriety. Carmichael died in 1813 while\r\ngovernor of British Guiana.\r\n\r\n=Rodney’s Look-out= on the Heathshire Hills was shaken down by the\r\nearthquake of 1907. It was erected by Rodney while he was admiral on the\r\nJamaica station, (1771–74), for the purpose of keeping a look-out to\r\nwindward. =Port Henderson= hard by, is named after a former owner, John\r\nHenderson, colonel of militia, who was presented at Court in February\r\n1784. He died at his estate in Scotland in 1811. It was founded in\r\nopposition to Passage Fort, as it afforded better accommodation for\r\nships.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the nineteenth century it was the site of a\r\ntemporary laboratory of marine zoology for students of the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n=Lawrencefield= is said to have been the residence of Sir Henry Morgan,\r\ngovernor of Jamaica (1673–82). =St. Jago Farm= is said to be the site of\r\nthe residence of Sasi, the last of the Spanish Governors. =Government\r\nPen= was the residence of former governors, and is frequently mentioned\r\nin Lady Nugent’s “Journal.” At Caymanas is an Arawâk kitchen-midden·, at\r\nMountain River, St. John’s, some Arawâk rock-carvings, and at Goat\r\nIsland (in Old Harbour Bay) is a cave with Arawâk remains. At Point Hill\r\nare some old barracks which are now used as a police station.\r\n\r\n=Keith Hall= is probably named after Sir Basil Keath, governor in\r\n1774–77, and =Sligoville= after Peter, Marquis of Sligo, governor in\r\n1834–36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n                                KINGSTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there was a collection of houses on or near the spot where Kingston\r\nnow stands, some years before its formation into a town and parish, is\r\nevident, but it is also evident that Gardner’s application of the name\r\nto “the little village of Kingston” in 1673 is based on imagination. In\r\nthe map of Jamaica in “The English Pilot” of 1689 in the inset of “the\r\ndraft of the Harbor of Port Royal” is marked Liganea, with seven small\r\nhouses and one larger one where Kingston now is, and one larger one\r\nhalf-way to The Rock.\r\n\r\nIn the “Present State of Jamaica,” published in 1683, occurs the\r\nfollowing description of the village:—“At Liguania, the inside of the\r\nharbour, opposite to Port Royal, about two leagues, is several houses,\r\nsome of them very handsome, and well built, which place in time is like\r\nto become a pretty town.”\r\n\r\nOn the map which accompanies the “State of Jamaica under Sir Thomas\r\nLynch” (included in the “Laws of Jamaica,” published in London in 1684)\r\nthe place where Kingston now stands is marked “Beeston.” The original\r\nowner of the land was Colonel Samuel Barry, who patented it in 1664 and\r\nlater sold it to (Sir) William Beeston, who, coming to Jamaica in 1660,\r\nrepresented Port Royal in the first House of Assembly, and was\r\nlieutenant-governor of the island from 1693 to 1700, and Governor till\r\n1702: but there is on the map a mark for a “towne” on the harbour to the\r\nwest, between “Beeston” and Hunt’s Bay, where Greenwich now is.\r\n\r\nThe site of Kingston was not the first chosen by the English for the\r\ncommercial capital of the island. Port Royal, as we have seen,\r\nflourished as such until 1692, in which year occurred the great\r\nearthquake which destroyed that place and caused the death of 3000 of\r\nits inhabitants. That dealt it a fearful blow.\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1692, a little more than a fortnight after the earthquake\r\nwhich destroyed Port Royal, the Council ordered a “survey of 200 acres\r\nof Colonel Beeston’s land in St. Andrews where the Council have resolved\r\nto build a new town,” and four days later the Council ordered that £1000\r\nshould be paid to Beeston, who was at the moment in England, for the 200\r\nacres: but this was apparently _ultra vires_ on the Council’s part, as\r\nthey had no power to originate money votes. The first traceable\r\nreference to the place by name occurs in the Council minutes of July 21,\r\n1692, when regulations for building “the new town of Kingston in St.\r\nAndrews” were drawn up, and it was resolved that every purchaser should\r\nwithin three years build a house worth £50 on forfeiture of that sum.\r\nSuch forfeiture, it was later decided, should go towards founding a\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nThe following occurs in the Council minutes for August 9, 1692:\r\n\r\n  Ordered that no freeholder of Port Royall have laid out for him above\r\n  one lott by the sea side.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that none of the Inhabitants of Port Royall have laid out for\r\n  him above one lott.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that all the freeholders of Port Royall have laid out for them\r\n  in the said Towne the same quantity they had on Port Royall provided\r\n  it Exceed not three lotts.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that all the freeholders that had land bounding upon the North\r\n  sea side on Port Royall be Preferred to the sea side land and that\r\n  their lotts be first cast.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that all the lotts for the Towne of Kingston be cast on once\r\n  and that if Claimers doe not appear for all the said land that then\r\n  blankes be cast to Coll^{ll} Peter Beckford and Coll^{ll} Nicholas\r\n  Laws or be disposed of by them to the next Pretenders.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that for every lott of land there be reserved to their\r\n  Maj^{ties} Tenn Shillings a year as an anuall Quitt Rent.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that the chiefe Justice be desired to order the Drawing of\r\n  Conveyances for the severall parcells of land laid out in the said\r\n  Towne.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that the forfeiture of fifty pounds for not building a house\r\n  upon the Premises of the Value of fifty Pounds within the time\r\n  appointed by this Board shall be applied to the building of an\r\n  Hospital in the said Towne.\r\n\r\n  Ordered that the Councill meet at the house of Mr. Ann. Lowder in the\r\n  Towne of Kingston on Tuesday next to Receive the claims of the\r\n  freeholders and Inhabitants of Po^t Royall & all others that are\r\n  Desireous to Erect and build in the said Towne & that notice be given\r\n  thereof accordingly.\r\n\r\n  After the Calamity of the Earthquake we had appointed a place for y^e\r\n  building of a Towne w^{ch} we then thought by its Scituation would\r\n  have been equall if not Exceeding Port Royall where we had ordered all\r\n  ships and vessells arriveing here to unlade and also ordered the\r\n  severall offices to settle there for Enterey of the same—\r\n\r\n  But may it pleas y^r Lordships Since to o^r no small greif we are made\r\n  sensible of the unhealthyness of the place. By the great Mortality\r\n  that there happened & finding a Greater difficulty then we Expected in\r\n  fortifying the harbour Have been forst to order the withdrawing of\r\n  those offices to the Remains of Port Royall where there is firme Rock\r\n  enough left for fortifying that neither the Earthquake nor the sea\r\n  hath distroyed or made Unhabitable.\r\n\r\nOn August 16 the Council itself met at Kingston. Orders were given for\r\nthe erection of a market to be held daily, Edward Yeamans to be clerk.\r\nThomas Clarke was provisionally appointed naval officer and collector of\r\ncustoms, and Deodatus Stanley was appointed bellman of Kingston.\r\nKingston was not represented in Sir William Beeston’s first Assembly,\r\nwhich met in 1693; of his second, which met in the following year, the\r\nnames of the members are not recorded; so it is impossible to give the\r\nnames of those who probably represented the new town for the first time.\r\nBut in Beeston’s third Assembly, which met on March 5, 1694–5, Kingston\r\nwas represented by Josiah Hethcott, James Bradshaw and Samuel Foxley. Of\r\nthese Bradshaw was a relative (probably son) of the regicide of that\r\nname. According to a document in Fulham Palace, recently quoted by Mr.\r\nN. Darnell Davis in “Notes and Queries,” “in 1723–4 Bradshaw, the son of\r\nPresident Bradshaw, came frequently to Liguania and received the\r\nsacrament there.”\r\n\r\nA letter, dated Port Royal, July 3, 1693, quoted by Sir Hans Sloane in\r\nhis account of the great earthquake already alluded to, contains the\r\nfollowing information about Kingston:\r\n\r\n  Others went to the place called Kingston (or by others Killcown) where\r\n  from the first clearing of the Ground, and from bad Accommodations,\r\n  then Hutts built with Boughs, and not sufficient to keep out Rain,\r\n  which in great and an unusual manner followed the Earthquake, lying\r\n  wet, and wanting Medicines, and all Conveniences, etc., they died\r\n  miserably in heaps. Indeed there was a general sickness (supposed to\r\n  proceed from the hurtful Vapours belch’d from the many openings of the\r\n  Earth) all over the Island so general that few escaped being sick; and\r\n  ’tis thought it swept away in all Parts of the Island 3000 Souls; the\r\n  greatest part from Kingston only, yet an unhealthy Place.\r\n\r\nMany people remained at Port Royal, but most of the survivors removed to\r\nthe lower part of Liguanea. The Council paid Beeston on June 28, £1000.\r\nA plan for the town was drawn up by Colonel Christian Lilly, “Her\r\nMajesty’s engineer-general,” under the direction of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn his plan Lilly adopted the chessboard fashion of all Spanish cities\r\nin the New World—a plan which is at least as old as the Romans. If one\r\nomits the lanes, the plan of Kingston as laid down by Lilly in the\r\nseventeenth century is precisely the same as that of the recently\r\nunearthed Roman city of Calleva (Silchester) of thirteen centuries\r\nearlier, with its insulæ, prototypes of the American blocks. Kingston\r\nconsisted then of a parallelogram one mile in length from north to\r\nsouth, and half a mile in breadth, regularly traversed by streets and\r\nlanes, alternately crossing each other at right angles. When Long wrote\r\nit contained “sixteen hundred and fifty-five houses, besides negro\r\nhouses and warehouses; so that the whole number of its buildings,\r\nincluding every sort, may be computed at between two and three thousand,\r\nand thirty-five spacious streets and sixteen lanes.” At present there\r\nare in Kingston 171 streets and sixty-nine lanes and about 9000 houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HARBOUR STREET, KINGSTON, IN 1820\r\n\r\n  From a coloured engraving in Hakewill’s “Picturesque Tour of Jamaica”\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Lilly when he planned Kingston, when land was cheap,\r\nomitted to leave room for lines of trees down each principal street. Had\r\nthis been done, shade would have been afforded to drivers and\r\npedestrians alike, and a picturesque feature would have been assured for\r\nthe town. Moreover, the chessboard plan of laying out a town, naturally\r\nfrom its regularity dear to the heart of an engineer, is fatal in the\r\ninterests of picturesqueness, however suitable it may be for\r\nprogression.\r\n\r\nThere was not at first much progress in its settlement, the recollection\r\nof the former wealth and greatness of Port Royal giving the colonists a\r\ncontinued preference for that place; but the fire of 1703 completely\r\ndestroyed the favourite town, and the disheartened inhabitants went in\r\nlarge numbers to Kingston, which the Assembly caused to be divided into\r\nlots and given to those who had lost their houses. A law was also passed\r\ndirecting the slave-owners in the parish of St. Andrew to send one out\r\nof every twenty of their slaves to build temporary huts for the\r\nrefugees, and, as an encouragement for the early settlement of the new\r\ntown, every house built within the year (1703) was exempted from taxes\r\nfor seven years. Soon after this another law was passed declaring\r\nKingston to be “the chief seat of trade and head port of entry” of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the prosperity of the town was assured, and in the year\r\n1713 it was declared by law that the place should “for ever be taken and\r\nesteemed as an entire and distinct parish, with all the powers of any\r\nother parish,” and, further, that it should “have the right of sending\r\nthree representatives to the Assembly.”\r\n\r\nSo rapidly had the town grown that in 1716 it was thus described by a\r\nhistorian of the time:\r\n\r\n  Within the harbour and about six miles from the town of Port Royal\r\n  lies the town of Kingston, first laid out and partially settled after\r\n  the great earthquake.... It is now become greatly increased in houses,\r\n  stores, wharves and other conveniences for trade and business, so that\r\n  it is by much the largest town in the island; and if the island shall\r\n  increase in people and new settlements (the consequences of trade and\r\n  riches) it is likely to be much the fairest town in all the Indies for\r\n  ’tis most commodiously laid out, happily and beautifully situated, has\r\n  many spacious houses in it, and more are daily building, is the\r\n  residence of the greatest merchants and traders, and has resorting to\r\n  it most of the ships or vessels that come to the island, and in it is\r\n  managed the greatest part of the trade of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 an Act was passed empowering the inhabitants to erect a court\r\nhouse and exchange; and for nearly half a century the town continued to\r\ngrow in size and opulence, and so important had it become in 1755 that\r\nthe attempt was then made to constitute it the seat of government. The\r\nGovernor (Admiral Knowles) twice proposed and the Assembly twice\r\nrejected a bill for that purpose; but at length the Assembly gave way\r\nand a law was passed giving effect to the arrangement. Soon after the\r\npublic archives were removed to Kingston and the superior courts were\r\nestablished there. But the change was unpopular throughout the island,\r\nand numerous petitions against it were sent to the King. On October 3,\r\n1758 (after Knowles had left), the disallowance of the law was\r\nproclaimed and the records were returned to Spanish Town, escorted by “a\r\nconsiderable body of military.”\r\n\r\nIn 1780, and again in 1782, the town was severely stricken by a fire. In\r\nthe former year the large and closely built portion of the town lying\r\nbetween King and Orange streets was burnt down, the destruction of\r\nproperty being estimated at £30,000. But the town soon recovered from\r\nthe effects of the conflagrations, and prospered to such an extent that\r\nin 1802 it was granted a corporation under the style of “The Mayor,\r\nAldermen and Common Council of the City and Parish of Kingston.” The\r\nCourt of Common Council was given a seal and empowered to make and\r\nordain bylaws, ordinances and regulations for the good order of the\r\ncity, not repugnant to prerogative or to the laws of the island. The\r\nfollowing is a description of the city seal: On the obverse the island\r\narms, crest, supporters and mottoes. Legend, _Sigi Commune Civit:\r\nKingston in Jamaica_. Reverse, Britannia, in the dress of Minerva,\r\nholding a trident in one hand, and in the other a mirror, reflecting the\r\nrays of the benign influence of Heaven on the produce of the island;\r\nbehind her the British Lion, supporting her shield, a conch shell at her\r\nfeet, and at a distance a ship under sail. Legend, _Hos fovet, hos\r\ncurat, servatque, Britannia Mater_.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 another great fire devastated a large portion of the city. It\r\nbegan shortly before 10 A.M. on August 26, in a foundry situated at the\r\neast end of Harbour street and extended diagonally across the city until\r\nit reached the old Roman Catholic chapel at the corner of Duke street.\r\nMany of the best dwellings and much valuable property were consumed, and\r\na large number of persons were left in utter destitution. The sum of\r\n£10,149 was distributed among the sufferers, of which £5000 was voted by\r\nthe House of Assembly. At this period a great deal of the foreign trade\r\nof Kingston had disappeared in consequence of the establishing of direct\r\nsteam communication between the European and Spanish-American states;\r\nstill Kingston continued an important centre of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn March 1862, another great fire occurred by which the commercial\r\ndivision of the city was devastated. Nineteen of the principal stores in\r\nHarbour and Port Royal streets, three wharves, and the extensive and\r\nwell-built three-storied house in which the Commercial Hotel was kept,\r\nwere burnt down at a loss of £30,000. The value of the merchandise,\r\nfurniture, &c., destroyed was estimated at £60,830, making a total of\r\n£90,830. Of this £9400 was covered by insurances, leaving £81,530 as the\r\ntotal loss to the owners of the premises and stock.\r\n\r\nThree years afterwards representative government was abandoned in\r\nJamaica, and Kingston ceased to be a corporate city. All the powers and\r\nimmunities of the common council were transferred to a nominated\r\nmunicipal board created by Law 8 of 1866, the privilege of making\r\nordinances for the regulation of the city being transferred to the\r\nGovernor in Privy Council. Since 1885 its affairs have been administered\r\nby a mayor and city council, elected every three years, similar to the\r\nparochial boards of the other parishes.\r\n\r\nFor many years it had become evident that the convenience of the\r\nGovernment and of the general public would be best served by a transfer\r\nof the seat of government from Spanish Town, and in 1872 Sir John Grant,\r\nwith the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, gave\r\neffect to the change.\r\n\r\nA calamitous fire occurred in Kingston on December 11, 1882, by which a\r\nlarge section of the business portion of the city was destroyed. The\r\ntotal number of houses entirely destroyed was five hundred and\r\nseventy-seven, whilst twelve were partially destroyed. These places were\r\ninhabited by about six thousand persons. The total loss of house\r\nproperty was estimated at between £150,000 and £220,000.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1907, the city suffered great damage from the disastrous\r\nearthquake of that date and from fire. Much the same area as that\r\ndevastated by fire in 1882 was destroyed in the fire of 1907, in\r\naddition to the havoc caused by the earthquake. The loss of life was\r\nvariously estimated as between 1000 and 1500. The value of property\r\ndestroyed amounted to between £1,000,000 and £1,500,000. A Mansion House\r\nfund for the relief of the sufferers amounted to £55,395, and a free\r\nImperial grant was made by Parliament of £150,000 and a loan of £800,000\r\nwas authorised. The relief funds were distributed by a Relief Committee,\r\nafterwards the Assistance Committee, constituted by the Assistance\r\nCommittee Law 20 of 1907. After considerable delay and much\r\nnegotiations, and on the failure of an appeal in a test case to the\r\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council, the insurance companies agreed\r\nto pay the claims to the extent of 85 per cent. on the face values of\r\nthe policies, and the money was distributed in 1909.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Loan was administered by a Loan Board created by law. Up to\r\nMarch 31, 1914, loans had been made to the value of £326,000.\r\n\r\nA fair number of the streets of Kingston have personal names. Those\r\nnamed after Governors: Beeston street, (Sir William Beeston, 1692–1701);\r\nBeckford street (Sir Peter Beckford, 1702); Heywood street (Peter\r\nHeywood, 1716–17); Laws (_sic_) street (Sir Nicholas Lawes, 1718–22);\r\nElletson road (Roger Hope Elletson, 1766–67); Nugent lane (General\r\nNugent, 1801–6); Manchester square (Duke of Manchester, 1808–27); Elgin\r\nstreet and Lord Elgin street (Earl of Elgin, 1842–16); Darling street\r\n(Captain Charles Darling, 1857–62); Musgrave avenue (Sir Anthony\r\nMusgrave, 1878–83); Norman road, Norman crescent and Norman range (Sir\r\nHenry Norman, 1883–89); and Blake road (Sir Henry Blake, 1889–98).\r\n\r\nThere was a Thomas Allman, clerk to the Agent Victuallers at Jamaica,\r\nwho was wanted for forgery and embezzling £1283 in 1743: but Allman\r\nTown, which came into existence soon after Emancipation, was, so Mr. G.\r\nF. Judah stated, named after George Allman, who was either an officer in\r\nthe army or the son of one.\r\n\r\nBarry street reminds us of Colonel Samuel Barry, who was one of the\r\nfirst Council named in 1661, and owned the land on which Kingston was\r\nbuilt. The land called Colonel Barry’s Hog Crawle was sold to Beeston,\r\nwho had it laid out in lots for the building of Kingston. Byndloss lane\r\nbears the name of a family which in the seventeenth and early eighteenth\r\ncenturies supplied seven members to the Assembly—the earliest being\r\nColonel Robert Byndloss, member for Cagua in 1663. Barnes gully recalls\r\nJoseph Barnes, mayor, custos and representative in the Assembly of\r\nKingston, who died in 1829. Bowrey road reminds us of a recent island\r\nchemist, from whose property the road was formed. Hibbert street also\r\nrecalls a family closely connected with Jamaica in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries, one member of which built Headquarters House,\r\nformerly known as Hibbert house. Marescaux road, north of Kingston,\r\nreminds us of the late manager of the Colonial Bank. Orange and Hanover\r\nstreets refer to reigning houses of England.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Pechon street was named after Major John Bonnet\r\nPechon, who was assistant engineer on the military staff in 1809, and\r\nlater island engineer. He died in 1815. Princess street is a corruption\r\nof Prince’s street, as it was called in Beeston’s time. It is called\r\n_Rue du Prince_ on a French translation of Lilly’s map. Sutton street\r\nwas probably named after Colonel Thomas Sutton, who was speaker of the\r\nAssembly at the time of the earthquake of 1692. Temple lane in Kingston,\r\nas well as Temple Hall in St. Andrew, was named after Susanna Temple,\r\nthe fourth wife of Sir Nicholas Lawes, sister of “la belle Temple” of de\r\nGrammont, the wife of Sir Charles Lyttelton. Whence Tower street\r\nobtained its name is not known. The following has been suggested as the\r\norigin. In the very early days of Kingston the town had a rector but no\r\nchurch. The rector lived in Tower street. It is thought that the\r\nrector’s house may have been used as a church and had a tower and bell.\r\n\r\nWildman street is named after James Wildman, a member of the Council in\r\n1786, and later fellow member of Parliament for Hindon with Monk Lewis,\r\nanother Jamaica proprietor.\r\n\r\nThough they omitted for two centuries to dedicate their parish church to\r\na patron saint, the people of Kingston named five of their lanes after\r\nthe Apostles.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Knight, who practised medicine in the island “magna cum\r\nlaude” for thirty-four years, represented Kingston in the Assembly in\r\n1698 and 1701; he lies buried in the church.\r\n\r\nIn 1694, when an Act was passed for raising money “to solicit in England\r\nthe affairs of this Their Majesties’ island,” the parish of St. Andrew\r\nwas taxed to the extent of £52 17_s._ 5_d._, St. Katherine £56 16_s._\r\n3_d._, and others in less amounts; Kingston only being called upon to\r\ncontribute £19 5_s._: but soon after, on another tax being raised,\r\nKingston was regarded as being on a par with Port Royal and St. Jago de\r\nla Vega.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in 1699 a law was passed uniting the\r\nprecincts of St. Andrew and Kingston for the purpose of keeping their\r\ncourts and sessions. This law was repealed in 1704, by which time the\r\nnew town had become more prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe church has always been known as =Kingston Parish Church=, and there\r\nis no record of its ever having been dedicated to any saint until, at\r\nthe time of the recent consecration of the new building (in 1911), it\r\nwas decided to dedicate it to St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PARISH CHURCH, KINGSTON\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first traceable documentary reference to the church occurs under\r\ndate October 1701, when the land was sold to the churchwardens. In March\r\n1702–3 it is recorded in the “Votes” in the house of Assembly, that the\r\ncommissioners appointed to receive claims and make distributions of the\r\nlands, under the Act of that year, “to invest Her Majesty in land in\r\nKingston, for the reception of the sufferers by the late dreadful fire\r\nat Port Royal, declaring Kingston to be the chief seat of trade and head\r\nport of entry, and fortifying West Chester,” gave notice that they would\r\nsit in the church at Kingston. But the Act was disallowed in the\r\nfollowing year; and West Chester, wherever it may have been (probably\r\nthe western part of the town), was never fortified. It is interesting to\r\nnote that the only serious rival to Kingston in its claim to be made the\r\nchief seat of trade was Old Harbour. The use of the parish church for\r\ncivic purposes was by no means unusual in those days in England: for\r\ninstance, from 1576 (the date of the town receiving a charter) till 1794\r\nthe paroise (or priest’s chamber) over the porch of the parish church of\r\nHythe was used as a town hall.\r\n\r\nThere were probably in Jamaica nine churches of older foundation than\r\nKingston—those at Spanish Town, Port Royal, Halfway-Tree, St. John’s (in\r\nGuanaboa Vale), Port Morant, Yallahs, The Alley, Old Harbour and one\r\nother. Kingston, till an earlier year can be assigned, must rest content\r\nwith 1699, the date of its oldest tomb—that to William Hall, a merchant\r\nof Kingston and member of Assembly for St. Andrew from 1694 to 1699 (one\r\nof the Halls of Lincolnshire)—although it was possibly erected in or\r\nabout 1695. On the other hand, if the church was standing in 1701, it is\r\nodd that it is not mentioned in the deed conveying the land given by Sir\r\nWilliam and Lady Beeston to the churchwardens.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the register:\r\n\r\n        Lib. 33. Fol. 85.            Beeston, Sir William et Ux.\r\n        Dated 13th October, 1701.                to\r\n        Enrolled October 28th, 1701.    The Churchwardens of\r\n                                              Kingston\r\n                                        Josiah Heathcote and\r\n                                           Peter Caillard.\r\n\r\n  All these two lotts or parcells of land with the appurtenance\r\n  thereunto belonging being part and parcell of the said five hundred\r\n  and thirty acres of land situate and lying and being in the said Towne\r\n  of Kingston both the said lots containing one hundred foot to the High\r\n  Street westward one hundred and fifty foot northward to the Parade one\r\n  hundred foot East to Temple Lane and one hundred and fifty foot South\r\n  to the land of the said Sir William Beeston.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that a temporary building was at first erected, and was\r\nserved by the rectors of Halfway Tree and Port Royal pending the\r\nappointment of a rector; and that the permanent structure of the church\r\nwas only commenced after the land had been given by Beeston.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 a sermon was “preached at King’s Town in Jamaica upon June 7,\r\nbeing the Anniversary Fast for that Dreadful Earthquake which happened\r\nthere in the year 1692, by William Corbin.” This was “printed and sold\r\nby William Bradford at the Bible in New York, 1703.”\r\n\r\nJames Knight, whose manuscript history of Jamaica (dating from 1746) is\r\nin the British Museum, thus describes the Kingston of his day, which he\r\nrepresented in the Assembly from 1722 to 1735, with intervals:\r\n\r\n  “The plan of the town is three-fourths of a mile in length, N. and S.,\r\n  and half a mile in breadth, E. and W. Streets are Broad and are\r\n  Regularly laid out with a Parade in the centre. The South part is\r\n  built from one end to the other as high as the Parade and many\r\n  buildings are scattered in the North part so that there are now 1200\r\n  Houses and Storehouses, most of which are handsome Buildings, two\r\n  stories high besides garrets. They are covered with shingles, sashed\r\n  and glazed with Piazzas before every house so that a man may walk from\r\n  one end to the other without going in the sun but in crossing streets.\r\n  The church, which is a handsome building in form of a cross, is 120\r\n  feet in length and stands in the S.E. part of the Parade, the pulpit,\r\n  pews and wainscote about 8 feet in height are all neatly made with\r\n  cedar, and it has a very good organ in it. There is also in the town a\r\n  Quakers’ Meeting House and a Jews’ Synagogue, no other place of Public\r\n  Worship, though there are grounds to believe some Roman Catholics or\r\n  disguised Papists and Priests privately assemble and meet together.\r\n  There is also a very good Town Hall about 80 feet in length and 30 in\r\n  breadth on the South side and fronting of King Street, with a Piazza\r\n  round which is made use of as an exchange.... Kingston being the most\r\n  popular parish in the island, and a great number of strangers\r\n  resorting to it yearly, the Benefice is estimated at six hundred\r\n  pounds per annum currency.”\r\n\r\nThe anonymous author of an undated work, published in London in 1740,\r\nentitled “The importance of Jamaica to Great Britain, considered.... In\r\na Letter to a Gentleman,” thus refers to the church:\r\n\r\n  There is a handsome neat church, which consists of four Isles; the\r\n  Pulpit-Cloth is red Velvet, with Gold Fringes; the Seats large,\r\n  uniform and airy; has a good Organ; but the Church has no steeple,\r\n  there is no Bell hung up in it, but ’tis supplied by a small one set\r\n  up on a Frame not far from it; a large one lies in readiness to be set\r\n  up when they think proper, or have a Conveniency to hold it. The\r\n  Churchyard is wall’d in, which has several Tombs in it; in the Church\r\n  under the Altar, lies the brave Admiral _Bembow_ (_sic_); and in\r\n  another burying-place is a Tomb, which bears the Arms and Name of one\r\n  of the noble Family of the _Talbots_.\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that the tower had probably been erected between\r\n1740 and 1774, for Long, whose history was published in 1774—easily\r\npleased in matters architectural—calls it “a large elegant building, of\r\nfour aisles, which has a fine organ, a tower and spire, with a large\r\nclock. The tower is well-constructed, and a very great ornament to the\r\ntown.” “The Rector’s stipend,” he adds, “as fixed by Law, is only £250;\r\nbut the surplice-fees are so large, that his income is supposed at least\r\nto be £1000 per annum, Jamaica currency (£715 stirling).” His “four\r\naisles” is a very free use of the term. The church was in his time an\r\naisleless, cruciform building, but Greek rather than Latin in shape, a\r\nnot uncommon custom in Jamaica in early days.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 the mayor and commonalty of Kingston petitioned the House of\r\nAssembly, _inter alia_, that “the resort of persons to the parish church\r\nof the parish of Kingston for public worship hath of late years so much\r\nincreased that the said church cannot with convenience accommodate\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Jamaica Magazine” for 1813 we read: “An ordinance was passed in\r\nCommon Council of Kingston, the same day (15th) for punishing all\r\npersons conducting themselves in a manner offensive to public decorum in\r\nthe church. It enacts a punishment on all white and free persons of £100\r\nfine or three months imprisonment for such an offence, and on slaves\r\nthirty-nine stripes or three months imprisonment.”\r\n\r\n“Monk Lewis,” who saw it in 1816, says:\r\n\r\n  The church is a large one, but it is going to be still further\r\n  extended, the negroes in Kingston and neighbourhood being (as the\r\n  Rector assured me) so anxious to obtain religious instruction, that on\r\n  Sundays not only the church but the churchyard is so completely\r\n  thronged with them, as to make it difficult to traverse the crowd; and\r\n  those who are fortunate enough to obtain seats for the morning\r\n  service, through fear of being excluded from the evening, never stir\r\n  out of the church the whole day. They also flock to be baptised in\r\n  great numbers, and many have lately come to be married; and their\r\n  burials and christenings are performed with great pomp and solemnity.\r\n\r\nJames Hakewill, the architect, who was here in 1820, in his “Picturesque\r\nTour,” calls the church truly “a plain, convenient structure, but\r\nwithout any pretensions to architectural beauty.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. R. Bickell, who had been naval chaplain at Port Royal and for\r\nsome time curate of Kingston, wrote in his “West Indies as they are,” in\r\n1825:\r\n\r\n  In the city and parish of Kingston, there is but one church, which\r\n  will hold nearly a thousand people; it is thronged every Sunday\r\n  morning, principally by free people of colour, and free blacks.\r\n  Indeed, had there been two or three churches more built in this\r\n  populous city, six or seven years ago, and zealous clergymen appointed\r\n  to them, I feel confident in saying, they would, ere now, have been\r\n  equally thronged; but, though there are eight or ten thousand slaves\r\n  in the place, and a greater number of free people, with several\r\n  thousand white inhabitants, an island curate has never been appointed\r\n  there, and consequently a chapel of ease has never been built: on this\r\n  account, seeing so good an opening, the Dissenters have been very\r\n  active, and have four or five places of worship, three of them built\r\n  within the last three years; the Scotch, and other Presbyterians, have\r\n  a very large kirk (built principally with Episcopalians’ money) which\r\n  is not half filled; but the Wesleyans have two large chapels, capable\r\n  of containing more than two thousand persons, and which are well\r\n  attended (even filled I have been told) morning and evening, chiefly\r\n  by negroes and people of colour. The Baptists have also a large and\r\n  handsome chapel well attended by Blacks and Browns, besides a smaller\r\n  one occasionally opened. There is also a Catholic chapel for the\r\n  French and other foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn the “Estimate of Contingencies for the City and Parish of Kingston\r\nfor the year 1830” occur the following entries:\r\n\r\n                          CHURCH                           £   _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n\r\n Rector’s compensation money, 110_l._; house-rent,\r\n   200_l._; burying, 50_l._                                360    0    0\r\n\r\n Clerk’s salary, 70_l._; taking care of plate, 15_l._;\r\n   palls, 10_l._                                            95    0    0\r\n\r\n Sexton’s salary, 70_l._; digging graves, 25_l._; ringing\r\n   the bell, 25_l._                                        120    0    0\r\n\r\n Keeper of the town clock salary, 40_l._; repairs to\r\n   organ, 120_l._                                          160    0    0\r\n\r\n Sundry repairs and alterations for the present year       200    0    0\r\n\r\n Organist’s salary, 130_l._; beadle’s salary, 84_l._;\r\n   lighting up the church, 132_l._                         346    0    0\r\n\r\n Amount required for the Chapel of Ease                    300    0    0\r\n\r\n                                                          ————— ———— ————\r\n\r\n                                                          £1581    0    0\r\n\r\nThis of course does not include the stipends of rector and curate, which\r\nwere paid by the Government.\r\n\r\nN. B. Dennys, who was here in 1861, writing in “An Account of the Cruise\r\nof the _St. George_” (1862), miscalls the church St. Andrews and\r\ndescribes it as a “small building, whose only point of interest seemed\r\nto be its extreme old age.”\r\n\r\nOf the fabric of the church wrecked by the earthquake of 1907 nothing\r\nmuch need be said. It was a simple brick structure with concrete pillars\r\nand round-headed arches and window openings. Cruciform in shape, in\r\naccordance with English custom it was oriented with its altar at the\r\neast end. The pulpit and reading-desk originally stood, as was the case\r\nat Halfway Tree, Port Royal and Montego Bay, at the transept, almost in\r\nthe centre of the building.\r\n\r\nThe present building was erected from a design by Mr. B. A. Raves at a\r\ncost of £6000, in reinforced concrete on the old foundations, and as\r\nnearly as possible similar in design, with the omission of the tower.\r\nThe window openings differ from those of the old building; two of them\r\nbeing decidedly original in design. The new building was consecrated on\r\nJanuary 17, 1911, by the Archbishop of the West Indies, assisted by the\r\nBishops of St. Albans, North Carolina, Honduras and Antigua, the\r\nCoadjutor Bishop of Jamaica, and the Assistant Bishop of Toronto.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the nineteenth century, as “Monk Lewis” mentions,\r\nthe church was extended in length and the renaissance baldachin, which\r\nwas not replaced after the recent rebuilding, an unusual addition to an\r\nAnglican church, was, it is said, added by the then rector, the Rev.\r\nIsaac Mann. Some thought they saw in the floral device immediately\r\nbeneath the crown over the centre of the baldachin, the monogram W.M.,\r\nwhich they took to stand for William and Mary, but there are no grounds\r\nfor the supposition, and the structure was probably of later date.\r\n\r\nIn Duperly’s view taken in about 1844 the old sash windows appear; and\r\nthe old curved lead gargoyles, most of which were removed later, are\r\nvery evident.\r\n\r\nIn 1883–85, during the incumbency of Archdeacon Downer, who held the\r\nliving for thirty-five years and took part in the recent consecration\r\nservice, the church, which in 1873 consisted of nave and transepts\r\nwithout side aisles, was considerably enlarged by G. Messiter, by the\r\naddition of two side aisles on each side, giving extra accommodation for\r\n500 persons, making the building available for 1300 in all.\r\n\r\nThe aisles nearest the nave extended the full length of the fabric,\r\nwhile the exterior ones only ran east of the transepts. This, added to\r\ntheir apsidal form, gave, and gives, the church the appearance of a\r\nminiature cathedral in plan. Pieces of the original outside walls could,\r\ntill the recent reconstruction, be seen _in situ_ in corners of the\r\ntransept. The original windows were removed to the new outer walls and\r\nthe mural monuments were taken down and replaced on the new walls, a\r\nprocess which had to be repeated in 1910. When some of the old walls\r\nwere pulled down many massive beams of timber were found embedded in the\r\nmasonry, placed in several directions. Some of them were ten or fifteen\r\nfeet long, many inches in diameter and of bully-wood in perfectly sound\r\ncondition. Some, including Messiter the architect, thought that these\r\nwere put in to strengthen the walls in case of a repetition of the Port\r\nRoyal earthquake of a few years before: and they certainly suggest the\r\nmethod of construction adopted by the Spaniards for that purpose and\r\ndescribed in Long’s history. At the same time, when the foundation of\r\nthe east wall was underpinned, a large vault under the altar was opened;\r\nand in it was found a coffin—covered with the remains of velvet and gilt\r\nornaments, apparently of a most expensive character—thought to have been\r\nAdmiral Benbow’s.\r\n\r\nThe oldest dated Communion plate is of the year 1707. Two patens were\r\nthe gift of Mrs. Ann Plowman; and two other pieces, a chalice and\r\nflagon, were given by Mr. Elias Nezerau in that year. Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nSillers gave in 1721 a flagon identical with that given by Mr. Nezerau\r\nfourteen years earlier. Both flagons bear the maker’s mark.\r\n\r\nThe clock dates from 1801, the organ from 1878, the lectern from 1886,\r\nthe bell from 1890, the pulpit (of white stone, with marble columns)\r\nfrom 1891, when it was erected in memory of a former rector, Archdeacon\r\nCampbell, his brother Dr. Charles Campbell, and the doctor’s partner,\r\nDr. Bowerbank.\r\n\r\nThe rose window in the north transept, representing the Good Samaritan,\r\nwith medallions of St. John, St. Peter, St. Stephen, St. Andrew as\r\ndeacon, and St. Stephen as martyr, was put up in 1888 to the memory of\r\nthe Hon. H. F. Colthirst, a churchwarden, and his children. The\r\ncorresponding window, of 1887, in the south transept, representing, in\r\nthe centre, the Angel at the Sepulchre, surrounded by cherubs, is a\r\nmemorial to Mr. C. A. Robinson and children. These two windows gave a\r\ngood illustration of the manner in which concrete, even before the\r\nearthquake of 1907, was made to do duty for stone in Jamaica. Portions\r\nof the glass from these windows have, in the recent reconstruction, been\r\nscattered throughout various window openings. The window at the east end\r\nof the north aisle, heraldic and geometric in character, was erected to\r\nthe Hon. Dr. Hamilton, District Grand Master of the Freemasons in\r\nJamaica. The east window was erected in 1914 in memory of Archdeacon\r\nDowner.\r\n\r\nThe vestry was built in 1895, and in that year the old brick wall which\r\nformerly surrounded the churchyard was replaced by the present railing.\r\nThe City Council contributed £50 towards the cost of the bell on the\r\ncondition that it should be rung at nine o’clock every evening—a\r\nreminiscence of the English curfew which is still continued.\r\n\r\nBeside the west door were hung the old colours of the 2nd Battalion of\r\nthe West India Regiment, returned to the rebuilt garrison chapel at\r\nUp-Park Camp in 1912, and on either side are monumental brasses—one\r\n(1896) to the memory of officers and men of the 1st Battalion W.I.R. who\r\nfell in West Africa in various expeditions, and another (1898) to\r\nofficers who died of fever on the West Coast of Africa and in this\r\nisland; and there are marble tablets to the officers of the 1st and 3rd\r\nW.I.R. who died here and elsewhere in the West Indies of yellow fever in\r\n1853.\r\n\r\nThe following is as perfect a list of the rectors of the parish as it\r\nhas been found possible to compile:\r\n\r\n      1701–(?) 1714. Rev. William Collins.\r\n      1715—————      Rev. — Skipp.\r\n      1722–1754.     Rev. William May, M.A.\r\n      1729—————      Rev. Charles Lambe, D.D.\r\n      1754–1765.     Rev. Robert Atkins.\r\n      1766–1768.     Rev. John Pool.\r\n      1768–1776.     Rev. Thomas Coxeter.\r\n      1776–1784.     Rev. William Morgan, D.D.\r\n      1784–1805.     Rev. Thomas Rees.\r\n      1805–1813.     Rev. Alexander Campbell, M.A.\r\n      1813–1828.     Rev. Isaac Mann, M.A.\r\n      1829–1847.     Ven. Archdeacon Edward Pope, D.D.\r\n      1848–1860.     Ven. Archdeacon Thomas Stewart, D.D.\r\n      1861–1872.     Ven. Archdeacon Duncan Houston Campbell, M.A.\r\n      1873–1908.     Ven. Archdeacon George William Downer.\r\n      1908.—————     Rev. R. J. Ripley.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how Lambe came to be rector during May’s\r\ntenure of office. It may have been an acting appointment during the\r\nincumbent’s illness. The authority for including Lambe in the list of\r\nrectors is the following entry in Foster’s “Alumni Oxonienses”:\r\n\r\n  Lambe, Charles. S. John [Dean of Ely]. Ch. Ch. Matric. 1697, aged 18\r\n  [or 13]; B.A. 1701, M.A. from King’s Coll., Cambridge, 1709. D.D.\r\n  Lambeth, 1722.... Chaplain to the Duke of Portland when Governor of\r\n  Jamaica, Rector of Kingston, Jamaica, 1729.\r\n\r\nThe records of the parish church of Kingston extant unfortunately only\r\ngo as far back as the year 1722, the date of the first “Christening”\r\nrecorded. The marriages at that time were by licence, or _Bannis tribus\r\nvicibus promulgatis_. By recent legislation one calling of the banns is\r\nsufficient. It is curious to note the large number of widows amongst the\r\nbrides and of mariners amongst the bridegrooms. One of the best kept\r\nregisters is that of baptisms, commenced in 1785 by the Rev. Thomas\r\nRees. The first entry is:\r\n\r\n  Joseph Fennell Brookbank, the son of Mary Fennell, a free mulatto\r\n  woman, by George Brookbank, was born April 12, 1779, Bapt. Jany. 1,\r\n  1785.\r\n\r\nThe next entry, _more Jamaicense_, records the baptism of “Jamima\r\nBeaumont, the daughter of Mary Fennell, by James Beaumont.” Two out of\r\nthe first seven entries in this register are of children of married\r\nwomen, which unfortunately would not be, according to the\r\nRegistrar-General’s returns, a bad record even for to-day. On Christmas\r\nDay, 1786, the rector baptized twelve of his own slaves _en bloc_.\r\n\r\nThose who were baptized are described as black, or negro; mulatto;\r\nsambo; quadroon; mestee, or mustee; brown; of colour; Indian (these were\r\nprobably from the Mosquito Coast); and slave, or property of; and free.\r\nThe old African names of Quashie, Quasheba and the like were replaced by\r\nordinary Christian names, with a partiality for Biblical ones, with here\r\nand there a classic designation. The names on one page, taken at random,\r\nof the register for 1797 are: John, Sarah, Richard, Lucretia, Susanna,\r\nMargaret, Hannah, Jeremiah, James, William, Edward, Cilly (_sic_), Juno,\r\nMary, Eleanor, Joseph. These, in the main, simple names are preferable\r\nto the Thomasina, Justina, Rosina, and so on, affected to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 Cornelius Lilly, “of the parish of Kingston, mariner,” was\r\nmarried to Jane Macky of the same parish. One wonders whether he was a\r\nrelation of Colonel Christian Lilly who had laid out the town. The first\r\nburial recorded is under date March 27, 1741, “Ralph Greathead,\r\nbelonging to the _Sheldon_, Capt. Read, Command.” The ship _Sheldon_\r\npossibly belonged to the owner of Sheldon, a property in the Blue\r\nMountains. The baptism in 1797 of “Dorothy Morgan Mahony, a negro woman\r\nslave of Thomas Mahony, aged forty years,” recalls Dolly Mahony’s Gap in\r\nthe St. Andrew Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars of the baptisms solemnised in the parish\r\nchurch in the year 1828 may be of interest:\r\n\r\n                     White                   10\r\n                     Coloured               164\r\n                     Black                   54\r\n                     No memo made of colour  53\r\n                                            ——— 281\r\n                     Slaves—Coloured         40\r\n                     Black                  276\r\n                                            ——— 316\r\n                                                ———\r\n                                                597\r\n\r\nFrom its position of principal church in the chief town of the island,\r\nKingston parish church is frequently chosen for the holding of state and\r\nother important services rather than the cathedral of Spanish Town,\r\nwhich now finds itself left by the stream of time in a civic backwater.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the cathedral at Spanish Town more celebrated\r\npersonages have been buried within the walls of Kingston parish church\r\nthan in those of any other church in the island.\r\n\r\nOf the memorials, the most interesting is the tomb of Benbow, of dark\r\nblue slate, in the chancel, the inscription on which is curiously\r\ninaccurate. He was not, we learn in his life in the “Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography,” an admiral of the white, but vice-admiral of the\r\nblue. He was not fifty-one years old at his death, but forty-nine; and\r\nthe arms carved on it are not his. The arms are: Palewise, two bent bows\r\nbetween two sheaves of arrows; the crest, on an esquire’s helmet, a\r\nharpy. The following is the inscription:\r\n\r\n  Here Lyeth Interred the Body of John Benbow Esq: Admiral of the White:\r\n  a true Pattern of English Courage who Lost his life In Defence of his\r\n  Queene & Country, November ye 4th 1702 In the 52nd year of his age by\r\n  a wound In his Legg, Receeiu’d In an Engagement with Monsr. du Casse,\r\n  Being Much Lamented.\r\n\r\nOf the monuments, there are only four of artistic merit—three by John\r\nBacon, all similar in style, figures carved in high relief against a\r\npyramidal background of marble; and one without the sculptor’s name, in\r\nthe north wall of the inner north transept, to Edward Maiming. It\r\nconsists of a bust in mezzo-relievo. If executed shortly after Manning’s\r\ndeath in 1756, it is too early for a work by Bacon. It is a good example\r\nof English sculpture of that time, and it is possibly by Roubiliac, by\r\nwhom there is a monument of the year 1754 to Lieutenant Stapleton in\r\nPort Royal church, or more probably by John Cheere (brother of Sir Henry\r\nCheere, Roubiliac’s instructor for some time), by whom there is a\r\nmonument of the year 1733 to the Hon. James Lawes (eldest son of Sir\r\nNicholas Lawes) in Halfway-Tree church. Cheere’s work resembles more\r\nclosely the Manning bust than does that of the more florid Roubiliac. As\r\nwas the case with Bacon, one commission for Jamaica sometimes led to\r\nothers. The arms on the Manning monument are wrongly blazoned in\r\nLawrence-Archer’s “Monumental Inscriptions of the British Indies.” They\r\nare: Gules, a cross fleurie [not moline] or between four [not three]\r\ntrefoils slipped or.\r\n\r\nOf the monuments by Bacon, that to Malcolm Laing and his wife (1794)\r\nrepresents a female figure seated, emblematic of grief; the phœnix, of\r\nwhich Bacon was fond, is introduced in the background.\r\n\r\nThe monument to Dr. Fortunatus Dwarris, member of the House of Assembly\r\nfor St. George (which is now merged in Portland), and his stepdaughter\r\n(1792), represents a recumbent female figure resting on an urn, gazing\r\nat an angel conducting the soul of the departed upwards. In it the\r\npoetry on the urn descriptive of the scene represented is hardly equal\r\nto Bacon’s art:\r\n\r\n                 Ascend to Bliss ye gentle Spirits\r\n                   Where yon Angel soars above:\r\n                 Their Virtue her Reward Inherits\r\n                   Crowne’d with Heav’n’s eternal love.\r\n\r\nSir Fortunatus William Lilley Dwarris (d. 1860), the lawyer and\r\nantiquary, eldest son of William Dwarris, of Warwick, England, and\r\nGolden Grove, Jamaica, of which he was a native, was a member of the\r\nsame family.\r\n\r\nThe monument to John Wolmer (1789) is on the west wall of the outer\r\nnorth aisle. Of the three monuments by Bacon this is the best. Erected\r\njust sixty years after Wolmer’s death, it represents a seated figure of\r\nLiberality, carved in high relief, holding a medallion, on which the\r\ncrest of the school, the sun of Learning breaking through a cloud of\r\nIgnorance, is represented. On the supporting brackets are scholastic\r\nemblems—a quill pen, a book, parchment, scientific instruments and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nBesides the three monuments in this church already mentioned, there is\r\nanother monument to Mary, daughter of Dawkins Carr (who died in 1798).\r\nIt is in the usual pyramidal form, and represents a classic urn on a\r\npedestal. It is signed “J. Bacon, sct., London, 1799,” and must have\r\nbeen one of the last works sent out of his studio in his lifetime, for\r\nhe died in that year.\r\n\r\nSome monuments make one wish that the admirers of the worthies\r\nrepresented had followed the Erewhonian plan of paying the sculptor on\r\ncondition that he did not make the statue, letting into the pavement a\r\nsmall inscription where it would have stood, as was the case in that\r\ndelectable country. The tribute of respect would have been paid to the\r\ndeceased, and the rest of the public would have suffered no\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nOther tombs of interest in the church are those to Smart Pennant (wife\r\nof the rector, William May), who “was kill’d in ye 23rd year of her age\r\nby ye fall of an house in ye great storm, August ye 28th, A.D. 1722”\r\n(when her husband’s leg was also broken; he was commissary to the Bishop\r\nof London); to Susanna, wife of Colonel William Gordon (d. 1731), of the\r\nfamily which gave its name to Gordon Town; to Captain Charles Brown (d.\r\n1747), who is evidently the Commodore Brown who was described in a\r\npamphlet published in 1740 as living in Kingston, “and entertain’d the\r\ngentlemen and Ladies about Ligunea once a fortnight with an Assembly”;\r\nto Captain Samuel Phillips (died in 1757, aged 54), who, as the\r\ninscription tells us, “Commanded the _Alexander_, Private Ship of War,\r\nout of Bristoll, and Cut His Majesties Ship _Solebay_ out of St.\r\nMartin’s Road the 10th of April, 1746, for which he had the honour to\r\nkis His Majesties hand and Received a Gold Medal and Chain. _Alexander_\r\n140 Men and _Solebay_ 220 men”; to John Jaques (d. 1815), first mayor of\r\nKingston; to Hon. George Kinghorne (1823), custos of Kingston; to Hon.\r\nJoseph Barnes (d. 1829), mayor and custos of Kingston, whose memory\r\nlives in Barnes Gully; to Virginia Fairfax, wife of Peter Alexander\r\nEspeut, and daughter of Colonel Robert Munroe Harrison, consul-general\r\nof the United States of America for Jamaica; to Lieut.-Colonel Sir\r\nAlexander Leith, Bt.; to William James Stevenson, receiver-general; to\r\nEbenezer Reid (d. 1843), headmaster of Wolmer’s school for twenty-eight\r\nyears (the monument was erected by his pupils); to William Augustus Hunt\r\n(d. 1852), another headmaster of Wolmer’s school, a member of the family\r\nof Barbadian Hunts of which Leigh Hunt was one; to Bartholomew Owen\r\nWilliams (d. 1830), founder of the Sussex Lodge of Freemasons; to\r\nColonel Hill (d. 1819), who took part in the engagements of Vimiera and\r\nVittoria; and to Dr. Edward Nathaniel Bancroft (d. 1842), deputy\r\ninspector-general of Army Hospitals.\r\n\r\nOf tombs of special biographical interest are those of Benbow, Rowley\r\nand Brown, sailors; May, Mann and Humberstone, clergymen; Campbell, an\r\nauthor; Higson, a botanist; Wolmer, a philanthropist; and Manning,\r\nLawrence, Mitchell and Jordan, politicians.\r\n\r\nAt the principal entrance to the north transept was a large dark blue\r\nslate slab, foot-worn, but without an inscription.\r\n\r\n“The story is,” says Lawrence-Archer, “that it is turned on its face, to\r\nconceal the epitaph of an early Rector of the parish, who was hanged for\r\ncoining counterfeit doubloons in the vestry. It is said he was\r\ndiscovered in consequence of having issued one from his mint before it\r\nwas quite cold. The story is most improbable.” In 1885 the slab was\r\nraised and turned, when it was found to be to the memory of James\r\nRamadge, a merchant of Kingston, who died in 1755, aged thirty-three\r\nyears. Why it had ever been placed face downwards is not known. But that\r\nthere is some reason for the legend is proved by a reference to the “St.\r\nJago de la Vega Gazette” for December 19, 1801, where we read:\r\n\r\n  A number of counterfeit Doubloons and Eight-Dollar pieces are now in\r\n  circulation. The inscription on the face is Carol’s 3d., date 1761.\r\n  The face does not by any means resemble any effigy given of him or any\r\n  coins issued by Spanish Government during his reign. It is a perfect\r\n  copy of the head of Ferdinand the 6th, which appears on the doubloons\r\n  issued by him ten years before the accession of Charles the 3rd to the\r\n  throne. The pieces now in circulation are said to have been coined by\r\n  a Reverend Mr. Smith, who suffered for the crime many years ago on the\r\n  Kingston Parade.\r\n\r\nCan this have been the Hadden Smith who was curate of Kingston parish\r\nchurch in 1766?\r\n\r\nThe death of Peter Wagstaffe (who died in 1759) was curiously enough\r\nrecorded on two tombstones, both lying in the north aisle.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard are three interesting tombstones, those of Janet\r\nScott, sister to Michael Scott (the author of the well-known “Tom\r\nCringle’s Log”), who was two years her brother’s senior, and evidently\r\ncame out with him and his bride in 1818, when he returned from Glasgow\r\nto Jamaica; to Robert Bogle, his brother-in-law, of the firm of Bogle,\r\nHarris & Co., of Glasgow; and to Robert Hamilton, who was planting\r\nattorney to Sir Edward Hyde East, the owner of Maryland, on which stands\r\nRaymond Hall, where “Tom Cringle’s Log” was written. Hamilton was a\r\nfriend of Scott’s, and was portrayed as Aaron Bang in the Log. The\r\nScotts and the Bogles were evidently old friends. A “Jennet Scott, the\r\ndaughter of Robert Bogle and Margaret his wife,” was baptized on April\r\n5, 1793. She was probably a sister of the Robert Bogle who was Scott’s\r\nbrother-in-law. The following are the inscriptions on the three tombs:\r\n\r\n  Here lies Interr’d the remains of Mr. Robert Bogle, third son of\r\n  Robert Bogle, Esqr., Merchant, Glasgow, formerly of this city Merchant\r\n  who departed this life on 21st December 1819 aged 18 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Miss Janet Scott, fourth Daughter of Allan Scott, Esq., of Glasgow,\r\n  departed this life on the 4th January 1819 aged 32 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In memory of Robert Hamilton, Esq., of the Parish of St. Andrews, who\r\n  departed this life on the 30th day of October 1826, aged 68 years. His\r\n  unbounded Hospitality and goodness of heart endeared him to all who\r\n  knew him and his worth and amiable qualities will long live in the\r\n  remembrance of his Family who pay this last tribute due to the Memory\r\n  of a revered Father.\r\n\r\nThe Hamilton tomb is close to the south door. The Scott and Bogle tombs\r\nare side by side further south.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the name of Murray Crymble, who was receiver-general\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth century, may have suggested to Scott the\r\nsomewhat curious name of the hero of his novel. Crymble patented land in\r\nGrand Cayman in 1741.\r\n\r\nCopies of the inscriptions on all the tombs both in church and\r\nchurchyard up to the year 1875 will be found in Lawrence-Archer’s\r\n“Monumental Inscriptions of the British West Indies” (London, 1875); but\r\nmany of the tombs mentioned by him as being in the churchyard were, at\r\nthe enlargement of the church in 1883–85, placed on the floor of the\r\nside aisles. During the recent reconstruction of the church, many\r\nchanges have taken place in the monuments and tombstones.\r\n\r\nThe following brief biographical notes on some of the principal persons\r\nburied in the church and churchyard may have some interest:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM HALL, youngest son of Edmund Hall, of Greatford Hall,\r\n    Lincolnshire, was born in Lincolnshire in 1656, and was for a time\r\n    British Consul at Bilbao. In 1687 he accompanied the Duke of\r\n    Albemarle, as his secretary, when he came out as Governor to\r\n    Jamaica. In the following year he married Elizabeth, daughter of\r\n    William Wyatt. He was member of the Assembly for St. Andrew from\r\n    1695 till his death, which took place in 1699.\r\n\r\n  VICE-ADMIRAL JOHN BENBOW, the son of a tanner, was born at Shrewsbury\r\n    in 1653. In 1678 he entered the navy, and served in the\r\n    Mediterranean, where he did good service against the Algerine\r\n    corsairs. In 1686 he appears to have owned a ship in the Levant\r\n    trade. In 1689 he re-entered the navy, and became master attendant\r\n    at Chatham Dockyard and at Deptford. In 1690–92 he acted as Master\r\n    of the Fleet; he was present at the engagements of Beachy Head,\r\n    Barfleur and La Hogue. In 1693–94 he commanded a flotilla of bomb\r\n    vessels against the French; and, though only a captain, received the\r\n    pay of rear-admiral, which rank he acquired in 1695; and in 1697 he\r\n    became Commander-in-Chief of the King’s ships in the West Indies,\r\n    with especial orders to hunt down the pirates. The help which he\r\n    rendered to the Scotch colony in Darien was not acceptable to the\r\n    English government. In 1700 he returned to England, but in the\r\n    following year he was back in the West Indies, and in 1702 he was\r\n    stationed at Jamaica. From August 19 to the 24th of that year took\r\n    place his engagement off Santa Martha with Du Casse, _chef\r\n    d’éscadre_ in the French navy, and a former governor of San Domingo,\r\n    which has been called “the most disgraceful event in our naval\r\n    records.” Owing to the cowardice displayed by some of his captains,\r\n    Benbow had to abandon pursuit. He court-martialled his captains, of\r\n    whom two were shot, one cashiered and two suspended. Benbow died of\r\n    his wounds at Port Royal on November 4, 1702.\r\n\r\n  JOHN WOLMER, was a goldsmith, to whose benefaction the town of\r\n    Kingston has for nearly two centuries been indebted for the\r\n    excellent school bearing his name. Of his life little is known. On\r\n    July 11, 1705, he married at Halfway Tree Mary Elizabeth Lumbard.\r\n    From the name of one of the executors of his will (Samuel Kemer\r\n    Main), as well as from his own, it is possible that he was of German\r\n    or Swiss extraction. By his will, dated May 21, 1729, he devised,\r\n    after some small legacies mentioned therein, the rest and residue of\r\n    his estate for the foundation of a Free School in the parish in\r\n    which he should happen to die. This amounted to about £2360. He died\r\n    on June 29, 1729, at Kingston, where he had resided for upwards of\r\n    twenty years. In 1820 Wolmer’s Pen, adjoining Camp, was purchased by\r\n    the authorities in order to secure a better water-supply for Camp.\r\n    Although a bill was brought into the House of Assembly to give\r\n    effect to the will in June 1731, and the matter was again revived in\r\n    1734, it was not till 1736, and then after many amendments and\r\n    conferences between the Assembly and the Council, that a law was\r\n    passed and the Trust put upon a firm basis. The marble to his memory\r\n    in the church was erected “as a monument of public gratitude,” sixty\r\n    years after his death.\r\n\r\n  HON. EDWARD PRATTER, who died in 1735, aged 52, was member of the\r\n    Assembly for Hanover in 1723–24 (he and John Morant being the first\r\n    members for that parish) and for Kingston in 1726–27, 1731, and\r\n    1732–33. He was receiver-general, and also agent in Jamaica for the\r\n    South Sea Company. Kingston Gardens, in Kingston, was formerly known\r\n    as Pratter Pond.\r\n\r\n  REV. WILLIAM MAY, born at Ash, in Kent, in 1695, was educated at St.\r\n    John’s College, Cambridge, was commissary of Jamaica, and for\r\n    thirty-two years rector of Kingston. He died in January 1753–54. His\r\n    first wife was Smart Mary, daughter of Edward Pennant, of Clarendon,\r\n    widow of Thomas Peters, member for Clarendon; his second wife was\r\n    Bathusa, daughter of Florentius Vassall, of St. Elizabeth. His only\r\n    surviving son, Rose Herring May, was a member of the Council and\r\n    custos of Clarendon and Vere.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD MANNING, who died in 1756, aged 46, was a member of the House\r\n    of Assembly for Kingston in 1744, 1745–46, 1749 and 1752; and for\r\n    Portland in 1754–55, in which year he was chosen speaker. He and his\r\n    partner, James Ord (who also represented Kingston in the Assembly),\r\n    were considered the principal merchants of the island in their day.\r\n    In 1756 Manning was made a member of the Council. He was also custos\r\n    of Kingston. His wife was Elizabeth, the only sister of Henry Moore,\r\n    lieutenant-governor of Jamaica from 1756 to 1762, when he was\r\n    created a baronet; he became governor of New York in 1765. Moore’s\r\n    wife, Catherine Long (sister of the historian), gave her name to\r\n    Catherine’s Peak, the highest point in St. Andrew, as she was the\r\n    first lady to ascend it in 1760. Manning’s marriage with Elizabeth\r\n    Moore was, after the taking of evidence, dissolved in 1739 by an Act\r\n    of the legislature of the island, the co-respondent being Ballard\r\n    Beckford (a member of the House of Assembly and a relation of the\r\n    famous author of “Vathek”). This was the only Divorce Act ever\r\n    passed in Jamaica, the Assembly being told they were not to pursue\r\n    the same course again. The inscription on Manning’s monument is\r\n    given below, as only an abbreviation is given by Lawrence-Archer:\r\n\r\n                             Near this monument\r\n               Lies interred the Body of Edward Manning, Esq.\r\n                    One of the Honourable Privy Council\r\n                          Speaker of the Assembly\r\n                    And Custos Rotulorum of this Parish\r\n                In which Stations he distinguished himself.\r\n\r\n  A true patriot to his country, in Private life he was remarkable for\r\n    Filial Duty Steady Friendship and kind Benevolence to the Distressed\r\n    which with his affable Disposition gained him the\r\n\r\n             Esteem of all who had the Pleasure of knowing him.\r\n\r\n         He died greatly lamented December 6th 1756 aged 46 years.\r\n\r\n  COLONEL JAMES LAWRENCE, the third son of John Lawrence and Susanna\r\n    Petgrave, belonged to a family which was amongst the earliest and\r\n    most extensive landed proprietors in the parish of St. James. In\r\n    1739 they owned four out of eight sugar estates in the parish. It is\r\n    said, possibly without reason, that they were descended from Henry\r\n    Lawrence, President of Cromwell’s Council, to whose son Milton\r\n    addressed the sonnet, “Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son.”\r\n    John Lawrence emigrated to Barbados, coming on to Jamaica about\r\n    1675. James Lawrence was his grandson. In 1736 he commanded, as\r\n    captain, a party raised in St. James and St. Ann to suppress\r\n    rebellious negroes; the House of Assembly voting to “each white\r\n    shot, twenty shillings; each black shot, ten shillings; and each\r\n    baggage-negro, five shillings,” as a further encouragement to the\r\n    party. He subsequently became colonel of the St. James regiment. He\r\n    represented the parish of St. James in the three Assemblies which\r\n    were held in Kingston (the only Assemblies ever convened in that\r\n    town), which met on October 21, 1754, on January 20 and on April 8,\r\n    1755, when he supported the governor, Admiral Charles Knowles, in\r\n    his scheme for the transference of the legislature, courts and\r\n    public offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. Party feeling ran\r\n    high. Many of the Spanish Town party rendered the formation of a\r\n    quorum difficult by withdrawing themselves from meetings—the two\r\n    Prices, Roger Hope Elletson, William Nedham, Thomas Beach and\r\n    others, and refused to obey the summons of the Speaker for their\r\n    attendance. For this seventeen members were expelled the House, but\r\n    all but two were re-elected by their constituencies. The House sat\r\n    usually in the court house, but once it met at Wolmer’s school house\r\n    and at Hibbert house (the present Headquarters house, where the\r\n    legislative council now sits), and sometimes at Dr. Clarke’s house.\r\n    In 1755 Lawrence was made custos rotulorum of the parish of St.\r\n    James, and in that year he erected the square in Montego Bay, which\r\n    he called Charles Square, in honour of his friend and patron, the\r\n    governor. His wife, Mary, was daughter of Colonel Richard James, of\r\n    Hanover, who was the first child born of English parents in Jamaica.\r\n    Lawrence died at Kingston in 1756, aged forty-six. Lawrence-Archer’s\r\n    statement to the effect that “he was buried there 16th June” is made\r\n    in error to appear as though it was part of the inscription.\r\n\r\n  ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, who died at Kingston on December 16, 1780, in the\r\n    fifty-fourth year of his age, was the son of a divine of Edinburgh\r\n    of the same name. A classical scholar, he all his lifetime dabbled\r\n    in books; but he became purser of a man-of-war and led a wandering\r\n    and unsettled life. In 1745 William Falconer (author of the\r\n    “Shipwreck”), who was serving on the same ship, became his servant.\r\n    About 1760, on a long voyage, Campbell read the “Rambler,” and soon\r\n    afterwards at Pensacola wrote “Lexiphanes” and the “Sale of\r\n    Authors.” The former, a dialogue in imitation of Lucian, was\r\n    published in order to cast ridicule on Dr. Johnson’s style. Issued\r\n    anonymously in 1767, it was attributed by Sir John Hawkins to Dr.\r\n    Kenrick. It is not known when or why Campbell came to Jamaica.\r\n\r\n  RICHARD CARGILL, colonel of the St. Thomas Regiment of Foot Militia,\r\n    and member for that parish of the House of Assembly, died in 1781,\r\n    aged thirty-seven years. The first reference to the Cargill family\r\n    in Jamaica is to “one Cargill,” who is believed to have slain in a\r\n    duel Thomas, son of Colonel Peter Beckford, in 1731.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS HIGSON, a merchant of Kingston, who was born in 1773, succeeded\r\n    Macfadyen as island botanist and curator of the Gardens at Bath in\r\n    1828, which post he held till 1832. He presented to the garden a\r\n    collection of living plants collected by himself in South America.\r\n    He died in Kingston in 1836, in the sixty-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\n  VICE-ADMIRAL BARTHOLOMEW SAMUEL ROWLEY was the second son of\r\n    Vice-Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley. He was commander-in-chief at Jamaica\r\n    from 1809 till 1811, when he died on October 7, aged forty-seven\r\n    years. He was buried in the churchyard. A monument to him is over\r\n    the west door.\r\n\r\n  REAR-ADMIRAL WILLIAM BROWN was a member of an old Leicestershire\r\n    family. He was made a lieutenant in the Navy in 1788, a commander in\r\n    1792, and was raised to post rank in the next year. In 1794 he\r\n    served in the Channel under Lord Howe. In 1805 he took part in the\r\n    engagement off Cape Finisterre. He missed being present at Trafalgar\r\n    by going home to give evidence at Calder’s court-martial. He was\r\n    afterwards commissioner of the dockyards at Malta and at Sheerness.\r\n    He attained flag rank in 1812. He was commander-in-chief at Jamaica\r\n    in 1813–14. He died on September 20 in the latter year, after an\r\n    illness of five days. He is buried in the churchyard.\r\n\r\n  REV. FRANCIS HUMBERSTONE was born at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, in 1791,\r\n    and was trained at Newport-Pagnell college. He came to Jamaica in\r\n    1818 as curate of the parish of Kingston, and was appointed chaplain\r\n    to the Corporation of that town in the following year, at a salary\r\n    of £420 per annum, and chaplain to the 61st Regiment. He died on\r\n    August 9 in the same year after only nine months’ residence in the\r\n    island, in which time he made a reputation as a very fervent and\r\n    fearless preacher; preaching especially on behalf of the slaves. The\r\n    tablet to his memory was erected by the Corporation, which also paid\r\n    £210 to his widow.\r\n\r\n  REV. ISAAC MANN, M.A., was rector of Kingston from 1813 to 1828. He\r\n    was chaplain of the Provincial Grand Lodge, and Past Master of the\r\n    Sussex Lodge, No. 8, in Kingston. He died in 1828, aged fifty-one. A\r\n    monument was erected to his memory in the churchyard by the Brethren\r\n    of these Lodges.\r\n\r\n  DR. EDWARD NATHANIEL BANCROFT was born in London in 1772. He graduated\r\n    bachelor of medicine at Cambridge in 1794, and was in the following\r\n    year appointed physician to the Forces. In 1804 he took his degree\r\n    as M.D., and commenced to practise in London. He became a Fellow of\r\n    the Royal College of Physicians. In 1811 he gave up practice in\r\n    London and resumed his duties as physician of the Forces, and came\r\n    to Jamaica, where he resided till his death in Kingston in 1842,\r\n    when he held the post of deputy inspector-general of Army hospitals.\r\n    The mural tablet was erected to his memory “by the Physicians and\r\n    Surgeons of Jamaica.” One of his earliest writings was due to\r\n    conflict with his brother army medical officers—“Exposure of\r\n    misrepresentations by Dr. McGrigor and Dr. Jackson to the\r\n    Commissioners of Military Enquiry” (1808); but he is best remembered\r\n    by his “Essay on the Disease called Yellow Fever, with observations\r\n    concerning Febrile Contagion, Typhus Fever, Dysentery, and the\r\n    Plague, partly delivered as the Gulstonian Lectures before the\r\n    College of Physicians in the years 1806 and 1807” (1811 and 1817).\r\n    In 1839 he published in Jamaica “A Letter to the Hon. Hector\r\n    Mitchell on the proposed erection of a new Lunatic Asylum,” and in\r\n    the following year he issued another “representing the total\r\n    unfitness of the present Asylum for Lunatics, and the urgent\r\n    necessity for building a new Lunatic Asylum in a proper situation.”\r\n\r\n  HECTOR MITCHELL was elected mayor of Kingston in 1833 and held the\r\n    office till he died, aged eighty-four years, in 1853 at Kingston.\r\n    His body lay in state in the old court house, and his funeral was\r\n    attended by most of the prominent men of Jamaica. He was also custos\r\n    of Kingston. His portrait—a lithograph by A. Maurin, from a\r\n    daguerreotype by A. Duperly, printed for distribution when he\r\n    addressed the electors of Kingston in 1848—is in the Jamaica History\r\n    Gallery in the Institute.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD JORDAN, C.B., was born in 1800. He devoted himself to\r\n    journalism in early life, and for many years was connected with the\r\n    “Watchman” and the “Morning Journal.” While representing Kingston in\r\n    the House of Assembly he was in 1854 called to the Council, and on\r\n    that occasion received a testimonial from the inhabitants of the\r\n    island; but he resigned his seat to seek reelection in the Assembly\r\n    at the time of the introduction of the new constitution. He was\r\n    elected, and was furthermore made a member of the Governor’s\r\n    Executive Committee, which carried with it the leadership of the\r\n    Assembly. He also acted as Speaker. He represented Kingston till the\r\n    abolition of the House in 1866. He was appointed custos of Kingston\r\n    by Sir Charles Grey, and held the post till 1866. Governor Eyre\r\n    appointed him receiver-general, but he did not hold the post for\r\n    long; and he was appointed Governor’s Secretary, with which was\r\n    amalgamated on the death of the Hon. W. G. Stewart the Island\r\n    Secretaryship. He died in 1869 at his residence, Good Air, in St.\r\n    Andrew. On the Parade stands a monument of him erected by public\r\n    subscription. There is also a tablet to his memory in Halfway Tree\r\n    church. His portrait, an oil painting from life, is in the Jamaica\r\n    History Gallery in the Institute.\r\n\r\nAs in Lawrence-Archer many of the coats-of-arms are blazoned wrongly and\r\na few omitted, and as many of the arms on the slabs on the floor of the\r\nchurch were in danger of being completely, as some of them were then\r\npartly, effaced, it was thought desirable, some years before the\r\nearthquake of 1907, to describe all the armorial bearings in the church;\r\nand this was duly done in the “Jamaica Churchman” in 1902, and the\r\ndescriptions were reprinted in the “West India Committee Circular” for\r\nMarch 26, 1912.\r\n\r\nThe floor of a church, where they are subjected to the tread of many\r\nfeet, is not a good position in which to place monuments with a view to\r\ntheir preservation; but it is to be deplored that some other method of\r\nrendering the seats stable was not adopted by the architect in charge\r\nduring the alterations of 1883–85 than fastening them to the pavement by\r\niron clamps, many of which have actually been driven through armorial\r\ndesigns—that of Benbow not excepted.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been well said that “the village church is the village\r\nWestminster Abbey, in which every object commemorating our ancestors\r\nought to be sacred, small as well as great.” This applies with the\r\ngreater force to the principal church in the chief town of an ancient\r\ncolony. But, on the other hand, it must be admitted that even the\r\nancient stall-plates of the Knights of the Order of the Garter in St.\r\nGeorge’s, Windsor, have not altogether escaped damage at the\r\n“restorer’s” hands.\r\n\r\nAmongst the coats-of-arms alluded to above occur the following examples\r\nof allusive devices—the canting heraldry of England, the _armes\r\nparlantes_ of France—the asses of Askew, the bent bows of Benbow, the\r\nfern of Ferneley, the hinds of Hinde, and the vessel (both cup and ship)\r\nof Vassall; whilst amongst the mottoes we have the “Sanguis et vulnera”\r\nof Skinner. It may be of interest to note that the only arms in the\r\nchurch represented with supporters are those of Crawford.\r\n\r\nRubbings of the most interesting of the armorial bearings were made, for\r\npreservation in the Library of the Institute of Jamaica, by the Rev. W.\r\nB. Atherton, B.A.\r\n\r\nHakewill, writing in 1821, said, “The handsomest building in Kingston is\r\nthe =Scotch Church= in Duke street, which was erected about the year\r\n1814 by a public subscription from a plan of Mr. James Delaney.” This\r\nchurch was destroyed by the earthquake of 1907 and subsequently rebuilt\r\non the old foundations.\r\n\r\nWith the destruction of “Jasper Hall” in the earthquake of 1907,\r\n=Headquarters House=, as it is still called, in Duke street, became\r\npossessor of the undisputed title of the finest old house in Kingston.\r\nIts history is of interest.\r\n\r\nThe story goes that in the latter half of the eighteenth century four\r\nKingston merchants with great wealth and equally great ambition as to\r\nappearance—Jasper Hall, Thomas Hibbert, John Bull and another, made a\r\nheavy bet amongst themselves as to who should build the most magnificent\r\ndwelling. This resulted in Jasper Hall, till recently standing in High\r\nHolborn street; Headquarters House; Bull House, in North street; and the\r\nhouse to the north of the old “Mico” in Hanover street, once called\r\n“Harmony Hall.” The name of the winner of the bet is not recorded. It\r\nshould have been Jasper Hall.\r\n\r\nJasper Hall, who was receiver-general and speaker of the house of\r\nAssembly, died in 1778. As mentioned above, he was in 1774 one of the\r\ncommissioners for purchasing a pen for an official residence for the\r\nadmiral on the station. His house, which he named “Constantine House,”\r\nbore the date “June 1, 1756”; and not many years ago possessed what was\r\nprobably the best collection of paintings, engravings and books ever got\r\ntogether by a private individual in Jamaica. Unfortunately at the sale\r\nmany bibliographical treasures were allowed to leave the colony.\r\n\r\nThomas Hibbert, who arrived in Jamaica in 1734, soon became one of the\r\nprincipal and most opulent merchants in Jamaica. He was member of\r\nAssembly for St. George and for Portland, and speaker of the Assembly in\r\n1756. He died in 1780, and was buried at “Agualta Vale” pen in St. Mary.\r\nHis house was long known as Hibbert’s House.\r\n\r\nIn November 1755, when the Assembly was sitting in Kingston, it on the\r\n12th adjourned “to the dwelling house of Thomas Hibbert, Esquire, a\r\nmember of this House, where he and Colonel Lawrence, another member of\r\nthis House, are indisposed, there to proceed to business,” and the House\r\nmet there for several days. In December 1814 it was purchased by the War\r\nOffice of the widow of Dr. Solomon Deleon, of Kingston, and was\r\nthenceforward known as General’s House or Headquarters House. Although\r\nthe governor of the colony has ever held the rank of captain-general of\r\nthe forces, there has always been a general officer in actual command of\r\nthe troops; and in former days, and as late as 1895, such general held,\r\n_ex officio_, a commission as lieutenant-governor of the colony, and\r\nsucceeded to the control of affairs when occasion arose. The house still\r\nretains the name of Headquarters House, though it has been the colonial\r\nsecretary’s office since the government was removed from Spanish Town to\r\nKingston. It was purchased by the Government in 1872 for £5000. It also\r\ncontains the chamber in which the legislative council sits. The “Hibbert\r\nTrust” was founded by a member of this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DATE TREE HALL IN 1906\r\n]\r\n\r\nJohn Bull was the owner of Sheldon coffee estate in the Blue mountains.\r\nThe name of the builder of the house to the north of the Mico has not\r\nbeen recorded.\r\n\r\nAmongst those, many of them lieutenant-governors, who were general\r\nofficers commanding the forces in Jamaica while the headquarters of the\r\narmy were in Duke street, Kingston, were Archibald Campbell (1782–84),\r\nwho controlled military affairs at a troublous time for Jamaica, and by\r\nsending troops to act as marines materially assisted Rodney in his\r\nvictory over de Grasse; Sir Alured Clarke (1785–90), during whose tenure\r\nof office there was a succession of severe storms during one of which\r\nthe barracks at Up-Park Camp were blown down; Sir Adam Williamson\r\n(1790–95), who was in 1795 governor-general of that part of St. Domingo\r\nwhich was under the control of Great Britain; the Earl of Balcarres\r\n(1796–1801), who is chiefly remembered in connection with the Maroon\r\nwar; Sir George Nugent (1801–05), whose doings have been fully\r\nchronicled by his wife in her Journal; Sir Eyre Coote (1806–09), who had\r\nserved with distinction under Cornwallis in America, under Grey in the\r\nLeeward Islands, and in Egypt; Hugh Carmichael (1809), who had declined\r\nto let the House of Assembly interfere with a purely military matter—the\r\nmutiny at Port Augusta alluded to in the chapter on St.\r\nCatherine—eventually, but by the King’s command, had to appear before\r\nthat body, which grudgingly accepted the explanation offered; Edward\r\nMorrison (1811–14); Francis Fuller (1814–17); Henry Conran (1817–23);\r\nSir John Keane (1823–30), who had served under Wellington in the\r\nPeninsula, and while in Jamaica took part in the attack on New Orleans,\r\nand later served with distinction in India; Sir Willoughby Cotton\r\n(1831–37), who in Bermuda had had Havelock as his aide-de-camp, and in\r\nJamaica suppressed the rebellion in St. James; Sir William Maynard Gomm\r\n(1839–42), at one time governor and commander-in-chief of the Windward\r\nand Leeward Islands; Sackville Hamilton Berkeley; Samuel Lambert; Thomas\r\nBunbury; Sir Richard Doherty; Edward Wells Bell; Pringle Taylor; Charles\r\nAshmore; and lastly Luke Smythe O’Connor all of whose regimental\r\ncommissions were in the 1st West India Regiment, and who was in command\r\nof the troops during the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865.\r\n\r\nThe old Mico Institution in Hanover street—now used as a technical\r\nschool, and for a few years after the earthquake of 1907 used as the\r\nsupreme court of the colony—was the original home of the Mico College,\r\nwhich is now removed to St. Andrew.\r\n\r\nWith their destruction by the earthquake in 1907 Kingston lost two\r\nimportant old-time houses in Blundell Hall and Date Tree Hall, at the\r\nlower end of East street. Both had been in former days boarding-houses.\r\nLatterly the former had served as the home of a part of the Post Office,\r\nthe latter as that of the Institute of Jamaica, founded in 1879.\r\n=Blundell Hall= was for some years under the proprietorship of Mary\r\nSeacole, a native of Jamaica, well known in connection with her kindness\r\nto the sick and wounded of the British soldiers in the Crimea, where she\r\nfilled the position of sutler, having failed to obtain that of nurse.\r\nSir William Russell wrote a preface to her “Adventures,” published in\r\n1857. Seacole Cottage in Duke street was named after her.\r\n\r\nThe reconstructed =Institute of Jamaica= possesses several objects of\r\nconsiderable historic interest. Besides the Arawâk pottery and\r\nimplements and the slave branding-iron alluded to in the Introduction,\r\nthere is a cage in which criminals were hung to die of starvation, as\r\nlate as the early days of the nineteenth century. There is also the\r\nChancellor’s purse for holding the official seal of the colony,\r\nrecalling the days when the governor sat as chancellor, which lasted up\r\nto the passing of the judicature law of 1879.\r\n\r\nThe following—taken from “The State of Jamaica under Sir Thomas Lynch,\r\n1683,” printed in “The Laws of Jamaica” (London, 1684)—is the earliest\r\nreference to the Seal of the Island:\r\n\r\n  The King has been pleased to honour this Island with a large guilt\r\n  Mace, as a signal Mark of his Favour, and to make the Government\r\n  appear more great and formal: It’s carried before the Governour and\r\n  Chancellour on Solemn Occasions.\r\n\r\n  The King has likewise honoured this Island with Arms, and with a\r\n  publick Broad Seal; and on one side of it his Majesty is seated on his\r\n  Throne, with two _Indians_ on their knees, presenting him _Fruits_,\r\n  and two Cherubins aloft, supporting a Canopy; underneath his Feet,\r\n  this _Motto_:\r\n\r\n                _Duro de Cortice fructus quam Dulces?_[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n    How sweet the fruit the hard rind yields.\r\n\r\n  The Inscription about it is, _Carolus Secundus Dei gratia, &c. Dominus\r\n  Jamaicæ_; On the other side is an Escutcheon, bearing a Cross charged\r\n  with five Pines; two _Indians_ for the Supporters and for the _Crest_\r\n  an _Alligator_. The Inscription in the Orle, Inclosing all, is\r\n\r\n                   _Ecce alium Ramos porrexit in orbem\r\n                        Nec sterilis crux est_[6]\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n    Behold! the Cross hath spread its arms into another world, and\r\n    beareth fruit.\r\n\r\n  The _Motto_ underneath the Escutcheon is,\r\n\r\n                      _Indus Uterq: serviet uni_[7]\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n    The Indians twain shall serve one Lord.\r\n\r\n  All this, as I have heard, was designed by the present Lord Archbishop\r\n  of _Canterbury_, in the year 1661, and the Seal then delivered to Sir\r\n  _Charles Littleton_, that came hither Chancellour, for the\r\n  Chancellours always keep it, and with it Seal all Publick Grants,\r\n  Commissions, Patents &c.\r\n\r\n  The King by a Clause in the Commission for the Government, appoints\r\n  the Governour to be Chancellour, as judging it fittest to entrust him\r\n  with the Equity, who is to see the Laws executed, and not thinking it\r\n  for the good of his Subjects to have many great Officers in a young\r\n  Colony; and that if the Seal were in private hands it would be erected\r\n  into an Office: Now its worth little or nothing. For the Chancellour\r\n  has no Fee, only for granting Land and that amounts to very little\r\n  now....\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of a purse, but one was probably sent out with the\r\nSeal and Counter-Seal.\r\n\r\nLawrence-Archer—misled by Bridges, who, ignoring the “present,” simply\r\nsays, “This seal was designed by the Archbishop of Canterbury”—says, “At\r\nthat time (1662) the Metropolitan See was filled by William Juxon.” It\r\nis true that Lord Windsor came to Jamaica while Juxon was archbishop of\r\nCanterbury (1660 to 1663), but Sancroft occupied the see in 1683, when\r\nthe sentence quoted from the Records of the house of Assembly was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThe only Jamaica chancellor’s purse that is known to exist to-day is\r\nthat which is now in the history gallery of the Institute, whither it\r\nwas transferred from the supreme court office some years ago.\r\n\r\nNo mention of the purse has hitherto been found in any of the histories:\r\nit is not even mentioned by Lady Nugent, who makes frequent references\r\nto her husband, Sir George Nugent, sitting as chancellor. Bryan Edwards\r\nsays, “The Governor or Commander-in-chief is chancellor of his office,\r\nand presides solely in that high department, which is administered with\r\ngreat form and solemnity.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem evident that a new purse was not supplied each year. In\r\nfact there is no evidence that any later purse than this dating from the\r\ntime of George III has ever been in use in the colony.\r\n\r\nIn form and character and size it is just like the purses used in\r\nEngland. Like them, it measures 1 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 4 in., and is made\r\nof red velvet. The arms of Jamaica (with the cross gules, be it\r\nobserved) are in the centre, and are surmounted by the arms of England\r\nat the time of George III. At the base are two cornucopias, and on each\r\nside is a decorative border of roses and other flowers. It is\r\nembroidered with gold and silver thread and coloured silk, ornamented\r\nwith beads. It has suffered by wear and neglect.\r\n\r\nThe mace was evidently the property of the governor, and was probably\r\nused when the council met.\r\n\r\nThe council is known to have sat on the fatal June 7, 1692; and in the\r\nJournals of the house of Assembly is this entry:\r\n\r\n  June 7, 1692.—This day happened the great earthquake which destroyed\r\n  Port Royal, and did great injury throughout the island: The Council\r\n  had previously met in that town, and it is probable were sitting when\r\n  it commenced, as no adjournment is entered that day in the Journal.\r\n\r\nThis is not correct, as the president was with the rector.\r\n\r\nThe next record we find of a mace is on December 1, 1763, when the house\r\nof Assembly resolved: “That the Receiver-General do send to his\r\ncorrespondent in England, to purchase a silver mace gilt, of the same\r\nsize, for the use of the Speaker of the House, as that used by the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons; and that this or any future Assembly\r\nwill make the same good.”\r\n\r\nThe older of the two maces at present in the Institute was possibly\r\nimported as the result of this resolution. It is silver-gilt, measures 5\r\nft. 6 in. high and weighs 297 oz. 5 dwt., and is thus both higher and\r\nheavier than the mace of the House of Commons. It is surmounted by a\r\nroyal crown, on the base of which are the British coat-of-arms as used\r\nfrom 1714 to 1801, and the letters G. R. (Georgius Rex). Round the head,\r\nin panels divided by caryatides, are the emblems of England and\r\nScotland, Ireland and France, and the arms of Jamaica. It bears the\r\nLondon hall marks and date letter of the year 1753, and the initials M.\r\nF. of the maker, Mordecai Fox of London.\r\n\r\nThe other mace evidently came as the result of the resolution of the\r\nAssembly of December 22, 1786: “That the Receiver-General do immediately\r\nremit to the agent the sum of £300 to be by him laid out in the purchase\r\nof robes for the Speaker, and a mace.” Four years later they voted £200\r\nfor a coach to be obtained from England. The mace is similar in\r\nappearance, but of a little later date, measures also 5 ft. 6 in. high,\r\nand is also surmounted by a royal crown on the base of which is the same\r\nform of the British coat-of-arms; and round the head are the same\r\nemblems of England and Scotland, France and Ireland, and the arms of\r\nJamaica. It bears the London hall marks and date letter of the year\r\n1787, and the initials H. G. of the maker, Henry Green of London, whose\r\ninitials are on a piece bearing the mark of the same year in the hall of\r\nthe Clothworkers Company, London, and who also made the Grenada mace,\r\nwhich dates from 1781, and which is almost as massive as the Jamaica\r\nmace of 1753. The Barbados mace, which dates from 1812, is 4 ft. 4 in.\r\nhigh. The head of the Jamaica 1787 mace has at some time been bent by a\r\nblow, and should stand up in the same manner as that of the older one.\r\nThis is not to be wondered at when we read of the stormy meetings held\r\nin the last century by the house of assembly.\r\n\r\nThese two maces were used, the one at the meetings of the house of\r\nAssembly, the other at those of the legislative council. One or other of\r\nthem was used at the meetings of the privy council until some time in\r\nSir John Peter Grant’s administration, when its use was discontinued.\r\nThey were both deposited in the Institute of Jamaica in 1879, and were\r\nshown at the exhibition in 1891.\r\n\r\nOf the public monuments in Kingston the principal is the =Statue of Sir\r\nCharles Metcalfe=.\r\n\r\nHigh on a list of those governors who have left their mark on Jamaica\r\nhistory stands the name of Metcalfe, the only governor to whom the\r\ncolony has erected a statue. Without seeking it, Metcalfe gained\r\neverywhere where his work lay such popular esteem as finds expression in\r\nstatues and addresses, while he received the sincere regard of those\r\nwith whom he came in close contact. Coming in September, 1839, when\r\nrelations between the planters and the British government on the one\r\nhand and the emancipated slaves on the other had become very strained\r\nover questions arising out of the recent abolition of slavery, he, by\r\nthe same tactful manner which he had employed in India with marked\r\nsuccess, did much to reconcile the differences; and when he left Jamaica\r\nthree years later it was amidst the genuine regret of all classes of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nCharles Theophilus Metcalfe, the son of a major in the Bengal army, who\r\nlater became a director of the East India company, was born at Calcutta\r\nin 1785. He was one of a family of six; the boys all had, in addition to\r\nanother, the name Theophilus, the girls Theophila. After spending five\r\nyears at Eton, where he did much “sapping,” he, to his own regret at\r\nhaving to leave, entered the East India service at the early age of\r\nfifteen. By the time he was nineteen he was earning £1000 a year; and\r\nafter working in several important branches of the service as special\r\ncommissioner, and as president at Delhi, and at Hyderabad, where he\r\nincurred the displeasure of the governor-general by his fearless methods\r\nof pressing reforms, he became in 1827 a member of the supreme council,\r\non which he sat for nearly seven years. In 1832 he succeeded his brother\r\nin the baronetcy which had been bestowed upon his father, and in 1836 he\r\nreceived the Grand Cross of the Bath in reward for his distinguished\r\nservices. In 1835–36 he held provisionally the post of governor-general\r\nof India, at which he had confidently aimed from almost the commencement\r\nof his career, and he only lost the actual position, to which he was\r\nnominated by the court of directors, because the ministry did not\r\nconsider it advisable to appoint one so experienced as Metcalfe in\r\nIndian affairs to that high office, which they wished to bestow on their\r\nown nominee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STATUE OF SIR CHARLES METCALFE\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlways a Liberal in politics and wide in his sympathies, he during his\r\ntenure of office gave offence to the directors of the company by his\r\naction in removing the restrictions on the liberty of the press, and\r\nthis led ultimately to his resignation from the company’s service.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of rest in England from official labours, he was in 1839\r\nmade governor of Jamaica, two former governors of which colony—Sir\r\nAlured Clarke and Sir George Nugent—he had incidentally met in India. He\r\nwas made a privy councillor “as a mark of consideration for his past\r\nservices and a tribute to the importance of the office he was about to\r\nassume.”\r\n\r\nThe sending of an East Indian official as governor to the West Indies\r\nwas then an unusual occurrence, but the undoubted success achieved by\r\nMetcalfe led to greater frequency in the custom. Somewhat tired of\r\nadministrative work, a lover of a quiet life and with some parliamentary\r\nambition, he only accepted the office because he knew that the affairs\r\nof the colony were in disorder, and he looked upon it as a duty to his\r\ncountry to be at the call of the Colonial Office.\r\n\r\nThe few years that had elapsed since Emancipation had not proved\r\nsufficient in Jamaica to efface differences of opinion and produce\r\nharmony where conflicting interests were rife. The apprenticeship system\r\nhad broken down the year before, and total abolition had come into\r\neffect. Trouble had arisen between the Assembly and the Home Government.\r\nThe Assembly considered the passing of the West India Prisons bill an\r\naggression on their rights, and declined to perform any legislative\r\nfunctions not absolutely necessary, until those rights were restored.\r\nThe British Government retorted by threatening to suspend the\r\nconstitution of Jamaica, and a measure was ultimately passed which\r\nincreased the powers possessed by the governor. Metcalfe was selected as\r\na possibly popular governor to tide over a critical period of great\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival he saw that the existence of the stipendiary magistrates,\r\nwhich body had been formed with a view to counteracting the alleged lack\r\nof justice on the part of the local magistracy composed chiefly of the\r\nplanters and their attorneys, was a means of keeping alive the ill-will\r\nbetween the planters and the emancipated slaves and their well-wishers;\r\nand he therefore decided to let the scheme gradually die out, by\r\nabstaining from filling up vacancies as they arose.\r\n\r\nIn his work of conciliation Metcalfe did not hesitate to controvert the\r\nopinions of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to point out to\r\nhim the error of his views in certain cases.\r\n\r\nHe achieved the at that time difficult task of gaining the esteem alike\r\nof the white and the black population, and he did much to remove the\r\nmutual mistrust existing between them. The only sect in sympathy with\r\nwhom he found it difficult to work was the Baptist community, who wished\r\nhim to be hostile to the planters and were displeased by his absolute\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\nIn November 1841 he considered that the purpose of his visit had been\r\nachieved, and he resigned his office. By his honesty of purpose and the\r\nconciliatory nature of his methods of work he had endeared himself to\r\nalmost all.\r\n\r\nAs his mission had been one of smoothing over difficulties arising from\r\na recent legal and social upheaval, it obviously was not a time for\r\ngreat administrative changes; but while he was in Jamaica the judicial\r\nsystem and the criminal code were amended, the military cantonment at\r\nNewcastle was established, and the salary of the governor was put on a\r\nmore satisfactory and permanent basis.\r\n\r\nMetcalfe had his portrait painted twice in Jamaica—once by a Danish\r\nartist, a full-size, half-length, which he sent home to his aunt, Mrs.\r\nManson: the other, a full-length, by another artist, “was intended for\r\nthe town hall of our principal city Kingston.” Where is that portrait\r\nnow? There is a portrait of him, by a very mediocre painter, in the\r\ncourt house at Old Harbour, and a full-length standing painting, dated\r\n1846, and signed by A. Bradish, in the Town Hall at Falmouth. The\r\nportrait of him by F. R. Say in the Oriental Club, a copy of the\r\nengraving after which by F. E. Lewis is in the Jamaica history gallery\r\nin the Institute, was painted between his return to England from Jamaica\r\nand his going to Canada. Another portrait in the same gallery is a\r\nmezzotint engraving by William Warner of Philadelphia, after a painting\r\nby A. Bradish, executed in 1844, representing him half-length seated.\r\nThis print, published at Montreal, was dedicated to Sir Robert Peel. It\r\nshows the left side of the face, the right having by that time been\r\ndisfigured by the sad malady which caused his death.\r\n\r\nMetcalfe on leaving Jamaica received addresses.\r\n\r\n“On May 21, 1842,” says Sir John William Kaye, in his life of Metcalfe,\r\n“Sir Charles Metcalfe once again embarked for England. The scene will\r\nnever be forgotten by those who witnessed it. From even the most distant\r\nplaces crowds of people of all classes had come to see for the last\r\ntime, and to say God-speed to, the Governor whose public and private\r\nvirtues they so loved and revered. The old island militiamen, who had\r\nnot been called out for years, volunteered to form his escort. The\r\n‘coloured population knelt to bless him.’ Many present on that occasion,\r\nat once so gratifying and so painful to the departing statesman, felt\r\nthat they had lost a friend who could never be replaced. All classes of\r\nsociety and all sects of Christians sorrowed for his departure; and the\r\nJews set an example of Christian love by praying for him in their\r\nsynagogues.\r\n\r\n“He went—but the statue voted by the Island, and erected in the public\r\nsquare of Spanish Town, is not a more enduring record of his residence\r\nin Jamaica than the monument which he has made for himself in the hearts\r\nof a grateful people.”\r\n\r\nIn 1843–45 he was governor-general of Canada, a post of extreme\r\ndifficulty at that time, and held by him with considerable tact and\r\nfirmness while he himself was practically dying. He displayed much\r\npatience under the greatest provocation. He had there the support of\r\nthat empire-builder Wakefield, who said of him that God had made him\r\ngreater than the Colonial Office. In 1845 he was created Baron Metcalfe.\r\nIn the securing of this honour the valuable services which he rendered\r\nin connection with Jamaica played an important part. In fact it may\r\nfairly be said that had the Whigs and not the Tories been in power when\r\nhe left that island the peerage would have been conferred on him then.\r\nHe never took his seat in the House of Lords, and the title died with\r\nhim the following year, the baronetcy going to his younger brother.\r\nDuring the latter part of his life he had borne great suffering with\r\nheroic patience.\r\n\r\nHe was short in stature and somewhat homely in appearance; but he had an\r\nintelligent countenance and an habitually sweet smile. He was of a most\r\nlovable disposition. Though intensely hospitable he really disliked\r\nsociety and preferred the companionship of a few friends, but he lived\r\ncontinually in harness either social or official. He was at all times of\r\nhis life a poor horseman; he had tried in vain to learn in India, and\r\ntravelling in the hilly parts of Jamaica must have been a painful task\r\nfor him. He writes: “I have got some steady horses and ponies which suit\r\nme pretty well. Any but steady ones would soon tumble me over a\r\nprecipice.”\r\n\r\nOf his country residence, Highgate, to which he retreated from Spanish\r\nTown whenever the calls of office permitted, he wrote, “If climate were\r\neverything I should prefer living on this spot to any other that I know\r\nin the world.”\r\n\r\nLiberal and generous by disposition, he yet succeeded in saving from his\r\nofficial salaries and the interest of his investments a sufficient\r\nfortune to have maintained with credit the peerage which had been\r\nbestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nOn his quitting Jamaica the Assembly voted £3000 for the statue, which\r\nfor many years looked down King street, Kingston, to which spot it had\r\nbeen removed from Spanish Town, where it was originally erected on the\r\nsite of the present court house, opposite Rodney’s statue. It was\r\noriginally intended to have a temple and colonnade like Rodney’s, but\r\nthe funds did not prove sufficient and the scheme was abandoned. In 1898\r\nthe statue was removed to make way for a statue of Queen Victoria, when\r\nit was placed at the foot of King street, on the pedestal which had for\r\nsome years supported Bacon’s statue of Rodney during its temporary\r\nabsence from Spanish Town.\r\n\r\nMetcalfe’s statue has proved more enduring than the parish which, formed\r\nfrom parts of St. George and St. Mary and named after him in 1841, was\r\nmerged into St. Mary in 1867 by Grant’s reduction of the parishes from\r\ntwenty-two to fourteen. The statue is by Edward Hodges Baily, R.A., a\r\npupil of Flaxman, and a sculptor of high aims and pure ideals, by whom\r\nthere is also a bust of Metcalfe in the Metcalfe Hall, Calcutta.\r\n\r\nHe is represented bare-headed, and wearing the insignia of the Bath. The\r\nstatue on its double pedestal stands too high to be well seen. On the\r\nfront of the original pedestal is the following inscription, now almost\r\nillegible from the ground, partly because of its great height and partly\r\nbecause the painting has worn off the letters:\r\n\r\n                              THIS STATUE\r\n                         IS ERECTED IN HONOR OF\r\n       THE RT. HON. SIR CHARLES THEOPHILUS METCALFE, BART, K.C.B.\r\n                           NOW BARON METCALFE\r\n                 BY THE GRATEFUL INHABITANTS OF JAMAICA\r\n                            IN COMMEMORATION\r\n                      OF THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM\r\n              HIS WISE, JUST AND BENEFICIAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n                    OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAND\r\n                               A.D. 1845.\r\n\r\nOn the west face are the arms of Jamaica (on which the cross is tricked\r\n_or_ instead of _gules_, and the crest is placed on an esquire’s\r\nhelmet); on the east those of Metcalfe. On the back is an emblematic\r\ndesign with figures of Justice and Mercy on either side of an altar on\r\nwhich rests an anchor.\r\n\r\nOn the lower pedestal, erected originally to receive Rodney’s statue, is\r\nplaced an earthenware tablet (similar to those erected by the Royal\r\nSociety of Arts in London) which was put up by the Institute of Jamaica\r\nin 1892 to record the fact that:\r\n\r\n                          12 FEET WEST OF THE\r\n                        CENTRE OF THE PEDESTAL,\r\n                            COMMANDER GREEN,\r\n                       U.S.N. IN 1875 ERECTED THE\r\n                          LONGITUDE STATION OF\r\n                      KINGSTON AND FOUND IT TO BE\r\n                    5h. 7m. 10·65 s. (76° 47′ 39·8″)\r\n                           WEST OF GREENWICH.\r\n                                  I.J.\r\n\r\nThe great weight of this lower pedestal enabled the statue to stand the\r\nearthquake of 1907 unmoved; while every other statue in Kingston was\r\neither thrown down or slued round on its base.\r\n\r\n“Selections from the Papers of Lord Metcalfe” contain papers from\r\nJamaica, dealing with such divers subjects as the Conditions of the\r\nIsland; the Social Condition of the People; the Labour Question; the\r\nStipendiary Magistrate; the Governor’s Salary; Reforms of the Judicial\r\nSystem; Advantages of Conciliation; Prison Discipline; the Health of the\r\nTroops, and Answers to Addresses from the parishes of St. Catherine, St.\r\nAnn and St. Thomas; the Missionary Presbytery and the St. George’s\r\nAgricultural Society. The “Addresses” themselves, to the number of\r\nthirty-nine from all sections of the community, were published in\r\nJamaica in 1842.\r\n\r\nFrom this volume we learn that the first proposal to erect a statue to\r\nMetcalfe in St. Jago de la Vega was made and adopted at a meeting of the\r\ninhabitants of St. Catherine held on March 17, 1842, and this was\r\nsupported by meetings held in many of the parishes. There was, however,\r\na counter proposal to have a statue in Kingston. St. Jago de la Vega won\r\nthen, but time has brought revenge to Kingston. In 1847 £200 was paid by\r\nthe Assembly for a temple for the statue of Metcalfe, and they voted\r\n“£1500 for its removal and erection” in front of the Assembly Room and\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Christian Lilly laid out the town of Kingston in 1692, he\r\nleft in the centre a plaza or square after the Spanish method of\r\ncolonial town-planning. In the eighteenth century barracks were erected\r\nto the north-west corner of this square, and the space to the south was\r\nfor many years utilised as a parade-ground, as shown in Adolphe\r\nDuperly’s view in his “Daguerian Excursions in Jamaica,” published about\r\n1844. Later on the barracks were abandoned by the troops, and they are\r\nnow utilised for police-court purposes. The ornamental gardens were laid\r\nout in 1870 in the centre of the old military parade, whence they became\r\nknown as the Parade Gardens; a wide space being left as roadway to the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nAt the instance of a Committee appointed to report on the most suitable\r\nway to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, £800 was voted by the\r\nLegislature in March 1897 for a =Statue to Queen Victoria= in addition\r\nto £700 for local rejoicings.\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended to place the statue at the front of the block\r\nof buildings which was in contemplation; but, as retrenchment then\r\ninterfered with the project, the statue was erected at the top of King’s\r\nstreet, on the base erected for the statue of Lord Metcalfe when it was\r\nremoved from Spanish Town. Owing to its small size it is to be regretted\r\nthat the statue was not placed somewhere indoors, or at all events not\r\non so high a pedestal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  QUEEN VICTORIA’S STATUE\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is a replica of a statue erected in the hall of the Colonial Office\r\nat Singapore in connection with the Jubilee of 1887, by E. Edward\r\nGeflowski, who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1867 to 1872.\r\n\r\nThe statue cost in all about £800. A plaster cast that was used for the\r\nunveiling, in connection with the Jubilee rejoicings, is now at King’s\r\nHouse, Spanish Town. Another copy is in the Imperial Institute, London.\r\n\r\nIn February of 1914 the Victoria League of Jamaica asked the Mayor and\r\nCouncil of Kingston to consider the desirability of re-naming the Parade\r\nGardens the Victoria Park, and suggested that, if they approved,\r\noccasion should be taken of the presence of Her Highness Princess Marie\r\nLouise of Schleswig-Holstein, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on\r\nFebruary 4, to ask her Highness to perform the ceremony, as it was felt\r\nthat it would be well if the memory of Queen Victoria should be\r\nperpetuated in the centre of the principal town of the Colony, the more\r\nespecially as it was in close proximity to the statue of her late\r\nMajesty. The Mayor and Council fell in with the suggestion, the consent\r\nof the Governor was obtained, and Her Highness the Princess renamed the\r\nGardens on February 4. Although the Gardens have been fittingly named\r\nafter Queen Victoria, dear to the hearts of all Jamaicans, it is to be\r\nhoped the surrounding buildings will still retain the name of Parade,\r\nand thus help to recall the days when the central part was made gay by\r\nmany a military uniform.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the Gardens stands a full-length statue by R. G.\r\nMiller, R.A., of =Edward Jordan=, C.B., “who through a long series of\r\nyears and in times of danger, fearlessly stood forward as the champion\r\nof Emancipation and for the removal of civil disabilities,” erected by\r\npublic subscription. The statue of another distinguished Jamaican, =Dr.\r\nLewis Quier Bowerbank=, was erected in the year 1881, on the northern\r\nside, by his numerous friends and admirers; but a third statue, that of\r\n=Father Dupont=, a Roman Catholic priest who for many years laboured\r\namong the poor of the city, erected at the north-east corner, was\r\ndestroyed by the earthquake of 1907.\r\n\r\nOther monuments of interest in Kingston are a bust portrait of the =Rev.\r\nJohn Radcliffe= (preacher and poet), in the Scotch church, by Sir Thomas\r\nBrock, R.A., erected by public subscription in 1896, which, though\r\nburied under the ruins of the porch, escaped serious injury in the\r\nearthquake of 1907, and a memorial tablet to the =Rev. William James\r\nGardner= (Congregational minister and historian) in the Congregational\r\nchurch, North street, erected after his death, which occurred in 1874.\r\n\r\nAmongst disused burial-grounds are the Stranger’s Burial-Ground\r\n(earliest tomb is dated 1753) and the Spring Path Burial-Ground, both by\r\nthe Railway Station (earliest tomb is dated 1794); the Baptist Ground,\r\nin the Windward Road (earliest tomb dated 1801); the Wesleyan Methodist\r\nCemetery at the corner of Windward Road and Elletson Road (earliest tomb\r\ndated 1791); the Jewish Cemetery in Elletson Road (the earliest tomb\r\ndated 1797); the Jewish Cemeteries at the south-east and south-west\r\ncorners of Church and North streets (in the former the earliest tomb\r\ndated 1719), all contain monuments of historic interest.\r\n\r\nIn view of recent interest evinced in the question of wharf\r\naccommodation it may be well to republish a “List and Situation of the\r\nPublic Wharves in Kingston, running East and West,” which appeared in\r\nthe “Columbian Magazine” (Kingston) in 1800—one hundred and fifteen\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n  I.

ANDREW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Andrew was originally called Liguanea, and the name\r\nstill lingers round the plain. It now consists of what before the\r\npassing of law 20 of 1867 comprised the parish of Port Royal and the\r\nparish of St. Andrew, less the parts known as Smith’s Village, Hannah’s\r\nTown, Fletcher’s Town, and the town of Port Royal. There are no towns in\r\nSt. Andrew; the principal villages being Halfway Tree, Gordon Town and\r\nStony Hill.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known reference to Halfway Tree on record occurs in the\r\nminutes of the Council of January 4, 1696, when “the Governor acquainted\r\nthe Board that he had been informed that Mr. Redman Maccragh, Mr. Henry\r\nArchbold, and others had assembled together att halfeway tree in the\r\nparish of St. Andrews and had obleiged severall of His Majesty’s\r\nsubjects passing that way to drink a health to the late K. James, which\r\nwas lookt upon by the Board to be a great misdemeanour,” and it was\r\nordered that all persons concerned should appear before the Board the\r\nnext Council day; but this apparently they discreetly abstained from\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nIt derives its name from a cotton tree dating from the conquest, which\r\nexisted as late as 1866. Richard Hill, in an article which was published\r\nposthumously in the “Victoria Quarterly” in 1890, said:\r\n\r\n  “I visited Halfway Tree on Sunday the 25th November, 1866. When I\r\n  first saw the cotton tree at the junction of the four roads through\r\n  the plain of Liguanea from which Halfway Tree receives its name, it\r\n  had nearly lived out its time. It is of that lofty straight-stemmed\r\n  variety of Eriondendron which originally growing among some clustering\r\n  trees had overtopped them and had spread its horizontal arms out above\r\n  them at about some fifty or sixty feet in elevation from the root.\r\n  Four or five of these arms yet remained with a few scattering stems on\r\n  which a few straggling leaves vegetated. An age of surface rains\r\n  rushing to the sea three miles away had removed all the soluble earth\r\n  from the platform roots, so that they made arched resting places,\r\n  where the marketers coming from the mountains would rest themselves in\r\n  groups for they had reached the Halfway Tree.... At the time of the\r\n  conquest of the island 200 years ago, the Halfway Tree was one of\r\n  those tall and solitary cotton trees of the Liguanea Plain.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that no illustration exists of this interesting\r\ntree, which has perished since Hill wrote. It stood near the present\r\nchurch, where the original road (now known as the old Pound Road) going\r\nfrom Passage Fort, the landing-place from Port Royal, direct towards the\r\nmountains, was cut by the road that went from Spanish Town to the plain\r\nof St. Andrew.\r\n\r\nLong the historian says: “The village of Halfway Tree is situated ... at\r\nthe intersection of the three roads which lead to Spanish Town, St.\r\nMary, and St. George,” and this probably is the origin of the name.\r\n\r\nThe ascription of the name to the half-way position for the troops\r\nbetween Greenwich on the Harbour and Stony Hill is evidently wrong, as\r\nthe troops were not placed at Stony Hill till 1799.\r\n\r\nThe =Old Burial-Ground, Halfway Tree=, is the name usually given to the\r\ndisused graveyard on the road between King’s House and the Constant\r\nSpring road, where the Waterloo road crosses it on its way to the foot\r\nof the hills. Standing on land falling away towards Sandy Gully, it is\r\nsaid to be the site of the first church erected by the English in St.\r\nAndrew, one of the seven parishes into which the island was originally\r\ndivided by Sir Thomas Modyford in 1664; but there are now no evidences\r\nof the foundations to be seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 Sir Thomas Lynch sent home to the Bishop of London a detailed\r\naccount of “this infant church” in Jamaica. Of Halfway Tree he wrote:\r\n“On the north side of Port Royal harbour lies St. Andrews, where Mr.\r\nCellier, a Swiss, is minister. It is the pleasantest part of the Island,\r\nwith an ordinary church and a pretty parsonage house. The minister has\r\n£100 a year, he is an honest man and well beloved. Colonel Beeston can\r\ntell you about him.”\r\n\r\nThe second church was erected near where the present fabric stands; the\r\nfoundation stone being laid on January 12, 1686, according to the\r\nfollowing extract from the early vestry minutes:—“1686, January 12,\r\nPrayers at the old church and a sermon from Gen. ch. 28, v. 16, 17. The\r\nfirst brick of the new church laid by the Rev. Mr. Zeller, the second by\r\nCol. Sam. Barry.” The building of this church had evidently been\r\ncontemplated for some time, a previous entry, under date July 28, 1684,\r\nreading “Agree about building the new intended Church.” James Zellers, a\r\nSwiss by birth, came out to Jamaica in 1664 and was at once appointed to\r\nSt. Andrew, which parish he served for thirty-six years. Colonel Barry,\r\nwho owned Cavaliers, was one of the largest landowners in the parish.\r\nThe second church was destroyed by the earthquake of 1692. In “The\r\nTruest and Largest Account of the Late Earthquake in Jamaica ... written\r\nby a Reverend Divine there ... London, 1693,” it is thus referred to:\r\n“From thence it is but a short way to _Ligania_, the first and principal\r\nplace for Planting, (whereunto my own parish is immediately the next)\r\nwhich for the most part imitating, if not Exceeding the stateliness of\r\nPort Royal, is now, together with its fine New Built and not yet\r\nfinished Church, buried in the same Ruines with the Houses.” This old\r\nground was used for interment long after the present church was built;\r\nin fact, as late as 1862.\r\n\r\nThe registers of the church of St. Andrew at Halfway Tree, dating back\r\nto 1666, are the oldest in the island. They contain many records of\r\ninterest. Unfortunately, the entries for the early years are only a\r\ntranscript of about the middle of the eighteenth century, the same\r\nhandwriting extending to the year 1741. The first entry of baptism\r\nextant is that of Grace, daughter of Edward Onion, under date June 10,\r\n1666. The earliest marriage is that of John Wilson and Anne Zeale on\r\nJune 7, 1666; and the first death Arabella Joanes, on July 4, 1666.\r\n\r\nAmongst those who lie in the old burial-ground are George Bennett, of\r\nDorsetshire family, “who came here a soldier under General Venables”;\r\nHenry Dakins, who died in 1683; Major Samuel Guy, who died in 1736; and\r\n“Edward, the soven (_sic_) of William and Anne Beeston, who dyed this\r\n5th day of August, 1678, being above the age of ... months,” and “Henry\r\nthe sonne of William and Anne Beeston who dyed the first day of May,\r\n1677, being about the age of 14 months.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HALFWAY-TREE CHURCH IN 1906\r\n]\r\n\r\nSir William Beeston was governor of Jamaica from 1693 to 1701. His\r\ndaughter Jane married firstly Sir Thomas Modyford, the fifth and last\r\nbaronet, and secondly, Charles Long, of Longville, son of Samuel Long\r\nwho came out with Penn and Venables as secretary to Cromwell’s\r\nCommission, and rose to fame. With his friend Beeston, Samuel Long was\r\nsent home a prisoner by the Earl of Carlisle, but they successfully\r\nvindicated the privileges of Jamaica. Edward Long, the historian of\r\nJamaica, was grandson of Charles and Jane Long.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the churchyard no doubt dates from early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, as appears by a further extract from the vestry minutes, under\r\ndate “1706, February”: “Ordered that both these churchyards [the new and\r\nthe old] be walled in.”\r\n\r\nThe vestry minutes are copied from a reference in the “Morning Journal”\r\nof June 18, 1858, contributed by Mr. Livingston.\r\n\r\nThe =Parish Church of St. Andrew=, commonly known as Halfway Tree\r\nchurch, is, after the cathedral at Spanish Town, the most interesting,\r\nfrom an historic point of view, of all the churches in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe vestry lost no time in rebuilding after the earthquake had destroyed\r\nthe first church, for we learn from the vestry minutes, under date July\r\n5, 1692; “Ordered that a new church be forthwith built on the church\r\nland at Halfway Tree of the figure of the late new church, and a house\r\nfor the Minister 50 feet front from out to out, 16 feet wide from in to\r\nin, 9 feet high a brick and half thick.”\r\n\r\nThe building was apparently so far completed as to receive monuments on\r\nits walls by the following March, for that is the date of the one which\r\nrecords the death of Frances, wife of Sir Nicholas Lawes, a successful\r\nplanter, and a wise and beneficent governor in times of great\r\nmisfortune. Lawes himself was buried in the church of the parish, the\r\ninterests of which he did much to further, but his tomb is not now to be\r\nfound. His name still lives in Laws street, Kingston.\r\n\r\nThe following further extracts from the vestry minutes are interesting:\r\n“1697, order for building a Vestry room and hanging the Bell”; “1699,\r\nApril 29, Bargain about a Steeple”; “... December 22, Order for pewing\r\nthe Church.”\r\n\r\nThe church was finally completed in 1700. In 1701 Sir William Beeston\r\nand his wife gave, as we have seen, a site in Kingston for the erection\r\nof a church in that town, and in the year following, namely, on January\r\n13, 1702, the Vestry of St. Andrew ordered “That the benches belonging\r\nto the church be given to Kingston for the use of their church.” On\r\nOctober 25, 1703, it was ordered “that the tyles be taken off the roof\r\nof the church, and that it be covered with shingles instead thereof”;\r\nand in 1705 that the ceiling, &c., be plaistered. Richard Hill is\r\nprobably in error in saying that “the then existing church shattered and\r\nblown down in the hurricane of 1712 and 1722 was succeeded by the\r\npresent edifice,” but one’s later day experience of hurricane and\r\nearthquake have shown that these and the work of “restorers” make sad\r\nhavoc of the historic evidence offered by monumental inscriptions. In\r\n1685 it was decided to order a communion service from England, but the\r\noldest chalice and flagon in the church bear the date 1700, and the\r\nmark, B.O., of John Boddington (who made a communion flagon which is at\r\nNorth Cerney in Gloucestershire).\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1741, the churchwardens were ordered to send to Great Britain\r\nfor a “Pulpit Cloth with Cushions and other necessary ornaments for the\r\nPulpit, Reading Desk, and Communion Table, of crimson, with a plain gold\r\nfringe, and six dozen hassocks.” The edifice was somewhat damaged in the\r\nhurricane of October 20, 1744; and on November 3 following the\r\nchurchwardens were ordered to agree with workmen to put the church\r\nimmediately in repair and secure the windows with substantial shutters\r\non the outside. In 1760 orders were given for the importation of an\r\norgan, and on July 1, 1762, Messrs. Freeman and Dixper were employed to\r\ntake down the old organ and to put up and tune the new one for £80.\r\n\r\nFor many years the church remained, as it was built, a plain\r\nunattractive structure, by men who had the fear of earthquake and\r\nhurricane before them. In 1879–80 extensive restorations were carried\r\nout; the Campbell memorial chancel was added, extensions were made to\r\nthe north and south ends of the transept, and at the west end so as to\r\nconnect nave and tower, and the ceiling was removed.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, in order to provide extra accommodation, a south chancel aisle,\r\ndesigned with deep-mullioned, unglazed window-openings, so as to exclude\r\nsunlight and yet admit fresh air, was added in memory of the late\r\nrector, the Rev. H. H. Isaacs. And in 1909 extensive repairs, involving\r\nthe pulling down of the shattered tower, the space occupied by which was\r\nthrown into the nave, were rendered necessary by the earthquake of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe first rector, James Zellers, was appointed to St. Andrew on June 9,\r\n1664, and since that date the parish has been served by but sixteen\r\nrectors, giving an average of upwards of fifteen years for each\r\nincumbent—not a bad record for a “pestilential climate,” as that of\r\nJamaica was formerly called.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is of interest to note that a recent member of the\r\ncongregation worshipped in the church for upwards of seventy years, for\r\na large part of which time he was verger. Stephen Dale, who was born in\r\nthe parish of Manchester in or about 1806, came to St. Andrew as a slave\r\non Cassia Park, a property near the church, when a young man, and lived\r\nin Halfway Tree till his death. Though pensioned as verger in 1896, he\r\nstill, to the advanced age of 106, in 1912, played his part in\r\ncollecting the offertory at the Sunday services, and performed other\r\nduties in connection with the church. He remembered that he was\r\nthirty-two years of age at the time of Emancipation.\r\n\r\nOf the monuments by far the most interesting from an art point of view\r\nis that formerly on the south wall of the chancel, now on the north wall\r\nof the nave, to =James Lawes=. One of the best pieces of iconic\r\nsculpture in the island, it is by John Cheere (miscalled Sheere by\r\nLawrence-Archer), the brother of Sir Henry Cheere (b. 1703, d. 1781), at\r\nfirst a pupil of Sheemakers, and afterwards employer and instructor of\r\nRoubiliac.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Cheere was the chief of the statuaries of his time, working in\r\nmarble, bronze, and lead to meet the demand for garden decoration. He\r\nexecuted numerous monuments for Westminster Abbey. In 1760 he was chosen\r\nby the County of Middlesex to present a congratulatory address to the\r\nKing on his accession. Knighted on that occasion, he was created a\r\nbaronet six years later. In 1755 he drew up the first proposals for the\r\nformation of the Royal Academy. All we are told of John Cheere is that\r\nhe was “also a statuary and probably a partner in his brother’s works.”\r\n\r\nOf James Lawes almost all there is to tell is stated in Latin on his\r\nhandsome monument. He was baptized in 1697, married in 1720, and was\r\nmember of the house of Assembly for St. Andrew in 1721, and for Vere in\r\n1722. He was called up to the council in 1725. He died in 1733. He had a\r\ndormant commission, but never acted as governor. His widow re-married,\r\nin 1742, William Home, eighth Earl of Home, governor of Gibraltar. His\r\nepitaph, translated, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  In this neighbourhood lie the remains of the Hon. James Lawes: he was\r\n  the first-born son of Sir Nicholas Lawes, the Governor of this island,\r\n  by his wife Susanna Temple: he married Elizabeth, the only daughter\r\n  and heiress of William Gibbon, Esquire: then in early manhood, when\r\n  barely thirty-six years of age, he obtained almost the highest\r\n  position of distinction amongst his countrymen, being appointed\r\n  Lieutenant-Governor by royal warrant; but before he entered on his\r\n  duties, in the prime of life—alas!—he died on the 29th day of\r\n  December, A.D. 1733.\r\n\r\n  In him we lose an upright and honoured citizen, a faithful and\r\n  industrious friend, a most affectionate husband, a man who was just\r\n  and kind to all, and distinguished by the lustre of genuine religion.\r\n  His wife who survived him had this tomb erected to perpetuate the\r\n  memory of a beloved husband.\r\n\r\nHis arms are painted on the monument: “Or, on a chief azure, three\r\nestoiles of eight points or. On an escutcheon of pretence, or, a lion\r\nrampant sable debruised of a bend gules charged with three escallops,\r\nor.”\r\n\r\nHe was probably born at Temple Hall, where his father, governor of the\r\ncolony from 1718 till 1722, introduced towards the close of his life, in\r\n1728, the coffee plant into the island. His mother was a daughter of\r\nThomas Temple, of Francton, Warwickshire, and Temple Hall, in St.\r\nAndrew, sister of “La Belle Temple,” of de Grammont (wife of Sir Charles\r\nLyttelton, governor of Jamaica), and widow of Samuel Bernard, speaker of\r\nthe Assembly. She was the fourth of Sir Nicholas Lawes’s five wives, all\r\nwidows when he married them.\r\n\r\nOther interesting monuments in the church are those to Zachary Bayly,\r\nuncle and patron of Bryan Edwards, the historian, who wrote his flowery\r\nepitaph typical of the time; to Admiral Davers, who was one of the\r\nprincipal actors in the quarrel between Sir Chaloner Ogle and the\r\ngovernor, Trelawny, an echo of the jealousy of Wentworth and Vernon,\r\nwhich was a factor in their deplorable failure at Cartagena; and to\r\nGeneral Villettes (by Sir Richard Westmacott), commander of the forces\r\nand lieutenant-governor, to whom there is a mural tablet in Westminster\r\nAbbey; and in the churchyard is the monument of Christopher Lipscomb,\r\nfirst bishop of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe earliest dated tomb is that to Edward Harrison, of the year 1695.\r\nThe latest monuments of importance erected in the church are those in\r\nmemory of Sir James Fergusson, who was killed in Kingston by the\r\nearthquake of 1907, and lies buried in the churchyard; and a brass\r\ntablet to the memory of Sir Anthony Musgrave, a former governor.\r\n\r\nThe number of naval men buried here is somewhat remarkable for an inland\r\nchurch: Admiral Davers (d. 1746), Dr. Charles Mackglashan, R.N. (d.\r\n1834), Commodores Pring (d. 1846), Peter McQuhae (d. 1853) and Cracroft\r\n(d. 1865), Admiral Holmes (d. 1761), Captains Renton (d. 1747–8),\r\nShortland (d. 1827) and Morrish (d. 1861).\r\n\r\nAmongst military men are General William Anne Villettes (d. 1808),\r\nLieut.-Col. Augustus Frederick Ellis (d. 1841), Lieut.-Col. Charles\r\nMarkham (d. 1842), and Major-General Lambert (d. 1848).\r\n\r\nThe old chandelier, at the west end, dating from the year 1706, the gift\r\nof Nicholas Lawes, is a good example of English brass work of that\r\nperiod. The copy of the royal arms, also at the west end, dates from the\r\ntime of Queen Anne, as the initials A. R. testify. The tattered flags of\r\nthe 3rd West India Regiment told of a time when there were more\r\nbattalions than there are now. Laid up on the disbandment of the\r\nregiment in 1870, they were on July 31, 1912, removed from the church to\r\nthe recently erected garrison chapel at Up-Park Camp.\r\n\r\nThe registers contain many records of interest. In the early years occur\r\nthe well-known names of Brayne, Beeston, Barry, Elletson and Lawes.\r\n\r\nBetween 1671 and 1691 Colonel Samuel Barry had four children baptized;\r\nColonel William Beeston, five; and Roger Elletson (who married Anne Hope\r\non May 6, 1680), six.\r\n\r\nThe Robert Beckford who, on June 6, 1688, married Anne Prenyard, must\r\nhave been a member of the well-known family, possibly a brother of\r\nColonel Peter Beckford, the president of the council.\r\n\r\nAmongst the baptisms are recorded those of Robert Charles Dallas, the\r\nauthor of “The History of the Maroons,” on Christmas day, 1756; of\r\nWilliam, son of Lieut.-Col. John Dalling, afterwards governor of the\r\nisland, in 1771; and of Marie Antoinette, daughter of Maria Despouches\r\nand Sir Hyde Parker, vice-admiral of the red, in 1797.\r\n\r\nSlaves were often baptized _en bloc_. In 1780 four negroes “the property\r\nof the Dutchess of Chandos” were baptized on February 8. On May 5, 1790,\r\nfive slaves, the property of Simon Taylor, the wealthiest man of his\r\ntime, were baptized; and on September 9, 1803, eighteen slaves on Mona\r\nestate; and on July 15, 1815, twenty-nine male adults, twenty-seven\r\nfemale adults, eight male and nine female children slaves were baptized\r\non Fair Hill plantation.\r\n\r\nThe good people of Kingston not infrequently came to St. Andrew to be\r\nmarried, _e.g._, on September 12, 1792, Robert Hibbert, Esq., Jun., of\r\nthe parish of Kingston, married Elizabeth Jane Nembhard, of the same\r\nparish. Another interesting marriage that took place in St. Andrew was\r\nthat of Philip Livingston of Kingston, merchant (the eldest son of\r\nPhilip Livingston, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence\r\nof the United States in 1776), to Sarah Johnson, of the parish of St.\r\nAndrew, on June 29, 1768. Apparently, also, sometimes burial services\r\nwere conducted in St. Andrew prior to entombment elsewhere. Under date\r\nNovember 5, 1702, is recorded the death of “Admiral John Bembo,” whose\r\ntombstone is in Kingston parish church. He had died at Port Royal on\r\nNovember 4. There is an old tradition that Benbow was buried at\r\nGreenwich, then a naval station on the harbour to the west of Kingston.\r\nThis would be compatible with the entry in the Halfway Tree register, as\r\nGreenwich was and is in the parish of St. Andrew; but James Knight, who\r\nwas member for Kingston in 1722 and following years, says, in a\r\nmanuscript history of Jamaica in the British Museum, “He was buried the\r\nday following [his death] in the church at Kingston, greatly lamented by\r\nall ranks of people.” It is strange, therefore, that his burial should\r\nbe recorded in the register of St. Andrew. It may be that when two\r\nrectors took part in the burial service each recorded it.\r\n\r\nAmongst other interesting items in the burials we read: “1772, Nov. 6,\r\nMrs. Clies, mother-in-law to Sir George Bridges Rodney, Bart.” She was\r\nthe mother of Rodney’s second wife, Henrietta. Her husband was John\r\nClies, of Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of the rectors of the parish:\r\n\r\n July    1664 to 25th May   1700 Rev. James Zellers\r\n         1700 to 5th July   1710 Rev. John Moodie\r\n         1710 to 22nd Oct.  1714 Rev. George Wright\r\n         1714 to 25th March 1738 Rev. John Carey\r\n         1738 to 26th April 1747 Rev. Alexander Inglis\r\n         1747 to 25th Oct.  1760 Rev. George Eccles\r\n         1760 to 13th April 1768 Rev. Gideon Castelfranc\r\n         1768 to            1782 Rev. John Pool, LL.B.\r\n         1782 to May        1813 Rev. John Campbell\r\n         1813 to 8th Dec.   1858 Rev. Alexander Campbell, M.A.\r\n         1858 to            1860 Ven. Archdeacon Richard Panton, D.D.\r\n January 1861 to            1870 Rev. William Mayhew, M.A.\r\n October 1870 to August     1872 Rev. George Taylor Braine, B.A.\r\n August  1872 to Oct.       1878 Ven. Archdeacon Duncan Houston\r\n                                   Campbell, M.A.\r\n March   1879 to 22nd Sept. 1900 Rev. Hubert Headland Isaacs M.A.\r\n January 1901                    Rev. Edward Jocelyn Wortley\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KING EDWARD’S CLOCK TOWER\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmongst interesting houses are =Lundie’s Pen=, Halfway Tree, a typical\r\neighteenth-century Jamaica house, but altered after the earthquake of\r\n1907—it bears date September 3, 1767. =King’s House=, which was formerly\r\nthe residence of the Bishop of Jamaica, was purchased for £5000 as an\r\nofficial residence of the governor, on the removal of the seat of\r\ngovernment to Kingston in 1872. A dining-hall and ballroom were added\r\nlater. It was wrecked by the earthquake of 1907, and was rebuilt in 1909\r\nfrom designs by Sir Charles Nicholson. In it are two full-length\r\nportraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds of George III and Queen Charlotte,\r\ncopies of the portraits which were painted in 1779 and for which\r\nReynolds received £420. Reynolds made it a condition of his acceptance\r\nof the presidentship of the Royal Academy that he should be allowed to\r\npaint portraits of the king and queen. The portraits were presented to\r\nthe Royal Academy by the king. Thirteen pairs of copies were painted.\r\nCopies are in the possession of the Earl of Malmesbury at Heron Court;\r\nat the Viceregal Lodge, Dublin; at Hatfield House; at Cobham Hall; at\r\nKnole; the Senior United Service Club, London; and the Cutlers’ Company;\r\nand the pair mentioned above at Jamaica. The king is seated in his\r\nrobes, with the sceptre in his right hand; in the background are a\r\ncanopy and the aisles of Westminster Abbey. The queen is seated on a\r\nthrone, with a sceptre on a cushion in front. She is clad in a\r\ngold-embroidered dress, with lace sleeves, and ermine train and robe.\r\n\r\nAt Halfway is =King Edward’s Clock Tower=, erected as a memorial by\r\npublic subscription in 1913.\r\n\r\nThe =Stony Hill Barracks= (dating from 1799) are now used as an\r\nIndustrial School. In 1844 they were unoccupied, and the Assembly\r\nsuggested that they should form a lodging for the convicts which, it was\r\nproposed, should tunnel Stony Hill. Amongst the tombs is one to the\r\nmemory of an officer of the York Chasseurs who fell in a duel in 1818.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of the eighteenth century the Jamaica naval\r\nstation was one of very great importance to the British Empire. The\r\nNorth American (with which it was later united) was then considered a\r\nfine station for making prize-money, but the West Indies was, to use\r\nNelson’s own words, “the station for honour.” Earlier in the century,\r\nhowever, riches had been added to honour for those who held command at\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the naval station at Port Royal (where the commodore on\r\nthe station till recently resided at Admiralty house), there were for\r\nmany years to the west of Kingston a dockyard at Greenwich (with a depot\r\nfor military stores, and a hospital, as well as a cemetery attached)\r\nwhich was the point of embarkation for the naval authorities; and a pen\r\nresidence for the commander-in-chief near Kingston, known as =Admiral’s\r\nPen=. At times the admiral on the station had a house in the hills, and\r\nthere was at one period a naval convalescent hospital (now called The\r\nCottage) in the St. Andrew mountains.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of a suggestion for a permanent residence for the\r\nadmiral on the station is to be found in the will of Zachary Bayly (the\r\nuncle of Bryan Edwards the historian) who offered Greenwich Park,\r\nsituated between Admiral’s Pen and Greenwich, near Kingston, to the\r\ngovernment “for the use and residence of a Governor, or of the\r\nCommander-in-chief for the time being, of His Majesty’s ships of war\r\nemployed or kept upon this station,” at a reduction of £1000 sterling on\r\na just valuation. This offer, which Bryan Edwards, as executor, made to\r\nthe House of Assembly in 1770, was not accepted.\r\n\r\nBut in 1773 the House resolved “that a sum not exceeding £2500\r\n(currency) be laid out in purchasing the house and pen in the parish of\r\nSt. Andrew, where Sir William Burnaby, Admiral Keppel, and Admiral Parry\r\nformerly lived, to be annexed to the Government for the use of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of his Majesty’s ships of war on this station.”\r\n\r\nAdmiral’s Pen was bought on January 13, 1774, by Jasper Hall, _et al._,\r\ncommissioners for purchasing a pen for the admiral on the station, from\r\nJohn Dalling, _et ux._, for the sum of £2500 (currency). This was\r\nLieut.-Colonel Dalling, who was then lieutenant-governor. Its purchase\r\nwas no doubt due to Rodney, who was then the admiral on the station. As\r\nhe left, however, in that year, Gayton, commodore at Jamaica in 1776–78,\r\nwas probably the first admiral to inhabit it as an official residence.\r\nGayton was followed by, amongst others, Sir Peter Parker, Joshua Rowley,\r\nGardner, Affleck, Sir Hyde Parker, Lord Hugh Seymour, Sir J. T.\r\nDuckworth, Dacres, Cochrane, Douglas and Popham. In November 1829\r\nAdmiral Fleeming reported that Admiral’s Pen was “ruinous and\r\nuninhabitable.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ADMIRAL’S PEN\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 1863, Thomas Cushnie, for the Executive Committee of the\r\nGovernment, bought it for £600 (sterling). It is now used as a Union\r\nPoorhouse for Kingston and St. Andrew. Its whitewashed walls and stones\r\nalong the drive recall the coastguard stations of England, and keep\r\nalive the memory of its connection with the navy of Great Britain at a\r\nperiod of some of its brightest achievements.\r\n\r\nTo Admiral’s Pen in 1780 Nelson was brought, after a short sojourn at\r\nPort Royal, on his return from the San Juan expedition, and, weak from\r\nfever and dysentery, was tenderly nursed by Lady Parker and her\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Yates, while even the admiral himself took his turn in\r\nsitting up with the patient. We are told that Nelson’s aversion from\r\ntaking medicine was so great that they had to send it to him by the hand\r\nof the admiral’s youngest daughter. On June 11 Nelson went up to the\r\nadmiral’s hill residence, or “Admiral’s Mountain,” as he calls it in a\r\nletter to his friend Hercules Ross.\r\n\r\nLady Nugent, in her “Journal of a Voyage to and Residence in the Island\r\nof Jamaica,” refers to the Admiral’s Pen more than once. On September\r\n13, 1804, when Sir John Thomas Duckworth was admiral, she writes:\r\n\r\n  Breakfast at 8, as usual. Have at 11 a second breakfast of fruit,\r\n  wine, cake, etc., and at 12 all set off for the Admiral’s Penn; Lady\r\n  M[argaret Cameron, wife of the Governor of the Bahamas], her young\r\n  people, and myself, in the sociable, with our two black postillions in\r\n  scarlet liveries, but with black ancles peeping out of their\r\n  particulars, and altogether rather a novel sort of appearance, to\r\n  Europeans just arrived. General N. and Mr. Cameron in the curricle.\r\n  Aides-de-camp, servants, etc., in kittareens, and on horseback; and\r\n  all arrived in grand procession at the Admiral’s at about 3.\r\n  Refreshments were ready, and then we all creolized till 5 o’clock. A\r\n  large party, of the Navy chiefly, at dinner. Cards; and to bed soon\r\n  after ten.\r\n\r\nThe banquets and other ceremonies that have taken place within the walls\r\nof Admiral’s Pen must have been excelled in splendour only by those of\r\nKing’s House, Spanish Town, in its palmiest days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROCK FORT\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Long before Kingston had been settled as a town,” says the late Mr. G.\r\nF. Judah in his “Rock Fort, Fort Castile, Fort Nugent” (Kingston, 1906),\r\n“Rock Fort, with its surroundings then lying in both the old parishes of\r\nPort Royal and St. Andrew, had acquired a name and reputation of its\r\nown.”\r\n\r\nThough not one of the earliest spots to be defended in Jamaica under\r\nBritish rule, =Rock Fort=, at Harbour Head (not to be confounded with\r\nRocky Fort on the Palisadoes), which commands the approach to Kingston\r\nfrom the east, or windward as it was commonly called in the days of\r\nsailing-ships, came into importance before the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It was first fortified as a protection against the threatened\r\nFrench invasion from San Domingo, under Du Casse in 1694; and enlarged\r\nand strengthened from time to time. It was manned in 1865, when it was\r\nfeared that the rising in St. Thomas would spread to Kingston. Near Rock\r\nFort is the site of a =Naval Watering Place=, established by Admiral\r\nVernon in 1739–42, where Rodney later added a conduit, still to be seen,\r\nfor the conveyance of fresh water from the spring to the shore. Sir\r\nJames Castile, a native of Barcelona but a naturalised Englishman, who\r\nhad come to Jamaica as agent for the Assiento Company of Spain, which\r\nhad the exclusive right to import slaves and other objects from Africa\r\nto the Spanish West Indies, and to which was joined the Royal African\r\nCompany of England, received his letters of naturalisation in March,\r\n1684–85; and in the July following he acquired land in Port Royal, where\r\nhe established offices for his company, which he could not have done had\r\nhe been an alien. In 1690 he purchased 300 acres of land in the old\r\nparish of Port Royal (now St. Andrew), near Harbour Head, and in the\r\nfollowing year he acquired one hundred more in St. Andrew near by. In\r\nSeptember 1693 letters patent were issued by the governor, Sir William\r\nBeeston, authorising Castile “to enclose his dwelling house at Three\r\nRivers in the Parish of St. Andrews, with imbattled walls for the\r\nsecurity and defence of his said house and plantation and negroes and\r\nthe parts adjacent, against their Majesty’s Enemys”; and thus arose Fort\r\nCastile, about a mile and a quarter beyond Rock Fort. In the June\r\nfollowing, under fear of French invasion, with the defences of Port\r\nRoyal ruined by the recent earthquake, Colonel Lawes “drew lines and\r\nsecured a narrow pass to the eastward of Kingston,” and this became Rock\r\nPort, and Du Casse was led to make his attack to the west of St. Jago de\r\nla Vega at Carlisle Bay. Sir James assisted not only at Rock Fort, but\r\nalso at his own dwelling; “having garrisoned and provided his house,\r\nwhich was well walled and guarded for a defence, they built a regular\r\nfort on the parade.”\r\n\r\nIn 1702 Castile petitioned the House of Assembly in respect to the great\r\ncharge he had been put to in building Fort Castile, and the House voted\r\nhim £500 in compensation. He died in 1709, and in 1711 his widow\r\npetitioned for consideration in view of the fact that for five years the\r\nfort was occupied by her Majesty’s forces, “during which time it ran\r\ngreatly to ruin.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time nothing is recorded of Rock Fort till 1753, when £300 was\r\nvoted for its defence (£7000 being voted for Mosquito Point, afterwards\r\ncalled Fort Augusta); and thence onwards it is frequently reported on by\r\nthe various committees appointed from time to time to report to the\r\nAssembly on the state of the fortifications and barracks of the island;\r\nand in 1755 £5000 was voted to be expended on Rock Fort. The following\r\naccount of it is given by Long:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FORT NUGENT IN 1908\r\n]\r\n\r\n  It consists of two bastions, mounting twenty-one guns (twenty-four\r\n  pounders), and furnished with a small powder-magazine, and other\r\n  habiliments of war necessary for its defence. Upon the face of the\r\n  hill is a little battery of six guns, with traversed lines that lead\r\n  up to it. Outside the walls is a wet ditch, sunk lower than the\r\n  surface of the water in the harbour; so that it may be occasionally\r\n  filled. The fort is provided also with a drawbridge towards the\r\n  Eastern road; casemates for lodging the men; and a house for the\r\n  officers. It is too small to admit a garrison of more than seventy\r\n  men: nevertheless, governor Kn[o]l[e]s was so confident of its\r\n  strength, that he maintained that it was capable of standing a siege\r\n  against ten thousand. It defends the access towards the town from the\r\n  Eastward, and would undoubtedly prove a great security against an\r\n  attack from that quarter; for the only way leading to it is narrow,\r\n  and confined a considerable length in a straight direction, exposed to\r\n  the whole fire of the fort, without a possibility of annoying it: nor\r\n  could trenches be formed, to carry on a regular approach, as the road\r\n  is all the way a shallow sand close by the water’s edge. A guard of\r\n  soldiers is always kept here; but the fort is said to be very\r\n  unhealthy to the men and their officers. The cause of this has by some\r\n  been imputed to their drinking from a brackish stream which runs near\r\n  it. Others ascribe it to the extreme heat reverberated down upon them\r\n  from the hill, which rises like a wall above the fort. And some have\r\n  thought it proceeded from a lagoon, which lies near the mouth of\r\n  Mammee River, about three miles to the Eastward. To corroborate the\r\n  latter opinion, is alleged the instance, mentioned by Lind, of\r\n  Whydaw-castle, on the coast of Africa; which has been rendered more\r\n  unhealthy than the Negroe-town in its neighbourhood by a flight of\r\n  circumstance unattended to at first. It is built on a small spot of\r\n  ground, which the sea breezes cannot reach without passing over a\r\n  little, inconsiderable brook of water, which produces some aquatic\r\n  plants always covered with a putrid slime. It is certain, from\r\n  constant experience, that places adjacent to a foul shore, or stagnant\r\n  waters, near the coast in the West Indies, are invariably unhealthful.\r\n  But, whatever be the cause, it deserves a minute enquiry of gentlemen\r\n  of the faculty, in order to its discovery; to the end that, if it\r\n  arises from some local evil, that cannot be remedied, the men might be\r\n  lodged at night in convenient huts, erected for them upon the\r\n  hill-side; by which means all of them, except those on immediate duty\r\n  in the fort, might enjoy a purer air, especially in those hours when a\r\n  depraved air is found to be most pernicious; for this is a post of so\r\n  much importance to the Town, that the men stationed here ought neither\r\n  to be disheartened by apprehensions, nor disabled by sickness, from\r\n  doing their regular duty. The assembly having lately granted 1500l.\r\n  for erecting barracks at this fort to contain two hundred men; if the\r\n  situation be properly attended to, the result will shew, whether the\r\n  unhealthiness of the garrison has been owing to a pestilent quality in\r\n  the air, or some other cause.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to read Long’s reference to the lagoon, having in view\r\nthe unpleasant experiences which Kingston has had in recent years from\r\nthe smell of the Yallahs ponds from time to time, notably in 1906.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 fear of French invasion was very real in Jamaica, martial law\r\nwas proclaimed, and in December (before the news of Trafalgar reached\r\nthe island) a law was passed for purchasing Castile Fort and certain\r\nlands (118 acres) surrounding it, for completing the works of that Fort,\r\nand for putting the same on the Island establishment under the name of\r\n=Fort Nugent=, in honour of Lieutenant-General George Nugent, then\r\nlieutenant-governor. The martello tower hard by must have been built\r\nabout the same time. In 1865, owing to fear of a descent on Kingston by\r\nthe rioters of Morant Bay, the fort was manned by volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe view of the old guns lying about in picturesque confusion, shown in\r\nthe sketch (on the previous page) copied from a photograph taken in\r\n1908, no longer exists, as the fort has since been reconstructed.\r\n\r\nWhen the lands on the plain of Liguanea were divided amongst themselves\r\nby Cromwell’s army of occupation, that part on which the =Constant\r\nSpring= estate stands fell to the lot of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry\r\nArchbould, a member of the first Council nominated in 1661. He married\r\nin 1668 (he was her third husband and she was his second wife) the\r\nmother of Sir Nicholas Lawes (afterwards governor of the colony), but\r\ndied in the following year, she surviving him twenty years. His son,\r\nColonel Henry Archbould, who had sat for St. George from 1680 to 1688,\r\nwas elected member of the Assembly for St. Andrew in 1701–2. His wife,\r\nJoanna Wilhelmina, was sister to the wife and cousin of Sir Henry Morgan\r\n(buccaneer and governor of Jamaica) and sister to the wife of Colonel\r\nRobert Byndlos, chief justice. She obtained a patent of naturalisation\r\nin August 1685. The second Colonel Archbould died in 1709, and was\r\nburied in Halfway-Tree church. The first Colonel Archbould’s second son,\r\nMajor William Archbould, was member for St. Andrew in 1688. James\r\nArchbould, the son of his second wife, was member for St. Andrew in\r\n1702–4, but sat for St. David in 1713.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 a private Act was passed (we read in Feurtado’s “Official and\r\nother Personages of Jamaica,” 1896) for the sale of certain lands in\r\nLiguanea belonging to Henry Archbould, late of the said parish,\r\ndeceased, for payment of £8000 with interest, devised by the will of the\r\nsaid Henry Archbould, to his daughter, Sarah Elizabeth Archbould, and\r\nfor other purposes.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Constant Spring estate with some mountain land adjoining, called\r\nSnow Hill, was (the writer was informed by Mr. G. F. Judah) sold by\r\nHenry Archbould to Daniel Moore, who had in the previous year\r\nprovisionally leased the property. Daniel Moore, member of the Assembly\r\nfor St. Andrew from 1768 to 1781, who had done a thriving trade in\r\nprizes and prize money in those privateering days, and was latterly\r\njoined in business by Jasper Farmer, died in 1783–4, and his properties\r\nformed part of his residuary estate. After his death there was a suit in\r\nChancery, “Maitland _vs._ Moore _et al_,” and in 1785 Constant Spring\r\nand Snow Hill, with its slaves and other effects, were sold under a\r\ndecree of the Court at Riley’s tavern in Kingston for £33,000 current\r\nmoney of the Island. It became afterwards the property of George\r\nCuthbert (who administered the government of Jamaica in 1832), who\r\nmortgaged it for £77,000 to Alexandre Lindo, a retired merchant; the\r\nlatter sold the mortgage debt in 1810 to his son, Abraham Alexandre\r\nLindo, the proprietor of Kingston Pen.\r\n\r\nIt was during the ownership of Daniel Moore in 1770 that an Act was\r\npassed empowering him to bring, by means of a tunnel through the\r\nmountain range and an aqueduct, the water of the Wag Water (the Agua\r\nAlta of the Spaniards) to his estate, which means now serve in part to\r\nsupply the town of Kingston with water. It was entitled “An Act to\r\nenable Daniel Moore, Esquire, to take up a sufficient quantity of water\r\nfor turning mills for grinding sugar-canes, out of or from Agua Alta\r\nRiver, commonly called Wag Water River, in the parish of St. Andrew; and\r\nto convey the same to his works on the plantation in the said parish,\r\ncalled Constant Spring.”\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the original brick-lined tunnel, which is about half a mile in\r\nextent, was straightened in parts, and converted into a concrete pipe of\r\nsix feet diameter. The proposal to supply Kingston with water from the\r\nWag Water was first made, it is interesting to note, as early as 1798.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 there were on the estate 401 slaves and 22 head of stock.\r\n\r\nAs the result of legal proceedings of a protracted character the estate\r\nabout 1832 became the property of Mrs. Jasper Farmer Cargill (_née_ Jane\r\nMarston), when there were 312 slaves and 31 head of stock; the only\r\nestate in the lowland district of St. Andrew with more slaves being\r\nHope.\r\n\r\nIt later passed into the hands of Chrystie and Porteous, merchants of\r\nKingston, the memory of this ownership still living in the title\r\nPorteous’s Pen, applied to a lower and now distinct part of the\r\nproperty. In the ‘seventies it was owned by a Captain Carson, a son of a\r\nmember of the above-named firm.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1888 the American Hotels company was formed in Jamaica,\r\nprincipally with Jamaica capital, and properties were acquired and two\r\nor three hotels were started, Constant Spring amongst the number. When\r\nthe Jamaica Exhibition of 1891 was in preparation, the Government,\r\nthinking there was not enough hotel accommodation, passed the Hotels\r\nCompanies law, and the directors of the Constant Spring hotel, as it was\r\nnot paying as well as was anticipated, mortgaged it to the Government,\r\nto whom they subsequently handed it over. Golf links and tennis courts\r\nnow usurp the place of cane-fields. The hotel since that date afforded a\r\npleasant temporary home for numberless visitors to the island.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the nineteenth century Constant Spring estate was\r\nthe place selected for his experiments in the improvement of the\r\nmanufacture of sugar and rum by Dr. Bryan Higgins (miscalled “Wiggins”\r\nin Gardner’s “History of Jamaica”), the celebrated physician and\r\nchemist, who came to Jamaica in 1797 at the instance of the West India\r\nCommittee (as related in the issue of the “Circular” for November 6,\r\n1906).\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1801, the House of Assembly resolved, “That a Committee be\r\nappointed to visit Constant Spring estate in Liguanea, on Monday, the\r\n9th instant, to inspect what improvements Dr. Higgins has effected there\r\nin the manufacture of sugar and rum, and to report their opinion thereon\r\nto the House.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RAYMOND HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of that month the Committee made a lengthy report, in which\r\nit stated that:\r\n\r\n“As Doctor Higgins has exemplified practically what theoretically he has\r\ndetailed in print, the Committee deem it unnecessary to lay before the\r\nHouse in their report a more particular account of what they have seen\r\nand so satisfactorily approve.\r\n\r\n“That the Committee lament that they have to state to the House that the\r\ninfirm state of Doctor Higgins’s health obliges him to return to England\r\nthis year; his assiduous and indefatigable exertions, both of body and\r\nmind, in the public service ever since his arrival, of which every\r\ngentleman with whom he has by turns resided is a witness, have been too\r\nmuch for his weak frame and advanced years, and render the change of\r\nclimate necessary.”\r\n\r\n“The observations and Advices for the Improvement of Muscavado Sugar and\r\nRum by Bryan Higgins, M.D.,” was published in the “Columbian Magazine”\r\nin Kingston in 1798.\r\n\r\nConstant Spring forms part of the scene of a tale by Captain\r\nBrooke-Knight, entitled “The Captain’s Story, or Adventures in Jamaica\r\nThirty Years Ago,” which appeared in the “Leisure Hour,” illustrated by\r\n(Sir) John Gilbert, in 1859–60, and was afterwards published in book\r\nform with the same illustrations about 1880, under the title “The\r\nCaptain’s Story, or Jamaica Sixty Years Since.” At the time of the story\r\n(1832) Constant Spring, which is in it called “Running Water,” was, as\r\nis mentioned above, the property of Mrs. Cargill; and Judge Jasper\r\nFarmer Cargill figures in the work as Mr. Jasper. The author, Captain\r\nBrooke-Knight, who appears as Lieutenant Brook, married Miss Marston.\r\n\r\nThe original Constant Spring works stood to the east of the new main\r\nroad to Stony Hill, about seven miles from Kingston, just below the\r\naqueduct. They were later removed to the other side of the road lower\r\ndown the hill, near the end of the car line, where they still stand in\r\nruins; and traces of the stone guttering connecting the old works with\r\nthe new may still be seen on the east side of the main road. The late\r\nDr. Cargill stated (in an article on “The Captain’s Story” which\r\nappeared in the “Journal of the Institute of Jamaica” in 1896) that the\r\ngreat house stood a little below the aqueduct. Mr. Soutar, however, says\r\nthat the house at Spring Garden was the original great house. The\r\nremains of a substantial though short flight of stone steps (marking,\r\nMr. Soutar says, the old still-house) exist to-day just above the\r\nreservoirs, commanding one of the finest views to be obtained on the\r\nhigher slopes of the plain of Liguanea. These old aqueducts, which\r\nenhance the beauty of many a Jamaica landscape, besides telling of the\r\nday when sugar was king, afford the best examples of architecture to be\r\nfound in the island.\r\n\r\nIt was at Constant Spring hotel in 1894 that “Alice Spinner” wrote a\r\n“Study in Colour,” one of the best pictures of negro character sketched\r\nby an English pen; and the hotel figures in the story as Summerlands\r\nHotel, where “no ill-cooked stew or muddy coffee could rob the glorious\r\nmountains of their jewelled peak.”\r\n\r\n=Olivier Road=, near Constant Spring, helps to record the fact that Sir\r\nSydney Olivier, when colonial secretary, lived near by. It is the only\r\npublicly-given name after a colonial secretary.\r\n\r\nAlthough of late, writers, misled by Anthony Trollope’s doubting\r\nreference to the story, and by a misreading of Froude’s words, have\r\nattempted to prove that “Tom Cringle’s Log,” a work which brought\r\nliterary fame to Michael Scott at a bound, was probably written in\r\nGlasgow in the intervals of business, and although it is possible he may\r\nhave rewritten in that city the chapters to suit the pages of\r\n“Blackwood,” there seems very good evidence still obtainable that the\r\noriginal studies of Jamaica life and character, which have delighted\r\nthree or four generations of readers, were actually written in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nMichael Scott, who was born at Cowlairs, on the outskirts of Glasgow, on\r\nOctober 30, 1789, was the son of Allan Scott, a Glasgow merchant and\r\nowner of a small estate at Cowlairs. After being educated at the high\r\nschool and the university of Glasgow, he came in 1806 to Jamaica to\r\nmanage several estates. Four years later he entered in Kingston a\r\nbusiness the nature of which compelled him to travel frequently both by\r\nsea and road. He visited the neighbouring islands, especially Cuba and\r\nthe Spanish Main, and the experiences of tropical scenery and nautical\r\nlife thus gained formed the basis of his “Log.” In 1817 he returned to\r\nScotland, and in the following year he married Margaret, daughter of\r\nRobert Bogle, of Gilmore Hill, a merchant in Glasgow. He returned to\r\nJamaica immediately afterwards, but left the island finally in 1822,\r\nand, settling in Glasgow, became a partner in his father-in-law’s firm,\r\nBogle, Harris and Co., of Glasgow, and Bogle, Douglas and Co., of\r\nMaracaybo. He died in Glasgow on November 7, 1835. It was in 1829, we\r\nlearn from Mowbray Morris’s introduction to the edition of 1895, that\r\nthe “Log” began to make its appearance in “Blackwood’s Magazine” as a\r\ndisconnected series of sketches, published intermittently as the author\r\nsupplied them, or as the editor found it convenient to print them.\r\nBlackwood, while keenly alive to their value, was urgent, we are told,\r\nwith the author to give these sketches some connecting link, which,\r\nwithout binding him to the strict rules of narrative composition, would\r\nadd a strain of personal and continuous interest to the movement of the\r\nstory. The young midshipman accordingly began to cut a more conspicuous\r\nfigure; and in July 1832 the title of “Tom Cringle’s Log” was prefixed\r\nto what is now the eighth but was then called the eleventh chapter.\r\nHenceforward the “Log” proceeded regularly each month, with but one\r\nintermission, to its conclusion in August 1833; and in that year it\r\nappeared in volume form in Philadelphia, in what was probably an\r\nunauthorised edition. Mowbray Morris gives 1834 as the year of its first\r\nappearance as a book; the “Dictionary of National Biography” says 1836;\r\nAllibone gives 1833. Both the “Log” and its successor, “The Cruise of\r\nthe Midge,” were highly praised at the time, and Coleridge, in his\r\n“Table Talk,” called them “most excellent.” Scott so successfully\r\nconcealed his identity that he was dead before his authorship of “Tom\r\nCringle” was known. It was attributed to Captain Chamier, to Captain\r\nMarryat, and to Professor Wilson, to whom it was ascribed in a German\r\nedition published at Brunswick in 1839. From internal evidence it is\r\nclear that the events in this story synchronise, if they are not\r\nidentical, with Scott’s own travels.\r\n\r\nAnthony Trollope, who visited Jamaica in 1859, tells us, in his “West\r\nIndies and the Spanish Main,” that “Nothing can be grander, either in\r\ncolour or grouping, than the ravines of the Blue Mountain ranges of\r\nhills. Perhaps the finest view in the island is from Raymond Lodge\r\n[_sic_], a house high up among the mountains, in which, so local rumour\r\nsays, ‘Tom Cringle’s Log’ was written.” Trollope misrepresented the case\r\nand misled later writers when he used the expression “so local rumour\r\nsays,” for he heard the story from the then owner of Raymond Hall,\r\nCaptain Hinton East, as Captain East’s daughter, the late Mrs.\r\nMarescaux, one of the two ladies whom Trollope mentions as accompanying\r\nhim on his ride to Newcastle, well remembered, and told the present\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nMowbray Morris says that “the tradition seems to have died away before\r\nFroude’s visit,” but the reason why the historian did not mention it is\r\nprobably because he never heard it. =Raymond Hall= is the great house on\r\nMaryland coffee estate. Situated in the Blue Mountains at an altitude of\r\nabout 3000 feet, some eleven miles from Kingston, it has been in the\r\npossession of the East family for upwards of 200 years. When Scott was\r\nhere it was in the possession of Sir Edward Hyde East. In the returns of\r\nproperties given in the “Jamaica Almanac” for 1840, Maryland is recorded\r\nas being 1265 acres in extent. In 1845 it had increased to 1700.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton, the original Aaron Bang in the “Log,” was, at the time\r\nwhen Michael Scott was in Jamaica, planting-attorney to Sir Edward Hyde\r\nEast for Maryland; he resided at times at Kingston, at Raymond Hall, and\r\nin St. Thomas-in-the-Vale. At all three places his friend Scott was wont\r\nto stay with him. Hamilton was known among his friends as (Aaron) Bang\r\nfrom his fondness for practising with firearms, and until the hurricane\r\nof 1886 there stood in front of Raymond Hall a cabbage palm, the stem of\r\nwhich was riddled with shot, it is said, from Hamilton’s gun. Under this\r\ntree Scott wrote his studies of Jamaica life and scenery. So Captain\r\nEast, who came out in 1836, only fourteen years after Scott had left,\r\nwas informed.\r\n\r\nAn orange tree under which Scott, as he relates in his “Log,” made love\r\nto his cousin Maria, stood till quite recently at the back of the house.\r\nMrs. Marescaux remembered the old estate carpenter, Stackpole by name,\r\nwho was wont to show where Scott wrote, and where Hamilton fired at the\r\ncabbage palm from an old sofa which the writer saw resting in the same\r\ncorner at Raymond Hall. The house was much shaken by the earthquake of\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nThe following is Scott’s description of the house and its view:\r\n\r\n  “The beautiful cottage where we were sojourning was situated about\r\n  3000 feet above the level of the sea, and half-way up the great prong\r\n  of the Blue Mountains, known by the name of the Liguanea range, which\r\n  rises behind and overhangs the city of Kingston.... Immediately under\r\n  foot rose several lower ranges of mountains—those nearest us, covered\r\n  with laurel-looking coffee-bushes, interspersed with negro villages\r\n  hanging among the fruit trees like clusters of birds’ nests on the\r\n  hill-side, with a bright green patch of plantain suckers here and\r\n  there, and a white-painted overseer’s house peeping from out the wood,\r\n  and herds of cattle in the guinea-grass pieces. Beyond these stretched\r\n  out the lovely plain of Liguanea covered with luxuriant cane-pieces,\r\n  and groups of negro houses, and guinea-grass pastures of even a deeper\r\n  green than that of the canes; and smaller towns of sugar works rose\r\n  every here and there, with their threads of white smoke floating up\r\n  into the clear sky, while, as the plain receded the cultivation\r\n  disappeared, and it gradually became sterile, hot and sandy, until the\r\n  Long Mountain hove its back like a whale from out the sealike level of\r\n  the plain; while to the right of it appeared the city of Kingston,\r\n  like a model, with its parade, or _place d’armes_, in the centre, from\r\n  which its long lines of hot, sandy streets stretched out at right\r\n  angles, with the military post of Up-Park Camp, situated about a mile\r\n  and a half to the northward and eastward of the town. Through a\r\n  tolerably good glass the church spire looked like a needle, the trees\r\n  about the houses like bushes, the tall cocoanut trees like harebells;\r\n  a slow crawling black speck here and there denoted a carriage moving\r\n  along, while waggons with their teams of eighteen and twenty oxen\r\n  looked like so many centipedes. At the camp, the two regiments drawn\r\n  out on parade, with two nine-pounders on each flank, and their\r\n  attendant gunners, looked like a red sparkling line, with two black\r\n  spots at each end, surrounded by small black dots.”\r\n\r\nMichael Scott is now chiefly remembered in connection with a cotton tree\r\nat Camp by the barracks, and one on the Spanish Town road, half-way from\r\nKingston.\r\n\r\nThe following is the passage from “Tom Cringle’s Log” which has made the\r\ncotton tree at =Up-Park Camp= famous:\r\n\r\n  “I had occasion at this time to visit Up-Park Camp, a military post\r\n  about a mile and a half from Kingston, where two regiments of infantry\r\n  and a detachment of artillery were stationed.\r\n\r\n  “In the forenoon I walked out in company with an officer, a relation\r\n  of my own, whom I had gone to visit; enjoying the fresh sea-breeze\r\n  that whistled past us in half a gale of wind, although the sun was\r\n  vertical, and shining into the bottom of a pint-pot, as the sailors\r\n  have it.\r\n\r\n  “The barracks were built on what appeared to me a very dry situation\r\n  (although I have since heard it alleged that there was a swamp to\r\n  windward of it, over which the sea-breeze blew, but this I did not\r\n  see), considerably elevated above the hot, sandy plain on which\r\n  Kingston stands, and sloping gently towards the sea. They were\r\n  splendid, large, airy, two-storey buildings, well raised off the\r\n  ground on brick pillars, so that there was a perfectly free\r\n  ventilation of air between the surface of the earth and the floor of\r\n  the first storey, as well as through the whole of the upper rooms....\r\n\r\n  “This superb establishment stood in an extensive lawn, not surpassed\r\n  in beauty by any nobleman’s park that I had ever seen. It was\r\n  immediately after the rains when I visited it; the grass was luxuriant\r\n  and newly cut, and the trees, which grew in detached clumps, were most\r\n  magnificent. We clambered up into one of them, a large umbrageous wild\r\n  cotton tree, which cast a shadow on the ground—the sun being, as\r\n  already mentioned, right overhead—of thirty paces in diameter; but\r\n  still it was but a dwarfish plant of its kind, for I have measured\r\n  others whose gigantic shadows, at the same hour, were upwards of one\r\n  hundred and fifty feet in diameter, and their trunks, one in\r\n  particular that overhangs the Spanish Town Road, twenty feet through\r\n  of _solid_ timber; that is not including the enormous spurs that shoot\r\n  out like buttresses, and end in strong twisted roots that strike deep\r\n  into the earth and form stays, as it were, to the tree in all\r\n  directions.\r\n\r\n  Our object, however—publish it not in Askalon—was not so much to\r\n  admire the charms of Nature as to enjoy the luxury of a real Havannah\r\n  cigar in solitary comfort; and a glorious perch we had selected. The\r\n  shade was grateful beyond measure. The fresh breeze was rushing,\r\n  almost roaring, through the leaves and groaning branches, and\r\n  everything around was green, and fragrant, and cool, and delicious—by\r\n  comparison, that is, for the thermometer would, I daresay, have still\r\n  vouched for eighty degrees. The branches overhead were alive with a\r\n  variety of beautiful lizards and birds of the gayest plumage; amongst\r\n  others, a score of small chattering green paroquets were hopping close\r\n  to us, and playing at bo-peep from the lower surfaces of the leaves of\r\n  the wild pine (a sort of Brobdignag parasite that grows like the\r\n  mistletoe in the clefts of the large trees), to which they clung, as\r\n  green and shining as the leaves themselves, and ever and anon popping\r\n  their little heads over to peer at us; while the red-breasted\r\n  woodpecker kept drumming on every hollow part of the bark for all the\r\n  world like old Kelson, the carpenter of the _Torch_, tapping along the\r\n  top-sides for the dry rot. All around us the men were lounging about\r\n  in the shade and sprawling on the grass in their foraging caps and\r\n  light jackets, with an officer here and there lying reading, or\r\n  sauntering. about, bearding Phœbus himself, to watch for a shot at a\r\n  swallow as it skimmed past; while goats and horses, sheep and cattle\r\n  were browsing the fresh grass, or sheltering themselves from the heat\r\n  beneath the trees....\r\n\r\n  “At length the forenoon wore away, and the bugles sounded for dinner,\r\n  when we adjourned to the mess-room.”\r\n\r\nUp-Park Pen, on which Up-Park Camp now stands, was conveyed to King by\r\nthe trustees of Sir Alexander Grant in 1784. In 1793 the Assembly\r\ndeducted lodging allowance previously made to the army because of the\r\nnew barracks at Up-Park. In 1819 the Assembly in response to a request\r\nfor a water-supply resolved that it “does not feel justified in making\r\nan extraordinary grant for the troops at Up-Park, a post entirely under\r\nthe control of the British Government.” In the following year Wolmer’s\r\nPen adjoining was purchased by the Treasury as it had a well. In that\r\nyear the officer commanding asked for six mules to carry water; but the\r\nHouse was obdurate, “the barracks at Up-Park not being under the control\r\nof the House.” For a similar reason Up-Park was not included in the\r\nofficial list of “Forts, Fortifications and Public Buildings” for many\r\nyears. The history of the West India regiment, closely associated with\r\nUp-Park Camp, is extremely interesting. It dates back to the American\r\nWar of Independence when a British expedition from New York captured the\r\nState of Georgia. As a result, black and white loyalists flocked to the\r\nBritish camp where they were formed into corps of which the South\r\nCarolina was one. This regiment took an active part in the war, and in\r\n1780 was converted into a cavalry regiment which at the close of the war\r\nwas stationed in Jamaica under the command of Lord Charles Montagu.\r\n\r\nThe regiment at this period consisted of both black and white soldiers,\r\nand on the general disbandment of provincial corps in 1783, the white\r\nmembers were compensated with grants of land, and the black formed into\r\na foot regiment in combination with black mechanics, under the name of\r\nthe “Black Carolina Corps.” War broke out with France in 1793 and at\r\nthat time various black corps were formed in the West Indies, all of\r\nwhich took an active part in the fierce fighting that took place during\r\nthe succeeding years in those islands. With one of these corps, the\r\nRoyal Rangers, the South Carolina Regiment was amalgamated in 1795 under\r\nthe title of “Whyte’s Regiment of Foot.” In the West Indies, however,\r\nthese regiments were called the West India Regiments, “Whyte’s Regiment\r\nof Foot” receiving the title of “The First West India Regiment.”\r\n\r\nThis regiment, which is now the only British black regiment surviving,\r\nhas a magnificent record. It took part in the Ashantee wars of 1864 and\r\n1873–74 and was especially complimented by Sir Garnet Wolseley on its\r\nbehaviour; and in all punitive and other expeditions associated with\r\nAfrican colonisation, its members have maintained its reputation for\r\nsoldierly qualities of the highest order. It is interesting to note that\r\nin 1815 the regiment was strengthened by the Bourbon regiment of French\r\n_emigrés_ which had been disbanded at the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution. The present Zouave uniform of the corps was adopted in 1858\r\nat the suggestion of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe first reference to a West India regiment in the Jamaica Almanacs is\r\nin 1802, when the second is recorded, and so continues to 1809; then\r\ntill 1813 the fifth is recorded: in that and the following years the\r\nsecond and seventh were also at Up-Park. Then the second occurs down to\r\n1842, being accompanied by the third in 1841 and 1842. A new chapel\r\nerected to replace the one destroyed by the earthquake was consecrated\r\nin May 1912, and in 1915 four windows were put in to replace those (lost\r\nwith the old chapel) which had been erected to the memory of officers\r\nand men of the 2nd W.I.R. who fell in the Ashantee war of 1873–74.\r\n\r\n=Plum-Tree Tavern=, which stands on the junction road between Kingston\r\nand Annotto Bay, and seven miles distant from the former, is of interest\r\nas having been the scene of one of the last duels fought in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Cargill, in his article entitled “A few Words about ‘The\r\nCaptain’s Story’” in “The Journal of the Institute of Jamaica” for July\r\n1896, says: “A very amusing duel (almost the last fought in Jamaica)\r\ntook place near ‘Running Water’ [Constant Spring Estate], and was\r\nomitted from the ‘Captain’s Story’ by request of the parties concerned.\r\nAs they are all dead and gone there is no reason why it should not now\r\nbe related. My uncle, Dr. John Marston and a Captain Peel, R.N., went to\r\na party and were requested to sing. Captain Peel sang _first_, and then\r\nDr. Marston was asked to sing the same song that Captain Peel sang, but\r\ngot more applause. Peel conceived himself insulted and called out\r\nMarston. They fought at ‘Plum Tree.’ I have the pistols, Wagdon and\r\nBarton’s hair-triggers. They fired and missed, but Marston’s shot hit a\r\ntree and glanced off on to the forehead of a Mr. Berry (a book-keeper)\r\nwho had hidden in the bush to see the fight. Dr. Marston had to leave\r\nthe battlefield to attend to Berry, who was supposed to be killed. In\r\nthe meantime ‘Mrs. Jasper’ (my mother) heard of the duel and came down\r\nto Plum Tree and prevented further hostility. Mr. Berry only died a few\r\nyears ago. He had the mark of Dr. Marston’s bullet in the space between\r\nthe eyes. I have often seen the wound, which had broken the outer table\r\nof the bone there.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately old Plum-Tree Tavern was wrecked by the hurricane of 1903,\r\nand little more than the lower walls now remain to bear witness to\r\nold-time life in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nA fort on Bridge Pen (formerly Berthaville) and, at the foot of the Long\r\nMountain, now a ruin, was probably erected as a protection against\r\nrebellious slaves marching on Kingston.\r\n\r\nAt =Garden House=, Gordon Town, Hinton East (receiver-general of the\r\nIsland, 1779) gathered together a collection of rare and valuable plants\r\nwhich were purchased by the Government in 1792–3, as is mentioned in the\r\nIntroduction. The house of =Hope Tavern= was destroyed by the earthquake\r\nof 1907; the foundations still stand above the Hope river just beyond\r\nPapine on the way towards Gordon Town. In the old days it was the place\r\nwhere travellers to the Port Royal Mountains and the Blue Mountains\r\nexchanged buggies for saddles. =Cherry Garden= was once the residence of\r\nGeorge William Gordon, who will be found mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe estate at =Hope=, now a botanical garden, formerly belonged to the\r\nDuke of Buckingham. In “Notes in Defence of the Colonies,” by a West\r\nIndian, 1826, we read:\r\n\r\n  A decrease is not from premature mortality arising from slavery, for\r\n  slaves live to great ages in Jamaica: eighty and one hundred years old\r\n  are as common on estates as in any country of the same latitude, or\r\n  more so; and I saw a few years ago a negro from the Hope Estate in St.\r\n  Andrew’s, belonging to the Marquis of Buckingham, one hundred and\r\n  forty-five years old. He had walked seven miles that morning, and his\r\n  faculties were perfect, except his sight. Admiral Douglas had a\r\n  painting taken of him, by Field[8] of the Royal Academy, who was out\r\n  here, which I saw.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  There was never a member of the Royal Academy of this name. The\r\n  painter referred to was probably R. Field of Halifax, Nova Scotia, who\r\n  exhibited a portrait in 1810.\r\n\r\nThe =Jamaica College= at Hope, which was established under law 34 of\r\n1879 as the Jamaica High School, became the inheritor of the Walton\r\nfoundation in St. Ann of the year 1802, which may therefore be taken as\r\nthe date of its foundation. A college, called University College, was\r\nopened in connection with the school in 1890, but by law 26 of 1902 the\r\ncollege and school were amalgamated. During its existence thirty\r\nstudents passed through the college, and four students took the London\r\nB.A. degree, and one the M.A., without leaving the island. Amongst its\r\nalumni are several well-known teachers now working in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nAt Matilda Corner, near Hope, is a Drinking Trough, erected in 1914 by\r\nhis widow to the memory of Sir Charles Frederick Lumb, puisne judge of\r\nthe colony from 1892 to 1909, showed a keen interest in the welfare of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe =Mico College= was erected in 1896 on land in St. Andrew to the\r\nnorth of the racecourse. This building was wrecked by the earthquake,\r\nrebuilt in 1909, and again destroyed by fire in 1910: it was rebuilt as\r\nit now stands in 1911. The origin of the charity is of some historic\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nJane Robinson, widow of Sir Samuel Mico, an alderman of the city of\r\nLondon, of the family of Micault of the Isle de France, amongst numerous\r\nother bequests in her will, dated July 1, 1670, made the following:\r\n\r\n  “And whereas I haveing a great kindness for Samuel Mico, my deere\r\n  husbande kinsman son of John Mico of Croscombe in the county of\r\n  Somersett and well knoweing that my deere husband with myself had\r\n  thought of marrying him to one of my neeces and when and as sune as he\r\n  shall marrey such nece of mine viz: one of the daughters of my\r\n  brother-in-law Andrew Barker or my brother William Robinson\r\n  aforemencioned then and not before or otherwise, I give and bequeath\r\n  to him two thousand pounds lawful money of England, and on the\r\n  forementioned condition I give and bequeath to him a farm called the\r\n  Littell Parke which I bought or purchashed in the names of my brother\r\n  Andrew Barker and my brother William Robinson of the Right Honourable\r\n  the Marquis of Worcester in the manner (_sic_) of Crookham scituate\r\n  lyeing and being in the severall parishes of Chatcham in the countey\r\n  of Barke and Kingscleare in the countey of Southampton now in the\r\n  tenor or occupation of Thomas Browne and when the aforesaid Samuel\r\n  Mico shall have given a full discharge according to law when he comes\r\n  to one and twenty years of age to the executors of my deere husband\r\n  for his estate in thare hands then I give him one thousand pounds of\r\n  lawful money of England and if hee doe not to thare satisfaction I\r\n  then give it to redeeme poor slaves in what manner my Executors shall\r\n  think most convenient and I give to Samuel Mico aforesaid my deere\r\n  husband’s picter set with diamonds and I give him my crimson damaske\r\n  bedd with all that belongs to that sute and my great Lucking Glace and\r\n  my marbell tabell when he comes to the age of one and twenty yeares he\r\n  dying before that age I give them to my two Executors.\r\n\r\n  “But if the above Samuel Mico do not marry one of my neces aforesaid\r\n  my will is if he be a civel man and doe marrey into a good family and\r\n  has a porchone with her answereable to his estate and has a sonne that\r\n  lives to the age of a man I then give him the Littell Parke in the\r\n  manner of Crookham in the parish Chactham in the County of Barkes and\r\n  Kingscleare in the county of Southampton. But if he have no sonne I\r\n  give it to his brother Richard Mico sonne if hee have any if he have\r\n  no sonne then to my two executors I give it.”\r\n\r\nAfter further bequests she turns to her nephew.\r\n\r\n  “And furthermore I doe hereby declare that whereas I gave Samuel Mico\r\n  aforesaid two thousand pounds when he had married one of my neeces he\r\n  not performing it I give one of the saide thousand pounds to redeem\r\n  poore slaves which I would have put out as my Executors thinke the\r\n  best for a yeerely revenue to redeem some yeerely, and if the\r\n  aforesaide Samuel Mico marry one of my neeces I then give him my best\r\n  Pearl Necklace and all my plate that I doe not give away by this my\r\n  will.”\r\n\r\nSamuel Mico was by the terms of his aunt’s will given the option of\r\nmarrying any one of the six nieces of Lady Mico-Jane, Mary and Elizabeth\r\nRobinson, and Jane, Mary and Elizabeth Barker; the Jane in each case\r\nbeing apparently the most desirable bride from a monetary point of view\r\nas being god-daughter of his rich aunt: and of these Jane Barker was the\r\nfavourite, unless Lady Mico in her bequest took into account the\r\nrespective wealth of the two families, for there is evidence in Lady\r\nMico’s will that Jane Barker’s father was not opulent. Apparently not\r\none of the six pleased him; nor could he be induced to change his mind\r\nby the promise of his aunt’s best pearl necklace and the unbequeathed\r\nportion of her plate. Thus the £1000 went to the redemption of “poore\r\nslaves,” _i.e._ Christians held in captivity by the Moors of Algiers, in\r\naid of whose release benevolent persons were at that time wont to make\r\nbequests.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century pirates, mostly from Algiers, swarmed along\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean sea, and numberless captives were taken\r\nas slaves and detained as such in Algiers and Barbary.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the eighteenth and the earlier part of the\r\nnineteenth century both France and England had done much to put a stop\r\nto piracy in the Mediterranean, and when in 1816 Algiers was taken by\r\nPellew and the slaves, some three thousand in number, mostly Spanish and\r\nItalian, were liberated, there no longer existed an outlet for the\r\nspecial benevolence on their behalf of Lady Mico and other\r\nphilanthropists.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1827 the Court of Chancery referred the matter of the Mico\r\nbequest for the redemption of poor slaves to Lord Henley, Master in\r\nChancery, to devise a scheme for the application of the money according\r\nto the will of the foundress; and if the Master should find that the\r\nsame could not be executed according to her will, then “as near its\r\nintent as possible,” regard being had to existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Lady Mico’s £1000 had increased—partly by the\r\nre-investment of the unused income, partly by the realisation of a\r\nmaterial profit on an investment in London property—to upwards of\r\n£120,000, giving a yearly income of £3625, and nobody knew what to do\r\nwith it; but a matter very “near its intent” was already before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWhile the name of William Wilberforce in England will ever be honoured\r\nas the prime mover in the abolition of the curse of the Slave Trade, the\r\ncompletion of his life’s work by the abolition of slavery in the British\r\ncolonies proved too heavy for his age-enfeebled shoulders. This great\r\nundertaking he consigned in 1821 to the care of an earnest colleague,\r\nThomas Fowell Buxton; and it was under this younger champion’s\r\nleadership of the forces of Emancipation and through his indefatigable\r\nefforts that the inevitable day was hastened, when, in Jamaica, the flag\r\nof Great Britain floated—as in every portion of the far-extended British\r\ndominions—over none but freemen.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Act came into force on August 1, 1834, and on July 29\r\nof the following year the Master of the Rolls made an order confirming\r\nthe scheme prepared by Buxton and Stephen Lushington, by which the Lady\r\nMico Charity was founded, for giving Christian education to the coloured\r\npopulation of the British colonies. It was eminently fitting that to\r\nBuxton and Lushington, with others of kindred spirit, should be trusted\r\nthe administration of the fund to confer the blessings of education upon\r\nthe freed people of the British West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe institution in Jamaica, where the trustees have finally concentrated\r\ntheir efforts, was at first locally looked after by a board of visitors.\r\nThis in 1882 was replaced by a board of directors. Each year some\r\ntwenty-four students leave its walls to take up the work of education.\r\n\r\nThe burial-grounds of interest are the =Newcastle Burial Ground=,\r\ncontaining military monuments, _inter alia_ a monument to officers and\r\nmen of the 36th Regiment who died there and at Stony Hill of yellow\r\nfever in 1856; and the rare instance of musical notation on a tomb. The\r\noldest tomb is dated 1844. The =Jewish Burial-Ground= at Hunt’s Bay, the\r\nwall of which was destroyed by the earthquake of 1907, has its oldest\r\ntomb 1678; at the Up-Park Camp new burial-ground the oldest tomb is\r\ndated 1836; and at the disused graveyard the oldest one is dated 1819, a\r\nyear during which yellow fever proved very fatal to the troops. The\r\nprincipal monument in =May Pen Cemetery=, the general burial-ground for\r\nKingston, is the simple obelisk erected in 1909 to the Unknown Dead who\r\nperished in Kingston in the earthquake of January 14, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen-middens worthy of note are =Norbrook=, near Constant Spring;\r\n=Belle Vue=, in the Red Hills; =Hope=, near the old tavern; and =Long\r\nMountain= (on the top and on northern slope): =Dallas Castle= Cave and\r\n=Bloxburgh= Cave have Arawâk remains. The latter was discovered in 1895,\r\nand gave an impetus to archæological research.\r\n\r\n=Silver Hill=, near Newcastle, contains the Jamaica Spa, a mineral\r\nspring of great value; it was once in great request, but is now not\r\nused. The =Cane River Falls= are famed for their beauty. They were the\r\nhaunt of “Three-fingered Jack,” who was captured in 1781, and later\r\nformed the hero of a transpontine melodrama; various editions of the\r\nplay having been issued.\r\n\r\n=Hagley Gap= is named after Hagley in Worcestershire, the home of\r\nWilliam Henry Lyttelton, governor in 1762–66. It is interesting to note\r\nthat Mr. Jekyll in his “Jamaican Song and Story” informs us that he was\r\ntold locally that it was so called because it was “a hugly place”!\r\n\r\n=Catherine’s Peak= (often miscalled St. Catherine’s Peak), near\r\nNewcastle, was named after Catherine Long (sister of the historian, and\r\nwife of Henry Moore, lieutenant-governor) who in 1760 was the first lady\r\nto ascend that peak.\r\n\r\n=Gordon Town= was formerly the property of a family of that name; but\r\nwas not, as some suppose, connected with George William Gordon, of\r\nMorant Bay fame.\r\n\r\n=Dallas Castle= (which still survives as a district in St. Andrew) was\r\nowned by a scion of the family of Dallas, in the state of Alabama, whose\r\ndescendants played their part in Jamaica history.\r\n\r\n=Manning’s Hill= in St. Andrew Hills, and =Salt Hill=, =Morce’s Gap=,\r\nand =Hardwar Gap= (usually miscalled Hardware Gap), in the Blue\r\nMountains, recall the names of former owners. Edward Manning, a wealthy\r\nmerchant, who represented Kingston in the Assembly for many years. John\r\nMorce was at one time sergeant-at-arms of the Assembly and also deputy\r\npostmaster. John Hardwar was auditor-general in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe Scarletts were amongst the earliest settlers in Jamaica. On April\r\n24, 1673–74, Colonel Samuel Barry and Captain George Nedham took to the\r\nCouncil from the Assembly, with four other bills, a bill for\r\ncompensating the loss of “Mr. Nicholas Scarlett, received by the pursuit\r\nof the rebellious negroes at Legonea.” This was read three times and\r\nsent to the Assembly with these amendments: “In the sixth line after ‘be\r\nit enacted by the Governor and Council’ add ‘and the representatives of\r\nthe Commons of this Island now assembled and by the authority thereof,\r\nthat the said Nicholas,’ &c....” On May 17 it passed the House. A\r\nsimilar bill was No. 14 on the list of forty bills brought out by the\r\nEarl of Carlisle. It was voted “not to pass” on October 11, 1678, the\r\nCommittee’s reasons against it being: “Because Mr. Scarlett hath been in\r\nEngland since, and when the former Act was first made it was intended to\r\ncontinue only during the residence here, and, that if notwithstanding\r\nany further consideration ought to be had it were better that the entire\r\nsum were given, rather than to enlarge anything upon the revenue.” What\r\nrelation Nicholas Scarlett was to Francis Scarlett is not evident. He is\r\nnot mentioned in the latter’s will.\r\n\r\nCaptain Francis Scarlett, the son of Benjamin Scarlett, of Eastbourne in\r\nSussex, came out with Penn and Venables, but as his name is not\r\nmentioned in the “perfect list of all the forces under the command of\r\nHis Excellency General Venables, taken at muster, March 21, 1654,” he\r\npresumably must then have held rank below that of captain. He patented\r\nlands on the Wag Water in the 28th year of Charles II, and bought\r\nneighbouring land in the vicinity of the present Temple Hall Estate. In\r\nthe “Survey of the Island of Jamaica” sent home by Modyford in 1670 he\r\nis put down as owning 1000 acres in St. Andrew, in which parish there\r\nwere then 194 families, and people, “by estimation” 1552. Only five\r\nmen—Archbould, Hope, Howell, Parker (his neighbour), and Tothill were\r\nlarger landowners in the parish than Scarlett at that time. He was\r\nrecorded as Captain Francis Scarlett, member of the Assembly for St.\r\nAndrew in 1680–81; his co-member was Colonel Samuel Barry. He returned\r\nto England, and died unmarried in Eastbourne. He left his estate to his\r\nnephew William Scarlett, of the Middle Temple. A William Scarlett, of\r\nPort Royal, merchant, named as one of the Commissioners to take the\r\nevidence of certain witnesses in the Chancery suit of Elizabeth Smart\r\n_versus_ John Parnaby in 1685, may be identical with him. It is\r\ninteresting to note that one of his executors to whom he left legacies\r\nwas Sir Bartholomew Gracedieu of London, Agent for Jamaica in England.\r\n\r\nThe first William Scarlett was succeeded by his only son William. This\r\nWilliam (the second) was married in 1705 in the parish church of St.\r\nAndrew to Judith, daughter and co-heiress of Gideon Lecount of St. Jago\r\nde la Vega. She must have been very young, for she was not of age three\r\nyears later. He and his wife sold the Wag Water estate, some of it to\r\nSir Nicholas Lawes, the rest to James Herbert of St. Andrew, planter,\r\nand from that time onwards the fortunes of the Scarletts were connected\r\nwith the western parishes of the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n                               ST. THOMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Thomas (or as it was formerly called St.\r\nThomas-in-the-East to distinguish it from St. Thomas-in-the-Vale), which\r\nnow embraces the former parish of St. David, is one of the oldest\r\nparishes in the island. Roby points out that, although St. Thomas was so\r\ncalled before the arrival of Sir Thomas Modyford, Doyley’s immediate\r\nsuccessor in the Government was Thomas Hickman, Lord Windsor, after whom\r\nit may have been called. But many of the parishes in the sister colonies\r\nwere named after saints, and we need probably seek no further than the\r\ndesire to establish church districts in the newly acquired lands for the\r\norigin of the names of several of Jamaica’s parishes. It was settled by\r\nthe Spaniards and was thus described by General Venables, of the army of\r\noccupation, in 1655: “Morante is a large and beautiful hato, being four\r\nleagues in length, consisting of many small savannahs, and has wild\r\ncattle and hogs in very great plenty, and ends at the mine, which is at\r\nthe cape or point of Morante itself, by which towards the north is the\r\nport of Antonio.”\r\n\r\nThere was a settlement at Yallahs (called Yealoth), when Sir Thomas\r\nModyford surveyed the island in 1663. In 1661 Sir Charles Lyttelton\r\nrecorded that “the regiment of Port Morant, Morant and Yallahs,\r\ncommanded by Colonel Lynch, is the richest settlement.”\r\n\r\nIn 1671 Sir Thomas Modyford wrote home, in answer to questions as to\r\nchurch matters, that “Mr. Pickering of St. Thomas and St. Davids at Port\r\nMorant and Yallahs, is lately dead and they have none to supply his\r\nplace.” There is no reference to a church, but rather a suggestion that\r\nthere was none; “but they meet at each others houses as the primitive\r\nChristians do.”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a church shown at Yallahs in “A new and exact map of\r\nJamaica ... dedicated to Sir Thomas Lynch” in “The Laws of Jamaica” of\r\n1684. Therefore the date of the foundation of =Yallahs Church= was\r\nbetween 1671 and 1684.\r\n\r\nThe chalice and patten belonging to this church are amongst the oldest\r\nin the island. They are at present deposited in the offices of the\r\nChurch of England in Jamaica in Kingston. The chalice, 6 inches high, is\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n                          _John Hammond      }\r\n                       William Donaldson } Esqrs.\r\n                             Churchwardens\r\n                              of St. David\r\n                                 1739._\r\n\r\nThe patten, 9¼ inches in diameter, is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                              _St. Davids\r\n                             Thomas Rijues\r\n                              James Lobley\r\n                             Churchwardens\r\n                                 1683._\r\n\r\nAfter Cromwell had acquired Jamaica through the blundering of Penn and\r\nVenables at Hispaniola, he set about finding colonists for his new\r\nplantation, and conceived the idea of inducing settlers in the Leeward\r\nIslands to go thither. Amongst those who acted in the matter was old\r\nLuke Stokes, governor of Nevis.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1655–6, he wrote from Nevis to Sedgwick in Jamaica:\r\n\r\n  MAJOR SEDGWICKE,\r\n\r\n  SIR, his highnes undeserved and unexpected favours he hath bin pleased\r\n  to throw some of them uppon my self wherein hee hath in some\r\n  particulars declared his highnes designe concerning Jamaica and made\r\n  mee an instrument to declaire it to the people of this colloni; so\r\n  likewise I have declaired it to my adjacent nighbours, and caused his\r\n  proclamations to bee published; and I find in this island the greatest\r\n  part of the inhabitants, with their wives, children and servants, are\r\n  willing and ready to accept his highnes termes, laid downe in his\r\n  highnes proclamation.\r\n\r\n  There is onely wanting transportation for them and theires. What\r\n  provission his highnes intends to make when his fleete comes (which\r\n  wee are informed wee may daily expect) I know not; but in case there\r\n  bee not, if by you and the others, that are intrusted in those great\r\n  affaires of his highness, to send them shipping for theire\r\n  transportation, and such provissions as they intend to carry with them\r\n  may effect it, the which I leave to your grave considerations.\r\n\r\n  Sir, the number of men in a moneth’s time, which is of this place, may\r\n  arrise neere to one thousand, besides women children and slaves. Sir,\r\n  other islands are forward, if they may but have a convenient\r\n  transport, and some man impowered to treat with the governours about\r\n  them, concerninge some small debts, or other small engagements, which\r\n  paradventure may bee some cause of stoppidge to them therein, which to\r\n  further his highnes designe may be composed with his power.\r\n\r\n  Sir, bee pleased to give mee leave, to publish to yourself, I am in my\r\n  hart his highnes faithful servant, yours and all his. Sir, I pray God\r\n  direct you in all your highnes designes and bee your wisdome and\r\n  directions, and all God’s people in theire lawfull imployes. Sir\r\n\r\n                                              Your servant,\r\n                                                          L. STOKES,\r\n                                                                  Major.\r\n\r\nSedgwick probably only received this letter a few weeks before his\r\ndeath, which occurred on May 24, 1656.\r\n\r\nVice-Admiral Goodson wrote home to the Admiralty Commissioners from on\r\nboard the _Torrington_ at Jamaica on June 24:\r\n\r\n  Upon notice given from Governor Stokes of himself and the people of\r\n  Nevis their intention to transplant themselves hither, dispatched\r\n  three ships for their transport, and 4th June a vessel arrived from\r\n  the Governor with three gentlemen to treat with us concerning shipping\r\n  and to view the country. Afterwards fitted out a small vessel to carry\r\n  back our resolutions of sending ships for about 1000 people besides\r\n  women, children and servants.\r\n\r\nOn September 23 he wrote that he had been informed by Wm. Simons, master\r\nof the _Peter_ of Bristol, which had put in at Barbados, that:\r\n\r\n  Three ships had sometime since arrived at Nevis, that the Governor\r\n  there had not only used all means possible to induce the people of\r\n  Nevis to transplant themselves to [Jamaica] but had gone to St\r\n  Christopher’s to draw what people he can from thence.\r\n\r\nStokes, with his 1600 settlers, arrived in Jamaica during the\r\nadministration of Goodsonn and Doyley, and just about the same time as\r\nthe arrival of Brayne on December 14 with his 1000 troops. The site\r\nselected for Stokes was in the Spanish Hato de Morante, near Port\r\nMorant, whither some of the soldiers had already been sent with the\r\nobject of colonization; and doubtless he set to work to establish his\r\nsettlement with all the ardour that he had displayed in getting his\r\nfollowers together; but the sad fate of his venture is recorded by Long,\r\nthe historian. Brayne had petitioned the Protector that he might be\r\nrecalled at the end of one year’s service. Long tells us that:\r\n\r\n  Several disheartening circumstances occurred besides what have already\r\n  been noticed, and contributed to make him disgusted with the command.\r\n  He had conceived great hopes from the industry of the Nevis planters\r\n  settled at Morante; and imagined, that the example of their success\r\n  would not only prove an incentive to the drones of the army, but\r\n  induce many persons to remove from the other islands and dissipate\r\n  their ill-grounded fears. But, about the latter end of February,\r\n  Governor Stokes and his wife died, leaving three sons, the eldest of\r\n  whom was not more than fifteen years old. The Governor was advanced in\r\n  age when he left Nevis; and had been at so much expense in the\r\n  removal, that his fortune was greatly impaired by it. In his last\r\n  moments he earnestly recommended his family to Brayne and the\r\n  Protector, who afterwards bestowed a commission in the army on his\r\n  eldest son. Either this gentleman, or one of his brothers, formed a\r\n  very good plantation, which still continues with their descendants.\r\n  Near two-thirds of these unfortunate planters at Morante were buried\r\n  before the month of March; the rest were reduced to a sickly condition\r\n  and the danger of starving, for want of strength either to gather in\r\n  their crops of provisions already come to maturity, or to plant anew.\r\n\r\nBut a little further on Long tells us that “in the meantime the remnant\r\nof the settlers at Morante, having recovered their healths, and got in\r\ntheir harvest, were exempted from the calamities which oppressed the\r\nother inhabitants, and proceeded in their labours with great ardour and\r\nsuccess.” And still further on he says that “In 1671 notwithstanding the\r\nmortality which had swept off many of the first planters, there were\r\nupwards of sixty settlements in this neighbourhood; many of which formed\r\na line along the coast Eastward from the harbour, where are only two or\r\nthree at present.”\r\n\r\nIn Modyford’s “Survey of the Island of Jamaica” sent home on September\r\n23, 1670, we find recorded:\r\n\r\n          St. Thomas Parish  John Stokes             25 acres.\r\n          St. David’s Parish Jacob Stokes           640 acres.\r\n                             Jacob Stokes and Smith    1 acre.\r\n\r\nOf Luke Stokes research has failed to reveal any particulars, either as\r\nto place of origin, family or personal accomplishments. He would seem to\r\nhave been a simple-minded man, who did his best for his country.\r\n\r\nOne wonders what relation, if any, he was to Admiral John Stokes,\r\n“Commander-in-Chief of the English Forces upon the coast of Africa,”\r\nagainst whose actions the States-General of Holland, on behalf of the\r\nDutch West India Company, protested in 1663. This was apparently the\r\nsame Admiral Stokes who commanded the _Marmaduke_ which brought Modyford\r\nfrom Barbados to Jamaica in 1664.\r\n\r\nJacob Stokes, who was member for St. David in 1672, and his namesake who\r\nsat for St. Thomas in 1721, were apparently the only members of the\r\nfamily to sit in the House of Assembly, although their name appears in\r\nthe Island records till the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn November 1732 a petition, dated April of that year, by one John\r\nEvans, overseer of Dousabel plantation, complained to the Assembly that\r\nhe had been opprobriously used by Colonel Jacob Stoakes and his son\r\nJacob Stoakes, with several of their negroes, in passing through said\r\nColonel Stoakes his plantation to the seaside or barquadier in which\r\ncomplaint it appears that Evans applied in vain to the custos, the chief\r\njustice, the magistrates of the parish, and the attorney general, being\r\nsent from one to the other—for a warrant for Colonel Stoakes’ arrest. It\r\nwas resolved that the report do lie on the table.\r\n\r\n=Stokes Hall= and =Stokesfield= are now all that remain to testify to\r\ngallant old Luke Stokes’s attempt to assist the struggling colony of\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STOKES HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\nStokes Hall is possibly the oldest house in good preservation in the\r\nisland. It was probably built soon after it was found that Stokesfield\r\nwas unhealthy by reason of the swamps near Port Morant. It is a very\r\nsubstantially built building. It apparently consisted at first of a\r\nsingle-storey building measuring 48 ft. 6 ins. by 30 ft., with four\r\ntwo-storied towers at the corners each measuring 13 ft. by 19 ft., the\r\ntowers overlapping the main building by the width of the doorway. The\r\nwalls are of solid stone work 2 ft. 6 ins. thick. The lower storeys of\r\nthe towers are 13 ft. high and the upper about 15 ft. Both towers and\r\nmain building are loopholed, each tower having eight loopholes, two at\r\neach corner. The building stands at an altitude of about 290 feet, on a\r\nrange of hills between Plantain Garden valley and the sea, and commands\r\na fine view of Holland bay about five miles away. The upper storey of\r\nthe main building and the front and back verandahs are evidently\r\nadditions of a later date.\r\n\r\nThough not of course the selfsame house that sheltered poor Luke Stokes,\r\nit carries us back to the days when dwellers far from the capital of St.\r\nJago de la Vega had to depend in great measure on their own resources\r\nfor protection from the incursions of foreign foes, bloodthirsty pirates\r\nor rebellious slaves.\r\n\r\nStokesfield, which was possibly the earliest home of Luke Stokes,\r\nstand at an elevation of about 300 ft., about three miles to the north\r\nof Port Morant harbour, of which it commands a fine view. Much damaged\r\nby the hurricane of 1903 and again by the earthquake of 1907, it was\r\noriginally a substantially built loopholed two-storey building, but\r\ninferior in solidity to Stokes Hall. It has evidently been altered\r\nfrom time to time; in the early part of the nineteenth century, and\r\nagain in the seventies, when the present owner took possession. The\r\nbuilding was in the shape of a cross, the transept made by two porches\r\n18 ft. square, the main body measuring 74 ft. by 46 ft. with five\r\nbedrooms upstairs, to which access was gained by a winding stair. On\r\nthe front wall has been placed a tablet with the inscription “T. S.\r\nH., 1775,” it is supposed for Thomas Stokes Harris (said to have been\r\nthe grandson of Colonel Stokes), whose grave is still to be seen on\r\nthe estate. Till some years ago an English weeping willow planted by\r\nit was still alive. Thomas Stokes Harris is recorded as one of the\r\nmagistrates of St.-Thomas-in-the-East and St. David in the “Jamaica\r\nAlmanac” for 1776: but as he continues as Thomas S. Harris till 1791,\r\nhe must have been of a later generation than the man who died in 1775.\r\nFrom 1782 to 1805 a Thomas Harris was coroner and clerk of the peace\r\nand vestry for the parish. The latter Thomas Stokes Harris’s will\r\ndated 1790 was proved in 1792.\r\n\r\nIn the “In-giving” for 1810, and for another thirty years or more, in\r\nthe “Jamaica Almanac,” Stoakes Hall was owned by the trustees of\r\nAlexander Donaldson. In 1810, it had 263 slaves and 169 head of stock.\r\nStoakesfield was then owned by Peter Wallace, and had sixty-four slaves\r\nand seven head of stock, but the latter is absent from later in-givings.\r\n\r\nIn 1746 Jacob Stoakes and Mary his wife mortgaged Stoakes Hall to Daniel\r\nMcQueen to secure £3209 (currency). It was described as containing 1057\r\nacres part of 1330 acres patented by Charles Whitefield. Jacob Stoakes\r\ndied in 1749. McQueen took possession after Stoakes’s death and\r\ncontinued in possession till July 8, 1758, when he died; and his\r\nexecutors continued to run the estate until Ann Stoakes, the only\r\nsurviving child, who in 1760 had married Richard Cargill of St. Thomas,\r\ntook proceedings in Chancery which resulted in their favour and also\r\nshowing a balance in their favour of £639 18_s._ 4_d._ which was\r\ndirected to be paid them by the executors of McQueen, who were also\r\nordered to reconvey Stoakes Hall to Richard Cargill and Ann his wife\r\nfree from the mortgage.\r\n\r\nThe following items of account taken from the old Chancery records may\r\nprove of interest.\r\n\r\n                           STOAKES HALL A/CS.\r\n                                               £   _s._ _d._\r\n            Profit shown in a/c for year 1749  312    1    8\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1750   45   14   6½\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1751  543    0    8\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1752   34    3    8\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1753 1441   11   8½\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1755  786    4    0\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1756 1317    0   2¼\r\n              „      „   „   „   „   „   1757  897    5   9¼\r\n\r\n                         CERTAIN ITEMS FROM A/C.\r\n     1752\r\n\r\n _Nov._ 24th.

Taxes for 1748.                            15    10    7½\r\n\r\n=Morant Bay=, the chief town and shipping port, is noted as being the\r\nprincipal scene of the disturbances of 1865. Nearly all the public\r\nbuildings were then burnt down. No disturbance in the West Indies since\r\nthe days of Emancipation has caused half so much excitement or given\r\nrise to half so much acrimonious correspondence, publication and\r\nlitigation as that which occurred in Jamaica in 1865, and is usually\r\nknown as the “Morant Bay Rebellion.” Apart from the official inquiry,\r\nwhich is of course judicial in tone, the publications range over the\r\nwhole subject of negrophobia or negrophilia—of abuse of Governor Eyre\r\nand of his defence.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Edward John Eyre was appointed acting governor of Jamaica, and\r\nwhen in 1864 he became full governor, the post was no bed of roses. The\r\nisland was not prosperous, the American war had raised the price of\r\nAmerican breadstuffs, and the governor was at variance with the House of\r\nAssembly, in which the negro population was then represented. Agitation\r\nended in riot at Morant Bay on October 11, 1865. Undoubtedly the riot,\r\nor rebellion, was a very serious one in its actual results, and still\r\nmore in its possible consequences, and but for its prompt and energetic\r\nrepression it might have spread into a general negro insurrection in an\r\nisland where the negroes outnumbered the whites by at least fifty to\r\none. Martial law was proclaimed on October 13 throughout the county of\r\nSurrey, except Kingston, and tranquillity was restored. Then followed\r\ncourts-martial and punishments; and George William Gordon, a ringleader,\r\nwas taken from Kingston, where martial law did not exist, to Morant Bay,\r\nwhere it did, tried by an ill-constituted court-martial, and executed in\r\nhaste and on evidence wholly insufficient.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the outbreak at Morant Bay, October 11, 1865, twenty-two\r\ncivilians, including the custos (the chief magistrate), and volunteers\r\nwere killed and thirty-four wounded; under martial law 439 were put to\r\ndeath (354 by sentence of courts-martial—the rest shot by soldiers,\r\nsailors or maroons who were employed by the Government). In addition\r\nthere were 147 put to death after martial law ceased. One thousand\r\n“houses,” some of them very flimsy in character, were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThese Jamaica disturbances engaged public attention in England for\r\nnearly three years, and caused an excitement quite unprecedented. The\r\nParliamentary papers relating to the case are voluminous, consisting as\r\nthey do of eight separate publications and covering in the aggregate no\r\nless than 2336 pages. The first series of papers begins with the\r\ncelebrated letter of Dr. Underhill to Mr. Cardwell, drawing attention to\r\nthe state of affairs in Jamaica, and the subsequent despatches have\r\nreference to it or the question which it raised.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners appointed to enquire into the origin, nature, and\r\ncircumstances of the disturbances and the means adopted for their\r\nsuppression, and the conduct of those concerned in the disturbances and\r\nsuppression, after taking a large amount of evidence reported that the\r\ndisturbances had their immediate origin in a planned resistance to\r\nlawful authority, which resistance was caused in manifold ways—by a\r\ndesire to obtain land free of rent, a lack of confidence on the part of\r\nthe labouring class in the tribunals before which most of their disputes\r\nwere adjudicated, and in some cases hostility towards political and\r\npersonal opponents, and a desire to attain their ends by the death or\r\nexpulsion of the white inhabitants of the island. They further reported\r\nthat, though the original design was confined to a small portion of\r\nSt.-Thomas-in-the-East, the disorder rapidly spread over an extensive\r\ntract of country, and that praise was due to Eyre for his skill,\r\npromptitude and vigour, which in a great degree caused its speedy\r\ntermination. The military and naval operations appeared to them prompt\r\nand judicious, but they thought that martial law was continued longer\r\nthan necessary and that the punishments inflicted were excessive.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Secretary of State to Sir Henry Storks stated that Her\r\nMajesty’s Government generally concurred in the conclusions arrived at\r\nby the commission. So far as Eyre was concerned, it gave him full credit\r\nfor his promptness in quelling the outbreak, but held him responsible\r\nfor the continuance of excessive severity, and for the method of\r\nGordon’s trial and execution. Eyre was recalled and was most bitterly\r\nattacked by a large section of the English people headed by John Stuart\r\nMill, and defended by another led by Carlyle, whose original draft\r\nmanuscript defence of Eyre is in the West India library of the Institute\r\nof Jamaica. Eyre successfully underwent more than one legal prosecution.\r\nHe retired on a pension into private life, and never sought, even in the\r\nface of the greatest hostility, to justify his actions to the world. He\r\ndied at Tavistock on November 30, 1901, aged eighty-six. “He did many\r\ngood and brave things, and atoned for the one error of his life by a\r\nsilence so dignified and so prolonged.”\r\n\r\nBehind the court house is =Mount Bay Fort=, dating from the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe present church of =Morant Bay= was built in 1881, on the site of the\r\nchurch destroyed by the cyclone of August 19, 1880, and the church so\r\ndestroyed was built to take the place of the old church near the\r\nalmshouse, which is now in ruins. There are tombs in the ruined church\r\nto Jane Ellis (d. 1763); Marmaduke Freeman (d. 1709); and to Mary, wife\r\nof Sir Henry Lyttelton, governor (d. 1808).\r\n\r\nThe village of =Bath= contains a thermal spring of great value. An\r\nhistorical account of the Bath was contributed by Dr. G. J. Neish to the\r\n“Journal of the Institute of Jamaica” in 1895, and from it much of the\r\nfollowing account is taken.\r\n\r\nTradition says that a runaway slave hiding in the gorge came upon a\r\nspring in which he bathed. Finding the temperature greatly to his\r\nliking, he returned constantly to the pool, and after the lapse of some\r\ndays was astonished and delighted at the evidence of healing in a\r\nlong-standing ulcer on one of his legs. With his ulcer healed he braved\r\nthe wrath of his master to communicate the discovery of the pool.\r\nColonel Stanton, the owner of the land, sold his right in the spring “to\r\nthe public in the year 1699 for a valuable consideration.”\r\n\r\nBy the law passed in 1699 the land was vested in “The Directors of the\r\nBath of St. Thomas the Apostle.” They consisted of the governor (Sir\r\nWilliam Beeston), the chief justice (Nicholas Lawes), Peter Beckford,\r\nand Peter Heywood, and seven other members of the privy council, and\r\nfive justices of the peace of St. Thomas and St. David. They were a body\r\ncorporate and had power to erect a market, and to grant licences and to\r\nsell and retail strong liquors.\r\n\r\nIn 1731 an Act was passed for rendering the Bath more serviceable. From\r\nthe preamble it appears that there were no house or proper conveniences\r\nfor the accommodation of sick persons. £500 was voted for a house. The\r\nleases of lands were cancelled, but land was to be granted to soldiers\r\nand others who would settle, and who would be exempt from taxes for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\nA road was made, buildings were erected, and the public began to make\r\nuse of the bath. Shortly afterwards lots were laid out and assigned, a\r\ntown sprang up. Slaves were purchased to look after the roads and the\r\nvegetable gardens which had been planted for provisioning the hospital,\r\nwhich was built on the town square. The foundation was in more modern\r\ndays utilized for supporting the present court house, and the old baths\r\nare still to be seen on the ground floor. The bath house at the spring\r\nwas first built on the brink of the river, opposite the point of issue\r\nof the water which was conducted across the stream by a wooden gutter.\r\n\r\nChanges in the river bank afterwards made it possible to build the house\r\non the same side as the hot spring and so near that the water retained\r\nits heat. The baths grew fashionable and the town of Bath rapidly became\r\na society resort. People of wealth built houses and brought their\r\namusements with them. Gaiety prevailed and music, dancing and\r\ncard-playing were indulged in; but fashionables wearied, quarrelled and\r\nsought for pastures new. In 1774, Long complained of the desertion of\r\nBath; the decline went steadily on, and it never regained its\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nThere is a stone table affixed to the portico of the court house,\r\nbearing this inscription:\r\n\r\n  This public building was erected under the inspection of the Hon.\r\n  Charles Price, Peter Valette and William Forbes, Esqrs., appointed\r\n  commissioners for carrying on the same, the foundation of which was\r\n  begun on the 10th day of March, 1747.\r\n\r\nThis tablet originally belonged to the old bath house and was many years\r\nago picked out of the river bed, and after lying in a yard in the town\r\nfor some time was rescued by the authorities and placed on the front of\r\nthe court house.\r\n\r\nAfter 1789, the old =Botanic Garden= in Bath was placed under the\r\ncorporation. Dr. Thomas Dancer, best known as the author of “The Medical\r\nAssistant or Jamaica Practice of Physic” (1801), and as chief of the\r\nhospital staff on the expedition to San Juan de Nicaragua from Jamaica\r\nin 1779, when Nelson nearly lost his life from malarial fever, was for\r\nmany years from 1781 to 1792 physician to the bath, and Island botanist\r\nfrom 1797. While acting in the former capacity, he brought out in 1784\r\n“A Short Dissertation on the Jamaica Bath Waters, to which is prefixed\r\nan introduction concerning mineral waters in general....”\r\n\r\nOf the rainfall he says, “above forty perpendicular inches have fallen\r\nin about the space of six or eight hours, which is nearly double the\r\nquantity that on a medium, falls in Great Britain through a whole year.”\r\nThe work also contained a list of the rarer plants cultivated in the\r\ngarden, of which he published a full list in 1792. Some of the plants he\r\nowed to the interest of Sir Joseph Banks, with whom he corresponded.\r\n\r\nNear the Johnson River to the west of Morant Bay is =Belvedere= estate,\r\n2200 acres in extent, the original home of Colonel Thomas Freeman, the\r\nfirst speaker of the House of Assembly.\r\n\r\nThere are remains of a fine aqueduct, a water-wheel, still used for\r\npumping water, parts of very extensive works, and higher up the hill the\r\ngreat house and the overseer’s house. Now, bananas and coco-nuts usurp\r\nthe place of cane. Not far from the great house, in a logwood\r\nplantation, is a tomb on the front of which is a massive slate slab with\r\nthe following inscription:\r\n\r\n  Here lyeth Anne Freeman who was Wife to y^e Hon. / Colonel Thomas\r\n  Freeman of Bellvedere Daughter to Richard Bellthrapp Esq. &\r\n  Grandaughter to St. John Colt / Shee left five sonns and one daughter\r\n  (viz) Thomas, / John, Charles, Richard and Howard, And Anne two\r\n  sisters /in the island Hester married to y^e Hon. Colonell John Cope /\r\n  and Margaret unmaried. Shee departed this life August y^e 3rd 1681\r\n  Ætatis Sua^o 30.\r\n\r\n            Shee liv’d a Vertuous and Religious Life\r\n            Shee was a Tender Mother and a most loveing wife.\r\n\r\nThe slab was thrown down by the earthquake of 1907, and on October 4,\r\n1911, the writer saw in the vault two skulls and the bones appertaining.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of George Cuthbert (who governed Jamaica as senior member of\r\nthe Council in 1832 and 1834); which is said to have been here, is not\r\nnow to be found.\r\n\r\nDr. William Lloyd, in his “Letters from the West Indies,” wrote in 1837\r\nof Belvedere as follows:\r\n\r\n  Belvidere is a noble estate: the great house has a balcony thirty\r\n  yards long, fronting the sea; it may be one mile from the shore; the\r\n  cane grounds descend thereto skirted by cocoanut palms; neighbouring\r\n  and distant hills form an imposing background and complete the\r\n  panoramic spectacle. The sick house is a clean, commodious, handsome\r\n  building, and the children and others confined under a prevalent\r\n  epidemic, measles, well attended to: the negroes’ cottages were like\r\n  so many harbors in bowers of ever-greens; and close at hand the\r\n  inmates had built a chapel at their own expense, spacious enough for\r\n  hundreds; neither mahogany, glass nor doors, formed part of the\r\n  structure; but there was a pulpit, and one substantial adornment,\r\n  simplicity, around and throughout; service was performed in it every\r\n  sabbath. An intelligent negro acted as our Cicerone through the\r\n  village, conducting us into his dwelling, where he waited on us with\r\n  due politeness, in handing water; from the evident air of comfort\r\n  around, I was certain that “Aristus would not be so amiable, were it\r\n  not for his Aspasia; nor Aspasia so much esteemed were it not for her\r\n  Aristus”; yet distress sits over those unaspiring seats. Count F——,\r\n  the proprietor, a French nobleman, resides in France, and he is not at\r\n  present liberally disposed. The provision grounds are in the\r\n  mountains, and the watchmen being removed, cattle and thieves destroy\r\n  the fruits of their exertions; so that instead of having provisions to\r\n  sell, they suffer scarcity themselves, only being allowed one pound of\r\n  salt fish per week; in crop time they are defrauded and overworked,\r\n  and these teasing impositions, which are beneath a proprietor’s\r\n  dignity, destroy their peace.\r\n\r\nOn =Lyssons= estate, named after Nicholas Lycence, member for St. Thomas\r\nin 1671–72, by the works, are the remains of an old windmill with the\r\ndate 1764.\r\n\r\nHere is the tomb to Sir John Taylor, Bt., and Simon Taylor, to the north\r\nof the main road running through the property. It is in good condition.\r\nThe latter held many important posts and was a very wealthy planter,\r\nleaving behind him, it is said, the largest fortune ever accumulated by\r\na West Indian. Both Sir John and his brother Simon were originally\r\nburied at Vale Royal, in St. Andrew; but on the sale of that property\r\ntheir bodies were removed to Lyssons.\r\n\r\nThe following are the inscriptions:\r\n\r\n  [_On the South side_]\r\n\r\n  Here lie the Remains of—Sir John Taylor, of Lissons, Baronet,—Amiable\r\n  in His Manners, Steady in His Attachments—& Exemplary in the Practice\r\n  of the Social & Domestic Duties.—He died—during a visit to His Estates\r\n  in this Island,—May 6th, 1786,—Aged 41.\r\n\r\n  [_On the North side_]\r\n\r\n  Here lie the Remains of—the Honourable Simon Taylor,—A Loyal Subject,\r\n  A firm Friend, & an Honest man.—Who, after an active life,—During\r\n  which he faithfully & ably filled the highest Offices—of Civil &\r\n  Military Duty in this Island,—Died April 14th, 1813,—aged 73.\r\n\r\n  [_On the East side_]\r\n\r\n  To the Memory of—A beloved & Honoured—Father and Uncle.\r\n\r\n  This Monument was erected—By Sir Simon Richard Brissett\r\n  Taylor,—Baronet,—1814.\r\n\r\n  [_On the West side_]\r\n\r\n  _Arms_, Two escutcheons.\r\n\r\n  1. Argent, a saltire sable, between two human hearts, in pale gules, &\r\n  2 cinquefoils in fesse, vert. Baronet’s badge in the fesse point.\r\n  _Crest_, Out of a ducal coronet, a cubit arm holding a cross crosslet.\r\n\r\n  2. The same arms with supporters—Two leopards chained & collared.\r\n  _Motto_, “In hoc signo Vinces.”\r\n\r\nAll that is left of =Hordley= are the remains of the works and\r\noverseer’s house. Of the great house, two miles away at an elevation of\r\n700 feet, there is now nothing left.\r\n\r\nWhile on his second visit to Jamaica, in 1818, Monk Lewis paid a flying\r\nvisit to this estate.\r\n\r\n  Here (he said) I expected to find a perfect paradise, and I found a\r\n  perfect hell. Report had assured me that Hordley was the best managed\r\n  estate in the island; and, as far as the soil was concerned, report\r\n  appeared to have said true: but my trustee had also assured me that my\r\n  negroes were the most contented and best-disposed, and here there was\r\n  a lamentable incorrectness in the account. I found them in a perfect\r\n  uproar; complaints of all kinds stunned me from all quarters: all the\r\n  blacks accused all the whites, and all the whites accused all the\r\n  blacks; and, as far as I could make out, both parties were extremely\r\n  in the right.\r\n\r\nIn the week at his disposal he was not able to effect much remedy. He\r\nfound his “trustee” not cruel, but merely indolent as to the fate of the\r\nnegroes; but he dismissed one of the book-keepers and the “chief black\r\ngovernor.” He gave the negroes new holdings, additional allowances of\r\nsalt fish and presents of money, &c., and “left them in as good humour,\r\napparently, as I found them in bad.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALBION ESTATE\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Albion= estate, on the right bank of the Yallahs just before it joins\r\nthe sea, is the estate whence the white Albion sugar well known in\r\nEngland takes its name. The old works and the coolie hospital, erected\r\nin the middle of the nineteenth century, and the old-time book-keeper’s\r\nhouse still exist; but the great house is now in ruins.\r\n\r\nDr. William Lloyd, in “Letters from the West Indies,” above quoted,\r\ngives the following account of =Golden Grove=:\r\n\r\n  The “great house” is at a little distance on rising ground, commanding\r\n  a _coup d’œil_ of the whole plain; hundreds and thousands of acres of\r\n  canes may be seen at one glance. A school house has been erected near,\r\n  and a pleasing young man sent out by the Church Missionary Society has\r\n  charge of it. We were pleased with the good order of the children;\r\n  many were absent; at present the measles prevail, which may be one\r\n  cause. During the day we visited a very celebrated estate, Golden\r\n  Grove; attorney, Thomas McCornock, Esq., custos of the parish,\r\n  answering to our Lord Lieutenant. The extent of this estate is two\r\n  thousand acres; apprentices five hundred; and it exports near six\r\n  hundred hogheads of sugar: “_communibus annis_.” All the arrangements,\r\n  buildings, machinery, et cet, are of a very superior description. A\r\n  very neat chapel with a tower and clock close to the principal\r\n  dwelling, was built by the tradesmen of the estate during the slave\r\n  regime; and such was the interest evinced by the slaves for religion,\r\n  that they subscribed twenty pounds to buy a communion service cup; it\r\n  has been appropriately engraved; much might be said on this\r\n  occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe plate mentioned is now preserved in the offices of the Church of\r\nEngland in Jamaica in Kingston. The chalice, eight inches high, is\r\ninscribed round the foot, “Purchased for Golden Grove Chapel by the\r\nslaves of the estate, 1830.”\r\n\r\nAt =Cambridge Hill= and at =Botany Bay= are caves in which Arawâk\r\nremains have been found.\r\n\r\n=Cow Bay= and =Bull Bay= recall the old days of the “cow killers” or\r\nbuccaneers; cow being by them applied to all kinds of horned cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n                                PORTLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of Portland was named after the Duke of Portland, who was\r\nGovernor of the colony at the date of its formation. It includes the old\r\nparish of St. George and part of St. Thomas, from which it was\r\noriginally taken in 1723. St. George derived its name from the patron\r\nsaint of England. Roby thinks that the name might have received\r\nadditional appropriateness from the fact that George was the Christian\r\nname of the Duke of Albemarle, Sir Thomas Modyford’s relative and\r\npatron; as also of Colonel Nedham, his son-in-law.\r\n\r\nPort Antonio, which was then established, has two of the finest and\r\nsecurest harbours in the island. It is divided into Upper and Lower\r\nTitchfield, named after the property of the Duke of Portland. Upper\r\nTitchfield stands on a peninsula and contains Fort George, the old\r\nmilitary barracks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1721, when strenuous efforts were made to induce immigrants\r\nfrom the British Isles to settle in the north-eastern part of the\r\nisland, the Governor was empowered to make grants in the king’s name:\r\n\r\nTo every white person, being a protestant, thirty acres; to every white\r\nperson in the family, thirty acres; to every free mulatto Indian or\r\nNegro, twenty acres; to every slave bought, five acres; with a proviso\r\nthat no person not having fifteen white persons in the family should\r\nhave above 400 acres in the whole. On the condition that the grantees\r\nshould settle and plant the land, or some part thereof, within six\r\nmonths from the date of the patent, and should not alienate the land for\r\nseven years from that date. Special facilities were given to intending\r\nsettlers: the lands were exonerated from all arrears of quit rent and\r\nall grants made without fee of office, and the settlers freed from all\r\ntaxes (general or parochial) (except quit rents) for seven years.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 the receiver-general was authorised to raise a sum of £1500, to\r\nbe applied: £1000 in purchasing lands, &c., provided by Act 9 Geo. 1, c.\r\n8, and to provide each newcomer (man or woman) that should come over and\r\nsettle within twelve months with two barrels of beef and one barrel of\r\nflour to be delivered at Port Antonio free of all charges as a means of\r\nsupport until the lands allotted to them should be planted with proper\r\nprovisions, and until the same were grown up and become fit for use—and\r\nalso to provide proper necessaries and conveniences for the newcomers\r\ntravelling to the land where they were to settle.\r\n\r\nTo encourage new settlers and on account of the distance from the\r\nsupreme court (then held in Spanish Town), persons settling were freed\r\nfrom all suits, actions and arrests, and public taxes, for three years.\r\n\r\nAll these Acts and the facilities and encouragements apparently proved\r\nineffectual to settle the parish, and in 1725 an Act was passed and the\r\nprivileges of the previous Acts extended to all inhabitants of the\r\nisland as well as newcomers.\r\n\r\nIn 1730, the Crown having purchased the remainder of Lynch’s Island, the\r\ntwenty acres originally allotted for a town and fortifications were\r\nvested in the Crown as they were found necessary for building wharves\r\nand stores and for careening men-of-war.\r\n\r\nIn 1733 an Act was passed for cutting a road from the breastwork,\r\nbuilding a defensible house, and prohibiting the sale of rum in\r\nTitchfield. Breastwork (about one and a half miles from Port Antonio) is\r\nstill a local name on the Golden Vale road.\r\n\r\nIn 1743 settlers in Portland were granted the same privileges as persons\r\nsettling at Manchioneal and Norman’s Valley in St. Thomas-in-the-East,\r\nby Act 9 Geo. 2, that is; their passages were paid and that of their\r\nslaves not exceeding twenty, and the receiver-general was to subsist\r\nthem and their slaves for twelve months on the following scale: each\r\nwhite person, four barrels of beef and 400 lb. of biscuit or bread; each\r\nslave a barrel of herrings and 400 lb. of biscuit or bread—the number of\r\nslaves not exceeding twenty. Every settler was entitled to a grant of\r\nland: for himself, thirty acres; for his wife, fifty acres; for each\r\nchild, twenty acres; for every other white, fifteen acres; for each\r\nslave, ten acres; not to exceed in the whole 300 acres. He was exempted\r\nfrom taxes for five years, but had to commence settlement within three\r\nmonths from the date of his patent.\r\n\r\nThis Act was limited in its duration, and subsequently expired.\r\n\r\nLong tells us that under the inducements of the laws passed between 1736\r\nand 1752, in sixteen years, one hundred and eight families and fifteen\r\nartificers were introduced into Portland and elsewhere at an expense of\r\n£17,898, but that many of them failed for lack of capital.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 all the restrictions, conditions, penalties and forfeitures\r\nimposed on settlers by the several Acts from 1721 to 1776 having failed\r\nof their end, these Acts were repealed, and lands were to be held free\r\nfrom such restrictions, &c., and thereafter grants were to be made free\r\ntherefrom—with a proviso excepting persons who had within four years\r\nbefore evaded the condition of their grants.\r\n\r\nFrom this date legislation with a view to settle the parish appears to\r\nhave been discontinued, as no more Acts with that object are to be found\r\nin the statute book.\r\n\r\nIn 1722 it was enacted that fifty acres at a certain place named\r\nPattison’s Point and thirty acres on Ruther’s or Lynch’s Island should\r\nbe allotted for a town, and that two hundred and fifty acres adjoining\r\nshould be a common belonging to the said town or towns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PORT ANTONIO IN 1770\r\n\r\n  From an engraving\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy an Act of 1725 (an explanatory Act for the further encouraging the\r\nsettling the parish of Portland) it was enacted that for enlarging the\r\nsaid town of Titchfield which had sprung up, fifty more acres should be\r\nadded to the town and one hundred acres should be added to the common.\r\nBy 1785 it appeared that divers people unlawfully encroached on the\r\ncommon of 350 acres, and the land had become of little or no use or\r\nprofit to the town and the benefit was in danger of being entirely lost\r\nto them. Certain trustees were appointed by act 26 Geo. 3, c. 7 (an Act\r\nfor vesting the common lands of the town of Titchfield in the parish of\r\nPortland, in trustees, for the purpose of raising a fund for erecting\r\nand maintaining a free school in the said town; and for other purposes\r\ntherein mentioned), for the direction and management of a free school to\r\nbe erected in or near the town of Titchfield, to be maintained and\r\nendowed from the proceeds of the 350 acres of common land. The object of\r\nthe trust was to provide instruction for youths, without charge to their\r\nparents, in reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, mathematics,\r\n&c., and the masters were to be of the Church of England. The school was\r\nopen to children of the island generally, but those of the inhabitants\r\nof the town of Titchfield were to have the preference.\r\n\r\nThe school was in active operation from its foundation to the year 1855,\r\nwhen it appears to have been closed in consequence of a report made on\r\nits “state and condition” by Henry Laidlaw, stipendiary magistrate, in\r\npursuance of a commission entrusted to him by the Governor, and because\r\nof the trust having been thrown into Chancery by reason of having\r\nincurred debts amounting to nearly £300, for which judgment was obtained\r\nagainst the trustees in the Grand Court of October 1852, in the case of\r\n“Anderson Charles _vs._ the Trustees of the Titchfield Free School\r\nTrust.”\r\n\r\nFrom the revelations laid bare in Laidlaw’s report, and from the tenor\r\nof a resolution passed at a meeting of the trustees held on January 3,\r\n1853, it may be gathered that the trust at this time was in a very bad\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 a scheme was drawn up by the Jamaica Schools Commission, by\r\nwhich the management of the trust was vested in the Schools Commission\r\nand a board of local managers appointed by the Governor on the\r\nrecommendation of the Schools Commission, and in 1903 the Titchfield\r\nlands were vested in trustees appointed by the Governor.\r\n\r\n=Olivier Park= in Port Antonio was named after Sir Sydney Olivier, when\r\nhe was Colonial Secretary; =Carder Park= after a benefactor to the town.\r\n\r\nThe fruit trade, which was opened up in Portland in the year 1868, has\r\nmade Port Antonio a town of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThe Maroon settlement, called =Moore Town=, named after Henry Moore,\r\nGovernor in 1760–62, is nine miles from Port Antonio on the banks of the\r\nRio Grande.\r\n\r\nThere are at =Low Layton=, 150 feet above sea level, the remains of an\r\nextinct volcano.\r\n\r\nManchioneal was the scene of some of the exploits of “Tom Cringle,”\r\nrecorded in his Log; and the great house on =Muirton= is said to be the\r\none to which he was taken on his arrival from Cuba with yellow fever.\r\n\r\n=Darlingford=, an extensive coco-nut plantation belonging to the heirs\r\nof Sir Charles Darling, a former Governor of Jamaica, stands around the\r\nvillage of Manchioneal.\r\n\r\nAt =Spring Garden= is a ruined fort, said to have been erected against\r\nthe buccaneers. Sir Thomas Modyford, Governor from 1664 to 1670, is\r\nprobably commemorated in =Modyford’s Gully= at Dry River in St. George.\r\n=Balcarres Hill= is perhaps named after Alexander, Earl of Balcarres,\r\nGovernor in 1795–1801, but Crawford Town was so called before the Earl\r\nof Balcarres came to the Island. =Seaman’s Valley= is said to have\r\nderived its name from the destruction of a party of seamen by the\r\nMaroons.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the portion of the original parish of St. George to the west of\r\nthe little Spanish River, together with part of the eastern portion of\r\nSt. Mary, was taken to constitute the separate parish of Metcalfe. On\r\nthe reduction of the number of parishes in 1867 this parish of Metcalfe\r\nfell to St. Mary, and the parish of St. George as reduced in 1842 fell\r\nto Portland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n                                ST. MARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Mary was probably so called from the port, Puerto\r\nSanta Maria, thus named by the Spaniards, now known as Port Maria: but\r\nRoby points out that Modyford’s daughter’s name was Mary, and it was\r\nimmediately next to the parish of St. George, the name of her husband\r\nbeing, as we have seen, George Nedham. It includes the former parish of\r\nMetcalfe, as well as a part of the old parish of St. George.\r\n\r\nAt =Gray’s Inn=, near Annotto Bay, are to be found remains of an old\r\nSpanish house, one of the few left in the island. The Maroon Town of\r\n=Scott’s Hall= is situated behind Castleton Gardens on the Junction\r\nroad, from Kingston to Annotto Bay.\r\n\r\nThe account of the defeat of Sasi by Doyley at Rio Nuevo, now on Spring\r\nValley, will best be told in the account of St. Ann amongst Doyley’s\r\nother operations.\r\n\r\nAt =Decoy= on the borders of St. Catherine is the tomb of Sir Charles\r\nPrice, Bart., called the Patriot, for many years speaker of the\r\nAssembly. The property has now been divided up. The tomb is illustrated\r\nin Hakewill’s “Picturesque Tour of Jamaica.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the lengthy inscriptions.

Having finished\r\n  his Classical Education in some of the best private schools in\r\n  England, his academical at Trinity Colledge in the University of\r\n  Oxford and taken the tour of Europe he returned to this his Native\r\n  Country in the month of January 1730.\r\n\r\n  On the 13th March 1732 he was elected a Member of the Honourable House\r\n  of Assembly, of which on the 18th March 1745 he was chosen Speaker.\r\n\r\n  On the 3rd of August 1748 the House came to the following Resolution:\r\n\r\n  Resolved Nemine Contradicente: That Charles Price Esq. have the thanks\r\n  of this House for his candid and impartial behaviour in the Service of\r\n  this Country as Speaker of the Assembly, and that as a farther\r\n  acknowledgement of his said Service:\r\n\r\n  Ordered:—That the Receiver-General do purchase a peice of Plate for\r\n  the said Speaker of the value of Two hundred Pistoles to be made in\r\n  such Form and Shape as the said Speaker shall direct.\r\n\r\n  December 19th 1760 the House came to another Resolution:\r\n\r\n  Resolved Nemine Contradicente: That Charles Price, Esqr. Speaker of\r\n  the Assembly hath supported that High Office with great Dignity,\r\n  Impartiality, and Integrity, and that the thanks of the House be, and\r\n  they are hereby given to the said Charles Price, Esqr. for his\r\n  faithful discharge of the High Office of Speaker, and as a further\r\n  Testimony of the Sense this House entertains of his Conduct in that\r\n  Office that a peice of Plate of the value of Two Hundred Pounds\r\n  sterling be presented to him.\r\n\r\n  Ordered:—That Robert Graham Esq. the Receiver-General, or the\r\n  Receiver-General for the time being do pay to the order of Charles\r\n  Price Esq. the sum of two hundred pounds sterling to be laid out in\r\n  the purchase of a Peice of Plate and that this or any future Assembly\r\n  will make the same good to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TOMB OF SIR CHARLES PRICE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  On the 11th day of October 1763 his seat was vacated at his own\r\n  request, and the House came to the following Resolution:\r\n\r\n  Resolved Nemine Contradicente: That the Thanks of this House be given\r\n  to the Honourable Charles Price Esqr. for his steady, faithful, and\r\n  impartial Discharge of the high and important Office of Speaker of the\r\n  Assembly for a long series of years, throughout the whole course of\r\n  which he distinguished himself in the most conspicuous manner, and\r\n  approved himself a dutiful and loyal subject to His Majesty and a true\r\n  lover of this Country by supporting on every Occasion the Honour and\r\n  Dignity of the Crown and the Rights and Privileges of the People, and\r\n  as a farther testimony of the high sense and approbation this House\r\n  entertains of his conduct in that Office and Services to the Public\r\n  that he be presented with a Peice of Plate of the value of five\r\n  hundred Pounds sterling.\r\n\r\n  Ordered:—That Malcolm Lang Esqr.

Charles\r\n  Price Esq. Speaker of the Honourable House of Assembly of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n                To dust and suffocating heats,\r\n                  Well pleas’d, we bade adue;\r\n                To taste your garden’s rural sweets,[9]\r\n                  And pay respects to you.\r\n\r\n                Peace to this calm, sequester’d seat,\r\n                  Where art and nature vie,\r\n                To decorate your lov’d retreat,\r\n                  And charm the mental eye.\r\n\r\n                But who its beauty can disclose,\r\n                  Who paint its gay array?\r\n                What friendly muse will interpose\r\n                  And aid an artless lay?\r\n\r\n\r\n                From this sweet spot; when æther’s clear,\r\n                  Rich culture breathing round,\r\n                “Cuba’s” blue distant hills appear,[10]\r\n                  The prospect’s utmost bound.\r\n\r\n                Whilst you such constant care employ,\r\n                  And genuine taste impart,\r\n                No wonder it should thus Decoy,\r\n                  And captivate the heart.\r\n\r\n                Yet, tho’ the scene does greatly please,\r\n                  You greater joy dispence,\r\n                Conversing with convivial ease,\r\n                  And solid, sterling sense.\r\n\r\n                Far from the world’s alluring ills\r\n                  And folly’s wide controul,\r\n                Here candid Contemplation fills\r\n                  And elevates your soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  This delightful spot, to which art and nature seemed to have\r\n  conspired, in imparting the brightest touches of beauty and sublimity\r\n  to the surrounding scenery, is situate in the higher part of the St.\r\n  Mary’s Mountains, and at present in possession of Henry Archbould,\r\n  Esq. It was denominated the “Decoy,” from the various attractions it\r\n  possessed, and the interest it maintained in the breast of its\r\n  numerous visitors. The garden is represented as the burial-place of\r\n  that respectable but unfortunate family the Prices.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  From its elevated situation, the island of Cuba is said to be\r\n  distinctly seen in a clear day; a prospect, however, commanded by many\r\n  other mountainous settlements on that side of the Island.\r\n\r\nIn the same magazine appears a poem by Sir Charles Price entitled\r\n“Resignation.” One of the twelve verses may suffice:\r\n\r\n               It was Heaven’s Almighty decree,\r\n                 You will say, then, why should I repine?\r\n               Tho’ in this we perhaps may agree,\r\n                 Have you ever felt anguish like mine.\r\n\r\nLong says of St. Mary: “The weather in this parish is extremely wet\r\nduring great parts of the year, and so cold, that few if any of the\r\nhouses are unfurnished with a chimney.” In writing of the Decoy he says:\r\n\r\n  One of the greatest curiosities in this parish is the Decoy, the seat\r\n  of Sir Charles Price, Bart. It is situated on part of the range of\r\n  mountains which border on St.-Thomas-in-the-Vale. The house is of\r\n  wood, but well finished, and has in front a very fine piece of water,\r\n  which in winter is commonly stocked with wild-duck and teal. Behind it\r\n  is a very elegant garden disposed in walks, which are shaded with the\r\n  cocoanut, cabbage and sand-box trees. The flower and kitchen garden\r\n  are filled with the most beautiful and useful variety which Europe, or\r\n  this climate produce. It is decorated, besides, with some pretty\r\n  buildings; of which the principal is an octagonal saloon, richly\r\n  ornamented on the inside with lustres, and mirrors empanneled. At the\r\n  termination of another walk is a grand triumphal arch, from which the\r\n  prospect extends over the fine cultivated vale of Bagnals quite to the\r\n  North-side sea. Clumps of graceful cabbage-trees are dispersed in\r\n  different parts, to enliven the scene, and thousands of plantane and\r\n  other fruit-trees occupy a vast tract, that environs this agreeable\r\n  retreat, not many years ago a gloomy wilderness.\r\n\r\nHe further tells us that Price constantly resided on this property, and\r\nin truly Jamaica old-time fashion kept open house: “Few gentlemen of\r\nrank, whether of the army or navy, on service here, quitted the island\r\nwithout having passed some of their time at the Decoy.”\r\n\r\nSir Charles Price, the first baronet, was a grandson of Francis Price, a\r\ncaptain in the army of Venables at the capture of the island, who\r\nmarried the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Rose, also one of the army. His\r\nson, Colonel Charles Price, who died in 1730 and lies buried, as we have\r\nseen, in the church of St. John, Guanaboa Vale, was the father of the\r\nfirst baronet. Sir Charles Price was a native of Jamaica, and “endued\r\nwith uncommon natural talents, which were improved by education, and\r\npolished by travel in the early part of his life”: these abilities and\r\nhis personal wealth gained for him considerable influence in the island.\r\nHe was member of the Assembly for St. Thomas-in-the-Vale 1732, for St.\r\nCatherine in 1752–66, and St. Mary 1756–61, and again for St. Catherine\r\nin 1766, was speaker in 1746, and from 1756 to 1763.\r\n\r\nHe was created a baronet, of Rose Hall, Jamaica, in 1768.\r\n\r\nHis son, Sir Charles Price, the second baronet, was member of the\r\nAssembly for St. Catherine in 1768, for St. Thomas-in-the-Vale in 1779\r\nand 1787. He was speaker in 1763 (when he succeeded his father in that\r\noffice), 1765, and 1770. In October 1775 he was expelled the house at\r\nhis own request, and left for England, intending never to return.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 as he was in financial difficulties the House advanced £5000 on\r\nmortgage of the Decoy, but in the following year a new Assembly voted\r\nthis transaction “unconstitutional and of dangerous example.” He died in\r\n1788 in Spanish Town without issue, and the title became extinct.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Price’s name was for many years associated with a particular\r\nspecies of rat—the largest in the island—known as the “cane-piece rat,”\r\nor the “Charles Price rat” on the assumption that it was introduced into\r\nJamaica by him; but Richard Hill, who investigated the matter for Gosse,\r\nand obtained the family tradition on the subject from George Price, of\r\nWorthy Park, a great-grandson of Sir Charles Price, came to the\r\nconclusion that the animal, which Price introduced from South America\r\nand in the eyes of the negroes had strong rat characteristics, was no\r\nrat. Several were set loose at the Decoy, and at Worthy Park, but they\r\ndid not survive. They may possibly have been a species of opossum, one\r\nexample of which recently came to Jamaica in a ship from Costa Rica. To\r\nshow what a curse rats were to the sugar planters, Beckford records that\r\n39,000 were caught in five or six months on one estate.\r\n\r\nAt =Agualta Vale= is the tomb of Thomas Hibbert (d. 1780), who came to\r\nJamaica in 1734.\r\n\r\nThe following is the inscription:\r\n\r\n  In a vault near this place lie deposited by his own direction the\r\n  remains of—Thomas Hibbert, Esq.,—late a Merchant in the Town of\r\n  Kingston—and proprietor of this and two adjoining Estates. He was the\r\n  eldest son of Robert and Mary Hibbert, of Manchester, in the county of\r\n  Lancaster, in the Kingdom of Great Britain—from whence he first\r\n  arrived in this Island in 1734—and after residing in it, with little\r\n  interruption, almost forty-six years—Died unmarried at this Estate, on\r\n  the 20th of May, 1780—in the 71st year of his age....\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, he built Headquarters House, Kingston. He purchased\r\nAgualta Vale, containing about 3000 acres, from the heir of one Bendish\r\nabout the year 1760. The sugar estate was settled in 1771.\r\n\r\n=Fort George=, near Annotto Bay, is now all that remains of the lands of\r\nthe Ellis family, which once owned numerous properties in the\r\nisland—Shettlewood Montpelier in St. James, Ellis Caymanas and Crawle\r\nPen in St. Catherine and Nutfield, Newry, Greencastle and Fort George in\r\nSt. Mary.\r\n\r\nThe statement often made that John Ellis, the first settler, was an\r\nofficer in Venables’ army is not borne out by the list of those\r\nofficers. He is recorded as a captain in 1685. He and his descendants\r\nsat in many Assemblies, and intermarried with the Nedhams, Beckfords,\r\nand Longs. Charles Rose Ellis was created Baron Seaford in 1826, and his\r\nson became Baron Howard de Walden in right of his mother.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ellis, the poet, and John Ellis, the naturalist and Agent in\r\nEngland for Dominica, were also members of this family, who have, from\r\ntime to time, done much for cattle breeding in Jamaica, having been\r\npioneers in importing valuable breeds from Cuba, India, Portugal, and\r\nItaly. To George Ellis, chief justice in 1736–39, Jamaica owes the\r\nintroduction of guinea grass—the seed having been brought from Guinea as\r\nfood for cage-birds.\r\n\r\nAt Fort George indigo was cultivated in the early days.\r\n\r\nAt =Dryland=, near Woodside, is an example of Arawâk rock-carving\r\n(illustrated in the “Journal of the Institute of Jamaica,” vol. ii, No.\r\n4). =Fort Haldane=, situated on a cliff above the coast on Gray’s\r\nCharity, a mile west of Port Maria, is named after General George\r\nHaldane, Governor in 1759. =Prospect=, near White River, is an old\r\nloopholed house, a good example of Jamaica architecture; and =Heywood\r\nHall= was the scene of a fight between Koromantyn slaves and the white\r\ninhabitants of St. Mary, who defeated them, in 1760.\r\n\r\nAs early as Slaney’s map of 1678 there was a =Christopher’s Cove= in St.\r\nMary in addition to Don Christopher’s Cove in St. Ann.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n                                ST. ANN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Ann is rich in associations with the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants, the Spaniards, and with the early history of the British\r\noccupation of the colony. It was in St. Ann that Columbus discovered\r\nJamaica; it was in St. Ann that he spent a twelvemonth while waiting for\r\nhelp from Hispaniola; it was in St. Ann, at Ocho Rios, that two\r\nengagements of note with the Spaniards were fought; it was from St. Ann\r\nthat the last remnants of the Spaniards left the island, while the last\r\nbattle of importance was fought at Rio Nuevo in St. Mary, but a few\r\nmiles across the border.\r\n\r\nA kitchen midden of peculiar interest was opened up in 1912, situated at\r\nthe top of the hill, some 980 feet high, on which stands the great house\r\nof =Liberty Hall=, commanding a view from Seville, the old Spanish\r\nsettlement, on the west, to Port Maria on the east, and overlooking the\r\nlittle creek to the east of St. Ann’s Bay, known as Don Christopher’s\r\nCove, where Columbus spent twelve weary months, from June 1503 to June\r\n1504. The thick foliage must in those days, however, have precluded any\r\nmore than mere peeps at that sea over which the dreaded Caribs might at\r\nany moment arrive.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the Liberty Hill Arawâks supplied Columbus\r\nand his companions with food while he lived on board ship in the creek\r\nsome three miles distant, into which the Spanish Lookout river runs,\r\nthrough land which afterwards became Drax Hall property and whence\r\nBeckford of “Vathek” fame later obtained much of the wealth he spent\r\nlavishly at his Gothic residence in Somerset. It is possible that some\r\nof the pottery recently dug up by the turn of the fork may have been\r\nused to cook this food, and it is conceivable that some of the vessels\r\nmay have been handled by the great discoverer himself.\r\n\r\nThe area of the midden or shell-mound is, roughly speaking, about half\r\nof an acre, consisting of the brow of the hill on which the great house\r\nstands. The richest collection of remains was found just outside the\r\ngarden gate on the carriage drive, where a few days before some pieces\r\nhad been unearthed in the preliminary work of grading the drive to\r\nfacilitate the turning of motor cars—a strange link between the old\r\nworld and the new. Investigation in the banana walk at the back of the\r\nhouse, and in the garden on the one side and the pastures on the other,\r\nyielded proof that the midden extended all round the brow of the hill,\r\nas was the usual custom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dry Harbour\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe remains resemble in the main the usual results of search in such\r\nmiddens—as described in Dr. Duerden’s “Aboriginal Indian Remains of\r\nJamaica” published by the Institute of Jamaica in 1897, and in Mr. T. De\r\nBooy’s more recent pamphlet, “Certain Kitchen-Middens in Jamaica”\r\n(1913)—land and marine shells, some pierced for the purpose of carrying\r\nthem, fish bones, coney bones, broken pottery, broken stone implements,\r\nflint flakes and chalcedony, from which their beads and other ornaments\r\nwere made. The Jamaica arawâk pottery, Professor Mason tells us, lies\r\nbetween the Porto Rican and that of Florida to Carolina. The pieces\r\nunearthed at Liberty Hill afford good examples of its decoration, in the\r\nhandles especially. One is distinctly fashioned like a parrot’s head.\r\nThe borders show the usual indentations made, before the pottery was\r\nbaked, by cross-hatching and otherwise. But one has a curious serrated\r\nedge not hitherto found in Jamaica. Examples of this collection are in\r\nthe museum of the Institute of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the nature of things only fragments of pottery were\r\nobtained, it is not difficult, in the light of previous experience, to\r\nreconstruct the bowls of which they formed part. Dr. Duerden mentions as\r\nthe greatest size hitherto found, a circular basin with a diameter of\r\nabout eighteen inches. That must have been approximated by one found at\r\nLiberty Hill. The bowls vary in thickness from three-sixteenths of an\r\ninch to half an inch, but pieces of flat cooking slabs were found as\r\nthick as one inch. The pottery on the whole seems better baked than that\r\nusually found.\r\n\r\nAdditional interest attaches to the Liberty Hill mound from the fact\r\nthat clay from which some of this pottery was made is to be found at\r\nLime Hall hard by, where there was in recent times a pottery in\r\noperation, and also from the fact that in the St. Ann’s Great River,\r\nwhich runs bordering the property to the east, are to be found stones\r\nfrom which aboriginal hatchets were made, and alongside a supply of\r\nsandstone which the Arawâks conceivably used for the shaping and\r\npolishing of their implements. A slab of stone was found on the midden\r\nitself, suggesting that perhaps Liberty Hill may have been the site of a\r\nfactory of both earthenware bowls and stone hatchets. But it would seem\r\nthat its greatest interest lies in its possible close association,\r\nduring a twelvemonth, with the life of the great Columbus.\r\n\r\nOther kitchen middens have been discovered at =Moneague=, on the hotel\r\ngrounds; at =Friendship=, near by; at =Belle Vue=, on the banks of the\r\nWhite River; at =Retreat=, at =Orange Valley=; and at =Cranbrook=.\r\nFurther investigations would doubtless reveal others.\r\n\r\nThere are Arawâk rock-carvings in a cave at Coventry.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 1492, Columbus, after encountering oppositions and\r\ndifficulties which would have deterred all but very resolute men, was\r\nthe first European to set foot in the New World—landing on that day at\r\nGuanahani (Watling Island) in the Bahamas. The important discovery of\r\nCuba and Hispaniola was made on his homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1494, while on his second voyage of discovery, he was the\r\nfirst European to land in Jamaica, running his lateen-rigged caravel,\r\nthe _Niña_, and her two consorts into =Dry Harbour= Bay on the north\r\nside of the island.\r\n\r\nOn April 24 he had left his new-founded city of Isabella in Hispaniola,\r\nand started on a further voyage of discovery. He sailed westward along\r\nthe north coast of Hispaniola, and, leaving the point we now call Cape\r\nSt. Nicholas, stood across to Cuba, and anchored in a harbour\r\n(Guantanamo), to which he gave the name of Puerto Grande. Leaving on May\r\n1, he coasted along the southern shores, admiring the beauty of the\r\nlandscape, noting the rivers, and receiving visits from numerous Indians\r\nin their canoes, with whom he exchanged beads and hawks’ bells for\r\ncassava bread, fish and fresh water. But soon, on the advice of his\r\nGuanahani guide (whom he had taken to Spain on returning from his first\r\nvoyage) he stood due south in order to visit a large island of which the\r\nnatives spoke. As he neared the island a number of carved and painted\r\ncanoes, one nearly ninety feet in length, crowded with Indians, came out\r\nto meet him a league’s length from the shore. After giving them\r\npresents, Columbus sailed on and dropped anchor in a place which he\r\nnamed Santa Gloria, on account of its extreme beauty. Passing the night\r\nthere he sailed westward to find a closed port in which he might careen\r\nand caulk up his vessels. About four leagues further on he found a very\r\nsingular port, to use the words of Bernaldez, or, as Fernando Colombo\r\ndescribes it, resembling a horseshoe in shape, which he named Puerto\r\nBueno. Here two canoes full of Indians met him, but after six or seven\r\nof the natives had been wounded by bolts from the Spaniards’ crossbows\r\nthey retreated.\r\n\r\nOn anchoring Columbus saw “so many Indians that the earth was covered\r\nwith them,” all painted, chiefly in black, wearing nothing but plumes on\r\ntheir heads and aprons of leaves round their waists. Wishing to assert\r\nhis authority and instil a fear for the arms of Castile into the hearts\r\nof the natives, Columbus, as the caravels could not reach the shore\r\nowing to the shallowness of the water, sent three boatloads of men, who,\r\naided by the pioneer of those hounds which afterwards did fearful\r\nexecution amongst the poor Indians, drove them off so that there was not\r\na man or woman left in the neighbourhood. On the following day six\r\nIndians came as ambassadors from the caciques or chiefs, begging\r\nColumbus not to go away; and later on the caciques themselves and many\r\nfollowers came and brought provisions, which probably consisted of\r\ncassava, arrowroot, guavas, naseberries, cocoa-plums and star-apples.\r\nDuring the time they were there the Spaniards had everything in\r\nabundance, and the Indians were very pleased with the objects (hawks’\r\nbells, beads and the like) which the admiral gave them. When the vessels\r\nhad been repaired and the crews were rested, Columbus left Puerto Bueno\r\nafter a three days’ stay, and skirted the northern shore, being visited\r\nfrom each village by canoes full of Indians, who exchanged native\r\nproducts for hawks’ bells and beads, till he came to Point Negril, which\r\nhe named “Cabo del Buen Tiempo.”\r\n\r\nOwing partly to contrary winds and partly to the impression that there\r\nwas “no gold in it, or any other metal, although the island was\r\notherwise a paradise and worth more than gold,” Columbus now left\r\nJamaica and returned to Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe historians of Jamaica and the West Indies generally have thrown but\r\nlittle light on the subject of the Jamaica landing. For a time the\r\nhonour was about equally divided between St. Ann’s Bay and Port Maria.\r\nSo far, however, as the somewhat scanty information warrants one in\r\ncoming to a conclusion, it may be assumed that Columbus’s Santa Gloria\r\nwas probably St. Ann’s Bay and that his Puerto Bueno was what is now\r\nknown as Dry Harbour, for it is said that he called the first port he\r\ntouched at Santa Gloria; that he stayed at Santa Gloria in 1504; that\r\nSevilla arose near Santa Gloria, and Sevilla, we are told, was near St.\r\nAnn’s Bay. The horseshoe shape of Puerto Bueno, as well as other\r\nevidence, points to Dry Harbour as the place of Columbus’s first landing\r\nin Jamaica. It may be mentioned that the identification of Puerto Bueno\r\nwith Dry Harbour was dealt with by the present writer at greater length\r\nthan is possible here in “The Story of the Life of Columbus and the\r\nDiscovery of Jamaica” (Kingston, 1894). There was a Fort Columbus at Dry\r\nHarbour in and about 1783.\r\n\r\nIt is not here necessary to follow Columbus in his further\r\nvoyaging—through “The Queen’s Garden,” as he named the islands off the\r\nsouthern coast of Cuba, back to Jamaica, where on the south side he had,\r\nas we have seen in the account of St. Catherine, an interview at Old\r\nHarbour with an important cacique, thence to Isabella, on the north\r\ncoast of Hispaniola, and so home. But Dry Harbour was once again visited\r\nby the admiral on his fourth and last voyage.\r\n\r\nOn his way back from the continent of America, which he saw for the last\r\ntime on May 1, 1503, while making for Hispaniola for succour, as his two\r\nworm-eaten caravels the _Capitana_ and the _Santiago de Palos_ were in\r\nno fit state to cross the Atlantic, after passing the Cayman Islands,\r\nwhich he named Las Tortugas, and encountering a storm at the west end of\r\nCuba, he ran for Jamaica and reached Dry Harbour on June 23, 1503; when,\r\nfinding no water there, he went on to Puerto Santa Gloria (St. Ann’s\r\nBay) and ran his caravels on the beach in a cove, possibly in that which\r\nis still called =Don Christopher’s Cove=. Why another cove in St. Mary\r\nreceived the same name is not evident.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to keep the ships afloat any longer he stranded them as\r\nbest he could, one near the other, and propped them up on both sides so\r\nthat they could not move.\r\n\r\nThe lower parts soon filled when pumping ceased, and cabins had to be\r\nbuilt on deck thatched with straw to supplement the accommodation now\r\nonly found in the cabins under the poops and forecastles. There, in the\r\nwords of Mendez, they were “not without considerable danger from the\r\nnatives, who were not yet subdued, and who might easily set fire to our\r\nhabitation in the night, in spite of the greatest watchfulness.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Don Christopher’s Cove\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe natives, however, soon showed that they were inclined to be\r\nfriendly, and Columbus endeavoured to see that nothing was done to abuse\r\ntheir confidence. They brought in provisions such as cassava, fish and\r\nbirds, which they willingly exchanged for cheap ornaments; and we are\r\ntold that Columbus’s youthful son, Fernando, took great interest in\r\nthese barterings, which were organised on a large scale by Diego Mendez,\r\nwho had ever been a good and faithful follower of the admiral.\r\n\r\nThe following is Mendez’s account[11] of what he did:\r\n\r\n  It was there that I gave out the last ration of biscuit and wine; I\r\n  then took a sword in my hand, three men only accompanying me, and\r\n  advanced into the island; for no one else dared go to seek food for\r\n  the Admiral and those who were with him. It pleased God that I found\r\n  some people who were very gentle and did us no harm, but received us\r\n  cheerfully, and gave us food with hearty goodwill. I then made a\r\n  stipulation with the Indians, who lived in a village called\r\n  Aguacadiba, and with their cacique, that they should make cassava\r\n  bread, and that they should hunt and fish to supply the Admiral every\r\n  day with a sufficient quantity of provisions, which they were to bring\r\n  to the ships, where I promised there should be a person ready to pay\r\n  them in blue beads, combs and knives, hawks’-bells and fish hooks, and\r\n  other such articles which we had with us for that purpose. With this\r\n  understanding, I dispatched one of the Spaniards, whom I brought with\r\n  me, to the Admiral, in order that he might send a person to pay for\r\n  the provisions, and secure their being sent. From thence I went to\r\n  another village, at three leagues distance from the former, and made a\r\n  similar agreement with the natives and their cacique, and dispatched\r\n  another Spaniard to the Admiral, begging him to send another person\r\n  with a similar object to this village. After this I went further on,\r\n  and came to a great cacique named Huareo, living in a place which is\r\n  now called Melilla, thirteen leagues from where the ships lay. I was\r\n  very well received by him; he gave me plenty to eat, and ordered all\r\n  his subjects to bring together in the course of three days a great\r\n  quantity of provisions, which they did, and laid them before him,\r\n  whereupon I paid him for them to his full satisfaction. I stipulated\r\n  with him that they should furnish a constant supply, and engaged that\r\n  there should be a person appointed to pay them. Having made this\r\n  arrangement, I sent the other Spaniard to the Admiral with the\r\n  provisions they had given me, and then begged the cacique to allow me\r\n  two Indians to go with me to the extremity of the island, one to carry\r\n  the hammock in which I slept, and the other carrying the food.\r\n\r\n  In this manner I journeyed eastward to the end of the island, and came\r\n  to a cacique who was named Ameyro, with whom I entered into close\r\n  friendship. I gave him my name and took his, which amongst these\r\n  people is regarded as a pledge of brotherly attachment. I bought of\r\n  him a very good canoe, and gave him in exchange an excellent brass\r\n  helmet that I carried in a bag, a frock, and one of the two shirts\r\n  that I had with me; I then put out to sea in this canoe, in search of\r\n  the place that I had left, the cacique having given me six Indians to\r\n  assist in guiding the canoe. When I reached the spot to which I had\r\n  dispatched the provisions, I found there the Spaniards whom the\r\n  Admiral had sent, and I loaded them with the victuals that I had\r\n  brought with me, and went myself to the Admiral who gave me a very\r\n  cordial reception. He was not satisfied with seeing and embracing me,\r\n  but asked me respecting everything that had occurred in the voyage,\r\n  and offered up thanks to God for having delivered me in safety from so\r\n  barbarous a people. The men rejoiced greatly at my arrival, for there\r\n  was not a loaf left in the ships when I returned to them with the\r\n  means of allaying their hunger; this and every day after that, the\r\n  Indians came to the ships loaded with provisions from the places where\r\n  I had made the agreements; so that there was enough for the two\r\n  hundred and thirty people who were with the Admiral.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Mendez wrote in 1536.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Mendez’s efforts, it was evident to Columbus that the\r\npresent state of affairs was highly unsatisfactory. Neither of the\r\ncaravels could be made fit for sea, and it became necessary to seek aid\r\nfrom Hispaniola. After a conversation with the admiral, and when no\r\nresponse had been made to an appeal for volunteers for such a risky\r\njourney, which appeal Columbus had made publicly at Mendez’s suggestion,\r\nMendez offered to go, saying:\r\n\r\n“I have but one life, and I am willing to sacrifice it in the service of\r\nyour lordship, and for the welfare of all those who are here with us;\r\nfor I trust in God, that in consideration of the motive which actuates\r\nme, he will give me deliverance, as he has done on many other\r\noccasions.”\r\n\r\nIt was decided that he should be accompanied by Bartolomé Fiesco, in a\r\nsecond canoe, who was to return and announce Mendez’s safe arrival in\r\nHispaniola, while the latter was to go on to Spain and let the\r\nsovereigns know of the results of the voyage, and for that purpose\r\nColumbus entrusted Mendez with a long letter descriptive of the voyage.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime hope of assistance deferred, their crowded quarters on\r\nshipboard, and want of occupation and exercise began to have their\r\neffects upon the health and spirits of the little settlement at Santa\r\nGloria. Discontent led to open rebellion. The brothers Porras (Francisco\r\nthe captain of the _Santiago_, and Diego the accountant) led the revolt,\r\nfollowed by Juan Sanchez, the pilot Ledesma, Barba the gunner, and some\r\nfifty others, who were moved to rebellion by Porras’s false\r\nrepresentations. On January 2, 1504, when Columbus was confined in bed\r\nby gout, Francisco de Porras burst into his small cabin and accused the\r\nadmiral of having no intention of returning to Spain. Remonstrances were\r\nuseless, and, to quote the “Historie”:\r\n\r\n“Porras replied, that it was not now time to talk, and that the Admiral\r\nmust either embark immediately or stay there by himself; and turning his\r\nback upon the Admiral he called out in a loud voice, ‘I am bound for\r\nSpain with those that are willing to follow me.’ On this all his\r\nfollowers who were present shouted out, ‘We will go with you! we will go\r\nwith you!’ and running about in great confusion crying, ‘Let them die!\r\nlet them die! For Spain! for Spain!’ while others called on the captain\r\nfor his orders, they took possession of the poop, forecastle, and round\r\ntops.\r\n\r\n“Though the Admiral was then so lame of the gout that he could not\r\nstand, he yet endeavoured to rise and come out upon deck on hearing this\r\nuproar; but two or three worthy persons, his attendants, laid hold upon\r\nhim and forcibly laid him again in bed, that the mutineers might not\r\nmurder him; they then ran to his brother, who was going out courageously\r\nwith a half-pike, and wresting it from his hands, they forced him into\r\nthe cabin beside the admiral, desiring Captain Porras to go where he\r\nliked, and not commit a crime for which they might all suffer; that he\r\nmight be satisfied in meeting no opposition to his going away, but if he\r\nkilled the Admiral he must lay his account with being severely punished\r\nfor what could not possibly be of the least benefit to his views.”\r\n\r\nThe rebels seized some stores and ten canoes which Columbus had\r\npurchased at Maima, a native village near where the caravels were\r\ngrounded, and which perhaps stood by Mammee Bay, and made several futile\r\nattempts to follow Mendez to Hispaniola; proving themselves such\r\nwretches, it is said, as to force into the sea when the waves ran high,\r\nin order to lighten the canoes, those poor Indians whom they had taken\r\nwith them to navigate their canoes.\r\n\r\nFoiled by their own cowardice and want of enterprise from leaving\r\nJamaica, they ran riot throughout the island, ill-treating the natives,\r\nand thereby upsetting the reputation for kindness and fair dealing which\r\nthe admiral had carefully been building up. The result was that the\r\nnatives, not able to distinguish between the followers of Columbus and\r\nhis renegades, began to change their regard for their visitors; the\r\nconsistent and steady labour necessary for the due supply of food also\r\nwas unusual and proved irksome to them, and the Spanish trinkets with\r\ntheir loss of novelty lost much of their value in their eyes. Supplies\r\ntherefore were not now forthcoming, and Columbus found himself and his\r\ncompanions, many of whom were with him owing rather to sickness than to\r\nloyalty, in danger of starvation. Once again his resourceful nature\r\nstood him in good stead, and he made use of an approaching eclipse to\r\nbring them to reason in the manner related by Mendez.\r\n\r\nBut Columbus’s troubles were by no means over. In March, just as\r\ndiscontent amongst his followers was again becoming formidable, a\r\ncaravel hove in sight, and all hearts were raised in thanksgiving in\r\nanticipation of being removed from their disagreeable position. Bitter\r\nmust have been the disappointment when, the ship anchoring outside the\r\nbay, a boat put off, and Escobar, the messenger sent by Ovanda, handed a\r\nletter to Columbus, with a present of a bottle of wine and a piece of\r\nbacon; and it was found that the letter contained merely condolences for\r\ntheir sufferings, and regret that no vessels could be spared for the\r\npurpose of bringing them from Jamaica. It was a sorry jest on Ovanda’s\r\npart, and there seems reason for believing that Escobar had been sent\r\nrather in the hope of finding that the admiral was dead, than to render\r\nsuccour. Still Columbus’s dignity and courage did not desert him. He\r\nsent an answer asking for assistance, consoling himself with the\r\nreflection that Mendez was safe, and that sooner or later succour would\r\ncome: and Escobar left that same night.\r\n\r\nAt this time Columbus endeavoured to pacify the rebel party by sending\r\nto tell them of the arrival of Escobar, giving them a piece of the bacon\r\nas token; and he offered, if they returned to obedience, to give them a\r\nfree pardon and a passage to Spain. Porras persuaded his followers to\r\ndecline this offer and to demand permission to reside where they liked\r\nin the island and a promise of half the room on ship board and half the\r\nstores when help should arrive. On being told that these demands would\r\nnot be complied with, they said they would take them by force.\r\n\r\nHearing that Porras and his mutineers were marching in open rebellion\r\nupon Maima, Columbus entrusted to the adelantado the task of pacifying\r\nthem or defying them. Bartolomé gathered together what men he could,\r\nabout fifty in all, and, after overtures had been rejected by Porras,\r\nwho calculated on his superior numbers to gain him an easy victory,\r\nprepared to receive attack on May 19. Porras and six others made a dead\r\nset at the adelantado, for they thought if they could kill him, the rest\r\nwould be easy. But the bold Bartolomé was not dismayed. His first three\r\nblows disposed of the powerful Sanchez the pilot, Barba the gunner, and\r\nLedesma, who, however, recovered from his wounds in spite of the fact\r\nthat he fell into a ravine and was not discovered till the next day.\r\nThen he received on his shield a fierce blow from Francisco de Porras,\r\nwho, his sword sticking in the shield, was overpowered and bound. His\r\nfollowers fled, and the formidable revolt was quelled by the courage and\r\nstrength of one man. The adelantado lost but one soldier. This miniature\r\nbattle had been witnessed by the natives drawn up in battle array, and\r\nafter the fight was over they marvelled to find that the strangers from\r\nthe skies were but mortal like themselves. Columbus, with his usual\r\nclemency, granted the pardon asked for by the rebels, and even spared\r\nthe lives of the two Porrases, whom he, however, kept in custody.\r\n\r\nAt last, about the end of June, the long looked for help arrived in the\r\nshape of two caravels, one sent by Mendez under the command of Diego\r\nSalcedo, and a second sent as an ostensible aid to Columbus by Ovando,\r\nwho, now that he found that the admiral could get assistance without\r\nhim, thought it well to take part in the relief.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 1504, after a sojourn of twelve months and four days in the\r\nisland, Columbus and his followers, accompanied by Salcedo, left\r\nJamaica, which could have had but unhappy memories for the great\r\nmariner.\r\n\r\nFour years later the town of =Sevilla Nueva=, later known as Sevilla\r\nd’Oro, was founded under the authority of the admiral’s son and\r\nsuccessor Diego, near the spot occupied by the wrecked caravels.\r\n\r\nSloane on his expedition to the north side visited Sevilla Nueva. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  I observed the ruins of the town called Sevilla, among which a church\r\n  built by Peter Martyr of Angleria, of a sort of freestone (to be had\r\n  near this city) and bricks. A pavement was found two miles from this\r\n  church; the city was so large it had a fortified castle, the walls of\r\n  pebbles and bricks, four feet thick; it was and is a good port....\r\n  This town is now Captain Hemmings’ plantation. The church was not\r\n  finished; it was thirty paces broad and thirty paces long. There were\r\n  two rows of pillars within; over the place where the altar was to be\r\n  were some carvings under the ends of the arches. It was built out of a\r\n  sort of stone between freestone and marble, taken out of a quarry\r\n  about a mile up in the hills; the houses and foundations stand for\r\n  several miles along. The ground towards the country is rising. Captain\r\n  Hemmings told me he sometimes found pavements under his canes, three\r\n  feet covered with earth, and several times wells, and sometimes\r\n  burialstones finely cut. There are the beginnings of a great house\r\n  called a monastery, but I suppose the house was designed for the\r\n  Governor. There were two coats-of-arms not set up—a ducal one, and\r\n  that of a count, I suppose belonging to Columbus’s family, the\r\n  proprietors of the island. There had been raised a tower, part brick\r\n  and part hewn stones, as also several battlements on it, and other\r\n  lower buildings not finished. At the church lie several arched stones\r\n  to complete it, which had never been put up, but lay among the canes.\r\n  The rows of pillars within were for the most part plain. In the time\r\n  of the Spaniards it was thought the Europeans had been cut off by the\r\n  Indians, and so the church left unfinished. When the English took the\r\n  island the ruins of this city were so overgrown with wood that they\r\n  were all turned black; nay, I saw a mammee, or bastard mammee tree\r\n  grow within the walls of the tower, so high that it must have been a\r\n  very large gun could kill a bird on the top of it, and most part of\r\n  the timber fell’d off this place, when it was planted, was sixty foot\r\n  or more long. A great many wells are on this ground.... The west gate\r\n  of the church was a very fine work, and stands very entire; it was\r\n  seven feet wide, and as high before the arch began. Over the door in\r\n  the middle was our Saviour’s head with a crown of thorns between two\r\n  angels; on the right side a small round figure of some saint with a\r\n  knife struck into his head; on the left a Virgin Mary or Madonna, her\r\n  arm tied in three places, Spanish fashion. Over the gate, under a coat\r\n  of arms, this inscription:—Petrus Martir ab Angleria Italvs Civis\r\n  Mediolanen. Prothon. Apos. hvivs Insulæ Abbas Senatus Indici\r\n  Consiliarivs Ligneam privs Ædem hanc bis Igne consvmptam Latericio et\r\n  Quadrato Lapide primus a Fundamentis Extruxit.\r\n\r\nThis Long thus translates:—\r\n\r\n  Peter Martir, of Anghiera, an Italian citizen of Milan, chief\r\n  missionary and abbot of this island, member of the Council of the\r\n  Indies, first raised from its foundation, with brick and square stone,\r\n  this edifice, which formerly was built of wood, and twice destroyed by\r\n  fire.\r\n\r\nThis Peter Martyr must not be confounded with his namesake, Pietro\r\nMartire Vermigli (1500–62), of Florence, who at Cranmer’s instance went\r\nto England, and for six years occupied a professor’s chair of theology\r\nat Oxford. Our Peter Martyr was Pietro Martire of Anghiera (1455–1526),\r\na native of Arona in Italy, apostolic protonotary, and a member of the\r\nCouncil of the Indies to Charles V. and first abbot of Jamaica. He was a\r\nprototype of the absentee proprietor; he never set foot in the island.\r\nHe is best known by his work entitled “De Orbe Novo,” commonly called\r\n“The Decades.” The “some saint with a knife struck into his head,”\r\nmentioned by Sloane, was the Dominican saint of the thirteenth century,\r\nwell known to students of mediæval Christian art, especially by reason\r\nof Titian’s world-famous painting of his martyrdom, and the saint after\r\nwhom the two sixteenth-century Peter Martyrs were named.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Long wrote (1774), nearly a century later than Sloane,\r\nseveral fragments of carved work in stone “that would be thought no mean\r\nornaments in an European church” were still to be seen there, and the\r\nruins of two edifices, one said to have been a castle and the other\r\nprobably the collegiate church, were still remaining, separated by about\r\nhalf a mile. The walls were compacted with a very hard cement, and were\r\nseveral feet in thickness. But he mentions that these walls were being\r\nevery day diminished for the sake of the materials, which were used in\r\nrepairing the buildings on the estate, so much so that the remains of\r\nthe castle were then below the surface of the earth. In 1764 he tells us\r\nthere were dug up two pilasters of about seven feet in length, “of no\r\nparticular order, but somewhat resembling the Ionic,” on which were\r\n“some carvings in alto-relievo.” Four or five coarse images were\r\nlikewise found, one of which resembled a sphinx, another an alligator,\r\nand the rest creatures of the mason’s fancy. Long says that the\r\nSpaniards abandoned Sevilla Nueva because the south side ports were more\r\nconvenient for the galleons and other vessels passing between St.\r\nDomingo and Cartagena.\r\n\r\nThe usual derivation of the name of =Ocho Rios=, one of the most\r\nbeautiful spots in the beautiful parish of St. Ann, as meaning eight\r\nrivers, is probably wrong. The word is most likely a corruption of\r\n_chorréra_, a spout, having reference to the waterfall near by. In\r\nLong’s time it was called Chareiras, and as late as 1841 William Rob\r\nwrote: “Ocho Rios called to this day by the old inhabitants ‘Cheireras,’\r\nits early and appropriate name, ‘the bay of waterfalls.’” It is\r\ninteresting to note that there is a Chorréra River in Cuba, near\r\nHavannah.\r\n\r\nIn 1657 a letter from Bayona, the governor of Cuba, to a certain Spanish\r\nserjeant-major in Jamaica, making arrangements for an attack on Jamaica\r\nto be aided by the whilom Spanish slaves in the island, was intercepted.\r\nImmediate steps were taken by the resourceful Doyley; and Arnoldo Sasi,\r\nthe Spanish governor, who having yielded up Jamaica to Penn and Venables\r\nhad re-landed on the north side from Cuba, was signally defeated by\r\nDoyley in person at Ocho Rios, whither he had sailed round from Passage\r\nFort.\r\n\r\nThe following is the account which Doyley himself gave to Cromwell in “A\r\nNarrative of the Great Success God hath been pleased to give his\r\nHighness Forces in Jamaica, against the King of Spain’s Forces.\r\nPublished by His Highness Special Command. London, 1658.”\r\n\r\n  Right Honourable,\r\n\r\n  Since my last to Your Honour, the First of _October last_, I have had\r\n  intelligence, that the Galleons with Plate, I then mentioned to be at\r\n  _Carthagena_ bound for_ Spain_, were cast away by a _Hirecane_; and an\r\n  evident token thereof, the _Burmudans_, our Informants, being in a\r\n  small Shallop, brought in hither about Twenty thousand pieces of\r\n  _Eight_, which they had taken in the Rack. And according to my former\r\n  to the Committee for _Jamaica_, having by a Prisoner notice, that\r\n  about Five hundred of the Enemy were landed here, and that the\r\n  Governour _Don Christopher Arnaldo Sasser_ [_sic_] was fortifying\r\n  himself at St. _Anne_ about Thirty-five miles from us, I was resolved\r\n  to give him time to fortifie so much, that he might think himself\r\n  secure enough to stand us (that we might not perpetually be put to the\r\n  toyl of hunting them in the Woods), and yet so that he might not be\r\n  able to give us any strong resistance: which accordingly being done, I\r\n  sent a Party of Stout, Well and Willing men, under the command of\r\n  Major _Richard Steevens_ to whom about Sixty of our Officers joyned,\r\n  Volunteers, exceedingly desirous of action (after so long a cessation)\r\n  who advanced to the place, very strongly situated on a Rock; as soon\r\n  as the Enemies Centinels discovered them, they threw down their Arms,\r\n  gave the Allarm to the Governour, who with the rest fled to the Woods,\r\n  leaving behinde them all their Arms and Ammunition; so, finding the\r\n  vanity of following them in the Woods and Mountains, we left them.\r\n\r\n  Before our Party came in, our Ships brought in a _Portugal_, running\r\n  into _Cuba_, who examined, told me that there were Five hundred landed\r\n  about the middle of _July_, that they had marched up the Countrey, and\r\n  finding the scarcity of provisions (contrary to what was told them)\r\n  were almost starved, had endeavoured to mutiny; and that about Three\r\n  hundred of them were by the _Spanish_ Commanders returned to a place\r\n  called the _Chareras_, in the _North_, over against _Cuba_, where they\r\n  first landed, where was their Magazine and Provisions, and more men\r\n  and Provisions dayly expected, where likewise they were fortified and\r\n  received their relief, which he had twice carried them.\r\n\r\n  Upon this intelligence, I met the Party coming home, and dismissing\r\n  about a hundred to their plantations (which wanted them) I shipped the\r\n  rest under the same command, on board the _Indian_, and went myself\r\n  with them for the better carrying on and expediting the business.\r\n\r\n  The 24 of _October_ we set sail from Cagway Point, and the thirty\r\n  stood over against the place. Early in the morning we spied a Sail\r\n  from _Cuba_ running into the place we were bound for, who had come\r\n  with relief, but told them he could not unlade himself because he saw\r\n  Ships at Sea. Our Party landed Six miles below the place intended,\r\n  there being no place nearer, and marcht on; who ere they had marched\r\n  Two miles, were saluted with a round Volley out of a wood, at which\r\n  ours, prepared for before by their Orders, never made stand, but fired\r\n  in boldly at the Ambuscade, in which the Enemy had Four wounded, we\r\n  One; the Captain with the rest made hast to their Fort, and ours so\r\n  fast after them, that onely the Captain and Four of the forty could\r\n  get in.\r\n\r\n  Our Party found them very well prepared with Matches lighted in the\r\n  Stockadoes (for that is the manner of their fortification, with great\r\n  Trees and Flankers) ours leaving a Third for a reserve, without any\r\n  gradual approaches, presently ran up to their Work, and with their\r\n  Musquets possest as much advantage, as the Enemy (the Work being not\r\n  at all Lined) between whom for the Space of near Three quarters of an\r\n  hour was a stiff dispute, till some of ours with the help of Hatchets\r\n  (which they were ordered to carry) made a Breach and entred; as soon\r\n  as the Enemy saw that, they betook themselves to run over the Rocks,\r\n  leaping into the Sea, and shifting for themselves (though the Officers\r\n  endeavoured to rally them) yet made not such hast, but that they left\r\n  One hundred and twenty, or thereabouts dead on the place, and many\r\n  wounded, amongst whom were most of the Officers; _the Mastre del Campe\r\n  Don Francis De Prencia_, by means of a Prisoner of ours, whom he kept\r\n  by him, got quarter, and some others whom we found in the Rocks whom\r\n  (though we had received barbarous usage from them) we could not kill\r\n  in cold blood.\r\n\r\n  We took here Thirty-three barrels of Powder, with Match and Bullet\r\n  proportionable, and good Store of Bread and Salt, and likewise their\r\n  Musters, their Commissaries book; which Powder, and what we took\r\n  before from the Governour, within less than Two Barrels did ballance\r\n  the Commissaries Accompt, so that they were wholly deprived of that.\r\n  And that which did more indear our Success; we had onely Four men\r\n  killed, and about Ten wounded, some whereof I have sent home, and\r\n  humbly and earnestly desire they may be provided for.\r\n\r\n  After I had refresht the men, I put them aboard again, and with small\r\n  Parties in several little Boats, Scoured all the Coast, and left them\r\n  that fled neither Boats nor time to get away; since which time some\r\n  are come in to us almost starved. The _Negroes_ formerly their Slaves,\r\n  using them roughly, and denying them Provisions, so that I saw a\r\n  Letter from _Don Francis de Liva_, the Deputy-Governor, to one of his\r\n  former Slaves, wofully bemoaning the condition of his Majesties\r\n  Infantry, and giving him the title of Worship at every word; to such a\r\n  necessity are they reduced, and we have not been idle to pursue them\r\n  in all quarters, though we now lie still for want of Shooes, if there\r\n  should any more of the Enemy come, which we have reason to expect; for\r\n  that I find by Letters, that the Governour of _Cuba_ _Don Peter de\r\n  Bayona_ being an old Souldier in _Italy_, doth not onely heartilie\r\n  solicite it, but makes a great benefit by it, having received money\r\n  from the _Vice Roy_, for the payment of Three Moneths to the\r\n  Souldiers, according to their Kings express command, whereof they\r\n  never received any; and since that, hath received Twenty thousand\r\n  pieces of _Eight_ from the _Vice Roy_ for levying more men. I shall\r\n  not fail in my endeavours to prepare for their coming, and doubt not,\r\n  but that the King of Spains lessening his Garrisons, may in time\r\n  produce good effect to our Nation.\r\n\r\n  I have sent the _Mastre del Campe_, the Colours, some Paper and\r\n  Letters; he is the onely man hereabouts, and hath chiefly advised in\r\n  this relief, and therefore I hope shall not be released till we are\r\n  better settled. I had almost forgot to acquaint your Honour that the\r\n  enemy at their first coming, sent a Lieutenant and two more, to\r\n  scatter Papers amongst our Souldiers signifying that who would come to\r\n  them, should have fair quarter and transport; who being met withall by\r\n  some of our Hunters, were all kil’d, and so that hopefull design of\r\n  theirs had no effect: And that the Governour of _Porto Rico_, having\r\n  set One hundred men to demand some _English_, living in new _Turtola_,\r\n  a Coloney of the _Dutch_, being refused to have them delivered up, was\r\n  in his return cast away by the _Hericane_, one onely _Mulatto_\r\n  escaped. The King of Spains Affairs do very much fail in these parts,\r\n  and his Trade is almost brought to nothing, by the many private Men of\r\n  War of _English_ and _French_ and ours are still abroad to annoy them.\r\n\r\n  All I have more is, onely to intreat your Honour, and all our Friends\r\n  with us, to magnifie the goodness of God, who hath given yett by his\r\n  glimmering, some hopes, that he altogether hath not forgotten us, but\r\n  doth, and will at length continue to own his Servants, who trust in\r\n  him, and to subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n                                                  Your most Obedient and\r\n                                                  Faithfull Servant,\r\n                                                  EDWARD DOYLEY.\r\n\r\n  _Cagway, Feb. 3, 1657._\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Doyley felt aggrieved at having been twice\r\nsuperseded by Cromwell in military command (by Sedgwick and by Brayne,\r\nboth avowed followers of Cromwell) and at not being appointed actual\r\ngovernor, and showed his resentment by asking to be allowed to return\r\nhome, he loyally did his best for the infant colony which fate had more\r\nthan once entrusted to his care; and it was owing to the wise and prompt\r\nmethods he pursued that the last serious attempt made by the Spaniards\r\nto retake Jamaica was frustrated.\r\n\r\nIn the May of 1658, Spanish reinforcements of troops from Spain,\r\nconsisting of thirty small companies making in all about one thousand\r\nmen, landed at the mouth of the =Rio Novo= in St. Mary, where they\r\nerected a fort of some strength on a rocky eminence near the sea and not\r\nfar from the west bank of the river.\r\n\r\nThe account of the occurrence given by Long, which is relied on by later\r\nhistorians, is taken from the letter which Doyley sent home; and it is\r\nbetter, therefore, to give the description in Doyley’s own words, which,\r\nthough not printed in the “Calendar of State Papers,” are given by\r\nThurloe:\r\n\r\n  Right Honourable,\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RIO NOVO\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The 8th of May last the Spaniards made good my intelligence to your\r\n  honour, by landing thirty captaines, thirty alferes, and thirty\r\n  companyes of foote, at a place called Rio Nova, in the north of this\r\n  island, who were there about 12 days, before they were discovered; at\r\n  which tyme our ships playing up and downe, saw three sayle of Spanish\r\n  in that bay, and made an attempt to have boarded them; but being\r\n  becalmed could not effect it. That night the Spaniards stole away, and\r\n  a ship came out to acquaint me therewith. I immediately called a\r\n  counsell of warr, as the affair did importune; and we debated, whether\r\n  it were most advantageous to assault them presently, or let them\r\n  partake of the distemper and want of the country; and when sickness\r\n  had weakened them, to attempt them then, though much might have beene\r\n  and was urged, how invaders were to be used with delayes, &c., the\r\n  exceeding desire of the officers and soldiers to be doing with them,\r\n  cut of all debates, and termed a sudden resolution to fall on them,\r\n  before they were fortified; so I comanded out 750 officers and\r\n  souldiers; and on the 11th of June last, wee set sayle from this\r\n  harbour towards them, and on the 22d in the morning wee attempted the\r\n  landing on a bay, which was defended by 2 companies and 2 captains\r\n  within half shott of their cannon playing from their fort. Our\r\n  forelorne went on with such gallantry, and kept into the water with so\r\n  much chearfullness, that perswaded the enemy they would not be denyed\r\n  entrance, and so they ranne, leaving one of their captaines and about\r\n  23 slaine; the other were took wounded, who dyed since. Then we made\r\n  all the hast, and in a hour landed our men, their cannon playing all\r\n  the while with little successe. That day we spent in playing upon\r\n  their fort from our ships, though the place being of so vast an\r\n  height, they could bear to doe them little harme. The next day\r\n  understanding their numbers to be more than ours, we were at a stand\r\n  how to attempt them, having fortified themselves and having 6 pieces\r\n  of ordnance, and a river to passe, the depth whereof we knew not.\r\n  Wherefore after our ladders were made, and other things fitted as well\r\n  as we could, in the evening I sent a drummer, partly to discover the\r\n  depth of the river he was to passe, with this summons:\r\n\r\n  Sir, being here with the forces of the mighty prince, the protector of\r\n  England and the dominions thereunto belonging, I doe, in his name and\r\n  for his use, require and summon you to deliver up the fort of Rio\r\n  Novo, with the ordnance and amunition therein; assuring you honourable\r\n  termes and transport to your country; which, if you shall refuse, I\r\n  shall be acquitted of the bloud shall be shed. I expect the returne of\r\n  my drummer in an hower, and am,\r\n\r\n                                           Your very humble servant,\r\n                                                                   E. D.\r\n\r\n  For Don Christopher Arnoldo Sasi,\r\n    Commander in chiefe of the Spanish Forces.\r\n\r\n  Who was very civilly treated; the generall gave him twenty-five pieces\r\n  of eight, and sent me a jarr of sweate meates, and this answere:\r\n\r\n  Lord generall don Christopher Arnoldo & Sasi, Governor for his\r\n  majestie the king of Spayne, my lord of the island of Jamaica,\r\n  answering to your letter, wherein you require me to deliver the fort\r\n  of Rio nova, and what else is therein, I say, that his majestie, whom\r\n  God preserve, hath appointed me for governor of this island, being his\r\n  owne property, and hath remitted me unto it a regiment of Spanish\r\n  infantry, and twenty foote companies to defend it. The forts and\r\n  castles of his majestie are not yielded with so much facility\r\n  hitherto. I have received noe batteries, nor have you made any\r\n  advance. I want noe powder, ball, provisions, nor gallant men, that\r\n  know how to dye before they be overcome. God keepe your honour many\r\n  years in those commands that you desire.\r\n\r\n                                           Don Christopher Sasi Arnoldo.\r\n\r\n  To the generall Mons. Doyley,\r\n    governor of the forces of England, these.\r\n\r\n  Wee made noe more demurrs, but resolved to march the morrow morning:\r\n  soe I ordered two of our vessels to set sayle leeward, to perswade\r\n  them. We intended to stand on that side of them; the other ships to\r\n  warpe as neere as they could, and play in them, while wee fell on the\r\n  other side. Wee marcht as so’on as it was light, haveing two arches to\r\n  goe being through a wood on the back side of them. About a quarter of\r\n  a mile from their fort wee mett a party on a worke on a high hill,\r\n  prepared to obstruct our goeing over the river, who onely gave us a\r\n  fruitless volley, rann to their fort, and told them all the world was\r\n  comeing. Wee clymed that hill with much adoe, refreshed our weariness\r\n  and advanced. When wee came in sight of their fort, we found, to our\r\n  exceeding joy, that the work on that side was not finished to that\r\n  height, as that to the leeward. Wee ordered our business with our\r\n  forlorne ladders and handgranades, and without any further dispute\r\n  received their shott, and rann up to their flankers, which in a\r\n  quarter of an hower wee gained. Many of them made shift to runn out of\r\n  the works, and ours followed their chase about three or four miles,\r\n  doeing execution. The seamen likewise seeing of them runn along the\r\n  rocks, came out with their boats, and killed many of them.\r\n\r\n  In this fort, wee took about ten double barrels of powder, shott great\r\n  store, six peices of ordnance, great store of provisions, wyne,\r\n  brandy, salt, oyle, and other provisions for eight months, as they\r\n  termed it. There was slayne about three hundred persons, diverse\r\n  captaines, two priests, and their serjeant-major, about one hundred\r\n  taken, and six captaines, which we have sent home; the king of Spayn’s\r\n  standard and ten collours. The rest, especially the strangers, that\r\n  are in the woods, must of necessity perish. Though this mercy was very\r\n  great, yet our joy had some abatement, by the losse of capt. Wiseman,\r\n  capt. Meers, capt. lieutenant Walker, capt. lieutenant Robinson, and\r\n  ensign Ferror, men for their gallantry rather to be admired than\r\n  comended, about some twenty-three private souldiers killed, and\r\n  thirty-fower wounded, whereof some are since dead; some other of our\r\n  officers slightly wounded with stones. Thus hath the Lord made knowne\r\n  his salvation. His righteousness hath He openly shewed in the sight of\r\n  the heathen. I have sent this short narration, because it comes by\r\n  colonell Barry, who was an eye witness, and principal actor herein,\r\n  and rest\r\n\r\n                                        Your honour’s faithful servant,\r\n                                                            EDW. DOYLEY.\r\n\r\n  Cagway in Jamaica the 12 July, 1658.\r\n\r\nTo the Colonel Barry, the first name mentioned in the list of Doyley’s\r\nfirst Council elected in 1661, reference has been made in the chapter\r\ndealing with Kingston.\r\n\r\nIn this action we can imagine that the soldiers played their part.\r\nWilliam Burough, the steward-general, wrote home on July 15, 1659: “The\r\nships in his Highness’s service here are the _Marston Moor_, _Grantham_,\r\n_Cagway_, _Blackmore_, _Hector_, _Pearl_ and _Dolphin_, with upwards of\r\n650 men all in good health. Three were slain in their late expedition to\r\nRio Novo. Their stay aboard was near six weeks, the soldiers about 700,\r\nwho made a great hole in the stores.”\r\n\r\nOn the 16th he wrote:\r\n\r\n  This comes by the _Martin_ to communicate our good news which he\r\n  desires may be kept from the press well knowing the Commander-in-Chief\r\n  sends a fuller account. Several letters of private persons here have\r\n  been inserted in the weekly prints “which is judged to be popularity\r\n  and a matter of great offence here.” Has seen a great deal of bloody\r\n  work in his time both by land and sea, but never saw any action\r\n  carried on with so much cheerfulness as this was, the\r\n  Commander-in-Chief, Colonel D’Oyley, telling the soldiers that a great\r\n  deal of England’s glory lay at stake, and therefore hoped they would\r\n  consider it and carry themselves accordingly, going himself from party\r\n  to party, and following the rear of the forlorn in a very signal\r\n  habit. His gallant behaviour was answered both by officers and\r\n  soldiers with a silent cheerful obedience, and through God’s gracious\r\n  goodness there was found such a joint unanimous willingness to the\r\n  work that the truth is it was of God and it hath exceedingly endeared\r\n  us one to another since we came here.\r\n\r\nDoyley evidently had difficulty in beating round Port Morant, for he\r\nmentions incidentally (on another occasion) that the Nevis settlers\r\nthere quartered 400 men for a week _en route_.\r\n\r\nAmong those who took part in the expedition was Captain Sibada, who had\r\njoined Penn’s fleet from Antigua, and acted as pilot of the flagship.\r\n\r\nThe army evidently had to do its work on short commons. Burough wrote\r\nhome in November: “Stores almost spent, occasioned by entertainment of\r\nsoldiers on board the fleets in two expeditions, one to Rio Nuevo with\r\n700 men, equal to the number of the fleet for six weeks, and 300 men in\r\nthe late expedition to find out the Spanish fleet, ten weeks. If they\r\nhad not pinched the army the fleet and garrison on the island must have\r\nbeen starved.”\r\n\r\nHickeringill tells us that Doyley at Rio Novo made amends for the loss\r\nof British honour at Hispaniola:\r\n\r\n  to whom our Nation in some measures stands indebted for the Reprizal\r\n  of the Honour at Rio Novo which was so shamefully Lost under the\r\n  Debauch’d conduct of General Venables in Hispaniola: the Spaniards\r\n  till then having so mean and despicable Thoughts of English Courage,\r\n  that upon the Onset at Rio Novo they upbraided our Men with the\r\n  opprobrious mention of Sancto Domingo, till the repeated Assay of\r\n  their Valour, disicplin’d them into better manners.\r\n\r\n  For though the number of the Spanish Forces at Rio Novo doubled the\r\n  English (being sent from Cuba to reinforce and settle the Island) and\r\n  those strongly Entrenched, yet such was the enraged earnestness of the\r\n  Soldiery to redeem their wounded Honours, that (regardless of all odds\r\n  and disadvantages) they storm’d them in their Trenches with a\r\n  resolution as undaunted as the success was prosperous. Hereby not only\r\n  retrieving the Prestine Fame of their Country-men; but also hitherto\r\n  frustrating all hopes in the Spaniards of further Attempts to regain\r\n  the Island.\r\n\r\nSir Hans Sloane, in his account of his visit to the north side of\r\nJamaica in 1688, says: “I went from St. _Anns_ towards St. _Georges_,\r\nwhere I crossed the river called _Rio Nuevo_. I saw the old _Spanish_\r\nFortifications, whither the Spaniards retreated and kept themselves till\r\nthey were carried to _Cuba_, where they, for the most part, settled\r\nabout a place called _St. Jago_. Colonel _Ballard_, who was present at\r\nthe taking of the Island, assured me that the _Spaniards_ (who inhabited\r\nthe Island to the number of Five thousand, with as many Blacks) retired\r\nto the North-side, where Seven hundred fortified themselves very well,\r\nbut were beat in their Forts by so many _English_. The Governour was an\r\nold decrepid Man, who was brought to them in an _Hamaca_, his name was\r\n_Don Juan Ramires de Arellano Cavalero del Habito de S. Jago_. They held\r\nit out in this North-side for some time.”\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1660, Long tells us, Doyley was informed by\r\nthe friendly negroes that his old opponent Sasi, unwilling to resign his\r\npretensions to the government so long as he could maintain the least\r\nparty or show of authority, was lying _perdu_ on the north side of the\r\nisland. Doyley ordered out a detachment under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Tyson, consisting of eighty officers and soldiers,\r\nand twenty-one of the revolted Spanish blacks; which, after a tedious\r\nmarch across the mountains, found Sasi in a swampy place, now part of\r\n=Shaw Park=, with one hundred and thirty-three men. Sasi himself was\r\nthen old and infirm, but his second in command was an experienced\r\nsoldier, who had served in Spain and had engaged in this new service in\r\nconsideration of double pay, and a promise of succeeding to the chief\r\ncommand after the governor’s death.\r\n\r\nThe English advanced upon them with intrepidity, and at the first onset\r\nthe Spanish lieutenant-general received a lance-wound, of which he died\r\nin two hours. On the loss of this able leader, upon whom all their hopes\r\nhad been fixed, the whole of the little army was panic-stricken. Sasi\r\nwas one of the first to retreat, and “ran so nimbly as to save himself\r\nfrom being taken.” Several, however, were made prisoners, and about\r\nfifty officers and soldiers slain on the part of the Spaniards, without\r\nany loss to the victorious side. The negroes were extremely active and\r\ndexterous in catching the fugitives. Long goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  The unfortunate old Governor, being now reduced to the last extremity,\r\n  and studious only for the preservation of life, sent commissioners to\r\n  treat on his behalf; and was permitted to retire to Cuba.\r\n\r\n  After this exploit the English proceeded to Chereiras Bay, where a\r\n  vessel lay at anchor, which the Spaniards had formerly taken and\r\n  employed to bring them monthly supplies of provision from Cuba, such\r\n  as cassada-bread, sweet-meats, chocolate and other conveniences. The\r\n  better to secure her from being surprised they kept several scouts at\r\n  some distance from the shore, to reconnoitre the country, and give the\r\n  alarm upon the approach of any enemy. Colonel Tyson had intelligence\r\n  of this caution; and disposing his men on different ambuscades, found\r\n  means to secure all the scouts one after another; after which he\r\n  concerted his measures so well as to make himself master of the\r\n  vessel, on board of which he found twenty officers and soldiers, who\r\n  were all taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n  The few remaining Spaniards who had eluded the search of the English\r\n  forces, embraced the first convenient opportunity of making their\r\n  escape from the Island, leaving about thirty of their negro slaves\r\n  behind, who secreted themselves in the mountains and afterwards\r\n  entered into alliance with other unsubdued banditti.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Tyson, who acquitted himself so nobly on this\r\noccasion, shortly afterwards gave occasion to Doyley to have him shot,\r\nas has been described in the chapter dealing with St. Catherine.\r\n\r\nIn his account Bridges says that “The British troops pursued him [Sasi]\r\nto a little bay about eight miles to the westward of the ruins of\r\nSeville; thence he escaped in a Canoe and ended his days in the bosom of\r\npeace and Christianity, by retiring to a monastery in Spain.” The spot\r\nfrom whence he embarked still retains the name of =Runaway Bay=.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Modyford’s “View” of 1664 there is no reference to St. Ann. It first\r\nappears in the same governor’s “Survey” of 1670; the other new parishes\r\nbeing St. George, St. Mary, St. Elizabeth and St. James.\r\n\r\nThe parish is said to have been named after Anne Hyde, wife of James\r\nDuke of York. If Roby is right in this, the correct spelling of the name\r\nof the parish would be St. Anne, as indeed Long and others spell it.\r\n\r\nNot more than a mile to the west of St. Ann’s Bay is the site of the\r\nfirst capital of the island, =Sevilla Nueva=, or “Sevilla d’Oro,” as it\r\nwas afterwards called. This town was founded by Juan d’Esquivel, the\r\nfirst Spanish governor of Jamaica, he having been commissioned and sent\r\nover by Diego Columbus (Christopher’s son), the hereditary viceroy of\r\nthe New World, to establish a colony there. Esquivel arrived in Jamaica\r\nin November 1509, accompanied by a number of the viceroy’s friends.\r\n“Bringing with them the refinements of taste and the means of displaying\r\nit, they assisted in the foundation of Sevilla Nueva, whose fame long\r\nattested its superiority over every other town which has since been\r\nbuilt here.” The town contained many buildings worthy of note, amongst\r\nwhich were a monastery, a cathedral, a theatre and many palaces. Sevilla\r\ndid not long, however, continue the capital, having been abandoned for\r\nSt. Jago de la Vega. The reason for the change is not quite agreed upon;\r\nsome say that it was owing to the Spanish inhabitants of Sevilla having\r\nin their wars with the natives been suddenly and entirely cut off, and\r\nothers assigned the desertion to “a visitation of innumerable ants” that\r\ndestroyed all the provision grounds of the people and compelled them to\r\nfind a home elsewhere. Bridges, however, attributes the abandonment to\r\nthe depredations of the French filibusters, and states that “the\r\nnorthern coast of Jamaica afforded frequent spoils to this bold band of\r\ncorsairs.”\r\n\r\nNo property in Jamaica has perhaps been handed down in the same family\r\nfor so many years as =Cardiff Hall=. The first Blagrove to settle in\r\nJamaica was a regicide. Land in St. Ann was early taken up—about 1665;\r\nand before the middle of the eighteenth century Cardiff Hall was a place\r\nof note. The earliest patent of land to a Blagrove of which a record has\r\nbeen discovered is to John Blagrove of 700 acres in St. James in 1689.\r\nOn Orange Valley, near to Cardiff Hall, in the possession of the same\r\nowner, are the remains of a so-called Spanish residence; and, going\r\nfurther back, on “big pasture” is a series of Arawâk kitchen-middens of\r\nthe usual type, from which a small modelled human head of greater\r\nnaturalistic treatment than is usually met with was excavated in April\r\n1914. Other middens are near this series, indicating a thick population\r\nin aboriginal times. It is conceivable that the residents were amongst\r\nthe first to welcome Columbus on his landing at Dry Harbour, a few miles\r\noff. The present building of Cardiff Hall, which possesses more\r\narchitectural features than most houses in the colony, of which the fine\r\nold mahogany staircase is not the least noticeable, probably dates from\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. It displays details of a\r\nRenaissance character, such as a line of columns in the entrance hall, a\r\nthree-light window in what was evidently the drawing room upstairs, and\r\nan ornamentation over the doorways dating from about the closing years\r\nof the century. The hospital and other buildings are also of a character\r\nsuperior to those usually met with. The first named has Corinthian\r\npilasters of considerable beauty. Guns, too, that formerly protected the\r\nproperty from buccaneers, are still _in situ_. In front of the house is\r\na vaulted chamber, half dug out of the rock, which is said to have been\r\ndesigned as a place of refuge in case of hurricane. It measures some 7\r\nfeet by 20 feet, and is 10 feet high, with walls some 2 feet thick. The\r\nhouse attracted the attention of Hakewill, who included it in his\r\n“Picturesque Tour” (1825), the drawings of which were made in 1820–1.\r\n\r\nJohn Blagrove, who was proprietor shortly before Hakewill visited the\r\nisland, was born at Cardiff Hall, but was sent, like the majority of\r\nplanters’ sons in those days, at an early age to England. He received\r\nhis education at Eton, and afterwards passed a considerable time in\r\ntravelling. On his return to Jamaica he occasionally took an active part\r\nin the discussions which occurred in the House of Assembly, to which he\r\nwas returned by his native parish, St. Ann, in 1787. The only member of\r\nthe family to sit in the Assembly before him was his father, Thomas\r\nBlagrove, who had represented Hanover in 1755. He (Thomas Blagrove) died\r\nin that year, when only 21 years of age, leaving a widow and one son. He\r\nwas buried at Maggotty.\r\n\r\nDuring the Maroon war John Blagrove was most actively engaged, and\r\nshared in its privations and dangers. He, Hakewill tells us, bestowed\r\nthe greatest attention to improvement of the breed of cattle on his\r\nseveral pens. He imported into the island some of the best-bred horses\r\nEngland ever produced, and his liberality and public spirit were\r\nrewarded by the high price which his stock, particularly his horses,\r\nalways commanded. He was a successful competitor on many occasions for\r\nthe cup given at the races held in the parish of St. Ann; in fact, his\r\nhorses for the most part beat the whole field. The Blagrove stables were\r\nsuccessful in other races as well. On the flat land by Runaway Bay the\r\nmemory of the old private racecourses on which the horses were trained\r\nis still preserved in the names of three pastures. In Palache’s “Jamaica\r\nStud Book” John Blagrove is recorded as having imported for racing\r\npurposes Lurcher, a bay colt, bred in 1789, and Buzzard, imported in\r\n1809. For many years previous to his decease John Blagrove was resident\r\nin England. He died at Great Abshot, near Titchfield, in Hampshire, in\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nAt this period, when the whole system of colonial slavery was being\r\nseverely criticized, Blagrove was always considered by his slaves as a\r\nmost kind and humane master. His will states:\r\n\r\n  And, lastly, to my loving people, denominated and recognized by Law\r\n  as, and being in fact my slaves in Jamaica, but more estimated and\r\n  considered by me and my family as tenants for life attached to the\r\n  soil, I bequeath a dollar for every man, woman and child, as a small\r\n  token of my regard for their faithful and affectionate service and\r\n  willing labours to myself and family, being reciprocally bound in one\r\n  general tie of master and servant in the prosperity of the land, from\r\n  which we draw our mutual comforts and subsistence in our several\r\n  relations (a tie and interest not practised on by the hired labourer\r\n  of the day in the United Kingdom), the contrary of which doctrine is\r\n  held only by the visionists of the puritanical order against the\r\n  common feeling of mankind.\r\n\r\nHenry John Blagrove sat for St. Ann for a short time in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. In the library of the Institute of Jamaica,\r\nwhich inherited the library of the House of Assembly, is a series of\r\ntwenty-five bound volumes of the “St. Jago de la Vega Gazette,” ranging\r\nfrom 1791 to 1840, “presented to the Library of the Hon. House of\r\nAssembly of Jamaica by Henry John Blagrove, Esq. Representative in\r\nAssembly for the Parish of St. Ann. 1851.” He soon afterwards left the\r\ncolony, never to return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARDIFF HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe view by Hakewill is “taken from the great interior road, and\r\nrepresents, seen through the pimento grove, the south or entrance front\r\nof the house. On the right is the barbecue or plaister floor, on which\r\nthe pimento is spread out to dry. The excellence of the house, the\r\ndelightful variety of the grounds and the contiguity of the sea, render\r\nCardiff Hall one of the most desirable residences in the island of\r\nJamaica.”\r\n\r\nA sketch of a photograph taken recently from the same point of view is\r\nshown on this page.\r\n\r\nNear the house is a private burial-ground with five tombs. Three are\r\nunnamed; of the other two one is inscribed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Here lyeth the body of Thomas Williams, Esqr., who departed this life\r\n  the 7th of June, 1746, aged 66 years.\r\n\r\n  Here lyeth the body of Mary Williams, who departed this life on April\r\n  14, 1753, aged....\r\n\r\nThe arms are those of the Williams of Herringstone, county Dorset.\r\nArgent a greyhound courant in fess between three Cornish choughs proper,\r\na border engrailed gules charged with crosses pattée or and bezants\r\nalternately. Crest, a man’s arm couped at the elbow, habited sable\r\ncharged with a cross pattée or the hand proper holding an oak branch\r\nvert, fructified gold. Neither the motto, _Nil Solidum_, nor the\r\ntinctures are given. The second tomb is inscribed:\r\n\r\n  In the memory of Peter Blagrove, Esq., son of John Blagrove, Esquire,\r\n  and Ann, his wife. Born at Cardiff Hall in this parish, 21st May,\r\n  1789, and died there 10th August, 1812.\r\n\r\nThe wife’s name was Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe following account of this Peter Blagrove is taken from the “Jamaica\r\nMagazine” for 1812.\r\n\r\n  At Orange-Valley Pen, in St. Arm’s, on the 9th inst., aged 24 years,\r\n  Peter Blagrove, Esq., third son of John Blagrove, of Cardiff Hall. In\r\n  spite of the best medical skill and experience, he fell on the eighth\r\n  day a victim to one of those insidious fevers so fatal to many young\r\n  men from Europe. Detained with an elder brother in France, which he\r\n  visited after the peace of 1802, for the purpose of gaining a\r\n  knowledge of mankind, he endured, for seven years, an exile from his\r\n  family and friends—which as it was inflicted on himself, and his\r\n  unoffending countrymen, during a profound peace, will continue to\r\n  stamp with infamy the despot and government that sanctioned it as long\r\n  as the laws of nature and nations shall be understood. Impelled by his\r\n  attachment to liberty and his country, he adopted the disguise of one\r\n  of the meanest of the French peasants to effect his escape; and with a\r\n  perseverance the most extraordinary, he encountered scenes and\r\n  hardships to which his earlier years were not accustomed. Unappalled\r\n  by the danger of the attempt such were the vigour of his mind and his\r\n  resources, amidst the hazard of hourly detection, that for many months\r\n  he eluded the vigilance of the most active police, employed by any\r\n  barbarian; and, having traversed the greater parts of France,\r\n  Switzerland and Germany he reached Trieste in safety, and soon after\r\n  repaired to his native country.\r\n\r\nAmongst evil-doers mentioned in Jamaica history, Lewis Hutchinson of\r\n=Edinburgh Castle= holds a high place. Some of the accounts of him are\r\nbased on that given by Bridges in his “Annals of Jamaica”; others, more\r\nfantastical, on the imagination of their writers. But the following\r\naccount taken down in 1897 by Miss A. E. Cork, from her great-aunt Miss\r\nPotenger, kindly contributed by the late Miss Robinson, of Trafalgar,\r\nSt. Ann, is based on better tradition, and is more likely to be correct.\r\nMiss Cork is great-great-granddaughter of Dr. Hutton, mentioned in the\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n“About the year 1768 there lived at Edinburgh Castle, in the Pedro\r\ndistrict of St. Ann, Jamaica, a desperado called Lewis Hutchinson. He\r\nowned the property on which he lived, and was said to have been a man of\r\nsome education, but he was the terror of the neighbourhood, and it was\r\nnot infrequent for a white man to disappear mysteriously, and it would\r\nthen be said that Hutchinson had made away with him by shooting him as\r\nhe passed the ‘Castle,’ which was furnished with loopholes and\r\noverlooked the road. But these stories were hard to verify, and such was\r\nthe unsettled and lawless state of the Island in those days that people\r\npreferred to leave Hutchinson alone, rather than attempt to have him\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n“A few miles from Edinburgh Castle was Hutton Bonvil, or Bonneville Pen,\r\nas it is now called, which, with Lebanon Pen, adjoining, belonged to Dr.\r\nJonathan Hutton, an Englishman. Dr. Hutton was a retired naval doctor,\r\nand also owned property in Lincolnshire, his native county. He spent his\r\ntime between England and Jamaica, sometimes remaining in the latter\r\nplace a year or two at a time.\r\n\r\n“During one of these visits he got into a dispute with the redoubtable\r\nHutchinson about a boundary-line between their properties, Hutchinson\r\nclaiming some portion of land which Dr. Hutton asserted was his own.\r\nThis caused great bitterness of feeling on Hutchinson’s part towards Dr.\r\nHutton; and one evening as the doctor, who was colonel of militia for\r\nthe parish of St. Ann, was riding home from muster at Moneague with his\r\nblack servant man following on foot, carrying his sabre and other\r\naccoutrements, Hutchinson overtook the man and took away the sabre from\r\nhim, saying, ‘You can give my compliments to Dr. Hutton and tell him I\r\nhave got his sabre.’ Dr. Hutton appeared to have taken no notice of\r\nthis. Some months later Dr. Hutton made arrangements to go to England.\r\nHis wife and one of his children—a little girl of about eight years of\r\nage—were in Jamaica with him, and Mrs. Hutton went to the adjoining\r\nparish of Clarendon on a visit, intending to meet her husband in\r\nKingston, and return with him to England. The little girl, Mary Hutton,\r\nwas left with her father at Bonneville; and Dr. Hutton set out one\r\nmorning on horseback on his journey to Kingston, little Mary being\r\ncarried by one of his servants in attendance before him on horseback.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Hutton intended to pursue the route now usually taken from Pedro\r\nthrough Moneague and St. Thomas-ye-Vale to Spanish Town, and on to\r\nKingston; with this exception that the public road from Pedro to\r\nMoneague in those days lay across the hill from Grier Park, where they\r\nwere met by Hutchinson and a following of his slaves. He rode up to Dr.\r\nHutton, who was unarmed, and attacked him fiercely, the weapon he used\r\nbeing Dr. Hutton’s own sabre which he had stolen. He struck the doctor\r\nsuch a severe blow on the head with this sabre that the latter fell\r\nsenseless from his horse. Hutchinson made off with his servants, and Dr.\r\nHutton’s terrified servants carried him back to Bonneville, where he\r\nstayed for a few days until he partially recovered, when, without\r\nventuring to travel by the same road he had at first intended to take,\r\nhis servants took him across the hills to join his wife in Clarendon and\r\nthey and their little girl went on to Kingston together. Dr. Hutton laid\r\ninformation there about Hutchinson; but as he was unable through the\r\ncruel blow he had received to remain in the Island to prosecute the\r\nmatter, no steps appeared to have been taken. Dr. Hutton proceeded to\r\nEngland still suffering much from the wound in his head, and when he got\r\nthere had to undergo the operation of trepanning, and wore a silver\r\nplate in his head until the day of his death. Dr. Hutton remained in\r\nEngland for about a year or more, and on his return to Jamaica tried to\r\nget Hutchinson arrested; but such was the terror he inspired, that the\r\ndoctor found it hard to get anyone to take the warrant. At last a white\r\nsoldier named Callender agreed to go, and with some others proceeded to\r\nEdinburgh Castle. As soon as Hutchinson found what was their errand, he\r\nfired at Callender and shot him dead on the spot. The others fled, and\r\nHutchinson was again left unmolested for a short while. But this crime\r\ncommitted before white witnesses could never be passed over, and a\r\nstrong body was sent to arrest him for the murder of Callender. He was\r\noverpowered and taken to Spanish Town jail. The castle was searched and\r\nforty-three watches were said to have been found there, besides\r\nquantities of clothing and many other articles, showing that Hutchinson\r\nhad committed most, if not all, of the murders with which he was\r\npopularly credited. His unfortunate slaves, to whom, as may be supposed,\r\nhe had been friendly, came now gladly and told all that they knew about\r\nhis proceedings, and showed what he used to do with the bodies of his\r\nvictims, which had hitherto been a puzzle.\r\n\r\n“Not far from Edinburgh Castle House, in a small wood, was a sink-hole\r\nwith a large mouth and supposed to be bottomless. To this sink-hole the\r\nbodies of Hutchinson’s victims were carried by the slaves on a plank in\r\nthe dead of night, and one edge being placed at the edge of the hole,\r\nthe other was raised and the body shot down never to be seen again by\r\nhuman eyes. Many of his victims were persons against whom he had no\r\ngrudge, and murder was evidently a mania with the wretched man.\r\nEdinburgh Castle overlooked the road, and it was Hutchinson’s playful\r\nlittle practice to stand at one of the loopholes and fire at any\r\nsolitary white traveller who might be passing. As he was a dead shot\r\nthey never lived to tell the tale. His negroes would then bring the body\r\nto the house, where after being rifled of whatever valuables might be on\r\nit, it was kept until night and then disposed of in the manner already\r\nstated. It was said by these slaves that once a young man—a stranger to\r\nhis reputation—being ill in the road, called up and asked for\r\nhospitality, which was at once accorded to him; Hutchinson showing him\r\nevery kindness and administering remedies kept him for some time until\r\nthe young man was able to proceed on his journey. Hutchinson then took\r\nhis station at his loophole, and as the young man turned into the road,\r\nshot him dead and disposed of his body as usual. Many such tales were\r\nrelated by the slaves, but a coloured person’s evidence was not admitted\r\nin those days; and so Hutchinson was tried, convicted and hanged for the\r\nmurder of Callender only.\r\n\r\n“This story of Hutchinson and his crimes and connections has been\r\nvariously told. In Mr. Bridges’ ‘Annals of Jamaica,’ another version\r\nwill be found. This was owing to Mr. Bridges having sent for an old\r\nBonneville slave and obtaining from him the story as it was current\r\namong slaves. But as I have told it, I think it is fairly correct,\r\nallowing for the lapse of years. The little Mary Hutton—who was an\r\neye-witness of Hutchinson’s attack on her father, married in England,\r\nand was Mrs. Potenger—lived afterwards at Bonneville for many years. One\r\nof her daughters was my grandmother, and from my late great-aunt, Miss\r\nElizabeth Potenger, another of her daughters, I have often heard the\r\nstory related to her by her mother.\r\n\r\n                              “ANNIE E. CORK.\r\n                              “Great-great-grand-daughter of Dr. Hutton.\r\n\r\n “_December 1897._”\r\n\r\nGeorge Wilson Bridges was rector of St. Ann from 1823 till 1837, when,\r\non losing four daughters by a boating accident in St. Ann’s Bay, he left\r\nJamaica never to return. In his story he appears to have confused\r\nCallender with Dr. Hutton, and makes him manager of a neighbouring\r\nproperty. The statement in the account given above, that Hutchinson was\r\n“overpowered and taken to Spanish Town jail” is incorrect. Hutchinson,\r\nwhen he saw that the authorities were determined to arrest him, escaped\r\nsouth to Old Harbour and put out to sea in an open boat, where he was\r\ncaptured by one of Rodney’s officers, acting under his directions. He\r\nwas hanged in Spanish Town on March 16, 1773.\r\n\r\nBridges states that Hutchinson left a hundred pounds to erect a monument\r\nto his memory, and that he (Bridges) saw the following autograph\r\nwriting:\r\n\r\n  Lewis Hutchinson—hanged in Spanish Town, Jamaica, on the sixteenth\r\n  morning of March, in the year of _his_ Lord one thousand seven hundred\r\n  and seventy-three.—Aged forty years.\r\n\r\n               Their sentence, pride, and malice, I defy;\r\n               Despise their power, and, like a Roman, die.\r\n\r\nOf his life little is known. In the St. Ann Vestry Records (February 5,\r\n1768) his name appears on the jury list for the parish. In 1771 he was\r\ncalled upon to supply slave labour for mending the road passing\r\nEdinburgh Castle to Pedro River. In 1773 the “Estate of Lewis\r\nHutchinson” was returned at twenty-four slaves and ninety-three head of\r\nstock; but it does not appear whether he had heirs or whether it went to\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, 1773, the House of Assembly resolved: “That the thanks of\r\nthe House be given to Sir George Brydges Rodney, baronet, rear-admiral\r\nof Great Britain, vice-admiral of the red, and commander-in-chief of His\r\nMajesty’s squadron on this station, for the essential service rendered\r\nto this Island by his ready and effectual assistance of the civil power,\r\nat the instance of his Majesty’s Attorney-General, in apprehending Lewis\r\nHutchinson, since executed for murder, and that Mr. Speaker do transmit\r\nthe same to the Admiral, in the most acceptable manner.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was further resolved: “That as a testimony of the approbation of\r\nthe House, respecting the behaviour of Mr. George Turnbull (an officer\r\nin his Majesty’s Navy, employed by the Admiral to take and secure the\r\nsaid Lewis Hutchinson), and of the spirit and address with which he\r\nexecuted that charge, the Receiver-General to pay to the said Mr. George\r\nTurnbull, or his order, the sum of £50 sterling, to be laid out in the\r\npurchase of a gold-hilted sword; and this or any future assembly will\r\nmake the same good; and that the admiral be desired to signify, to the\r\nproper department of state, the sense the House entertains of Mr.\r\nTurnbull’s merit on that occasion.” An account—basing his undoing on a\r\nquarrel with a neighbour named Callender over a jackass—is given in the\r\n“Columbian Magazine” for June 1797, published in Kingston.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Edinburgh Castle still stand on a rising piece of ground\r\nnear the main road, which it commands, running from St. Ann’s Bay to the\r\nsouth side of the island. It was a small two-storeyed rectangular\r\nbuilding with two loopholed towers, circular in plan, at diagonally\r\nopposite corners. A doorway was at one side of the front angle, and\r\nanother at the side to the east near the front tower. There are\r\nevidences of there having been a fireplace on each story of the front\r\ntower, and of a series of spiral steps in the back tower. The adjacent\r\nruins to the west are said to mark the site of the slave quarters.\r\n\r\nMr. R. F. Perkins, who went down the sink-hole some years ago, wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Sir Henry Blake with two or three others, I among the number, went down\r\nit. It is 265 feet deep from its edge to the point where a stone dropped\r\ndown would first strike, and it slopes down for another ten feet or so,\r\nwhere it stops. The ground around the top of the hole slopes rapidly\r\ndown to its edge, and the bottom is wider than the top; the sides of the\r\nhole are of nearly vertical rock.\r\n\r\n“All this refers to the hole known as ‘Hutchinson’s Hole,’ which local\r\ntradition connects with the murderer. Hundreds of people have visited\r\nthe place and rolled down stones, so it is possible that any remains\r\nmight well have been covered. We did not find a vestige of anything\r\nconnected with the atrocities. From more recent investigations I believe\r\nthat ‘Hutchinson’s Hole’ is not the hole at all. It is about a quarter\r\nof a mile away from the castle, to the south; and there is another far\r\nless formidable one quite close, that, I should not be surprised to\r\nfind, has some hidden entrance from the castle.”\r\n\r\nSir Henry Blake wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  I had, of course, heard the accounts of the various murders committed\r\n  by the notorious Hutchinson, and I determined to ascertain the depth\r\n  and details of the cave, which is in limestone formation, and to see\r\n  if any remains of bones, arms, &c., could be found.... On July 22,\r\n  1895, I was lowered to the bottom and examined the cave, or “Swallow\r\n  Hole,” carefully. The opening at the surface was 15 feet by 8 feet.\r\n  The cave was, in shape, somewhat like a champagne bottle, 270 feet\r\n  deep, and 70 feet by 50 feet at the bottom, which was formed by a\r\n  level mass of stones of all sizes. There were no bones to be seen; but\r\n  remembering the time that has elapsed since the notorious Hutchinson\r\n  held the country in terror, bones, if any, may well have been covered\r\n  to a considerable depth by the stones flung down by curious visitors,\r\n  and the stones and rubbish from the adjacent fields flung into the pit\r\n  by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe old tavern at =Moneague=, which was represented by Duperly in 1844,\r\nhas been succeeded by the Moneague hotel. A reference to the early\r\ntaverns of Jamaica will be found in the Introduction.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in the Introduction, in the eighteenth century there\r\nwere many forts around the coast of Jamaica, as protection against\r\nprivateers. St. Ann had her fair share of such forts, of which remains\r\nstill exist. There was one at =Mammee Bay=, two miles east of St. Ann’s\r\nBay, where the St. Ann volunteers repelled an attack by pirates in 1795;\r\nanother between Roaring River bridge and =Ocho Rios=, close to the main\r\nroad, dating from the eighteenth century; two at =St. Ann’s Bay=—one,\r\nerected in 1777, now used as a slaughter-house; =Windsor Fort=, erected\r\nin 1803; and Dry Harbour, existing in 1777. In 1737 an Act was passed to\r\nenable the inhabitants of the parish of St. Ann to build a barrack at or\r\nnear the head of the Rio Bueno, which divides the parish of St. Ann from\r\nthe parish of St. James. Other places of historic interest in the parish\r\nare: =Priory=, nine miles west of St. Ann’s Bay, where are the ruins of\r\nan old church, the oldest tomb being dated 1750; best known during the\r\nincumbency of Bridges the historian, who resided at one time at\r\n=Tydenham=, which was purchased by the vestry as a rectory in 1817. At\r\n=Dixon Pen=, in the Pedro district, there are remains of a very old\r\nbuilding said to have been the residence of a Spanish governor of the\r\nisland. At =Green Park=, near Claremont, is said to be the house\r\nmentioned in Scott’s “Cruise of the Midge.”\r\n\r\nAt =Geddes=, about five miles from Claremont, there is a curious slave\r\npunishment cell, with holes in one wall, through which it is possible\r\nthe hands of the prisoner were fastened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MONEAGUE TAVERN IN 1844\r\n\r\n  From a daguerreotype by Adolphe Duperley\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt =Rio Hoe=, properly Rio Hoja, two miles south-east from Moneague, was\r\nthe last settlement of the Spaniards prior to their departure from the\r\nIsland. At =York Castle=, in the Pedro district, was held from 1576 to\r\n1900 the Wesleyan High School for boys, which during that period\r\ncontributed eight of the Jamaica scholars. The =Dry Harbour Caves=, on\r\nHopewell and Cardiff Hall, are about a mile and a half from the village\r\nof Dry Harbour. They inspired a poem entitled, “The Grotto of\r\nMelancholy,” in “A Short Journey in the West Indies,” published in 1790.\r\n=Moseley Hall Cave=, on Guy’s Hill, on the border of St. Mary and St.\r\nAnn, has fine stalactites, which were much visited in former times.\r\n=Llandovery Falls= are natural waterfalls on the Llandovery; a view of\r\nthem is reproduced on one issue of the Jamaica penny postage stamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PUNISHMENT CELL, GEDDES\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Metcalfe Ville= is named after Sir Charles Metcalfe, mention of whom\r\nhas been made in the chapter on Kingston.\r\n\r\n=Walton=, near Moneague—where a lake appears at intervals after very\r\nheavy rains, is the site of an old military barracks, also the original\r\nsite of the Jamaica High School, now the Jamaica College at Hope, in St.\r\nAndrew. Here also is a lake which appears at intervals after very heavy\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nCharles Drax, by will dated 1721, directed\r\n\r\n  that a charity school should be established in the said parish of St.\r\n  Ann for maintaining and educating eight poor boys and four poor girls\r\n  belonging to the said parish as well as for other charitable purposes:\r\n  And, as an endowment to the said charity, the testator made subject\r\n  and liable all that his estate in the said parish of St. Ann, called\r\n  Shelton; and if that estate be found insufficient, his will was, that\r\n  all his, the testator’s, other estates should be made liable for the\r\n  deficiency.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report that William Beckford, the well-known author\r\nof “Vathek,” had obtained possession of Drax Hall, the principal\r\nproperty, in a manner “that excited the indignation of every honest man\r\nwho became acquainted with the transaction.”\r\n\r\nProtracted legal proceedings resulted in Beckford having to disgorge\r\n£5200. A free school, commenced by the vestry of St. Ann in the old\r\ncourt house in that parish in 1795, was in 1802 by an Act of the\r\nlegislature (43 George 3, c. 32) endowed with the sum obtained from the\r\nDrax bequest and called Drax’s Free School; and trustees, consisting of\r\nthe president of the Council, the speaker of the Assembly, and\r\nrepresentatives of St. Ann, were appointed. In 1806 the trustees of this\r\nschool purchased Walton, the buildings on which had originally been\r\nerected as barracks. In 1807 they expressed their willingness to\r\nsurrender their charge for the public good, and new trustees (embodying\r\nmany of the old members) were appointed (by 48 George 3, c. 25), and the\r\nname of the school was changed to the Jamaica Free School. At its\r\nformation the school was thrown open to the island, ten nominations to\r\nthe school being reserved for the parish of St. Ann in view of the\r\nbequest, and thirteen being for the other parishes on the nomination of\r\nthe Governor, this privilege being transferred by Sir John Peter Grant\r\nin later days to the custodes of the thirteen parishes; and on the\r\nschool being removed and merged into the Jamaica High School, which was\r\nopened in the newly constructed buildings at Hope in 1885, after a short\r\nsojourn in Barbican great house hard by, the same course was followed,\r\nthe thirteen open scholarships being awarded by the Jamaica Schools\r\nCommission, as the trustees and board of management of the College.\r\n\r\nThe old Jamaica Free School, like other schools in the island at that\r\nperiod, was somewhat overweighted by trustees, consisting as they did of\r\nthe Governor, the president and members of the Council, the speaker and\r\nmembers of the Assembly, the chief justice, the Attorney-general and\r\nothers. In the case of the Jamaica Free School their duties were not\r\nonerous. The law enforced their meeting only “once in every year, during\r\nthe annual session of the Legislature of this Island, in the town of\r\nSaint Jago de la Vega, for the purpose of examining into the state of\r\nthe said free-school, &c.”\r\n\r\nWhen Bridges wrote his Annals, he said of it:\r\n\r\n  The total income of the establishment is now about £1700 per annum,\r\n  which educates, maintains and clothes ten boys, nominated by the\r\n  parish, and six named by the Governor. In the session of 1825, a grant\r\n  of £1500 displayed the liberal desire of the public to extend the\r\n  means of instruction, and dissemination of Christianity, by the\r\n  addition of a chapel to the establishment. The master’s salary is\r\n  £300; and he is allowed to appoint an under-master with £150 per\r\n  annum. Under the management of the late master, the establishment rose\r\n  to be the first in the Island; public examinations took place twice a\r\n  year; and besides the objects of the foundation, thirty-one boys were\r\n  educated there at £70 per annum each. The present master is permitted\r\n  to hold the curacy of the parish; but the chapel being thirty miles\r\n  distant, he is under an engagement to the Trustees, not to quit the\r\n  school, but to pay half the salary of his cure to an officiating\r\n  curate.\r\n\r\n  It is a curious record, that the estate of Drax Hall still remains\r\n  charged with the sum of £500, payable to the same fund, whenever the\r\n  old Spanish Abbey at Seville d’Oro shall be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nIn the Wesleyan church, Brown’s Town, are two recently erected memorials\r\nto the Rev. W.C. Murray, D.D. (d. 1909), for fifty-one years a minister,\r\nand for eighteen years Governor of York Castle, which school, while it\r\nexisted, did much for secondary education in Jamaica—in the church a\r\nmural tablet, in the churchyard an obelisk of granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n                                TRELAWNY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of Trelawny derives its name from Sir William Trelawny, the\r\nGovernor, who died in Jamaica in 1772. It was taken out of part of St.\r\nJames in 1770.\r\n\r\n=Falmouth= was a town of considerable importance, and is more regularly\r\nlaid out than any other town in the island, except Kingston. The court\r\nhouse, a building erected in the days of Jamaica’s extravagance, is\r\nlofty and spacious and affords accommodation for nearly all the\r\nparochial officers. It contains full-length portraits of General Sir\r\nJohn Keane, lieutenant-governor from 1827 to 1829, and of Sir Charles\r\nTheophilus Metcalfe, Governor in 1839–42, the former being a replica of\r\nthe portrait by Sir Martin Archer Shee in the possession of the family.\r\nThe =Parish Church= contains monuments to John Hodges, who died in 1787,\r\nand James Blake (d. 1753), and to James Stewart (b. 1762, d. 1828),\r\ncustos of Trelawny, and member of the Assembly for the parish from 1794\r\nto 1822, and from 1826 till his death. The spacious Baptist chapel was\r\nerected under the auspices of William Knibb.\r\n\r\n=Martha Brae=, one and a half miles inland from Falmouth, is supposed by\r\nsome to have been the site of the old Spanish settlement of Melilla\r\n(which, however, was probably in St. James), which was abandoned soon\r\nafter its establishment owing to the depredations of the French\r\nfilibusters. “The secret gold mine” of the Spaniards is said to be in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Martha Brae. The origin of the name has puzzled\r\nantiquaries, but Mr. G. F. Judah a few years ago discovered it in Rio\r\nMatibereon recorded in a patent of the year 1674. In the map in “The\r\nLaws of Jamaica” of 1683 the Para Mater Tiberen Rio is marked where the\r\nMartha Brae now flows.\r\n\r\n=Bryan Castle=, where Bryan Edwards’s “History of the British West\r\nIndies” was written, was, together with the neighbouring estate of\r\nBrampton (now called Brampton Bryan), acquired by him from Zachary Bayly\r\nin or before 1792. It is within three miles of the port of Rio Bueno. It\r\nafterwards became by purchase the property of Alexander Donaldson, whose\r\nestate went into bankruptcy, and is now in the possession of the heirs\r\nof Mr. A. W. Gordon. A view of the great house is given in James\r\nHakewill’s “Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica” (London, 1825),\r\nthe most artistic work ever published on the island. In 1825 the\r\nproperty contained 1402 acres of land, 300 of which were in sugar-canes,\r\n600 in pasture and pimento, and the remainder was occupied by negroes\r\nand their provision grounds. The crops had then averaged during the\r\nprevious twelve years 300 hogsheads of sugar, with the usual proportion\r\nof rum, and, in good seasons, 300 bags of pimento. There were employed\r\n165 estate negroes, with the addition of extra labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BRYAN CASTLE\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe great house is a typical Jamaica house of the period, solidly built,\r\nbut without any pretensions to architectural beauty, and surrounded on\r\nall four sides by the usual verandah. When Hakewill wrote, Edwards’s\r\nbooks and furniture were still preserved in his study upstairs, where he\r\ncompiled his history. His writing-table is now all that remains. From\r\nthe only window of the room that was his study an extensive view is\r\nobtained across the Bryan Castle works and cane-fields in the\r\nforeground, and more cane-fields and woodlands in the distance, to the\r\nopen sea in the neighbourhood of Falmouth.\r\n\r\nBryan Edwards, the son of a gentleman of Westbury in Wiltshire, who\r\ntried not very successfully to add to his patrimony by dealing in corn\r\nand malt, was born at Westbury in 1743. On his father’s death in 1756,\r\nhis widowed mother, who had great difficulty in maintaining her six\r\nchildren, was taken under the protection of the elder of her two\r\nbrothers, Zachary Bayly, a liberal-minded man of considerable wealth,\r\ncustos of St. Mary and St. George, and a member of the Council, who had\r\ncome to Jamaica from Westbury. After acquiring some education and a love\r\nof letters at two schools in Bristol, and after spending a few months\r\nwith his younger uncle, Nathaniel Bayly, with whom he disagreed, young\r\nBryan was in 1759 sent out to his uncle, Zachary Bayly. The epitaph on\r\nthe monument of the uncle in Halfway-Tree church is from the pen of the\r\nnephew. In Jamaica Edwards resided under the care of his “great and good\r\nuncle,” continuing his studies under the Rev. Isaac Teale, who was\r\nspecially engaged by his uncle for this purpose—the T—— of Edwards’s\r\n“Poems.” They evidently lived on one of Zachary Bayly’s properties in\r\nSt. Mary, on the banks of the Agua Alta (Wag Water); and the chief\r\noutcome of the instruction seems to have been a love for literature, and\r\na propensity for writing poetry. In his “Elegy on the Death of a Friend”\r\nEdwards says:\r\n\r\n          Enamour’d echo bade each mountain hear,\r\n          And pleas’d Agualta smoother flow’d along.\r\n\r\n          Oft round thy banks, sweet stream (now sacred made)\r\n          Together we explor’d the classic page.\r\n\r\nTeale, who died in 1794, was at his own request buried on its banks.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, Edwards was left heir in tail male to his uncle’s properties,\r\nand four years later he acquired by bequest the great possessions of\r\nBenjamin Hume, of Jamaica, a friend of his uncle’s, and became a\r\nmerchant. Hume, it may be mentioned, had been removed from the post of\r\nreceiver-general on its being proved that he had embezzled upwards of\r\n£20,000 of public money. In 1765 Edwards had been elected a member of\r\nthe House of Assembly for the parish of St. George, now merged in\r\nPortland. In February 1770 he resigned his seat on the plea that his\r\nill-health necessitated a change of climate, but he apparently did not\r\nleave the island, and in December 1771 he was again elected for St.\r\nGeorge, but in 1772 he was called up to a seat in the Council. As a\r\nmember of the Assembly he attacked the restrictions placed by the\r\nBritish Government on trade between Jamaica and the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 he returned to England, where he tried, without success, to\r\nenter Parliament as member for Chichester against the Duke of Richmond’s\r\nnominee, losing by eight votes only. In 1787 he came out again to\r\nJamaica, and in the Assembly which first met in the October of that year\r\nhe sat as member for Trelawny. In 1788 he received in his place the\r\nunanimous thanks of the House for his reports on the slave trade.\r\n\r\nSoon after the revolt of the negroes in 1791 he paid a short visit to\r\nSan Domingo, in the welfare of which island he took a deep interest,\r\nendeavouring to obtain for it a loan from Jamaica. This was recommended\r\nby a Committee of the Assembly; but the matter met with public\r\nopposition, and the loan did not pass the House. In a long letter from\r\nhis pen which appeared in the “Royal Gazette,” April 21, 1792, he says:\r\n\r\n  For myself, I propose shortly to quit the island, and probably shall\r\n  never return to it; but my wishes for its happiness, freedom and\r\n  prosperity shall never be suppressed, so long as I have life and\r\n  recollection. I have exerted myself in its service for the last five\r\n  years with unabating zeal and perseverance, and, I hope, on some\r\n  occasions, with success.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 his seat in the Assembly was declared vacant, he having gone to\r\nEngland the previous year.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Assembly he was often called upon to assist in drawing up\r\naddresses and reports, and he now and then acted as chairman of\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nIn England he settled permanently at Southampton as a West Indian\r\nmerchant and banker. After contesting Southampton in vain in 1794, he\r\nwas in 1796 elected M.P. for Grampound. He supported the slave trade\r\nwith certain restrictions, and was admitted by Wilberforce to be a\r\npowerful opponent to abolition. He was, however, not unmindful of the\r\ngreat hardships done in Africa, and he had stated in Jamaica “that if\r\nall the nations of Europe would concur in a determination to relinquish\r\nthe slave trade altogether, it ought to be relinquished.”\r\n\r\nIn 1797 he succeeded Sir Joseph Banks as secretary of the Association\r\nfor promoting the discovery of the interior parts of Africa, and he\r\nedited some of Mungo Park’s contributions to its Proceedings. He died at\r\nhis residence in the Polygon at Southampton, in July 1800. He was buried\r\nin the catacombs of the church, but there is no recording tablet. His\r\nwife, whom he married in 1774, was Martha, daughter of Thomas Phipps, of\r\nWestbury. His vast wealth was inherited by his only surviving son,\r\nZachary Hume Edwards, who was not of age when his father died; but he\r\ndied on board the _Montague_ packet on his passage from Jamaica to\r\nEngland in 1812. An elder son had died at Winchester College in his\r\nseventeenth year, in 1794, of a “nervous malignant fever.”\r\n\r\nBryan Edwards’s elder brother, Nathaniel Bayly Edwards, died in 1771,\r\naged 19, and lies buried at Halfway Tree; his younger brother, Zachary\r\nBayly Edwards, of Dove Hall, Jamaica, was member of the Assembly for St.\r\nAndrew in 1785–90. He married Catherine, daughter of Rowland\r\nOtto-Baijer, of Antigua and Ffarleigh Castle, Somerset, England. Their\r\nson was Sir Bryan Edwards, chief justice of Jamaica from 1855 to 1869,\r\nand their daughter Eliza married her cousin Samuel Otto-Baijer, a member\r\nof the Council of Antigua. A genealogical table of the Edwards family\r\nwill be found in Mr. Oliver’s “History of the Island of Antigua.” What\r\nrelation to the historian the Bryan Edwards, special stipendiary\r\nmagistrate for the parish of Westmoreland, who died in 1835, aged 29,\r\nwas, it is difficult to say. He could not have been a son of his brother\r\nNathaniel Bayly Edwards (who died at Cheltenham in September 1800). He\r\nmay have been a son of his cousin William mentioned below. We know that\r\nthe historian was one of a family of six, and that he had two brothers;\r\nwhether the remaining two were brothers or sisters is not recorded; but\r\nit would seem from his will that he left but one brother, who only\r\nsurvived him two months.\r\n\r\nThat Bryan Edwards was, to some extent at all events, a patron of the\r\narts, is evident from the following extract from the second codicil to\r\nhis will:\r\n\r\n  I give and devise to my wife, Martha Edwards ... the full length\r\n  portrait of herself, drawn by Pine,[12] now in my drawing-room in\r\n  London, if she thinks proper to accept it. I give and devise to my\r\n  brother the portraits of my mother and brother, Nathaniel McHume; and\r\n  my own portrait now in London and any six other pictures in my\r\n  collection which he may make choice of.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Robert Edge Pine, the painter of the picture of Rodney in the\r\n  Institute of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nOne wonders whether the fact that Edwards had employed Pine to paint his\r\nwife’s portrait had any influence in the purchase by the people of\r\nKingston of that artist’s celebrated portrait of Rodney on board the\r\n_Formidable_.\r\n\r\nIn an obituary notice of him, a writer in the “Gentleman’s Magazine”\r\nsaid: “He exercised his literary talents in a memorable way in Jamaica;\r\nfor, by the strokes of his pen, he drove Peter Pindar from the Island,\r\nand the bitter satirist never dared to attack his character while he\r\nremained in this country.”\r\n\r\nThe first time Wolcot left Jamaica it was in order to take Holy Orders,\r\nso that he might be presented to a living in Jamaica by his kinsman the\r\ngovernor, Sir William Trelawny; the second time he left—never to\r\nreturn—it was to accompany Lady Trelawny, his patron’s widow, to whom he\r\nwas deeply attached. Moreover, Edwards never in his writings, at all\r\nevents, gave evidence of satire equal to Wolcot’s; and the latter, one\r\nwould think, was too pachydermatous to be driven anywhere by anybody\r\nagainst his will.\r\n\r\nFour later members of the Edwards family have also been famous. Sir\r\nBryan Edwards, chief justice of Jamaica, died in December 1876. Dr.\r\nWilliam Frédéric Edwards, who was born in Jamaica in 1776, was the son\r\nof a rich English planter—William Edwards by name (a cousin of\r\nBryan)—who afterwards settled at Bruges, where the younger William was\r\neducated. In early life he became a Frenchman, and won for himself much\r\nfame as a physiologist, dying at Versailles in 1842. William’s younger\r\nbrother, Henri Milne Edwards (born at Bruges in 1800 and died in 1885),\r\nthe zoologist, and Henri’s son, Alphonse Milne Edwards (born in Paris in\r\n1835 and died in 1900), successively held the post of professor of\r\nzoology at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 Bryan Edwards published in London, in two quarto volumes, “The\r\nHistory, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West\r\nIndies,” with plates and maps, which has remained the standard work on\r\nits subject—the history of the British West Indies till the close of the\r\nlast century—till to-day. A third volume was added in 1801.\r\n\r\nHe evidently took much pains to collect all the trustworthy information\r\navailable, especially about current affairs. But he wrote more as a\r\npolitician than as an historian, and the chief value of the work lies in\r\nthe large amount of light it throws on the condition of affairs in the\r\nWest Indies at his time. The arrangement, it must be admitted, leaves a\r\ngood deal to be desired; and it partakes rather of a collection of\r\nessays and articles than of a connected history, and is sadly in need of\r\nediting; but the nature of the subject makes it difficult to treat it as\r\na whole while at the same time going into details. Edwards himself only\r\nvisited San Domingo, and the information about the British islands other\r\nthan Jamaica is scanty. For instance, Barbados is dismissed in\r\nthirty-five pages.\r\n\r\nThe fifth edition was published in London in 1819, many years after the\r\nauthor’s death. It contains (as did the third and fourth editions) a\r\n“prefatory advertisement” by his friend and collaborator, Sir William\r\nYoung, Governor of Tobago, and a brief “sketch of the life of the\r\nauthor, written by himself a short time before his death.” It also\r\ncontains descriptions of colonies ceded after Edwards’s death, a\r\n“History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade,” and later particulars of\r\nthe West Indies generally, which would have been more useful had they\r\nbeen put in their several places in the work, instead of at the end.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Bryan Edwards’s publications:\r\n\r\n  1.

Small 4to.\r\n\r\nIn a copy of No. 12 from the library of Lord Sheffield is a note on the\r\ntitle page in Sheffield’s handwriting:\r\n\r\n  Is this the John Stevenson who is included in the list of persons\r\n  restored to grace and pardon within the State of New York by an Act of\r\n  that State passed 12th May, 1784?\r\n\r\nAt Rio Bueno is =Fort Dundas=, dated 1778 and taken over as an Island\r\nfort in 1800. At =Mayfield= are the tombs of John Spence (d. 1785) and\r\nAnne Blake, the wife of John Hodges (d. 1787); at =Roslyn Castle= tombs\r\nof Minto and Virgo; at =Golden Grove= that of Rebecca, wife of Colonel\r\nThomas Reid (d. 1747); at =Orange Valley= tombs of Mrs. Ann Jarrett (d.\r\n1769) and of William Rhodes James (d. 1795); at =Weston Favell=, the\r\ntomb of Thomas Harding (d. 1766). In the old slave village on =Hyde\r\nHall= Estate is the rare example of a monument erected to a slave, rare\r\nat least in Jamaica, though not so rare in the smaller islands. It is\r\ninscribed:—\r\n\r\n                              In memory of\r\n                                  Eve\r\n                        An honest, obedient and\r\n                  faithful Slave, by her affectionate\r\n                          and grateful master,\r\n                             Henry Shirley\r\n                                 1800.\r\n\r\nTradition has it that Eve was the woman in charge of the children of the\r\nslaves who went out to work during the day, and that she met her death\r\nby being drowned in a pond on Hyde Hall.\r\n\r\nArawâk kitchen middens are to be found at =Stewart Castle=, the locality\r\nbeing known as Indian Town to this day, and at _Wales_; while at\r\n=Pantrepant= are Arawâk rock-carvings. =Kettering= was named about 1840\r\nby the well-known Baptist missionary William Knibb after his birthplace\r\nin Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nJohn Kenyon, the poet and philanthropist (1784–1856), was born in\r\nTrelawny, where his father owned extensive sugar plantations. His mother\r\nwas a daughter of John Simpson of Bounty Hall in the same parish. Both\r\ndied while he was a boy at Fort Bristol School, Bristol. He it was who\r\nfirst introduced Browning to Elizabeth Barrett, a distant relative and\r\n_soi-disant_ cousin.\r\n\r\nTo Kenyon Browning dedicated his “Dramatic Romances and Lyrics”; and\r\nMrs. Browning dedicated to him “Aurora Leigh.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n                               ST. JAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. James, which was one of the second batch of parishes\r\nformed in Jamaica (the others in the batch being St. George, St. Mary,\r\nSt. Ann and St. Elizabeth), was so named by Sir Thomas Modyford in\r\n1664–65, probably after James, Duke of York; and he may at the same time\r\nhave intended, as Roby suggests, to perpetuate the memory of his\r\nbrother, Sir James Modyford. The parish of Hanover was made out of parts\r\nof Westmoreland and St. James in 1725–26, and Trelawny was made out of\r\nparts of St. Ann and St. James in 1770. In this parish is the site\r\n(probably at Spanish Quarters) of the first town built by the Spaniards\r\nin the island, Melilla; and from this parish, from Cabo del Buen Tempo,\r\nsailed with Columbus the first Jamaican who ever went to Europe—probably\r\nthe first willing emigrant from the New World to the Old. The origin of\r\nthe name of the chief town, Montego Bay, has been variously ascribed,\r\nfirstly to the bay in Portugal into which the Mondego river falls;\r\nsecondly to Francisco de Montego (or Montijo), who assisted Grijalva in\r\nhis discoveries in New Spain; and thirdly, with the greatest\r\nprobability, by Long to _manteca_, the Spanish word for butter. He adds,\r\n“This part abounding formerly with wild hogs, the Spaniards probably\r\nmade here what they called hog’s butter (lard) for exportation.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of the formation of St. James’ parish (1665) the “north\r\nside” was represented in the Assembly by Abraham Rutter and Samuel\r\nJenks. In 1673, jointly with St. Ann, St. James returned a member,\r\nCaptain Richard Guy. In that year, when there were in the twelve\r\ninhabited parishes of Jamaica 17,268 persons, the parish of St. James\r\nhad only 146, of whom 22 were negroes. In 1675 St. James returned two\r\nmembers on its own account, Richard Guy and Samuel Jenks.\r\n\r\nFour years later, when the Assembly decided that £1300 should be raised\r\nfor the fortifications of the island, St. James was asked to contribute\r\n£5 only. In 1711–12 the parishes of St. James and St. George were exempt\r\nfrom taxation, “they having no towns, few inhabitants and little\r\ncommerce.” In 1724 the first Road Act for the parish was passed, the\r\nroad going from The Cave in Westmoreland to the west end of St. James;\r\nand a court of quarter sessions was established four years later.\r\n\r\nAt =Montego Bay= was printed the third known book printed in Jamaica—an\r\nalmanack for the year 1776. St. James remained a poor parish till about\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, but by 1782 Montego Bay was called\r\n“next to Kingstown the most flourishing town in the island.”\r\n\r\nIn 1733 a bill was passed “for appointing a proper plan for building a\r\nchurch.” This church was probably built, but all traces of it are now\r\nlost. In 1738 barracks were built, and were supplied by the\r\nchurchwardens with a pack of hounds, to be used in defence and offence\r\nagainst revolted slaves. In that year Montego Bay was made a free port.\r\nIn March 1738–39 articles of pacification were signed at Trelawny Town\r\nby Cudjoe, the Maroon chief.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 the Legislature passed an Act incorporating a company to be\r\nformed by subscription under the title of “The President, Directors and\r\nCompany of the Close Harbour of Montego Bay,” with power to raise\r\n£10,000 capital, and to make a harbour at “Meagre Bay, being a part of\r\nMontego Bay,” for the protection of shipping and to create rules and\r\nregulations for its management; which company, said to have been the\r\nfirst formed in the West Indies for the execution of any public\r\nundertaking, existed for about half a century, and for a time paid\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\nIn January 1800 (to quote from the “Columbian Magazine,” Kingston,\r\n1800):\r\n\r\n  one of those dreadful swells of the sea from the N.W. did much damage,\r\n  although the misfortune has been greatly decreased, by the extent of\r\n  the Moles erected, yet it has been very considerable.\r\n\r\n  Of the two channels through the reef, which were intended to be filled\r\n  up by the Moles, the largest only is made, and the other is hardly, as\r\n  yet, commenced. Vessels lying immediately behind the Mole, and not\r\n  near to the Southern channel, which is still open, lie secure and\r\n  easy; but the vessels moored near the South channel into which an\r\n  immense sea poured, and the small craft near the shore, round which\r\n  the waves coming in at the South channel washed, were, and still are\r\n  in the greatest danger.\r\n\r\n  There were twenty-four vessels of all sizes in the Close Harbour; of\r\n  these the ship _Clyde_, belonging to Kingston, which was anchored near\r\n  the Southern channel, is totally lost; but a brig still nearer,\r\n  fortunately escaped the first day, and has since been able to shift to\r\n  a safer birth (_sic_). Five small vessels from the great action of the\r\n  swell near the shore, or from bad tackling are also lost.\r\n\r\n  In the Outer Harbour were two vessels, one a Spanish schooner, prise\r\n  to the _Experiment_ lugger, is lost; and the other, an American brig,\r\n  after losing an anchor, and driving some hundred yards, has got into a\r\n  situation where the undertow gives her a more easy birth.\r\n\r\n  It is certainly a distressing consideration to the community that\r\n  after the expense of upwards of 16,000_l._ in building the Moles, so\r\n  much damage has happened to the shipping, within them, and this danger\r\n  cannot be completely guarded against, so as to protect the whole of\r\n  the harbour, until the Southern Mole is finished, or nearly joins to\r\n  the shore; but there is this consideration, that a great number of\r\n  valuable lives were saved, not a seaman having lost his life, and\r\n  upwards of 250 negroes being safely landed on Tuesday evening, from\r\n  the Thomas Guineaman.\r\n\r\nReference to the Close Harbour ceases in the Jamaica almanacks after\r\n1848.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 two thirds of the town of Montego Bay was destroyed by fire, the\r\nloss being estimated at £500,000. And in 1831–32 the parish was the\r\nscene of one of the worst outbreaks of slaves recorded in the island’s\r\nhistory. On one night sixteen incendiary fires took place, and many\r\nlives were lost in quelling the outbreak. Martial law was declared, and\r\nthe commander of the forces, Sir Willoughby Cotton, took the field in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe foundation stone of the present parish =Church of St. James=, was\r\nlaid on May 6, 1775, and the building was opened for public worship in\r\n1782. It is Georgian in character, and typical of many churches erected\r\nin the West Indies by those who, probably doing the best they could with\r\nthe money and knowledge at their disposal, considered that a building\r\nwas rendered ecclesiastical by putting rounded heads to ordinary\r\ndomestic windows, and did not hesitate to combine the Classic and Gothic\r\nstyles. In this case, however, the building, which is one of the best of\r\nits kind, is helped by a tower, its most pleasing feature. Hakewill\r\ncalled it the handsomest church in the island. The church is dedicated\r\nto St. James the Great, the patron saint of Spain, whose name was given\r\nto the Spanish capital of the island. The parochial seal, or seal of the\r\nchurchwardens, in establishment days, is—Argent, a palmer’s staff erect;\r\nfrom its rest, dependent by a leathern thong, a gourd bottle, all\r\nproper. On a bordure gules, five pineapples of the second. The\r\ncircumscription is “Sigill Aedilium Sancti Jacobi in Jamaica.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest baptism recorded in the existing register of St. James is\r\ndated January 1, 1771; the earliest marriage, May 5, 1774, and the\r\nearliest burial July 6, 1774.\r\n\r\nThe rectors have been, so far as they can be traced:\r\n\r\n           1771–74.   Rev. Joseph Stoney.\r\n           1774–87.   Rev. J. Grignon.\r\n           1787–95.   Rev. Francis Dauney.\r\n           1795–1805. Rev. Francis Rickard.\r\n           1805–13.   Rev. David Duff.\r\n           1814–27.   Rev. Henry Jenkins.\r\n           1827–47.   Rev. John M’Intyre, M.A.\r\n           1847–62.   Archdeacon Thomas Price Williams, D.D.\r\n           1862–81.   Rev. David R. Morris.\r\n           1881–85.   Rev. W. H. Williamson.\r\n           1885–87.   Rev. George Whyte.\r\n           1887–97.   Rev. F. H. Sharpe.\r\n           1897–1904. Rev. J. W. Austin.\r\n           1905.      Rev. J. Messiah, B.A.\r\n\r\nOf the monuments in the church, the best is that of =Mrs. Rosa Palmer=,\r\nby John Bacon, R.A., of the year 1794. It is, after the Rodney and\r\nEffingham monuments at Spanish Town, the best work by Bacon in Jamaica.\r\nShe to whose memory it was erected, the wife of John Palmer, custos of\r\nthe parish, died in 1790, aged 72 years. This monument has been for\r\nyears connected with the legend of Rose Hall, about ten miles to the\r\neast of Montego Bay. Into this legend, of cruelty to slaves and murder\r\nof her several husbands by a certain Mrs. Palmer, it is not necessary to\r\nenter. Controversies have raged having for their object the identity of\r\nthe figure on the monument; some maintaining that it was the good,\r\nothers the bad Mrs. Palmer. As a matter of fact it represents neither,\r\nbut is merely an emblematic figure, such as Bacon was very fond of\r\nputting into his memorials, and in all probability the head on the vase\r\nrepresents the features of Rosa Palmer. Mr. Joseph Shore, in his work\r\n“In Old St. James” in 1911, solved the mystery. The good Mrs. Palmer was\r\nRosa Kelly, daughter of the Reverend John Kelly of St. Elizabeth, who\r\nmarried John Palmer as her fourth husband, and was his faithful wife for\r\ntwenty-three years; her other husbands being Henry Fanning of St.\r\nCatherine, George Ash of St. James, and the Honourable Norwood Witter of\r\nWestmoreland. The wicked Mrs. Palmer was Annie Mary Paterson, who\r\nmarried in St. James in 1820 John Rose Palmer, grand-nephew and\r\nsuccessor at Rose Hall and Palmyra of John Palmer. She ended her\r\nill-spent days in 1833.\r\n\r\nOther good monuments in the church are to Dr. George Macfarquhar, also\r\nby Bacon (1791), to Dr. William Fowle, an early work of Sir Richard\r\nWestmacott (1796), and to Mrs. Sarah Newton Kerr, by Henry Westmacott\r\n(1814). The works by John Bacon the younger are hardly worthy of\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 a handsome three-light window by Jones and Willis was erected at\r\nthe east end of the church. The centre light represents the Crucifixion,\r\nthe side-lights the Resurrection and the Ascension. One of the\r\nside-lights was presented by Mr. W. F. Lawrence, whose family owned\r\nFairfield and other estates on the north side for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of more than a brief _résumé_ of the history of a\r\npeople in Jamaica around whom much romance has sprang up. This romance\r\nis, however, apt to be a little modified by a closer acquaintance, for\r\nthe modern representatives show little of that physical enterprise and\r\nendurance for which their ancestors were famous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLOCK HOUSE, MAROON TOWN\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe term Maroon—said to be a corruption of the Spanish _Cimarron_, wild,\r\nuntamed, and applied to those negroes, originally fugitive slaves, who\r\nlived and still live in the mountains and forests of Guiana and the West\r\nIndies—first occurs in the English language in 1628, in “Sir Francis\r\nDrake Revived”: “The Symerons (a blacke people, which about eightie\r\nyeeres past, fled from the Spaniards their Masters).” So, too, in 1655,\r\nwhen Penn and Venables arrived, the negroes left their masters and\r\nbetook themselves to the mountainous parts of the island, with a natural\r\ndesire to escape from serving alien owners; and when the Spaniards\r\nvacated the island, assumed to themselves, as they had every right to\r\ndo, not the _rôle_ of rebels, but of a people resisting to the utmost of\r\ntheir power the invasion of the island by the English. And\r\nthenceforward, their forces swelled from time to time by runaway slaves\r\nof the newcomers, they were for many a long year a source of anxiety to\r\nthe planters living in their neighbourhood, and, indeed, to the colony\r\nin general. It may be mentioned that Bridges, in his History, gives a\r\ndifferent origin to the Maroons, but he quotes no authority in support\r\nof either of the following statements, and the first is certainly\r\nuntrue. He says:\r\n\r\n  It has been supposed that the present race of Maroons derive their\r\n  origin from the Spanish slaves who remained in the fastnesses of the\r\n  island after its conquest; but these were all disposed of and\r\n  accounted for to a man in less than eight years after that event. The\r\n  Maroons of Jamaica owe their peculiarity of feature to the mixture of\r\n  the Malay caste, which they derived from the crews of a Madagascar\r\n  slave-ship wrecked upon these shores.\r\n\r\nThat the Maroons of Jamaica were a real menace in the early days is\r\nevident from the fact that General Robert Sedgwick, in writing home to\r\nThurloe, more than once referred to them with apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe name of their first chief known to history still lives in Juan de\r\nBolas, in the St. John district of St. Catherine, round which hill the\r\nMaroons were scattered in Doyley’s time; but de Bolas in time\r\nsurrendered to the English, and was made colonel of the black regiment,\r\nand trouble ceased for the moment. The next Maroon chief of whom we read\r\nis Cudjoe. In 1690 there was an insurrection, in the parish of\r\nClarendon, of negro slaves who found a secure retreat in the interior of\r\nthe country, contenting themselves for a time with predatory excursions\r\nagainst neighbouring estates. When later an armed force was sent against\r\nthem, they elected as their chief Cudjoe, who appointed his brothers,\r\nAccompong, whose name still lives in =Accompong= in St. Elizabeth\r\n(Akjampong was the name of an Ashantee chief who figured in the Ashantee\r\nWar of 1872) and Johnny, as leaders under him, the greater part of his\r\nmen being Coromantees. He was, in about 1730, joined by a party of\r\nCottawood negroes from St. George (now merged in Portland), and later by\r\na party from St. Elizabeth. From the similarity of their mode of life,\r\nCudjoe and his followers about this time became known as Maroons, the\r\nsame as the original Spanish runaway slaves. Up to this time forty-four\r\nActs of the Assembly, Long tells us, had been passed, and £240,000\r\nexpended for the suppression of the Maroons. On the commencement of\r\nhostilities against them, their mere wish for plunder became a desire\r\nfor revenge. In 1733 the Government resolved to establish advanced posts\r\nto hold the Maroons in check, one at Cave Valley being intended to guard\r\nCudjoe. These posts were garrisoned by independent companies,\r\nconfidential negroes (termed black shot), mulattoes, and some two\r\nhundred Indians specially imported from the Mosquito Coast, who,\r\nfighting the Maroons with their own weapons, destroyed their provision\r\ngrounds. Dogs, provided by the churchwardens of the parishes, were also\r\nused for defence and for tracking purposes. Realising that his quarters\r\nwere accessible to the rangers, Cudjoe removed into Trelawny, on the\r\nnorth-west side of the Cockpits. Finding them difficult to subdue, and\r\nfearful of the risk of defeat of an organised attack on them, the\r\nGovernor, Edward Trelawny, was persuaded—at a time when, though he was\r\nignorant of it, the Maroons were prepared to surrender—to offer terms of\r\npeace to the Maroons, the offer being made through Colonel Guthrie, of\r\nthe militia, and Captain Sadler, of the regulars, who had been placed in\r\ncommand of the troops it had originally been intended to send against\r\nthem. Dr. Russell was selected as delegate to represent the English. In\r\norder to placate Cudjoe he exchanged hats with him. Later, Colonel\r\nGuthrie came forward, and under Cudjoe’s tree in Guthrie’s defile were\r\nconcluded “Articles of Pacification with the Maroons of Trelawny Town,\r\nMarch 1, 1738,” by which the Maroons received full pardon, with\r\nprivilege to possess for ever 1500 acres between =Trelawny Town=, which\r\nwas then so called after the Governor, Edward Trelawny, and the\r\nCockpits, with right to hunt; the Maroons on their side undertaking to\r\ntake part in any action of the Government against rebels, and to hand\r\nover runaway slaves to their masters. A similar treaty was made with\r\nQuao and the Windward Maroons in July 1739, and the five Maroon\r\nsettlements of Jamaica were established—Trelawny Town, Accompong,\r\nScott’s Hall, Charles Town and Moore Town, the last three being in the\r\neastern part of the island. Later, some of the land was alienated from\r\nTrelawny Town, and 1000 acres were attached to Accompong. It was really\r\nthis treaty, which kept the bodies of Maroons as a distinct tribe in the\r\nstrongest parts of the country, instead of encouraging their being\r\nmerged in the general negro population, that was the cause of all the\r\nsubsequent trouble.\r\n\r\nWe next in the history of the Maroons come to the rebellion in 1795, by\r\nthe Trelawny Town Maroons—sometimes spoken of as the Maroon War—when\r\nJames Montague was their leading chief. Their neighbours at Accompong\r\nsided with the Government.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of (or rather excuse for) the rebellion was the\r\nflogging at the workhouse at Montego Bay by a runaway negro (whom the\r\nMaroons themselves had captured) of two Maroons who had been convicted\r\nof stealing pigs. Previous to this the Maroons had become discontented\r\nthrough the removal of their superintendent, which removal they\r\nthemselves had helped to bring about, and disapproval of his successor;\r\nand they also desired new land in place of that allotted to them, which\r\nthey said was both worn out and insufficient. But Balcarres, the\r\nGovernor, always held that the origin of the war lay “in French\r\nprinciples and the unjustifiable mode of warfare adopted in these\r\nislands by the ruling power in France.”\r\n\r\nAt the first outbreak the whole island was put under martial law, and\r\nthe Governor himself, a veteran of the American war, went to the seat of\r\nwar and took command—his headquarters being first at Vaughan’s Field and\r\nlater at Montego Bay and Castle Wemyss—only leaving the scene of\r\noperations to meet the Assembly from time to time in Spanish Town. Of a\r\nnature prone to show his military prowess, and moved by fear of the\r\ninfluence of the rebellion taking place in Haiti hard by, and the\r\npresence of a number of questionable immigrants in Jamaica from that\r\nisland, as well as by his prejudice against the _imperium in imperio_\r\nwhich the Maroons possessed under the treaty of 1738, he gave the\r\nrebels, the Maroons of Trelawny Town (1660 in number all told) only four\r\ndays in which to surrender. Thirty-eight did so; but on August 12\r\nhostilities commenced by a detachment of dragoons falling into an\r\nambuscade, five officers and thirty men being killed. It is said by some\r\nthat the Maroons chose their time for rising when they did, as they knew\r\nthat with the departure of the July fleet but few troops would be left\r\nin the island; and it was only by the prompt action on the part of the\r\nGovernor in stopping the _Halifax_ packet for three weeks and in\r\ndetaining a convoy of troops on its way from England to St. Domingo\r\n(where it was sadly needed), which had actually sailed from Port Royal,\r\nthat forces were available to meet the rebels. These forces numbered\r\nsome four hundred men of the 13th, 14th, 17th, and 18th Light Dragoons,\r\nthe 83rd Foot, and the recently raised 130th Foot. A tiresome campaign\r\nthen followed, in which twenty actions were fought, the seat of the\r\nstruggle being the wild Cockpit country. By another ambuscade Colonel\r\nFitch and two other officers lost their lives.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the meeting of the Assembly in September the rebellion\r\nwas not so near quelled as the Governor had hoped.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Walpole, of the 13th Light Dragoons, who on the death\r\nof Colonel Fitch had succeeded to the command of the forces, and was\r\nmade a major-general by Balcarres and given very full powers, altered\r\nthe whole plan of campaign, teaching the troopers of the 17th Light\r\nDragoons, who had had experience in colonial warfare with Tarleton in\r\nAmerica, to fight on foot and to work in twos, so that each could hold\r\nthe arms of the other while climbing had to be done—and by fighting the\r\nMaroons in their own way paved the way for their surrender. But the\r\ndifficulty of the operation may be judged by the fact that Walpole,\r\nafter months of experience, wrote to Balcarres that there was “little\r\nchance of any but a Maroon discovering a Maroon.”\r\n\r\nWhen “cultivation was suspended, the courts at law had long been shut\r\nup, and the Island seemed more like a garrison under the power of the\r\nmartial law than a country of agriculture and commerce,” one hundred\r\nbloodhounds and forty chasseurs were imported from Cuba to aid in\r\ntracking the Maroons. The news of the arrival (on December 14) of the\r\nhounds had such an effect that without seeing them the Maroons sued for\r\npeace a week or so later, only stipulating that they should not be\r\nexecuted or transported. The treaty was ratified on December 28, but\r\nthey were only given till January 1 to come in and deliver up the\r\nrunaways. In the end they were transported on the grounds that they had\r\nnot surrendered by the date named (the last did not come in until March\r\n21) and that they had not surrendered up the runaway slaves that had\r\njoined them; and Walpole, considering that the Governor and House of\r\nAssembly had broken faith with the Maroons, whom he had promised should\r\nnot be expatriated, refused a sword of honour offered him by that body\r\nand resigned his commission in the army, which, however, he had\r\ncontemplated selling before the trouble with Balcarres began. That being\r\nso, it is odd to read in the “Account of Expenses incurred in the late\r\nMartial Law” “Present of swords to Lord Balcarres and General Walpole,\r\n£1950.” The regard one feels for Walpole’s indignation at what he terms\r\n“this guilt and infamy,” and his skill in quelling the rebellion, is\r\nmarred when one learns that he Wrote to Balcarres on December 24, 1795:\r\n“Two Maroons (Smith and Dunbar) have come in from Johnstone’s party, to\r\nbeg the King’s mercy, and the whole are to be here on Saturday, to\r\nconstruct their huts within our posts. I have allotted them a spot\r\nbetween Cudjoe Town and the Old Town; there they are to remain until the\r\nLegislature shall dispose of them. If I might give you an opinion, it\r\nshould be that they should be settled near Spanish Town, or some other\r\nof the large towns in the lowlands; the access to spirits will soon\r\ndecrease their numbers, and destroy that hardy constitution which is\r\nnourished by a healthy mountainous situation.” It is evident that his\r\nindignation was aroused by the false position in which he had been\r\nplaced, and not by any humanitarian feeling towards the Maroons. It is\r\nalso evident that Balcarres was satisfied in his own conscience that his\r\naction was right.\r\n\r\nParkinson was one of the last to surrender, about three months after the\r\ndate fixed. He and Palmer, who had both surrendered on August 11, 1795,\r\nhad been sent to the Maroons to try and persuade them to come in.\r\nInstead, they had rejoined their companies. That General Walpole had a\r\nhigh opinion of them as leaders is evident. He says in a letter to Lord\r\nBalcarres, “If Palmer or Parkinson should refuse the terms, which I\r\nthink they will, you will never conquer them.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular foot soldiers and militia employed, the 13th,\r\n14th, 17th, 18th and 20th Light Dragoons and the York Hussars, as we\r\nhave seen, took part in the struggle, and =Horse-guards= in St. James’s\r\nprobably owes its name to their having been quartered there. Of the\r\nDragoons, the 20th (or Jamaica) were raised in the West Indies. On the\r\nwhole about 1520 chosen European troops, aided by twice that number of\r\ncolonial militia, were opposed to less than three hundred undisciplined\r\nMaroons, who were, however, physically brave men, and fighting under\r\nconditions very favourable to themselves and most unfavourable to their\r\nadversaries. They had a system of horn-signals so perfect that there was\r\na distinct call by which every individual man could be hailed. The cost\r\nof the war was about £350,000 sterling. In addition £49,400 was voted to\r\ndefray the expatriation expenses.\r\n\r\nUnder date December 22, 1795, General Walpole wrote to Lord Balcarres as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  I have the honour to enclose to your Lordship the proposals of the\r\n  Maroons to which I have acceded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The whole detachment behaved to their credit. I must not omit to\r\n  mention to your Lordship, that to the impression made in the action by\r\n  the undaunted bravery of the 17th Dragoons who were more particularly\r\n  engaged on the 15th, we owe the submission of the rebels: The Maroons\r\n  speak of them with astonishment. Mr. Werge was particularly signalized\r\n  with the advance guard; and the sergeant-major of that regiment is\r\n  strongly recommended, for his spirit and activity, by the commanding\r\n  officer Mr. Edwards, who is every way deserving your Lordship’s good\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 1796, General Walpole wrote to Lord Balcarres as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  ... I am preparing to move the 13th Dragoons through the cockpits,\r\n  from One-Eye.\r\n\r\nOn February 20 Lord Balcarres wrote to General Walpole:\r\n\r\n  ... I think it will take a considerable force to guard the Maroon\r\n  prisoners. The 17th Light Dragoons and the 62nd Regiment may occupy\r\n  Montego-Bay, Falmouth and St. Ann’s.\r\n\r\n  The 17th are to hold themselves in readiness to embark for St.\r\n  Domingo, when they send shipping to receive them; of which no\r\n  requisition is as yet made.\r\n\r\n  I should be glad to know your wish as to the quartering of the 13th\r\n  Light Dragoons on their arrival.\r\n\r\n  The 14th regiment of Light Dragoons are not to remain in this country\r\n  if quiet is restored. If, however, the banditti of runaway slaves have\r\n  gone down to Old Woman Savanna, they must occupy posts in that\r\n  neighbourhood; the country that lies behind it I believe never was\r\n  explored.\r\n\r\nThe “XX (or Jamaica) Regiment of Light Dragoons” was formed in 1792 and\r\nis last mentioned in the year 1802, when it was transferred to the\r\nEnglish establishment.\r\n\r\nMajor-Gen. Robert R. Gillespie, who was one of the first lieutenants\r\nappointed when the regiment was raised in 1792, entered the army in\r\n1783. When in the following year the French planters in San Domingo\r\napplied to Jamaica for aid, he volunteered for service with the\r\ninfantry, and in the campaign there distinguished himself for bravery,\r\nreturning home at the fall of Port-au-Prince. On being appointed in 1795\r\nmajor of brigade to General Wilford, he accompanied him to San Domingo,\r\nand soon afterwards, though small in stature, killed six men single\r\nhanded. Returning to Jamaica, he assumed command of the regiment, and in\r\n1799 was recommended by the lieutenant-governor and House of Assembly\r\nfor the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was so gazetted. He was offered\r\nby Lord Hugh Seymour the military command at Curaçoa; but Lord Balcarres\r\nsaid he could not spare him. At the Peace of Amiens in 1802, when the\r\n20th Light Dragoons were transferred to the English establishment,\r\nGillespie returned home in command, and the House of Assembly, glad to\r\nbe rid of the regiment, voted one hundred pounds for a sword of honour\r\nfor him. He subsequently had a brilliant career in the East, and in 1812\r\nhe received the thanks of the commander-in-chief in India, Sir George\r\nNugent, for services in connection with the Palimbang expedition.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the unfairness to them in expatriating them, it is only\r\njust to those who did it to add that those few Maroons to whom was\r\noffered liberty to stay in Jamaica elected to go with the rest, on the\r\ngrounds that “they feared they could never live in security and quiet\r\nwith the free people of colour and negroes in this island.” Balcarres\r\nwas severely attacked in England for the use he made of the dogs from\r\nCuba; but he, it would seem, fully justified his action in that matter.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1796, the Maroons left Port Royal in three ships with the\r\n96th Regiment as guard, and under convoy of H.M.S. _Africa_. The arrival\r\nof the exiles in Halifax is thus described in “Maroons of Jamaica and\r\nNova Scotia, by J. C. Hamilton, LL.B.” in “Proceedings of the Canadian\r\nInstitute, April 1890”: “Four years after this (_i.e._ in 1796) three\r\nships entered the harbour of Halifax, laden with the most extraordinary\r\ncargoes that ever entered that port. Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, then\r\nin command at Halifax, boarded the _Dover_, was met by Colonel W. D.\r\nQuarrell, commissary-general of Jamaica, with whom Mr. Alexander\r\nOuchterlony was associated, and a detachment of the 96th Regiment drawn\r\nup on board to receive him. Black men of good proportions, with many\r\nwomen and children, all in neat uniform attire, were mustered in lines.\r\nOther transports, the _Mary_ and _Anne_, were, his Highness was\r\ninformed, about to follow, and the main cargo was six hundred Maroons\r\nexiled from Jamaica, with soldiers to guard them and meet any attacks\r\nfrom French vessels on the voyage.\r\n\r\n“The Prince was struck with the fine appearance of the black men, but\r\nthe citizens had heard of how Jamaica had been harried by its black\r\nbanditti, and were unwilling at first to have them added to their\r\npopulation.”\r\n\r\nThey worked at the fortifications that were being erected to meet the\r\nthreatened attack of the French fleet under Richery; and Maroon Hill,\r\nnear Halifax, still bears their name. But the settlement of the Maroons\r\nin Nova Scotia was ill-conceived and ill-controlled, and they, being\r\nthemselves unwilling to work, and both Jamaica and Nova Scotia unwilling\r\nto keep them in idleness, followed in 1800 those “loyal negroes” of the\r\nUnited States who had migrated first to Canada and then to Sierra Leone.\r\nIn the transport _Asia_ 550 of them reached Sierra Leone, where, as no\r\nparticular place could be secured for their location, efforts to obtain\r\nan island having failed, they were allotted a place in Granville Town,\r\nunder a superintendent, Lieutenant Odburn. The “Settlers’ Rising” was in\r\nprogress when they arrived, and they assisted in quelling it.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Trelawny Town Maroons were transported from Jamaica,\r\nbarracks were erected on the site of their old town, and regiments of\r\nBritish troops were maintained there until the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when they were withdrawn at the time of the Crimean war.\r\nTrelawny Town was for a time the headquarters of the troops stationed in\r\nthe county of Cornwall, but it later was superseded by Falmouth. The\r\nbarracks at Trelawny Town have fallen into ruins, but the evidence of\r\nthe residents in the neighbourhood of a number of white soldiers in the\r\npast exists in some of the peasantry there to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Maroon Town was made the site of a sanatorium for European\r\ntroops, and huts were erected there for the purpose, and the 68th\r\nRegiment was stationed there.\r\n\r\nOn a visit made to the Cockpit country in 1905 by the present writer and\r\na friend, on entering the neighbourhood of Trelawny Town, or Maroon Town\r\nas it is now called, we came across the remains of a block-house which\r\nhad loopholed chambers at three corners and evidently had had an upper\r\nstorey, now disappeared, for dwelling purposes. Being now in the heart\r\nof the Cockpit country we could study its formation in detail. At one\r\ntime it gave the impression of a number of stunted cones rising from a\r\nplain; at another the feeling was one of a number of basins like the\r\nDevil’s Punch-bowls of England; at all times, except where there was a\r\nclearing for corn, bananas or bread-kind, it appeared thickly\r\nwooded—mahogany, cedar, mahoe, Santa Maria, and broadleaf being\r\nprominent; and mosquito wood and red shingle wood, and other lesser\r\nknown woods, being pointed out by our guide. As the bridle path now runs\r\nat some distance from the rocks, which here and there crop out of the\r\noverhanging foliage and assume the form of solid masonry, tending to\r\ndeceive one into thinking that one is in front of the ruin of some fort,\r\nit cannot be by it that the troops travelled when the Maroons hurled\r\nstones on them from above. As one rides along these defiles the mournful\r\nnote of the solitaire, suggests the nervousness which might have fallen\r\non the soldiers marching through a thickly wooded, rocky, unknown\r\ncountry, every crag of which might conceal a foe, to whose foot such\r\nmountain paths were familiar. At Maroon Town itself we found a clearing\r\non which cattle were grazing, and a police station (just abandoned)\r\nbuilt on the site of the officers’ quarters of half a century ago. Near\r\nby was the well which supplied the settlement with water, and a\r\nbarracks, some 130 ft. long by 30 ft. broad, which had once possessed an\r\nupper storey of wood, little now remaining of the stoutly built lower\r\nwalls of limestone quarried in the neighbourhood. There also were the\r\npowder-house and the cells, the hospital and the kitchens and the\r\nmess-house, which, placed on an immense rock open to the sea breeze from\r\nthe east, commanded a view over Trelawny to the sea by Falmouth miles\r\naway. It was once a substantial building of three storeys, the solid\r\nsteps leading up to the second floor being still usable. Opposite the\r\nmess-house rise two large conical hills calling to mind the twin Pitons\r\nof St. Lucia—the one called Gun Hill (because a gun had been placed in\r\nposition there, possibly the howitzer with which Walpole did great\r\nexecution), the other Garrison Hill. Then we saw the tank some thirty\r\nfeet long, fed by a clear stream in which the soldiers were wont to\r\nbathe; then, saddest of all, a few tombs—one recalling the death in 1840\r\nof a coloured sergeant of the 68th (or Durham) Regiment, another to the\r\nwife of a quartermaster of the 38th Regiment who died in 1846, and a\r\nthird to the paymaster of the 101st Regiment who died in 1810; while a\r\nnameless tomb, the oldest inhabitant told us, belonged to a Colonel\r\nSkeate, who, being ill when his regiment left, was buried by the\r\nincoming regiment. The wood behind the police station was, we were told,\r\nalmost impassable. For miles the thick woods lie untrodden by man,\r\nexcept when a few Maroons or other negroes go hunting the wild hogs\r\nwhich abound, or “fowling,” _i.e._ shooting pigeons.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Maroon Town we visited the chief settlement of the Maroons\r\nin the west end of the island, Accompong, and experienced rough\r\ntravelling. In places there was nothing but the bare limestone rock for\r\nyards, without a scrap of earth. Nothing but a pony bred in the district\r\ncould have negotiated it successfully. But once on the main path riding\r\nwas easy. One was struck by the amount of cultivation on either hand;\r\nhere and there a patch of bananas, here and there yams, and so on. On\r\nreaching the town of Accompong we saw a number of houses scattered about\r\nand a small church nearing completion. Across a “pit” stood the\r\n“Colonel’s” house on the opposite side. There was a schoolhouse,\r\npresided over by a teacher trained in the elementary school at\r\nRetirement hard by; but the Maroons apparently did not set much store by\r\neducation, and only about a fourth of their children attended school.\r\n\r\nThe “Colonel’s” brother told us he knew more of their old language\r\n(Coromantyn) than any one else, but all we could get out of them was pig\r\n= bracho, bull = aboukani, cow = aboukress. From a philological point of\r\nview one views them with suspicion, although the late Major J. W.\r\nPowell, of the Bureau of Ethnology of the United States, assured the\r\nwriter that when he visited these Maroons a year or two ago, he had\r\ndiscovered them talking their native language. Bryan Edwards tells us\r\nthat in his day their language was “a barbarous dissonance of the\r\nAfrican dialects with a mixture of Spanish and broken English.”\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary observer there is little or nothing to differentiate the\r\nMaroons from the ordinary “bush-negroes,” although they seem to possess\r\nmore than an ordinary share of suspiciousness—a suspiciousness which was\r\nengendered by the treatment which their brothers of Trelawny Town\r\nreceived from Balcarres, and has been kept alive at odd times by\r\nsubsequent actions. This curious group of people numbering about 800\r\ndwelt, each family in its own house, in the centre of their 1200 acres,\r\nwhich they hold in common.\r\n\r\nThe following technical description of the Cockpit country, wherein\r\nMaroon Town and Accompong are situated, is taken from Mr. F. C.\r\nNicholas’s paper on the subject in the “Journal of the Institute of\r\nJamaica,” 1897.\r\n\r\n  A marked feature of the geology of the West Indies is found in the\r\n  extensive deposits of massive white limestone common to all this part\r\n  of the world. This formation, though hard and compact, disintegrates\r\n  freely; tall cliffs and broken rocks are honeycombed with openings and\r\n  pit-marks, presenting a rough jagged surface, which is sometimes\r\n  almost impassable.\r\n\r\n  The Cockpit country where this formation is typical is situated in the\r\n  west central part of Jamaica, and comprises an area some ten by\r\n  fifteen miles in extent, and for the greater part one vast labyrinth\r\n  of glades among rough cliffs, with here and there patches of smoother\r\n  ground, and at other places, coming one after the other, a general\r\n  collection of impassable sink-holes, called cockpits.\r\n\r\n  The impression one gets in first visiting this region is that it is of\r\n  little interest; just a path between a few not very high cliffs. There\r\n  is such a sameness about it all that one is constantly expecting the\r\n  next turn to lead out into the open country, or to a cultivated\r\n  estate. After a few hours’ hard scrambling one realises that here in\r\n  truth there is a wilderness of rocks.\r\n\r\n  A large part of the Cockpit country has never been explored, nor is it\r\n  probable that it ever will be, because the land is useless. One can\r\n  cross the district from north to south, and east to west, and go all\r\n  round it; sufficient to show that there is nothing to compensate for\r\n  the effort, and that one part is quite similar to all the others. The\r\n  elevations averaged from 1400 ft. to 1500 ft. In the glades I noted\r\n  aneroid readings as low as 800 ft.; while on some of the ridges which\r\n  cross this district N.E. and S.W., bending at times N. and S., I took\r\n  readings as high as 2300 ft. These are the extremes, the average\r\n  variation is about 200 ft.; but these elevations are abrupt and almost\r\n  precipitous over nearly all the region.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 there arose, owing to a not unfrequent source, disputes about\r\nland, some slight trouble amongst the Maroons of Charles Town, which\r\nwas, however, effectually suppressed by the prompt action of the general\r\ncommanding the forces. It, however, gave to the late Phil Robinson, who\r\nwas in the island at the time, an opportunity to write an article for\r\nthe “Contemporary Review,” entitled “A Dress Rehearsal of Rebellion\r\namong the Maroons at Annotto Bay, Jamaica.”\r\n\r\nIn 1796 “The Proceedings of the Honourable House of Assembly relative to\r\nthe Maroons; including the correspondence between the Right Honourable\r\nEarl Balcarres and the Honourable Major-General Walpole, during the\r\nMaroon rebellion; with the report of the Joint Special Secret Committee,\r\nto whom those papers were referred,” edited by Bryan Edwards, was\r\npublished at St. Jago de la Vega; while in the same year was published\r\nin London “The Proceedings of the Governor and Assembly of Jamaica, in\r\nregard to the Maroon negroes: published by order of the Assembly. To\r\nwhich is prefixed an introductory account, containing observations on\r\nthe disposition, character, manners, and habits of life, of the Maroons,\r\nand a detail of the origin, progress and termination of the late war\r\nbetween those people and the white inhabitants.” This was published in\r\ngreat measure as an answer to the attack made by Fox in the House of\r\nCommons on the action of the Assembly of Jamaica with regard to the\r\nMaroons. The same “Account of the Maroon Negroes in the Island of\r\nJamaica” was included in Bryan Edwards’ “Historical Survey of the Island\r\nof St. Domingo,” published in 1801.\r\n\r\nIn the “Lives of the Lindsays,” published in 1858, is an account of “The\r\nRise, Progress and Termination of the Maroon War.” Accounts of the\r\nMaroons will also be found in the histories of Long (to whom Edwards\r\nowns his indebtedness) and Bridges. The story of the Maroon War, from a\r\nmilitary point of view, is told in the 7th chapter of the “History of\r\nthe 17th Lancers,” by the Honourable J. W. Fortescue, and in a briefer\r\nform in the same writer’s “History of the British Army.” “The Maroon,”\r\nthe work of the well-known novelist, Captain Mayne Reid (first published\r\nin 1862), described a sugar estate named “Welcome Hall” near Montego\r\nBay, and a neighbouring pen, and the scene is laid entirely in St. James\r\nand Trelawny. The time is shortly anterior to the passing of the\r\nEmancipation Act in 1833, and the story, which incidentally imparts much\r\ninformation about local natural history and social life at the time, is,\r\nas might be expected from its author, full of exciting adventures.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Lady Blake contributed an article on “The Maroons of Jamaica” to\r\nthe “North American Review.”\r\n\r\nThe published accounts of the Maroon War are all more or less of a\r\npartisan spirit. Bryan Edwards holds a brief for the planters, Dallas\r\nfor the Maroons, the writer of the “Lives of the Lindsays” for\r\nBalcarres, and even Mr. Fortescue shows a slight partiality for Walpole.\r\n\r\nAn account of the cantonment of Maroon Town in 1848 is given in\r\n“Memorials of Captain Hedley Vicars, 97th Regiment,” 1881.\r\n\r\nA brief account of the Maroons in Sierra Leone is given in “The Rise of\r\nBritish West Africa,” by Claude George (1904).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wife of William Scarlett (the second), who has been alluded to in\r\nthe chapter dealing with St. Andrew, had the Lecount estate in the\r\nparish of St. John, which she parted with to Francis Morgan, mariner,\r\nher brother-in-law, he being the husband of her sister Elizabeth. This\r\nWilliam (the second) had a son William, baptized in St. Andrew’s parish\r\nchurch on January 17, 1711, but he is the only child so recorded. His\r\n(William the second) second son, James Scarlett, had estates in St.\r\nJames, which by his will, proved in 1777, he left amongst his eleven\r\nchildren, and this James’s second son was the Robert Scarlett of\r\n=Duckett’s Spring=, alluded to above.\r\n\r\nRobert Scarlett was born in 1737, probably in St. James. He died in\r\n1798, and was buried in Montego Bay on March 18. He owned Duckett’s\r\nSpring, Success estate and Forest pen in St. James. Scarlett’s Hall (not\r\nfar from Rose Hall and Palmyra) was a property of the family.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Anglin, daughter of Philip Anglin, of Paradise estate, was\r\nborn on June 25, 1747, and married firstly one John Wright, a planter,\r\nwho was killed in her presence by revolted slaves in 1763 or 1764, in\r\nthe month of March, on the estate of a Mr. Griswold. In 1765 she married\r\nRobert Scarlett, of Duckett’s Spring, and had by him thirteen children,\r\nbut only four sons and three daughters survived their father, the four\r\nsons being Philip Anglin Scarlett, custos and member of Assembly for\r\nHanover from 1816 till his death in 1823; James Scarlett,\r\n“Silver-tongued Scarlett,” afterwards Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer\r\nand first Lord Abinger; Robert Scarlett, M.D. of Edinburgh 1795, member\r\nof the Assembly for St. James in 1803–07, and later of the Council; and\r\nSir William Anglin Scarlett. Elizabeth Anglin died in 1828 at Montego\r\nBay, and was buried there on August 28.\r\n\r\nMary, daughter of John Lawrence, and wife of Philip Anglin, of Paradise\r\nestate, was the mother of the above mentioned Elizabeth. She was born in\r\n1713 and died in 1797.\r\n\r\nPhilip Anglin Scarlett, member of the Assembly for Hanover, was the\r\neldest son of Robert Scarlett, of Duckett’s Spring, and the owner of\r\nCambridge estate, where the railway now runs on the way to Montego Bay,\r\nand near the road to Duckett’s.\r\n\r\nWilliam Anglin Scarlett was born on June 24, 1777. He died at Grove pen\r\nin Manchester on October 9, 1831, and lies buried at Mandeville. The\r\nfollowing is the inscription on his tombstone: “Here rest the mortal\r\nremains of the Honourable Sir William Scarlett, Knight, ten years Chief\r\nJustice of Jamaica. He died October 9, 1831, aged 54. ‘The memory of the\r\njust is blessed.’” He married in July 1809 Mary, daughter of Joseph\r\nWilliams, of Luana estate in the parish of St. Elizabeth; in that year\r\nhe was member of the Assembly for St. James. He became chief justice of\r\nJamaica in 1821. He was knighted in 1829. His widow survived him for one\r\nyear, dying at Worthing in Sussex, England, in 1832. In 1823 he presided\r\nover the trial of Augustus Hardin Beaumont, the proprietor of a somewhat\r\nscandalous paper called “The Trifler,” first published in that year, for\r\na libel on the Governor, the Duke of Manchester. The trial was the first\r\nto take place in the new court house, Kingston, which, wrecked by the\r\nearthquake of 1907, was only pulled down recently. The trial lasted for\r\nfourteen hours, finishing at 12.30 A.M., and ended in a verdict of “Not\r\nGuilty.” On leaving the court house the chief justice and\r\nattorney-general (Burge) were hissed and pelted with stones.\r\n\r\nIn the rebellion of 1831 the great house and works on both Cambridge and\r\nDuckett’s Spring were destroyed. On the former were 196 slaves, on the\r\nlatter 221. At the time of Emancipation nine Scarletts owned properties\r\nin Hanover, Trelawny, St. James, St. Ann, St. Thomas-in-the-Vale and\r\nKingston, with an aggregate of 327 slaves.\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge is still to be seen a family burial vault. At Duckett’s are\r\nthe remains of the works and the great house. The latter was a square\r\nbuilding of stone, with two loopholed circular towers at diagonally\r\nopposite corners. A similar arrangement is observable at The Cottage, on\r\nCow Park, hard by in Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nIn the history gallery of the Institute of Jamaica are photographic\r\nreproductions of paintings of five members and connections of the\r\nScarlett family: Robert Scarlett of Duckett’s Spring, and Elizabeth\r\nAnglin his wife; Mary Anglin, mother of Elizabeth Anglin, and Philip\r\nAnglin Scarlett, the eldest son of Robert; and his fourth son, Sir\r\nWilliam Anglin Scarlett, chief justice of Jamaica. The slave boy who\r\nholds the game bag in the portrait of Robert Scarlett was called Oliver,\r\nand was entailed very strictly on his master’s death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROSE HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Grove Hill= house is mentioned in “Tom Cringle’s Log.” =Rose Hall=,\r\nabout 10 miles from Montego Bay, is one of the finest examples of\r\nJamaica architecture of the old time. It was erected in 1760 at a cost\r\nof £30,000 by George Ash, the second husband of Rose Kelly (b. 1724).\r\nHer fourth husband was the Hon. John Palmer. It is said to have been the\r\nscene of a tragedy in the eighteenth century, when the owner, Annie Mary\r\nPaterson, wife of John Rose Palmer, grand-nephew of the Hon. John\r\nPalmer, was murdered by her slaves; but the occurrence more probably\r\ntook place at Palmyra hard by. In 1831 the great house at Rose Hall was\r\nunoccupied and one wing had been removed, while a gable end is all that\r\nremains of the other. =Adelphi= (formerly called Stretch and Set) is\r\nsaid to have been the first spot on the north side at which religious\r\ninstruction was given to the slaves. At =Running Gut= estate are\r\nmonuments of the Lawrence family, _e.g._ Benjamin Lawrence (d. 1776).\r\nThe Lawrences for many years owned property from Little River to Montego\r\nBay. The last portion was sold in 1910. =Spring Mount= estate has\r\nmonuments of the Heath family, and =Catherine Hall= estate has tombs of\r\nStone, Barnett, Ross, and others. =Cinnamon Hill= is interesting as\r\nbeing the home of the Barretts and the Moultons, from whom descended the\r\npoetess wife of the poet Robert Browning. =Carlton= formerly belonged to\r\nan old Scottish family, the Gordons of Earlston, well known by readers\r\nof Crockett’s books, and part of the property is still called Earlston.\r\nAt =California= and =Williamsfield= are Arawâk kitchen middens; at\r\n=Tryall= an Arawâk kitchen midden and cave, indicating the existence at\r\none time of an important Indian settlement; and at =Kempshot=, the site\r\nof the observatory of the government meteorologist, there is an Arawâk\r\nrock-carving. =Brandon Hill= has a curious cave; this was the town house\r\nof the Hon. John Palmer, of Rose Hall. There is another cave at =Seven\r\nRivers=, near Cambridge, with stalactites. =Miranda Hill= has Spanish\r\nremains. =Seaford Town=, in St. James, is named after Lord Seaford, who\r\nthere established a settlement of German immigrants from Hanover. Some\r\naccount of his family is given in the chapter on St. Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n                                HANOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nKingston and Port Royal excepted, Hanover is the smallest parish in area\r\nin the island. When it was formed the Assembly wished to call it St.\r\nSophia in honour of the mother of George I, but in this it was\r\noverridden by the Council, and the name was chosen with reference to the\r\nreigning family in England. In the “Jamaica Almanac” for 1751 it is\r\ncalled, German fashion, Hannover.\r\n\r\nIn the =Church of Lucea= is a monument to Sir Simon Clarke, 7th baronet\r\n(d. 1777) by Flaxman. The inscription runs: “In this church is deposited\r\nthe mortal part of Sir Simon Clarke, Bart., who was born in this island\r\nA.D. 1727, and died on the 2nd of November, 1777, having that day\r\ncompleted his 50th year.” His father, the sixth baronet, represented St.\r\nJohn in the Assembly in 1731, and St. Mary in 1732 and 1736, and was\r\ncalled to the Council in 1739. Sir Simon, the seventh baronet,\r\nrepresented Hanover in the Assembly in 1760 and 1772. By his wife, Anne\r\nHaughton, eldest daughter and co-heir of Philip Haughton, he left two\r\nsons, Philip Haughton and Simon Haughton. Sir Simon Peter, the fifth\r\nbaronet, was an officer in the royal navy in 1730, but was transported\r\nfor highway robbery to Jamaica, where his uncle held the office of\r\npatent clerk of the Crown.\r\n\r\nMartin Rusea, a French refugee, in grateful recollection of the\r\nhospitality manifested towards him on his arrival and settlement in the\r\ncolony, left by his will, dated July 23, 1764, all his real and personal\r\nestate, which afterwards realised £4500 currency (£2700 sterling), for\r\nthe establishment of a free school in the parish of Hanover.\r\n\r\nThe devise was disputed, but in 1777 an Act was passed (18 Geo. 3, chap.\r\n18) settling the trust and establishing an undenominational school,\r\nwhich has been maintained since in Lucea. It is at present situated in\r\nthe old barracks, and is known as =Rusea’s School=.\r\n\r\nTrinity Chapel, Green Island, has the tomb of Hugh Munro (d. 1829); at\r\nOrange Bay estate is the tomb of Colonel James Campbell (d. 1744) and\r\nothers of the family, including one to John Campbell, custos of the\r\nparish (d. 1808, aged 76) “erected by his dutiful and affectionate\r\nnephew, John Blagrove, Esq.,” the John Blagrove, alluded to in the\r\naccount of Cardiff Hall, in St. Ann, to whom Campbell owned his\r\nindebtedness for much financial assistance in his will, and to whom he\r\nleft his estates under certain conditions. He manumitted certain of his\r\nmulatto slaves and left them money to purchase negroes to assist them in\r\ncarrying on their business. In a codicil he states:\r\n\r\n  It is my will and desire also that the place of my interment should be\r\n  about 20 feet in direct line from the front Bow windows of the\r\n  Hospital [for the completion of which he made provision] and that a\r\n  sun-dial be erected over my grave. The Sun Dial 18 inches in diameter\r\n  to be supported by both hands upon the head of a Leaden figure of a\r\n  Negro man with a bandage about his waist Kneeling upon the right knee,\r\n  placed upon a platform laid with Bristol Flags, six feet square and 18\r\n  inches higher than the ground round about, so that it requires three\r\n  steps of Bristol Flags six inches high and 18 inches wide to get up to\r\n  the platform, and this will effectually prevent the Cattle and Horses\r\n  while pasturing from rubbing against it, and putting it out of plumb.\r\n\r\nAt =Haughton Court Mountain= is the tomb of Christopher Crooks (d.\r\n1762). The tomb of John Pearce is on the parochial road between Hopewell\r\nand Welcome; he was murdered by the slaves of the adjoining estate on\r\nDecember 30, 1831. =Salt Spring= estate burial-ground has a monument to\r\nJohn Campbell (d. 1782); =Haughton Court= burial-ground has tombs of\r\nColonel Richard Haughton (d. 1740), Jonathan Haughton (d. 1767), and\r\nothers of the family who came to Jamaica from Barbados; =Fat Hog Quarter\r\nEstate= burial-ground has tombs of Philip Haughton (d. 1765) and others\r\nof the family; and at =Point Estate= burial-ground are tombs of David\r\nDehaney (d. 1701) and others of the family. =Haughton Hall=, =Rhodes\r\nHill=, =New-found River= and =Kew= are all places with Arawâk\r\nkitchen-middens. At The Bluff, Round Hill, is a stone to James Reid (d.\r\n1772). =Cousin’s Cove= is interesting as being the property which caused\r\nMrs. Flora Annie Steel, its present owner, to visit Jamaica in 1914 on\r\naccount of a lawsuit connected with it.\r\n\r\n=Shettlewood=, originally belonging to an owner of that name, was for\r\nmany years, with Montpellier, the property of the Ellis family. In the\r\nclosing years of the nineteenth century extensive tobacco-growing\r\nexperiments were carried out, but were ultimately abandoned. Both pens\r\nof recent years have had many head of imported Indian cattle placed on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n                              WESTMORELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWestmoreland, which became a parish in 1703, was probably so called\r\nbecause it is the westernmost parish in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe chief town was formerly called Queen’s Town (now Cross Path) and\r\ncontained a church and many inhabitants, but in 1730 Savanna-la-Mar\r\n(“the plain by the sea”) rose into fame.\r\n\r\nIts sad fate in the hurricane of 1744 can never be remembered without\r\nhorror. “The sea bursting its ancient limits overwhelmed that unhappy\r\ntown and swept it to instant destruction, leaving not a vestige of man,\r\nbeast, or habitation behind. So sudden and comprehensive was the\r\nstroke,” says Bryan Edwards, “that I think the catastrophe of\r\nSavanna-la-Mar was even more terrible, in many respects, than that of\r\nPort Royal.”\r\n\r\nThe “Spanish road from Bluefields Bay to Martha Brae, by the head of the\r\nGreat River,” as Long wrote, is said to be still in existence.\r\n\r\nThe old parish =Church of Savanna-la-Mar= was pulled down in 1904 in\r\norder that a new and more suitable building be erected in its place. The\r\nold building took the place of what must have been the first parish\r\nchurch erected there late in the seventeenth century or early in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe church stood somewhere along the sea beach. It was destroyed in the\r\nstorm on October 3, 1780. For some years services were held in a\r\ntemporary building, and in 1797 the foundation-stone of the second\r\nchurch was laid, but it would seem that it was really intended to be a\r\ntemporary structure. It was opened for divine service in 1799, so\r\nconsidering that it was a wooden building it had done good service.\r\nWhile excavating, the old foundation-stone was discovered, and in it was\r\ninlaid a brass plate in a fine state of preservation, bearing the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n                              Deo Juvante\r\n                            Hoc primum Saxum\r\n                              Templi hujus\r\n                           Parochiæ Westmoriæ\r\n                              Jamaicensis\r\n                   Ornatissimus Georgius Murray, Arm.\r\n                            Custos Rotulorum\r\n                             (Attendentibus\r\n                     Multis Parochianis præclaris)\r\n                               Collocavit\r\n                        Die quarto Mensis Junii\r\n                         Natatis Auspicatissimo\r\n                    Annoque Regni tricesimo Septimo\r\n                             Georgii Tertii\r\n                             Salutis humanæ\r\n                                 1797.\r\n                         Thoma Stewart, Rectore\r\n                       Hugone Fraser, Architecto\r\n                                 D.

Died Jan. 1915\r\n\r\nThe new building is a stone structure with a clerestory of wood. It is\r\nin length 105 ft. 3 in.; width 56 ft., with an apse 13 ft. 6 in. by 23\r\nft. It is dedicated to St. George. The foundation-stone was laid on St.\r\nGeorge’s Day, 1903, and the building was consecrated St. George’s Day,\r\n1904.\r\n\r\nWhere =Bluefields= now stands once stood probably the township of\r\nOristan, one of the three principal early “cities” formed by the\r\nSpaniards in Jamaica, named after a town in Sardinia when that island\r\nwas under the crown of Spain. Except for Sevilla (St. Ann’s Bay),\r\nBluefields was the only town mentioned in the description of Jamaica\r\nsupplied by Gage to Cromwell. It was connected by road with Mellila\r\n(near Montego Bay) on the north, and with Esquivel (Old Harbour) to the\r\neast. It had been deserted by the founders as a place of settlement\r\nprior to 1655, although it was adopted as a temporary place of residence\r\nby a number of Spaniards in 1657, before they were finally driven off\r\nthe island. Of it Blome writes in his “Description of the Island of\r\nJamaica, with other Isles and Territories in America” (1672):—\r\n\r\n  “_Orista_ reguards the _South-Sea_, in which are many _Rocks_, and\r\n  amongst their _Banks_, some _Isles_, as _Servavilla_, _Quitosvena_ and\r\n  _Serrana_, where _Augustin Pedro Serrano_ lost his _Vessel_, and saved\r\n  onely himself, and here in a solitary and lone Condition passed away 3\r\n  Yeares; at the end of which time he had the company of a _Marriner_\r\n  for 4 _Years_ more, that was likewise there _Ship-wrackt_, and also\r\n  alone saved himself.”\r\n\r\nThe Serrano above mentioned was a Spanish hidalgo, a passenger in one of\r\nthe plate fleets during the reign of Charles V, whose ship was wrecked\r\non the island. When, after his sojourn there, he reached Spain, Serrano\r\nwas sent into Germany to tell his experiences to the Emperor, who gave\r\nhim an order on the mines of Peru for four thousand eight hundred\r\nducats, but he died on his way to Panama.\r\n\r\nRuins of Oristan existed when Leslie wrote in 1739. In the Assembly\r\nconvened in October 1664, Bluefields was represented by James Perkman\r\nand Christopher Pinder; but at the next election (January, 1671–72) the\r\ndistrict was called St. Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nWhether Bluefields owes its name, as does its namesake Blewfields in\r\nNicaragua, to the use made of it by Bleevelt, the buccaneer, is merely\r\nconjecture. In the map accompanying Blome’s “Description of Jamaica” it\r\nis called Blew Fields.\r\n\r\nIn later days Bluefields has been chiefly noted as the temporary home of\r\nthe celebrated naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, well known as the inventor\r\nof the marine aquarium, whose writings have done much to bring the\r\ncharms of Jamaica to the notice of students of natural history. While on\r\nthe one hand he was, as Huxley called him, an “honest hodman of\r\nscience,” on the other the unacademic freshness of his early habit of\r\nmind, which met with the hearty approval of Darwin and Owen, remained\r\nthrough life, and gave, as his son points out in his Life, its pleasant\r\ntincture to all his subsequent works; and this is especially noticeable\r\nin his “Naturalist’s Sojourn,” “one of the most valuable and best\r\nwritten of his books.” He was not a true biologist; his real work in\r\nlife was the practical study of animal forms in detail, and his chief\r\nattempts at theorising, “Life” and “Omphalos,” were failures. In these\r\ndays of nature study it may be interesting to quote the following\r\npassage from the preface to the “Naturalist’s Sojourn,” written more\r\nthan half a century ago:\r\n\r\n  That alone is worthy to be called _Natural History_, which\r\n  investigates and records the condition of living things, of things in\r\n  a state of nature; if animals, of _living_ animals:—which tells of\r\n  their “sayings and doings,” their varied notes and utterances, songs\r\n  and cries; their actions, in ease and under the pressure of\r\n  circumstances; their affections and passions towards their young,\r\n  towards each other, towards other animals, towards man; their various\r\n  arts and devices to protect their progeny, to procure food, to escape\r\n  from their enemies, to defend themselves from attacks; their ingenious\r\n  resources for concealment; their stratagems to overcome their victims;\r\n  their modes of bringing forth, of feeding and of training their\r\n  offspring; the relations of their structure to their wants and habits;\r\n  the countries in which they dwell; their connexion with the inanimate\r\n  world around them, mountain or plain, forest or field, barren heath or\r\n  bushy dell, open savannah or wild hidden glen, river, lake or\r\n  sea:—this would be indeed _zoology_, _i.e._ the science of _living_\r\n  creatures.\r\n\r\nDr. Duerdon, in his article on Gosse, which appeared in the “Journal of\r\nthe Institute of Jamaica” in 1899, says:\r\n\r\n  There is no writer who has thrown such a charm around the natural\r\n  history of Jamaica, or who has contributed in the same degree to make\r\n  known the various representatives of its topical fauna, as Philip\r\n  Henry Gosse. Probably no other country possesses such a strictly\r\n  accurate and entertaining account of the nature and activities of its\r\n  leading animals, such as they were fifty years ago, as is found in the\r\n  pages of “A Naturalist’s Sojourn in Jamaica.” With its minute and\r\n  attractively written observations and descriptions of almost\r\n  everything which could appeal to the eye of a naturalist, Gosse has\r\n  accomplished for Jamaica what Gilbert White, in his letters of last\r\n  century, performed for Selborne.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1810, Gosse was from 1827 to 1835 in an office in Newfoundland;\r\nfrom 1835 to 1838 in Canada. In 1836 he wrote his “Entomology of\r\nNewfoundland” (which still remains unpublished); after a sojourn in\r\nCanada and Alabama he returned to England in 1839 and sold the MS. of\r\nhis “Canadian Naturalist,” which had been written on his homeward\r\nvoyage. He published his “Introduction of Zoology” in 1843. In 1844 he\r\nstarted for Jamaica, where he remained for eighteen months at Bluefields\r\nas the paying guest of a Moravian minister and his wife, and collected\r\nand sent home specimens of many rare animals. In 1847 he published his\r\n“Birds of Jamaica,” and in 1849 a folio volume of plates in\r\nillustration. In 1851 he produced his “Naturalist’s Sojourn in Jamaica,”\r\nin which he was much assisted by Richard Hill, one of Jamaica’s most\r\ntalented sons. Several other works followed and added to his reputation.\r\nIn 1856 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, to the\r\nTransactions of which he contributed numerous papers. He died in 1888,\r\nafter many years of seclusion, at St. Mary’s Church, Devonshire. Gosse’s\r\nmain purpose in visiting Jamaica was the collection, for dealers at\r\nhome, of the animals and plants, particularly in such popular groups as\r\ninsects, birds, shells and orchids. That he was an eminently successful\r\ncollector in every department may be gathered from the number of objects\r\nwhich he gives in the “Sojourn,” namely: “Mammalia, 41 specimens; Birds,\r\n1510; Reptiles, 102; Fishes, 94; Nests and Eggs, 34; Shells (marine),\r\n1276; (terrestrial and fluviatile), about 1850; Crustacea, 100; Insects\r\n(including Arachnida and Myriapoda), about 7800; Echinodermata, 57;\r\nZoophytes, &c., 42; Sponges, 550; Dried plants, about 5000; Living\r\nplants (Orchideæ), about 800; Bulbs and Suckers, 932; Cacti, 32; Ferns,\r\n222; other Living Plants and Young Trees, &c., 117; large Capsules and\r\nSeed-vessels, 383; Seeds of Flowering Plants, 170 packets; Palm seeds,\r\n14 boxes; Gums, 24 specimens; Woods, 50 blocks.”\r\n\r\nThe Bluefields of to-day differs but little from its condition of fifty\r\nyears ago. The actual property to which the name is applied was in\r\nGosse’s time in a very advanced ruinate condition, having been thrown up\r\nas an estate years before. When he was there the prospect of planters\r\nwas by no means bright. “In 1844,” he says, “the beautiful sugar estates\r\nthroughout the Island were half desolate, and the planters had either\r\nceased to reside in their mansions or had pitifully retrenched their\r\nexpenses.”\r\n\r\nA tinted lithograph of Bluefields House and its immediate surroundings\r\nforms the frontispiece to the “Naturalist’s Sojourn”; but various\r\nalterations have been effected in the house since the drawing was made,\r\nand the internal re-arrangements have been so numerous that the actual\r\nroom used by Gosse—a naturalist’s workroom—cannot now be identified. A\r\nview of Bluefields, entitled “The Torch was lying in Bluefields Bay,”\r\nalso forms the frontispiece to one of the many editions of “Tom\r\nCringle’s Log,” _i.e._ the third volume of “Blackwood’s Standard\r\nNovels,” published in 1842. Gosse gave a copy of this work to his young\r\nson on his request for information regarding the West Indies. Bluefields\r\nRiver—the “romantic little stream,” as he fondly terms it—still glides\r\nand tumbles down to the sea, its waters as pure and fresh as ever and as\r\nwell stocked with mullet, crayfish, and crabs as when the naturalist\r\nwandered along its banks, turned aside its stones or searched its\r\ncrevices for specimens, or bathed in its enticing pools. The Bluefields\r\nhills behind stretch upwards, their sides as thickly wooded as when\r\nGosse first gazed upon them from Bluefields Bay, or, as he himself says\r\nof the Peak, “in the rude luxurious wildness that it bore in the days\r\nwhen the glories of those Hesperides first broke upon the astonished\r\neyes of Europeans.”\r\n\r\nIn August 1694 Sir William Beeston sent home to the Duke of Shrewsbury\r\n“A Brief Account of what passed in Jamaica during the preparations and\r\nduration of the French attacks on it in 1694.” In it, while telling of\r\nthe French predatory attacks along the coast before the final landing at\r\nCarlisle Bay, he says: “On the Thursday after their arrival at Cow Bay,\r\nthe wind blew hard and the Admiral’s ship and another were blown off\r\nshore to Blackfield Bay at the west end of the Island, where they landed\r\nsixty men. Major Andress, who had been left there with a few men,\r\nengaged them and there was a small encounter in which we had one man\r\nkilled and two wounded, and they lost some; but the Admiral firing a gun\r\nto recall them they hurried on board, leaving their food and captured\r\ncattle behind them, and sailed away.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the word is Bluckfield or Blackfield in the original manuscript\r\n(it is printed Blackfield in the “Calendar of State Papers”) there is no\r\ndoubt that Bluefields is referred to. The Major Andress is evidently\r\nidentical with Lieutenant-Colonel Barnard Andreiss, who was custos and\r\nmember of the Assembly for St. Elizabeth, and died at Lacovia in 1710.\r\n\r\nMatthew Gregory Lewis—usually known from the title of his most famous\r\nwork as Monk Lewis—though he only spent a few months in Jamaica, did\r\nmuch for the welfare of the negro population, both by precept and\r\nexample. On both sides his ancestors had interests in the island. His\r\nuncle Robert Sewell died Attorney-General of Jamaica. Another relative\r\nand namesake, the Hon. John Lewis, was Chief Justice. The husband of one\r\nof his father’s sisters, a Mr. Blake, was a West Indian planter, and his\r\nmaternal grandmother lies buried in Spanish Town cathedral, while the\r\nmausoleum which he mentions as being at =Cornwall= points to a resident\r\nproprietorship. Another aunt, it may be mentioned, was married to the\r\nill-fated General Whitelocke, who, after commanding with distinction in\r\n1793–94 the expedition sent by General Williamson from Jamaica to St.\r\nDomingo, and elsewhere, was cashiered in 1808 for cowardice in the\r\nBuenos Ayres expedition of the previous year.\r\n\r\nLewis was born in London in 1775. His father was the deputy secretary at\r\nwar, and his mother the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Sewell, the\r\nMaster of the Rolls. Much of his life and his inner thoughts may be\r\ngathered from “The Life and Correspondence of M. G. Lewis,” published\r\nanonymously—by Mrs. Margaret Baron-Wilson—in 1839, based in great\r\nmeasure on the letters which he constantly wrote to a mother whom he\r\nadored.\r\n\r\nA more precocious child than he was it would be almost impossible to\r\nconceive; but at the same time, though least like her in outward\r\nappearance of all her four children, he inherited much of the\r\ntemperament of his mother, a timid and sensitive woman, whose constant\r\ncompanion he was in early life.\r\n\r\nYoung Lewis’s histrionic talents were early developed, and at\r\nWestminster he took part in the school plays. Intended by his parents\r\nfor a diplomatic career, he afterwards went to Oxford, spending his\r\nvacations on the continent in the study of modern languages.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nineteen, his father’s influence procured him an attachéship\r\nto the British Embassy at the Hague. He stayed but a few months in the\r\nDutch capital, but in that time, in the short space of ten weeks, he\r\nwrote a work by the publication of which in 1795 he at once sprang into\r\nfame—“Ambrosio, or The Monk.”\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy to be noticed between the character of Lewis as a man\r\nand the opinions expressed in the book are most curious. Mrs.\r\nBaron-Wilson, evidently a close friend, says of him: “There is nothing\r\nelse in English literature so wild, so extravagant, so utterly at\r\nvariance with all the ordinary and received rules of art and of\r\ncriticism (not to mention the recognised codes of morals), as the chief\r\nwritings of ‘Monk’ Lewis. Yet we may tax the whole circle of our\r\nbiographical literature to show us a man whose personal character and\r\nconduct—from his earliest youth to the close of his worldly career—were\r\nmore strictly and emphatically those which we are accustomed to look for\r\nfrom a plain, right-thinking, commonsense view of human affairs.” Before\r\nhe had passed his majority by many months, Lewis was elected Member of\r\nParliament for Hindon in Wiltshire, in which borough he succeeded\r\nWilliam Beckford, of Fonthill Abbey, another Jamaica proprietor. But his\r\nparliamentary career was singularly prosaic; he never addressed the\r\nHouse. Henceforth he devoted himself to literature. From his facile pen\r\nflowed contributions to every branch, from _vers de société_ to funeral\r\nodes—novels, dramas, lyric poems, Scotch ballads, nautical songs,\r\nimitations of classic writers, translations and adaptations from the\r\nGerman, Italian, Spanish and Danish.\r\n\r\nAs a reviver of old ballads he paved the way for Hogg and for Scott, the\r\nlatter of whom collaborated with him in his “Tales of Terror” and “Tales\r\nof Wonder,” which however were never popular.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of wealth and the inheritance of his father’s West\r\nIndian estates enabled him to enter on a larger sphere of philanthropic\r\nwork than he had hitherto been able to undertake. His action in this\r\nrespect was not a momentary impulse, but a practical outcome of firm\r\nconviction, and he took steps to ensure that its effects should endure\r\nafter his death. His object was the amelioration of the condition of the\r\nslaves on his Jamaica properties.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Black River on New Year’s Day, 1816, where he found “John\r\nCanoe” and all the rest of negro Christmastide festivities in full\r\nswing. In his first letter home to his mother he told her he was keeping\r\na regular journal, and this was afterwards published posthumously in\r\n1834, under the title of “The Journal of a West Indian Proprietor, kept\r\nduring a residence in the Island of Jamaica,” which Coleridge in his\r\n“Table-Talk” denotes “delightful. It is almost the only unaffected book\r\nof travels I have read of late years. You have the man himself. It is by\r\nfar his best work, and will live to be popular.” A new edition appeared\r\nin 1861 under the title of “Journal of a Residence among the Negroes in\r\nthe West Indies.”\r\n\r\nLewis spent four months in Jamaica, and so much of his time did he give\r\nto the amelioration of the condition of his slaves on his estate of\r\nCornwall, within a few miles of Savanna-la-Mar, that he left the island\r\nwithout having visited Hordley, an estate in the Plantain Garden River\r\ndivision of St. Thomas-in-the-East, in which estate he had a share. On\r\nCornwall there were 307 slaves and 287 head of stock, and on Hordley 283\r\nslaves and 130 stock. His friend Lord Holland, it may be mentioned, then\r\nowned Friendship and Greenwich, neighbouring estates in Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nLewis’s principal acts were the abolition of the lash, the acceptance of\r\nnegro evidence at enquiries into offences, &c., and an endeavour to\r\nsupplement manual labour by mechanical implements and improved stock. He\r\nbuilt better hospitals for the sick, granted extra holidays to his\r\nnegroes, and generally did his best to spoil them—not without success,\r\nfor he writes: “The negroes certainly are perverse beings. They had been\r\npraying for a sight of their master year after year; they were in\r\nraptures at my arrival; I have suffered no one to be punished, and shown\r\nthem every possible indulgence during my residence amongst them, and one\r\nand all they declare themselves perfectly happy and well treated. Yet\r\nprevious to my arrival they made thirty-three hogsheads a week; in a\r\nfortnight after my landing their product dwindled to twenty-three;\r\nduring this last week they have managed to make but thirteen.”\r\n\r\nIt is curious to read of the author of “The Monk,” a little lion in\r\nLondon society, throwing himself heart and soul into the most minute\r\nquestions of domestic economy and policy at Cornwall, and adjusting\r\ndifferences between Cubina and Phyllis.\r\n\r\nHe drew up rules for the better security of justice for his slaves after\r\nhe had left, and by his kindness he so won their hearts that when he\r\nthreatened to leave them, they professed to be filled with despair.\r\n\r\nSo strongly was he impressed with the evil arising from absent\r\nlandlordism that in a codicil to his will he made it a condition of\r\ninheritance that the owner, whoever he or she might be, of his estates\r\nshould pass three clear calendar months in Jamaica every third year.\r\n\r\nHe made enemies for himself amongst the local magistrates, by taking\r\nupon himself the part of intercessor with their masters for slaves on\r\nneighbouring properties.\r\n\r\nHe made one more visit to Jamaica. In October 1817 accompanied by Tita,\r\nan Italian valet, he set out for Jamaica in the same ship and with the\r\nsame captain as in 1815. He reached Black River in February 1818, and\r\nthis time he visited Hordley, but, as we have seen in the account of St.\r\nThomas, had hardly sufficient time to effect such drastic changes as he\r\nhad done at Cornwall.\r\n\r\nOn his way he stopped at Kingston, where he saw performed at the theatre\r\nhis own tragedy “Adelgitha,” whom the author meant only to be killed in\r\nthe last act, but whom the actors murdered in all five.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1818, he left Black River for England, and ten days later he\r\nwas committed to a watery grave, having succumbed to yellow fever, which\r\nhad broken out on board the _Sir Godfrey Webster_. He died in the arms\r\nof the faithful Tita who was afterwards present at Byron’s death.\r\n\r\nThe following is Lewis’s description of Cornwall great house as it then\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n  The houses here are generally built and arranged to one and the same\r\n  model. My own is of wood, partly raised upon pillars; it consists of a\r\n  single floor: a long gallery, called a piazza, terminated at each end\r\n  by a square room, runs the whole length of the house. On each side of\r\n  the piazza is a range of bedrooms, and the porticoes of the two fronts\r\n  form two more rooms, with balustrades, and flights of steps descending\r\n  to the lawn. The whole house is virandoed with shifting Venetian\r\n  blinds to admit air; except that one of the end rooms has sash-windows\r\n  on account of the rains, which, when they arrive, are so heavy, and\r\n  shift with the wind so suddenly from the one side to the other, that\r\n  all the blinds are obliged to be kept closed; consequently the whole\r\n  house is in total darkness during their continuance, except the single\r\n  sash-windowed room. There is nothing underneath except a few\r\n  store-rooms and a kind of waiting-hall; but none of the domestic\r\n  negroes sleep in the house, all going home at night to their\r\n  respective cottages and families.\r\n\r\n  Cornwall House itself stands on a dead flat, and the works are built\r\n  in its immediate neighbourhood, for the convenience of their being the\r\n  more under the agent’s personal inspection (a point of material\r\n  consequence with them all, but more particularly for the hospital).\r\n  This dead flat is only ornamented with a few scattered bread-fruit and\r\n  cotton trees, a grove of mangoes, and the branch of a small river,\r\n  which turns the mill. Several of these buildings are ugly enough; but\r\n  the shops of the cooper, carpenter and blacksmith, some of the trees\r\n  in their vicinity, and the negro huts, embowered in shrubberies and\r\n  groves of oranges, plantains, cocoas and pepper-trees, would be\r\n  reckoned picturesque in the most ornamented grounds. A large spreading\r\n  tamarind fronts me at this moment and overshadows the stables, which\r\n  are formed of open wickerwork; and an orange tree, loaded with fruit,\r\n  grows against the window at which I am writing.\r\n\r\n  On three sides of the landscape the prospect is bounded by lofty,\r\n  purple mountains; and the variety of occupations going on all around\r\n  me, and at the same time, give an inconceivable air of life and\r\n  animation to the whole scene, especially as all those occupations look\r\n  clean—even those which in England look dirty. All the tradespeople are\r\n  dressed in jackets and trousers, either white or of red and sky-blue\r\n  stripe. One band of negroes are carrying the ripe canes on their heads\r\n  to the mill; another set are conveying away the “trash,” after the\r\n  juice has been extracted; flocks of turkeys are sheltering from the\r\n  heat under the trees; the river is filled with ducks and geese; the\r\n  coopers and carpenters are employed about the puncheons; carts drawn\r\n  some by six, others by eight, oxen, are bringing loads of Indian corn\r\n  from the fields; the black children are employed in gathering it into\r\n  the granary, and in quarrelling with pigs as black as themselves, who\r\n  are equally busy in stealing the corn whenever the children are\r\n  looking another way: in short, a plantation possesses all the movement\r\n  and interest of a farm, without its dung and its stench and its dirty\r\n  accompaniments.\r\n\r\nThe following inscriptions occur at Cornwall:\r\n\r\n                         Here lieth the Body of\r\n                            Mrs. Jane Lewis\r\n             Late wife of the Honourable William Lewis Esq.\r\n               and elder daughter of Matthew Gregory Esq.\r\n                         who departed this life\r\n                   on the 19th day of February 1765.\r\n                      Aged 39 years and 10 months.\r\n         She was married 22 years and 5 Days During which time\r\n        She devoted herself entirely to her God and her Family.\r\n                    She lived the inimitable Pattern\r\n                  of Conjugal Affection and Goodness,\r\n                        of Filial Love and Duty,\r\n                  And of Maternal Care and Tenderness.\r\n\r\n                   Oh Death Thou hast Shewn thy Sting\r\n                Oh Death Thou hast Obtained thy Victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Also the Body of\r\n                             William Lewis\r\n                    who died the 27th of April 1774\r\n                             Aged 53 years\r\n                 His Remains were brought from England\r\n                      according to His own request\r\n                      and Deposited in this Place\r\n                           near those of his\r\n                     Affectionate and beloved Wife.\r\n\r\nFor Beckford Town, now little more than a name, the land was given by\r\nRichard Beckford, one of the family of that name, which numbered in it\r\nsome of Jamaica’s most wealthy planters.\r\n\r\nUnder date January 5, 1660–61, Pepys wrote: “The great Tom Fuller come\r\nto me to desire a kindness for a friend of his who hath a mind to go to\r\nJamaica with these two ships that are going, which I promised to do.”\r\nThe friend, Peter Beckford, quitted England in search of adventures, and\r\nsettled in Jamaica, where he rose to considerable wealth as a planter.\r\nHe did not, as Bridges suggests, fly from Cromwell’s tyranny, for the\r\nRestoration had taken place before he left England. In 1663 the name of\r\nBeckford appears amongst the planters of St.-Thomas-in-the-Vale. Colonel\r\nPeter Beckford, a son of the immigrant, was elected member of the\r\nAssembly under Lord Carlisle, who must have been—if we are to believe\r\nNichols in his “Herald and Genealogist” and Burke in his “History of the\r\nCommoners”—a man of somewhat humble estate in spite of his high\r\nancestry, for they tell us that Sir Thomas Beckford, sheriff of London,\r\nand Colonel Peter Beckford, governor of Jamaica, were brothers—both sons\r\nof a tailor of Maidenhead. Lord Braybrooke, in his notes to Pepy’s\r\nDiary, says that Sir Thomas and Colonel Peter were uncle and nephew, the\r\nformer being a son of the tailor. Colonel Beckford was elected member\r\nfor St. Catherine in the Assembly which met on April 26, 1675. He\r\nafterwards served in several Assemblies for the parishes of St. James,\r\nClarendon and St. Dorothy. He was then called to the Council and became\r\nits president. On the death of the Governor, Major-General Selwyn, on\r\nApril 5, 1702, when the Legislature was sitting, Colonel Beckford, who\r\nhad a dormant commission of old date, caused himself to be proclaimed\r\nlieutenant-governor. In his speech to the Assembly he said, “I have gone\r\nthrough most of the offices of this Island, though with no great\r\napplause, yet without complaint.” The manner of his death has been\r\nalready narrated in the account of St. Catherine. His personal wealth,\r\nwhich was said to have amounted to £478,000, and his real estate to as\r\nmuch more, gained for him great influence with the planters. This wealth\r\nwas inherited by his son Peter, the speaker of the Assembly above\r\nmentioned. His second son, Thomas, married “en secondes noces” Mary\r\nBallard (apparently a cousin) and had three sons; the eldest, Ballard\r\nBeckford, who married a daughter of John Clark, Governor of New York,\r\nwas expelled from the House “during the continuance of this Assembly” in\r\n1739, for adultery with the wife of another member, Manning, the member\r\nfor Kingston. At his death his estate was in debt, and an Act was passed\r\nto enable certain properties to be sold. The second, Thomas, married a\r\ndaughter of Robert Byndloss, the brother-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan, of\r\nbuccaneering fame, and their daughter and sole heiress married firstly\r\nJohn Palmer, and secondly Edward Long, the historian. Thomas Beckford\r\nhimself, who sat in the Assembly for St. Catherine, and was elected\r\nspeaker in 1727 and 1728, died in 1731, “slain, it is believed, in an\r\nencounter with one Cargill,” probably Captain Richard Cargill, member\r\nfor Vere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FORT WILLIAM—AQUEDUCT\r\n]\r\n\r\nPeter Beckford, the speaker, married Bathshua, daughter and co-heiress\r\nof Colonel Julines Herring, of Jamaica. He was elected member of\r\nAssembly for Port Royal in 1704, and in the next Assembly of 1705 was\r\nchosen for three parishes, St. James, Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth,\r\nbut elected to sit for the last named. He continued to serve as a member\r\nin every Assembly of the island until his death—in the early part of the\r\ntime generally for St. Elizabeth, in the later for St. Catherine. As\r\nmember for the former parish he was five times chosen speaker—in 1707,\r\n1708–9, 1711, 1713, 1716. At this time he applied to be deputy secretary\r\nof the island, under a deputation from William Congreve, but the\r\nGovernor (Lord Archibald Hamilton) refused to accept him on the ground\r\nthat he was “the chief actor in all the unhappy differences in the\r\ncountry.” He was comptroller of her Majesty’s customs. He died in 1735,\r\naged 61. From the votes of the Assembly we learn that he bequeathed the\r\nsum of £1000 to the poor of the parish of St. Catherine. This sum was\r\nused in the formation of a school: it is now merged with the Smith\r\nbequest in the Beckford and Smith School at Spanish Town. In the\r\n“Gentleman’s Magazine” for December 1735 he is said to have left nearly\r\n£300,000. Besides mortgages and similar investments, he had no less than\r\ntwenty-four plantations and twelve hundred slaves of his own in the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PORT WILLIAM ESTATE\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe had thirteen children. The eldest, Peter, was member of the Assembly\r\nfor Westmoreland in 1728, while his father was sitting for St.\r\nCatherine, and his uncle for Port Royal. He died unmarried in 1737, aged\r\n31. On his death his fortune went to his brother William, afterwards\r\nLord Mayor of London, whose son was the celebrated William Beckford, of\r\n“Vathek” and Fonthill fame.\r\n\r\nA younger brother of the Lord Mayor, Richard Beckford, who was M.P. for\r\nBristol, had a natural son, William Beckford, who visited his father’s\r\nJamaica estates. His mother was Elizabeth Hay. He married his cousin,\r\nCharlotte Hay, daughter of Thomas Hay, formerly Island Secretary of\r\nJamaica; and he impaled with his father’s arms those of the Hays—on a\r\nfield argent, three escutcheons gules: but in preference to the bend\r\nsinister, the usual mark of illegitimacy, he added the less-known badge,\r\nthe fimbria or border. Richard Beckford by his will trusted to the\r\njustice of his brother Julines to convey—to trustees in trust for his\r\nreputed son William—Roaring River and such other estates in Jamaica as\r\nhad come into Julines’ possession by virtue of an agreement between\r\nthem, and accordingly he bequeathed these properties to his reputed son\r\nWilliam, who, on his coming of age, executed a deed in 1765, which was\r\nregistered at Spanish Town in 1766, a deed to bar the entail in favour\r\nof another, who, however, subsequently re-conveyed it to him. He is\r\ntherein described as “of Balls, in the County of Hartford (_sic_), Esq.”\r\nIn a later deed, recorded in 1773, he is described as late of Balls, but\r\nnow of Summerley (_sic_) Hall.\r\n\r\nOne of his earliest works was “Remarks on the Situation of Negroes in\r\nJamaica,” 1788; and he published in 1794 a “History of France from the\r\nmost early records to the death of Louis XVI,” the early part of which\r\nis by Beckford, and the more modern by an anonymous Englishman who had\r\nbeen some time resident in Paris. But the work by which he is best known\r\nis “A Descriptive Account of the Island of Jamaica; with remarks upon\r\nthe cultivation of the Sugar-cane, throughout the different seasons of\r\nthe year, and chiefly considered in a picturesque point of view; also\r\nobservations and reflections upon what would probably be the\r\nconsequences of an abolition of the slave-trade and of the emancipation\r\nof the Slaves,” published in two volumes in London in 1790. The title\r\nfully describes the contents. It is a work of no considerable merit, and\r\ndisplaying none of the genius which might have been expected of a near\r\nrelative of the author of “Vathek.” From the dedication we learn that\r\nthe author enjoyed the friendship of the Duke of Dorset, to whom it is\r\naddressed, and from the preface that the work was written in the Fleet\r\nprison—a strange residence for one who would claim kinship with the\r\nowner of Fonthill. His position was, he says, the consequence of\r\n“imprudences which I might have prevented, and of misfortunes which I\r\ncould not foresee”—a subject which is constantly referred to throughout\r\nthe book. Besides suffering from the great hurricane of 1780, he was\r\nevidently deceived by some friend for whom he had become security.\r\n\r\nHe intended to illustrate his work with engravings from “some particular\r\nviews of the island that were taken on the spot” by George Robertson,\r\nbut pecuniary reasons obliged him to desist. He devotes several pages to\r\nthe praises of this artist’s work, comparing him—with an enthusiasm\r\nwhich does more credit to his kindness of heart than to his faculties as\r\nan art critic—to Claude Lorrain, Gaspard Poussin and Salvator Rosa, and\r\nhe concludes: “It is a pity that more of his drawings are not engraved;\r\nof the numerous and interesting views he took in Jamaica, only six have\r\nmet the public eye, although there are many that richly deserve to be\r\nremoved from dust and oblivion. The names of Robertson and Earlom, to\r\nthe same plate, could not fail to render them immortal.”\r\n\r\nIn 1778 John Boydell published a series of six engravings from paintings\r\nby George Robertson, by Thomas Vivares, James Mason and David\r\nLerpiniere. They are all dedicated to William Beckford, Esq. They\r\nrepresent: (1) Part of the Rio Cobre, near Spanish Town; (ii) Roaring\r\nRiver Estate; (iii) Fort William Estate, with part of Roaring River\r\nbelonging to William Beckford, Esq., near Savanna-la-Mar; (iv) Bridge\r\ncrossing Cabarita River; (v) The Spring Head of Roaring River on the\r\nEstate of William Beckford, Esq.; (vi) The Bridge crossing the Rio\r\nCobre, near Spanish Town.\r\n\r\nTwo of the original paintings are in the possession of Mrs. C. E. de\r\nMercado, of Kingston.\r\n\r\nAs, with the exception of Hakewill and John Bartholomew Kidd, R.S.A.,\r\nGeorge Robertson is the only artist of any importance who has devoted\r\nhis pencil to portraying the beauties of Jamaica, a few notes about him\r\nmay prove of interest. The facts recorded about him by Redgrave are\r\nsomewhat scanty. Born in London, he was the son of a wine merchant, and\r\nwas brought up to that business. He studied in Shipley’s school, and in\r\n1761 he gained a Society of Arts premium for his drawings of horses.\r\nThis brought him to the notice of William Beckford, with whom he\r\ntravelled in Italy, and studied, chiefly at Rome, during several years.\r\nHe returned to London about 1770, and although Beckford tried to push\r\nhis fortunes for him, he was not very successful, and he was induced to\r\naccompany his patron to Jamaica. He painted views in the island, and,\r\nreturning to England, exhibited pictures of Jamaica scenes, twenty-six\r\nin all, with the Incorporated Society of Artists (of which body he was\r\nfor some time vice-president) from 1775 to 1778. Most of them appeared\r\nas “A View in Jamaica.” The names given are =Roaring River=, =Fort\r\nWilliam= and =Williamsfield=. These views were admired, and when\r\nengraved created some interest; but he received no better encouragement\r\nthan before, and he had to have recourse to teaching and making drawings\r\nfor the dealers, to support his wife and children, till a bequest from\r\nan uncle happily relieved him from anxiety. Never of robust health, a\r\nfall from a horse increased his infirmity. He died in 1788, before he\r\nreached his fortieth year. He occasionally painted subject pieces,\r\naiming at the “grand style,” and his “St. Martin dividing his cloak” is\r\nin Vintners’ Hall, London. But his principal talents lay in the\r\ndirection of landscape. “His compositions,” Redgrave says, “were too\r\nscenic, his trees, though spirited, were fanciful and exuberant in their\r\nforms, yet his works are by no means without merit.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROARING RIVER ESTATE IN 1774\r\n\r\n  From an engraving by Thomas Vivares after a painting by George\r\n    Robertson\r\n]\r\n\r\nWilliam Beckford also employed in Jamaica the talents of Philip\r\nWickstead, a portrait painter, a pupil of Zoffany, and distinguished by\r\nhis small whole-length portraits, whose acquaintance he had made in Rome\r\nin 1773. He accompanied his patron to Jamaica, and practised his art for\r\na considerable time in the island. He speculated as a planter, but was\r\nunsuccessful. Losses led to drink, and his life was thereby shortened.\r\nHe died before 1790. Beckford said of him, his “powers of painting were\r\nconsiderably weakened by his natural indolence, and more than all, by a\r\nwonderful eccentricity of character. His colouring was almost equal to\r\nthat of any artist of his time, and the freedom and execution of his\r\npencil were particularly apparent in his representation of negroes of\r\nevery character, expression and age.” Unfortunately many of Wickstead’s\r\ndrawings perished in the hurricane of 1780.\r\n\r\nIn biographical dictionaries William Beckford is styled an historian,\r\nand, as we have seen, he wrote part of a History of France, but in his\r\nwork on Jamaica he was content to reprint his historical facts from the\r\n“Jamaica Almanack” of the day, and apparently he did not know the year\r\nof the discovery of the island by Columbus, for he twice gives a wrong\r\ndate, and his date for the Port Royal earthquake is also wrong. Much may\r\nbe excused, however, in an historian who wrote in the Fleet prison.\r\n\r\nOne trait he had in common with his kinsman and namesake—a true love of\r\nnature and the picturesque. But his description of the natural beauties\r\nof the island is couched in the somewhat high-flown style of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe following is part of his description of the great hurricane which\r\ndestroyed Savanna-la-Mar in 1780:\r\n\r\n  At Savanna-la-Mar, there was not even a vestige of a town (the parts\r\n  only of two or three houses having in partial ruin remained, as if to\r\n  indicate the situation and extent of the calamity); the very materials\r\n  of which it had been composed had been carried away by the resistless\r\n  fury of the waves, which finally completed what the wind began. A very\r\n  great proportion of the poor inhabitants were crushed to death or\r\n  drowned; and in one house alone, it was computed that forty, out of\r\n  one and forty souls, unhappily and prematurely perished. The sea drove\r\n  with progressive violence for more than a mile into the country; and\r\n  carried terror, as it left destruction, wherever it passed. Two large\r\n  ships and a schooner were at anchor in the bay, but were driven a\r\n  considerable distance from the shore, and totally wrecked among the\r\n  mango-trees upon land.\r\n\r\nHe concludes his description thus:\r\n\r\n  “Having resided for some time in that delightful country, from which\r\n  the most celebrated painters of landscape have made their principal\r\n  studies; and having always travelled with those who loved, or were\r\n  professors of the Art; and having accompanied the latter in all their\r\n  walks, and followed their imitations upon the easel, it is not\r\n  unnatural to suppose that I should catch, as it were by reflection, a\r\n  small portion of their curiosity, and endeavour to follow, at a\r\n  distance, those rays which have warmed, although they have not been\r\n  able to illuminate. As one, therefore, who has observed Nature with\r\n  more enthusiasm than taste, I must decide in favour of the rich and\r\n  magnificent scenery of the West Indies, in preference to any rural\r\n  appearances I have observed in other countries; and I should dwell\r\n  with more pertinacity upon this opinion, were they, by contrast, more\r\n  observed and better known.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Beckford was born in Jamaica in 1744.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 or 1768 he went abroad with “two others” (William Fullerton and\r\nGlover) under the travelling preceptorship of Patrick Brydone, traveller\r\nand author, and made a somewhat extensive tour. Fullerton, after a most\r\nsuccessful career in India, became known, from his conduct of the first\r\ncommissionership of the government of Trinidad, as “the persecutor of\r\nPicton.” Beckford spent nearly thirteen years (between 1773 and 1788) in\r\nJamaica, on his estates, Fort William and Roaring River, near\r\nSavanna-la-Mar, now the property of Miss G. C. Hay. Of the works at\r\nRoaring River almost all that remain are two stones, one of which bears\r\nthe date 1737 and the other the Beckford crest, a heron’s head with a\r\nfish in its beak, with the date 1778. On page 392 of his work he says,\r\n“When I left Jamaica in the year 1777.” This is an evident misprint for\r\n1788 or 1789. He also owned Williamsfield, and is said to have owned the\r\nfollowing properties, also in Westmoreland: The Crawl, Hertford Pen,\r\nHatfield Pen and Smithfield Wharf. During all these years he apparently\r\nnever visited the north side of the island. He is mentioned in the\r\nJamaica Almanacs from 1782 to 1788 (after which date his name\r\ndisappears) as a magistrate for Westmoreland. Much as he admired its\r\nscenery, the island of Jamaica evidently had for him unpleasant\r\nmemories. He alludes to it as “that spot upon which it was my unhappy\r\nfortune for so many years of my life to reside.” The only records of his\r\nsojourn in Jamaica are Beckford street at Savanna-la-Mar, and Beckford\r\nLodge, a small holding near that town, and the mark R/WB which is still\r\nused for the rum exported from Roaring River. On his return voyage to\r\nEngland he passed the Cayman Islands, landing at Grand Cayman. In 1788\r\nhe published his “Remarks on the Situation of Negroes in Jamaica.” He\r\nretired to his estate at Somerly in Suffolk, which he had evidently\r\nowned as early as 1773. He then spent, as we have seen, some time, about\r\n1790–91, in the Fleet prison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAVANNA-LA-MAR IN 1840\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe died on February 4, 1799, of an apoplectic fit at the Earl of\r\nEffingham’s in Wimpole street, London. His pecuniary losses had probably\r\nled him to sell his property in Suffolk, for he is described as “late of\r\nSomerly Hall.” The Earl of Effingham mentioned is Richard the fourth\r\nearl, nephew to Thomas second earl, who had married a sister of Lord\r\nMayor Beckford in 1744, and brother to the third earl, who died while\r\nGovernor of Jamaica. Beckford evidently selected his friends from those\r\naccomplished in literature and the arts. In his writings he refers to\r\nSir William Hamilton, who was a friend of the author of “Vathek,” to\r\nBrydone, to “my friend Parsons,” the musician, to Charles Burney, nephew\r\nof Dr. Burney and Robertson and Wickstead the artists; and Dr. Burney\r\nhas told us that he was the friend of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Joseph\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\n=Negril Harbour= is sometimes called Bloody Bay, said to be due to the\r\nkilling of whales there in former times. In it is a tomb of George\r\nMurray (d. 1804), custos, who laid the foundation-stone of the church in\r\n1797. At =Cross Path= is the tomb of Colonel John Guthrie (d. 1739),\r\ncustos of the parish and colonel of the militia, who reduced the rebel\r\nnegroes who had for many years harassed the island; at =Dryworks= there\r\nis the tomb of Colonel William Williams (d. 1723), custos of the parish,\r\nwho had rendered valuable services during the hurricane of 1772, and\r\nWilliam Lewis (d. 1774), grandfather of Matthew Gregory Lewis; On the\r\nroadside near =Kew Park= is a soldier’s tomb with the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n  In the rear of this stone lie the remains of Obediah Chambers, late a\r\n  private of the Light Infantry Company W.I.R. which, on the 5th of\r\n  January 1830 fell into an ambush of rebellious slaves, near this spot,\r\n  by whom the deceased was cruelly butchered.\r\n\r\n  A brave man, & valorous in course of life here, who died a Soldier &\r\n  an honest man.\r\n\r\n  This stone is erected by the Officers & N.C. Officers of the 6th\r\n  Battn. Coy.\r\n\r\nAt =Harmony Hall= is the tomb of John Lewis (d. 1820), chief justice and\r\ncustos of the parish, and also of Mary Lewis (d. 1813). At =Three-Mile\r\nRiver= Estate is a mausoleum with a large marble slab “to the memory of\r\nJames Graham, late of this island” (d. 1795), erected by his friend John\r\nWedderburn. =Drummond= and =Indian Head= both have caves with Arawâk\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n                             ST. ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of St. Elizabeth was probably named in honour of Elizabeth,\r\nLady Modyford, the daughter of William Palmer, whose tombstone is in the\r\ncathedral. It is one of the largest parishes and one of the most\r\nimportant. In the parish church at =Black River= are memorial tablets\r\nrecalling to the memory of the living the many good qualities of the\r\ndeparted St. Elizabeth gentry. The handsomest are those on either side\r\nof the chancel to the memory of Caleb Dickenson and Robert Hugh Munro,\r\nfounders of the Munro and Dickenson’s trust, which to-day maintains two\r\nof the principal schools in the island. The Maroon township called\r\nAccompong on the northern boundary of the parish has been referred to in\r\nthe account of the neighbouring parish of St. James.\r\n\r\nRobert Hugh Munro, of the parish of St. Elizabeth, by his will dated\r\nJanuary 21, 1797, and a codicil of May 23, 1797, bequeathed the residue\r\nof his real and personal estate in certain contingencies in trust to his\r\nnephew, Caleb Dickenson, and the churchwardens of the parish of St.\r\nElizabeth, and their successors, to lay out the same in the endowment of\r\na school to be erected and maintained in the said parish, for the\r\neducation of as many poor children of the parish as the funds might be\r\nsufficient to provide for and maintain, and, if necessary, to apply to\r\nthe Legislature for an act for the regulation of the charity and to\r\ncarry out his intentions. For years after the death of Dickenson, who\r\nhad bequeathed them fully to carry out his uncle’s intentions, the funds\r\nof the Charity were applied to anything but their proper purpose, and at\r\nlength in 1825 an Act of the Legislature was passed for regulating the\r\ncharity, which recited the history of the trust up to that date, and\r\npropounded a scheme which had been agreed upon for the management of the\r\ntrust; but this commendable scheme appears never to have been carried\r\nout, and it was not until 1855 that the Act 18 Victoria, chap. 53, was\r\npassed with the object of rescuing the remains of the charity.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a Free School for boys was opened near Black River, and early in\r\n1857 the premises at Potsdam, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, were\r\npurchased and the school was removed thither. The Trust maintains two\r\nschools situated in the Santa Cruz Mountains—that for boys still at\r\n=Potsdam=; that for girls formerly at Mount Zion, now at =Hampton=.\r\n\r\nAt Lacovia, on the main road from Santa Cruz to Black River, precisely\r\nat its junction with the road from Lacovia to Balaclava, there are two\r\ntombs, side by side; the space between being only six feet. One, built\r\nof large squares of stones or rock commonly used for building purposes,\r\nis in the last stages of decay and ruin, and without any slab or\r\ninscription. The other is a high brick tomb, with a massive white marble\r\nslab on which is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                     Here lyes interr’d the body of\r\n                         Thomas Jordan Spencer.\r\n              Born Octbr. the 14^{th}, 1723, who departed\r\n                this life Sunday morning, September the\r\n                              17th, 1738.\r\n\r\nThe _Arms_ are: Quarterly argent and gules, in the second and third\r\nquarters a frette or: over all, on a bend sable, three fleurs-de-lis of\r\nthe first. The _Crest_ an esquire’s helmet.\r\n\r\nThis monument is not mentioned in Lawrence-Archer’s “Monumental\r\nInscriptions of the British West Indies.” The quartering of the shield\r\nis very much worn owing to the exposed position of the tomb.\r\n\r\nTradition says that at a tavern which formerly stood hard by, a friendly\r\nparty was interrupted by angry words which led to a duel, in which both\r\ncombatants fell, and that they were buried side by side.\r\n\r\nAt =Lacovia= estate is the tomb of Barnard Andreiss (d. 1710), custos of\r\nthe parish; =Dickenson’s Run= has Jewish tombs with inscriptions in\r\nHebrew and Portuguese. At =Pedro= is a cave with Arawâk remains, and\r\nalso at =Hounslow=. =Hampstead= great house is said to have been the\r\nsummer residence of former Jamaica governors.\r\n\r\nSome one with classic taste named =Catadupa=, a word originally applied\r\nto the cataracts of the Nile, and once used both in French and English\r\nfor a waterfall.\r\n\r\nLong, after ridiculing the tale copied by many writers that the\r\nrain-drops which fall at Magotty turn into maggots, goes on to suggest\r\nthe derivation of “_maga_ (an enchantress) and _oteo_ (watching on a\r\nhigh place); alluding probably to the pinnacle of _Monte Diablo_, over\r\nwhich the thunder clouds so frequently break, as together with its\r\nhorrid aspect to make it seem a proper residence for a witch, under\r\npatronage of the devil, to whom the mountain was dedicated.”\r\n\r\n=Surinam Quarters=, in St. Elizabeth, were settled in 1675 by planters\r\nfrom Surinam, when that colony was exchanged with the Dutch for New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n=Culloden= and =Auchindown=, in St. Elizabeth, date from the time of the\r\narrival of the ill-fated Darien refugees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n                               MANCHESTER\r\n\r\n\r\nManchester was separated from the adjoining parishes of St. Elizabeth,\r\nClarendon and Vere in 1814, and was named after the Duke of Manchester,\r\nwho was Governor of the island at the time; while the chief town,\r\nMandeville, was named after his eldest son.\r\n\r\nThe parish is more noted for its agricultural than historic\r\nassociations. Mandeville is much frequented by visitors from the United\r\nStates and Canada and Great Britain. The court-house is said to have\r\ncost upwards of £20,000. In the churchyard is the tombstone of Sir\r\nWilliam Scarlett, chief justice of the island from 1821 to 1832, who is\r\nreferred to in the account of St. James.\r\n\r\nBridges, the historian, was the rector from 1817 to 1823. In that period\r\nhe baptized 9547 slaves, and married 2187. In 1823 he published his\r\n“Voice from Jamaica,” written in defence of slave-owners, for which the\r\nAssembly two years later voted him £700. He valued his living at £1118\r\nper annum. The Rev. Samuel Stewart, writing in 1840, says: “Four large\r\nschoolhouses have been erected, one-half of the expense paid by the\r\nBishop, the other moiety by the Vestry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n                               CLARENDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish of Clarendon was named in honour of the celebrated Lord\r\nChancellor. The parish of Vere, now merged in it, was named after Vere,\r\ndaughter of Sir Edward Herbert, Attorney-General to Charles I, and first\r\nwife of Sir Thomas Lynch, who, with her two sons, died on her passage\r\nfrom England to this island in 1683.\r\n\r\n=Carlisle Bay=, the scene of the principal military engagement with a\r\nforeign foe which has taken place in Jamaica during the British\r\noccupation, is on the south-west coast of the old parish of Vere.\r\n\r\nMuch of the following account is taken from “A Narrative of the Descent\r\non Jamaica by the French,” by Sir William Beeston, in the MSS.\r\ndepartment of the British Museum. It is printed in “Interesting Tracts\r\nrelating to the Island of Jamaica,” published at St. Jago de la Vega in\r\n1800. A letter from the Council in England in answer to Beeston’s\r\nnarrative is also in the British Museum, and a contemporary account of\r\nthe occurrence sworn to at Bermuda on October 2, 1694, by Benjamin\r\nThornton, master of the sloop _Content_, is in the Record Office at\r\nBermuda. Beeston came to the island in 1660, was employed in various\r\npublic capacities, and was lieutenant-governor from 1690 to 1700, and\r\nthenceforward Governor till 1702; he is chiefly famous for the defence,\r\nwhich he made, together with Colonel Long, against the attempt by Lord\r\nCarlisle to assimilate the government of Jamaica to that of Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor some time prior to the engagement at Carlisle Bay the owners of the\r\nplantations on the sea coast of Jamaica had been much distressed by\r\ndescents by French privateers (aided in some cases by disaffected\r\npersons from the island itself who threw in their lot with them) from\r\nSan Domingo and the Leeward Islands, who plundered and murdered as\r\noccasion offered.\r\n\r\nCaptain Du Casse—the Governor of San Domingo, perhaps best known in\r\nEngland as the opponent to Benbow in the engagement which ended in the\r\nlatter’s death—being informed by two renegade Irishmen that the “island\r\nwas easily taken; the fortifications at Port Royal were out of order and\r\nfew men there, so that two hundred men would take that place, and two\r\nhundred more would march in any part of the country the people were so\r\nthin and so little used to arms,” and, being reinforced by three\r\nmen-of-war from France, decided to make a descent on the island. In the\r\nmeantime a Captain Elliott, of Jamaica, who had been taken prisoner into\r\nPetit Goave, on the west coast of San Domingo, by French privateers, and\r\nwas probably the Captain Stephen Elliott who brought to England the news\r\nof the great earthquake at Port Royal in 1692, managed to escape to\r\nJamaica in a small canoe, and give timely warning on May 31, 1694, that\r\nDu Casse himself, with twenty sail and 3000 men, was coming to take the\r\nisland. For this he was subsequently rewarded by William III with a gold\r\nchain and medal of £100 value and £500 in money.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of Elliott’s news the House of Assembly, which was then\r\nsitting, was adjourned for one month, a council of war was called\r\ntogether, martial law proclaimed, and every officer ordered to his post.\r\nColonel Beckford (grandfather of the celebrated Lord Mayor of London),\r\nwho was in command at Port Royal, got Fort Charles into excellent order\r\nand fortified the town. A fort also was built in the Parade at Kingston;\r\nthe pass by Rock Fort to the east of Kingston was guarded, and\r\nbreastworks were erected at Old Harbour and Carlisle Bay. Beeston,\r\nrealising that it was hopeless with the forces at command to try to\r\nprotect all his coast-line, decided to defend the strongest parts, and\r\ndrew all the forces from the out ports into St. Dorothy (a parish now\r\nmerged in St. Catherine), St. Catherine, St. Andrew and Port Royal; and\r\n“some few” were left to defend the breastwork at Carlisle Bay. The\r\npeople from St. Thomas and St. David, the most exposed positions, were\r\ncalled into St. Andrew and Kingston.\r\n\r\nAt Fort William and Port Morant the guns were spiked, the shot buried,\r\nand the powder brought away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARLISLE BAY\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe French fleet, consisting of three men-of-war and twenty-three\r\ntransports, appeared in the offing on June 17. Rollon, the admiral,\r\nsailed in the _Téméraire_, of fifty-four guns. Eight ships stayed about\r\nPort Morant, but the remainder went into Cow Bay, near Yallahs, where\r\nthey laid waste the country, plundered the houses, murdered what\r\ninhabitants they could find, and generally behaved with barbarity.\r\n\r\nOn July 15 the fleet, having done all the damage it could in the\r\nneighbourhood of Port Morant, set sail, and after reconnoitring Port\r\nRoyal, put into Cow Bay the next day. Fearing an attack on Kingston by\r\nland, Beeston sent a hundred men from St. Catherine to reinforce the\r\ntroops guarding the Windward road; but on the morning of the 18th he saw\r\nseventeen ships making, as he rightly judged, for Carlisle Bay, thirty\r\nsix miles from Spanish Town. He took prompt action. He sent to Carlisle\r\nBay two troops of horse, and parts of the regiments of St. Catherine,\r\nClarendon and St. Elizabeth, the foot to be mounted on what horses they\r\ncould find. The cavalry and the mounted infantry got there that night,\r\nand those on foot “marched so hard” that they arrived by ten the next\r\nmorning. The enemy had anchored in Carlisle Bay on the afternoon of the\r\n18th. The editor of the earliest edition of the “Laws of Jamaica,”\r\npublished in 1683, refers to “Carlisle Bay, a safe Road for Shipping,\r\nand there is likewise built a pretty Town of that name, of about 100\r\nHouses which has a fine Trade, that also increases, as the Country does\r\nin Plantations.”\r\n\r\nInto the breastwork, which was commanded by Colonel Sutton of Clarendon,\r\nwho had constructed it, were packed 250 men, in addition to negroes,\r\nbeing those of the several regiments that had come in during the night.\r\nBeeston tells us that the fort was ill-made and worse contrived. “On the\r\nsouth was the sea, on the west a large river [the Rio Minho], and on the\r\neast they had left a wood standing,” which formed a natural covert for\r\nthe enemy. They also failed to lay in provisions for either man or\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nBy daylight on the morning of the 19th the enemy had landed about 1400\r\nor 1500 men about a mile and a half to the east of the breastwork, where\r\nthe small guard, after firing on them, retreated to the breastwork,\r\nwhich the French attacked so hotly that the defenders had to retreat\r\nover the river, not, however, before they had fought bravely and killed\r\nmany of the enemy. Just as the French forced the breastwork three or\r\nfour companies of the St. Catherine regiment and one of the St.\r\nElizabeth and some horse came in, weary, footsore and hungry with their\r\nmarch of about thirty-six miles from Spanish Town. Yet they fell on\r\nbravely on the right of the enemy and charged them so warmly that they\r\nnot only prevented them from pursuing the party that had crossed the\r\nriver, but made them retire.\r\n\r\nNothing but skirmishes took place till Sunday the 22nd, when the French\r\nmarched upwards till they came to the house of a certain Mr. Hubbard,\r\nwhich was garrisoned with twenty men and well provisioned. Local\r\ntradition says that this stood where Gales, a hamlet now occupied by the\r\nCoolie barracks on Amity Hall estate, now is. Bridges, in his “Annals,”\r\nwriting in 1828, said: “The brick house in which so gallant a stand was\r\nmade, remains with the shot visible in its walls, and a solitary cotton\r\ntree in the road from the Abbey [_sic_, Alley] to Carlisle Bay still\r\nmarks the rallying-point of the English and the grave of many a valiant\r\nsoldier.” An attack on this house by the French resulted in the loss of\r\nseveral of their best officers, as the besieged were aided by a\r\ndetachment from the Bay. On hearing that a more determined attack was\r\nintended on the morrow, Major Richard Lloyd, who was chosen to command,\r\nput fifty men into the house and prepared an ambuscade. But the French,\r\nfinding that they had lost so many of their officers and men, and that\r\nthey could not penetrate further into the country, contented themselves\r\nwith firing the small town of Carlisle, spiking the guns and doing what\r\nmischief they could, and then retreated to their ships. On Tuesday,\r\n24th, the whole fleet sailed—Du Casse and two or three ships going\r\nstraight back to San Domingo, the rest staying only to put into Port\r\nMorant to wood and water and land prisoners. And thus ended the most\r\nserious attempt at the capture of Jamaica ever made upon its shores\r\nduring the English occupation.\r\n\r\nBeeston estimates that the French lost on the expedition, by their\r\ndifferent engagements and sickness, about 700 men; of these about 550\r\nwere killed at Carlisle Bay, albeit Père Labat puts it down at 150 only.\r\nOn the English side 100 were killed or wounded; but 50 sugar-works were\r\ndestroyed and many plantations burnt, and about 1300 negroes carried\r\noff. Du Casse received a pension of 100 pistoles per annum.\r\n\r\nA sum of £4000 was received as a royal bounty to the sufferers by the\r\nFrench invasion. When called upon by the House of Assembly to account\r\nfor it, Beeston declined; and the House, refusing to proceed with\r\nbusiness, was dissolved by him. The matter was subsequently allowed to\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\nColonel Richard Lloyd, alluded to above, who was chief justice of\r\nJamaica in 1696–98, entered, however, a caveat with the Council of Trade\r\nand Plantations, received by them on April 26, 1699, against the late\r\nact of Assembly for a present of £1500 to Sir William Beeston. He says:\r\n“The pretence for giving him this money is to reward his care in the\r\ntime of the French invasion of that island. I was a principal actor\r\nagainst them at that time, and have a journal of the whole affair. It\r\nwill be ready for the press by the beginning of next week. I intend to\r\ndedicate it to your Lordships, and think it may induce you to think he\r\ndeserves not to be gratified for his behaviour on that occasion.” If the\r\njournal was ever printed, no copy is now known to exist. It is difficult\r\nto say where the truth lay in the dispute, at a time when corruption was\r\nrife in high places.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this descent of the French, the Government set to work\r\nto guard the coast as well as it could, and Carlisle Fort was built the\r\nfollowing year. When Leslie wrote in 1740 “A New History of Jamaica,”\r\nthe fort was “now in ruins and little regarded.” There is little left of\r\nit now, and that little is in the sea—part being shown in the\r\nillustration on page 375.\r\n\r\nWhen Long wrote his “History” in 1774, the town of Carlisle, so-called\r\nin honour of the Earl of Carlisle, who was governor in 1678–80, was only\r\na hamlet of ten or twelve houses near the mouth of the Rio Minho, or, as\r\nit is sometimes called the Dry River. Now all that is left is Carlisle\r\nestate and one house at the Bay. As the mouth of the river is known to\r\nhave moved of late years considerably further to the east, it is\r\nprobably about the site of this house, now about half a mile from the\r\nriver mouth, that the French landed.\r\n\r\nIn those days the parish of Vere, which was formerly called Withywood,\r\nwas very thickly wooded. Later the trees were cut down to make way for\r\nthe sugar-cane, which still holds its own, thanks to the adoption of the\r\ncentral factory system.\r\n\r\nWithywood took its name, Long tells us in his History (1774), from its\r\nhaving been\r\n\r\n  formerly overspread with wood and withes when the English first\r\n  settled upon it, and which grew so thick that it was impossible to\r\n  walk among them without a cutlass to clear the way. This is the part\r\n  which, on account of its rich soil, was afterwards filled with indigo\r\n  and sugar works, the opulence of whose owners is spoken of by several\r\n  writers; and though it has been called in question by some, yet it is\r\n  very certain that more carriages of pleasure were at one time kept\r\n  there than in all the rest of the island, Spanish Town only excepted.\r\n  It is indeed almost incredible to think that vast fortunes were made\r\n  here by cultivation of this simple commodity.\r\n\r\nAnd in describing the cultivation of Jamaica:\r\n\r\n  There were formerly upwards of seventy gentlemen’s carriages kept in\r\n  the parish of Vere, the vast profits of their indigo works enabled\r\n  them to live in such splendour; and that part of the country for its\r\n  number of houses and inhabitants, on both sides of the Rio Minho\r\n  resembled a populous town.\r\n\r\nOne may compare with this Rampini’s account of 1873, just one hundred\r\nyears later than Long:\r\n\r\n  How can we describe the unutterably bare and barren character of the\r\n  scenery between the Alley and Four Paths, our half-way station on the\r\n  road to Chapelton?\r\n\r\n  Dusty roads, bordered with stunted logwood trees for miles; then dusty\r\n  roads without the logwood trees; then a dry river course full of rough\r\n  stones, which broke our buggy springs, and delayed us an hour to have\r\n  them tied up with ropes and branches; then more dusty roads and\r\n  logwood trees, and then dusty roads without logwood trees as before.\r\n  Not a bird to be seen, not a butterfly on the wing; not a bit of\r\n  colour, except a stray orchid or two, to break the drear monotony of\r\n  the landscape.\r\n\r\nRampini evidently visited Vere during a period of drought; or when he\r\nwas suffering from dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nWithywood appears as Wither Wood in Blome’s map of 1671, which is copied\r\nin Long’s History as “according to a survey made in the year MDCLXX.”\r\nThe name does not appear on modern maps, though it was used as late as\r\n1728 in the Journals of the House of Assembly. The village that has\r\narisen around the old church is now known as Alley. Remains of the old\r\nindigo works are still to be seen here and there in the cane pieces, and\r\nindigo grows as a weed. There cotton was formerly cultivated\r\nextensively. As late as 1808 Vere had some cotton plantations, while at\r\nthe same time there were thirty sugar estates. Cotton is again being\r\ngrown there.\r\n\r\nVere, from 1673 to 1867, was a distinct parish of Jamaica, albeit it\r\nlost part of its area when Manchester was formed in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe =Church= itself, with its magnificent old cotton tree, forms one of\r\nthe most attractive pictures of a simple type in Jamaica, and approaches\r\nmore nearly to an English village church in character than any other in\r\nthe colony. Built of brick, with stone quoins, it is a serviceable\r\nstructure which has successfully withstood earthquake and hurricane\r\nsince it was constructed in the earlier part of the 18th century, about\r\n1715–35. It was originally a squat building about 33 ft. wide and some\r\n48 ft. long with the present tower. The eastern end was erected and\r\nconsecrated in 1872. Some monuments which Lawrence-Archer recorded are\r\nnow covered by the flooring of the seats in the nave. On the other hand,\r\nsome which he did not record are now visible in the nave.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1671, a petition was submitted to the Council by\r\nChristopher Horner, George Osborne, John Aldred, George Child, Tho.\r\nCoswell, Jno. Warren, Wm. Hinkston, Robt. Smith, James Jenner, Jno.\r\nDowner, and Phi. Robarts, inhabitants of Withywood and Dry River:\r\n\r\n  “that whereas His Excellency had recommended Mr. Lander to them for\r\n  their minister, and they had bought land and were building him a\r\n  church, and had provided him a competent maintenance, pray they may\r\n  not be liable to contribute to any other church within the parish.”\r\n  This was “referred to the next General Assembly in regard the justices\r\n  and vestry men of every parish are empowered by Act of the General\r\n  Assembly to lay such assessments and parish duties as they shall think\r\n  requisite and that power cannot be taken from them by the Governor and\r\n  Council only.”\r\n\r\nThere was a church in Withywood, although no parson, as early as 1675.\r\nSir Thomas Lynch, writing in May of that year, says,\r\n\r\n  None but these four parishes, Port Royal, St. Catherine, St. John and\r\n  St. Andrew, are supplied, though there are 14 in the island. In Vere\r\n  or Withywood there is a church, and that and Clarendon parish\r\n  adjoining are able and willing to give a minister £100 per annum.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Council held at St. Jago de la Vega on February 19,\r\n1693,\r\n\r\n  The Council being acquainted that Mr. Samuell Cook, Rector of the\r\n  parish of Vere, was attending at the Door, To answer for a Certaine\r\n  Remonstrance by him writt and published, was ordered to be called in.\r\n  Then the Clerke of the Councill was ordered to read the same in his\r\n  presence. Acknowledged his Error and promised to give a Recantation\r\n  under his hand and presented to this board which he did accordingly\r\n  and was accepted of.\r\n\r\nIn a list of the Parishes, Churches and Ministers in Jamaica, April 18,\r\n1715, under Vere is recorded “a church rebuilding” but no rector’s name\r\nis given.\r\n\r\nIn 1737 the Committee appointed by the Assembly to inspect the list of\r\ndockets of the charitable devises and donations in the Secretary’s\r\noffice, drew up and submitted a very interesting analysis of the list,\r\nparish by parish.\r\n\r\nSo far as Vere is concerned we find that:\r\n\r\n  William Gibbons gave £20 for a communion plate; George Forsett in 1680\r\n  gave £10 for a church Bible and pulpit cloth; Andrew Knight in 1683\r\n  gave £20 to the church and poor; Hugh Gurge in 1687 gave £10 towards\r\n  building a church; Magdalen Fawcett in 1688 gave £10 to the poor, and\r\n  £10 for the minister and pall; Joseph Taylor in 1689 gave fourteen\r\n  acres of land for the minister and poor; John Moore in 1690 gave £150\r\n  towards building a church; Christian Flyer in 1715 gave £50 towards\r\n  building a wall round the church [then being built]; Nathaniel Skeen\r\n  in 1721 gave £100 for ornaments for the pulpit and pall; and Robert\r\n  Cargill in 1731 gave £30 towards building the church.\r\n\r\nThe principal monuments in the church are those to the Morants, the\r\nGales and the Suttons, families long and honourably connected with\r\nJamaica history as members of the Council and the Assembly and in other\r\ncapacities; the Gales having, however, more to do with St. Elizabeth and\r\nWestmoreland than Vere. John Gale (1680–1721), the general Baptist\r\nMinister, son of Nathaniel Gale, “an eminent citizen” who had property\r\nin the West Indies, was evidently connected with this family. Colonel\r\nJonathan Gale was custos of St. Elizabeth, and member for St. Elizabeth\r\n1709–11, and for Westmoreland 1721–26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE ALLEY CHURCH\r\n]\r\n\r\nVere gave but two speakers to the Assembly from among its members,\r\nAndrew Langley and William Pusey, but among its representatives were\r\nthose bearing the well-known names of Ivy, Sutton, Vassall, Cargill,\r\nBeckford, Lawes, Morant, Dawkins, Nedham and Batty. Andrew Knight, who\r\nwas its member in 1677–79, was, his tombstone tells us, custos of\r\nClarendon and Vere, and he was probably its first custos.\r\n\r\nJohn Morant settled in Jamaica soon after the occupation. His son John\r\nMorant, Custos of Clarendon and Vere, married Mary Pennant, aunt of the\r\nfirst Lord Penrhyn.\r\n\r\nEdward Morant, son of John, represented Vere in 1752, 1754, in both the\r\nAssembly of 1755, and in 1756. He was called up to the Council in 1757,\r\nleft Jamaica in 1760, and purchased Brockenhurst manor, which is owned\r\nby his descendants. In 1761 he was elected M.P. for Hindon. On July 16,\r\n1791, as he was driving in Kensington, his horses took fright, when he\r\nwas precipitated from his carriage, carried home senseless, and died\r\nfour days afterwards. He married first in Clarendon, June 10, 1754,\r\nEleanor Angelina, widow of William Dawkins, member for Portland in 1749,\r\nand St. Thomas in the Vale in 1752, whose tombstone in Clarendon old\r\nchurch is inscribed:\r\n\r\n                         Here lieth the Body of\r\n                        William Dawkins Esqre.,\r\n                        of this Parish, who died\r\n                         the 14th of December,\r\n                          1752, aged 26 years.\r\n\r\nEdward Morant married secondly in England, April 22, 1762, a Miss\r\nGoddard, grand-daughter and only remaining descendant of President John\r\nGregory, who twice administered the government of Jamaica, on the\r\nrefusal of Edward Pennant, the senior member of the Council, to act in\r\nthat capacity.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Morant, daughter of John Morant, the younger, and sister of\r\nEdward, married in Vere, January 11, 1753–54, her cousin, William Gale,\r\nwho represented Hanover in 1754 and 1755, and St. John in the second\r\nAssembly of 1755, and in 1756. He was the younger son of John Gale, the\r\nmember of Council, who in 1747 first settled the estate of York (from\r\nthe county of his ancestors) in this parish, and died 1749–50. Another\r\nmural monument in the church commemorates his elder son, a younger\r\ndaughter, himself and his daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nLawrence-Archer records Colonel Thomas Sutton, who played an important\r\npart in the successful repulse of the French at Carlisle Bay in 1694;\r\nbut the monument is no longer to be seen. It probably is hidden by the\r\nflooring of the nave. It is to be regretted that copies of the\r\ninscriptions were not taken before they were covered up.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting accounts of the earthquake which destroyed\r\nPort Royal in 1692 is “The Truest and Largest Account of the Late\r\nEarthquake in Jamaica, June the 7th, 1692, Written by a Reverend Divine\r\nthere to his Friend in London. With some Improvement thereof by another\r\nHand. London: Printed, and are to be sold by J. Buttler, Bookseller at\r\nWorcester, 1693,” of which a copy is in the library of the Institute of\r\nJamaica, and a reprint is given in the second volume of the “Journal of\r\nthe Institute of Jamaica.” It is dated “Withywood, in the parish of\r\nVere, June 30th, 1692.” Nothing is known for certain of the author. He\r\nwas probably the Thomas Hardwicke who was made rector of Vere by the\r\nEarl of Carlisle in 1678. The following extract shows how Vere fared in\r\nthe great calamity:\r\n\r\n  It overthrew all the Brick and Stone buildings in the Countrey,\r\n  whereof several in my own Parish, which now are either leveled with\r\n  the ground or standing Monuments of the Wrath of God, are so shattered\r\n  and torn that they are irrepairable. While these were trembling, the\r\n  Earth opened in my Parish in multitudes of Places, and through thier\r\n  dire Chasms spew’d out Water to a considerable height above ground, in\r\n  such quantities in some Places, that it made our Gullies run on a\r\n  suddain, tho’ before exceeding dry; in so much that some were afraid\r\n  of being overwhelmed at once by the River and Sea joining together to\r\n  swallow up the Countrey, especially nigh the River, in the purest\r\n  Mould, which had not Clay or other Consolidating Matter beneath to\r\n  oppose the force of the Fountain of the Deep breaking up; for where\r\n  that was, we do not find any cracks of the Earth at all; and yet it\r\n  pleases God that we in the Parish have escaped the Danger much better\r\n  than our Neighbour Parishes; for happening to content ourselves with\r\n  mean and low built Houses, for the most part built with Timber, and\r\n  boarded, or with Cratches set deep in the ground and Plaistered, such\r\n  Houses are generally standing: So that we have means to assist one\r\n  another in this calamitous distress.\r\n\r\nIn 1728 the finances of the parish were in such a bad condition that a\r\nBill was passed by the Assembly to reduce the rector’s salary from £150\r\nto £100.\r\n\r\nUnder date February 11, 1803, Lady Nugent records that “The Admiral\r\nbrought Mr. and Mrs. Ledwich and Captain Dunn with him.” This may refer\r\neither to the rector of Vere or to his brother, G. Ledwich, the rector\r\nof Port Royal. On July 2 she entertained “the Mr. and Mrs. Ledwich”\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the rectors as complete as it has possible to\r\nmake it:\r\n\r\n        1671.      Rev. Lander.\r\n        1675.      Vacant.\r\n        1678.      Rev. Thomas Hardwicke.\r\n        1693.      Rev. Samuel Cook.\r\n        1701.      Rev. Richard Tabor.\r\n        1716.      Rev. James White.\r\n        1762–63.   Rev. Samuel Griffiths, A.M. Cantab.\r\n        1763–70.   Rev. John Lindsay, D.D.\r\n        1770–72.   Rev. John Wolcot (Peter Pindar).\r\n        1776.      Rev. William Morgan.\r\n        1782–94.   Rev. Francis Johnstone.\r\n        1795–96.   Rev. Thomas Markly.\r\n        1797–1802. Rev. Edward Ledwich.\r\n        1803.      Vacant.\r\n        1804.      Rev. Thomas Underwood.\r\n        1805.      Rev. Humphries.\r\n        1806.      Vacant.\r\n        1807–09.   Rev. Isaac Mann.\r\n        1811–15.   Rev. Edmund Pope, LL.D.\r\n        1816.      Rev. John M’Cammon Trew.\r\n        1817–20.   Rev. George Crawford Ricketts Fearon.\r\n        1821–24.   Rev. Joseph Jefferson.\r\n        1825.      Rev. Edward F. Hughes.\r\n        1826.      Rev. Urquhart Gillespie Rose.\r\n        1827.      Rev. Henry V. Towton, M.D. Edin. 1817.\r\n        1828–44.   Rev. John Smith, A.B.\r\n        1845–47.   Rev. B. Robinson, B.A.\r\n        1849–50.   Rev. J. Williams.\r\n        1851.      Rev. W. S. Coward.\r\n        1855–69.   Rev. Thomas Garrett, B.A.\r\n        1870.      Rev. Alexander Foote.\r\n        1871–76.   Rev. C. Douet, B.A. (later Assistant Bishop).\r\n        1876.      Rev. C. T. Husband.\r\n        1905.      Rev. S. Negus.\r\n\r\nGriffiths accompanied the Governor, William Henry Lyttelton, to the\r\nisland in 1762, and was in the same year presented to the rectory of\r\nVere. He afterwards removed to St. Dorothy, and later to St. Jago de la\r\nVega. Of Dr. Lindsay some account was given in the notice of the\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\nWolcot, satirist and poet, best known perhaps by his satires on the King\r\nand the Royal Academy, accompanied as physician his kinsman, Sir William\r\nTrelawny, when he came out to take up the governorship of Jamaica in\r\n1767. They were both Cornishmen, and Wolcot had been chaplain on\r\nTrelawny’s ship when the latter was a captain in the navy. Finding that\r\nmedical prospects in Jamaica were not promising he returned to England\r\nin 1769, and took orders with a view to being appointed rector of St.\r\nAnn, the Bishop of London ordaining him deacon and priest on succeeding\r\ndays. Returning to Jamaica early in 1770 he found the rectory of St. Ann\r\nnot vacant, and he was appointed to Vere. He was _ex-officio_ a trustee\r\nof the Vere School. He lived with the Governor at Spanish Town and\r\nperformed most of his duties by deputy. In May of the same year he was\r\nappointed physician general to the horse and foot soldiers in the\r\nisland. He lived on terms of close intimacy with the Trelawnys, and one\r\nof his earlier poems, “The Nymph of Tauris,” which first saw the light\r\nof day in Jamaica, is an elegy on the death of Ann Trelawny, sister to\r\nSir William. Soon after the Governor’s death, which occurred in December\r\n1772, Wolcot accompanied Lady Trelawny to England, and Redding in his\r\n“Recollections Literary and Personal,” tells us that her death shortly\r\nafterwards robbed him of a future wife.\r\n\r\nWhile rector of Vere he published a work entitled “Persian Love Elegies,\r\nto which is added the Nymph of Tauris,” printed in Kingston in 1773 by\r\nJoseph Thompson and Co. It is dedicated to Lady Trelawny. This work is,\r\napart from the Kingston printed Almanac of 1751, the oldest Jamaica\r\nprinted book in the library of the Institute.\r\n\r\nThe following tale is told of Wolcot’s ready wit in Jamaica. At a\r\ndinner-party given by Pusey Manning of Vere, he jokingly introduced the\r\nrector to a stranger in the following manner, “This is Dr. Wolcot, the\r\nunworthy incumbrance of this parish.” “And this, Sir,” retorted Wolcot,\r\n“is Pusey Manning, Esq., the scabbiest sheep in my flock.”\r\n\r\nThe east window of the church is filled with stained glass, and stained\r\nglass is in two lights of the west window. That to the south is “In\r\nmemory of Marie Sophie, the beloved wife of James Harvey, who died on\r\nJuly 24, 1871, aged 41 years”: that to the north is “In memory of George\r\nHarrison Townsend, died July 10, 1846, and Sarah Bevil his wife died\r\nFeb. 22, 1871.”\r\n\r\nThe church owns a most interesting chalice and paten: on the former is\r\ninscribed “The Gift of Ralph Rippon, sen., to the Parish Church of Vere,\r\nin Jamaica, 1687”: on the paten “Ralph Rippon, 1687.” Except for the\r\npaten at Yallahs, which dates from 1683, these are the oldest examples\r\nof plate in the colony. Both bear the date mark of 1685. The chalice is\r\ntypical of what Cripps calls “the rude vessels of the latter part of the\r\ncentury.” Rippon represented Vere in the Assembly from 1726 to 1733,\r\nwith an interval in 1731, when he sat for St. Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal tombs in Vere Church, those that are\r\ngiven in Lawrence-Archer being so stated:\r\n\r\n  MURAL MONUMENTS\r\n\r\n  1.

A pair that by a primæval\r\n  purity of manners acquired the universal esteem of and reflected\r\n  honour on human nature.

This tomb was erected by Mr. Daniel Callaghan, consignee, and\r\n  Messrs.

He\r\n  died at Pusey Hall in this parish on the 24th December 1862, in the\r\n  52nd year of his age, & was buried thre.\r\n\r\n  32. Beneath this stone lieth the body of Ann Livingston, the beloved\r\n  wife of William Livingston Reid, born 11th April, 1880, died on the\r\n  12th February, 1861, aged 53 years.\r\n\r\nRaines Waite, in the year 1694, left the remainder of his estate to poor\r\nchildren. As several persons of the old parish of Vere (which included a\r\npart of the present parish of Manchester) had made several charitable\r\ndonations, consisting of lands, slaves and money, for the use of the\r\nsaid parish, without giving any particular directions or making any\r\nparticular appointments touching the management or disposal of the\r\nproceeds of these gifts, an act of the Island Legislature was passed in\r\n1740, vesting the funds of the Charity in certain trustees for the\r\npurpose of erecting buildings and endowing a free school at the Alley in\r\nthe then parish of Vere, for the education and maintenance of as many\r\npoor children as the trustees might approve of. The present =Free\r\nSchool= at the Alley was founded under the provisions of this Act, which\r\nwas amended by an act of 1768 and again by 18 Vic. c. 54. When Bridges\r\nwrote: “The funds at present amount to £12,000, vested in Island\r\ncertificates, bearing 6 per cent. interest, with a parcel of land rented\r\nto Moneymusk estate, for £383 per annum, and some slaves, leased by the\r\nproprietor of Pusey Hall estate for the annual sum of £103. There is\r\nbesides an excellent house, with five acres of land, and the\r\nestablishment, which has been lately opened to the adjoining parishes of\r\nManchester and Clarendon, maintains twelve boys.”\r\n\r\nIn 1908 a secondary school was established.\r\n\r\nOf =Hillside= Peter Pindar wrote a ballad entitled “The Fisherman,”\r\npublished in the “Columbian Magazine” for 1797, commencing:\r\n\r\n       At Hillside where you’ll meet with most excellent Cheer,\r\n       Good Burgundy, Claret, Hock, Cyder and Beer,\r\n       Where the Master and Mistress seem both to Contest,\r\n       Who shall treat with most kindness and welcome each Guest.\r\n\r\nThe site of the old parish church of Clarendon, known as the =Church of\r\nthe White Cross=, as distinguished from that of the Red Cross (the\r\nCathedral) at Spanish Town, was on a rising piece of land about four\r\nmiles from May Pen and eight from Old Harbour. It is now covered with\r\ndense undergrowth, and very few even of the negro squatters in the\r\ndistrict know of its whereabouts. The bush was recently so thick that\r\ntwo men were necessary to cut a path through with machettes; and though\r\nthe old rectory was found, an hour’s search failed to discover the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe face of the country has been completely altered since the old days,\r\nbut it is difficult to understand why such an out-of-the-way situation\r\nshould have been selected. The only road in the district used when the\r\nchurch was dedicated was the present rough parochial road from May Pen\r\nwhich debouches on to the Free Town road about half a mile from Old\r\nHarbour. This latter road was not, it is believed, in existence 150\r\nyears ago, so that the old road probably was continued to Old Harbour\r\nBay, whither the sugar from the estates in Upper Clarendon was conveyed.\r\nIt is about three-quarters of a mile from the church, and now there is\r\nno trace of any road connecting them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MORGAN’S VALLEY\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe old church has now completely disappeared, as not so long ago local\r\nsquatters pulled the walls down to utilise the stones. On the occasion\r\nof a visit in 1907 the walls of strong masonry were still standing,\r\nundamaged by the recent earthquake, though the roof had fallen in,\r\nseveral of its beams lying rotting in the grass. It was evidently a very\r\nsmall stone building, not more than 40 by 20 ft., though at the west end\r\nthere was a small room about 12 ft. square, probably a vestry. The walls\r\nwere not more than 10 ft. high.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the rectory are clearly visible, distant about 300\r\nyards in the bush. Local tradition is that it was a large house with\r\ngood stables. It was evidently built of bricks and must have been of a\r\ngood size, larger than the church. There was a churchyard immediately\r\njoining the house. Besides traces of several other graves, there is a\r\nbricked and railed-in space containing several gravestones level with\r\nthe ground. The slabs have no armorial bearing, but contain a full list\r\nof the virtues appertaining to the Hon. Edward Pennant (1736), chief\r\njustice and president of the Council, and of his wife Elizabeth (1735),\r\nFrancis Reading (1738), and, William Dawkins, who died in 14/12/32\r\n(1752), aged 26 years.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Morgan, the buccaneer governor (1675–82), is commemorated in\r\n=Morgan’s Valley=, where he for some time is said to have resided.\r\n\r\nThe =Chapelton Church=, dedicated to St. Paul, was built at the time\r\nwhen the present parish of Clarendon was divided into the parishes of\r\nClarendon and Vere. The “Cross” Church, near May Pen, now in ruins, was\r\nthen the parish church of Clarendon. The Chapelton Church was built as a\r\nchapel of “ease” to the Cross Church, and was the first place of worship\r\nof any size erected in Upper Clarendon. It was commonly known as the\r\n“Chapel,” and the village around it took the name from the church, being\r\ncalled “Chapel Town,” and in the course of time shortened into its\r\npresent form, Chapelton. The oldest records go back to the year 1666.\r\n\r\nThe building when first erected was about one-fourth of its present\r\nsize. It was then enlarged to half its present size, and finally was\r\nincreased to its present size. This history of the growth of the church\r\naccounts for the fact that the old building had a double roof with a\r\ncolumn of pillars down the centre. It appears that after the Cross\r\nChurch fell into disuse, the daughter church of St. Paul’s, Chapelton,\r\nbecame the Parish Church of Upper Clarendon, and what was then called\r\n“Lime Savannah Chapel” (now St. Gabriel’s Church) took the place of the\r\nold church at the Cross.\r\n\r\nThe list of incumbents as far as it has been possible to complete it is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                             Rev.
