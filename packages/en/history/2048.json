A mere\r\nspectator of other men’s fortunes and adventures, and how they play\r\ntheir parts; which, methinks, are diversely presented unto me, as from a\r\ncommon theatre or scene.”--BURTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following papers, with two exceptions, were written in England, and\r\nformed but part of an intended series for which I had made notes and\r\nmemorandums. Before I could mature a plan, however, circumstances\r\ncompelled me to send them piecemeal to the United States, where they\r\nwere published from time to time in portions or numbers. It was not my\r\nintention to publish them in England, being conscious that much of their\r\ncontents could be interesting only to American readers, and, in truth,\r\nbeing deterred by the severity with which American productions had been\r\ntreated by the British press.\r\n\r\nBy the time the contents of the first volume had appeared in this\r\noccasional manner, they began to find their way across the Atlantic,\r\nand to be inserted, with many kind encomiums, in the London Literary\r\nGazette. It was said, also, that a London bookseller intended to publish\r\nthem in a collective form. I determined, therefore, to bring them\r\nforward myself, that they might at least have the benefit of my\r\nsuperintendence and revision. I accordingly took the printed numbers\r\nwhich I had received from the United States, to Mr. John Murray, the\r\neminent publisher, from whom I had already received friendly attentions,\r\nand left them with him for examination, informing him that should he be\r\ninclined to bring them before the public, I had materials enough on\r\nhand for a second volume. Several days having elapsed without any\r\ncommunication from Mr. Murray, I addressed a note to him, in which I\r\nconstrued his silence into a tacit rejection of my work, and begged that\r\nthe numbers I had left with him might be returned to me. The following\r\nwas his reply:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I entreat you to believe that I feel truly obliged by your\r\nkind intentions towards me, and that I entertain the most unfeigned\r\nrespect for your most tasteful talents. My house is completely filled\r\nwith workpeople at this time, and I have only an office to transact\r\nbusiness in; and yesterday I was wholly occupied, or I should have done\r\nmyself the pleasure of seeing you.\r\n\r\nIf it would not suit me to engage in the publication of your present\r\nwork, it is only because I do not see that scope in the nature of it\r\nwhich would enable me to make those satisfactory accounts between us,\r\nwithout which I really feel no satisfaction in engaging--but I will\r\ndo all I can to promote their circulation, and shall be most ready to\r\nattend to any future plan of yours.\r\n\r\n    With much regard, I remain, dear sir,\r\n                     Your faithful servant,\r\n                                 JOHN MURRAY.\r\n\r\nThis was disheartening, and might have deterred me from any further\r\nprosecution of the matter, had the question of republication in Great\r\nBritain rested entirely with me; but I apprehended the appearance of a\r\nspurious edition. I now thought of Mr. Archibald Constable as publisher,\r\nhaving been treated by him with much hospitality during a visit to\r\nEdinburgh; but first I determined to submit my work to Sir-Walter (then\r\nMr.) Scott, being encouraged to do so by the cordial reception I had\r\nexperienced from him at Abbotsford a few years previously, and by the\r\nfavorable opinion he had expressed to others of my earlier writings. I\r\naccordingly sent him the printed numbers of the Sketch-Book in a parcel\r\nby coach, and at the same time wrote to him, hinting that since I had\r\nhad the pleasure of partaking of his hospitality, a reverse had taken\r\nplace in my affairs which made the successful exercise of my pen\r\nall-important to me; I begged him, therefore, to look over the literary\r\narticles I had forwarded to him, and, if he thought they would bear\r\nEuropean republication, to ascertain whether Mr. Constable would be\r\ninclined to be the publisher.\r\n\r\nThe parcel containing my work went by coach to Scott’s address in\r\nEdinburgh; the letter went by mail to his residence in the country. By\r\nthe very first post I received a reply, before he had seen my work.\r\n\r\n“I was down at Kelso,” said he, “when your letter reached Abbotsford. I\r\nam now on my way to town, and will converse with Constable, and do all\r\nin my power to forward your views--I assure you nothing will give me\r\nmore pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe hint, however, about a reverse of fortune had struck the quick\r\napprehension of Scott, and, with that practical and efficient good-will\r\nwhich belonged to his nature, he had already devised a way of aiding me.\r\nA weekly periodical, he went on to inform me, was about to be set up\r\nin Edinburgh, supported by the most respectable talents, and amply\r\nfurnished with all the necessary information. The appointment of the\r\neditor, for which ample funds were provided, would be five hundred\r\npounds sterling a year, with the reasonable prospect of further\r\nadvantages. This situation, being apparently at his disposal, he frankly\r\noffered to me. The work, however, he intimated, was to have somewhat of\r\na political bearing, and he expressed an apprehension that the tone it\r\nwas desired to adopt might not suit me. “Yet I risk the question,” added\r\nhe, “because I know no man so well qualified for this important task,\r\nand perhaps because it will necessarily bring you to Edinburgh. If my\r\nproposal does not suit, you need only keep the matter secret and there\r\nis no harm done. ‘And for my love I pray you wrong me not.’ If on the\r\ncontrary you think it could be made to suit you, let me know as soon as\r\npossible, addressing Castle Street, Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\nIn a postscript, written from Edinburgh, he adds, “I am just come here,\r\nand have glanced over the Sketch-Book. It is positively beautiful, and\r\nincreases my desire to crimp you, if it be possible. Some difficulties\r\nthere always are in managing such a matter, especially at the outset;\r\nbut we will obviate them as much as we possibly can.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from an imperfect draught of my reply, which underwent\r\nsome modifications in the copy sent:\r\n\r\n“I cannot express how much I am gratified by your letter. I had begun to\r\nfeel as if I had taken an unwarrantable liberty; but, somehow or other,\r\nthere is a genial sunshine about you that warms every creeping thing\r\ninto heart and confidence. Your literary proposal both surprises and\r\nflatters me, as it evinces a much higher opinion of my talents than I\r\nhave myself.”\r\n\r\nI then went on to explain that I found myself peculiarly unfitted for\r\nthe situation offered to me, not merely by my political opinions, but by\r\nthe very constitution and habits of my mind. “My whole course of life,”\r\n I observed, “has been desultory, and I am unfitted for any periodically\r\nrecurring task, or any stipulated labor of body or mind. I have no\r\ncommand of my talents, such as they are, and have to watch the varyings\r\nof my mind as I would those of a weathercock. Practice and training\r\nmay bring me more into rule; but at present I am as useless for regular\r\nservice as one of my own country Indians or a Don Cossack.\r\n\r\n“I must, therefore, keep on pretty much as I have begun; writing when I\r\ncan, not when I would. I shall occasionally shift my residence and write\r\nwhatever is suggested by objects before me, or whatever rises in my\r\nimagination; and hope to write better and more copiously by and by.\r\n\r\n“I am playing the egotist, but I know no better way of answering your\r\nproposal than by showing what a very good-for-nothing kind of being I\r\nam. Should Mr. Constable feel inclined to make a bargain for the wares I\r\nhave on hand, he will encourage me to further enterprise; and it will be\r\nsomething like trading with a gypsy for the fruits of his prowlings, who\r\nmay at one time have nothing but a wooden bowl to offer, and at another\r\ntime a silver tankard.”\r\n\r\nIn reply, Scott expressed regret, but not surprise, at my declining what\r\nmight have proved a troublesome duty. He then recurred to the original\r\nsubject of our correspondence; entered into a detail of the various\r\nterms upon which arrangements were made between authors and booksellers,\r\nthat I might take my choice; expressing the most encouraging confidence\r\nof the success of my work, and of previous works which I had produced\r\nin America. “I did no more,” added he, “than open the trenches with\r\nConstable; but I am sure if you will take the trouble to write to him,\r\nyou will find him disposed to treat your overtures with every degree of\r\nattention. Or, if you think it of consequence in the first place to\r\nsee me, I shall be in London in the course of a month, and whatever my\r\nexperience can command is most heartily at your command. But I can add\r\nlittle to what I have said above, except my earnest recommendation to\r\nConstable to enter into the negotiation.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * I cannot avoid subjoining in a note a succeeding paragraph\r\n     of Scott’s letter, which, though it does not relate to the\r\n     main subject of our correspondence, was too characteristic\r\n     to be omitted. Some time previously I had sent Miss Sophia\r\n     Scott small duodecimo American editions of her father’s\r\n     poems published in Edinburgh in quarto volumes; showing the\r\n     “nigromancy” of the American press, by which a quart of wine\r\n     is conjured into a pint bottle. Scott observes: “In my\r\n     hurry, I have not thanked you in Sophia’s name for the kind\r\n     attention which furnished her with the American volumes. I\r\n     am not quite sure I can add my own, since you have made her\r\n     acquainted with much more of papa’s folly than she would\r\n     ever otherwise have learned; for I had taken special care\r\n     they should never see any of those things during their\r\n     earlier years. I think I have told you that Walter is\r\n     sweeping the firmament with a feather like a maypole and\r\n     indenting the pavement with a sword like a scythe--in other\r\n     words, he has become a whiskered hussar in the 18th\r\n     Dragoons.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the receipt of this most obliging letter, however, I had\r\ndetermined to look to no leading bookseller for a launch, but to throw\r\nmy work before the public at my own risk, and let it sink or swim\r\naccording to its merits. I wrote to that effect to Scott, and soon\r\nreceived a reply:\r\n\r\n“I observe with pleasure that you are going to come forth in Britain. It\r\nis certainly not the very best way to publish on one’s own accompt; for\r\nthe booksellers set their face against the circulation of such works as\r\ndo not pay an amazing toll to themselves. But they have lost the art of\r\naltogether damming up the road in such cases between the author and the\r\npublic, which they were once able to do as effectually as Diabolus in\r\nJohn Bunyan’s Holy War closed up the windows of my Lord Understanding’s\r\nmansion. I am sure of one thing, that you have only to be known to the\r\nBritish public to be admired by them, and I would not say so unless I\r\nreally was of that opinion.\r\n\r\n“If you ever see a witty but rather local publication called Blackwood’s\r\nEdinburgh Magazine, you will find some notice of your works in the last\r\nnumber: the author is a friend of mine, to whom I have introduced you\r\nin your literary capacity. His name is Lockhart, a young man of very\r\nconsiderable talent, and who will soon be intimately connected with\r\nmy family. My faithful friend Knickerbocker is to be next examined and\r\nillustrated. Constable was extremely willing to enter into consideration\r\nof a treaty for your works, but I foresee will be still more so when\r\n\r\n    Your name is up, and may go\r\n    From Toledo to Madrid.\r\n\r\n“----And that will soon be the case. I trust to be in London about the\r\nmiddle of the month, and promise myself great pleasure in once again\r\nshaking you by the hand.”\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the Sketch-Book was put to press in London, as I had\r\nresolved, at my own risk, by a bookseller unknown to fame, and without\r\nany of the usual arts by which a work is trumpeted into notice.\r\nStill some attention had been called to it by the extracts which had\r\npreviously appeared in the Literary Gazette, and by the kind word\r\nspoken by the editor of that periodical, and it was getting into fair\r\ncirculation, when my worthy bookseller failed before the first month was\r\nover, and the sale was interrupted.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Scott arrived in London. I called to him for help, as I\r\nwas sticking in the mire, and, more propitious than Hercules, he put his\r\nown shoulder to the wheel. Through his favorable representations, Murray\r\nwas quickly induced to undertake the future publication of the work\r\nwhich he had previously declined. A further edition of the first volume\r\nwas struck off and the second volume was put to press, and from that\r\ntime Murray became my publisher, conducting himself in all his dealings\r\nwith that fair, open, and liberal spirit which had obtained for him the\r\nwell-merited appellation of the Prince of Booksellers.\r\n\r\nThus, under the kind and cordial auspices of Sir Walter Scott, I began\r\nmy literary career in Europe; and I feel that I am but discharging, in\r\na trifling degree, my debt of gratitude to the memory of that\r\ngolden-hearted man in acknowledging my obligations to him. But who of\r\nhis literary contemporaries ever applied to him for aid or counsel that\r\ndid not experience the most prompt, generous, and effectual assistance?\r\n\r\nW. I.\r\n\r\nSUNNYSIDE, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKETCH BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR’S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF\r\n\r\nI am of this mind with Homer, that as the snaile that crept out of her\r\nshel was turned eftsoones into a toad, and thereby was forced to make a\r\nstoole to sit on; so the traveller that stragleth from his owne country\r\nis in a short time transformed into so monstrous a shape, that he is\r\nfaine to alter his mansion with his manners, and to live where he can,\r\nnot where he would.--LYLY’S EUPHUES.\r\n\r\nI was always fond of visiting new scenes, and observing strange\r\ncharacters and manners. Even when a mere child I began my travels, and\r\nmade many tours of discovery into foreign parts and unknown regions of\r\nmy native city, to the frequent alarm of my parents, and the emolument\r\nof the town crier. As I grew into boyhood, I extended the range of my\r\nobservations. My holiday afternoons were spent in rambles about the\r\nsurrounding country. I made myself familiar with all its places famous\r\nin history or fable. I knew every spot where a murder or robbery had\r\nbeen committed, or a ghost seen. I visited the neighboring villages,\r\nand added greatly to my stock of knowledge, by noting their habits and\r\ncustoms, and conversing with their sages and great men. I even journeyed\r\none long summer’s day to the summit of the most distant hill, whence I\r\nstretched my eye over many a mile of terra incognita, and was astonished\r\nto find how vast a globe I inhabited.\r\n\r\nThis rambling propensity strengthened with my years. Books of voyages\r\nand travels became my passion, and in devouring their contents, I\r\nneglected the regular exercises of the school. How wistfully would\r\nI wander about the pier-heads in fine weather, and watch the parting\r\nships, bound to distant climes; with what longing eyes would I gaze\r\nafter their lessening sails, and waft myself in imagination to the ends\r\nof the earth!\r\n\r\nFurther reading and thinking, though they brought this vague inclination\r\ninto more reasonable bounds, only served to make it more decided. I\r\nvisited various parts of my own country; and had I been merely a lover\r\nof fine scenery, I should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere\r\nits gratification, for on no country had the charms of nature been more\r\nprodigally lavished. Her mighty lakes, her oceans of liquid silver; her\r\nmountains, with their bright aerial tints; her valleys, teeming with\r\nwild fertility; her tremendous cataracts, thundering in their solitudes;\r\nher boundless plains, waving with spontaneous verdure; her broad, deep\r\nrivers, rolling in solemn silence to the ocean; her trackless forests,\r\nwhere vegetation puts forth all its magnificence; her skies, kindling\r\nwith the magic of summer clouds and glorious sunshine;--no, never need\r\nan American look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of\r\nnatural scenery.\r\n\r\nBut Europe held forth all the charms of storied and poetical\r\nassociation. There were to be seen the masterpieces of art, the\r\nrefinements of highly cultivated society, the quaint peculiarities\r\nof ancient and local custom. My native country was full of youthful\r\npromise; Europe was rich in the accumulated treasures of age. Her very\r\nruins told the history of the times gone by, and every mouldering\r\nstone was a chronicle. I longed to wander over the scenes of renowned\r\nachievement--to tread, as it were, in the footsteps of antiquity--to\r\nloiter about the ruined castle--to meditate on the falling tower--to\r\nescape, in short, from the commonplace realities of the present, and\r\nlose myself among the shadowy grandeurs of the past.\r\n\r\nI had, besides all this, an earnest desire to see the great men of the\r\nearth. We have, it is true, our great men in America: not a city but has\r\nan ample share of them. I have mingled among them in my time, and been\r\nalmost withered by the shade into which they cast me; for there\r\nis nothing so baleful to a small man as the shade of a great one,\r\nparticularly the great man of a city. But I was anxious to see the great\r\nmen of Europe; for I had read in the works of various philosophers, that\r\nall animals degenerated in America, and man among the number. A great\r\nman of Europe, thought I, must therefore be as superior to a great man\r\nof America, as a peak of the Alps to a highland of the Hudson; and in\r\nthis idea I was confirmed by observing the comparative importance and\r\nswelling magnitude of many English travellers among us, who, I was\r\nassured, were very little people in their own country. I will visit this\r\nland of wonders, thought I, and see the gigantic race from which I am\r\ndegenerated.\r\n\r\nIt has been either my good or evil lot to have my roving passion\r\ngratified. I have wandered through different countries and witnessed\r\nmany of the shifting scenes of life. I cannot say that I have studied\r\nthem with the eye of a philosopher, but rather with the sauntering gaze\r\nwith which humble lovers of the picturesque stroll from the window\r\nof one print-shop to another; caught sometimes by the delineations of\r\nbeauty, sometimes by the distortions of caricature, and sometimes by\r\nthe loveliness of landscape. As it is the fashion for modern tourists\r\nto travel pencil in hand, and bring home their portfolios filled with\r\nsketches, I am disposed to get up a few for the entertainment of my\r\nfriends. When, however, I look over the hints and memorandums I have\r\ntaken down for the purpose, my heart almost fails me, at finding how\r\nmy idle humor has led me astray from the great object studied by every\r\nregular traveller who would make a book. I fear I shall give equal\r\ndisappointment with an unlucky landscape-painter, who had travelled on\r\nthe Continent, but following the bent of his vagrant inclination, had\r\nsketched in nooks, and corners, and by-places. His sketch-book was\r\naccordingly crowded with cottages, and landscapes, and obscure ruins;\r\nbut he had neglected to paint St. Peter’s, or the Coliseum, the cascade\r\nof Terni, or the bay of Naples, and had not a single glacier or volcano\r\nin his whole collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n        Ships, ships, I will descrie you\r\n          Amidst the main,\r\n        I will come and try you,\r\n        What you are protecting,\r\n        And projecting,\r\n          What’s your end and aim.\r\n    One goes abroad for merchandise and trading,\r\n    Another stays to keep his country from invading,\r\n    A third is coming home with rich and wealthy lading.\r\n    Hallo! my fancie, whither wilt thou go?\r\n                                           OLD POEM.\r\n\r\nTo an American visiting Europe, the long voyage he has to make is an\r\nexcellent preparative. The temporary absence of worldly scenes and\r\nemployments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted to receive\r\nnew and vivid impressions. The vast space of waters that separate the\r\nhemispheres is like a blank page in existence. There is no gradual\r\ntransition by which, as in Europe, the features and population of one\r\ncountry blend almost imperceptibly with those of another. From the\r\nmoment you lose sight of the land you have left, all is vacancy, until\r\nyou step on the opposite shore, and are launched at once into the bustle\r\nand novelties of another world.\r\n\r\nIn travelling by land there is a continuity of scene, and a connected\r\nsuccession of persons and incidents, that carry on the story of life,\r\nand lessen the effect of absence and separation. We drag, it is true,\r\n“a lengthening chain” at each remove of our pilgrimage; but the chain is\r\nunbroken; we can trace it back link by link; and we feel that the last\r\nstill grapples us to home. But a wide sea voyage severs us at once.\r\nIt makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of\r\nsettled life, and sent adrift upon a doubtful world. It interposes a\r\ngulf, not merely imaginary, but real, between us and our homes--a\r\ngulf, subject to tempest, and fear, and uncertainty, rendering distance\r\npalpable, and return precarious.\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, was the case with myself. As I saw the last blue lines\r\nof my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon, it seemed as if\r\nI had closed one volume of the world and its concerns, and had time for\r\nmeditation, before I opened another. That land, too, now vanishing from\r\nmy view, which contained all most dear to me in life; what vicissitudes\r\nmight occur in it--what changes might take place in me, before I should\r\nvisit it again! Who can tell, when he sets forth to wander, whither he\r\nmay be driven by the uncertain currents of existence; or when he may\r\nreturn; or whether it may be ever his lot to revisit the scenes of his\r\nchildhood?\r\n\r\nI said, that at sea all is vacancy; I should correct the impression. To\r\none given to day-dreaming, and fond of losing himself in reveries, a sea\r\nvoyage is full of subjects for meditation; but then they are the wonders\r\nof the deep and of the air, and rather tend to abstract the mind from\r\nworldly themes. I delighted to loll over the quarter-railing or climb to\r\nthe main-top, of a calm day, and muse for hours together on the tranquil\r\nbosom of a summer’s sea; to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just\r\npeering above the horizon, fancy them some fairy realms, and people\r\nthem with a creation of my own;--to watch the gently undulating billows\r\nrolling their silver volumes, as if to die away on those happy shores.\r\n\r\nThere was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe with which I\r\nlooked down, from my giddy height, on the monsters of the deep at their\r\nuncouth gambols: shoals of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the ship;\r\nthe grampus, slowly heaving his huge form above the surface; or the\r\nravenous shark, darting, like a spectre, through the blue waters. My\r\nimagination would conjure up all that I had heard or read of the watery\r\nworld beneath me; of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys;\r\nof the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the\r\nearth; and of those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nSometimes a distant sail, gliding along the edge of the ocean, would be\r\nanother theme of idle speculation. How interesting this fragment of a\r\nworld, hastening to rejoin the great mass of existence! What a glorious\r\nmonument of human invention; which has in a manner triumphed over\r\nwind and wave; has brought the ends of the world into communion; has\r\nestablished an interchange of blessings, pouring into the sterile\r\nregions of the north all the luxuries of the south; has diffused the\r\nlight of knowledge, and the charities of cultivated life; and has thus\r\nbound together those scattered portions of the human race, between which\r\nnature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier.\r\n\r\nWe one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance. At\r\nsea, every thing that breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse\r\nattracts attention. It proved to be the mast of a ship that must have\r\nbeen completely wrecked; for there were the remains of handkerchiefs, by\r\nwhich some of the crew had fastened themselves to this spar, to prevent\r\ntheir being washed off by the waves. There was no trace by which the\r\nname of the ship could be ascertained. The wreck had evidently drifted\r\nabout for many months; clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it, and\r\nlong sea-weeds flaunted at its sides. But where, thought I, is the crew?\r\nTheir struggle has long been over--they have gone down amidst the roar\r\nof the tempest--their bones lie whitening among the caverns of the deep.\r\nSilence, oblivion, like the waves, have closed over them, and no one\r\ncan tell the story of their end. What sighs have been wafted after that\r\nship! what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home! How\r\noften has the mistress, the wife, the mother, pored over the daily news,\r\nto catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep! How has\r\nexpectation darkened into anxiety--anxiety into dread--and dread into\r\ndespair! Alas! not one memento may ever return for love to cherish. All\r\nthat may ever be known, is that she sailed from her port, “and was never\r\nheard of more!”\r\n\r\nThe sight of this wreck, as usual, gave rise to many dismal anecdotes.\r\nThis was particularly the case in the evening, when the weather, which\r\nhad hitherto been fair, began to look wild and threatening, and gave\r\nindications of one of those sudden storms that will sometimes break in\r\nupon the serenity of a summer voyage. As we sat round the dull light of\r\na lamp, in the cabin, that made the gloom more ghastly, everyone had his\r\ntale of shipwreck and disaster. I was particularly struck with a short\r\none related by the captain:\r\n\r\n“As I was once sailing,” said he, “in a fine, stout ship, across the\r\nbanks of Newfoundland, one of those heavy fogs that prevail in those\r\nparts rendered it impossible for us to see far ahead, even in the\r\ndaytime; but at night the weather was so thick that we could not\r\ndistinguish any object at twice the length of the ship. I kept lights\r\nat the mast-head, and a constant watch forward to look out for fishing\r\nsmacks, which are accustomed to lie at anchor on the banks. The wind was\r\nblowing a smacking breeze, and we were going at a great rate through\r\nthe water. Suddenly the watch gave the alarm of ‘a sail ahead!’--it was\r\nscarcely uttered before we were upon her. She was a small schooner, at\r\nanchor, with her broadside toward us. The crew were all asleep, and had\r\nneglected to hoist a light. We struck her just amidships. The force, the\r\nsize, and weight of our vessel, bore her down below the waves; we passed\r\nover her and were hurried on our course. As the crashing wreck was\r\nsinking beneath us, I had a glimpse of two or three half-naked wretches,\r\nrushing from her cabin; they just started from their beds to be\r\nswallowed shrieking by the waves. I heard their drowning cry mingling\r\nwith the wind. The blast that bore it to our ears, swept us out of all\r\nfurther hearing. I shall never forget that cry! It was some time before\r\nwe could put the ship about, she was under such headway. We returned, as\r\nnearly as we could guess, to the place where the smack had anchored. We\r\ncruised about for several hours in the dense fog. We fired signal-guns,\r\nand listened if we might hear the halloo of any survivors: but all was\r\nsilent--we never saw or heard any thing of them more.”\r\n\r\nI confess these stories, for a time, put an end to all my fine fancies.\r\nThe storm increased with the night. The sea was lashed into tremendous\r\nconfusion. There was a fearful, sullen sound of rushing waves and broken\r\nsurges. Deep called unto deep. At times the black volume of clouds\r\noverhead seemed rent asunder by flashes of lightning which quivered\r\nalong the foaming billows, and made the succeeding darkness doubly\r\nterrible. The thunders bellowed over the wild waste of waters, and were\r\nechoed and prolonged by the mountain waves. As I saw the ship staggering\r\nand plunging among these roaring caverns, it seemed miraculous that she\r\nregained her balance, or preserved her buoyancy. Her yards would dip\r\ninto the water; her bow was almost buried beneath the waves. Sometimes\r\nan impending surge appeared ready to overwhelm her, and nothing but a\r\ndexterous movement of the helm preserved her from the shock.\r\n\r\nWhen I retired to my cabin, the awful scene still followed me. The\r\nwhistling of the wind through the rigging sounded like funereal\r\nwailings. The creaking of the masts; the straining and groaning of\r\nbulkheads, as the ship labored in the weltering sea, were frightful. As\r\nI heard the waves rushing along the side of the ship, and roaring in my\r\nvery ear, it seemed as if Death were raging around this floating prison,\r\nseeking for his prey: the mere starting of a nail, the yawning of a\r\nseam, might give him entrance.\r\n\r\nA fine day, however, with a tranquil sea and favoring breeze, soon put\r\nall these dismal reflections to flight. It is impossible to resist the\r\ngladdening influence of fine weather and fair wind at sea. When the ship\r\nis decked out in all her canvas, every sail swelled, and careering gayly\r\nover the curling waves, how lofty, how gallant, she appears--how she\r\nseems to lord it over the deep!\r\n\r\nI might fill a volume with the reveries of a sea voyage; for with me it\r\nis almost a continual reverie--but it is time to get to shore.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine sunny morning when the thrilling cry of “land!” was given\r\nfrom the mast-head. None but those who have experienced it can form an\r\nidea of the delicious throng of sensations which rush into an American’s\r\nbosom, when he first comes in sight of Europe. There is a volume of\r\nassociations with the very name. It is the land of promise, teeming with\r\neverything of which his childhood has heard, or on which his studious\r\nyears have pondered.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, until the moment of arrival, it was all feverish\r\nexcitement. The ships of war, that prowled like guardian giants along\r\nthe coast; the headlands of Ireland, stretching out into the channel;\r\nthe Welsh mountains towering into the clouds;--all were objects of\r\nintense interest. As we sailed up the Mersey, I reconnoitred the shores\r\nwith a telescope. My eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages, with their\r\ntrim shrubberies and green grass-plots. I saw the mouldering ruin of an\r\nabbey overrun with ivy, and the taper spire of a village church rising\r\nfrom the brow of a neighboring hill;--all were characteristic of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe tide and wind were so favorable, that the ship was enabled to come\r\nat once to her pier. It was thronged with people; some idle lookers-on;\r\nothers, eager expectants of friends or relations. I could distinguish\r\nthe merchant to whom the ship was consigned. I knew him by his\r\ncalculating brow and restless air. His hands were thrust into his\r\npockets; he was whistling thoughtfully, and walking to and fro, a\r\nsmall space having been accorded him by the crowd, in deference to his\r\ntemporary importance. There were repeated cheerings and salutations\r\ninterchanged between the shore and the ship, as friends happened to\r\nrecognize each other. I particularly noticed one young woman of humble\r\ndress, but interesting demeanor. She was leaning forward from among the\r\ncrowd; her eye hurried over the ship as it neared the shore, to catch\r\nsome wished-for countenance. She seemed disappointed and sad; when I\r\nheard a faint voice call her name.--It was from a poor sailor who had\r\nbeen ill all the voyage, and had excited the sympathy of every one on\r\nboard. When the weather was fine, his messmates had spread a mattress\r\nfor him on deck in the shade, but of late his illness had so increased\r\nthat he had taken to his hammock, and only breathed a wish that he might\r\nsee his wife before he died. He had been helped on deck as we came up\r\nthe river, and was now leaning against the shrouds, with a countenance\r\nso wasted, so pale, so ghastly, that it was no wonder even the eye of\r\naffection did not recognize him. But at the sound of his voice, her eye\r\ndarted on his features: it read, at once, a whole volume of sorrow; she\r\nclasped her hands, uttered a faint shriek, and stood wringing them in\r\nsilent agony.\r\n\r\nAll now was hurry and bustle. The meetings of acquaintances--the\r\ngreetings of friends--the consultations of men of business. I alone was\r\nsolitary and idle. I had no friend to meet, no cheering to receive. I\r\nstepped upon the land of my forefathers--but felt that I was a stranger\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSCOE.\r\n\r\n    ----In the service of mankind to be\r\n    A guardian god below; still to employ\r\n    The mind’s brave ardor in heroic aims,\r\n    Such as may raise us o’er the grovelling herd,\r\n    And make us shine for ever--that is life.\r\n                                            THOMSON.\r\n\r\nONE of the first places to which a stranger is taken in Liverpool is\r\nthe Athenaeum. It is established on a liberal and judicious plan; it\r\ncontains a good library, and spacious reading-room, and is the great\r\nliterary resort of the place. Go there at what hour you may, you are\r\nsure to find it filled with grave-looking personages, deeply absorbed in\r\nthe study of newspapers.\r\n\r\nAs I was once visiting this haunt of the learned, my attention was\r\nattracted to a person just entering the room. He was advanced in life,\r\ntall, and of a form that might once have been commanding, but it was\r\na little bowed by time--perhaps by care. He had a noble Roman style of\r\ncountenance; a a head that would have pleased a painter; and though some\r\nslight furrows on his brow showed that wasting thought had been busy\r\nthere, yet his eye beamed with the fire of a poetic soul. There was\r\nsomething in his whole appearance that indicated a being of a different\r\norder from the bustling race round him.\r\n\r\nI inquired his name, and was informed that it was ROSCOE. I drew back\r\nwith an involuntary feeling of veneration. This, then, was an author of\r\ncelebrity; this was one of those men whose voices have gone forth to\r\nthe ends of the earth; with whose minds I have communed even in the\r\nsolitudes of America. Accustomed, as we are in our country, to know\r\nEuropean writers only by their works, we cannot conceive of them, as of\r\nother men, engrossed by trivial or sordid pursuits, and jostling with\r\nthe crowd of common minds in the dusty paths of life. They pass before\r\nour imaginations like superior beings, radiant with the emanations of\r\ntheir genius, and surrounded by a halo of literary glory.\r\n\r\nTo find, therefore, the elegant historian of the Medici mingling among\r\nthe busy sons of traffic, at first shocked my poetical ideas; but it is\r\nfrom the very circumstances and situation in which he has been placed,\r\nthat Mr. Roscoe derives his highest claims to admiration. It is\r\ninteresting to notice how some minds seem almost to create themselves,\r\nspringing up under every disadvantage, and working their solitary but\r\nirresistible way through a thousand obstacles. Nature seems to delight\r\nin disappointing the assiduities of art, with which it would rear\r\nlegitimate dulness to maturity; and to glory in the vigor and luxuriance\r\nof her chance productions. She scatters the seeds of genius to the\r\nwinds, and though some may perish among the stony places of the world,\r\nand some be choked, by the thorns and brambles of early adversity, yet\r\nothers will now and then strike root even in the clefts of the rock,\r\nstruggle bravely up into sunshine, and spread over their sterile\r\nbirthplace all the beauties of vegetation.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the case with Mr. Roscoe. Born in a place apparently\r\nungenial to the growth of literary talent--in the very market-place of\r\ntrade; without fortune, family connections, or patronage; self-prompted,\r\nself-sustained, and almost self-taught, he has conquered every obstacle,\r\nachieved his way to eminence, and, having become one of the ornaments of\r\nthe nation, has turned the whole force of his talents and influence to\r\nadvance and embellish his native town.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is this last trait in his character which has given him the\r\ngreatest interest in my eyes, and induced me particularly to point him\r\nout to my countrymen. Eminent as are his literary merits, he is but one\r\namong the many distinguished authors of this intellectual nation.\r\nThey, however, in general, live but for their own fame, or their own\r\npleasures. Their private history presents no lesson to the world, or,\r\nperhaps, a humiliating one of human frailty or inconsistency. At best,\r\nthey are prone to steal away from the bustle and commonplace of busy\r\nexistence; to indulge in the selfishness of lettered eas; and to revel\r\nin scenes of mental, but exclusive enjoyment.\r\n\r\nMr. Roscoe, on the contrary, has claimed none of the accorded privileges\r\nof talent. He has shut himself up in no garden of thought, nor elysium\r\nof fancy; but has gone forth into the highways and thoroughfares of\r\nlife, he has planted bowers by the wayside, for the refreshment of the\r\npilgrim and the sojourner, and has opened pure fountains, where the\r\nlaboring man may turn aside from the dust and heat of the day, and drink\r\nof the living streams of knowledge. There is a “daily beauty in his\r\nlife,” on which mankind may meditate, and grow better. It exhibits no\r\nlofty and almost useless, because inimitable, example of excellence; but\r\npresents a picture of active, yet simple and imitable virtues, which are\r\nwithin every man’s reach, but which, unfortunately, are not exercised by\r\nmany, or this world would be a paradise.\r\n\r\nBut his private life is peculiarly worthy the attention of the citizens\r\nof our young and busy country, where literature and the elegant arts\r\nmust grow up side by side with the coarser plants of daily necessity;\r\nand must depend for their culture, not on the exclusive devotion of time\r\nand wealth; nor the quickening rays of titled patronage; but on\r\nhours and seasons snatched from the purest of worldly interests, by\r\nintelligent and public-spirited individuals.\r\n\r\nHe has shown how much may be done for a place in hours of leisure by\r\none master-spirit, and how completely it can give its own impress to\r\nsurrounding objects. Like his own Lorenzo de’ Medici, on whom he\r\nseems to have fixed his eye, as on a pure model of antiquity, he has\r\ninterwoven the history of his life with the history of his native town,\r\nand has made the foundations of his fame the monuments of his virtues.\r\nWherever you go, in Liverpool, you perceive traces of his footsteps in\r\nall that is elegant and liberal. He found the tide of wealth flowing\r\nmerely in the channels of traffic; he has diverted from it invigorating\r\nrills to refresh the garden of literature. By his own example and\r\nconstant exertions, he has effected that union of commerce and the\r\nintellectual pursuits, so eloquently recommended in one of his latest\r\nwritings;* and has practically proved how beautifully they may be\r\nbrought to harmonize, and to benefit each other. The noble institutions\r\nfor literary and scientific purposes, which reflect such credit on\r\nLiverpool, and are giving such an impulse to the public mind, have\r\nmostly been originated, and have all been effectively promoted, by\r\nMr. Roscoe; and when we consider the rapidly increasing opulence and\r\nmagnitude of that town, which promises to vie in commercial importance\r\nwith the metropolis, it will be perceived that in awakening an ambition\r\nof mental improvement among its inhabitants, he has effected a great\r\nbenefit to the cause of British literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Address on the opening of the Liverpool Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America, we know Mr. Roscoe only as the author; in Liverpool he is\r\nspoken of as the banker; and I was told of his having been unfortunate\r\nin business. I could not pity him, as I heard some rich men do. I\r\nconsidered him far above the reach of pity. Those who live only for the\r\nworld, and in the world, may be cast down by the frowns of adversity;\r\nbut a man like Roscoe is not to be overcome by the reverses of fortune.\r\nThey do but drive him in upon the resources of his own mind, to the\r\nsuperior society of his own thoughts; which the best of men are apt\r\nsometimes to neglect, and to roam abroad in search of less worthy\r\nassociates. He is independent of the world around him. He lives with\r\nantiquity, and with posterity: with antiquity, in the sweet communion of\r\nstudious retirement; and with posterity, in the generous aspirings\r\nafter future renown. The solitude of such a mind is its state of highest\r\nenjoyment. It is then visited by those elevated meditations which\r\nare the proper aliment of noble souls, and are, like manna, sent from\r\nheaven, in the wilderness of this world.\r\n\r\nWhile my feelings were yet alive on the subject, it was my fortune\r\nto light on further traces of Mr. Roscoe. I was riding out with a\r\ngentleman, to view the environs of Liverpool, when he turned off,\r\nthrough a gate, into some ornamented grounds. After riding a short\r\ndistance, we came to a spacious mansion of freestone, built in the\r\nGrecian style. It was not in the purest style, yet it had an air of\r\nelegance, and the situation was delightful. A fine lawn sloped away from\r\nit, studded with clumps of trees, so disposed as to break a soft fertile\r\ncountry into a variety of landscapes. The Mersey was seen winding a\r\nbroad quiet sheet of water through an expanse of green meadow land,\r\nwhile the Welsh mountains, blended with clouds, and melting into\r\ndistance, bordered the horizon.\r\n\r\nThis was Roscoe’s favorite residence during the days of his prosperity.\r\nIt had been the seat of elegant hospitality and literary retirement. The\r\nhouse was now silent and deserted. I saw the windows of the study, which\r\nlooked out upon the soft scenery I have mentioned. The windows were\r\nclosed--the library was gone. Two or three ill-favored beings were\r\nloitering about the place, whom my fancy pictured into retainers of the\r\nlaw. It was like visiting some classic fountain, that had once welled\r\nits pure waters in a sacred shade, but finding it dry and dusty, with\r\nthe lizard and the toad brooding over the shattered marbles.\r\n\r\nI inquired after the fate of Mr. Roscoe’s library, which had consisted\r\nof scarce and foreign books, from many of which he had drawn the\r\nmaterials for his Italian histories. It had passed under the hammer of\r\nthe auctioneer, and was dispersed about the country. The good people\r\nof the vicinity thronged liked wreckers to get some part of the\r\nnoble vessel that had been driven on shore. Did such a scene admit of\r\nludicrous associations, we might imagine something whimsical in this\r\nstrange irruption in the regions of learning. Pigmies rummaging the\r\narmory of a giant, and contending for the possession of weapons which\r\nthey could not wield. We might picture to ourselves some knot of\r\nspeculators, debating with calculating brow over the quaint binding and\r\nilluminated margin of an obsolete author; of the air of intense, but\r\nbaffled sagacity, with which some successful purchaser attempted to dive\r\ninto the black-letter bargain he had secured.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful incident in the story of Mr. Roscoe’s misfortunes, and\r\none which cannot fail to interest the studious mind, that the parting\r\nwith his books seems to have touched upon his tenderest feelings, and\r\nto have been the only circumstance that could provoke the notice of\r\nhis muse. The scholar only knows how dear these silent, yet eloquent,\r\ncompanions of pure thoughts and innocent hours become in the season of\r\nadversity. When all that is worldly turns to dross around us, these only\r\nretain their steady value. When friends grow cold, and the converse of\r\nintimates languishes into vapid civility and commonplace, these only\r\ncontinue the unaltered countenance of happier days, and cheer us with\r\nthat true friendship which never deceived hope, nor deserted sorrow.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to censure; but, surely, if the people of Liverpool had\r\nbeen properly sensible of what was due to Mr. Roscoe and themselves, his\r\nlibrary would never have been sold. Good worldly reasons may, doubtless,\r\nbe given for the circumstance, which it would be difficult to combat\r\nwith others that might seem merely fanciful; but it certainly appears\r\nto me such an opportunity as seldom occurs, of cheering a noble mind\r\nstruggling under misfortunes by one of the most delicate, but most\r\nexpressive tokens of public sympathy. It is difficult, however, to\r\nestimate a man of genius properly who is daily before our eyes. He\r\nbecomes mingled and confounded with other men. His great qualities lose\r\ntheir novelty; we become too familiar with the common materials which\r\nform the basis even of the loftiest character. Some of Mr. Roscoe’s\r\ntownsmen may regard him merely as a man of business; others, as\r\na politician; all find him engaged like themselves in ordinary\r\noccupations, and surpassed, perhaps, by themselves on some points of\r\nworldly wisdom. Even that amiable and unostentatious simplicity of\r\ncharacter, which gives the nameless grace to real excellence, may cause\r\nhim to be undervalued by some coarse minds, who do not know that true\r\nworth is always void of glare and pretension. But the man of letters,\r\nwho speaks of Liverpool, speaks of it as the residence of Roscoe.--The\r\nintelligent traveller who visits it inquires where Roscoe is to be seen.\r\nHe is the literary landmark of the place, indicating its existence to\r\nthe distant scholar.--He is like Pompey’s column at Alexandria, towering\r\nalone in classic dignity.\r\n\r\nThe following sonnet, addressed by Mr. Roscoe to his books, on parting\r\nwith them, has already been alluded to. If anything can add effect\r\nto the pure feeling and elevated thought here displayed, it is the\r\nconviction, that the who leis no effusion of fancy, but a faithful\r\ntranscript from the writer’s heart.\r\n\r\n                TO MY BOOKS.\r\n\r\n  As one who, destined from his friends to part,\r\n    Regrets his loss, but hopes again erewhile\r\n    To share their converse and enjoy their smile,\r\n  And tempers as he may affliction’s dart;\r\n\r\n  Thus, loved associates, chiefs of elder art,\r\n    Teachers of wisdom, who could once beguile\r\n    My tedious hours, and lighten every toil,\r\n  I now resign you; nor with fainting heart;\r\n\r\n  For pass a few short years, or days, or hours,\r\n    And happier seasons may their dawn unfold,\r\n    And all your sacred fellowship restore:\r\n  When, freed from earth, unlimited its powers.\r\n  Mind shall with mind direct communion hold,\r\n   And kindred spirits meet to part no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE.\r\n\r\n    The treasures of the deep are not so precious\r\n    As are the concealed comforts of a man\r\n    Lock’d up in woman’s love. I scent the air\r\n    Of blessings, when I came but near the house,\r\n    What a delicious breath marriage sends forth--\r\n    The violet bed’s no sweeter!\r\n                                         MIDDLETON.\r\n\r\nI HAVE often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women\r\nsustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune. Those disasters which\r\nbreak down the spirit of a man, and prostrate him in the dust, seem to\r\ncall forth all the energies of the softer sex, and give such intrepidity\r\nand elevation to their character, that at times it approaches to\r\nsublimity. Nothing can be more touching, than to behold a soft and\r\ntender female, who had been all weakness and dependence, and alive to\r\nevery trivial roughness, while threading the prosperous paths of life,\r\nsuddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and support of her\r\nhusband under misfortune, and abiding with unshrinking firmness the\r\nbitterest blasts of adversity.\r\n\r\nAs the vine, which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak,\r\nand been lifted by it into sunshine, will, when the hardy plant is\r\nrifted by the thunderbolt, cling round it with its caressing tendrils,\r\nand bind up its shattered boughs, so is it beautifully ordered by\r\nProvidence, that woman, who is the mere dependent and ornament of man\r\nin his happier hours, should be his stay and solace when smitten with\r\nsudden calamity; winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature,\r\ntenderly supporting the drooping head, and binding up the broken heart.\r\n\r\nI was once congratulating a friend, who had around him a blooming\r\nfamily, knit together in the strongest affection. “I can wish you\r\nno better lot,” said he, with enthusiasm, “than to have a wife\r\nand children. If you are prosperous, there they are to share your\r\nprosperity; if otherwise, there they are to comfort you.” And, indeed, I\r\nhave observed that a married man falling into misfortune, is more apt to\r\nretrieve his situation in the world than a single one; partly, because\r\nhe is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and\r\nbeloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence, but chiefly because\r\nhis spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments, and his\r\nself-respect kept alive by finding, that, though all abroad is darkness\r\nand humiliation, yet there is still a little world of love at home, of\r\nwhich he is the monarch. Whereas, a single man is apt to run to waste\r\nand self-neglect; to fancy himself lonely and abandoned, and his heart\r\nto fall to ruin, like some deserted mansion, for want of an inhabitant.\r\n\r\nThese observations call to mind a little domestic story, of which I was\r\nonce a witness. My intimate friend, Leslie, had married a beautiful and\r\naccomplished girl, who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable\r\nlife. She had, it is true, no fortune, but that of my friend was ample;\r\nand he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in every elegant\r\npursuit, and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that\r\nspread a kind of witchery about the sex.--“Her life,” said he, “shall be\r\nlike a fairy tale.”\r\n\r\nThe very difference in their characters produced a harmonious\r\ncombination; he was of a romantic, and somewhat serious cast; she was\r\nall life and gladness. I have often noticed the mute rapture with which\r\nhe would gaze upon her in company, of which her sprightly powers made\r\nher the delight: and how, in the midst of applause, her eye would still\r\nturn to him, as if there alone she sought favor and acceptance. When\r\nleaning on his arm, her slender form contrasted finely with his tall,\r\nmanly person. The fond, confiding air with which she looked up to\r\nhim seemed to call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing\r\ntenderness, as if he doated on his lovely burden from its very\r\nhelplessness. Never did a couple set forward on the flowery path of\r\nearly and well-suited marriage with a fairer prospect of felicity.\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of my friend, however, to have embarked his\r\nproperty in large speculations; and he had not been married many months,\r\nwhen, by a succession of sudden disasters, it was swept from him, and he\r\nfound himself reduced to almost penury. For a time he kept his situation\r\nto himself, and went about with a haggard countenance, and a breaking\r\nheart. His life was but a protracted agony; and what rendered it more\r\ninsupportable was the necessity of keeping up a smile in the presence of\r\nhis wife; for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the news.\r\nShe saw, however, with the quick eyes of affection, that all was not\r\nwell with him. She marked his altered looks and stifled sighs, and was\r\nnot to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness. She\r\ntasked all her sprightly powers and tender blandishments to win him back\r\nto happiness; but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul. The\r\nmore he saw cause to love her, the more torturing was the thought that\r\nhe was soon to make her wretched. A little while, thought he, and the\r\nsmile will vanish from that cheek--the song will die away from those\r\nlips--the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow and the\r\nhappy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom, will be weighed down,\r\nlike mine, by the cares and miseries of the world.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to me one day, and related his whole situation in a\r\ntone of the deepest despair. When I had heard him through, I inquired:\r\n“Does your wife know all this?”--At the question he burst into an agony\r\nof tears. “For God’s sake!” cried he, “if you have any pity on me don’t\r\nmention my wife; it is the thought of her that drives me almost to\r\nmadness!”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” said I. “She must know it sooner or later: you cannot\r\nkeep it long from her, and the intelligence may break upon her in a more\r\nstartling manner than if imparted by yourself; for the accents of those\r\nwe love soften the harshest tidings. Besides, you are depriving\r\nyourself of the comforts of her sympathy; and not merely that, but also\r\nendangering the only bond that can keep hearts together--an unreserved\r\ncommunity of thought and feeling. She will soon perceive that something\r\nis secretly preying upon your mind; and true love will not brook\r\nreserve; it feels undervalued and outraged, when even the sorrows of\r\nthose it loves are concealed from it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but my friend! to think what a blow I am to give to all her future\r\nprospects,--how I am to strike her very soul to the earth, by telling\r\nher that her husband is a beggar! that she is to forego all the\r\nelegancies of life--all the pleasures of society--to shrink with me into\r\nindigence and obscurity! To tell her that I have dragged her down\r\nfrom the sphere in which she might have continued to move in constant\r\nbrightness--the light of every eye--the admiration of every heart!--How\r\ncan she bear poverty? She has been brought up in all the refinements of\r\nopulence. How can she bear neglect? She has been the idol of society.\r\nOh, it will break her heart--it will break her heart!”\r\n\r\nI saw his grief was eloquent, and I let it have its flow; for sorrow\r\nrelieves itself by words. When his paroxysm had subsided, and he had\r\nrelapsed into moody silence, I resumed the subject gently, and urged\r\nhim to break his situation at once to his wife. He shook his head\r\nmournfully, but positively.\r\n\r\n“But how are you to keep it from her? It is necessary she should\r\nknow it, that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your\r\ncircumstances. You must change your style of living--nay,” observing a\r\npang to pass across his countenance, “don’t let that afflict you. I am\r\nsure you have never placed your happiness in outward show--you have yet\r\nfriends, warm friends, who will not think the worse of you for being\r\nless splendidly lodged: and surely it does not require a palace to be\r\nhappy with Mary--”\r\n\r\n“I could be happy with her,” cried he, convulsively, “in a hovel!--I\r\ncould go down with her into poverty and the dust!--I could--I could--God\r\nbless her!--God bless her!” cried he, bursting into a transport of grief\r\nand tenderness.\r\n\r\n“And believe me, my friend,” said I, stepping up, and grasping him\r\nwarmly by the hand, “believe me, she can be the same with you. Ay, more;\r\nit will be a source of pride and triumph to her--it will call forth all\r\nthe latent energies and fervent sympathies of her nature; for she will\r\nrejoice to prove that she loves you for yourself. There is in every true\r\nwoman’s heart a spark of heavenly fire, which lies dormant in the broad\r\ndaylight of prosperity; but which kindles up, and beams, and blazes\r\nin the dark hour of adversity. No man knows what the wife of his bosom\r\nis--no man knows what a ministering angel she is--until he has gone with\r\nher through the fiery trials of this world.”\r\n\r\nThere was something in the earnestness of my manner, and the figurative\r\nstyle of my language, that caught the excited imagination of Leslie. I\r\nknew the auditor I had to deal with; and following up the impression I\r\nhad made, I finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his sad\r\nheart to his wife.\r\n\r\nI must confess, notwithstanding all I had said, I felt some little\r\nsolicitude for the result. Who can calculate on the fortitude of one\r\nwhose life has been a round of pleasures? Her gay spirits might revolt\r\nat the dark, downward path of low humility suddenly pointed out before\r\nher, and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had hitherto\r\nrevelled. Besides, ruin in fashionable life is accompanied by so many\r\ngalling mortifications, to which, in other ranks, it is a stranger. In\r\nshort, I could not meet Leslie, the next morning, without trepidation.\r\nHe had made the disclosure.\r\n\r\n“And how did she bear it?”\r\n\r\n“Like an angel! It seemed rather to be a relief to her mind, for she\r\nthrew her arms around my neck, and asked if this was all that had lately\r\nmade me unhappy.--But, poor girl,” added he, “she cannot realize the\r\nchange we must undergo. She has no idea of poverty but in the abstract;\r\nshe has only read of it in poetry, where it is allied to love. She feels\r\nas yet no privation; she suffers no loss of accustomed conveniences nor\r\nelegancies. When we come practically to experience its sordid cares, its\r\npaltry wants, its petty humiliations--then will be the real trial.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “now that you have got over the severest task, that of\r\nbreaking it to her, the sooner you let the world into the secret the\r\nbetter. The disclosure may be mortifying; but then it is a single\r\nmisery, and soon over: whereas you otherwise suffer it, in anticipation,\r\nevery hour in the day. It is not poverty, so much as pretence, that\r\nharasses a ruined man--the struggle between a proud mind and an empty\r\npurse-the keeping up a hollow show that must soon come to an end. Have\r\nthe courage to appear poor, and you disarm poverty of its sharpest\r\nsting.” On this point I found Leslie perfectly prepared. He had no false\r\npride himself, and as to his wife, she was only anxious to conform to\r\ntheir altered fortunes.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, he called upon me in the evening. He had disposed\r\nof his dwelling-house, and taken a small cottage in the country, a few\r\nmiles from town. He had been busied all day in sending out furniture.\r\nThe new establishment required few articles, and those of the simplest\r\nkind. All the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold,\r\nexcepting his wife’s harp. That, he said, was too closely associated\r\nwith the idea of herself it belonged to the little story of their loves;\r\nfor some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he\r\nhad leaned over that instrument, and listened to the melting tones of\r\nher voice.--I could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry\r\nin a doating husband.\r\n\r\nHe was now going out to the cottage, where his wife had been all\r\nday superintending its arrangement. My feelings had become strongly\r\ninterested in the progress of his family story, and, as it was a fine\r\nevening, I offered to accompany him.\r\n\r\nHe was wearied with the fatigues of the day, and, as we walked out, fell\r\ninto a fit of gloomy musing.\r\n\r\n“Poor Mary!” at length broke, with a heavy sigh, from his lips.\r\n\r\n“And what of her,” asked I, “has anything happened to her?”\r\n\r\n“What,” said he, darting an impatient glance, “is it nothing to be\r\nreduced to this paltry situation--to be caged in a miserable cottage--to\r\nbe obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched\r\nhabitation?”\r\n\r\nHas she then repined at the change?\r\n\r\n“Repined! she has been nothing but sweetness and good-humor. Indeed, she\r\nseems in better spirits than I have ever known her; she has been to me\r\nall love, and tenderness, and comfort!”\r\n\r\n“Admirable girl!” exclaimed I. “You call yourself poor, my friend;\r\nyou never were so rich,--you never knew the boundless treasures of\r\nexcellence you possessed in that woman.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! but, my friend, if this first meeting at the cottage were over,\r\nI think I could then be comfortable. But this is her first day of real\r\nexperience; she has been introduced into a humble dwelling,--she has\r\nbeen employed all day in arranging its miserable equipments,--she has,\r\nfor the first time, known the fatigues of domestic employment,--she has,\r\nfor the first time, looked around her on a home destitute of every thing\r\nelegant--almost of every thing convenient; and may now be sitting down,\r\nexhausted and spiritless, brooding over a prospect of future poverty.”\r\n\r\nThere was a degree of probability in this picture that I could not\r\ngainsay, so we walked on in silence.\r\n\r\nAfter turning from the main road up a narrow lane, so thickly shaded\r\nwith forest-trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion, we came\r\nin sight of the cottage. It was humble enough in its appearance for the\r\nmost pastoral poet; and yet it had a pleasing rural look. A wild vine\r\nhad overrun one end with a profusion of foliage; a few trees threw their\r\nbranches gracefully over it; and I observed several pots of flowers\r\ntastefully disposed about the door, and on the grass-plot in front.\r\nA small wicket-gate opened upon a footpath that wound through some\r\nshrubbery to the door. Just as we approached, we heard the sound of\r\nmusic--Leslie grasped my arm; we paused and listened. It was Mary’s\r\nvoice singing, in a style of the most touching simplicity, a little air\r\nof which her husband was peculiarly fond.\r\n\r\nI felt Leslie’s hand tremble on my arm. He stepped forward, to hear more\r\ndistinctly. His step made a noise on the gravel-walk. A bright beautiful\r\nface glanced out at the window, and vanished--a light footstep-was\r\nheard--and Mary came tripping forth to meet us. She was in a pretty\r\nrural dress of white; a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine\r\nhair; a fresh bloom was on her cheek; her whole countenance beamed with\r\nsmiles--I had never seen her look so lovely.\r\n\r\n“My dear George,” cried she, “I am so glad you are come; I have been\r\nwatching and watching for you; and running down the lane, and looking\r\nout for you. I’ve set out a table under a beautiful tree behind\r\nthe cottage; and I’ve been gathering some of the most delicious\r\nstrawberries, for I know you are fond of them--and we have such\r\nexcellent cream--and everything is so sweet and still here-Oh!”--said\r\nshe, putting her arm within his, and looking up brightly in his face,\r\n“Oh, we shall be so happy!”\r\n\r\nPoor Leslie was overcome.--He caught her to his bosom--he folded his\r\narms round her--he kissed her again and again--he could not speak, but\r\nthe tears gushed into his eyes; and he has often assured me, that\r\nthough the world has since gone prosperously with him, and his life has,\r\nindeed, been a happy one, yet never has he experienced a moment of more\r\nexquisite felicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIP VAN WINKLE.\r\n\r\nA POSTHUMOUS WRITING OF DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\n    By Woden, God of Saxons,\r\n    From whence comes Wensday, that is Wodensday,\r\n    Truth is a thing that ever I will keep\r\n    Unto thylke day in which I creep into\r\n    My sepulchre--\r\n                                        CARTWRIGHT.\r\n\r\n[The following Tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich\r\nKnickerbocker, an old gentleman of New York, who was very curious in the\r\nDutch History of the province and the manners of the descendants from\r\nits primitive settlers. His historical researches, however, did not lie\r\nso much among books as among men; for the former are lamentably scanty\r\non his favorite topics; whereas he found the old burghers, and still\r\nmore, their wives, rich in that legendary lore, so invaluable to true\r\nhistory. Whenever, therefore, he happened upon a genuine Dutch family,\r\nsnugly shut up in its low-roofed farm-house, under a spreading sycamore,\r\nhe looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter, and\r\nstudied it with the zeal of a bookworm.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these researches was a history of the province, during\r\nthe reign of the Dutch governors, which he published some years since.\r\nThere have been various opinions as to the literary character of his\r\nwork, and, to tell the truth, it is not a whit better than it should be.\r\nIts chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little\r\nquestioned on its first appearance, but has since been completely\r\nestablished; and it is now admitted into all historical collections, as\r\na book of unquestionable authority.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work; and\r\nnow that he is dead and gone, it cannot do much harm to his memory to\r\nsay that his time might have been much better employed in weightier\r\nlabors. He, however, was apt to ride his hobby his own way; and though\r\nit did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his\r\nneighbors, and grieve the spirit of some friends, for whom he felt\r\nthe truest deference and affection, yet his errors and follies\r\nare remembered “more in sorrow than in anger,” and it begins to be\r\nsuspected, that he never intended to injure or offend. But however his\r\nmemory may be appreciated by critics, it is still held dear among many\r\nfolks, whose good opinion is well worth having; particularly by certain\r\nbiscuit-bakers, who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their\r\nnew-year cakes, and have thus given him a chance for immortality,\r\nalmost equal to the being stamped on a Waterloo medal, or a Queen Anne’s\r\nfarthing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOEVER has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill\r\nmountains. They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian\r\nfamily, and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a\r\nnoble height, and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change\r\nof season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of the day\r\nproduces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains;\r\nand they are regarded by all the good wives, far and near, as perfect\r\nbarometers. When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in\r\nblue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky;\r\nbut sometimes, when the rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will\r\ngather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, in the last\r\nrays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried the\r\nlight smoke curling up from a Village, whose shingle roofs gleam among\r\nthe trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the\r\nfresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a little village of great\r\nantiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists, in the\r\nearly times of the province, just about the beginning of the government\r\nof the good Peter Stuyvesant (may he rest in peace!), and there were\r\nsome of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years,\r\nbuilt of small yellow bricks, brought from Holland, having latticed\r\nwindows and gable fronts, surmounted with weathercocks.\r\n\r\nIn that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to tell\r\nthe precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived,\r\nmany years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain,\r\na simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a\r\ndescendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous\r\ndays of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of Fort\r\nChristina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial character of\r\nhis ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple, good-natured man;\r\nhe was, moreover, a kind neighbor, and an obedient henpecked husband.\r\nIndeed, to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of\r\nspirit which gained him such universal popularity; for those men are apt\r\nto be obsequious and conciliating abroad, who are under the discipline\r\nof shrews at home. Their tempers, doubtless, are rendered pliant\r\nand malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation, and a\r\ncurtain-lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the\r\nvirtues of patience and long-suffering. A termagant wife may, therefore,\r\nin some respects, be considered a tolerable blessing, and if so, Rip Van\r\nWinkle was thrice blessed.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of\r\nthe village, who, as usual with the amiable sex, took his part in all\r\nfamily squabbles, and never failed, whenever they talked those matters\r\nover in their evening gossipings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van\r\nWinkle. The children of the village, too, would shout with joy whenever\r\nhe approached. He assisted at their sports, made their playthings,\r\ntaught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories\r\nof ghosts, witches, and Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the\r\nvillage, he was surrounded by a troop of them hanging on his skirts,\r\nclambering on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on him with\r\nimpunity; and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe great error in Rip’s composition was an insuperable aversion to\r\nall kinds of profitable labor. It could not be for want of assiduity\r\nor perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long\r\nand heavy as a Tartar’s lance, and fish all day without a murmur, even\r\nthough he should not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would carry\r\na fowling-piece on his shoulder, for hours together, trudging through\r\nwoods and swamps, and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels\r\nor wild pigeons. He would never refuse to assist a neighbor even in the\r\nroughest toil, and was a foremost man in all country frolics for husking\r\nIndian corn, or building stone fences; the women of the village, too,\r\nused to employ him to run their errands, and to do such little odd jobs\r\nas their less obliging husbands would not do for them. In a word, Rip\r\nwas ready to attend to anybody’s business but his own; but as to doing\r\nfamily duty, and keeping his farm in order, he found it impossible.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he declared it was of no use to work on his farm; it was the\r\nmost pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country; everything\r\nabout it went wrong, in spite of him. His fences were continually\r\nfalling to pieces; his cow would either go astray, or get among the\r\ncabbages; weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere\r\nelse; the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some\r\nout-door work to do; so that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled\r\naway under his management, acre by acre, until there was little more\r\nleft than a mere patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet it was the\r\nworst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHis children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to\r\nnobody. His son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness, promised\r\nto inherit the habits, with the old clothes, of his father. He was\r\ngenerally seen trooping like a colt at his mother’s heels, equipped in\r\na pair of his father’s cast-off galligaskins, which he had much ado to\r\nhold up with one hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.\r\n\r\nRip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals, of foolish,\r\nwell-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or\r\nbrown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would\r\nrather starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he\r\nwould have whistled life away, in perfect contentment; but his wife kept\r\ncontinually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness,\r\nand the ruin he was bringing on his family. Morning, noon, and night,\r\nher tongue was incessantly going, and every thing he said or did was\r\nsure to produce a torrent of household eloquence. Rip had but one way\r\nof replying to all lectures of the kind, and that, by frequent use, had\r\ngrown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast\r\nup his eyes, but said nothing. This, however, always provoked a fresh\r\nvolley from his wife, so that he was fain to draw off his forces, and\r\ntake to the outside of the house--the only side which, in truth, belongs\r\nto a henpecked husband.\r\n\r\nRip’s sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much henpecked\r\nas his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions in\r\nidleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of\r\nhis master’s going so often astray. True it is, in all points of spirit\r\nbefitting in honorable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever\r\nscoured the woods--but what courage can withstand the evil-doing and\r\nall-besetting terrors of a woman’s tongue? The moment Wolf entered the\r\nhouse his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground or curled between\r\nhis legs, he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong\r\nglance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or\r\nladle, he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation.\r\n\r\nTimes grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony\r\nrolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue\r\nis the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. For a long\r\nwhile he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting\r\na kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle\r\npersonages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a\r\nsmall inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his Majesty George the\r\nThird. Here they used to sit in the shade through a long, lazy summer’s\r\nday, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless, sleepy\r\nstories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman’s\r\nmoney to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place,\r\nwhen by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing\r\ntraveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled\r\nout by Derrick Van Bummel, the school-master, a dapper learned little\r\nman, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the\r\ndictionary; and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some\r\nmonths after they had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas\r\nVedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the\r\ndoor of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving\r\nsufficiently to avoid the sun, and keep in the shade of a large tree; so\r\nthat the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as\r\nby a sun-dial. It is true, he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked his\r\npipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has\r\nhis adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew how to gather his\r\nopinions. When any thing that was read or related displeased him, he was\r\nobserved to smoke his pipe vehemently, and to send forth frequent, and\r\nangry puffs; but when pleased, he would inhale the smoke slowly and\r\ntranquilly, and emit it in light and placid clouds, and sometimes,\r\ntaking the pipe from his mouth, and letting the fragrant vapor curl\r\nabout his nose, would gravely nod his head in token of perfect\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nFrom even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by his\r\ntermagant wife, who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of\r\nthe assemblage, and call the members all to nought; nor was that august\r\npersonage, Nicholas Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of\r\nthis terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging her\r\nhusband in habits of idleness.\r\n\r\nPoor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only\r\nalternative, to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his\r\nwife, was to take gun in hand, and stroll away into the woods. Here\r\nhe would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share\r\nthe contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a\r\nfellow-sufferer in persecution. “Poor Wolf,” he would say, “thy mistress\r\nleads thee a dog’s life of it; but never mind, my lad, whilst I live\r\nthou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee!” Wolf would wag his\r\ntail, look wistfully in his master’s face, and if dogs can feel pity, I\r\nverily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.\r\n\r\nIn a long ramble of the kind, on a fine autumnal day, Rip had\r\nunconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Kaatskill\r\nmountains. He was after his favorite sport of squirrel-shooting, and the\r\nstill solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun.\r\nPanting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a\r\ngreen knoll, covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a\r\nprecipice. From an opening between the trees, he could overlook all the\r\nlower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance\r\nthe lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic\r\ncourse, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging\r\nbark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom and at last losing\r\nitself in the blue highlands.\r\n\r\nOn the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild,\r\nlonely, and shagged, the bottom filled with fragments from the impending\r\ncliffs, and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting\r\nsun. For some time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually\r\nadvancing; the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over\r\nthe valleys; he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the\r\nvillage; and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the\r\nterrors of Dame Van Winkle.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to descend, he heard a voice from a distance hallooing:\r\n“Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around, but could see\r\nnothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain. He\r\nthought his fancy must have deceived him, and turned again to descend,\r\nwhen he heard the same cry ring through the still evening air, “Rip Van\r\nWinkle! Rip Van Winkle!”--at the same time Wolf bristled up his back,\r\nand giving a low growl, skulked to his master’s side, looking fearfully\r\ndown into the glen. Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over\r\nhim; he looked anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a strange\r\nfigure slowly toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight of\r\nsomething he carried on his back. He was surprised to see any human\r\nbeing in this lonely and unfrequented place, but supposing it to be some\r\none of the neighborhood in need of his assistance, he hastened down to\r\nyield it.\r\n\r\nOn nearer approach, he was still more surprised at the singularity of\r\nthe stranger’s appearance. He was a short, square-built old fellow, with\r\nthick bushy hair, and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique\r\nDutch fashion--a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist--several pairs of\r\nbreeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons\r\ndown the sides, and bunches at the knees. He bore on his shoulders\r\na stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to\r\napproach and assist him with the load. Though rather shy and distrustful\r\nof this new acquaintance, Rip complied with his usual alacrity; and\r\nmutually relieving each other, they clambered up a narrow gully,\r\napparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As they ascended, Rip\r\nevery now and then heard long rolling peals, like distant thunder, that\r\nseemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft between lofty\r\nrocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He paused for an\r\ninstant, but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient\r\nthunder-showers which often take place in the mountain heights, he\r\nproceeded. Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a\r\nsmall amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the\r\nbrinks of which impending trees shot their branches, so that you only\r\ncaught glimpses of the azure sky, and the bright evening cloud. During\r\nthe whole time Rip and his companion had labored on in silence; for\r\nthough the former marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying\r\na keg of liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something strange\r\nand incomprehensible about the unknown, that inspired awe, and checked\r\nfamiliarity.\r\n\r\nOn entering the amphitheatre, new objects of wonder presented\r\nthemselves. On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking\r\npersonages playing at ninepins. They were dressed in quaint outlandish\r\nfashion; some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in\r\ntheir belts, and most of them had enormous breeches, of similar style\r\nwith that of the guide’s. Their visages, too, were peculiar; one had\r\na large head, broad face, and small piggish eyes; the face of another\r\nseemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted by a white\r\nsugar-loaf hat, set off with a little red cock’s tail. They all had\r\nbeards, of various shapes and colors. There was one who seemed to be\r\nthe commander. He was a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten\r\ncountenance; he wore a laced doublet, broad belt and hanger,\r\nhigh-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and high-heeled shoes, with\r\nroses in them. The whole group reminded Rip of the figures in an old\r\nFlemish painting, in the parlor of Dominie Van Schaick, the village\r\nparson, and which had been brought over from Holland at the time of the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nWhat seemed particularly odd to Rip was, that though these folks were\r\nevidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the\r\nmost mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of\r\npleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted the stillness of\r\nthe scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled,\r\nechoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder.\r\n\r\nAs Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly desisted from\r\ntheir play, and stared at him with such a fixed statue-like gaze, and\r\nsuch strange uncouth, lack-lustre countenances, that his heart turned\r\nwithin him, and his knees smote together. His companion now emptied the\r\ncontents of the keg into large flagons, and made signs to him to wait\r\nupon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling; they quaffed the\r\nliquor in profound silence, and then returned to their game.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, Rip’s awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured, when\r\nno eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage which he found had much\r\nof the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty soul,\r\nand was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked another;\r\nand he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often, that at length his\r\nsenses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head gradually\r\ndeclined, and he fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nOn waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had first\r\nseen the old man of the glen. He rubbed his eyes--it was a bright sunny\r\nmorning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes, and\r\nthe eagle was wheeling aloft, and breasting the pure mountain breeze.\r\n“Surely,” thought Rip, “I have not slept here all night.” He recalled\r\nthe occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange man with the keg\r\nof liquor--the mountain ravine--the wild retreat among the rocks--the\r\nwoe-begone party at ninepins--the flagon--“Oh! that flagon! that wicked\r\nflagon!” thought Rip--“what excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?”\r\n\r\nHe looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean well-oiled\r\nfowling-piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel\r\nencrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten. He\r\nnow suspected that the grave roysterers of the mountains had put a trick\r\nupon him, and, having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his\r\ngun. Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a\r\nsquirrel or partridge. He whistled after him and shouted his name, but\r\nall in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nHe determined to revisit the scene of the last evening’s gambol, and if\r\nhe met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to\r\nwalk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting in his usual\r\nactivity. “These mountain beds do not agree with me,” thought Rip, “and\r\nif this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall\r\nhave a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.” With some difficulty he got\r\ndown into the glen: he found the gully up which he and his companion\r\nhad ascended the preceding evening; but to his astonishment a mountain\r\nstream was now foaming down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling\r\nthe glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble\r\nup its sides, working his toilsome way through thickets of birch,\r\nsassafras, and witch-hazel; and sometimes tripped up or entangled by\r\nthe wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to\r\ntree, and spread a kind of network in his path.\r\n\r\nAt length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs\r\nto the amphitheatre; but no traces of such opening remained. The rocks\r\npresented a high impenetrable wall, over which the torrent came tumbling\r\nin a sheet of feathery foam, and fell into a broad deep basin, black\r\nfrom the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then, poor Rip was\r\nbrought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his dog; he was\r\nonly answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows, sporting high\r\nin the air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice; and who,\r\nsecure in their elevation, seemed to look down and scoff at the poor\r\nman’s perplexities. What was to be done? The morning was passing away,\r\nand Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast. He grieved to give up\r\nhis dog and gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to\r\nstarve among the mountains. He shook his head, shouldered the rusty\r\nfirelock, and, with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his\r\nsteps homeward.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none\r\nwhom he new, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself\r\nacquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was\r\nof a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all\r\nstared at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever they cast eyes\r\nupon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence of\r\nthis gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his\r\nastonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!\r\n\r\nHe had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange\r\nchildren ran at his heels, hooting after him, and pointing at his\r\ngray beard. The dogs, too, not one of which he recognized for an old\r\nacquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered:\r\nit was larger and more populous. There were rows of houses which he\r\nhad never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had\r\ndisappeared. Strange names were over the doors--strange faces at the\r\nwindows--everything was strange. His mind now misgave him; he began\r\nto doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched.\r\nSurely this was his native village, which he had left but a day before.\r\nThere stood the Kaatskill mountains--there ran the silver Hudson at\r\na distance--there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always\r\nbeen--Rip was sorely perplexed--“That flagon last night,” thought he,\r\n“has addled my poor head sadly!”\r\n\r\nIt was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house,\r\nwhich he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the\r\nshrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay--the\r\nroof had fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges.\r\nA half-starved dog, that looked like Wolf, was skulking about it. Rip\r\ncalled him by name, but the cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed\r\non. This was an unkind cut indeed--“My very dog,” sighed poor Rip, “has\r\nforgotten me!”\r\n\r\nHe entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had\r\nalways kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn, and apparently\r\nabandoned. This desolateness overcame all his connubial fears--he called\r\nloudly for his wife and children--the lonely chambers rang for a moment\r\nwith his voice, and then all again was silence.\r\n\r\nHe now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village\r\ninn--but it too was gone. A large rickety wooden building stood in its\r\nplace, with great gaping windows, some of them broken, and mended with\r\nold hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted, “The Union\r\nHotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.” Instead of the great tree that used to\r\nshelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a tall\r\nnaked pole, with something on the top that looked like a red nightcap,\r\nand from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular assemblage\r\nof stars and stripes--all this was strange and incomprehensible. He\r\nrecognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George,\r\nunder which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe, but even this was\r\nsingularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and\r\nbuff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre, the head\r\nwas decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large\r\ncharacters, “GENERAL WASHINGTON.”\r\n\r\nThere was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none that Rip\r\nrecollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was\r\na busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the accustomed\r\nphlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He looked in vain for the sage Nicholas\r\nVedder, with his broad face, double chin, and fair long pipe, uttering\r\nclouds of tobacco-smoke, instead of idle speeches; or Van Bummel, the\r\nschoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper. In\r\nplace of these, a lean, bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full\r\nof handbills, was haranguing, vehemently about rights of\r\ncitizens-elections--members of Congress--liberty--Bunker’s hill--heroes\r\nof seventy-six-and other words, which were a perfect Babylonish jargon\r\nto the bewildered Van Winkle.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty\r\nfowling-piece, his uncouth dress, and the army of women and children at\r\nhis heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They\r\ncrowded round him, eying him from head to foot, with great curiosity.\r\nThe orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired,\r\n“on which side he voted?” Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short\r\nbut busy little fellow pulled him by the arm, and rising on tiptoe,\r\ninquired in his ear, “whether he was Federal or Democrat.” Rip\r\nwas equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing,\r\nself-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way\r\nthrough the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as\r\nhe passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo,\r\nthe other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating,\r\nas it were, into his very soul, demanded in an austere tone, “What\r\nbrought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his\r\nheels; and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor, quiet\r\nman, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King, God bless\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nHere a general shout burst from the bystanders-“a tory! a tory! a spy!\r\na refugee! hustle him! away with him!” It was with great difficulty\r\nthat the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and having\r\nassumed a tenfold austerity of brow, demanded again of the unknown\r\nculprit, what he came there for, and whom he was seeking. The poor\r\nman humbly assured him that he meant no harm, but merely came there in\r\nsearch of some of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.\r\n\r\n“Well--who are they?--name them.”\r\n\r\nRip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, Where’s Nicholas Vedder?\r\n\r\nThere was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in a\r\nthin, piping voice, “Nicholas Vedder? why, he is dead and gone these\r\neighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used\r\nto tell all about him, but that’s rotten and gone too.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s Brom Dutcher?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say he\r\nwas killed at the storming of Stony-Point--others say he was drowned in\r\na squall at the foot of Antony’s Nose. I don’t know--he never came back\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?”\r\n\r\n“He went off to the wars, too; was a great militia general, and is now\r\nin Congress.”\r\n\r\nRip’s heart died away, at hearing of these sad changes in his home\r\nand friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer\r\npuzzled him too, by treating of such enormous lapses of time, and of\r\nmatters which he could not understand: war--Congress-Stony-Point;--he\r\nhad no courage to ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair,\r\n“Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Rip Van Winkle!” exclaimed two or three. “Oh, to be sure! that’s\r\nRip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.”\r\n\r\nRip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself as he went up\r\nthe mountain; apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor\r\nfellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and\r\nwhether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment,\r\nthe man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what was his name?\r\n\r\n“God knows!” exclaimed he at his wit’s end; “I’m not myself--I’m\r\nsomebody else--that’s me yonder-no--that’s somebody else, got into my\r\nshoes--I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on the mountain, and\r\nthey’ve changed my gun, and everything’s changed, and I’m changed, and I\r\ncan’t tell what’s my name, or who I am!”\r\n\r\nThe by-standers began now to look at each other, nod, wink\r\nsignificantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was\r\na whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from\r\ndoing mischief; at the very suggestion of which, the self-important man\r\nwith the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical\r\nmoment a fresh, comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep\r\nat the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which,\r\nfrightened at his looks, began to cry. “Hush, Rip,” cried she, “hush,\r\nyou little fool; the old man won’t hurt you.” The name of the child,\r\nthe air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train of\r\nrecollections in his mind.\r\n\r\n“What is your name, my good woman?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Judith Cardenier.”\r\n\r\n“And your father’s name?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, but it’s twenty years\r\nsince he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of\r\nsince,--his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself,\r\nor was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a\r\nlittle girl.”\r\n\r\nRip had but one more question to ask; but he put it with a faltering\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“Where’s your mother?”\r\n\r\nOh, she too had died but a short time since; she broke a blood-vessel in\r\na fit of passion at a New-England pedler.\r\n\r\nThere was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest\r\nman could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and her\r\nchild in his arms. “I am your father!” cried he-“Young Rip Van Winkle\r\nonce-old Rip Van Winkle now--Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle!”\r\n\r\nAll stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the\r\ncrowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for\r\na moment exclaimed, “sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle--it is himself.\r\nWelcome home again, old neighbor. Why, where have you been these twenty\r\nlong years?”\r\n\r\nRip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him\r\nbut as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some were\r\nseen to wink at each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks; and\r\nthe self-important man in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over,\r\nhad returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth, and\r\nshook his head--upon which there was a general shaking of the head\r\nthroughout the assemblage.\r\n\r\nIt was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter Vanderdonk,\r\nwho was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a descendant of the\r\nhistorian of that name, who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the\r\nprovince. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well\r\nversed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood.\r\nHe recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner. He assured the company that it was a fact, handed\r\ndown from his ancestor, the historian, that the Kaatskill mountains had\r\nalways been haunted by strange beings. That it was affirmed that the\r\ngreat Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country,\r\nkept a kind of vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the\r\nHalf-moon; being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his\r\nenterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city\r\ncalled by his name. That his father had once seen them in their old\r\nDutch dresses playing at ninepins in the hollow of the mountain; and\r\nthat he himself had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound of their\r\nballs, like distant peals of thunder.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, the company broke up, and returned to the\r\nmore important concerns of the election. Rip’s daughter took him home to\r\nlive with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout cheery\r\nfarmer for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that\r\nused to climb upon his back. As to Rip’s son and heir, who was the ditto\r\nof himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on\r\nthe farm; but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to any thing\r\nelse but his business.\r\n\r\nRip now resumed his old walks and habits; he soon found many of his\r\nformer cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of\r\ntime; and preferred making friends among the rising generation, with\r\nwhom he soon grew into great favor.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing to do at home, and being arrived at that happy age when a\r\nman can be idle with impunity, he took his place once more on the bench,\r\nat the inn door, and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the\r\nvillage, and a chronicle of the old times “before the war.” It was some\r\ntime before he could get into the regular track of gossip, or could be\r\nmade to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his\r\ntorpor. How that there had been a revolutionary war--that the country\r\nhad thrown off the yoke of old England--and that, instead of being a\r\nsubject to his Majesty George the Third, he was now a free citizen\r\nof the United States. Rip, in fact, was no politician; the changes of\r\nstates and empires made but little impression on him; but there was\r\none species of despotism under which he had long groaned, and that\r\nwas--petticoat government. Happily, that was at an end; he had got his\r\nneck out of the yoke of matrimony, and could go in and out whenever he\r\npleased, without dreading the tyranny of Dame Van Winkle. Whenever her\r\nname was mentioned, however, he shook his head, shrugged his shoulders,\r\nand cast up his eyes; which might pass either for an expression of\r\nresignation to his fate, or joy at his deliverance.\r\n\r\nHe used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at Mr.\r\nDoolittle’s hotel. He was observed, at first, to vary on some points\r\nevery time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so\r\nrecently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have\r\nrelated, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighborhood, but knew it\r\nby heart. Some always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and insisted\r\nthat Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point on which\r\nhe always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost\r\nuniversally gave it full credit. Even to this day, they never hear a\r\nthunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say\r\nHendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins; and it is\r\na common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life\r\nhangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out\r\nof Rip Van Winkle’s flagon.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing tale, one would suspect, had been suggested to Mr.\r\nKnickerbocker by a little German superstition about the Emperor\r\nFrederick der Rothbart and the Kypphauser mountain; the subjoined note,\r\nhowever, which had appended to the tale, shows that it is an absolute\r\nfact, narrated with his usual fidelity.\r\n\r\n“The story of Rip Van Winkle may seem incredible to many, but\r\nnevertheless I give it my full belief, for I know the vicinity of our\r\nold Dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvellous events and\r\nappearances. Indeed, I have heard many stranger stories than this, in\r\nthe villages along the Hudson; all of which were too well authenticated\r\nto admit of a doubt. I have even talked with Rip Van Winkle myself,\r\nwho, when last I saw him, was a very venerable old man, and so\r\nperfectly rational and consistent on every other point, that I think no\r\nconscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain; nay, I\r\nhave seen a certificate on the subject taken before a country justice,\r\nand signed with cross, in the justice’s own handwriting. The story,\r\ntherefore, is beyond the possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\n“D. K.”\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nThe following are travelling notes from a memorandum-book of Mr.\r\nKnickerbocker:\r\n\r\nThe Kaatsberg or Catskill mountains have always been a region full of\r\nfable. The Indians considered them the abode of spirits, who influenced\r\nthe weather, spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape, and\r\nsending good or bad hunting seasons. They were ruled by an old squaw\r\nspirit, said to be their mother. She dwelt on the highest peak of the\r\nCatskills, and had charge of the doors of day and night to open and shut\r\nthem at the proper hour. She hung up the new moons in the skies, and\r\ncut up the old ones into stars. In times of drought, if properly\r\npropitiated, she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and\r\nmorning dew, and send them off from the crest of the mountain, flake\r\nafter flake, like flakes of carded cotton, to float in the air; until,\r\ndissolved by the heat of the sun, they would fall in gentle showers,\r\ncausing the grass to spring, the fruits to ripen, and the corn to grow\r\nan inch an hour. If displeased, however, she would brew up clouds black\r\nas ink, sitting in the midst of them like a bottle-bellied spider in the\r\nmidst of its web; and when these clouds broke, woe betide the valleys!\r\n\r\nIn old times, say the Indian traditions, there was a kind of Manitou or\r\nSpirit, who kept about the wildest recesses of the Catskill mountains,\r\nand took a mischievous pleasure in wreaking all kind of evils and\r\nvexations upon the red men. Sometimes he would assume the form of a\r\nbear, a panther, or a deer, lead the bewildered hunter a weary chase\r\nthrough tangled forests and among ragged rocks, and then spring off with\r\na loud ho! ho! leaving him aghast on the brink of a beetling precipice\r\nor raging torrent.\r\n\r\nThe favorite abode of this Manitou is still shown. It is a rock or cliff\r\non the loneliest port of the mountains, and, from the flowering vines\r\nwhich clamber about it, and the wild flowers which abound in its\r\nneighborhood, is known by the name of the Garden Rock. Near the foot of\r\nit is a small lake, the haunt of the solitary bittern, with water-snakes\r\nbasking in the sun on the leaves of the pond-lilies which lie on the\r\nsurface. This place was held in great awe by the Indians, insomuch that\r\nthe boldest hunter would not pursue his game within its precincts. Once\r\nupon a time, however, a hunter who had lost his way penetrated to the\r\nGarden Rock, where he beheld a number of gourds placed in the crotches\r\nof trees. One of these he seized and made off with it, but in the hurry\r\nof his retreat he let it fall among the rocks, when a great stream\r\ngushed forth, which washed him away and swept him down precipices, where\r\nhe was dished to pieces, and the stream made its way to the Hudson, and\r\ncontinues to flow to the present day, being the identical stream known\r\nby the name of the Kaaterskill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH WRITERS ON AMERICA.\r\n\r\nMethinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation, rousting herself\r\nlike a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks;\r\nmethinks I see her as an eagle, mewing her mighty youth, and kindling\r\nher endazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam.--MILTON ON THE LIBERTY OF\r\nTHE PRESS.\r\n\r\nIT is with feelings of deep regret that I observe the literary animosity\r\ndaily growing up between England and America. Great curiosity has been\r\nawakened of late with respect to the United States, and the London press\r\nhas teemed with volumes of travels through the Republic; but they seem\r\nintended to diffuse error rather than knowledge; and so successful have\r\nthey been, that, notwithstanding the constant intercourse between\r\nthe nations, there is no people concerning whom the great mass of the\r\nBritish public have less pure information, or entertain more numerous\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nEnglish travellers are the best and the worst in the world. Where no\r\nmotives of pride or interest intervene, none can equal them for\r\nprofound and philosophical views of society, or faithful and graphical\r\ndescription of external objects; but when either the interest or\r\nreputation of their own country comes in collision with that of another,\r\nthey go to the opposite extreme, and forget their usual probity and\r\ncandor, in the indulgence of splenetic remark, and an illiberal spirit\r\nof ridicule.\r\n\r\nHence, their travels are more honest and accurate, the more remote the\r\ncountry described. I would place implicit confidence in an Englishman’s\r\ndescription of the regions beyond the cataracts of the Nile; of unknown\r\nislands in the Yellow Sea; of the interior of India; or of any other\r\ntract which other travellers might be apt to picture out with the\r\nillusions of their fancies. But I would cautiously receive his account\r\nof his immediate neighbors, and of those nations with which he is in\r\nhabits of most frequent intercourse. However I might be disposed to\r\ntrust his probity, I dare not trust his prejudices.\r\n\r\nIt has also been the peculiar lot of our country to be visited by the\r\nworst kind of English travellers. While men of philosophical spirit and\r\ncultivated minds have been sent from England to ransack the poles, to\r\npenetrate the deserts, and to study the manners and customs of barbarous\r\nnations, with which she can have no permanent intercourse of profit or\r\npleasure; it has been left to the broken-down tradesman, the scheming\r\nadventurer, the wandering mechanic, the Manchester and Birmingham agent,\r\nto be her oracles respecting America. From such sources she is content\r\nto receive her information respecting a country in a singular state of\r\nmoral and physical development; a country in which one of the greatest\r\npolitical experiments in the history of the world is now performing; and\r\nwhich presents the most profound and momentous studies to the statesman\r\nand the philosopher.\r\n\r\nThat such men should give prejudicial accounts of America, is not a\r\nmatter of surprise. The themes it offers for contemplation, are too vast\r\nand elevated for their capacities. The national character is yet in a\r\nstate of fermentation: it may have its frothiness and sediment, but\r\nits ingredients are sound and wholesome; it has already given proofs of\r\npowerful and generous qualities; and the whole promises to settle\r\ndown into something substantially excellent. But the causes which are\r\noperating to strengthen and ennoble it, and its daily indications of\r\nadmirable properties, are all lost upon these purblind observers; who\r\nare only affected by the little asperities incident to its present\r\nsituation. They are capable of judging only of the surface of things;\r\nof those matters which come in contact with their private interests and\r\npersonal gratifications. They miss some of the snug conveniences\r\nand petty comforts which belong to an old, highly-finished, and\r\nover-populous state of society; where the ranks of useful labor are\r\ncrowded, and many earn a painful and servile subsistence, by studying\r\nthe very caprices of appetite and self-indulgence. These minor comforts,\r\nhowever, are all-important in the estimation of narrow minds; which\r\neither do not perceive, or will not acknowledge, that they are more than\r\ncounterbalanced among us, by great and generally diffused blessings.\r\n\r\nThey may, perhaps, have been disappointed in some unreasonable\r\nexpectation of sudden gain. They may have pictured America to themselves\r\nan El Dorado, where gold and silver abounded, and the natives were\r\nlacking in sagacity, and where they were to become strangely and\r\nsuddenly rich, in some unforeseen but easy manner. The same weakness\r\nof mind that indulges absurd expectations, produces petulance in\r\ndisappointment. Such persons become embittered against the country on\r\nfinding that there, as everywhere else, a man must sow before he can\r\nreap; must win wealth by industry and talent; and must contend with the\r\ncommon difficulties of nature, and the shrewdness of an intelligent and\r\nenterprising people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, through mistaken or ill-directed hospitality, or from the\r\nprompt disposition to cheer and countenance the stranger, prevalent\r\namong my countrymen, they may have been treated with unwonted respect\r\nin America; and, having been accustomed all their lives to consider\r\nthemselves below the surface of good society, and brought up in a\r\nservile feeling of inferiority, they become arrogant, on the common\r\nboon of civility; they attribute to the lowliness of others their\r\nown elevation; and underrate a society where there are no artificial\r\ndistinctions, and where, by any chance, such individuals as themselves\r\ncan rise to consequence.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose, however, that information coming from such sources,\r\non a subject where the truth is so desirable, would be received with\r\ncaution by the censors of the press; that the motives of these men,\r\ntheir veracity, their opportunities of inquiry and observation, and\r\ntheir capacities for judging correctly, would be rigorously scrutinized,\r\nbefore their evidence was admitted, in such sweeping extent, against a\r\nkindred nation. The very reverse, however, is the case, and it furnishes\r\na striking instance of human inconsistency. Nothing can surpass the\r\nvigilance with which English critics will examine the credibility of\r\nthe traveller who publishes an account of some distant and comparatively\r\nunimportant country. How warily will they compare the measurements of a\r\npyramid, or the description of a ruin; and how sternly will they censure\r\nany inaccuracy in these contributions of merely curious knowledge, while\r\nthey will receive, with eagerness and unhesitating faith, the gross\r\nmisrepresentations of coarse and obscure writers, concerning a country\r\nwith which their own is placed in the most important and delicate\r\nrelations. Nay, they will even make these apocryphal volumes text-books,\r\non which to enlarge, with a zeal and an ability worthy of a more\r\ngenerous cause.\r\n\r\nI shall not, however, dwell on this irksome and hackneyed topic; nor\r\nshould I have adverted to it, but for the undue interest apparently\r\ntaken in it by my countrymen, and certain injurious effects which I\r\napprehend it might produce upon the national feeling. We attach too much\r\nconsequence to these attacks. They cannot do us any essential injury.\r\nThe tissue of misrepresentations attempted to be woven round us, are\r\nlike cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant. Our country\r\ncontinually outgrows them. One falsehood after another falls off of\r\nitself. We have but to live on, and every day we live a whole volume of\r\nrefutation.\r\n\r\nAll the writers of England united, if we could for a moment suppose\r\ntheir great minds stooping to so unworthy a combination, could not\r\nconceal our rapidly growing importance and matchless prosperity. They\r\ncould not conceal that these are owing, not merely to physical and\r\nlocal, but also to moral causes--to the political liberty, the general\r\ndiffusion of knowledge, the prevalence of sound, moral, and religious\r\nprinciples, which give force and sustained energy to the character of\r\na people, and which in fact, have been the acknowledged and wonderful\r\nsupporters of their own national power and glory.\r\n\r\nBut why are we so exquisitely alive to the aspersions of England? Why\r\ndo we suffer ourselves to be so affected by the contumely she has\r\nendeavored to cast upon us? It is not in the opinion of England alone\r\nthat honor lives, and reputation has its being. The world at large is\r\nthe arbiter of a nation’s fame: with its thousand eyes it witnesses a\r\nnation’s deeds, and from their collective testimony is national glory or\r\nnational disgrace established.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, therefore, it is comparatively of but little importance\r\nwhether England does us justice or not; it is, perhaps, of far more\r\nimportance to herself. She is instilling anger and resentment into the\r\nbosom of a youthful nation, to grow with its growth, and strengthen\r\nwith its strength. If in America, as some of her writers are laboring\r\nto convince her, she is hereafter to find an invidious rival, and a\r\ngigantic foe, she may thank those very writers for having provoked\r\nrivalship, and irritated hostility. Every one knows the all-pervading\r\ninfluence of literature at the present day, and how much the opinions\r\nand passions of mankind are under its control. The mere contests of the\r\nsword are temporary; their wounds are but in the flesh, and it is the\r\npride of the generous to forgive and forget them; but the slanders of\r\nthe pen pierce to the heart; they rankle longest in the noblest spirits;\r\nthey dwell ever present in the mind, and render it morbidly sensitive\r\nto the most trifling collision. It is but seldom that any one overt act\r\nproduces hostilities between two nations; there exists, most commonly, a\r\nprevious jealousy and ill-will, a predisposition to take offence. Trace\r\nthese to their cause, and how often will they be found to originate in\r\nthe mischievous effusions of mercenary writers, who, secure in their\r\nclosets, and for ignominious bread, concoct and circulate the venom that\r\nis to inflame the generous and the brave.\r\n\r\nI am not laying too much stress upon this point; for it applies most\r\nemphatically to our particular case. Over no nation does the press\r\nhold a more absolute control than over the people of America; for the\r\nuniversal education of the poorest classes makes every individual a\r\nreader. There is nothing published in England on the subject of our\r\ncountry, that does not circulate through every part of it. There is not\r\na calumny dropt from an English pen, nor an unworthy sarcasm uttered by\r\nan English statesman, that does not go to blight good-will, and add to\r\nthe mass of latent resentment. Possessing, then, as England does,\r\nthe fountain-head whence the literature of the language flows, how\r\ncompletely is it in her power, and how truly is it her duty, to make it\r\nthe medium of amiable and magnanimous feeling--a stream where the two\r\nnations might meet together and drink in peace and kindness. Should she,\r\nhowever, persist in turning it to waters of bitterness, the time may\r\ncome when she may repent her folly. The present friendship of America\r\nmay be of but little moment to her; but the future destinies of that\r\ncountry do not admit of a doubt; over those of England, there lower\r\nsome shadows of uncertainty. Should, then, a day of gloom arrive--should\r\nthose reverses overtake her, from which the proudest empires have\r\nnot been exempt--she may look back with regret at her infatuation, in\r\nrepulsing from her side a nation she might have grappled to her bosom,\r\nand thus destroying her only chance for real friendship beyond the\r\nboundaries of her own dominions.\r\n\r\nThere is a general impression in England, that the people of the United\r\nStates are inimical to the parent country. It is one of the errors\r\nwhich have been diligently propagated by designing writers. There is,\r\ndoubtless, considerable political hostility, and a general soreness at\r\nthe illiberality of the English press; but, collectively speaking, the\r\nprepossessions of the people are strongly in favor of England. Indeed,\r\nat one time they amounted, in many parts of the Union, to an absurd\r\ndegree of bigotry. The bare name of Englishman was a passport to\r\nthe confidence and hospitality of every family, and too often gave a\r\ntransient currency to the worthless and the ungrateful. Throughout the\r\ncountry, there was something of enthusiasm connected with the idea\r\nof England. We looked to it with a hallowed feeling of tenderness and\r\nveneration, as the land of our forefathers--the august repository of the\r\nmonuments and antiquities of our race--the birthplace and mausoleum of\r\nthe sages and heroes of our paternal history. After our own country,\r\nthere was none in whose glory we more delighted--none whose good opinion\r\nwe were more anxious to possess--none toward which our hearts yearned\r\nwith such throbbings of warm consanguinity. Even during the late war,\r\nwhenever there was the least opportunity for kind feelings to spring\r\nforth, it was the delight of the generous spirits of our country to show\r\nthat, in the midst of hostilities, they still kept alive the sparks of\r\nfuture friendship.\r\n\r\nIs all this to be at an end? Is this golden band of kindred sympathies,\r\nso rare between nations, to be broken forever?--Perhaps it is for the\r\nbest--it may dispel an allusion which might have kept us in mental\r\nvassalage; which might have interfered occasionally with our true\r\ninterests, and prevented the growth of proper national pride. But it\r\nis hard to give up the kindred tie! and there are feelings dearer than\r\ninterest--closer to the heart than pride--that will still make us cast\r\nback a look of regret as we wander farther and farther from the paternal\r\nroof, and lament the waywardness of the parent that would repel the\r\naffections of the child.\r\n\r\nShort-sighted and injudicious, however, as the conduct or England may be\r\nin this system of aspersion, recrimination on our part would be equally\r\nill-judged. I speak not of a prompt and spirited vindication of our\r\ncountry, or the keenest castigation of her slanderers--but I allude to\r\na disposition to retaliate in kind, to retort sarcasm and inspire\r\nprejudice, which seems to be spreading widely among our writers. Let us\r\nguard particularly against such a temper; for it would double the evil,\r\ninstead of redressing the wrong. Nothing is so easy and inviting as\r\nthe retort of abuse and sarcasm; but it is a paltry and an unprofitable\r\ncontest. It is the alternative of a morbid mind, fretted into petulance,\r\nrather than warmed into indignation. If England is willing to permit the\r\nmean jealousies of trade, or the rancorous animosities of politics, to\r\ndeprave the integrity of her press, and poison the fountain of public\r\nopinion, let us beware of her example. She may deem it her interest\r\nto diffuse error, and engender antipathy, for the purpose of checking\r\nemigration: we have no purpose of the kind to serve. Neither have we\r\nany spirit of national jealousy to gratify; for as yet, in all our\r\nrivalships with England, we are the rising and the gaining party.\r\nThere can be no end to answer, therefore, but the gratification of\r\nresentment--a mere spirit of retaliation--and even that is impotent. Our\r\nretorts are never republished in England; they fall short, therefore,\r\nof their aim; but they foster a querulous and peevish temper among\r\nour writers; they sour the sweet flow of our early literature, and\r\nsow thorns and brambles among its blossoms. What is still worse, they\r\ncirculate through our own country, and, as far as they have effect,\r\nexcite virulent national prejudices. This last is the evil most\r\nespecially to be deprecated. Governed, as we are, entirely by public\r\nopinion, the utmost care should be taken to preserve the purity of\r\nthe public mind. Knowledge is power, and truth is knowledge; whoever,\r\ntherefore, knowingly propagates a prejudice, wilfully saps the\r\nfoundation of his country’s strength.\r\n\r\nThe members of a republic, above all other men, should be candid and\r\ndispassionate. They are, individually, portions of the sovereign mind\r\nand sovereign will, and should be enabled to come to all questions of\r\nnational concern with calm and unbiassed judgments. From the peculiar\r\nnature of our relations with England, we must have more frequent\r\nquestions of a difficult and delicate character with her, than with\r\nany other nation,--questions that affect the most acute and excitable\r\nfeelings: and as, in the adjustment of these, our national measures\r\nmust ultimately be determined by popular sentiment, we cannot be\r\ntoo anxiously attentive to purify it from all latent passion or\r\nprepossession.\r\n\r\nOpening, too, as we do, an asylum for strangers every portion of the\r\nearth, we should receive all with impartiality. It should be our pride\r\nto exhibit an example of one nation, at least, destitute of national\r\nantipathies, and exercising, not merely the overt acts of hospitality,\r\nbut those more rare and noble courtesies which spring from liberality of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nWhat have we to do with national prejudices? They are the inveterate\r\ndiseases of old countries, contracted in rude and ignorant ages, when\r\nnations knew but little of each other, and looked beyond their own\r\nboundaries with distrust and hostility. We, on the contrary, have sprung\r\ninto national existence in an enlightened and philosophic age, when the\r\ndifferent parts of the habitable world, and the various branches of the\r\nhuman family, have been indefatigably studied and made known to each\r\nother; and we forego the advantages of our birth, if we do not shake off\r\nthe national prejudices, as we would the local superstitions, of the old\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings, so far\r\nas to shut our eyes to the perception of what is really excellent and\r\namiable in the English character. We are a young people, necessarily an\r\nimitative one, and must take our examples and models, in a great degree,\r\nfrom the existing nations of Europe. There is no country more worthy of\r\nour study than England. The spirit of her constitution is most analogous\r\nto ours. The manners of her people--their intellectual activity--their\r\nfreedom of opinion--their habits of thinking on those subjects which\r\nconcern the dearest interests and most sacred charities of private\r\nlife, are all congenial to the American character; and, in fact, are all\r\nintrinsically excellent: for it is in the moral feeling of the people\r\nthat the deep foundations of British prosperity are laid; and however\r\nthe superstructure may be timeworn, or overrun by abuses, there must be\r\nsomething solid in the basis, admirable in the materials, and stable in\r\nthe structure of an edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the\r\ntempests of the world.\r\n\r\nLet it be the pride of our writers, therefore, discarding all feelings\r\nof irritation, and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of British\r\nauthors, to speak of the English nation without prejudice, and with\r\ndetermined candor. While they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with\r\nwhich some of our countrymen admire and imitate every thing English,\r\nmerely because it is English, let them frankly point out what is\r\nreally worthy of approbation. We may thus place England before us as\r\na perpetual volume of reference, wherein are recorded sound deductions\r\nfrom ages of experience; and while we avoid the errors and absurdities\r\nwhich may have crept into the page, we may draw thence golden maxims of\r\npractical wisdom, wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL LIFE IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n    Oh! friendly to the best pursuits of man,\r\n    Friendly to thought, to virtue and to peace,\r\n    Domestic life in rural pleasures past!\r\n                                          COWPER.\r\n\r\nTHE stranger who would form a correct opinion of the English character,\r\nmust not confine his observations to the metropolis. He must go forth\r\ninto the country; he must sojourn in villages and hamlets; he must visit\r\ncastles, villas, farm-houses, cottages; he must wander through parks\r\nand gardens; along hedges and green lanes; he must loiter about country\r\nchurches; attend wakes and fairs, and other rural festivals; and cope\r\nwith the people in all their conditions, and all their habits and\r\nhumors.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, the large cities absorb the wealth and fashion of\r\nthe nation; they are the only fixed abodes of elegant and intelligent\r\nsociety, and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish\r\npeasantry. In England, on the contrary, the metropolis is a mere\r\ngathering-place, or general rendezvous, of the polite classes, where\r\nthey devote a small portion of the year to a hurry of gayety and\r\ndissipation, and, having indulged this kind of carnival, return again to\r\nthe apparently more congenial habits of rural life. The various orders\r\nof society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom,\r\nand the more retired neighborhoods afford specimens of the different\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nThe English, in fact, are strongly gifted with the rural feeling. They\r\npossess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature, and a keen relish\r\nfor the pleasures and employments of the country. This passion seems\r\ninherent in them. Even the inhabitants of cities, born and brought up\r\namong brick walls and bustling streets, enter with facility into rural\r\nhabits, and evince a tact for rural occupation. The merchant has his\r\nsnug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis, where he often displays\r\nas much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower-garden, and the\r\nmaturing of his fruits, as he does in the conduct of his business,\r\nand the success of a commercial enterprise. Even those less fortunate\r\nindividuals, who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and\r\ntraffic, contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green\r\naspect of nature. In the most dark and dingy quarters of the city, the\r\ndrawing-room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers; every spot\r\ncapable of vegetation has its grass-plot and flower-bed; and every\r\nsquare its mimic park, laid out with picturesque taste, and gleaming\r\nwith refreshing verdure.\r\n\r\nThose who see the Englishman only in town, are apt to form an\r\nunfavorable opinion of his social character. He is either absorbed in\r\nbusiness, or distracted by the thousand engagements that dissipate time,\r\nthought, and feeling, in this huge metropolis. He has, therefore, too\r\ncommonly, a look of hurry and abstraction. Wherever he happens to be, he\r\nis on the point of going somewhere else; at the moment he is talking\r\non one subject, his mind is wandering to another; and while paying a\r\nfriendly visit, he is calculating how he shall economize time so as to\r\npay the other visits allotted to the morning. An immense metropolis,\r\nlike London, is calculated to make men selfish and uninteresting.\r\nIn their casual and transient meetings, they can but deal briefly in\r\ncommonplaces. They present but the cold superfices of character--its\r\nrich and genial qualities have no time to be warmed into a flow.\r\n\r\nIt is in the country that the Englishman gives scope to his natural\r\nfeelings. He breaks loose gladly from the cold formalities and negative\r\ncivilities of town; throws off his habits of shy reserve, and becomes\r\njoyous and free-hearted. He manages to collect round him all the\r\nconveniences and elegancies of polite life, and to banish its\r\nrestraints. His country-seat abounds with every requisite, either for\r\nstudious retirement, tasteful gratification, or rural exercise. Books,\r\npaintings, music, horses, dogs, and sporting implements of all kinds,\r\nare at hand. He puts no constraint, either upon his guests or himself,\r\nbut, in the true spirit of hospitality, provides the means of enjoyment,\r\nand leaves every one to partake according to his inclination.\r\n\r\nThe taste of the English in the cultivation of land, and in what is\r\ncalled landscape gardening, is unrivalled. They have studied Nature\r\nintently, and discovered an exquisite sense of her beautiful forms and\r\nharmonious combinations. Those charms which, in other countries, she\r\nlavishes in wild solitudes, are here assembled round the haunts of\r\ndomestic life. They seem to have caught her coy and furtive graces, and\r\nspread them, like witchery, about their rural abodes.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more imposing than the magnificence of English park\r\nscenery. Vast lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green, with here\r\nand there clumps of gigantic trees, heaping up rich piles of foliage.\r\nThe solemn pomp of groves and woodland glades, with the deer trooping in\r\nsilent herds across them; the hare, bounding away to the covert; or the\r\npheasant, suddenly bursting upon the wing. The brook, taught to wind in\r\nnatural meanderings, or expand into a glassy lake--the sequestered pool,\r\nreflecting the quivering trees, with the yellow leaf sleeping on its\r\nbosom, and the trout roaming fearlessly about its limpid waters; while\r\nsome rustic temple, or sylvan statue, grown green and dank with age,\r\ngives an air of classic sanctity to the seclusion.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the features of park scenery; but what most\r\ndelights me, is the creative talent with which the English decorate the\r\nunostentatious abodes of middle life. The rudest habitation, the most\r\nunpromising and scanty portion of land, in the hands of an Englishman of\r\ntaste, becomes a little paradise. With a nicely discriminating eye,\r\nhe seizes at once upon its capabilities, and pictures in his mind the\r\nfuture landscape. The sterile spot grows into loveliness under his hand;\r\nand yet the operations of art which produce the effect are scarcely to\r\nbe perceived. The cherishing and training of some trees; the cautious\r\npruning of others; the nice distribution of flowers and plants of tender\r\nand graceful foliage; the introduction of a green slope of velvet turf;\r\nthe partial opening to a peep of blue distance, or silver gleam of\r\nwater;-all these are managed with a delicate tact, a pervading yet quiet\r\nassiduity, like the magic touchings with which a painter finishes up a\r\nfavorite picture.\r\n\r\nThe residence of people of fortune and refinement in the country, has\r\ndiffused a degree of taste and elegance in rural economy that descends\r\nto the lowest class. The very laborer, with his thatched cottage and\r\nnarrow slip of ground, attends to their embellishment. The trim hedge,\r\nthe grass-plot before the door, the little flower-bed bordered with snug\r\nbox, the woodbine trained up against the wall, and hanging its blossoms\r\nabout the lattice; the pot of flowers in the window; the holly,\r\nprovidently planted about the house, to cheat winter of its dreariness,\r\nand to throw in a semblance of green summer to cheer the fireside; all\r\nthese bespeak the influence of taste, flowing down from high sources,\r\nand pervading the lowest levels of the public mind. If ever Love, as\r\npoets sing, delights to visit a cottage, it must be the cottage of an\r\nEnglish peasant.\r\n\r\nThe fondness for rural life among the higher classes of the English has\r\nhad a great and salutary effect upon the national character. I do not\r\nknow a finer race of men than the English gentlemen. Instead of the\r\nsoftness and effeminacy which characterize the men of rank in most\r\ncountries, they exhibit a union of elegance and strength, a robustness\r\nof frame and freshness of complexion, which I am inclined to attribute\r\nto their living so much in the open air, and pursuing so eagerly the\r\ninvigorating recreations of the country. The hardy exercises produce\r\nalso a healthful tone of mind and spirits, and a manliness and\r\nsimplicity of manners, which even the follies and dissipations of the\r\ntown cannot easily pervert, and can never entirely destroy. In the\r\ncountry, too, the different orders of society seem to approach more\r\nfreely, to be more disposed to blend and operate favorably upon each\r\nother. The distinctions between them do not appear to be so marked\r\nand impassable as in the cities. The manner in which property has been\r\ndistributed into small estates and farms has established a regular\r\ngradation from the noblemen, through the classes of gentry, small landed\r\nproprietors, and substantial farmers, down to the laboring peasantry;\r\nand while it has thus banded the extremes of society together, has\r\ninfused into each intermediate rank a spirit of independence. This, it\r\nmust be confessed, is not so universally the case at present as it was\r\nformerly; the larger estates having, in late years of distress, absorbed\r\nthe smaller, and, in some parts of the country, almost annihilated the\r\nsturdy race of small farmers. These, however, I believe, are but casual\r\nbreaks in the general system I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn rural occupation, there is nothing mean and debasing. It leads a man\r\nforth among scenes of natural grandeur and beauty; it leaves him to the\r\nworkings of his own mind, operated upon by the purest and most elevating\r\nof external influences. Such a man may be simple and rough, but he\r\ncannot be vulgar. The man of refinement, therefore, finds nothing\r\nrevolting in an intercourse with the lower orders in rural life, as he\r\ndoes when he casually mingles with the lower orders of cities. He lays\r\naside his distance and reserve, and is glad to waive the distinctions of\r\nrank, and to enter into the honest, heartfelt enjoyments of common life.\r\nIndeed, the very amusements of the country bring, men more and more\r\ntogether; and the sound hound and horn blend all feelings into harmony.\r\nI believe this is one great reason why the nobility and gentry are more\r\npopular among the inferior orders in England than they are in any other\r\ncountry; and why the latter have endured so many excessive pressures and\r\nextremities, without repining more generally at the unequal distribution\r\nof fortune and privilege.\r\n\r\nTo this mingling of cultivated and rustic society may also be attributed\r\nthe rural feeling that runs through British literature; the frequent\r\nuse of illustrations from rural life; those incomparable descriptions of\r\nNature, that abound in the British poets--that have continued down from\r\n“The Flower and the Leaf,” of Chaucer, and have brought into our closets\r\nall the freshness and fragrance of the dewy landscape. The pastoral\r\nwriters of other countries appear as if they had paid Nature an\r\noccasional visit, and become acquainted with her general charms; but the\r\nBritish poets have lived and revelled with her--they have wooed her in\r\nher most secret haunts--they have watched her minutest caprices. A\r\nspray could not tremble in the breeze--a leaf could not rustle to the\r\nground--a diamond drop could not patter in the stream--a fragrance could\r\nnot exhale from the humble violet, nor a daisy unfold its crimson\r\ntints to the morning, but it has been noticed by these impassioned and\r\ndelicate observers, and wrought up into some beautiful morality.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this devotion of elegant minds to rural occupations has\r\nbeen wonderful on the face of the country. A great part of the island\r\nis rather level, and would be monotonous, were it not for the charms\r\nof culture; but it is studded and gemmed, as it were, with castles and\r\npalaces, and embroidered with parks and gardens. It does not abound in\r\ngrand and sublime prospects, but rather in little home scenes of rural\r\nrepose and sheltered quiet. Every antique farm-house and moss-grown\r\ncottage is a picture; and as the roads are continually winding, and\r\nthe view is shut in by groves and hedges, the eye is delighted by a\r\ncontinual succession of small landscapes of captivating loveliness.\r\n\r\nThe great charm, however, of English scenery, is the moral feeling that\r\nseems to pervade it. It is associated in the mind with ideas of order,\r\nof quiet, of sober well-established principles, of hoary usage and\r\nreverend custom. Every thing seems to be the growth of ages of regular\r\nand peaceful existence. The old church of remote architecture, with its\r\nlow, massive portal; its Gothic tower; its windows rich with tracery\r\nand painted glass, in scrupulous preservation; its stately monuments of\r\nwarriors and worthies of the olden time, ancestors of the present lords\r\nof the soil; its tombstones, recording successive generations of sturdy\r\nyeomanry, whose progeny still plough the same fields, and kneel at the\r\nsame altar;--the parsonage, a quaint irregular pile, partly\r\nantiquated, but repaired and altered in the tastes of various ages and\r\noccupants;--the stile and foot-path leading from the churchyard, across\r\npleasant fields, and along shady hedgerows, according to an immemorial\r\nright of way;--the neighboring village, with its venerable cottages,\r\nits public green sheltered by trees, under which the forefathers of the\r\npresent race have sported;--the antique family mansion, standing apart\r\nin some little rural domain, but looking down with a protecting air on\r\nthe surrounding scene; all these common features of English landscape\r\nevince a calm and settled security, a hereditary transmission of\r\nhomebred virtues and local attachments, that speak deeply and touchingly\r\nfor the moral character of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasing sight, of a Sunday morning, when the bell is sending\r\nits sober melody across the quiet fields, to behold the peasantry in\r\ntheir best finery, with ruddy faces, and modest cheerfulness, thronging\r\ntranquilly along the green lanes to church; but it is still more\r\npleasing to see them in the evenings, gathering about their cottage\r\ndoors, and appearing to exult in the humble comforts and embellishments\r\nwhich their own hands have spread around them.\r\n\r\nIt is this sweet home-feeling, this settled repose of affection in the\r\ndomestic scene, that is, after all, the parent of the steadiest virtues\r\nand purest enjoyments; and I cannot close these desultory remarks\r\nbetter, than by quoting the words of a modern English poet, who has\r\ndepicted it with remarkable felicity:\r\n\r\n    Through each gradation, from the castled hall,\r\n    The city dome, the villa crowned with shade,\r\n    But chief from modest mansions numberless,\r\n    In town or hamlet, shelt’ring middle life,\r\n    Down to the cottaged vale, and straw-roof’d shed;\r\n    This western isle has long been famed for scenes\r\n    Where bliss domestic finds a dwelling-place;\r\n    Domestic bliss, that, like a harmless dove,\r\n    (Honor and sweet endearment keeping guard,)\r\n    Can centre in a little quiet nest\r\n    All that desire would fly for through the earth;\r\n    That can, the world eluding, be itself\r\n    A world enjoyed; that wants no witnesses\r\n    But its own sharers, and approving Heaven;\r\n    That, like a flower deep hid in rock cleft,\r\n    Smiles, though ‘t is looking only at the sky.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * From a poem on the death of the Princess Charlotte, by the\r\n     Reverend Rann Kennedy, A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN HEART.\r\n\r\n                                  I never heard\r\n    Of any true affection, but ‘t was nipt\r\n    With care, that, like the caterpillar, eats\r\n    The leaves of the spring’s sweetest book, the rose.\r\n                                            MIDDLETON.\r\n\r\nIT is a common practice with those who have outlived the susceptibility\r\nof early feeling, or have been brought up in the gay heartlessness of\r\ndissipated life, to laugh at all love stories, and to treat the tales\r\nof romantic passion as mere fictions of novelists and poets. My\r\nobservations on human nature have induced me to think otherwise. They\r\nhave convinced me that, however the surface of the character may be\r\nchilled and frozen by the cares of the world, or cultivated into mere\r\nsmiles by the arts of society, still there are dormant fires lurking\r\nin the depths of the coldest bosom, which, when once enkindled, become\r\nimpetuous, and are sometimes desolating in their effects. Indeed, I am\r\na true believer in the blind deity, and go to the full extent of his\r\ndoctrines. Shall I confess it?--I believe in broken hearts, and the\r\npossibility of dying of disappointed love! I do not, however, consider\r\nit a malady often fatal to my own sex; but I firmly believe that it\r\nwithers down many a lovely woman into an early grave.\r\n\r\nMan is the creature of interest and ambition. His nature leads him forth\r\ninto the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but the embellishment\r\nof his early life, or a song piped in the intervals of the acts. He\r\nseeks for fame, for fortune for space in the world’s thought, and\r\ndominion over his fellow-men. But a woman’s whole life is a history of\r\nthe affections. The heart is her world; it is there her ambition strives\r\nfor empire--it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures. She\r\nsends forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole soul in\r\nthe traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked, her case is hopeless--for\r\nit is a bankruptcy of the heart.\r\n\r\nTo a man, the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs;\r\nit wounds some feelings of tenderness--it blasts some prospects of\r\nfelicity; but he is an active being--he may dissipate his thoughts in\r\nthe whirl of varied occupation, or may plunge into the tide of pleasure;\r\nor, if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations,\r\nhe can shift his abode at will, and taking, as it were, the wings of the\r\nmorning, can “fly to the uttermost parts of the earth, and be at rest.”\r\n\r\nBut woman’s is comparatively a fixed, a secluded, and meditative life.\r\nShe is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings; and if they\r\nare turned to ministers of sorrow, where shall she look for consolation?\r\nHer lot is to be wooed and won; and if unhappy in her love, her heart\r\nis like some fortress that has been captured, and sacked, and abandoned,\r\nand left desolate.\r\n\r\nHow many bright eyes grow dim--how many soft cheeks grow pale--how many\r\nlovely forms fade away into the tomb, and none can tell the cause that\r\nblighted their loveliness! As the dove will clasp its wings to its side,\r\nand cover and conceal the arrow that is preying on its vitals--so is\r\nit the nature of woman, to hide from the world the pangs of wounded\r\naffection. The love of a delicate female is always shy and silent. Even\r\nwhen fortunate, she scarcely breathes it to herself; but when otherwise,\r\nshe buries it in the recesses of her bosom, and there lets it cower and\r\nbrood among the ruins of her peace. With her, the desire of her heart\r\nhas failed--the great charm of existence is at an end. She neglects all\r\nthe cheerful exercises which gladden the spirits, quicken the pulses,\r\nand send the tide of life in healthful currents through the veins. Her\r\nrest is broken--the sweet refreshment of sleep is poisoned by melancholy\r\ndreams--“dry sorrow drinks her blood,” until her enfeebled frame sinks\r\nunder the slightest external injury. Look for her, after a little while,\r\nand you find friendship weeping over her untimely grave, and wondering\r\nthat one, who but lately glowed with all the radiance of health and\r\nbeauty, should so speedily be brought down to “darkness and the worm.”\r\n You will be told of some wintry chill, some casual indisposition, that\r\nlaid her low;--but no one knows of the mental malady which previously\r\nsapped her strength, and made her so easy a prey to the spoiler.\r\n\r\nShe is like some tender tree, the pride and beauty of the grove;\r\ngraceful in its form, bright in its foliage, but with the worm preying\r\nat its heart. We find it suddenly withering, when it should be most\r\nfresh and luxuriant. We see it drooping its branches to the earth, and\r\nshedding leaf by leaf, until, wasted and perished away, it falls even in\r\nthe stillness of the forest; and as we muse over the beautiful ruin,\r\nwe strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt that could have\r\nsmitten it with decay.\r\n\r\nI have seen many instances of women running to waste and self-neglect,\r\nand disappearing gradually from the earth, almost as if they had been\r\nexhaled to heaven; and have repeatedly fancied that I could trace their\r\ndeaths through the various declensions of consumption, cold, debility,\r\nlanguor, melancholy, until I reached the first symptom of disappointed\r\nlove. But an instance of the kind was lately told to me; the\r\ncircumstances are well known in the country where they happened, and I\r\nshall but give them in the manner in which they were related.\r\n\r\nEvery one must recollect the tragical story of young E----, the Irish\r\npatriot; it was too touching to be soon forgotten. During the troubles\r\nin Ireland, he was tried, condemned, and executed, on a charge of\r\ntreason. His fate made a deep impression on public sympathy. He was so\r\nyoung--so intelligent--so generous--so brave--so every thing that we are\r\napt to like in a young man. His conduct under trial, too, was so lofty\r\nand intrepid. The noble indignation with which he repelled the charge of\r\ntreason against his country--the eloquent vindication of his\r\nname--and his pathetic appeal to posterity, in the hopeless hour of\r\ncondemnation,--all these entered deeply into every generous bosom, and\r\neven his enemies lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution.\r\n\r\nBut there was one heart whose anguish it would be impossible to\r\ndescribe. In happier days and fairer fortunes, he had won the affections\r\nof a beautiful and interesting girl, the daughter of a late celebrated\r\nIrish barrister. She loved him with the disinterested fervor of a\r\nwoman’s first and early love. When every worldly maxim arrayed itself\r\nagainst him; when blasted in fortune, and disgrace and danger\r\ndarkened around his name, she loved him the more ardently for his very\r\nsufferings. If, then, his fate could awaken the sympathy even of\r\nhis foes, what must have been the agony of her, whose whole soul was\r\noccupied by his image? Let those tell who have had the portals of the\r\ntomb suddenly closed between them and the being they most loved on\r\nearth--who have sat at its threshold, as one shut out in a cold and\r\nlonely world, whence all that was most lovely and loving had departed.\r\n\r\nBut then the horrors of such a grave!--so frightful, so dishonored!\r\nThere was nothing for memory to dwell on that could soothe the pang of\r\nseparation--none of those tender, though melancholy circumstances which\r\nendear the parting scene--nothing to melt sorrow into those blessed\r\ntears, sent like the dews of heaven, to revive the heart in the parting\r\nhour of anguish.\r\n\r\nTo render her widowed situation more desolate, she had incurred her\r\nfather’s displeasure by her unfortunate attachment, and was an exile\r\nfrom the parental roof. But could the sympathy and kind offices of\r\nfriends have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horror, she\r\nwould have experienced no want of consolation, for the Irish are a\r\npeople of quick and generous sensibilities. The most delicate\r\nand cherishing attentions were paid her by families of wealth and\r\ndistinction. She was led into society, and they tried by all kinds of\r\noccupation and amusement to dissipate her grief, and wean her from the\r\ntragical story of her loves. But it was all in vain. There are some\r\nstrokes of calamity that scathe and scorch the soul--which penetrate to\r\nthe vital seat of happiness--and blast it, never again to put forth bud\r\nor blossom. She never objected to frequent the haunts of pleasure, but\r\nwas as much alone there as in the depths of solitude; walking about in a\r\nsad revery, apparently unconscious of the world around her. She\r\ncarried with her an inward woe that mocked at all the blandishments of\r\nfriendship, and “heeded not the song of the charmer, charm he never so\r\nwisely.”\r\n\r\nThe person who told me her story had seen her at a masquerade. There can\r\nbe no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and painful than\r\nto meet it in such a scene. To find it wandering like a spectre, lonely\r\nand joyless, where all around is gay--to see it dressed out in the\r\ntrappings of mirth, and looking so wan and woe-begone, as if it had\r\ntried in vain to cheat the poor heart into momentary forgetfulness of\r\nsorrow. After strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd with\r\nan air of utter abstraction, she sat herself down on the steps of an\r\norchestra, and, looking about for some time with a vacant air, that\r\nshowed her insensibility to the garish scene, she began, with the\r\ncapriciousness of a sickly heart, to warble a little plaintive air.\r\nShe had an exquisite, voice; but on this occasion it was so simple, so\r\ntouching, it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness--that she drew a\r\ncrowd, mute and silent, around her and melted every one into tears.\r\n\r\nThe story of one so true and tender could not but excite great interest\r\nin a country remarkable for enthusiasm. It completely won the heart of\r\na brave officer, who paid his addresses to her, and thought that one so\r\ntrue to the dead, could not but prove affectionate to the living. She\r\ndeclined his attentions, for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed by\r\nthe memory of her former lover. He, however, persisted in his suit. He\r\nsolicited not her tenderness, but her esteem. He was assisted by\r\nher conviction of his worth, and her sense of her own destitute and\r\ndependent situation, for she was existing on the kindness of friends.\r\nIn a word, he at length succeeded in gaining her hand, though with the\r\nsolemn assurance, that her heart was unalterably another’s.\r\n\r\nHe took her with him to Sicily, hoping that a change of scene might\r\nwear out the remembrance of early woes. She was an amiable and exemplary\r\nwife, and made an effort to be a happy one; but nothing could cure the\r\nsilent and devouring melancholy that had entered into her very soul. She\r\nwasted away in a slow, but hopeless decline, and at length sunk into the\r\ngrave, the victim of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nIt was on her that Moore, the distinguished Irish poet, composed the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n    She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,\r\n        And lovers around her are sighing:\r\n    But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps,\r\n        For her heart in his grave is lying.\r\n\r\n    She sings the wild song of her dear native plains,\r\n        Every note which he loved awaking--\r\n    Ah! little they think, who delight in her strains,\r\n        How the heart of the minstrel is breaking!\r\n\r\n    He had lived for his love--for his country he died,\r\n        They were all that to life had entwined him--\r\n    Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried,\r\n        Nor long will his love stay behind him!\r\n\r\n    Oh! make her a grave where the sunbeams rest,\r\n        When they promise a glorious morrow;\r\n    They’ll shine o’er her sleep, like a smile from the west,\r\n        From her own loved island of sorrow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF BOOK-MAKING.\r\n\r\nIf that severe doom of Synesius be true,--“It is a greater offence to\r\nsteal dead men’s labor, than their clothes,”--what shall become of most\r\nwriters?                        BURTON’S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY.\r\n\r\nI HAVE often wondered at the extreme fecundity of the press, and how\r\nit comes to pass that so many heads, on which Nature seems to have\r\ninflicted the curse of barrenness, should teem with voluminous\r\nproductions. As a man travels on, however, in the journey of life, his\r\nobjects of wonder daily diminish, and he is continually finding out some\r\nvery simple cause for some great matter of marvel. Thus have I chanced,\r\nin my peregrinations about this great metropolis, to blunder upon a\r\nscene which unfolded to me some of the mysteries of the book-making\r\ncraft, and at once put an end to my astonishment.\r\n\r\nI was one summer’s day loitering through the great saloons of the\r\nBritish Museum, with that listlessness with which one is apt to saunter\r\nabout a museum in warm weather; sometimes lolling over the glass cases\r\nof minerals, sometimes studying the hieroglyphics on an Egyptian mummy,\r\nand some times trying, with nearly equal success, to comprehend the\r\nallegorical paintings on the lofty ceilings. Whilst I was gazing about\r\nin this idle way, my attention was attracted to a distant door, at the\r\nend of a suite of apartments. It was closed, but every now and then it\r\nwould open, and some strange-favored being, generally clothed in black,\r\nwould steal forth, and glide through the rooms, without noticing any\r\nof the surrounding objects. There was an air of mystery about this that\r\npiqued my languid curiosity, and I determined to attempt the passage of\r\nthat strait, and to explore the unknown regions beyond. The door yielded\r\nto my hand, with all that facility with which the portals of enchanted\r\ncastles yield to the adventurous knight-errant. I found myself in a\r\nspacious chamber, surrounded with great cases of venerable books. Above\r\nthe cases, and just under the cornice, were arranged a great number of\r\nblack-looking portraits of ancient authors. About the room were placed\r\nlong tables, with stands for reading and writing, at which sat many\r\npale, studious personages, poring intently over dusty volumes, rummaging\r\namong mouldy manuscripts, and taking copious notes of their contents.\r\nA hushed stillness reigned through this mysterious apartment, excepting\r\nthat you might hear the racing of pens over sheets of paper, and\r\noccasionally the deep sigh of one of these sages, as he shifted his\r\nposition to turn over the page of an old folio; doubtless arising from\r\nthat hollowness and flatulency incident to learned research.\r\n\r\nNow and then one of these personages would write something on a small\r\nslip of paper, and ring a bell, whereupon a familiar would appear, take\r\nthe paper in profound silence, glide out of the room, and return shortly\r\nloaded with ponderous tomes, upon which the other would fall, tooth\r\nand nail, with famished voracity. I had no longer a doubt that I had\r\nhappened upon a body of magi, deeply engaged in the study of occult\r\nsciences. The scene reminded me of an old Arabian tale, of a philosopher\r\nshut up in an enchanted library, in the bosom of a mountain, which\r\nopened only once a year; where he made the spirits of the place bring\r\nhim books of all kinds of dark knowledge, so that at the end of the\r\nyear, when the magic portal once more swung open on its hinges, he\r\nissued forth so versed in forbidden lore, as to be able to soar above\r\nthe heads of the multitude, and to control the powers of Nature.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity being now fully aroused, I whispered to one of\r\nthe familiars, as he was about to leave the room, and begged an\r\ninterpretation of the strange scene before me. A few words were\r\nsufficient for the purpose. I found that these mysterious personages,\r\nwhom I had mistaken for magi, were principally authors, and were in the\r\nvery act of manufacturing books. I was, in fact, in the reading-room of\r\nthe great British Library, an immense collection of volumes of all ages\r\nand languages, many of which are now forgotten, and most of which are\r\nseldom read: one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature to\r\nwhich modern authors repair, and draw buckets full of classic lore, or\r\n“pure English, undefiled,” wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nBeing now in possession of the secret, I sat down in a corner, and\r\nwatched the process of this book manufactory. I noticed one lean,\r\nbilious-looking wight, who sought none but the most worm-eaten volumes,\r\nprinted in black letter. He was evidently constructing some work of\r\nprofound erudition, that would be purchased by every man who wished to\r\nbe thought learned, placed upon a conspicuous shelf of his library, or\r\nlaid open upon his table--but never read. I observed him, now and then,\r\ndraw a large fragment of biscuit out of his pocket, and gnaw; whether\r\nit was his dinner, or whether he was endeavoring to keep off that\r\nexhaustion of the stomach, produced by much pondering over dry works, I\r\nleave to harder students than myself to determine.\r\n\r\nThere was one dapper little gentleman in bright-colored clothes, with a\r\nchirping gossiping expression of countenance, who had all the appearance\r\nof an author on good terms with his bookseller. After considering him\r\nattentively, I recognized in him a diligent getter-up of miscellaneous\r\nworks, which bustled off well with the trade. I was curious to see how\r\nhe manufactured his wares. He made more stir and show of business than\r\nany of the others; dipping into various books, fluttering over the\r\nleaves of manuscripts, taking a morsel out of one, a morsel out of\r\nanother, “line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there\r\na little.” The contents of his book seemed to be as heterogeneous as\r\nthose of the witches’ cauldron in Macbeth. It was here a finger and\r\nthere a thumb, toe of frog and blind worm’s sting, with his own gossip\r\npoured in like “baboon’s blood,” to make the medley “slab and good.”\r\n\r\nAfter all, thought I, may not this pilfering disposition be implanted in\r\nauthors for wise purposes? may it not be the way in which Providence\r\nhas taken care that the seeds of knowledge and wisdom shall be preserved\r\nfrom age to age, in spite of the inevitable decay of the works in\r\nwhich they were first produced? We see that Nature has wisely, though\r\nwhimsically provided for the conveyance of seeds from clime to clime,\r\nin the maws of certain birds; so that animals, which, in themselves, are\r\nlittle better than carrion, and apparently the lawless plunderers of the\r\norchard and the corn-field, are, in fact, Nature’s carriers to disperse\r\nand perpetuate her blessings. In like manner, the beauties and fine\r\nthoughts of ancient and obsolete authors are caught up by these flights\r\nof predatory writers, and cast forth, again to flourish and bear fruit\r\nin a remote and distant tract of time. Many of their works, also,\r\nundergo a kind of metempsychosis, and spring up under new forms. What\r\nwas formerly a ponderous history, revives in the shape of a romance--an\r\nold legend changes into a modern play--and a sober philosophical\r\ntreatise furnishes the body for a whole series of bouncing and sparkling\r\nessays. Thus it is in the clearing of our American woodlands; where we\r\nburn down a forest of stately pines, a progeny of dwarf oaks start up in\r\ntheir place; and we never see the prostrate trunk of a tree mouldering\r\ninto soil, but it gives birth to a whole tribe of fungi.\r\n\r\nLet us not then, lament over the decay and oblivion into which ancient\r\nwriters descend; they do but submit to the great law of Nature, which\r\ndeclares that all sublunary shapes of matter shall be limited in their\r\nduration, but which decrees, also, that their element shall never\r\nperish. Generation after generation, both in animal and vegetable life,\r\npasses away, but the vital principle is transmitted to posterity, and\r\nthe species continue to flourish. Thus, also, do authors beget authors,\r\nand having produced a numerous progeny, in a good old age they sleep\r\nwith their fathers, that is to say, with the authors who preceded\r\nthem--and from whom they had stolen.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was indulging in these rambling fancies I had leaned my head\r\nagainst a pile of reverend folios. Whether it was owing to the soporific\r\nemanations for these works; or to the profound quiet of the room; or\r\nto the lassitude arising from much wandering; or to an unlucky habit\r\nof napping at improper times and places, with which I am grievously\r\nafflicted, so it was, that I fell into a doze. Still, however, my\r\nimagination continued busy, and indeed the same scene continued before\r\nmy mind’s eye, only a little changed in some of the details. I dreamt\r\nthat the chamber was still decorated with the portraits of ancient\r\nauthors, but that the number was increased. The long tables had\r\ndisappeared, and, in place of the sage magi, I beheld a ragged,\r\nthreadbare throng, such as may be seen plying about the great repository\r\nof cast-off clothes, Monmouth Street. Whenever they seized upon a book,\r\nby one of those incongruities common to dreams, methought it turned into\r\na garment of foreign or antique fashion, with which they proceeded to\r\nequip themselves. I noticed, however, that no one pretended to clothe\r\nhimself from any particular suit, but took a sleeve from one, a cape\r\nfrom another, a skirt from a third, thus decking himself out piecemeal,\r\nwhile some of his original rags would peep out from among his borrowed\r\nfinery.\r\n\r\nThere was a portly, rosy, well-fed parson, whom I observed ogling\r\nseveral mouldy polemical writers through an eyeglass. He soon contrived\r\nto slip on the voluminous mantle of one of the old fathers, and having\r\npurloined the gray beard of another, endeavored to look exceedingly\r\nwise; but the smirking commonplace of his countenance set at naught\r\nall the trappings of wisdom. One sickly-looking gentleman was busied\r\nembroidering a very flimsy garment with gold thread drawn out of several\r\nold court-dresses of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Another had trimmed\r\nhimself magnificently from an illuminated manuscript, had stuck a\r\nnosegay in his bosom, culled from “The Paradise of Dainty Devices,” and\r\nhaving put Sir Philip Sidney’s hat on one side of his head, strutted off\r\nwith an exquisite air of vulgar elegance. A third, who was but of puny\r\ndimensions, had bolstered himself out bravely with the spoils from\r\nseveral obscure tracts of philosophy, so that he had a very imposing\r\nfront, but he was lamentably tattered in rear, and I perceived that\r\nhe had patched his small-clothes with scraps of parchment from a Latin\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThere were some well-dressed gentlemen, it is true, who only helped\r\nthemselves to a gem or so, which sparkled among their own ornaments,\r\nwithout eclipsing them. Some, too, seemed to contemplate the costumes\r\nof the old writers, merely to imbibe their principles of taste, and to\r\ncatch their air and spirit; but I grieve to say, that too many were apt\r\nto array themselves, from top to toe, in the patchwork manner I have\r\nmentioned. I shall not omit to speak of one genius, in drab breeches\r\nand gaiters, and an Arcadian hat, who had a violent propensity to the\r\npastoral, but whose rural wanderings had been confined to the classic\r\nhaunts of Primrose Hill, and the solitudes of the Regent’s Park. He had\r\ndecked himself in wreaths and ribbons from all the old pastoral poets,\r\nand, hanging his head on one side, went about with a fantastical,\r\nlackadaisical air, “babbling about green field.” But the personage that\r\nmost struck my attention was a pragmatical old gentleman in clerical\r\nrobes, with a remarkably large and square but bald head. He entered the\r\nroom wheezing and puffing, elbowed his way through the throng with a\r\nlook of sturdy self-confidence, and, having laid hands upon a thick\r\nGreek quarto, clapped it upon his head, and swept majestically away in a\r\nformidable frizzled wig.\r\n\r\nIn the height of this literary masquerade, a cry suddenly resounded from\r\nevery side, of “Thieves! thieves!” I looked, and lo! the portraits about\r\nthe walls became animated! The old authors thrust out, first a head,\r\nthen a shoulder, from the canvas, looked down curiously for an instant\r\nupon the motley throng, and then descended, with fury in their eyes,\r\nto claim their rifled property. The scene of scampering and hubbub that\r\nensued baffles all description. The unhappy culprits endeavored in vain\r\nto escape with their plunder. On one side might be seen half a dozen\r\nold monks, stripping a modern professor; on another, there was sad\r\ndevastation carried into the ranks of modern dramatic writers. Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher, side by side, raged round the field like Castor and\r\nPollux, and sturdy Ben Jonson enacted more wonders than when a volunteer\r\nwith the army in Flanders. As to the dapper little compiler of farragos\r\nmentioned some time since, he had arrayed himself in as many patches and\r\ncolors as harlequin, and there was as fierce a contention of claimants\r\nabout him, as about the dead body of Patroclus. I was grieved to\r\nsee many men, to whom I had been accustomed to look up with awe and\r\nreverence, fain to steal off with scarce a rag to cover their nakedness.\r\nJust then my eye was caught by the pragmatical old gentleman in the\r\nGreek grizzled wig, who was scrambling away in sore affright with half\r\na score of authors in full cry after him. They were close upon his\r\nhaunches; in a twinkling off went his wig; at every turn some strip of\r\nraiment was peeled away, until in a few moments, from his domineering\r\npomp, he shrunk into a little, pursy, “chopp’d bald shot,” and made his\r\nexit with only a few tags and rags fluttering at his back.\r\n\r\nThere was something so ludicrous in the catastrophe of this learned\r\nTheban that I burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, which broke the\r\nwhole illusion. The tumult and the scuffle were at an end. The chamber\r\nresumed its usual appearance. The old authors shrunk back into their\r\npicture-frames, and hung in shadowy solemnity along the walls. In short,\r\nI found myself wide awake in my corner, with the whole assemblage of\r\nhookworms gazing at me with astonishment. Nothing of the dream had been\r\nreal but my burst of laughter, a sound never before heard in that grave\r\nsanctuary, and so abhorrent to the ears of wisdom, as to electrify the\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nThe librarian now stepped up to me, and demanded whether I had a card of\r\nadmission. At first I did not comprehend him, but I soon found that the\r\nlibrary was a kind of literary “preserve,” subject to game-laws, and\r\nthat no one must presume to hunt there without special license and\r\npermission. In a word, I stood convicted of being an arrant poacher, and\r\nwas glad to make a precipitate retreat, lest I should have a whole pack\r\nof authors let loose upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROYAL POET.\r\n\r\n    Though your body be confined\r\n        And soft love a prisoner bound,\r\n    Yet the beauty of your mind\r\n        Neither check nor chain hath found.\r\n            Look out nobly, then, and dare\r\n            Even the fetters that you wear.\r\n                                               FLETCHER.\r\n\r\nON a soft sunny morning in the genial month of May I made an excursion\r\nto Windsor Castle. It is a place full of storied and poetical\r\nassociations. The very external aspect of the proud old pile is enough\r\nto inspire high thought. It rears its irregular walls and massive\r\ntowers, like a mural crown around the brow of a lofty ridge, waves its\r\nroyal banner in the clouds, and looks down with a lordly air upon the\r\nsurrounding world.\r\n\r\nOn this morning, the weather was of that voluptuous vernal kind which\r\ncalls forth all the latent romance of a man’s temperament, filling his\r\nmind with music, and disposing him to quote poetry and dream of beauty.\r\nIn wandering through the magnificent saloons and long echoing galleries\r\nof the castle I passed with indifference by whole rows of portraits\r\nof warriors and statesmen, but lingered in the chamber where hang the\r\nlikenesses of the beauties which graced the gay court of Charles\r\nthe Second; and as I gazed upon them, depicted with amorous,\r\nhalf-dishevelled tresses, and the sleepy eye of love, I blessed the\r\npencil of Sir Peter Lely, which had thus enabled me to bask in the\r\nreflected rays of beauty. In traversing also the “large green courts,”\r\n with sunshine beaming on the gray walls and glancing along the velvet\r\nturf, my mind was engrossed with the image of the tender, the gallant,\r\nbut hapless Surrey, and his account of his loiterings about them in his\r\nstripling days, when enamoured of the Lady Geraldine--\r\n\r\n    “With eyes cast up unto the maiden’s tower,\r\n      With easie sighs, such as men draw in love.”\r\n\r\nIn this mood of mere poetical susceptibility, I visited the ancient keep\r\nof the castle, where James the First of Scotland, the pride and theme of\r\nScottish poets and historians, was for many years of his youth detained\r\na prisoner of state. It is a large gray tower, that has stood the brunt\r\nof ages, and is still in good preservation. It stands on a mound which\r\nelevates it above the other parts of the castle, and a great flight of\r\nsteps leads to the interior. In the armory, a Gothic hall furnished with\r\nweapons of various kinds and ages, I was shown a coat of armor hanging\r\nagainst the wall, which had once belonged to James. Hence I\r\nwas conducted up a staircase to a suite of apartments, of faded\r\nmagnificence, hung with storied tapestry, which formed his prison, and\r\nthe scene of that passionate and fanciful amour, which has woven into\r\nthe web of his story the magical hues of poetry and fiction.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of this amiable but unfortunate prince is highly\r\nromantic. At the tender age of eleven, he was sent from home by his\r\nfather, Robert III., and destined for the French court, to be reared\r\nunder the eye of the French monarch, secure from the treachery and\r\ndanger that surrounded the royal house of Scotland. It was his mishap,\r\nin the course of his voyage, to fall into the hands of the English,\r\nand he was detained prisoner by Henry IV., notwithstanding that a truce\r\nexisted between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of his capture, coming in the train of many sorrows and\r\ndisasters, proved fatal to his unhappy father. “The news,” we are told,\r\n“was brought to him while at supper, and did so overwhelm him with grief\r\nthat he was almost ready to give up the ghost into the hands of the\r\nservants that attended him. But being carried to his bedchamber, he\r\nabstained from all food, and in three days died of hunger and grief at\r\nRothesay.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Buchanan.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames was detained in captivity above eighteen years; but, though\r\ndeprived of personal liberty, he was treated with the respect due to\r\nhis rank. Care was taken to instruct him in all the branches of useful\r\nknowledge cultivated at that period, and to give him those mental and\r\npersonal accomplishments deemed proper for a prince. Perhaps in this\r\nrespect his imprisonment was an advantage, as it enabled him to apply\r\nhimself the more exclusively to his improvement, and quietly to imbibe\r\nthat rich fund of knowledge and to cherish those elegant tastes which\r\nhave given such a lustre to his memory. The picture drawn of him in\r\nearly life by the Scottish historians is highly captivating, and seems\r\nrather the description of a hero of romance than of a character in real\r\nhistory. He was well learnt, we are told, “to fight with the sword,\r\nto joust, to tourney, to wrestle, to sing and dance; he was an expert\r\nmediciner, right crafty in playing both of lute and harp, and sundry\r\nother instruments of music, and was expert in grammar, oratory, and\r\npoetry.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Ballenden’s translation of Hector Boyce.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this combination of manly and delicate accomplishments, fitting him\r\nto shine both in active and elegant life, and calculated to give him an\r\nintense relish for joyous existence, it must have been a severe trial,\r\nin an age of bustle and chivalry, to pass the spring-time of his years\r\nin monotonous captivity. It was the good fortune of James, however, to\r\nbe gifted with a powerful poetic fancy, and to be visited in his prison\r\nby the choicest inspirations of the muse. Some minds corrode, and grow\r\ninactive, under the loss of personal liberty; others grow morbid\r\nand irritable; but it is the nature of the poet to become tender and\r\nimaginative in the loneliness of confinement. He banquets upon the honey\r\nof his own thoughts, and, like the captive bird, pours forth his soul in\r\nmelody.\r\n\r\n    Have you not seen the nightingale,\r\n        A pilgrim coop’d into a cage,\r\n    How doth she chant her wonted tale,\r\n        In that her lonely hermitage!\r\n    Even there her charming melody doth prove\r\n    That all her boughs are trees, her cage a grove.+\r\n\r\n    + Roger L’Estrange.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is the divine attribute of the imagination, that it is\r\nirrepressible, unconfinable--that when the real world is shut out,\r\nit can create a world for itself, and, with a necromantic power, can\r\nconjure up glorious shapes and forms and brilliant visions, to make\r\nsolitude populous, and irradiate the gloom of the dungeon. Such was the\r\nworld of pomp and pageant that lived round Tasso in his dismal cell at\r\nFerrara, when he conceived the splendid scenes of his Jerusalem; and we\r\nmay consider The King’s Quair,* composed by James during his captivity\r\nat Windsor, as another of those beautiful breakings forth of the soul\r\nfrom the restraint and gloom of the prison-house.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the poem is his love for the lady Jane Beaufort, daughter\r\nof the Earl of Somerset, and a princess of the blood-royal of England,\r\nof whom he became enamoured in the course of his captivity. What gives\r\nit a peculiar value, is, that it may be considered a transcript of\r\nthe royal bard’s true feelings, and the story of his real loves and\r\nfortunes. It is not often that sovereigns write poetry or that poets\r\ndeal in fact. It is gratifying to the pride of a common man, to find\r\na monarch thus suing, as it were, for admission into his closet, and\r\nseeking to win his favor by administering to his pleasures. It is a\r\nproof of the honest equality of intellectual competition, which strips\r\noff all the trappings of factitious dignity, brings the candidate down\r\nto a level with his fellow-men, and obliges him to depend on his own\r\nnative powers for distinction. It is curious, too, to get at the history\r\nof a monarch’s heart, and to find the simple affections of human nature\r\nthrobbing under the ermine. But James had learnt to be a poet before he\r\nwas a king; he was schooled in adversity, and reared in the company of\r\nhis own thoughts. Monarchs have seldom time to parley with their hearts\r\nor to meditate their minds into poetry; and had James been brought up\r\namidst the adulation and gayety of a court, we should never, in all\r\nprobability, have had such a poem as the Quair.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Quair, an old term for book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been particularly interested by those parts of the poem which\r\nbreathe his immediate thoughts concerning his situation, or which are\r\nconnected with the apartment in the Tower. They have thus a personal and\r\nlocal charm, and are given with such circumstantial truth as to make the\r\nreader present with the captive in his prison and the companion of his\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account which he gives of his weariness of spirit, and of\r\nthe incident which first suggested the idea of writing the poem. It was\r\nthe still mid-watch of a clear moonlight night; the stars, he says, were\r\ntwinkling as fire in the high vault of heaven, and “Cynthia rinsing her\r\ngolden locks in Aquarius.” He lay in bed wakeful and restless, and took\r\na book to beguile the tedious hours. The book he chose was Boetius’\r\nConsolations of Philosophy, a work popular among the writers of that\r\nday, and which had been translated by his great prototype, Chaucer. From\r\nthe high eulogium in which he indulges, it is evident this was one of\r\nhis favorite volumes while in prison; and indeed it is an admirable\r\ntext-book for meditation under adversity. It is the legacy of a noble\r\nand enduring spirit, purified by sorrow and suffering, bequeathing to\r\nits successors in calamity the maxims of sweet morality, and the trains\r\nof eloquent but simple reasoning, by which it was enabled to bear\r\nup against the various ills of life. It is a talisman, which the\r\nunfortunate may treasure up in his bosom, or, like the good King James,\r\nlay upon his nightly pillow.\r\n\r\nAfter closing the volume he turns its contents over in his mind, and\r\ngradually falls into a fit of musing on the fickleness of fortune, the\r\nvicissitudes of his own life, and the evils that had overtaken him even\r\nin his tender youth. Suddenly he hears the bell ringing to matins, but\r\nits sound, chiming in with his melancholy fancies, seems to him like a\r\nvoice exhorting him to write his story. In the spirit of poetic errantry\r\nhe determines to comply with this intimation; he therefore takes pen in\r\nhand, makes with it a sign of the cross to implore a benediction,\r\nand sallies forth into the fairy-land of poetry. There is something\r\nextremely fanciful in all this, and it is interesting as furnishing\r\na striking and beautiful instance of the simple manner in which\r\nwhole trains of poetical thought are sometimes awakened and literary\r\nenterprises suggested to the mind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his poem, he more than once bewails the peculiar\r\nhardness of his fate, thus doomed to lonely and inactive life, and\r\nshut up from the freedom and pleasure of the world in which the meanest\r\nanimal indulges unrestrained. There is a sweetness, however, in his very\r\ncomplaints; they are the lamentations of an amiable and social spirit at\r\nbeing denied the indulgence of its kind and generous propensities; there\r\nis nothing in them harsh nor exaggerated; they flow with a natural and\r\ntouching pathos, and are perhaps rendered more touching by their\r\nsimple brevity. They contrast finely with those elaborate and iterated\r\nrepinings which we sometimes meet with in poetry, the effusions of\r\nmorbid minds sickening under miseries of their own creating, and\r\nventing their bitterness upon an unoffending world. James speaks of his\r\nprivations with acute sensibility, but having mentioned them passes on,\r\nas if his manly mind disdained to brood over unavoidable calamities.\r\nWhen such a spirit breaks forth into complaint, however brief, we\r\nare aware how great must be the suffering that extorts the murmur. We\r\nsympathize with James, a romantic, active, and accomplished prince, cut\r\noff in the lustihood of youth from all the enterprise, the noble uses,\r\nand vigorous delights of life, as we do with Milton, alive to all the\r\nbeauties of nature and glories of art, when he breathes forth brief but\r\ndeep-toned lamentations over his perpetual blindness.\r\n\r\nHad not James evinced a deficiency of poetic artifice, we might almost\r\nhave suspected that these lowerings of gloomy reflection were meant as\r\npreparative to the brightest scene of his story, and to contrast with\r\nthat refulgence of light and loveliness, that exhilarating accompaniment\r\nof bird and song, and foliage and flower, and all the revel of, the\r\nyear, with which he ushers in the lady of his heart. It is this scene,\r\nin particular, which throws all the magic of romance about the old\r\ncastle keep. He had risen, he says, at daybreak, according to custom, to\r\nescape from the dreary meditations of a sleepless pillow. “Bewailing in\r\nhis chamber thus alone,” despairing of all joy and remedy, “for, tired\r\nof thought, and woe-begone,” he had wandered to the window to indulge\r\nthe captive’s miserable solace, of gazing wistfully upon the world from\r\nwhich he is excluded. The window looked forth upon a small garden which\r\nlay at the foot of the tower. It was a quiet, sheltered spot, adorned\r\nwith arbors and green alleys, and protected from the passing gaze by\r\ntrees and hawthorn hedges.\r\n\r\n    Now was there made fast by the tower’s wall,\r\n        A garden faire, and in the corners set\r\n    An arbour green with wandis long and small\r\n        Railed about, and so with leaves beset\r\n    Was all the place and hawthorn hedges knet,\r\n        That lyf* was none, walkyng there forbye,\r\n    That might within scarce any wight espye.\r\n\r\n    So thick the branches and the leves grene,\r\n        Beshaded all the alleys that there were,\r\n    And midst of every arbour might be seen,\r\n        The sharpe, grene, swete juniper,\r\n    Growing so fair with branches here and there,\r\n        That as it seemed to a lyf without,\r\n    The boughs did spread the arbour all about.\r\n\r\n    And on the small grene twistis+ set\r\n        The lytel swete nightingales, and sung\r\n    So loud and clear, the hymnis consecrate\r\n        Of lovis use, now soft, now loud among,\r\n    That all the garden and the wallis rung\r\n    Right of their song----\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Lyf, Person.\r\n\r\n     + Twistis, small boughs or twigs. NOTE--The language of the\r\n     quotations is generally modernized.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the month of May, when every thing was in bloom, and he\r\ninterprets the song of the nightingale into the language of his\r\nenamoured feeling:\r\n\r\n    Worship, all ye that lovers be, this May;\r\n        For of your bliss the kalends are begun,\r\n    And sing with us, Away, winter, away.\r\n        Come, summer, come, the sweet season and sun.\r\n\r\nAs he gazes on the scene, and listens to the notes of the birds, he\r\ngradually relapses into one of those tender and undefinable reveries,\r\nwhich fill the youthful bosom in this delicious season. He wonders what\r\nthis love may be of which he has so often read, and which thus seems\r\nbreathed forth in the quickening breath of May, and melting all nature\r\ninto ecstasy and song. If it really be so great a felicity, and if it be\r\na boon thus generally dispensed to the most insignificant beings, why is\r\nhe alone cut off from its enjoyments?\r\n\r\n    Oft would I think, O Lord, what may this be,\r\n        That love is of such noble myght and kynde?\r\n    Loving his folke, and such prosperitee,\r\n        Is it of him, as we in books do find;\r\n        May he oure hertes setten* and unbynd:\r\n    Hath he upon oure hertes such maistrye?\r\n    Or is all this but feynit fantasye?\r\n\r\n    For giff he be of so grete excellence\r\n        That he of every wight hath care and charge,\r\n    What have I gilt+ to him, or done offense,\r\n        That I am thral’d, and birdis go at large?\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Setten, incline.\r\n\r\n     + Gilt, what injury have I done, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his musing, as he casts his eye downward, he beholds\r\n“the fairest and the freshest young floure” that ever he had seen. It is\r\nthe lovely Lady Jane, walking in the garden to enjoy the beauty of that\r\n“fresh May morrowe.” Breaking thus suddenly upon his sight in a moment\r\nof loneliness and excited susceptibility, she at once captivates the\r\nfancy of the romantic prince, and becomes the object of his wandering\r\nwishes, the sovereign of his ideal world.\r\n\r\nThere is, in this charming scene, an evident resemblance to the early\r\npart of Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale, where Palamon and Arcite fall in\r\nlove with Emilia, whom they see walking in the garden of their prison.\r\nPerhaps the similarity of the actual fact to the incident which he had\r\nread in Chaucer may have induced James to dwell on it in his poem. His\r\ndescription of the Lady Jane is given in the picturesque and minute\r\nmanner of his master, and, being doubtless taken from the life, is a\r\nperfect portrait of a beauty of that day. He dwells with the fondness\r\nof a lover on every article of her apparel, from the net of pearl,\r\nsplendent with emeralds and sapphires, that confined her golden hair,\r\neven to the “goodly chaine of small orfeverye” * about her neck, whereby\r\nthere hung a ruby in shape of a heart, that seemed, he says, like a\r\nspark of fire burning upon her white bosom. Her dress of white\r\ntissue was looped up to enable her to walk with more freedom. She was\r\naccompanied by two female attendants, and about her sported a little\r\nhound decorated with bells, probably the small Italian hound of\r\nexquisite symmetry which was a parlor favorite and pet among the\r\nfashionable dames of ancient times. James closes his description by a\r\nburst of general eulogium:\r\n\r\n    In her was youth, beauty, with humble port,\r\n        Bounty, richesse, and womanly feature:\r\n    God better knows than my pen can report,\r\n        Wisdom, largesse,+ estate,++ and cunning& sure.\r\n    In every point so guided her measure,\r\n        In word, in deed, in shape, in countenance,\r\n        That nature might no more her child advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Wrought gold.\r\n\r\n     + Largesse, bounty.\r\n\r\n     ++ Estate, dignity.\r\n\r\n     & Cunning, discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe departure of the Lady Jane from the garden puts an end to this\r\ntransient riot of the heart. With her departs the amorous illusion\r\nthat had shed a temporary charm over the scene of his captivity, and he\r\nrelapses into loneliness, now rendered tenfold more intolerable by this\r\npassing beam of unattainable beauty. Through the long and weary day he\r\nrepines at his unhappy lot, and when evening approaches, and Phoebus,\r\nas he beautifully expresses it, had “bade farewell to every leaf and\r\nflower,” he still lingers at the window, and, laying his head upon the\r\ncold stone, gives vent to a mingled flow of love and sorrow, until,\r\ngradually lulled by the mute melancholy of the twilight hour, he lapses,\r\n“half-sleeping, half swoon,” into a vision, which occupies the remainder\r\nof the poem, and in which is allegorically shadowed out the history of\r\nhis passion.\r\n\r\nWhen he wakes from his trance, he rises from his stony pillow, and,\r\npacing his apartment, full of dreary reflections, questions his spirit,\r\nwhither it has been wandering; whether, indeed, all that has\r\npassed before his dreaming fancy has been conjured up by preceding\r\ncircumstances, or whether it is a vision intended to comfort and assure\r\nhim in his despondency. If the latter, he prays that some token may be\r\nsent to confirm the promise of happier days, given him in his slumbers.\r\nSuddenly, a turtledove of the purest whiteness comes flying in at the\r\nwindow, and alights upon his hand, bearing in her bill a branch of red\r\ngilliflower, on the leaves of which is written, in letters of gold, the\r\nfollowing sentence:\r\n\r\n    Awake! Awake! I bring, lover, I bring\r\n        The newis glad, that blissful is and sure\r\n    Of thy comfort; now laugh, and play, and sing,\r\n        For in the heaven decretit is thy cure.\r\n\r\nHe receives the branch with mingled hope and dread; reads it with\r\nrapture; and this he says was the first token of his succeeding\r\nhappiness. Whether this is a mere poetic fiction, or whether the Lady\r\nJane did actually send him a token of her favor in this romantic way,\r\nremains to be determined according to the fate or fancy of the reader.\r\nHe concludes his poem by intimating that the promise conveyed in the\r\nvision and by the flower, is fulfilled by his being restored to liberty,\r\nand made happy in the possession of the sovereign of his heart.\r\n\r\nSuch is the poetical account given by James of his love adventures\r\nin Windsor Castle. How much of it is absolute fact, and how much the\r\nembellishment of fancy, it is fruitless to conjecture; let us not,\r\nhowever, reject every romantic incident as incompatible with real life,\r\nbut let us sometimes take a poet at his word. I have noticed merely\r\nthose parts of the poem immediately connected with the tower, and have\r\npassed over a large part which was in the allegorical vein, so\r\nmuch cultivated at that day. The language, of course, is quaint and\r\nantiquated, so that the beauty of many of its golden phrases will\r\nscarcely be perceived at the present day, but it is impossible not to\r\nbe charmed with the genuine sentiment, the delightful artlessness and\r\nurbanity, which prevail throughout it. The descriptions of Nature too,\r\nwith which it is embellished, are given with a truth, a discrimination,\r\nand a freshness, worthy of the most cultivated periods of the art.\r\n\r\nAs an amatory poem, it is edifying, in these days of coarser thinking,\r\nto notice the nature, refinement, and exquisite delicacy which\r\npervade it; banishing every gross thought, or immodest expression, and\r\npresenting female loveliness, clothed in all its chivalrous attributes\r\nof almost supernatural purity and grace.\r\n\r\nJames flourished nearly about the time of Chaucer and Gower, and was\r\nevidently an admirer and studier of their writings. Indeed, in one of\r\nhis stanzas he acknowledges them as his masters; and in some parts\r\nof his poem we find traces of similarity to their productions, more\r\nespecially to those of Chaucer. There are always, however, general\r\nfeatures of resemblance in the works of contemporary authors, which are\r\nnot so much borrowed from each other as from the times. Writers, like\r\nbees, toll their sweets in the wide world; they incorporate with their\r\nown conceptions, the anecdotes and thoughts current in society; and thus\r\neach generation has some features in common, characteristic of the age\r\nin which it lives.\r\n\r\nJames belongs to one of the most brilliant eras of our literary history,\r\nand establishes the claims of his country to a participation in\r\nits primitive honors. Whilst a small cluster of English writers are\r\nconstantly cited as the fathers of our verse, the name of their\r\ngreat Scottish compeer is apt to be passed over in silence; but he\r\nis evidently worthy of being enrolled in that little constellation of\r\nremote but never-failing luminaries who shine in the highest firmament\r\nof literature, and who, like morning stars, sang together at the bright\r\ndawning of British poesy.\r\n\r\nSuch of my readers as may not be familiar with Scottish history (though\r\nthe manner in which it has of late been woven with captivating fiction\r\nhas made it a universal study) may be curious to learn something of the\r\nsubsequent history of James and the fortunes of his love. His passion\r\nfor the Lady Jane, as it was the solace of his captivity, so it\r\nfacilitated his release, it being imagined by the Court that a\r\nconnection with the blood-royal of England would attach him to its own\r\ninterests. He was ultimately restored to his liberty and crown, having\r\npreviously espoused the Lady Jane, who accompanied him to Scotland, and\r\nmade him a most tender and devoted wife.\r\n\r\nHe found his kingdom in great confusion, the feudal chieftains\r\nhaving taken advantage of the troubles and irregularities of a long\r\ninterregnum, to strengthen themselves in their possessions, and place\r\nthemselves above the power of the laws. James sought to found the basis\r\nof his power in the affections of his people. He attached the lower\r\norders to him by the reformation of abuses, the temperate and equable\r\nadministration of justice, the encouragement of the arts of peace, and\r\nthe promotion of every thing that could diffuse comfort, competency,\r\nand innocent enjoyment through the humblest ranks of society. He\r\nmingled occasionally among the common people in disguise; visited\r\ntheir firesides; entered into their cares, their pursuits, and their\r\namusements; informed himself of the mechanical arts, and how they could\r\nbest be patronized and improved; and was thus an all-pervading spirit,\r\nwatching with a benevolent eye over the meanest of his subjects. Having\r\nin this generous manner made himself strong in the hearts of the common\r\npeople, he turned himself to curb the power of the factious nobility;\r\nto strip them of those dangerous immunities which they had usurped; to\r\npunish such as had been guilty of flagrant offences; and to bring the\r\nwhole into proper obedience to the Crown. For some time they bore\r\nthis with outward submission, but with secret impatience and brooding\r\nresentment. A conspiracy was at length formed against his life, at the\r\nhead of which was his own uncle, Robert Stewart, Earl of Athol, who,\r\nbeing too old himself for the perpetration of the deed of blood,\r\ninstigated his grandson, Sir Robert Stewart, together with Sir Robert\r\nGraham, and others of less note, to commit the deed. They broke into his\r\nbedchamber at the Dominican convent near Perth, where he was residing,\r\nand barbarously murdered him by oft-repeated wounds. His faithful queen,\r\nrushing to throw her tender body between him and the sword, was twice\r\nwounded in the ineffectual attempt to shield him from the assassin; and\r\nit was not until she had been forcibly torn from his person, that the\r\nmurder was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt was the recollection of this romantic tale of former times, and of\r\nthe golden little poem, which had its birthplace in this tower, that\r\nmade me visit the old pile with more than common interest. The suit\r\nof armor hanging up in the hall, richly gilt and embellished, as if to\r\nfigure in the tourney, brought the image of the gallant and romantic\r\nprince vividly before my imagination. I paced the deserted chambers\r\nwhere he had composed his poem; I leaned upon the window, and endeavored\r\nto persuade myself it was the very one where he had been visited by\r\nhis vision; I looked out upon the spot where he had first seen the Lady\r\nJane. It was the same genial and joyous month; the birds were again\r\nvying with each other in strains of liquid melody; every thing was\r\nbursting into vegetation, and budding forth the tender promise of the\r\nyear. Time, which delights to obliterate the sterner memorials of human\r\npride, seems to have passed lightly over this little scene of poetry and\r\nlove, and to have withheld his desolating hand. Several centuries have\r\ngone by, yet the garden still flourishes at the foot of the tower. It\r\noccupies what was once the moat of the keep; and, though some parts have\r\nbeen separated by dividing walls, yet others have still their arbors\r\nand shaded walks, as in the days of James, and the whole is sheltered,\r\nblooming, and retired. There is a charm about the spot that has been\r\nprinted by the footsteps of departed beauty, and consecrated by the\r\ninspirations of the poet, which is heightened, rather than impaired, by\r\nthe lapse of ages. It is, indeed, the gift of poetry, to hallow every\r\nplace in which it moves; to breathe around nature an odor more exquisite\r\nthan the perfume of the rose, and to shed over it a tint more magical\r\nthan the blush of morning.\r\n\r\nOthers may dwell on the illustrious deeds of James as a warrior and a\r\nlegislator; but I have delighted to view him merely as the companion\r\nof his fellow-men, the benefactor of the human heart, stooping from his\r\nhigh estate to sow the sweet flowers of poetry and song in the paths of\r\ncommon life. He was the first to cultivate the vigorous and hardy plant\r\nof Scottish genius, which has since become so prolific of the most\r\nwholesome and highly flavored fruit. He carried with him into the\r\nsterner regions of the north, all the fertilizing arts of southern\r\nrefinement. He did every thing in his power to win his countrymen to the\r\ngay, the elegant, and gentle arts, which soften and refine the character\r\nof a people, and wreathe a grace round the loftiness of a proud and\r\nwarlike spirit. He wrote many poems, which, unfortunately for the\r\nfulness of his fame, are now lost to the world; one, which is still\r\npreserved, called “Christ’s Kirk of the Green,” shows how diligently he\r\nhad made himself acquainted with the rustic sports and pastimes, which\r\nconstitute such a source of kind and social feeling among the Scottish\r\npeasantry; and with what simple and happy humor he could enter into\r\ntheir enjoyments. He contributed greatly to improve the national music;\r\nand traces of his tender sentiment and elegant taste are said to exist\r\nin those witching airs, still piped among the wild mountains and lonely\r\nglens of Scotland. He has thus connected his image with whatever is most\r\ngracious and endearing in the national character; he has embalmed his\r\nmemory in song, and floated his name to after-ages in the rich streams\r\nof Scottish melody. The recollection of these things was kindling at my\r\nheart, as I paced the silent scene of his imprisonment. I have visited\r\nVaucluse with as much enthusiasm as a pilgrim would visit the shrine\r\nat Loretto; but I have never felt more poetical devotion than when\r\ncontemplating the old tower and the little garden at Windsor, and\r\nmusing over the romantic loves of the Lady Jane, and the Royal Poet of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY CHURCH.\r\n\r\n                                A gentleman!\r\n    What o’ the woolpack? or the sugar-chest?\r\n    Or lists of velvet? which is ‘t, pound, or yard,\r\n    You vend your gentry by?\r\n                                        BEGGAR’S BUSH.\r\n\r\nTHERE are few places more favorable to the study of character than an\r\nEnglish country church. I was once passing a few weeks at the seat of\r\na friend who resided in, the vicinity of one the appearance of which\r\nparticularly struck my fancy. It was one of those rich morsels of quaint\r\nantiquity, which gives such a peculiar charm to English landscape.\r\nIt stood in the midst of a country filled with ancient families, and\r\ncontained within its cold and silent aisles the congregated dust of many\r\nnoble generations. The interior walls were encrusted with monuments\r\nof every age and style. The light streamed through windows dimmed with\r\narmorial bearings, richly emblazoned in stained glass. In various parts\r\nof the church were tombs of knights, and highborn dames, of gorgeous\r\nworkmanship, with their effigies in colored marble. On every side, the\r\neye was struck with some instance of aspiring mortality, some haughty\r\nmemorial which human pride had erected over its kindred dust in this\r\ntemple of the most humble of all religions.\r\n\r\nThe congregation was composed of the neighboring people of rank, who sat\r\nin pews sumptuously lined and cushioned, furnished with richly-gilded\r\nprayer-books, and decorated with their arms upon the pew doors; of the\r\nvillagers and peasantry, who filled the back seats and a small gallery\r\nbeside the organ; and of the poor of the parish, who were ranged on\r\nbenches in the aisles.\r\n\r\nThe service was performed by a snuffling, well-fed vicar, who had a snug\r\ndwelling near the church. He was a privileged guest at all the tables\r\nof the neighborhood, and had been the keenest fox-hunter in the country,\r\nuntil age and good living had disabled him from doing anything more than\r\nride to see the hounds throw off, and make one at the hunting dinner.\r\n\r\nUnder the ministry of such a pastor, I found it impossible to get into\r\nthe train of thought suitable to the time and place; so, having, like\r\nmany other feeble Christians, compromised with my conscience, by laying\r\nthe sin of my own delinquency at another person’s threshold, I occupied\r\nmyself by making observations on my neighbors.\r\n\r\nI was as yet a stranger in England, and curious to notice the manners\r\nof its fashionable classes. I found, as usual, that there was the least\r\npretension where there was the most acknowledged title to respect. I was\r\nparticularly struck, for instance, with the family of a nobleman of high\r\nrank, consisting of several sons and daughters. Nothing could be more\r\nsimple and unassuming than their appearance. They generally came to\r\nchurch in the plainest equipage, and often on foot. The young ladies\r\nwould stop and converse in the kindest manner with the peasantry, caress\r\nthe children, and listen to the stories of the humble cottagers. Their\r\ncountenances were open and beautifully fair, with an expression of\r\nhigh refinement, but at the same time a frank cheerfulness and engaging\r\naffability. Their brothers were tall, and elegantly formed. They were\r\ndressed fashionably, but simply--with strict neatness and propriety, but\r\nwithout any mannerism or foppishness. Their whole demeanor was easy\r\nand natural, with that lofty grace and noble frankness which bespeak\r\nfree-born souls that have never been checked in their growth by feelings\r\nof inferiority. There is a healthful hardiness about real dignity, that\r\nnever dreads contact and communion with others, however humble. It is\r\nonly spurious pride that is morbid and sensitive, and shrinks from every\r\ntouch. I was pleased to see the manner in which they would converse with\r\nthe peasantry about those rural concerns and field-sports in which the\r\ngentlemen of the country so much delight. In these conversations there\r\nwas neither haughtiness on the one part, nor servility on the other, and\r\nyou were only reminded of the difference of rank by the habitual respect\r\nof the peasant.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these was the family of a wealthy citizen, who had\r\namassed a vast fortune, and, having purchased the estate and mansion of\r\na ruined nobleman in the neighborhood, was endeavoring to assume all the\r\nstyle and dignity of an hereditary lord of the soil. The family always\r\ncame to church en prince. They were rolled majestically along in a\r\ncarriage emblazoned with arms. The crest glittered in silver radiance\r\nfrom every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed.\r\nA fat coachman, in a three-cornered hat richly laced and a flaxen wig,\r\ncurling close round his rosy face, was seated on the box, with a sleek\r\nDanish dog beside him. Two footmen in gorgeous liveries, with huge\r\nbouquets, and gold-headed canes, lolled behind. The carriage rose and\r\nsunk on its long springs with a peculiar stateliness of motion. The very\r\nhorses champed their bits, arched their necks, and glanced their eyes\r\nmore proudly than common horses; either because they had caught a little\r\nof the family feeling, or were reined up more tightly than ordinary.\r\n\r\nI could not but admire the style with which this splendid pageant\r\nwas brought up to the gate of the churchyard. There was a vast effect\r\nproduced at the turning of an angle of the wall--a great smacking of the\r\nwhip, straining and scrambling of the horses, glistening of harness, and\r\nflashing of wheels through gravel. This was the moment of triumph and\r\nvainglory to the coachman. The horses were urged and checked, until they\r\nwere fretted into a foam. They threw out their feet in a prancing trot,\r\ndashing about pebbles at every step. The crowd of villagers sauntering\r\nquietly to church opened precipitately to the right and left, gaping in\r\nvacant admiration. On reaching the gate, the horses were pulled up with\r\na suddenness that produced an immediate stop, and almost threw them on\r\ntheir haunches.\r\n\r\nThere was an extraordinary hurry of the footmen to alight, pull down the\r\nsteps, and prepare everything for the descent on earth of this august\r\nfamily. The old citizen first emerged his round red face from out the\r\ndoor, looking about him with the pompous air of a man accustomed to rule\r\non ‘Change, and shake the Stock Market with a nod. His consort, a fine,\r\nfleshy, comfortable dame, followed him. There seemed, I must confess,\r\nbut little pride in her composition. She was the picture of broad,\r\nhonest, vulgar enjoyment. The world went well with her; and she liked\r\nthe world. She had fine clothes, a fine house, a fine carriage, fine\r\nchildren--everything was fine about her: it was nothing but driving\r\nabout and visiting and feasting. Life was to her a perpetual revel; it\r\nwas one long Lord Mayor’s Day.\r\n\r\nTwo daughters succeeded to this goodly couple. They certainly were\r\nhandsome, but had a supercilious air that chilled admiration and\r\ndisposed the spectator to be critical. They were ultrafashionable in\r\ndress, and, though no one could deny the richness of their decorations,\r\nyet their appropriateness might be questioned amidst the simplicity of\r\na country church. They descended loftily from the carriage, and moved up\r\nthe line of peasantry with a step that seemed dainty of the soil it trod\r\non. They cast an excursive glance around, that passed coldly over the\r\nburly faces of the peasantry, until they met the eyes of the nobleman’s\r\nfamily, when their countenances immediately brightened into smiles, and\r\nthey made the most profound and elegant courtesies, which were returned\r\nin a manner that showed they were but slight acquaintances.\r\n\r\nI must not forget the two sons of this inspiring citizen, who came to\r\nchurch in a dashing curricle with outriders. They were arrayed in the\r\nextremity of the mode, with all that pedantry of dress which marks\r\nthe man of questionable pretensions to style. They kept entirely by\r\nthemselves, eying every one askance that came near them, as if measuring\r\nhis claims to respectability; yet they were without conversation, except\r\nthe exchange of an occasional cant phrase. They even moved artificially,\r\nfor their bodies, in compliance with the caprice of the day, had been\r\ndisciplined into the absence of all ease and freedom. Art had done\r\neverything to accomplish them as men of fashion, but Nature had denied\r\nthem the nameless grace. They were vulgarly shaped, like men formed for\r\nthe common purposes of life, and had that air of supercilious assumption\r\nwhich is never seen in the true gentleman.\r\n\r\nI have been rather minute in drawing the pictures of these two families,\r\nbecause I considered them specimens of what is often to be met with in\r\nthis country--the unpretending great, and the arrogant little. I have no\r\nrespect for titled rank, unless it be accompanied with true nobility\r\nof soul; but I have remarked, in all countries where artificial\r\ndistinctions exist, that the very highest classes are always the most\r\ncourteous and unassuming. Those who are well assured of their own\r\nstanding are least apt to trespass on that of others; whereas, nothing\r\nis so offensive as the aspirings of vulgarity, which thinks to elevate\r\nitself by humiliating its neighbor.\r\n\r\nAs I have brought these families into contrast, I must notice their\r\nbehavior in church. That of the nobleman’s family was quiet, serious,\r\nand attentive. Not that they appeared to have any fervor of devotion,\r\nbut rather a respect for sacred things, and sacred places, inseparable\r\nfrom good-breeding. The others, on the contrary, were in a perpetual\r\nflutter and whisper; they betrayed a continual consciousness of finery,\r\nand the sorry ambition of being the wonders of a rural congregation.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was the only one really attentive to the service. He\r\ntook the whole burden of family devotion upon himself; standing bolt\r\nupright, and uttering the responses with a loud voice that might be\r\nheard all over the church. It was evident that he was one of these\r\nthorough Church-and-king men, who connect the idea of devotion and\r\nloyalty; who consider the Deity, somehow or other, of the government\r\nparty, and religion “a very excellent sort of thing, that ought to be\r\ncountenanced and kept up.”\r\n\r\nWhen he joined so loudly in the service, it seemed more by way of\r\nexample to the lower orders, to show them that, though so great and\r\nwealthy, he was not above being religious; as I have seen a turtle-fed\r\nalderman swallow publicly a basin of charity soup, smacking his lips at\r\nevery mouthful and pronouncing it “excellent food for the poor.”\r\n\r\nWhen the service was at an end, I was curious to witness the several\r\nexits of my groups. The young noblemen and their sisters, as the day\r\nwas fine, preferred strolling home across the fields, chatting with the\r\ncountry people as they went. The others departed as they came, in grand\r\nparade. Again were the equipages wheeled up to the gate. There was again\r\nthe smacking of whips, the clattering of hoofs, and the glittering of\r\nharness. The horses started off almost at a bound; the villagers again\r\nhurried to right and left; the wheels threw up a cloud of dust, and the\r\naspirin family was rapt out of sight in a whirlwind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIDOW AND HER SON.\r\n\r\n    Pittie olde age, within whose silver haires\r\n    Honour and reverence evermore have rain’d.\r\n                           MARLOWE’S TAMBURLAINE.\r\n\r\nTHOSE who are in the habit of remarking such matters must have noticed\r\nthe passive quiet of an English landscape on Sunday. The clacking of\r\nthe mill, the regularly recurring stroke of the flail, the din of the\r\nblacksmith’s hammer, the whistling of the ploughman, the rattling of\r\nthe cart, and all other sounds of rural labor are suspended. The\r\nvery farm-dogs bark less frequently, being less disturbed by passing\r\ntravellers. At such times I have almost fancied the wind sunk into\r\nquiet, and that the sunny landscape, with its fresh green tints melting\r\ninto blue haze, enjoyed the hallowed calm.\r\n\r\n    Sweet day, so pure, so calm, so brigh’\r\n    The bridal of the earth and sky.\r\n\r\nWell was it ordained that the day of devotion should be a day of rest.\r\nThe holy repose which reigns over the face of nature has its moral\r\ninfluence; every restless passion is charmed down, and we feel the\r\nnatural religion of the soul gently springing up within us. For my\r\npart, there are feelings that visit me, in a country church, amid the\r\nbeautiful serenity of nature, which I experience nowhere else; and if\r\nnot a more religious, I think I am a better man on Sunday than on any\r\nother day of the seven.\r\n\r\nDuring my recent residence in the country, I used frequently to attend\r\nat the old village church. Its shadowy aisles, its mouldering monuments,\r\nits dark oaken panelling, all reverend with the gloom of departed years,\r\nseemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation; but, being in a\r\nwealthy, aristocratic neighborhood, the glitter of fashion penetrated\r\neven into the sanctuary; and I felt myself continually thrown back upon\r\nthe world, by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms around me. The\r\nonly being in the whole congregation who appeared thoroughly to feel the\r\nhumble and prostrate piety of a true Christian was a poor decrepit old\r\nwoman, bending under the weight of years and infirmities. She bore the\r\ntraces of something better than abject poverty. The lingerings of decent\r\npride were visible in her appearance. Her dress, though humble in the\r\nextreme, was scrupulously clean. Some trivial respect, too, had been\r\nawarded her, for she did not take her seat among the village poor, but\r\nsat alone on the steps of the altar. She seemed to have survived all\r\nlove, all friendship, all society, and to have nothing left her but the\r\nhopes of heaven. When I saw her feebly rising and bending her aged form\r\nin prayer; habitually conning her prayer-book, which her palsied hand\r\nand failing eyes could not permit her to read, but which she evidently\r\nknew by heart, I felt persuaded that the faltering voice of that poor\r\nwoman arose to heaven far before the responses of the clerk, the swell\r\nof the organ, or the chanting of the choir.\r\n\r\nI am fond of loitering about country churches, and this was so\r\ndelightfully situated, that it frequently attracted me. It stood on a\r\nknoll, round which a small stream made a beautiful bend and then wound\r\nits way through a long reach of soft meadow scenery. The church was\r\nsurrounded by yew trees, which seemed almost coeval with itself. Its\r\ntall Gothic spire shot up lightly from among them, with rooks and crows\r\ngenerally wheeling about it. I was seated there one still sunny morning\r\nwatching two laborers who were digging a grave. They had chosen one of\r\nthe most remote and neglected corners of the churchyard, where, from the\r\nnumber of nameless graves around, it would appear that the indigent and\r\nfriendless were huddled into the earth. I was told that the new-made\r\ngrave was for the only son of a poor widow. While I was meditating on\r\nthe distinctions of worldly rank, which extend thus down into the very\r\ndust, the toll of the bell announced the approach of the funeral. They\r\nwere the obsequies of poverty, with which pride had nothing to do. A\r\ncoffin of the plainest materials, without pall or other covering, was\r\nborne by some of the villagers. The sexton walked before with an air\r\nof cold indifference. There were no mock mourners in the trappings of\r\naffected woe, but there was one real mourner who feebly tottered after\r\nthe corpse. It was the aged mother of the deceased, the poor old woman\r\nwhom I had seen seated on the steps of the altar. She was supported by\r\na humble friend, who was endeavoring to comfort her. A few of the\r\nneighboring poor had joined the train, and some children of the village\r\nwere running hand in hand, now shouting with unthinking mirth, and now\r\npausing to gaze, with childish curiosity on the grief of the mourner.\r\n\r\nAs the funeral train approached the grave, the parson issued from the\r\nchurch-porch, arrayed in the surplice, with prayer-book in hand, and\r\nattended by the clerk. The service, however, was a mere act of charity.\r\nThe deceased had been destitute, and the survivor was penniless. It\r\nwas shuffled through, therefore, in form, but coldly and unfeeling. The\r\nwell-fed priest moved but a few steps from the church door; his voice\r\ncould scarcely be heard at the grave; and never did I hear the funeral\r\nservice, that sublime and touching ceremony, turned into such a frigid\r\nmummery of words.\r\n\r\nI approached the grave. The coffin was placed on the ground. On it were\r\ninscribed the name and age of the deceased--“George Somers, aged 26\r\nyears.” The poor mother had been assisted to kneel down at the head\r\nof it. Her withered hands were clasped, as if in prayer; but I could\r\nperceive, by a feeble rocking of the body, and a convulsive motion of\r\nthe lips, that she was gazing on the last relics of her son with the\r\nyearnings of a mother’s heart.\r\n\r\nPreparations were made to deposit the coffin in the earth. There was\r\nthat bustling stir, which breaks so harshly on the feelings of grief and\r\naffection; directions given in the cold tones of business; the striking\r\nof spades into sand and gravel; which, at the grave of those we love,\r\nis, of all sounds, the most withering. The bustle around seemed to\r\nwaken the mother from a wretched revery. She raised her glazed eyes, and\r\nlooked about with a faint wildness. As the men approached with cords to\r\nlower the coffin into the grave, she wrung her hands, and broke into\r\nan agony of grief. The poor woman who attended her took her by the arm\r\nendeavoring to raise her from the earth, and to whisper something like\r\nconsolation: “Nay, now--nay, now--don’t take it so sorely to heart.”\r\n She could only shake her head, and wring her hands, as one not to be\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nAs they lowered the body into the earth, the creaking of the cords\r\nseemed to agonize her; but when, on some accidental obstruction, there\r\nwas a jostling of the coffin, all the tenderness of the mother burst\r\nforth, as if any harm could come to him who was far beyond the reach of\r\nworldly suffering.\r\n\r\nI could see no more--my heart swelled into my throat--my eyes filled\r\nwith tears; I felt as if I were acting a barbarous part in standing by\r\nand gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish. I wandered to another\r\npart of the churchyard, where I remained until the funeral train had\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the mother slowly and painfully quitting the grave, leaving\r\nbehind her the remains of all that was dear to her on earth, and\r\nreturning to silence and destitution, my heart ached for her. What,\r\nthought I, are the distresses of the rich? They have friends to\r\nsoothe--pleasures to beguile--a world to divert and dissipate their\r\ngriefs. What are the sorrows of the young? Their growing minds soon\r\nclose above the wound--their elastic spirits soon rise beneath the\r\npressure--their green and ductile affections soon twine round new\r\nobjects. But the sorrows of the poor, who have no outward appliances to\r\nsoothe--the sorrows of the aged, with whom life at best is but a wintry\r\nday, and who can look for no after-growth of joy--the sorrows of a\r\nwidow, aged, solitary, destitute, mourning over an only son, the last\r\nsolace of her years,--these are indeed sorrows which make us feel the\r\nimpotency of consolation.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I left the churchyard. On my way homeward, I met\r\nwith the woman who had acted as comforter: she was just returning from\r\naccompanying the mother to her lonely habitation, and I drew from her\r\nsome particulars connected with the affecting scene I had witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe parents of the deceased had resided in the village from childhood.\r\nThey had inhabited one of the neatest cottages, and by various rural\r\noccupations, and the assistance of a small garden, had supported\r\nthemselves creditably and comfortably, and led a happy and a blameless\r\nlife. They had one son, who had grown up to be the staff and pride of\r\ntheir age. “Oh, sir!” said the good woman, “he was such a comely lad,\r\nso sweet-tempered, so kind to every one around him, so dutiful to his\r\nparents! It did one’s heart good to see him of a Sunday, drest out in\r\nhis best, so tall, so straight, so cheery, supporting his old mother to\r\nchurch; for she was always fonder of leaning on George’s arm than on her\r\ngood man’s; and, poor soul, she might well be proud of him, for a finer\r\nlad there was not in the country round.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the son was tempted, during a year of scarcity and\r\nagricultural hardship, to enter into the service of one of the small\r\ncraft that plied on a neighboring river. He had not been long in this\r\nemploy, when he was entrapped by a press-gang, and carried off to sea.\r\nHis parents received tidings of his seizure, but beyond that they could\r\nlearn nothing. It was the loss of their main prop. The father, who was\r\nalready infirm, grew heartless and melancholy and sunk into his grave.\r\nThe widow, left lonely in her age and feebleness, could no longer\r\nsupport herself, and came upon the parish. Still there was a kind\r\nfeeling towards her throughout the village, and a certain respect as\r\nbeing one of the oldest inhabitants. As no one applied for the cottage\r\nin which she had passed so many happy days, she was permitted to remain\r\nin it, where she lived solitary and almost helpless. The few wants of\r\nnature were chiefly supplied from the scanty productions of her little\r\ngarden, which the neighbors would now and then cultivate for her. It was\r\nbut a few days before the time at which these circumstances were told\r\nme, that she was gathering some vegetables for her repast, when she\r\nheard the cottage-door which faced the garden, suddenly opened. A\r\nstranger came out, and seemed to be looking eagerly and wildly around.\r\nHe was dressed in seamen’s clothes, was emaciated and ghastly pale, and\r\nbore the air of one broken by sickness and hardships. He saw her and\r\nhastened towards her, but his steps were faint and faltering; he sank on\r\nhis knees before her and sobbed like a child. The poor woman gazed upon\r\nhim with a vacant and wandering eye. “Oh, my dear, dear mother! don’t\r\nyou know your son? your poor boy, George?” It was, indeed, the wreck\r\nof her once noble lad; who shattered by wounds, by sickness and foreign\r\nimprisonment, had, at length, dragged his wasted limbs homeward, to\r\nrepose among the scenes of his childhood.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to detail the particulars of such a meeting, where\r\nsorrow and joy were so completely blended: still, he was alive! he was\r\ncome home! he might yet live to comfort and cherish her old age! Nature,\r\nhowever, was exhausted in him; and if any thing had been wanting to\r\nfinish the work of fate, the desolation of his native cottage would have\r\nbeen sufficient. He stretched himself on the pallet on which his widowed\r\nmother had passed many a sleepless night, and he never rose from it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe villagers, when they heard that George Somers had returned, crowded\r\nto see him, offering every comfort and assistance that their humble\r\nmeans afforded. He was too weak, however, to talk--he could only\r\nlook his thanks. His mother was his constant attendant; and he seemed\r\nunwilling to be helped by any other hand.\r\n\r\nThere is something in sickness that breaks down the pride of manhood,\r\nthat softens the heart, and brings it back to the feelings of infancy.\r\nWho that has languished, even in advanced life, in sickness and\r\ndespondency, who that has pined on a weary bed in the neglect and\r\nloneliness of a foreign land, but has thought on the mother “that looked\r\non his childhood,” that smoothed his pillow, and administered to his\r\nhelplessness? Oh, there is an enduring tenderness in the love of a\r\nmother to a son, that transcends all other affections of the heart.\r\nIt is neither to be chilled by selfishness, nor daunted by danger,\r\nnor weakened by worthlessness, nor stifled by ingratitude. She will\r\nsacrifice every comfort to his convenience; she will surrender every\r\npleasure to his enjoyment; she will glory in his fame and exult in his\r\nprosperity; and, if misfortune overtake him, he will be the dearer to\r\nher from misfortune; and if disgrace settle upon his name, she will\r\nstill love and cherish him in spite of his disgrace; and if all the\r\nworld beside cast him off, she will be all the world to him.\r\n\r\nPoor George Somers had known what it was to be in sickness, and none to\r\nsoothe--lonely and in prison, and none to visit him. He could not endure\r\nhis mother from his sight; if she moved away, his eye would follow her.\r\nShe would sit for hours by his bed watching him as he slept. Sometimes\r\nhe would start from a feverish dream, and look anxiously up until he saw\r\nher bending over him; when he would take her hand, lay it on his bosom,\r\nand fall asleep with the tranquillity of a child. In this way he died.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse on hearing this humble tale of affliction was to visit\r\nthe cottage of the mourner, and administer pecuniary assistance, and, if\r\npossible, comfort. I found, however, on inquiry, that the good feelings\r\nof the villagers had prompted them to do everything that the case\r\nadmitted; and as the poor know best how to console each other’s sorrows,\r\nI did not venture to intrude.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday I was at the village church, when, to my surprise, I saw\r\nthe poor old woman tottering down the aisle to her accustomed seat on\r\nthe steps of the altar.\r\n\r\nShe had made an effort to put on something like mourning for her son;\r\nand nothing could be more touching than this struggle between pious\r\naffection and utter poverty--a black ribbon or so, a faded black\r\nhandkerchief, and one or two more such humble attempts to express by\r\noutward signs that grief which passes show. When I looked round upon\r\nthe storied monuments, the stately hatchments, the cold marble pomp with\r\nwhich grandeur mourned magnificently over departed pride, and turned to\r\nthis poor widow, bowed down by age and sorrow at the altar of her God,\r\nand offering up the prayers and praises of a pious though a broken\r\nheart, I felt that this living monument of real grief was worth them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI related her story to some of the wealthy members of the congregation,\r\nand they were moved by it. They exerted themselves to render her\r\nsituation more comfortable, and to lighten her afflictions. It was,\r\nhowever, but smoothing a few steps to the grave. In the course of a\r\nSunday or two after, she was missed from her usual seat at church, and\r\nbefore I left the neighborhood I heard, with a feeling of satisfaction,\r\nthat she had quietly breathed her last, and had gone to rejoin those she\r\nloved, in that world where sorrow is never known and friends are never\r\nparted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUNDAY IN LONDON.*\r\n\r\n     * Part of a sketch omitted in the preceding editions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a preceding paper I have spoken of an English Sunday in the country\r\nand its tranquillizing effect upon the landscape; but where is its\r\nsacred influence more strikingly apparent than in the very heart of that\r\ngreat Babel, London? On this sacred day the gigantic monster is charmed\r\ninto repose. The intolerable din and struggle of the week are at an\r\nend. The shops are shut. The fires of forges and manufactories are\r\nextinguished, and the sun, no longer obscured by murky clouds of smoke,\r\npours down a sober yellow radiance into the quiet streets. The\r\nfew pedestrians we meet, instead of hurrying forward with anxious\r\ncountenances, move leisurely along; their brows are smoothed from the\r\nwrinkles of business and care; they have put on their Sunday looks and\r\nSunday manners with their Sunday clothes, and are cleansed in mind as\r\nwell as in person.\r\n\r\nAnd now the melodious clangor of bells from church towers summons their\r\nseveral flocks to the fold. Forth issues from his mansion the family\r\nof the decent tradesman, the small children in the advance; then the\r\ncitizen and his comely spouse, followed by the grown-up daughters,\r\nwith small morocco-bound prayer-books laid in the folds of their\r\npocket-handkerchiefs. The housemaid looks after them from the window,\r\nadmiring the finery of the family, and receiving, perhaps, a nod and\r\nsmile from her young mistresses, at whose toilet she has assisted.\r\n\r\nNow rumbles along the carriage of some magnate of the city, peradventure\r\nan alderman or a sheriff, and now the patter of many feet announces it\r\nprocession of charity scholars in uniforms of antique cut, and each with\r\na prayer-book under his arm.\r\n\r\nThe ringing of bells is at an end; the rumbling of the carriage has\r\nceased; the pattering of feet is heard no more; the flocks are folded\r\nin ancient churches, cramped up in by-lanes and corners of the crowded\r\ncity, where the vigilant beadle keeps watch, like the shepherd’s dog,\r\nround the threshold of the sanctuary. For a time everything is hushed,\r\nbut soon is heard the deep, pervading sound of the organ, rolling and\r\nvibrating through the empty lanes and courts, and the sweet chanting of\r\nthe choir making them resound with melody and praise. Never have I been\r\nmore sensible of the sanctifying effect of church music than when I\r\nhave heard it thus poured forth, like a river of joy, through the inmost\r\nrecesses of this great metropolis, elevating it, as it were, from all\r\nthe sordid pollutions of the week, and bearing the poor world-worn soul\r\non a tide of triumphant harmony to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe morning service is at an end. The streets are again alive with the\r\ncongregations returning to their homes, but soon again relapse into\r\nsilence. Now comes on the Sunday dinner, which, to the city tradesman,\r\nis a meal of some importance. There is more leisure for social enjoyment\r\nat the board. Members of the family can now gather together, who are\r\nseparated by the laborious occupations of the week. A school-boy may be\r\npermitted on that day to come to the paternal home; an old friend of\r\nthe family takes his accustomed Sunday seat at the board, tells over\r\nhis well-known stories, and rejoices young and old with his well-known\r\njokes.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon the city pours forth its lesions to breathe the\r\nfresh air and enjoy the sunshine of the parks and rural environs.\r\nSatirists may say what they please about the rural enjoyments of a\r\nLondon citizen on Sunday, but to me there is something delightful in\r\nbeholding the poor prisoner of the crowded and dusty city enabled thus\r\nto come forth once a week and throw himself upon the green bosom of\r\nnature. He is like a child restored to the mother’s breast; and they\r\nwho first spread out these noble parks and magnificent pleasure-grounds\r\nwhich surround this huge metropolis have done at least as much for\r\nits health and morality as if they had expended the amount of cost in\r\nhospitals, prisons, and penitentiaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOAR’S HEAD TAVERN, EASTCHEAP.\r\n\r\nA SHAKESPEARIAN RESEARCH.\r\n\r\n“A tavern is the rendezvous, the exchange, the staple of good fellows.\r\nI have heard my great-grandfather tell, how his great-great-grandfather\r\nshould say, that it was an old proverb when his great-grandfather was a\r\nchild, that ‘it was a good wind that blew a man to the wine.’”\r\n\r\nMOTHER BOMBIE.\r\n\r\nIT is a pious custom in some Catholic countries to honor the memory of\r\nsaints by votive lights burnt before their pictures. The popularity of\r\na saint, therefore, may be known by the number of these offerings.\r\nOne, perhaps, is left to moulder in the darkness of his little chapel;\r\nanother may have a solitary lamp to throw its blinking rays athwart his\r\neffigy; while the whole blaze of adoration is lavished at the shrine\r\nof some beatified father of renown. The wealthy devotee brings his huge\r\nluminary of wax, the eager zealot, his seven-branched candlestick; and\r\neven the mendicant pilgrim is by no means satisfied that sufficient\r\nlight is thrown upon the deceased unless he hangs up his little lamp\r\nof smoking oil. The consequence is, that in the eagerness to enlighten,\r\nthey are often apt to obscure; and I have occasionally seen an unlucky\r\nsaint almost smoked out of countenance by the officiousness of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nIn like manner has it fared with the immortal Shakespeare. Every writer\r\nconsiders it his bounden duty to light up some portion of his character\r\nor works, and to rescue some merit from oblivion. The commentator,\r\nopulent in words, produces vast tomes of dissertations; the common herd\r\nof editors send up mists of obscurity from their notes at the bottom of\r\neach page; and every casual scribbler brings his farthing rushlight of\r\neulogy or research to swell the cloud of incense and of smoke.\r\n\r\nAs I honor all established usages of my brethren of the quill, I thought\r\nit but proper to contribute my mite of homage to the memory of the\r\nillustrious bard. I was for some time, however, sorely puzzled in what\r\nway I should discharge this duty. I found myself anticipated in every\r\nattempt at a new reading; every doubtful line had been explained a dozen\r\ndifferent ways, and perplexed beyond the reach of elucidation; and as\r\nto fine passages, they had all been amply praised by previous admirers;\r\nnay, so completely had the bard, of late, been overlarded with panegyric\r\nby a great German critic that it was difficult now to find even a fault\r\nthat had not been argued into a beauty.\r\n\r\nIn this perplexity I was one morning turning over his pages when I\r\ncasually opened upon the comic scenes of Henry IV., and was, in a\r\nmoment, completely lost in the madcap revelry of the Boar’s Head Tavern.\r\nSo vividly and naturally are these scenes of humor depicted, and with\r\nsuch force and consistency are the characters sustained, that they\r\nbecome mingled up in the mind with the facts and personages of real\r\nlife. To few readers does it occur that these are all ideal creations\r\nof a poet’s brain, and that, in sober truth, no such knot of merry\r\nroisterers ever enlivened the dull neighborhood of Eastcheap.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I love to give myself up to the illusions of poetry. A hero\r\nof fiction that never existed is just as valuable to me as a hero of\r\nhistory that existed a thousand years since and, if I may be excused\r\nsuch an insensibility to the common ties of human nature, I would not\r\ngive up fat Jack for half the great men of ancient chronicle. What\r\nhave the heroes of yore done for me or men like me? They have conquered\r\ncountries of which I do not enjoy an acre, or they have gained laurels\r\nof which I do not inherit a leaf, or they have furnished examples of\r\nhair-brained prowess, which I have neither the opportunity nor the\r\ninclination to follow. But, old Jack Falstaff! kind Jack Falstaff! sweet\r\nJack Falstaff! has enlarged the boundaries of human enjoyment; he has\r\nadded vast regions of wit and good-humor, in which the poorest man may\r\nrevel, and has bequeathed a never-failing inheritance of jolly laughter,\r\nto make mankind merrier and better to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\nA thought suddenly struck me. “I will make a pilgrimage to Eastcheap,”\r\n said I, closing the book, “and see if the old Boar’s Head Tavern still\r\nexists. Who knows but I may light upon some legendary traces of Dame\r\nQuickly and her guests? At any rate, there will be a kindred pleasure in\r\ntreading the halls once vocal with their mirth to that the toper enjoys\r\nin smelling to the empty cask, once filled with generous wine.”\r\n\r\nThe resolution was no sooner formed than put in execution. I forbear to\r\ntreat of the various adventures and wonders I encountered in my travels;\r\nof the haunted regions of Cock Lane; of the faded glories of Little\r\nBritain and the parts adjacent; what perils I ran in Cateaton Street\r\nand Old Jewry; of the renowned Guildhall and its two stunted giants, the\r\npride and wonder of the city and the terror of all unlucky urchins; and\r\nhow I visited London Stone, and struck my staff upon it in imitation of\r\nthat arch-rebel Jack Cade.\r\n\r\nLet it suffice to say, that I at length arrived in merry Eastcheap, that\r\nancient region of wit and wassail, where the very names of the streets\r\nrelished of good cheer, as Pudding Lane bears testimony even at the\r\npresent day. For Eastcheap, says old Stow, “was always famous for its\r\nconvivial doings. The cookes cried hot ribbes of beef roasted, pies well\r\nbaked, and other victuals: there was clattering of pewter pots, harpe,\r\npipe, and sawtrie.” Alas! how sadly is the scene changed since the\r\nroaring days of Falstaff and old Stow! The madcap roisterer has given\r\nplace to the plodding tradesman; the clattering of pots and the sound of\r\n“harpe and sawtrie,” to the din of carts and the accurst dinging of the\r\ndustman’s bell; and no song is heard, save, haply, the strain of some\r\nsyren from Billingsgate, chanting the eulogy of deceased mackerel.\r\n\r\nI sought, in vain, for the ancient abode of Dame Quickly. The only\r\nrelict of it is a boar’s head, carved in relief in stone, which formerly\r\nserved as the sign, but at present is built into the parting line of two\r\nhouses which stand on the site of the renowned old tavern.\r\n\r\nFor the history of this little abode of good fellowship I was referred\r\nto a tallow-chandler’s widow opposite, who had been born and brought up\r\non the spot, and was looked up to as the indisputable chronicler of the\r\nneighborhood. I found her seated in a little back parlor, the window\r\nof which looked out upon a yard about eight feet square laid out as a\r\nflower-garden, while a glass door opposite afforded a distant view of\r\nthe street, through a vista of soap and tallow candles--the two views,\r\nwhich comprised, in all probability, her prospects in life and the\r\nlittle world in which she had lived and moved and had her being for the\r\nbetter part of a century.\r\n\r\nTo be versed in the history of Eastcheap, great and little, from London\r\nStone even unto the Monument, was doubtless, in her opinion, to be\r\nacquainted with the history of the universe. Yet, with all this, she\r\npossessed the simplicity of true wisdom, and that liberal communicative\r\ndisposition which I have generally remarked in intelligent old ladies\r\nknowing in the concerns of their neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHer information, however, did not extend far back into antiquity. She\r\ncould throw no light upon the history of the Boar’s Head from the time\r\nthat Dame Quickly espoused the valiant Pistol until the great fire of\r\nLondon when it was unfortunately burnt down. It was soon rebuilt,\r\nand continued to flourish under the old name and sign, until a dying\r\nlandlord, struck with remorse for double scores, bad measures, and\r\nother iniquities which are incident to the sinful race of publicans,\r\nendeavored to make his peace with Heaven by bequeathing the tavern to\r\nSt. Michael’s Church, Crooked Lane, toward the supporting of a chaplain.\r\nFor some time the vestry meetings were regularly held there, but it\r\nwas observed that the old Boar never held up his head under church\r\ngovernment. He gradually declined, and finally gave his last gasp about\r\nthirty years since. The tavern was then turned into shops; but she\r\ninformed me that a picture of it was still preserved in St. Michael’s\r\nChurch, which stood just in the rear. To get a sight of this picture\r\nwas now my determination; so, having informed myself of the abode of\r\nthe sexton, I took my leave of the venerable chronicler of Eastcheap, my\r\nvisit having doubtless raised greatly her opinion of her legendary lore\r\nand furnished an important incident in the history of her life.\r\n\r\nIt cost me some difficulty and much curious inquiry to ferret out the\r\nhumble hanger-on to the church. I had to explore Crooked Lane and divers\r\nlittle alleys and elbows and dark passages with which this old city is\r\nperforated like an ancient cheese, or a worm-eaten chest of drawers.\r\nAt length I traced him to a corner of a small court surrounded by lofty\r\nhouses, where the inhabitants enjoy about as much of the face of heaven\r\nas a community of frogs at the bottom of a well.\r\n\r\nThe sexton was a meek, acquiescing little man, of a bowing, lowly habit,\r\nyet he had a pleasant twinkling in his eye, and if encouraged, would\r\nnow and then hazard a small pleasantry, such as a man of his low estate\r\nmight venture to make in the company of high churchwardens and other\r\nmighty men of the earth. I found him in company with the deputy\r\norganist, seated apart, like Milton’s angels, discoursing, no doubt,\r\non high doctrinal points, and settling the affairs of the church over a\r\nfriendly pot of ale; for the lower classes of English seldom deliberate\r\non any weighty matter without the assistance of a cool tankard to clear\r\ntheir understandings. I arrived at the moment when they had finished\r\ntheir ale and their argument, and were about to repair to the church\r\nto put it in order; so, having made known my wishes, I received their\r\ngracious permission to accompany them.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Michael’s, Crooked Lane, standing a short distance\r\nfrom Billingsgate, is enriched with the tombs of many fishmongers\r\nof renown; and as every profession has its galaxy of glory and\r\nits constellation of great men, I presume the monument of a mighty\r\nfishmonger of the olden time is regarded with as much reverence by\r\nsucceeding generations of the craft, as poets feel on contemplating the\r\ntomb of Virgil or soldiers the monument of a Marlborough or Turenne.\r\n\r\nI cannot but turn aside, while thus speaking of illustrious men, to\r\nobserve that St. Michael’s, Crooked Lane, contains also the ashes of\r\nthat doughty champion, William Walworth, Knight, who so manfully clove\r\ndown the sturdy wight, Wat Tyler, in Smithfield--a hero worthy of\r\nhonorable blazon, as almost the only Lord Mayor on record famous for\r\ndeeds of arms, the sovereigns of Cockney being generally renowned as the\r\nmost pacific of all potentates.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The following was the ancient inscription on the monument\r\n     of this worthy, which, unhappily, was destroyed in the great\r\n     conflagration.\r\n\r\n    Hereunder lyth a man of Fame,\r\n    William Walworth callyd by name:\r\n    Fishmonger he was in lyfftime here,\r\n    And twise Lord Maior, as in books appere;\r\n    Who, with courage stout and manly myght,\r\n    Slew Jack Straw in Kyng Richard’s sight.\r\n    For which act done, and trew entent,\r\n    The Kyng made him knyght incontinent\r\n    And gave him armes, as here you see,\r\n    To declare his fact and chivaldrie.\r\n    He left this lyff the yere of our God\r\n    Thirteen hundred fourscore and three odd.\r\n\r\nAn error in the foregoing inscription has been corrected by the\r\nvenerable Stow. “Whereas,” saith he, “it hath been far spread abroad by\r\nvulgar opinion, that the rebel smitten down so manfully by Sir William\r\nWalworth, the then worthy Lord Maior, was named Jack Straw, and not Wat\r\nTyler, I thought good to reconcile this rash-conceived doubt by such\r\ntestimony as I find in ancient and good records. The principal leaders,\r\nor captains, of the commons, were Wat Tyler, as the first man; the\r\nsecond was John, or Jack, Straw, etc., etc.”--STOW’S London.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjoining the church, in a small cemetery, immediately under the back\r\nwindow of what was once the Boar’s Head, stands the tombstone of Robert\r\nPreston, whilom drawer at the tavern. It is now nearly a century since\r\nthis trusty drawer of good liquor closed his bustling career and was\r\nthus quietly deposited within call of his customers. As I was clearing\r\naway the weeds from his epitaph the little sexton drew me on one side\r\nwith a mysterious air, and informed me in a low voice that once upon\r\na time, on a dark wintry night, when the wind was unruly, howling, and\r\nwhistling, banging about doors and windows, and twirling weathercocks,\r\nso that the living were frightened out of their beds, and even the dead\r\ncould not sleep quietly in their graves, the ghost of honest Preston,\r\nwhich happened to be airing itself in the churchyard, was attracted\r\nby the well-known call of “Waiter!” from the Boar’s Head, and made its\r\nsudden appearance in the midst of a roaring club, just as the parish\r\nclerk was singing a stave from the “mirre garland of Captain Death;” to\r\nthe discomfiture of sundry train-band captains and the conversion of an\r\ninfidel attorney, who became a zealous Christian on the spot, and\r\nwas never known to twist the truth afterwards, except in the way of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nI beg it may be remembered, that I do not pledge myself for the\r\nauthenticity of this anecdote, though it is well known that the\r\nchurchyards and by-corners of this old metropolis are very much infested\r\nwith perturbed spirits; and every one must have heard of the Cock Lane\r\nghost, and the apparition that guards the regalia in the Tower which has\r\nfrightened so many bold sentinels almost out of their wits.\r\n\r\nBe all this as it may, this Robert Preston seems to have been a worthy\r\nsuccessor to the nimbletongued Francis, who attended upon the revels of\r\nPrince Hal; to have been equally prompt with his “Anon, anon, sir;”\r\n and to have transcended his predecessor in honesty; for Falstaff, the\r\nveracity of whose taste no man will venture to impeach, flatly accuses\r\nFrancis of putting lime in his sack, whereas honest Preston’s epitaph\r\nlands him for the sobriety of his conduct, the soundness of his wine,\r\nand the fairness of his measure.* The worthy dignitaries of the church,\r\nhowever, did not appear much captivated by the sober virtues of the\r\ntapster; the deputy organist, who had a moist look out of the eye, made\r\nsome shrewd remark on the abstemiousness of a man brought up among\r\nfull hogsheads, and the little sexton corroborated his opinion by a\r\nsignificant wink and a dubious shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * As this inscription is rife with excellent morality, I\r\n     transcribe it for the admonition of delinquent tapsters. It\r\n     is no doubt, the production of some choice spirit who once\r\n     frequented the Boar’s Head.\r\n\r\n    Bacchus, to give the toping world surprise,\r\n    Produced one sober son, and here he lies.\r\n    Though rear’d among full hogsheads, he defy’d\r\n    The charms of wine, and every one beside.\r\n    O reader, if to justice thou ‘rt inclined,\r\n    Keep honest Preston daily in thy mind.\r\n    He drew good wine, took care to fill his pots,\r\n    Had sundry virtues that excused his faults.\r\n    You that on Bacchus have the like dependence,\r\n    Pray copy Bob in measure and attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far my researches, though they threw much light on the history of\r\ntapsters, fishmongers, and Lord Mayors, yet disappointed me in the\r\ngreat object of my quest, the picture of the Boar’s Head Tavern. No\r\nsuch painting was to be found in the church of St. Michael’s. “Marry and\r\namen,” said I, “here endeth my research!” So I was giving the matter\r\nup, with the air of a baffled antiquary, when my friend the sexton,\r\nperceiving me to be curious in everything relative to the old tavern,\r\noffered to show me the choice vessels of the vestry, which had been\r\nhanded down from remote times when the parish meetings were held at the\r\nBoar’s Head. These were deposited in the parish club-room, which had\r\nbeen transferred, on the decline of the ancient establishment, to a\r\ntavern in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nA few steps brought us to the house, which stands No. 12 Miles Lane,\r\nbearing the title of The Mason’s Arms, and is kept by Master Edward\r\nHoneyball, the “bully-rock” of the establishment. It is one of those\r\nlittle taverns which abound in the heart of the city and form the centre\r\nof gossip and intelligence of the neighborhood. We entered the barroom,\r\nwhich was narrow and darkling, for in these close lanes but few rays of\r\nreflected light are enabled to struggle down to the inhabitants, whose\r\nbroad day is at best but a tolerable twilight. The room was partitioned\r\ninto boxes, each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth,\r\nready for dinner. This showed that the guests were of the good old\r\nstamp, and divided their day equally, for it was but just one o’clock.\r\nAt the lower end of the room was a clear coal fire, before which a\r\nbreast of lamb was roasting. A row of bright brass candlesticks and\r\npewter mugs glistened along the mantelpiece, and an old fashioned clock\r\nticked in one corner. There was something primitive in this medley of\r\nkitchen, parlor, and hall that carried me back to earlier times, and\r\npleased me. The place, indeed, was humble, but everything had that look\r\nof order and neatness which bespeaks the superintendence of a notable\r\nEnglish housewife. A group of amphibious-looking beings, who might be\r\neither fishermen or sailors, were regaling themselves in one of the\r\nboxes. As I was a visitor of rather higher pretensions, I was ushered\r\ninto a little misshapen back room, having at least nine corners. It was\r\nlighted by a sky-light, furnished with antiquated leathern chairs, and\r\nornamented with the portrait of a fat pig. It was evidently appropriated\r\nto particular customers, and I found a shabby gentleman in a red nose\r\nand oil-cloth hat seated in one corner meditating on a half empty pot of\r\nporter.\r\n\r\nThe old sexton had taken the landlady aside, and with an air of profound\r\nimportance imparted to her my errand. Dame Honeyball was a likely,\r\nplump, bustling little woman, and no bad substitute for that paragon\r\nof hostesses, Dame Quickly. She seemed delighted with an opportunity to\r\noblige, and, hurrying upstairs to the archives of her house, where\r\nthe precious vessels of the parish club were deposited, she returned,\r\nsmiling and courtesying, with them in her hands.\r\n\r\nThe first she presented me was a japanned iron tobacco-box of gigantic\r\nsize, out of which, I was told, the vestry had smoked at their stated\r\nmeetings since time immemorial, and which was never suffered to be\r\nprofaned by vulgar hands, or used on common occasions, I received it\r\nwith becoming reverence, but what was my delight at beholding on\r\nits cover the identical painting of which I was in quest! There was\r\ndisplayed the outside of the Boar’s Head Tavern, and before the door was\r\nto be seen the whole convivial group at table, in full revel, pictured\r\nwith that wonderful fidelity and force with which the portraits of\r\nrenowned generals and commodores are illustrated on tobacco-boxes, for\r\nthe benefit of posterity. Lest, however, there should be any mistake,\r\nthe cunning limner had warily inscribed the names of Prince Hal and\r\nFalstaff on the bottoms of their chairs.\r\n\r\nOn the inside of the cover was an inscription, nearly obliterated,\r\nrecording that this box was the gift of Sir Richard Gore, for the use of\r\nthe vestry meetings at the Boar’s Head Tavern, and that it was “repaired\r\nand beautified by his successor, Mr. John Packard, 1767.” Such is a\r\nfaithful description of this august and venerable relic, and I question\r\nwhether the learned Scriblerius contemplated his Roman shield, or\r\nthe Knights of the Round Table the long-sought San-greal, with more\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\nWhile I was meditating on it with enraptured gaze, Dame Honeyball,\r\nwho was highly gratified by the interest it excited, put in my hands\r\na drinking-cup or goblet which also belonged to the vestry, and was\r\ndescended from the old Boar’s Head. It bore the inscription of having\r\nbeen the gift of Francis Wythers, Knight, and was held, she told me, in\r\nexceeding great value, being considered very “antyke.” This last opinion\r\nwas strengthened by the shabby gentleman with the red nose and oilcloth\r\nhat, and whom I strongly suspected of being a lineal descendant from the\r\nvariant Bardolph. He suddenly aroused from his meditation on the pot of\r\nporter, and casting a knowing look at the goblet, exclaimed, “Ay, ay!\r\nthe head don’t ache now that made that there article.”\r\n\r\nThe great importance attached to this memento of ancient revelry by\r\nmodern churchwardens, at first puzzled me; but there is nothing sharpens\r\nthe apprehension so much as antiquarian research; for I immediately\r\nperceived that this could be no other than the identical “parcel-gilt\r\ngoblet,” on which Falstaff made his loving but faithless vow to Dame\r\nQuickly, and which would, of course, be treasured up with care among the\r\nregalia of her domains, as a testimony of that solemn contract.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting\r\n     in my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal\r\n     fire, on Wednesday, in Whitsun-week, when the prince broke\r\n     thy head for likening his father to a singing man at\r\n     Windsor; thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy\r\n     wound, to marry me, and make me my lady, thy wife. Canst\r\n     thou deny it?”--Henry IV., Part 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine hostess, indeed, gave me a long history how the goblet had been\r\nhanded down from generation to generation. She also entertained me\r\nwith many particulars concerning the worthy vestrymen who have seated\r\nthemselves thus quietly on the stools of the ancient roisterers of\r\nEastcheap, and, like so many commentators, utter clouds of smoke in\r\nhonor of Shakespeare. These I forbear to relate, lest my readers should\r\nnot be as curious in these matters as myself. Suffice it to say, the\r\nneighbors, one and all, about Eastcheap, believe that Falstaff and his\r\nmerry crew actually lived and revelled there. Nay, there are several\r\nlegendary anecdotes concerning him still extant among the oldest\r\nfrequenters of the Mason’s Arms, which they give as transmitted down\r\nfrom their forefathers; and Mr. M’Kash, an Irish hair-dresser, whose\r\nshop stands on the site of the old Boar’s Head, has several dry jokes\r\nof Fat Jack’s, not laid down in the books, with which he makes his\r\ncustomers ready to die of laughter.\r\n\r\nI now turned to my friend the sexton to make some further inquiries, but\r\nI found him sunk in pensive meditation. His head had declined a little\r\non one side; a deep sigh heaved from the very bottom of his stomach,\r\nand, though I could not see a tear trembling in his eye, yet a moisture\r\nwas evidently stealing from a corner of his mouth. I followed the\r\ndirection of his eye through the door which stood open, and found it\r\nfixed wistfully on the savory breast of lamb, roasting in dripping\r\nrichness before the fire.\r\n\r\nI now called to mind that in the eagerness of my recondite\r\ninvestigation, I was keeping the poor man from his dinner. My bowels\r\nyearned with sympathy, and putting in his hand a small token of my\r\ngratitude and goodness, I departed with a hearty benediction on him,\r\nDame Honeyball, and the parish club of Crooked Lane--not forgetting my\r\nshabby, but sententious friend, in the oil-cloth hat and copper nose.\r\n\r\nThus have I given a “tedious brief” account of this interesting\r\nresearch, for which, if it prove too short and unsatisfactory, I can\r\nonly plead my inexperience in this branch of literature, so deservedly\r\npopular at the present day. I am aware that a more skilful illustrator\r\nof the immortal bard would have swelled the materials I have touched\r\nupon to a good merchantable bulk, comprising the biographies of William\r\nWalworth, Jack Straw, and Robert Preston; some notice of the eminent\r\nfishmongers of St. Michael’s; the history of Eastcheap, great and\r\nlittle; private anecdotes of Dame Honeyball and her pretty daughter,\r\nwhom I have not even mentioned; to say nothing of a damsel tending the\r\nbreast of lamb (and whom, by the way, I remarked to be a comely lass\r\nwith a neat foot and ankle);--the whole enlivened by the riots of Wat\r\nTyler, and illuminated by the great fire of London.\r\n\r\nAll this I leave, as a rich mine, to be worked by future commentators,\r\nnor do I despair of seeing the tobacco-box, and the “parcel-gilt goblet”\r\n which I have thus brought to light the subject of future engravings,\r\nand almost as fruitful of voluminous dissertations and disputes as the\r\nshield of Achilles or the far-famed Portland Vase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUTABILITY OF LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nA COLLOQUY IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.\r\n\r\n        I know that all beneath the moon decays,\r\n    And what by mortals in this world is brought,\r\n    In time’s great periods shall return to nought.\r\n        I know that all the muses’ heavenly rays,\r\n    With toil of sprite which are so dearly bought,\r\n    As idle sounds, of few or none are sought--\r\n        That there is nothing lighter than mere praise.\r\n                         DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN.\r\n\r\nTHERE are certain half-dreaming moods of mind in which we naturally\r\nsteal away from noise and glare, and seek some quiet haunt where we may\r\nindulge our reveries and build our air castles undisturbed. In such a\r\nmood I was loitering about the old gray cloisters of Westminster Abbey,\r\nenjoying that luxury of wandering thought which one is apt to dignify\r\nwith the name of reflection, when suddenly an irruption of madcap boys\r\nfrom Westminster school, playing at football, broke in upon the monastic\r\nstillness of the place, making the vaulted passages and mouldering tombs\r\necho with their merriment. I sought to take refuge from their noise by\r\npenetrating still deeper into the solitudes of the pile, and applied to\r\none of the vergers for admission to the library. He conducted me through\r\na portal rich with the crumbling sculpture of former ages, which opened\r\nupon a gloomy passage leading to the chapter-house and the chamber in\r\nwhich Doomsday Book is deposited. Just within the passage is a small\r\ndoor on the left. To this the verger applied a key; it was double\r\nlocked, and opened with some difficulty, as if seldom used. We now\r\nascended a dark narrow staircase, and, passing through a second door,\r\nentered the library.\r\n\r\nI found myself in a lofty antique hall, the roof supported by massive\r\njoists of old English oak. It was soberly lighted by a row of Gothic\r\nwindows at a considerable height from the floor, and which apparently\r\nopened upon the roofs of the cloisters. An ancient picture of some\r\nreverend dignitary of the Church in his robes hung over the fireplace.\r\nAround the hall and in a small gallery were the books, arranged in\r\ncarved oaken cases. They consisted principally of old polemical writers,\r\nand were much more worn by time than use. In the centre of the library\r\nwas a solitary table with two or three books on it, an inkstand without\r\nink, and a few pens parched by long disuse. The place seemed fitted\r\nfor quiet study and profound meditation. It was buried deep among the\r\nmassive walls of the abbey and shut up from the tumult of the world.\r\nI could only hear now and then the shouts of the school-boys faintly\r\nswelling from the cloisters, and the sound of a bell tolling for prayers\r\nechoing soberly along the roofs of the abbey. By degrees the shouts of\r\nmerriment grew fainter and fainter, and at length died away; the bell\r\nceased to toll, and a profound silence reigned through the dusky hall.\r\n\r\nI had taken down a little thick quarto, curiously bound in parchment,\r\nwith brass clasps, and seated myself at the table in a venerable\r\nelbow-chair. Instead of reading, however, I was beguiled by the solemn\r\nmonastic air and lifeless quiet of the place, into a train of musing.\r\nAs I looked around upon the old volumes in their mouldering covers, thus\r\nranged on the shelves and apparently never disturbed in their repose,\r\nI could not but consider the library a kind of literary catacomb, where\r\nauthors, like mummies, are piously entombed and left to blacken and\r\nmoulder in dusty oblivion.\r\n\r\nHow much, thought I, has each of these volumes, now thrust aside with\r\nsuch indifference, cost some aching head! how many weary days! how\r\nmany sleepless nights! How have their authors buried themselves in the\r\nsolitude of cells and cloisters, shut themselves up from the face of\r\nman, and the still more blessed face of Nature; and devoted themselves\r\nto painful research and intense reflection! And all for what? To occupy\r\nan inch of dusty shelf--to have the titles of their works read now and\r\nthen in a future age by some drowsy churchman or casual straggler like\r\nmyself, and in another age to be lost even to remembrance. Such is the\r\namount of this boasted immortality. A mere temporary rumor, a local\r\nsound; like the tone of that bell which has tolled among these towers,\r\nfilling the ear for a moment, lingering transiently in echo, and then\r\npassing away, like a thing that was not!\r\n\r\nWhile I sat half-murmuring, half-meditating, these unprofitable\r\nspeculations with my head resting on my hand, I was thrumming with the\r\nother hand upon the quarto, until I accidentally loosened the clasps;\r\nwhen, to my utter astonishment, the little book gave two or three yawns,\r\nlike one awaking from a deep sleep, then a husky hem, and at length\r\nbegan to talk. At first its voice was very hoarse and broken, being much\r\ntroubled by a cobweb which some studious spider had woven across it, and\r\nhaving probably contracted a cold from long exposure to the chills and\r\ndamps of the abbey. In a short time, however, it became more distinct,\r\nand I soon found it an exceedingly fluent, conversable little tome.\r\nIts language, to be sure, was rather quaint and obsolete, and its\r\npronunciation what, in the present day, would be deemed barbarous; but I\r\nshall endeavor, as far as I am able, to render it in modern parlance.\r\n\r\nIt began with railings about the neglect of the world, about merit being\r\nsuffered to languish in obscurity, and other such commonplace topics of\r\nliterary repining, and complained bitterly that it had not been opened\r\nfor more than two centuries--that the dean only looked now and then into\r\nthe library, sometimes took down a volume or two, trifled with them for\r\na few moments, and then returned them to their shelves. “What a plague\r\ndo they mean?” said the little quarto, which I began to perceive was\r\nsomewhat choleric--“what a plague do they mean by keeping several\r\nthousand volumes of us shut up here, and watched by a set of old\r\nvergers, like so many beauties in a harem, merely to be looked at now\r\nand then by the dean? Books were written to give pleasure and to be\r\nenjoyed; and I would have a rule passed that the dean should pay each of\r\nus a visit at least once a year; or, if he is not equal to the task, let\r\nthem once in a while turn loose the whole school of Westminster among\r\nus, that at any rate we may now and then have an airing.”\r\n\r\n“Softly, my worthy friend,” replied I; “you are not aware how much\r\nbetter you are off than most books of your generation. By being stored\r\naway in this ancient library you are like the treasured remains of those\r\nsaints and monarchs which lie enshrined in the adjoining chapels, while\r\nthe remains of their contemporary mortals, left to the ordinary course\r\nof Nature, have long since returned to dust.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the little tome, ruffling his leaves and looking big, “I\r\nwas written for all the world, not for the bookworms of an abbey. I was\r\nintended to circulate from hand to hand, like other great contemporary\r\nworks; but here have I been clasped up for more than two centuries, and\r\nmight have silently fallen a prey to these worms that are playing the\r\nvery vengeance with my intestines if you had not by chance given me an\r\nopportunity of uttering a few last words before I go to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” rejoined I, “had you been left to the circulation of\r\nwhich you speak, you would long ere this have been no more. To judge\r\nfrom your physiognomy, you are now well stricken in years: very few of\r\nyour contemporaries can be at present in existence, and those few owe\r\ntheir longevity to being immured like yourself in old libraries; which,\r\nsuffer me to add, instead of likening to harems, you might more properly\r\nand gratefully have compared to those infirmaries attached to religious\r\nestablishments for the benefit of the old and decrepit, and where, by\r\nquiet fostering and no employment, they often endure to an amazingly\r\ngood-for-nothing old age. You talk of your contemporaries as if in\r\ncirculation. Where do we meet with their works? What do we hear of\r\nRobert Grosteste of Lincoln? No one could have toiled harder than he for\r\nimmortality. He is said to have written nearly two hundred volumes. He\r\nbuilt, as it were, a pyramid of books to perpetuate his name: but,\r\nalas! the pyramid has long since fallen, and only a few fragments are\r\nscattered in various libraries, where they are scarcely disturbed\r\neven by the antiquarian. What do we hear of Giraldus Cambrensis, the\r\nhistorian, antiquary, philosopher, theologian, and poet? He declined two\r\nbishoprics that he might shut himself up and write for posterity; but\r\nposterity never inquires after his labors. What of Henry of Huntingdon,\r\nwho, besides a learned history of England, wrote a treatise on the\r\ncontempt of the world, which the world has revenged by forgetting him?\r\nWhat is quoted of Joseph of Exeter, styled the miracle of his age in\r\nclassical composition? Of his three great heroic poems, one is lost\r\nforever, excepting a mere fragment; the others are known only to a few\r\nof the curious in literature; and as to his love verses and epigrams,\r\nthey have entirely disappeared. What is in current use of John Wallis\r\nthe Franciscan, who acquired the name of the tree of life? Of William\r\nof Malmsbury--of Simeon of Durham--of Benedict of Peterborough--of John\r\nHanvill of St. Albans--of----”\r\n\r\n“Prithee, friend,” cried the quarto in a testy tone, “how old do you\r\nthink me? You are talking of authors that lived long before my time, and\r\nwrote either in Latin or French, so that they in a manner expatriated\r\nthemselves, and deserved to be forgotten;* but I, sir, was ushered into\r\nthe world from the press of the renowned Wynkyn de Worde. I was written\r\nin my own native tongue, at a time when the language had become fixed;\r\nand indeed I was considered a model of pure and elegant English.”\r\n\r\n(I should observe that these remarks were couched in such intolerably\r\nantiquated terms, that I have had infinite difficulty in rendering them\r\ninto modern phraseology.)\r\n\r\n“I cry you mercy,” said I, “for mistaking your age; but it matters\r\nlittle. Almost all the writers of your time have likewise passed into\r\nforgetfulness, and De Worde’s publications are mere literary rarities\r\namong book-collectors. The purity and stability of language, too, on\r\nwhich you found your claims to perpetuity, have been the fallacious\r\ndependence of authors of every age, even back to the times of the worthy\r\nRobert of Gloucester, who wrote his history in rhymes of mongrel Saxon.+\r\nEven now many talk of Spenser’s ‘well of pure English undefiled,’ as\r\nif the language ever sprang from a well or fountain-head, and was not\r\nrather a mere confluence of various tongues perpetually subject to\r\nchanges and intermixtures. It is this which has made English literature\r\nso extremely mutable, and the reputation built upon it so fleeting.\r\nUnless thought can be committed to something more permanent and\r\nunchangeable than such a medium, even thought must share the fate of\r\neverything else, and fall into decay. This should serve as a check\r\nupon the vanity and exultation of the most popular writer. He finds\r\nthe language in which he has embarked his fame gradually altering and\r\nsubject to the dilapidations of time and the caprice of fashion. He\r\nlooks back and beholds the early authors of his country, once the\r\nfavorites of their day, supplanted by modern writers. A few short ages\r\nhave covered them with obscurity, and their merits can only be relished\r\nby the quaint taste of the bookworm. And such, he anticipates, will be\r\nthe fate of his own work, which, however it may be admired in its day\r\nand held up as a model of purity, will in the course of years grow\r\nantiquated and obsolete, until it shall become almost as unintelligible\r\nin its native land as an Egyptian obelisk or one of those Runic\r\ninscriptions said to exist in the deserts of Tartary.” “I declare,” added\r\nI, with some emotion, “when I contemplate a modern library, filled\r\nwith new works in all the bravery of rich gilding and binding, I feel\r\ndisposed to sit down and weep, like the good Xerxes, when he surveyed\r\nhis army, pranked out in all the splendor of military array, and\r\nreflected that in one hundred years not one of them would be in\r\nexistence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “In Latin and French hath many soueraine wittes had great\r\n     delyte to endite, and have many noble thinges fulfilde, but\r\n     certes there ben some that speaken their poisye in French,\r\n     of which speche the Frenchmen have as good a fantasye as w\r\n     ave in hearying of Frenchmen’s Englishe.”--CHAUCER’S\r\n     Testament of Love.\r\n\r\n     + Holinshed in his Chronicle, observes, “Afterwards, also,\r\n     by diligent vell f Geffry Chaucer and John Gowre, in the\r\n     time of Richard the Second, and after them of John Scogan\r\n     and John Lydgate, monke of Berrie, our said toong was\r\n     brought to an excellent passe, notwithstanding that it never\r\n     came unto the type of perfection until the time of Queen\r\n     Elizabeth, wherein John Jewell, Bishop of Sarum, John Fox,\r\n     and sundrie learned and excellent writers, have fully\r\n     accomplished the ornature of the same to their great praise\r\n     and mortal commendation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the little quarto, with a heavy sigh, “I see how it is: these\r\nin modern scribblers have superseded all the good old authors. I suppose\r\nnothing is read nowadays but Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, Sackville’s\r\nstately plays and Mirror for Magistrates, or the fine-spun euphuisms of\r\nthe ‘unparalleled John Lyly.’”\r\n\r\n“There you are again mistaken,” said I; “the writers whom you suppose in\r\nvogue, because they happened to be so when you were last in circulation,\r\nhave long since had their day. Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, the\r\nimmortality of which was so fondly predicted by his admirers,* and\r\nwhich, in truth, was full of noble thoughts, delicate images, and\r\ngraceful turns of language, is now scarcely ever mentioned. Sackville\r\nhas strutted into obscurity; and even Lyly, though his writings were\r\nonce the delight of a court, and apparently perpetuated by a proverb, is\r\nnow scarcely known even by name. A whole crowd of authors who wrote and\r\nwrangled at the time, have likewise gone down with all their writings\r\nand their controversies. Wave after wave of succeeding literature has\r\nrolled over them, until they are buried so deep, that it is only now and\r\nthen that some industrious diver after fragments of antiquity brings up\r\na specimen for the gratification of the curious.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “Live ever sweete booke; the simple image of his gentle\r\n     witt, and the golden pillar of his noble courage; and ever\r\n     notify unto the world that thy writer was the secretary of\r\n     eloquence, the breath of the muses, the honey bee of the\r\n     daintyest flowers of witt and arte, the pith of morale and\r\n     intellectual virtues, the arme of Bellona in the field, the\r\n     tongue of Suada in the chamber, the spirits of Practise in\r\n     esse, and the paragon of excellence in print.”--Harvey\r\n     Pierce’s Supererogation.\r\n\r\n\r\n“For my part,” I continued, “I consider this mutability of language a\r\nwise precaution of Providence for the benefit of the world at large, and\r\nof authors in particular. To reason from analogy, we daily behold the\r\nvaried and beautiful tribes of vegetables springing up, flourishing,\r\nadorning the fields for a short time, and then fading into dust, to\r\nmake way for their successors. Were not this the case, the fecundity of\r\nnature would be a grievance instead of a blessing. The earth would groan\r\nwith rank and excessive vegetation, and its surface become a tangled\r\nwilderness. In like manner, the works of genius and learning decline and\r\nmake way for subsequent productions. Language gradually varies, and with\r\nit fade away the writings of authors who have flourished their allotted\r\ntime; otherwise the creative powers of genius would overstock the world,\r\nand the mind would be completely bewildered in the endless mazes of\r\nliterature. Formerly there were some restraints on this excessive\r\nmultiplication. Works had to be transcribed by hand, which was a slow\r\nand laborious operation; they were written either on parchment, which\r\nwas expensive, so that one work was often erased to make way for\r\nanother; or on papyrus, which was fragile and extremely perishable.\r\nAuthorship was a limited and unprofitable craft, pursued chiefly by\r\nmonks in the leisure and solitude of their cloisters. The accumulation\r\nof manuscripts was slow and costly, and confined almost entirely to\r\nmonasteries. To these circumstances it may, in some measure, be owing\r\nthat we have not been inundated by the intellect of antiquity--that the\r\nfountains of thought have not been broken up, and modern genius drowned\r\nin the deluge. But the inventions of paper and the press have put an end\r\nto all these restraints. They have made every one a writer, and enabled\r\nevery mind to pour itself into print, and diffuse itself over the\r\nwhole intellectual world. The consequences are alarming. The stream of\r\nliterature has swollen into a torrent--augmented into a river-expanded\r\ninto a sea. A few centuries since five or six hundred manuscripts\r\nconstituted a great library; but what would you say to libraries, such\r\nas actually exist, containing three or four hundred thousand volumes;\r\nlegions of authors at the same time busy; and the press going on with\r\nfearfully increasing activity, to double and quadruple the number?\r\nUnless some unforeseen mortality should break out among the progeny of\r\nthe Muse, now that she has become so prolific, I tremble for posterity.\r\nI fear the mere fluctuation of language will not be sufficient.\r\nCriticism may do much; it increases with the increase of literature,\r\nand resembles one of those salutary checks on population spoken of by\r\neconomists. All possible encouragement, therefore, should be given to\r\nthe growth of critics, good or bad. But I fear all will be in vain; let\r\ncriticism do what it may, writers will write, printers will print, and\r\nthe world will inevitably be overstocked with good books. It will soon\r\nbe the employment of a lifetime merely to learn their names. Many a man\r\nof passable information at the present day reads scarcely anything but\r\nreviews, and before long a man of erudition will be little better than a\r\nmere walking catalogue.”\r\n\r\n“My very good sir,” said the little quarto, yawning most drearily in my\r\nface, “excuse my interrupting you, but I perceive you are rather given\r\nto prose. I would ask the fate of an author who was making some noise\r\njust as I left the world. His reputation, however, was considered quite\r\ntemporary. The learned shook their heads at him, for he was a poor,\r\nhalf-educated varlet, that knew little of Latin, and nothing of Greek,\r\nand had been obliged to run the country for deer-stealing. I think his\r\nname was Shakespeare. I presume he soon sunk into oblivion.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said I, “it is owing to that very man that the\r\nliterature of his period has experienced a duration beyond the ordinary\r\nterm of English literature. There rise authors now and then who seem\r\nproof against the mutability of language because they have rooted\r\nthemselves in the unchanging principles of human nature. They are like\r\ngigantic trees that we sometimes see on the banks of a stream, which\r\nby their vast and deep roots, penetrating through the mere surface and\r\nlaying hold on the very foundations of the earth, preserve the soil\r\naround them from being swept away by the ever-flowing current, and hold\r\nup many a neighboring plant, and perhaps worthless weed, to perpetuity.\r\nSuch is the case with Shakespeare, whom we behold defying the\r\nencroachments of time, retaining in modern use the language and\r\nliterature of his day, and giving duration to many an indifferent\r\nauthor, merely from having flourished in his vicinity. But even he, I\r\ngrieve to say, is gradually assuming the tint of age, and his whole form\r\nis overrun by a profusion of commentators, who, like clambering vines\r\nand creepers, almost bury the noble plant that upholds them.”\r\n\r\nHere the little quarto began to heave his sides and chuckle, until at\r\nlength he broke out into a plethoric fit of laughter that had wellnigh\r\nchoked him by reason of his excessive corpulency. “Mighty well!” cried\r\nhe, as soon as he could recover breath, “mighty well! and so you would\r\npersuade me that the literature of an age is to be perpetuated by a\r\nvagabond deer-stealer! by a man without learning! by a poet! forsooth--a\r\npoet!” And here he wheezed forth another fit of laughter.\r\n\r\nI confess that I felt somewhat nettled at this rudeness, which, however,\r\nI pardoned on account of his having flourished in a less polished age. I\r\ndetermined, nevertheless, not to give up my point.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” resumed I positively, “a poet; for of all writers he has the best\r\nchance for immortality. Others may write from the head, but he writes\r\nfrom the heart, and the heart will always understand him. He is the\r\nfaithful portrayer of Nature, whose features are always the same and\r\nalways interesting. Prose writers are voluminous and unwieldy; their\r\npages crowded with commonplaces, and their thoughts expanded into\r\ntediousness. But with the true poet every thing is terse, touching, or\r\nbrilliant. He gives the choicest thoughts in the choicest language. He\r\nillustrates them by everything that he sees most striking in nature and\r\nart. He enriches them by pictures of human life, such as it is passing\r\nbefore him. His writings, therefore, contain the spirit, the aroma, if I\r\nmay use the phrase, of the age in which he lives. They are caskets which\r\ninclose within a small compass the wealth of the language--its family\r\njewels, which are thus transmitted in a portable form to posterity. The\r\nsetting may occasionally be antiquated, and require now and then to be\r\nrenewed, as in the case of Chaucer; but the brilliancy and intrinsic\r\nvalue of the gems continue unaltered. Cast a look back over the long\r\nreach of literary history. What vast valleys of dulness, filled with\r\nmonkish legends and academical controversies! What bogs of theological\r\nspeculations! What dreary wastes of metaphysics! Here and there only\r\ndo we behold the heaven-illumined bards, elevated like beacons on\r\ntheir widely-separated heights, to transmit the pure light of poetical\r\nintelligence from age to age.” *\r\n\r\nI was just about to launch forth into eulogiums upon the poets of the\r\nday when the sudden opening of the door caused me to turn my head. It\r\nwas the verger, who came to inform me that it was time to close the\r\nlibrary. I sought to have a parting word with the quarto, but the worthy\r\nlittle tome was silent; the clasps were closed: and it looked perfectly\r\nunconscious of all that had passed. I have been to the library two\r\nor three times since, and have endeavored to draw it into further\r\nconversation, but in vain; and whether all this rambling colloquy\r\nactually took place, or whether it was another of those old day-dreams\r\nto which I am subject, I have never, to this moment, been able to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Thorow earth and waters deepe,\r\n        The pen by skill doth passe:\r\n    And featly nyps the worldes abuse,\r\n        And shoes us in a glasse,\r\n    The vertu and the vice\r\n        Of every wight alyve;\r\n    The honey comb that bee doth make\r\n        Is not so sweet in hyve,\r\n    As are the golden leves\r\n        That drops from poet’s head!\r\n    Which doth surmount our common talke\r\n        As farre as dross doth lead.\r\n                                 Churchyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL FUNERALS.\r\n\r\n    Here’s a few flowers! but about midnight more:\r\n\r\n    The herbs that have oil them cold dew o’ the night\r\n    Are strewings fitt’st for graves----\r\n    You were as flowers now withered; even so\r\n    These herblets shall, which we upon you strow.\r\n                                            CYMBELINE.\r\n\r\nAMONG the beautiful and simple-hearted customs of rural life which still\r\nlinger in some parts of England are those of strewing flowers before the\r\nfunerals and planting them at the graves of departed friends. These, it\r\nis said, are the remains of some of the rites of the primitive Church;\r\nbut they are of still higher antiquity, having been observed among the\r\nGreeks and Romans, and frequently mentioned by their writers, and were\r\nno doubt the spontaneous tributes of unlettered affection, originating\r\nlong before art had tasked itself to modulate sorrow into song or story\r\nit on the monument. They are now only to be met with in the most distant\r\nand retired places of the kingdom, where fashion and innovation have not\r\nbeen able to throng in and trample out all the curious and interesting\r\ntraces of the olden time.\r\n\r\nIn Glamorganshire, we are told, the bed whereon the corpse lies is\r\ncovered with flowers, a custom alluded to in one of the wild and\r\nplaintive ditties of Ophelia:\r\n\r\n    White his shroud as the mountain snow,\r\n\r\n        Larded all with sweet flowers;\r\n    Which be-wept to the grave did go,\r\n        With true love showers.\r\n\r\nThere is also a most delicate and beautiful rite observed in some of\r\nthe remote villages of the south at the funeral of a female who has\r\ndied young and unmarried. A chaplet of white flowers is borne before\r\nthe corpse by a young girl nearest in age, size, and resemblance, and\r\nis afterwards hung up in the church over the accustomed seat of the\r\ndeceased. These chaplets are sometimes made of white paper, in imitation\r\nof flowers, and inside of them is generally a pair of white gloves. They\r\nare intended as emblems of the purity of the deceased, and the crown of\r\nglory which she has received in heaven.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, also, the dead are carried to the grave\r\nwith the singing of psalms and hymns--a kind of triumph, “to show,” says\r\nBourne, “that they have finished their course with joy, and are become\r\nconquerors.” This, I am informed, is observed in some of the northern\r\ncounties, particularly in Northumberland, and it has a pleasing, though\r\nmelancholy effect to hear of a still evening in some lonely country\r\nscene the mournful melody of a funeral dirge swelling from a distance,\r\nand to see the train slowly moving along the landscape.\r\n\r\n    Thus, thus, and thus, we compass round\r\n    Thy harmless and unhaunted ground,\r\n    And as we sing thy dirge, we will,\r\n                          The daffodill\r\n    And other flowers lay upon\r\n    The altar of our love, thy stone.\r\n                                      HERRICK.\r\n\r\nThere is also a solemn respect paid by the traveller to the passing\r\nfuneral in these sequestered places; for such spectacles, occurring\r\namong the quiet abodes of Nature, sink deep into the soul. As the\r\nmourning train approaches he pauses, uncovered, to let it go by; he then\r\nfollows silently in the rear; sometimes quite to the grave, at other\r\ntimes for a few hundred yards, and, having paid this tribute of respect\r\nto the deceased, turns and resumes his journey.\r\n\r\nThe rich vein of melancholy which runs through the English character,\r\nand gives it some of its most touching and ennobling graces, is finely\r\nevidenced in these pathetic customs, and in the solicitude shown by the\r\ncommon people for an honored and a peaceful grave. The humblest peasant,\r\nwhatever may be his lowly lot while living, is anxious that some little\r\nrespect may be paid to his remains. Sir Thomas Overbury, describing the\r\n“faire and happy milkmaid,” observes, “thus lives she, and all her care\r\nis, that she may die in the spring-time, to have store of flowers stucke\r\nupon her winding-sheet.” The poets, too, who always breathe the feeling\r\nof a nation, continually advert to this fond solicitude about the grave.\r\nIn The Maid’s Tragedy, by Beaumont and Fletcher, there is a beautiful\r\ninstance of the kind describing the capricious melancholy of a\r\nbroken-hearted girl:\r\n\r\n                        When she sees a bank\r\n    Stuck full of flowers, she, with a sigh, will tell\r\n    Her servants, what a pretty place it were\r\n    To bury lovers in; and made her maids\r\n    Bluck ‘em, and strew her over like a corse.\r\n\r\nThe custom of decorating graves was once universally prevalent: osiers\r\nwere carefully bent over them to keep the turf uninjured, and about\r\nthem were planted evergreens and flowers. “We adorn their graves,” says\r\nEvelyn, in his Sylva, “with flowers and redolent plants, just emblems\r\nof the life of man, which has been compared in Holy Scriptures to those\r\nfading beauties whose roots, being buried in dishonor, rise, again in\r\nglory.” This usage has now become extremely rare in England; but it\r\nmay still be met with in the churchyards of retired villages, among the\r\nWelsh mountains; and I recollect an instance of it at the small town of\r\nRuthven, which lies at the head of the beautiful vale of Clewyd. I have\r\nbeen told also by a friend, who was present at the funeral of a young\r\ngirl in Glamorganshire, that the female attendants had their aprons full\r\nof flowers, which, as soon as the body was interred, they stuck about\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nHe noticed several graves which had been decorated in the same manner.\r\nAs the flowers had been merely stuck in the ground, and not planted,\r\nthey had soon withered, and might be seen in various states of decay;\r\nsome drooping, others quite perished. They were afterwards to be\r\nsupplanted by holly, rosemary, and other evergreens, which on some\r\ngraves had grown to great luxuriance, and overshadowed the tombstones.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a melancholy fancifulness in the arrangement of these\r\nrustic offerings, that had something in it truly poetical. The rose\r\nwas sometimes blended with the lily, to form a general emblem of frail\r\nmortality. “This sweet flower,” said Evelyn, “borne on a branch set with\r\nthorns and accompanied with the lily, are natural hieroglyphics of our\r\nfugitive, umbratile, anxious, and transitory life, which, making so\r\nfair a show for a time, is not yet without its thorns and crosses.” The\r\nnature and color of the flowers, and of the ribbons with which they were\r\ntied, had often a particular reference to the qualities or story of the\r\ndeceased, or were expressive of the feelings of the mourner. In an\r\nold poem, entitled “Corydon’s Doleful Knell,” a lover specifies the\r\ndecorations he intends to use:\r\n\r\n    A garland shall be framed\r\n        By art and nature’s skill,\r\n    Of sundry-colored flowers,\r\n        In token of good-will.\r\n\r\n    And sundry-colored ribbons\r\n        On it I will bestow;\r\n    But chiefly blacke and yellowe\r\n        With her to grave shall go.\r\n\r\n    I’ll deck her tomb with flowers\r\n        The rarest ever seen;\r\n    And with my tears as showers\r\n        I’ll keep them fresh and green.\r\n\r\nThe white rose, we are told, was planted at the grave of a virgin; her\r\nchaplet was tied with white ribbons, in token of her spotless innocence,\r\nthough sometimes black ribbons were intermingled, to bespeak the grief\r\nof the survivors. The red rose was occasionally used, in remembrance of\r\nsuch as had been remarkable for benevolence; but roses in general were\r\nappropriated to the graves of lovers. Evelyn tells us that the custom\r\nwas not altogether extinct in his time, near his dwelling in the county\r\nof Surrey, “where the maidens yearly planted and decked the graves\r\nof their defunct sweethearts with rose-bushes.” And Camden likewise\r\nremarks, in his Britannia: “Here is also a certain custom, observed time\r\nout of mind, of planting rose-trees upon the graves, especially by the\r\nyoung men and maids who have lost their loves; so that this churchyard\r\nis now full of them.”\r\n\r\nWhen the deceased had been unhappy in their loves, emblems of a more\r\ngloomy character were used, such as the yew and cypress, and if flowers\r\nwere strewn, they were of the most melancholy colors. Thus, in poems by\r\nThomas Stanley, Esq. (published in 1651), is the following stanza:\r\n\r\n                  Yet strew\r\n    Upon my dismall grave\r\n    Such offerings as you have,\r\n        Forsaken cypresse and yewe;\r\n    For kinder flowers can take no birth\r\n    Or growth from such unhappy earth.\r\n\r\nIn The Maid’s Tragedy, a pathetic little air, is introduced,\r\nillustrative of this mode of decorating the funerals of females who had\r\nbeen disappointed in love:\r\n\r\n    Lay a garland on my hearse\r\n        Of the dismall yew,\r\n    Maidens, willow branches wear,\r\n        Say I died true.\r\n\r\n    My love was false, but I was firm,\r\n        From my hour of birth;\r\n    Upon my buried body lie\r\n        Lightly, gentle earth.\r\n\r\nThe natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and elevate\r\nthe mind; and we have a proof of it in the purity of sentiment and the\r\nunaffected elegance of thought which pervaded the whole of these\r\nfuneral observances. Thus it was an especial precaution that none but\r\nsweet-scented evergreens and flowers should be employed. The intention\r\nseems to have been to soften the horrors of the tomb, to beguile the\r\nmind from brooding over the disgraces of perishing mortality, and\r\nto associate the memory of the deceased with the most delicate and\r\nbeautiful objects in nature. There is a dismal process going on in the\r\ngrave, ere dust can return to its kindred dust, which the imagination\r\nshrinks from contemplating; and we seek still to think of the form\r\nwe have loved, with those refined associations which it awakened when\r\nblooming before us in youth and beauty. “Lay her i’ the earth,” says\r\nLaertes, of his virgin sister,\r\n\r\n    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh\r\n    May violets spring.\r\n\r\nHerrick, also, in his “Dirge of Jephtha,” pours forth a fragrant flow\r\nof poetical thought and image, which in a manner embalms the dead in the\r\nrecollections of the living.\r\n\r\n    Sleep in thy peace, thy bed of spice,\r\n    And make this place all Paradise:\r\n    May sweets grow here! and smoke from hence\r\n                          Fat frankincense.\r\n\r\n    Let balme and cassia send their scent\r\n    From out thy maiden monument.\r\n        *    *    *    *    *\r\n    May all shie maids at wonted hours\r\n    Come forth to strew thy tombe with flowers!\r\n    May virgins, when they come to mourn\r\n                         Male incense burn\r\n    Upon thine altar! then return\r\n    And leave thee sleeping in thy urn.\r\n\r\nI might crowd my pages with extracts from the older British poets, who\r\nwrote when these rites were more prevalent, and delighted frequently\r\nto allude to them; but I have already quoted more than is necessary. I\r\ncannot, however, refrain from giving a passage from Shakespeare, even\r\nthough it should appear trite, which illustrates the emblematical\r\nmeaning often conveyed in these floral tributes, and at the same time\r\npossesses that magic of language and appositeness of imagery for which\r\nhe stands pre-eminent.\r\n\r\n                           With fairest flowers,\r\n    Whilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,\r\n    I’ll sweeten thy sad grave; thou shalt not lack\r\n    The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose; nor\r\n    The azured harebell like thy veins; no, nor\r\n    The leaf of eglantine; whom not to slander,\r\n    Outsweetened not thy breath.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly something more affecting in these prompt and\r\nspontaneous offerings of Nature than in the most costly monuments of\r\nart; the hand strews the flower while the heart is warm, and the tear\r\nfalls on the grave as affection is binding the osier round the sod; but\r\npathos expires under the slow labor of the chisel, and is chilled among\r\nthe cold conceits of sculptured marble.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that a custom so truly elegant and\r\ntouching has disappeared from general use, and exists only in the most\r\nremote and insignificant villages. But it seems as if poetical custom\r\nalways shuns the walks of cultivated society. In proportion as people\r\ngrow polite they cease to be poetical. They talk of poetry, but they\r\nhave learnt to check its free impulses, to distrust its sallying\r\nemotions, and to supply its most affecting and picturesque usages by\r\nstudied form and pompous ceremonial. Few pageants can be more stately\r\nand frigid than an English funeral in town. It is made up of show and\r\ngloomy parade: mourning carriages, mourning horses, mourning plumes,\r\nand hireling mourners, who make a mockery of grief. “There is a grave\r\ndigged,” says Jeremy Taylor, “and a solemn mourning, and a great talk\r\nin the neighborhood, and when the daies are finished, they shall be, and\r\nthey shall be remembered no more.” The associate in the gay and crowded\r\ncity is soon forgotten; the hurrying succession of new intimates and new\r\npleasures effaces him from our minds, and the very scenes and circles in\r\nwhich he moved are incessantly fluctuating. But funerals in the country\r\nare solemnly impressive. The stroke of death makes a wider space in\r\nthe village circle, and is an awful event in the tranquil uniformity\r\nof rural life. The passing bell tolls its knell in every ear; it steals\r\nwith its pervading melancholy over hill and vale, and saddens all the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nThe fixed and unchanging features of the country also perpetuate\r\nthe memory of the friend with whom we once enjoyed them, who was the\r\ncompanion of our most retired walks, and gave animation to every lonely\r\nscene. His idea is associated with every charm of Nature; we hear his\r\nvoice in the echo which he once delighted to awaken; his spirit haunts\r\nthe grove which he once frequented; we think of him in the wild upland\r\nsolitude or amidst the pensive beauty of the valley. In the freshness of\r\njoyous morning we remember his beaming smiles and bounding gayety;\r\nand when sober evening returns with its gathering shadows and subduing\r\nquiet, we call to mind many a twilight hour of gentle talk and\r\nsweet-souled melancholy.\r\n\r\n    Each lonely place shall him restore,\r\n        For him the tear be duly shed;\r\n    Beloved till life can charm no more,\r\n        And mourn’d till pity’s self be dead.\r\n\r\nAnother cause that perpetuates the memory of the deceased in the country\r\nis that the grave is more immediately in sight of the survivors. They\r\npass it on their way to prayer; it meets their eyes when their hearts\r\nare softened by the exercises of devotion; they linger about it on\r\nthe Sabbath, when the mind is disengaged from worldly cares and most\r\ndisposed to turn aside from present pleasures and present loves and\r\nto sit down among the solemn mementos of the past. In North Wales the\r\npeasantry kneel and pray over the graves of their deceased friends\r\nfor several Sundays after the interment; and where the tender rite of\r\nstrewing and planting flowers is still practised, it is always renewed\r\non Easter, Whitsuntide, and other festivals, when the season brings\r\nthe companion of former festivity more vividly to mind. It is also\r\ninvariably performed by the nearest relatives and friends; no menials\r\nnor hirelings are employed, and if a neighbor yields assistance, it\r\nwould be deemed an insult to offer compensation.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon this beautiful rural custom, because as it is one of\r\nthe last, so is it one of the holiest, offices of love. The grave is\r\nthe ordeal of true affection. It is there that the divine passion of the\r\nsoul manifests its superiority to the instinctive impulse of mere animal\r\nattachment. The latter must be continually refreshed and kept alive by\r\nthe presence of its object, but the love that is seated in the soul can\r\nlive on long remembrance. The mere inclinations of sense languish and\r\ndecline with the charms which excited them, and turn with shuddering\r\ndisgust from the dismal precincts of the tomb; but it is thence that\r\ntruly spiritual affection rises, purified from every sensual desire, and\r\nreturns, like a holy flame, to illumine and sanctify the heart of the\r\nsurvivor.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be\r\ndivorced. Every other wound we seek to heal, every other affliction\r\nto forget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open, this\r\naffliction we cherish and brood over in solitude. Where is the mother\r\nwho would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom from\r\nher arms though every recollection is a pang? Where is the child that\r\nwould willingly forget the most tender of parents, though to remember be\r\nbut to lament? Who, even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend\r\nover whom he mourns? Who, even when the tomb is closing upon the remains\r\nof her he most loved, when he feels his heart, as it were, crushed in\r\nthe closing of its portal, would accept of consolation that must be\r\nbought by forgetfulness? No, the love which survives the tomb is one of\r\nthe noblest attributes of the soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise\r\nits delights; and when the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed\r\ninto the gentle tear of recollection, when the sudden anguish and the\r\nconvulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved is\r\nsoftened away into pensive meditation on all that it was in the days of\r\nits loveliness, who would root out such a sorrow from the heart? Though\r\nit may sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety,\r\nor spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom, yet who would\r\nexchange it even for the song of pleasure or the burst of revelry? No,\r\nthere is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song. There is a remembrance\r\nof the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the living. Oh,\r\nthe grave! the grave! It buries every error, covers every defect,\r\nextinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but\r\nfond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave\r\neven of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb that he should ever\r\nhave warred with the poor handful of earth that lies mouldering before\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nBut the grave of those we loved--what a place for meditation! There\r\nit is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue\r\nand gentleness, and the thousand endearments lavished upon us almost\r\nunheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell\r\nupon the tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness, of the parting\r\nscene. The bed of death, with all its stifled griefs--its noiseless\r\nattendance--its mute, watchful assiduities. The last testimonies\r\nof expiring love! The feeble, fluttering, thrilling--oh, how\r\nthrilling!--pressure of the hand! The faint, faltering accents,\r\nstruggling in death to give one more assurance of affection! The last\r\nfond look of the glazing eye, turning upon us even from the threshold of\r\nexistence!\r\n\r\nAy, go to the grave of buried love and meditate! There settle the\r\naccount with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited--every\r\npast endearment unregarded, of that departed being who can\r\nnever-never--never return to be soothed by thy contrition!\r\n\r\nIf thou art a child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul or a\r\nfurrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent; if thou art a\r\nhusband, and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole\r\nhappiness in thy arms to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth;\r\nif thou art a friend, and hast ever wronged, in thought or word or deed,\r\nthe spirit that generously confided in thee; if thou art a lover, and\r\nhast ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart which now lies\r\ncold and still beneath thy feet,--then be sure that every unkind look,\r\nevery ungracious word, every ungentle action will come thronging back\r\nupon thy memory and knocking dolefully at thy soul: then be sure that\r\nthou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave, and utter\r\nthe unheard groan and pour the unavailing tear, more deep, more bitter\r\nbecause unheard and unavailing.\r\n\r\nThen weave thy chaplet of flowers and strew the beauties of Nature about\r\nthe grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with these tender\r\nyet futile tributes of regret; but take warning by the bitterness of\r\nthis thy contrite affliction over the dead, and henceforth be more\r\nfaithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIn writing the preceding article it was not intended to give a full\r\ndetail of the funeral customs of the English peasantry, but merely to\r\nfurnish a few hints and quotations illustrative of particular rites, to\r\nbe appended, by way of note, to another paper, which has been withheld.\r\nThe article swelled insensibly into its present form, and this is\r\nmentioned as an apology for so brief and casual a notice of these usages\r\nafter they have been amply and learnedly investigated in other works.\r\n\r\nI must observe, also, that I am well aware that this custom of adorning\r\ngraves with flowers prevails in other countries besides England. Indeed,\r\nin some it is much more general, and is observed even by the rich and\r\nfashionable; but it is then apt to lose its simplicity and to degenerate\r\ninto affectation. Bright, in his travels in Lower Hungary, tells of\r\nmonuments of marble and recesses formed for retirement, with seats\r\nplaced among bowers of greenhouse plants, and that the graves generally\r\nare covered with the gayest flowers of the season. He gives a casual\r\npicture of filial piety which I cannot but transcribe; for I trust it is\r\nas useful as it is delightful to illustrate the amiable virtues of the\r\nsex. “When I was at Berlin,” says he, “I followed the celebrated Iffland\r\nto the grave. Mingled with some pomp you might trace much real feeling.\r\nIn the midst of the ceremony my attention was attracted by a young\r\nwoman who stood on a mound of earth newly covered with turf, which she\r\nanxiously protected from the feet of the passing crowd. It was the tomb\r\nof her parent; and the figure of this affectionate daughter presented a\r\nmonument more striking than the most costly work of art.”\r\n\r\nI will barely add an instance of sepulchral decoration that I once\r\nmet with among the mountains of Switzerland. It was at the village of\r\nGersau, which stands on the borders of the Lake of Lucerne, at the foot\r\nof Mount Rigi. It was once the capital of a miniature republic shut up\r\nbetween the Alps and the lake, and accessible on the land side only by\r\nfootpaths. The whole force of the republic did not exceed six hundred\r\nfighting men, and a few miles of circumference, scooped out as it were\r\nfrom the bosom of the mountains, comprised its territory. The village\r\nof Gersau seemed separated from the rest of the world, and retained\r\nthe golden simplicity of a purer age. It had a small church, with a\r\nburying-ground adjoining. At the heads of the graves were placed crosses\r\nof wood or iron. On some were affixed miniatures, rudely executed, but\r\nevidently attempts at likenesses of the deceased. On the crosses\r\nwere hung chaplets of flowers, some withering others fresh, as if\r\noccasionally renewed. I paused with interest at this scene: I felt\r\nthat I was at the source of poetical description, for these were the\r\nbeautiful but unaffected offerings of the heart which poets are fain to\r\nrecord. In a gayer and more populous place I should have suspected them\r\nto have been suggested by factitious sentiment derived from books; but\r\nthe good people of Gersau knew little of books; there was not a novel\r\nnor a love-poem in the village, and I question whether any peasant of\r\nthe place dreamt, while he was twining a fresh chaplet for the grave of\r\nhis mistress, that he was fulfilling one of the most fanciful rites of\r\npoetical devotion, and that he was practically a poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INN KITCHEN.\r\n\r\n     Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn?\r\n                                FALSTAFF.\r\n\r\nDURING a journey that I once made through the Netherlands, I had arrived\r\none evening at the Pomme d’Or, the principal inn of a small Flemish\r\nvillage. It was after the hour of the table d’hote, so that I was\r\nobliged to make a solitary supper from the relics of its ampler board.\r\nThe weather was chilly; I was seated alone in one end of a great gloomy\r\ndining-room, and, my repast being over, I had the prospect before me\r\nof a long dull evening, without any visible means of enlivening it. I\r\nsummoned mine host and requested something to read; he brought me the\r\nwhole literary stock of his household, a Dutch family Bible, an almanac\r\nin the same language, and a number of old Paris newspapers. As I sat\r\ndozing over one of the latter, reading old news and stale criticisms,\r\nmy ear was now and then struck with bursts of laughter which seemed to\r\nproceed from the kitchen. Every one that has travelled on the Continent\r\nmust know how favorite a resort the kitchen of a country inn is to the\r\nmiddle and inferior order of travellers, particularly in that equivocal\r\nkind of weather when a fire becomes agreeable toward evening. I threw\r\naside the newspaper and explored my way to the kitchen, to take a peep\r\nat the group that appeared to be so merry. It was composed partly of\r\ntravellers who had arrived some hours before in a diligence, and partly\r\nof the usual attendants and hangers-on of inns. They were seated round\r\na great burnished stove, that might have been mistaken for an altar at\r\nwhich they were worshipping. It was covered with various kitchen vessels\r\nof resplendent brightness, among which steamed and hissed a huge copper\r\ntea-kettle. A large lamp threw a strong mass of light upon the group,\r\nbringing out many odd features in strong relief. Its yellow rays\r\npartially illumined the spacious kitchen, dying duskily away into remote\r\ncorners, except where they settled in mellow radiance on the broad side\r\nof a flitch of bacon or were reflected back from well-scoured utensils\r\nthat gleamed from the midst of obscurity. A strapping Flemish lass,\r\nwith long golden pendants in her ears and a necklace with a golden heart\r\nsuspended to it, was the presiding priestess of the temple.\r\n\r\nMany of the company were furnished with pipes, and most of them with\r\nsome kind of evening potation. I found their mirth was occasioned by\r\nanecdotes which a little swarthy Frenchman, with a dry weazen face and\r\nlarge whiskers, was giving of his love-adventures; at the end of each of\r\nwhich there was one of those bursts of honest unceremonious laughter in\r\nwhich a man indulges in that temple of true liberty, an inn.\r\n\r\nAs I had no better mode of getting through a tedious blustering evening,\r\nI took my seat near the stove, and listened to a variety of travellers’\r\ntales, some very extravagant and most very dull. All of them, however,\r\nhave faded from my treacherous memory except one, which I will endeavor\r\nto relate. I fear, however, it derived its chief zest from the manner in\r\nwhich it was told, and the peculiar air and appearance of the narrator.\r\nHe was a corpulent old Swiss, who had the look of a veteran traveller.\r\nHe was dressed in a tarnished green travelling-jacket, with a broad belt\r\nround his waist, and a pair of overalls with buttons from the hips to\r\nthe ankles. He was of a full rubicund countenance, with a double chin,\r\naquiline nose, and a pleasant twinkling eye. His hair was light, and\r\ncurled from under an old green velvet travelling-cap stuck on one side\r\nof his head. He was interrupted more than once by the arrival of guests\r\nor the remarks of his auditors, and paused now and then to replenish his\r\npipe; at which times he had generally a roguish leer and a sly joke for\r\nthe buxom kitchen-maid.\r\n\r\nI wish my readers could imagine the old fellow lolling in a huge\r\narm-chair, one arm a-kimbo, the other holding a curiously twisted\r\ntobacco-pipe formed of genuine ecume de mer, decorated with silver chain\r\nand silken tassel, his head cocked on one side, and a whimsical cut of\r\nthe eye occasionally as he related the following story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRE BRIDEGROOM.\r\n\r\nA TRAVELLER’S TALE.*\r\n\r\n    He that supper for is dight,\r\n    He lyes full cold, I trow, this night!\r\n    Yestreen to chamber I him led,\r\n    This night Gray-steel has made his bed!\r\n   SIR EGER, SIR GRAHAME, and SIR GRAY-STEEL.\r\n\r\nON the summit of one of the heights of the Odenwald, a wild and romantic\r\ntract of Upper Germany that lies not far from the confluence of the\r\nMain and the Rhine, there stood many, many years since the castle of the\r\nBaron Von Landshort. It is now quite fallen to decay, and almost\r\nburied among beech trees and dark firs; above which, however, its old\r\nwatch-tower may still be seen struggling, like the former possessor I\r\nhave mentioned, to carry a high head and look down upon the neighboring\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe baron was a dry branch of the great family of Katzenellenbogen,+\r\nand inherited the relics of the property and all the pride, of his\r\nancestors. Though the warlike disposition of his predecessors had much\r\nimpaired the family possessions, yet the baron still endeavored to keep\r\nup some show of former state. The times were peaceable, and the German\r\nnobles in general had abandoned their inconvenient old castles, perched\r\nlike eagles’ nests among the mountains, and had built more convenient\r\nresidences in the valleys; still, the baron remained proudly drawn up in\r\nhis little fortress, cherishing with hereditary inveteracy all the\r\nold family feuds, so that he was on ill terms with some of his nearest\r\nneighbors, on account of disputes that had happened between their\r\ngreat-great-grandfathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The erudite reader, well versed in good-for-nothing lore,\r\n     will perceive that the above Tale must have been suggested\r\n     to the old Swiss by a little French anecdote, a circumstance\r\n     said to have taken place in Paris.\r\n\r\n     + I.e., CAT’S ELBOW--the name of a family of those parts,\r\n     and very powerful in former times. The appellation, we are\r\n     told, was given in compliment to a peerless dame of the\r\n     family, celebrated for a fine arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baron had but one child, a daughter, but Nature, when she grants but\r\none child, always compensates by making it a prodigy; and so it was with\r\nthe daughter of the baron. All the nurses, gossips, and country cousins\r\nassured her father that she had not her equal for beauty in all Germany;\r\nand who should know better than they? She had, moreover, been brought up\r\nwith great care under the superintendence of two maiden aunts, who had\r\nspent some years of their early life at one of the little German courts,\r\nand were skilled in all branches of knowledge necessary to the education\r\nof a fine lady. Under their instructions she became a miracle of\r\naccomplishments. By the time she was eighteen she could embroider to\r\nadmiration, and had worked whole histories of the saints in tapestry\r\nwith such strength of expression in their countenances that they\r\nlooked like so many souls in purgatory. She could read without great\r\ndifficulty, and had spelled her way through several Church legends and\r\nalmost all the chivalric wonders of the Heldenbuch. She had even made\r\nconsiderable proficiency in writing; could sign her own name without\r\nmissing a letter, and so legibly that her aunts could read it without\r\nspectacles. She excelled in making little elegant good-for-nothing,\r\nlady-like knicknacks of all kinds, was versed in the most abstruse\r\ndancing of the day, played a number of airs on the harp and guitar, and\r\nknew all the tender ballads of the Minnelieders by heart.\r\n\r\nHer aunts, too, having been great flirts and coquettes in their younger\r\ndays, were admirably calculated to be vigilant guardians and strict\r\ncensors of the conduct of their niece; for there is no duenna so rigidly\r\nprudent and inexorably decorous as a superannuated coquette. She was\r\nrarely suffered out of their sight; never went beyond the domains of\r\nthe castle unless well attended, or rather well watched; had continual\r\nlectures read to her about strict decorum and implicit obedience; and,\r\nas to the men--pah!--she was taught to hold them at such a distance and\r\nin such absolute distrust that, unless properly authorized, she would\r\nnot have cast a glance upon the handsomest cavalier in the world--no,\r\nnot if he were even dying at her feet.\r\n\r\nThe good effects of this system were wonderfully apparent. The young\r\nlady was a pattern of docility and correctness. While others were\r\nwasting their sweetness in the glare of the world, and liable to be\r\nplucked and thrown aside by every hand, she was coyly blooming into\r\nfresh and lovely womanhood under the protection of those immaculate\r\nspinsters, like a rosebud blushing forth among guardian thorns. Her\r\naunts looked upon her with pride and exultation, and vaunted that,\r\nthough all the other young ladies in the world might go astray, yet\r\nthank Heaven, nothing of the kind could happen to the heiress of\r\nKatzenellenbogen.\r\n\r\nBut, however scantily the Baron Von Landshort might be provided with\r\nchildren, his household was by no means a small one; for Providence\r\nhad enriched him with abundance of poor relations. They, one and all,\r\npossessed the affectionate disposition common to humble relatives--were\r\nwonderfully attached to the baron, and took every possible occasion\r\nto come in swarms and enliven the castle. All family festivals were\r\ncommemorated by these good people at the baron’s expense; and when they\r\nwere filled with good cheer they would declare that there was nothing\r\non earth so delightful as these family meetings, these jubilees of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe baron, though a small man, had a large soul, and it swelled with\r\nsatisfaction at the consciousness of being the greatest man in the\r\nlittle world about him. He loved to tell long stories about the stark\r\nold warriors whose portraits looked grimly down from the walls around,\r\nand he found no listeners equal to those who fed at his expense. He\r\nwas much given to the marvellous and a firm believer in all those\r\nsupernatural tales with which every mountain and valley in Germany\r\nabounds. The faith of his guests exceeded even his own: they listened\r\nto every tale of wonder with open eyes and mouth, and never failed to be\r\nastonished, even though repeated for the hundredth time. Thus lived the\r\nBaron Von Landshort, the oracle of his table, the absolute monarch of\r\nhis little territory, and happy, above all things, in the persuasion\r\nthat he was the wisest man of the age.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which my story treats there was a great family gathering\r\nat the castle on an affair of the utmost importance: it was to receive\r\nthe destined bridegroom of the baron’s daughter. A negotiation had been\r\ncarried on between the father and an old nobleman of Bavaria to unite\r\nthe dignity of their houses by the marriage of their children. The\r\npreliminaries had been conducted with proper punctilio. The young people\r\nwere betrothed without seeing each other, and the time was appointed for\r\nthe marriage ceremony. The young Count Von Altenburg had been recalled\r\nfrom the army for the purpose, and was actually on his way to the\r\nbaron’s to receive his bride. Missives had even been received from him\r\nfrom Wurtzburg, where he was accidentally detained, mentioning the day\r\nand hour when he might be expected to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe castle was in a tumult of preparation to give him a suitable\r\nwelcome. The fair bride had been decked out with uncommon care. The two\r\naunts had superintended her toilet, and quarrelled the whole morning\r\nabout every article of her dress. The young lady had taken advantage of\r\ntheir contest to follow the bent of her own taste; and fortunately\r\nit was a good one. She looked as lovely as youthful bridegroom could\r\ndesire, and the flutter of expectation heightened the lustre of her\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\nThe suffusions that mantled her face and neck, the gentle heaving of\r\nthe bosom, the eye now and then lost in reverie, all betrayed the soft\r\ntumult that was going on in her little heart. The aunts were continually\r\nhovering around her, for maiden aunts are apt to take great interest in\r\naffairs of this nature. They were giving her a world of staid counsel\r\nhow to deport herself, what to say, and in what manner to receive the\r\nexpected lover.\r\n\r\nThe baron was no less busied in preparations. He had, in truth, nothing\r\nexactly to do; but he was naturally a fuming, bustling little man, and\r\ncould not remain passive when all the world was in a hurry. He worried\r\nfrom top to bottom of the castle with an air of infinite anxiety; he\r\ncontinually called the servants from their work to exhort them to be\r\ndiligent; and buzzed about every hall and chamber, as idly restless and\r\nimportunate as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer’s day.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the fatted calf had been killed; the forests had rung\r\nwith the clamor of the huntsmen; the kitchen was crowded with good\r\ncheer; the cellars had yielded up whole oceans of Rhein-wein and\r\nFerre-wein; and even the great Heidelberg tun had been laid under\r\ncontribution. Everything was ready to receive the distinguished guest\r\nwith Saus und Braus in the true spirit of German hospitality; but the\r\nguest delayed to make his appearance. Hour rolled after hour. The sun,\r\nthat had poured his downward rays upon the rich forest of the Odenwald,\r\nnow just gleamed along the summits of the mountains. The baron mounted\r\nthe highest tower and strained his eyes in hopes of catching a distant\r\nsight of the count and his attendants. Once he thought he beheld them;\r\nthe sound of horns came floating from the valley, prolonged by the\r\nmountain-echoes. A number of horsemen were seen far below slowly\r\nadvancing along the road; but when they had nearly reached the foot of\r\nthe mountain they suddenly struck off in a different direction. The last\r\nray of sunshine departed, the bats began to flit by in the twilight, the\r\nroad grew dimmer and dimmer to the view, and nothing appeared stirring\r\nin it but now and then a peasant lagging homeward from his labor.\r\n\r\nWhile the old castle of Landshort was in this state of perplexity a very\r\ninteresting scene was transacting in a different part of the Odenwald.\r\n\r\nThe young Count Von Altenburg was tranquilly pursuing his route in that\r\nsober jog-trot way in which a man travels toward matrimony when his\r\nfriends have taken all the trouble and uncertainty of courtship off his\r\nhands and a bride is waiting for him as certainly as a dinner at the\r\nend of his journey. He had encountered at Wurtzburg a youthful\r\ncompanion-in-arms with whom he had seen some service on the\r\nfrontiers--Herman Von Starkenfaust, one of the stoutest hands and\r\nworthiest hearts of German chivalry--who was now returning from the\r\narmy. His father’s castle was not far distant from the old fortress of\r\nLandshort, although an hereditary feud rendered the families hostile and\r\nstrangers to each other.\r\n\r\nIn the warm-hearted moment of recognition the young friends related all\r\ntheir past adventures and fortunes, and the count gave the whole history\r\nof his intended nuptials with a young lady whom he had never seen, but\r\nof whose charms he had received the most enrapturing descriptions.\r\n\r\nAs the route of the friends lay in the same direction, they agreed to\r\nperform the rest of their journey together, and that they might do it\r\nthe more leisurely, set off from Wurtzburg at an early hour, the count\r\nhaving given directions for his retinue to follow and overtake him.\r\n\r\nThey beguiled their wayfaring with recollections of their military\r\nscenes and adventures; but the count was apt to be a little tedious now\r\nand then about the reputed charms of his bride and the felicity that\r\nawaited him.\r\n\r\nIn this way they had entered among the mountains of the Odenwald, and\r\nwere traversing one of its most lonely and thickly wooded passes. It is\r\nwell known that the forests of Germany have always been as much infested\r\nby robbers as its castles by spectres; and at this time the former were\r\nparticularly numerous, from the hordes of disbanded soldiers wandering\r\nabout the country. It will not appear extraordinary, therefore, that the\r\ncavaliers were attacked by a gang of these stragglers, in the midst\r\nof the forest. They defended themselves with bravery, but were nearly\r\noverpowered when the count’s retinue arrived to their assistance. At\r\nsight of them the robbers fled, but not until the count had received a\r\nmortal wound. He was slowly and carefully conveyed back to the city\r\nof Wurtzburg, and a friar summoned from a neighboring convent who was\r\nfamous for his skill in administering to both soul and body; but half\r\nof his skill was superfluous; the moments of the unfortunate count were\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\nWith his dying breath he entreated his friend to repair instantly to the\r\ncastle of Landshort and explain the fatal cause of his not keeping his\r\nappointment with his bride. Though not the most ardent of lovers, he was\r\none of the most punctilious of men, and appeared earnestly solicitous\r\nthat his mission should be speedily and courteously executed. “Unless\r\nthis is done,” said he, “I shall not sleep quietly in my grave.” He\r\nrepeated these last words with peculiar solemnity. A request at a moment\r\nso impressive admitted no hesitation. Starkenfaust endeavored to soothe\r\nhim to calmness, promised faithfully to execute his wish, and gave him\r\nhis hand in solemn pledge. The dying man pressed it in acknowledgment,\r\nbut soon lapsed into delirium--raved about his bride, his engagements,\r\nhis plighted word--ordered his horse, that he might ride to the castle\r\nof Landshort, and expired in the fancied act of vaulting into the\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\nStarkenfaust bestowed a sigh and a soldier’s tear on the untimely\r\nfate of his comrade and then pondered on the awkward mission he had\r\nundertaken. His heart was heavy and his head perplexed; for he was to\r\npresent himself an unbidden guest among hostile people, and to damp\r\ntheir festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes. Still, there were\r\ncertain whisperings of curiosity in his bosom to see this far-famed\r\nbeauty of Katzenellenbogen, so cautiously shut up from the world; for\r\nhe was a passionate admirer of the sex, and there was a dash of\r\neccentricity and enterprise in his character that made him fond of all\r\nsingular adventure.\r\n\r\nPrevious to his departure he made all due arrangements with the holy\r\nfraternity of the convent for the funeral solemnities of his friend,\r\nwho was to be buried in the cathedral of Wurtzburg near some of his\r\nillustrious relatives, and the mourning retinue of the count took charge\r\nof his remains.\r\n\r\nIt is now high time that we should return to the ancient family of\r\nKatzenellenbogen, who were impatient for their guest, and still more\r\nfor their dinner, and to the worthy little baron, whom we left airing\r\nhimself on the watch-tower.\r\n\r\nNight closed in, but still no guest arrived. The baron descended from\r\nthe tower in despair. The banquet, which had been delayed from hour to\r\nhour, could no longer be postponed. The meats were already overdone, the\r\ncook in an agony, and the whole household had the look of a garrison,\r\nthat had been reduced by famine. The baron was obliged reluctantly to\r\ngive orders for the feast without the presence of the guest. All were\r\nseated at table, and just on the point of commencing, when the sound of\r\na horn from without the gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger.\r\nAnother long blast filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes,\r\nand was answered by the warder from the walls. The baron hastened to\r\nreceive his future son-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe drawbridge had been let down, and the stranger was before the\r\ngate. He was a tall gallant cavalier, mounted on a black steed. His\r\ncountenance was pale, but he had a beaming, romantic eye and an air of\r\nstately melancholy. The baron was a little mortified that he should\r\nhave come in this simple, solitary style. His dignity for a moment was\r\nruffled, and he felt disposed to consider it a want of proper respect\r\nfor the important occasion and the important family with which he was to\r\nbe connected. He pacified himself, however, with the conclusion that it\r\nmust have been youthful impatience which had induced him thus to spur on\r\nsooner than his attendants.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” said the stranger, “to break in upon you thus\r\nunseasonably----”\r\n\r\nHere the baron interrupted him with a world of compliments and\r\ngreetings, for, to tell the truth, he prided himself upon his courtesy\r\nand eloquence. The stranger attempted once or twice to stem the torrent\r\nof words, but in vain, so he bowed his head and suffered it to flow on.\r\nBy the time the baron had come to a pause they had reached the inner\r\ncourt of the castle, and the stranger was again about to speak, when he\r\nwas once more interrupted by the appearance of the female part of the\r\nfamily, leading forth the shrinking and blushing bride. He gazed on her\r\nfor a moment as one entranced; it seemed as if his whole soul beamed\r\nforth in the gaze and rested upon that lovely form. One of the maiden\r\naunts whispered something in her ear; she made an effort to speak; her\r\nmoist blue eye was timidly raised, gave a shy glance of inquiry on the\r\nstranger, and was cast again to the ground. The words died away, but\r\nthere was a sweet smile playing about her lips, and a soft dimpling of\r\nthe cheek that showed her glance had not been unsatisfactory. It was\r\nimpossible for a girl of the fond age of eighteen, highly predisposed\r\nfor love and matrimony, not to be pleased with so gallant a cavalier.\r\n\r\nThe late hour at which the guest had arrived left no time for parley.\r\nThe baron was peremptory, and deferred all particular conversation until\r\nthe morning, and led the way to the untasted banquet.\r\n\r\nIt was served up in the great hall of the castle. Around the walls\r\nhung the hard-favored portraits of the heroes of the house of\r\nKatzenellenbogen, and the trophies which they had gained in the field,\r\nand in the chase. Hacked corselets, splintered jousting-spears, and\r\ntattered banners were mingled with the spoils of sylvan warfare: the\r\njaws of the wolf and the tusks of the boar grinned horribly among\r\ncrossbows and battle-axes, and a huge pair of antlers branched\r\nimmediately over the head of the youthful bridegroom.\r\n\r\nThe cavalier took but little notice of the company or the entertainment.\r\nHe scarcely tasted the banquet, but seemed absorbed in admiration of his\r\nbride. He conversed in a low tone that could not be overheard, for the\r\nlanguage of love is never loud; but where is the female ear so dull that\r\nit cannot catch the softest whisper of the lover? There was a mingled\r\ntenderness and gravity in his manner that appeared to have a powerful\r\neffect upon the young lady. Her color came and went as she listened with\r\ndeep attention. Now and then she made some blushing reply, and when his\r\neye was turned away she would steal a sidelong glance at his romantic\r\ncountenance, and heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness. It was evident\r\nthat the young couple were completely enamored. The aunts, who were\r\ndeeply versed in the mysteries of the heart, declared that they had\r\nfallen in love with each other at first sight.\r\n\r\nThe feast went on merrily, or at least noisily, for the guests were\r\nall blessed with those keen appetites that attend upon light purses and\r\nmountain air. The baron told his best and longest stories, and never had\r\nhe told them so well or with such great effect. If there was anything\r\nmarvellous, his auditors were lost in astonishment; and if anything\r\nfacetious, they were sure to laugh exactly in the right place. The\r\nbaron, it is true, like most great men, was too dignified to utter any\r\njoke but a dull one; it was always enforced, however, by a bumper of\r\nexcellent Hockheimer, and even a dull joke at one’s own table, served\r\nup with jolly old wine, is irresistible. Many good things were said by\r\npoorer and keener wits that would not bear repeating, except on similar\r\noccasions; many sly speeches whispered in ladies’ ears that almost\r\nconvulsed them with suppressed laughter; and a song or two roared out\r\nby a poor but merry and broad-faced cousin of the baron that absolutely\r\nmade the maiden aunts hold up their fans.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this revelry the stranger guest maintained a most singular\r\nand unseasonable gravity. His countenance assumed a deeper cast of\r\ndejection as the evening advanced, and, strange as it may appear, even\r\nthe baron’s jokes seemed only to render him the more melancholy. At\r\ntimes he was lost in thought, and at times there was a perturbed and\r\nrestless wandering of the eye that bespoke a mind but ill at ease.\r\nHis conversations with the bride became more and more earnest and\r\nmysterious. Lowering clouds began to steal over the fair serenity of her\r\nbrow, and tremors to run through her tender frame.\r\n\r\nAll this could not escape the notice of the company. Their gayety was\r\nchilled by the unaccountable gloom of the bridegroom; their spirits were\r\ninfected; whispers and glances were interchanged, accompanied by shrugs\r\nand dubious shakes of the head. The song and the laugh grew less and\r\nless frequent: there were dreary pauses in the conversation, which were\r\nat length succeeded by wild tales and supernatural legends. One\r\ndismal story produced another still more dismal, and the baron nearly\r\nfrightened some of the ladies into hysterics with the history of the\r\ngoblin horseman that carried away the fair Leonora--a dreadful story\r\nwhich has since been put into excellent verse, and is read and believed\r\nby all the world.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom listened to this tale with profound attention. He kept\r\nhis eyes steadily fixed on the baron, and, as the story drew to a close,\r\nbegan gradually to rise from his seat, growing taller and taller, until\r\nin the baron’s entranced eye he seemed almost to tower into a giant.\r\nThe moment the tale was finished he heaved a deep sigh and took a\r\nsolemn farewell of the company. They were all amazement. The baron was\r\nperfectly thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n“What! going to leave the castle at midnight? Why, everything was\r\nprepared for his reception; a chamber was ready for him if he wished to\r\nretire.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger shook his head mournfully and mysteriously: “I must lay my\r\nhead in a different chamber to-night.”\r\n\r\nThere was something in this reply and the tone in which it was uttered\r\nthat made the baron’s heart misgive him; but he rallied his forces and\r\nrepeated his hospitable entreaties.\r\n\r\nThe stranger shook his head silently, but positively, at every offer,\r\nand, waving his farewell to the company, stalked slowly out of the hall.\r\nThe maiden aunts were absolutely petrified; the bride hung her head and\r\na tear stole to her eye.\r\n\r\nThe baron followed the stranger to the great court of the castle, where\r\nthe black charger stood pawing the earth and snorting with impatience.\r\nWhen they had reached the portal, whose deep archway was dimly lighted\r\nby a cresset, the stranger paused, and addressed the baron in a hollow\r\ntone of voice, which the vaulted roof rendered still more sepulchral.\r\n\r\n“Now that we are a lone,” said he, “I will impart to you the reason of\r\nmy going. I have a solemn, an indispensable engagement----”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the baron, “cannot you send some one in your place?”\r\n\r\n“It admits of no substitute--I must attend it in person; I must away to\r\nWurtzburg cathedral----”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said the baron, plucking up spirit, “but not until\r\nto-morrow--to-morrow you shall take your bride there.”\r\n\r\n“No! no!” replied the stranger, with tenfold solemnity, “my engagement\r\nis with no bride--the worms! the worms expect me! I am a dead man--I\r\nhave been slain by robbers--my body lies at Wurtzburg--at midnight I am\r\nto be buried--the grave is waiting for me--I must keep my appointment!”\r\n\r\nHe sprang on his black charger, dashed over the drawbridge, and the\r\nclattering of his horse’s hoofs was lost in the whistling of the night\r\nblast.\r\n\r\nThe baron returned to the hall in the utmost consternation, and related\r\nwhat had passed. Two ladies fainted outright, others sickened at the\r\nidea of having banqueted with a spectre. It was the opinion of some that\r\nthis might be the wild huntsman, famous in German legend. Some talked of\r\nmountain-sprites, of wood-demons, and of other supernatural beings with\r\nwhich the good people of Germany have been so grievously harassed since\r\ntime immemorial. One of the poor relations ventured to suggest that it\r\nmight be some sportive evasion of the young cavalier, and that the\r\nvery gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with so melancholy a\r\npersonage. This, however, drew on him, the indignation of the whole\r\ncompany, and especially of the baron, who looked upon him as little\r\nbetter than an infidel; so that he was fain to abjure his heresy as\r\nspeedily as possible and come into the faith of the true believers.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may have been the doubts entertained, they were completely\r\nput to an end by the arrival next day of regular missives confirming the\r\nintelligence of the young count’s murder and his interment in Wurtzburg\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nThe dismay at the castle may well be imagined. The baron shut himself up\r\nin his chamber. The guests, who had come to rejoice with him, could not\r\nthink of abandoning him in his distress. They wandered about the courts\r\nor collected in groups in the hall, shaking their heads and shrugging\r\ntheir shoulders at the troubles of so good a man, and sat longer than\r\never at table, and ate and drank more stoutly than ever, by way of\r\nkeeping up their spirits. But the situation of the widowed bride was\r\nthe most pitiable. To have lost a husband before she had even embraced\r\nhim--and such a husband! If the very spectre could be so gracious and\r\nnoble, what must have been the living man? She filled the house with\r\nlamentations.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the second day of her widowhood she had retired to her\r\nchamber, accompanied by one of her aunts, who insisted on sleeping with\r\nher. The aunt, who was one of the best tellers of ghost-stories in all\r\nGermany, had just been recounting one of her longest, and had fallen\r\nasleep in the very midst of it. The chamber was remote and overlooked a\r\nsmall garden. The niece lay pensively gazing at the beams of the rising\r\nmoon as they trembled on the leaves of an aspen tree before the lattice.\r\nThe castle clock had just tolled midnight when a soft strain of music\r\nstole up from the garden. She rose hastily from her bed and stepped\r\nlightly to the window. A tall figure stood among the shadows of\r\nthe trees. As it raised its head a beam of moonlight fell upon the\r\ncountenance. Heaven and earth! she beheld the Spectre Bridegroom! A loud\r\nshriek at that moment burst upon her ear, and her aunt, who had been\r\nawakened by the music and had followed her silently to the window, fell\r\ninto her arms. When she looked again the spectre had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf the two females, the aunt now required the most soothing, for she was\r\nperfectly beside herself with terror. As to the young lady, there was\r\nsomething even in the spectre of her lover that seemed endearing. There\r\nwas still the semblance of manly beauty, and, though the shadow of a man\r\nis but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a lovesick girl,\r\nyet where the substance is not to be had even that is consoling. The\r\naunt declared she would never sleep in that chamber again; the niece,\r\nfor once, was refractory, and declared as strongly that she would sleep\r\nin no other in the castle: the consequence was, that she had to sleep in\r\nit alone; but she drew a promise from her aunt not to relate the story\r\nof the spectre, lest she should be denied the only melancholy pleasure\r\nleft her on earth--that of inhabiting the chamber over which the\r\nguardian shade of her lover kept its nightly vigils.\r\n\r\nHow long the good old lady would have observed this promise is\r\nuncertain, for she dearly loved to talk of the marvellous, and there is\r\na triumph in being the first to tell a frightful story; it is, however,\r\nstill quoted in the neighborhood as a memorable instance of female\r\nsecrecy that she kept it to herself for a whole week, when she was\r\nsuddenly absolved from all further restraint by intelligence brought to\r\nthe breakfast-table one morning that the young lady was not to be found.\r\nHer room was empty--the bed had not been slept in--the window was open\r\nand the bird had flown!\r\n\r\nThe astonishment and concern with which the intelligence was received\r\ncan only be imagined by those who have witnessed the agitation which the\r\nmishaps of a great man cause among his friends. Even the poor relations\r\npaused for a moment from the indefatigable labors of the trencher, when\r\nthe aunt, who had at first been struck speechless, wrung her hands\r\nand shrieked out, “The goblin! the goblin! she’s carried away by the\r\ngoblin!”\r\n\r\nIn a few words she related the fearful scene of the garden, and\r\nconcluded that the spectre must have carried off his bride. Two of the\r\ndomestics corroborated the opinion, for they had heard the clattering of\r\na horse’s hoofs down the mountain about midnight, and had no doubt that\r\nit was the spectre on his black charger bearing her away to the tomb.\r\nAll present were struck with the direful probability for events of\r\nthe kind are extremely common in Germany, as many well-authenticated\r\nhistories bear witness.\r\n\r\nWhat a lamentable situation was that of the poor baron! What a\r\nheartrending dilemma for a fond father and a member of the great family\r\nof Katzenellenbogen! His only daughter had either been rapt away to the\r\ngrave, or he was to have some wood-demon for a son-in-law, and perchance\r\na troop of goblin grandchildren. As usual, he was completely bewildered,\r\nand all the castle in an uproar. The men were ordered to take horse and\r\nscour every road and path and glen of the Odenwald. The baron himself\r\nhad just drawn on his jack-boots, girded on his sword, and was about\r\nto mount his steed to sally forth on the doubtful quest, when he was\r\nbrought to a pause by a new apparition. A lady was seen approaching the\r\ncastle mounted on a palfrey, attended by a cavalier on horseback. She\r\ngalloped up to the gate, sprang from her horse, and, falling at the\r\nbaron’s feet, embraced his knees. It was his lost daughter, and her\r\ncompanion--the Spectre Bridegroom! The baron was astounded. He looked\r\nat his daughter, then at the spectre, and almost doubted the evidence of\r\nhis senses. The latter, too, was wonderfully improved in his appearance\r\nsince his visit to the world of spirits. His dress was splendid, and\r\nset off a noble figure of manly symmetry. He was no longer pale and\r\nmelancholy. His fine countenance was flushed with the glow of youth, and\r\njoy rioted in his large dark eye.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was soon cleared up. The cavalier (for, in truth, as you\r\nmust have known all the while, he was no goblin) announced himself as\r\nSir Herman Von Starkenfaust. He related his adventure with the young\r\ncount. He told how he had hastened to the castle to deliver the\r\nunwelcome tidings, but that the eloquence of the baron had interrupted\r\nhim in every attempt to tell his tale. How the sight of the bride had\r\ncompletely captivated him and that to pass a few hours near her he\r\nhad tacitly suffered the mistake to continue. How he had been sorely\r\nperplexed in what way to make a decent retreat, until the baron’s\r\ngoblin stories had suggested his eccentric exit. How, fearing the feudal\r\nhostility of the family, he had repeated his visits by stealth--had\r\nhaunted the garden beneath the young lady’s window--had wooed--had\r\nwon--had borne away in triumph--and, in a word, had wedded the fair.\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances the baron would have been inflexible, for\r\nhe was tenacious of paternal authority and devoutly obstinate in all\r\nfamily feuds; but he loved his daughter; he had lamented her as lost;\r\nhe rejoiced to find her still alive; and, though her husband was of\r\na hostile house, yet, thank Heaven! he was not a goblin. There was\r\nsomething, it must be acknowledged, that did not exactly accord with his\r\nnotions of strict veracity in the joke the knight had passed upon him of\r\nhis being a dead man; but several old friends present, who had served\r\nin the wars, assured him that every stratagem was excusable in love,\r\nand that the cavalier was entitled to especial privilege, having lately\r\nserved as a trooper.\r\n\r\nMatters, therefore, were happily arranged. The baron pardoned the young\r\ncouple on the spot. The revels at the castle were resumed. The\r\npoor relations overwhelmed this new member of the family with\r\nloving-kindness; he was so gallant, so generous--and so rich. The\r\naunts, it is true, were somewhat scandalized that their system of strict\r\nseclusion and passive obedience should be so badly exemplified, but\r\nattributed it all to their negligence in not having the windows grated.\r\nOne of them was particularly mortified at having her marvellous story\r\nmarred, and that the only spectre she had ever seen should turn out a\r\ncounterfeit; but the niece seemed perfectly happy at having found him\r\nsubstantial flesh and blood. And so the story ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTMINSTER ABBEY.\r\n\r\n    When I behold, with deep astonishment,\r\n    To famous Westminster how there resorte,\r\n    Living in brasse or stoney monument,\r\n    The princes and the worthies of all sorte;\r\n    Doe not I see reformde nobilitie,\r\n    Without contempt, or pride, or ostentation,\r\n    And looke upon offenselesse majesty,\r\n    Naked of pomp or earthly domination?\r\n    And how a play-game of a painted stone\r\n    Contents the quiet now and silent sprites,\r\n    Whome all the world which late they stood upon\r\n    Could not content nor quench their appetites.\r\n        Life is a frost of cold felicitie,\r\n        And death the thaw of all our vanitie.\r\n            CHRISTOLERO’S EPIGRAMS, BY T. B. 1598.\r\n\r\nON one of those sober and rather melancholy days in the latter part of\r\nautumn when the shadows of morning and evening almost mingle together,\r\nand throw a gloom over the decline of the year, I passed several hours\r\nin rambling about Westminster Abbey. There was something congenial to\r\nthe season in the mournful magnificence of the old pile, and as I passed\r\nits threshold it seemed like stepping back into the regions of antiquity\r\nand losing myself among the shades of former ages.\r\n\r\nI entered from the inner court of Westminster School, through a long,\r\nlow, vaulted passage that had an almost subterranean look, being dimly\r\nlighted in one part by circular perforations in the massive walls.\r\nThrough this dark avenue I had a distant view of the cloisters, with\r\nthe figure of an old verger in his black gown moving along their shadowy\r\nvaults, and seeming like a spectre from one of the neighboring tombs.\r\nThe approach to the abbey through these gloomy monastic remains prepares\r\nthe mind for its solemn contemplation. The cloisters still retain\r\nsomething of the quiet and seclusion of former days. The gray walls are\r\ndiscolored by damps and crumbling with age; a coat of hoary moss has\r\ngathered over the inscriptions of the mural monuments, and obscured the\r\ndeath’s heads and other funeral emblems. The sharp touches of the chisel\r\nare gone from the rich tracery of the arches; the roses which adorned\r\nthe keystones have lost their leafy beauty; everything bears marks of\r\nthe gradual dilapidations of time, which yet has something touching and\r\npleasing in its very decay.\r\n\r\nThe sun was pouring down a yellow autumnal ray into the square of\r\nthe cloisters, beaming upon a scanty plot of grass in the centre,\r\nand lighting up an angle of the vaulted passage with a kind of dusky\r\nsplendor. From between the arcades the eye glanced up to a bit of blue\r\nsky or a passing cloud, and beheld the sun-gilt pinnacles of the abbey\r\ntowering into the azure heaven.\r\n\r\nAs I paced the cloisters, sometimes contemplating this mingled\r\npicture of glory and decay, and sometimes endeavoring to decipher the\r\ninscriptions on the tombstones which formed the pavement beneath my\r\nfeet, my eye was attracted to three figures rudely carved in relief,\r\nbut nearly worn away by the footsteps of many generations. They were\r\nthe effigies of three of the early abbots; the epitaphs were entirely\r\neffaced; the names alone remained, having no doubt been renewed in later\r\ntimes (Vitalis. Abbas. 1082, and Gislebertus Crispinus. Abbas. 1114,\r\nand Laurentius. Abbas. 1176). I remained some little while, musing over\r\nthese casual relics of antiquity thus left like wrecks upon this distant\r\nshore of time, telling no tale but that such beings had been and had\r\nperished, teaching no moral but the futility of that pride which hopes\r\nstill to exact homage in its ashes and to live in an inscription. A\r\nlittle longer, and even these faint records will be obliterated and the\r\nmonument will cease to be a memorial. Whilst I was yet looking down\r\nupon the gravestones I was roused by the sound of the abbey clock,\r\nreverberating from buttress to buttress and echoing among the cloisters.\r\nIt is almost startling to hear this warning of departed time sounding\r\namong the tombs and telling the lapse of the hour, which, like a billow,\r\nhas rolled us onward towards the grave. I pursued my walk to an\r\narched door opening to the interior of the abbey. On entering here the\r\nmagnitude of the building breaks fully upon the mind, contrasted with\r\nthe vaults of the cloisters. The eyes gaze with wonder at clustered\r\ncolumns of gigantic dimensions, with arches springing from them to such\r\nan amazing height, and man wandering about their bases, shrunk into\r\ninsignificance in comparison with his own handiwork. The spaciousness\r\nand gloom of this vast edifice produce a profound and mysterious awe.\r\nWe step cautiously and softly about, as if fearful of disturbing the\r\nhallowed silence of the tomb, while every footfall whispers along the\r\nwalls and chatters among the sepulchres, making us more sensible of the\r\nquiet we have interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if the awful nature of the place presses down upon the soul\r\nand hushes the beholder into noiseless reverence. We feel that we are\r\nsurrounded by the congregated bones of the great men of past times, who\r\nhave filled history with their deeds and the earth with their renown.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it almost provokes a smile at the vanity of human ambition\r\nto see how they are crowded together and jostled in the dust; what\r\nparsimony is observed in doling out a scanty nook, a gloomy corner, a\r\nlittle portion of earth, to those whom, when alive, kingdoms could not\r\nsatisfy, and how many shapes and forms and artifices are devised to\r\ncatch the casual notice of the passenger, and save from forgetfulness\r\nfor a few short years a name which once aspired to occupy ages of the\r\nworld’s thought and admiration.\r\n\r\nI passed some time in Poet’s Corner, which occupies an end of one of\r\nthe transepts or cross aisles of the abbey. The monuments are generally\r\nsimple, for the lives of literary men afford no striking themes for\r\nthe sculptor. Shakespeare and Addison have statues erected to their\r\nmemories, but the greater part have busts, medallions, and sometimes\r\nmere inscriptions. Notwithstanding the simplicity of these memorials,\r\nI have always observed that the visitors to the abbey remained longest\r\nabout them. A kinder and fonder feeling takes place of that cold\r\ncuriosity or vague admiration with which they gaze on the splendid\r\nmonuments of the great and the heroic. They linger about these as about\r\nthe tombs of friends and companions, for indeed there is something of\r\ncompanionship between the author and the reader. Other men are known\r\nto posterity only through the medium of history, which is continually\r\ngrowing faint and obscure; but the intercourse between the author and\r\nhis fellowmen is ever new, active, and immediate. He has lived for them\r\nmore than for himself; he has sacrificed surrounding enjoyments, and\r\nshut himself up from the delights of social life, that he might the more\r\nintimately commune with distant minds and distant ages. Well may the\r\nworld cherish his renown, for it has been purchased not by deeds of\r\nviolence and blood, but by the diligent dispensation of pleasure.\r\nWell may posterity be grateful to his memory, for he has left it an\r\ninheritance not of empty names and sounding actions, but whole treasures\r\nof wisdom, bright gems of thought, and golden veins of language.\r\n\r\nFrom Poet’s Corner I continued my stroll towards that part of the abbey\r\nwhich contains the sepulchres of the kings. I wandered among what once\r\nwere chapels, but which are now occupied by the tombs and monuments\r\nof the great. At every turn I met with some illustrious name or the\r\ncognizance of some powerful house renowned in history. As the eye\r\ndarts into these dusky chambers of death it catches glimpses of quaint\r\neffigies--some kneeling in niches, as if in devotion; others stretched\r\nupon the tombs, with hands piously pressed together; warriors in armor,\r\nas if reposing after battle; prelates, with crosiers and mitres; and\r\nnobles in robes and coronets, lying as it were in state. In glancing\r\nover this scene, so strangely populous, yet where every form is so still\r\nand silent, it seems almost as if we were treading a mansion of that\r\nfabled city where every being had been suddenly transmuted into stone.\r\n\r\nI paused to contemplate a tomb on which lay the effigy of a knight in\r\ncomplete armor. A large buckler was on one arm; the hands were pressed\r\ntogether in supplication upon the breast; the face was almost covered by\r\nthe morion; the legs were crossed, in token of the warrior’s having been\r\nengaged in the holy war. It was the tomb of a crusader, of one of those\r\nmilitary enthusiasts who so strangely mingled religion and romance,\r\nand whose exploits form the connecting link between fact and fiction,\r\nbetween the history and the fairytale. There is something extremely\r\npicturesque in the tombs of these adventurers, decorated as they are\r\nwith rude armorial bearings and Gothic sculpture. They comport with the\r\nantiquated chapels in which they are generally found; and in considering\r\nthem the imagination is apt to kindle with the legendary associations,\r\nthe romantic fiction, the chivalrous pomp and pageantry which poetry has\r\nspread over the wars for the sepulchre of Christ. They are the relics\r\nof times utterly gone by, of beings passed from recollection, of customs\r\nand manners with which ours have no affinity. They are like objects from\r\nsome strange and distant land of which we have no certain knowledge,\r\nand about which all our conceptions are vague and visionary. There is\r\nsomething extremely solemn and awful in those effigies on Gothic tombs,\r\nextended as if in the sleep of death or in the supplication of the dying\r\nhour. They have an effect infinitely more impressive on my feelings\r\nthan the fanciful attitudes, the over wrought conceits, the allegorical\r\ngroups which abound on modern monuments. I have been struck, also, with\r\nthe superiority of many of the old sepulchral inscriptions. There was a\r\nnoble way in former times of saying things simply, and yet saying\r\nthem proudly; and I do not know an epitaph that breathes a loftier\r\nconsciousness of family worth and honorable lineage than one which\r\naffirms of a noble house that “all the brothers were brave and all the\r\nsisters virtuous.”\r\n\r\nIn the opposite transept to Poet’s Corner stands a monument which is\r\namong the most renowned achievements of modern art, but which to\r\nme appears horrible rather than sublime. It is the tomb of Mrs.\r\nNightingale, by Roubillac. The bottom of the monument is represented\r\nas throwing open its marble doors, and a sheeted skeleton is starting\r\nforth. The shroud is falling from his fleshless frame as he launches his\r\ndart at his victim. She is sinking into her affrighted husband’s arms,\r\nwho strives with vain and frantic effort to avert the blow. The whole\r\nis executed with terrible truth and spirit; we almost fancy we hear\r\nthe gibbering yell of triumph bursting from the distended jaws of the\r\nspectre. But why should we thus seek to clothe death with unnecessary\r\nterrors, and to spread horrors round the tomb of those we love? The\r\ngrave should be surrounded by everything that might inspire tenderness\r\nand veneration for the dead, or that might win the living to virtue. It\r\nis the place not of disgust and dismay, but of sorrow and meditation.\r\n\r\nWhile wandering about these gloomy vaults and silent aisles, studying\r\nthe records of the dead, the sound of busy existence from without\r\noccasionally reaches the ear--the rumbling of the passing equipage, the\r\nmurmur of the multitude, or perhaps the light laugh of pleasure. The\r\ncontrast is striking with the deathlike repose around; and it has a\r\nstrange effect upon the feelings thus to hear the surges of active life\r\nhurrying along and beating against the very walls of the sepulchre.\r\n\r\nI continued in this way to move from tomb to tomb and from chapel\r\nto chapel. The day was gradually wearing away; the distant tread of\r\nloiterers about the abbey grew less and less frequent; the sweet-tongued\r\nbell was summoning to evening prayers; and I saw at a distance the\r\nchoristers in their white surplices crossing the aisle and entering\r\nthe choir. I stood before the entrance to Henry the Seventh’s chapel. A\r\nflight of steps leads up to it through a deep and gloomy but magnificent\r\narch. Great gates of brass, richly and delicately wrought, turn heavily\r\nupon their hinges, as if proudly reluctant to admit the feet of common\r\nmortals into this most gorgeous of sepulchres.\r\n\r\nOn entering the eye is astonished by the pomp of architecture and the\r\nelaborate beauty of sculptured detail. The very walls are wrought into\r\nuniversal ornament encrusted with tracery, and scooped into niches\r\ncrowded with the statues of saints and martyrs. Stone seems, by the\r\ncunning labor of the chisel, to have been robbed of its weight and\r\ndensity, suspended aloft as if by magic, and the fretted roof achieved\r\nwith the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb.\r\n\r\nAlong the sides of the chapel are the lofty stalls of the Knights of\r\nthe Bath, richly carved of oak, though with the grotesque decorations\r\nof Gothic architecture. On the pinnacles of the stalls are affixed the\r\nhelmets and crests of the knights, with their scarfs and swords,\r\nand above them are suspended their banners, emblazoned with armorial\r\nbearings, and contrasting the splendor of gold and purple and crimson\r\nwith the cold gray fretwork of the roof. In the midst of this grand\r\nmausoleum stands the sepulchre of its founder--his effigy, with that of\r\nhis queen, extended on a sumptuous tomb--and the whole surrounded by a\r\nsuperbly-wrought brazen railing.\r\n\r\nThere is a sad dreariness in this magnificence, this strange mixture of\r\ntombs and trophies, these emblems of living and aspiring ambition,\r\nclose beside mementos which show the dust and oblivion in which all\r\nmust sooner or later terminate. Nothing impresses the mind with a deeper\r\nfeeling of loneliness than to tread the silent and deserted scene of\r\nformer throng and pageant. On looking round on the vacant stalls of\r\nthe knights and their esquires, and on the rows of dusty but gorgeous\r\nbanners that were once borne before them, my imagination conjured up the\r\nscene when this hall was bright with the valor and beauty of the land,\r\nglittering with the splendor of jewelled rank and military array, alive\r\nwith the tread of many feet and the hum of an admiring multitude. All\r\nhad passed away; the silence of death had settled again upon the place,\r\ninterrupted only by the casual chirping of birds, which had found\r\ntheir way into the chapel and built their nests among its friezes and\r\npendants--sure signs of solitariness and desertion.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the names inscribed on the banners, they were those of men\r\nscattered far and wide about the world--some tossing upon distant seas:\r\nsome under arms in distant lands; some mingling in the busy intrigues\r\nof courts and cabinets,--all seeking to deserve one more distinction in\r\nthis mansion of shadowy honors--the melancholy reward of a monument.\r\n\r\nTwo small aisles on each side of this chapel present a touching instance\r\nof the equality of the grave, which brings down the oppressor to a\r\nlevel with the oppressed and mingles the dust of the bitterest enemies\r\ntogether. In one is the sepulchre of the haughty Elizabeth; in the other\r\nis that of her victim, the lovely and unfortunate Mary. Not an hour in\r\nthe day but some ejaculation of pity is uttered over the fate of\r\nthe latter, mingled with indignation at her oppressor. The walls of\r\nElizabeth’s sepulchre continually echo with the sighs of sympathy heaved\r\nat the grave of her rival.\r\n\r\nA peculiar melancholy reigns over the aisle where Mary lies buried. The\r\nlight struggles dimly through windows darkened by dust. The greater part\r\nof the place is in deep shadow, and the walls are stained and tinted by\r\ntime and weather. A marble figure of Mary is stretched upon the tomb,\r\nround which is an iron railing, much corroded, bearing her national\r\nemblem--the thistle. I was weary with wandering, and sat down to\r\nrest myself by the monument, revolving in my mind the chequered and\r\ndisastrous story of poor Mary.\r\n\r\nThe sound of casual footsteps had ceased from the abbey. I could only\r\nhear, now and then, the distant voice of the priest repeating the\r\nevening service and the faint responses of the choir; these paused for\r\na time, and all was hushed. The stillness, the desertion, and obscurity\r\nthat were gradually prevailing around gave a deeper and more solemn\r\ninterest to the place;\r\n\r\n    For in the silent grave no conversation,\r\n    No joyful tread of friends, no voice of lovers,\r\n    No careful father’s counsel--nothing’s heard,\r\n    For nothing is, but all oblivion,\r\n    Dust, and an endless darkness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the notes of the deep-laboring organ burst upon the ear,\r\nfalling with doubled and redoubled intensity, and rolling, as it were,\r\nhuge billows of sound. How well do their volume and grandeur accord\r\nwith this mighty building! With what pomp do they swell through its vast\r\nvaults, and breathe their awful harmony through these caves of death,\r\nand make the silent sepulchre vocal! And now they rise in triumphant\r\nacclamation, heaving higher and higher their accordant notes and piling\r\nsound on sound. And now they pause, and the soft voices of the choir\r\nbreak out into sweet gushes of melody; they soar aloft and warble along\r\nthe roof, and seem to play about these lofty vaults like the pure\r\nairs of heaven. Again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling thunders,\r\ncompressing air into music, and rolling it forth upon the soul. What\r\nlong-drawn cadences! What solemn sweeping concords! It grows more and\r\nmore dense and powerful; it fills the vast pile and seems to jar the\r\nvery walls--the ear is stunned--the senses are overwhelmed. And now it\r\nis winding up in full jubilee--it is rising from the earth to heaven;\r\nthe very soul seems rapt away and floated upwards on this swelling tide\r\nof harmony!\r\n\r\nI sat for some time lost in that kind of reverie which a strain of\r\nmusic is apt sometimes to inspire: the shadows of evening were gradually\r\nthickening round me; the monuments began to cast deeper and deeper\r\ngloom; and the distant clock again gave token of the slowly waning day.\r\n\r\nI rose and prepared to leave the abbey. As I descended the flight of\r\nsteps which lead into the body of the building, my eye was caught by the\r\nshrine of Edward the Confessor, and I ascended the small staircase that\r\nconducts to it, to take from thence a general survey of this wilderness\r\nof tombs. The shrine is elevated upon a kind of platform, and close\r\naround it are the sepulchres of various kings and queens. From this\r\neminence the eye looks down between pillars and funeral trophies to\r\nthe chapels and chambers below, crowded with tombs, where warriors,\r\nprelates, courtiers, and statesmen lie mouldering in their “beds of\r\ndarkness.” Close by me stood the great chair of coronation, rudely\r\ncarved of oak in the barbarous taste of a remote and Gothic age. The\r\nscene seemed almost as if contrived with theatrical artifice to produce\r\nan effect upon the beholder. Here was a type of the beginning and the\r\nend of human pomp and power; here it was literally but a step from the\r\nthrone to the sepulchre. Would not one think that these incongruous\r\nmementos had been gathered together as a lesson to living greatness?--to\r\nshow it, even in the moment of its proudest exaltation, the neglect\r\nand dishonor to which it must soon arrive--how soon that crown which\r\nencircles its brow must pass away, and it must lie down in the dust and\r\ndisgraces of the tomb, and be trampled upon by the feet of the meanest\r\nof the multitude. For, strange to tell, even the grave is here no longer\r\na sanctuary. There is a shocking levity in some natures which leads them\r\nto sport with awful and hallowed things, and there are base minds\r\nwhich delight to revenge on the illustrious dead the abject homage and\r\ngrovelling servility which they pay to the living. The coffin of Edward\r\nthe Confessor has been broken open, and his remains despoiled of their\r\nfunereal ornaments; the sceptre has been stolen from the hand of the\r\nimperious Elizabeth; and the effigy of Henry the Fifth lies headless.\r\nNot a royal monument but bears some proof how false and fugitive is the\r\nhomage of mankind. Some are plundered, some mutilated, some covered with\r\nribaldry and insult,--all more or less outraged and dishonored.\r\n\r\nThe last beams of day were now faintly streaming through the painted\r\nwindows in the high vaults above me; the lower parts of the abbey were\r\nalready wrapped in the obscurity of twilight. The chapels and aisles\r\ngrew darker and darker. The effigies of the kings faded into shadows;\r\nthe marble figures of the monuments assumed strange shapes in the\r\nuncertain light; the evening breeze crept through the aisles like the\r\ncold breath of the grave; and even the distant footfall of a verger,\r\ntraversing the Poet’s Corner, had something strange and dreary in its\r\nsound. I slowly retraced my morning’s walk, and as I passed out at the\r\nportal of the cloisters, the door, closing with a jarring noise behind\r\nme, filled the whole building with echoes.\r\n\r\nI endeavored to form some arrangement in my mind of the objects I\r\nhad been contemplating, but found they were already falling into\r\nindistinctness and confusion. Names, inscriptions, trophies, had all\r\nbecome confounded in my recollection, though I had scarcely taken my\r\nfoot from off the threshold. What, thought I, is this vast assemblage\r\nof sepulchres but a treasury of humiliation--a huge pile of reiterated\r\nhomilies on the emptiness of renown and the certainty of oblivion? It\r\nis, indeed, the empire of death; his great shadowy palace where he sits\r\nin state mocking at the relics of human glory and spreading dust and\r\nforgetfulness on the monuments of princes. How idle a boast, after all,\r\nis the immortality of a name! Time is ever silently turning over his\r\npages; we are too much engrossed by the story of the present to think\r\nof the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past; and\r\neach age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten. The idol of\r\nto-day pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection, and will in\r\nturn be supplanted by his successor of tomorrow. “Our fathers,” says Sir\r\nThomas Browne, “find their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell\r\nus how we may be buried in our survivors.” History fades into fable;\r\nfact becomes clouded with doubt and controversy; the inscription\r\nmoulders from the tablet; the statue falls from the pedestal. Columns,\r\narches, pyramids, what are they but heaps of sand, and their epitaphs\r\nbut characters written in the dust? What is the security of a tomb or\r\nthe perpetuity of an embalmment? The remains of Alexander the Great have\r\nbeen scattered to the wind, and his empty sarcophagus is now the mere\r\ncuriosity of a museum. “The Egyptian mummies, which Cambyses or time\r\nhath spared, avarice now consumeth; Mizraim cures wounds, and Pharaoh is\r\nsold for balsams.” *\r\n\r\nWhat then is to ensure this pile which now towers above me from sharing\r\nthe fate of mightier mausoleums? The time must come when its gilded\r\nvaults which now spring so loftily, shall lie in rubbish beneath the\r\nfeet; when instead of the sound of melody and praise the wind shall\r\nwhistle through the broken arches and the owl hoot from the shattered\r\ntower; when the garish sunbeam shall break into these gloomy mansions of\r\ndeath, and the ivy twine round the fallen column; and the fox-glove hang\r\nits blossoms about the nameless urn, as if in mockery of the dead.\r\nThus man passes away; his name passes from record and recollection; his\r\nhistory is as a tale that is told, and his very monument becomes a ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Sir T. Browne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nBut is old, old, good old Christmas gone? Nothing but the hair of his\r\ngood, gray old head and beard left? Well, I will have that, seeing I\r\ncannot have more of him. HUE AND CRY AFTER CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n    A man might then behold\r\n        At Christmas, in each hall\r\n    Good fires to curb the cold,\r\n        And meat for great and small.\r\n    The neighbors were friendly bidden,\r\n        And all had welcome true,\r\n    The poor from the gates were not chidden\r\n        When this old cap was new.\r\n                                        OLD SONG.\r\n\r\nNOTHING in England exercises a more delightful spell over my imagination\r\nthan the lingerings of the holiday customs and rural games of former\r\ntimes. They recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in the May morning\r\nof life, when as yet I only knew the world through books, and believed\r\nit to be all that poets had painted it; and they bring with them the\r\nflavor of those honest days of yore, in which, perhaps with equal\r\nfallacy, I am apt to think the world was more homebred, social, and\r\njoyous than at present. I regret to say that they are daily growing\r\nmore and more faint, being gradually worn away by time, but still more\r\nobliterated by modern fashion. They resemble those picturesque morsels\r\nof Gothic architecture which we see crumbling in various parts of the\r\ncountry, partly dilapidated by the waste of ages and partly lost in the\r\nadditions and alterations of latter days. Poetry, however, clings with\r\ncherishing fondness about the rural game and holiday revel from which\r\nit has derived so many of its themes, as the ivy winds its rich foliage\r\nabout the Gothic arch and mouldering tower, gratefully repaying their\r\nsupport by clasping together their tottering remains, and, as it were,\r\nembalming them in verdure.\r\n\r\nOf all the old festivals, however, that of Christmas awakens the\r\nstrongest and most heartfelt associations. There is a tone of solemn and\r\nsacred feeling that blends with our conviviality and lifts the spirit to\r\na state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment. The services of the Church\r\nabout this season are extremely tender and inspiring. They dwell on the\r\nbeautiful story of the origin of our faith and the pastoral scenes that\r\naccompanied its announcement. They gradually increase in fervor and\r\npathos during the season of Advent, until they break forth in full\r\njubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men. I do not\r\nknow a grander effect of music on the moral feelings than to hear the\r\nfull choir and the pealing organ performing a Christmas anthem in a\r\ncathedral, and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful arrangement, also, derived from days of yore, that\r\nthis festival, which commemorates the announcement of the religion\r\nof peace and love, has been made the season for gathering together of\r\nfamily connections, and drawing closer again those bands of kindred\r\nhearts which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are\r\ncontinually operating to cast loose; of calling back the children of a\r\nfamily who have launched forth in life and wandered widely asunder, once\r\nmore to assemble about the paternal hearth, that rallying-place of the\r\naffections, there to grow young and loving again among the endearing\r\nmementos of childhood.\r\n\r\nThere is something in the very season of the year that gives a charm to\r\nthe festivity of Christmas. At other times we derive a great portion of\r\nour pleasures from the mere beauties of Nature. Our feelings sally forth\r\nand dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape, and we “live abroad\r\nand everywhere.” The song of the bird, the murmur of the stream, the\r\nbreathing fragrance of spring, the soft voluptuousness of summer, the\r\ngolden pomp of autumn, earth with its mantle of refreshing green, and\r\nheaven with it deep delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence,--all\r\nfill us with mute but exquisite delight, and we revel in the luxury of\r\nmere sensation. But in the depth of winter, when Nature lies despoiled\r\nof every charm and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow, we turn for\r\nour gratifications to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of\r\nthe landscape, the short gloomy days and darksome nights, while they\r\ncircumscribe our wanderings, shut in our feelings also from rambling\r\nabroad, and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasure of the social\r\ncircle. Our thoughts are more concentrated; our friendly sympathies more\r\naroused. We feel more sensibly the charm of each other’s society,\r\nand are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for\r\nenjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart, and we draw our pleasures from the\r\ndeep wells of loving-kindness which lie in the quiet recesses of our\r\nbosoms, and which, when resorted to, furnish forth the pure element of\r\ndomestic felicity.\r\n\r\nThe pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room\r\nfilled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire. The ruddy blaze\r\ndiffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room, and lights\r\nup each countenance in a kindlier welcome. Where does the honest face of\r\nhospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smile, where is the\r\nshy glance of love more sweetly eloquent, than by the winter fireside?\r\nand as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the hall, claps\r\nthe distant door, whistles about the casement, and rumbles down the\r\nchimney, what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober and\r\nsheltered security with which we look round upon the comfortable chamber\r\nand the scene of domestic hilarity?\r\n\r\nThe English, from the great prevalence of rural habit throughout\r\nevery class of society, have always been found of those festivals and\r\nholidays, which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life, and\r\nthey were, in former days, particularly observant of the religious and\r\nsocial rites of Christmas. It is inspiring to read even the dry details\r\nwhich some antiquaries have given of the quaint humors, the burlesque\r\npageants, the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship with\r\nwhich this festival was celebrated. It seemed to throw open every door\r\nand unlock every heart. It brought the peasant and the peer together,\r\nand blended all ranks in one warm, generous flow of joy and kindness.\r\nThe old halls of castles and manor-houses resounded with the harp and\r\nthe Christmas carol, and their ample boards groaned under the weight of\r\nhospitality. Even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with\r\ngreen decorations of bay and holly--the cheerful fire glanced its rays\r\nthrough the lattice, inviting the passengers to raise the latch and join\r\nthe gossip knot huddled round the hearth beguiling the long evening with\r\nlegendary jokes and oft-told Christmas tales.\r\n\r\nOne of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it\r\nhas made among the hearty old holiday customs. It has completely taken\r\noff the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments\r\nof life, and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished,\r\nbut certainly a less characteristic, surface. Many of the games and\r\nceremonials of Christmas have entirely disappeared, and, like the\r\nsherris sack of old Falstaff, are become matters of speculation and\r\ndispute among commentators. They flourished in times full of spirit\r\nand lustihood, when men enjoyed life roughly, but heartily and\r\nvigorously--times wild and picturesque, which have furnished poetry with\r\nits richest materials and the drama with its most attractive variety of\r\ncharacters and manners. The world has become more worldly. There is\r\nmore of dissipation, and less of enjoyment. Pleasure has expanded into a\r\nbroader, but a shallower stream, and has forsaken many of those deep\r\nand quiet channels where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom of\r\ndomestic life. Society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone,\r\nbut it has lost many of its strong local peculiarities, its homebred\r\nfeelings, its honest fireside delights. The traditionary customs\r\nof golden-hearted antiquity, its feudal hospitalities, and lordly\r\nwassailings, have passed away with the baronial castles and stately\r\nmanor-houses in which they were celebrated. They comported with the\r\nshadowy hall, the great oaken gallery, and the tapestried parlor, but\r\nare unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay drawing-rooms of the\r\nmodern villa.\r\n\r\nShorn, however, as it is, of its ancient and festive honors, Christmas\r\nis still a period of delightful excitement in England. It is gratifying\r\nto see that home-feeling completely aroused which holds so powerful a\r\nplace in every English bosom. The preparations making on every side\r\nfor the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred; the\r\npresents of good cheer passing and repassing, those tokens of regard and\r\nquickeners of kind feelings; the evergreens distributed about houses\r\nand churches, emblems of peace and gladness,--all these have the most\r\npleasing effect in producing fond associations and kindling benevolent\r\nsympathies. Even the sound of the Waits, rude as may be their\r\nminstrelsy, breaks upon the mid-watches of a winter night with the\r\neffect of perfect harmony. As I have been awakened by them in that still\r\nand solemn hour “when deep sleep falleth upon man,” I have listened\r\nwith a hushed delight, and, connecting them with the sacred and\r\njoyous occasion, have almost fancied them into another celestial choir\r\nannouncing peace and good-will to mankind.\r\n\r\nHow delightfully the imagination, when wrought upon by these moral\r\ninfluences, turns everything to melody and beauty! The very crowing\r\nof the cock, heard sometimes in the profound repose of the country,\r\n“telling the night-watches to his feathery dames,” was thought by the\r\ncommon people to announce the approach of this sacred festival.\r\n\r\n    “Some say that ever ‘gainst that season comes\r\n    Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,\r\n    This bird of dawning singeth all night long;\r\n    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad,\r\n    The nights are wholesome--then no planets strike,\r\n    No fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm,\r\n    So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.”\r\n\r\nAmidst the general call to happiness, the bustle of the spirits, and\r\nstir of the affections which prevail at this period what bosom can\r\nremain insensible? It is, indeed, the season of regenerated feeling--the\r\nseason for kindling not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall, but\r\nthe genial flame of charity in the heart.\r\n\r\nThe scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile\r\nwaste of years; and the idea of home, fraught with the fragrance of\r\nhome-dwelling joys, reanimates the drooping spirit, as the Arabian\r\nbreeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the\r\nweary pilgrim of the desert.\r\n\r\nStranger and sojourner as I am in the land, though for me no social\r\nhearth may blaze, no hospitable roof throw open its doors, nor the\r\nwarm grasp of friendship welcome me at the threshold, yet I feel the\r\ninfluence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of\r\nthose around me. Surely happiness is reflective, like the light of\r\nheaven, and every countenance, bright with smiles and glowing with\r\ninnocent enjoyment, is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a\r\nsupreme and ever-shining benevolence. He who can turn churlishly away\r\nfrom contemplating the felicity of his fellow-beings, and can sit down\r\ndarkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful, may\r\nhave his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification, but he\r\nwants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a\r\nmerry Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STAGE-COACH.\r\n\r\n        Omne bene\r\n        Sine poena\r\n    Tempua est ludendi.\r\n        Venit hora\r\n        Absque mora\r\n    Libros deponendi.\r\n           OLD HOLIDAY SCHOOL-SONG.\r\n\r\nIN the preceding paper I have made some general observations on the\r\nChristmas festivities of England, and am tempted to illustrate them by\r\nsome anecdotes of a Christmas passed in the country; in perusing which\r\nI would most courteously invite my reader to lay aside the austerity of\r\nwisdom, and to put on that genuine holiday spirit which is tolerant of\r\nfolly and anxious only for amusement.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a December tour in Yorkshire, I rode for a long\r\ndistance in one of the public coaches on the day preceding Christmas.\r\nThe coach was crowded, both inside and out, with passengers who, by\r\ntheir talk, seemed principally bound to the mansions of relations or\r\nfriends to eat the Christmas dinner. It was loaded also with hampers of\r\ngame and baskets and boxes of delicacies, and hares hung dangling their\r\nlong ears about the coachman’s box, presents from distant friends for\r\nthe impending feast. I had three fine rosy-cheeked school boys for my\r\nfellow-passengers inside, full of the buxom health and manly spirit\r\nwhich I have observed in the children of this country. They were\r\nreturning home for the holidays in high glee, and promising themselves a\r\nworld of enjoyment. It was delightful to hear the gigantic plans of the\r\nlittle rogues, and the impracticable feats they were to perform during\r\ntheir six weeks’ emancipation from the abhorred thraldom of book, birch,\r\nand pedagogue. They were full of anticipations of the meeting with the\r\nfamily and household, down to the very cat and dog, and of the joy\r\nthey were to give their little sisters by the presents with which their\r\npockets were crammed; but the meeting to which they seemed to look\r\nforward with the greatest impatience was with Bantam, which I found to\r\nbe a pony, and, according to their talk, possessed of more virtues than\r\nany steed since the days of Bucephalus. How he could trot! how he could\r\nrun! and then such leaps as he would take!--there was not a hedge in the\r\nwhole country that he could not clear.\r\n\r\nThey were under the particular guardianship of the coachman, to whom,\r\nwhenever an opportunity presented, they addressed a host of questions,\r\nand pronounced him one of the best fellows in the world. Indeed, I could\r\nnot but notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and importance of\r\nthe coachman, who wore his hat a little on one side and had a large\r\nbunch of Christmas greens stuck in the buttonhole of his coat. He\r\nis always a personage full of mighty care and business, but he is\r\nparticularly so during this season, having so many commissions to\r\nexecute in consequence of the great interchange of presents. And here,\r\nperhaps, it may not be unacceptable to my untravelled readers to have a\r\nsketch that may serve as a general representation of this very numerous\r\nand important class of functionaries, who have a dress, a manner, a\r\nlanguage, an air peculiar to themselves and prevalent throughout the\r\nfraternity; so that wherever an English stage-coachman may be seen he\r\ncannot be mistaken for one of any other craft or mystery.\r\n\r\nHe has commonly a broad, full face, curiously mottled with red, as if\r\nthe blood had been forced by hard feeding into every vessel of the\r\nskin; he is swelled into jolly dimensions by frequent potations of malt\r\nliquors, and his bulk is still further increased by a multiplicity of\r\ncoats, in which he is buried like a cauliflower, the upper one reaching\r\nto his heels. He wears a broad-brimmed, low-crowned hat; a huge roll of\r\ncolored handkerchief about his neck, knowingly knotted and tucked in\r\nat the bosom; and has in summer-time a large bouquet of flowers in his\r\nbuttonhole, the present, most probably, of some enamored country\r\nlass. His waistcoat is commonly of some bright color, striped, and his\r\nsmall-clothes extend far below the knees, to meet a pair of jockey boots\r\nwhich reach about halfway up his legs.\r\n\r\nAll this costume is maintained with much precision; he has a pride in\r\nhaving his clothes of excellent materials, and, notwithstanding the\r\nseeming grossness of his appearance, there is still discernible\r\nthat neatness and propriety of person which is almost inherent in an\r\nEnglishman. He enjoys great consequence and consideration along the\r\nroad; has frequent conferences with the village housewives, who look\r\nupon him as a man of great trust and dependence; and he seems to have\r\na good understanding with every bright-eyed country lass. The moment\r\nhe arrives where the horses are to be changed, he throws down the reins\r\nwith something of an air and abandons the cattle to the care of the\r\nostler, his duty being merely to drive from one stage to another. When\r\noff the box his hands are thrust into the pockets of his great coat, and\r\nhe rolls about the inn-yard with an air of the most absolute lordliness.\r\nHere he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of ostlers,\r\nstableboys, shoeblacks, and those nameless hangers-on that infest\r\ninns and taverns, and run errands and do all kind of odd jobs for the\r\nprivilege of battening on the drippings of the kitchen and the leakage\r\nof the tap-room. These all look up to him as to an oracle, treasure up\r\nhis cant phrases, echo his opinions about horses and other topics of\r\njockey lore, and, above all, endeavor to imitate his air and carriage.\r\nEvery ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the\r\npockets, rolls in his gait, talks slang, and is an embryo Coachey.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might be owing to the pleasing serenity that reigned in\r\nmy own mind that I fancied I saw cheerfulness in every countenance\r\nthroughout the journey. A stage-coach, however, carries animation always\r\nwith it, and puts the world in motion as it whirls along. The horn,\r\nsounded at the entrance of the village, produces a general bustle. Some\r\nhasten forth to meet friends; some with bundles and bandboxes to secure\r\nplaces, and in the hurry of the moment can hardly take leave of the\r\ngroup that accompanies them. In the meantime the coachman has a world of\r\nsmall commissions to execute. Sometimes he delivers a hare or pheasant;\r\nsometimes jerks a small parcel or newspaper to the door of a public\r\nhouse; and sometimes, with knowing leer and words of sly import,\r\nhands to some half-blushing, half-laughing house-maid an odd-shaped\r\nbillet-doux from some rustic admirer. As the coach rattles through the\r\nvillage every one runs to the window, and you have glances on every side\r\nof fresh country faces and blooming giggling girls. At the corners are\r\nassembled juntos of village idlers and wise men, who take their stations\r\nthere for the important purpose of seeing company pass; but the sagest\r\nknot is generally at the blacksmith’s, to whom the passing of the coach\r\nis an event fruitful of much speculation. The smith, with the horse’s\r\nheel in his lap, pauses as the vehicle whirls by; the cyclops round the\r\nanvil suspend their ringing hammers and suffer the iron to grow cool;\r\nand the sooty spectre in brown paper cap laboring at the bellows leans\r\non the handle for a moment, and permits the asthmatic engine to heave a\r\nlong-drawn sigh, while he glares through the murky smoke and sulphurous\r\ngleams of the smithy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the impending holiday might have given a more than usual\r\nanimation to the country, for it seemed to me as if everybody was in\r\ngood looks and good spirits. Game, poultry, and other luxuries of\r\nthe table were in brisk circulation in the villages; the grocers’,\r\nbutchers’, and fruiterers’ shops were thronged with customers. The\r\nhousewives were stirring briskly about, putting their dwellings in\r\norder, and the glossy branches of holly with their bright-red berries\r\nbegan to appear at the windows. The scene brought to mind an old\r\nwriter’s account of Christmas preparation: “Now capons and hens, besides\r\nturkeys, geese, and ducks, with beef and mutton, must all die, for in\r\ntwelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little. Now\r\nplums and spice, sugar and honey, square it among pies and broth. Now\r\nor never must music be in tune, for the youth must dance and sing to\r\nget them a heat, while the aged sit by the fire. The country maid leaves\r\nhalf her market, and must be sent again if she forgets a pack of cards\r\non Christmas Eve. Great is the contention of holly and ivy whether\r\nmaster or dame wears the breeches. Dice and cards benefit the butler;\r\nand if the cook do not lack wit, he will sweetly lick his fingers.”\r\n\r\nI was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation by a shout from\r\nmy little travelling companions. They had been looking out of the\r\ncoach-windows for the last few miles, recognizing every tree and cottage\r\nas they approached home, and now there was a general burst of joy.\r\n“There’s John! and there’s old Carlo! and there’s Bantam!” cried the\r\nhappy little rogues, clapping their hands.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a lane there was an old sober-looking servant in livery\r\nwaiting for them; he was accompanied by a superannuated pointer and by\r\nthe redoubtable Bantam, a little old rat of a pony with a shaggy mane\r\nand long rusty tail, who stood dozing quietly by the roadside, little\r\ndreaming of the bustling times that awaited him.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows leaped\r\nabout the steady old footman and hugged the pointer, who wriggled his\r\nwhole body for joy. But Bantam was the great object of interest; all\r\nwanted to mount at once, and it was with some difficulty that John\r\narranged that they should ride by turns and the eldest should ride\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nOff they set at last, one on the pony, with the dog bounding and barking\r\nbefore him, and the others holding John’s hands, both talking at\r\nonce and overpowering him with questions about home and with school\r\nanecdotes. I looked after them with a feeling in which I do not know\r\nwhether pleasure or melancholy predominated; for I was reminded of those\r\ndays when, like them, I had known neither care nor sorrow and a holiday\r\nwas the summit of earthly felicity. We stopped a few moments afterwards\r\nto water the horses, and on resuming our route a turn of the road\r\nbrought us in sight of a neat country-seat. I could just distinguish the\r\nforms of a lady and two young girls in the portico, and I saw my\r\nlittle comrades, with Bantam, Carlo, and old John, trooping along the\r\ncarriage-road. I leaned out of the coach-window, in hopes of witnessing\r\nthe happy meeting, but a grove of trees shut it from my sight.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we reached a village where I had determined to pass the\r\nnight. As we drove into the great gateway of the inn, I saw on one side\r\nthe light of a rousing kitchen-fire beaming through a window. I entered,\r\nand admired, for the hundredth time, that picture of convenience,\r\nneatness, and broad honest enjoyment, the kitchen of an English inn.\r\nIt was of spacious dimensions, hung round with copper and tin vessels\r\nhighly polished, and decorated here and there with a Christmas green.\r\nHams, tongues, and flitches of bacon were suspended from the ceiling; a\r\nsmoke-jack made its ceaseless clanking beside the fireplace, and a clock\r\nticked in one corner. A well-scoured deal table extended along one side\r\nof the kitchen, with a cold round of beef and other hearty viands\r\nupon it, over which two foaming tankards of ale seemed mounting guard.\r\nTravellers of inferior order were preparing to attack this stout repast,\r\nwhile others sat smoking and gossiping over their ale on two high-backed\r\noaken settles beside the fire. Trim housemaids were hurrying backwards\r\nand forwards under the directions of a fresh bustling landlady, but\r\nstill seizing an occasional moment to exchange a flippant word and have\r\na rallying laugh with the group round the fire. The scene completely\r\nrealized Poor Robin’s humble idea of the comforts of midwinter:\r\n\r\n    Now trees their leafy hats do bare\r\n    To reverence Winter’s silver hair;\r\n    A handsome hostess, merry host,\r\n    A pot of ale now and a toast,\r\n    Tobacco and a good coal fire,\r\n    Are things this season doth require.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Poor Robin’s Almanack, 1684.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not been long at the inn when a post-chaise drove up to the door.\r\nA young gentleman stept out, and by the light of the lamps I caught a\r\nglimpse of a countenance which I thought I knew. I moved forward to\r\nget a nearer view, when his eye caught mine. I was not mistaken; it was\r\nFrank Bracebridge, a sprightly, good-humored young fellow with whom I\r\nhad once travelled on the Continent. Our meeting was extremely cordial,\r\nfor the countenance of an old fellow-traveller always brings up\r\nthe recollection of a thousand pleasant scenes, odd adventures, and\r\nexcellent jokes. To discuss all these in a transient interview at an\r\ninn was impossible; and, finding that I was not pressed for time and was\r\nmerely making a tour of observation, he insisted that I should give him\r\na day or two at his father’s country-seat, to which he was going to pass\r\nthe holidays and which lay at a few miles’ distance. “It is better\r\nthan eating a solitary Christmas dinner at an inn,” said he, “and I can\r\nassure you of a hearty welcome in something of the old-fashioned style.”\r\n His reasoning was cogent, and I must confess the preparation I had seen\r\nfor universal festivity and social enjoyment had made me feel a little\r\nimpatient of my loneliness. I closed, therefore, at once with his\r\ninvitation; the chaise drove up to the door, and in a few moments I was\r\non my way to the family mansion of the Bracebridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EVE.\r\n\r\n    Saint Francis and Saint Benedight\r\n    Blesse this house from wicked wight;\r\n    From the night-mare and the goblin,\r\n    That is hight good fellow Robin;\r\n    Keep it from all evil spirits,\r\n    Fairies, weezels, rats, and ferrets:\r\n        From curfew time\r\n        To the next prime.\r\n                       CARTWRIGHT.\r\n\r\nIT was a brilliant moonlight night, but extremely cold; our chaise\r\nwhirled rapidly over the frozen ground; the postboy smacked his whip\r\nincessantly, and a part of the time his horses were on a gallop. “He\r\nknows where he is going,” said my companion, laughing, “and is eager to\r\narrive in time for some of the merriment and good cheer of the servants’\r\nhall. My father, you must know, is a bigoted devotee of the old school,\r\nand prides himself upon keeping up something of old English hospitality.\r\nHe is a tolerable specimen of what you will rarely meet with nowadays\r\nin its purity, the old English country gentleman; for our men of fortune\r\nspend so much of their time in town, and fashion is carried so much into\r\nthe country, that the strong rich peculiarities of ancient rural life\r\nare almost polished away. My father, however, from early years, took\r\nhonest Peacham* for his textbook, instead of Chesterfield; he determined\r\nin his own mind that there was no condition more truly honorable and\r\nenviable than that of a country gentleman on his paternal lands, and\r\ntherefore passes the whole of his time on his estate. He is a strenuous\r\nadvocate for the revival of the old rural games and holiday observances,\r\nand is deeply read in the writers, ancient and modern, who have treated\r\non the subject. Indeed, his favorite range of reading is among the\r\nauthors who flourished at least two centuries since, who, he insists,\r\nwrote and thought more like true Englishmen than any of their\r\nsuccessors. He even regrets sometimes that he had not been born a few\r\ncenturies earlier, when England was itself and had its peculiar manners\r\nand customs. As he lives at some distance from the main road, in rather\r\na lonely part of the country, without any rival gentry near him, he has\r\nthat most enviable of all blessings to an Englishman--an opportunity\r\nof indulging the bent of his own humor without molestation. Being\r\nrepresentative of the oldest family in the neighborhood, and a great\r\npart of the peasantry being his tenants, he is much looked up to, and\r\nin general is known simply by the appellation of ‘The Squire’--a title\r\nwhich has been accorded to the head of the family since time immemorial.\r\nI think it best to give you these hints about my worthy old father, to\r\nprepare you for any eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Peacham’s Complete Gentleman, 1622.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had passed for some time along the wall of a park, and at length the\r\nchaise stopped at the gate. It was in a heavy, magnificent old style,\r\nof iron bars fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers.\r\nThe huge square columns that supported the gate were surmounted by the\r\nfamily crest. Close adjoining was the porter’s lodge, sheltered under\r\ndark fir trees and almost buried in shrubbery.\r\n\r\nThe postboy rang a large porter’s bell, which resounded though the still\r\nfrosty air, and was answered by the distant barking of dogs, with which\r\nthe mansion-house seemed garrisoned. An old woman immediately appeared\r\nat the gate. As the moonlight fell strongly upon her, I had a full view\r\nof a little primitive dame, dressed very much in the antique taste, with\r\na neat kerchief and stomacher, and her silver hair peeping from under a\r\ncap of snowy whiteness. She came curtseying forth, with many expressions\r\nof simple joy at seeing her young master. Her husband, it seemed, was up\r\nat the house keeping Christmas Eve in the servants’ hall; they could\r\nnot do without him, as he was the best hand at a song and story in the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nMy friend proposed that we should alight and walk through the park to\r\nthe hall, which was at no great distance, while the chaise should follow\r\non. Our road wound through a noble avenue of trees, among the naked\r\nbranches of which the moon glittered as she rolled through the deep\r\nvault of a cloudless sky. The lawn beyond was sheeted with a slight\r\ncovering of snow, which here and there sparkled as the moonbeams caught\r\na frosty crystal, and at a distance might be seen a thin transparent\r\nvapor stealing up from the low grounds and threatening gradually to\r\nshroud the landscape.\r\n\r\nMy companion looked around him with transport. “How often,” said he,\r\n“have I scampered up this avenue on returning home on school vacations!\r\nHow often have I played under these trees when a boy! I feel a degree of\r\nfilial reverence for them, as we look up to those who have cherished us\r\nin childhood. My father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays\r\nand having us around him on family festivals. He used to direct and\r\nsuperintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the\r\nstudies of their children. He was very particular that we should play\r\nthe old English games according to their original form, and consulted\r\nold books for precedent and authority for every ‘merrie disport;’ yet I\r\nassure you there never was pedantry so delightful. It was the policy\r\nof the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the\r\nhappiest place in the world; and I value this delicious home-feeling as\r\none of the choicest gifts a parent could bestow.”\r\n\r\nWe were interrupted by the clamor of a troop of dogs of all sorts and\r\nsizes, “mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound, and curs of lower degree,”\r\n that disturbed by the ring of the porter’s bell and the rattling of the\r\nchaise, came bounding, open-mouthed, across the lawn.\r\n\r\n     “‘----The little dogs and all,  Tray, Blanch,\r\n     and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me!’”\r\n\r\ncried Bracebridge, laughing. At the sound of his voice the bark was\r\nchanged into a yelp of delight, and in a moment he was surrounded and\r\nalmost overpowered by the caresses of the faithful animals.\r\n\r\nWe had now come in full view of the old family mansion, partly thrown in\r\ndeep shadow and partly lit up by the cold moonshine. It was an irregular\r\nbuilding of some magnitude, and seemed to be of the architecture of\r\ndifferent periods. One wing was evidently very ancient, with heavy\r\nstone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy, from among\r\nthe foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass glittered\r\nwith the moonbeams. The rest of the house was in the French taste of\r\nCharles the Second’s time, having been repaired and altered, as my\r\nfriend told me, by one of his ancestors who returned with that monarch\r\nat the Restoration. The grounds about the house were laid out in the\r\nold formal manner of artificial flower-beds, clipped shrubberies, raised\r\nterraces, and heavy stone balustrades, ornamented with urns, a leaden\r\nstatue or two, and a jet of water. The old gentleman, I was told, was\r\nextremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its\r\noriginal state. He admired this fashion in gardening; it had an air\r\nof magnificence, was courtly and noble, and befitting good old family\r\nstyle. The boasted imitation of Nature in modern gardening had sprung\r\nup with modern republican notions, but did not suit a monarchical\r\ngovernment; it smacked of the leveling system. I could not help smiling\r\nat this introduction of politics into gardening, though I expressed some\r\napprehension that I should find the old gentleman rather intolerant\r\nin his creed. Frank assured me, however, that it was almost the only\r\ninstance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with politics; and\r\nhe believed that he had got this notion from a member of Parliament who\r\nonce passed a few weeks with him. The squire was glad of any argument\r\nto defend his clipped yew trees and formal terraces, which had been\r\noccasionally attacked by modern landscape gardeners.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the house we heard the sound of music, and now and\r\nthen a burst of laughter from one end of the building. This, Bracebridge\r\nsaid, must proceed from the servants’ hall, where a great deal of\r\nrevelry was permitted, and even encouraged, by the squire throughout the\r\ntwelve days of Christmas, provided everything was done conformably to\r\nancient usage. Here were kept up the old games of hoodman blind, shoe\r\nthe wild mare, hot cockles, steal the white loaf, bob apple, and snap\r\ndragon; the Yule-clog and Christmas candle were regularly burnt, and the\r\nmistletoe with its white berries hung up, to the imminent peril of all\r\nthe pretty housemaids.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The mistletoe is still hung up in farm-houses and kitchens\r\n     at Christmas, and the young men have the privilege of\r\n     kissing the girls under it, plucking each time a berry from\r\n     the bush. When the berries are all plucked the privilege\r\n     ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo intent were the servants upon their sports that we had to ring\r\nrepeatedly before we could make ourselves heard. On our arrival being\r\nannounced the squire came out to receive us, accompanied by his two\r\nother sons--one a young officer in the army, home on a leave of absence;\r\nthe other an Oxonian, just from the university. The squire was a fine\r\nhealthy-looking old gentleman, with silver hair curling lightly round an\r\nopen florid countenance, in which the physiognomist, with the advantage,\r\nlike myself, of a previous hint or two, might discover a singular\r\nmixture of whim and benevolence.\r\n\r\nThe family meeting was warm and affectionate; as the evening was far\r\nadvanced, the squire would not permit us to change our travelling\r\ndresses, but ushered us at once to the company, which was assembled in\r\na large old-fashioned hall. It was composed of different branches of a\r\nnumerous family connection, where there were the usual proportion of old\r\nuncles and aunts, comfortable married dames, superannuated spinsters,\r\nblooming country cousins, half-fledged striplings, and bright-eyed\r\nboarding-school hoydens. They were variously occupied--some at a round\r\ngame of cards; others conversing around the fireplace; at one end of the\r\nhall was a group of the young folks, some nearly grown up, others of\r\na more tender and budding age, fully engrossed by a merry game; and a\r\nprofusion of wooden horses, penny trumpets, and tattered dolls about\r\nthe floor showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings who, having\r\nfrolicked through a happy day, had been carried off to slumber through a\r\npeaceful night.\r\n\r\nWhile the mutual greetings were going on between young Bracebridge and\r\nhis relatives I had time to scan the apartment. I have called it a hall,\r\nfor so it had certainly been in old times, and the squire had evidently\r\nendeavored to restore it to something of its primitive state. Over\r\nthe heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior\r\nin armor, standing by a white horse, and on the opposite wall hung a\r\nhelmet, buckler, and lance. At one end an enormous pair of antlers were\r\ninserted in the wall, the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend\r\nhats, whips, and spurs, and in the corners of the apartment were\r\nfowling-pieces, fishing-rods, and other sporting implements. The\r\nfurniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days, though some\r\narticles of modern convenience had been added and the oaken floor had\r\nbeen carpeted, so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlor and\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nThe grate had been removed from the wide overwhelming fireplace to\r\nmake way for a fire of wood, in the midst of which was an enormous log\r\nglowing and blazing, and sending forth a vast volume of light and heat:\r\nthis, I understood, was the Yule-clog, which the squire was particular\r\nin having brought in and illumined on a Christmas Eve, according to\r\nancient custom.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The Yule-clog is a great log of wood, sometimes the root\r\n     of a tree, brought into the house with great ceremony on\r\n     Christmas Eve, laid in the fireplace, and lighted with the\r\n     brand of last year’s clog. While it lasted there was great\r\n     drinking, singing, and telling of tales. Sometimes it was\r\n     accompanied by Christmas candles; but in the cottages the\r\n     only light was from the ruddy blaze of the great wood fire.\r\n     The Yule-clog was to burn all night; if it went out, it was\r\n     considered a sign of ill luck.\r\n\r\nHerrick mentions it in one of his songs:\r\n\r\n        Come, bring with a noise,\r\n        My metric, merrie boys,\r\n    The Christmas Log to the firing;\r\n        While my good dame, she\r\n        Bids ye all be free,\r\n    And drink to your hearts’ desiring.\r\n\r\nThe Yule-clog is still burnt in many farm-houses and kitchens in\r\nEngland, particularly in the north, and there are several superstitions\r\nconnected with it among the peasantry. If a squinting person come to the\r\nhouse while it is burning, or a person barefooted, it is considered an\r\nill omen. The brand remaining from the Yule-clog is carefully put away\r\nto light the next year’s Christmas fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was really delightful to see the old squire seated in his hereditary\r\nelbow-chair by the hospitable fireside of his ancestors, and looking\r\naround him like the sun of a system, beaming warmth and gladness to\r\nevery heart. Even the very dog that lay stretched at his feet, as he\r\nlazily shifted his position and yawned would look fondly up in his\r\nmaster’s face, wag his tail against the floor, and stretch himself again\r\nto sleep, confident of kindness and protection. There is an emanation\r\nfrom the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described, but is\r\nimmediately felt and puts the stranger at once at his ease. I had not\r\nbeen seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy old\r\ncavalier before I found myself as much at home as if I had been one of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nSupper was announced shortly after our arrival. It was served up in a\r\nspacious oaken chamber, the panels of which shone with wax, and around\r\nwhich were several family portraits decorated with holly and ivy.\r\nBesides the accustomed lights, two great wax tapers, called Christmas\r\ncandles, wreathed with greens, were placed on a highly polished beaufet\r\namong the family plate. The table was abundantly spread with substantial\r\nfare; but the squire made his supper of frumenty, a dish made of wheat\r\ncakes boiled in milk with rich spices, being a standing dish in old\r\ntimes for Christmas Eve. I was happy to find my old friend, minced pie,\r\nin the retinue of the feast and, finding him to be perfectly orthodox,\r\nand that I need not be ashamed of my predilection, I greeted him with\r\nall the warmth wherewith we usually greet an old and very genteel\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe mirth of the company was greatly promoted by the humors of an\r\neccentric personage whom Mr. Bracebridge always addressed with the\r\nquaint appellation of Master Simon. He was a tight brisk little man,\r\nwith the air of an arrant old bachelor. His nose was shaped like the\r\nbill of a parrot; his face slightly pitted with the small-pox, with a\r\ndry perpetual bloom on it, like a frostbitten leaf in autumn. He had an\r\neye of great quickness and vivacity, with a drollery and lurking waggery\r\nof expression that was irresistible. He was evidently the wit of the\r\nfamily, dealing very much in sly jokes and innuendoes with the ladies,\r\nand making infinite merriment by harping upon old themes, which,\r\nunfortunately, my ignorance of the family chronicles did not permit\r\nme to enjoy. It seemed to be his great delight during supper to keep\r\na young girl next to him in a continual agony of stifled laughter, in\r\nspite of her awe of the reproving looks of her mother, who sat opposite.\r\nIndeed, he was the idol of the younger part of the company, who laughed\r\nat everything he said or did and at every turn of his countenance.\r\nI could not wonder at it; for he must have been a miracle of\r\naccomplishments in their eyes. He could imitate Punch and Judy; make\r\nan old woman of his hand, with the assistance of a burnt cork and\r\npocket-handkerchief; and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature\r\nthat the young folks were ready to die with laughing.\r\n\r\nI was let briefly into his history by Frank Bracebridge. He was an old\r\nbachelor, of a small independent income, which by careful management was\r\nsufficient for all his wants. He revolved through the family system\r\nlike a vagrant comet in its orbit, sometimes visiting one branch, and\r\nsometimes another quite remote, as is often the case with gentlemen of\r\nextensive connections and small fortunes in England. He had a chirping,\r\nbuoyant disposition, always enjoying the present moment; and his\r\nfrequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those\r\nrusty, unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so\r\nuncharitably charged. He was a complete family chronicle, being versed\r\nin the genealogy, history, and intermarriages of the whole house of\r\nBracebridge, which made him a great favorite with the old folks; he was\r\na beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters, among whom\r\nhe was habitually considered rather a young fellow; and he was master\r\nof the revels among the children, so that there was not a more popular\r\nbeing in the sphere in which he moved than Mr. Simon Bracebridge. Of\r\nlate years he had resided almost entirely with the squire, to whom he\r\nhad become a factotum, and whom he particularly delighted by jumping\r\nwith his humor in respect to old times and by having a scrap of an\r\nold song to suit every occasion. We had presently a specimen of his\r\nlast-mentioned talent, for no sooner was supper removed and spiced wines\r\nand other beverages peculiar to the season introduced, than Master Simon\r\nwas called on for a good old Christmas song. He bethought himself for a\r\nmoment, and then, with a sparkle of the eye and a voice that was by no\r\nmeans bad, excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto like the\r\nnotes of a split reed, he quavered forth a quaint old ditty:\r\n\r\n        Now Christmas is come,\r\n        Let us beat up the drum,\r\n    And call all our neighbors together;\r\n        And when they appear,\r\n        Let us make them such cheer,\r\n    As will keep out the wind and the weather, &c.\r\n\r\nThe supper had disposed every one to gayety, and an old harper was\r\nsummoned from the servants’ hall, where he had been strumming all the\r\nevening, and to all appearance comforting himself with some of the\r\nsquire’s home-brewed. He was a kind of hanger-on, I was told, of the\r\nestablishment, and, though ostensibly a resident of the village, was\r\noftener to be found in the squire’s kitchen than his own home, the old\r\ngentleman being fond of the sound of “harp in hall.”\r\n\r\nThe dance, like most dances after supper, was a merry one: some of the\r\nolder folks joined in it, and the squire himself figured down several\r\ncouple with a partner with whom he affirmed he had danced at every\r\nChristmas for nearly half a century. Master Simon, who seemed to be a\r\nkind of connecting link between the old times and the new, and to\r\nbe withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments,\r\nevidently piqued himself on his dancing, and was endeavoring to gain\r\ncredit by the heel and toe, rigadoon, and other graces of the ancient\r\nschool; but he had unluckily assorted himself with a little romping girl\r\nfrom boarding-school, who by her wild vivacity kept him continually on\r\nthe stretch and defeated all his sober attempts at elegance: such are\r\nthe ill-sorted matches to which antique gentlemen are unfortunately\r\nprone.\r\n\r\nThe young Oxonian, on the contrary, had led out one of his maiden aunts,\r\non whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity: he\r\nwas full of practical jokes, and his delight was to tease his aunts and\r\ncousins, yet, like all madcap youngsters, he was a universal favorite\r\namong the women. The most interesting couple in the dance was the\r\nyoung officer and a ward of the squire’s, a beautiful blushing girl of\r\nseventeen. From several shy glances which I had noticed in the course of\r\nthe evening I suspected there was a little kindness growing up between\r\nthem; and indeed the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a\r\nromantic girl. He was tall, slender, and handsome, and, like most\r\nyoung British officers of late years, had picked up various small\r\naccomplishments on the Continent: he could talk French and Italian, draw\r\nlandscapes, sing very tolerably, dance divinely, but, above all, he had\r\nbeen wounded at Waterloo. What girl of seventeen, well read in poetry\r\nand romance, could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection?\r\n\r\nThe moment the dance was over he caught up a guitar, and, lolling\r\nagainst the old marble fireplace in an attitude which I am half inclined\r\nto suspect was studied, began the little French air of the Troubadour.\r\nThe squire, however, exclaimed against having anything on Christmas Eve\r\nbut good old English; upon which the young minstrel, casting up his eye\r\nfor a moment as if in an effort of memory, struck into another strain,\r\nand with a charming air of gallantry gave Herrick’s “Night-Piece to\r\nJulia:”\r\n\r\n        Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,\r\n        The shooting stars attend thee,\r\n        And the elves also,\r\n        Whose little eyes glow\r\n    Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.\r\n\r\n    No Will-o’-the-Wisp mislight thee;\r\n    Nor snake nor slow-worm bite thee;\r\n        But on thy way,\r\n        Not making a stay,\r\n    Since ghost there is none to affright thee,\r\n\r\n    Then let not the dark thee cumber;\r\n    What though the moon does slumber,\r\n        The stars of the night\r\n        Will lend thee their light,\r\n    Like tapers clear without number.\r\n\r\n    Then, Julia, let me woo thee,\r\n    Thus, thus to come unto me,\r\n        And when I shall meet\r\n        Thy silvery feet,\r\n    My soul I’ll pour into thee.\r\n\r\nThe song might or might not have been intended in compliment to the\r\nfair Julia, for so I found his partner was called; she, however, was\r\ncertainly unconscious of any such application, for she never looked\r\nat the singer, but kept her eyes cast upon the floor. Her face was\r\nsuffused, it is true, with a beautiful blush, and there was a gentle\r\nheaving of the bosom, but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise\r\nof the dance; indeed, so great was her indifference that she amused\r\nherself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house flowers,\r\nand by the time the song was concluded the nosegay lay in ruins on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe party now broke up for the night with the kind-hearted old custom of\r\nshaking hands. As I passed through the hall on my way to my chamber, the\r\ndying embers of the Yule-clog still sent forth a dusky glow, and had it\r\nnot been the season when “no spirit dares stir abroad,” I should have\r\nbeen half tempted to steal from my room at midnight and peep whether the\r\nfairies might not be at their revels about the hearth.\r\n\r\nMy chamber was in the old part of the mansion, the ponderous furniture\r\nof which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants. The room\r\nwas panelled, with cornices of heavy carved work, in which flowers and\r\ngrotesque faces were strangely intermingled, and a row of black-looking\r\nportraits stared mournfully at me from the walls. The bed was of rich\r\nthough faded damask, with a lofty tester, and stood in a niche opposite\r\na bow window. I had scarcely got into bed when a strain of music seemed\r\nto break forth in the air just below the window. I listened, and found\r\nit proceeded from a band which I concluded to be the Waits from some\r\nneighboring village. They went round the house, playing under the\r\nwindows. I drew aside the curtains to hear them more distinctly.\r\nThe moonbeams fell through the upper part of the casement; partially\r\nlighting up the antiquated apartment. The sounds, as they receded,\r\nbecame more soft and aerial, and seemed to accord with the quiet and\r\nmoonlight. I listened and listened--they became more and more tender and\r\nremote, and, as they gradually died away, my head sunk upon the pillow\r\nand I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DAY.\r\n\r\n    Dark and dull night, flie hence away,\r\n    And give the honor to this day\r\n    That sees December turn’d to May.\r\n   .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Why does the chilling winter’s morne\r\n    Smile like a field beset with corn?\r\n    Or smell like to a meade new-shorne,\r\n    Thus on the sudden?--come and see\r\n    The cause why things thus fragrant be.\r\n                                     HERRICK.\r\n\r\nWHEN I woke the next morning it seemed as if all the events of the\r\npreceding evening had been a dream, and nothing but the identity of the\r\nancient chamber convinced me of their reality. While I lay musing on my\r\npillow I heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door,\r\nand a whispering consultation. Presently a choir of small voices chanted\r\nforth an old Christmas carol, the burden of which was--\r\n\r\n    Rejoice, our Saviour he was born\r\n    On Christmas Day in the morning.\r\n\r\nI rose softly, slipt on my clothes, opened the door suddenly, and beheld\r\none of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter could\r\nimagine. It consisted of a boy and two girls, the eldest not more than\r\nsix, and lovely as seraphs. They were going the rounds of the house and\r\nsinging at every chamber door, but my sudden appearance frightened them\r\ninto mute bashfulness. They remained for a moment playing on their lips\r\nwith their fingers, and now and then stealing a shy glance from under\r\ntheir eyebrows, until, as if by one impulse, they scampered away, and as\r\nthey turned an angle of the gallery I heard them laughing in triumph at\r\ntheir escape.\r\n\r\nEverything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this\r\nstronghold of old-fashioned hospitality. The window of my chamber looked\r\nout upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape. There was\r\na sloping lawn, a fine stream winding at the foot of it, and a tract of\r\npark beyond, with noble clumps of trees and herds of deer. At a distance\r\nwas a neat hamlet, with the smoke from the cottage chimneys hanging over\r\nit, and a church with its dark spire in strong relief against the clear\r\ncold sky. The house was surrounded with evergreens, according to the\r\nEnglish custom, which would have given almost an appearance of summer;\r\nbut the morning was extremely frosty; the light vapor of the preceding\r\nevening had been precipitated by the cold, and covered all the trees and\r\nevery blade of grass with its fine crystalizations. The rays of a bright\r\nmorning sun had a dazzling effect among the glittering foliage. A robin,\r\nperched upon the top of a mountain-ash that hung its clusters of red\r\nberries just before my window, was basking himself in the sunshine\r\nand piping a few querulous notes, and a peacock was displaying all\r\nthe glories of his train and strutting with the pride and gravity of a\r\nSpanish grandee on the terrace walk below.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely dressed myself when a servant appeared to invite me to\r\nfamily prayers. He showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing\r\nof the house, where I found the principal part of the family already\r\nassembled in a kind of gallery furnished with cushions, hassocks, and\r\nlarge prayer-books; the servants were seated on benches below. The old\r\ngentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery, and Master\r\nSimon acted as clerk and made the responses; and I must do him the\r\njustice to say that he acquitted himself with great gravity and decorum.\r\n\r\nThe service was followed by a Christmas carol, which Mr. Bracebridge\r\nhimself had constructed from a poem of his favorite author, Herrick, and\r\nit had been adapted to an old church melody by Master Simon. As there\r\nwere several good voices among the household, the effect was extremely\r\npleasing, but I was particularly gratified by the exaltation of heart\r\nand sudden sally of grateful feeling with which the worthy squire\r\ndelivered one stanza, his eye glistening and his voice rambling out of\r\nall the bounds of time and tune:\r\n\r\n    “‘Tis Thou that crown’st my glittering hearth\r\n          With guiltless mirth,\r\n      And givest me Wassaile bowles to drink\r\n          Spiced to the brink;\r\n      Lord, ‘tis Thy plenty-dropping hand\r\n          That soiles my land:\r\n      And giv’st me for my bushell sowne,\r\n          Twice ten for one.”\r\n\r\nI afterwards understood that early morning service was read on every\r\nSunday and saint’s day throughout the year, either by Mr. Bracebridge or\r\nby some member of the family. It was once almost universally the case\r\nat the seats of the nobility and gentry of England, and it is much to\r\nbe regretted that the custom is falling into neglect; for the dullest\r\nobserver must be sensible of the order and serenity prevalent in those\r\nhouseholds where the occasional exercise of a beautiful form of worship\r\nin the morning gives, as it were, the keynote to every temper for the\r\nday and attunes every spirit to harmony.\r\n\r\nOur breakfast consisted of what the squire denominated true old English\r\nfare. He indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts\r\nof tea and toast, which he censured as among the causes of modern\r\neffeminacy and weak nerves and the decline of old English heartiness;\r\nand, though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his\r\nguests, yet there was a brave display of cold meats, wine, and ale on\r\nthe sideboard.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I walked about the grounds with Frank Bracebridge\r\nand Master Simon, or Mr. Simon, as he was called by everybody but the\r\nsquire. We were escorted by a number of gentlemanlike dogs, that seemed\r\nloungers about the establishment, from the frisking spaniel to the\r\nsteady old stag-hound, the last of which was of a race that had been\r\nin the family time out of mind; they were all obedient to a dog-whistle\r\nwhich hung to Master Simon’s buttonhole, and in the midst of their\r\ngambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nThe old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine\r\nthan by pale moonlight; and I could not but feel the force of the\r\nsquire’s idea that the formal terraces, heavily moulded balustrades, and\r\nclipped yew trees carried with them an air of proud aristocracy. There\r\nappeared to be an unusual number of peacocks about the place, and I was\r\nmaking some remarks upon what I termed a flock of them that were basking\r\nunder a sunny wall, when I was gently corrected in my phraseology\r\nby Master Simon, who told me that according to the most ancient and\r\napproved treatise on hunting I must say a muster of peacocks. “In the\r\nsame way,” added he, with a slight air of pedantry, “we say a flight\r\nof doves or swallows, a bevy of quails, a herd of deer, of wrens, or\r\ncranes, a skulk of foxes, or a building of rooks.” He went on to inform\r\nme that, according to Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, we ought to ascribe to\r\nthis bird “both understanding and glory; for, being praised, he will\r\npresently set up his tail, chiefly against the sun, to the intent you\r\nmay the better behold the beauty thereof. But at the fall of the leaf,\r\nwhen his tail falleth, he will mourn and hide himself in corners till\r\nhis tail come again as it was.”\r\n\r\nI could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so\r\nwhimsical a subject; but I found that the peacocks were birds of some\r\nconsequence at the hall, for Frank Bracebridge informed me that they\r\nwere great favorites with his father, who was extremely careful to keep\r\nup the breed; partly because they belonged to chivalry, and were in\r\ngreat request at the stately banquets of the olden time, and partly\r\nbecause they had a pomp and magnificence about them highly becoming an\r\nold family mansion. Nothing, he was accustomed to say, had an air of\r\ngreater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone\r\nbalustrade.\r\n\r\nMaster Simon had now to hurry off, having an appointment at the parish\r\nchurch with the village choristers, who were to perform some music of\r\nhis selection. There was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful\r\nflow of animal spirits of the little man; and I confess I had been\r\nsomewhat surprised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly\r\nwere not in the range of every-day reading. I mentioned this last\r\ncircumstance to Frank Bracebridge, who told me with a smile that Master\r\nSimon’s whole stock of erudition was confined to some half a dozen old\r\nauthors, which the squire had put into his hands, and which he read over\r\nand over whenever he had a studious fit, as he sometimes had on a\r\nrainy day or a long winter evening. Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s Book of\r\nHusbandry, Markham’s Country Contentments, the Tretyse of Hunting, by\r\nSir Thomas Cockayne, Knight, Isaac Walton’s Angler, and two or three\r\nmore such ancient worthies of the pen were his standard authorities;\r\nand, like all men who know but a few books, he looked up to them with a\r\nkind of idolatry and quoted them on all occasions. As to his songs,\r\nthey were chiefly picked out of old books in the squire’s library, and\r\nadapted to tunes that were popular among the choice spirits of the last\r\ncentury. His practical application of scraps of literature, however, had\r\ncaused him to be looked upon as a prodigy of book-knowledge by all the\r\ngrooms, huntsmen, and small sportsmen of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking we heard the distant toll of the village bell,\r\nand I was told that the squire was a little particular in having his\r\nhousehold at church on a Christmas morning, considering it a day of\r\npouring out of thanks and rejoicing; for, as old Tusser observed,--\r\n\r\n     “At Christmas be merry, and thankful withal,\r\n     And feast thy poor neighbors, the great with the small.”\r\n\r\n“If you are disposed to go to church,” said Frank Bracebridge, “I can\r\npromise you a specimen of my cousin Simon’s musical achievements. As the\r\nchurch is destitute of an organ, he has formed a band from the village\r\namateurs, and established a musical club for their improvement; he has\r\nalso sorted a choir, as he sorted my father’s pack of hounds, according\r\nto the directions of Jervaise Markham in his Country Contentments: for\r\nthe bass he has sought out all the ‘deep, solemn mouths,’ and for the\r\ntenor the ‘loud-ringing mouths,’ among the country bumpkins, and for\r\n‘sweet-mouths,’ he has culled-with curious taste among the prettiest\r\nlasses in the neighborhood; though these last, he affirms, are the most\r\ndifficult to keep in tune, your pretty female singer being exceedingly\r\nwayward and capricious, and very liable to accident.”\r\n\r\nAs the morning, though frosty, was remarkably fine and clear, the most\r\nof the family walked to the church, which was a very old building of\r\ngray stone, and stood near a village about half a mile from the park\r\ngate. Adjoining it was a low snug parsonage which seemed coeval with the\r\nchurch. The front of it was perfectly matted with a yew tree that had\r\nbeen trained against its walls, through the dense foliage of which\r\napertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique\r\nlattices. As we passed this sheltered nest the parson issued forth and\r\npreceded us.\r\n\r\nI had expected to see a sleek well-conditioned pastor, such as is often\r\nfound in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron’s table, but I\r\nwas disappointed. The parson was a little, meagre, black-looking man,\r\nwith a grizzled wig that was too wide and stood off from each ear; so\r\nthat his head seemed to have shrunk away within it, like a dried filbert\r\nin its shell. He wore a rusty coat, with great skirts and pockets that\r\nwould have held the church Bible and prayer-book: and his small legs\r\nseemed still smaller from being planted in large shoes decorated with\r\nenormous buckles.\r\n\r\nI was informed by Frank Bracebridge that the parson had been a chum of\r\nhis father’s at Oxford, and had received this living shortly after the\r\nlatter had come to his estate. He was a complete black-letter hunter,\r\nand would scarcely read a work printed in the Roman character. The\r\neditions of Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde were his delight, and he was\r\nindefatigable in his researches after such old English writers as have\r\nfallen into oblivion from their worthlessness. In deference, perhaps, to\r\nthe notions of Mr. Bracebridge he had made diligent investigations into\r\nthe festive rites and holiday customs of former times, and had been as\r\nzealous in the inquiry as if he had been a boon companion; but it was\r\nmerely with that plodding spirit with which men of adust temperament\r\nfollow up any track of study, merely because it is denominated learning;\r\nindifferent to its intrinsic nature, whether it be the illustration of\r\nthe wisdom or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity. He had pored\r\nover these old volumes so intensely that they seemed to have been\r\nreflected into his countenance; which, if the face be indeed an index of\r\nthe mind, might be compared to a title-page of black-letter.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the church-porch we found the parson rebuking the\r\ngray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which\r\nthe church was decorated. It was, he observed, an unholy plant, profaned\r\nby having been used by the Druids in their mystic ceremonies; and,\r\nthough it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of\r\nhalls and kitchens, yet it had been deemed by the Fathers of the Church\r\nas unhallowed and totally unfit for sacred purposes. So tenacious was\r\nhe on this point that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great\r\npart of the humble trophies of his taste before the parson would consent\r\nto enter upon the service of the day.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the church was venerable, but simple; on the walls were\r\nseveral mural monuments of the Bracebridges, and just beside the altar\r\nwas a tomb of ancient workmanship, on which lay the effigy of a warrior\r\nin armor with his legs crossed, a sign of his having been a crusader. I\r\nwas told it was one of the family who had signalized himself in the Holy\r\nLand, and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the hall.\r\n\r\nDuring service Master Simon stood up in the pew and repeated the\r\nresponses very audibly, evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion\r\npunctually observed by a gentleman of the old school and a man of old\r\nfamily connections. I observed too that he turned over the leaves of a\r\nfolio prayer-book with something of a flourish; possibly to show off an\r\nenormous seal-ring which enriched one of his fingers and which had the\r\nlook of a family relic. But he was evidently most solicitous about\r\nthe musical part of the service, keeping his eye fixed intently on the\r\nchoir, and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra was in a small gallery, and presented a most whimsical\r\ngrouping of heads piled one above the other, among which I particularly\r\nnoticed that of the village tailor, a pale fellow with a retreating\r\nforehead and chin, who played on the clarinet, and seemed to have blown\r\nhis face to a point; and there was another, a short pursy man, stooping\r\nand laboring at a bass-viol, so as to show nothing but the top of a\r\nround bald head, like the egg of an ostrich. There were two or three\r\npretty faces among the female singers, to which the keen air of a frosty\r\nmorning had given a bright rosy tint; but the gentlemen choristers had\r\nevidently been chosen, like old Cremona fiddles, more for tone than\r\nlooks; and as several had to sing from the same book, there were\r\nclusterings of odd physiognomies not unlike those groups of cherubs we\r\nsometimes see on country tombstones.\r\n\r\nThe usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well, the vocal\r\nparts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental, and some\r\nloitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling\r\nover a passage with prodigious celerity and clearing more bars than the\r\nkeenest fox-hunter to be in at the death. But the great trial was an\r\nanthem that had been prepared and arranged by Master Simon, and on which\r\nhe had founded great expectation. Unluckily, there was a blunder at the\r\nvery outset: the musicians became flurried; Master Simon was in a fever;\r\neverything went on lamely and irregularly until they came to a chorus\r\nbeginning, “Now let us sing with one accord,” which seemed to be a\r\nsignal for parting company: all became discord and confusion: each\r\nshifted for himself, and got to the end as well--or, rather, as soon--as\r\nhe could, excepting one old chorister in a pair of horn spectacles\r\nbestriding and pinching a long sonorous nose, who happened to stand\r\na little apart, and, being wrapped up in his own melody, kept on a\r\nquavering course, wriggling his head, ogling his book, and winding all\r\nup by a nasal solo of at least three bars’ duration.\r\n\r\nThe parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies\r\nof Christmas, and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day\r\nof thanksgiving but of rejoicing, supporting the correctness of his\r\nopinions by the earliest usages of the Church, and enforcing them by the\r\nauthorities of Theophilus of Caesarea, St. Cyprian, St. Chrysostom, St.\r\nAugustine, and a cloud more of saints and fathers, from whom he made\r\ncopious quotations. I was a little at a loss to perceive the necessity\r\nof such a mighty array of forces to maintain a point which no one\r\npresent seemed inclined to dispute; but I soon found that the good man\r\nhad a legion of ideal adversaries to contend with, having in the course\r\nof his researches on the subject of Christmas got completely embroiled\r\nin the sectarian controversies of the Revolution, when the Puritans made\r\nsuch a fierce assault upon the ceremonies of the Church, and poor old\r\nChristmas was driven out of the land by proclamation of Parliament.*\r\nThe worthy parson lived but with times past, and knew but little of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nShut up among worm-eaten tomes in the retirement of his antiquated\r\nlittle study, the pages of old times were to him as the gazettes of the\r\nday, while the era of the Revolution was mere modern history. He forgot\r\nthat nearly two centuries had elapsed since the fiery persecution of\r\npoor mince-pie throughout the land; when plum porridge was denounced as\r\n“mere popery,” and roast beef as anti-christian, and that Christmas had\r\nbeen brought in again triumphantly with the merry court of King Charles\r\nat the Restoration. He kindled into warmth with the ardor of his contest\r\nand the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to combat; he had a\r\nstubborn conflict with old Prynne and two or three other forgotten\r\nchampions of the Roundheads on the subject of Christmas festivity;\r\nand concluded by urging his hearers, in the most solemn and affecting\r\nmanner, to stand to the traditional customs of their fathers and feast\r\nand make merry on this joyful anniversary of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * From the “Flying Eagle,” a small gazette, published\r\n     December 24, 1652: “The House spent much time this day about\r\n     the business of the Navy, for settling the affairs at sea,\r\n     and before they rose, were presented with a terrible\r\n     remonstrance against Christmas day, grounded upon divine\r\n     Scriptures, 2 Cor. v. 16; I Cor. xv. 14, 17; and in honor of\r\n     the Lord’s Day, grounded upon these Scriptures, John xx. I;\r\n     Rev. i. 10; Psalms cxviii. 24; Lev. xxiii. 7, 11; Mark xv.\r\n     8; Psalms lxxxiv. 10, in which Christmas is called Anti-\r\n     christ’s masse, and those Masse-mongers and Papists who\r\n     observe it, etc. In consequence of which parliament spent\r\n     some time in consultation about the abolition of Christmas\r\n     day, passed orders to that effect, and resolved to sit on\r\n     the following day, which was commonly called Christmas day.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate\r\neffects, for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and\r\nall possessed with the gayety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their\r\npastor. The elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard, greeting\r\nand shaking hands, and the children ran about crying Ule! Ule! and\r\nrepeating some uncouth rhymes,* which the parson, who had joined us,\r\ninformed me had been handed down from days of yore. The villagers doffed\r\ntheir hats to the squire as he passed, giving him the good wishes of the\r\nseason with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity, and were invited by\r\nhim to the hall to take something to keep out the cold of the weather;\r\nand I heard blessings uttered by several of the poor, which convinced\r\nme that, in the midst of his enjoyments, the worthy old cavalier had not\r\nforgotten the true Christmas virtue of charity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * “Ule! Ule!\r\n       Three puddings in a pule;\r\n       Crack nuts and cry ule!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our way homeward his heart seemed overflowed with generous and happy\r\nfeelings. As we passed over a rising ground which commanded something\r\nof a prospect, the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our\r\nears: the squire paused for a few moments and looked around with an\r\nair of inexpressible benignity. The beauty of the day was of itself\r\nsufficient to inspire philanthropy. Notwithstanding the frostiness of\r\nthe morning the sun in his cloudless journey had acquired sufficient\r\npower to melt away the thin covering of snow from every southern\r\ndeclivity, and to bring out the living green which adorns an English\r\nlandscape even in mid-winter. Large tracts of smiling verdure contrasted\r\nwith the dazzling whiteness of the shaded slopes and hollows. Every\r\nsheltered bank on which the broad rays rested yielded its silver rill of\r\ncold and limpid water, glittering through the dripping grass, and sent\r\nup slight exhalations to contribute to the thin haze that hung just\r\nabove the surface of the earth. There was something truly cheering in\r\nthis triumph of warmth and verdure over the frosty thraldom of winter;\r\nit was, as the squire observed, an emblem of Christmas hospitality\r\nbreaking through the chills of ceremony and selfishness and thawing\r\nevery heart into a flow. He pointed with pleasure to the indications of\r\ngood cheer reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farm-houses and\r\nlow thatched cottages. “I love,” said he, “to see this day well kept\r\nby rich and poor; it is a great thing to have one day in the year,\r\nat least, when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go, and of\r\nhaving, as it were, the world all thrown open to you; and I am almost\r\ndisposed to join with Poor Robin in his malediction on every churlish\r\nenemy to this honest festival:\r\n\r\n    “‘Those who at Christmas do repine,\r\n       And would fain hence dispatch him,\r\n      May they with old Duke Humphry dine,\r\n       Or else may Squire Ketch catch’em.’”\r\n\r\nThe squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and\r\namusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower\r\norders and countenanced by the higher, when the old halls of castles and\r\nmanor-houses were thrown open at daylight; when the tables were covered\r\nwith brawn and beef and humming ale; when the harp and the carol\r\nresounded all day long; and when rich and poor were alike welcome to\r\nenter and make merry.* “Our old games and local customs,” said he, “had\r\na great effect in making the peasant fond of his home, and the promotion\r\nof them by the gentry made him fond of his lord. They made the times\r\nmerrier and kinder and better, and I can truly say, with one of our old\r\npoets,\r\n\r\n    “‘I like them well: the curious preciseness\r\n      And all-pretended gravity of those\r\n      That seek to banish hence these harmless sports,\r\n      Have thrust away much ancient honesty.’”\r\n\r\n“The nation,” continued he, “is altered; we have almost lost our\r\nsimple true-hearted peasantry. They have broken asunder from the higher\r\nclasses, and seem to think their interests are separate. They have\r\nbecome too knowing, and begin to read newspapers, listen to ale-house\r\npoliticians, and talk of reform. I think one mode to keep them in\r\ngood-humor in these hard times would be for the nobility and gentry to\r\npass more time on their estates, mingle more among the country-people,\r\nand set the merry old English games going again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “An English gentleman, at the opening of the great day--\r\n     i.e. on Christmas Day in the morning--had all his tenants\r\n     and neighbors enter his hall by daybreak. The strong beer\r\n     was broached, and the black-jacks went plentifully about,\r\n     with toast, sugar and nutmeg, and good Cheshire cheese. The\r\n     Hackin (the great sausage) must be boiled by daybreak, or\r\n     else two young men must take the maiden (i.e. the cook) by\r\n     the arms and run her round the market-place till she is\r\n     shamed of her laziness.”--Round about our Sea-Coal Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the good squire’s project for mitigating public discontent:\r\nand, indeed, he had once attempted to put his doctrine in practice, and\r\na few years before had kept open house during the holidays in the old\r\nstyle. The country-people, however, did not understand how to play their\r\nparts in the scene of hospitality; many uncouth circumstances occurred;\r\nthe manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country, and more\r\nbeggars drawn into the neighborhood in one week than the parish officers\r\ncould get rid of in a year. Since then he had contented himself with\r\ninviting the decent part of the neighboring peasantry to call at the\r\nhall on Christmas Day, and with distributing beef, and bread, and ale\r\namong the poor, that they might make merry in their own dwellings.\r\n\r\nWe had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a\r\ndistance. A band of country lads, without coats, their shirt-sleeves\r\nfancifully tied with ribbons, their hats decorated with greens, and\r\nclubs in their hands, was seen advancing up the avenue, followed by a\r\nlarge number of villagers and peasantry. They stopped before the hall\r\ndoor, where the music struck up a peculiar air, and the lads performed\r\na curious and intricate dance, advancing, retreating, and striking their\r\nclubs together, keeping exact time to the music; while one, whimsically\r\ncrowned with a fox’s skin, the tail of which flaunted down his back,\r\nkept capering round the skirts of the dance and rattling a Christmas box\r\nwith many antic gesticulations.\r\n\r\nThe squire eyed this fanciful exhibition with great interest and\r\ndelight, and gave me a full account of its origin, which he traced to\r\nthe times when the Romans held possession of the island, plainly proving\r\nthat this was a lineal descendant of the sword dance of the ancients.\r\n“It was now,” he said, “nearly extinct, but he had accidentally met\r\nwith traces of it in the neighborhood, and had encouraged its revival;\r\nthough, to tell the truth, it was too apt to be followed up by the rough\r\ncudgel play and broken heads in the evening.”\r\n\r\nAfter the dance was concluded the whole party was entertained with brawn\r\nand beef and stout home-brewed. The squire himself mingled among the\r\nrustics, and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference and\r\nregard. It is true I perceived two or three of the younger peasants, as\r\nthey were raising their tankards to their mouths, when the squire’s\r\nback was turned making something of a grimace, and giving each other the\r\nwink; but the moment they caught my eye they pulled grave faces and were\r\nexceedingly demure. With Master Simon, however, they all seemed more\r\nat their ease. His varied occupations and amusements had made him well\r\nknown throughout the neighborhood. He was a visitor at every farmhouse\r\nand cottage, gossiped with the farmers and their wives, romped with\r\ntheir daughters, and, like that type of a vagrant bachelor, the\r\nhumblebee, tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and\r\naffability. There is something genuine and affectionate in the gayety\r\nof the lower orders when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of\r\nthose above them; the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth,\r\nand a kind word or a small pleasantry frankly uttered by a patron\r\ngladdens the heart of the dependant more than oil and wine. When the\r\nsquire had retired the merriment increased, and there was much joking\r\nand laughter, particularly between Master Simon and a hale, ruddy-faced,\r\nwhite-headed farmer who appeared to be the wit of the village; for I\r\nobserved all his companions to wait with open months for his retorts,\r\nand burst into a gratuitous laugh before they could well understand\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe whole house indeed seemed abandoned to merriment: as I passed to my\r\nroom to dress for dinner, I heard the sound of music in a small court,\r\nand, looking through a window that commanded it, I perceived a band\r\nof wandering musicians with pandean pipes and tambourine; a pretty\r\ncoquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad, while\r\nseveral of the other servants were looking on. In the midst of her sport\r\nthe girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window, and, coloring up,\r\nran off with an air of roguish affected confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS DINNER.\r\n\r\n    Lo, now is come our joyful’st feast!\r\n        Let every man be jolly.\r\n    Eache roome with yvie leaves is drest,\r\n        And every post with holly.\r\n    Now all our neighbours’ chimneys smoke,\r\n        And Christmas blocks are burning;\r\n    Their ovens they with bak’t meats choke\r\n        And all their spits are turning.\r\n            Without the door let sorrow lie,\r\n            And if, for cold, it hap to die,\r\n            Wee’l bury ‘t in a Christmas pye,\r\n            And evermore be merry.\r\n                                 WITHERS, Juvenilia.\r\n\r\nI HAD finished my toilet, and was loitering with Frank Bracebridge in\r\nthe library, when we heard a distant thwacking sound, which he informed\r\nme was a signal for the serving up of the dinner. The squire kept up old\r\ncustoms in kitchen as well as hall, and the rolling-pin, struck upon the\r\ndresser by the cook, summoned the servants to carry in the meats.\r\n\r\n    Just in this nick the cook knock’d thrice,\r\n    And all the waiters in a trice\r\n        His summons did obey;\r\n    Each serving-man, with dish in hand,\r\n    March’d boldly up, like our train-band,\r\n    Presented and away.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Sir John Suckling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner was served up in the great hall, where the squire always held\r\nhis Christmas banquet. A blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped\r\non to warm the spacious apartment, and the flame went sparkling and\r\nwreathing up the wide-mouthed chimney. The great picture of the crusader\r\nand his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the\r\noccasion, and holly and ivy had like-wise been wreathed round the helmet\r\nand weapons on the opposite wall, which I understood were the arms of\r\nthe same warrior. I must own, by the by, I had strong doubts about\r\nthe authenticity of the painting and armor as having belonged to the\r\ncrusader, they certainly having the stamp of more recent days; but I was\r\ntold that the painting had been so considered time out of mind; and that\r\nas to the armor, it had been found in a lumber-room and elevated to its\r\npresent situation by the squire, who at once determined it to be the\r\narmor of the family hero; and as he was absolute authority on all\r\nsuch subjects in his own household, the matter had passed into current\r\nacceptation. A sideboard was set out just under this chivalric trophy,\r\non which was a display of plate that might have vied (at least in\r\nvariety) with Belshazzar’s parade of the vessels of the temple:\r\n“flagons, cans, cups, beakers, goblets, basins, and ewers,” the gorgeous\r\nutensils of good companionship that had gradually accumulated through\r\nmany generations of jovial housekeepers. Before these stood the two Yule\r\ncandles, beaming like two stars of the first magnitude; other lights\r\nwere distributed in branches, and the whole array glittered like a\r\nfirmament of silver.\r\n\r\nWe were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy,\r\nthe old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace and\r\ntwanging, his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody. Never\r\ndid Christmas board display a more goodly and gracious assemblage of\r\ncountenances; those who were not handsome were at least happy, and\r\nhappiness is a rare improver of your hard-favored visage. I always\r\nconsider an old English family as well worth studying as a collection of\r\nHolbein’s portraits or Albert Durer’s prints. There is much antiquarian\r\nlore to be acquired, much knowledge of the physiognomies of former\r\ntimes. Perhaps it may be from having continually before their eyes those\r\nrows of old family portraits, with which the mansions of this country\r\nare stocked; certain it is that the quaint features of antiquity are\r\noften most faithfully perpetuated in these ancient lines, and I have\r\ntraced an old family nose through a whole picture-gallery, legitimately\r\nhanded down from generation to generation almost from the time of the\r\nConquest. Something of the kind was to be observed in the worthy company\r\naround me. Many of their faces had evidently originated in a Gothic\r\nage, and been merely copied by succeeding generations; and there was one\r\nlittle girl in particular, of staid demeanor, with a high Roman nose\r\nand an antique vinegar aspect, who was a great favorite of the squire’s,\r\nbeing, as he said, a Bracebridge all over, and the very counterpart of\r\none of his ancestors who figured in the court of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe parson said grace, which was not a short familiar one, such as is\r\ncommonly addressed to the Deity in these unceremonious days, but a long,\r\ncourtly, well-worded one of the ancient school. There was now a pause,\r\nas if something was expected, when suddenly the butler entered the hall\r\nwith some degree of bustle: he was attended by a servant on each side\r\nwith a large wax-light, and bore a silver dish on which was an enormous\r\npig’s head decorated with rosemary, with a lemon in its mouth, which was\r\nplaced with great formality at the head of the table. The moment this\r\npageant made its appearance the harper struck up a flourish; at the\r\nconclusion of which the young Oxonian, on receiving a hint from the\r\nsquire, gave, with an air of the most comic gravity, an old carol, the\r\nfirst verse of which was as follows\r\n\r\n        Caput apri defero\r\n        Reddens laudes Domino.\r\n    The boar’s head in hand bring I,\r\n    With garlands gay and rosemary.\r\n    I pray you all synge merily\r\n        Qui estis in convivio.\r\n\r\nThough prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities, from\r\nbeing apprised of the peculiar hobby of mine host, yet I confess the\r\nparade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me,\r\nuntil I gathered from the conversation of the squire and the parson that\r\nit was meant to represent the bringing in of the boar’s head, a dish\r\nformerly served up with much ceremony and the sound of minstrelsy and\r\nsong at great tables on Christmas Day. “I like the old custom,” said the\r\nsquire, “not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself,\r\nbut because it was observed at the college at Oxford at which I was\r\neducated. When I hear the old song chanted it brings to mind the time\r\nwhen I was young and gamesome, and the noble old college hall, and my\r\nfellow-students loitering about in their black gowns; many of whom, poor\r\nlads! are now in their graves.”\r\n\r\nThe parson, however, whose mind was not haunted by such associations,\r\nand who was always more taken up with the text than the sentiment,\r\nobjected to the Oxonian’s version of the carol, which he affirmed\r\nwas different from that sung at college. He went on, with the dry\r\nperseverance of a commentator, to give the college reading, accompanied\r\nby sundry annotations, addressing himself at first to the company at\r\nlarge; but, finding their attention gradually diverted to other talk and\r\nother objects, he lowered his tone as his number of auditors diminished,\r\nuntil he concluded his remarks in an under voice to a fat-headed old\r\ngentleman next him who was silently engaged in the discussion of a huge\r\nplateful of turkey.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The old ceremony of serving up the boar’s head on\r\n     Christmas Day is still observed in the hall of Queen’s\r\n     College, Oxford. I was favored by the parson with a copy of\r\n     the carol as now sung, and as it may be acceptable to such\r\n     of my readers as are curious in these grave and learned\r\n     matters, I give it entire:\r\n\r\n    The boar’s head in hand bear I,\r\n    Bedeck’d with bays and rosemary\r\n    And I pray you, my masters, be merry\r\n        Quot estis in convivio\r\n        Caput apri defero,\r\n        Reddens laudes domino.\r\n\r\n    The boar’s head, as I understand,\r\n    Is the rarest dish in all this land,\r\n    Which thus bedeck’d with a gay garland\r\n        Let us servire cantico.\r\n            Caput apri defero, etc.\r\n\r\n    Our steward hath provided this\r\n    In honor of the King of Bliss,\r\n    Which on this day to be served is\r\n        In Reginensi Atrio.\r\n            Caput apri defero, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table was literally loaded with good cheer, and presented an\r\nepitome of country abundance in this season of overflowing larders.\r\nA distinguished post was allotted to “ancient sirloin,” as mine host\r\ntermed it, being, as he added, “the standard of old English hospitality,\r\nand a joint of goodly presence, and full of expectation.” There were\r\nseveral dishes quaintly decorated, and which had evidently something\r\ntraditional in their embellishments, but about which, as I did not like\r\nto appear overcurious, I asked no questions.\r\n\r\nI could not, however, but notice a pie magnificently decorated with\r\npeacock’s feathers, in imitation of the tail of that bird, which\r\novershadowed a considerable tract of the table. This, the squire\r\nconfessed with some little hesitation, was a pheasant pie, though a\r\npeacock pie was certainly the most authentical; but there had been such\r\na mortality among the peacocks this season that he could not prevail\r\nupon himself to have one killed.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The peacock was anciently in great demand for stately\r\n     entertainments. Sometimes it was made into a pie, at one end\r\n     of which the head appeared above the crust in all its\r\n     plumage, with the beak richly gilt; at the other end the\r\n     tail was displayed. Such pies were served up at the solemn\r\n     banquets of chivalry, when knights-errant pledged themselves\r\n     to undertake any perilous enterprise, whence came the\r\n     ancient oath, used by Justice Shallow, “by cock and pie.”\r\n\r\nThe peacock was also an important dish for the Christmas feast; and\r\nMassinger, in his “City Madam,” gives some idea of the extravagance\r\nwith which this, as well as other dishes, was prepared for the gorgeous\r\nrevels of the olden times:\r\n\r\n  Men may talk of Country Christmasses,\r\n  Their thirty pound butter’d eggs, their pies of carps’ tongues;\r\n  Their pheasants drench’d with ambergris: the carcases of three\r\n  fat wethers bruised for gravy to make sauce for a single peacock!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious, perhaps, to my wiser readers, who may not have\r\nthat foolish fondness for odd and obsolete things to which I am a\r\nlittle given, were I to mention the other makeshifts or this worthy old\r\nhumorist, by which he was endeavoring to follow up, though at humble\r\ndistance, the quaint customs of antiquity. I was pleased, however, to\r\nsee the respect shown to his whims by his children and relatives; who,\r\nindeed, entered readily into the full spirit of them, and seemed all\r\nwell versed in their parts, having doubtless been present at many a\r\nrehearsal. I was amused, too, at the air of profound gravity with which\r\nthe butler and other servants executed the duties assigned them, however\r\neccentric. They had an old-fashioned look, having, for the most part,\r\nbeen brought up in the household and grown into keeping with the\r\nantiquated mansion and the humors of its lord, and most probably looked\r\nupon all his whimsical regulations as the established laws of honorable\r\nhousekeeping.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloth was removed the butler brought in a huge silver vessel\r\nof rare and curious workmanship, which he placed before the squire.\r\nIts appearance was hailed with acclamation, being the Wassail Bowl, so\r\nrenowned in Christmas festivity. The contents had been prepared by the\r\nsquire himself; for it was a beverage in the skilful mixture of which\r\nhe particularly prided himself, alleging that it was too abstruse and\r\ncomplex for the comprehension of an ordinary servant. It was a potation,\r\nindeed, that might well make the heart of a toper leap within him, being\r\ncomposed of the richest and raciest wines, highly spiced and sweetened,\r\nwith roasted apples bobbing about the surface.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The Wassail Bowl was sometimes composed of ale instead of\r\n     wine, with nutmeg, sugar, toast, ginger, and roasted crabs;\r\n     in this way the nut-brown beverage is still prepared in some\r\n     old families and round the hearths of substantial farmers at\r\n     Christmas. It is also called Lamb’s Wool, and is celebrated\r\n     by Herrick in his “Twelfth Night”:\r\n\r\n        Next crowne the bowle full\r\n        With gentle Lamb’s Wool;\r\n    Add sugar, nutmeg, and ginger,\r\n        With store of ale too,\r\n        And thus ye must doe\r\n    To make the Wassaile a swinger.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman’s whole countenance beamed with a serene look of\r\nindwelling delight as he stirred this mighty bowl. Having raised it to\r\nhis lips, with a hearty wish of a merry Christmas to all present, he\r\nsent it brimming round the board, for every one to follow his example,\r\naccording to the primitive style, pronouncing it “the ancient fountain\r\nof good feeling, where all hearts met together.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * “The custom of drinking out of the same cup gave place to\r\n     each having his cup. When the steward came to the doore with\r\n     the Wassel, he was to cry three times, Wassel, Wassel,\r\n     Wassel, and then the chappell (chaplain) was to answer with\r\n     a song.”--Archaeologia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of Christmas\r\njoviality circulated and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies. When it\r\nreached Master Simon, he raised it in both hands, and with the air of a\r\nboon companion struck up an old Wassail Chanson:\r\n\r\n    The brown bowle,\r\n    The merry brown bowle,\r\n    As it goes round-about-a,\r\n        Fill\r\n        Still,\r\n    Let the world say what it will,\r\n    And drink your fill all out-a.\r\n\r\n    The deep canne,\r\n    The merry deep canne,\r\n    As thou dost freely quaff-a,\r\n        Sing\r\n        Fling,\r\n    Be as merry as a king,\r\n    And sound a lusty laugh-a.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * From Poor Robin’s Almanack.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the conversation during dinner turned upon family topics, to\r\nwhich I was a stranger. There was, however, a great deal of rallying of\r\nMaster Simon about some gay widow with whom he was accused of having\r\na flirtation. This attack was commenced by the ladies, but it was\r\ncontinued throughout the dinner by the fat-headed old gentleman next\r\nthe parson with the persevering assiduity of a slow hound, being one of\r\nthose long-winded jokers who, though rather dull at starting game, are\r\nunrivalled for their talents in hunting it down. At every pause in the\r\ngeneral conversation he renewed his bantering in pretty much the same\r\nterms, winking hard at me with both eyes whenever he gave Master Simon\r\nwhat he considered a home thrust. The latter, indeed, seemed fond of\r\nbeing teased on the subject, as old bachelors are apt to be, and he took\r\noccasion to inform me, in an undertone, that the lady in question was a\r\nprodigiously fine woman and drove her own curricle.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-time passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity, and,\r\nthough the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene\r\nof broader rout and revel, yet I doubt whether it ever witnessed more\r\nhonest and genuine enjoyment. How easy it is for one benevolent being to\r\ndiffuse pleasure around him! and how truly is a kind heart a fountain of\r\ngladness, making everything in its vicinity to freshen into smiles! The\r\njoyous disposition of the worthy squire was perfectly contagious; he was\r\nhappy himself, and disposed to make all the world happy, and the little\r\neccentricities of his humor did but season, in a manner, the sweetness\r\nof his philanthropy.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies had retired, the conversation, as usual, became still\r\nmore animated; many good things were broached which had been thought\r\nof during dinner, but which would not exactly do for a lady’s ear; and,\r\nthough I cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered, yet\r\nI have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less\r\nlaughter. Wit, after all, is a mighty tart, pungent ingredient, and much\r\ntoo acid for some stomachs; but honest good-humor is the oil and wine\r\nof a merry meeting, and there is no jovial companionship equal to that\r\nwhere the jokes are rather small and the laughter abundant.\r\n\r\nThe squire told several long stories of early college pranks and\r\nadventures, in some of which the parson had been a sharer, though in\r\nlooking at the latter it required some effort of imagination to figure\r\nsuch a little dark anatomy of a man into the perpetrator of a madcap\r\ngambol. Indeed, the two college chums presented pictures of what men\r\nmay be made by their different lots in life. The squire had left the\r\nuniversity to live lustily on his paternal domains in the vigorous\r\nenjoyment of prosperity and sunshine, and had flourished on to a hearty\r\nand florid old age; whilst the poor parson, on the contrary, had dried\r\nand withered away among dusty tomes in the silence and shadows of his\r\nstudy. Still, there seemed to be a spark of almost extinguished fire\r\nfeebly glimmering in the bottom of his soul; and as the squire hinted\r\nat a sly story of the parson and a pretty milkmaid whom they once met\r\non the banks of the Isis, the old gentleman made an “alphabet of faces,”\r\n which, as far as I could decipher his physiognomy, I verily believe was\r\nindicative of laughter; indeed, I have rarely met with an old gentleman\r\nthat took absolute offence at the imputed gallantries of his youth.\r\n\r\nI found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of\r\nsober judgment. The company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew\r\nduller. Master Simon was in as chirping a humor as a grasshopper filled\r\nwith dew; his old songs grew of a warmer complexion, and he began to\r\ntalk maudlin about the widow. He even gave a long song about the wooing\r\nof a widow which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent\r\nblack-letter work entitled Cupid’s Solicitor for Love, containing store\r\nof good advice for bachelors, and which he promised to lend me; the\r\nfirst verse was to effect.\r\n\r\n    He that will woo a widow must not dally\r\n        He must make hay while the sun doth shine;\r\n    He must not stand with her, shall I, shall I,\r\n        But boldly say, Widow, thou must be mine.\r\n\r\nThis song inspired the fat-headed old gentleman, who made several\r\nattempts to tell a rather broad story out of Joe Miller that was pat to\r\nthe purpose; but he always stuck in the middle, everybody recollecting\r\nthe latter part excepting himself. The parson, too, began to show the\r\neffects of good cheer, having gradually settled down into a doze and his\r\nwig sitting most suspiciously on one side. Just at this juncture we were\r\nsummoned to the drawing room, and I suspect, at the private instigation\r\nof mine host, whose joviality seemed always tempered with a proper love\r\nof decorum.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner-table was removed the hall was given up to the younger\r\nmembers of the family, who, prompted to all kind of noisy mirth by the\r\nOxonian and Master Simon, made its old walls ring with their merriment\r\nas they played at romping games. I delight in witnessing the gambols of\r\nchildren, and particularly at this happy holiday season, and could not\r\nhelp stealing out of the drawing-room on hearing one of their peals of\r\nlaughter. I found them at the game of blindman’s-buff. Master Simon, who\r\nwas the leader of their revels, and seemed on all occasions to fulfill\r\nthe office of that ancient potentate, the Lord of Misrule,* was blinded\r\nin the midst of the hall. The little beings were as busy about him as\r\nthe mock fairies about Falstaff, pinching him, plucking at the skirts of\r\nhis coat, and tickling him with straws. One fine blue-eyed girl of about\r\nthirteen, with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion, her frolic\r\nface in a glow, her frock half torn off her shoulders, a complete\r\npicture of a romp, was the chief tormentor; and, from the slyness with\r\nwhich Master Simon avoided the smaller game and hemmed this wild little\r\nnymph in corners, and obliged her to jump shrieking over chairs,\r\nI suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded than was\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * At Christmasse there was in the Kinges house, wheresoever\r\n     hee was lodged, a lorde of misrule or mayster of merie\r\n     disportes, and the like had ye in the house of every\r\n     nobleman of honor, or good worshipper were he spirituall or\r\n     temporall.--STOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the drawing-room I found the company seated round the\r\nfire listening to the parson, who was deeply ensconced in a high-backed\r\noaken chair, the work of some cunning artificer of yore, which had been\r\nbrought from the library for his particular accommodation. From this\r\nvenerable piece of furniture, with which his shadowy figure and dark\r\nweazen face so admirably accorded, he was dealing out strange accounts\r\nof the popular superstitions and legends of the surrounding country,\r\nwith which he had become acquainted in the course of his antiquarian\r\nresearches. I am half inclined to think that the old gentleman was\r\nhimself somewhat tinctured with superstition, as men are very apt to\r\nbe who live a recluse and studious life in a sequestered part of the\r\ncountry and pore over black-letter tracts, so often filled with the\r\nmarvelous and supernatural. He gave us several anecdotes of the fancies\r\nof the neighboring peasantry concerning the effigy of the crusader which\r\nlay on the tomb by the church altar. As it was the only monument of\r\nthe kind in that part of the country, it had always been regarded with\r\nfeelings of superstition by the good wives of the village. It was said\r\nto get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy\r\nnights, particularly when it thundered; and one old woman, whose cottage\r\nbordered on the churchyard, had seen it through the windows of the\r\nchurch, when the moon shone, slowly pacing up and down the aisles.\r\nIt was the belief that some wrong had been left unredressed by the\r\ndeceased, or some treasure hidden, which kept the spirit in a state of\r\ntrouble and restlessness. Some talked of gold and jewels buried in the\r\ntomb, over which the spectre kept watch; and there was a story current\r\nof a sexton in old times who endeavored to break his way to the coffin\r\nat night, but just as he reached it received a violent blow from\r\nthe marble hand of the effigy, which stretched him senseless on the\r\npavement. These tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier\r\namong the rustics, yet when night came on there were many of the\r\nstoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath\r\nthat led across the churchyard.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other anecdotes that followed the crusader appeared to be\r\nthe favorite hero of ghost-stories throughout the vicinity. His picture,\r\nwhich hung up in the hall, was thought by the servants to have something\r\nsupernatural about it; for they remarked that in whatever part of the\r\nhall you went the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you. The old\r\nporter’s wife, too, at the lodge, who had been born and brought up in\r\nthe family, and was a great gossip among the maid-servants, affirmed\r\nthat in her young days she had often heard say that on Midsummer Eve,\r\nwhen it was well known all kinds of ghosts, goblins, and fairies become\r\nvisible and walk abroad, the crusader used to mount his horse, come down\r\nfrom his picture, ride about the house, down the avenue, and so to the\r\nchurch to visit the tomb; on which occasion the church-door most civilly\r\nswung open of itself; not that he needed it, for he rode through closed\r\ngates, and even stone walls, and had been seen by one of the dairymaids\r\nto pass between two bars of the great park gate, making himself as thin\r\nas a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nAll these superstitions I found had been very much countenanced by the\r\nsquire, who, though not superstitious himself, was very fond of seeing\r\nothers so. He listened to every goblin tale of the neighboring gossips\r\nwith infinite gravity, and held the porter’s wife in high favor on\r\naccount of her talent for the marvellous. He was himself a great reader\r\nof old legends and romances, and often lamented that he could not\r\nbelieve in them; for a superstitious person, he thought, must live in a\r\nkind of fairy-land.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were all attention to the parson’s stories, our ears were\r\nsuddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall, in\r\nwhich were mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy with the\r\nuproar of many small voices and girlish laughter. The door suddenly flew\r\nopen, and a train came trooping into the room that might almost\r\nhave been mistaken for the breaking up of the court of Faery. That\r\nindefatigable spirit, Master Simon, in the faithful discharge of his\r\nduties as lord of misrule, had conceived the idea of a Christmas mummery\r\nor masking; and having called in to his assistance the Oxonian and the\r\nyoung officer, who were equally ripe for anything that should occasion\r\nromping and merriment, they had carried it into instant effect. The old\r\nhousekeeper had been consulted; the antique clothespresses and wardrobes\r\nrummaged and made to yield up the relics of finery that had not seen the\r\nlight for several generations; the younger part of the company had been\r\nprivately convened from the parlor and hall, and the whole had been\r\nbedizened out into a burlesque imitation of an antique mask.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Maskings or mummeries were favorite sports at Christmas in\r\n     old times, and the wardrobes at halls and manor-houses were\r\n     often laid under contribution to furnish dresses and\r\n     fantastic disguisings. I strongly suspect Master Simon to\r\n     have taken the idea of his from Ben Jonson’s “Masque of\r\n     Christmas.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Simon led the van, as “Ancient Christmas,” quaintly apparelled in\r\na ruff, a short cloak, which had very much the aspect of one of the old\r\nhousekeeper’s petticoats, and a hat that might have served for a\r\nvillage steeple, and must indubitably have figured in the days of the\r\nCovenanters. From under this his nose curved boldly forth, flushed with\r\na frost-bitten bloom that seemed the very trophy of a December blast. He\r\nwas accompanied by the blue-eyed romp, dished up, as “Dame Mince Pie,”\r\n in the venerable magnificence of a faded brocade, long stomacher, peaked\r\nhat, and high-heeled shoes. The young officer appeared as Robin Hood, in\r\na sporting dress of Kendal green and a foraging cap with a gold tassel.\r\n\r\nThe costume, to be sure, did not bear testimony to deep research, and\r\nthere was an evident eye to the picturesque, natural to a young gallant\r\nin the presence of his mistress. The fair Julia hung on his arm in a\r\npretty rustic dress as “Maid Marian.” The rest of the train had been\r\nmetamorphosed in various ways; the girls trussed up in the finery of the\r\nancient belles of the Bracebridge line, and the striplings bewhiskered\r\nwith burnt cork, and gravely clad in broad skirts, hanging sleeves,\r\nand full-bottomed wigs, to represent the character of Roast Beef, Plum\r\nPudding, and other worthies celebrated in ancient maskings. The whole\r\nwas under the control of the Oxonian in the appropriate character of\r\nMisrule; and I observed that he exercised rather a mischievous sway with\r\nhis wand over the smaller personages of the pageant.\r\n\r\nThe irruption of this motley crew with beat of drum, according to\r\nancient custom, was the consummation of uproar and merriment. Master\r\nSimon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which, as\r\nAncient Christmas, he walked a minuet with the peerless though giggling\r\nDame Mince Pie. It was followed by a dance of all the characters, which\r\nfrom its medley of costumes seemed as though the old family portraits\r\nhad skipped down from their frames to join in the sport. Different\r\ncenturies were figuring at cross hands and right and left; the Dark\r\nAges were cutting pirouettes and rigadoons; and the days of Queen\r\nBess jigging merrily down the middle through a line of succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe worthy squire contemplated these fantastic sports and this\r\nresurrection of his old wardrobe with the simple relish of childish\r\ndelight. He stood chuckling and rubbing his hands, and scarcely hearing\r\na word the parson said, notwithstanding that the latter was discoursing\r\nmost authentically on the ancient and stately dance of the Pavon, or\r\npeacock, from which he conceived the minuet to be derived.* For my\r\npart, I was in a continual excitement from the varied scenes of whim\r\nand innocent gayety passing before me. It was inspiring to see wild-eyed\r\nfrolic and warm-hearted hospitality breaking out from among the chills\r\nand glooms of winter, and old age throwing off his apathy and catching\r\nonce more the freshness of youthful enjoyment. I felt also an interest\r\nin the scene from the consideration that these fleeting customs were\r\nposting fast into oblivion, and that this was perhaps the only family\r\nin England in which the whole of them was still punctiliously observed.\r\nThere was a quaintness, too, mingled with all this revelry that gave\r\nit a peculiar zest: it was suited to the time and place; and as the old\r\nmanor-house almost reeled with mirth and wassail, it seemed echoing back\r\nthe joviality of long departed years.+\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Sir John Hawkins, speaking of the dance called the Pavon,\r\n     from pavo, a peacock, says, “It is a grave and majestic\r\n     dance; the method of dancing it anciently was by gentlemen\r\n     dressed with caps and swords, by those of the long robe in\r\n     their gowns, by the peers in their mantles, and by the\r\n     ladies in gowns with long trains, the motion whereof, in\r\n     dancing, resembled that of a peacock.”--History of Music.\r\n\r\n     + At the time of the first publication of this paper the\r\n     picture of an old-fashioned Christmas in the country was\r\n     pronounced by some as out of date. The author had afterwards\r\n     an opportunity of witnessing almost all the customs above\r\n     described, existing in unexpected vigor in the skirts of\r\n     Derbyshire and Yorkshire, where he passed the Christmas\r\n     holidays. The reader will find some notice of them in the\r\n     author’s account of his sojourn at Newstead Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut enough of Christmas and its gambols; it is time for me to pause\r\nin this garrulity. Methinks I hear the questions asked by my graver\r\nreaders, “To what purpose is all this? how is the world to be made\r\nwiser by this talk?” Alas! is there not wisdom enough extant for the\r\ninstruction of the world? And if not, are there not thousands of abler\r\npens laboring for its improvement? It is so much pleasanter to please\r\nthan to instruct--to play the companion rather than the preceptor.\r\n\r\nWhat, after all, is the mite of wisdom that I could throw into the mass\r\nof knowledge! or how am I sure that my sagest deductions may be safe\r\nguides for the opinions of others? But in writing to amuse, if I fail\r\nthe only evil is in my own disappointment. If, however, I can by any\r\nlucky chance, in these days of evil, rub out one wrinkle from the brow\r\nof care or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow; if I can now\r\nand then penetrate through the gathering film of misanthropy, prompt a\r\nbenevolent view of human nature, and make my reader more in good-humor\r\nwith his fellow-beings and himself--surely, surely, I shall not then\r\nhave written entirely in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON ANTIQUES.\r\n\r\n                                  ----I do walk\r\n    Methinks like Guide Vaux, with my dark lanthorn,\r\n    Stealing to set the town o’ fire; i’ th’ country\r\n    I should be taken for William o’ the Wisp,\r\n    Or Robin Goodfellow.\r\n                                             FLETCHER.\r\n\r\nI AM somewhat of an antiquity-hunter, and am fond of exploring London in\r\nquest of the relics of old times. These are principally to be found in\r\nthe depths of the city, swallowed up and almost lost in a wilderness of\r\nbrick and mortar, but deriving poetical and romantic interest from the\r\ncommonplace, prosaic world around them. I was struck with an instance of\r\nthe kind in the course of a recent summer ramble into the city; for the\r\ncity is only to be explored to advantage in summer-time, when free from\r\nthe smoke and fog and rain and mud of winter. I had been buffeting for\r\nsome time against the current of population setting through Fleet\r\nStreet. The warm weather had unstrung my nerves and made me sensitive to\r\nevery jar and jostle and discordant sound. The flesh was weary, the\r\nspirit faint, and I was getting out of humor with the bustling busy\r\nthrong through which I had to struggle, when in a fit of desperation I\r\ntore my way through the crowd, plunged into a by-lane, and, after\r\npassing through several obscure nooks and angles, emerged into a quaint\r\nand quiet court with a grassplot in the centre overhung by elms, and\r\nkept perpetually fresh and green by a fountain with its sparkling jet of\r\nwater. A student with book in hand was seated on a stone bench, partly\r\nreading, partly meditating on the movements of two or three trim\r\nnursery-maids with their infant charges.\r\n\r\nI was like an Arab who had suddenly come upon an oasis amid the panting\r\nsterility of the desert. By degrees the quiet and coolness of the place\r\nsoothed my nerves and refreshed my spirit. I pursued my walk, and came,\r\nhard by, to a very ancient chapel with a low-browed Saxon portal of\r\nmassive and rich architecture. The interior was circular and lofty and\r\nlighted from above. Around were monumental tombs of ancient date on\r\nwhich were extended the marble effigies of warriors in armor. Some had\r\nthe hands devoutly crossed upon the breast; others grasped the pommel of\r\nthe sword, menacing hostility even in the tomb, while the crossed legs\r\nof several indicated soldiers of the Faith who had been on crusades to\r\nthe Holy Land.\r\n\r\nI was, in fact, in the chapel of the Knights Templars, strangely\r\nsituated in the very centre of sordid traffic; and I do not know a more\r\nimpressive lesson for the many of the world than thus suddenly to turn\r\naside from the highway of busy money-seeking life, and sit down\r\namong these shadowy sepulchres, where all is twilight, dust, and\r\nforget-fullness.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent tour of observation I encountered another of these\r\nrelics of a “foregone world” locked up in the heart of the city. I had\r\nbeen wandering for some time through dull monotonous streets, destitute\r\nof anything to strike the eye or excite the imagination, when I beheld\r\nbefore me a Gothic gateway of mouldering antiquity. It opened into a\r\nspacious quadrangle forming the courtyard of a stately Gothic pile, the\r\nportal of which stood invitingly open.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently a public edifice, and, as I was antiquity-hunting, I\r\nventured in, though with dubious steps. Meeting no one either to oppose\r\nor rebuke my intrusion, I continued on until I found myself in a\r\ngreat hall with a lofty arched roof and oaken gallery, all of Gothic\r\narchitecture. At one end of the hall was an enormous fireplace, with\r\nwooden settles on each side; at the other end was a raised platform,\r\nor dais, the seat of state, above which was the portrait of a man in\r\nantique garb with a long robe, a ruff, and a venerable gray beard.\r\n\r\nThe whole establishment had an air of monastic quiet and seclusion, and\r\nwhat gave it a mysterious charm was, that I had not met with a human\r\nbeing since I had passed the threshold.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this loneliness, I seated myself in a recess of a large\r\nbow window, which admitted a broad flood of yellow sunshine, checkered\r\nhere and there by tints from panes of colored glass, while an open\r\ncasement let in the soft summer air. Here, leaning my head on my hand\r\nand my arm on an old oaken table, I indulged in a sort of reverie about\r\nwhat might have been the ancient uses of this edifice. It had evidently\r\nbeen of monastic origin; perhaps one of those collegiate establishments\r\nbuilt of yore for the promotion of learning, where the patient monk,\r\nin the ample solitude of the cloister, added page to page and volume to\r\nvolume, emulating in the productions of his brain the magnitude of the\r\npile he inhabited.\r\n\r\nAs I was seated in this musing mood a small panelled door in an arch at\r\nthe upper end of the hall was opened, and a number of gray-headed old\r\nmen, clad in long black cloaks, came forth one by one, proceeding in\r\nthat manner through the hall, without uttering a word, each turning a\r\npale face on me as he passed, and disappearing through a door at the\r\nlower end.\r\n\r\nI was singularly struck with their appearance; their black cloaks and\r\nantiquated air comported with the style of this most venerable and\r\nmysterious pile. It was as if the ghosts of the departed years, about\r\nwhich I had been musing, were passing in review before me. Pleasing\r\nmyself with such fancies, I set out, in the spirit of romance, to\r\nexplore what I pictured to myself a realm of shadows existing in the\r\nvery centre of substantial realities.\r\n\r\nMy ramble led me through a labyrinth of interior courts and corridors\r\nand dilapidated cloisters, for the main edifice had many additions and\r\ndependencies, built at various times and in various styles. In one open\r\nspace a number of boys, who evidently belonged to the establishment,\r\nwere at their sports, but everywhere I observed those mysterious\r\nold gray men in black mantles, sometimes sauntering alone, sometimes\r\nconversing in groups; they appeared to be the pervading genii of the\r\nplace. I now called to mind what I had read of certain colleges in\r\nold times, where judicial astrology, geomancy, necromancy, and other\r\nforbidden and magical sciences were taught. Was this an establishment of\r\nthe kind, and were these black-cloaked old men really professors of the\r\nblack art?\r\n\r\nThese surmises were passing through my mind as my eye glanced into\r\na chamber hung round with all kinds of strange and uncouth\r\nobjects--implements of savage warfare, strange idols and stuffed\r\nalligators; bottled serpents and monsters decorated the mantelpiece;\r\nwhile on the high tester of an old-fashioned bedstead grinned a human\r\nskull, flanked on each side by a dried cat.\r\n\r\nI approached to regard more narrowly this mystic chamber, which seemed a\r\nfitting laboratory for a necromancer, when I was startled at beholding\r\na human countenance staring at me from a dusky corner. It was that of a\r\nsmall, shrivelled old man with thin cheeks, bright eyes, and gray, wiry,\r\nprojecting eyebrows. I at first doubted whether it were not a mummy\r\ncuriously preserved, but it moved, and I saw that it was alive. It was\r\nanother of these black-cloaked old men, and, as I regarded his quaint\r\nphysiognomy, his obsolete garb, and the hideous and sinister objects by\r\nwhich he was surrounded, I began to persuade myself that I had come upon\r\nthe arch-mage who ruled over this magical fraternity.\r\n\r\nSeeing me pausing before the door, he rose and invited me to enter. I\r\nobeyed with singular hardihood, for how did I know whether a wave of his\r\nwand might not metamorphose me into some strange monster or conjure me\r\ninto one of the bottles on his mantelpiece? He proved, however, to be\r\nanything but a conjurer, and his simple garrulity soon dispelled all the\r\nmagic and mystery with which I had enveloped this antiquated pile and\r\nits no less antiquated inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that I had made my way into the centre of an ancient asylum\r\nfor superannuated tradesmen and decayed householders, with which was\r\nconnected a school for a limited number of boys. It was founded upwards\r\nof two centuries since on an old monastic establishment, and retained\r\nsomewhat of the conventual air and character. The shadowy line of old\r\nmen in black mantles who had passed before me in the hall, and whom I\r\nhad elevated into magi, turned out to be the pensioners returning from\r\nmorning, service in the chapel.\r\n\r\nJohn Hallum, the little collector of curiosities whom I had made the\r\narch magician, had been for six years a resident of the place, and\r\nhad decorated this final nestling-place of his old age with relics\r\nand rarities picked up in the course of his life. According to his\r\nown account, he had been somewhat of a traveller, having been once in\r\nFrance, and very near making a visit to Holland. He regretted not having\r\nvisited the latter country, “as then he might have said he had been\r\nthere.” He was evidently a traveller of the simple kind.\r\n\r\nHe was aristocratical too in his notions, keeping aloof, as I found,\r\nfrom the ordinary run of pensioners. His chief associates were a blind\r\nman who spoke Latin and Greek, of both which languages Hallum was\r\nprofoundly ignorant, and a broken-down gentleman who had run through\r\na fortune of forty thousand pounds left him by his father, and ten\r\nthousand pounds, the marriage portion of his wife. Little Hallum seemed\r\nto consider it an indubitable sign of gentle blood as well as of lofty\r\nspirit to be able to squander such enormous sums.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The picturesque remnant of old times into which I have thus\r\nbeguiled the reader is what is called the Charter House, originally\r\nthe Chartreuse. It was founded in 1611, on the remains of an ancient\r\nconvent, by Sir Thomas Sutton, being one of those noble charities set\r\non foot by individual munificence, and kept up with the quaintness and\r\nsanctity of ancient times amidst the modern changes and innovations\r\nof London. Here eighty broken-down men, who have seen better days,\r\nare provided in their old age with food, clothing, fuel, and a yearly\r\nallowance for private expenses. They dine together, as did the monks of\r\nold, in the hall which had been the refectory of the original convent.\r\nAttached to the establishment is a school for forty-four boys.\r\n\r\nStow, whose work I have consulted on the subject, speaking of the\r\nobligations of the gray-headed pensioners, says, “They are not to\r\nintermeddle with any business touching the affairs of the hospital,\r\nbut to attend only to the service of God, and take thankfully what is\r\nprovided for them, without muttering, murmuring, or grudging. None to\r\nwear weapon, long hair, colored boots, spurs, or colored shoes, feathers\r\nin their hats, or any ruffian-like or unseemly apparel, but such as\r\nbecomes hospital-men to wear.” “And in truth,” adds Stow, “happy are\r\nthey that are so taken from the cares and sorrows of the world, and\r\nfixed in so good a place as these old men are; having nothing to care\r\nfor but the good of their souls, to serve God, and to live in brotherly\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\nFor the amusement of such as have been interested by the preceding\r\nsketch, taken down from my own observation, and who may wish to know a\r\nlittle more about the mysteries of London, I subjoin a modicum of local\r\nhistory put into my hands by an odd-looking old gentleman, in a small\r\nbrown wig and a snuff-colored coat, with whom I became acquainted\r\nshortly after my visit to the Charter House. I confess I was a little\r\ndubious at first whether it was not one of those apocryphal tales often\r\npassed off upon inquiring travellers like myself, and which have brought\r\nour general character for veracity into such unmerited reproach. On\r\nmaking proper inquiries, however, I have received the most satisfactory\r\nassurances of the author’s probity, and indeed have been told that he\r\nis actually engaged in a full and particular account of the very\r\ninteresting region in which he resides, of which the following may be\r\nconsidered merely as a foretaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nWhat I write is most true..... I have a whole booke of cases lying by\r\nme, which if I should sette foorth, some grave auntients (within the\r\nhearing of Bow Bell) would be out of charity with me.                                                   NASH.\r\n\r\nIN the centre of the great City of London lies a small neighborhood,\r\nconsisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts, of very venerable\r\nand debilitated houses, which goes by the name of LITTLE BRITAIN. Christ\r\nChurch School and St. Bartholomew’s Hospital bound it on the west;\r\nSmithfield and Long Lane on the north; Aldersgate Street, like an arm\r\nof the sea, divides it from the eastern part of the city; whilst the\r\nyawning gulf of Bull-and-Mouth Street separates it from Butcher Lane\r\nand the regions of Newgate. Over this little territory, thus bounded and\r\ndesignated, the great dome of St. Paul’s, swelling above the intervening\r\nhouses of Paternoster Row, Amen Corner, and Ave-Maria Lane, looks down\r\nwith an air of motherly protection.\r\n\r\nThis quarter derives its appellation from having been, in ancient times,\r\nthe residence of the Dukes of Brittany. As London increased, however,\r\nrank and fashion rolled off to the west, and trade, creeping on at their\r\nheels, took possession of their deserted abodes. For some time Little\r\nBritain became the great mart of learning, and was peopled by the busy\r\nand prolific race of booksellers: these also gradually deserted it, and,\r\nemigrating beyond the great strait of Newgate Street, settled down\r\nin Paternoster Row and St. Paul’s Churchyard, where they continue to\r\nincrease and multiply even at the present day.\r\n\r\nBut, though thus fallen into decline, Little Britain still bears traces\r\nof its former splendor. There are several houses ready to tumble down,\r\nthe fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oaken carvings\r\nof hideous faces, unknown birds, beasts, and fishes, and fruits and\r\nflowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify. There are also,\r\nin Aldersgate Street, certain remains of what were once spacious and\r\nlordly family mansions, but which have in latter days been subdivided\r\ninto several tenements. Here may often be found the family of a petty\r\ntradesman, with its trumpery furniture, burrowing among the relics of\r\nantiquated finery in great rambling time-stained apartments with fretted\r\nceilings, gilded cornices, and enormous marble fireplaces. The lanes and\r\ncourts also contain many smaller houses, not on so grand a scale, but,\r\nlike your small ancient gentry, sturdily maintaining their claims to\r\nequal antiquity. These have their gable ends to the street, great bow\r\nwindows with diamond panes set in lead, grotesque carvings, and low\r\narched doorways.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * It is evident that the author of this interesting\r\n     communication has included, in his general title of Little\r\n     Britain, man of those little lanes and courts that belong\r\n     immediately to Cloth Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this most venerable and sheltered little nest have I passed several\r\nquiet years of existence, comfortably lodged in the second floor of\r\none of the smallest but oldest edifices. My sitting-room is an old\r\nwainscoted chamber, with small panels and set off with a miscellaneous\r\narray of furniture. I have a particular respect for three or four\r\nhigh-backed, claw-footed chairs, covered with tarnished brocade, which\r\nbear the marks of having seen better days, and have doubtless figured\r\nin some of the old palaces of Little Britain. They seem to me to\r\nkeep together and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their\r\nleathern-bottomed neighbors, as I have seen decayed gentry carry a\r\nhigh head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced to\r\nassociate. The whole front of my sitting-room is taken up with a\r\nbow window, on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous\r\noccupants for many generations, mingled with scraps of very indifferent\r\ngentleman-like poetry, written in characters which I can scarcely\r\ndecipher, and which extol the charms of many a beauty of Little Britain\r\nwho has long, long since bloomed, faded, and passed away. As I am an\r\nidle personage, with no apparent occupation, and pay my bill regularly\r\nevery week, I am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of\r\nthe neighborhood, and, being curious to learn the internal state of a\r\ncommunity so apparently shut up within itself, I have managed to work my\r\nway into all the concerns and secrets of the place.\r\n\r\nLittle Britain may truly be called the heart’s core of the city, the\r\nstronghold of true John Bullism. It is a fragment of London as it was in\r\nits better days, with its antiquated folks and fashions. Here flourish\r\nin great preservation many of the holiday games and customs of yore.\r\nThe inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, hot\r\ncross-buns on Good Friday, and roast goose at Michaelmas; they send\r\nlove-letters on Valentine’s Day, burn the Pope on the Fifth of November,\r\nand kiss all the girls under the mistletoe at Christmas. Roast beef and\r\nplum-pudding are also held in superstitious veneration, and port and\r\nsherry maintain their grounds as the only true English wines, all others\r\nbeing considered vile outlandish beverages.\r\n\r\nLittle Britain has its long catalogue of city wonders, which its\r\ninhabitants consider the wonders of the world, such as the great bell\r\nof St. Paul’s, which sours all the beer when it tolls; the figures that\r\nstrike the hours at St. Dunstan’s clock; the Monument; the lions in the\r\nTower; and the wooden giants in Guildhall. They still believe in dreams\r\nand fortune-telling, and an old woman that lives in Bull-and-Mouth\r\nStreet makes a tolerable subsistence by detecting stolen goods\r\nand promising the girls good husbands. They are apt to be rendered\r\nuncomfortable by comets and eclipses, and if a dog howls dolefully at\r\nnight it is looked upon as a sure sign of death in the place. There\r\nare even many ghost-stories current, particularly concerning the old\r\nmansion-houses, in several of which it is said strange sights are\r\nsometimes seen. Lords and ladies, the former in full-bottomed wigs,\r\nhanging sleeves, and swords, the latter in lappets, stays, hoops, and\r\nbrocade, have been seen walking up and down the great waste chambers\r\non moonlight nights, and are supposed to be the shades of the ancient\r\nproprietors in their court-dresses.\r\n\r\nLittle Britain has likewise its sages and great men. One of the most\r\nimportant of the former is a tall, dry old gentleman of the name\r\nof Skryme, who keeps a small apothecary’s shop. He has a cadaverous\r\ncountenance, full of cavities and projections, with a brown circle round\r\neach eye, like a pair of horn spectacles. He is much thought of by the\r\nold women, who consider him as a kind of conjurer because he has two or\r\nthree stuffed alligators hanging up in his shop and several snakes in\r\nbottles. He is a great reader of almanacs and newspapers, and is much\r\ngiven to pore over alarming accounts of plots, conspiracies, fires,\r\nearthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; which last phenomena he considers\r\nas signs of the times. He has always some dismal tale of the kind to\r\ndeal out to his customers with their doses, and thus at the same time\r\nputs both soul and body into an uproar. He is a great believer in omens\r\nand predictions; and has the prophecies of Robert Nixon and Mother\r\nShipton by heart. No man can make so much out of an eclipse, or even\r\nan unusually dark day; and he shook the tail of the last comet over the\r\nheads of his customers and disciples until they were nearly frightened\r\nout of their wits. He has lately got hold of a popular legend or\r\nprophecy, on which he has been unusually eloquent. There has been a\r\nsaying current among the ancient sibyls, who treasure up these things,\r\nthat when the grasshopper on the top of the Exchange shook hands with\r\nthe dragon on the top of Bow Church steeple, fearful events would take\r\nplace. This strange conjunction, it seems, has as strangely come to\r\npass. The same architect has been engaged lately on the repairs of the\r\ncupola of the Exchange and the steeple of Bow Church; and, fearful to\r\nrelate, the dragon and the grasshopper actually lie, cheek by jole, in\r\nthe yard of his workshop.\r\n\r\n“Others,” as Mr. Skryme is accustomed to say, “may go star-gazing, and\r\nlook for conjunctions in the heavens, but here is a conjunction on the\r\nearth, near at home and under our own eyes, which surpasses all\r\nthe signs and calculations of astrologers.” Since these portentous\r\nweathercocks have thus laid their heads together, wonderful events had\r\nalready occurred. The good old king, notwithstanding that he had lived\r\neighty-two years, had all at once given up the ghost; another king had\r\nmounted the throne; a royal duke had died suddenly; another, in France,\r\nhad been murdered; there had been radical meetings in all parts of the\r\nkingdom; the bloody scenes at Manchester; the great plot in Cato Street;\r\nand, above all, the queen had returned to England! All these sinister\r\nevents are recounted by Mr. Skyrme with a mysterious look and a dismal\r\nshake of the head; and being taken with his drugs, and associated in the\r\nminds of his auditors with stuffed sea-monsters, bottled serpents, and\r\nhis own visage, which is a title-page of tribulation, they have spread\r\ngreat gloom through the minds of the people of Little Britain. They\r\nshake their heads whenever they go by Bow Church, and observe that they\r\nnever expected any good to come of taking down that steeple, which in\r\nold times told nothing but glad tidings, as the history of Whittington\r\nand his Cat bears witness.\r\n\r\nThe rival oracle of Little Britain is a substantial cheesemonger,\r\nwho lives in a fragment of one of the old family mansions, and is as\r\nmagnificently lodged as a round-bellied mite in the midst of one of his\r\nown Cheshires. Indeed, he is a man of no little standing and importance,\r\nand his renown extends through Huggin lane and Lad lane, and even unto\r\nAldermanbury. His opinion is very much taken in affairs of state, having\r\nread the Sunday papers for the last half century, together with\r\nthe Gentleman’s Magazine, Rapin’s History of England, and the Naval\r\nChronicle. His head is stored with invaluable maxims which have borne\r\nthe test of time and use for centuries. It is his firm opinion that\r\n“it is a moral impossible,” so long as England is true to herself, that\r\nanything can shake her: and he has much to say on the subject of the\r\nnational debt, which, somehow or other, he proves to be a great national\r\nbulwark and blessing. He passed the greater part of his life in the\r\npurlieus of Little Britain until of late years, when, having become\r\nrich and grown into the dignity of a Sunday cane, he begins to take his\r\npleasure and see the world. He has therefore made several excursions to\r\nHampstead, Highgate, and other neighboring towns, where he has passed\r\nwhole afternoons in looking back upon the metropolis through a telescope\r\nand endeavoring to descry the steeple of St. Bartholomew’s. Not a\r\nstage-coachman of Bull-and-Mouth Street but touches his hat as he\r\npasses, and he is considered quite a patron at the coach-office of the\r\nGoose and Gridiron, St. Paul’s Churchyard. His family have been very\r\nurgent for him to make an expedition to Margate, but he has great doubts\r\nof those new gimcracks, the steamboats, and indeed thinks himself too\r\nadvanced in life to undertake sea-voyages.\r\n\r\nLittle Britain has occasionally its factions and divisions, and party\r\nspirit ran very high at one time, in consequence of two rival “Burial\r\nSocieties” being set up in the place. One held its meeting at the Swan\r\nand Horse-Shoe, and was patronized by the cheesemonger; the other at the\r\nCock and Crown, under the auspices of the apothecary: it is needless to\r\nsay that the latter was the most flourishing. I have passed an evening\r\nor two at each, and have acquired much valuable information as to\r\nthe best mode of being buried, the comparative merits of churchyards,\r\ntogether with divers hints on the subject of patent iron coffins. I have\r\nheard the question discussed in all its bearings as to the legality\r\nof prohibiting the latter on account of their durability. The feuds\r\noccasioned by these societies have happily died of late; but they were\r\nfor a long time prevailing themes of controversy, the people of Little\r\nBritain being extremely solicitous of funeral honors and of lying\r\ncomfortably in their graves.\r\n\r\nBesides these two funeral societies there is a third of quite a\r\ndifferent cast, which tends to throw the sunshine of good-humor over the\r\nwhole neighborhood. It meets once a week at a little old-fashioned\r\nhouse kept by a jolly publican of the name of Wagstaff, and bearing for\r\ninsignia a resplendent half-moon, with a most seductive bunch of grapes.\r\nThe whole edifice is covered with inscriptions to catch the eye of the\r\nthirsty wayfarer; such as “Truman, Hanbury, and Co’s Entire,” “Wine,\r\nRum, and Brandy Vaults,” “Old Tom, Rum, and Compounds,” etc. This indeed\r\nhas been a temple of Bacchus and Momus from time immemorial. It has\r\nalways been in the family of the Wagstaffs, so that its history is\r\ntolerably preserved by the present landlord. It was much frequented by\r\nthe gallants and cavalieros of the reign of Elizabeth, and was looked\r\ninto now and then by the wits of Charles the Second’s day. But what\r\nWagstaff principally prides himself upon is that Henry the Eighth, in\r\none of his nocturnal rambles, broke the head of one of his ancestors\r\nwith his famous walking-staff. This, however, is considered as rather a\r\ndubious and vain-glorious boast of the landlord.\r\n\r\nThe club which now holds its weekly sessions here goes by the name of\r\n“the Roaring Lads of Little Britain.” They abound in old catches, glees,\r\nand choice stories that are traditional in the place and not to be met\r\nwith in any other part of the metropolis. There is a madcap undertaker\r\nwho is inimitable at a merry song, but the life of the club, and\r\nindeed the prime wit of Little Britain, is bully Wagstaff himself. His\r\nancestors were all wags before him, and he has inherited with the inn\r\na large stock of songs and jokes, which go with it from generation to\r\ngeneration as heirlooms. He is a dapper little fellow, with bandy legs\r\nand pot belly, a red face with a moist merry eye, and a little shock of\r\ngray hair behind. At the opening of every club night he is called in to\r\nsing his “Confession of Faith,” which is the famous old drinking trowl\r\nfrom “Gammer Gurton’s Needle.” He sings it, to be sure, with many\r\nvariations, as he received it from his father’s lips; for it has been a\r\nstanding favorite at the Half-Moon and Bunch of Grapes ever since it was\r\nwritten; nay, he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honor\r\nof singing it before the nobility and gentry at Christmas mummeries,\r\nwhen Little Britain was in all its glory.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * As mine host of the Half-Moon’s Confession of Faith may\r\n     not be familiar to the majority of readers, and as it is a\r\n     specimen of the current songs of Little Britain, I subjoin\r\n     it in its original orthography. I would observe that the\r\n     whole club always join in the chorus with a fearful thumping\r\n     on the table and clattering of pewter pots.\r\n\r\n        I cannot eate but lytle meate,\r\n            My stomacke is not good,\r\n        But sure I thinke that I can drinke\r\n            With him that weares a hood.\r\n        Though I go bare, take ye no care,\r\n            I nothing am a colde,\r\n        I stuff my skyn so full within,\r\n            Of joly good ale and olde.\r\n\r\n  Chorus. Backe and syde go bare, go bare,\r\n            Both foote and hand go colde,\r\n        But, belly, God send thee good ale ynoughe,\r\n            Whether it be new or olde.\r\n\r\n        I have no rost, but a nut brawne toste\r\n            And a crab laid in the fyre;\r\n        A little breade shall do me steade,\r\n            Much breade I not desyre.\r\n        No frost nor snow, nor winde, I trowe,\r\n            Can hurte mee, if I wolde,\r\n        I am so wrapt and throwly lapt\r\n            Of joly good ale and olde.\r\n\r\n  Chorus. Backe and syde go bare, go bare, etc.\r\n\r\n        And Tyb my wife, that, as her lyfe,\r\n            Loveth well good ale to seeke,\r\n        Full oft drynkes shee, tyll ye may see,\r\n            The teares run downe her cheeke.\r\n        Then doth shee trowle to me the bowle,\r\n            Even as a mault-worme sholde,\r\n        And sayth, sweete harte, I took my parte\r\n            Of this jolly good ale and olde.\r\n\r\n  Chorus. Backe and syde go bare, go bare, etc.\r\n\r\n        Now let them drynke, tyll they nod and winke,\r\n            Even as goode fellowes sholde doe,\r\n        They shall not mysse to have the blisse,\r\n            Good ale doth bring men to;\r\n        And all poore soules that have scowred bowles,\r\n            Or have them lustily trolde,\r\n        God save the lyves of them and their wives,\r\n            Whether they be yonge or olde.\r\n  Chorus. Backe and syde go bare, go bare, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would do one’s heart good to hear, on a club night, the shouts of\r\nmerriment, the snatches of song, and now and then the choral bursts of\r\nhalf a dozen discordant voices, which issue from this jovial mansion. At\r\nsuch times the street is lined with listeners, who enjoy a delight equal\r\nto that of gazing into a confectioner’s window or snuffing up the steams\r\nof a cook-shop.\r\n\r\nThere are two annual events which produce great stir and sensation in\r\nLittle Britain: these are St. Bartholomew’s Fair and the Lord Mayor’s\r\nDay. During the time of the Fair, which is held in the adjoining regions\r\nof Smithfield, there is nothing going on but gossiping and gadding\r\nabout. The late quiet streets of Little Britain are overrun with an\r\nirruption of strange figures and faces; every tavern is a scene of rout\r\nand revel. The fiddle and the song are heard from the taproom morning,\r\nnoon, and night; and at each window may be seen some group of boon\r\ncompanions, with half-shut eyes, hats on one side, pipe in mouth and\r\ntankard in hand, fondling and prosing, and singing maudlin songs over\r\ntheir liquor. Even the sober decorum of private families, which I must\r\nsay is rigidly kept up at other times among my neighbors, is no proof\r\nagainst this saturnalia. There is no such thing as keeping maid-servants\r\nwithin doors. Their brains are absolutely set madding with Punch and\r\nthe Puppet-Show, the Flying Horses, Signior Polito, the Fire-Eater, the\r\ncelebrated Mr. Paap, and the Irish Giant. The children too lavish all\r\ntheir holiday money in toys and gilt gingerbread, and fill the house\r\nwith the Lilliputian din of drums, trumpets, and penny whistles.\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Mayor’s Day is the great anniversary. The Lord Mayor\r\nis looked up to by the inhabitants of Little Britain as the greatest\r\npotentate upon earth, his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of\r\nhuman splendor, and his procession, with all the sheriffs and aldermen\r\nin his train, as the grandest of earthly pageants. How they exult in\r\nthe idea that the king himself dare not enter the city without first\r\nknocking at the gate of Temple Bar and asking permission of the Lord\r\nMayor; for if he did, heaven and earth! there is no knowing what might\r\nbe the consequence. The man in armor who rides before the Lord Mayor,\r\nand is the city champion, has orders to cut down everybody that offends\r\nagainst the dignity of the city; and then there is the little man with a\r\nvelvet porringer on his head, who sits at the window of the state coach\r\nand holds the city sword, as long as a pikestaff. Odd’s blood! if he\r\nonce draws that sword, Majesty itself is not safe.\r\n\r\nUnder the protection of this mighty potentate, therefore, the good\r\npeople of Little Britain sleep in peace. Temple Bar is an effectual\r\nbarrier against all interior foes; and as to foreign invasion, the Lord\r\nMayor has but to throw himself into the Tower, call in the train-bands,\r\nand put the standing army of Beef-eaters under arms, and he may bid\r\ndefiance to the world!\r\n\r\nThus wrapped up in its own concerns, its own habits, and its own\r\nopinions, Little Britain has long flourished as a sound heart to this\r\ngreat fungous metropolis. I have pleased myself with considering it as\r\na chosen spot, where the principles of sturdy John Bullism were garnered\r\nup, like seed corn, to renew the national character when it had run\r\nto waste and degeneracy. I have rejoiced also in the general spirit of\r\nharmony that prevailed throughout it; for though there might now\r\nand then be a few clashes of opinion between the adherents of the\r\ncheesemonger and the apothecary, and an occasional feud between the\r\nburial societies, yet these were but transient clouds and soon passed\r\naway. The neighbors met with good-will, parted with a shake of the hand,\r\nand never abused each other except behind their backs.\r\n\r\nI could give rare descriptions of snug junketing parties at which I\r\nhave been present, where we played at All-Fours, Pope-Joan,\r\nTom-come-tickle-me, and other choice old games, and where we sometimes\r\nhad a good old English country dance to the tune of Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley. Once a year also the neighbors would gather together and go on\r\na gypsy party to Epping Forest. It would have done any man’s heart good\r\nto see the merriment that took place here as we banqueted on the grass\r\nunder the trees. How we made the woods ring with bursts of laughter at\r\nthe songs of little Wagstaff and the merry undertaker! After dinner,\r\ntoo, the young folks would play at blindman’s-buff and hide-and-seek,\r\nand it was amusing to see them tangled among the briers, and to hear a\r\nfine romping girl now and then squeak from among the bushes. The elder\r\nfolks would gather round the cheesemonger and the apothecary to hear\r\nthem talk politics, for they generally brought out a newspaper in their\r\npockets to pass away time in the country. They would now and then, to\r\nbe sure, get a little warm in argument; but their disputes were always\r\nadjusted by reference to a worthy old umbrella-maker in a double chin,\r\nwho, never exactly comprehending the subject, managed somehow or other\r\nto decide in favor of both parties.\r\n\r\nAll empires, however, says some philosopher or historian, are doomed to\r\nchanges and revolutions. Luxury and innovation creep in, factions arise,\r\nand families now and then spring up whose ambition and intrigues\r\nthrow the whole system into confusion. Thus in letter days has the\r\ntranquillity of Little Britain been grievously disturbed and its golden\r\nsimplicity of manners threatened with total subversion by the aspiring\r\nfamily of a retired butcher.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Lambs had long been among the most thriving and\r\npopular in the neighborhood: the Miss Lambs were the belles of Little\r\nBritain, and everybody was pleased when Old Lamb had made money enough\r\nto shut up shop and put his name on a brass plate on his door. In an\r\nevil hour, however, one of the Miss Lambs had the honor of being a lady\r\nin attendance on the Lady Mayoress at her grand annual ball, on which\r\noccasion she wore three towering ostrich feathers on her head. The\r\nfamily never got over it; they were immediately smitten with a passion\r\nfor high life; set up a one-horse carriage, put a bit of gold lace round\r\nthe errand-boy’s hat, and have been the talk and detestation of the\r\nwhole neighborhood ever since. They could no longer be induced to\r\nplay at Pope-Joan or blindman’s-buff; they could endure no dances but\r\nquadrilles, which nobody had ever heard of in Little Britain; and they\r\ntook to reading novels, talking bad French, and playing upon the piano.\r\nTheir brother, too, who had been articled to an attorney, set up for a\r\ndandy and a critic, characters hitherto unknown in these parts, and\r\nhe confounded the worthy folks exceedingly by talking about Kean, the\r\nOpera, and the “Edinburgh Review.”\r\n\r\nWhat was still worse, the Lambs gave a grand ball, to which they\r\nneglected to invite any of their old neighbors; but they had a great\r\ndeal of genteel company from Theobald’s Road, Red Lion Square, and other\r\nparts towards the west. There were several beaux of their brother’s\r\nacquaintance from Gray’s Inn Lane and Hatton Garden, and not less\r\nthan three aldermen’s ladies with their daughters. This was not to be\r\nforgotten or forgiven. All Little Britain was in an uproar with the\r\nsmacking of whips, the lashing of in miserable horses, and the rattling\r\nand jingling of hackney-coaches. The gossips of the neighborhood might\r\nbe seen popping their night-caps out at every window, watching the crazy\r\nvehicles rumble by; and there was a knot of virulent old cronies that\r\nkept a look-out from a house just opposite the retired butcher’s and\r\nscanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nThis dance was a cause of almost open war, and the whole neighborhood\r\ndeclared they would have nothing more to say to the Lambs. It is\r\ntrue that Mrs. Lamb, when she had no engagements with her quality\r\nacquaintance, would give little humdrum tea-junketings to some of her\r\nold cronies, “quite,” as she would say, “in a friendly way;” and it is\r\nequally true that her invitations were always accepted, in spite of all\r\nprevious vows to the contrary. Nay, the good ladies would sit and be\r\ndelighted with the music of the Miss Lambs, who would condescend to\r\nstrum an Irish melody for them on the piano; and they would listen\r\nwith wonderful interest to Mrs. Lamb’s anecdotes of Alderman Plunket’s\r\nfamily, of Portsoken Ward, and the Miss Timberlakes, the rich heiresses\r\nof Crutched Friars but then they relieved their consciences and averted\r\nthe reproaches of their confederates by canvassing at the next gossiping\r\nconvocation everything that had passed, and pulling the Lambs and their\r\nrout all to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe only one of the family that could not be made fashionable was the\r\nretired butcher himself. Honest Lamb, in spite of the meekness of his\r\nname, was a rough, hearty old fellow, with the voice of a lion, a head\r\nof black hair like a shoe-brush, and a broad face mottled like his own\r\nbeef. It was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as “the old\r\ngentleman,” addressed him as “papa” in tones of infinite softness,\r\nand endeavored to coax him into a dressing-gown and slippers and other\r\ngentlemanly habits. Do what they might, there was no keeping down the\r\nbutcher. His sturdy nature would break through all their glozings. He\r\nhad a hearty vulgar good-humor that was irrepressible. His very jokes\r\nmade his sensitive daughters shudder, and he persisted in wearing his\r\nblue cotton coat of a morning, dining at two o’clock, and having a “bit\r\nof sausage with his tea.”\r\n\r\nHe was doomed, however, to share the unpopularity of his family. He\r\nfound his old comrades gradually growing cold and civil to him, no\r\nlonger laughing at his jokes, and now and then throwing out a fling at\r\n“some people” and a hint about “quality binding.” This both nettled\r\nand perplexed the honest butcher; and his wife and daughters, with\r\nthe consummate policy of the shrewder sex, taking advantage of the\r\ncircumstance, at length prevailed upon him to give up his afternoon’s\r\npipe and tankard at Wagstaff’s, to sit after dinner by himself and\r\ntake his pint of port--a liquor he detested--and to nod in his chair in\r\nsolitary and dismal gentility.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Lambs might now be seen flaunting along the streets in French\r\nbonnets with unknown beaux, and talking and laughing so loud that it\r\ndistressed the nerves of every good lady within hearing. They even went\r\nso far as to attempt patronage, and actually induced a French dancing\r\nmaster to set up in the neighborhood; but the worthy folks of Little\r\nBritain took fire at it, and did so persecute the poor Gaul that he\r\nwas fain to pack up fiddle and dancing-pumps and decamp with such\r\nprecipitation that he absolutely forgot to pay for his lodgings.\r\n\r\nI had flattered myself, at first, with the idea that all this fiery\r\nindignation on the part of the community was merely the overflowing of\r\ntheir zeal for good old English manners and their horror of innovation,\r\nand I applauded the silent contempt they were so vociferous in\r\nexpressing for upstart pride, French fashions and the Miss Lambs. But\r\nI grieve to say that I soon perceived the infection had taken hold,\r\nand that my neighbors, after condemning, were beginning to follow their\r\nexample. I overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their\r\ndaughters have one quarter at French and music, and that they might take\r\na few lessons in quadrille. I even saw, in the course of a few Sundays,\r\nno less than five French bonnets, precisely like those of the Miss\r\nLambs, parading about Little Britain.\r\n\r\nI still had my hopes that all this folly would gradually die away, that\r\nthe Lambs might move out of the neighborhood, might die, or might run\r\naway with attorneys’ apprentices, and that quiet and simplicity might be\r\nagain restored to the community. But unluckily a rival power arose. An\r\nopulent oilman died, and left a widow with a large jointure and a family\r\nof buxom daughters. The young ladies had long been repining in secret\r\nat the parsimony of a prudent father, which kept down all their elegant\r\naspirings. Their ambition, being now no longer restrained, broke out\r\ninto a blaze, and they openly took the field against the family of the\r\nbutcher. It is true that the Lambs, having had the first start, had\r\nnaturally an advantage of them in the fashionable career. They could\r\nspeak a little bad French, play the piano, dance quadrilles, and had\r\nformed high acquaintances; but the Trotters were not to be distanced.\r\nWhen the Lambs appeared with two feathers in their hats, the Miss\r\nTrotters mounted four and of twice as fine colors. If the Lambs gave\r\na dance, the Trotters were sure not to be behindhand; and, though they\r\nmight not boast of as good company, yet they had double the number and\r\nwere twice as merry.\r\n\r\nThe whole community has at length divided itself into fashionable\r\nfactions under the banners of these two families. The old games of\r\nPope-Joan and Tom-come-tickle-me are entirely discarded; there is no\r\nsuch thing as getting up an honest country dance; and on my attempting\r\nto kiss a young lady under the mistletoe last Christmas, I was\r\nindignantly repulsed, the Miss Lambs having pronounced it “shocking\r\nvulgar.” Bitter rivalry has also broken out as to the most fashionable\r\npart of Little Britain, the Lambs standing up for the dignity\r\nof Cross-Keys Square, and the Trotters for the vicinity of St.\r\nBartholomew’s.\r\n\r\nThus is this little territory torn by factions and internal dissensions,\r\nlike the great empire whose name it bears; and what will be the result\r\nwould puzzle the apothecary himself, with all his talent at prognostics,\r\nto determine, though I apprehend that it will terminate in the total\r\ndownfall of genuine John Bullism.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effects are extremely unpleasant to me. Being a single\r\nman, and, as I observed before, rather an idle good-for-nothing\r\npersonage, I have been considered the only gentleman by profession in\r\nthe place. I stand therefore in high favor with both parties, and have\r\nto hear all their cabinet counsels and mutual backbitings. As I am too\r\ncivil not to agree with the ladies on all occasions, I have committed\r\nmyself most horribly with both parties by abusing their opponents.\r\nI might manage to reconcile this to my conscience, which is a truly\r\naccommodating one, but I cannot to my apprehension: if the Lambs and\r\nTrotters ever come to a reconciliation and compare notes, I am ruined!\r\n\r\nI have determined, therefore, to beat a retreat in time, and am actually\r\nlooking out for some other nest in this great city where old English\r\nmanners are still kept up, where French is neither eaten, drunk, danced,\r\nnor spoken, and where there are no fashionable families of retired\r\ntradesmen. This found, I will, like a veteran rat, hasten away before I\r\nhave an old house about my ears, bid a long, though a sorrowful adieu\r\nto my present abode, and leave the rival factions of the Lambs and the\r\nTrotters to divide the distracted empire of LITTLE BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATFORD-ON-AVON.\r\n\r\nThou soft-flowing Avon, by thy silver stream Of things more than mortal\r\nsweet Shakespeare would dream The fairies by moonlight dance round his\r\ngreen bed, For hallow’d the turf is which pillow’d his head.\r\n\r\nGARRICK.\r\n\r\nTO a homeless man, who has no spot on this wide world which he can\r\ntruly call his own, there is a momentary feeling of something like\r\nindependence and territorial consequence when, after a weary day’s\r\ntravel, he kicks off his boots, thrusts his feet into slippers, and\r\nstretches himself before an inn-fire. Let the world without go as it\r\nmay, let kingdoms rise or fall, so long as he has the wherewithal to pay\r\nhis bill he is, for the time being, the very monarch of all he surveys.\r\nThe armchair is his throne, the poker his sceptre, and the little\r\nparlor, some twelve feet square, his undisputed empire. It is a morsel\r\nof certainty, snatched from the midst of the uncertainties of life; it\r\nis a sunny moment gleaming out kindly on a cloudy day: and he who has\r\nadvanced some way on the pilgrimage of existence knows the importance of\r\nhusbanding even morsels and moments of enjoyment. “Shall I not take mine\r\nease in mine inn?” thought I, as I gave the fire a stir, lolled back in\r\nmy elbow-chair, and cast a complacent look about the little parlor of\r\nthe Red Horse at Stratford-on-Avon.\r\n\r\nThe words of sweet Shakespeare were just passing through my mind as\r\nthe clock struck midnight from the tower of the church in which he lies\r\nburied. There was a gentle tap at the door, and a pretty chambermaid,\r\nputting in her smiling face, inquired, with a hesitating air, whether I\r\nhad rung. I understood it as a modest hint that it was time to retire.\r\nMy dream of absolute dominion was at an end; so abdicating my throne,\r\nlike a prudent potentate, to avoid being deposed, and putting the\r\nStratford Guide-Book under my arm as a pillow companion, I went to bed,\r\nand dreamt all night of Shakespeare, the jubilee, and David Garrick.\r\n\r\nThe next morning was one of those quickening mornings which we sometimes\r\nhave in early spring, for it was about the middle of March. The chills\r\nof a long winter had suddenly given way; the north wind had spent its\r\nlast gasp; and a mild air came stealing from the west, breathing the\r\nbreath of life into Nature, and wooing every bud and flower to burst\r\nforth into fragrance and beauty.\r\n\r\nI had come to Stratford on a poetical pilgrimage. My first visit was to\r\nthe house where Shakespeare was born, and where, according to tradition,\r\nhe was brought up to his father’s craft of wool-combing. It is a small\r\nmean-looking edifice of wood and plaster, a true nestling-place of\r\ngenius, which seems to delight in hatching its offspring in by-corners.\r\nThe walls of its squalid chambers are covered with names and\r\ninscriptions in every language by pilgrims of all nations, ranks, and\r\nconditions, from the prince to the peasant, and present a simple but\r\nstriking instance of the spontaneous and universal homage of mankind to\r\nthe great poet of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe house is shown by a garrulous old lady in a frosty red face, lighted\r\nup by a cold blue, anxious eye, and garnished with artificial locks\r\nof flaxen hair curling from under an exceedingly dirty cap. She was\r\npeculiarly assiduous in exhibiting the relics with which this, like all\r\nother celebrated shrines, abounds. There was the shattered stock of\r\nthe very matchlock with which Shakespeare shot the deer on his poaching\r\nexploits. There, too, was his tobacco-box, which proves that he was a\r\nrival smoker of Sir Walter Raleigh: the sword also with which he played\r\nHamlet; and the identical lantern with which Friar Laurence discovered\r\nRomeo and Juliet at the tomb. There was an ample supply also of\r\nShakespeare’s mulberry tree, which seems to have as extraordinary powers\r\nof self-multiplication as the wood of the true cross, of which there is\r\nenough extant to build a ship of the line.\r\n\r\nThe most favorite object of curiosity, however, is Shakespeare’s chair.\r\nIt stands in a chimney-nook of a small gloomy chamber just behind what\r\nwas his father’s shop. Here he may many a time have sat when a boy,\r\nwatching the slowly revolving spit with all the longing of an urchin, or\r\nof an evening listening to the cronies and gossips of Stratford dealing\r\nforth churchyard tales and legendary anecdotes of the troublesome times\r\nof England. In this chair it is the custom of every one that visits the\r\nhouse to sit: whether this be done with the hope of imbibing any of\r\nthe inspiration of the bard I am at a loss to say; I merely mention the\r\nfact, and mine hostess privately assured me that, though built of solid\r\noak, such was the fervent zeal of devotees the chair had to be new\r\nbottomed at least once in three years. It is worthy of notice also, in\r\nthe history of this extraordinary chair, that it partakes something of\r\nthe volatile nature of the Santa Casa of Loretto, or the flying chair\r\nof the Arabian enchanter; for, though sold some few years since to a\r\nnorthern princess, yet, strange to tell, it has found its way back again\r\nto the old chimney-corner.\r\n\r\nI am always of easy faith in such matters, and am ever willing to be\r\ndeceived where the deceit is pleasant and costs nothing. I am therefore\r\na ready believer in relics, legends, and local anecdotes of goblins\r\nand great men, and would advise all travellers who travel for their\r\ngratification to be the same. What is it to us whether these stories be\r\ntrue or false, so long as we can persuade ourselves into the belief\r\nof them and enjoy all the charm of the reality? There is nothing like\r\nresolute good-humored credulity in these matters, and on this occasion I\r\nwent even so far as willingly to believe the claims of mine hostess to a\r\nlineal descent from the poet, when, unluckily for my faith, she put into\r\nmy hands a play of her own composition, which set all belief in her own\r\nconsanguinity at defiance.\r\n\r\nFrom the birthplace of Shakespeare a few paces brought me to his\r\ngrave. He lies buried in the chancel of the parish church, a large and\r\nvenerable pile, mouldering with age, but richly ornamented. It stands on\r\nthe banks of the Avon on an embowered point, and separated by adjoining\r\ngardens from the suburbs of the town. Its situation is quiet and\r\nretired; the river runs murmuring at the foot of the churchyard, and\r\nthe elms which grow upon its banks droop their branches into its clear\r\nbosom. An avenue of limes, the boughs of which are curiously interlaced,\r\nso as to form in summer an arched way of foliage, leads up from the gate\r\nof the yard to the church-porch. The graves are overgrown with grass;\r\nthe gray tombstones, some of them nearly sunk into the earth, are half\r\ncovered with moss, which has likewise tinted the reverend old building.\r\nSmall birds have built their nests among the cornices and fissures of\r\nthe walls, and keep up a continual flutter and chirping; and rooks are\r\nsailing and cawing about its lofty gray spire.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my rambles I met with the gray-headed sexton, Edmonds,\r\nand accompanied him home to get the key of the church. He had lived in\r\nStratford, man and boy, for eighty years, and seemed still to consider\r\nhimself a vigorous man, with the trivial exception that he had nearly\r\nlost the use of his legs for a few years past. His dwelling was a\r\ncottage looking out upon the Avon and its bordering meadows, and was a\r\npicture of that neatness, order, and comfort which pervade the humblest\r\ndwellings in this country. A low whitewashed room, with a stone floor\r\ncarefully scrubbed, served for parlor, kitchen, and hall. Rows of pewter\r\nand earthen dishes glittered along the dresser. On an old oaken table,\r\nwell rubbed and polished, lay the family Bible and prayer-book, and the\r\ndrawer contained the family library, composed of about half a score\r\nof well-thumbed volumes. An ancient clock, that important article of\r\ncottage furniture, ticked on the opposite side of the room, with\r\na bright warming-pan hanging on one side of it, and the old man’s\r\nhorn-handled Sunday cane on the other. The fireplace, as usual, was wide\r\nand deep enough to admit a gossip knot within its jambs. In one corner\r\nsat the old man’s granddaughter sewing, a pretty blue-eyed girl, and in\r\nthe opposite corner was a superannuated crony whom he addressed by\r\nthe name of John Ange, and who, I found, had been his companion from\r\nchildhood. They had played together in infancy; they had worked together\r\nin manhood; they were now tottering about and gossiping away the evening\r\nof life; and in a short time they will probably be buried together in\r\nthe neighboring churchyard. It is not often that we see two streams of\r\nexistence running thus evenly and tranquilly side by side; it is only in\r\nsuch quiet “bosom scenes” of life that they are to be met with.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to gather some traditionary anecdotes of the bard from\r\nthese ancient chroniclers, but they had nothing new to impart. The long\r\ninterval during which Shakespeare’s writings lay in comparative neglect\r\nhas spread its shadow over his history, and it is his good or evil lot\r\nthat scarcely anything remains to his biographers but a scanty handful\r\nof conjectures.\r\n\r\nThe sexton and his companion had been employed as carpenters on the\r\npreparations for the celebrated Stratford Jubilee, and they\r\nremembered Garrick, the prime mover of the fete, who superintended the\r\narrangements, and who, according to the sexton, was “a short punch man,\r\nvery lively and bustling.” John Ange had assisted also in cutting down\r\nShakespeare’s mulberry tree, of which he had a morsel in his pocket for\r\nsale; no doubt a sovereign quickener of literary conception.\r\n\r\nI was grieved to hear these two worthy wights speak very dubiously of\r\nthe eloquent dame who shows the Shakespeare house. John Ange shook\r\nhis head when I mentioned her valuable and inexhaustible collection\r\nof relics, particularly her remains of the mulberry tree; and the old\r\nsexton even expressed a doubt as to Shakespeare having been born in her\r\nhouse. I soon discovered that he looked upon her mansion with an evil\r\neye, as a rival to the poet’s tomb, the latter having comparatively but\r\nfew visitors. Thus it is that historians differ at the very outset, and\r\nmere pebbles make the stream of truth diverge into different channels\r\neven at the fountain-head.\r\n\r\nWe approached the church through the avenue of limes, and entered by a\r\nGothic porch, highly ornamented, with carved doors of massive oak. The\r\ninterior is spacious, and the architecture and embellishments superior\r\nto those of most country churches. There are several ancient monuments\r\nof nobility and gentry, over some of which hang funeral escutcheons and\r\nbanners dropping piecemeal from the walls. The tomb of Shakespeare is in\r\nthe chancel. The place is solemn and sepulchral. Tall elms wave before\r\nthe pointed windows, and the Avon, which runs at a short distance from\r\nthe walls, keeps up a low perpetual murmur. A flat stone marks the spot\r\nwhere the bard is buried. There are four lines inscribed on it, said to\r\nhave been written by himself, and which have in them something extremely\r\nawful. If they are indeed his own, they show that solicitude about\r\nthe quiet of the grave which seems natural to fine sensibilities and\r\nthoughtful minds:\r\n\r\n    Good friend, for Jesus’ sake, forbeare\r\n    To dig the dust inclosed here.\r\n    Blessed be he that spares these stones,\r\n    And curst be he that moves my bones.\r\n\r\nJust over the grave, in a niche of the wall, is a bust of Shakespeare,\r\nput up shortly after his death and considered as a resemblance. The\r\naspect is pleasant and serene, with a finely-arched forehead; and I\r\nthought I could read in it clear indications of that cheerful,\r\nsocial disposition by which he was as much characterized among his\r\ncontemporaries as by the vastness of his genius. The inscription\r\nmentions his age at the time of his decease, fifty-three years--an\r\nuntimely death for the world, for what fruit might not have been\r\nexpected from the golden autumn of such a mind, sheltered as it was\r\nfrom the stormy vicissitudes of life, and flourishing in the sunshine of\r\npopular and royal favor?\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the tombstone has not been without its effect. It has\r\nprevented the removal of his remains from the bosom of his native place\r\nto Westminster Abbey, which was at one time contemplated. A few years\r\nsince also, as some laborers were digging to make an adjoining vault,\r\nthe earth caved in, so as to leave a vacant space almost like an arch,\r\nthrough which one might have reached into his grave. No one, however,\r\npresumed to meddle with his remains so awfully guarded by a malediction;\r\nand lest any of the idle or the curious or any collector of relics\r\nshould be tempted to commit depredations, the old sexton kept watch over\r\nthe place for two days, until the vault was finished and the aperture\r\nclosed again. He told me that he had made bold to look in at the\r\nhole, but could see neither coffin nor bones--nothing but dust. It was\r\nsomething, I thought, to have seen the dust of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nNext to this grave are those of his wife, his favorite daughter,\r\nMrs. Hall, and others of his family. On a tomb close by, also, is a\r\nfull-length effigy of his old friend John Combe, of usurious memory,\r\non whom he is said to have written a ludicrous epitaph. There are other\r\nmonuments around, but the mind refuses to dwell on anything that is not\r\nconnected with Shakespeare. His idea pervades the place; the whole pile\r\nseems but as his mausoleum. The feelings, no longer checked and thwarted\r\nby doubt, here indulge in perfect confidence: other traces of him may be\r\nfalse or dubious, but here is palpable evidence and absolute certainty.\r\nAs I trod the sounding pavement there was something intense and\r\nthrilling in the idea that in very truth the remains of Shakespeare were\r\nmouldering beneath my feet. It was a long time before I could prevail\r\nupon myself to leave the place; and as I passed through the churchyard\r\nI plucked a branch from one of the yew trees, the only relic that I have\r\nbrought from Stratford.\r\n\r\nI had now visited the usual objects of a pilgrim’s devotion, but I had\r\na desire to see the old family seat of the Lucys at Charlecot, and to\r\nramble through the park where Shakespeare, in company with some of\r\nthe roisterers of Stratford, committed his youthful offence of\r\ndeer-stealing. In this harebrained exploit we are told that he was taken\r\nprisoner and carried to the keeper’s lodge, where he remained all night\r\nin doleful captivity. When brought into the presence of Sir Thomas Lucy\r\nhis treatment must have been galling and humiliating; for it so wrought\r\nupon his spirit as to produce a rough pasquinade which was affixed to\r\nthe park gate at Charlecot.*\r\n\r\nThis flagitious attack upon the dignity of the knight so incensed him\r\nthat he applied to a lawyer at Warwick to put the severity of the laws\r\nin force against the rhyming deer-stalker. Shakespeare did not wait\r\nto brave the united puissance of a knight of the shire and a country\r\nattorney. He forthwith abandoned the pleasant banks of the Avon and\r\nhis paternal trade; wandered away to London; became a hanger-on to the\r\ntheatres; then an actor; and finally wrote for the stage; and\r\nthus, through the persecution of Sir Thomas Lucy, Stratford lost an\r\nindifferent wool-comber and the world gained an immortal poet. He\r\nretained, however, for a long time, a sense of the harsh treatment of\r\nthe lord of Charlecot, and revenged himself in his writings, but in\r\nthe sportive way of a good-natured mind. Sir Thomas is said to be the\r\noriginal of Justice Shallow, and the satire is slyly fixed upon him by\r\nthe justice’s armorial bearings, which, like those of the knight, had\r\nwhite luces+ in the quarterings.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The following is the only stanza extant of this lampoon:\r\n\r\n    A parliament member, a justice of peace,\r\n    At home a poor scarecrow, at London an asse,\r\n    If lowsie is Lucy, as some volke miscalle it,\r\n    Then Lucy is lowsie, whatever befall it.\r\n        He thinks himself great;\r\n        Yet an asse in his state,\r\n    We allow by his ears but with asses to mate,\r\n    If Lucy is lowsie, as some volke miscalle it,\r\n    Then sing lowsie Lucy whatever befall it.\r\n\r\n     + The luce is a pike or jack, and abounds in the Avon about\r\n     Charlecot.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made by his biographers to soften and explain\r\naway this early transgression of the poet; but I look upon it as one of\r\nthose thoughtless exploits natural to his situation and turn of mind.\r\nShakespeare, when young, had doubtless all the wildness and irregularity\r\nof an ardent, undisciplined, and undirected genius. The poetic\r\ntemperament has naturally something in it of the vagabond. When left to\r\nitself it runs loosely and wildly, and delights in everything eccentric\r\nand licentious. It is often a turn up of a die, in the gambling freaks\r\nof fate, whether a natural genius shall turn out a great rogue or a\r\ngreat poet; and had not Shakespeare’s mind fortunately taken a literary\r\nbias, he might have as daringly transcended all civil as he has all\r\ndramatic laws.\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that, in early life, when running like an unbroken\r\ncolt about the neighborbood of Stratford, he was to be found in the\r\ncompany of all kinds of odd anomalous characters, that he associated\r\nwith all the madcaps of the place, and was one of those unlucky urchins\r\nat mention of whom old men shake their heads and predict that they will\r\none day come to the gallows. To him the poaching in Sir Thomas Lucy’s\r\npark was doubtless like a foray to a Scottish knight, and struck\r\nhis eager, and as yet untamed, imagination as something delightfully\r\nadventurous.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * A proof of Shakespeare’s random habits and associates in\r\n     his youthful days may be found in a traditionary anecdote,\r\n     picked up at Stratford by the elder Ireland, and mentioned\r\n     in his “Picturesque Views on the Avon.”\r\n\r\nAbout seven miles from Stratford lies the thirsty little market-town of\r\nBedford, famous for its ale. Two societies of the village yeomanry used\r\nto meet, under the appellation of the Bedford topers, and to challenge\r\nthe lovers of good ale of the neighboring villages to a contest of\r\ndrinking. Among others, the people of Stratford were called out to prove\r\nthe strength of their heads; and in the number of the champions was\r\nShakespeare, who, in spite of the proverb that “they who drink beer\r\nwill think beer,” was as true to his ale as Falstaff to his sack. The\r\nchivalry of Stratford was staggered at the first onset, and sounded a\r\nretreat while they had yet the legs to carry them off the field. They\r\nhad scarcely marched a mile when, their legs failing them, they were\r\nforced to lie down under a crab tree, where they passed the night. It\r\nwas still standing, and goes by the name of Shakespeare’s tree.\r\n\r\nIn the morning his companions awaked the bard, and proposed returning to\r\nBedford, but he declined, saying he had enough, having drank with\r\n\r\n    “Piping Pebworth, Dancing Marston,\r\n    Haunted Hilbro’, Hungry Grafton,\r\n    Dudging Exhall, Papist Wicksford,\r\n    Beggarly Broom, and Drunken Bedford.”\r\n\r\n“The villages here alluded to,” says Ireland, “still bear the epithets\r\nthus given them: the people of Pebworth are still famed for their skill\r\non the pipe and tabor; Hilborough is now called Haunted Hilborough; and\r\nGrafton is famous for the poverty of its soil.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old mansion of Charlecot and its surrounding park still remain in\r\nthe possession of the Lucy family, and are peculiarly interesting front\r\nbeing connected with this whimsical but eventful circumstance in the\r\nscanty history of the bard. As the house stood at little more than three\r\nmiles’ distance from Stratford, I resolved to pay it a pedestrian visit,\r\nthat I might stroll leisurely through some of those scenes from which\r\nShakespeare must have derived his earliest ideas of rural imagery.\r\n\r\nThe country was yet naked and leafless, but English scenery is always\r\nverdant, and the sudden change in the temperature of the weather\r\nwas surprising in its quickening effects upon the landscape. It was\r\ninspiring and animating to witness this first awakening of spring; to\r\nfeel its warm breath stealing over the senses; to see the moist mellow\r\nearth beginning to put forth the green sprout and the tender blade, and\r\nthe trees and shrubs, in their reviving tints and bursting buds, giving\r\nthe promise of returning foliage and flower. The cold snow-drop, that\r\nlittle borderer on the skirts of winter, was to be seen with its chaste\r\nwhite blossoms in the small gardens before the cottages. The bleating\r\nof the new-dropt lambs was faintly heard from the fields. The sparrow\r\ntwittered about the thatched eaves and budding hedges; the robin threw\r\na livelier note into his late querulous wintry strain; and the lark,\r\nspringing up from the reeking bosom of the meadow, towered away into the\r\nbright fleecy cloud, pouring forth torrents of melody. As I watched the\r\nlittle songster mounting up higher and higher, until his body was a mere\r\nspeck on the white bosom of the cloud, while the ear was still filled\r\nwith his music, it called to mind Shakespeare’s exquisite little song in\r\nCymbeline:\r\n\r\n    Hark! hark! the lark at heav’n’s gate sings,\r\n        And Phoebus ‘gins arise,\r\n    His steeds to water at those springs,\r\n        On chaliced flowers that lies.\r\n\r\n    And winking mary-buds begin\r\n        To ope their golden eyes;\r\n    With every thing that pretty bin,\r\n        My lady sweet arise!\r\n\r\nIndeed, the whole country about here is poetic ground: everything is\r\nassociated with the idea of Shakespeare. Every old cottage that I saw\r\nI fancied into some resort of his boyhood, where he had acquired his\r\nintimate knowledge of rustic life and manners, and heard those legendary\r\ntales and wild superstitions which he has woven like witchcraft into\r\nhis dramas. For in his time, we are told, it was a popular amusement in\r\nwinter evenings “to sit round the fire, and tell merry tales of errant\r\nknights, queens, lovers, lords, ladies, giants, dwarfs, thieves,\r\ncheaters, witches, fairies, goblins, and friars.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Scot, in his “Discoverie of Witchcraft,” enumerates a of\r\n     these fireside fancies: “And they have so fraid us with host\r\n     bull-beggars, spirits, witches, urchins, elves, hags,\r\n     fairies, satyrs, pans, faunes, syrens, kit with the can\r\n     sticke, tritons, centaurs, dwarfes, giantes, imps, calcars,\r\n     conjurors, nymphes, changelings, incubus, Robin-goodfellow,\r\n     the spoorne, the mare, the man in the oke, the hell-waine,\r\n     the fier drake, the puckle, Tom Thombe, hobgoblins, Tom\r\n     Tumbler, boneless, and such other bugs, that we were afraid\r\n     of our own shadowes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMy route for a part of the way lay in sight of the Avon, which made\r\na variety of the most fancy doublings and windings through a wide and\r\nfertile valley--sometimes glittering from among willows which fringed\r\nits borders; sometimes disappearing among groves or beneath green banks;\r\nand sometimes rambling out into full view and making an azure sweep\r\nround a slope of meadow-land. This beautiful bosom of country is called\r\nthe Vale of the Red Horse. A distant line of undulating blue hills seems\r\nto be its boundary, whilst all the soft intervening landscape lies in a\r\nmanner enchained in the silver links of the Avon.\r\n\r\nAfter pursuing the road for about three miles, I turned off into a\r\nfootpath, which led along the borders of fields and under hedgerows to a\r\nprivate gate of the park; there was a stile, however, for the benefit of\r\nthe pedestrian, there being a public right of way through the grounds.\r\nI delight in these hospitable estates, in which every one has a kind\r\nof property--at least as far as the footpath is concerned. It in some\r\nmeasure reconciles a poor man to his lot, and, what is more, to the\r\nbetter lot of his neighbor, thus to have parks and pleasure-grounds\r\nthrown open for his recreation. He breathes the pure air as freely and\r\nlolls as luxuriously under the shade as the lord of the soil; and if he\r\nhas not the privilege of calling all that he sees his own, he has not,\r\nat the same time, the trouble of paying for it and keeping it in order.\r\n\r\nI now found myself among noble avenues of oaks and elms, whose vast size\r\nbespoke the growth of centuries. The wind sounded solemnly among\r\ntheir branches, and the rooks cawed from their hereditary nests in the\r\ntree-tops. The eye ranged through a long lessening vista, with nothing\r\nto interrupt the view but a distant statue and a vagrant deer stalking\r\nlike a shadow across the opening.\r\n\r\nThere is something about these stately old avenues that has the effect\r\nof Gothic architecture, not merely from the pretended similarity of\r\nform, but from their bearing the evidence of long duration, and of\r\nhaving had their origin in a period of time with which we associate\r\nideas of romantic grandeur. They betoken also the long-settled dignity\r\nand proudly-concentrated independence of an ancient family; and I have\r\nheard a worthy but aristocratic old friend observe, when speaking of the\r\nsumptuous palaces of modern gentry, that “money could do much with\r\nstone and mortar, but thank Heaven! there was no such thing as suddenly\r\nbuilding up an avenue of oaks.”\r\n\r\nIt was from wandering in early life among this rich scenery, and about\r\nthe romantic solitudes of the adjoining park of Fullbroke, which then\r\nformed a part of the Lucy estate, that some of Shakepeare’s commentators\r\nhave supposed he derived his noble forest meditations of Jaques and\r\nthe enchanting woodland pictures in “As You Like It.” It is in lonely\r\nwanderings through such scenes that the mind drinks deep but quiet\r\ndraughts of inspiration, and becomes intensely sensible of the beauty\r\nand majesty of Nature. The imagination kindles into reverie and rapture,\r\nvague but exquisite images and ideas keep breaking upon it, and we revel\r\nin a mute and almost incommunicable luxury of thought. It was in some\r\nsuch mood, and perhaps under one of those very trees before me, which\r\nthrew their broad shades over the grassy banks and quivering waters of\r\nthe Avon, that the poet’s fancy may have sallied forth into that little\r\nsong which breathes the very soul of a rural voluptuary\r\n\r\n    Unto the greenwood tree,\r\n    Who loves to lie with me\r\n    And tune his merry throat\r\n    Unto the sweet bird’s note,\r\n    Come hither, come hither, come hither.\r\n        Here shall he see\r\n        No enemy,\r\n    But winter and rough weather.\r\n\r\nI had now come in sight of the house. It is a large building of brick\r\nwith stone quoins, and is in the Gothic style of Queen Elizabeth’s day,\r\nhaving been built in the first year of her reign. The exterior remains\r\nvery nearly in its original state, and may be considered a fair specimen\r\nof the residence of a wealthy country gentleman of those days. A great\r\ngateway opens from the park into a kind of courtyard in front of the\r\nhouse, ornamented with a grassplot, shrubs, and flower-beds. The gateway\r\nis in imitation of the ancient barbacan, being a kind of outpost and\r\nflanked by towers, though evidently for mere ornament, instead of\r\ndefence. The front of the house is completely in the old style with\r\nstone-shafted casements, a great bow-window of heavy stone-work, and a\r\nportal with armorial bearings over it carved in stone. At each corner\r\nof the building is an octagon tower surmounted by a gilt ball and\r\nweather-cock.\r\n\r\nThe Avon, which winds through the park, makes a bend just at the foot\r\nof a gently-sloping bank which sweeps down from the rear of the house.\r\nLarge herds of deer were feeding or reposing upon its borders, and\r\nswans were sailing majestically upon its bosom. As I contemplated the\r\nvenerable old mansion I called to mind Falstaff’s encomium on Justice\r\nShallow’s abode, and the affected indifference and real vanity of the\r\nlatter:\r\n\r\n“Falstaff. You have a goodly dwelling and a rich. Shallow. Barren,\r\nbarren, barren; beggars all, beggars all, Sir John:--marry, good air.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the joviality of the old mansion in the days of\r\nShakespeare, it had now an air of stillness and solitude. The great iron\r\ngateway that opened into the courtyard was locked, there was no show\r\nof servants bustling about the place; the deer gazed quietly at me as I\r\npassed, being no longer harried by the moss-troopers of Stratford. The\r\nonly sign of domestic life that I met with was a white cat stealing with\r\nwary look and stealthy pace towards the stables, as if on some nefarious\r\nexpedition. I must not omit to mention the carcass of a scoundrel crow\r\nwhich I saw suspended against the barn-wall, as it shows that the Lucys\r\nstill inherit that lordly abhorrence of poachers and maintain that\r\nrigorous exercise of territorial power which was so strenuously\r\nmanifested in the case of the bard.\r\n\r\nAfter prowling about for some time, I at length found my way to a\r\nlateral portal, which was the every-day entrance to the mansion. I was\r\ncourteously received by a worthy old housekeeper, who, with the civility\r\nand communicativeness of her order, showed me the interior of the house.\r\nThe greater part has undergone alterations and been adapted to modern\r\ntastes and modes of living: there is a fine old oaken staircase, and the\r\ngreat hall, that noble feature in an ancient manor-house, still retains\r\nmuch of the appearance it must have had in the days of Shakespeare. The\r\nceiling is arched and lofty, and at one end is a gallery in which stands\r\nan organ. The weapons and trophies of the chase, which formerly adorned\r\nthe hall of a country gentleman, have made way for family portraits.\r\nThere is a wide, hospitable fireplace, calculated for an ample\r\nold-fashioned wood fire, formerly the rallying-place of winter\r\nfestivity. On the opposite side of the hall is the huge Gothic\r\nbow-window, with stone shafts, which looks out upon the courtyard. Here\r\nare emblazoned in stained glass the armorial bearings of the Lucy family\r\nfor many generations, some being dated in 1558. I was delighted to\r\nobserve in the quarterings the three white luces by which the character\r\nof Sir Thomas was first identified with that of Justice Shallow. They\r\nare mentioned in the first scene of the “Merry Wives of Windsor,” where\r\nthe Justice is in a rage with Falstaff for having “beaten his men,\r\nkilled his deer, and broken into his lodge.” The poet had no doubt the\r\noffences of himself and his comrades in mind at the time, and we may\r\nsuppose the family pride and vindictive threats of the puissant Shallow\r\nto be a caricature of the pompous indignation of Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n“Shallow. Sir Hugh, persuade me not: I will make a Star Chamber matter\r\nof it; if he were twenty John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Sir Robert\r\nShallow, Esq.\r\n\r\nSlender. In the county of Gloster, justice of peace and coram.\r\n\r\nShallow. Ay, cousin Slender, and custalorum.\r\n\r\nSlender. Ay, and ratolorum too, and a gentleman born, master parson; who\r\nwrites himself Armigero in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation,\r\nArmigero.\r\n\r\nShallow. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSlender. All his successors gone before him have done’t, and all his\r\nancestors that come after him may; they may give the dozen white luces\r\nin their coat....\r\n\r\nShallow. The council shall hear it; it is a riot.\r\n\r\nEvans. It is not meet the council hear of a riot; there is no fear of\r\nGot in a riot; the council, hear you, shall desire to hear the fear of\r\nGot, and not to hear a riot; take your vizaments in that.\r\n\r\nShallow. Ha! o’ my life, if I were young again, the sword should end\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nNear the window thus emblazoned hung a portrait, by Sir Peter Lely,\r\nof one of the Lucy family, a great beauty of the time of Charles\r\nthe Second: the old housekeeper shook her head as she pointed to the\r\npicture, and informed me that this lady had been sadly addicted to\r\ncards, and had gambled away a great portion of the family estate, among\r\nwhich was that part of the park where Shakespeare and his comrades had\r\nkilled the deer. The lands thus lost had not been entirely regained by\r\nthe family even at the present day. It is but justice to this recreant\r\ndame to confess that she had a surpassingly fine hand and arm.\r\n\r\nThe picture which most attracted my attention was a great painting over\r\nthe fireplace, containing likenesses of Sir Thomas Lucy and his family\r\nwho inhabited the hall in the latter part of Shakespeare’s lifetime.\r\nI at first thought that it was the vindictive knight himself, but the\r\nhousekeeper assured me that it was his son; the only likeness extant\r\nof the former being an effigy upon his tomb in the church of the\r\nneighboring hamlet of Charlecot.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * This effigy is in white marble, and represents the knight\r\n     in complete armor. Near him lies the effigy of his wife, and\r\n     on her tomb is the following inscription; which, if really\r\n     composed by her husband, places him quite above the\r\n     intellectual level of Master Shallow:\r\n\r\n     Here lyeth the Lady Joyce Lucy wife of Sir Thomas Lucy of\r\n     Charlecot in ye county of Warwick, Knight, Daughter and heir\r\n     of Thomas Acton of Sutton in ye county of Worcester Esquire\r\n     who departed out of this wretched world to her heavenly\r\n     kingdom ye 10 day of February in ye yeare of our Lord God\r\n     1595 and of her age 60 and three. All the time of her lyfe a\r\n     true and faythful servant of her good God, never detected of\r\n     any cryme or vice. In religion most sounde, in love to her\r\n     husband most faythful and true. In friendship most constant;\r\n     to what in trust was committed unto her most secret. In\r\n     wisdom excelling. In governing of her house, bringing up of\r\n     youth in ye fear of God that did converse with her moste\r\n     rare and singular. A great maintayner of hospitality.\r\n     Greatly esteemed of her betters; misliked of none unless of\r\n     the envyous. When all is spoken that can be saide a woman so\r\n     garnished with virtue as not to be bettered and hardly to be\r\n     equalled by any. As shee lived most virtuotisly so shee died\r\n     most Godly. Set downe by him yt best did knowe what hath byn\r\n     written to be true.\r\n\r\n     Thomas Lucye.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe picture gives a lively idea of the costume and manners of the time.\r\nSir Thomas is dressed in ruff and doublet, white shoes with roses in\r\nthem, and has a peaked yellow, or, as Master Slender would say, “a\r\ncane-colored beard.” His lady is seated on the opposite side of the\r\npicture in wide ruff and long stomacher, and the children have a most\r\nvenerable stiffness and formality of dress. Hounds and spaniels are\r\nmingled in the family group; a hawk is seated on his perch in the\r\nforeground, and one of the children holds a bow, all intimating the\r\nknight’s skill in hunting, hawking, and archery, so indispensable to an\r\naccomplished gentleman in those days.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Bishop Earle, speaking of the country gentleman of his\r\n     time, observes, “His housekeeping is seen much in the\r\n     different families of dogs and serving-men attendant on\r\n     their kennels; and the deepness of their throats is the\r\n     depth of his discourse. A hawk he esteems the true burden of\r\n     nobility, and is exceedingly ambitious to seem delighted\r\n     with the sport, and have his fist gloved with his jesses.”\r\n      And Gilpin, in his description of a Mr. Hastings, remarks,\r\n     “He kept all sorts of hounds that run buck, fox, hare,\r\n     otter, and badger; and had hawks of all kinds both long and\r\n     short winged. His great hall was commonly strewed with\r\n     marrow-bones, and full of hawk perches, hounds, spaniels,\r\n     and terriers. On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay some\r\n     of the choicest terriers, hounds, and spaniels.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI regretted to find that the ancient furniture of the hall had\r\ndisappeared; for I had hoped to meet with the stately elbow-chair of\r\ncarved oak in which the country squire of former days was wont to sway\r\nthe sceptre of empire over his rural domains, and in which it might be\r\npresumed the redoubled Sir Thomas sat enthroned in awful state when\r\nthe recreant Shakespeare was brought before him. As I like to deck out\r\npictures for my own entertainment, I pleased myself with the idea that\r\nthis very hall had been the scene of the unlucky bard’s examination on\r\nthe morning after his captivity in the lodge. I fancied to myself the\r\nrural potentate surrounded by his body-guard of butler, pages, and\r\nblue-coated serving-men with their badges, while the luckless culprit\r\nwas brought in, forlorn and chopfallen, in the custody of gamekeepers,\r\nhuntsmen, and whippers-in, and followed by a rabble rout of country\r\nclowns. I fancied bright faces of curious housemaids peeping from the\r\nhalf-opened doors, while from the gallery the fair daughters of the\r\nknight leaned gracefully forward, eyeing the youthful prisoner with that\r\npity “that dwells in womanhood.” Who would have thought that this poor\r\nvarlet, thus trembling before the brief authority of a country squire,\r\nand the sport of rustic boors, was soon to become the delight of\r\nprinces, the theme of all tongues and ages, the dictator to the human\r\nmind and was to confer immortality on his oppressor by a caricature and\r\na lampoon?\r\n\r\nI was now invited by the butler to walk into the garden, and I felt\r\ninclined to visit the orchard and harbor where the justice treated Sir\r\nJohn Falstaff and Cousin Silence “to a last year’s pippin of his own\r\ngrafting, with a dish of caraways;” but I had already spent so much\r\nof the day in my ramblings that I was obliged to give up any further\r\ninvestigations. When about to take my leave I was gratified by the\r\ncivil entreaties of the housekeeper and butler that I would take some\r\nrefreshment--an instance of good old hospitality which, I grieve to say,\r\nwe castle-hunters seldom meet with in modern days. I make no doubt it is\r\na virtue which the present representative of the Lucys inherits from\r\nhis ancestors; for Shakespeare, even in his caricature, makes Justice\r\nShallow importunate in this respect, as witness his pressing instances\r\nto Falstaff:\r\n\r\n“By cock and pye, Sir, you shall not away to-night..... I will not\r\nexcuse you; you shall not be excused; excuses shall not be admitted;\r\nthere is no excuse shall serve; you shall not be excused.... Some\r\npigeons, Davy, a couple of short-legged hens; a joint of mutton; and any\r\npretty little tiny kickshaws, tell ‘William Cook.’”\r\n\r\nI now bade a reluctant farewell to the old hall. My mind had become so\r\ncompletely possessed by the imaginary scenes and characters connected\r\nwith it that I seemed to be actually living among them. Everything\r\nbrought them as it were before my eyes, and as the door of the\r\ndining-room opened I almost expected to hear the feeble voice of Master\r\nSilence quavering forth his favorite ditty:\r\n\r\n    “‘Tis merry in hall, when beards wag all,\r\n      And welcome merry Shrove-tide!”\r\n\r\nOn returning to my inn I could not but reflect on the singular gift of\r\nthe poet, to be able thus to spread the magic of his mind over the very\r\nface of Nature, to give to things and places a charm and character\r\nnot their own, and to turn this “working-day world” into a perfect\r\nfairy-land. He is indeed the true enchanter, whose spell operates,\r\nnot upon the senses, but upon the imagination and the heart. Under the\r\nwizard influence of Shakespeare I had been walking all day in a complete\r\ndelusion. I had surveyed the landscape through the prism of poetry,\r\nwhich tinged every object with the hues of the rainbow. I had been\r\nsurrounded with fancied beings, with mere airy nothings conjured up\r\nby poetic power, yet which, to me, had all the charm of reality. I had\r\nheard Jaques soliloquize beneath his oak; had beheld the fair Rosalind\r\nand her companion adventuring through the woodlands; and, above all,\r\nhad been once more present in spirit with fat Jack Falstaff and his\r\ncontemporaries, from the august Justice Shallow down to the gentle\r\nMaster Slender and the sweet Anne Page. Ten thousand honors and\r\nblessings on the bard who has thus gilded the dull realities of life\r\nwith innocent illusions, who has spread exquisite and unbought pleasures\r\nin my chequered path, and beguiled my spirit in many a lonely hour with\r\nall the cordial and cheerful sympathies of social life!\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the bridge over the Avon on my return, I paused to\r\ncontemplate the distant church in which the poet lies buried, and could\r\nnot but exult in the malediction which has kept his ashes undisturbed\r\nin its quiet and hallowed vaults. What honor could his name have\r\nderived from being mingled in dusty companionship with the epitaphs\r\nand escutcheons and venal eulogiums of a titled multitude? What would\r\na crowded corner in Westminster Abbey have been, compared with this\r\nreverend pile, which seems to stand in beautiful loneliness as his sole\r\nmausoleum! The solitude about the grave may be but the offspring of\r\nan overwrought sensibility; but human nature is made up of foibles and\r\nprejudices, and its best and tenderest affections are mingled with these\r\nfactitious feelings. He who has sought renown about the world, and has\r\nreaped a full harvest of worldly favor, will find, after all, that there\r\nis no love, no admiration, no applause, so sweet to the soul as that\r\nwhich springs up in his native place. It is there that he seeks to be\r\ngathered in peace and honor among his kindred and his early friends. And\r\nwhen the weary heart and failing head begin to warn him that the evening\r\nof life is drawing on, he turns as fondly as does the infant to\r\nthe mother’s arms to sink to sleep in the bosom of the scene of his\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nHow would it have cheered the spirit of the youthful bard when,\r\nwandering forth in disgrace upon a doubtful world, he cast back a heavy\r\nlook upon his paternal home, could he have foreseen that before many\r\nyears he should return to it covered with renown; that his name should\r\nbecome the boast and glory of his native place; that his ashes should\r\nbe religiously guarded as its most precious treasure; and that its\r\nlessening spire, on which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation,\r\nshould one day become the beacon towering amidst the gentle landscape to\r\nguide the literary pilgrim of every nation to his tomb!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAITS OF INDIAN CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n“I appeal to any white man if ever he entered Logan’s cabin hungry, and\r\nhe gave him not to eat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed\r\nhim not.”--Speech of au Indian Chief.\r\n\r\nTHERE is something in the character and habits of the North American\r\nsavage, taken in connection with the scenery over which he is accustomed\r\nto range, its vast lakes, boundless forests, majestic rivers, and\r\ntrackless plains, that is, to my mind, wonderfully striking and sublime.\r\nHe is formed for the wilderness, as the Arab is for the desert.\r\nHis nature is stern, simple, and enduring, fitted to grapple with\r\ndifficulties and to support privations. There seems but little soil in\r\nhis heart for the support of the kindly virtues; and yet, if we would\r\nbut take the trouble to penetrate through that proud stoicism\r\nand habitual taciturnity which lock up his character from casual\r\nobservation, we should find him linked to his fellow-man of civilized\r\nlife by more of those sympathies and affections than are usually\r\nascribed to him.\r\n\r\nIt has been the lot of the unfortunate aborigines of America in the\r\nearly periods of colonization to be doubly wronged by the white men.\r\nThey have been dispossessed of their hereditary possessions by mercenary\r\nand frequently wanton warfare, and their characters have been traduced\r\nby bigoted and interested writers. The colonists often treated them like\r\nbeasts of the forest, and the author has endeavored to justify him\r\nin his outrages. The former found it easier to exterminate than to\r\ncivilize; the latter to vilify than to discriminate. The appellations of\r\nsavage and pagan were deemed sufficient to sanction the hostilities\r\nof both; and thus the poor wanderers of the forest were persecuted and\r\ndefamed, not because they were guilty, but because they were ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the savage have seldom been properly appreciated or\r\nrespected by the white man. In peace he has too often been the dupe of\r\nartful traffic; in war he has been regarded as a ferocious animal whose\r\nlife or death was a question of mere precaution and convenience. Man\r\nis cruelly wasteful of life when his own safety is endangered and he is\r\nsheltered by impunity, and little mercy is to be expected from him\r\nwhen he feels the sting of the reptile and is conscious of the power to\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nThe same prejudices, which were indulged thus early, exist in common\r\ncirculation at the present day. Certain learned societies have, it is\r\ntrue, with laudable diligence, endeavored to investigate and record\r\nthe real characters and manners of the Indian tribes; the American\r\ngovernment, too, has wisely and humanely exerted itself to inculcate\r\na friendly and forbearing spirit towards them and to protect them from\r\nfraud and injustice.* The current opinion of the Indian character,\r\nhowever, is too apt to be formed from the miserable hordes which infest\r\nthe frontiers and hang on the skirts of the settlements. These are too\r\ncommonly composed of degenerate beings, corrupted and enfeebled by the\r\nvices of society, without being benefited by its civilization. That\r\nproud independence which formed the main pillar of savage virtue has\r\nbeen shaken down, and the whole moral fabric lies in ruins. Their\r\nspirits are humiliated and debased by a sense of inferiority, and their\r\nnative courage cowed and daunted by the superior knowledge and power of\r\ntheir enlightened neighbors. Society has advanced upon them like one of\r\nthose withering airs that will sometimes breed desolation over a whole\r\nregion of fertility. It has enervated their strength, multiplied their\r\ndiseases, and superinduced upon their original barbarity the low vices\r\nof artificial life. It has given them a thousand superfluous wants,\r\nwhilst it has diminished their means of mere existence. It has driven\r\nbefore it the animals of the chase, who fly from the sound of the axe\r\nand the smoke of the settlement and seek refuge in the depths of remoter\r\nforests and yet untrodden wilds. Thus do we too often find the Indians\r\non our frontiers to be the mere wrecks and remnants of once powerful\r\ntribes, who have lingered in the vicinity of the settlements and sunk\r\ninto precarious and vagabond existence. Poverty, repining and hopeless\r\npoverty, a canker of the mind unknown in savage life, corrodes their\r\nspirits and blights every free and noble quality of their natures. They\r\nbecome drunken, indolent, feeble, thievish, and pusillanimous. They\r\nloiter like vagrants about the settlements, among spacious dwellings\r\nreplete with elaborate comforts, which only render them sensible of\r\nthe comparative wretchedness of their own condition. Luxury spreads its\r\nample board before their eyes, but they are excluded from the banquet.\r\nPlenty revels over the fields, but they are starving in the midst of its\r\nabundance; the whole wilderness has blossomed into a garden, but they\r\nfeel as reptiles that infest it.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The American Government has been indefatigable in its\r\n     exertions to ameliorate the situation of the Indians, and to\r\n     introduce among them the arts of civilization and civil and\r\n     religious knowledge. To protect them from the frauds of the\r\n     white traders no purchase of land from them by individuals\r\n     is permitted, nor is any person allowed to receive lands\r\n     from them as a present without the express sanction of\r\n     government. These precautions are strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow different was their state while yet the undisputed lords of the\r\nsoil! Their wants were few and the means of gratification within their\r\nreach. They saw every one round them sharing the same lot, enduring the\r\nsame hardships, feeding on the same aliments, arrayed in the same rude\r\ngarments. No roof then rose but was open to the homeless stranger; no\r\nsmoke curled among the trees but he was welcome to sit down by its fire\r\nand join the hunter in his repast. “For,” says an old historian of New\r\nEngland, “their life is so void of care, and they are so loving also,\r\nthat they make use of those things they enjoy as common goods, and are\r\ntherein so compassionate that rather than one should starve through\r\nwant, they would starve all; thus they pass their time merrily, not\r\nregarding our pomp, but are better content with their own, which some\r\nmen esteem so meanly of.” Such were the Indians whilst in the pride\r\nand energy of their primitive natures: they resembled those wild plants\r\nwhich thrive best in the shades of the forest, but shrink from the hand\r\nof cultivation and perish beneath the influence of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the savage character writers have been too prone to\r\nindulge in vulgar prejudice and passionate exaggeration, instead of the\r\ncandid temper of true philosophy. They have not sufficiently considered\r\nthe peculiar circumstances in which the Indians have been placed, and\r\nthe peculiar principles under which they have been educated. No being\r\nacts more rigidly from rule than the Indian. His whole conduct is\r\nregulated according to some general maxims early implanted in his mind.\r\nThe moral laws that govern him are, to be sure, but few; but then he\r\nconforms to them all; the white man abounds in laws of religion, morals,\r\nand manners, but how many does he violate!\r\n\r\nA frequent ground of accusation against the Indians is their disregard\r\nof treaties, and the treachery and wantonness with which, in time of\r\napparent peace, they will suddenly fly to hostilities. The intercourse\r\nof the white men with the Indians, however, is too apt to be cold,\r\ndistrustful, oppressive, and insulting. They seldom treat them with that\r\nconfidence and frankness which are indispensable to real friendship, nor\r\nis sufficient caution observed not to offend against those feelings of\r\npride or superstition which often prompt the Indian to hostility\r\nquicker than mere considerations of interest. The solitary savage feels\r\nsilently, but acutely. His sensibilities are not diffused over so wide\r\na surface as those of the white man, but they run in steadier and deeper\r\nchannels. His pride, his affections, his superstitions, are all\r\ndirected towards fewer objects, but the wounds inflicted on them are\r\nproportionably severe, and furnish motives of hostility which we cannot\r\nsufficiently appreciate. Where a community is also limited in number,\r\nand forms one great patriarchal family, as in an Indian tribe, the\r\ninjury of an individual is the injury of the whole, and the sentiment\r\nof vengeance is almost instantaneously diffused. One council-fire is\r\nsufficient for the discussion and arrangement of a plan of hostilities.\r\nHere all the fighting-men and sages assemble. Eloquence and superstition\r\ncombine to inflame the minds of the warriors. The orator awakens\r\ntheir martial ardor, and they are wrought up to a kind of religious\r\ndesperation by the visions of the prophet and the dreamer.\r\n\r\nAn instance of one of those sudden exasperations, arising from a motive\r\npeculiar to the Indian character, is extant in an old record of the\r\nearly settlement of Massachusetts. The planters of Plymouth had defaced\r\nthe monuments of the dead at Passonagessit, and had plundered the grave\r\nof the Sachem’s mother of some skins with which it had been decorated.\r\nThe Indians are remarkable for the reverence which they entertain for\r\nthe sepulchres of their kindred. Tribes that have passed generations\r\nexiled from the abodes of their ancestors, when by chance they have\r\nbeen travelling in the vicinity, have been known to turn aside from the\r\nhighway, and, guided by wonderfully accurate tradition, have crossed the\r\ncountry for miles to some tumulus, buried perhaps in woods, where the\r\nbones of their tribe were anciently deposited, and there have passed\r\nhours in silent meditation. Influenced by this sublime and holy feeling,\r\nthe Sachem whose mother’s tomb had been violated gathered his men\r\ntogether, and addressed them in the following beautifully simple\r\nand pathetic harangue--a curious specimen of Indian eloquence and an\r\naffecting instance of filial piety in a savage:\r\n\r\n“When last the glorious light of all the sky was underneath this globe\r\nand birds grew silent, I began to settle, as my custom is, to take\r\nrepose. Before mine eyes were fast closed methought I saw a vision, at\r\nwhich my spirit was much troubled; and trembling at that doleful sight,\r\na spirit cried aloud, ‘Behold, my son, whom I have cherished, see the\r\nbreasts that gave thee suck, the hands that lapped thee warm and fed\r\nthee oft. Canst thou forget to take revenge of those wild people\r\nwho have defaced my monument in a despiteful manner, disdaining our\r\nantiquities and honorable customs? See, now, the Sachem’s grave lies\r\nlike the common people, defaced by an ignoble race. Thy mother doth\r\ncomplain and implores thy aid against this thievish people who have\r\nnewly intruded on our land. If this be suffered, I shall not rest quiet\r\nin my everlasting habitation.’ This said, the spirit vanished, and I,\r\nall in a sweat, not able scarce to speak, began to get some strength\r\nand recollect my spirits that were fled, and determined to demand your\r\ncounsel and assistance.”\r\n\r\nI have adduced this anecdote at some length, as it tends to show how\r\nthese sudden acts of hostility, which have been attributed to caprice\r\nand perfidy, may often arise from deep and generous motives, which\r\nour inattention to Indian character and customs prevents our properly\r\nappreciating.\r\n\r\nAnother ground of violent outcry against the Indians is their barbarity\r\nto the vanquished. This had its origin partly in policy and partly in\r\nsuperstition. The tribes, though sometimes called nations, were never\r\nso formidable in their numbers but that the loss of several warriors\r\nwas sensibly felt; this was particularly the case when they had been\r\nfrequently engaged in warfare; and many an instance occurs in Indian\r\nhistory where a tribe that had long been formidable to its neighbors\r\nhas been broken up and driven away by the capture and massacre of its\r\nprincipal fighting-men. There was a strong temptation, therefore, to the\r\nvictor to be merciless, not so much to gratify any cruel revenge, as\r\nto provide for future security. The Indians had also the superstitious\r\nbelief, frequent among barbarous nations and prevalent also among the\r\nancients, that the manes of their friends who had fallen in battle were\r\nsoothed by the blood of the captives. The prisoners, however, who are\r\nnot thus sacrificed are adopted into their families in the place of the\r\nslain, and are treated with the confidence and affection of relatives\r\nand friends; nay, so hospitable and tender is their entertainment that\r\nwhen the alternative is offered them they will often prefer to remain\r\nwith their adopted brethren rather than return to the home and the\r\nfriends of their youth.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty of the Indians towards their prisoners has been heightened\r\nsince the colonization of the whites. What was formerly a compliance\r\nwith policy and superstition has been exasperated into a gratification\r\nof vengeance. They cannot but be sensible that the white men are the\r\nusurpers of their ancient dominion, the cause of their degradation, and\r\nthe gradual destroyers of their race. They go forth to battle smarting\r\nwith injuries and indignities which they have individually suffered, and\r\nthey are driven to madness and despair by the wide-spreading desolation\r\nand the overwhelming ruin of European warfare. The whites have too\r\nfrequently set them an example of violence by burning their villages\r\nand laying waste their slender means of subsistence, and yet they wonder\r\nthat savages do not show moderation and magnanimity towards those who\r\nhave left them nothing but mere existence and wretchedness.\r\n\r\nWe stigmatize the Indians, also, as cowardly and treacherous, because\r\nthey use stratagem in warfare in preference to open force; but in this\r\nthey are fully justified by their rude code of honor. They are early\r\ntaught that stratagem is praiseworthy; the bravest warrior thinks it\r\nno disgrace to lurk in silence, and take every advantage of his foe: he\r\ntriumphs in the superior craft and sagacity by which he has been enabled\r\nto surprise and destroy an enemy. Indeed, man is naturally more prone to\r\nsubtilty than open valor, owing to his physical weakness in comparison\r\nwith other animals. They are endowed with natural weapons of defence,\r\nwith horns, with tusks, with hoofs, and talons; but man has to depend\r\non his superior sagacity. In all his encounters with these, his proper\r\nenemies, he resorts to stratagem; and when he perversely turns his\r\nhostility against his fellow-man, he at first continues the same subtle\r\nmode of warfare.\r\n\r\nThe natural principle of war is to do the most harm to our enemy with\r\nthe least harm to ourselves; and this of course is to be effected by\r\nstratagem. That chivalrous courage which induces us to despise the\r\nsuggestions of prudence and to rush in the face of certain danger is the\r\noffspring of society and produced by education. It is honorable,\r\nbecause it is in fact the triumph of lofty sentiment over an instinctive\r\nrepugnance to pain, and over those yearnings after personal ease and\r\nsecurity which society has condemned as ignoble. It is kept alive by\r\npride and the fear of shame; and thus the dread of real evil is overcome\r\nby the superior dread of an evil which exists but in the imagination. It\r\nhas been cherished and stimulated also by various means. It has been\r\nthe theme of spirit-stirring song and chivalrous story. The poet and\r\nminstrel have delighted to shed round it the splendors of fiction, and\r\neven the historian has forgotten the sober gravity of narration and\r\nbroken forth into enthusiasm and rhapsody in its praise. Triumphs and\r\ngorgeous pageants have been its reward: monuments, on which art has\r\nexhausted its skill and opulence its treasures, have been erected\r\nto perpetuate a nation’s gratitude and admiration. Thus artificially\r\nexcited, courage has risen to an extraordinary and factitious degree\r\nof heroism, and, arrayed in all the glorious “pomp and circumstance of\r\nwar,” this turbulent quality has even been able to eclipse many of those\r\nquiet but invaluable virtues which silently ennoble the human character\r\nand swell the tide of human happiness.\r\n\r\nBut if courage intrinsically consists in the defiance of danger and\r\npain, the life of the Indian is a continual exhibition of it. He lives\r\nin a state of perpetual hostility and risk. Peril and adventure\r\nare congenial to his nature, or rather seem necessary to arouse his\r\nfaculties and to give an interest to his existence. Surrounded by\r\nhostile tribes, whose mode of warfare is by ambush and surprisal, he is\r\nalways prepared for fight and lives with his weapons in his hands. As\r\nthe ship careers in fearful singleness through the solitudes of ocean,\r\nas the bird mingles among clouds and storms, and wings its way, a\r\nmere speck, across the pathless fields of air, so the Indian holds his\r\ncourse, silent, solitary, but undaunted, through the boundless bosom of\r\nthe wilderness. His expeditions may vie in distance and danger with\r\nthe pilgrimage of the devotee or the crusade of the knight-errant. He\r\ntraverses vast forests exposed to the hazards of lonely sickness, of\r\nlurking enemies, and pining famine. Stormy lakes, those great inland\r\nseas, are no obstacles to his wanderings: in his light canoe of bark he\r\nsports like a feather on their waves, and darts with the swiftness of\r\nan arrow down the roaring rapids of the rivers. His very subsistence\r\nis snatched from the midst of toil and peril. He gains his food by the\r\nhardships and dangers of the chase: he wraps himself in the spoils of\r\nthe bear, the panther, and the buffalo, and sleeps among the thunders of\r\nthe cataract.\r\n\r\nNo hero of ancient or modern days can surpass the Indian in his lofty\r\ncontempt of death and the fortitude with which he sustains his cruelest\r\naffliction. Indeed, we here behold him rising superior to the white man\r\nin consequence of his peculiar education. The latter rushes to glorious\r\ndeath at the cannon’s mouth; the former calmly contemplates its\r\napproach, and triumphantly endures it amidst the varied torments of\r\nsurrounding foes and the protracted agonies of fire. He even takes\r\na pride in taunting his persecutors and provoking their ingenuity of\r\ntorture; and as the devouring flames prey on his very vitals and the\r\nflesh shrinks from the sinews, he raises his last song of triumph,\r\nbreathing the defiance of an unconquered heart and invoking the spirits\r\nof his fathers to witness that he dies without a groan.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the obloquy with which the early historians have\r\novershadowed the characters of the unfortunate natives, some bright\r\ngleams occasionally break through which throw a degree of melancholy\r\nlustre on their memories. Facts are occasionally to be met with in the\r\nrude annals of the eastern provinces which, though recorded with the\r\ncoloring of prejudice and bigotry, yet speak for themselves, and will\r\nbe dwelt on with applause and sympathy when prejudice shall have passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIn one of the homely narratives of the Indian wars in New England there\r\nis a touching account of the desolation carried into the tribe of\r\nthe Pequod Indians. Humanity shrinks from the cold-blooded detail of\r\nindiscriminate butchery. In one place we read of the surprisal of an\r\nIndian fort in the night, when the wigwams were wrapped in flames and\r\nthe miserable inhabitants shot down and slain in attempting to escape,\r\n“all being despatched and ended in the course of an hour.” After a\r\nseries of similar transactions “our soldiers,” as the historian\r\npiously observes, “being resolved by God’s assistance to make a final\r\ndestruction of them,” the unhappy savages being hunted from their homes\r\nand fortresses and pursued with fire and sword, a scanty but gallant\r\nband, the sad remnant of the Pequod warriors, with their wives and\r\nchildren took refuge in a swamp.\r\n\r\nBurning with indignation and rendered sullen by despair, with hearts\r\nbursting with grief at the destruction of their tribe, and spirits\r\ngalled and sore at the fancied ignominy of their defeat, they refused to\r\nask their lives at the hands of an insulting foe, and preferred death to\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nAs the night drew on they were surrounded in their dismal retreat, so as\r\nto render escape impracticable. Thus situated, their enemy “plied them\r\nwith shot all the time, by which means many were killed and buried in\r\nthe mire.” In the darkness and fog that preceded the dawn of day some\r\nfew broke through the besiegers and escaped into the woods; “the rest\r\nwere left to the conquerors, of which many were killed in the swamp,\r\nlike sullen dogs who would rather, in their self-willedness and madness,\r\nsit still and be shot through or cut to pieces” than implore for mercy.\r\nWhen the day broke upon this handful of forlorn but dauntless spirits,\r\nthe soldiers, we are told, entering the swamp, “saw several heaps of\r\nthem sitting close together, upon whom they discharged their pieces,\r\nladen with ten or twelve pistol bullets at a time, putting the muzzles\r\nof the pieces under the boughs, within a few yards of them; so as,\r\nbesides those that were found dead, many more were killed and sunk into\r\nthe mire, and never were minded more by friend or foe.”\r\n\r\nCan any one read this plain unvarnished tale without admiring the stern\r\nresolution, the unbending pride, the loftiness of spirit that seemed to\r\nnerve the hearts of these self-taught heroes and to raise them above the\r\ninstinctive feelings of human nature? When the Gauls laid waste the city\r\nof Rome, they found the senators clothed in their robes and seated with\r\nstern tranquillity in their curule chairs; in this manner they suffered\r\ndeath without resistance or even supplication. Such conduct was in them\r\napplauded as noble and magnanimous; in the hapless Indian it was\r\nreviled as obstinate and sullen. How truly are we the dupes of show and\r\ncircumstance! How different is virtue clothed in purple and enthroned\r\nin state, from virtue naked and destitute and perishing obscurely in a\r\nwilderness!\r\n\r\nBut I forbear to dwell on these gloomy pictures. The eastern tribes have\r\nlong since disappeared; the forests that sheltered them have been laid\r\nlow, and scarce any traces remain of them in the thickly-settled States\r\nof New England, excepting here and there the Indian name of a village\r\nor a stream. And such must, sooner or later, be the fate of those other\r\ntribes which skirt the frontiers, and have occasionally been inveigled\r\nfrom their forests to mingle in the wars of white men. In a little\r\nwhile, and they will go the way that their brethren have gone before.\r\nThe few hordes which still linger about the shores of Huron and Superior\r\nand the tributary streams of the Mississippi will share the fate of\r\nthose tribes that once spread over Massachusetts and Connecticut and\r\nlorded it along the proud banks of the Hudson, of that gigantic race\r\nsaid to have existed on the borders of the Susquehanna, and of those\r\nvarious nations that flourished about the Potomac and the Rappahannock\r\nand that peopled the forests of the vast valley of Shenandoah. They will\r\nvanish like a vapor from the face of the earth; their very history will\r\nbe lost in forgetfulness; and “the places that now know them will know\r\nthem no more forever.” Or if, perchance, some dubious memorial of them\r\nshould survive, it may be in the romantic dreams of the poet, to people\r\nin imagination his glades and groves, like the fauns and satyrs and\r\nsylvan deities of antiquity. But should he venture upon the dark story\r\nof their wrongs and wretchedness, should he tell how they were invaded,\r\ncorrupted, despoiled, driven from their native abodes and the sepulchres\r\nof their fathers, hunted like wild beasts about the earth, and sent down\r\nwith violence and butchery to the grave, posterity will either turn with\r\nhorror and incredulity from the tale or blush with indignation at the\r\ninhumanity of their forefathers. “We are driven back,” said an old\r\nwarrior, “until we can retreat no farther--our hatchets are broken, our\r\nbows are snapped, our fires are nearly extinguished; a little longer and\r\nthe white man will cease to persecute us, for we shall cease to exist!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP OF POKANOKET.\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN MEMOIR.\r\n\r\n    As monumental bronze unchanged his look:\r\n    A soul that pity touch’d, but never shook;\r\n    Train’d from his tree-rock’d cradle to his bier,\r\n    The fierce extremes of good and ill to brook\r\n    Impassive--fearing but the shame of fear--\r\n        stoic of the woods--a man without a tear.\r\n                                            CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nIT is to be regretted that those early writers who treated of the\r\ndiscovery and settlement of America have not given us more particular\r\nand candid accounts of the remarkable characters that flourished in\r\nsavage life. The scanty anecdotes which have reached us are full of\r\npeculiarity and interest; they furnish us with nearer glimpses of human\r\nnature, and show what man is in a comparatively primitive state and what\r\nhe owes to civilization. There is something of the charm of discovery\r\nin lighting upon these wild and unexplored tracts of human nature--in\r\nwitnessing, as it were, the native growth of moral sentiment, and\r\nperceiving those generous and romantic qualities which have been\r\nartificially cultivated by society vegetating in spontaneous hardihood\r\nand rude magnificence.\r\n\r\nIn civilized life, where the happiness, and indeed almost the existence,\r\nof man depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow-men, he is\r\nconstantly acting a studied part. The bold and peculiar traits of native\r\ncharacter are refined away or softened down by the levelling influence\r\nof what is termed good-breeding, and he practises so many petty\r\ndeceptions and affects so many generous sentiments for the purposes\r\nof popularity that it is difficult to distinguish his real from his\r\nartificial character. The Indian, on the contrary, free from the\r\nrestraints and refinements of polished life, and in a great degree a\r\nsolitary and independent being, obeys the impulses of his inclination\r\nor the dictates of his judgment; and thus the attributes of his nature,\r\nbeing freely indulged, grow singly great and striking. Society is like\r\na lawn, where every roughness is smoothed, every bramble eradicated, and\r\nwhere the eye is delighted by the smiling verdure of a velvet surface;\r\nhe, however, who would study Nature in its wildness and variety must\r\nplunge into the forest, must explore the glen, must stem the torrent,\r\nand dare the precipice.\r\n\r\nThese reflections arose on casually looking through a volume of early\r\ncolonial history wherein are recorded, with great bitterness, the\r\noutrages of the Indians and their wars with the settlers New England.\r\nIt is painful to perceive, even from these partial narratives, how the\r\nfootsteps of civilization may be traced in the blood of the aborigines;\r\nhow easily the colonists were moved to hostility by the lust of\r\nconquest; how merciless and exterminating was their warfare. The\r\nimagination shrinks at the idea of how many intellectual beings were\r\nhunted from the earth, how many brave and noble hearts, of Nature’s\r\nsterling coinage, were broken down and trampled in the dust.\r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of PHILIP OF POKANOKET, an Indian warrior whose name\r\nwas once a terror throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut. He was the\r\nmost distinguished of a number of contemporary sachems who reigned over\r\nthe Pequods, the Narragansetts, the Wampanoags, and the other eastern\r\ntribes at the time of the first settlement of New England--a band of\r\nnative untaught heroes who made the most generous struggle of which\r\nhuman nature is capable, fighting to the last gasp in the cause of their\r\ncountry, without a hope of victory or a thought of renown. Worthy of\r\nan age of poetry and fit subjects for local story and romantic fiction,\r\nthey have left scarcely any authentic traces on the page of history, but\r\nstalk like gigantic shadows in the dim twilight of tradition.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * While correcting the proof-sheets of this article the\r\n     author is informed that a celebrated English poet has nearly\r\n     finished an heroic poem on the story of Philip of Pokanoket.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Pilgrims, as the Plymouth settlers are called by their\r\ndescendants, first took refuge on the shores of the New World from\r\nthe religious persecutions of the Old, their situation was to the last\r\ndegree gloomy and disheartening. Few in number, and that number rapidly\r\nperishing away through sickness and hardships, surrounded by a howling\r\nwilderness and savage tribes, exposed to the rigors of an almost arctic\r\nwinter and the vicissitudes of an ever-shifting climate, their minds\r\nwere filled with doleful forebodings, and nothing preserved them\r\nfrom sinking into despondency but the strong excitement of religious\r\nenthusiasm. In this forlorn situation they were visited by Massasoit,\r\nchief sagamore of the Wampanoags, a powerful chief who reigned over\r\na great extent of country. Instead of taking advantage of the scanty\r\nnumber of the strangers and expelling them from his territories, into\r\nwhich they had intruded, he seemed at once to conceive for them a\r\ngenerous friendship, and extended towards them the rites of primitive\r\nhospitality. He came early in the spring to their settlement of New\r\nPlymouth, attended by a mere handful of followers, entered into a solemn\r\nleague of peace and amity, sold them a portion of the soil, and promised\r\nto secure for them the good-will of his savage allies. Whatever may be\r\nsaid of Indian perfidy, it is certain that the integrity and good\r\nfaith of Massasoit have never been impeached. He continued a firm and\r\nmagnanimous friend of the white men, suffering them to extend their\r\npossessions and to strengthen themselves in the land, and betraying no\r\njealousy of their increasing power and prosperity. Shortly before his\r\ndeath he came once more to New Plymouth with his son Alexander, for\r\nthe purpose of renewing the covenant of peace and of securing it to his\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nAt this conference he endeavored to protect the religion of his\r\nforefathers from the encroaching zeal of the missionaries, and\r\nstipulated that no further attempt should be made to draw off his people\r\nfrom their ancient faith; but, finding the English obstinately opposed\r\nto any such condition, he mildly relinquished the demand. Almost the\r\nlast act of his life was to bring his two sons, Alexander and Philip\r\n(as they had been named by the English), to the residence of a principal\r\nsettler, recommending mutual kindness and confidence, and entreating\r\nthat the same love and amity which had existed between the white men and\r\nhimself might be continued afterwards with his children. The good old\r\nsachem died in peace, and was happily gathered to his fathers before\r\nsorrow came upon his tribe; his children remained behind to experience\r\nthe ingratitude of white men.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, Alexander, succeeded him. He was of a quick and\r\nimpetuous temper, and proudly tenacious of his hereditary rights and\r\ndignity. The intrusive policy and dictatorial conduct of the\r\nstrangers excited his indignation, and he beheld with uneasiness their\r\nexterminating wars with the neighboring tribes. He was doomed soon to\r\nincur their hostility, being accused of plotting with the Narragansetts\r\nto rise against the English and drive them from the land. It is\r\nimpossible to say whether this accusation was warranted by facts or was\r\ngrounded on mere suspicions. It is evident, however, by the violent and\r\noverbearing measures of the settlers that they had by this time begun to\r\nfeel conscious of the rapid increase of their power, and to grow harsh\r\nand inconsiderate in their treatment of the natives. They despatched\r\nan armed force to seize upon Alexander and to bring him before their\r\ncourts. He was traced to his woodland haunts, and surprised at a\r\nhunting-house where he was reposing with a band of his followers,\r\nunarmed, after the toils of the chase. The suddenness of his arrest\r\nand the outrage offered to his sovereign dignity so preyed upon the\r\nirascible feelings of this proud savage as to throw him into a raging\r\nfever. He was permitted to return home on condition of sending his son\r\nas a pledge for his re-appearance; but the blow he had received was\r\nfatal, and before he reached his home he fell a victim to the agonies of\r\na wounded spirit.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Alexander was Metamocet, or King Philip, as he was\r\ncalled by the settlers on account of his lofty spirit and ambitious\r\ntemper. These, together with his well-known energy and enterprise, had\r\nrendered him an object of great jealousy and apprehension, and he was\r\naccused of having always cherished a secret and implacable hostility\r\ntowards the whites. Such may very probably and very naturally have been\r\nthe case. He considered them as originally but mere intruders into\r\nthe country, who had presumed upon indulgence and were extending\r\nan influence baneful to savage life. He saw the whole race of his\r\ncountrymen melting before them from the face of the earth, their\r\nterritories slipping from their hands, and their tribes becoming feeble,\r\nscattered, and dependent. It may be said that the soil was originally\r\npurchased by the settlers; but who does not know the nature of Indian\r\npurchases in the early periods of colonization? The Europeans always\r\nmade thrifty bargains through their superior adroitness in traffic, and\r\nthey gained vast accessions of territory by easily-provoked hostilities.\r\nAn uncultivated savage is never a nice inquirer into the refinements of\r\nlaw by which an injury may be gradually and legally inflicted. Leading\r\nfacts are all by which he judges; and it was enough for Philip to know\r\nthat before the intrusion of the Europeans his countrymen were lords of\r\nthe soil, and that now they were becoming vagabonds in the land of their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been his feelings of general hostility and his\r\nparticular indignation at the treatment of his brother, he suppressed\r\nthem for the present, renewed the contract with the settlers, and\r\nresided peaceably for many years at Pokanoket, or as, it was called by\r\nthe English, Mount Hope,* the ancient seat of dominion of his tribe.\r\nSuspicions, however, which were at first but vague and indefinite,\r\nbegan to acquire form and substance, and he was at length charged with\r\nattempting to instigate the various eastern tribes to rise at once, and\r\nby a simultaneous effort to throw off the yoke of their oppressors. It\r\nis difficult at this distant period to assign the proper credit due to\r\nthese early accusations against the Indians. There was a proneness to\r\nsuspicion and an aptness to acts of violence on the part of the whites\r\nthat gave weight and importance to every idle tale. Informers abounded\r\nwhere tale-bearing met with countenance and reward, and the sword\r\nwas readily unsheathed when its success was certain and it carved out\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Now Bristol, Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only positive evidence on record against Philip is the accusation\r\nof one Sausaman, a renegado Indian, whose natural cunning had been\r\nquickened by a partial education which he had received among the\r\nsettlers. He changed his faith and his allegiance two or three times\r\nwith a facility that evinced the looseness of his principles. He had\r\nacted for some time as Philip’s confidential secretary and counsellor,\r\nand had enjoyed his bounty and protection. Finding, however, that the\r\nclouds of adversity were gathering round his patron, he abandoned his\r\nservice and went over to the whites, and in order to gain their favor\r\ncharged his former benefactor with plotting against their safety. A\r\nrigorous investigation took place. Philip and several of his subjects\r\nsubmitted to be examined, but nothing was proved against them. The\r\nsettlers, however, had now gone too far to retract; they had previously\r\ndetermined that Philip was a dangerous neighbor; they had publicly\r\nevinced their distrust, and had done enough to insure his hostility;\r\naccording, therefore, to the usual mode of reasoning in these cases,\r\nhis destruction had become necessary to their security. Sausaman, the\r\ntreacherous informer, was shortly afterwards found dead in a pond,\r\nhaving fallen a victim to the vengeance of his tribe. Three Indians,\r\none of whom was a friend and counsellor of Philip, were apprehended\r\nand tried, and on the testimony of one very questionable witness were\r\ncondemned and executed as murderers.\r\n\r\nThis treatment of his subjects and ignominious punishment of his friend\r\noutraged the pride and exasperated the passions of Philip. The bolt\r\nwhich had fallen thus at his very feet awakened him to the gathering\r\nstorm, and he determined to trust himself no longer in the power of the\r\nwhite men. The fate of his insulted and broken-hearted brother still\r\nrankled in his mind; and he had a further warning in the tragical story\r\nof Miantonimo, a great Sachem of the Narragansetts, who, after manfully\r\nfacing his accusers before a tribunal of the colonists, exculpating\r\nhimself from a charge of conspiracy and receiving assurances of amity,\r\nhad been perfidiously despatched at their instigation. Philip therefore\r\ngathered his fighting-men about him, persuaded all strangers that\r\nhe could to join his cause, sent the women and children to the\r\nNarragansetts for safety, and wherever he appeared was continually\r\nsurrounded by armed warriors.\r\n\r\nWhen the two parties were thus in a state of distrust and irritation,\r\nthe least spark was sufficient to set them in a flame. The Indians,\r\nhaving weapons in their hands, grew mischievous and committed various\r\npetty depredations. In one of their maraudings a warrior was fired on\r\nand killed by a settler. This was the signal for open hostilities; the\r\nIndians pressed to revenge the death of their comrade, and the alarm of\r\nwar resounded through the Plymouth colony.\r\n\r\nIn the early chronicles of these dark and melancholy times we meet with\r\nmany indications of the diseased state of the public mind. The gloom\r\nof religious abstraction and the wildness of their situation among\r\ntrackless forests and savage tribes had disposed the colonists to\r\nsuperstitious fancies, and had filled their imaginations with the\r\nfrightful chimeras of witchcraft and spectrology. They were much given\r\nalso to a belief in omens. The troubles with Philip and his Indians\r\nwere preceded, we are told, by a variety of those awful warnings which\r\nforerun great and public calamities. The perfect form of an Indian\r\nbow appeared in the air at New Plymouth, which was looked upon by the\r\ninhabitants as a “prodigious apparition.” At Hadley, Northampton, and\r\nother towns in their neighborhood “was heard the report of a great piece\r\nof ordnance, with a shaking of the earth and a considerable echo.” *\r\nOthers were alarmed on a still sunshiny morning by the discharge of guns\r\nand muskets; bullets seemed to whistle past them, and the noise of\r\ndrums resounded in the air, seeming to pass away to the westward; others\r\nfancied that they heard the galloping of horses over their heads; and\r\ncertain monstrous births which took place about the time filled the\r\nsuperstitious in some towns with doleful forebodings. Many of these\r\nportentous sights and sounds may be ascribed to natural phenomena--to\r\nthe northern lights which occur vividly in those latitudes, the meteors\r\nwhich explode in the air, the casual rushing of a blast through the top\r\nbranches of the forest, the crash of fallen trees or disrupted rocks,\r\nand to those other uncouth sounds and echoes which will sometimes\r\nstrike the ear so strangely amidst the profound stillness of woodland\r\nsolitudes. These may have startled some melancholy imaginations, may\r\nhave been exaggerated by the love for the marvellous, and listened\r\nto with that avidity with which we devour whatever is fearful and\r\nmysterious. The universal currency of these superstitious fancies and\r\nthe grave record made of them by one of the learned men of the day are\r\nstrongly characteristic of the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The Rev. Increase Mather’s History.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the contest that ensued was such as too often\r\ndistinguishes the warfare between civilized men and savages. On the part\r\nof the whites it was conducted with superior skill and success, but with\r\na wastefulness of the blood and a disregard of the natural rights of\r\ntheir antagonists: on the part of the Indians it was waged with the\r\ndesperation of men fearless of death, and who had nothing to expect from\r\npeace but humiliation, dependence, and decay.\r\n\r\nThe events of the war are transmitted to us by a worthy clergyman of the\r\ntime, who dwells with horror and indignation on every hostile act of the\r\nIndians, however justifiable, whilst he mentions with applause the most\r\nsanguinary atrocities of the whites. Philip is reviled as a murderer and\r\na traitor, without considering that he was a true-born prince gallantly\r\nfighting at the head of his subjects to avenge the wrongs of his family,\r\nto retrieve the tottering power of his line, and to deliver his native\r\nland from the oppression of usurping strangers.\r\n\r\nThe project of a wide and simultaneous revolt, if such had really been\r\nformed, was worthy of a capacious mind, and had it not been prematurely\r\ndiscovered might have been overwhelming in its consequences. The war\r\nthat actually broke out was but a war of detail, a mere succession of\r\ncasual exploits and unconnected enterprises. Still, it sets forth the\r\nmilitary genius and daring prowess of Philip, and wherever, in the\r\nprejudiced and passionate narrations that have been given of it, we\r\ncan arrive at simple facts, we find him displaying a vigorous mind, a\r\nfertility of expedients, a contempt of suffering and hardship, and an\r\nunconquerable resolution that command our sympathy and applause.\r\n\r\nDriven from his paternal domains at Mount Hope, he threw himself\r\ninto the depths of those vast and trackless forests that skirted the\r\nsettlements and were almost impervious to anything but a wild beast\r\nor an Indian. Here he gathered together his forces, like the storm\r\naccumulating its stores of mischief in the bosom of the thundercloud,\r\nand would suddenly emerge at a time and place least expected, carrying\r\nhavoc and dismay into the villages. There were now and then indications\r\nof these impending ravages that filled the minds of the colonists with\r\nawe and apprehension. The report of a distant gun would perhaps be heard\r\nfrom the solitary woodland, where there was known to be no white man;\r\nthe cattle which had been wandering in the woods would sometimes return\r\nhome wounded; or an Indian or two would be seen lurking about the\r\nskirts of the forests and suddenly disappearing, as the lightning will\r\nsometimes be seen playing silently about the edge of the cloud that is\r\nbrewing up the tempest.\r\n\r\nThough sometimes pursued and even surrounded by the settlers, yet Philip\r\nas often escaped almost miraculously from their toils, and, plunging\r\ninto the wilderness, would be lost to all search or inquiry until he\r\nagain emerged at some far distant quarter, laying the country desolate.\r\nAmong his strongholds were the great swamps or morasses which extend\r\nin some parts of New England, composed of loose bogs of deep black\r\nmud, perplexed with thickets, brambles, rank weeds, the shattered and\r\nmouldering trunks of fallen trees, overshadowed by lugubrious hemlocks.\r\nThe uncertain footing and the tangled mazes of these shaggy wilds\r\nrendered them almost impracticable to the white man, though the Indian\r\ncould thread their labyrinths with the agility of a deer. Into one of\r\nthese, the great swamp of Pocasset Neck, was Philip once driven with a\r\nband of his followers. The English did not dare to pursue him, fearing\r\nto venture into these dark and frightful recesses, where they might\r\nperish in fens and miry pits or be shot down by lurking foes. They\r\ntherefore invested the entrance to the Neck, and began to build a fort\r\nwith the thought of starving out the foe; but Philip and his warriors\r\nwafted themselves on a raft over an arm of the sea in the dead of night,\r\nleaving the women and children behind, and escaped away to the westward,\r\nkindling the flames of war among the tribes of Massachusetts and the\r\nNipmuck country and threatening the colony of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIn this way Philip became a theme of universal apprehension. The mystery\r\nin which he was enveloped exaggerated his real terrors. He was an evil\r\nthat walked in darkness, whose coming none could foresee and against\r\nwhich none knew when to be on the alert. The whole country abounded with\r\nrumors and alarms. Philip seemed almost possessed of ubiquity, for in\r\nwhatever part of the widely-extended frontier an irruption from the\r\nforest took place, Philip was said to be its leader. Many superstitious\r\nnotions also were circulated concerning him. He was said to deal in\r\nnecromancy, and to be attended by an old Indian witch or prophetess,\r\nwhom he consulted and who assisted him by her charms and incantations.\r\nThis, indeed, was frequently the case with Indian chiefs, either through\r\ntheir own credulity or to act upon that of their followers; and the\r\ninfluence of the prophet and the dreamer over Indian superstition has\r\nbeen fully evidenced in recent instances of savage warfare.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Philip effected his escape from Pocasset his fortunes\r\nwere in a desperate condition. His forces had been thinned by repeated\r\nfights and he had lost almost the whole of his resources. In this time\r\nof adversity he found a faithful friend in Canonchet, chief Sachem of\r\nall the Narragansetts. He was the son and heir of Miantonimo, the great\r\nsachem who, as already mentioned, after an honorable acquittal of the\r\ncharge of conspiracy, had been privately put to death at the perfidious\r\ninstigations of the settlers. “He was the heir,” says the old\r\nchronicler, “of all his father’s pride and insolence, as well as of his\r\nmalice towards the English;” he certainly was the heir of his insults\r\nand injuries and the legitimate avenger of his murder. Though he had\r\nforborne to take an active part in this hopeless war, yet he received\r\nPhilip and his broken forces with open arms and gave them the most\r\ngenerous countenance and support. This at once drew upon him the\r\nhostility of the English, and it was determined to strike a signal blow\r\nthat should involve both the Sachems in one common ruin. A great force\r\nwas therefore gathered together from Massachusetts, Plymouth, and\r\nConnecticut, and was sent into the Narragansett country in the depth of\r\nwinter, when the swamps, being frozen and leafless, could be traversed\r\nwith comparative facility and would no longer afford dark and\r\nimpenetrable fastnesses to the Indians.\r\n\r\nApprehensive of attack, Canonchet had conveyed the greater part of his\r\nstores, together with the old, the infirm, the women and children of his\r\ntribe, to a strong fortress, where he and Philip had likewise drawn\r\nup the flower of their forces. This fortress, deemed by the Indians\r\nimpregnable, was situated upon a rising mound or kind of island of five\r\nor six acres in the midst of a swamp; it was constructed with a degree\r\nof judgment and skill vastly superior to what is usually displayed in\r\nIndian fortification, and indicative of the martial genius of these two\r\nchieftains.\r\n\r\nGuided by a renegado Indian, the English penetrated, through December\r\nsnows, to this stronghold and came upon the garrison by surprise. The\r\nfight was fierce and tumultuous. The assailants were repulsed in their\r\nfirst attack, and several of their bravest officers were shot down in\r\nthe act of storming the fortress, sword in hand. The assault was renewed\r\nwith greater success. A lodgment was effected. The Indians were driven\r\nfrom one post to another. They disputed their ground inch by inch,\r\nfighting with the fury of despair. Most of their veterans were cut to\r\npieces, and after a long and bloody battle, Philip and Canonchet, with\r\na handful of surviving warriors, retreated from the fort and took refuge\r\nin the thickets of the surrounding forest.\r\n\r\nThe victors set fire to the wigwams and the fort; the whole was soon in\r\na blaze; many of the old men, the women, and the children perished in\r\nthe flames. This last outrage overcame even the stoicism of the savage.\r\nThe neighboring woods resounded with the yells of rage and despair\r\nuttered by the fugitive warriors, as they beheld the destruction\r\nof their dwellings and heard the agonizing cries of their wives and\r\noffspring. “The burning of the wigwams,” says a contemporary writer,\r\n“the shrieks and cries of the women and children, and the yelling of\r\nthe warriors, exhibited a most horrible and affecting scene, so that it\r\ngreatly moved some of the soldiers.” The same writer cautiously adds,\r\n“They were in much doubt then, and afterwards seriously inquired,\r\nwhether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with humanity,\r\nand the benevolent principles of the gospel.” *\r\n\r\n\r\n     * MS. of the Rev. W. Ruggles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of the brave and generous Canonchet is worthy of particular\r\nmention: the last scene of his life is one of the noblest instances on\r\nrecord of Indian magnanimity.\r\n\r\nBroken down in his power and resources by this signal defeat, yet\r\nfaithful to his ally and to the hapless cause which he had espoused, he\r\nrejected all overtures of peace offered on condition of betraying Philip\r\nand his followers, and declared that “he would fight it out to the\r\nlast man, rather than become a servant to the English.” His home being\r\ndestroyed, his country harassed and laid waste by the incursions of\r\nthe conquerors, he was obliged to wander away to the banks of the\r\nConnecticut, where he formed a rallying-point to the whole body of\r\nwestern Indians and laid waste several of the English settlements.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring he departed on a hazardous expedition, with only\r\nthirty chosen men, to penetrate to Seaconck, in the vicinity of Mount\r\nHope, and to procure seed corn to plant for the sustenance of his\r\ntroops. This little hand of adventurers had passed safely through the\r\nPequod country, and were in the centre of the Narragansett, resting\r\nat some wigwams near Pautucket River, when an alarm was given of an\r\napproaching enemy. Having but seven men by him at the time, Canonchet\r\ndespatched two of them to the top of a neighboring hill to bring\r\nintelligence of the foe.\r\n\r\nPanic-struck by the appearance of a troop of English and Indians rapidly\r\nadvancing, they fled in breathless terror past their chieftain, without\r\nstopping to inform him of the danger. Canonchet sent another scout,\r\nwho did the same. He then sent two more, one of whom, hurrying back\r\nin confusion and affright, told him that the whole British army was\r\nat hand. Canonchet saw there was no choice but immediate flight. He\r\nattempted to escape round the hill, but was perceived and hotly pursued\r\nby the hostile Indians and a few of the fleetest of the English. Finding\r\nthe swiftest pursuer close upon his heels, he threw off, first his\r\nblanket, then his silver-laced coat and belt of peag, by which his\r\nenemies knew him to be Canonchet, and redoubled the eagerness of\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nAt length, in dashing through the river, his foot slipped upon a stone,\r\nand he fell so deep as to wet his gun. This accident so struck him with\r\ndespair that, as he afterwards confessed, “his heart and his bowels\r\nturned within him, and he became like a rotten stick, void of strength.”\r\n\r\nTo such a degree was he unnerved that, being seized by a Pequod Indian\r\nwithin a short distance of the river, he made no resistance, though\r\na man of great vigor of body and boldness of heart. But on being made\r\nprisoner the whole pride of his spirit arose within him, and from that\r\nmoment we find, in the anecdotes given by his enemies, nothing but\r\nrepeated flashes of elevated and prince-like heroism. Being questioned\r\nby one of the English who first came up with him, and who had not\r\nattained his twenty second year, the proud-hearted warrior, looking\r\nwith lofty contempt upon his youthful countenance, replied, “You are a\r\nchild--you cannot understand matters of war; let your brother or your\r\nchief come: him will I answer.”\r\n\r\nThough repeated offers were made to him of his life on condition of\r\nsubmitting with his nation to the English, yet he rejected them with\r\ndisdain, and refused to send any proposals of the kind to the great body\r\nof his subjects, saying that he knew none of them would comply. Being\r\nreproached with his breach of faith towards the whites, his boast that\r\nhe would not deliver up a Wampanoag nor the paring of a Wampanoag’s\r\nnail, and his threat that he would burn the English alive in their\r\nhouses, he disdained to justify himself, haughtily answering that others\r\nwere as forward for the war as himself, and “he desired to hear no more\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nSo noble and unshaken a spirit, so true a fidelity to his cause and his\r\nfriend, might have touched the feelings of the generous and the brave;\r\nbut Canonchet was an Indian, a being towards whom war had no courtesy,\r\nhumanity no law, religion no compassion: he was condemned to die. The\r\nlast words of his that are recorded are worthy the greatness of his\r\nsoul. When sentence of death was passed upon him, he observed “that he\r\nliked it well, for he should die before his heart was soft or he had\r\nspoken anything unworthy of himself.” His enemies gave him the death of\r\na soldier, for he was shot at Stoningham by three young Sachems of his\r\nown rank.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at the Narraganset fortress and the death of Canonchet were\r\nfatal blows to the fortunes of King Philip. He made an ineffectual\r\nattempt to raise a head of war by stirring up the Mohawks to take arms;\r\nbut, though possessed of the native talents of a statesman, his arts\r\nwere counteracted by the superior arts of his enlightened enemies, and\r\nthe terror of their warlike skill began to subdue the resolution of the\r\nneighboring tribes. The unfortunate chieftain saw himself daily stripped\r\nof power, and his ranks rapidly thinning around him. Some were suborned\r\nby the whites; others fell victims to hunger and fatigue and to the\r\nfrequent attacks by which they were harassed. His stores were all\r\ncaptured; his chosen friends were swept away from before his eyes; his\r\nuncle was shot down by his side; his sister was carried into captivity;\r\nand in one of his narrow escapes he was compelled to leave his beloved\r\nwife and only son to the mercy of the enemy. “His ruin,” says the\r\nhistorian, “being thus gradually carried on, his misery was not\r\nprevented, but augmented thereby; being himself made acquainted with the\r\nsense and experimental feeling of the captivity of his children, loss of\r\nfriends, slaughter of his subjects, bereavement of all family relations,\r\nand being stripped of all outward comforts before his own life should be\r\ntaken away.”\r\n\r\nTo fill up the measure of his misfortunes, his own followers began\r\nto plot against his life, that by sacrificing him they might purchase\r\ndishonorable safety. Through treachery a number of his faithful\r\nadherents, the subjects of Wetamoe, an Indian princess of Pocasset, a\r\nnear kinswoman and confederate of Philip, were betrayed into the hands\r\nof the enemy. Wetamoe was among them at the time, and attempted to make\r\nher escape by crossing a neighboring river: either exhausted by swimming\r\nor starved with cold and hunger, she was found dead and naked near the\r\nwater-side. But persecution ceased not at the grave. Even death, the\r\nrefuge of the wretched, where the wicked commonly cease from troubling,\r\nwas no protection to this outcast female, whose great crime was\r\naffectionate fidelity to her kinsman and her friend. Her corpse was the\r\nobject of unmanly and dastardly vengeance: the head was severed from the\r\nbody and set upon a pole, and was thus exposed at Taunton to the view of\r\nher captive subjects. They immediately recognized the features of their\r\nunfortunate queen, and were so affected at this barbarous spectacle\r\nthat we are told they broke forth into the “most horrid and diabolical\r\nlamentations.”\r\n\r\nHowever Philip had borne up against the complicated miseries and\r\nmisfortunes that surrounded him, the treachery of his followers seemed\r\nto wring his heart and reduce him to despondency. It is said that “he\r\nnever rejoiced afterwards, nor had success in any of his designs.” The\r\nspring of hope was broken--the ardor of enterprise was extinguished; he\r\nlooked around, and all was danger and darkness; there was no eye to\r\npity nor any arm that could bring deliverance. With a scanty band\r\nof followers, who still remained true to his desperate fortunes, the\r\nunhappy Philip wandered back to the vicinity of Mount Hope, the ancient\r\ndwelling of his fathers. Here he lurked about like a spectre among the\r\nscenes of former power and prosperity, now bereft of home, of family,\r\nand of friend. There needs no better picture of his destitute and\r\npiteous situation than that furnished by the homely pen of the\r\nchronicler, who is unwarily enlisting the feelings of the reader in\r\nfavor of the hapless warrior whom he reviles. “Philip,” he says, “like a\r\nsavage wild beast, having been hunted by the English forces through the\r\nwoods above a hundred miles backward and forward, at last was driven to\r\nhis own den upon Mount Hope, where he retired, with a few of his best\r\nfriends, into a swamp, which proved but a prison to keep him fast till\r\nthe messengers of death came by divine permission to execute vengeance\r\nupon him.”\r\n\r\nEven in this last refuge of desperation and despair a sullen grandeur\r\ngathers round his memory. We picture him to ourselves seated among his\r\ncare-worn followers, brooding in silence over his blasted fortunes, and\r\nacquiring a savage sublimity from the wildness and dreariness of his\r\nlurking-place. Defeated, but not dismayed--crushed to the earth, but\r\nnot humiliated--he seemed to grow more haughty beneath disaster, and\r\nto experience a fierce satisfaction in draining the last dregs of\r\nbitterness. Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune, but great\r\nminds rise above it. The very idea of submission awakened the fury\r\nof Philip, and he smote to death one of his followers who proposed an\r\nexpedient of peace. The brother of the victim made his escape, and in\r\nrevenge betrayed the retreat of his chieftain, A body of white men\r\nand Indians were immediately despatched to the swamp where Philip lay\r\ncrouched, glaring with fury and despair. Before he was aware of their\r\napproach they had begun to surround him. In a little while he saw five\r\nof his trustiest followers laid dead at his feet; all resistance was\r\nvain; he rushed forth from his covert, and made a headlong attempt to\r\nescape, but was shot through the heart by a renegado Indian of his own\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nSuch is the scanty story of the brave but unfortunate King Philip,\r\npersecuted while living, slandered and dishonored when dead. If,\r\nhowever, we consider even the prejudiced anecdotes furnished us by his\r\nenemies, we may perceive in them traces of amiable and lofty character\r\nsufficient to awaken sympathy for his fate and respect for his memory.\r\nWe find that amidst all the harassing cares and ferocious passions of\r\nconstant warfare he was alive to the softer feelings of connubial love\r\nand paternal tenderness and to the generous sentiment of friendship.\r\nThe captivity of his “beloved wife and only son” are mentioned with\r\nexultation as causing him poignant misery: the death of any near friend\r\nis triumphantly recorded as a new blow on his sensibilities; but the\r\ntreachery and desertion of many of his followers, in whose affections he\r\nhad confided, is said to have desolated his heart and to have bereaved\r\nhim of all further comfort. He was a patriot attached to his native\r\nsoil--a prince true to his subjects and indignant of their wrongs--a\r\nsoldier daring in battle, firm in adversity, patient of fatigue, of\r\nhunger, of every variety of bodily suffering, and ready to perish in\r\nthe cause he had espoused. Proud of heart and with an untamable love\r\nof natural liberty, he preferred to enjoy it among the beasts of the\r\nforests or in the dismal and famished recesses of swamps and morasses,\r\nrather than bow his haughty spirit to submission and live dependent\r\nand despised in the ease and luxury of the settlements. With heroic\r\nqualities and bold achievements that would have graced a civilized\r\nwarrior, and have rendered him the theme of the poet and the historian,\r\nhe lived a wanderer and a fugitive in his native land, and went down,\r\nlike a lonely bark foundering amid darkness and tempest, without a\r\npitying eye to weep his fall or a friendly hand to record his struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.\r\n\r\n    An old song, made by an aged old pate,\r\n    Of an old worshipful gentleman who had a great estate,\r\n    That kept a brave old house at a bountiful rate,\r\n    And an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate.\r\n\r\n    With an old study fill’d full of learned old books,\r\n    With an old reverend chaplain, you might know him by his\r\nlooks,    With an old buttery-hatch worn quite off the hooks,\r\n    And an old kitchen that maintained half-a-dozen old cooks.\r\n                       Like an old courtier, etc.--Old Song.\r\n\r\nTHERE is no species of humor in which the English more excel than that\r\nwhich consists in caricaturing and giving ludicrous appellations or\r\nnicknames. In this way they have whimsically designated, not merely\r\nindividuals, but nations, and in their fondness for pushing a joke they\r\nhave not spared even themselves. One would think that in personifying\r\nitself a nation would be apt to picture something grand, heroic, and\r\nimposing; but it is characteristic of the peculiar humor of the English,\r\nand of their love for what is blunt, comic, and familiar, that they have\r\nembodied their national oddities in the figure of a sturdy, corpulent\r\nold fellow with a three-cornered hat, red waistcoat, leather breeches,\r\nand stout oaken cudgel. Thus they have taken a singular delight in\r\nexhibiting their most private foibles in a laughable point of view, and\r\nhave been so successful in their delineations that there is scarcely\r\na being in actual existence more absolutely present to the public mind\r\nthan that eccentric personage, John Bull.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the continual contemplation of the character thus drawn of them\r\nhas contributed to fix it upon the nation, and thus to give reality\r\nto what at first may have been painted in a great measure from the\r\nimagination. Men are apt to acquire peculiarities that are continually\r\nascribed to them. The common orders of English seem wonderfully\r\ncaptivated with the beau ideal which they have formed of John Bull, and\r\nendeavor to act up to the broad caricature that is perpetually before\r\ntheir eyes. Unluckily, they sometimes make their boasted Bullism an\r\napology for their prejudice or grossness; and this I have especially\r\nnoticed among those truly homebred and genuine sons of the soil who have\r\nnever migrated beyond the sound of Bow bells. If one of these should\r\nbe a little uncouth in speech and apt to utter impertinent truths, he\r\nconfesses that he is a real John Bull and always speaks his mind. If he\r\nnow and then flies into an unreasonable burst of passion about trifles,\r\nhe observes that John Bull is a choleric old blade, but then his passion\r\nis over in a moment and he bears no malice. If he betrays a coarseness\r\nof taste and an insensibility to foreign refinements, he thanks Heaven\r\nfor his ignorance--he is a plain John Bull and has no relish for\r\nfrippery and knick-knacks. His very proneness to be gulled by strangers\r\nand to pay extravagantly for absurdities is excused under the plea of\r\nmunificence, for John is always more generous than wise.\r\n\r\nThus, under the name of John Bull he will contrive to argue every fault\r\ninto a merit, and will frankly convict himself of being the honestest\r\nfellow in existence.\r\n\r\nHowever little, therefore, the character may have suited in the first\r\ninstance, it has gradually adapted itself to the nation, or rather they\r\nhave adapted themselves to each other; and a stranger who wishes to\r\nstudy English peculiarities may gather much valuable information from\r\nthe innumerable portraits of John Bull as exhibited in the windows\r\nof the caricature-shops. Still, however, he is one of those fertile\r\nhumorists that are continually throwing out new portraits and presenting\r\ndifferent aspects from different points of view; and, often as he has\r\nbeen described, I cannot resist the temptation to give a slight sketch\r\nof him such as he has met my eye.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull, to all appearance, is a plain, downright, matter-of-fact\r\nfellow, with much less of poetry about him than rich prose. There is\r\nlittle of romance in his nature, but a vast deal of strong natural\r\nfeeling. He excels in humor more than in wit; is jolly rather than gay;\r\nmelancholy rather than morose; can easily be moved to a sudden tear or\r\nsurprised into a broad laugh; but he loathes sentiment and has no turn\r\nfor light pleasantry. He is a boon companion, if you allow him in to\r\nhave his humor and to talk about himself; and he will stand by a friend\r\nin a quarrel with life and purse, however soundly he may be cudgelled.\r\n\r\nIn this last respect, to tell the truth, he has a propensity to be\r\nsomewhat too ready. He is a busy-minded personage, who thinks not merely\r\nfor himself and family, but for all the country round, and is most\r\ngenerously disposed to be everybody’s champion. He is continually\r\nvolunteering his services to settle his neighbor’s affairs, and takes\r\nit in great dudgeon if they engage in any matter of consequence without\r\nasking his advice, though he seldom engages in any friendly office of\r\nthe kind without finishing by getting into a squabble with all parties,\r\nand then railing bitterly at their ingratitude. He unluckily took\r\nlessons in his youth in the noble science of defence, and having\r\naccomplished himself in the use of his limbs and his weapons and become\r\na perfect master at boxing and cudgel-play, he has had a troublesome\r\nlife of it ever since. He cannot hear of a quarrel between the most\r\ndistant of his neighbors but he begins incontinently to fumble with the\r\nhead of his cudgel, and consider whether his interest or honor does not\r\nrequire that he should meddle in the broil. Indeed, he has extended his\r\nrelations of pride and policy so completely over the whole country\r\nthat no event can take place without infringing some of his finely-spun\r\nrights and dignities. Couched in his little domain, with these\r\nfilaments stretching forth in every direction, he is like some choleric,\r\nbottle-bellied old spider who has woven his web over a whole chamber,\r\nso that a fly cannot buzz nor a breeze blow without startling his repose\r\nand causing him to sally forth wrathfully from his den.\r\n\r\nThough really a good-hearted, good-tempered old fellow at bottom, yet he\r\nis singularly fond of being in the midst of contention. It is one of\r\nhis peculiarities, however, that he only relishes the beginning of an\r\naffray; he always goes into a fight with alacrity, but comes out of\r\nit grumbling even when victorious; and though no one fights with more\r\nobstinacy to carry a contested point, yet when the battle is over and he\r\ncomes to the reconciliation he is so much taken up with the mere shaking\r\nof hands that he is apt to let his antagonist pocket all that they have\r\nbeen quarrelling about. It is not, therefore, fighting that he ought so\r\nmuch to be on his guard against as making friends. It is difficult to\r\ncudgel him out of a farthing; but put him in a good humor and you may\r\nbargain him out of all the money in his pocket. He is like a stout ship\r\nwhich will weather the roughest storm uninjured, but roll its masts\r\noverboard in the succeeding calm.\r\n\r\nHe is a little fond of playing the magnifico abroad, of pulling out\r\na long purse, flinging his money bravely about at boxing-matches,\r\nhorse-races, cock-fights, and carrying a high head among “gentlemen of\r\nthe fancy:” but immediately after one of these fits of extravagance he\r\nwill be taken with violent qualms of economy; stop short at the most\r\ntrivial expenditure; talk desperately of being ruined and brought upon\r\nthe parish; and in such moods will not pay the smallest tradesman’s\r\nbill without violent altercation. He is, in fact, the most punctual\r\nand discontented paymaster in the world, drawing his coin out of his\r\nbreeches pocket with infinite reluctance, paying to the uttermost\r\nfarthing, but accompanying every guinea with a growl.\r\n\r\nWith all his talk of economy, however, he is a bountiful provider and\r\na hospitable housekeeper. His economy is of a whimsical kind, its chief\r\nobject being to devise how he may afford to be extravagant; for he will\r\nbegrudge himself a beefsteak and pint of port one day that he may roast\r\nan ox whole, broach a hogshead of ale, and treat all his neighbors on\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nHis domestic establishment is enormously expensive, not so much from\r\nany great outward parade as from the great consumption of solid beef\r\nand pudding, the vast number of followers he feeds and clothes, and his\r\nsingular disposition to pay hugely for small services. He is a most\r\nkind and indulgent master, and, provided his servants humor his\r\npeculiarities, flatter his vanity a little now and then, and do\r\nnot peculate grossly on him before his face they may manage him to\r\nperfection. Everything that lives on him seems to thrive and grow fat.\r\nHis house-servants are well paid and pampered and have little to do. His\r\nhorses are sleek and lazy and prance slowly before his state carriage;\r\nand his house-dogs sleep quietly about the door and will hardly bark at\r\na housebreaker.\r\n\r\nHis family mansion is an old castellated manor-house, gray with age, and\r\nof a most venerable though weather-beaten appearance. It has been built\r\nupon no regular plan, but is a vast accumulation of parts erected\r\nin various tastes and ages. The centre bears evident traces of Saxon\r\narchitecture, and is as solid as ponderous stone and old English oak\r\ncan make it. Like all the relics of that style, it is full of obscure\r\npassages, intricate mazes, and dusty chambers, and, though these have\r\nbeen partially lighted up in modern days, yet there are many places\r\nwhere you must still grope in the dark. Additions have been made to the\r\noriginal edifice from time to time, and great alterations have taken\r\nplace; towers and battlements have been erected during wars and tumults:\r\nwings built in time of peace; and out-houses, lodges, and offices run up\r\naccording to the whim or convenience of different generations, until it\r\nhas become one of the most spacious, rambling tenements imaginable. An\r\nentire wing is taken up with the family chapel, a reverend pile that\r\nmust have been exceedingly sumptuous, and, indeed, in spite of having\r\nbeen altered and simplified at various periods, has still a look of\r\nsolemn religious pomp. Its walls within are storied with the monuments\r\nof John’s ancestors, and it is snugly fitted up with soft cushions and\r\nwell-lined chairs, where such of his family as are inclined to church\r\nservices may doze comfortably in the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\nTo keep up this chapel has cost John much money; but he is staunch in\r\nhis religion and piqued in his zeal, from the circumstance that many\r\ndissenting chapels have been erected in his vicinity, and several of his\r\nneighbors, with whom he has had quarrels, are strong papists.\r\n\r\nTo do the duties of the chapel he maintains, at a large expense, a pious\r\nand portly family chaplain. He is a most learned and decorous personage\r\nand a truly well-bred Christian, who always backs the old gentleman in\r\nhis opinions, winks discreetly at his little peccadilloes, rebukes the\r\nchildren when refractory, and is of great use in exhorting the tenants\r\nto read their Bibles, say their prayers, and, above all, to pay their\r\nrents punctually and without grumbling.\r\n\r\nThe family apartments are in a very antiquated taste, somewhat heavy and\r\noften inconvenient, but full of the solemn magnificence of former times,\r\nfitted up with rich though faded tapestry, unwieldy furniture, and\r\nloads of massy, gorgeous old plate. The vast fireplaces, ample kitchens,\r\nextensive cellars, and sumptuous banqueting-halls all speak of the\r\nroaring hospitality of days of yore, of which the modern festivity at\r\nthe manor-house is but a shadow. There are, however, complete suites of\r\nrooms apparently deserted and time-worn, and towers and turrets that\r\nare tottering to decay, so that in high winds there is danger of their\r\ntumbling about the ears of the household.\r\n\r\nJohn has frequently been advised to have the old edifice thoroughly\r\noverhauled, and to have some of the useless parts pulled down, and the\r\nothers strengthened with their materials; but the old gentleman always\r\ngrows testy on this subject. He swears the house is an excellent house;\r\nthat it is tight and weather-proof, and not to be shaken by tempests;\r\nthat it has stood for several hundred years, and therefore is not likely\r\nto tumble down now; that as to its being inconvenient, his family is\r\naccustomed to the inconveniences and would not be comfortable without\r\nthem; that as to its unwieldy size and irregular construction, these\r\nresult from its being the growth of centuries and being improved by the\r\nwisdom of every generation; that an old family, like his, requires\r\na large house to dwell in; new, upstart families may live in modern\r\ncottages and snug boxes; but an old English family should inhabit an\r\nold English manor-house. If you point out any part of the building\r\nas superfluous, he insists that it is material to the strength or\r\ndecoration of the rest and the harmony of the whole, and swears that the\r\nparts are so built into each other that if you pull down one, you run\r\nthe risk of having the whole about your ears.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the matter is, that John has a great disposition to\r\nprotect and patronize. He thinks it indispensable to the dignity of an\r\nancient and honorable family to be bounteous in its appointments and\r\nto be eaten up by dependents; and so, partly from pride and partly\r\nfrom kind-heartedness, he makes it a rule always to give shelter and\r\nmaintenance to his superannuated servants.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is, that, like many other venerable family\r\nestablishments, his manor is incumbered by old retainers whom he cannot\r\nturn off, and an old style which he cannot lay down. His mansion is like\r\na great hospital of invalids, and, with all its magnitude, is not a whit\r\ntoo large for its inhabitants. Not a nook or corner but is of use in\r\nhousing some useless personage. Groups of veteran beef-eaters, gouty\r\npensioners, and retired heroes of the buttery and the larder are seen\r\nlolling about its ways, crawling over its lawns, dozing under its tree,\r\nor sunning themselves upon the benches at its doors. Every office and\r\nout-house is garrisoned by these supernumeraries and their families;\r\nfor they are amazingly prolific, and when they die off are sure to leave\r\nJohn a legacy of hungry mouths to be provided for. A mattock cannot be\r\nstruck against the most mouldering tumble-down tower but out pops, from\r\nsome cranny or loophole, the gray pate of some superannuated hanger-on,\r\nwho has lived at John’s expense all his life, and makes the most\r\ngrievous outcry at their pulling down the roof from over the head of\r\na worn-out servant of the family. This is an appeal that John’s honest\r\nheart never can withstand; so that a man who has faithfully eaten his\r\nbeef and pudding all his life is sure to be rewarded with a pipe and\r\ntankard in his old days.\r\n\r\nA great part of his park also is turned into paddocks, where his\r\nbroken-down chargers are turned loose to graze undisturbed for the\r\nremainder of their existences--a worthy example of grateful recollection\r\nwhich, if some of his neighbors were to imitate, would not be to their\r\ndiscredit. Indeed, it is one of his great pleasures to point out these\r\nold steeds to his visitors, to dwell on their good qualities, extol\r\ntheir past services, and boast, with some little vain-glory, of the\r\nperilous adventures and hardy exploits through which they have carried\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe is given, however, to indulge his veneration for family usages and\r\nfamily encumbrances to a whimsical extent. His manor is infested by\r\ngangs of gypsies; yet he will not suffer them to be driven off, because\r\nthey have infested the place time out of mind and been regular poachers\r\nupon every generation of the family. He will scarcely permit a dry\r\nbranch to be lopped from the great trees that surround the house, lest\r\nit should molest the rooks that have bred there for centuries. Owls have\r\ntaken possession of the dovecote, but they are hereditary owls and must\r\nnot be disturbed. Swallows have nearly choked up every chimney with\r\ntheir nests; martins build in every frieze and cornice; crows flutter\r\nabout the towers and perch on every weather-cock; and old gray-headed\r\nrats may be seen in every quarter of the house, running in and out of\r\ntheir holes undauntedly in broad daylight. In short, John has such a\r\nreverence for everything that has been long in the family that he will\r\nnot hear even of abuses being reformed, because they are good old family\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\nAll these whims and habits have concurred woefully to drain the old\r\ngentleman’s purse; and as he prides himself on punctuality in money\r\nmatters and wishes to maintain his credit in the neighborhood, they have\r\ncaused him great perplexity in meeting his engagements. This, too,\r\nhas been increased by the altercations and heart-burnings which are\r\ncontinually taking place in his family. His children have been brought\r\nup to different callings and are of different ways of thinking; and as\r\nthey have always been allowed to speak their minds freely, they do not\r\nfail to exercise the privilege most clamorously in the present posture\r\nof his affairs. Some stand up for the honor of the race, and are clear\r\nthat the old establishment should be kept up in all its state, whatever\r\nmay be the cost; others, who are more prudent and considerate, entreat\r\nthe old gentleman to retrench his expenses and to put his whole system\r\nof housekeeping on a more moderate footing. He has, indeed, at times,\r\nseemed inclined to listen to their opinions, but their wholesome advice\r\nhas been completely defeated by the obstreperous conduct of one of his\r\nsons. This is a noisy, rattle-pated fellow, of rather low habits, who\r\nneglects his business to frequent ale-houses--is the orator of village\r\nclubs and a complete oracle among the poorest of his father’s\r\ntenants. No sooner does he hear any of his brothers mention reform or\r\nretrenchment than up he jumps, takes the words out of their mouths, and\r\nroars out for an overturn. When his tongue is once going nothing\r\ncan stop it. He rants about the room; hectors the old man about his\r\nspendthrift practices; ridicules his tastes and pursuits; insists that\r\nhe shall turn the old servants out of doors, give the broken-down horses\r\nto the hounds, send the fat chaplain packing, and take a field-preacher\r\nin his place; nay, that the whole family mansion shall be levelled with\r\nthe ground, and a plain one of brick and mortar built in its place. He\r\nrails at every social entertainment and family festivity, and skulks\r\naway growling to the ale-house whenever an equipage drives up to the\r\ndoor. Though constantly complaining of the emptiness of his purse,\r\nyet he scruples not to spend all his pocket-money in these tavern\r\nconvocations, and even runs up scores for the liquor over which he\r\npreaches about his father’s extravagance.\r\n\r\nIt may readily be imagined how little such thwarting agrees with the old\r\ncavalier’s fiery temperament. He has become so irritable from repeated\r\ncrossings that the mere mention of retrenchment or reform is a signal\r\nfor a brawl between him and the tavern oracle. As the latter is too\r\nsturdy and refractory for paternal discipline, having grown out of all\r\nfear of the cudgel, they have frequent scenes of wordy warfare, which at\r\ntimes run so high that John is fain to call in the aid of his son Tom,\r\nan officer who has served abroad, but is at present living at home on\r\nhalf-pay. This last is sure to stand by the old gentleman, right or\r\nwrong, likes nothing so much as a rocketing, roistering life, and is\r\nready at a wink or nod to out sabre and flourish it over the orator’s\r\nhead if he dares to array himself against parental authority.\r\n\r\nThese family dissensions, as usual, have got abroad, and are rare food\r\nfor scandal in John’s neighborhood. People begin to look wise and shake\r\ntheir heads whenever his affairs are mentioned. They all “hope that\r\nmatters are not so bad with him as represented; but when a man’s\r\nown children begin to rail at his extravagance, things must be badly\r\nmanaged. They understand he is mortgaged over head and ears and is\r\ncontinually dabbling with money-lenders. He is certainly an open-handed\r\nold gentleman, but they fear he has lived too fast; indeed, they never\r\nknew any good come of this fondness for hunting, racing revelling, and\r\nprize-fighting. In short, Mr. Bull’s estate is a very fine one and has\r\nbeen in the family a long while, but, for all that, they have known many\r\nfiner estates come to the hammer.”\r\n\r\nWhat is worst of all, is the effect which these pecuniary embarrassments\r\nand domestic feuds have had on the poor man himself. Instead of that\r\njolly round corporation and smug rosy face which he used to present, he\r\nhas of late become as shrivelled and shrunk as a frost-bitten apple.\r\nHis scarlet gold-laced waistcoat, which bellied out so bravely in those\r\nprosperous days when he sailed before the wind, now hangs loosely about\r\nhim like a mainsail in a calm. His leather breeches are all in folds and\r\nwrinkles, and apparently have much ado to hold up the boots that yawn on\r\nboth sides of his once sturdy legs.\r\n\r\nInstead of strutting about as formerly with his three-cornered hat on\r\none side, flourishing his cudgel, and bringing it down every moment with\r\na hearty thump upon the ground, looking every one sturdily in the face,\r\nand trolling out a stave of a catch or a drinking-song, he now goes\r\nabout whistling thoughtfully to himself, with his head drooping down,\r\nhis cudgel tucked under his arm, and his hands thrust to the bottom of\r\nhis breeches pockets, which are evidently empty.\r\n\r\nSuch is the plight of honest John Bull at present, yet for all this the\r\nold fellow’s spirit is as tall and as gallant as ever. If you drop the\r\nleast expression of sympathy or concern, he takes fire in an instant;\r\nswears that he is the richest and stoutest fellow in the country; talks\r\nof laying out large sums to adorn his house or buy another estate; and\r\nwith a valiant swagger and grasping of his cudgel longs exceedingly to\r\nhave another bout at quarter-staff.\r\n\r\nThough there may be something rather whimsical in all this, yet I\r\nconfess I cannot look upon John’s situation without strong feelings\r\nof interest. With all his odd humors and obstinate prejudices he is a\r\nsterling-hearted old blade. He may not be so wonderfully fine a fellow\r\nas he thinks himself, but he is at least twice as good as his neighbors\r\nrepresent him. His virtues are all his own--all plain, homebred, and\r\nunaffected. His very faults smack of the raciness of his good qualities.\r\nHis extravagance savors of his generosity, his quarrelsomeness of his\r\ncourage, his credulity of his open faith, his vanity of his pride, and\r\nhis bluntness of his sincerity. They are all the redundancies of a rich\r\nand liberal character. He is like his own oak, rough without, but sound\r\nand solid within; whose bark abounds with excrescences in proportion to\r\nthe growth and grandeur of the timber; and whose branches make a fearful\r\ngroaning and murmuring in the least storm from their very magnitude and\r\nluxuriance. There is something, too, in the appearance of his old family\r\nmansion that is extremely poetical and picturesque; and as long as it\r\ncan be rendered comfortably habitable I should almost tremble to see it\r\nmeddled with during the present conflict of tastes and opinions. Some of\r\nhis advisers are no doubt good architects that might be of service; but\r\nmany, I fear, are mere levellers, who, when they had once got to work\r\nwith their mattocks on this venerable edifice, would never stop until\r\nthey had brought it to the ground, and perhaps buried themselves among\r\nthe ruins. All that I wish is, that John’s present troubles may teach\r\nhim more prudence in future--that he may cease to distress his mind\r\nabout other people’s affairs; that he may give up the fruitless attempt\r\nto promote the good of his neighbors and the peace and happiness of\r\nthe world, by dint of the cudgel; that he may remain quietly at home;\r\ngradually get his house into repair; cultivate his rich estate according\r\nto his fancy; husband his income--if he thinks proper; bring his unruly\r\nchildren into order--if he can; renew the jovial scenes of ancient\r\nprosperity; and long enjoy on his paternal lands a green, an honorable,\r\nand a merry old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIDE OF THE VILLAGE.\r\n\r\n    May no wolfe howle; no screech owle stir\r\n    A wing about thy sepulchre!\r\n    No boysterous winds or stormes come hither,\r\n        To starve or wither\r\n    Thy soft sweet earth! but, like a spring,\r\n    Love kept it ever flourishing.\r\n                                           HERRICK.\r\n\r\nIN the course of an excursion through one of the remote counties of\r\nEngland, I had struck into one of those cross-roads that lead through\r\nthe more secluded parts of the country, and stopped one afternoon at a\r\nvillage the situation of which was beautifully rural and retired. There\r\nwas an air of primitive simplicity about its inhabitants not to be found\r\nin the villages which lie on the great coach-roads. I determined to\r\npass the night there, and, having taken an early dinner, strolled out to\r\nenjoy the neighboring scenery.\r\n\r\nMy ramble, as is usually the case with travellers, soon led me to the\r\nchurch, which stood at a little distance from the village. Indeed, it\r\nwas an object of some curiosity, its old tower being completely overrun\r\nwith ivy so that only here and there a jutting buttress, an angle of\r\ngray wall, or a fantastically carved ornament peered through the verdant\r\ncovering. It was a lovely evening. The early part of the day had been\r\ndark and showery, but in the afternoon it had cleared up, and, though\r\nsullen clouds still hung overhead, yet there was a broad tract of golden\r\nsky in the west, from which the setting sun gleamed through the dripping\r\nleaves and lit up all Nature into a melancholy smile. It seemed like the\r\nparting hour of a good Christian smiling on the sins and sorrows of the\r\nworld, and giving, in the serenity of his decline, an assurance that he\r\nwill rise again in glory.\r\n\r\nI had seated myself on a half-sunken tombstone, and was musing, as one\r\nis apt to do at this sober-thoughted hour, on past scenes and early\r\nfriends--on those who were distant and those who were dead--and\r\nindulging in that kind of melancholy fancying which has in it something\r\nsweeter even than pleasure. Every now and then the stroke of a bell from\r\nthe neighboring tower fell on my ear; its tones were in unison with the\r\nscene, and, instead of jarring, chimed in with my feelings; and it was\r\nsome time before I recollected that it must be tolling the knell of some\r\nnew tenant of the tomb.\r\n\r\nPresently I saw a funeral train moving across the village green; it\r\nwound slowly along a lane, was lost, and reappeared through the breaks\r\nof the hedges, until it passed the place where I was sitting. The pall\r\nwas supported by young girls dressed in white, and another, about the\r\nage of seventeen, walked before, bearing a chaplet of white flowers--a\r\ntoken that the deceased was a young and unmarried female. The corpse\r\nwas followed by the parents. They were a venerable couple of the better\r\norder of peasantry. The father seemed to repress his feelings, but his\r\nfixed eye, contracted brow, and deeply-furrowed face showed the struggle\r\nthat was passing within. His wife hung on his arm, and wept aloud with\r\nthe convulsive bursts of a mother’s sorrow.\r\n\r\nI followed the funeral into the church. The bier was placed in the\r\ncentre aisle, and the chaplet of white flowers, with a pair of white\r\ngloves, was hung over the seat which the deceased had occupied.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the soul-subduing pathos of the funeral service, for who\r\nis so fortunate as never to have followed some one he has loved to the\r\ntomb? But when performed over the remains of innocence and beauty, thus\r\nlaid low in the bloom of existence, what can be more affecting? At that\r\nsimple but most solemn consignment of the body to the grave-“Earth\r\nto earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust!”--the tears of the youthful\r\ncompanions of the deceased flowed unrestrained. The father still seemed\r\nto struggle with his feelings, and to comfort himself with the assurance\r\nthat the dead are blessed which die in the Lord; but the mother only\r\nthought of her child as a flower of the field cut down and withered\r\nin the midst of its sweetness; she was like Rachel, “mourning over her\r\nchildren, and would not be comforted.”\r\n\r\nOn returning to the inn I learnt the whole story of the deceased. It was\r\na simple one, and such as has often been told. She had been the beauty\r\nand pride of the village. Her father had once been an opulent farmer,\r\nbut was reduced in circumstances. This was an only child, and brought up\r\nentirely at home in the simplicity of rural life. She had been the pupil\r\nof the village pastor, the favorite lamb of his little flock. The good\r\nman watched over her education with paternal care; it was limited and\r\nsuitable to the sphere in which she was to move, for he only sought to\r\nmake her an ornament to her station in life, not to raise her above it.\r\nThe tenderness and indulgence of her parents and the exemption from\r\nall ordinary occupations had fostered a natural grace and delicacy of\r\ncharacter that accorded with the fragile loveliness of her form. She\r\nappeared like some tender plant of the garden blooming accidentally amid\r\nthe hardier natives of the fields.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of her charms was felt and acknowledged by her\r\ncompanions, but without envy, for it was surpassed by the unassuming\r\ngentleness and winning kindness of her manners. It might be truly said\r\nof her:\r\n\r\n    “This is the prettiest low-born lass, that ever\r\n     Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems\r\n     But smacks of something greater than herself;\r\n     Too noble for this place.”\r\n\r\nThe village was one of those sequestered spots which still retain some\r\nvestiges of old English customs. It had its rural festivals and holiday\r\npastimes, and still kept up some faint observance of the once popular\r\nrites of May. These, indeed, had been promoted by its present pastor,\r\nwho was a lover of old customs and one of those simple Christians that\r\nthink their mission fulfilled by promoting joy on earth and good-will\r\namong mankind. Under his auspices the May-pole stood from year to year\r\nin the centre of the village green; on Mayday it was decorated with\r\ngarlands and streamers, and a queen or lady of the May was appointed, as\r\nin former times, to preside at the sports and distribute the prizes and\r\nrewards. The picturesque situation of the village and the fancifulness\r\nof its rustic fetes would often attract the notice of casual visitors.\r\nAmong these, on one May-day, was a young officer whose regiment had been\r\nrecently quartered in the neighborhood. He was charmed with the native\r\ntaste that pervaded this village pageant, but, above all, with the\r\ndawning loveliness of the queen of May. It was the village favorite who\r\nwas crowned with flowers, and blushing and smiling in all the beautiful\r\nconfusion of girlish diffidence and delight. The artlessness of rural\r\nhabits enabled him readily to make her acquaintance; he gradually won\r\nhis way into her intimacy, and paid his court to her in that unthinking\r\nway in which young officers are too apt to trifle with rustic\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in his advances to startle or alarm. He never even\r\ntalked of love, but there are modes of making it more eloquent than\r\nlanguage, and which convey it subtilely and irresistibly to the heart.\r\nThe beam of the eye, the tone of voice, the thousand tendernesses\r\nwhich emanate from every word and look and action,--these form the true\r\neloquence of love, and can always be felt and understood, but never\r\ndescribed. Can we wonder that they should readily win a heart young,\r\nguileless, and susceptible? As to her, she loved almost unconsciously;\r\nshe scarcely inquired what was the growing passion that was absorbing\r\nevery thought and feeling, or what were to be its consequences. She,\r\nindeed, looked not to the future. When present, his looks and words\r\noccupied her whole attention; when absent, she thought but of what had\r\npassed at their recent interview. She would wander with him through the\r\ngreen lanes and rural scenes of the vicinity. He taught her to see new\r\nbeauties in Nature; he talked in the language of polite and cultivated\r\nlife, and breathed into her ear the witcheries of romance and poetry.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there could not have been a passion between the sexes more pure\r\nthan this innocent girl’s. The gallant figure of her youthful admirer\r\nand the splendor of his military attire might at first have charmed her\r\neye, but it was not these that had captivated her heart. Her attachment\r\nhad something in it of idolatry. She looked up to him as to a being of\r\na superior order. She felt in his society the enthusiasm of a mind\r\nnaturally delicate and poetical, and now first awakened to a keen\r\nperception of the beautiful and grand. Of the sordid distinctions\r\nof rank and fortune she thought nothing; it was the difference of\r\nintellect, of demeanor, of manners, from those of the rustic society\r\nto which she had been accustomed, that elevated him in her opinion. She\r\nwould listen to him with charmed ear and downcast look of mute delight,\r\nand her cheek would mantle with enthusiasm; or if ever she ventured a\r\nshy glance of timid admiration, it was as quickly withdrawn, and she\r\nwould sigh and blush at the idea of her comparative unworthiness.\r\n\r\nHer lover was equally impassioned, but his passion was mingled with\r\nfeelings of a coarser nature. He had begun the connection in levity,\r\nfor he had often heard his brother-officers boast of their village\r\nconquests, and thought some triumph of the kind necessary to his\r\nreputation as a man of spirit. But he was too full of youthful fervor.\r\nHis heart had not yet been rendered sufficiently cold and selfish by a\r\nwandering and a dissipated life: it caught fire from the very flame it\r\nsought to kindle, and before he was aware of the nature of his situation\r\nhe became really in love.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? There were the old obstacles which so incessantly\r\noccur in these heedless attachments. His rank in life, the prejudices of\r\ntitled connections, his dependence upon a proud and unyielding father,\r\nall forbade him to think of matrimony; but when he looked down upon\r\nthis innocent being, so tender and confiding, there was a purity in her\r\nmanners, a blamelessness in her life, and a beseeching modesty in her\r\nlooks that awed down every licentious feeling. In vain did he try to\r\nfortify himself by a thousand heartless examples of men of fashion, and\r\nto chill the glow of generous sentiment with that cold derisive levity\r\nwith which he had heard them talk of female virtue: whenever he came\r\ninto her presence she was still surrounded by that mysterious but\r\nimpassive charm of virgin purity in whose hallowed sphere no guilty\r\nthought can live.\r\n\r\nThe sudden arrival of orders for the regiment to repair to the Continent\r\ncompleted the confusion of his mind. He remained for a short time in a\r\nstate of the most painful irresolution; he hesitated to communicate the\r\ntidings until the day for marching was at hand, when he gave her the\r\nintelligence in the course of an evening ramble.\r\n\r\nThe idea of parting had never before occurred to her. It broke in at\r\nonce upon her dream of felicity; she looked upon it as a sudden and\r\ninsurmountable evil, and wept with the guileless simplicity of a child.\r\nHe drew her to his bosom and kissed the tears from her soft cheek; nor\r\ndid he meet with a repulse, for there are moments of mingled sorrow\r\nand tenderness which hallow the caresses of affection. He was naturally\r\nimpetuous, and the sight of beauty apparently yielding in his arms, the\r\nconfidence of his power over her, and the dread of losing her forever\r\nall conspired to overwhelm his better feelings: he ventured to propose\r\nthat she should leave her home and be the companion of his fortunes.\r\n\r\nHe was quite a novice in seduction, and blushed and faltered at his own\r\nbaseness; but so innocent of mind was his intended victim that she was\r\nat first at a loss to comprehend his meaning, and why she should leave\r\nher native village and the humble roof of her parents. When at last\r\nthe nature of his proposal flashed upon her pure mind, the effect was\r\nwithering. She did not weep; she did not break forth into reproach; she\r\nsaid not a word, but she shrunk back aghast as from a viper, gave him a\r\nlook of anguish that pierced to his very soul, and, clasping her hands\r\nin agony, fled, as if for refuge, to her father’s cottage.\r\n\r\nThe officer retired confounded, humiliated, and repentant. It is\r\nuncertain what might have been the result of the conflict of his\r\nfeelings, had not his thoughts been diverted by the bustle of departure.\r\nNew scenes, new pleasures, and new companions soon dissipated his\r\nself-reproach and stifled his tenderness; yet, amidst the stir of camps,\r\nthe revelries of garrisons, the array of armies, and even the din of\r\nbattles, his thoughts would sometimes steal back to the scenes of rural\r\nquiet and village simplicity--the white cottage, the footpath along\r\nthe silver brook and up the hawthorn hedge, and the little village maid\r\nloitering along it, leaning on his arm and listening to him with eyes\r\nbeaming with unconscious affection.\r\n\r\nThe shock which the poor girl had received in the destruction of all her\r\nideal world had indeed been cruel. Faintings and hysterics had at first\r\nshaken her tender frame, and were succeeded by a settled and pining\r\nmelancholy. She had beheld from her window the march of the departing\r\ntroops. She had seen her faithless lover borne off, as if in triumph,\r\namidst the sound of drum and trumpet and the pomp of arms. She strained\r\na last aching gaze after him as the morning sun glittered about his\r\nfigure and his plume waved in the breeze; he passed away like a bright\r\nvision from her sight, and left her all in darkness.\r\n\r\nIt would be trite to dwell on the particulars of her after story. It\r\nwas, like other tales of love, melancholy. She avoided society and\r\nwandered out alone in the walks she had most frequented with her lover.\r\nShe sought, like the stricken deer, to weep in silence and loneliness\r\nand brood over the barbed sorrow that rankled in her soul. Sometimes\r\nshe would be seen late of an evening sitting in the porch of the village\r\nchurch, and the milk-maids, returning from the fields, would now and\r\nthen overhear her singing some plaintive ditty in the hawthorn walk. She\r\nbecame fervent in her devotions at church, and as the old people saw her\r\napproach, so wasted away, yet with a hectic gloom and that hallowed air\r\nwhich melancholy diffuses round the form, they would make way for her as\r\nfor something spiritual, and looking after her, would shake their heads\r\nin gloomy foreboding.\r\n\r\nShe felt a conviction that she was hastening to the tomb, but looked\r\nforward to it as a place of rest. The silver cord that had bound her to\r\nexistence was loosed, and there seemed to be no more pleasure under the\r\nsun. If ever her gentle bosom had entertained resentment against her\r\nlover, it was extinguished. She was incapable of angry passions, and in\r\na moment of saddened tenderness she penned him a farewell letter. It was\r\ncouched in the simplest language, but touching from its very simplicity.\r\nShe told him that she was dying, and did not conceal from him that his\r\nconduct was the cause. She even depicted the sufferings which she had\r\nexperienced, but concluded with saying that she could not die in peace\r\nuntil she had sent him her forgiveness and her blessing.\r\n\r\nBy degrees her strength declined that she could no longer leave the\r\ncottage. She could only totter to the window, where, propped up in\r\nher chair, it was her enjoyment to sit all day and look out upon the\r\nlandscape. Still she uttered no complaint nor imparted to any one the\r\nmalady that was preying on her heart. She never even mentioned her\r\nlover’s name, but would lay her head on her mother’s bosom and weep in\r\nsilence. Her poor parents hung in mute anxiety over this fading blossom\r\nof their hopes, still flattering themselves that it might again revive\r\nto freshness and that the bright unearthly bloom which sometimes flushed\r\nher cheek might be the promise of returning health.\r\n\r\nIn this way she was seated between them one Sunday afternoon; her hands\r\nwere clasped in theirs, the lattice was thrown open, and the soft\r\nair that stole in brought with it the fragrance of the clustering\r\nhoneysuckle which her own hands had trained round the window.\r\n\r\nHer father had just been reading a chapter in the Bible: it spoke of the\r\nvanity of worldly things and of the joys of heaven: it seemed to have\r\ndiffused comfort and serenity through her bosom. Her eye was fixed on\r\nthe distant village church: the bell had tolled for the evening service;\r\nthe last villager was lagging into the porch, and everything had sunk\r\ninto that hallowed stillness peculiar to the day of rest. Her parents\r\nwere gazing on her with yearning hearts. Sickness and sorrow, which\r\npass so roughly over some faces, had given to hers the expression of a\r\nseraph’s. A tear trembled in her soft blue eye. Was she thinking of\r\nher faithless lover? or were her thoughts wandering to that distant\r\nchurchyard, into whose bosom she might soon be gathered?\r\n\r\nSuddenly the clang of hoofs was heard: a horseman galloped to the\r\ncottage; he dismounted before the window; the poor girl gave a faint\r\nexclamation and sunk back in her chair: it was her repentant lover. He\r\nrushed into the house and flew to clasp her to his bosom; but her\r\nwasted form, her deathlike countenance--so wan, yet so lovely in its\r\ndesolation--smote him to the soul, and he threw himself in agony at her\r\nfeet. She was too faint to rise--she attempted to extend her trembling\r\nhand--her lips moved as if she spoke, but no word was articulated; she\r\nlooked down upon him with a smile of unutterable tenderness, and closed\r\nher eyes forever.\r\n\r\nSuch are the particulars which I gathered of this village story. They\r\nare but scanty, and I am conscious have little novelty to recommend\r\nthem. In the present rage also for strange incident and high-seasoned\r\nnarrative they may appear trite and insignificant, but they interested\r\nme strongly at the time; and, taken in connection with the affecting\r\nceremony which I had just witnessed, left a deeper impression on my mind\r\nthan many circumstances of a more striking nature. I have passed through\r\nthe place since, and visited the church again from a better motive than\r\nmere curiosity. It was a wintry evening: the trees were stripped of\r\ntheir foliage, the churchyard looked naked and mournful, and the wind\r\nrustled coldly through the dry grass. Evergreens, however, had been\r\nplanted about the grave of the village favorite, and osiers were bent\r\nover it to keep the turf uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe church-door was open and I stepped in. There hung the chaplet of\r\nflowers and the gloves, as on the day of the funeral: the flowers were\r\nwithered, it is true, but care seemed to have been taken that no dust\r\nshould soil their whiteness. I have seen many monuments where art has\r\nexhausted its powers to awaken the sympathy of the spectator, but I have\r\nmet with none that spoke more touchingly to my heart than this simple\r\nbut delicate memento of departed innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLER.\r\n\r\n    This day Dame Nature seem’d in love,\r\n    The lusty sap began to move,\r\n    Fresh juice did stir th’ embracing vines,\r\n    And birds had drawn their valentines.\r\n    The jealous trout that low did lie,\r\n    Rose at a well-dissembled flie.\r\n    There stood my friend, with patient skill,\r\n    Attending of his trembling quill.\r\n                                  SIR H. WOTTON.\r\n\r\nIT is said that many an unlucky urchin is induced to run away from his\r\nfamily and betake himself to a seafaring life from reading the history\r\nof Robinson Crusoe; and I suspect that, in like manner, many of those\r\nworthy gentlemen who are given to haunt the sides of pastoral streams\r\nwith angle-rods in hand may trace the origin of their passion to\r\nthe seductive pages of honest Izaak Walton. I recollect studying his\r\nComplete Angler several years since in company with a knot of friends\r\nin America, and moreover that we were all completely bitten with the\r\nangling mania. It was early in the year, but as soon as the weather was\r\nauspicious, and that the spring began to melt into the verge of summer,\r\nwe took rod in hand and sallied into the country, as stark mad as was\r\never Don Quixote from reading books of chivalry.\r\n\r\nOne of our party had equalled the Don in the fulness of his equipments,\r\nbeing attired cap-a-pie for the enterprise. He wore a broad-skirted\r\nfustian coat, perplexed with half a hundred pockets; a pair of stout\r\nshoes and leathern gaiters; a basket slung on one side for fish; a\r\npatent rod, a landing net, and a score of other inconveniences only to\r\nbe found in the true angler’s armory. Thus harnessed for the field, he\r\nwas as great a matter of stare and wonderment among the country folk,\r\nwho had never seen a regular angler, as was the steel-clad hero of La\r\nMancha among the goatherds of the Sierra Morena.\r\n\r\nOur first essay was along a mountain brook among the Highlands of the\r\nHudson--a most unfortunate place for the execution of those piscatory\r\ntactics which had been invented along the velvet margins of quiet\r\nEnglish rivulets. It was one of those wild streams that lavish, among\r\nour romantic solitudes, unheeded beauties enough to fill the sketch-book\r\nof a hunter of the picturesque. Sometimes it would leap down rocky\r\nshelves, making small cascades, over which the trees threw their broad\r\nbalancing sprays and long nameless weeds hung in fringes from the\r\nimpending banks, dripping with diamond drops. Sometimes it would brawl\r\nand fret along a ravine in the matted shade of a forest, filling it with\r\nmurmurs, and after this termagant career would steal forth into open\r\nday with the most placid, demure face imaginable, as I have seen some\r\npestilent shrew of a housewife, after filling her home with uproar\r\nand ill-humor, come dimpling out of doors, swimming and curtseying and\r\nsmiling upon all the world.\r\n\r\nHow smoothly would this vagrant brook glide at such times through some\r\nbosom of green meadowland among the mountains, where the quiet was only\r\ninterrupted by the occasional tinkling of a bell from the lazy cattle\r\namong the clover or the sound of a woodcutter’s axe from the neighboring\r\nforest!\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was always a bungler at all kinds of sport that required\r\neither patience or adroitness, and had not angled above half an hour\r\nbefore I had completely “satisfied the sentiment,” and convinced myself\r\nof the truth of Izaak Walton’s opinion, that angling is something like\r\npoetry--a man must be born to it. I hooked myself instead of the fish,\r\ntangled my line in every tree, lost my bait, broke my rod, until I gave\r\nup the attempt in despair, and passed the day under the trees reading\r\nold Izaak, satisfied that it was his fascinating vein of honest\r\nsimplicity and rural feeling that had bewitched me, and not the passion\r\nfor angling. My companions, however, were more persevering in their\r\ndelusion. I have them at this moment before eyes, stealing along the\r\nborder of the brook where it lay open to the day or was merely fringed\r\nby shrubs and bushes. I see the bittern rising with hollow scream as\r\nthey break in upon his rarely-invaded haunt; the kingfisher watching\r\nthem suspiciously from his dry tree that overhangs the deep black\r\nmillpond in the gorge of the hills; the tortoise letting himself slip\r\nsideways from off the stone or log on which he is sunning himself;\r\nand the panic-struck frog plumping in headlong as they approach, and\r\nspreading an alarm throughout the watery world around.\r\n\r\nI recollect also that, after toiling and watching and creeping about for\r\nthe greater part of a day, with scarcely any success in spite of all our\r\nadmirable apparatus, a lubberly country urchin came down from the hills\r\nwith a rod made from a branch of a tree, a few yards of twine, and, as\r\nHeaven shall help me! I believe a crooked pin for a hook, baited with a\r\nvile earthworm, and in half an hour caught more fish than we had nibbles\r\nthroughout the day!\r\n\r\nBut, above all, I recollect the “good, honest, wholesome, hungry” repast\r\nwhich we made under a beech tree just by a spring of pure sweet water\r\nthat stole out of the side of a hill, and how, when it was over, one of\r\nthe party read old Izaak Walton’s scene with the milkmaid, while I lay\r\non the grass and built castles in a bright pile of clouds until I fell\r\nasleep. All this may appear like mere egotism, yet I cannot refrain from\r\nuttering these recollections, which are passing like a strain of music\r\nover my mind and have been called up by an agreeable scene which I\r\nwitnessed not long since.\r\n\r\nIn the morning’s stroll along the banks of the Alun, a beautiful little\r\nstream which flows down from the Welsh hills and throws itself into\r\nthe Dee, my attention was attracted to a group seated on the margin.\r\nOn approaching I found it to consist of a veteran angler and two rustic\r\ndisciples. The former was an old fellow with a wooden leg, with clothes\r\nvery much but very carefully patched, betokening poverty honestly come\r\nby and decently maintained. His face bore the marks of former storms,\r\nbut present fair weather, its furrows had been worn into an habitual\r\nsmile, his iron-gray locks hung about his ears, and he had altogether\r\nthe good-humored air of a constitutional philosopher who was disposed to\r\ntake the world as it went. One of his companions was a ragged wight with\r\nthe skulking look of an arrant poacher, and I’ll warrant could find\r\nhis way to any gentleman’s fish-pond in the neighborhood in the darkest\r\nnight. The other was a tall, awkward country lad, with a lounging\r\ngait, and apparently somewhat of a rustic beau. The old man was busy in\r\nexamining the maw of a trout which he had just killed, to discover by\r\nits contents what insects were seasonable for bait, and was lecturing\r\non the subject to his companions, who appeared to listen with infinite\r\ndeference. I have a kind feeling towards all “brothers of the angle”\r\n ever since I read Izaak Walton. They are men, he affirms, of a “mild,\r\nsweet, and peaceable spirit;” and my esteem for them has been increased\r\nsince I met with an old Tretyse of fishing with the Angle, in which are\r\nset forth many of the maxims of their inoffensive fraternity. “Take\r\ngood hede,” sayeth this honest little tretyse, “that in going about your\r\ndisportes ye open no man’s gates but that ye shet them again. Also ye\r\nshall not use this forsayd crafti disport for no covetousness to the\r\nencreasing and sparing of your money only, but principally for your\r\nsolace, and to cause the helth of your body and specyally of your\r\nsoule.” *\r\n\r\nI thought that I could perceive in the veteran angler before me\r\nan exemplification of what I had read; and there was a cheerful\r\ncontentedness in his looks that quite drew me towards him. I could not\r\nbut remark the gallant manner in which he stumped from one part of\r\nthe brook to another, waving his rod in the air to keep the line from\r\ndragging on the ground or catching among the bushes, and the adroitness\r\nwith which he would throw his fly to any particular place, sometimes\r\nskimming it lightly along a little rapid, sometimes casting it into one\r\nof those dark holes made by a twisted root or overhanging bank in\r\nwhich the large trout are apt to lurk. In the meanwhile he was giving\r\ninstructions to his two disciples, showing them the manner in which\r\nthey should handle their rods, fix their flies, and play them along the\r\nsurface of the stream. The scene brought to my mind the instructions\r\nof the sage Piscator to his scholar. The country around was of that\r\npastoral kind which Walton is fond of describing. It was a part of the\r\ngreat plain of Cheshire, close by the beautiful vale of Gessford,\r\nand just where the inferior Welsh hills begin to swell up from among\r\nfresh-smelling meadows. The day too, like that recorded in his work, was\r\nmild and sunshiny, with now and then a soft-dropping shower that sowed\r\nthe whole earth with diamonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * From this same treatise it would appear that angling is a\r\n     more industrious and devout employment than it is generally\r\n     considered: “For when ye purpose to go on your disportes in\r\n     fishynge ye will not desyre greatlye many persons with you,\r\n     which might let you of your game. And that ye may serve God\r\n     devoutly in saying effectually your customable prayers. And\r\n     thus doying, ye shall eschew and also avoyde many vices, as\r\n     ydelness, which is principall cause to induce man to many\r\n     other vices, as it is right well known.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI soon fell into conversation with the old angler, and was so much\r\nentertained that, under pretext of receiving instructions in his art, I\r\nkept company with him almost the whole day, wandering along the banks of\r\nthe stream and listening to his talk. He was very communicative, having\r\nall the easy garrulity of cheerful old age, and I fancy was a little\r\nflattered by having an opportunity of displaying his piscatory lore, for\r\nwho does not like now and then to play the sage?\r\n\r\nHe had been much of a rambler in his day, and had passed some years of\r\nhis youth in America, particularly in Savannah, where he had entered\r\ninto trade and had been ruined by the indiscretion of a partner. He had\r\nafterwards experienced many ups and downs in life until he got into the\r\nnavy, where his leg was carried away by a cannon-ball at the battle of\r\nCamperdown. This was the only stroke of real good-fortune he had ever\r\nexperienced, for it got him a pension, which, together with some small\r\npaternal property, brought him in a revenue of nearly forty pounds.\r\nOn this he retired to his native village, where he lived quietly and\r\nindependently, and devoted the remainder of his life to the “noble art\r\nof angling.”\r\n\r\nI found that he had read Izaak Walton attentively, and he seemed to have\r\nimbibed all his simple frankness and prevalent good-humor. Though he had\r\nbeen sorely buffeted about the world, he was satisfied that the world,\r\nin itself, was good and beautiful. Though he had been as roughly used in\r\ndifferent countries as a poor sheep that is fleeced by every hedge\r\nand thicket, yet he spoke of every nation with candor and kindness,\r\nappearing to look only on the good side of things; and, above all, he\r\nwas almost the only man I had ever met with who had been an unfortunate\r\nadventurer in America and had honesty and magnanimity enough to take the\r\nfault to his own door, and not to curse the country. The lad that was\r\nreceiving his instructions, I learnt, was the son and heir-apparent of\r\na fat old widow who kept the village inn, and of course a youth of some\r\nexpectation, and much courted by the idle gentleman-like personages\r\nof the place. In taking him under his care, therefore, the old man had\r\nprobably an eye to a privileged corner in the tap-room and an occasional\r\ncup of cheerful ale free of expense.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly something in angling--if we could forget, which\r\nanglers are apt to do, the cruelties and tortures inflicted on worms\r\nand insects--that tends to produce a gentleness of spirit and a\r\npure serenity of mind. As the English are methodical even in their\r\nrecreations, and are the most scientific of sportsmen, it has been\r\nreduced among them to perfect rule and system. Indeed, it is an\r\namusement peculiarly adapted to the mild and highly-cultivated scenery\r\nof England, where every roughness has been softened away from the\r\nlandscape. It is delightful to saunter along those limpid streams\r\nwhich wander, like veins of silver, through the bosom of this\r\nbeautiful country, leading one through a diversity of small home\r\nscenery--sometimes winding through ornamented grounds; sometimes\r\nbrimming along through rich pasturage, where the fresh green is mingled\r\nwith sweet-smelling flowers; sometimes venturing in sight of villages\r\nand hamlets, and then running capriciously away into shady retirements.\r\nThe sweetness and serenity of Nature and the quiet watchfulness of the\r\nsport gradually bring on pleasant fits of musing, which are now and then\r\nagreeably interrupted by the song of a bird, the distant whistle of the\r\npeasant, or perhaps the vagary of some fish leaping out of the still\r\nwater and skimming transiently about its glassy surface. “When I would\r\nbeget content,” says Izaak Walton, “and increase confidence in the power\r\nand wisdom and providence of Almighty God, I will walk the meadows by\r\nsome gliding stream, and there contemplate the lilies that take no care,\r\nand those very many other little living creatures that are not only\r\ncreated, but fed (man knows not how) by the goodness of the God of\r\nNature, and therefore trust in Him.”\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear to give another quotation from one of those ancient\r\nchampions of angling which breathes the same innocent and happy spirit:\r\n\r\n    Let me live harmlessly, and near the brink\r\n        Of Trent or Avon have a dwelling-place:\r\n    Where I may see my quill, or cork, down sink\r\n        With eager bite of Pike, or Bleak, or Dace;\r\n    And on the world and my Creator think:\r\n        Whilst some men strive ill-gotten goods t’ embrace:\r\n    And others spend their time in base excess\r\n    Of wine, or worse, in war or wantonness.\r\n\r\n    Let them that will, these pastimes still pursue,\r\n        And on such pleasing fancies feed their fill;\r\n    So I the fields and meadows green may view,\r\n        And daily by fresh rivers walk at will,\r\n    Among the daisies and the violets blue,\r\n        Red hyacinth and yellow daffodil.*\r\n\r\nOn parting with the old angler I inquired after his place of abode,\r\nand, happening to be in the neighborhood of the village a few evenings\r\nafterwards, I had the curiosity to seek him out. I found him living in\r\na small cottage containing only one room, but a perfect curiosity in its\r\nmethod and arrangement. It was on the skirts of the village, on a green\r\nbank a little back from the road, with a small garden in front stocked\r\nwith kitchen herbs and adorned with a few flowers. The whole front of\r\nthe cottage was overrun with a honeysuckle. On the top was a ship for a\r\nweathercock. The interior was fitted up in a truly nautical style, his\r\nideas of comfort and convenience having been acquired on the berth-deck\r\nof a man-of-war. A hammock was slung from the ceiling which in the\r\ndaytime was lashed up so as to take but little room. From the centre of\r\nthe chamber hung a model of a ship, of his own workmanship. Two or three\r\nchairs, a table, and a large sea-chest formed the principal movables.\r\nAbout the wall were stuck up naval ballads, such as “Admiral Hosier’s\r\nGhost,” “All in the Downs,” and “Tom Bowling,” intermingled with\r\npictures of sea-fights, among which the battle of Camperdown held a\r\ndistinguished place. The mantelpiece was decorated with sea-shells, over\r\nwhich hung a quadrant, flanked by two wood-cuts of most bitter-looking\r\nnaval commanders. His implements for angling were carefully disposed\r\non nails and hooks about the room. On a shelf was arranged his library,\r\ncontaining a work on angling, much worn, a Bible covered with canvas, an\r\nodd volume or two of voyages, a nautical almanac, and a book of songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * J. Davors.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis family consisted of a large black cat with one eye, and a parrot\r\nwhich he had caught and tamed and educated himself in the course of\r\none of his voyages, and which uttered a variety of sea-phrases with the\r\nhoarse brattling tone of a veteran boatswain. The establishment reminded\r\nme of that of the renowned Robinson Crusoe; it was kept in neat order,\r\neverything being “stowed away” with the regularity of a ship of war;\r\nand he informed me that he “scoured the deck every morning and swept it\r\nbetween meals.”\r\n\r\nI found him seated on a bench before the door, smoking his pipe in the\r\nsoft evening sunshine. His cat was purring soberly on the threshold, and\r\nhis parrot describing some strange evolutions in an iron ring that swung\r\nin the centre of his cage. He had been angling all day, and gave me a\r\nhistory of his sport with as much minuteness as a general would talk\r\nover a campaign, being particularly animated in relating the manner in\r\nwhich he had taken a large trout, which had completely tasked all his\r\nskill and wariness, and which he had sent as a trophy to mine hostess of\r\nthe inn.\r\n\r\nHow comforting it is to see a cheerful and contented old age, and to\r\nbehold a poor fellow like this, after being tempest-tost through life,\r\nsafely moored in a snug and quiet harbor in the evening of his days! His\r\nhappiness, however, sprung from within himself and was independent of\r\nexternal circumstances, for he had that inexhaustible good-nature which\r\nis the most precious gift of Heaven, spreading itself like oil over the\r\ntroubled sea of thought, and keeping the mind smooth and equable in the\r\nroughest weather.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring further about him, I learnt that he was a universal\r\nfavorite in the village and the oracle of the tap-room, where he\r\ndelighted the rustics with his songs, and, like Sindbad, astonished them\r\nwith his stories of strange lands and shipwrecks and sea-fights. He was\r\nmuch noticed too by gentlemen sportsmen of the neighborhood, had taught\r\nseveral of them the art of angling, and was a privileged visitor to\r\ntheir kitchens. The whole tenor of his life was quiet and inoffensive,\r\nbeing principally passed about the neighboring streams when the weather\r\nand season were favorable; and at other times he employed himself\r\nat home, preparing his fishing-tackle for the next campaign or\r\nmanufacturing rods, nets, and flies for his patrons and pupils among the\r\ngentry.\r\n\r\nHe was a regular attendant at church on Sundays, though he generally\r\nfell asleep during the sermon. He had made it his particular request\r\nthat when he died he should be buried in a green spot which he could see\r\nfrom his seat in church, and which he had marked out ever since he was\r\na boy, and had thought of when far from home on the raging sea in danger\r\nof being food for the fishes: it was the spot where his father and\r\nmother had been buried.\r\n\r\nI have done, for I fear that my reader is growing weary, but I could not\r\nrefrain from drawing the picture of this worthy “brother of the angle,”\r\n who has made me more than ever in love with the theory, though I fear I\r\nshall never be adroit in the practice, of his art; and I will conclude\r\nthis rambling sketch in the words of honest Izaak Walton, by craving the\r\nblessing of St. Peter’s Master upon my reader, “and upon all that are\r\ntrue lovers of virtue, and dare trust in His providence, and be quiet,\r\nand go a-angling.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW.\r\n\r\n(FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.)\r\n\r\n    A pleasing land of drowsy-head it was,\r\n        Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye,\r\n    And of gay castles in the clouds that pays,\r\n        For ever flushing round a summer sky.\r\n                                       Castle of Indolence\r\n\r\nIN the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern\r\nshore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated\r\nby the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always\r\nprudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas\r\nwhen they crossed, there lies a small market-town or rural port which\r\nby some is called Greensburg, but which is more generally and properly\r\nknown by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in\r\nformer days by the good housewives of the adjacent country from the\r\ninveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village\r\ntavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact,\r\nbut merely advert to it for the sake of being precise and authentic.\r\nNot far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little\r\nvalley, or rather lap of land, among high hills, which is one of the\r\nquietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it,\r\nwith just murmur enough to lull one to repose, and the occasional\r\nwhistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound\r\nthat ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI recollect that when a stripling my first exploit in squirrel-shooting\r\nwas in a grove of tall walnut trees that shades one side of the valley.\r\nI had wandered into it at noontime, when all Nature is peculiarly quiet,\r\nand was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the Sabbath\r\nstillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.\r\nIf ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world\r\nand its distractions and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled\r\nlife, I know of none more promising than this little valley.\r\n\r\nFrom the listless repose of the place and the peculiar character of its\r\ninhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this\r\nsequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and\r\nits rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the\r\nneighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the\r\nland and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place\r\nwas bewitched by a High German doctor during the early days of the\r\nsettlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of\r\nhis tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by\r\nMaster Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under\r\nthe sway of some witching power that holds a spell over the minds of the\r\ngood people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given\r\nto all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions,\r\nand frequently see strange sights and hear music and voices in the air.\r\nThe whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and\r\ntwilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the\r\nvalley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with\r\nher whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.\r\n\r\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and\r\nseems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the\r\napparition of a figure on horseback without a head. It is said by some\r\nto be the ghost of a Hessian trooper whose head had been carried away by\r\na cannonball in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and\r\nwho is ever and anon seen by the country-folk hurrying along in the\r\ngloom of night as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not\r\nconfined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and\r\nespecially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed,\r\ncertain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been\r\ncareful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this\r\nspectre, allege that the body of the trooper, having been buried in\r\nthe churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly\r\nquest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes\r\npasses along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being\r\nbelated and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has\r\nfurnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows;\r\nand the spectre is known at all the country firesides by the name of the\r\nHeadless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not\r\nconfined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously\r\nimbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake\r\nthey may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure\r\nin a little time to inhale the witching influence of the air and begin\r\nto grow imaginative--to dream dreams and see apparitions.\r\n\r\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such\r\nlittle retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the\r\ngreat State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain\r\nfixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is\r\nmaking such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country,\r\nsweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still\r\nwater which border a rapid stream where we may see the straw and bubble\r\nriding quietly at anchor or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor,\r\nundisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have\r\nelapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question\r\nwhether I should not still find the same trees and the same families\r\nvegetating in its sheltered bosom.\r\n\r\nIn this by-place of Nature there abode, in a remote period of American\r\nhistory--that is to say, some thirty years since--a worthy wight of the\r\nname of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, “tarried,”\r\n in Sleepy Hollow for the purpose of instructing the children of the\r\nvicinity. He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the\r\nUnion with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends\r\nforth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters.\r\nThe cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall,\r\nbut exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands\r\nthat dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for\r\nshovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was\r\nsmall, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a\r\nlong snip nose, so that it looked like a weathercock perched upon his\r\nspindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along\r\nthe profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and\r\nfluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius\r\nof Famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a\r\ncornfield.\r\n\r\nHis school-house was a low building of one large room, rudely\r\nconstructed of logs, the windows partly glazed and partly patched with\r\nleaves of old copybooks. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours\r\nby a withe twisted in the handle of the door and stakes set against the\r\nwindow-shutters, so that, though a thief might get in with perfect ease,\r\nhe would find some embarrassment in getting out---an idea most probably\r\nborrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of\r\nan eel-pot. The school-house stood in a rather lonely but pleasant\r\nsituation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close\r\nby and a formidable birch tree growing at one end of it. From hence the\r\nlow murmur of his pupils’ voices, conning over their lessons, might be\r\nheard in a drowsy summer’s day like the hum of a bee-hive, interrupted\r\nnow and then by the authoritative voice of the master in the tone of\r\nmenace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch\r\nas he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge.\r\nTruth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the\r\ngolden maxim, “Spare the rod and spoil the child.” Ichabod Crane’s\r\nscholars certainly were not spoiled.\r\n\r\nI would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel\r\npotentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on\r\nthe contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than\r\nseverity, taking the burden off the backs of the weak and laying it on\r\nthose of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least\r\nflourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of\r\njustice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little\r\ntough, wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled\r\nand grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called “doing\r\nhis duty by their parents;” and he never inflicted a chastisement\r\nwithout following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting\r\nurchin, that “he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day\r\nhe had to live.”\r\n\r\nWhen school-hours were over he was even the companion and playmate of\r\nthe larger boys, and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the\r\nsmaller ones home who happened to have pretty sisters or good housewives\r\nfor mothers noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed it behooved\r\nhim to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his\r\nschool was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him\r\nwith daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the\r\ndilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance he was,\r\naccording to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the\r\nhouses of the farmers whose children he instructed. With these he lived\r\nsuccessively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood\r\nwith all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThat all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic\r\npatrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous\r\nburden and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of\r\nrendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers\r\noccasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make\r\nhay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from\r\npasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the\r\ndominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little\r\nempire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating.\r\nHe found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children,\r\nparticularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so\r\nmagnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee\r\nand rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the\r\nneighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the\r\nyoung folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on\r\nSundays to take his station in front of the church-gallery with a band\r\nof chosen singers, where, in his own mind, he completely carried away\r\nthe palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above\r\nall the rest of the congregation, and there are peculiar quavers still\r\nto be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off,\r\nquite to the opposite side of the mill-pond on a still Sunday morning,\r\nwhich are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod\r\nCrane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts in that ingenious way which is\r\ncommonly denominated “by hook and by crook,” the worthy pedagogue got on\r\ntolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the\r\nlabor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female\r\ncircle of a rural neighborhood, being considered a kind of idle,\r\ngentleman-like personage of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to\r\nthe rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the\r\nparson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir\r\nat the tea-table of a farmhouse and the addition of a supernumerary\r\ndish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver\r\ntea-pot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the\r\nsmiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the\r\nchurchyard between services on Sundays, gathering grapes for them from\r\nthe wild vines that overrun the surrounding trees; reciting for their\r\namusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a\r\nwhole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond, while the\r\nmore bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior\r\nelegance and address.\r\n\r\nFrom his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette,\r\ncarrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that\r\nhis appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover,\r\nesteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read\r\nseveral books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather’s\r\nHistory of New England Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly\r\nand potently believed.\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple\r\ncredulity. His appetite for the marvellous and his powers of digesting\r\nit were equally extraordinary, and both had been increased by his\r\nresidence in this spellbound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous\r\nfor his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school\r\nwas dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of\r\nclover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his school-house,\r\nand there con over old Mather’s direful tales until the gathering dusk\r\nof the evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then,\r\nas he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland to the\r\nfarmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of Nature at\r\nthat witching hour fluttered his excited imagination--the moan of the\r\nwhip-poor-will* from the hillside; the boding cry of the tree-toad, that\r\nharbinger of storm; the dreary hooting of the screech-owl, or the\r\nsudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost. The\r\nfire-flies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now\r\nand then startled him as one of uncommon brightness would stream across\r\nhis path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging\r\nhis blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up\r\nthe ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch’s token. His\r\nonly resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away\r\nevil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes; and the good people of Sleepy\r\nHollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with\r\nawe at hearing his nasal melody, “in linked sweetness long drawn out,”\r\n floating from the distant hill or along the dusky road.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * The whip-poor-will is a bird which is only heard at night.\r\n     It receives its name from its note, which is thought to\r\n     resemble those words.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter\r\nevenings with the old Dutch wives as they sat spinning by the fire, with\r\na row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen\r\nto their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields,\r\nand haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and\r\nparticularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the\r\nHollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally\r\nby his anecdotes of witchcraft and of the direful omens and portentous\r\nsights and sounds in the air which prevailed in the earlier times of\r\nConnecticut, and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon\r\ncomets and shooting stars, and with the alarming fact that the world did\r\nabsolutely turn round and that they were half the time topsy-turvy.\r\n\r\nBut if there was a pleasure in all this while snugly cuddling in the\r\nchimney-corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the\r\ncrackling wood-fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show\r\nits face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk\r\nhomewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path amidst the dim\r\nand ghastly glare of a snowy night! With what wistful look did he eye\r\nevery trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some\r\ndistant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with\r\nsnow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How often did\r\nhe shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty\r\ncrust beneath his feet, and dread to look over his shoulder, lest he\r\nshould behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! And how\r\noften was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast howling\r\namong the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of\r\nhis nightly scourings!\r\n\r\nAll these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind\r\nthat walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time,\r\nand been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes in his lonely\r\nperambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would\r\nhave passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the devil and all his\r\nworks, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more\r\nperplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of\r\nwitches put together, and that was--a woman.\r\n\r\nAmong the musical disciples who assembled one evening in each week\r\nto receive his instructions in psalmody was Katrina Van Tassel, the\r\ndaughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a\r\nblooming lass of fresh eighteen, plump as a partridge, ripe and melting\r\nand rosy-cheeked as one of her father’s peaches, and universally famed,\r\nnot merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a\r\nlittle of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was\r\na mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off\r\nher charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold which her\r\ngreat-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam, the tempting\r\nstomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat to\r\ndisplay the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.\r\n\r\nIchabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex, and it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his\r\neyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion.\r\nOld Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented,\r\nliberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or\r\nhis thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm, but within those\r\neverything was snug, happy, and well-conditioned. He was satisfied\r\nwith his wealth but not proud of it, and piqued himself upon the hearty\r\nabundance, rather than the style, in which he lived. His stronghold was\r\nsituated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered,\r\nfertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A\r\ngreat elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which\r\nbubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water in a little well\r\nformed of a barrel, and then stole sparkling away through the grass to\r\na neighboring brook that bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows.\r\nHard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a\r\nchurch, every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the\r\ntreasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from\r\nmorning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the\r\neaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching\r\nthe weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their\r\nbosoms, and others, swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames,\r\nwere enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek, unwieldy porkers were\r\ngrunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, whence sallied\r\nforth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs as if to snuff the air.\r\nA stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond,\r\nconvoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling\r\nthrough the farmyard, and guinea-fowls fretting about it, like\r\nill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before\r\nthe barn-door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a\r\nwarrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing\r\nin the pride and gladness of his heart--sometimes tearing up the earth\r\nwith his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of\r\nwives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.\r\n\r\nThe pedagogue’s mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise\r\nof luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind’s eye he pictured to\r\nhimself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly\r\nand an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a\r\ncomfortable pie and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were\r\nswimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes,\r\nlike snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In\r\nthe porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon and juicy\r\nrelishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with\r\nits gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory\r\nsausages; and even bright Chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back\r\nin a side-dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which\r\nhis chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.\r\n\r\nAs the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great\r\ngreen eyes over the fat meadow-lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye,\r\nof buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy\r\nfruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart\r\nyearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his\r\nimagination expanded with the idea how they might be readily turned into\r\ncash and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land and shingle\r\npalaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his\r\nhopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of\r\nchildren, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery,\r\nwith pots and kettles dangling beneath, and he beheld himself bestriding\r\na pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, or the Lord knows where.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the house the conquest of his heart was complete. It\r\nwas one of those spacious farmhouses with high-ridged but lowly-sloping\r\nroofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers, the\r\nlow projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front capable of being\r\nclosed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various\r\nutensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring\r\nriver. Benches were built along the sides for summer use, and a great\r\nspinning-wheel at one end and a churn at the other showed the various\r\nuses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza\r\nthe wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of\r\nthe mansion and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent\r\npewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner\r\nstood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun; in another a quantity of\r\nlinsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn and strings of\r\ndried apples and peaches hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled\r\nwith the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into\r\nthe best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables\r\nshone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and\r\ntongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges\r\nand conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored\r\nbirds’ eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from\r\nthe centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open,\r\ndisplayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight the\r\npeace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the\r\naffections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise,\r\nhowever, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of\r\na knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters,\r\nfiery dragons, and such-like easily-conquered adversaries to contend\r\nwith, and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass\r\nand walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was\r\nconfined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way\r\nto the centre of a Christmas pie, and then the lady gave him her hand as\r\na matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to\r\nthe heart of a country coquette beset with a labyrinth of whims\r\nand caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and\r\nimpediments, and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries\r\nof real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers who beset every\r\nportal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other,\r\nbut ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.\r\n\r\nAmong these the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roistering\r\nblade of the name of Abraham--or, according to the Dutch abbreviation,\r\nBrom--Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with\r\nhis feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and\r\ndouble-jointed, with short curly black hair and a bluff but not\r\nunpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance.\r\nFrom his Herculean frame and great powers of limb, he had received the\r\nnickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed\r\nfor great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on\r\nhorseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cockfights, and,\r\nwith the ascendancy which bodily strength acquires in rustic life, was\r\nthe umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side and giving his\r\ndecisions with an air and tone admitting of no gainsay or appeal. He was\r\nalways ready for either a fight or a frolic, but had more mischief than\r\nill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness\r\nthere was a strong dash of waggish good-humor at bottom. He had three or\r\nfour boon companions who regarded him as their model, and at the head of\r\nwhom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment\r\nfor miles around. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap\r\nsurmounted with a flaunting fox’s tail; and when the folks at a country\r\ngathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking\r\nabout among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall.\r\nSometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farm-houses at\r\nmidnight with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks, and the\r\nold dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till\r\nthe hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, “Ay, there goes\r\nBrom Bones and his gang!” The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture\r\nof awe, admiration, and good-will, and when any madcap prank or rustic\r\nbrawl occurred in the vicinity always shook their heads and warranted\r\nBrom Bones was at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nThis rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina\r\nfor the object of his uncouth gallantries, and, though his amorous\r\ntoyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a\r\nbear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his\r\nhopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to\r\nretire who felt no inclination to cross a line in his amours; insomuch,\r\nthat when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel’s paling on a Sunday\r\nnight, a sure sign that his master was courting--or, as it is termed,\r\n“sparking”--within, all other suitors passed by in despair and carried\r\nthe war into other quarters.\r\n\r\nSuch was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend,\r\nand, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk\r\nfrom the competition and a wiser (*)man would have despaired. He had,\r\nhowever, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature;\r\nhe was in form and spirit like a supple jack--yielding, but tough;\r\nthough he bent, he never broke and though he bowed beneath the slightest\r\npressure, yet the moment it was away, jerk! he was as erect and carried\r\nhis head as high as ever.\r\n\r\nTo have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness\r\nfor he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that\r\nstormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a\r\nquiet and gently-insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of\r\nsinging-master, he made frequent visits at the farm-house; not that he\r\nhad anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents,\r\nwhich is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van\r\nTassel was an easy, indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even\r\nthan his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let\r\nher have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough\r\nto do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry for, as she\r\nsagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things and must be looked\r\nafter, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus while the busy dame\r\nbustled about the house or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the\r\npiazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other,\r\nwatching the achievements of a little wooden warrior who, armed with a\r\nsword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle\r\nof the barn. In the meantime, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the\r\ndaughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering\r\nalong in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover’s eloquence.\r\n\r\nI profess not to know how women’s hearts are wooed and won. To me they\r\nhave always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but\r\none vulnerable point, or door of access, while others have a thousand\r\navenues and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a\r\ngreat triumph of skill to gain the former, but still greater proof\r\nof generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for the man must\r\nbattle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand\r\ncommon hearts is therefore entitled to some renown, but he who keeps\r\nundisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain\r\nit is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from\r\nthe moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former\r\nevidently declined; his horse was no longer seen tied at the palings\r\non Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the\r\npreceptor of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nBrom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have\r\ncarried matters to open warfare, and have settled their pretensions\r\nto the lady according to the mode of those most concise and simple\r\nreasoners, the knights-errant of yore--by single combat; but Ichabod was\r\ntoo conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists\r\nagainst him: he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would “double\r\nthe schoolmaster up and lay him on a shelf of his own school-house;”\r\n and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something\r\nextremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom\r\nno alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his\r\ndisposition and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival.\r\nIchabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang\r\nof rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked\r\nout his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the\r\nschoolhouse at night in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe\r\nand window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy; so that the poor\r\nschoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their\r\nmeetings there. But, what was still more annoying, Brom took all\r\nopportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress,\r\nand had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous\r\nmanner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod’s, to instruct her in\r\npsalmody.\r\n\r\nIn this way, matters went on for some time without producing any\r\nmaterial effect on the relative situation of the contending powers. On\r\na fine autumnal afternoon Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on\r\nthe lofty stool whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little\r\nliterary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic\r\npower; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a\r\nconstant terror to evildoers; while on the desk before him might be\r\nseen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons detected upon\r\nthe persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns,\r\nwhirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper\r\ngamecocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice\r\nrecently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their\r\nbooks or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master,\r\nand a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the school-room.\r\nIt was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth\r\njacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat like the cap of\r\nMercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt,\r\nwhich he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to\r\nthe school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making\r\nor “quilting frolic” to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel’s;\r\nand, having delivered his message with that air of importance and effort\r\nat fine language which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of\r\nthe kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the\r\nhollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.\r\n\r\nAll was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet school-room. The\r\nscholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles;\r\nthose who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who\r\nwere tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear to quicken\r\ntheir speed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside\r\nwithout being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned,\r\nbenches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour\r\nbefore the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young\r\nimps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nThe gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet,\r\nbrushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only, suit of rusty\r\nblack, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that\r\nhung up in the school-house. That he might make his appearance before\r\nhis mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from\r\nthe farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the\r\nname of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like\r\na knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in\r\nthe true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks\r\nand equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a\r\nbroken-down plough-horse that had outlived almost everything but his\r\nviciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck and a head like a\r\nhammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burrs; one\r\neye had lost its pupil and was glaring and spectral, but the other had\r\nthe gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still, he must have had fire and\r\nmettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder.\r\nHe had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master’s, the choleric Van\r\nRipper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of\r\nhis own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken down as he looked,\r\nthere was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIchabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short\r\nstirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle;\r\nhis sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers’; he carried his whip\r\nperpendicularly in his hand like a sceptre; and as his horse jogged on\r\nthe motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A\r\nsmall wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of\r\nforehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out\r\nalmost to his horse’s tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his\r\nsteed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was\r\naltogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day, the sky was clear and\r\nserene, and Nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always\r\nassociate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober\r\nbrown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped\r\nby the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet.\r\nStreaming files of wild-ducks began to make their appearance high in the\r\nair; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech\r\nand hickory nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from\r\nthe neighboring stubble-field.\r\n\r\nThe small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fulness of\r\ntheir revelry they fluttered, chirping and frolicking, from bush to bush\r\nand tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around\r\nthem. There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of stripling\r\nsportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds,\r\nflying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker, with his\r\ncrimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the\r\ncedar-bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little\r\nmonteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his\r\ngay light-blue coat and white under-clothes, screaming and chattering,\r\nbobbing and nodding and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with\r\nevery songster of the grove.\r\n\r\nAs Ichabod jogged slowly on his way his eye, ever open to every symptom\r\nof culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly\r\nAutumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples--some hanging in\r\noppressive opulence on the trees, some gathered into baskets and barrels\r\nfor the market, others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press.\r\nFarther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears\r\npeeping from their leafy coverts and holding out the promise of cakes\r\nand hasty pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning\r\nup their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects\r\nof the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant\r\nbuckwheat-fields, breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld\r\nthem soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well\r\nbuttered and garnished with honey or treacle by the delicate little\r\ndimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.\r\n\r\nThus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and “sugared\r\nsuppositions,” he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which\r\nlook out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun\r\ngradually wheeled his broad disk down into the west. The wide bosom of\r\nthe Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there\r\na gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant\r\nmountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air\r\nto move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually\r\ninto a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the\r\nmid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the\r\nprecipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth\r\nto the dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering\r\nin the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging\r\nuselessly against the mast, and as the reflection of the sky gleamed\r\nalong the still water it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIt was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer\r\nVan Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the\r\nadjacent country--old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun\r\ncoats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter\r\nbuckles; their brisk withered little dames, in close crimped caps,\r\nlong-waisted shortgowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and\r\npincushions and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside; buxom lasses,\r\nalmost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a\r\nfine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation;\r\nthe sons, in short square-skirted coats with rows of stupendous brass\r\nbuttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times,\r\nespecially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose, it being\r\nesteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener\r\nof the hair.\r\n\r\nBrom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the\r\ngathering on his favorite steed Daredevil--a creature, like himself full\r\nof metal and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage. He\r\nwas, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds\r\nof tricks, which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he\r\nheld a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.\r\n\r\nFain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon\r\nthe enraptured gaze of my hero as he entered the state parlor of Van\r\nTassel’s mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses with their\r\nluxurious display of red and white, but the ample charms of a genuine\r\nDutch country tea-table in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped-up\r\nplatters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only\r\nto experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the\r\ntenderer oily koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes\r\nand short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of\r\ncakes. And then there were apple pies and peach pies and pumpkin pies;\r\nbesides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes\r\nof preserved plums and peaches and pears and quinces; not to mention\r\nbroiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and\r\ncream,--all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated\r\nthem, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the\r\nmidst. Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this\r\nbanquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story.\r\nHappily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but\r\ndid ample justice to every dainty.\r\n\r\nHe was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion\r\nas his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with\r\neating as some men’s do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his\r\nlarge eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that\r\nhe might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury\r\nand splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he’d turn his back upon the old\r\nschool-house, snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper and every\r\nother niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors\r\nthat should dare to call him comrade!\r\n\r\nOld Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated\r\nwith content and good-humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His\r\nhospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a\r\nshake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing\r\ninvitation to “fall to and help themselves.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned\r\nto the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed negro who had been the\r\nitinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century.\r\nHis instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of\r\nthe time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement\r\nof the bow with a motion of the head, bowing almost to the ground and\r\nstamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.\r\n\r\nIchabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal\r\npowers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen\r\nhis loosely hung frame in full motion and clattering about the room\r\nyou would have thought Saint Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the\r\ndance, was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all\r\nthe negroes, who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm\r\nand the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at\r\nevery door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their\r\nwhite eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How\r\ncould the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? The\r\nlady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously\r\nin reply to all his amorous oglings, while Brom Bones, sorely smitten\r\nwith love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was at an end Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the\r\nsager folks, who, with old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the\r\npiazza gossiping over former times and drawing out long stories about\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThis neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those\r\nhighly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men.\r\nThe British and American line had run near it during the war; it had\r\ntherefore been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees,\r\ncow-boys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had\r\nelapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little\r\nbecoming fiction, and in the indistinctness of his recollection to make\r\nhimself the hero of every exploit.\r\n\r\nThere was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman,\r\nwho had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder\r\nfrom a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge.\r\nAnd there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich\r\na mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of Whiteplains,\r\nbeing an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small\r\nsword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade and\r\nglance off at the hilt: in proof of which he was ready at any time to\r\nshow the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more\r\nthat had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was\r\npersuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nBut all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that\r\nsucceeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the\r\nkind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered,\r\nlong-settled retreats but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng\r\nthat forms the population of most of our country places. Besides, there\r\nis no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have\r\nscarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in\r\ntheir graves before their surviving friends have travelled away from the\r\nneighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds\r\nthey have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the reason\r\nwhy we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nThe immediate causes however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories\r\nin these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow.\r\nThere was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted\r\nregion; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting\r\nall the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at\r\nVan Tassel’s, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful\r\nlegends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains and mourning\r\ncries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the\r\nunfortunate Major André was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood.\r\nSome mention was made also of the woman in white that haunted the dark\r\nglen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights\r\nbefore a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the\r\nstories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the\r\nheadless horseman, who had been heard several times of late patrolling\r\nthe country, and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the\r\ngraves in the churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a\r\nfavorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll surrounded by\r\nlocust trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent whitewashed\r\nwalls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the\r\nshades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet\r\nof water bordered by high trees, between which peeps may be caught at\r\nthe blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where\r\nthe sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at\r\nleast the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a\r\nwide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and\r\ntrunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far\r\nfrom the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led\r\nto it and the bridge itself were thickly shaded by overhanging trees,\r\nwhich cast a gloom about it even in the daytime, but occasioned a\r\nfearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of\r\nthe headless horseman, and the place where he was most frequently\r\nencountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical\r\ndisbeliever in ghosts, how he met the horseman returning from his foray\r\ninto Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they\r\ngalloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached\r\nthe bridge, when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old\r\nBrouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap\r\nof thunder.\r\n\r\nThis story was immediately matched by a thrice-marvellous adventure of\r\nBrom Bones, who made light of the galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey.\r\nHe affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of\r\nSing-Sing he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had\r\noffered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it\r\ntoo, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they\r\ncame to the church bridge the Hessian bolted and vanished in a flash of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nAll these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in\r\nthe dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving\r\na casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of\r\nIchabod. He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable\r\nauthor, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken\r\nplace in his native state of Connecticut and fearful sights which he had\r\nseen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nThe revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together\r\ntheir families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling\r\nalong the hollow roads and over the distant hills. Some of the\r\ndamsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their\r\nlight-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along\r\nthe silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter until they gradually\r\ndied away, and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and\r\ndeserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of\r\ncountry lovers, to have a tete-a-tete with the heiress, fully convinced\r\nthat he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this\r\ninterview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know.\r\nSomething, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly\r\nsallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate\r\nand chop-fallen. Oh these women! these women! Could that girl have been\r\nplaying off any of her coquettish tricks? Was her encouragement of the\r\npoor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival?\r\nHeaven only knows, not I! Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth\r\nwith the air of one who had been sacking a hen-roost, rather than a fair\r\nlady’s heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene\r\nof rural wealth on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to\r\nthe stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed\r\nmost uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly\r\nsleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats and whole valleys of\r\ntimothy and clover.\r\n\r\nIt was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and\r\ncrestfallen, pursued his travel homewards along the sides of the\r\nlofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so\r\ncheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below\r\nhim the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with\r\nhere and there the tall mast of a sloop riding quietly at anchor under\r\nthe land. In the dead hush of midnight he could even hear the barking of\r\nthe watch-dog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague\r\nand faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful\r\ncompanion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock,\r\naccidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farm-house\r\naway among the hills; but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No\r\nsigns of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp\r\nof a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull-frog from a\r\nneighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in\r\nhis bed.\r\n\r\nAll the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon\r\nnow came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and\r\ndarker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds\r\noccasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and\r\ndismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the\r\nscenes of the ghost-stories had been laid. In the centre of the road\r\nstood an enormous tulip tree which towered like a giant above all the\r\nother trees of the neighborhood and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs\r\nwere gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary\r\ntrees, twisting down almost to the earth and rising again into the air.\r\nIt was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate André, who\r\nhad been taken prisoner hard by, and was universally known by the name\r\nof Major André’s tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of\r\nrespect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its\r\nill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights and\r\ndoleful lamentations told concerning it.\r\n\r\nAs Ichabod approached this fearful tree he began to whistle: he thought\r\nhis whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through\r\nthe dry branches. As he approached a little nearer he thought he saw\r\nsomething white hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased\r\nwhistling, but on looking more narrowly perceived that it was a place\r\nwhere the tree had been scathed by lightning and the white wood laid\r\nbare. Suddenly he heard a groan: his teeth chattered and his knees\r\nsmote against the saddle; it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon\r\nanother as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in\r\nsafety, but new perils lay before him.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed the road and\r\nran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley’s\r\nSwamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over\r\nthis stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood,\r\na group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw\r\na cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial.\r\nIt was at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured,\r\nand under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen\r\nconcealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a\r\nhaunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to\r\npass it alone after dark.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the stream his heart began to thump; he summoned up,\r\nhowever, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the\r\nribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of\r\nstarting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement and\r\nran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the\r\ndelay, jerked the reins on the other side and kicked lustily with the\r\ncontrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but\r\nit was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of\r\nbrambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and\r\nheel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward,\r\nsnuffing and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge with a\r\nsuddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head.\r\nJust at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the\r\nsensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove on the margin\r\nof the brook he beheld something huge, misshapen, black, and towering.\r\nIt stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic\r\nmonster ready to spring upon the traveller.\r\n\r\nThe hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror.\r\nWhat was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides,\r\nwhat chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which\r\ncould ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a\r\nshow of courage, he demanded in stammering accents, “Who are you?”\r\n He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated\r\nvoice. Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides\r\nof the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with\r\ninvoluntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of\r\nalarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at\r\nonce in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal,\r\nyet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained.\r\nHe appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions and mounted on a black\r\nhorse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability,\r\nbut kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side\r\nof old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.\r\n\r\nIchabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and\r\nbethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping\r\nHessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind. The\r\nstranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled\r\nup, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind; the other did the\r\nsame. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his\r\npsalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and\r\nhe could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and\r\ndogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and\r\nappalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising\r\nground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief\r\nagainst the sky, gigantic in height and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was\r\nhorror-struck on perceiving that he was headless! but his horror was\r\nstill more increased on observing that the head, which should have\r\nrested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of the\r\nsaddle. His terror rose to desperation, he rained a shower of kicks and\r\nblows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion\r\nthe slip; but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they\r\ndashed through thick and thin, stones flying and sparks flashing at\r\nevery bound. Ichabod’s flimsy garments fluttered in the air as he\r\nstretched his long lank body away over his horse’s head in the eagerness\r\nof his flight.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but\r\nGunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it,\r\nmade an opposite turn and plunged headlong down hill to the left. This\r\nroad leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter\r\nof a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story, and just\r\nbeyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.\r\n\r\nAs yet the panic of the steed had given his unskillful rider an apparent\r\nadvantage in the chase; but just as he had got halfway through the\r\nhollow the girths of the saddle gave away and he felt it slipping from\r\nunder him. He seized it by the pommel and endeavored to hold it firm,\r\nbut in vain, and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder\r\nround the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it\r\ntrampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van\r\nRipper’s wrath passed across his mind, for it was his Sunday saddle; but\r\nthis was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches,\r\nand (unskilled rider that he was) he had much ado to maintain his seat,\r\nsometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes\r\njolted on the high ridge of his horse’s back-bone with a violence that\r\nhe verily feared would cleave him asunder.\r\n\r\nAn opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church\r\nbridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the\r\nbosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls\r\nof the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the\r\nplace where Brom Bones’ ghostly competitor had disappeared. “If I can\r\nbut reach that bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just then he heard\r\nthe black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied\r\nthat he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and\r\nold Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding\r\nplanks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind\r\nto see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of\r\nfire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups,\r\nand in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to\r\ndodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium\r\nwith a tremendous crash; he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and\r\nGunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider passed by like a\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the old horse was found, without his saddle and with\r\nthe bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master’s\r\ngate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour\r\ncame, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the school-house and\r\nstrolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans\r\nVan Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor\r\nIchabod and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent\r\ninvestigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading\r\nto the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of\r\nhorses’ hoofs, deeply dented in the road and evidently at furious speed,\r\nwere traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of\r\nthe brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the\r\nunfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a spattered pumpkin.\r\n\r\nThe brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be\r\ndiscovered. Hans Van Ripper, as executor of his estate, examined the\r\nbundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two\r\nshirts and a half, two stocks for the neck, a pair or two of worsted\r\nstockings, an old pair of corduroy small-clothes, a rusty razor, a book\r\nof psalm tunes full of dog’s ears, and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the\r\nbooks and furniture of the school-house, they belonged to the community,\r\nexcepting Cotton Mather’s History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanac,\r\nand a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of\r\nfoolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to\r\nmake a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic\r\nbooks and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames\r\nby Hans Van Ripper, who from that time forward determined to send his\r\nchildren no more to school, observing that he never knew any good\r\ncome of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster\r\npossessed--and he had received his quarter’s pay but a day or\r\ntwo before--he must have had about his person at the time of his\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the\r\nfollowing Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the\r\nchurchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin\r\nhad been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of\r\nothers were called to mind, and when they had diligently considered them\r\nall, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook\r\ntheir heads and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried\r\noff by the galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor and in nobody’s debt,\r\nnobody troubled his head any more about him, the school was removed to\r\na different quarter of the hollow and another pedagogue reigned in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\nIt is true an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit\r\nseveral years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure\r\nwas received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still\r\nalive; that he had left the neighborhood, partly through fear of the\r\ngoblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been\r\nsuddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a\r\ndistant part of the country, had kept school and studied law at the same\r\ntime, had been admitted to the bar, turned politician, electioneered,\r\nwritten for the newspapers, and finally had been made a justice of\r\nthe Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones too, who shortly after his rival’s\r\ndisappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar,\r\nwas observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod\r\nwas related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the\r\npumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter\r\nthan he chose to tell.\r\n\r\nThe old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these\r\nmatters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by\r\nsupernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the\r\nneighborhood round the intervening fire. The bridge became more than\r\never an object of superstitious awe, and that may be the reason why the\r\nroad has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the\r\nborder of the mill-pond. The schoolhouse, being deserted, soon fell to\r\ndecay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate\r\npedagogue; and the plough-boy, loitering homeward of a still summer\r\nevening, has often fancied his voice at a distance chanting a melancholy\r\npsalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\nFOUND IN THE HANDWRITING OF MR. KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\nTHE preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which I heard\r\nit related at a Corporation meeting of the ancient city of Manhattoes,\r\nat which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers.\r\nThe narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow in\r\npepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humorous face, and one whom\r\nI strongly suspected of being poor, he made such efforts to be\r\nentertaining. When his story was concluded there was much laughter and\r\napprobation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen who had\r\nbeen asleep the greater part of the time. There was, however, one tall,\r\ndry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a\r\ngrave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his arms,\r\ninclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a\r\ndoubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but\r\nupon good grounds--when they have reason and the law on their side.\r\nWhen the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided and silence was\r\nrestored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and sticking the\r\nother akimbo, demanded, with a slight but exceedingly sage motion of the\r\nhead and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story and\r\nwhat it went to prove.\r\n\r\nThe story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips as a\r\nrefreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer\r\nwith an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the\r\ntable, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove--\r\n\r\n“That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and\r\npleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it;\r\n\r\n“That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to\r\nhave rough riding of it.\r\n\r\n“Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch\r\nheiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.”\r\n\r\nThe cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this\r\nexplanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism,\r\nwhile methought the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a\r\ntriumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was very well, but\r\nstill he thought the story a little on the extravagant--there were one\r\nor two points on which he had his doubts.\r\n\r\n“Faith, sir,” replied the story-teller, “as to that matter, I don’t\r\nbelieve one-half of it myself.”\r\n\r\nD. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL’ENVOY.*\r\n\r\n    Go, little booke, God send thee good passage,\r\n    And specially let this be thy prayere,\r\n    Unto them all that thee will read or hear,\r\n    Where thou art wrong, after their help to call,\r\n    Thee to correct in any part or all.\r\n                  CHAUCER’S Belle Dame sans Mercie.\r\n\r\nIN concluding a second volume of the Sketch Book the Author cannot but\r\nexpress his deep sense of the indulgence with which his first has been\r\nreceived, and of the liberal disposition that has been evinced to treat\r\nhim with kindness as a stranger. Even the critics, whatever may be\r\nsaid of them by others, he has found to be a singularly gentle and\r\ngood-natured race; it is true that each has in turn objected to some\r\none or two articles, and that these individual exceptions, taken in the\r\naggregate, would amount almost to a total condemnation of his work; but\r\nthen he has been consoled by observing that what one has particularly\r\ncensured another has as particularly praised; and thus, the encomiums\r\nbeing set off against the objections, he finds his work, upon the whole,\r\ncommended far beyond its deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Closing the second volume of the London edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is aware that he runs a risk of forfeiting much of this kind favor by\r\nnot following the counsel that has been liberally bestowed upon him; for\r\nwhere abundance of valuable advice is given gratis it may seem a man’s\r\nown fault if he should go astray. He only can say in his vindication\r\nthat he faithfully determined for a time to govern himself in his second\r\nvolume by the opinions passed upon his first; but he was soon brought to\r\na stand by the contrariety of excellent counsel. One kindly advised him\r\nto avoid the ludicrous; another to shun the pathetic; a third assured\r\nhim that he was tolerable at description, but cautioned him to leave\r\nnarrative alone; while a fourth declared that he had a very pretty knack\r\nat turning a story, and was really entertaining when in a pensive mood,\r\nbut was grievously mistaken if he imagined himself to possess a spirit\r\nof humor.\r\n\r\nThus perplexed by the advice of his friends, who each in turn closed\r\nsome particular path, but left him all the world beside to range in,\r\nhe found that to follow all their counsels would, in fact, be to stand\r\nstill. He remained for a time sadly embarrassed, when all at once the\r\nthought struck him to ramble on as he had begun; that his work being\r\nmiscellaneous and written for different humors, it could not be expected\r\nthat any one would be pleased with the whole; but that if it should\r\ncontain something to suit each reader, his end would be completely\r\nanswered. Few guests sit down to a varied table with an equal appetite\r\nfor every dish. One has an elegant horror of a roasted pig; another\r\nholds a curry or a devil in utter abomination; a third cannot tolerate\r\nthe ancient flavor of venison and wild-fowl; and a fourth, of truly\r\nmasculine stomach, looks with sovereign contempt on those knick-knacks\r\nhere and there dished up for the ladies. Thus each article is in\r\ncondemned in its turn, and yet amidst this variety of appetites seldom\r\ndoes a dish go away from the table without being tasted and relished by\r\nsome one or other of the guests.\r\n\r\nWith these considerations he ventures to serve up this second volume in\r\nthe same heterogeneous way with his first; simply requesting the reader,\r\nif he should find here and there something to please him, to rest\r\nassured that it was written expressly for intelligent readers like\r\nhimself; but entreating him, should he find anything to dislike, to\r\ntolerate it, as one of those articles which the author has been obliged\r\nto write for readers of a less refined taste.\r\n\r\nTo be serious: The author is conscious of the numerous faults and\r\nimperfections of his work, and well aware how little he is disciplined\r\nand accomplished in the arts of authorship. His deficiencies are also\r\nincreased by a diffidence arising from his peculiar situation. He finds\r\nhimself writing in a strange land, and appearing before a public\r\nwhich he has been accustomed from childhood to regard with the highest\r\nfeelings of awe and reverence. He is full of solicitude to deserve their\r\napprobation, yet finds that very solicitude continually embarrassing his\r\npowers and depriving him of that case and confidence which are necessary\r\nto successful exertion. Still, the kindness with which he is treated\r\nencourages him to go on, hoping that in time he may acquire a steadier\r\nfooting; and thus he proceeds, half venturing, half shrinking, surprised\r\nat his own good-fortune and wondering at his own temerity.",
