There are those that stand for higher\r\nachievement in literature, science and art, in public life and in\r\nthe business world. There is none that stands for more notable\r\nsuccess in his chosen line, none that recalls more memories of\r\nwholesome entertainment, none that is more invested with the\r\nfragrance of kindliness and true humanity. His career was, in a\r\nlarge sense, typical of genuine Americanism, of its enterprise\r\nand pluck, of its indomitable will and unfailing courage, of its\r\nshrewdness, audacity and unerring instinct for success.\r\n\r\nLike so many of his famous compatriots, Phineas Taylor Barnum\r\ncame of good old New England stock. His ancestors were among the\r\nbuilders of the colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut. His\r\nfather's father, Ephraim Barnum, was a captain in the War of the\r\nRevolution, and was distinguished for his valor and for his\r\nfervent patriotism. His mother's father, Phineas Taylor, was\r\nlocally noted as a wag and practical joker. His father, Philo\r\nBarnum, was in turn a tailor, a farmer, a storekeeper, and a\r\ncountry tavernkeeper, and was not particularly prosperous in any\r\nof these callings.\r\n\r\nPhilo Barnum and his wife, Irena Taylor, lived at Bethel,\r\nConnecticut, and there, on July 5, 1810, their first child was\r\nborn. He was named Phineas Taylor Barnum, after his maternal\r\ngrandfather; and the latter, in return for the compliment,\r\nbestowed upon his first grandchild at his christening the\r\ntitle-deeds of a \"landed estate,\" five acres in extent, known as\r\nIvy Island, and situated in that part of, Bethel known as the\r\n\"Plum Trees.\" Of this, more anon.\r\n\r\nIn his early years the boy led the life of the average New\r\nEngland farmer's son of that period. He drove the cows to and\r\nfrom the pasture, shelled corn, weeded the garden, and \"did up\r\nchores.\" As he grew older he rode the horse in plowing corn,\r\nraked hay, wielded the shovel and the hoe, and chopped wood. At\r\nsix years old he began to go to school--the typical district\r\nschool. \"The first date,\" he once said, \"I remember inscribing\r\nupon my writing-book was 1818.\" The ferule, or the birch-rod, was\r\nin those days the assistant schoolmaster, and young Barnum made\r\nits acquaintance. He was, however, an apt and ready scholar,\r\nparticularly excelling in mathematics. One night, when he was ten\r\nyears old, he was called out of bed by his teacher, who had made\r\na wager with a neighbor that Barnum could calculate the number of\r\nfeet in a load of wood in five minutes. Barnum did it in less\r\nthan two minutes, to the delight of his teacher and the\r\nastonishment of the neighbor.\r\n\r\nAt an early age he manifested a strong development of the good\r\nold Yankee organ of acquisitiveness. Before he was five years old\r\nhe had begun to hoard pennies and \"fourpences,\" and at six years\r\nold he was able to exchange his copper bits for a whole silver\r\ndollar, the possession of which made him feel richer than he ever\r\nfelt afterward in all his life. Nor did he lay the dollar away in\r\na napkin, but used it in business to gain more. He would get ten\r\ncents a day for riding a horse before the plow, and he would add\r\nit to his capital. On holidays other boys spent all their\r\nsavings, but not so he. Such days were to him opportunities for\r\ngain, not for squandering. At the fair or training of troops, or\r\nother festivity, he would peddle candy and cakes, home-made, or\r\nsometimes cherry rum, and by the end of the day would be a dollar\r\nor two richer than at its beginning. \"By the time I was twelve\r\nyears old,\" he tells us, \"I was the owner of a sheep and a calf,\r\nand should soon, no doubt, have become a small Croesus had not my\r\nfather kindly permitted me to purchase my own clothing, which\r\nsomewhat reduced my little store.\"\r\n\r\nAt ten years of age, realizing himself to be a \"landed\r\nproprietor\" through the christening gift of his waggish\r\ngrandsire, young Barnum set out to survey his estate, which he\r\nhad not yet seen. He had heard much of \"Ivy Island.\" His\r\ngrandfather had often, in the presence of the neighbors, spoken\r\nof him as the richest child in the town, since he owned the whole\r\nof Ivy Island, the richest farm in the State. His parents hoped\r\nhe would use his wealth wisely, and \"do something for the family\"\r\nwhen he entered upon the possession of it; and the neighbors were\r\nfearful lest he should grow too proud to associate with their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe boy took all this in good faith, and his eager curiosity to\r\nbehold his estate was greatly increased, and he asked his father\r\nto let him go thither. \"At last,\" says Barnum, \"he promised I\r\nshould do so in a few days, as we should be getting some hay near\r\n'Ivy Island.' The wished-for day arrived, and my father told me\r\nthat as we were to mow an adjoining meadow. I might visit my\r\nproperty in company with the hired man during the 'nooning.' My\r\ngrandfather reminded me that it was to his bounty I was indebted\r\nfor this wealth, and that had not my name been Phineas I might\r\nnever have been proprietor of 'Ivy Island.' To this my mother\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\" 'Now, Taylor, don't become so excited when you see your\r\nproperty as to let your joy make you sick, for remember, rich as\r\nyou are, that it will be eleven years before you can come into\r\npossession of your fortune.'\r\n\r\n\"She added much more good advice, to all of which I promised to\r\nbe calm and reasonable, and not to allow my pride to prevent me\r\nfrom speaking to my brothers and sisters when I returned home.\r\n\r\n\"When we arrived at the meadow, which was in that part of the\r\n'Plum Trees' known as 'East Swamp,' I asked my father where 'Ivy\r\nIsland' was.\r\n\r\n\" 'Yonder, at the north end of this meadow, where you see those\r\nbeautiful trees rising in the distance.'\r\n\r\n\"All the forenoon I turned grass as fast as two men could cut it,\r\nand after a hasty repast at noon, one of our hired men, a\r\ngood-natured Irishman, named Edmund, took an axe on his shoulder\r\nand announced that he was ready to accompany me to 'Ivy Island.'\r\nWe started, and as we approached the north end of the meadow we\r\nfound the ground swampy and wet and were soon obliged to leap\r\nfrom bog to bog on our route. A mis-step brought me up to my\r\nmiddle in water, and to add to the dilemma a swarm of hornets\r\nattacked me. Attaining the altitude of another bog I was cheered\r\nby the assurance that there was only a quarter of a mile of this\r\nkind of travel to the edge of my property. I waded on. In about\r\nfifteen minutes more, after floundering through the morass, I\r\nfound myself half-drowned, hornet-stung, mud covered, and out of\r\nbreath, on comparatively dry land.\r\n\r\n\" 'Never mind, my boy,' said Edmund, 'we have only to cross this\r\nlittle creek, and ye'll be upon your own valuable property.'\r\n\r\n\"We were on the margin of a stream, the banks of which were\r\nthickly covered with alders. I now discovered the use of Edmund's\r\naxe, for he felled a small oak to form a temporary bridge to my\r\n'Island' property. Crossing over, I proceeded to the centre of my\r\ndomain. I saw nothing but a few stunted ivies and straggling\r\ntrees. The truth flashed upon me. I had been the laughing-stock\r\nof the family and neighborhood for years. My valuable 'Ivy\r\nIsland' was an almost inaccessible, worthless bit of barren land,\r\nand while I stood deploring my sudden downfall, a huge black\r\nsnake (one of my tenants) approached me with upraised head. I\r\ngave one shriek and rushed for the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"This was my first and last visit to 'Ivy Island.' My father\r\nasked me 'how I liked my property?' and I responded that I would\r\nsell it pretty cheap.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1822 was a memorable one in his childhood's history. He\r\nwas then about twelve years old. One evening, late in January,\r\nDaniel Brown, a cattle-drover, of Southbury, Connecticut, arrived\r\nat Bethel and stopped for the night at Philo Barnum's tavern. He\r\nhad with him some fat cattle, which he was driving to the New\r\nYork markets; and he wanted both to add to his drove of cattle\r\nand to get a boy to help him drive them. Our juvenile hero heard\r\nhim say this, and forthwith made application for the job. His\r\nfather and mother gave their consent, and a bargain was quickly\r\nclosed with the drover.\r\n\r\n\"At daylight next morning,\" Barnum himself has related, \"I\r\nstarted on foot in the midst of a heavy snow-storm to help drive\r\nthe cattle. Before reaching Ridgefield I was sent on horseback\r\nafter a stray ox, and, in galloping, the horse fell and my ankle\r\nwas sprained. I suffered severely, but did not complain lest my\r\nemployer should send me back. We arrived at New York in three or\r\nfour days, and put up at the Bull's Head Tavern, where we were to\r\nstay a week while the drover disposed of his cattle. It was an\r\neventful week for me. Before I left home my mother had given me a\r\ndollar, which I supposed would supply every want that heart could\r\nwish.\"\r\n\r\nHis first outlay was for oranges. \"I was told,\" he says, \"that\r\nthey were four pence apiece, and as four pence in Connecticut was\r\nsix cents, I offered ten cents for two oranges, which was of\r\ncourse readily taken; and thus, instead of saving two cents, as I\r\nthought, I actually paid two cents more than the price demanded.\r\nI then bought two more oranges, reducing my capital to eighty\r\ncents. Thirty-one cents was the charge for a small gun which\r\nwould 'go off' and send a stick some little distance, and this\r\ngun I bought. Amusing myself with this toy in the bar-room of the\r\nBull's Head, the arrow happened to hit the bar-keeper, who\r\nforthwith came from behind the counter and shook me, and soundly\r\nboxed my ears, telling me to put that gun out of the way or he\r\nwould put it into the fire. I sneaked to my room, put my treasure\r\nunder the pillow, and went out for another visit to the toy shop.\r\n\r\n\"There I invested six cents in 'torpedoes,' with which I intended\r\nto astonish my schoolmates in Bethel. I could not refrain,\r\nhowever, from experimenting upon the guests of the hotel, which I\r\ndid when they were going in to dinner. I threw two of the\r\ntorpedoes against the wall of the hall through which the guests\r\nwere passing, and the immediate results were as follows: two loud\r\nreports--astonished guests--irate landlord--discovery of the\r\nculprit, and summary punishment--for the landlord immediately\r\nfloored me with a single blow with his open hand, and said:\r\n\r\n\" 'There, you little greenhorn, see if that will teach you better\r\nthan to explode your infernal fire-crackers in my house again.'\r\n\r\n\"The lesson was sufficient if not entirely satisfactory. I\r\ndeposited the balance of the torpedoes with my gun, and as a\r\nsolace for my wounded feelings I again visited the toy shop,\r\nwhere I bought a watch, breastpin and top, leaving but eleven\r\ncents of my original dollar.\r\n\r\n\"The following morning found me again at the fascinating toy\r\nshop, where I saw a beautiful knife with two blades, a gimlet,\r\nand a corkscrew--a whole carpenter shop in miniature, and all for\r\nthirty-one cents. But, alas! I had only eleven cents. Have that\r\nknife I must, however, and so I proposed to the shop-woman to\r\ntake back the top and breastpin at a slight deduction, and with\r\nmy eleven cents to let me have the knife. The kind creature\r\nconsented, and this makes memorable my first 'swap.' Some fine\r\nand nearly white molasses candy then caught my eye, and I\r\nproposed to trade the watch for its equivalent in candy. The\r\ntransaction was made, and the candy was so delicious that before\r\nnight my gun was absorbed in the same way. The next morning the\r\ntorpedoes 'went off' in the same direction, and before night even\r\nmy beloved knife was similarly exchanged. My money and my goods\r\nall gone, I traded two pocket-handkerchiefs and an extra pair of\r\nstockings I was sure I should not want for nine more rolls of\r\nmolasses candy, and then wandered about the city disconsolate,\r\nsighing because there was no more molasses candy to conquer.\"\r\n\r\nDuring that first visit to the metropolis the boy doubtless many\r\ntimes passed the corner of Ann street and Broadway, where, in\r\nafter years, his famous museum stood. After a week in town he\r\nreturned to Bethel, riding with Brown in his sleigh, and found\r\nhimself a social lion among his young friends. He was plied with\r\na thousand questions about the great city which he had visited,\r\nand no doubt told many wondrous tales. But at home his reception\r\nwas not altogether glorious. His brothers and sisters were\r\ndisappointed because he brought them nothing, and his mother,\r\ndiscovering that during his journey he had lost two handkerchiefs\r\nand a pair of stockings, gave him a spanking and put him to bed.\r\n\r\nA settled aversion to manual labor was strongly developed in the\r\nboy as he grew older, which his father considered simple\r\nlaziness. Instead of trying to cure him of his laziness, however,\r\nthe father decided to give up the farm, and open a store, hoping\r\nthat the boy would take more kindly to mercantile duties. So he\r\nput up a building in Bethel, and in partnership with one Hiram\r\nWeed opened a \"general store,\" of dry goods, hardware, groceries,\r\netc., and installed young Phineas as clerk. They did a \"cash,\r\ncredit and barter\" business, and the boy soon learned to drive\r\nsharp bargains with women who brought butter, eggs, beeswax and\r\nfeathers to exchange for dry goods, and with men who wanted to\r\ntrade oats, corn, buckwheat, axehelves, hats and other\r\ncommodities for ten-penny nails, molasses or New England rum. It\r\nwas a drawback upon his dignity that he was obliged to take down\r\nthe shutters, sweep the store and make the fire. He received a\r\nsmall salary for his services and the perquisites of what profit\r\nhe could derive from purchasing candies on his own account to\r\nsell to their younger customers, and, as usual, his father\r\ninsisted that he should clothe himself.\r\n\r\nThere was much to be learned in a country store, and principally,\r\nas he found, this: that sharp tricks, deception and dishonesty\r\nare by no means confined to the city. More than once, in cutting\r\nopen bundles of rags, brought to be exchanged for goods, he found\r\nstones, gravel or other rubbish wrapped up in them, although they\r\nwere represented to be \"all pure linen or cotton.\" Often, too,\r\nloads of grain were brought in, warranted to contain so many\r\nbushels, but on measuring them they were found five or six\r\nbushels short.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings and on stormy days the store was a general\r\nmeeting place for the idlers of the village, and young Barnum\r\nderived much amusement from the story-telling and joke-playing\r\nthat went on among them. After the store was closed at night he\r\nwould generally go with some of the village boys to their homes\r\nfor an hour or two of sport, and then, as late, perhaps, as\r\neleven o'clock, would creep slyly home and make his way upstairs\r\nbarefooted, so as not to wake the rest of the family end be\r\ndetected in his late hours. He slept with his brother, who was\r\nsure to report him if he woke him up on coming in, and who laid\r\nmany traps to catch Phineas on his return from the evening's\r\nmerry-making. But he generally fell fast asleep and our hero was\r\nable to gain his bed in safety.\r\n\r\nLike almost every one in Connecticut at that time he was brought\r\nup to go regularly to church on Sunday, and before he could read\r\nhe was a prominent member of the Sunday-school. His pious mother\r\ntaught him lessons in the New Testament and Catechism, and spared\r\nno efforts to have him win one of those \"Rewards of Merit\" which\r\npromised \"to pay to the bearer One Mill.\" Ten of them could be\r\nexchanged for one cent, and by securing one hundred of them,\r\nwhich might be done by faithful attendance and attention every\r\nSunday for two years, the happy scholar could secure a book worth\r\nten cents!\r\n\r\nThere was only one church or \"meeting-house\" in Bethel, and it\r\nwas of the Presbyterian faith; but every one in town attended it,\r\nwhatever their creed. It was a severely plain edifice, with no\r\nspire and no bell. In summer it was comfortable enough, but in\r\nwinter it was awful! There was no arrangement for heating it, and\r\nthe congregation had to sit in the cold, shivering, teeth\r\nchattering, noses blue. A stove would have been looked upon as a\r\nsacrilegious innovation. The sermons were often two hours long,\r\nand by the time they were ended the faithful listeners well\r\ndeserved the nickname of \"blue-skins\" which the scoffers gave to\r\nthem. A few of the wealthier women carried \"foot-stoves\" from\r\ntheir homes to their pews. A \"foot-stove\" was simply a square tin\r\nbox in a wooden frame, with perforations in the sides. In it was\r\na small square iron dish, which contained a few live coals\r\ncovered with ashes. These stoves were usually replenished just\r\nbefore meeting time at some neighbor's near the meeting-house.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of shivering and suffering, one of the brethren\r\nhad the temerity to propose that the church should be warmed with\r\na stove. His impious proposition was voted down by an\r\noverwhelming majority. Another year came around, and in November\r\nthe stove question was again brought up. The excitement was\r\nimmense. The subject was discussed in the village stores and in\r\nthe juvenile debating club; it was prayed over in conference; and\r\nfinally in general \"society's meeting,\" in December, the stove\r\nwas carried by a majority of one and was introduced into the\r\nmeeting-house. On the first Sunday thereafter two ancient maiden\r\nladies were so oppressed by the dry and heated atmosphere\r\noccasioned by the wicked innovation that they fainted away and\r\nwere carried out into the cool air, where they speedily returned\r\nto consciousness, especially when they were informed that owing\r\nto the lack of two lengths of pipe no fire had yet been made in\r\nthe stove. The next Sunday was a bitter cold day, and the stove,\r\nfilled with well-seasoned hickory, was a great gratification to\r\nthe many, and displeased only a few.\r\n\r\nDuring the Rev. Mr. Lowe's ministrations at Bethel he formed a\r\nBible class, of which young Barnum was a member. They used to\r\ndraw promiscuously from a hat a text of Scripture and write a\r\ncomposition on the text, which compositions were read after\r\nservice in the afternoon to such of the congregation as remained\r\nto hear the exercises of the class. Once Barnum drew the text,\r\nLuke x. 42: \"But one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that\r\ngood part which shall not be taken away from her.\" Question,\r\n\"What is the one thing needful?\" His answer was nearly as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"This question, 'What is the one thing needful?' is capable of\r\nreceiving various answers, depending much upon the persons to\r\nwhom it is addressed. The merchant might answer that 'the one\r\nthing needful' is plenty of customers, who buy liberally, without\r\nbeating down, and pay cash for all their purchases.' The farmer\r\nmight reply that 'the one thing needful is large harvests and\r\nhigh prices.' The physician might answer that 'it is plenty of\r\npatients.' The lawyer might be of opinion that 'it is an unruly\r\ncommunity, always engaging in bickerings and litigations.' The\r\nclergyman might reply, 'It is a fat salary, with multitudes of\r\nsinners seeking salvation and paying large pew rents.' The\r\nbachelor might exclaim, 'It is a pretty wife who loves her\r\nhusband, and who knows how to sew on buttons.' The maiden might\r\nanswer, 'It is a good husband, who will love, cherish and protect\r\nme while life shall last.' But the most proper answer, and\r\ndoubtless that which applied to the case of Mary, would be, 'The\r\none thing needful is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, follow\r\nin his footsteps, love God and obey His commandments, love our\r\nfellowman, and embrace every opportunity of administering to his\r\nnecessities.' In short, 'the one thing needful' is to live a life\r\nthat we can always look back upon with satisfaction, and be\r\nenabled ever to contemplate its termination with trust in Him who\r\nhas so kindly vouchsafed it to us, surrounding us with\r\ninnumerable blessings, if we have but the heart and wisdom to\r\nreceive them in a proper manner.\"\r\n\r\nThe reading of a portion of this answer occasioned some amusement\r\nin the congregation, in which the clergyman himself joined, and\r\nthe name of \"Taylor Barnum\" was whispered in connection with the\r\ncomposition; but at the close of the reading Barnum had the\r\nsatisfaction of hearing Mr. Lowe say that it was a well-written\r\nanswer to the question, \"What is the one thing needful?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. EARLY YEARS AT BETHEL.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF HIS GRANDMOTHER AND FATHER--LEFT PENNILESS AND\r\nBAREFOOTED--WORK IN A STORE--HIS FIRST LOVE--TRYING TO BUY\r\nRUSSIA--UNCLE BIBBIN'S DUEL.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1825, the aged grandmother met with an accident in\r\nstepping on the point of a rusty nail, which shortly afterwards\r\nresulted in her death. She was a woman of great piety, and before\r\nshe died sent for each of her grandchildren--to whom she was\r\ndevoted--and besought them to lead a Christian life. Barnum was\r\nso deeply impressed by that death-bed scene that through his\r\nwhole life neither the recollection of it, nor of the dying\r\nwoman's words, ever left him.\r\n\r\nThe elder Barnum was a man of many enterprises and few successes.\r\nBesides being the proprietor of a hotel he owned a livery-stable,\r\nran a sort of an express, and kept a country store. Phineas was\r\nhis confidential clerk, and, if he did not reap much financial\r\nbenefit from his position, he at least obtained a good business\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, 1825, the father, after a six months'\r\nillness, died at the age of forty-eight, leaving a wife and five\r\nchildren and an insolvent estate. There was literally nothing\r\nleft for the family; the creditors seized everything; even the\r\nsmall sum which Phineas had loaned his father was held to be the\r\nproperty of a minor, and therefore belonging to the estate. The\r\nboy was obliged to borrow money to buy the shoes he wore to the\r\nfuneral. At fifteen he began the world not only penniless but\r\nbarefooted.\r\n\r\nHe went at once to Grassy Plain, a few miles northwest of Bethel,\r\nwhere he managed to obtain a clerkship in the store of James S.\r\nKeeler and Lewis Whitlock, at the magnificent salary of six\r\ndollars a month and his board. He had chosen his uncle, Alanson\r\nTaylor, as his guardian, but made his home with Mrs. Jerusha\r\nWheeler and her two daughters; Mary and Jerusha. He worked hard\r\nand faithfully, and so gained the esteem of his employers that\r\nthey afforded him many opportunities for making money on his own\r\naccount. His small speculations proved so successful that before\r\nlong he found himself in possession of quite a little sum.\r\n\r\n\"I made,\" says Barnum, \"a very remarkable trade at one time for\r\nmy employers by purchasing, in their absence, a whole wagon-load\r\nof green glass bottles of various sizes, for which I paid in\r\nunsalable goods at very profitable prices. How to dispose of the\r\nbottles was then the problem, and as it was also desirable to get\r\nrid of a large quantity of tin-ware which had been in the shop\r\nfor years and was con-siderably 'shop worn,' I conceived the idea\r\nof a lottery, in which the highest prize should be twenty-five\r\ndollars, payable in any goods the winner desired, while there\r\nwere to be fifty prizes of five dollars each, payable in goods,\r\nto be designated in the scheme. Then there were one hundred\r\nprizes of one dollar each, one hundred prizes of fifty cents\r\neach, and three hundred prizes of twenty-five cents each. It is\r\nunnecessary to state that the minor prizes consisted mainly of\r\nglass and tin-ware; the tickets sold like wildfire, and the worn\r\ntin and glass bottles were speedily turned into cash.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Barnum still continued to keep the village hotel at Bethel,\r\nand Phineas went home every Saturday night, going to church with\r\nhis mother on Sunday, and returning to his work Monday morning.\r\nOne Saturday evening Miss Mary Wheeler, at whose house the young\r\nman boarded, sent him word that she had a young lady from Bethel\r\nwhom she desired him to escort home, as it was raining violently,\r\nand the maiden was afraid to go alone. He assented readily\r\nenough, and went over to \"Aunt Rushia's,\" where he was introduced\r\nto Miss Charity (\"Chairy,\" for short) Hallett. She was a very\r\npretty girl and a bright talker, and the way home seemed only too\r\nshort to her escort. She was a tailoress in the village, and went\r\nto church regularly, but, although Phineas saw her every Sunday\r\nfor many weeks, he had no opportunity of the acquaintance that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jerusha Wheeler and her daughter Jerusha were familiarly\r\nknown, the one as \"Aunt Rushia,\" and the other as \"Rushia.\" Many\r\nof the store customers were hatters, and among the many kinds of\r\nfurs sold for the nap of hats was one known to the trade as\r\n\"Russia.\" One day a hatter, Walter Dibble, called to buy some\r\nfurs. Barnum sold him several kinds, including \"beaver\" and\r\n\"cony,\" and he then asked for some \"Russia.\" They had none, and\r\nas Barnum wanted to play a joke upon him, he told him that Mrs.\r\nWheeler had several hundred pounds of \"Rushia.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is a woman doing with 'Russia?' \" said he.\r\n\r\nBarnum could not answer, but assured him that there were one\r\nhundred and thirty pounds of old Rushia and one hundred and fifty\r\npounds of young Rushia in Mrs. Wheeler's house, and under her\r\ncharge, but whether or not it was for sale he could not say. Off\r\nhe started to make the purchase and knocked at the door. Mrs.\r\nWheeler, the elder, made her appearance.\r\n\r\n\"I want to get your Russia,\" said the hatter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wheeler asked him to walk in and be seated. She, of course,\r\nsupposed that he had come for her daughter \"Rushia.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want of Rushia?\" asked the old lady.\r\n\r\n\"To make hats,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"To trim hats, I suppose you mean?\" responded Mrs. Wheeler.\r\n\r\n\"No, for the outside of hats,\" replied the hatter.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know much about hats,\" said the old lady, \"but I\r\nwill call my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nPassing into another room where \"Rushia\" the younger was at work,\r\nshe informed her that a man wanted her to make hats.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he means sister Mary, probably. I suppose he wants some\r\nladies' hats,\" replied Rushia, as she went into the parlor.\r\n\r\n\"This is my daughter,\" said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\"I want to get your Russia,\" said he, addressing the young lady.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you wish to see my sister Mary; she is our milliner,\"\r\nsaid young Rushia.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to see whoever owns the property,\" said the hatter.\r\n\r\nSister Mary was sent for, and, as she was introduced, the hatter\r\ninformed her that he wished to buy her \"Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Buy Rushia!\" exclaimed Mary, in surprise; I don't understand\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your name is Miss Wheeler, I believe,\" said the hatter, who was\r\nannoyed by the difficulty he met with in being understood.\r\n\r\n\"It is, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! very well. Is there old and young Russia in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe there is,\" said Mary, surprised at the familiar manner\r\nin which he spoke of her mother and sister, who were present.\r\n\r\n\"What is the price of old Russia per pound?\" asked the hatter.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, sir, that old Rushia is not for sale,\" replied Mary,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you ask for young Russia?\" pursued the hatter.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Miss Rushia the younger, springing to her feet, \"do\r\nyou come here to insult defenceless females? If you do, sir, our\r\nbrother, who is in the garden, will punish you as you deserve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ladies!\" exclaimed the hatter, in astonishment, \"what on earth\r\nhave I done to offend you? I came here on a business matter. I\r\nwant to buy some Russia. I was told you had old and young Russia\r\nin the house. Indeed, this young lady just stated such to be the\r\nfact, but she says the old Russia is not for sale. Now, if I can\r\nbuy the young Russia I want to do so--but if that can't be done,\r\nplease to say so, and I will trouble you no further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, open the door and let this man go out; he is undoubtedly\r\ncrazy,\" said Miss Mary.\r\n\r\n\"By thunder! I believe I shall be if I remain here long,\"\r\nexclaimed the hatter, considerably excited. \"I wonder if folks\r\nnever do business in these parts, that you think a man is crazy\r\nif he attempts such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Business! poor man!\" said Mary soothingly, approaching the door.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a poor man, madam,\" replied the hatter. \"My name is\r\nWalter Dibble; I carry on hatting extensively in Danbury; I came\r\nto Grassy Plain to buy fur, and have purchased some 'beaver' and\r\n'cony,' and now it seems I am to be called 'crazy' and a 'poor\r\nman,' because I want to buy a little 'Russia' to make up my\r\nassortment.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies began to open their eyes; they saw that Mr. Dibble was\r\nquite in earnest, and his explanation threw considerable light\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Who sent you here?\" asked sister Mary.\r\n\r\n\"The clerk at the opposite store,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"He is a wicked young fellow for making all this trouble,\" said\r\nthe old lady; \"he has been doing this for a joke.\"\r\n\r\n\"A joke!\" exclaimed Dibble, in surprise, \"have you no Russia,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Jerusha, and so is my daughter's,\" said Mrs. Wheeler,\r\n\"and that, I suppose, is what he meant by telling you of old and\r\nyoung Rushia.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dibble, without more words, left the house and made for the\r\nstore. \"You young villain!\" he cried, as he entered, \"what did\r\nyou mean by sending me over there to buy Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't,\" answered the young villain, with a perfectly solemn\r\nface, \"I thought you were a widower or a bachelor who wanted to\r\nmarry Rushia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie,\" said the discomfited Dibble, laughing in spite of\r\nhimself; \"but never mind, I'll pay you off some day.\" And\r\ngathering up his furs he departed.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion this sense of humor and love of joking was\r\nturned to very practical account. Among the customers at the\r\nstore were a half a dozen old Revolutionary pensioners, who were\r\npermitted to buy on credit, leaving their pension papers as\r\nsecurity. One of these pensioners was a romancing old fellow\r\nnamed Bevans--more commonly known as \"Uncle Bibbins.\" He was very\r\nfond of his glass, and fonder still of relating anecdotes of the\r\nRevolution, in which his own prowess and daring were always the\r\nconspicuous features. His pension papers were in the possession\r\nof Keeler & Whitlock, but it was three months before the money\r\nwas due, and they grew very weary of having him for a customer.\r\nThey tried delicately suggesting a visit to his relatives in\r\nGuilford, but Uncle Bibbins steadily refused to take the hint.\r\nFinally young Barnum enlisted the services of a journeyman hatter\r\nnamed Benton, and together they hit on a plan. The hatter was\r\ninspired to call Uncle Bibbins a coward, and to declare his\r\nbelief that if the old gentleman was wounded anywhere it must\r\nhave been in the back. Barnum pretended to sympathize with the\r\nveteran's just indignation, and finally fired him up to the pitch\r\nof challenging the hatter to mortal combat. The challenge was\r\npromptly accepted, and the weapons chosen were muskets and ball,\r\nat a distance of twenty feet. Uncle Bibbins took his second\r\n(Barnum, of course) aside, and begged him to see that the guns\r\nwere loaded only with blank cartridges. He was assured that it\r\nwould be so, and that no one would be injured in the encounter.\r\n\r\nThe ground was measured back of the store, the principals and\r\nseconds took their places, and the word of command was given.\r\nThey fired, Uncle Bibbins, of course, being unhurt, but the\r\nhatter, with a fearful yell, fell to the ground as if dead.\r\nBarnum rushed up to the frightened Bevans and begged him to fly,\r\npromising to let him know when it was safe for him to return. The\r\nold fellow started out of town on a run, and for the next three\r\nmonths remained very quietly at Guilford. At the end of that time\r\nhis faithful second sent for him, with the assurance that his\r\nlate adversary had not only recovered from his wound but had\r\nfreely forgiven all. Uncle Bibbins then returned and paid up his\r\ndebts. Meeting Benton on the street some days later, the two foes\r\nshook hands, Benton apologizing for his insult. Uncle Bibbins\r\naccepted the apology, \"but,\" he added, \"you must be careful after\r\nthis how you insult a dead-shot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. BUSINESS LIFE.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL TO BROOKLYN--SMALLPOX--GOES HOME TO RECOVER HIS\r\nHEALTH--RENEWED ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PRETTY TAILORESS, FIRST\r\nINDEPENDENT BUSINESS VENTURE--RESIDENCE IN NEW YORK --RETURN TO\r\nBETHEL--ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1826, Oliver Taylor, who had removed from Danbury\r\nto Brooklyn, induced Barnum to leave Grassy Plain, offering him a\r\nclerkship in his grocery store, which offer was accepted, and\r\nbefore long the young man was intrusted with the purchasing of\r\nall goods for the store. He bought for cash, going into lower New\r\nYork in search of the cheapest market, frequenting auction sales\r\nof merchandise, and often entering into combines with other\r\ngrocers to bid off large lots, which were afterward divided\r\nbetween them. Thus they were enabled to buy at a much lower rate\r\nthan if the goods had passed through the hands of wholesale\r\ndealers, and Barnum's reputation for business tact and shrewdness\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe following summer he was taken ill with smallpox, and during\r\nhis long confinement to the house his stock of ready money became\r\nsadly di-minished. As soon as he was able to travel he went home\r\nto recover his strength, and while there had the happiness of\r\nrenewing the acquaintance, so pleasantly begun, with the pretty\r\ntailoress, Charity Hallett.\r\n\r\nHis health fully restored he returned to Brooklyn, but not to his\r\nold position. Pleasant as that had been, it no longer contented\r\nthe restless, ambitious Barnum. He opened a \"porter-home,\" but\r\nsold out a few months later, at a good profit, and took another\r\nclerkship, this time at 29 Peck Slip, New York, in the store of a\r\ncertain David Thorp. He lived in his employer's family, with\r\nwhich he was a great favorite, and where he had frequent\r\nopportunities of meeting old friends, for Mr. Thorp's place was a\r\ngreat resort for Bethel and Danbury hatters and combmakers.\r\n\r\nAt this time Barnum formed his first taste for the theatre. He\r\nwent to the play regularly and soon set up for a critic. It was\r\nhis one dissipation, however. A more moral young fellow never\r\nexisted; he read his Bible and went to church as regularly as\r\never, and to the day of his death was wont to declare that he\r\nowed all that was good in his character to his early observance\r\nof Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1898 his grandfather offered to him, rent free,\r\nhis carriage-house, which was situated on the main street, if he\r\nwould come back to Bethel. The young man's capital was one\r\nhundred and twenty dollars; fifty of this was spent in fixing up\r\nhis store, and the remainder he invested in a stock of fruit and\r\nconfectionery. Having arranged with fruit dealers of his\r\nacquaintance in New York to receive his orders, he opened his\r\nstore on the first of May--in those times known as \"training\r\nday.\" The first day was so successful that long before noon the\r\nproprietor was obliged to call in one of his old schoolmates to\r\nassist in waiting on customers. The total receipts were\r\nsixty-three dollars, which sum was promptly invested in a stock\r\nof fancy goods --pocket-books, combs, knives, rings, beads, etc.\r\nBusiness was good all summer, and in the fall oysters were added\r\nto the list of attractions. The old grandfather was delighted at\r\nthe success of the scheme, and after a while induced Barnum to\r\ntake an agency for lottery tickets on a commission of ten per\r\ncent. Lotteries in those days were looked upon as thoroughly\r\nrespectable, and the profit gained from the sale of the tickets\r\nwas regarded as perfectly legitimate by the agent; his views on\r\nthe subject changed very materially later on.\r\n\r\nThe store soon became the great village resort, the centre of all\r\ndiscussions and the scene of many practical jokes.\r\n\r\nThe following scene, related by Barnum himself, makes a chapter\r\nin the history of Connecticut, as the State was when \"blue laws\"\r\nwere something more than a dead letter:\r\n\r\n\"To swear in those days was according to custom, but contrary to\r\nlaw. A person from New York State, whom I will call Crofut, who\r\nwas a frequent visitor at my store, was equally noted for his\r\nself-will and his really terrible profanity. One day he was in my\r\nlittle establishment engaged in conversation when Nathan Seelye,\r\nEsq., one of our village justices of the peace, and a man of\r\nstrict religious principles, came in, and hearing Crofut's\r\nprofane language he told him he considered it his duty to fine\r\nhim one dollar for swearing.\r\n\r\n\"Crofut responded immediately with an oath, that he did not care\r\na d----n for the Connecticut blue laws.\r\n\r\n\" 'That will make two dollars,' said Mr. Seelye.\r\n\r\n\"This brought forth another oath.\r\n\r\n\" 'Three dollars,' said the sturdy justice.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but oaths were given in reply, until Esquire Seelye\r\ndeclared the damage to the Connecticut laws to amount to fifteen\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\"Crofut took out a twenty-dollar bill and handed it to the\r\njustice of the peace, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\" 'Sixteen dollars,' said Mr. Seelye, counting out four dollars\r\nto hand to Mr. Crofut as his change.\r\n\r\n\" 'Oh, keep it, keep it,' said Crofut, 'I don't want any change;\r\nI'll d----n soon swear out the balance.' He did so, after which\r\nhe was more circumspect in his conversation, remarking that\r\ntwenty dollars a day for swearing was about as much as he could\r\nstand.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Barnum appeared, on at least one occasion, in the\r\nrole of lawyer. A man charged with assault and battery was\r\nbrought before the justice of the peace, Barnum's grandfather,\r\nfor trial. A medical student, Newton by name, had volunteered to\r\ndefend the prisoner, and Mr. Couch, the grand juryman, in irony,\r\noffered Phineas a dollar to represent the State. The court was\r\ncrowded. The guilt of the prisoner was established beyond a\r\ndoubt, but Newton, undaunted, rose to make his speech. It\r\nconsisted of a flood of invective against the grand juryman,\r\nCouch; the court listened for five minutes, and then interrupted\r\na magnificent burst of eloquence by informing the speaker that\r\nMr. Couch was not the plaintiff in the case at all.\r\n\r\n\"Not the plaintiff!\" stammered Newton; \"well, then, your honor,\r\nwho is?\"\r\n\r\n\"The State of Connecticut,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe young man dropped into his seat, speechless, and the\r\nprosecuting attorney arose and in an elaborate speech declared\r\nthe guilt of the prisoner shown beyond question, adding that he\r\nwas astonished that both the prisoner and his counsel had not\r\npleaded guilty at once. In the midst of his soarings the\r\ngrandfather interrupted with--\"Young man, will you have the\r\nkindness to inform the court which side you represent--the\r\nplaintiff or the defendant?\"\r\n\r\nThe orator stared helplessly at the justice for a moment, and\r\nthen sat down. Amid peals of laughter from the spectators the\r\nprisoner was bound over to the county court for trial.\r\n\r\nBut Phineas did not often come out so ingloriously in encounters\r\nwith his grandfather. The old gentleman was always ready to lend\r\nhis grandson any of his turnouts except one, and this one Phineas\r\nespecially desired one day for a sleighing party, in which he was\r\nto escort the fair Charity Hallett. So he boldly went to the\r\ngrandfather and asked if he might take Arabian and the new\r\nsleigh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the old man, jokingly, \"if you have twenty\r\ndollars in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, really.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Phineas showed the money, and putting it back in his\r\npocket, remarked, \"You see; I am much obliged for the sleigh.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the grandfather had meant to ask an impossible price\r\nfor the horse and sleigh; but being caught up so suddenly, there\r\nwas nothing to do but to consent, and Phineas and \"Chairy\" had\r\nthe finest turnout of the party.\r\n\r\nThere was a young fellow in the town, Jack Mallett, whose\r\neducation was rather deficient, and who had been somewhat\r\nunsuccessfully paying his addresses to a fair but hard-hearted\r\nmaiden, named Lucretia. One Sunday evening she cruelly refused to\r\naccept his escort after church, and added insult to injury by\r\nwalking off before his very eyes with another man. Accordingly,\r\nhe determined to write her a letter of remonstrance, and enlisted\r\nthe aid of Phineas and another young blade known as \"Bill\"\r\nShepherd. The joint effort of the three resulted in the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n                              \"BETHEL,----, 18--.\r\n\r\n\"MISS LUCRETIA: I write this to ask an explanation of your\r\nconduct in giving me the mitten on Sunday night last. If you\r\nthink, madam, that you can trifle with my affections, and turn me\r\noff for every little whipper-snapper that you can pick up, you\r\nwill find yourself considerably mistaken. [We read thus far to\r\nMallett, and it met his approval. He said he liked the idea of\r\ncalling her \"madam,\" for he thought it sounded so \"distant,\" it\r\nwould hurt her feelings very much. The term \"little\r\nwhipper-snapper\" also delighted him. He said he guessed that\r\nwould make her feel cheap. Shepherd and myself were not quite so\r\nsure of its aptitude, since the chap who succeeded in capturing\r\nLucretia, on the occasion alluded to, was a head and shoulders\r\ntaller than Mallett. However, we did not intimate our thoughts to\r\nMallett, and he desired us to \"go ahead and give her another\r\ndose.\"] You don't know me, madam, if you think you can snap me up\r\nin this way. I wish you to understand that I can have the company\r\nof girls as much above you as the sun is above the earth, and I\r\nwon't stand any of your impudent nonsense no how. [This was duly\r\nread and approved. \"Now,\" said Mallett, \"try to touch her\r\nfeelings. Remind her of the pleasant hours we have spent\r\ntogether;\" and we continued as follows:] My dear Lucretia, when I\r\nthink of the many pleasant hours we have spent together--of the\r\ndelightful walks which we have had on moonlight evenings to\r\nFenner's Rocks, Chestnut Ridge, Grassy Plain, Wild Cat and Puppy\r\nTown--of the strolls which we have taken upon Shelter Rocks,\r\nCedar Hill--the visits we have made to Old Lane, Wolfpits, Toad\r\nHole and Plum Trees[1]--when all these things come rushing on my\r\nmind, and when; my dear girl, I remember how often you have told\r\nme that you loved me better than anybody else, and I assured you\r\nthat my feelings were the same as yours, it almost breaks my\r\nheart to think of last Sunday night. [\"Can't you stick in some\r\naffecting poetry here?\" said Mallett. Shepherd could not\r\nrecollect any to the point, nor could I; but as the exigency of\r\nthe case seemed to require it, we concluded to manufacture a\r\nverse or two, which we did, as follows:]\r\n\r\n[1] These were the euphonious names of localities in the vicinity\r\nof Bethel.\r\n\r\n\r\n Lucretia, dear, what have I done,\r\nThat you should use me thus and so,\r\nTo take the arm of Tom Beers' son,\r\nAnd let your dearest true love go?\r\n\r\n Miserable fate, to lose you now,\r\nAnd tear this bleeding heart asunder!\r\nWill you forget your tender vow?\r\nI can't believe it--no, by thunder.\r\n\r\n[Mallett did not like the word \"thunder,\" but being informed that\r\nno other word could be substituted without destroying both rhyme\r\nand reason, he consented that it should remain, provided we added\r\ntwo more stanzas of a softer nature; something, he said, that\r\nwould make the tears come, if possible, We then ground out the\r\nfollowing:]\r\n\r\n Lucretia, dear, do write to Jack,\r\nAnd say with Beers you are not smitten;\r\nAnd thus to me in love come back,\r\nAnd give all other boys the mitten.\r\n\r\n Do this, Lucretia, and till death\r\nI'll love you to intense distraction;\r\nI'll spend for you my every breath,\r\nAnd we will live in satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[\"That will do very well,\" said Mallett. \"Now I guess you had\r\nbetter blow her up a little more.\" We obeyed orders as follows:]\r\nIt makes me mad to think what a fool I was to give you that\r\nfinger-ring and bosom-pin, and spend so much time in your\r\ncompany, just to be flirted and bamboozled as I was on Sunday\r\nnight last. If you continue this course of conduct, we part\r\nforever, and I will thank you to send back that jewelry. I would\r\nsooner see it crushed under my feet than worn by a person who\r\nabused me as you have done. I shall despise you forever if you\r\ndon't change your conduct towards me, and send me a letter of\r\napology on Monday next. I shall not go to meeting to-morrow, for\r\nI would scorn to sit in the same meeting-house with you until I\r\nhave an explanation of your conduct. If you allow any young man\r\nto go home with you to-morrow night, I shall know it, for you\r\nwill be watched, [\"There,\" said Mallett, \"that is pretty strong.\r\nNow, I guess, you had better touch her feelings once more, and\r\nwind up the letter.\" We proceeded as follows:] My sweet girl, if\r\nyou only knew the sleepless nights which I have spent during the\r\npresent week, the torments and sufferings which I endure on your\r\naccount; if you could but realize that I regard the world as less\r\nthan nothing without you, I am certain you would pity me. A\r\nhomely cot and a crust of bread with my adorable Lucretia would\r\nbe a paradise, where a palace without you would be a hades.\r\n[\"What in thunder is hades?\" inquired Jack. We explained. He\r\nconsidered the figure rather bold, and requested us to close as\r\nsoon as possible.] Now, dearest, in bidding you adieu, I implore\r\nyou to reflect on our past enjoyments, look forward with pleasure\r\nto our future happy meetings, and rely upon your affectionate\r\nJack in storm or calm, in sickness, distress or want, for all\r\nthese will be powerless to change my love. I hope to hear from\r\nyou on Monday next, and, if favorable, I shall be happy to call\r\non you the same evening, when in ecstatic joy we will laugh at\r\nthe past, hope for the future, and draw consolation from the fact\r\nthat \"the course of true love never did run smooth.\" This from\r\nyour disconsolate but still hoping lover and admirer,\r\n         \"JACK MALLETT.\r\n\r\n\"P. S.--On reflection I have concluded to go to meeting\r\nto-morrow. If all is well, hold your pocket-handkerchief in your\r\nleft hand as you stand up to sing with the choir--in which case I\r\nshall expect the pleasure of giving you my arm to-morrow night.\r\n                                     \"J. M.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this letter upon Lucretia was not as favorable as\r\ncould have been desired. She declined to remove her handkerchief\r\nfrom her right hand, and she returned the \"ring and bosom-pin\" to\r\nher disconsolate admirer, while, not many months after, Mallett's\r\nrival led Lucretia to the altar. As for Mallett's agreement to\r\npay Shepherd and Barnum five pounds of carpet-rags and twelve\r\nyards of broadcloth \"lists\" for their services, owing to his ill\r\nsuccess, they compromised for one-half the amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. TRYING MANY VENTURES.\r\n\r\nVISIT TO PITTSBURG--SUCCESSFUL LOTTERY BUSINESS--MARRIAGE--FIRST\r\nEDITORIAL VENTURE--LIBEL SUIT, IMPRISONMENT AND\r\nLIBERATION--REMOVAL TO NEW YORK--HARD TIMES--KEEPING A\r\nBOARDING-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Barnum, with a Mr. Samuel Sherwood, of\r\nBridgeport, started for Pittsburg, where they proposed to open a\r\nlottery office. On reaching New York, however, and talking over\r\nthe scheme with friends, the venture was abandoned and the two\r\nmen took, instead, a pleasure trip to Philadelphia. They stayed a\r\nweek, at the end of which time they returned to New York, with\r\nexactly twenty-seven cents between them. Sherwood managed to\r\nborrow two dollars--enough to take him to Newark, where he had a\r\ncousin, who obligingly loaned him fifty dollars. The two friends\r\nremained in New York on the strength of their newly acquired\r\nwealth for several days, and then went home considerably richer\r\nin experience at least.\r\n\r\nBarnum now went into the lottery business exclusively, taking his\r\nuncle, Alanson Taylor, into partnership. They established a\r\nnumber of agencies throughout the country, and made good profits\r\nfrom the sale of tickets. Several of the tickets sold by them\r\ntook prizes and their office came to be considered \"lucky.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man was prospering also in another direction. The fair\r\ntailoress smiled on him as sweetly as ever, and in the summer of\r\n1827 they became formally engaged. In the fall Miss Hallett went\r\n\"on a visit\" to her uncle, Nathan Beers, in New York. A month\r\nlater her lover followed, \"to buy goods,\" and on the 8th of\r\nNovember, 1829, there was a wedding in the comfortable house at\r\nNo. 3 Allen street. Having married at the age of nineteen, Barnum\r\nalways expressed his disapproval of early marriages, although his\r\nown was a very happy one.\r\n\r\nReturning to Bethel, Mr. and Mrs. Barnum, after boarding for a\r\nfew months, moved into their own house, which was built on a\r\nthree acre plat purchased from the grandfather.\r\n\r\nThe lottery business still prospered, but it was mostly in the\r\nhands of agents, in Danbury, Norwalk, Stamford and Middletown,\r\nand Barnum began to look around for some field for his individual\r\nenergies. He tried travelling as a book auctioneer, but found it\r\nuncongenial and quit the business. In July, 1831, with his uncle\r\nAlanson Taylor, he opened a grocery and general store, but the\r\nventure was not particularly successful, and in the fall the\r\npartnership was dissolved, Barnum buying his uncle's interest.\r\n\r\nThe next enterprise was an important one, it being the real\r\nbeginning of Phineas T. Barnum's public career.\r\n\r\nIn a period of strong political excitement, he wrote several\r\ncommunications for the Danbury weekly paper, setting forth what\r\nhe conceived to be the dangers of a sectarian interference which\r\nwas then apparent in political affairs. The publication of these\r\ncommunications was refused, and he accordingly purchased a press\r\nand types, and October 19, 1831, issued the first number of his\r\nown paper, The Herald of Freedom.\r\n\r\n\"I entered upon the editorship of this journal,\" says Mr. Barnum,\r\n\"with all the vigor and vehemence of youth. The boldness with\r\nwhich the paper was conducted soon excited widespread attention\r\nand commanded a circulation which extended beyond the immediate\r\nlocality into nearly every State in the Union. But lacking that\r\nexperience which induces caution, and without the dread of\r\nconsequences, I frequently laid myself open to the charge of\r\nlibel, and three times in three years I was prosecuted. A Danbury\r\nbutcher, a zealous politician, brought a civil suit against me\r\nfor accusing him of being a spy in a Democratic caucus. On the\r\nfirst trial the jury did not agree, but after a second trial I\r\nwas fined several hundred dollars. Another libel suit against me\r\nwas withdrawn. The third was sufficiently important to warrant\r\nthe following detail:\r\n\r\n\"A criminal prosecution was brought against me for stating in my\r\npaper that a man in Bethel, prominent in church, had 'been guilty\r\nof taking USURY of an orphan boy,' and for severely commenting on\r\nthe fact in my editorial columns. When the case came to trial the\r\ntruth of my statement was substantially proved by several\r\nwitnesses and even by the prosecuting party. But 'the greater the\r\ntruth, the greater the libel,' and then I had used the term\r\n'usury,' instead of extortion, or note-shaving, or some other\r\nexpression which might have softened the verdict. The result was\r\nthat I was sentenced to pay a fine of one hundred dollars and to\r\nbe imprisoned in the common jail for sixty days.\r\n\r\n\"The most comfortable provision was made for me in Danbury jail.\r\nMy room was papered and carpeted; I lived well; I was overwhelmed\r\nwith the constant visits of my friends; I edited my paper as\r\nusual and received large accessions to my subscription list; and\r\nat the end of my sixty days' term the event was celebrated by a\r\nlarge concourse of people from the surrounding country. The court\r\nroom in which I was convicted was the scene of the celebration.\r\nAn ode, written for the occasion, was sung; an eloquent oration\r\non the freedom of the press was delivered; and several hundred\r\ngentlemen afterwards partook of a sumptuous dinner followed by\r\nappropriate toasts and speeches. Then came the triumphant part of\r\nthe ceremonial, which was reported in my paper of December 12,\r\n1832, as follows:\r\n\r\n\" 'P. T. Barnum and the band of music took their seats in a coach\r\ndrawn by six horses, which had been prepared for the occasion.\r\nThe coach was preceded by forty horsemen, and a marshal, bearing\r\nthe national standard. Immediately in the rear of the coach was\r\nthe carriage of the orator and the President of the day, followed\r\nby the committee of arrangements and sixty carriages of citizens,\r\nwhich joined in escorting the editor to his home in Bethel.\r\n\r\n\" 'When the procession commenced its march amidst the roar of\r\ncannon, three cheers were given by several hundred citizens who\r\ndid not join in the procession. The band of music continued to\r\nplay a variety of national airs until their arrival in Bethel (a\r\ndistance of three miles), when they struck up the beautiful and\r\nappropriate tune of \"Home, Sweet Home!\" After giving three hearty\r\ncheers, the procession returned to Danbury. The utmost harmony\r\nand unanimity of feeling prevailed throughout the day, and we are\r\nhappy to add that no accident occured to mar the festivities of\r\nthe occasion.' \"\r\n\r\nThe editorial career continued as it had begun. In 1830 The\r\nHerald of Freedom was sold to Mr. George Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe mercantile business was also sold to Horace Fairchild, who\r\nhad been associated with it as partner since 1831, and a Mr.\r\nToucey, who formed a partnership under the name of Fairchild &\r\nCo. Barnum had lost considerable money in this store; he was too\r\nspeculative for ordinary trade, too ready, also to give credit,\r\nand his ledger was full of unpaid accounts when he finally gave\r\nup business.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 he removed his family to New York, taking a house in\r\nHudson street. For a time he tried to get a position in a\r\nmercantile house, not on a fixed salary, but so as to derive a\r\ncommission on his sales, trusting to his ability to make more\r\nmoney in this way than an ordinary clerk could be expected to\r\nreceive. Failing in this he acted as a \"drummer\" for several\r\nstores until spring, when he was fortunate enough to receive\r\nseveral hundred dollars from his agent at Bethel. In May he\r\nopened a private boarding-house at 52 Frankfort street, which was\r\nwell patronized by his Connecticut acquaintances as often as they\r\nvisited the metropolis. This business not occupying his entire\r\ntime, he bought an interest in a grocery store at 156 South\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the years of manhood brought cares, anxieties, and\r\nstruggles for a livelihood, they did not change Barnum's nature,\r\nand the jocose element was still an essential ingredient of his\r\nbeing. He loved fun, practical fun, for itself and for the\r\nenjoyment which it brought. During the year he occasionally\r\nvisited Bridgeport, where he almost always found at the hotel a\r\nnoted joker, named Darrow, who spared neither friend nor foe in\r\nhis tricks. He was the life of the bar-room, and would always try\r\nto entrap some stranger in a bet and so win a treat for the\r\ncompany. He made several ineffectual attempts upon Barnum, and at\r\nlast, one evening, Darrow, who stuttered, made a final trial, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Come, Barnum, I'll make you another proposition; I'll bet you\r\nhadn't got a whole shirt on your back.\" The catch consists in the\r\nfact that generally only one-half of that convenient garment is\r\non the back; but Barnum had anticipated the proposition --in fact\r\nhe had induced a friend, Mr. Hough, to put Darrow up to the\r\ntrick--and had folded a shirt nicely upon his back, securing it\r\nthere with his suspenders. The bar-room was crowded with\r\ncustomers who thought that if Barnum made the bet he would be\r\nnicely caught, and he made presence of playing off and at the\r\nsame time stimulated Darrow to press the bet by saying:\r\n\r\n\"That is a foolish bet to make; I am sure my shirt is whole\r\nbecause it is nearly new; but I don't like to bet on such a\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good reason why,\" said Darrow, in great glee; \"it's ragged.\r\nCome, I'll bet you a treat for the whole company you hadn't got a\r\nwhole shirt on your b-b-b-back!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet my shirt is cleaner than yours,\" Barnum replied.\r\n\r\n\"That's nothing to do w-w-with the case; it's ragged, and y-y-you\r\nknow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it is not,\" Barnum replied, with pretended anger, which\r\ncaused the crowd to laugh heartily.\r\n\r\n\"You poor ragged f-f-fellow, come down here from D-D-Danbury, I'm\r\nsorry for you,\" said Darrow tantalizingly.\r\n\r\n\"You would not pay if you lost,\" Barnum remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Here's f-f-five dollars I'll put in Captain Hinman's (the\r\nlandlord's) hands. Now b-b-bet if you dare, you ragged\r\nc-c-creature, you.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum put five dollars in Captain Hinman's hands, and told him\r\nto treat the company from it if he lost the bet.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" said Darrow, \"I b-b-bet you hadn't got a whole shirt\r\non your bob-back!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Barnum, taking off his coat and commencing to\r\nunbutton his vest. The whole company, feeling sure that he was\r\ncaught, began to laugh heartily. Old Darrow fairly danced with\r\ndelight, and as Barnum laid his coat on a chair he came running\r\nup in front of him, and slapping his hands together, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"You needn't t-t-take off any more c-c-clothes, for if it ain't\r\nall on your b-b-back, you've lost it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is, I suppose you have!\" Barnum replied, pulling the whole\r\nshirt from off his back!\r\n\r\nSuch a shriek of laughter as burst forth from the crowd was\r\nscarcely ever heard, and certainly such a blank countenance as\r\nold Darrow exhibited it would be hard to conceive. Seeing that he\r\nwas most incontinently \"done for,\" and perceiving that his\r\nneighbor Hough had helped to do it, he ran up to him in great\r\nanger, and shaking his fist in his face, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"H-H-Hough, you infernal r-r-rascal, to go against your own\r\nneighbor in favor of a D-D-Danbury man. I'll pay you for that\r\nsome time, you see if I d-d-don't.\"\r\n\r\nAll hands went up to the bar and drank with a hearty good will,\r\nfor it was seldom that Darrow got taken in, and he was such an\r\ninveterate joker they liked to see him paid in his own coin.\r\nNever till the day of his death did he hear the last of the\r\n\"whole shirt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. BEGINNING AS A SHOWMAN.\r\n\r\nFINDING HIS TRUE VOCATION--THE PURCHASE OF JOICE HETH--EVIDENCE\r\nAS TO HER AGE--HER DEATH--SIGNOR VIVALLA--A VISIT TO\r\nWASHINGTON--JOINING A TRAVELLING CIRCUS--CONTROVERSIES WITH\r\nMINISTERS--THE VICTIM OF A PRACTICAL JOKE.\r\n\r\nBarnum was now satisfied that he had not yet found his proper\r\nlevel. He had not yet entered the business for which nature had\r\ndesigned him. There was only a prospect of his going on from this\r\nto that, as his father had done before him, trying many callings\r\nbut succeeding in none. He had not yet discovered that love of\r\namusement is one of the strongest passions of the human heart.\r\nThis, however, was a lesson that he was soon to learn; and he was\r\nto achieve both fame and fortune as a caterer to the public\r\ndesire for entertainment.\r\n\r\nPhilosophizing on this theme in later years, Mr. Barnum once\r\nsaid: \"The show business has all phases and grades of dignity,\r\nfrom the exhibition of a monkey to the exposition of that highest\r\nart in music or the drama which entrances empires and secures for\r\nthe gifted artist a worldwide fame which princes well might envy.\r\nMen, women and children, who cannot live on gravity alone, need\r\nsomething to satisfy their gayer, lighter moods and hours, and he\r\nwho ministers to this want is in a business established by the\r\nAuthor of our nature. If he worthily fulfils his mission, and\r\namuses without corrupting, he need never feel that he has lived\r\nin vain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1835, Mr. Barnum was visited by Mr. Coley\r\nBartram, of Reading, Connecticut, who told him that he had owned\r\nan interest in a remarkable negro woman, who was confidently\r\nbelieved to be one hundred and sixty-one years old and to have\r\nbeen the nurse of Washington. Mr. Bartram showed him a copy of an\r\nadvertisement in The Pennsylvania Inquirer for July 15, 1835, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"CURIOSITY.--The citizens of Philadelphia and its vicinity have\r\nan opportunity of witnessing at the Masonic Hall one of the\r\ngreatest natural curiosities ever witnessed, viz.: JOICE HETH, a\r\nnegress, aged 161 years, who formerly belonged to the father of\r\nGeneral Washington. She has been a member of the Baptist Church\r\none hundred and sixteen years, and can rehearse many hymns, and\r\nsing them according to former custom. She was born near the old\r\nPotomac River in Virginia, and has for ninety or one hundred\r\nyears lived in Paris, Kentucky, with the Bowling family.\r\n\r\n\"All who have seen this extraordinary woman are satisfied of the\r\ntruth of the account of her age. The evidence of the Bowling\r\nfamily, which is respectable, is strong, but the original bill of\r\nsale of Augustine Washington, in his own handwriting, and other\r\nevidences which the proprietor has in his possession, will\r\nsatisfy even the most incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"A lady will attend at the hall during the afternoon and evening\r\nfor the accommodation of those ladies who may call.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bartram told him, moreover, that he had sold out his interest\r\nin the woman to R. W. Lindsay, of Jefferson county, Kentucky, who\r\nwas then exhibiting her as a curiosity, but was anxious to sell\r\nher. Mr. Barnum had seen in some of the New York papers an\r\naccount of Joice Heth, and was so much interested in her that he\r\nat once proceeded to Philadelphia to see her and Mr. Lindsay. How\r\nhe was impressed by her he has himself told. \"Joice Heth,\" he\r\nsays, \"was certainly a remarkable curiosity, and she looked as if\r\nshe might have been far older than her age as advertised. She was\r\napparently in good health and spirits, but from age or disease,\r\nor both, was unable to change her position; she could move one\r\narm at will, but her lower limbs could not be straightened; her\r\nleft arm lay across her breast and she could not remove it; the\r\nfingers of her left hand were drawn down so as nearly to close\r\nit, and were fixed; the nails on that hand were almost four\r\ninches long and extended above her wrist; the nails on her large\r\ntoes had grown to the thickness of a quarter of an inch; her head\r\nwas covered with a thick bush of grey hair; but she was toothless\r\nand totally blind, and her eyes had sunk so deeply in the sockets\r\nas to have disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless she was pert and sociable, and would talk as long\r\nas people would converse with her. She was quite garrulous about\r\nher protege, 'dear little George,' at whose birth she declared\r\nshe was present, having been at the time a slave of Elizabeth\r\nAtwood, a half-sister of Augustine Washington, the father of\r\nGeorge Washington. As nurse she put the first clothes on the\r\ninfant, and she claimed to have 'raised him.' She professed to be\r\na member of the Baptist Church, talking much in her way on\r\nreligious subjects, and she sang a variety of ancient hymns.\r\n\r\n\"In proof of her extraordinary age and pretensions, Mr. Lindsay\r\nexhibited a bill of sale, dated February 5, 1727, from Augustine\r\nWashington, county of Westmoreland, Virginia, to Elizabeth\r\nAtwood, a half-sister and neighbor of Mr. Washington, conveying\r\n'one negro women named Joice Heth, aged fifty-four years, for and\r\nin consideration of the sum of thirty-three pounds lawful money\r\nof Virginia.' It was further claimed that she had long been a\r\nnurse in the Washington family; she was called in at the birth of\r\nGeorge and clothed the newborn infant. The evidence seemed\r\nauthentic, and in answer to the inquiry why so remarkable a\r\ndiscovery had not been made before, a satisfactory explanation\r\nwas given in the statement that she had been carried from\r\nVirginia to Kentucky, had been on the plantation of John S.\r\nBowling so long that no one knew or cared how old she was, and\r\nonly recently the accidental discovery by Mr. Bowling's son of\r\nthe old bill of sale in the Record Office in Virginia had led to\r\nthe identification of this negro woman as 'the nurse of\r\nWashington.' \"\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to Barnum to be entirely straightforward, and\r\nhe decided, if possible, to purchase the woman. She was offered\r\nto him at $1,000, although Lindsay at first wanted $3,000. Barnum\r\nhad $500 in cash, and was able to borrow $500 more. Thus he\r\nsecured Joice Heth, sold out his interest in the grocery business\r\nto his partner, and entered upon his career as a showman. He\r\nafterward declared that the least deserving of all his efforts in\r\nthe show line was this one which introduced him to the business;\r\nit was a scheme in no sense of his own devising; but it was one\r\nwhich had been for some time before the public, and which he\r\nhonestly and with good reason believed to be genuine. He entered\r\nupon his new work with characteristic enterprise, resorting to\r\nposters, transparencies, advertisements, newspaper paragraphs,\r\nand everything else calculated to attract the attention of the\r\npublic, regardless of expense. He exhibited in New York, Boston,\r\nPhiladelphia, Albany, and many other places, where his rooms were\r\nthronged and much money made. But in the following February Joice\r\nHeth died of old age, and was buried at Bethel. A postmortem\r\nexamination was made by a surgeon and some medical students, who\r\nwere inclined to doubt if she really was as old as Lindsay had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThus ended Barnum's first enterprise as a showman. It had been\r\nprofitable to him, and had pointed out to him the path of\r\nsuccess. His next venture was entirely genuine and\r\nstraightforward. He engaged an Italian, who called himself Signor\r\nAntonio, and who was a skilful performer on stilts, on the tight\r\nrope and at juggling. Barnum engaged him for a year at $12 a week\r\nand his expenses, and got him to change his stage name to Signor\r\nVivalla. He then resorted to his former means of advertising, and\r\nstarted on his tour. For Vivalla's first week of performances\r\nBarnum received $50, and for the second week three times as much.\r\nAt the close of the first performance, in response to loud\r\napplause, Barnum appeared upon the stage and made a speech to the\r\naudience, a performance which he repeated thousands of times in\r\nafter years. This engagement was at the Franklin Theatre in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe show next appeared in Boston, with great success. Next it\r\nwent to Washington and had a most disastrous week, for every\r\nnight was stormy. Indeed Barnum found himself literally stranded\r\nthere, with not enough money to get away. He was driven to pawn\r\nhis watch and chain for $35, and then met a friend who helped him\r\nout of his dilemma.\r\n\r\n\"As this was my first visit to Washington, I was much\r\ninterested,\" says Barnum, \"in visiting the capitol and other\r\npublic buildings. I also satisfied my curiosity in seeing Clay,\r\nCalhoun, Benton, John Quincy Adams, Richard M. Johnson, Polk, and\r\nother leading statesmen of the time. I was also greatly gratified\r\nin calling upon Anne Royall, author of the Black Book, publisher\r\nof a little paper called 'Paul Pry,' and quite a celebrated\r\npersonage in her day. I had exchanged The Herald of Freedom with\r\nher journal, and she strongly sympathized with me in my\r\npersecutions. She was delighted to see me, and although she was\r\nthe most garrulous old woman I ever saw, I passed a very amusing\r\nand pleasant time with her. Before leaving her I manifested my\r\nshowman propensity by trying to hire her to give a dozen or more\r\nlectures on 'Government' in the Atlantic cities, but I could not\r\nengage her at any price, although I am sure the speculation would\r\nhave been a very profitable one. I never saw this eccentric woman\r\nagain; she died at a very advanced age, October 1, 1854, at her\r\nresidence in Washington.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Washington the show went to Philadelphia and appeared at the\r\nWalnut Street Theatre. The audiences were small and it was\r\nevident that something must be done to arouse public interest.\r\n\"And now,\" says Barnum, \"that instinct which can arouse a\r\ncommunity and make it patronize one, provided the article offered\r\nis worthy of patronage, an instinct which served me greatly in\r\nlater years, astonishing the public and surprising me, came to my\r\nrelief, and the help, curiously enough, appeared in the shape of\r\nan emphatic hiss from the pit!\r\n\r\n\"This hiss, I discovered, came from one Roberts, a circus\r\nperformer, and I had an interview with him. He was a professional\r\nbalancer and juggler, who boasted that he could do all Vivalla\r\nhad done and something more. I at once published a card in\r\nVivalla's name, offering $1,000 to any one who would publicly\r\nperform Vivalla's feats at such place as should be designated,\r\nand Roberts issued a counter card accepting the offer. I then\r\ncontracted with Mr. Warren, treasurer of the Walnut Street\r\nTheatre, for one-third of the proceeds, if I should bring the\r\nreceipts up to $400 a night--an agreement he could well afford to\r\nmake as his receipts the night before had been but seventy-five\r\ndollars. From him I went to Roberts, who seemed disposed to 'back\r\ndown,' but I told him that I should not insist upon the terms of\r\nhis published card, and ask him if he was under any engagement?\r\nLearning that he was not I offered him thirty dollars to perform\r\nunder my direction one night at the Walnut, and he accepted. A\r\ngreat trial of skill between Roberts and Vivalla was duly\r\nannounced by posters and through the press. Meanwhile, they\r\nrehearsed privately to see what tricks each could perform, and\r\nthe 'business' was completely arranged.\r\n\r\n\"Public excitement was at fever heat, and on the night of the\r\ntrial the pit and upper boxes were crowded to the full. The\r\n'contest' between the performers was eager, and each had his\r\nparty in the house. So far as I could learn, no one complained\r\nthat he did not get all he paid for on that occasion. I engaged\r\nRoberts for a month, and his subsequent 'contests' with Vivalla\r\namused the public and put money in my purse.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1836 Barnum joined his show with Aaron Turner's\r\ntravelling circus, himself acting as ticket seller, secretary and\r\ntreasurer, at thirty dollars a month and one-fifth of the total\r\nprofits, while Vivalla was to get fifty dollars a month. Barnum\r\nwas himself paying Vivalla eighty dollars a month, so that he\r\nreally had left for himself only his one-fifth share of the\r\nprofits. The combined show set out from Danbury, Connecticut, for\r\nWest Springfield, Massachusetts, on April 26. On the first day,\r\nBarnum relates, instead of stopping for dinner, Turner simply\r\ndistributed to the company three loaves of rye bread and a pound\r\nof butter, which he bought at a farmhouse for fifty cents. On\r\nApril 28 they began their performances at West Springfield, and\r\nas their band of music had not arrived from Providence, as\r\nexpected, Barnum made a speech to the audience in place of it,\r\nwhich seemed to please everybody. The engagement was successful,\r\nand the tour was continued during the summer through numerous\r\ntowns and cities in New England, the Middle States, Maryland,\r\nVirginia and North Carolina.\r\n\r\nMany incidents, humorous and otherwise, marked their progress. At\r\nCabotville, Massachusetts, on going to bed one night one of the\r\ncompany threw a lighted cigar stump into a box of sawdust, and\r\nthe result was that, an hour or two later, they all narrowly\r\nescaped suffocation from the smoke. At Lenox, Massachusetts, they\r\nspent Sunday and Barnum went to church as usual. The sermon was\r\ndirected against the circus, denouncing it in very abusive terms\r\nas an immoral and degrading institution. \"Thereupon,\" says\r\nBarnum, \"when the minister had read the closing hymn, I walked up\r\nthe pulpit stairs and handed him a written request, signed 'P. T.\r\nBarnum, connected with the circus, June 5, 1836,' to be permitted\r\nto reply to him. He declined to notice it, and after the\r\nbenediction I lectured him for not giving me an opportunity to\r\nvindicate myself and those with whom I was connected. The affair\r\ncreated considerable excitement, and some of the members of the\r\nchurch apologized to me for their clergyman's ill behavior. A\r\nsimilar affair happened afterward at Port Deposit, on the lower\r\nSusquehanna, and in this instance I addressed the audience for\r\nhalf an hour, defending the circus company against the attacks of\r\nthe clergyman, and the people listened, though their pastor\r\nrepeatedly implored them to go home. Often have I collected our\r\ncompany on Sunday and read to them the Bible or a printed sermon,\r\nand one or more of the men frequently accompanied me to church.\r\nWe made no pretense of religion, but we were not the worst people\r\nin the world, and we thought ourselves entitled to at least\r\ndecent treatment when we went to hear the preaching of the\r\nGospel.\"\r\n\r\nTurner, the proprietor of the circus, was a self-made man. He had\r\nmade himself rich through industry, as he believed any other man\r\nwith common sense could do, and he was very proud of the fact. He\r\nwas also an inveterate practical joker, and once, at Annapolis,\r\nMaryland, he played upon Barnum a trick which came very near\r\nhaving a serious result. They got there on Saturday night, and\r\nthe next morning Barnum went out for a walk, wearing a fine new\r\nsuit of black clothes. As he passed through the bar-room and out\r\nof the hotel Turner said to some bystanders, who did not know\r\nBarnum:\r\n\r\n\"I think it very singular that you permit that rascal to march\r\nyour streets in open day. It wouldn't be allowed in Rhode Island,\r\nand I suppose that is the reason the scoundrel has come down this\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, who is he?\" they demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know? Why, that is the Rev. E. K. Avery, the murderer\r\nof Miss Cornell.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly there was a rush of the whole crowd to the door, eager\r\nto get another look at Barnum, and uttering threats of vengeance.\r\nThis man Avery had only lately been tried in Rhode Island for the\r\nmurder of Miss Cornell, whose dead body was discovered in a\r\nstack-yard, and though he was acquitted by the court everybody\r\nbelieved him guilty. Accordingly, Barnum soon found himself\r\novertaken and surrounded by a mob of one hundred or more and his\r\nears saluted with such remarks as \"the lecherous old hypocrite,\"\r\n\"the sanctified murderer,\" \"the black-coated villain,\" \"lynch\r\nhim,\" \"tar and feather him,\" and others still more harsh and\r\nthreatening. Then one man seized him by the collar, while others\r\nbrought a fence rail and some rope.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the man who collared him, \"old chap, you can't walk\r\nany further; we know you, and as we always make gentlemen ride in\r\nthese parts, you may just prepare to straddle that rail!\"\r\n\r\nHis surprise may be imagined. \"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed, as\r\nthey all pressed around, \"gentlemen, what have I done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we know you,\" exclaimed half a dozen voices; \"you needn't\r\nroll your sanctimonious eyes; that game don't take in this\r\ncountry. Come, straddle the rail, and REMEMBER THE STACK-YARD!\"\r\n\r\nHe grew more and more bewildered; he could not imagine what\r\npossible offence he was to suffer for, and he continued to\r\nexclaim, \"Gentlemen, what have I done? Don't kill me, gentlemen,\r\nbut tell me what I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, make him straddle the rail; we'll show him how to hang\r\npoor factory girls,\" shouted a man in the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe man who had him by the collar then remarked \"Come, MR. AVERY,\r\nit's no use; you see, we know you, and we'll give you a touch of\r\nlynch law, and start you for home again.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is NOT Avery, gentlemen; you are mistaken in your man,\"\r\nhe exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, none of your gammon; straddle the rail, Ephraim.\"\r\n\r\nThe rail was brought and Barnum was about to be placed on it,\r\nwhen the truth flashed upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he exclaimed, \"I am not Avery; I despise that\r\nvillain as much as you can; my name is Barnum; I belong to the\r\ncircus which arrived here last night, and I am sure Old Turner,\r\nmy partner, has hoaxed you with this ridiculous story.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he has we'll lynch him,\" said one of the mob.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he has, I'll assure you, and if you will walk to the hotel\r\nwith me, I'll convince you of the fact.\"\r\n\r\nThis they reluctantly assented to, keeping, however, a close hand\r\nupon him. As they walked up the main street, the mob received a\r\nre-enforcement of some fifty or sixty, and Barnum was marched\r\nlike a malefactor up to the hotel. Old Turner stood on the piazza\r\nready to explode with laughter. Barnum appealed to him for\r\nheaven's sake to explain this matter, that he might be liberated.\r\nHe continued to laugh, but finally told them \"he believed there\r\nwas some mistake about it. The fact is,\" said he, \"my friend\r\nBarnum has a new suit of black clothes on and he looks so much\r\nlike a priest that I thought he must be Avery.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd saw the joke and seemed satisfied. Barnum's new coat\r\nhad been half-torn from his back, and he had been very roughly\r\nhandled. But some of the crowd apologized for the outrage,\r\ndeclaring that Turner ought to be served in the same way, while\r\nothers advised Barnum to \"get even with him.\" Barnum was very\r\nmuch offended, and when the mob-dispersed he asked Turner what\r\ncould have induced him to play such a trick.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Barnum,\" he replied, \"it was all for our good.\r\nRemember, all we need to insure success is notoriety. You will\r\nsee that this will be noised all about town as a trick played by\r\none of the circus managers upon the other, and our pavilion will\r\nbe crammed to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nIt was even so; the trick was told all over town, and every one\r\ncame to see the circus managers who were in a habit of playing\r\npractical jokes upon each other. They had fine audiences while\r\nthey remained at Annapolis, but it was a long time before Barnum\r\nforgave Turner for his rascally \"joke.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. INCIDENTS OF A CIRCUS TOUR.\r\n\r\nBEATING A LANDLORD--A JOKE ON TURNER--BARNUM AS A PREACHER AND AS\r\nA NEGRO MINSTREL--A BAD MAN WITH A GUN--DEALING WITH A\r\nSHERIFF--\"LADY HAYES\"--AN EMBARASSED JUGGLER--BARNUM AS A\r\nMATRIMONIAL AGENT.\r\n\r\nAt almost every place visited by the travelling company, some\r\nnotable incident occurred. At Hanover Court House, Virginia, for\r\nexample, it was raining so heavily that they could not give a\r\nperformance, and Turner therefore decided to start for Richmond\r\nimmediately after dinner. Their landlord, however, said that as\r\ntheir agent had engaged three meals and lodgings for the whole\r\ntroupe, the whole bill must be paid whether they went then or\r\nstayed until next morning. No compromise could be made with the\r\nstubborn fellow, and Turner was equally stubborn in his\r\ndetermination both to go at once and also to have the worth of\r\nhis money. The following programme was accordingly carried out,\r\nTurner insisting upon every detail:\r\n\r\nDinner was ordered at twelve o'clock and was duly prepared and\r\neaten. As soon as the table was cleared, supper was ordered, at\r\nhalf past twelve. After eating as much of this as their dinner\r\nhad left room for, the whole company went to bed at one o'clock\r\nin the afternoon. Each man insisted upon taking a lighted candle\r\nto his room, and the whole thirty-six of them undressed and went\r\nto bed as though they proposed to stay all night. Half an hour\r\nlater they arose and dressed again and went down to breakfast,\r\nwhich Turner had ordered served at two o'clock sharp. They could\r\neat but little of this meal, of course, but they did the best\r\nthey could, and at half past two in the afternoon were on their\r\nway to Richmond. Throughout the whole absurd proceedings the\r\nlandlord was furiously angry. Turner was as solemn as a corpse,\r\nand the rest of the company were convulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance one evening at Richmond, Barnum tried to\r\npay Turner for that practical joke about the Rev. Mr. Avery. A\r\nscore of the company were telling stories and singing songs in\r\nthe sitting room of the hotel. Presently somebody began\r\npropounding some amusing arithmetical problems. Then Turner\r\nproposed one, which was readily solved. Barnum's turn came next,\r\nand he offered the following, for Turner's especial benefit:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose a man is thirty years of age, and he has a child one\r\nyear of age; he is thirty times older than his child. When the\r\nchild is thirty years old, the father, being sixty, is only twice\r\nas old as his child. When the child is sixty the father is\r\nninety, and therefore only one-third older than the child. When\r\nthe child is ninety the father is one hundred and twenty, and\r\ntherefore only one-fourth older than the child. Thus you see, the\r\nchild is gradually but surely gaining on the parent, and as he\r\ncertainly continues to come nearer and nearer, in time he must\r\novertake him. The question therefore is, suppose it was possible\r\nfor them to live long enough, how old would the father be when\r\nthe child overtook him and became of the same age?\"\r\n\r\nThe company generally saw the catch; but Turner was very much\r\ninterested in the problem, and although he admitted he knew\r\nnothing about arithmetic, he was convinced that as the son was\r\ngradually gaining on the father he must reach him if there was\r\ntime enough--say, a thousand years, or so--for the race. But an\r\nold gentleman gravely remarked that the idea of a son becoming as\r\nold as his father while both were living, was simply nonsense,\r\nand he offered to bet a dozen of champagne that the thing was\r\nimpossible, even \"in figures.\" Turner, who was a betting man, and\r\nwho thought the problem might be proved, accepted the wager; but\r\nhe was soon convinced that however much the boy might relatively\r\ngain upon his father, there would always be thirty years\r\ndifference in their ages. The champagne cost him $25, and he\r\nfailed to see the fun of Barnum's arithmetic, though at last he\r\nacknowledged that it was a fair offset to the Avery trick.\r\n\r\nFrom Richmond they went to Petersburg, and thence to Warrenton,\r\nNorth Carolina, and there, on October 30, Barnum and Turner\r\nseparated, Barnum's engagement having expired with a clear profit\r\nto himself of about $1,200. Barnum took Vivalla, a negro singer\r\nand dancer named James Sandford, several musicians, horses and\r\nwagons, and a small canvas tent. With these he proposed to carry\r\non a travelling show of his own. His first stop was on Saturday,\r\nNovember 12, 1836, at Rocky Mount Falls, North Carolina. The next\r\nday, being Sunday, Barnum set out for church. \"I noticed,\" he\r\nsays, \"a stand and benches in a grove near by, and determined to\r\nspeak to the people if I was permitted. The landlord who was with\r\nme said that the congregation, coming from a distance to attend a\r\nsingle service, would be very glad to hear a stranger, and I\r\naccordingly asked the venerable clergyman to announce that after\r\nservice I would speak for half an hour in the grove. Learning\r\nthat I was not a clergyman, he declined to give the notice, but\r\nsaid that he had no objection to my making the announcement,\r\nwhich I did, and the congregation, numbering about three hundred,\r\npromptly came to hear me.\r\n\r\n\"I told them I was not a preacher, and had very little experience\r\nin public speaking, but I felt a deep interest in matters of\r\nmorality and religion, and would attempt in a plain way, to set\r\nbefore them the duties and privileges of man. I appealed to every\r\nman's experience, observation and reason, to confirm the Bible\r\ndoctrine of wretchedness in vice and happiness in virtue. We\r\ncannot violate the laws of God with impunity, and He will not\r\nkeep back the wages of well-doing. The outside show of things is\r\nof very small account. We must look to realities and not to\r\nappearances. 'Diamonds may glitter on a vicious breast,' but 'the\r\nsoul's calm sunshine and the heart-felt joy is virtue's prize.'\r\nThe rogue, the passionate man, the drunkard, are not to be envied\r\neven at the best, and a conscience hardened by sin is the most\r\nsorrowful possession we can think of.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum proceeded in this strain with various scriptural\r\nquotations and familiar illustrations, for three-quarters of an\r\nhour. At the end of his address several persons came up to shake\r\nhands with him, saying that they had been greatly pleased and\r\nedified by his remarks and asking to know his name. He went away\r\nfeeling that possibly he had done some good by means of his\r\nimpromptu preaching.\r\n\r\nThe negro singer and dancer, Sandford, abruptly deserted the show\r\nat Camden, South Carolina, and left Barnum in a bad plight. An\r\nentertainment of negro songs had been advertised, and no one was\r\nable to fill Sandford's place. Barnum was determined, however,\r\nthat his audience should not be disappointed, and so he blackened\r\nhis own face and went on the stage himself, singing a number of\r\nplantation melodies. His efforts were received with great\r\napplause, and he was recalled several times. This performance was\r\nrepeated for several evenings.\r\n\r\nOne night after thus personating a negro, Barnum heard a\r\ndisturbance outside the tent. Hastening to the spot he found a\r\nman quarreling with one of his company. He interfered, whereupon\r\nthe man drew a pistol and pointing it at Barnum's head,\r\nexclaimed, \"you black scoundrel! How dare you use such language\r\nto a white man?\" He evidently took Barnum for a real negro, and\r\nin another moment would have blown his brains out. But quick as a\r\nflash the showman exclaim, \"I am as white as you!\" and at the\r\nsame moment rolled up his sleeves showing the white skin of his\r\narm. The other man dropped his pistol in consternation and humbly\r\nbegged Barnum's pardon.\r\n\r\n\"On four different occasions in my life,\" said Mr. Barnum not\r\nlong before his death, \"I have had a loaded pistol pointed at my\r\nhead and each time I have escaped death by what seemed a miracle.\r\nI have also often been in deadly peril by accidents, and when I\r\nthink of these things I realize my indebtedness to an\r\nall-protecting Providence. Reviewing my career, too, and\r\nconsidering the kind of company I kept for years and the\r\nassociations with which I was surrounded and connected, I am\r\nsurprised as well as grateful that I was not ruined. I honestly\r\nbelieve that I owe my preservation from the degradation of living\r\nand dying a loafer and a vagabond, to the single fact that I was\r\nnever addicted to strong drink. To be sure, I have in times past\r\ndrank liquor, but I have generally wholly abstained from\r\nintoxicating beverages, and for many years, I am glad to say, I\r\nhave been a strict 'teetotaller.' \"\r\n\r\nAt Camden, Barnum also lost one of his musicians, a Scotchman\r\nnamed Cochran. This man was arrested and, in spite of Barnum's\r\nefforts to save him, imprisoned for many months for advising a\r\nnegro barber who was shaving him to run away to the Free States\r\nor to Canada. To fill up his ranks Barnum now hired Bob White, a\r\nnegro singer, and Joe Pentland, a clown, ventriloquist, comic\r\nsinger, juggler, and sleight-of-hand performer, and also bought\r\nfour horses and two wagons. He called this enlarged show\r\n\"Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theatre.\"\r\n\r\nAt Raleigh, North Carolina, Barnum had sold a half interest in\r\nhis show to a man called Henry,--not his real name. The latter\r\nnow acted as treasurer and ticket taker. When they reached\r\nAugusta, Georgia, the Sheriff served a writ upon Henry for a debt\r\nof $500. As Henry had $600 of the Company's money in his pockets,\r\nBarnum at once secured a bill of sale of all his property in the\r\nexhibition. Armed with this he met Henry's creditor and his\r\nlawyer, who demanded the key of the stable, so that they might\r\nlevy on the horses and wagons. Barnum asked them to wait a little\r\nwhile until he could see Henry, to which they agreed. Henry was\r\nanxious to cheat his creditor, and accordingly was glad to sign\r\nthe bill of sale. Then Barnum returned and told the creditor and\r\nhis lawyer that Henry would neither pay nor compromise the claim.\r\nThe Sheriff thereupon demanded the stable key, so that he might\r\nattach Henry's share of the property. \"Not yet,\" said Barnum,\r\npulling out the bill of sale, \"I am in possession as entire owner\r\nof this property. I have already purchased it, and you have not\r\nyet levied on it. You will touch my property at your peril.\"\r\n\r\nThe creditor and the sheriff were thus baffled, but they\r\nimmediately arrested Henry and took him to prison. The next day\r\nBarnum learned that Henry really owed $1,300, and that he had\r\npromised his creditor that he would pay him $500 of the company's\r\nmoney and a bill of sale of his interest in the show at the end\r\nof the Saturday night performance, in consideration of which the\r\ncreditor was to allow him to take one of the horses and run away,\r\nleaving Barnum in the lurch. Learning this, Barnum was not\r\ndisposed to help Henry any further. Finding that Henry had\r\nintrusted the $500 to Vivalla, to keep it from the sheriff,\r\nBarnum secured it from Vivalla on Henry's order, under pretense\r\nof securing bail for the prisoner. Then he paid the creditor the\r\nfull amount obtained from Henry as the price of his half-interest\r\nand received in return an assignment of $500 of the creditor's\r\nclaim and a guarantee that he should not be troubled by Henry for\r\nit. Thus his own promptness rescued Barnum from one of the most\r\nunpleasant situations in which he was ever placed.\r\n\r\nAfter this they got into one of the most desolate parts of\r\nGeorgia. One night their advance agent, finding it impossible to\r\nreach the next town, arranged for the whole show to spend the\r\nnight at a miserable and solitary hovel owned by an old woman\r\nnamed Hayes. The horses were to be picketed in a field, and the\r\ncompany were to sleep in the tent and the out houses. Posters\r\nwere scattered over the country, announcing that a performance\r\nwould be given there the next day, the agent thinking that, as a\r\nshow was a rarity in that region, a considerable number of small\r\nfarmers would be glad to attend.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" says Barnum, \"our advertiser, who was quite a wag,\r\nwrote back informing us of the difficulty of reaching a town on\r\nthat part of our route, and stating that he had made arrangements\r\nfor us to stay over night on the plantation of 'Lady Hayes,' and\r\nthat although the country was sparsely settled, we could\r\ndoubtless give a profitable performance to a fair audience.\r\n\r\n\"Anticipating a fine time on this noble 'plantation,' we started\r\nat four o'clock in the morning so as to arrive at one o'clock,\r\nthus avoiding the heat of the afternoon. Towards noon we came to\r\na small river where some men, whom we afterwards discovered to be\r\ndown-east Yankees, from Maine, were repairing a bridge. Every\r\nflooring plank had been taken up, and it was impossible for our\r\nteams to cross. 'Could the bridge be fixed so that we could go\r\nover?' I inquired. 'No; it would take half a day, and meantime,\r\nif we must cross, there was a place about sixteen miles down the\r\nriver where we could get over. 'But we can't go so far as that;\r\nwe are under engagement to perform on Lady Hayes's place\r\nto-night, and we must cross here. Fix the bridge and we will pay\r\nyou handsomely.'\r\n\r\n\"They wanted no money, but if we would give them some tickets to\r\nour show they thought they might do something for us. I gladly\r\nconsented, and in fifteen minutes we crossed that bridge. The\r\ncunning rascals had seen our posters and knew we were coming; so\r\nthey had taken up the planks of the bridge and had hidden them\r\ntill they had levied upon us for tickets, when the floor was\r\nre-laid in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Towards dinner-time we began to look out for the grand mansion\r\nof 'Lady Hayes,' and seeing nothing but little huts we quietly\r\npursued our journey. At one o'clock--the time when we should have\r\narrived at our destination--I became impatient, and riding up to\r\na poverty-stricken hovel and seeing a ragged, bare-footed old\r\nwoman, with her sleeves rolled up to her shoulders, who was\r\nwashing clothes in front of the door, I inquired--\" 'Hello! can\r\nyou tell me where Lady Hayes lives?'\r\n\r\n\"The old woman raised her head, which was covered with tangled\r\nlocks and matted hair, and exclaimed--\" 'Hey?'\r\n\r\n\" 'No, Hayes, Lady Hayes; where is her plantation?'\r\n\r\n\" 'This is the place,' she answered; 'I'm Widder Hayes, and you\r\nare all to stay here to-night.'\r\n\r\n\"We could not believe our ears or eyes; but after putting the\r\ndirty old woman through a severe cross-examination she finally\r\nproduced a contract, signed by our advertiser, agreeing for board\r\nand lodging for the company, and we found ourselves booked for\r\nthe night. It appeared that our advertiser could find no better\r\nquarters in that forlorn section, and he had indulged in a joke\r\nat our expense by exciting our appetites and imaginations in\r\nanticipation of the luxuries we should find in the magnificent\r\nmansion of 'Lady Hayes.'\r\n\r\n\"Joe Pentland grumbled, Bob White indulged in some very strong\r\nlanguage, and Signor Vivalla laughed. He had travelled with his\r\nmonkey and organ in Italy and could put up with any fare that\r\noffered. I took the disappointment philosophically, simply\r\nremarking that we must make the best of it and compensate\r\nourselves when we reached a town next day.\r\n\r\n\"The next forenoon we arrived at Macon, and congratulated\r\nourselves that we had reached the regions of civilization.\r\n\r\n\"In going from Columbus, Ga., to Montgomery, Ala., we were\r\nobliged to cross a thinly-settled, desolate tract, known as the\r\n'Indian Nation,' and as several persons had been murdered by\r\nhostile Indians in that region, it was deemed dangerous to travel\r\nthe road without an escort. Only the day before we started, the\r\nmail stage had been stopped and the passengers murdered, the\r\ndriver alone escaping. We were well armed, however, and trusted\r\nthat our numbers would present too formidable a force to be\r\nattacked, though we dreaded to incur the risk. Vivalla alone was\r\nfearless and was ready to encounter fifty Indians and drive them\r\ninto the swamp.\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, when we had safely passed over the entire route to\r\nwithin fourteen miles of Montgomery, and were beyond the reach of\r\ndanger, Joe Pentland determined to test Vivalla's bravery. He had\r\nsecretly purchased at Mt. Megs, on the way, an old Indian dress\r\nwith a fringed hunting shirt and moccasins and these he put on,\r\nafter coloring his face with Spanish brown. Then shouldering his\r\nmusket he followed Vivalla and the party, and, approaching\r\nstealthily leaped into their midst with a tremendous whoop.\r\n\r\n\"Vivalla's companions were in the secret, and they instantly fled\r\nin all directions. Vivalla himself ran like a deer and Pentland\r\nafter him, gun in hand and yelling horribly. After running a full\r\nmile the poor little Italian, out of breath and frightened nearly\r\nto death, dropped on his knees and begged for his life. The\r\n'Indian' leveled his gun at his victim, but soon seemed to\r\nrelent, and signified that Vivalla should turn his pockets inside\r\nout--which he did, producing and handing over a purse containing\r\neleven dollars. The savage then marched Vivalla to an oak, and\r\nwith a handkerchief tied him in the most approved Indian manner\r\nto the tree, leaving him half dead with fright.\r\n\r\n\"Pentland then joined us, and washing his face and changing his\r\ndress, we all went to the relief of Vivalla. He was overjoyed to\r\nsee us, and when he was released his courage returned; he swore\r\nthat after his companions left him, the Indian had been\r\nre-inforced by six more, to whom, in default of a gun or other\r\nmeans to defend himself, Vivalla had been compelled to surrender.\r\nWe pretended to believe his story for a week, and then told him\r\nthe joke, which he refused to credit, and also declined to take\r\nthe money which Pentland offered to return, as it could not\r\npossibly be his since seven Indians had taken his money. We had a\r\ngreat deal of fun over Vivalla's courage, but the matter made him\r\nso cross and surly that we were finally obliged to drop it\r\naltogether. From that time forward, however, Vivalla never\r\nboasted of his prowess.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of February, 1837, they reached Montgomery, and there\r\nBarnum sold a half interest in his show to Henry Hawley, a\r\nsleight-of-hand performer. He was a very clever fellow and was\r\nnever known to be non-plussed or embarrassed in his tricks,\r\nexcept upon one occasion. This was when he was performing the\r\nwell-known egg and bag trick, which he did with great success,\r\ntaking egg after egg from the bag and finally breaking one to\r\nshow that they were genuine. \"Now,\" said he \"I will show you the\r\nold hen that laid them.\" But it happened that the negro boy to\r\nwhom had been intrusted the duty of supplying \"properties,\" had\r\nmade a slight mistake. The result was that Hawley triumphantly\r\nproduced not \"the old hen that laid the eggs,\" but a most\r\npalpable and evident rooster. The audience roared with laughter,\r\nand Hawley, completely taken aback, fled in confusion to his\r\ndressing room, uttering furious maledictions upon the boy who was\r\nthe author of his woe.\r\n\r\nThe show visited various places in Alabama, Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, and finally disbanded at Nashville in May, 1837.\r\nVivalla went to New York and gave some performances on his own\r\naccount before sailing for Cuba. Hawley remained in Tennessee,\r\nand Barnum went home to his family. Early in July, however, he\r\nformed a new company and went back to rejoin Hawley. But they\r\nwere not successful, and in August they parted again, Barnum\r\nforming a new partnership with one Z. Graves. He then went to\r\nTiffin, Ohio, where he re-engaged Joe Pentland and got together\r\nthe nucleus of a new company.\r\n\r\nDuring his short stay at Tiffin, Barnum got into a discussion\r\nwith various gentlemen on religious subjects, and in response to\r\ntheir invitation lectured, or preached, in the school-house on\r\nSunday afternoon and evening. He also went to the neighboring\r\ntown of Republic and delivered two lectures.\r\n\r\nOn his way back to Kentucky, just before he reached Cincinnati,\r\nhe met a drove of hogs. One of the drivers made an insolent\r\nremark because the circus wagons interfered with the driving of\r\nthe hogs, and Barnum responded angrily. Thereupon the fellow\r\njumped from his horse, pointed a pistol at Barnum's breast and\r\nswore he would shoot him if he did not apologize. Barnum asked\r\npermission to speak first to a friend in the next wagon, after\r\nwhich, he said, he would give the man full satisfaction. The\r\n\"friend\" proved to be a loaded double barrelled gun, which Barnum\r\nleveled at the hog-driver's head, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, you must apologize, or have your brains blown out. You\r\ndrew a weapon upon me for a careless remark. You seem to hold\r\nhuman life at a cheap price. Now you have the choice between a\r\nload of shot and an apology.\"\r\n\r\nThe man apologized promptly, a pleasant conversation ensued, and\r\nthey parted excellent friends.\r\n\r\nOn this tour they exhibited at Nashville, where Barnum visited\r\nGeneral Jackson at the Hermitage; at Huntsville, Tuscaloosa,\r\nVicksburg and various other places, generally doing well. At\r\nVicksburg they bought a steamboat and went down the river,\r\nstopping at every important landing to exhibit. At Natchez their\r\ncook deserted them, and Barnum set out to find another. He found\r\na white woman who was willing to go, only she expected to marry a\r\npainter in that town, and did not want to leave him. Barnum went\r\nto see the painter and found that he had not fully made up his\r\nmind whether to marry the woman or not. Thereupon the\r\nenterprising showman told the painter that if he would marry the\r\nwoman the next morning he would hire him for $25 a month as\r\npainter, and his bride at the same wages as cook, give them both\r\ntheir board and add a cash bonus of $50. There was a wedding on\r\nthe boat the next day, and they had a good cook and a good\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nDuring one evening performance at Francisville, Louisiana, a man\r\ntried to pass Barnum at the door of the tent, claiming that he\r\nhad paid for admittance. Barnum refused him entrance; and as he\r\nwas slightly intoxicated, he struck Barnum with a slung shot,\r\nmashing his hat and grazing what phrenologists call \"the organ of\r\ncaution.\" He went away and soon returned with a gang of armed and\r\nhalf-drunken companions, who ordered the showmen to pack up their\r\n\"traps and plunder\" and to get on board their steamboat within an\r\nhour. The big tent speedily came down. No one was permitted to\r\nhelp, but the company worked with a will, and within five minutes\r\nof the expiration of the hour they were on board and ready to\r\nleave. The scamps who had caused their departure escorted them\r\nand their last load, waving pine torches, and saluted them with a\r\nhurrah as they swung into the stream.\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans papers of March 19th, 1838, announced the arrival\r\nof the \"Steamer Ceres, Captain Barnum, with a theatrical\r\ncompany.\" After a week's performance, they started for the\r\nAttakapas country. At Opelousas they exchanged the steamer for\r\nsugar and molasses; the company was disbanded, and Barnum started\r\nfor home, arriving in New York. June 4th, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. HARD TIMES.\r\n\r\nADVERTISING FOR A PARTNER--\"QUAKER OATS\"--DIAMOND THE DANCER--A\r\nDISHONEST MANAGER--RETURN TO NEW YORK--FROM HAND TO MOUTH--THE\r\nAMERICAN MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nLooking around now for some permanent business, Barnum at last\r\nresorted to the expedient of advertising for a partner, stating\r\nthat he had $2,500 to invest, and was willing to add his entire\r\npersonal attention to the business. He was immediately\r\noverwhelmed with answers, the most of them coming from sharpers.\r\nOne was a counterfeiter who wanted $2,500 to invest in paper,\r\nink, and dies.\r\n\r\nOne applicant was a sedate individual dressed in sober drab; he\r\nproposed to buy a horse and wagon and sell oats in bags, trusting\r\nthat no one would be particular in measuring after a Quaker.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to cheat in measuring your oats?\" asked Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Quaker, with a significant leer, \"I shall\r\nprobably make them hold out.\"\r\n\r\nFinally Barnum decided to go into business with a good-looking,\r\nplausible German, named Proler, who was a manufacturer of\r\npaste-blacking, cologne, and bear's grease. They opened a store\r\nat No. 101 1/2 Bowery, where Proler manufactured the goods, and\r\nBarnum kept accounts and attended to sales in the store. The\r\nbusiness prospered, or appeared to, until the capital was\r\nexhausted, and early in 1840 Barnum sold out his interest to\r\nProler, taking the German's note for $2,600, which was all he\r\never got, Proler shortly afterward running away to Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nBarnum had formed the acquaintance of a very clever young dancer\r\nnamed John Diamond, and soon after leaving the paste-blacking\r\nenterprise, he gathered together a company of singers, etc.,\r\nwhich, with the dancer, Diamond, he placed in the hands of an\r\nagent, not caring to have his name appear in the transaction. He\r\nhired the Vauxhall Garden Saloon in New York and gave a variety\r\nof performances. This, however, proved unprofitable, and was\r\nabandoned after a few months.\r\n\r\nMuch as Barnum dreaded resuming the life of an itinerant showman,\r\nthere seemed nothing else to be done, so January 2d, 1841, found\r\nhim in New Orleans, with a company consisting of C. D. Jenkins,\r\nan excellent Yankee character artist; Diamond, the dancer; a\r\nviolinist, and one or two others. His brother-in-law, John\r\nHallett, acted as advance agent. The venture was fairly\r\nsuccessful, though after the first two weeks in New Orleans, the\r\nmanager and proprietor of the show was obliged to pledge his\r\nwatch as security for the board-bill. A dancing match between\r\nDiamond and a negro from Kentucky put nearly $500 into Barnum's\r\npocket, and they continued to prosper until Diamond, after\r\nextorting as much money as possible from his manager, finally ran\r\naway. The other members of the troop caused considerable trouble\r\nlater. Jenkins, the Yankee character man, went to St. Louis, and\r\nhaving enticed Francis Lynch, an orphan protege of Barnum's into\r\nthe scheme, proceeded to the Museum, where he exhibited Lynch as\r\nthe celebrated dancer, John Diamond. Barnum poured out his wrath\r\nat this swindler in a letter, for which Jenkins threatened suit,\r\nand actually did instigate R. W. Lindsay to bring an action\r\nagainst Barnum for a pipe of brandy, alleged to have been\r\nincluded in his contract. Being among strangers, Barnum had some\r\ndifficulty in procuring the $500 bond required, and was committed\r\nto jail until late in the afternoon. As soon as he was released,\r\nhe had Jenkins arrested for fraud, and then went on his way\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of eight months Barnum found himself back in New\r\nYork, resolved never again to be a traveling showman. Contracting\r\nwith the publisher, Robert Sears, for five hundred copies of\r\n\"Sear's Pictorial Illustrations of the Bible,\" and accepting the\r\nUnited States agency for the book, he opened an office at the\r\ncorner of Beekman and Nassau Streets. He advertised widely, had\r\nnumerous agents, and sold thousands of books, but for all that,\r\nlost money.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this business the Vauxhall Saloon was re-opened,\r\nunder the management of John Hallett, Mrs. Barnum's brother. At\r\nthe end of the season they had cleared about $200. This sum was\r\nsoon exhausted, and for the rest of the winter Barnum managed to\r\neke out a living by writing for the Sunday papers, and getting up\r\nunique advertisements for the Bowery Amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nHis ambition received a stimulus at last from a friend in\r\nDanbury, who held a mortgage on a piece of property owned by Mr.\r\nBarnum. Mr. Whittlesey wrote that as he was convinced of Mr.\r\nBarnum's inability to lay up money, he thought he might as well\r\ndemand the five hundred dollars then as at any time. Barnum's\r\nflagging energies were aroused, and he began in earnest to look\r\nfor some permanent investment.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Bowery Amphitheatre, the information came\r\nto him that the collection of curiosities comprising Scudder's\r\nAmerican Museum, at the corner of Broadway and Ann Streets, was\r\nfor sale. The original proprietor had spent $50,000 on it, and at\r\nhis death had left a large fortune as the result of the\r\nspeculation. It was now losing money and the heirs offered it for\r\nsale, at the low price of $15,000. Realizing that with tact,\r\nenergy, and liberality, the business might be made as profitable\r\nas ever, Barnum resolved to buy it.\r\n\r\n\"You buy the American Museum!\" exclaimed a friend to whom he\r\nconfided the scheme. \"What will you buy it with?\"\r\n\r\n\"With brass,\" answered Barnum, \"for silver and gold have I none.\"\r\n\r\nAnd buy it with brass he did, as the story of the transaction\r\ntestifies.\r\n\r\nThe Museum building belonged to Mr. Francis W. Olmsted, a retired\r\nmerchant, to whom he wrote, stating his desire to buy the\r\ncollection, and that although he had no means, if it could be\r\npurchased upon reasonable credit, he was confident that his tact\r\nand experience, added to a determined devotion to business, would\r\nenable him to make the payments when due. Barnum therefore asked\r\nhim to purchase the collection in his own name; to give a writing\r\nsecuring it to Barnum, provided he made the payments punctually,\r\nincluding the rent of his building; to allow Barnum twelve\r\ndollars and a half a week on which to support his family; and if\r\nat any time he failed to meet the installment due, he would\r\nvacate the premises, and forfeit all that might have been paid to\r\nthat date. \"In fact, Mr. Olmsted.\" Barnum continued, earnestly,\r\n\"you may bind me in any way, and as tightly as you please--only\r\ngive me a chance to dig out, or scratch out, and I will do so or\r\nforfeit all the labor and trouble I may have incurred.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this letter, which Barnum took to his house himself,\r\nMr. Olmsted named an hour when he could call on him. Barnum was\r\nthere at the exact moment, and Olmsted was pleased with his\r\npunctuality. He inquired closely as to Barnum's habits and\r\nantecedents, and the latter frankly narrated his experiences as a\r\ncaterer for the public, mentioning his amusement ventures in\r\nVauxhall Garden, the circus, and in the exhibitions he had\r\nmanaged at the South and West.\r\n\r\n\"Who are your references?\" Olmsted inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Any man in my line,\" Barnum replied, \"from Edmund Simpson,\r\nmanager of the Park Theatre, or William Niblo, to Messrs. Welch,\r\nJune, Titus, Turner, Angevine, or other circus or menagerie\r\nproprietors; also Moses Y. Beach, of the New York Sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you get any of them to call on me?\"\r\n\r\nBarnum told him that he could, and the next day Mr. Niblo rode\r\ndown and had an interview with Mr. Olmsted, while Mr. Beach and\r\nseveral other gentlemen also called. The following morning Barnum\r\nwaited upon him for his decision.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like your references, Mr. Barnum,\" said Mr. Olmsted,\r\nabruptly, as soon as he entered the room.\r\n\r\nBarnum was confused, and said, \"he regretted to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They all speak too well of you,\" Olmsted added, laughing; \"in\r\nfact, they all talk as if they were partners of yours, and\r\nintended to share the profits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could have pleased me better,\" says Barnum. \"He then\r\nasked me what security I could offer in case he concluded to make\r\nthe purchase for me, and it was finally agreed that, if he should\r\ndo so, he should retain the property till it was entirely paid\r\nfor, and should also appoint a ticket-taker and accountant (at my\r\nexpense), who should render him a weekly statement. I was further\r\nto take an apartment hitherto used as a billiard-room in his\r\nadjoining building, allowing therefor $500 a year, making a total\r\nrental of $3,000 per annum, on a lease of ten years. He then told\r\nme to see the administrator and heirs of the estate, to get their\r\nbest terms, and to meet him on his return to town a week from\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n\"I at once saw Mr. John Heath, the administrator, and his price\r\nwas $15,000. I offered $10,000, payable in seven annual\r\ninstallments, with good security. After several interviews, it\r\nwas finally agreed that I should have it for $12,000, payable as\r\nabove --possession to be given on the 15th of November. Mr.\r\nOlmsted assented to this, and a morning was appointed to draw and\r\nsign the writings. Mr. Heath appeared, but said he must decline\r\nproceeding any further in my case, as he had sold the collection\r\nto the directors of Peale's Museum (an incorporated institution)\r\nfor $15,000, and had received $1,000 in advance.\r\n\r\n\"I was shocked, and appealed to Mr. Heath's honor. He said that\r\nhe had signed no writing with me; was in no way legally bound,\r\nand that it was his duty to do the best he could for the heirs.\r\nMr. Olmsted was sorry but could not help me; the new tenants\r\nwould not require him to incur any risk, and my matter was at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I immediately informed myself as to the character of\r\nPeale's Museum Company. It proved to be a band of speculators who\r\nhad bought Peale's collection for a few thousand dollars,\r\nexpecting to unite the American Museum with it, issue and sell\r\nstock to the amount of $50,000, pocket $30,000 profits, and\r\npermit the stockholders to look out for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I went immediately to several of the editors, including Major M.\r\nM. Noah, M. Y. Beach, my good friends West, Herrick, and Ropes,\r\nof the Atlas, and others, and stated my grievances. 'Now,' said\r\nI, 'if you will grant me the use of your columns, I'll blow that\r\nspeculation sky-high.' They all consented, and I wrote a large\r\nnumber of squibs, cautioning the public against buying the Museum\r\nstock, ridiculing the idea of a board of broken-down bank\r\ndirectors engaging in the exhibition of stuffed monkeys and\r\ngander-skins; appealing to the case of the Zoological Institute,\r\nwhich had failed by adopting such a plan as the one now proposed;\r\nand finally, I told the public that such a speculation would be\r\ninfinitely more ridiculous than Dickens's 'Grand United\r\nMetropolitan Hot Muffin and Crumpit-baking and Punctual Delivery\r\nCompany.'\r\n\r\n\"The stock was 'as dead as a herring!' I then went to Mr. Heath\r\nand asked him when the directors were to pay the other $14,000.'\r\nOn the 26th day of December, or forfeit the $1,000 already paid,'\r\nwas the reply. I assured him that they would never pay it, that\r\nthey could not raise it, and that he would ultimately find\r\nhimself with the Museum collection on his hands, and if once I\r\nstarted off with an exhibition for the South, I could not touch\r\nthe Museum at ANY price. 'Now,' said I, 'if you will agree with\r\nme confidentially, that in case these gentlemen do not pay you on\r\nthe 26th of December I may have it on the 27th for $12,000, I\r\nwill run the risk, and wait in this city until that date.' He\r\nreadily agreed to the proposition, but said he was sure they\r\nwould not forfeit their $1,000.\r\n\r\n\" 'Very well,' said I; 'all I ask of you is, that this\r\narrangement shall not be mentioned.' He assented. 'On the 27th\r\nday of December, at ten o'clock A. M., I wish you to meet me in\r\nMr. Olmsted's apartments, prepared to sign the writings, provided\r\nthis incorporated company do not pay you $14,000 on the 26th. He\r\nagreed to this, and by my request put it in writing.\r\n\r\n\"From that moment I felt that the Museum was mine. I saw Mr.\r\nOlmsted, and told him so. He promised secrecy, and agreed to sign\r\nthe document if the other parties did not meet their engagement.\r\nThis was about November 15th, and I continued my shower of\r\nnewspaper squibs at the new company, which could not sell a\r\ndollar's worth of its stock. Meanwhile, if any one spoke to me\r\nabout the Museum, I simply replied that I had lost it.\"\r\n\r\nThis newspaper war against the Peales was kept up unceasingly\r\nuntil one morning in December, \"I received a letter from the\r\nsecretary of that company (now calling itself the 'New York\r\nMuseum Company'), requesting me to meet the directors at the\r\nMuseum on the following Monday morning. I went, and found the\r\ndirectors in session. The venerable president of the board, who\r\nwas also the ex-president of a broken bank, blandly proposed to\r\nhire me to manage the united museums, and though I saw that he\r\nmerely meant to buy my silence, I professed to entertain the\r\nproposition, and in reply to an inquiry as to what salary I\r\nshould expect, I specified the sum of $3,000 a year. This was at\r\nonce acceded to, the salary to begin January 1st, 1842, and after\r\ncomplimenting me on my ability, the president remarked: 'Of\r\ncourse, Mr. Barnum, we shall have no more of your squibs through\r\nthe newspapers.' To which I replied that I should 'ever try to\r\nserve the interests of my employers,' and I took my leave.\r\n\r\n\"It was as clear to me as noonday that, after buying my silence\r\nso as to appreciate their stock, these directors meant to sell\r\nout to whom they could, leaving me to look to future stockholders\r\nfor my salary. They thought, no doubt, that they had nicely\r\nentrapped me, but I knew I had caught them.\r\n\r\n\"For, supposing me to be out of the way, and having no other\r\nrival purchaser, these directors postponed the advertisement of\r\ntheir stock to give people time to forget the attacks I had made\r\non it, and they also took their own time for paying the money\r\npromised to Mr Heath, December 26th--indeed, they did not even\r\ncall on him at the appointed time. But on the following morning,\r\nas agreed, I was promptly and hopefully at Mr. Olmsted's\r\napartments with my legal adviser, at half-past nine o'clock; Mr.\r\nHeath came with his lawyer at ten, and before two o'clock that\r\nday I was in formal possession of the American Museum. My first\r\nmanagerial act was to write and dispatch the following\r\ncomplimentary note:\r\n\r\n \" 'AMERICAN MUSEUM, NEW YORK, Dec. 27th, 1841.\r\n\" 'To the President and Directors of the New York Museum:\r\n\r\n\" 'GENTLEMEN: It gives me great pleasure to inform you that you\r\nare placed upon the Free List of this establishment until furthur\r\nnotice.\r\n                             \" 'P. T. BARNUM, Proprietor.'\r\n\r\n\"It is unnecessary to say that the 'President of the New York\r\nMuseum' was astounded, and when he called upon Mr. Heath, and\r\nlearned that I had bought and was really in possession of the\r\nAmerican Museum, he was indignant. He talked of prosecution, and\r\ndemanded the $1,000 paid on his agreement, but he did not\r\nprosecute, and he justly forfeited his deposit money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nADVERTISING EXTRAORDINARY--A QUICK-WITTED PERFORMER--NIAGARA\r\nFALLS WITH REAL WATER--OTHER ATTRACTIONS--DRUMMOND LIGHTS.\r\n\r\nWith great hopes for the success of his project, Barnum entered\r\nupon the management of the Museum. It was a new epoch in his\r\ncareer, he felt that the opportunity of his life had presented\r\nitself--in the show business, to be sure, but in a permanent,\r\nsubstantial phase of it.\r\n\r\nHe must pay for the establishment within the stipulated time, or\r\nforfeit all he had paid on account. A rigid plan of economy was\r\ndetermined upon, his wife agreeing to support the family on $600\r\na year, or even on four hundred if necessary. Barnum himself made\r\nevery possible personal retrenchment. One day, some six months\r\nafter the purchase had been made, Mr. Olmsted happened into the\r\nticket office, while the proprietor was eating his lunch of cold\r\ncorned beef and bread.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you eat for dinner?\" asked Mr. Olmsted.\r\n\r\n\"I have not eaten a warm dinner, except on Sundays, since I\r\nbought the Museum,\" was the reply, \"and I don't intend to, until\r\nI am out of debt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Mr. Olmsted, heartily, \"and you'll pay for\r\nthe Museum before the year is out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was right.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of this establishment, Scudder's Museum, was formed\r\nin 1810. It was begun in Chatham Street, and was afterward\r\ntransferred to the old City Hall, and from small beginnings, by\r\npurchases, and to a considerable degree by presents, it had grown\r\nto be a large and valuable collection. People in all parts of the\r\ncountry had sent in relics and rare curiosities. Sea captains for\r\nyears had brought and deposited strange things from foreign\r\nlands; and besides all these gifts, the previous proprietor had\r\nactually expended, as was stated, $50,000 in making the\r\ncollection, which valuable as it was when Barnum bought it, was\r\nonly the beginning of its subsequent greatness. In 1842 the\r\nentire contents of Peale's Museum was purchased, and in 1850 the\r\nPeale collection of Philadelphia was added. In 1865 the space\r\noccupied for museum purposes was more than twice as large as in\r\n1842. The Lecture Room, originally narrow, ill-contrived, and\r\ninconvenient, was so enlarged and improved that it became one of\r\nthe most commodious and beautiful amusement halls in the city of\r\nNew York. At first the attractions and inducements were merely\r\nthe collection of curiosities by day, and an evening\r\nentertainment, consisting of such variety performances as were\r\ncurrent in ordinary shows. Then Saturday afternoons and, soon\r\nafterward, Wednesday afternoons, were devoted to entertainments,\r\nand the popularity of the Museum grew so rapidly that it was\r\npresently found expedient and profitable to open the great\r\nLecture Room every afternoon, as well as every evening, on every\r\nweekday in the year. The first experiments in this direction more\r\nthan justified expectations, for the day exhibitions were always\r\nmore thronged than those of the evening.\r\n\r\nHolidays, of course, were made the most of, and there is a record\r\nof twelve performances, to as many audiences, being given in one\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the character of the stage performances were changed.\r\nThe transient attractions of the Museum were constantly\r\ndiversified, and educated dogs, industrious fleas, automatons,\r\njugglers, ventriloquists, living statuary, tableaux, gypsies,\r\nAlbinoes, fat boys, giants, dwarfs, rope-dancers, live \"Yankees,\"\r\npantomime, instrumental music, singing and dancing in great\r\nvariety, dioramas, panoramas, models of Niagara, Dublin, Paris,\r\nand Jerusalem; Hannington's dioramas of the Creation, the Deluge,\r\nFairy Grotto, Storm at Sea; the first English Punch and Judy in\r\nthis country, Italian Fantoceini, mechanical figures, fancy\r\nglass-blowing, knitting machines, and other triumphs in the\r\nmechanical arts; dissolving views, American Indians, who enacted\r\ntheir warlike and religious ceremonies on the stage--these, among\r\nothers, were all exceedingly successful.\r\n\r\nNo man ever understood the art of advertising better than Barnum.\r\nKnowing that mammon is ever caught with glare, he took pains that\r\nhis posters should be larger, his transparencies more brilliant,\r\nhis puffing more persistent than anybody elses. And if he\r\nresorted to hyperbole at times in his advertisements, it was\r\nalways his boast that no one ever went away from his Museum,\r\nwithout having received the worth of his money. It used to amuse\r\nMr. Barnum later in life, to relate some of the unique\r\nadvertising dodges which his inventive genius devised. Here is a\r\nfair sample, as he once told it:\r\n\r\n\"One morning a stout, hearty-looking man came into my\r\nticket-office and begged some money. I asked him why he did not\r\nwork and earn his living? He replied that he could get nothing to\r\ndo, and that he would be glad of any job at a dollar a day. I\r\nhanded him a quarter of a dollar, told him to go and get his\r\nbreakfast and return, and I would employ him, at light labor, at\r\na dollar and a half a day. When he returned I gave him five\r\ncommon bricks.\r\n\r\n\" 'Now,' said I, 'go and lay a brick on the sidewalk, at the\r\ncorner of Broadway and Ann Street; another close by the Museum; a\r\nthird diagonally across the way, at the corner of Broadway and\r\nVesey Street, by the Astor House; put down the fourth on the\r\nsidewalk, in front of St. Paul's Church opposite; then, with the\r\nfifth brick in hand, take up a rapid march from one point to the\r\nother, making the circuit, exchanging your brick at every point,\r\nand say nothing to any one.'\r\n\r\n\" 'What is the object of this?' inquired the man.\r\n\r\n\" 'No matter,' I replied: 'all you need to know is that it brings\r\nyou fifteen cents wages per hour. It is a bit of my fun, and to\r\nassist me properly you must seem to be as deaf as a post; wear a\r\nserious countenance; answer no questions; pay no attention to any\r\none; but attend faithfully to the work, and at the end of every\r\nhour, by St. Paul's clock, show this ticket at the Museum door;\r\nenter, walking solemnly through every hall in the building; pass\r\nout, and resume your work.' \"\r\n\r\nWith the remark that \"it was all one to him, so long as he could\r\nearn his living,\" the man placed his bricks, and began his round.\r\nHalf an hour afterward, at least five hundred people were\r\nwatching his mysterious movements. He had assumed a military step\r\nand bearing, and, looking as sober as a judge, he made no\r\nresponse whatever to the constant inquiries as to the object of\r\nhis singular conduct. At the end of the first hour, the sidewalks\r\nin the vicinity were packed with people, all anxious to solve the\r\nmystery. The man, as directed, then went into the Museum,\r\ndevoting fifteen minutes to a solemn survey of the halls, and\r\nafterward returning to his round. This was repeated every hour\r\nuntil sundown, and whenever the man went into the Museum a dozen\r\nor more persons would buy tickets and follow him, hoping to\r\ngratify their curiosity in regard to the purpose of his\r\nmovements. This was continued for several days--the curious\r\npeople who followed the man into the Museum considerably more\r\nthan paying his wages--till finally the policeman, to whom Barnum\r\nhad imparted his object, complained that the obstruction of the\r\nsidewalk by crowds, had become so serious that he must call in\r\nhis \"brick man.\" This trivial incident excited considerable talk\r\nand amusement; it advertised Barnum; and it materially advanced\r\nhis purpose of making a lively corner near the Museum.\r\n\r\nBarnum realized above all that to have people pleased with his\r\nattractions was the best advertisement he could possibly have,\r\nand he tried honestly to keep the Museum supplied with every\r\nnovelty. A curiosity which possessed some merit, and considerable\r\nabsurdity was the celebrated model of Niagara, \"with real water.\"\r\n\r\nOne day the enterprising proprietor was called before the Board\r\nof Water Commissioners, and informed that he must pay a large\r\nextra compensation for the immense amount of water that supplied\r\nhis Niagara. To the astonishment of the Board Mr. Barnum gave his\r\nassurance that a single barrel of water per month served to run\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nApropos of this wonderful model, Barnum used to tell how he got\r\neven with his friend, Louis Gaylord Clark, editor of the\r\nKnickerbocker, an inveterate joker, and who was fond of guying\r\nthe Museum. The first time Clark viewed \"Niagara\" he assumed\r\ngreat admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Barnum, I declare, this is quite an idea; I never saw the\r\nlike of this before in all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\" inquired Barnum, quite pleased.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Clark, fervently, \"and I hope to the Lord, I never\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum might have forgiven this, but Clark's next joke was too\r\nmuch to bear. He came in one day and asked Barnum if he had the\r\nclub with which Captain Cook was killed. The Museum boasted a\r\nlarge collection of Indian curiosities, and Barnum showed one\r\nwarlike weapon which he assured Clark was the identical club and\r\nhe had all the documents to prove it.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Cook! Poor Cook!\" said Clark, musingly. \"Well, Mr. Barnum,\"\r\nhe continued, with great gravity, at the same time extending his\r\nhand, \"I am really very much obliged to you for your kindness. I\r\nhad an irrepressible desire to see the club that killed Captain\r\nCook, and I felt quite confident you could accommodate me. I have\r\nbeen in half a dozen smaller museums, and as they all had it, I\r\nwas sure a large establishment like yours would not be without\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut Barnum's turn came. A few weeks afterward, he wrote to Clark\r\nthat if he would come to his office he was anxious to consult him\r\non a matter of great importance. He came, and Barnum said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, I don't want any of your nonsense, but I want your sober\r\nadvice.\"\r\n\r\nClark assured him that he would serve him in any way in his\r\npower, and Barnum proceeded to tell him about a wonderful fish\r\nfrom the Nile, offered for exhibition at $100 a week, the owner\r\nof which was willing to forfeit $5,000, if, within six weeks,\r\nthis fish did not pass through a transformation in which the tail\r\nwould disappear and the fish would then have legs.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible!\" asked the astonished Clark.\r\n\r\nBarnum assured him that there was no doubt of it.\r\n\r\nThereupon Clark advised Barnum to engage the wonder at any price;\r\nthat it would startle the naturalists, wake up the whole\r\nscientific world, draw in the masses, and make $20,000 for the\r\nMuseum. Barnum told him that he thought well of the speculation,\r\nonly he did not like the name of the fish.\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference whatever,\" said Clark; \"what is the\r\nname of the fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tadpole,\" Barnum replied, with becoming gravity, \"but it is\r\nvulgarly called 'pollywog.' \"\r\n\r\n\"Sold, by thunder!\" exclaimed Clark, and he left.\r\n\r\nAnother story is illustrative of some of the trials incident to\r\ntheatrical management.\r\n\r\nAn actor named La Rue presented himself as an imitator of\r\ncelebrated histrionic personages, including Macready, Forrest,\r\nKemble, the elder Booth, Kean, Hamblin, and others. Taking him\r\ninto the green-room for a private rehearsal, and finding his\r\nimitations excellent, Barnum engaged him. For three nights he\r\ngave great satisfaction, but early in the fourth evening he\r\nstaggered into the Museum so drunk that he could hardly stand,\r\nand in half an hour he must be on the stage! Barnum called an\r\nassistant, and they took La Rue and marched him up Broadway as\r\nfar as Chambers Street, and back to the lower end of the Park,\r\nhoping to sober him. At this point they put his head under a pump\r\nand gave him a good ducking, with visible beneficial effect, then\r\na walk around the Park and another ducking, when he assured them\r\nthat he should be able to give his imitations \"to a charm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You drunken brute,\" said Barnum, \"if you fail, and disappoint my\r\naudience, I will throw you out of the window.\"\r\n\r\nHe declared that he was \"all right,\" and Barnum led him behind\r\nthe scenes, where he waited with considerable trepidation to\r\nwatch his movements on the stage. La Rue began by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen: I will now give you an imitation of Mr.\r\nBooth, the eminent tragedian.\"\r\n\r\nHis tongue was thick, his language somewhat incoherent, and\r\nBarnum had great misgivings as he proceeded; but as no token of\r\ndisapprobation came from the audience, he began to hope he would\r\ngo through with his parts without exciting suspicion of his\r\ncondition. But before he had half finished his representation of\r\nBooth, in the soliloquy in the opening act of Richard III, the\r\nhouse discovered that he was very drunk, and began to hiss. This\r\nonly seemed to stimulate him to make an effort to appear sober,\r\nwhich, as is usual in such cases, only made matters worse, and\r\nthe hissing increased. Barnum lost all patience, and, going on\r\nthe stage and taking the drunken fellow by the collar, apologized\r\nto the audience, assuring them that he should not appear before\r\nthem again. Barnum was about to march him off, when he stepped to\r\nthe front, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Booth has often appeared on the stage\r\nin a state of inebriety, and I was simply giving you a truthful\r\nrepresentation of him on such occasions. I beg to be permitted to\r\nproceed with my imitations.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience at once supposed it was all right, and cried out,\r\n\"go on, go on\"; which he did, and at every imitation of Booth,\r\nwhether as Richard, Shylock, or Sir Giles Overreach, he received\r\na hearty round of applause. Barnum was quite delighted with his\r\nsuccess; but when he came to imitate Forrest and Hamblin,\r\nnecessarily representing them as drunk also, the audience could\r\nbe no longer deluded; the hissing was almost deafening, and\r\nBarnum was forced to lead the actor off. It was his last\r\nappearance on that stage.\r\n\r\nBarnum always denied that the \"Feejee Mermaid,\" which attained\r\nsuch lasting notoriety, was an invention of his own. It was first\r\nexhibited in London in 1822, where it was purchased by Mr. Moses\r\nKimball, of the Boston Museum, who sold it to Barnum. The\r\ncreature was really most ingeniously constructed, probably by\r\nsome Japanese. It drew like magic, and afterward served as a good\r\nadvertisement, sent throughout the country for exhibition, the\r\nposters reading, \"From Barnum's Great American Museum, New York.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum believed in making his place of exhibition as attractive\r\nas possible, and the building was decorated with flags and\r\nbanners, the posters were of the most sensational character, and\r\nthe first \"Drummond Lights\" ever seen in New York were placed on\r\ntop of the Museum, flooding the streets around with brilliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. INCREASED POPULARITY OF THE MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN FLAG AND ST. PAUL'S--ST, PATRICK'S DAY--THE BABY\r\nSHOW--GRAND BUFFALO HUNT--N. P. WILLIS--THE FIRST WILD-WEST SHOW.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the American Museum rose higher and higher. It is\r\ndoubtful if any place of entertainment ever attracted such\r\nenthusiastic crowds. It was the first place visited by strangers\r\nin the city.\r\n\r\nThe small Lecture Room had been converted into a large and\r\nbeautiful theatre, and in it many afterward celebrated actors and\r\nactresses made their first appearance; Sothern, Barney Williams,\r\nand the charming Mary Garmon. On holidays there were lecture\r\nperformances every hour. The actors kept on their stage clothes\r\nfrom eleven o'clock in the morning until ten at night, their\r\nmeals were served in the green-room, and the company received\r\nextra pay.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of July, 1842, was a great day in the history of the\r\nMuseum. Barnum had planned a magnificent display of American\r\nflags, as one of the outside attractions, and applied to the\r\nvestrymen of St. Paul's Church, opposite the Museum, for\r\npermission to attach his flag-rope to a tree in the church-yard.\r\nTheir reply was an indignant refusal. Returning to the Museum,\r\nBarnum directed that his original order concerning the\r\ndisposition of the flags be carried out to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned, and the crowds on Broadway were admiring the\r\ndisplay, when two representatives of the baffled vestry rushed\r\ninto the office and demanded that the ropes be taken down. \"The\r\nChurch of St. Paul's, where Washington worshiped, attached to a\r\nMuseum! Sacrilege!\"\r\n\r\nBarnum assumed a conciliatory tone, reminding them that he always\r\nstopped his band playing during their week-day services, and\r\nsuggesting the fairness of the obligation being made mutual.\r\n\r\n\"If those flags are not down in ten minutes,\" cried one of the\r\nvestrymen, \"I will cut them down.\"\r\n\r\nThen Barnum sprang to his feet and exclaimed loudly enough for\r\nthe crowd to hear:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mister, I should just like to see you dare to cut down the\r\nAmerican flag on the Fourth of July; you must be a 'Britisher' to\r\nmake such a threat as that; but I'll show you a thousand pairs of\r\nYankee hands in two minutes, if you dare to attempt to take down\r\nthe Stars and Stripes on this great birthday of American\r\nfreedom!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that John Bull a-saying?\" asked a brawny fellow, placing\r\nhimself in front of the irate vestryman. \"Look here, old fellow,\"\r\nhe continued, \"if you want to save a whole bone in your body, you\r\nhad better slope, and never dare to talk again about hauling down\r\nthe American flag in the city of New York.\"\r\n\r\nThrongs of excited, exasperated men crowded around, and the\r\nvestryman, seeing the effect of the ruse, smiled faintly and\r\nsaid, \"Oh, of course it is all right,\" and he and his companion\r\nquietly edged out of the crowd.\r\n\r\nBy one o'clock that day, the Museum was so densely packed that no\r\nmore visitors could be admitted, and the proprietor saw with\r\ndespair the crowds being turned away from the door. Rushing\r\ndown-stairs, he directed the carpenter to cut down the partition\r\nand floor in the rear and to put in a temporary flight of stairs.\r\nThe egress was ready by three o'clock, and people poured out into\r\nAnn Street, while the crowd from Broadway poured in. After that,\r\nthe egress was always ready on holidays. One of Barnum's most\r\namusing reminiscences related to this egress.\r\n\r\n\"Early in the following March I received notice from some of the\r\nIrish population that they meant to visit me in great numbers on\r\n'St. Patrick's day in the morning.' 'All right,' said I to my\r\ncarpenter, 'get your egress ready for March 17th;' and I added,\r\nto my assistant manager: 'If there is much of a crowd, don't let\r\na single person pass out at the front, even if it were St.\r\nPatrick himself; put every man out through the egress in the\r\nrear.' The day came, and before noon we were caught in the same\r\ndilemma as we were on the Fourth of July; the Museum was jammed,\r\nand the sale of tickets was stopped. I went to the egress and\r\nasked the sentinel how many hundreds had passed out?\r\n\r\n\" 'Hundreds,' he replied, 'why only three persons have gone out\r\nby this way, and they came back, saying that it was a mistake and\r\nbegging to be let in again.'\r\n\r\n\" 'What does this mean?' I inquired; 'surely thousands of people\r\nhave been all over the Museum since they came in.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Certainly,' was the reply; 'but after they have gone from one\r\nsaloon to another, and have been on every floor, even to the\r\nroof, they come down and travel the same route over again.'\r\n\r\n\"At this time I espied a tall Irish woman with two good-sized\r\nchildren whom I had happened to notice when they came in early in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\" 'Step this way, madam,' said I, politely; 'you will never be\r\nable to get into the street by the front door without crushing\r\nthese dear children. We have opened a large egress here, and you\r\ncan thus pass by these rear stairs into Ann Street, and thus\r\navoid all danger.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Sure,' replied the woman, indignantly, 'an' I'm not going out\r\nat all, at all, nor the children either, for we've brought our\r\ndinners and we are going to stay all day.'\r\n\r\n\"Further investigation showed that pretty much all of the\r\nvisitors had brought their dinners with the evident intention of\r\nliterally 'making a day of it.' No one expected to go home till\r\nnight; the building was overcrowded, and hundreds were waiting at\r\nthe front entrance to get in when they could. In despair, I\r\nsauntered upon the stage behind the scenes, biting my lips with\r\nvexation, when I happened to see the scene-painter at work, and a\r\nhappy thought struck me. 'Here,' I exclaimed, 'take a piece of\r\ncanvas four feet square and paint on it, as soon as you can, in\r\nlarge letters,\r\n\r\n                {pointing finger} TO THE EGRESS.'\r\n\r\n\"Seizing his brush, he finished the sign in fifteen minutes, and\r\nI directed the carpenter to nail it over the door leading to the\r\nback stairs. He did so, and as the crowd, after making the entire\r\ntour of the establishment, came pouring down the main stairs from\r\nthe third-story, they stopped and looked at the new sign, while\r\nsome of them read audibly: 'To the Aigress.'\r\n\r\n\" 'The Aigress,' said others, 'sure that's an animal we haven't\r\nseen,' and the throng began to pour down the back-stairs only to\r\nfind that the 'Aigress ' was the elephant, and that the elephant\r\nwas all out o' doors, or so much of it as began with Ann Street.\r\nMeanwhile, I began to accommodate those who had long been waiting\r\nwith their money at the Broadway entrance.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum had planned to expend the entire profits of the first year\r\nin advertising, but so fast did the money pour in, that he was\r\noften embarrassed to devise means to get rid of it, according to\r\nhis first idea. One of the most expensive advertisements\r\nconsisted of a large number of oil paintings of every animal in\r\nzoology. These paintings were prepared secretly, and were put\r\nbetween the windows of the building at night. The town was\r\nparalyzed with astonishment, and the daily receipts took an\r\nupward jump of nearly a hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nFlower shows, dog shows, poultry and bird shows, with prizes to\r\nthe best specimens, had long been features of the Museum, and at\r\nlast Barnum rashly decided on a baby show. There was a prize of\r\none hundred dollars attached, and a committee of ladies were\r\nappointed to decide on the best baby. The unsuspecting Barnum\r\nstepped into the circle and announced the prize winner, but to\r\nhis astonishment the verdict did not suit anybody but the mother\r\nof one baby. The other ninety-nine indignant mothers \"jumped on\"\r\nto Mr Barnum and the committee, and denounced the whole\r\nproceeding as impartial and unjust. Barnum offered to let them\r\nselect a new committee, and even agreed to give another hundred\r\ndollar prize, but the storm raged with unabating fury. There were\r\nbaby shows after that, but the verdict was delivered in writing,\r\nand Mr. Barnum never gave the prize in person.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1843, a herd of yearling buffaloes was on exhibition in\r\nBoston. Barnum bought the lot, brought them to New Jersey, hired\r\nthe race-course at Hoboken, chartered the ferry-boats for one\r\nday, and advertised that a hunter had arrived with a herd of\r\nbuffaloes, and that august 31st there would be a \"Grand Buffalo\r\nHunt\" on the Hoboken race-course--all persons to be admitted free\r\nof charge.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day was warm and delightful, and no less than\r\ntwenty-four thousand people crossed the North River in the\r\nferry-boats to enjoy the cooling breeze and to see the \"Grand\r\nBuffalo Hunt.\" The hunter was dressed as an Indian, and mounted\r\non horseback; he proceeded to show how the wild buffalo is\r\ncaptured with a lasso, but unfortunately the yearlings would not\r\nrun till the crowd gave a great shout, expressive at once of\r\nderision and delight at the harmless humbug. This shout started\r\nthe young animals into a weak gallop and the lasso was duly\r\nthrown over the head of the largest calf. The crowd roared with\r\nlaughter, listened to the balcony band, which was also furnished\r\n\"free,\" and then started for New York, little dreaming who was\r\nthe author of this sensation, or what was its object.\r\n\r\nMr. N. P. Willis, then editor of the Home Journal, wrote an\r\narticle illustrating the perfect good nature with which the\r\nAmerican public submit to a clever humbug. He said that he went\r\nto Hoboken to witness the buffalo hunt. It was nearly four\r\no'clock when the boat left the foot of Barclay Street, and it was\r\nso densely crowded that many persons were obliged to stand on the\r\nrailings and hold on to the awning-posts. When they reached the\r\nHoboken side a boat equally crowded was coming out of the slip.\r\nThe passengers just arriving cried out to those who were coming\r\naway, \"Is the buffalo hunt over?\" To which came the reply, \"Yes,\r\nand it was the biggest humbug you ever heard of!\" Willis added\r\nthat passengers on the boat with him instantly gave three cheers\r\nfor the author of the humbug, whoever he might be.\r\n\r\nAfter the public had enjoyed their laugh over the Buffalo hunt,\r\nBarnum let it become known that he was the author of the joke. Of\r\ncourse, their cry of \"charlatan,\" \"humbug,\" and \"swindler\" was\r\nlouder than ever from that time, but Barnum never objected to\r\nbeing celled names. The more advertising the better.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Barnum engaged a band of Indians from Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe party comprised large and noble specimens of the untutored\r\nsavage, as well as several very beautiful squaws, with two or\r\nthree interesting \"papooses.\" They lived and lodged in a large\r\nroom on the top floor of the Museum, and cooked their own\r\nvictuals in their own way. They gave their war-dances on the\r\nstage in the Lecture Room with great vigor and enthusiasm, much\r\nto the satisfaction of the audiences. But these wild Indians\r\nseemed to consider their dances as realities. Hence, when they\r\ngave a real war-dance, it was dangerous for any parties, except\r\ntheir manager and interpreter to be on the stage, for the moment\r\nthey had finished their war-dance, they began to leap and peer\r\nabout behind the scenes in search of victims for their tomahawks\r\nand scalping knives! Indeed, lest in these frenzied moments they\r\nmight make a dash at the orchestra or the audience, Barnum had a\r\nhigh rope barrier placed between them and the savages on the\r\nfront of the stage.\r\n\r\nBarnum counted one incident in connection with his Indian show as\r\nnotable, being one of the few occasions when he played the losing\r\ncard.\r\n\r\n\"After they had been a week in the Museum,\" he said, \"I proposed\r\na change of performance for the week following by introducing new\r\ndances. Among these was the Indian wedding dance. At that time I\r\nprinted but one set of posters (large bills) per week, so that\r\nwhatever was announced for Monday was repeated every day and\r\nevening during that week. Before the wedding dance came off on\r\nMonday afternoon, I was informed that I was to provide a large,\r\nnew, red woolen blanket, at a cost of ten dollars, for the\r\nbridegroom to present to the father of the bride. I ordered the\r\npurchase to be made, but was considerably taken aback when I was\r\ninformed that I must have another new blanket for the evening,\r\ninasmuch as the savage old Indian chief, father-in-law to the\r\nbridegroom, would not consent to his daughter's being approached\r\nwith the wedding dance unless he had his blanket present,\r\n\r\n\"I undertook to explain to the chief, through the interpreter,\r\nthat this was only a 'make believe' wedding; but the old savage\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and gave such a terrific 'Ugh!' that I\r\nwas glad to make my peace by ordering another blanket. As we gave\r\ntwo performances per day, I was out of pocket $120 for twelve\r\n'wedding blankets' that week.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the beautiful squaws named Do-humme died in the Museum.\r\nShe had been a great favorite with many ladies. Do-humme was\r\nburied on the border of Sylvan Water, at Greenwood Cemetery,\r\nwhere a small monument erected by her friends, designates her\r\nlast resting-place. The poor Indians were very sorrowful for many\r\ndays, and desired to get back again to their Western wilds. The\r\nfather and the betrothed of Do-humme cooked various dishes of\r\nfood and placed them upon the roof of the Museum, where they\r\nbelieved the spirit of their departed friend came daily for its\r\nsupply; and these dishes were renewed every morning during the\r\nstay of the Indians at the Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. GIANTS AND DWARFS.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE FOR THE PUBLIC--MESMERISM EXTRAORDINARY--KILLING OF A\r\nRIVAL--THE TWO GIANTS--DISCOVERY OF \"TOM THUMB\"--SEEKING OTHER\r\nWORLDS TO CONQUER--FIRST VISIT TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBarnum would never submit to being outdone by a rival. In \"poker\"\r\nparlance, he would \"see him and go one better.\" His chief\r\ncompetitor now was Peale, who was running Peale's Museum, and\r\nproudly proclaiming it to be a more scientific institution than\r\nBarnum's. Thus, he said, he was catering to a higher class of\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\n\"Science, indeed!\" said Barnum. \"I'll give him science to his\r\nheart's content!\"\r\n\r\nMesmerism was then a great novelty, and Peale was given\r\nexhibitions of it. He had one subject on whom he operated daily,\r\nwith most surprising results; though at times she was\r\nunimpressionable, and the people who had paid to come in and see\r\nher performances complained loudly that they were being swindled.\r\nBarnum saw here a great opportunity to squelch a rival and\r\nincrease his own fame at a single stroke. He engaged a bright\r\nlittle girl who was exceedingly susceptible to such mesmeric\r\ninfluences as he could induce. That is, she learned her lesson\r\nthoroughly, and when he had apparently put her to sleep with a\r\nfew passes and stood behind her, she seemed to be duly\r\n\"impressed,\" as he desired; raised her hands as he willed, fell\r\nfrom her chair to the floor; and if he put candy or tobacco into\r\nhis own mouth, she was duly delighted or disgusted. She never\r\nfailed in these routine performances. Strange to say, believers\r\nin mesmerism used to witness her performances with the greatest\r\npleasure, and adduce them as positive proofs that there was\r\nsomething in mesmerism, and they applauded tremendously--up to a\r\ncertain point.\r\n\r\nThat point was reached when, leaving the girl \"asleep,\" Barnum\r\ncalled up some one in the audience, promising to put him \"in the\r\nsame state\" within five minutes, or forfeit fifty dollars. Of\r\ncourse, all his \"passes\" would not put a man in the mesmeric\r\nstate; at the end of three minutes he was as wide awake as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" Barnum would say, \"looking at his watch; \"I have\r\ntwo minutes more, and meantime, to show that a person in this\r\nstate is utterly insensible to pain, I propose to cut off one of\r\nthe fingers of the little girl who is still asleep.\" He would\r\nthen take out a knife and feel of the edge, and when he turned\r\naround to the girl whom he left on the chair, she had fled behind\r\nthe scenes, to the intense amusement of the greater part of the\r\naudience, and to the amazement of the mesmerists who were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"Why! where's my little girl?\" he asked, with feigned\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! she ran away when you began to talk about cutting off\r\nfingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she was wide awake, was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she was, all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so; and, my dear sir, I promised that you should be\r\n'in the same state' at the end of five minutes, and as I believe\r\nyou are so, I do not forfeit fifty dollars.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum kept up this performance for several weeks, till he quite\r\nkilled Peale's \"genuine\" mesmerism in the rival establishment. At\r\nthe end of six months he bought Peale's Museum, and the whole,\r\nincluding the splendid gallery of American portraits, was removed\r\nto the American Museum, and he immediately advertised the great\r\ncard of a \"Double Attraction,\" and \"Two Museums in One,\" without\r\nextra charge.\r\n\r\nBarnum was now devoting all his attention and energy to this\r\nenterprise, and was achieving great success. He made everything\r\ncontribute to its popularity. When a politician asked him for\r\nwhat candidate he was going to vote, he would answer, \"For the\r\nAmerican Museum;\" and this was an index of his whole demeanor.\r\n\r\nAmong the genuine and literally \"great\" features of his show were\r\nseveral giants. They often gave both the showman and his patrons\r\nfood for much amusement as well as wonder. The Quaker giant,\r\nHales, was quite a wag in his way. He went once to see the new\r\nhouse of an acquaintance who had suddenly become rich, but who\r\nwas a very ignorant man. When he came back he described the\r\nwonders of the mansion, and said that the proud proprietor showed\r\nhim everything from basement to attic; parlors, bed-rooms,\r\ndining-room, and, said Hales, \"what he calls his\r\n'study'--meaning, I suppose, the place where he intends to study\r\nhis spelling-book!\"\r\n\r\nHe had at one time two famous men, the French giant, M. Bihin, a\r\nvery slim man, and the Arabian giant, Colonel Goshen. These men\r\ngenerally got on together very well, though, of course, each was\r\njealous of the other, and of the attention the rival received, or\r\nthe notice he attracted. One day they quarreled, and a lively\r\ninterchange of compliments ensued, the Arabian calling the\r\nFrenchman a \"Shanghai,\" and receiving in return the epithet of\r\n\"Nigger.\" From words both were eager to proceed to blows, and\r\nboth ran to the collection of arms, one seizing the club with\r\nwhich Captain Cook, or any other man, might have been killed, if\r\nit were judiciously wielded, and the other laying hands on a\r\nsword of the terrific size which is supposed to have been\r\nconventional in the days of the Crusades.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for a deadly encounter, and the high words of\r\nthe contending parties, brought a dozen of the Museum attaches to\r\nthe spot, and these men threw themselves between the gigantic\r\ncombatants. Hearing the disturbance, Barnum ran from his private\r\noffice to the dueling ground, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Look here! This is all right; if you want to fight each other,\r\nmaiming and perhaps killing one or both of you, that is your\r\naffair; but my interest lies here: you are both under engagement\r\nto me, and if this duel is to come off, I and the public have a\r\nright to participate. It must be duly advertised, and must take\r\nplace on the stage of the Lecture Room. No performance of yours\r\nwould be a greater attraction, and if you kill each other, our\r\nengagement can end with your duel.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition, made in apparent earnest, so delighted the\r\ngiants that they at once burst into a laugh, shook hands, and\r\nquarreled no more.\r\n\r\nFrom giants to dwarfs. None of Barnum's attractions has been more\r\nfamous than \"Tom Thumb.\" The story of his discovery and\r\nengagement is dated in November, 1842. Barnum was then at\r\nBridgeport, Conn. One day he heard that there belonged in one of\r\nthe families of the place a phenomenally small child, and he got\r\nhis brother, Philo F. Barnum, to bring the little fellow to his\r\nhotel. \"He was,\" Barnum afterward said, \"not two feet high; he\r\nweighed less than sixteen pounds, and was the smallest child I\r\never saw that could walk alone; he was a perfectly formed\r\nbright-eyed little fellow, with light hair and ruddy cheeks, and\r\nhe enjoyed the best of health. He was exceedingly bashful, but\r\nafter some coaxing, he was induced to talk with me, and he told\r\nme that he was the son of Sherwood E. Stratton, and that his own\r\nname was Charles S. Stratton. After seeing him and talking with\r\nhim, I at once determined to secure his services from his parents\r\nand to exhibit him in public. I engaged him for four weeks, at\r\nthree dollars a week, with all traveling and boarding charges for\r\nhimself and his mother at my expense. They came to New York\r\nThanksgiving day, December 8th, 1842, and I announced the dwarf\r\non my Museum bills as 'General Tom Thumb.' \"\r\n\r\nBarnum took the greatest pains to educate and train the\r\ndiminutive prodigy, devoting many hours to the task by day and by\r\nnight, and he was very successful, for the boy was an apt pupil,\r\nwith a great deal of native talent, and a keen sense of the\r\nludicrous. Barnum afterward re-engaged him for one year, at seven\r\ndollars a week with a gratuity of fifty dollars at the end of the\r\nengagement, and the privilege of exhibiting him anywhere in the\r\nUnited States, in which event his parents were to accompany him\r\nand Barnum was to pay all traveling expenses. He speedily became\r\na public favorite, and long before the year was out, Barnum\r\nvoluntarily increased his weekly salary to twenty-five dollars,\r\nand he fairly earned it.\r\n\r\nFor two years Barnum had been the owner of the Museum. He had\r\nenjoyed great prosperity. Long ago he had paid every dollar of\r\nthe purchase-money out of the profits of the place. All rivals\r\nhad been driven from the field. He was out of debt, and had a\r\nhandsome balance in the bank. The experimental stage was passed,\r\nand the enterprise was an established success. It was, indeed, in\r\nsuch perfect order that Barnum felt safe in leaving it to his\r\nlieutenants, while he went forth to seek new realms of conquest.\r\nAccordingly he made an agreement for General Tom Thumb's services\r\nfor another year, at fifty dollars a week and all expenses, with\r\nthe privilege of exhibiting him in Europe. He proposed to test\r\nthe curiosity of men and women on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging his business affairs for a long absence, and\r\nmaking every preparation for an extended foreign tour, on\r\nThursday, January 18th, 1844, he went on board the new and fine\r\nsailing ship \"Yorkshire,\" Captain D. G. Bailey, bound for\r\nLiverpool. The party included General Tom Thumb, his parents, his\r\ntutor, and Professor Guillaudeu, a French naturalist. They were\r\naccompanied by several personal friends, and the City Brass Band\r\nkindly volunteered to escort them to Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nThey were met at Liverpool by a large crowd of sight-seers, who\r\nhad been attracted thither by the fame of \"Tom Thumb.\" The\r\ncuriosity of the populace was not gratified, however, for Barnum\r\nhad the child smuggled ashore unseen, under his mother's shawl.\r\n\r\n\"My letters of introduction,\" said the showman,  many excellent\r\nfamilies, and I was induced to hire a hall and present the\r\nGeneral to the public, for a short season in Liverpool. I had\r\nintended to proceed directly to London, and begin operations at\r\n'headquarters,' that is, in Buckingham Palace, if possible; but I\r\nhad been advised that the royal family was in mourning for the\r\ndeath of Prince Albert's father, and would not permit the\r\napproach of any entertainments. Meanwhile, confidential letters\r\nfrom London informed me that Mr. Maddox, Manager of Princess's\r\nTheatre, was coming down to witness my exhibition, with a view to\r\nmaking an engagement. He came privately, but I was fully informed\r\nas to his presence and object. A friend pointed him out to me in\r\nthe hall, and when I stepped up to him, and called him by name,\r\nhe was 'taken all aback,' and avowed his purpose in visiting\r\nLiverpool. An interview resulted in an engagement of the General\r\nfor three nights at Princess's Theatre. I was unwilling to\r\ncontract for a longer period, and even this short engagement,\r\nthough on liberal terms, was acceded to only as a means of\r\nadvertisement. So soon, therefore, as I could bring my short, but\r\nhighly successful, season in Liverpool to a close, we went to\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. TOM THUMB IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nAN ARISTOCRATIC VISITOR--CALLING AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND\r\nHOB-NOBBING WITH ROYALTY--GETTING A PUFF IN THE \"COURT CIRCULAR\"\r\n--THE IRON DUKE--A GREAT SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS.\r\n\r\nThe first public appearance of Tom Thumb in London occurred soon\r\nafter the arrival of the party there, at the Princess's Theatre.\r\nA short engagement only had been made, but it was exceedingly\r\nsuccessful. The spectators were delighted, the manager overjoyed,\r\nand Barnum himself pleased beyond measure. This brief engagement\r\nanswered his purpose, in arousing public interest and curiosity.\r\nThat was all the shrewd showman wanted for the present.\r\nAccordingly, when the manager of the theatre urged a renewal of\r\nthe engagement, at a much higher price, Barnum positively\r\ndeclined it. He had secured the desired advertising; now he would\r\nexhibit on his own account and in his own way.\r\n\r\nHe therefore took a splendid mansion in Grafton Street, Bond\r\nStreet, in the fashionable and aristocratic West End of London.\r\nLord Talbot had lived in it, and Lord Brougham lived close by. It\r\nwas an audacious stroke for the Yankee showman to invade this\r\nselect and exclusive region, but it was successful. In response\r\nto his invitations members of the nobility came eagerly flocking\r\nto the house to see the wonderful child. Barnum showed himself as\r\nexclusive as any of them, for he gave orders to his servants that\r\nno callers were to be received who did not present cards of\r\ninvitation. This procedure he afterward explained, was entirely\r\nproper. He had not yet announced himself as a public showman. He\r\nwas simply an American citizen visiting London, and it was\r\nincumbent upon him to maintain the dignity of his position! His\r\nservants, of course, exercised proper tact, and no offense was\r\ngiven, although many of the nobility and gentry, who drove to his\r\ndoor in carriages adorned with crests and coats of arms, were\r\nthus turned away.\r\n\r\nAmong the early callers was the Hon. Edward Everett, the American\r\nminister to England. He was much pleased with Mr. Barnum and his\r\ntiny ward, and had them dine with him the next day. He also\r\npromised that they should, if possible, be received by the Queen\r\nat Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\nA few evenings afterward the Baroness Rothschild sent her\r\ncarriage for them. They were received by a half a dozen servants,\r\nand were ushered up a broad flight of marble stairs to the\r\ndrawing-room, where they met the Baroness and a party of twenty\r\nor more ladies and gentlemen. In this sumptuous mansion of the\r\nrichest banker in the world, they spent about two hours, and when\r\nthey took their leave a well-filled purse was quietly slipped\r\ninto Mr. Barnum's hand. The golden shower had begun to fall.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum now thought the time ripe for beginning his public\r\nexhibitions. He engaged Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, and announced\r\nthat Tom Thumb was to be seen there. The rush of visitors was\r\ntremendous. The aristocracy of London thronged the hall night\r\nafter night, and a phenomenal success was assured. Barnum did not\r\nlook beyond such work. True, Everett had spoken of an audience\r\nwith the Queen, but Barnum had no idea that it would ever be\r\ngranted. One day, however, he met Mr. Murray, Master of the\r\nQueen's Household, at Everett's at breakfast, and that gentleman\r\nasked him what were his plans for the future. Barnum replied that\r\nhe expected presently to go to the Continent, but he would most\r\ngladly stay in London if he could get the favor of an audience\r\nwith Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nMr. Murray kindly offered his good offices in the case, and the\r\nnext day one of the Life Guards, a tall, noble-looking fellow,\r\nbedecked as became his station, brought a note, conveying the\r\nQueen's invitation to General Tom Thumb and his guardian Mr.\r\nBarnum, to appear at Buckingham Palace on an evening specified.\r\nSpecial instructions were the same day orally given by Mr.\r\nMurray, by Her Majesty's command, to suffer the General to appear\r\nbefore her, as he would appear anywhere else, without any\r\ntraining in the use of the titles of royalty, as the Queen\r\ndesired to see him act naturally and without restraint.\r\n\r\nDetermined to make the most of the occasion, Mr. Barnum put a\r\nplacard on the door of the Egyptian Hall: \"Closed this evening,\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb being at Buckingham Palace by command of Her\r\nMajesty.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the palace, a Lord-in-Waiting met them, and\r\nbegan \"coaching\" them on points of court etiquette. Mr. Barnum,\r\nespecially, was told that he must in no event speak directly to\r\nHer Majesty, but through the medium of the aforesaid Lord. He\r\nmust also keep his face constantly turned toward the Queen, and\r\nso, in retiring from the royal presence, must walk backward.\r\nHaving thus been instructed in the ways of royalty, Mr. Barnum\r\nand the diminutive General were led to the presence of the Queen.\r\n\r\nThey passed through a long corridor to a broad flight of marble\r\nsteps, which led to the picture gallery, and there the Queen and\r\nPrince Albert, the Duchess of Kent, the Duke of Wellington, and\r\nothers were awaiting their arrival. They were standing at the\r\nfurther end of the room when the doors were thrown open, and the\r\nGeneral walked in, looking like a wax doll gifted with the power\r\nof locomotion. Surprise and pleasure were depicted on the\r\ncountenances of the royal circle at beholding this remarkable\r\nspecimen of humanity so much smaller than they had evidently\r\nexpected to find him.\r\n\r\nThe General advanced with a firm step, and, as he came within\r\nhailing distance, made a very graceful bow, and exclaimed, \"Good\r\nevening, ladies and gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter followed this salutation. The Queen then took\r\nhim by the hand, led him about the gallery, and asked him many\r\nquestions, the answers to which kept the party in an\r\nuninterrupted strain of merriment. The General familiarly\r\ninformed the Queen that her picture gallery was \"first-rate,\" and\r\ntold her he should like to see the Prince of Wales. The Queen\r\nreplied that the Prince had retired to rest, but that he should\r\nsee him on some future occasion. The General then gave his songs,\r\ndances, and imitations, and after a conversation with Prince\r\nAlbert, and all present, which continued for more than an hour,\r\nthey were permitted to depart.\r\n\r\nBut before this Mr. Barnum had broken the instructions in\r\netiquette which had been so carefully impressed upon him by the\r\nLord-in-Waiting. When the Queen began asking him questions, he\r\nanswered her, as she addressed him, through the lordly medium, as\r\nhe had been told. That was inconvenient and irksome, however, and\r\npresently Barnum addressed his reply directly to her. The\r\nLord-in-Waiting was horror-struck, but the Queen did not appear\r\nto be displeased, for she instantly followed her guest's example,\r\nand spoke thereafter directly to him. In a few minutes Her\r\nMajesty and the Yankee showman were talking together with the\r\ngreatest ease and freedom.\r\n\r\n\"I felt,\" said Mr. Barnum afterward, \"entirely at ease in her\r\npresence, and could not avoid contrasting her sensible and\r\namiable manners with the stiffness and formality of upstart\r\ngentility at home or abroad.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen was modestly attired in plain black, and wore no\r\nornaments. Indeed, surrounded as she was by ladies arrayed in the\r\nhighest style of magnificence, their dresses sparkling with\r\ndiamonds, she was the last person whom a stranger would have\r\npointed out in that circle as the Queen of England.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord-in-Waiting was perhaps mollified toward me when he saw\r\nme following his illustrious example in retiring from the royal\r\npresence. He was accustomed to the process, and therefore was\r\nable to keep somewhat ahead (or rather aback) of me, but even _I_\r\nstepped rather fast for the other member of the retiring party.\r\nWe had a considerable distance to travel in that long gallery\r\nbefore reaching the door, and whenever the General found he was\r\nlosing ground, he turned around and ran a few steps, then resumed\r\nhis position of backing out, then turned around and ran, and so\r\ncontinued to alternate his methods of getting to the door, until\r\nthe gallery fairly rang with the merriment of the royal\r\nspectators. It was really one of the richest scenes I ever saw;\r\nrunning, under the circumstances, was an offense sufficiently\r\nheinous to excite the indignation of the Queen's favorite poodle\r\ndog, and he vented his displeasure by barking so sharply as to\r\nstartle the General from his propriety. He, however, recovered\r\nimmediately, and with his little cane, commenced an attack on the\r\npoodle, and a funny fight ensued, which renewed and increased the\r\nmerriment of the royal party.\r\n\r\n\"This was near the door of exit. We had scarcely passed into the\r\nante-room, when one of the Queen's attendants came to us with the\r\nexpressed hope of her Majesty that the General had sustained no\r\ndamage, to which the Lord-in-Waiting playfully added, that in\r\ncase of injury to so renowned a personage, he should fear a\r\ndeclaration of war by the United States!\"\r\n\r\nThe visitors were then escorted about the Palace, and treated to\r\nrefreshments. Before leaving Mr. Barnum bethought him of the\r\n\"Court Circular,\" in which the doings of the Royal Family were\r\nchronicled to the world. Would his reception by the Queen be\r\nmentioned in it? Certainly. Well, then, would it not be possible\r\nto secure something more than mere mention; some words of special\r\ncommendation; a \"free advertisement\" in fact? He would try it! So\r\nhe inquired where he could find the gentleman who prepared the\r\ncircular, and was informed that that functionary was in the\r\nPalace at that very moment.\r\n\r\n\"He was sent for,\" related Mr. Barnum, \"by my solicitation, and\r\npromptly acceded to my request for such a notice as would attract\r\nattention. He even generously desired me to give him an outline\r\nof what I sought, and I was pleased to see afterward, that he had\r\ninserted my notice verbatim.\r\n\r\n\"This notice of my visit to the Queen wonderfully increased the\r\nattraction of 'Gen. Tom Thumb,' and compelled me to obtain a more\r\ncommodious hall for my exhibition. I accordingly moved to a\r\nlarger room in the same building.\"\r\n\r\nOn their second visit to the Queen, they were received in what is\r\ncalled the Yellow Drawing Room, a magnificent apartment. It is on\r\nthe north side of the gallery, and is entered from that\r\napartment. It was hung with drapery of rich yellow satin damask,\r\nthe couches, sofas, and chairs being covered with the same\r\nmaterial. The vases, urns, and ornaments were all of the most\r\nexquisite workmanship. The room was panelled in gold, and the\r\nheavy cornices beautifully carved and gilt. The tables, pianos,\r\netc., were mounted with gold, inlaid with pearl of various hues,\r\nand of the most elegant designs.\r\n\r\nThey were ushered into this gorgeous drawing-room before the\r\nQueen and royal circle had left the dining-room, and, as they\r\napproached, the General bowed respectfully, and remarked to Her\r\nMajesty, \"that he had seen her before,\" adding, \"I think this is\r\na prettier room than the picture gallery; that chandelier is very\r\nfine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen smilingly took him by the hand, and said she hoped he\r\nwas very well.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he replied, \"I am first-rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"General,\" continued the Queen, \"this is the Prince of Wales.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Prince?\" said the General, shaking him by the hand,\r\nand then standing beside the Prince, he remarked, \"the prince is\r\ntaller than I am, but I feel as big as anybody,\" upon which he\r\nstrutted up and down the room as proud as a peacock, amid shouts\r\nof laughter from all present.\r\n\r\nThe Queen then introduced the Princess Royal, and the General\r\nimmediately led her to his elegant little sofa, which he took\r\nwith him, and with much politeness sat down beside her. Then,\r\nrising from his seat, he went through his various performances,\r\nand the Queen handed him an elegant and costly souvenir, which\r\nhad been expressly made for him by her order, for which, he told\r\nher, \"he was very much obliged, and would keep it as long as he\r\nlived.\" The Queen of the Belgians (daughter of Louis Philippe)\r\nwas present on this occasion. She asked the General where he was\r\ngoing when he left London.\r\n\r\n\"To Paris,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you expect to see there?\" she continued.\r\n\r\nOf course all expected he would answer, \"the King of the French,\"\r\nbut the little fellow replied.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Guillaudeu.\"\r\n\r\nThe two queens looked inquiringly, and when Mr. Barnum informed\r\nthem that M. Guillaudeu was his French naturalist, they laughed\r\nmost heartily.\r\n\r\nOn their third visit to Buckingham Palace, Leopold, King of the\r\nBelgians, was also present. He was highly pleased, and asked a\r\nmultitude of questions. Queen Victoria desired the General to\r\nsing a song, and asked him what song he preferred to sing.\r\n\r\n\"Yankee Doodle,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\nThis answer was as unexpected to Mr. Barnum as it was to the\r\nroyal party. When the merriment it occasioned had somewhat\r\nsubsided, the Queen good-humoredly remarked, \"that is a very\r\npretty song, General, sing it, if you please.\" The General\r\ncomplied, and soon afterward retired.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sent to Barnum a handsome fee for each of his visits,\r\nbut that was only a small part of the benefits which his\r\nacquaintance with her brought to him. Such was the force of Court\r\nexample that it was now deemed unfashionable, almost disloyal,\r\nnot to have seen Tom Thumb. Carriages of the nobility, fifty or\r\nsixty at a time, were to be seen at Barnum's door in Piccadilly.\r\nEgyptian Hall was crowded at every exhibition, and the net\r\nprofits there were on the average more than $500 per day from\r\nMarch 20th to July 20th. Portraits of the tiny General were for\r\nsale everywhere, and were eagerly purchased by thousands. Musical\r\ncompositions were dedicated to him, and songs were sung in his\r\nhonor. Week after week he was the subject of Punch's wittiest\r\ncartoons; and of course all this was just so much free\r\nadvertising. Besides his three public performances per day, the\r\nlittle General attended three or four private parties per week,\r\nfor which they were paid eight to ten guineas each. Frequently he\r\nwould visit two parties in the same evening, and the demand in\r\nthat line was much greater than the supply. The Queen Dowager\r\nAdelaide requested the General's attendance at Marlborough House\r\none afternoon. He went in his court dress, consisting of a richly\r\nembroidered brown silk-velvet coat and short breeches, white\r\nsatin vest with fancy colored embroidery, white silk stockings\r\nand pumps, wig, bagwig, cocked hat, and dress sword.\r\n\r\n\"Why, General,\" said the Queen Dowager, \"I think you look very\r\nsmart to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I do,\" said the General, complacently.\r\n\r\nA large party of the nobility were present. The old Duke of\r\nCambridge offered the little General a pinch of snuff, which he\r\ndeclined. The General sang his songs, performed his dances, and\r\ncracked his jokes, to the great amusement and delight of the\r\ndistinguished circle of visitors.\r\n\r\n\"Dear little General,\" said the kind-hearted Queen, taking him\r\nupon her lap, \"I see you have no watch. Will you permit me to\r\npresent you with a watch and chain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like them very much,\" replied the General, his eyes\r\nglistening with joy as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I will have them made expressly for you,\" responded the Queen\r\nDowager; and at the same moment she called a friend and desired\r\nhim to see that the proper order was executed. A few weeks\r\nthereafter they were called again to Marlborough House. A number\r\nof the children of the nobility were present, as well as some of\r\ntheir parents. After passing a few compliments with the General,\r\nQueen Adelaide presented him with a beautiful little gold watch,\r\nplacing the chain around his neck with her own hands.\r\n\r\nThis watch, also, served the purpose of an advertisement, and a\r\ngood one, too. It was not only duly heralded, but was placed upon\r\na pedestal in the hall of exhibition, together with the presents\r\nfrom Queen Victoria, and covered with a glass vase. These\r\npresents, to which were soon added an elegant gold snuff-box\r\nmounted with turquois, presented by his grace the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, and many other costly gifts of the nobility and\r\ngentry, added to the attraction of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington called frequently to see the little\r\nGeneral at his public levees. The first time he called, the\r\nGeneral was personating Napoleon Bonaparte, marching up and down\r\nthe platform, and apparently taking snuff in deep meditation. He\r\nwas dressed in the well-known uniform of the Emperor. Barnum\r\nintroduced him to the \"Iron Duke,\" who inquired the subject of\r\nhis meditations. \"I was thinking of the loss of the battle of\r\nWaterloo,\" was the little General's immediate reply. This display\r\nof wit was chronicled throughout the country, and was of itself\r\nworth thousands of pounds to the exhibition.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb had visited the King of Saxony and also Ibrahim\r\nPacha, who was then in London. At the different parties he\r\nattended, he met, in the course of the season, nearly all of the\r\nnobility. Scarcely a nobleman in England failed to see General\r\nTom Thumb at his own house, at the house of a friend, or at the\r\npublic levees at Egyptian Hall. The General was a decided pet\r\nwith some of the first personages in the land, among whom were\r\nSir Robert and Lady Peel, the Duke and Duchess of Buckingham,\r\nDuke of Bedford, Duke of Devonshire, Count d'Orsay, Lady\r\nBlessington, Daniel O'Connell, Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, Lord\r\nChesterfield, and many other persons of distinction They had the\r\nfree entree to all the theatres, public gardens, and places of\r\nentertainment, and frequently met the principal artists, editors,\r\npoets, and authors of the country. Albert Smith wrote a play for\r\nthe General, entitled \"Hop o' my Thumb,\" which was presented with\r\ngreat success at the Lyceum Theatre, London, and in several of\r\nthe provincial theatres.\r\n\r\nThus the London visit and the tour of England were successful\r\nbeyond all anticipation, and it was with an overflowing purse\r\nthat Barnum set out with his charge for the French capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN PARIS--VISIT TO THE TUILERIES--LONGCHAMPS--\"TOM PONCE\"\r\nALL THE RAGE--BONAPARTE AND LOUIS PHILIPPE--TOUR THROUGH\r\nFRANCE--BARNUM'S PURCHASE.\r\n\r\nBarnum having returned from a preliminary trip to France, in\r\nwhich all arrangements, even to starting the first paragraphs in\r\nthe Paris papers were made, now went back accompanied by Tom\r\nThumb. They reached Paris some days before the exhibition was\r\nopened, but on the day following their arrival, a special command\r\nreached them to appear at the Tuileries on the next Sunday\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour the General and his manager were ushered\r\ninto the presence of the King, the Queen, the Count de Paris,\r\nPrince de Joinville, the Duchess d'Orleans, and a dozen more\r\ndistinguished persons, among whom was the editor of the Journal\r\ndes Debats.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the General's performances, which he went through\r\nwith to the evident delight of all present, the King gave him a\r\nlarge emerald and diamond brooch, at the same time saying to Mr.\r\nBarnum: \"You may put it on the General, if you please.\" Which\r\ncommand was obeyed, to the gratification of the King and the\r\nimmense delight of the General.\r\n\r\nThe King was so condescending and affable that Mr. Barnum at\r\nlength ventured to ask a favor of him. The Longchamps celebration\r\nwas close at hand--a day once devoted to religious ceremony, but\r\nnow conspicuous for the display of court and fashionable\r\nequipages in the various drives and parks--and after the King had\r\nconversed with Mr. Barnum on various topics in a familiar manner,\r\nthe diplomatic showman remarked that he had hastened his arrival\r\nin Paris for the express purpose of taking part in the Longchamps\r\ncelebration. The General's carriage, he explained, with its\r\nponies and little coachman and footman, was so small that it\r\nwould be in great danger in the crowd unless the King would\r\ngraciously permit it to appear in the avenue reserved for the\r\ncourt and the diplomatic corps\r\n\r\nThe King smiled, and after a few minutes' consultation with one\r\nof the officers of his household. said: \"Call on the Prefect of\r\nPolice to-morrow afternoon and you will find a permit ready for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a two hours' visit they retired, the General loaded with\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nThe next morning all the newspapers chronicled the royal\r\naudience, the Journal des Debats giving a full account of the\r\ninterview and of the General's performances.\r\n\r\nThus all Paris knew that Tom Thumb, in all his glory, was in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nLongchamps day arrived, and conspicuous among the splendid\r\nequipages on the grand avenue, Tom Thumb's beautiful little\r\ncarriage, with four ponies and liveried and powdered coachman and\r\nfootman, rode along in the line of carriages bearing the\r\nambassadors to the Court of France. The air was fairly rent with\r\ncheers for \"le General Tom Ponce.\"\r\n\r\nThe first day's receipts were 5,500 francs--over three hundred\r\ndollars, and this sum might have been doubled had there been room\r\nfor more visitors. The elite of Paris flocked to the exhibition.\r\nThere were afternoon and evening performances, and seats were\r\nreserved in advance at an extra price for the entire two months.\r\n\r\nThe papers were full of praises for the performance; Figaro gave\r\na picture of an immense mastiff running away with the General's\r\nhorse and carriage in his mouth.\r\n\r\nStatuettes and pictures of \"Tom Ponce\" appeared everywhere; a\r\ncafe on one of the boulevards took the name of \"Tom Ponce,\" with\r\na life-size statue of the General for a sign. Eminent painters\r\nhere, as in London, asked to paint his portrait, but the\r\nGeneral's engagements were so pressing that he had little time to\r\nsit to artists. All the leading actors and actresses came to see\r\nhim, and he received many fine presents from them. The daily\r\nreceipts continued to increase, and the manager had to take a cab\r\nto carry home the silver at night.\r\n\r\nTwice more was the General summoned to appear before the royal\r\nfamily at the Tuileries, and on the King's birthday a special\r\ninvitation was sent him to view the display of fireworks in honor\r\nof the anniversary.\r\n\r\nThe last visit to the Court was made at St. Cloud. The papers, in\r\nspeaking of the General's characterizations, mentioned that there\r\nwas one costume which Tom Thumb wisely kept at the bottom of his\r\ntrunk. This was the uniform of Napoleon Bonaparte, and by special\r\nrequest of the King, it was worn at St. Cloud. The affair was\r\nquite sub rosa, however, none of the papers mentioning it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the visit each of the royal company gave the\r\nGeneral a magnificent present, overwhelmed him with kisses,\r\nwishing him a safe journey through France, and a long and happy\r\nlife. After making their adieux they retired to another part of\r\nthe palace to permit the General to change his costume and to\r\npartake of a collation which was served them. As they were\r\nleaving the palace they passed the sitting-room where the royal\r\nfamily were spending the evening. The door was open, and some one\r\nspying the General there was a call for him to come in and shake\r\nhands once more. They went in, finding the Queen and her ladies\r\nengaged in embroidering, while one young lady read aloud. They\r\nall kissed and petted the General many times around before\r\nfinally permitting him to depart.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Paris they made a most profitable tour, including\r\nthe cities of Rouen, Orleans, Brest, and Bordeaux, where they\r\nwere invited to witness a review of 20,000 soldiers by the Dukes\r\nde Nemours and d'Aumale. Thence to Toulon, Montpelier, Nismes,\r\nMarseilles, and many other less important places. At Nantes,\r\nBordeaux, and Marseilles the General appeared in the theatres in\r\na part written for him in a French play called \"Petit Poncet.\"\r\n\r\nDuring their stay in Paris, Barnum made a characteristically\r\nprofitable investment. A Russian Prince, who had lived in great\r\nsplendor in Paris, died suddenly, and his household effects were\r\nsold at auction. There was a magnificent gold tea-set, a dinner\r\nservice of silver, and some rare specimens of Sevres china, the\r\nvalue of which were impaired by the Prince's initials being on\r\nthem. The initials were \"P. T ,\" and Mr. Barnum bought them, and\r\nadding \"B.\" to the other letters, had a very fine table service\r\nappropriately marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. IN BELGIUM.\r\n\r\nPRESENTED TO KING LEOPOLD AND THE QUEEN--THE GENERAL'S JEWELS\r\nSTOLEN--THE FIELD OF WATERLOO--AN ACCIDENT--AN EXPENSIVE\r\nEQUIPAGE--\"THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY.\"\r\n\r\nThe day after the arrival of the party in Brussels they were\r\nsummoned to the palace. The king and queen had seen the General\r\nin London, but they wished their children and the distinguished\r\npeople of the court to have the same pleasure.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful visit they came away, the General, as usual,\r\nladen with gifts.\r\n\r\nThe following day the exhibition opened, and from the first was\r\ncrowded by throngs of the best people in the city. One day, in\r\nthe midst of the exhibition, it was discovered that the case\r\ncontaining all the valuable presents Tom Thumb had received from\r\nroyalty' etc., was missing.\r\n\r\nThe alarm was instantly given, and the police notified. A reward\r\nwas offered of 2,000 francs, and, after a day or two, the thief\r\nwas captured and the jewels returned. After that the case of\r\npresents was more carefully guarded.\r\n\r\nEveryone who goes to Brussels is supposed to visit the field of\r\nWaterloo; so, before they left, the entire party--Tom Thumb,\r\nBarnum, Prof. Pinte (tutor), and Mr. Stratton (father of the\r\nGeneral), and Mr. H. G. Sherman, went together.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the church in the village of Waterloo and viewing\r\nthe memorial tablets there, they passed to the house where Lord\r\nUxbridge--Marquis of Anglesey--had had his leg amputated. There\r\nis a little monument in the garden over the shattered limb, and a\r\npart of the boot that covered it was seen in the house. Barnum\r\nprocured a three-inch bit of the boot for his Museum, at the same\r\ntime remarking, that if the lady in charge was as liberal to all\r\nvisitors, that boot had held out wonderfully since 1815.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the ground they were beset by a dozen or more\r\nguides, each one professing to know the exact spot where every\r\nman had stood, and each claiming to have himself taken part in\r\nthe struggle, although most of them were less than twenty-five,\r\nand the battle had been fought some thirty years before. They\r\nfinally accepted one old man, who at first declared that he had\r\nbeen killed in the front ranks, but afterward acknowledged that\r\nhe had only been wounded and left on the field for dead three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAfter having the location of Napoleon's Guard, the Duke of\r\nWellington, the portion of the field where Blucher entered with\r\nthe Prussian army, pointed out to them, and the spots where fell\r\nSir Alexander Gordon and other celebrities, they asked the guide\r\nif he knew where Captain Tippitiwichet, of Connecticut, was\r\nkilled? \"Oh, oui, Monsieur,\" replied the guide confidently. After\r\npointing out the precise spots where fictitious friends from\r\nConey Island, New Jersey, Cape Cod and Saratoga had received\r\ntheir death-wounds, they paid the old humbug and dismissed him.\r\n\r\nUpon leaving the field they were met by another crowd of peasants\r\nwith relics of the battle for sale. Barnum bought a large number\r\nof pistols, bullets, brass French eagles, buttons, etc., for the\r\nMuseum, and the others were equally liberal in their purchases.\r\nThey bought also maps, guide-books and pictures, until Mr.\r\nStratton expressed his belief that the \"darned old battle of\r\nWaterloo\" had cost more since it was fought than it ever did\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSome months afterwards, while they were in Birmingham, they made\r\nthe acquaintance of a firm who manufactured and sent to Waterloo\r\nbarrels of these \"relics\" every year.\r\n\r\nFour or five miles on the road home they had the misfortune to\r\nbreak the axle-tree of the carriage. It was past one o'clock, and\r\nthe exhibition was advertised to commence in Brussels at two. Of\r\ncourse, they could not expect to walk the distance in less than\r\nthree hours, and Barnum was disposed to give up the afternoon\r\nperformance altogether. But Mr. Stratton could not bear the idea\r\nof losing six or eight hundred francs, so, accompanied by the\r\ninterpreter, Prof. Pinte, he rushed down the road to a\r\nfarm-house, followed leisurely by the rest of the party.\r\n\r\nMr. Stratton asked the old farmer if he had a carriage. He had\r\nnot. \"Have you no vehicle?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have that vehicle,\" he replied, pointing to an old cart\r\nfilled with manure, and standing in his barnyard.\r\n\r\n\"Thunder! is that all the conveyance you have got?\" asked\r\nStratton. Being assured that it was, Stratton concluded that it\r\nwas better to ride in a manure-cart than not to get to Brussels\r\nin time.\r\n\r\n\"What will you ask to drive us to Brussels in three-quarters of\r\nan hour?\" demanded Stratton.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" replied the farmer; \"I should want two hours\r\nfor my horse to do it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"But ours is a very pressing case, and if we are not there in\r\ntime we lose more than five hundred francs,\" said Stratton.\r\n\r\nThe old farmer pricked up his ears at this, and agreed to get\r\nthem to Brussels in an hour for eighty francs. Stratton tried to\r\nbeat him down, but it was of no use.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go it, Stratton,\" said Sherman; \"eighty francs you know is\r\nonly sixteen dollars, and you will probably save a hundred by it,\r\nfor I expect a full house at our afternoon exhibition to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have already spent about ten dollars for nonsense,\" said\r\nStratton, \"and we shall have to pay for the broken carriage\r\nbesides.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can you do better?\" chimed in Professor Pinte.\r\n\r\n\"It is an outrageous extortion to charge sixteen dollars for an\r\nold horse and cart to go ten miles. Why, in old Bridgeport, I\r\ncould get it done for three dollars,\" replied Stratton, in a tone\r\nof vexation\r\n\r\n\"It is the custom of the country,\" said Professor Pinte, \"and we\r\nmust submit to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a thundering mean custom, anyhow,\" said Stratton,\r\n\"and I won't stand such imposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we do?\" earnestly inquired Mr. Pinte. \"It may be\r\na high price, but it is better to pay that than to lose our\r\nafternoon performance and five or six hundred francs.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the pocket touched Stratton's feelings; so,\r\nsubmitting to the extortion, he replied to our interpreter,\r\n\"Well, tell the old robber to dump his dung-cart as soon as\r\npossible, or we shall lose half an hour in starting.\"\r\n\r\nThe cart was \"dumped\" and a large, lazy-looking Flemish horse was\r\nattached to it with a rope harness. Some boards were laid across\r\nthe cart for seats, the party tumbled into the rustic vehicle, a\r\nred-haired boy, son of the old farmer, mounted the horse, and\r\nStratton gave orders to \"get along.\" \"Wait a moment,\" said the\r\nfarmer, \"you have not paid me yet.\" \"I'll pay your boy when we\r\nget to Brussels, provided he gets there within the hour,\" replied\r\nStratton.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is sure to get there in an hour,\" said the farmer, \"but I\r\ncan't let him go unless you pay in advance.\" The minutes were\r\nflying rapidly, the anticipated loss of the day exhibition of\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb flitted before his eyes, and Stratton, in very\r\ndesperation, thrust his hand into his pocket and drew forth\r\nsixteen five-franc pieces, which he dropped, one at a time, into\r\nthe hand, of the farmer, and then called out to the boy, \"There\r\nnow, do try to see if you can go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy did go ahead, but it was with such a snail's pace that it\r\nwould have puzzled a man of tolerable eyesight to have determined\r\nwhether the horse was moving or standing still. To make it still\r\nmore interesting, it commenced raining furiously. As they had\r\nleft Brussels in a coach, and the morning had promised a pleasant\r\nday, they had omitted umbrellas. They were soon soaked to the\r\nskin, but they \"grinned and bore it\" a while without grumbling.\r\nAt length Stratton, who was almost too angry to speak, desired\r\nMr. Pinte to ask the red haired boy if he expected to walk his\r\nhorse all the way to Brussels.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the boy; \"he is too big and fat to do\r\nanything but walk. We never trot him.\"\r\n\r\nStratton was terrified as he thought of the loss of the day\r\nexhibition; and he cursed the boy, the cart, the rain, the luck,\r\nand even the battle of Waterloo itself. But it was all of no use;\r\nthe horse would not run, but the rain did--down their backs.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock, the time appointed for the exhibition, they were\r\nyet some seven miles from Brussels. The horse walked slowly and\r\nphilosophically through the pitiless storm, the steam\r\nmajestically rising from the old manure-cart, to the no small\r\ndisturbance of their unfortunate olfactories. \"It will take two\r\nhours to get to Brussels at this rate,\" growled Stratton. \"Oh,\r\nno,\" replied the boy; \"it will only take about two hours from the\r\ntime we started.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your father agreed to get us there in an hour,\" answered\r\nStratton.\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" responded the boy, \"but he knew it would take more\r\nthan two.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll sue him for damages, by thunder!\" said Stratton.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there would be no use in that,\" chimed in Mr. Pinte, \"for\r\nyou could get no satisfaction in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall lose more than a hundred dollars by being two hours\r\ninstead of one,\" said Stratton.\r\n\r\n\"They care nothing about that; all they care for is your eighty\r\nfrancs,\" remarked Pinte.\r\n\r\n\"But they have lied and swindled me,\" replied Stratton.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must not mind that; it is the custom of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe party arrived in Brussels precisely two hours and a half from\r\nthe time they left the farmer's house. Of course it was too late\r\nfor the afternoon performance, and hundreds of people had been\r\nturned away disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. IN ENGLAND AGAIN.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN HALL AND THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS--THE SPECIAL\r\nTRAIN--OXFORD--STRATFORD-ON-AVON--GUY OF WARWICK RELICS--PURCHASE\r\nOF THE \"HAPPY FAMILY\"--RETURN TO AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIn London the General again opened his levees in Egyptian Hall,\r\nwith increased success. His unbounded popularity on the\r\nContinent, and his receptions by King Louis Philippe, of France,\r\nand King Leopold, of Belgium, had added greatly to his prestige\r\nand fame. Those who had seen him when he was in London months\r\nbefore came to see him again, and new visitors crowded by\r\nthousands to the General's levees.\r\n\r\nBesides giving these daily entertainments, the General appeared\r\noccasionally for an hour, during the intermissions, at some place\r\nin the suburbs; and for a long time he appeared every day at the\r\nSurrey Zoological Gardens, under the direction of the proprietor,\r\nMr. W. Tyler. This place subsequently became celebrated for its\r\ngreat music hall, in which Spurgeon, the sensational preacher,\r\nfirst attained his notoriety. The place was always crowded, and\r\nwhen the General had gone through with his performances on the\r\nlittle stage, in order that all might see him, he was put into a\r\nballoon, which, secured by ropes, was then passed around the\r\nground, just above the people's heads. Some forty men managed the\r\nropes and prevented the balloon from rising; but, one day, a\r\nsudden gust of wind took the balloon fairly out of the hands of\r\nhalf the men who had hold of the ropes, while others were lifted\r\nfrom the ground, and had not an alarm been instantly given, which\r\ncalled at least two hundred to the rescue, the little General\r\nwould have been lost.\r\n\r\nIn October Barnum made a flying visit to America, remaining long\r\nenough to renew the lease of the Museum building, and to attend\r\nto various other business matters. When he returned he was\r\naccompanied by his wife and daughters. They took a furnished\r\nhouse, which, during all their three months' residence, was the\r\nscene of constant hospitality, all the distinguished people in\r\nLondon being entertained there.\r\n\r\nWhen the engagement at Egyptian Hall expired they made an\r\nextensive tour through England and Scotland, going as far north\r\nas Aberdeen. The General's Scotch costumes, his national dances\r\nand the \"bit of dialect\" which he had acquired had long been a\r\nfeature of the performance and was especially admired in\r\nScotland. The party travelled much of the time in Barnum's own\r\ncarriage, the General's carriage, ponies and other properties\r\nbeing conveyed in a huge van. They found this way of travelling\r\nmore comfortable than the other, besides enabling them to visit\r\nout of the way places, where often the most successful\r\nexhibitions were given.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion when their carriage broke down, and, as\r\nthey had advertised a performance in Rugby that evening, they\r\ndecided to take the cars; but on arriving at the station they\r\nfound the last train gone. Barnum immediately looked up the\r\nsuperintendent and told him that they must have an extra train\r\nfor Rugby, without an instant's delay.\r\n\r\n\"Extra train?\" said he, with surprise and a half-sneer, \"extra\r\ntrain? why you can't have an extra train to Rugby for less than\r\nsixty pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all? well, get up your train immediately, and here are\r\nyour sixty pounds. What in the world are sixty pounds to me, when\r\nI wish to go to Rugby, or elsewhere, in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonished superintendent took the money, bustled about, and\r\nthe train was soon ready. He was greatly puzzled to know what\r\ndistinguished person--he thought he must be dealing with some\r\nprince, or, at least, a duke--was willing to give so much money\r\nto save a few hours of time, and he hesitatingly asked whom he\r\nhad the honor of serving.\r\n\r\n\"General Tom Thumb.\"\r\n\r\nThe performance at Rugby netted L160, which not only covered\r\nexpenses but left a handsome margin.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in Oxford, a dozen or more of the students came to\r\nthe conclusion that, as the General was a little fellow, the\r\nadmission fee to his entertainments should be paid in the\r\nsmallest kind of money. They accordingly provided themselves with\r\nfarthings, and as each man entered, instead of handing in a\r\nshilling for his ticket, he laid down forty-eight farthings. The\r\ncounting of these small coins was a great annoyance to Mr.\r\nStratton, the General's father, who was ticket-seller, and after\r\ncounting two or three handfuls, vexed at the delay which was\r\npreventing a crowd of ladies and gentlemen from buying tickets,\r\nMr. Stratton lost his temper, and cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Blast your quarter-pennies! I am not going to count them! you\r\nchaps who haven't bigger money can chuck your copper into my hat\r\nand walk in.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stratton was a genuine Yankee, and thoroughly conversant with\r\nthe Yankee vernacular which he used freely. In exhibiting the\r\nGeneral, Barnum often said to visitors that Tom Thumb's parents,\r\nand the rest of the family, were persons of the ordinary size,\r\nand that the gentleman who presided in the ticket-office was the\r\nGeneral's father. This made poor Stratton an object of no little\r\ncuriosity, and he was pestered with all sorts of questions; on\r\none occasion an old dowager said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Are you really the father of General Tom Thumb?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wa'al,\" replied Stratton, \"I have to support him!\"\r\n\r\nThis evasive answer is common enough in New England, but the\r\nliteral dowager had her doubts, and promptly rejoined:\r\n\r\n\"I rather think he supports you!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Barnum was in Europe on business, he made the most of\r\nhis opportunities for sight-seeing, and in his few leisure hours\r\nmanaged to visit nearly every place of interest both in England\r\nand on the continent.\r\n\r\nWhile in Birmingham, with his friend Albert Smith, then author\r\nand afterwards a successful showman, he visited\r\nStratford-on-Avon, where lived and wrote the greatest of English\r\npoets--Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nWhile breakfasting at the Red House Inn, at Stratford, they\r\ncalled for a guide-book of the town, and to Barnum's great\r\ndelight the volume proved to be Washington Irving's\r\n\"Sketch-book.\" His pleasure was even more increased when he\r\ndiscovered, on reading the vivid and picturesque description of\r\nStratford, that Irving had stopped at the very same hotel where\r\nthey were awaiting breakfast.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the house as well as the church where is the tomb\r\nof the poet, they took a post-chaise for Warwick Castle, fourteen\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Warwick and his family being absent, the visitors\r\nwere shown through the apartments. One guide took them over the\r\nCastle, another escorted them to the top of \"Guy's Tower,\"\r\nanother showed them the famous Warwick Vase. They were\r\ncongratulating themselves on not being called upon for any more\r\ntips, when the old porter at the lodge informed them that for a\r\nconsideration he could show them more interesting things\r\nconnected with the Castle than any they had yet seen. They tossed\r\nhim his fee, and he produced what purported to be Guy of\r\nWarwick's sword, shield, helmet, breastplate, walking-staff, etc.\r\nThe armor must have weighed two hundred pounds and the sword\r\nalone one hundred. Barnum listened, and gazed in silence at the\r\nhorse-armor, large enough for an elephant, and a pot called\r\n\"Guy's porridge-pot,\" which could have held seventy gallons, but\r\nwhen the old man produced the ribs of a mastodon which he\r\ndeclared had belonged to a huge dun cow, which had done much\r\ninjury to many persons before being slain by the dauntless Guy,\r\nhe drew a long breath, and feelingly congratulated the old porter\r\non his ability to concentrate more lies than anyone had ever\r\nbefore heard in so small a compass.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Barnum, \"that you have told these marvellous\r\ntales so often that you almost believe them yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost,\" answered the old man, with a broad grin.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, old fellow,\" continued Barnum,  \"what will you take\r\nfor the entire lot of these old traps? I want them for my Museum\r\nin America.\"\r\n\r\n\"No money would buy these priceless relics of a bygone age,\"\r\nreplied the porter, leering.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" exclaimed the showman; \"I'll have them duplicated\r\nfor my Museum, so that Americans can see them without coming\r\nhere, and in that way I'll burst up your old show.\"\r\n\r\nThe porter was paralyzed with astonishment at this threat, and\r\nAlbert Smith was convulsed with laughter. He afterwards told\r\nBarnum that he first derived his idea of becoming a showman from\r\nthis day at Warwick, and Barnum's talk about his doings and\r\nadventures in the business.\r\n\r\nThey visited that same day Kenilworth and Coventry, in which\r\nlatter place Barnum discovered the exhibition known as the \"Happy\r\nFamily,\" about two hundred birds and animals of opposite natures,\r\ndwelling in one cage in perfect harmony. He was so delighted with\r\nit that he bought it on the spot, and hired the manager to\r\naccompany the exhibition to New York, where it became a famous\r\nfeature of the Museum.\r\n\r\nAlbert Smith afterwards published a chapter in Bentley's\r\nMagazine, entitled \"A Day with Barnum,\" in which he said they\r\naccomplished business with such rapidity that, when he attempted\r\nto write out the accounts of the day, he found the whole thing so\r\nconfused in his brain that he came near locating \"Peeping Tom\" in\r\nthe house of Shakespeare, while Guy of Warwick WOULD stick his\r\nhead above the ruins of Kenilworth, and the Warwick Vase appeared\r\nin Coventry.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two brief trips to America, Barnum had been\r\nabroad with General Tom Thumb three years. The season had been\r\none of unbroken pleasure and profit. They had visited nearly\r\nevery city and town in France, Belgium, England, Scotland, and\r\nthe cities of Belfast and Dublin in Ireland. After this truly\r\ntriumphant tour, they set sail in February, 1847, for New York.\r\n\r\nBarnum was a man who never could bear to see injustice done. On\r\none of his business trips to America he took passage on a Cunard\r\nsteamer, commanded by a Captain Judkins. Among the passengers was\r\nthe celebrated preacher, Robert Baird. One Sunday after dinner\r\nBarnum asked Mr. Baird if he would be willing to preach to the\r\npassengers in the forward cabin. The captain had read the\r\nEpiscopal service that morning, but it was done as a mere matter\r\nof form, without the slightest suggestion of devotion in its\r\nobservance.\r\n\r\nMr. Baird consented to preach, and Barnum, after mentioning it to\r\nthe other passengers, who were delighted at the prospect, went to\r\nthe captain and said: \"Captain, the passengers desire to have Dr.\r\nBaird conduct a religious service in the forward cabin. I suppose\r\nthere is no objection?\" The rest of the story may as well be told\r\nin Barnum's own words. To his inquiry, the captain replied\r\ngruffly:\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly there is, and it will not be permitted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is against the rules of the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! to have religious services on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"There have been religious services once to-day, and that is\r\nenough. If the passengers do not think that is good enough, let\r\nthem go without,\" was the captain's hasty and austere reply.\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" Barnum replied, \"do you pretend to say you will not\r\nallow a respectable and well-known clergyman to offer a prayer\r\nand hold religious services on board your ship at the request of\r\nyour passengers?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, sir, is exactly what I say. So, now, let me hear no more\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time a dozen passengers were crowding around his door,\r\nand expressing their surprise at his conduct. Barnum was\r\nindignant, and used sharp language.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"this is the most contemptible thing I ever\r\nheard of on the part of the owners of a public passenger ship.\r\nTheir meanness ought to be published far and wide.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better 'shut up,' \" said Captain Judkins, with great\r\nsternness.\r\n\r\n\"I will not 'shut up,' \" he replied; \"for this thing is perfectly\r\noutrageous. In that out-of-the-way forward cabin you allow, on\r\nweek-days, gambling, swearing, smoking and singing till late at\r\nnight; and yet on Sunday you have the impudence to deny the\r\nprivilege of a prayer-meeting, conducted by a gray-haired and\r\nrespected minister of the gospel. It is simply infamous!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Judkins turned red in the face; and, no doubt feeling\r\nthat he was \"monarch of all he surveyed,\" exclaimed in a loud\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"If you repeat such language, I will put you in irons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it, if you dare,\" said Barnum, feeling his indignation rising\r\nrapidly. \"I dare and defy you to put your finger on me. I would\r\nlike to sail into New York harbor in handcuffs, on board a\r\nBritish ship, for the terrible crime of asking that religious\r\nworship may be permitted on board. So you may try it as soon as\r\nyou please; and, when we get to New York, I'll show you a touch\r\nof Yankee ideas of religious intolerance.\"\r\n\r\nTurning on his heel, he walked over to Mr. Baird and told him how\r\nmatters stood, adding, with a laugh:\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, it may be dangerous for you to tell of this incident\r\nwhen you get on shore; for it would be a pretty strong draught\r\nupon the credulity of many of my countrymen if they were told\r\nthat my zeal to hear an orthodox minister preach was so great\r\nthat it came near getting me into solitary confinement. But I am\r\nnot prejudiced, and I like fair play.\"\r\n\r\nThe old doctor replied: \"Well, you have not lost much; and, if\r\nthe rules of this ship are so stringent I suppose we must\r\nsubmit.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain afterwards came to Barnum and apologized for the rude\r\nmanner in which he had carried out the rules of the ship. Barnum\r\nwas not at the time a teetotaler, and the two men \"washed down\"\r\ntheir differences in a bottle of champagne, and were excellent\r\nfriends from that moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. AT HOME.\r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIP WITH TOM THUMB--VISIT TO CUBA--IRANISTAN, HIS FAMOUS\r\nPALACE AT BRIDGEPORT--AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES--BARNUM'S\r\nGAME-KEEPER AND THE GREAT GAME DINNER--FRANK LESLIE.\r\n\r\nOne of Barnum's principal objects in returning to America at this\r\ntime was to insure the permanence of his \"American Museum.\" He\r\nhad a lease of the property, which had yet three years to run.\r\nBut he wanted to make sure of it after that term had expired. Mr.\r\nOlmsted, the former owner, was now dead, and It was not certain\r\nthat the new proprietor would renew the lease. If not, another\r\nhome for the great show must be secured, and Barnum decided that\r\nin that event he would buy land on Broadway and erect a building\r\nto suit him. The new owner of the old property was persuaded,\r\nhowever, to renew the lease for a term of twenty-five years. The\r\nbuilding covered an area of fifty-six by one hundred feet and was\r\nfour stories high. Barnum agreed to pay for it a rental of\r\n$10,000 a year in addition to the taxes and all assessments.\r\nThen, as the place was not large enough for his purposes, he\r\nrented and connected with it the upper floors of several adjacent\r\nbuildings. The Museum was at this time enormously prosperous, and\r\nwas thronged with visitors from morning to late at night.\r\n\r\nTom Thumb's European reputation was of course a great\r\nadvertisement, and it was \"worked for all it was worth.\" He\r\nappeared at the Museum daily for four weeks, and drew such crowds\r\nof visitors as had never been seen there before. He afterwards\r\nspent a month in Bridgeport with his kindred. To prevent being\r\nannoyed by the curious, who would be sure to throng the houses of\r\nhis relatives, he exhibited two days at Bridgeport, and the\r\nreceipts, amounting to several hundred dollars, were presented to\r\nthe Bridgeport Charitable Society.\r\n\r\nBarnum's contract with Tom Thumb had expired on January 1, 1845,\r\nwhile they were in England, and they had then formed a\r\npartnership, dividing equally between them the profits of their\r\nenterprise; excepting during the first four weeks of their return\r\nto New York, during which time the General waived his partnership\r\nrights and exhibited himself for a salary of $50 a week. Mr.\r\nStratton, Tom Thumb's father, was now a rich man, and he settled\r\na handsome fortune upon his tiny son.\r\n\r\nSoon a tour of America was arranged, the party consisting of Mr.\r\nBarnum and Tom Thumb and his parents. They began at Washington,\r\nin April, 1847, where they visited President and Mrs. Polk at the\r\nWhite House. Thence they went to Richmond, to Baltimore, and to\r\nPhiladelphia, where they took in  $5,594.91 in twelve days. Next\r\nthey visited Boston and Lowell; Providence, where they received\r\nnearly $1,000 in a day; New Bedford, Fall River, Salem,\r\nWorcester, Springfield, Albany, Troy, Niagara Falls, Buffalo and\r\nvarious other places. During the whole year's tour their receipts\r\naveraged from $400 to $500 per day, and their expenses only from\r\n$25 to $30. On their way back to New York they stopped at all\r\nlarge towns along the Hudson river, and then went to New Haven,\r\nHartford, Portland and some other New England cities.\r\n\r\nAbsence did not make them forgotten in New York, however, but\r\nonly increased public interest in them. When he returned to his\r\nMuseum Mr. Barnum found that he himself had come to be regarded\r\nas one of its chief curiosities. \"If I showed myself about the\r\nMuseum, or wherever else I was known, I found eyes peering and\r\nfingers pointing at me, and could frequently overhear the remark,\r\n'There's Barnum.' On one occasion, soon after my return, I was\r\nsitting in the ticket-office, reading a newspaper. A man came and\r\npurchased a ticket of admission. 'Is Mr. Barnum in the Museum?'\r\nhe asked. The ticket-seller, pointing to me, answered, 'This is\r\nMr. Barnum.' Supposing the gentleman had business with me, I\r\nlooked up from the paper. 'Is this Mr. Barnum?' he asked. 'It\r\nis,' I replied. He stared at me for a moment, and then, throwing\r\ndown his ticket, exclaimed, 'It's all right; I have got the worth\r\nof my money;' and away he went, without going into the Museum at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1847 they went South, visiting and giving\r\nexhibitions at Charleston, Columbia, Augusta, Savannah,\r\nMilledgeville, Macon, Columbus, Montgomery, Mobile and New\r\nOrleans. At the last-named place they spent three weeks,\r\nincluding the Christmas holidays. After New Year's they went to\r\nCuba, and were received at Havana by the Captain-General and the\r\naristocracy of the city. For a month they gave exhibitions in\r\nHavana and Matanzas with great success. The only serious drawback\r\nwas the hotels, which they did not find good; indeed, it was\r\ndifficult for them to get enough to eat. The Washington House, at\r\nHavana, where they lived for some time, was characterized by Mr.\r\nBarnum as \"first-rate bad!\"\r\n\r\nFrom Cuba they returned to New Orleans, and thence to New York by\r\nway of the Mississippi river, St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati\r\nand Pittsburg. And then, in May, 1848, it was agreed that Barnum\r\nshould travel no more with the little General. \"I had,\" says\r\nBarnum, \"competent agents who could exhibit him without my\r\npersonal assistance, and I preferred to relinquish a portion of\r\nthe profits rather than continue to be a travelling showman. I\r\nhad now been a straggler from home most of the time for thirteen\r\nyears, and I cannot describe the feelings of gratitude with which\r\nI reflected that, having by the most arduous toil and\r\ndeprivations succeeded in securing a satisfactory competence, I\r\nshould henceforth spend my days in the bosom of my family.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum had selected the city of Bridgeport, Conn., for his home,\r\nand thither he now repaired. He wanted to be near New York, and\r\nhe considered the northern shore of Long Island Sound the most\r\nbeautiful country he had ever seen. Bridgeport was about the\r\nright distance from New York, and was well situated. It was also\r\nan enterprising place, with the promise of a prosperous future.\r\nSome three or four years before this time Barnum had purchased\r\nseventeen acres of land at the western side of the city, and for\r\ntwo years had been building a palace upon it, the famous\r\n\"Iranistan,\" which was now nearly ready for him to occupy.\r\n\r\nIn telling how he came to erect this gorgeous and eccentric home,\r\nBarnum once said that in visiting Brighton, England, he had been\r\ngreatly pleased with the pavilion built there by George IV. It\r\nwas at that time the only specimen of Oriental architecture in\r\nEngland, and the style had not been introduced into America. \"I\r\nconcluded to adopt it, and engaged a London architect to furnish\r\nme a set of drawings after the general plan of the pavilion,\r\ndiffering sufficiently to be adapted to the spot of ground\r\nselected for my homestead. On my second return visit to the\r\nUnited States, I brought these drawings with me and engaged a\r\ncompetent architect and builder, giving him instructions to\r\nproceed with the work, not 'by the job' but 'by the day,' and to\r\nspare neither time nor expense in erecting a comfortable,\r\nconvenient, and tasteful residence. The work was thus begun and\r\ncontinued while I was still abroad, and during the time when I\r\nwas making my tour with General Tom Thumb through the United\r\nStates and Cuba. Elegant and appropriate furniture was made\r\nexpressly for every room in the house. I erected expensive\r\nwater-works to supply the premises. The stables, conservatories\r\nand out-buildings were perfect in their kind. There was a\r\nprofusion of trees set out on the grounds. The whole was built\r\nand established literally 'regardless of expense,' for I had no\r\ndesire even to ascertain the entire cost.\"\r\n\r\nInto this splendid place he moved on November 14, 1848, nearly a\r\nthousand fellow-citizens of Bridgeport, rich and poor alike,\r\nparticipating in the \"housewarming\" as his guests. The estate was\r\ncalled, in reference to its Oriental appearance, Iranistan, which\r\nbeing interpreted means \"a Persian home.\" This name was the\r\nsubject of many a joke, as the place itself was of much\r\nwonderment and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe next two years were spent by Mr. Barnum chiefly at home with\r\nhis family, though he paid frequent visits to his various places\r\nof business and amusement; business for him, amusement for the\r\nworld. He had for several years a fine Museum in Baltimore, which\r\nwas afterward the property of John E. Owens, the actor. In 1849\r\nhe also opened a Museum in Philadelphia, at the corner of\r\nChestnut and Seventh streets. He spent some time in Philadelphia,\r\nuntil the Museum was profitably established, and then turned it\r\nover to a manager. Two years later he sold it for a good price.\r\nWhile he was running it, however, his old rival, Peale, conducted\r\na strong opposition show in Masonic Hall, near by. The\r\ncompetition between them proved disastrous to Peale, who failed\r\nand was sold out by the sheriff. Barnum and his friend, Moses\r\nKimball, purchased most of his effects and divided them between\r\nBarnum's American Museum in New York and Kimball's Museum in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nBarnum took an active interest in the affairs of Bridgeport and\r\nof the State of Connecticut. In 1848, soon after settling in\r\nIranistan, he was elected President of the Fairfield County\r\nAgricultural Society. He was not much of a practical farmer,\r\nalthough he had bought a hundred or more acres of farm land near\r\nhis residence and felt a deep interest in agricultural affairs.\r\nHe had imported a lot of choice livestock, which he had at\r\nIranistan, and had gone pretty deeply into fancy poultry raising.\r\nSo he was considered eligible to the office of President of the\r\nAgricultural Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the Society insisted that he should deliver the annual\r\naddress. \"I begged to be excused on the ground of incompetency,\"\r\nhe said, \"but my excuses were of no avail, and as I could not\r\ninstruct my auditors in farming, I gave them the benefit of\r\nseveral mistakes which I had committed. Among other things, I\r\ntold them that in the fall of 1848 my head-gardener reported that\r\nI had fifty bushels of potatoes to spare. I thereupon directed\r\nhim to barrel them up and ship them to New York for sale. He did\r\nso, and received two dollars per barrel, or about sixty-seven\r\ncents per bushel. But, unfortunately, after the potatoes had been\r\nshipped, I found that my gardener had selected all the largest\r\nfor market, and left my family nothing but 'small potatoes' to\r\nlive on during the winter. But the worst was still to come. My\r\npotatoes were all gone before March, and I was obliged to buy,\r\nduring the spring, over fifty bushels of potatoes, at $1.25 per\r\nbushel! I also related my first experiment in the arboricultural\r\nline, when I cut from two thrifty rows of young cherry-trees any\r\nquantity of what I supposed to be 'suckers,' or 'sprouts,' and\r\nwas thereafter informed by my gardener that I had cut off all his\r\ngrafts!\"\r\n\r\nA friend of Barnum's, Mr. J. D. Johnson, had a fine place near\r\nIranistan; and Barnum owned a couple of acres just beyond and\r\nadjoining his property. This plot Barnum presently converted into\r\na deer park, stocking it with fine animals from the Rocky\r\nMountains. From its location, however, everybody supposed it to\r\nbe a part of Johnson's estate, and to confirm this notion--in a\r\nwaggish spirit--a member of Johnson's family put up in the park a\r\nconspicuous sign, which every passer-by on the street could read:\r\n\r\n\"All persons are forbid trespassing on these grounds, or\r\ndisturbing the deer.\r\n                   --J. D. JOHNSON.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum \"acknowledged the corn,\" and was much pleased with the\r\njoke. Johnson was delighted, and bragged considerably of having\r\ngot ahead of Barnum, and the sign remained undisturbed for\r\nseveral days. It happened, at length, that a party of friends\r\ncame to visit him from New York, arriving in the evening. Johnson\r\ntold them that he had got a capital joke on Barnum; he would not\r\nexplain, but said they should see it for themselves the next\r\nmorning. Bright and early he led them into the street, and, after\r\nconducting them a proper distance, wheeled them around in front\r\nof the sign. To his dismay he discovered that I had added\r\ndirectly under his name the words \"Game-keeper to P. T. Barnum.\"\r\n\r\nThereafter Mr. Johnson was known among his friends and\r\nacquaintances as \"Barnum's gamekeeper.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson had his revenge, however. Some time afterward Barnum\r\nbecame president of the Pequonnock Bank, and gave each year a\r\ngrand dinner at Iranistan to the directors. In preparing for\r\nthese banquets he would send to the West for some boxes of\r\nprairie chickens and other choice game. So, one day, Johnson saw\r\na big case at the railroad station, addressed to Barnum, and\r\nmarked \"Game.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said he to the station-master, \"I am Mr. Barnum's\r\ngame-keeper, and I'll take charge of that!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did so, taking it to his house, and then notifying Barnum\r\nthat it could only be redeemed at cost of a new hat. He knew very\r\nwell that Barnum would rather give him a dozen hats than lose the\r\nbox; and he added that unless he got the hat very soon he would\r\ngive a game dinner on his own account! Barnum sent an order for\r\nthe hat in a hurry, and recovered his game, enjoying the whole\r\njoke as much as Johnson did.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Mr. Frank Leslie, afterward famous as a publisher, came\r\nto America, bringing letters of introduction to Barnum from\r\nfriends in England, and Barnum gave him a start in business by\r\nemploying him to prepare an elaborate illustrated catalogue of\r\nthe American Museum. This he did in an admirable manner, and\r\nhundreds of thousands of copies of it were distributed throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. JENNY LIND.\r\n\r\nDARING VENTURE--BARNUM'S AMBASSADOR--UNPRECEDENTED TERMS\r\nOFFERED--TEXT OF THE CONTRACT--HARD WORK TO RAISE THE GUARANTEE\r\nFUND--EDUCATING THE AMERICAN MIND TO RECEIVE THE FAMOUS SINGER.\r\n\r\nThe next enterprise undertaken by Barnum was an entirely new\r\ndeparture. It was justly regarded by him as bold in its\r\nconception, complete in its development, and astounding in its\r\nsuccess. To the end of his days he looked upon it with pride and\r\nsatisfaction. Probably it did more than anything else in all his\r\ncareer to give him a permanent and supreme position in the esteem\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nThis enterprise was the bringing of Jenny Lind to America for a\r\nconcert tour.\r\n\r\nMiss Lind, often called the \"Swedish Nightingale,\" was one of the\r\nmost remarkable singers of the world, in that or any generation.\r\nAll Europe was enraptured by her art, and her fame had encircled\r\nthe globe. Barnum had never heard her, as she had not visited\r\nLondon until a few weeks after his return to America. But her\r\nreputation was enough to determine him to engage her, if\r\npossible, for an American tour. So he sent Mr. J. H. Wilton, an\r\nEnglish musician, who was visiting New York, back to London to\r\nnegotiate terms with her. Barnum agreed to pay Wilton his\r\nexpenses if he had to return without her; but a handsome sum if\r\nhe succeeded in bringing the songstress to America with him. He\r\ntold Wilton to engage her on shares if possible. If not, to\r\nengage her for any sum up to a thousand dollars a night, for any\r\nnumber of nights up to 150, besides paying all her expenses,\r\nincluding servants, carriages, etc., and not more than three\r\nmusical assistants. He also offered to secure her by placing the\r\nwhole $150,000 in the hands of her London bankers in advance!\r\n\r\nWilton went to London, had some correspondence with her, and then\r\nwent to Lubeck, where she was singing. She told him frankly that\r\nshe had, since he first wrote to her, been busy making inquiries\r\nabout Barnum's character, trustworthiness, etc., and that she was\r\nperfectly satisfied with what she had found out. There were,\r\nhowever, four other men negotiating with her to the same end. One\r\nof these gentlemen was a well-known opera manager in London;\r\nanother, a theatrical manager in Manchester; a third, a musical\r\ncomposer and conductor of the orchestra of Her Majesty's Opera in\r\nLondon; and the fourth, Chevalier Wyckoff, who had conducted a\r\nsuccessful speculation some years previously by visiting America\r\nin charge of the celebrated danseuse, Fanny Ellsler.\r\n\r\nShe also insisted that, under whatever auspices she should go to\r\nAmerica, she should have as an accompanist Mr.--afterwards\r\nSir--Julius Benedict, the composer, and Signor Belletti, an\r\neminent Italian singer.\r\n\r\nFinally, on January 9, 1850, Wilton succeeded in his mission.\r\nMiss Lind agreed to come to America under Barnum's management,\r\nand an elaborate contract was drawn up and signed This historic\r\ndocument was as follows:\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM of an agreement entered into this ninth day of\r\nJanuary, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\r\nfifty, between John Hall Wilton, as agent for PHINEAS T. BARNUM,\r\nof New York, in the United States of North America, of the one\r\npart, and Mademoiselle JENNY LIND, Vocalist, of Stockholm, in\r\nSweden, of the other part, wherein the said Jenny Lind doth\r\nagree:\r\n\r\nFirst. To sing for the said Phineas T. Barnum in one hundred and\r\nfifty concerts, including oratorios within (if possible) one year\r\nor eighteen months from the date of her arrival in the city of\r\nNew York--the said concerts to be given in the United States of\r\nNorth America and Havana. She, the said Jenny Lind, having full\r\ncontrol as to the number of nights or concerts in each week, and\r\nthe number of pieces in which she will sing in each concert, to\r\nbe regulated conditionally with her health and safety of voice,\r\nbut the former never less than one or two, nor the latter less\r\nthan four; but in no case to appear in operas.\r\n\r\nSecond. In consideration of said services, the said John Hall\r\nWilton, as agent for the said Phineas T. Barnum, of New York,\r\nagrees to furnish the said Jenny Lind with a servant as\r\nwaiting-maid, and a male servant to and for the sole service of\r\nher and her party; to pay the travelling and hotel expenses of a\r\nfriend to accompany her as a companion; to pay also a secretary\r\nto superintend her finances; to pay all her and her party's\r\ntravelling expenses from Europe, and during the tour in the\r\nUnited States of North America and Havana; to pay all hotel\r\nexpenses for board and lodging during the same period; to place\r\nat her disposal in each city a carriage and horses with their\r\nnecessary attendants, and to give her in addition the sum of two\r\nhundred pounds sterling, or one thousand dollars, for each\r\nconcert or oratorio in which the said Jenny Lind shall sing.\r\n\r\nThird. And the said John Hall Wilton, as agent for the said\r\nPhineas T. Barnum, doth further agree to give the said Jenny Lind\r\nthe most satisfactory security and assurance for the full amount\r\nof her engagement, which will be placed in the hands of Messrs.\r\nBaring Brothers, of London, previous to the departure, and\r\nsubject to the order of the said Jenny Lind, with its interest\r\ndue on its current reduction by her services in the concerts or\r\noratorios.\r\n\r\nFourth. And the said John Hall Wilton, on the part of the said\r\nPhineas T. Barnum, further agrees, that should the said Phineas\r\nT. Barnum, after seventy-five concerts, have realized so much as\r\nshall, after paying all current expenses, have returned to him\r\nall the sums disbursed, either as deposits at interest, for\r\nsecurities of salaries, preliminary outlay, or moneys in any way\r\nexpended consequent on this engagement, and in addition, have\r\ngained a clear profit of at least fifteen thousand pounds\r\nsterling, then the said Phineas T. Barnum will give the said\r\nJenny Lind, in addition to the former sum of one thousand dollars\r\ncurrent money of the United States of North America, nightly,\r\none-fifth part of the profits arising from the remaining\r\nseventy-five concerts or oratorios, after deducting every expense\r\ncurrent and appertaining thereto; or the said Jenny Lind agrees\r\nto try, with the said Phineas T. Barnum, fifty concerts or\r\noratorios on the aforesaid and first-named terms, and if then\r\nfound to fall short of the expectations of the said Phineas T.\r\nBarnum, then the said Jenny Lind agrees to reorganize this\r\nagreement, on terms quoted in his first proposal, as set forth in\r\nthe annexed copy of his letter; but should such be found\r\nnecessary, then the engagement continues up to seventy-five\r\nconcerts or oratorios, at the end of which, should the aforesaid\r\nprofit of fifteen thousand pounds sterling have not been\r\nrealized, then the engagement shall continue as at first--the\r\nsums herein, after expenses for Julius Benedict and Giovanni\r\nBelletti, to remain unaltered, except for advancement.\r\n\r\nFifth. And the said John Hall Wilton, agent for the said Phineas\r\nT. Barnum, at the request of the said Jenny Lind, agrees to pay\r\nto Julius Benedict, of London, to accompany the said Jenny Lind,\r\nas musical director, pianist, and superintendent of the musical\r\ndepartment, also to assist the said Jenny Lind in one hundred and\r\nfifty concerts or oratorios, to be given in the United States of\r\nNorth America and Havana, the sum of five thousand pounds\r\n(L5,000) sterling, to be satisfactorily secured to him with\r\nMessrs. Baring Brothers, of London, previous to his departure\r\nfrom Europe, and the said John Hall Wilton agrees further, for\r\nthe said Phineas T. Barnum, to pay all his travelling expenses\r\nfrom Europe, together with his hotel and travelling expenses\r\nduring the time occupied in giving the aforesaid one hundred and\r\nfifty concerts or oratorios--he, the said Julius Benedict, to\r\nsuperintend the organization of oratorios if required.\r\n\r\nSixth. And the said John Hall Wilton, at the request, selection,\r\nand for the aid of the said Jenny Lind, agrees to pay to Giovanni\r\nBelletti, barytone vocalist, to accompany the said Jenny Lind\r\nduring her tour and in one hundred and fifty concerts or\r\noratorios in the United States of North America and Havana, and\r\nin conjunction with the aforesaid Julius Benedict, the sum of two\r\nthousand five hundred pounds (L2,500) sterling, to be\r\nsatisfactorily secured to him previous to his departure from\r\nEurope, in addition to all his hotel and travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nSeventh. And it is further agreed that the said Jenny Lind shall\r\nbe at full liberty to sing at any time she may think fit for\r\ncharitable institutions, or purposes independent of the\r\nengagement with the said Phineas T. Barnum, with a view to\r\nmutually agreeing as to the time and its propriety, it being\r\nunderstood that in no case shall the first or second concert in\r\nany city selected for the tour be for such purpose, or wherever\r\nit shall appear against the interests of the said Phineas T.\r\nBarnum.\r\n\r\nEighth. It is further agreed that should the said Jenny Lind, by\r\nany act of God, be incapacitated to fulfil the entire engagement\r\nbefore mentioned, that an equal proportion of the terms agreed\r\nupon shall be given to the said Jenny Lind, Julius Benedict, and\r\nGiovanni Belletti, for services rendered to that time.\r\n\r\nNinth. It is further agreed and understood, that the said Phineas\r\nT. Barnum shall pay every expense appertaining to the concerts or\r\noratorios before mentioned, excepting those for charitable\r\npurposes, and that all accounts shall be settled and rendered by\r\nall parties weekly.\r\n\r\nTenth. And the said Jenny Lind further agrees that she will not\r\nengage to sing for any other person during the progress of this\r\nsaid engagement with the said Phineas T. Barnum, of New York, for\r\none hundred and fifty concerts or oratorios, excepting for\r\ncharitable purposes as before mentioned; and all travelling to be\r\nfirst and best class.\r\n\r\nIn witness hereof to the within written memorandum of agreement\r\nwe set hereunto our hand and seal.\r\n\r\n[L.

In reply to your proposal to attempt a negotiation with\r\nMlle. Jenny Lind to visit the United States professionally, I\r\npropose to enter into an arrangement with her to the following\r\neffect: I will engage to pay all her expenses from Europe,\r\nprovide for and pay for one principal tenor, and one pianist,\r\ntheir salaries not exceeding together one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars per night; to support for her a carriage, two servants,\r\nand a friend to accompany her and superintend her finances. I\r\nwill furthermore pay all and every expense appertaining to her\r\nappearance before the public, and give her half of the gross\r\nreceipts arising from concerts or operas. I will engage to travel\r\nwith her personally, and attend to the arrangements, provided she\r\nwill undertake to give not less than eighty, nor more than one\r\nhundred and fifty concerts, or nights' performances.\r\n           PHINEAS T. BARNUM.\r\n\r\nI certify the above to be a true extract from the letter.\r\n            J. H. WILTON.\r\n\r\nThere was no Atlantic cable in those days, and Barnum did not\r\nknow the result of Wilton's embassy until the latter returned to\r\nAmerica. Barnum was in Philadelphia when Wilton landed in New\r\nYork, on February 19. Wilton at once telegraphed to him that he\r\nhad secured the singer, who was to come over and begin her\r\nconcerts in September. The great showman was startled, and felt\r\npretty nervous; and as so long a time was to elapse before she\r\ncame over, he thought it best to keep the whole matter a secret\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect how thoroughly Jenny Lind, her musical powers,\r\nher character, and wonderful successes, were subsequently known\r\nby all classes in this country as well as throughout the\r\ncivilized world, it is difficult to realize that, at the time\r\nthis engagement was made, she was comparatively unknown on this\r\nside the water. We can hardly credit the fact that millions of\r\npersons in America had never heard of her, that other millions\r\nhad merely read her name, but had no distinct idea of who or what\r\nshe was. Only a small portion of the public were really aware of\r\nher great musical triumphs in the Old World, and this portion was\r\nconfined almost entirely to musical people, travellers who had\r\nvisited the Old World, and the conductors of the press.\r\n\r\nBarnum telegraphed to Wilton to keep the matter secret, and next\r\nmorning set out for New York. But it was too late. When he got to\r\nNew York, he found the news of the engagement in full in all the\r\npapers. Everybody was talking about it, and wondering who Jenny\r\nLind was, and Barnum soon perceived that he must improve the\r\ntime, from then to September, in educating the public up to an\r\napproximate appreciation of her worth.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to send, as per agreement, the sum of $187,000\r\nto Miss Lind's bankers in London. It was not altogether easy for\r\nhim to do this. After he had scraped together all his available\r\ncash he was still short a large sum. He had plenty of securities\r\nin the form of second mortgages that were perfectly good, but no\r\none in Wall street would lend him a dollar on them.\r\n\r\nIn his extremity, he at last went to the president of the bank\r\nwhere he had transacted his business for the past eight years. \"I\r\noffered him,\" said Barnum afterward, \"as security for a loan, my\r\nsecond mortgages, and, as additional security, I offered to make\r\nover to him my contract with Jenny Lind, with a written guaranty\r\nthat he should appoint a receiver, who, at my expense, should\r\ntake charge of all the receipts over and above $3,000 per night,\r\nand appropriate them toward the payment of my loan He laughed in\r\nmy face, and said: 'Mr. Barnum, it is generally believed in Wall\r\nstreet that your engagement with Jenny Lind will ruin you. I do\r\nnot think you will ever receive so much as $3,000 at a single\r\nconcert.' I was indignant at his want of appreciation, and\r\nanswered him that I would not at that moment take $150,000 for my\r\ncontract; nor would I. I found, upon further inquiry, that it was\r\nuseless in Wall street to offer the 'Nightingale' in exchange for\r\n'Goldfinches.' I finally was introduced to Mr. John L. Aspinwall,\r\nof the firm of Messrs. Howland & Aspinwall, and he gave me a\r\nletter of credit from his firm on Baring Brothers, for a large\r\nsum on collateral securities, which a spirit of genuine respect\r\nfor my enterprise induced him to accept.\r\n\r\n\"After disposing of several pieces of property for cash, I footed\r\nup the various amounts, and still discovered myself $5,000 short.\r\nI felt that it was indeed the last feather that breaks the\r\ncamel's back.' Happening casually to state my desperate case to\r\nthe Rev. Abel C. Thomas, of Philadelphia, for many years a friend\r\nof mine, he promptly placed the requisite amount at my disposal.\r\nI gladly accepted his proffered friendship, and felt that he had\r\nremoved a mountain-weight from my shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now nothing remained to do but to arouse public curiosity and\r\ninterest. Barnum was a master-hand at that work, and never did he\r\nshow himself more of a master than on this occasion. He kept the\r\npress literally teeming with notices in one form or another. Here\r\nis a sample of the strain in which he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I may not make any money by this enterprise; but I\r\nassure you that if I knew I should not make a farthing profit, I\r\nwould ratify the engagement, so anxious am I that the United\r\nStates should be visited by a lady whose vocal powers have never\r\nbeen approached by any other human being, and whose character is\r\ncharity, simplicity, and goodness personified.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lind has great anxiety to visit America. She speaks of this\r\ncountry and its institutions in the highest terms of praise. In\r\nher engagement with me (which includes Havana), she expressly\r\nreserves the right to give charitable concerts whenever she\r\nthinks proper.\r\n\r\nSince her debut in England, she has given to the poor from her\r\nown private purse more than the whole amount which I have engaged\r\nto pay her, and the proceeds of concerts for charitable purposes\r\nin Great Britain, where she has sung gratuitously, have realized\r\nmore than ten times that amount.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that, before September rolled around,\r\ncuriosity, interest and enthusiasm over the great singer were at\r\nfever heat, and New York thought and dreamed only of her coming.\r\n\r\nNever, in the history of music or in the history of\r\nentertainments in America, has the advent of a foreign artist\r\nbeen hailed with so much enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nA large share of this public interest was natural and genuine,\r\nand would, in any event, have been accorded to Miss Lind. But a\r\nconsiderable portion of it was due to the shrewd and energetic\r\nadvertising of Mr. Barnum. Under any auspices the great singer's\r\ntour in America would have been successful; but under no other\r\nmanagement would it have approximated to what it was under\r\nBarnum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. ARRIVAL OF JENNY LIND.\r\n\r\nFIRST MEETING WITH BARNUM--RECEPTION IN NEW YORK--POEMS IN HER\r\nHONOR--A FURORE OF PUBLIC INTEREST--SALE OF TICKETS FOR THE FIRST\r\nCONCERT--BARNUM'S CHANGE IN TERMS--TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR\r\nCHARITY--ENORMOUS SUCCESS OF THE FIRST CONCERT.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind sailed for America on Wednesday morning, August 21,\r\n1850. She was accompanied by Messrs. Benedict and Belletti, Mr.\r\nWilton, her two cousins, and three or four servants. She also\r\nbrought with her a piano for her use. Mr. Barnum had engaged the\r\nnecessary accommodations for the company on the steamship\r\nAtlantic, and their departure from England was an event of great\r\npublic interest. In America their coming was looked upon much as\r\nthe visit of a royal personage would have been. It was expected\r\nthat the steamer would reach New York on Sunday, September 1st.\r\nMr. Barnum, however, determined to be on hand to meet his\r\ndistinguished guest at no matter what time she reached the port.\r\nHe, therefore, went on Saturday to Staten Island, and spent the\r\nnight at the house of his friend, Dr. Doane, the health officer\r\nof the port.\r\n\r\nThe steamship was sighted just before noon on Sunday, and soon\r\nafterward Mr. Barnum, who went out with the health officer, was\r\nstanding on the deck where, for the first time, he met the famous\r\nsinger. After they had shaken hands and uttered a few commonplace\r\nwords of greeting Miss Lind asked him when and where he had heard\r\nher sing.\r\n\r\n\"I never had the pleasure of seeing you before in my life,\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"How is it possible that you dared risk so much money on a person\r\nwhom you never heard sing?\" she asked in great surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I risked it,\" answered Barnum, \"on your reputation, which in\r\nmusical matters I would much rather trust than my own judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, although Barnum did rely largely upon Miss\r\nLind's reputation as an artist, he also took into account her\r\nequally great reputation for benevolence, generosity and general\r\nloveliness of disposition. He knew that these traits of character\r\nwould appeal with a special force to the warm-hearted and\r\nenthusiastic American public. Indeed, he afterward confessed that\r\nhad it not been for this peculiarity of her disposition, he never\r\nwould have ventured to make the engagement with her; and he\r\nalways believed that as many people came to see and hear her on\r\nthis account as on account of her skill as a singer.\r\n\r\nSeldom has any visitor to New York received a more remarkable\r\ngreeting than did the \"Swedish Nightingale.\" Mr. Barnum's efforts\r\nto arouse public interest in her had not been in vain. The whole\r\ncity was anxious to get the first possible glimpse of her. But\r\nbeside this bona fide interest in her, Mr. Barnum had seen to it\r\nthat her landing was made all possible use of as an\r\nadvertisement. On the wharf at which she landed a bower of green\r\ntrees, decorated with flags, had been prepared. There were also\r\ntwo handsome triumphal arches, on one of which was inscribed,\r\n\"Welcome, Jenny Lind!\" and on the other, \"Welcome to America!\"\r\n\r\nProbably the singer thought, and possibly some of the general\r\npublic also imagined, that these decorations had been erected by\r\nthe city government, or at least by some committee of\r\npublic-spirited citizens. Mr. Barnum, however, never found fault\r\nwith any one for suspecting that he was chiefly responsible for\r\nthem, and there is every reason to believe that the cost of them\r\nwas to be found entered in his books, charged to the account of\r\nadvertising.\r\n\r\nThousands of people were thronged along the water front, on the\r\npiers and on the shipping, to greet the Atlantic as it reached\r\nits dock. So great was the rush to see the illustrious guest that\r\none man was crowded overboard, an incident which Miss Lind\r\nherself witnessed, and at which she was much alarmed. He was\r\nrescued with no other harm than a thorough wetting. Barnum's\r\ncarriage was in waiting for Miss Lind, and the great showman\r\nhimself, after placing her within it, mounted the box at the\r\ndriver's side. He took that seat as a legitimate advertisement,\r\nand his presence there aided those who filled the windows and\r\nsidewalks along the entire way to the Irving House, and there\r\nwere many thousands of them, in coming to the conclusion that\r\nJenny Lind had really arrived.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after Miss Lind had entered the hotel, Barnum\r\ninvited her to look out of a window opening on Broadway. When she\r\ndid so she saw a throng of not less than twenty thousand persons\r\ngathered to do her honor. And there that throng remained all the\r\nrest of the afternoon and until late in the evening. At her\r\nrequest Barnum took dinner with her that afternoon. According to\r\nthe European custom she offered to pledge his health in a glass\r\nof wine, and was doubtless much surprised at his response. He\r\nsaid to her: \"Miss Lind, I do not think you can ask any other\r\nfavor on earth which I would not gladly grant. But I am a\r\nteetotaler, and must beg to be permitted to drink to your health\r\nand happiness in a glass of cold water.\"\r\n\r\nLate that night Miss Lind was serenaded by the New York Musical\r\nFund Society, which numbered, on that occasion, two hundred\r\nmusicians. They were escorted to the hotel by about three hundred\r\nfiremen, clad in their picturesque uniform and bearing flaming\r\ntorches. Fully thirty thousand spectators were at this hour\r\ngathered about the hotel, and in response to their vociferous\r\ncalls Miss Lind stepped upon the balcony and bowed to them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the great singer's first day in America, and for several\r\nweeks thereafter the public interest in her was scarcely less\r\ndemonstrative. Her rooms were thronged by visitors, among whom\r\nwere the most notable people in society, in the learned\r\nprofessions and in public life. The street before the hotel was\r\nalmost blocked day after day by the carriages of fashionable\r\npeople, and Barnum's only anxiety was lest the aristocratic part\r\nof the community should monopolize her altogether, and thus mar\r\nhis interest by cutting her off from the sympathy she had excited\r\namong the common people. The shop-keepers of the city showered\r\ntheir attentions upon her, sending her cart-loads of specimens of\r\ntheir most valuable wares, for which they asked no other return\r\nthan her acceptance and her autograph acknowledgment. Gloves,\r\nbonnets, shawls, gowns, chairs, carriages, pianos, and almost\r\nevery imaginable article of use or ornament was named for her.\r\nSongs and musical compositions were dedicated to her, and poems\r\nwere published in her honor. Day after day and week after week\r\nher doings formed the most conspicuous news in the daily\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nSome weeks before Miss Lind's arrival in America Barnum had\r\noffered a prize of two hundred dollars for the best ode, to be\r\nset to music and sung by her at her first concert. Its topic was\r\nto be, \"Greeting to America.\" In response several hundred poems\r\nwere sent in, mostly pretty poor stuff; though several of them\r\nwere very good. After a great deal of hard work in reading and\r\nconsidering them, the Prize Committee selected as the best the\r\none offered by Bayard Taylor. It was set to music by Julius\r\nBenedict, and was as follows:\r\n\r\nGREETING TO AMERICA\r\n\r\nWORDS BY BAYARD TAYLOR--MUSIC BY JULIUS BENEDICT.\r\n\r\n I greet with a full heart the Land of the West,\r\n     Whose Banner of Stars o'er a world is unrolled;\r\n Whose empire o'ershadows Atlantic's wide breast,\r\n     And opens to sunset its gateway of gold!\r\n The land of the mountain, the land of the lake,\r\n     And rivers that roll in magnificent tide--\r\n Where the souls of the mighty from slumber awake,\r\n     And hallow the soil for whose freedom they died!\r\n\r\n Thou Cradle of empire! though wide be the foam\r\n     That severs the land of my fathers and thee,\r\n I hear, from thy bosom, the welcome of home,\r\n     For song has a home in the hearts of the Free!\r\n And long as thy waters shall gleam in the sun,\r\n     And long as thy heroes remember their scars,\r\n Be the hands of thy children united as one,\r\n     And Peace shed her light on thy Banner of Stars!\r\n\r\n This award gave general satisfaction, although a few\r\ndisappointed competitors complained. This remarkable competition\r\nand the other features of Miss Lind's reception in America,\r\nattracted so much attention in England that the London Times in\r\none day devoted several columns of space to the subject.\r\n\r\nOf course the American press literally teemed with matter about\r\nMiss Lind and Barnum. The poetical competition demanded much\r\nattention, and presently a witty pamphlet was published, entitled\r\n\"Barnum's Parnassus; being Confidential Disclosures of the Prize\r\nCommittee on the Jenny Lind Song.\" It pretended to give all or\r\nmost of the poems that had been offered in the competition,\r\nthough of course none of them were genuine. Many of them,\r\nhowever, contained fine satirical hits on the whole business;\r\nsuch, for example, as the following:\r\n\r\nBARNUMOPSIS.\r\n\r\nA RECITATIVE.\r\n\r\n When to the common rest that crowns his days,\r\n     Dusty and worn the tired pedestrian goes,\r\n What light is that whose wide o'erlooking blaze\r\n     A sudden glory on his pathway throws?\r\n\r\n 'Tis not the setting sun, whose drooping lid\r\n     Closed on the weary world at half-past six;\r\n 'Tis not the rising moon, whose rays are hid\r\n     Behind the city's sombre piles of bricks.\r\n\r\n  It is the Drummond Light, that from the top\r\n     Of Barnum's massive pile, sky-mingling there,\r\n Dart's its quick gleam o'er every shadowed shop,\r\n     And gilds Broadway with unaccustomed glare.\r\n\r\n  There o'er the sordid gloom, whose deep'ning tracks\r\n     Furrow the city's brow, the front of ages,\r\n Thy loftier light descends on cabs and hacks,\r\n     And on two dozen different lines of stages!\r\n\r\n O twilight Sun, with thy far darting ray,\r\n     Thou art a type of him whose tireless hands\r\n Hung thee on high to guide the stranger's way,\r\n     Where, in its pride, his vast Museum stands.\r\n\r\n Him, who in search of wonders new and strange,\r\n     Grasps the wide skirts of Nature's mystic robe\r\n Explores the circles of eternal change,\r\n     And the dark chambers of the central globe.\r\n\r\n He, from the reedy shores of fabled Nile,\r\n     Has brought, thick-ribbed and ancient as old iron,\r\n That venerable beast, the crocodile,\r\n     And many a skin of many a famous lion.\r\n\r\n  Go lose thyself in those continuous halls,\r\n     Where strays the fond papa with son and daughter;\r\n And all that charms or startles or appals,\r\n     Thou shalt behold, and for a single quarter.\r\n\r\n  Far from the Barcan deserts now withdrawn,\r\n     There, huge constrictors coil their scaly backs;\r\n There, cased in glass, malignant and unshorn,\r\n     Old murderers glare in sullenness and wax.\r\n\r\n  There many a varied form the sight beguiles,\r\n     In rusty broadcloth decked and shocking hat,\r\n And there the unwieldy Lambert sits and smiles,\r\n     In the majestic plenitude of fat.\r\n\r\n Or for thy gayer hours, the orang-outang\r\n     Or ape salutes thee with his strange grimace,\r\n And in their shapes, stuffed as on earth they sprang,\r\n     Thine individual being thou canst trace!\r\n\r\n  And joys the youth in life's green spring, who goes\r\n     With the sweet babe and the gray headed nurse,\r\n To see those Cosmoramic orbs disclose\r\n     The varied beauties of the universe.\r\n\r\n And last, not least, the marvellous Ethiope,\r\n     Changing his skin by preternatural skill,\r\n Whom every setting sun's diurnal slope\r\n     Leaves whiter than the last, and whitening still.\r\n\r\n  All that of monstrous, scaly, strange and queer,\r\n     Has come from out the womb of earliest time,\r\n Thou hast, O Barnum, in thy keeping here,\r\n     Nor is this all--for triumphs more sublime\r\n\r\n  Await thee yet! I, Jenny Lind, who reigned\r\n     Sublimely throned, the imperial queen of song,\r\n Wooed by thy golden harmonies, have deigned\r\n     Captive to join the heterogeneous throng.\r\n\r\n  Sustained by an unfaltering trust in coin,\r\n     Dealt from thy hand, O thou illustrious man,\r\n Gladly I heard the summons come to join\r\n     Myself the immeasurable caravan.\r\n\r\nA number of complimentary greetings in verse were also sent in to\r\nMiss Lind by various writers of more or less eminence, among them\r\nbeing the following from Mrs. Lydia H. Sigourney:\r\n\r\nTHE SWEDISH SONGSTRESS AND HER CHARITIES.\r\n\r\nBY MRS. L. H. SIGOURNEY.\r\n\r\n Blest must their vocation be\r\n Who, with tones of melody,\r\n Charm the discord and the strife\r\n And the railroad rush of life,\r\n\r\n And with Orphean magic move\r\n Souls inert to life and love.\r\n But there's one who doth inherit\r\n Angel gift and angel spirit,\r\n Bidding tides of gladness flow\r\n Through the realms of want and woe;\r\n 'Mid lone age and misery's lot,\r\n Kindling pleasures long forgot,\r\n Seeking minds oppressed with night,\r\n And on darkness shedding light,\r\n She the seraph's speech doth know,\r\n She hath done their deeds below;\r\n So, when o'er this misty strand\r\n She shall clasp their waiting hand,\r\n They will fold her to their breast,\r\n More a sister than a guest.\r\n\r\n The first concert was announced for the evening of September\r\n11th, and it was to take place in the great hall of Castle\r\nGarden, afterward famous as the landing-place for emigrants at\r\nNew York. The tickets for this occasion were sold at auction, and\r\nthe first one was bid up to the extraordinary figure of $225.\r\nThis was bid and the ticket was secured by John N. Genin, a\r\nhatter; and the public notice which was thereby attracted to him\r\nwas such a great advertisement for his business that within a few\r\nyears thereafter he amassed a fortune. It was afterward stated\r\nthat Mr. Genin was Barnum's brother-in-law, and that his high bid\r\nfor this ticket was a pre-arranged job; but there was no truth in\r\nthis whatever. The auction itself was regarded as an occasion of\r\nsuch public interest that the proprietors of the Garden, where it\r\nwas held, charged a shilling admission fee to it. No less than\r\n3,000 persons paid this fee and attended the auction, and the\r\nfirst day's sale aggregated 1,000 tickets, which brought a total\r\nsum of $10,141.\r\n\r\nA few days after her arrival Barnum told Miss Lind that it would\r\nbe desirable to make a change in the terms of their contract, if\r\nshe would consent. She was startled at this, and asked him what\r\nthe change was to be. \"I am convinced,\" replied Barnum, \"that\r\nthis enterprise will be far more successful than either of us\r\nanticipated. So I wish to stipulate that you shall receive not\r\nonly $1,000 for each concert, beside all expenses, but also that,\r\nafter taking out $5,500 per night for expenses and for my\r\nservices, the balance shall be equally divided between you and\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in utter bewilderment, unable to understand his\r\nproposition. He repeated it, and at last made her realize what it\r\nwas that he proposed to do. Then she grasped him by the hand and\r\nexclaimed: \"Mr. Barnum, you are a gentleman of honor; you are\r\ngenerous; it is just as I was told. I will sing for you as long\r\nas you please. I will sing for you in America--in\r\nEurope--anywhere!\"\r\n\r\nThe day before the first concert Mr. Barnum told Miss Lind that,\r\njudging by appearances, her portion of the proceeds of the first\r\nconcert, over and above her fee of $1,000, would amount to at\r\nleast $10,000. She immediately resolved to devote every dollar of\r\nit to charity, and forthwith sent for the Mayor of the city,\r\nunder whose advice she acted in selecting the various\r\ninstitutions among which it was to be distributed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money actually received for tickets for the first\r\nconcert was $17,864.05. So it appeared that Barnum's estimate had\r\nbeen a little too high, and Miss Lind's portion was too small to\r\nrealize the $10,000 which she was to give to charity. Barnum\r\ntherefore proposed to make a similar arrangement for the second\r\nconcert, and to count neither of these first two in the regular\r\nengagement. To this she agreed. The second concert was given on\r\nSeptember 13th, and the receipts, which amounted to $14,203.03,\r\nwere disposed of as before, and she was thus enabled to give the\r\n$10,000 to charity. The third concert, which was the first of the\r\nregular series, was given on September 17th.\r\n\r\nBarnum's arrangements of the concert-room for the singer's\r\nappearance were very complete. One hundred ushers, adorned with\r\nrosettes and carrying wands tipped with ribbons, looked after the\r\nseating of the audience. In order to prevent confusion the doors\r\nwere opened at five o'clock, although the concert was not to\r\ncommence until eight. The result was that the five thousand\r\npersons who attended made their entry without crowding and\r\nwithout confusion.\r\n\r\nThe reception of Jenny Lind, on her first appearance, in point of\r\nenthusiasm, was probably never before equalled. As Mr. Benedict\r\nled her towards the footlights, the entire audience rose to their\r\nfeet and welcomed her with three cheers, accompanied by the\r\nwaving of thousands of hats and handkerchiefs. This was perhaps\r\nthe largest audience to which Jenny Lind had ever sung. She was\r\nevidently much agitated, but the orchestra commenced, and before\r\nshe had sung a dozen notes of \"Casta Diva,\" she began to recover\r\nher self-possession, and long before the scena was concluded she\r\nwas as calm as if she was in her own drawing-room. Towards the\r\nlast portion of the cavatina, the audience were so completely\r\ncarried away by their feelings, that the remainder of the air was\r\ndrowned in a perfect tempest of acclamation. Enthusiasm had been\r\nwrought to its highest pitch, but the musical powers of Jenny\r\nLind exceeded all the brilliant anticipations which had been\r\nformed, and her triumph was complete. At the conclusion of the\r\nconcert Jenny Lind was loudly called for, and was obliged to\r\nappear three times before the audience could be satisfied. Then\r\nthey called vociferously for \"Barnum,\" and he \"reluctantly\"\r\nresponded to their demand.\r\n\r\nOn this first night Julius Benedict firmly established with the\r\nAmerican people his European reputation as a most accomplished\r\nconductor and musical composer; while Signor Belletti inspired an\r\nadmiration which grew warmer and deeper in the minds of the\r\npublic, to the end of his career in this country.\r\n\r\n\"The Rubicon was passed,\" says Barnum. \"The successful issue of\r\nthe Jenny Lind enterprise was established. I think there were a\r\nhundred men in New York, the day after her first concert, who\r\nwould have willingly paid me $200,000 for my contract. I received\r\nrepeated offers for an eighth, a tenth, or a sixteenth,\r\nequivalent to that price. But mine had been the risk, and I was\r\ndetermined mine should be the triumph.\"\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Jenny Lind is a legitimate part of Barnum's\r\nhistory, and it will be of interest to the present generation to\r\nread what the musical critics of that day thought of that\r\nwonderful singer. Here is the New York Tribune's account of her\r\nopening concerts in America:\r\n\r\n\"Jenny Lind's first concert is over, and all doubts are at an\r\nend. She is the greatest singer we have ever heard and her\r\nsuccess is all that was anticipated from her genius and her fame.\r\nAs this is something of an era in our history of art, we give a\r\ndetailed account of all that took place on the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"All the preparatory arrangements for the concert were made with\r\ngreat care, and from the admirable system observed, none of the\r\nusual disagreeable features of such an event were experienced.\r\nOutside of the gate there was a double row of policemen extending\r\nup the main avenue of the Battery grounds. Carriages only were\r\npermitted to drive up to the gate from the Whitehall side, and\r\npass off into Battery-place. At one time the line of carriages\r\nextended to Whitehall and up State street into Broadway.\r\nEverything was accomplished in a quiet and orderly manner. The\r\nchief of police, with about sixty men, came on the ground at 5\r\no'clock, and maintained the most complete order to the end.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum, according to promise, had put up a substantial\r\nframe-work, and thrown an immense awning over the bridge, which\r\nis some 200 feet in length. This was brilliantly lighted, and had\r\nalmost the appearance of a triumphal avenue on entering the gate.\r\n\r\n\"There was an immense crowd on the Battery, clustering around the\r\ngates during the whole evening, but no acts of disorder occurred.\r\nWhen Jenny Lind's carriage came, but very few persons knew it,\r\nand no great excitement followed. The principal annoyance was\r\noccasioned by a noisy crowd of boys in boats, who gathered around\r\nthe outer wall of the castle, and being by their position secure\r\nfrom the police, tried to disturb those within by a hideous\r\nclamor of shouts and yells, accompanied by a discordant din of\r\ndrums and fifes. There must have been more than 200 boats and a\r\nthousand persons on the water. They caused some annoyance to that\r\nportion of the audience in the back seats of the balcony, but the\r\nnuisance was felt by none in the parquet. By 10 o'clock they had\r\neither become tired or ashamed of the contemptible outrage they\r\nwere attempting, and dispersed. We may here remark that if the\r\nriver police asked for by Chief Matsell had been in existence\r\nthis attempt could not have been made.\r\n\r\n\"On entering the castle, a company of ushers, distinguished by\r\ntheir badges, were in readiness to direct the visitors to that\r\npart of the hall where their seats were located. Colored lamps\r\nand hangings suspended to the pillars indicated at a glance the\r\ndifferent divisions, and the task of seating the whole audience\r\nof near seven thousand persons was thus accomplished without the\r\nleast inconvenience. The hall was brilliantly lighted, though\r\nfrom its vast extent the stage looked somewhat dim. The wooden\r\npartition which was built up in place of the drop-curtain, is\r\ncovered with a painting representing the combined standards of\r\nAmerica and Sweden, below which are arabesque ornaments in white\r\nand gold. Considering the short time allowed for these\r\nimprovements, the change was remarkable. The only instance of bad\r\ntaste which we noticed was a large motto, worked in flowers,\r\nsuspended over the pillars of the balcony directly in front of\r\nthe stage. 'Welcome, Sweet Warbler' (so ran the words), was not\r\nonly tame and commonplace, but decidedly out of place.\r\n\r\n\"The sight of the grand hall, with its gay decoration, its\r\nglittering lamps, and its vast throng of expectant auditors, was\r\nin itself almost worth a $5 ticket. We were surprised to notice\r\nthat not more than one-eighth of the audience were ladies. They\r\nmust stay at home, it seems, when the tickets are high, but the\r\ngentlemen go, nevertheless. For its size, the audience was one of\r\nthe most quiet, refined and appreciative we ever saw assembled in\r\nthis city. Not more than one-third were seated before 7 o'clock,\r\nand when the eventful hour arrived they were still coming in. A\r\nfew of the seats were not taken when the orchestra had assembled,\r\nand Mr. Benedict, who was greeted with loud cheers on his\r\nappearance, gave the first flourish of his baton.\r\n\r\n\"The musical performance commenced with Jules Benedict's overture\r\nto his opera, The Crusaders, himself conducting the orchestra of\r\n60 instruments. It was an admirably balanced and effective\r\norchestra, and notwithstanding that we had to listen as it were\r\nround a corner, we felt the unity and full force of its strong\r\nchords, and traced the precise and delicate outline of its\r\nmelodies with a distinctness which proved that a clear musical\r\nidea was there, too clearly embodied to be lost even in that vast\r\nspace. We liked the first half of the composition best; it had\r\nthe dark shading and wild vigor and pathos of Von Weber; the\r\nallegro which set in upon it was more in the light popular manner\r\nof Auber and the French. Yet Mr. Benedict has proved his mastery\r\nin this work, which the vast audience acknowledged with very\r\nhearty plaudits.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Belletti was the next mark of expectation. In one of\r\nRossini's most ornate and florid bravura songs (from Maometto\r\nSecondo) he produced a barytone of such warm, rich, solid,\r\nresonant and feeling quality as we perhaps have never heard in\r\nthis country (though without closer observation from the less\r\nremote position in which a barytone naturally requires to be\r\nheard, we hardly dare to place it above Badiali's); while in\r\nrefinement of conception and of execution he left little to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\"Now came a moment of breathless expectation. A moment more, and\r\nJenny Lind, clad in a white dress, which well became the frank\r\nsincerity of her face, came forward through the orchestra. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the spontaneous burst of welcome which\r\ngreeted her. The vast assembly rose as one man, and for some\r\nminutes nothing could be seen but the waving of hands and\r\nhandkerchiefs, nothing heard but a storm of tumultuous cheers.\r\nThe enthusiasm of the moment, for a time beyond all bounds, was\r\nat last subdued after prolonging itself by its own fruitless\r\nefforts to subdue itself, and the divine songstress, with that\r\nperfect bearing, that air of all dignity and sweetness, blending\r\na child-like simplicity and half-trembling womanly modesty with\r\nthe beautiful confidence of genius and serene wisdom of art,\r\naddressed herself to song, as the orchestral symphony prepared\r\nthe way for the voice in Casta Diva. A better test-piece could\r\nnot have been selected for her debut. Every soprano lady has sung\r\nit to us; but nearly every one has seemed only trying to make\r\nsomething of it, while Jenny Lind WAS the very music of it for\r\nthe time being. We would say no less than that; for the wisest\r\nand honestest part of criticism on such a first hearing of a\r\nthing so perfect, was to give itself purely up to it, without\r\nquestion, and attempt no analysis of what too truly fills one to\r\nhave yet begun to be an object of thought.\r\n\r\n\"If it were possible, we would describe the quality of that\r\nvoice, so pure, so sweet, so fine, so whole and all-pervading, in\r\nits lowest breathings and minutest fioriture as well as in its\r\nstrongest volume. We never heard tones which in their sweetness\r\nwent so far. They brought the most distant and ill-seated auditor\r\nclose to her. They WERE tones, every one of them, and the whole\r\nair had to take the law of their vibrations. The voice and the\r\ndelivery had in them all the good qualities of all the good\r\nsingers. Song in her has that integral beauty which at once\r\nproclaims it as a type for all, and is most naturally worshipped\r\nas such by the multitude.\r\n\r\n\"Of those who have been before her we were most frequently\r\nreminded of Madame Bishop's quality (not quantity) of voice.\r\nTheir voices are of metal somewhat akin. Jenny Lind's had\r\nincomparably more power and more at all times in reserve; but it\r\nhad a shade of that same veiled quality in its lowest tones,\r\nconsistently with the same (but much more) ripeness and\r\nsweetness, and perfect freedom from the crudeness often called\r\nclearness, as they rise. There is the same kind of versatile and\r\nsubtile talent, too, in Jenny Lind, as appeared later in the\r\nequal inspiration and perfection of her various characters and\r\nstyles of song. Her's is a genuine soprano, reaching the extra\r\nhigh notes with that ease and certainty which make each highest\r\none a triumph of expression purely, and not a physical marvel.\r\nThe gradual growth and sostenuto of her tones; the light and\r\nshade, the rhythmic undulation and balance of her passages; the\r\nbird-like ecstacy of her trill; the faultless precision and\r\nfluency of her chromatic scales; above all, the sure reservation\r\nof such volume of voice as to crown each protracted climax with\r\nglory, not needing a new effort to raise force for the final\r\nblow; and indeed all the points one looks for in a mistress of\r\nthe vocal art were eminently her's in Casta Diva. But the charm\r\nlay not in any POINT, but rather in the inspired vitality, the\r\nhearty, genuine outpouring of the whole--the real and yet truly\r\nideal humanity of all her singing. That is what has won the world\r\nto Jenny Lind; it is that her whole soul and being goes out in\r\nher song, and that her voice becomes the impersonation of that\r\nsong's soul if it have any, that is, if it BE a song. There is\r\nplainly no vanity in her, no mere aim to effect; it is all frank\r\nand real and harmoniously earnest.\r\n\r\n\"She next bewitched all by the delicate naivete and sparkling\r\nespieglerie, interchanged with true love pathos, of her duet with\r\nBelletti, from Rossini's I Turchi in Italia, the music being in\r\nthe same voice with that of his 'Barber of Seville.' The distinct\r\nrapidity, without hurry, of many passages, was remarkable in both\r\nperformers. But perhaps the most wonderful exhibition of her\r\nvocal skill and pliancy and of her active intimacy with nature\r\nwas in the Trio Concertante, with two flutes, from Meyerbeer's\r\n'Camp of Silesia.' Exquisitely her voice played in echo between\r\nthe tasteful flute-warblings of Messrs. Kyle and Siede.\r\n\r\n\"But do not talk of her flute-like voice; the flute-tone is not\r\none a real voice need cultivate; except where it silvers the\r\nedges of a dark mass of orchestral harmony, the flute's\r\nunmitigated sweetness must and should contrast with the more\r\nclarionet and reed-like quality of a voice as rich and human as\r\nthat of Jenny Lind.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally the favorites of the evening were the two national\r\nsongs. Her Swedish 'Herdsman's Song' was singularly quaint, wild\r\nand innocent. The odd musical interval (a sharp seventh) of the\r\nthe echo, as if her singing had brought the very mountains there,\r\nwere extremely characteristic. This was loudly encored and\r\nrepeated; and when again encored was of course answered with her\r\n'Greeting to America,' the National Prize Song, written by Bayard\r\nTaylor, and set to a vigorous and familiar style of music, well\r\nharmonizing with the words, by Benedict. The greeting had a soul\r\nin it coming from those lips.\r\n\r\n\"We have but now to acknowledge the fine style of Belletti's\r\nLargo al Factotum (though the gay barber's song always requires\r\nthe stage) and the admirable orchestra performance of Weber's\r\nOverture to Oberon.\r\n\r\n\"We are now sure of Jenny Lind, the singer and the artist. Last\r\nnight she was herself, and well accompanied, and gloriously\r\nresponded to. But we have yet to hear her in the kind of music\r\nwhich seems to us most to need and to deserve such a singer--in\r\nthe Agatha of Der Freyschutz, and in Mozart and the deep music of\r\nthe great modern German operas.\r\n\r\n\"At the close the audience (who made no movement to leave till\r\nthe last note had been uttered) broke out in a tempest of cheers,\r\nonly less vehement than those which welcomed her in Casta Diva.\r\nShe came forward again, bowed with a bright, grateful face, and\r\nretired. The cheers were now mingled with shouts of 'Barnum!' who\r\nat last came forward, and with some difficulty obtained\r\nsufficient order to speak. 'My friends,' said he, 'you have often\r\nheard it asked, 'Where's Barnum?\" Amid the cheers and laughter\r\nwhich followed, we only caught the words: 'Henceforth, you may\r\nsay, 'Barnum's nowhere!' '\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum, after expressing his gratification at the splendid\r\nwelcome which had been given Mdlle. Lind, stated that he would\r\ndisclose a piece of news which he could no longer keep secret,\r\nand which would show how well that welcome was deserved. Mdlle.\r\nLind on Monday morning informed him that it was her intention to\r\ngive her share of the net proceeds of the present concert,\r\namounting to considerable more than $10,000, to the various\r\ncharities in the city.\r\n\r\n\"The announcement was a signal for another storm. We did not\r\ncount the number of cheers given, but we never witnessed such a\r\npitch of enthusiasm. Mr. Barnum then proceeded to read the list\r\nof her donations, interrupted at every name by a fresh burst of\r\napplause:\r\n\r\n To the Fire Department Fund . . . . . . . . . $3,000\r\n\r\n     Musical Fund Society. . . . . . . . . . . .2,000\r\n\r\n     Home for the Friendless . . . . . . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Society for the Relief of Indigent Females. .500\r\n\r\n     Dramatic Fund Association . . . . . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Home for Colored and Aged Persons . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Colored and Orphan Association. . . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Lying-in Asylum for Destitute Females . . . .500\r\n\r\n     New York Orphan Asylum. . . . . . . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Protestant Half-Orphan Asylum . . . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Roman Catholic Half-Orphan Asylum . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n     Old Ladies' Asylum. . . . . . . . . . . . . .500\r\n\r\n               Total . . . . . . . . . . . . .$10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In case the money coming to her shall exceed this sum, she will\r\nhereafter designate the charity to which it is to be\r\nappropriated. Mr. Barnum was then about retiring, when there was\r\na universal call for Jenny Lind. The songstress, however, had\r\nalready taken her departure, and the excited crowd, after giving\r\na few more cheers, followed her example, and slowly surged out of\r\nthe castle door, and down the canopied bridge, in a glow of\r\ngood-humor and admiration. A few disorderly vagrants collected on\r\nthe bridges leading to the Bath Houses, hooted at the throng as\r\nit passed out, but everybody went home quietly, with a new joy at\r\nhis heart, and a new thought in his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Jenny Lind's second concert was in every respect as complete a\r\ntriumph as the first. The audience numbered upward of SEVEN\r\nTHOUSAND, filling the vast amphitheatre to the topmost circles of\r\nthe gallery. The sight of that dense sea of heads, from either\r\nextremity of the balcony, reminded us of one of Martin's grand,\r\ngloomy pictures, and the resemblance was further increased by the\r\nsemi-oriental appearance of the hall, with its long, light\r\npillars dropping from the centre, as well as by the dimness of\r\nits illumination, the lamps, many and bright as they were, being\r\nlost in the immense area of the building.\r\n\r\n\"The concert was a repetition of the first, with the only\r\ndifference that the orchestra volunteered the \"Wedding March,\"\r\nfrom Mendelssohn's \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" whose short,\r\ncrackling blaze of harmony received full justice from the sure\r\nand well-tempered brass instruments. Weber's overture to \"Oberon\"\r\nwas finely rendered, and the composition is as fine a specimen of\r\nmusical fairy-land as could be found before young Mendelssohn\r\ndreamed Shakspere's dream over in his own way.\r\n\r\n\"In Jenny Lind we still feel that it is not easy to separate the\r\nsinger from the person. She sings herself. She does not, like\r\nmany skilful vocalists, merely recite her musical studies, and\r\ndazzle you with splendid feats unnaturally acquired; her singing,\r\nthrough all her versatile range of parts and styles, is her own\r\nproper and spontaneous activity--integral, and whole. Her\r\nmagnificent voice, always true and firm, and as far beyond any\r\ninstrument as humanity is beyond nature, seems like the audible\r\nbeauty of her nature and her character. That she is an artist in\r\nthe highest sense is a question long since settled, and any\r\nlittle incidental variation from the bold and perfect outline of\r\nsuccess in any special effort, as the faltering of her voice from\r\nnatural embarrassment in the commencing of Casta Diva that first\r\nnight, could not to a true listener at all impede the recognition\r\nof the wonderful art which could afford a little to humanity on\r\nso trying an occasion. For she was as it were beginning her\r\ncareer anew; literally to her was this a new world; and she felt\r\nfor a moment as if in her first blushing maidenhood of song. This\r\nsecond time the hesitation of the voice in that commencement was\r\nnot felt. The note began soft and timid and scarce audible, as\r\nthe prayer of Norma might have done; but how it gradually swelled\r\nwith the influx of divine strength into the soul! The grand\r\ndifficulty in the opening andante movement of Casta Diva lies in\r\nits broad, sustained phrasing, in the long, generous undulation\r\nof its rhythm, which with most singers drags or gets broken out\r\nof symmetry. Jenny Lind conceived and did it truly. The\r\nimpassioned energy of the loud-pleading syncopated cries in which\r\nthe passage attains its climax; the celestial purity and\r\npenetrating sweetness of that highest note afterward; the\r\nexquisite cadenza to the andante; and the inspiring eloquence of\r\nthe allegro: Ah! bello a me ritorna, were far beyond anything WE\r\nhave had the fortune hitherto to hear.\r\n\r\n\"They that sat, or even stood, in Castle Garden, may mark down a\r\nwhite day in their calendar. In point of audience, programme,\r\nexecution and inspiration, it was the greatest concert, so far.\r\nIf anything more had been needed to confirm the impression which\r\nJenny Lind had previously made on an American public, and to\r\nplace her continued success beyond the possibility of doubt, last\r\nnight's experience certainly supplied it.\r\n\r\n\"It was foreseen in the morning that the attendance would be\r\ngreater even than on Friday night. The American Museum and Hall's\r\nMusic Store were besieged through the whole day and up to the\r\nvery hour of commencement. At the former place the crowding for\r\ntickets was tremendous, the very sidewalk in front being\r\nblockaded most of the time. At seven o'clock, when we took up the\r\nline of march for Castle Garden, both sides of Broadway were\r\nthronged, and the main avenue of the Battery was filled with a\r\nsteady stream of persons pressing into the Castle gate. As on the\r\nfirst night, a double line of policemen had been formed, which\r\neffectually prevented all disorder. A few more lamps were\r\nintroduced into the hall, rendering its aspect much more light\r\nand cheerful. By eight o'clock the vast hall was crowded to\r\noverflowing. Scarcely a foot of space was unoccupied; from the\r\nvery edge of the ceiling to the orchestral platform in the\r\ncentre, around the immense span of the building, there was but\r\none dense mass of heads. We should, at a rough guess, estimate\r\nthe number in the auditory at SEVEN THOUSAND. A much larger\r\nproportion than on former nights were ladies, and for the first\r\ntime we caught glimpses of the fashionable society from above\r\nBleecker. It is worthy of note, that the first and second\r\nconcerts, immense as they were, were composed almost entirely of\r\nthe intelligent and appreciative middle class.\r\n\r\n\"Some disturbance was created by a rush to obtain seats, made by\r\nthose who had promenade tickets for the balcony, the moment the\r\norchestra began to collect. This proceeding, in violation of the\r\nspecified arrangements, was most disgraceful. The ushers did all\r\nthey could to prevent it, but in spite of all their efforts many\r\npersons who arrived before the hour of commencement were deprived\r\nof their seats. It would be a good plan to have a few policemen\r\nin the balcony on future occasions.\r\n\r\n\"The orchestra commenced with Rossini's Overture to \"William\r\nTell\"--perhaps the finest piece of instrumental picture music\r\nsince Haydn's Creation and the Pastoral Symphony of Beethoven.\r\nIts fresh and vivid coloring, its atmospheric changes, its smart\r\nAlpine vigor and heroic ensemble, were made as present and as\r\nreal as any sixty instruments could make them. Exquisitely did\r\nthose three violoncellos sketch the first scene of soft, cool\r\nsunset on the unruffled lake; the mellow Corno Anglaise, male\r\npartner to the oboe, sweetly woke the flute-like mountain echoes;\r\nthe low moan and whistle of the storm rose life like in the\r\ncrescendo of the violins, and as it died away the startling\r\nquick-step of liberty leaped strong and simultaneous from such a\r\ntutti as we have hardly heard from any orchestra. We can believe\r\nthat Mr. Benedict was quite sincere in telling them he had not\r\nconducted a better orchestra in Europe. The other Overture to\r\nMasaniello was also splendidly played, but the composition is, to\r\nour taste, too hackneyed to fill out the programme of a Jenny\r\nLind before the largest audience in the world. The accompaniments\r\nto the singing were usually given with sympathetic precision, and\r\nsubdued shading or vigorous seconding, as the case required. We\r\ncannot speak too well of M. Benedict's control of his forces.\r\n\r\n\"The second piece was the Viravviso (\"As I View Now\") from La\r\nSomnambula, delivered in the richest and most vibrating barytone\r\nthat WE Americans have heard, by Sig. Belletti. Now that we have\r\nheard him from a nearer position, we have not a doubt left of his\r\nsuperiority in voice, style, execution to all our Italian\r\nfavorites of the same register hitherto. He absolutely glorified\r\nthe cavatina which rapidly grew commonplace with Brough, and had\r\nbut half recovered even in the hands of the worthy Italian\r\nartists who have since sung it on the stage for us. His crowning\r\nachievement last night, however, was the actual singing of a\r\nTarentella by Rossini--a kind of movement which we have hitherto\r\nheard only from instruments--a whirling, spinning, delirious,\r\ntop-like movement in which the singer seems galvanized and\r\ntyrannized by one too happy and all-mastering idea in spite of\r\nhimself. The audience too, in spite of themselves, were sucked\r\ninto its whirling ecstacy, and it was imperatively encored. In\r\nMozart's Non piu Andrai the chaster prototype of Rossini's Largo\r\nal factotum, his vocalization was elastic, spirited and elegant,\r\nbut the effect of such a piece was necessarily lost upon the\r\nouter circles of so vast an auditory.\r\n\r\n\"For other variety there was a brilliant show duett on themes\r\nfrom La Somnambula for piano and violin by Messrs. Benedict and\r\nNoll, and a solo on the pianoforte by that most promising young\r\nartist, Hoffman. For this he chose De Meyer's fantasy on\r\nSemiramide, decidedly of the modern monster school of pianoforte\r\ncomposition, though quite a vigorous, graceful and redeeming\r\nspecimen thereof.\r\n\r\n\"And now for the 'Queen of Song'--or, if so qualifying it will\r\nbetter suit the Italians, the NORTHERN Queen of Song.\r\n\r\n\"She commenced with one of the most tender and graceful, and\r\nhereabouts least hackneyed airs of Bellini--the Qui la Voce from\r\nI Puritani. Her liquid purity of voice and graceful gliding\r\nthrough its flowery labyrinthine passages was to us not more\r\nremarkable than the true but quiet fervor which animated it.\r\nJenny Lind shows no feeling! and excites none! draws no tears!\r\nTrue Art supplies the place of tears by touching the emotions\r\nwhich are deeper and serener, and not a whit less human. But of\r\nthis more fully when we have room.\r\n\r\n\"The splendid song from Mozart's 'Magic Flute,' Non Paventar,\r\nbrought into play the salient diamonds of her highest voice,\r\nwhich arches like the tall shaft of a fountain sparkling in the\r\nsun. The introduction, a bold, exhorting strain, in grandiose\r\nstyle, full of large intervals, was given with a glorious fervor,\r\nand no lark ever carolled more blithely or more at ease than her\r\nvoice as it soared to F in alt! Benedict's English ballad, 'Take\r\nthis Lute,' she sang with a simplicity and pathos that won the\r\naudience completely; and no part seemed more genuine or more\r\nexpressive than the difficult cadenza at its close.\r\n\r\n\"The romanza from Robert le Diable was perhaps the most\r\nfascinating of her more studied performances. This, like all her\r\nbrilliant things, if not impassioned in the cheaper superficial\r\nsense, was at all events vital, and from the soul. She is never\r\nmechanical, whatever you may say about want of passion. Is any\r\ntragic pathos, such as is ready on the smallest occasion, or on\r\nnone, more admirable and more inspiring, more from the inmost\r\nsoul, than is that gushing up of a full, glad, true heart which\r\nis her native mood of song, and which was so glorious last night\r\nin the Ah! non Giunge from Somnambula? The rapturous encore to\r\nthis was answered by the Swedish 'Herdsman's Song.'\r\n\r\n\"It was in the song from Mozart's 'Magic Flute' that we first\r\nfully KNEW the voice and art and soul of Jenny Lind. She warmed\r\nto that music. It is narrow criticism which imprisons such a\r\nsinger within the partial scope, albeit classical, of the Italian\r\nSchool; ignores that vital part of her which may exceed the\r\nconventional requirements of such a School, and condemns whatever\r\nin her is most characteristic, and in contrast with its models.\r\nIt has been well said by those who make the most intelligent\r\nreference to those models and that school, that the style of the\r\nSwedish Nightingale is sui generis, as marked as her own\r\npersonality. True, you would not say of her, in the conventional\r\nItalian sense of the word, what is often said in first\r\nacknowledgment of a good singer: 'She has STYLE'--meaning the one\r\nstyle which is assumed as the standard. If we are to limit style\r\nto that sense, Mdlle. Lind has more than style; she has\r\ngenius--Northern genius, to be sure, which is precisely what she\r\nshould have to make her greatness genuine. Song is original in\r\nher; and from her singing we drink in new life, after long\r\nsatiety of such passion-sweets as have become habits rather than\r\nfresh inspirations in the delightful--we may almost say\r\nperfected--but yet confined music of the Italians.\r\n\r\n\"It is, perhaps, too late to await the advent of a Queen of Song\r\nfrom the warm South. The South has had its turn; it has fulfilled\r\nits mission; the other end of the balance now comes up. The\r\nNorthern Muse must sing her lesson to the world. Her fresher,\r\nchaster, more intellectual, and (as they only SEEM to some) her\r\ncolder strains come in due season to recover our souls from the\r\ndelicious languor of a Music which has been so wholly of the\r\nFeelings, that, for the want of some intellectual tonic and some\r\nspiritual temper, Feeling has degenerated into mere Sensibility\r\nand a very cheap kind of superficial, skin-deep excitability that\r\nusurps the name of Passion.\r\n\r\n\"We admire and feel and love the Melody of Italy. We reverence\r\nher native gift of song, her popular sensibility to it. We have\r\nbeen again and again transported by her best vocal artists who\r\nhave visited these shores, and they are not THE best--the\r\nworld-wide celebrities, we have to confess, are only traditions\r\nto us--traditions, however, to which we yield ourselves in full\r\nfaith. From what we HAVE heard and experienced of Italian\r\nsinging, we know, as well as if we had heard Grisi, Pasta and\r\nRubini, that it is not IN the genius of the Italian School to\r\nproduce or hardly to appreciate such a new revelation of song as\r\nthis human nightingale or canary of Sweden.\r\n\r\n\"Is this underrating the Italian music? By no means. That is an\r\nestablished fact, and has its characteristic worth. Equally so,\r\nbut in a contrasted way has the music of the North, which, till\r\nthis Nightingale appeared, had found its utterance mainly through\r\ninstruments and orchestras. Now it finds worthy utterance in\r\nsong. But of its peculiar characteristic we must take another\r\ntime to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. CONTINUED TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL ADVERTISING--THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF RICHES--VISIT TO\r\nIRANISTAN--OVATIONS AT BOSTON, PHILADELPHIA, BALTIMORE AND\r\nWASHINGTON--VISIT TO MT. VERNON--CHARLESTON--HAVANA--FREDERICKA\r\nBREMER.\r\n\r\nAll of Barnum's inventive powers were called into play\r\neffectually to advertise his song-bird. Biographies of Jenny Lind\r\nwere circulated. \"Foreign correspondence\" raved over her talents,\r\nnarratives of her benevolence filled the papers; her pictures and\r\nher name were seen everywhere. So when she made her first\r\nappearance, it was before an audience already wrought up to a\r\nhigh pitch of enthusiasm in her behalf. Never before, or after\r\nfor that matter, was any singer so lauded by the press. The\r\nfollowing editorial from the New York Herald of September 10th,\r\n1850, is a fair sample:\r\n\r\n\"What ancient monarch was he, either in history or in fable, who\r\noffered half his kingdom (the price of box-tickets and choice\r\nseats in those days) for the invention of an original sensation,\r\nor the discovery of a fresh pleasure? That sensation--that\r\npleasure which royal power in the Old World failed to\r\ndiscover--has been called into existence at a less price, by Mr.\r\nBarnum, a plain republican, and is now about to be enjoyed by the\r\nsovereigns of the New World.\r\n\r\n\"Jenny Lind, the most remarkable phenomenon in the musical art\r\nwhich has for the last century flashed across the horizon of the\r\nOld World, is now among us, and will make her debut to-morrow\r\nnight to a house of nearly ten thousand listeners, yielding in\r\nproceeds by auction, a sum of forty or fifty thousand dollars.\r\nFor the last ten days our musical reporters have furnished our\r\nreaders with every matter connected with her arrival in this\r\nmetropolis, and the steps adopted by Mr. Barnum in preparation\r\nfor her first appearance. The proceedings of yesterday,\r\nconsisting of the sale of the remainder of the tickets, and the\r\nastonishing, the wonderful sensation produced at her first\r\nrehearsal on the few persons, critics in musical art, who were\r\nadmitted on the occasion, will be found elsewhere in our columns.\r\n\r\n\"We concur in everything that has been said by our musical\r\nreporter, describing her extraordinary genius--her unrivalled\r\ncombination of power and art. Nothing has been exaggerated, not\r\nan iota. Three years ago, more or less, we heard Jenny Lind on\r\nmany occasions, when she made the first great sensation in\r\nEurope, by her debut at the London Opera House. Then she was\r\ngreat in power--in art--in genius; now she is greater in all. We\r\nspeak from experience and conviction. Then she astonished, and\r\npleased, and fascinated the thousands of the British aristocracy;\r\nnow she will fascinate, and please, and delight, and almost make\r\nmad with musical excitement, the millions of the American\r\ndemocracy. To-morrow night, this new sensation--this fresh\r\nmovement--this excitement excelling all former excitements--will\r\nbe called into existence, when she pours out the notes of Casta\r\nDiva, and exhibits her astonishing powers--her wonderful\r\npeculiarities, that seem more of heaven than of earth--more of a\r\nvoice from eternity, than from the lips of a human being.\r\n\r\n\"We speak soberly--seriously--calmly. The public expectation has\r\nrun very high for the last week--higher than at any former period\r\nof our past musical annals. But high as it has risen, the\r\nreality--the fact--the concert--the voice of Jenny Lind--will far\r\nsurpass all past expectations. Jenny Lind is a wonder, and a\r\nprodigy in song--and no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum had not hoped to manage such an enormous enterprise as\r\nthis one, without some trouble and anxiety, but he soon\r\ndiscovered that in this case, realization far exceeded\r\nanticipation. He often declared that from the first concert,\r\nSeptember 11th, 1850, until the ninety-third concert, June 9th,\r\n1851, he did not experience a single waking moment that was free\r\nfrom care.\r\n\r\nMiss Lind was utterly unprepared for the enthusiasm of her\r\nAmerican audience, and it is scarcely to be wondered at that she\r\nshould appear to listen at first to the dishonorable counsels of\r\nsome of her friends, who constantly besought her to break her\r\ncontract with Barnum, who, they urged, was \"coining money out of\r\nher genius,\" and to take the enterprise into her own hands. But\r\nwhether Miss Lind realized that Mr. Barnum's management was\r\nlargely responsible for her triumph, or whether she was simply\r\ntoo high-minded to consider such a breach of honor, certain it is\r\nthat she continued to stand by her contract. John Jay, her\r\nlawyer, took every occasion to interfere, and Barnum suffered\r\nmuch from his unreasonable intrusions. The following letter,\r\nwritten to Mr. Joshua Bates of Baring Bros. & Co., London, will\r\nshow the difficulties which beset the perplexed manager:\r\n\r\n                                   \"NEW YORK, October 23, 1850.\r\n\r\n\"JOSHUA BATES, Esq.:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir: I take the liberty to write you a few lines, merely to\r\nsay that we are getting along as well as could reasonably be\r\nexpected. In this country you are aware that the rapid\r\naccumulation of wealth always creates much envy, and envy soon\r\naugments to malice. Such are the elements at work to a limited\r\ndegree against myself, and although Miss Lind, Benedict and\r\nmyself have never, as yet, had the slightest feelings between us,\r\nto my knowledge, except those of friendship, yet I cannot well\r\nsee how this can long continue in the face of the fact that,\r\nnearly every day they allow persons (some moving in the first\r\nclasses of society) to approach them, and spend hours in\r\ntraducing me; even her attorney, Mr. John Jay, has been so blind\r\nto her interests, as to aid in poisoning her mind against me, by\r\npouring into her ears the most silly twaddle, all of which\r\namounts to nothing and less than nothing--such as the regret that\r\nI was a showman, exhibiter of Tom Thumb, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\"Without the elements which I possess for business, as well as my\r\nknowledge of human nature, acquired in catering for the public,\r\nthe result of her concerts here would not have been pecuniarily\r\none-half as much as the present--and such men as the Hon. Edward\r\nEverett, G. G. Howland, and others, will tell you that there is\r\nno charlatanism or lack of dignity in my management of these\r\nconcerts. I know as well as any person, that the merits of Jenny\r\nLind are the best capital to depend upon to secure public favor,\r\nand I have thus far acted on this knowledge. Everything which\r\nmoney and attention can procure for their comfort, they have, and\r\nI am glad to know that they are satisfied on this score. All I\r\nfear is, that these continued backbitings, if listened to by her,\r\nwill, by and by, produce a feeling of distrust or regret, which\r\nwill lead to unpleasant results.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, her mind ought to be as free as air, and she\r\nherself as free as a bird, and being satisfied of my probity and\r\nability, she should turn a deaf ear to all envious and malevolent\r\nattacks on me. I have hoped that by thus briefly stating to you\r\nthe facts in the case, you might be induced for her interests as\r\nwell as mine to drop a line of advice to Mr. Benedict and another\r\nto Mr. Jay on this subject. If I am asking or expecting too much,\r\nI pray you to not give it a thought, for I feel myself fully able\r\nto carry through my rights alone, although I should deplore\r\nnothing so much as to be obliged to do so in a feeling of\r\nunfriendliness. I have risked much money on the issue of this\r\nspeculation--it has proved successful. I am full of perplexity\r\nand anxiety, and labor continually for success, and I cannot\r\nallow ignorance or envy to rob me of the fruits of my enterprise.\r\n                        \"Sincerely and gratefully yours,\r\n                                              \"P. T. BARNUM.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lind's benevolence had been so largely extolled that it was\r\nnot surprising that she should have been continually beset by\r\napplicants for charity.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases she gave liberally in sums varying from $20\r\nto $1,000, and to one Swedish friend, it is said, she actually\r\ngave $5,000.\r\n\r\nOn her return from Boston to New York the whole party stopped at\r\nIranistan, Mr. Barnum's Bridgeport place. The next morning Miss\r\nLind was escorted over the grounds, the beauty of which delighted\r\nher. \"Do you know, Mr. Barnum,\" she said, \"that if you had not\r\nbuilt Iranistan, I should never have come to America for you?\"\r\nMr. Barnum, much surprised, asked her to explain.\r\n\r\n\"I had received several applications to visit the United States,\"\r\nshe continued, \"but I did not much like the appearance of the\r\napplicants, nor did I relish the idea of crossing 3,000 miles of\r\nocean; so I declined them all. But the first letter which Mr.\r\nWilton, your agent, addressed me, was written upon a sheet headed\r\nwith a beautiful engraving of Iranistan. It attracted my\r\nattention. I said to myself, a gentleman who has been so\r\nsuccessful in his business as to be able to build and reside in\r\nsuch a palace cannot be a mere 'adventurer.' So I wrote to your\r\nagent, and consented to an interview, which I should have\r\ndeclined, if I had not seen the picture of Iranistan.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, then, fully pays me for building it,\" replied Barnum.\r\n\r\nThe night after Miss Lind's arrival in Boston, there was a\r\ndisplay of fireworks, in her honor, in front of the Revere House,\r\nwhich was followed by a torchlight procession by the Germans of\r\nthe city. At Philadelphia, they were met by such a dense throng\r\nof people that it was with the greatest difficulty that they\r\npressed through the crowds to their hotel. Jenny was suffering\r\nfrom a very severe headache and retired at once to her rooms.\r\nOutside, the streets were packed with the thousands that had\r\nfollowed them to the door, and were now clamoring for Jenny Lind.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the noise would seriously disturb the sensitive\r\nsongstress, Barnum tried to induce the crowd to disperse; but\r\nthey declared they would not until Miss Lind appeared on the\r\nbalcony. In despair he finally put Jenny's bonnet and shawl on\r\nher companion, Miss Ahmansen, who went out on the balcony and\r\nbowed gracefully to the multitude, who gave three hearty cheers\r\nand dispersed.\r\n\r\nMiss Lind hated crowds, and always wished her arrival in any city\r\nkept secret, so as to avoid the excitement of a public reception,\r\nbut Barnum knew that the success of the enterprise depended in a\r\nlarge measure on this very excitement.\r\n\r\nOne day Miss Lind remarked to Mr. Barnum, \"I have just heard that\r\nyou and I are to be married. Now how do you suppose such a report\r\never originated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably from the fact that we are 'engaged,' suggested Barnum,\r\nthe inveterate punster.\r\n\r\nMiss Lind always went to church when she could do so without\r\nattracting too much attention, always inquiring for the Swedish\r\nchurch wherever it could be found.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday in Baltimore, Miss Caroline Barnum, now Mrs. David W.\r\nThompson, of New York, went with a friend of hers who resided in\r\nthe city, into the choir, where she joined in the singing.\r\n\r\nA number of people in the audience had seen her with her father\r\nthe day previous and supposed her to be Jenny Lind. Like\r\nlightning the news that Jenny Lind was in the choir, flew through\r\nthe church, and when Miss Barnum, whose voice was not at all\r\nextraordinary, rose with the rest to sing, the congregation\r\nlistened breathlessly. \"Heavenly!\" \"Exquisite!\" \"Angelic!\" sighed\r\nthe excited audience. The two young ladies, all unconscious of\r\nthe furore they had inspired were utterly astonished when, after\r\nchurch, the crowd pressed round them so closely that they had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in reaching their carriage.\r\n\r\nThe day after their appearance in Washington, President Fillmore\r\ncalled, and left his card, Miss Lind being out. Jenny was very\r\nmuch flurried when she returned, and was prepared to call at the\r\nWhite House immediately, as would have been proper had Mr.\r\nFillmore been the head of any European country. Barnum assured\r\nher, however, that etiquette was not so strict in America, and\r\nshe postponed her visit until the next day, when with Benedict,\r\nBelletti and Mr. Barnum she spent several delightful hours in the\r\nPresident's family.\r\n\r\nThe President, the Cabinet and nearly every member of Congress\r\nattended both concerts. The great Statesman Webster was so\r\npleased with one of her songs that he drew himself up to his full\r\nheight and bowed profoundly, to Miss Lind's great gratification.\r\nOf all the distinguished men who called upon her in Washington,\r\nnone impressed her like Webster. She walked up and down in great\r\nexcitement after he had gone, exclaiming: \"Ah! Mr. Barnum, what a\r\nman! I have never before seen such a man!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lind was escorted through both Houses of Congress and\r\nthrough the Capitol and grounds, by Hon. C. F. Cleveland,\r\nRepresentative from Connecticut. She was very much pleased with\r\neverything and asked innumerable questions about the American\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay in Washington, they were invited by Colonel\r\nWashington, then owner of Mt. Vernon, to visit the home and the\r\ntomb of the first President.\r\n\r\nThe party first visited the tomb and then proceeded to the house\r\nwhere they were introduced to Mrs. Washington and several other\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nMuch interest was shown by Miss Lind in examining the various\r\nmementos of the great man, and when before leaving, Mrs.\r\nWashington presented her with a book from the library with\r\nWashington's autograph on the title page, she was overwhelmed\r\nwith emotion.\r\n\r\nMiss Lind had been through so much excitement in the North that\r\nshe determined to see no callers during her stay in the South.\r\nOne young lady, the daughter of a wealthy planter, was so\r\ndetermined to see her, that she bribed a maid to lend her her cap\r\nand apron, and let her carry in Miss Lind's tea. This incident\r\namused Barnum immensely, but Miss Lind was much vexed, declaring\r\nthe young lady's motive to be curiosity rather than admiration.\r\nThe voyage from Wilmington to Charleston had been very rough, the\r\ntrip requiring over thirty-six hours. When they arrived at last,\r\nthe vessel had been given up for lost and the wreck had been\r\ntelegraphed all over the country. The voyage to Havana was very\r\nmuch pleasanter, however.\r\n\r\nArriving there, they found the house which Mr. Barnum had sent a\r\nman on to provide for them, anything but comfortable. Miss Lind,\r\nespecially, was much displeased, and, hiring a carriage, she\r\ndrove off, accompanied by an interpreter. She was gone four\r\nhours, to the great alarm of the rest of the party. Returning,\r\nshe announced that she had hired a charming house in the suburbs,\r\nand invited the whole company to be her guests during their stay\r\nin Havana. It is needless to say they accepted her invitation.\r\n\r\nThere, freed from all care and annoyance and away from the too\r\nzealous counsellors, she spent a delightful month, seeing no\r\ncallers, coming and going as she pleased, and romping like a\r\nschoolgirl in the great court-yard back of the house. She used to\r\nforce Mr. Barnum to play ball with her until he was exhausted and\r\nfain to beg off. Then she would laugh and say: \"Oh, Mr. Barnum!\r\nyou are too fat and lazy; you cannot stand it to play ball with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Swedish authoress, Fredericka Bremer, spent a few\r\ndays with them in their Havana retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. HAVANA.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF THE HABANEROS--THE ITALIAN AND HIS DOG--MAD\r\nBENNETT--A SUCCESSFUL RUSE--RETURN TO NEW ORLEANS--A LUDICROUS\r\nINCIDENT--UP THE MISSISSIPPI--LEGERDEMAIN.\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving at Havana, Barnum made a discovery. The\r\nHabaneros, not accustomed to the high prices which opera tickets\r\ncommand in the States, had determined that they would force\r\nBarnum to lower the admission fee. This the manager refused to\r\ndo, and it soon became evident that although they attended the\r\nconcerts, they were not disposed to show the singer the least\r\nfavor. It was, therefore, with much inward trepidation that\r\nBarnum watched the curtain rise on the first concert. The\r\nfollowing account of that concert is taken from the New York\r\nTribune:\r\n\r\n\"Jenny Lind soon appeared, led on by Signor Belletti. Some three\r\nor four hundred persons clapped their hands at her appearance,\r\nbut this token of approbation was instantly silenced by at least\r\ntwo thousand five hundred decided hisses. Thus having settled the\r\nmatter that there should be no forestalling of public opinion,\r\nand that it applause was given to Jenny Lind in that house it\r\nshould first be incontestably earned, the most solemn silence\r\nprevailed. I have heard the Swedish Nightingale often in Europe\r\nas well as in America, and have ever noticed a distinct\r\ntremulousness attending her first appearance in any city. Indeed\r\nthis feeling was plainly manifested in her countenance as she\r\nneared the foot-lights; but when she witnessed the kind of\r\nreception in store for her--so different from anything she had\r\nreason to expect--her countenance changed in an instant to a\r\nhaughty self-possession, her eyes flashed defiance, and, becoming\r\nimmovable as a statue, she stood there perfectly calm and\r\nbeautiful. She was satisfied that she now had an ordeal to pass\r\nand a victory to gain worthy of her powers. In a moment her eye\r\nscanned the immense audience, the music began and then\r\nfollowed--how can I describe it?--such heavenly strains as I\r\nverily believe mortal never breathed except Jenny Lind, and\r\nmortal never heard except from her lips. Some of the oldest\r\nCastilians kept a frown upon their brow and a curling sneer upon\r\ntheir lips; their ladies, however, and most of the audience began\r\nto look surprised. The gushing melody flowed on, increasing in\r\nbeauty and glory. The caballeros, the senoras and senoritas began\r\nto look at each other; nearly all, however, kept their teeth\r\nclenched and their lips closed, evidently determined to resist to\r\nthe last. The torrent flowed deeper and faster, the lark flew\r\nhigher and higher, the melody grew richer and grander; still\r\nevery lip was compressed. By and by, as the rich notes came\r\ndashing in rivers upon our enraptured ears, one poor critic\r\ninvoluntarily whispered a 'brava.' This outbursting of the soul\r\nwas instantly hissed down. The stream of harmony rolled on till,\r\nat the close, it made a clean sweep of every obstacle, and\r\ncarried all before it. Not a vestige of opposition remained, but\r\nsuch a tremendous shout of applause as went up I never before\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\"The triumph was most complete. And how was Jenny Lind affected?\r\nShe who stood a few moments previous like adamant, now trembled\r\nlike a reed in the wind before the storm of enthusiasm which her\r\nown simple notes had produced. Tremblingly, slowly, and almost\r\nbowing her face to the ground, she withdrew. The roar and\r\napplause of victory increased. 'Encore! encore! encore!' came\r\nfrom every lip. She again appeared, and courtesying low, again\r\nwithdrew; but again, again and again did they call her out and at\r\nevery appearance the thunders of applause rang louder and louder.\r\nThus five times was Jenny Lind called out to receive their\r\nunanimous and deafening plaudits.\"\r\n\r\nWith tears of joy rolling down his cheeks, Barnum rushed behind\r\nthe scenes, and met her as she was withdrawing after the fifth\r\nencore.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, Jenny,\" he cried, \"you've settled them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you satisfied?\" said the singer, throwing her arms around\r\nhis neck and weeping for joy. This was the first she had known of\r\nthe opposition, all hint of it having been kept from her by Mr.\r\nBarnum, but she fully sympathized with him in his determination\r\nnot to lower the prices.\r\n\r\nThe papers continued to cry out for a reduction, and this caused\r\nmany people to stay away from the concerts, expecting Barnum to\r\nyield. But when, after three concerts, it was announced that the\r\nnext one, devoted to charity, was also to be Miss Lind's\r\nfarewell, they became very much excited. Committees waited on\r\nthem to request more concerts, which resulted only in refusals:\r\nsome of the leading Dons offered to guarantee them $25,000, for\r\nthree concerts, but Barnum assured them that there was not money\r\nenough in the Island of Cuba to induce him to consent.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of the fourth concert were distributed between two\r\nhospitals and a convent, besides giving $500 to Barnum's old\r\nprotege Vivalla, the little Italian plate-dancer, whom they had\r\nmet in Havana. The poor fellow's fortunes were at a very low ebb,\r\nhaving lost the use of his left side from paralysis. He supported\r\nhimself by exhibiting a performing dog, which turned a spinning\r\nwheel and did several other tricks. Miss Lind had heard of his\r\ncase and was very anxious that part of the benefit money should\r\nbe given him.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the concert the bell rang and Barnum found, on\r\ngoing to the door, a procession of children from the convent\r\nwhich had received a large sum of money from Miss Lind. The\r\nchildren were attended by ten or twelve priests in rich\r\nvestments. They had come to see the songstress and to thank her\r\nin person. But Jenny shrank from appearing before such a stately\r\ndeputation: \"Tell them I cannot see them,\" she exclaimed. \"They\r\nhave nothing to thank me for. If I have done good it was no more\r\nthan my duty.\" And the grand procession with its wreaths and\r\nbanners, were obliged to depart.\r\n\r\nThe same day, Vivalla called and brought her a basket of fruit.\r\nWith tears of joy, he called down every blessing on the head of\r\nthe benevolent lady. \"I shall go back to Italy! I shall see my\r\nbrothers and sisters again!\" he cried. Miss Lind had gone for a\r\ndrive, but Barnum promised to give her the fruit and the message.\r\nAs he was passing out the door he hesitated end said: \"Mr.\r\nBarnum, I should like so much to have the good lady see my dog\r\nturn a wheel. It is very nice; he can spin very good; shall I\r\nbring the dog and the wheel for her? She is such a good lady, I\r\nwish to please her very much.\" Mr. Barnum told the grateful\r\nfellow that Miss Lind had refused to see the priests from the\r\nconvent that morning, because she never received thanks for\r\nfavors, and that he was quite welcome to the money.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Lind returned and heard the story, she exclaimed: \"Poor\r\nman, poor man, do let him come; its all the good creature can do\r\nfor me;\" then with tears rolling down her face--\"I like that, I\r\nlike that; do let him come and bring his dog. It will make him so\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, it WILL make him happy,\" said Barnum. \"He shall\r\ncome to-morrow.\" And he went himself to tell Vivalla that Jenny\r\nLind would see his dog perform, the next day at four precisely.\r\n\r\n\"I will be punctual,\" said Vivalla, quite overcome with emotion,\r\n\"but I was SURE she would like to see my dog perform.\"\r\n\r\nFor full half an hour before the time appointed did Jenny Lind\r\nsit in her window on the second floor and watch for Vivalla and\r\nhis dog. A few minutes before the appointed hour, she saw him\r\ncoming. \"Ah, here he comes! here he comes!\" she exclaimed in\r\ndelight, as she ran down stairs and opened the door to admit him.\r\nA negro boy was bringing the small spinning-wheel, while Vivalla\r\nled the dog. Handing the boy a silver coin, she motioned him\r\naway, and taking the wheel in her arms, she said, \"This is very\r\nkind of you to come with your dog. Follow me. I will carry the\r\nwheel up stairs.\" Her servant offered to take the wheel, but no,\r\nshe would let no one carry it but herself. She called the whole\r\nparty to her parlor, and for one full hour did she devote herself\r\nto the happy Italian. She went down on her knees to pet the dog\r\nand to ask Vivalla all sorts of questions about his performances,\r\nhis former course of life, his friends in Italy, and his present\r\nhopes and determinations. Then she sang and played for him, gave\r\nhim some refreshments, finally insisted on carrying his wheel to\r\nthe door, and her servant accompanied Vivalla to his\r\nboarding-house.\r\n\r\nPoor Vivalla! He was probably never so happy before, but his\r\nenjoyment did not exceed that of Miss Lind. A few months later,\r\nhowever, the Havana correspondent of the New York Herald\r\nannounced the death of Vivalla, and stated that the poor\r\nItalian's last words were about Jenny Lind and Mr. Barnum.\r\n\r\nIn the party which accompanied Barnum to Havana was a man who had\r\nformerly kept the Peale Museum in New York, afterwards managing\r\nthe establishment for Mr. Barnum. At present he was acting as\r\nticket-taker.\r\n\r\nHe was a curious fellow, at times full of fun and gayety and at\r\nother times melancholy to the verge of insanity. Madness ran in\r\nhis family, and one of his brothers, in a moment of frenzy had\r\nblown his brains out. Barnum knew of Bennett's tendency to\r\nmelancholy and watched him constantly. When they were on board\r\nthe steamer \"Falcon\" on their way back to New Orleans, a\r\nthrilling incident occurred which Barnum afterwards related in\r\nthis way:\r\n\r\nMr. James Gordon Bennett, editor of the New York Herald, and his\r\nwife, were also passengers. After permitting one favorable notice\r\nin his paper, Bennett had turned around, as usual, and had abused\r\nJenny Lind and bitterly attacked me. I was always glad to get\r\nsuch notices, for they served as inexpensive advertisements to my\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\n\"Ticket-taker Bennett, however, took much to heart the attacks of\r\nEditor Bennett upon Jenny Lind. When Editor Bennett came on board\r\nthe 'Falcon,' his violent name-sake said to a by-stander:\r\n\r\n\" 'I would willingly be drowned if I could see that old scoundrel\r\ngo to the bottom of the sea.'\r\n\r\n\"Several of our party overheard the remark and I turned\r\nlaughingly to Bennett and said: Nonsense; he can't harm any one,\r\nand there is an old proverb about the impossibility of drowning\r\nthose who are born for another fate.'\r\n\r\n\"That very night, however, as I stood near the cabin door,\r\nconversing with my treasurer and other members of my company,\r\nHenry Bennett came up to me with a wild air, and hoarsely\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\" 'Old Bennett has gone forward alone in the dark--and I am going\r\nto throw him overboard!'\r\n\r\n\"We were all startled, for we knew the man, and he seemed\r\nterribly in earnest. Knowing how most effectively to address him\r\nat such times, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\" 'Ridiculous! you would not do such a thing.'\r\n\r\n\" 'I swear I will,' was his savage reply. I expostulated with\r\nhim, and several of our party joined me.\r\n\r\n\" 'Nobody will know it,' muttered the maniac, 'and I shall be\r\ndoing the world a favor.'\r\n\r\n\"I endeavored to awaken him to a sense of the crime he\r\ncontemplated, assuring him that it could not possibly benefit any\r\none, and that from the fact of the relations existing between the\r\neditor and myself, I should be the first to be accused of his\r\nmurder. I implored him to go to his stateroom, and he finally did\r\nso, accompanied by some of the gentlemen of our party. I took\r\npains to see that he was carefully watched that night, and,\r\nindeed, for several days, till he became calm again. He was a\r\nlarge, athletic man, quite able to pick up his name-sake and drop\r\nhim overboard. The matter was too serious for a joke, and we made\r\nlittle mention of it; but more than one of our party said then,\r\nand has said since, what I really believe to be true, that 'James\r\nGordon Bennett would have been drowned that night had it not been\r\nfor P. T. Barnum.' \"\r\n\r\nBennett's end was tragic, as might be expected. Sometime after\r\nthe Havana journey Barnum sent him to London. He conducted the\r\nbusiness successfully, wrote up the accounts to a penny, then\r\nhanding the papers to a mutual friend with directions to give\r\nthem to Barnum when he should arrive, he went to his lodgings and\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\n\"In New Orleans the wharf was crowded by a great concourse of\r\npersons, as the steamer \"Falcon\" approached. Jenny Lind had\r\nenjoyed a month of quiet, and dreaded the excitement which she\r\nmust now again encounter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Barnum, I am sure I can never get through that crowd,\" she\r\nsaid in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Leave that to me. Remain quiet for ten minutes, and there shall\r\nbe no crowd here,\" replied Barnum.\r\n\r\nTaking his daughter on his arm, she drew her vail over her face\r\nand they descended the gangway.\r\n\r\n\"That's Barnum, I know him,\" called out several persons at the\r\ntop of their voices.\r\n\r\n\"Open the way, if you please for Mr. Barnum and Miss Lind!\" cried\r\nLe Grand Smith over the railing of the ship, the deck of which he\r\nhad just reached from the wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Don't crowd her, if you please, gentlemen,\" said Barnum, and so\r\npushing and squeezing they reached the carriage and drove to Miss\r\nLind's apartments. A few minutes later Jenny and her companion\r\ncame quietly in a carriage and were in the house before the ruse\r\nwas discovered. In answer to the calls of the crowd she appeared\r\non the balcony, and bowed to the throng, which gave her three\r\ncheers and dispersed.\r\n\r\nA very funny incident occurred in New Orleans. Next to the\r\ntheatre where the concerts were given, was an exhibition in the\r\nlarge open lots of mammoth hogs, grizzly bears and other animals.\r\n\r\nA gentleman had a son about twelve years old, who had a wonderful\r\near for music. He could whistle or sing any tune after hearing it\r\nonce. His father did not know nor care for a single note, but so\r\nanxious was he to please his son, that he paid thirty dollars for\r\ntwo tickets to the concert.\r\n\r\n\"I liked the music better than I expected,\" said he the next day,\r\n\"but my son was in raptures. He was so perfectly enchanted that\r\nhe scarcely spoke the whole evening, and I would on no account\r\ndisturb his delightful reveries. When the concert was finished we\r\ncame out of the theatre. Not a word was spoken. I knew that my\r\nmusical prodigy was happy among the clouds, and I said nothing. I\r\ncould not help envying him his love of music, and considered my\r\nthirty dollars as nothing, compared to the bliss which it secured\r\nto him. Indeed, I was seriously thinking of taking him to the\r\nnext concert, when he spoke. We were just passing the numerous\r\nshows upon the vacant lots. One of the signs attracted him, and\r\nhe said, 'Father, let us go in and see the big hog!' The little\r\nscamp! I could have horse-whipped him!' said the father, who\r\nloving a joke, could not help laughing at the ludicrous incident.\r\n\r\nThe party took passage to Cairo, Illinois, in the beautiful river\r\nsteamer \"Magnolia.\" They had made arrangements with the captain\r\nto delay in Natchez and in Memphis where concerts were given.\r\n\r\nThe time on board the steamer was pleasantly spent in reading and\r\nwatching the scenery. One day they had a musicale in the ladies'\r\ncabin for the gratification of the passengers, at which Miss Lind\r\nvolunteered to sing. Barnum amused the passengers with his\r\ninexhaustible fund of anecdotes and stories, and the tricks of\r\nlegerdemain, which he had learned and used in the South under\r\nrather different circumstances. Among other tricks, he made a\r\nsilver piece disappear so mysteriously that the negro barber who\r\nwitnessed the feat, came to the conclusion that the great man\r\nmust be in league with the devil. \"The next morning,\" says Mr.\r\nBarnum, \"I seated myself in the barber's chair and the darkey\r\nbegan to talk:\r\n\r\n\" 'Beg pardon, Mr. Barnum, but I have heard a great deal about\r\nyou, and I saw more than I wanted to see last night. Is it true\r\nthat you have sold yourself to the devil, so that you can do what\r\nyou've a mind to?'\r\n\r\n\" 'Oh, yes,\" was my reply, 'that is the bargain between us.'\r\n\r\n\" 'How long did you agree for?' was the question next in order.\r\n\r\n\" 'Only nine years,' said I. 'I have had three of them already.\r\nBefore the other six are out, I shall find a way to nonplus the\r\nold gentleman, and I have told him so to his face.'\r\n\r\n\"At this avowal, a larger space of white than usual was seen in\r\nthe darkey's eyes, and he inquired, 'Is it by this bargain that\r\nyou get so much money?'\r\n\r\n\" 'Certainly. No matter who has money, nor where he keeps it, in\r\nhis box or till, or anywhere about him, I have only to speak the\r\nwords and it comes.'\r\n\r\n\"The shaving was completed in silence, but thought had been busy\r\nin the barber's mind, and he embraced the speediest opportunity\r\nto transfer his bag of coin to the iron safe in charge of the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\nThe movement did not escape me, and immediately a joke was afoot.\r\nI had barely time to make two or three details of arrangement\r\nwith the clerk, and resume my seat in the cabin, ere the barber\r\nsought a second interview, bent on testing the alleged powers of\r\nBeelzebub's colleague.\r\n\r\n\" 'Beg pardon, Mr. Barnum, but where is my money? Can you get\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n\" 'I do not want your money,' was the quiet answer. 'It is safe.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Yes, I know it is safe--ha! ha!--it is in the iron safe in the\r\nclerk's office--safe enough from you?'\r\n\r\n\" 'It is not in the iron safe!' said I. This was said so quietly,\r\nyet positively, that the colored gentleman ran to the office, and\r\ninquired if all was safe. 'All right,' said the clerk. 'Open, and\r\nlet me see,' replied the barber. The safe was unlocked and lo!\r\nthe money was gone!\r\n\r\n\"In mystified terror the loser applied to me for relief. 'You\r\nwill find the bag in your drawer,' said I, and there it was\r\nfound!\r\n\r\n\"His curiosity was still great. 'Please do another trick,' said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\" 'Very well,' I replied, 'stand perfectly still.'\r\n\r\n\"He did so, and I commenced muttering some mysterious words, as\r\nif performing an incantation.\r\n\r\n\" 'What are you doing?' said the barber.\r\n\r\n\" 'I am changing you into a black cat,' I replied, 'but don't be\r\nafraid; I will change you back again, if I don't forget the words\r\nto do it with.'\r\n\r\n\"This was too much for the terrified darkey; with an awful\r\nscreech he rushed to the side of the boat resolved to drown\r\nrather than undergo such a transformation.\r\n\r\n\"He was captured and brought back to me, when I dispelled his\r\nfright by explaining the way in which I had tricked him. Relieved\r\nand reassured, he clapped his hands and executed an impromtu jig,\r\nexclaiming, 'Ha! ha! when I get back to New Orleans won't I come\r\nde Barnum ober dem niggers!' \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. THE TRIALS OF AN IMPRESSARIO.\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS--THE SECRETARY'S LITTLE GAME--LEGAL ADVICE--SMOOTH\r\nWATERS AGAIN--BARNUM'S EFFORTS APPRECIATED--AN EXTRAVAGANT\r\nENCONIUM.\r\n\r\nThe concerts at Natchez and Memphis were extremely successful.\r\nThe sixty-first concert was given in St. Louis, and on the\r\nmorning of their arrival in the city Miss Lind's secretary came\r\nto Mr. Barnum, commissioned, as he claimed, by the singer, and\r\ntold the Manager that as sixty concerts had already been given,\r\nMiss Lind proposed to avail herself of one of the conditions of\r\nthe contract and cancel the engagement next morning. Much\r\nstartled by this sudden complication, but outwardly undisturbed,\r\nBarnum asked if Miss Lind had authorized the notice. \"I so\r\nunderstand it,\" was the secretary's reply. Thinking that it might\r\nbe another scheme of her advisers and that Miss Lind herself\r\nmight possibly know nothing of it, Barnum told the secretary that\r\nhe would see him again in an hour. He then proceeded to his old\r\nfriend Sol Smith for legal advice. They went over the contract\r\ntogether, Barnum telling his friend of the annoyances he had\r\nsuffered from Miss Lind's advisers, and they both agreed that if\r\nshe broke the contract thus suddenly, she was bound to pay back\r\nall that she had received over the stipulated $1000, for each\r\nconcert. As she had been paid $137,000, for sixty concerts, this\r\nextra money amounted to something like $77,000.\r\n\r\nBarnum then went back to the secretary and told him that he was\r\nready to settle with Miss Lind and to close the engagement.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he, evidently much surprised, \"you have already\r\nadvertised concerts in Louisville and Cincinnati, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Barnum calmly, \"but you may take the contracts\r\nfor halls and printing off my hands at cost.\" He further offered\r\nthe assistance of his agent and his own personal services to give\r\nMiss Lind a good start on her own account.\r\n\r\nThe secretary emboldened by this liberality then made a\r\nproposition so extraordinary that Barnum at once saw that Miss\r\nLind could have had nothing to do with the scheme.\r\n\r\n\"Now suppose,\" he asked, \"Miss Lind should wish to give some\r\nfifty concerts in this country, what would you charge as\r\nmanager?\"\r\n\r\n\"A million dollars a concert,\" answered Barnum promptly; then he\r\nadded, \"Now see here; I don't believe Miss Lind has authorized\r\nyou to make this proposition. If she has, just bring me a line to\r\nthat effect, over her own signature, and her check for the amount\r\ndue me by the terms of our contract, some $77,000, and we will\r\nclose our business connection at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why not make a new arrangement,\" persisted the secretary,\r\n\"for fifty more concerts, by which Miss Lind will pay you\r\nliberally, say $1,000 a concert?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the simple reason that I hired Miss Lind, and not she me,\"\r\nreplied Barnum, \"and because I ought never to take a farthing\r\nless for my risk and trouble than the contract gives me. I have\r\nvoluntarily given Miss Lind more than twice as much as I\r\noriginally contracted to give her, or as she expected to receive\r\nwhen she engaged with me. Now if she is not satisfied I wish to\r\nsettle instantly and finally. If you do not bring me her decision\r\nto-day, I shall ask her for it in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Barnum asked him again for the written\r\ncommunication from Miss Lind; the secretary replied that it was\r\nall a \"joke,\" and that he merely wanted to see what the manager\r\nwould say to the proposition. He begged that nothing would be\r\nsaid to Miss Lind concerning it. So it is altogether likely that\r\nshe knew nothing of it. The four concerts at St. Louis were given\r\nand the program as arranged for the other cities was carried out,\r\nwith no more troublous incidents occurring.\r\n\r\nTo show that Barnum's efforts as manager of the Jenny Lind\r\nenterprise were appreciated, we copy the dedication of Sol\r\nSmith's Autobiography published in 1854. Smith was one of the\r\ncharacters of his time, being celebrated as a comedian, an\r\nauthor, a manager and a lawyer:\r\n\r\n\"TO PHINEAS T. BARNUM, PROPRIETOR OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM, ETC.\r\n\r\n\"Great Impressario. Whilst you were engaged in your grand Jenny\r\nLind speculation, the following conundrum went the rounds of the\r\nAmerican newspapers:\r\n\r\n\" 'Why is it that Jenny Lind and Barnum will never fall out?'\r\nAnswer: 'Because he is always for-getting, and she is always\r\nfor-giving.'\r\n\r\n\"I have never asked you the question directly, whether you, Mr.\r\nBarnum, started that conundrum, or not; but I strongly suspect\r\nthat you did. At all events, I noticed that your whole policy was\r\nconcentrated into one idea--to make an angel of Jenny, and\r\ndepreciate yourself in contrast.\r\n\r\n\"You may remember that in this city (St. Louis), I acted in one\r\ninstance as your 'legal adviser,' and as such, necessarily became\r\nacquainted with all the particulars of your contract with the\r\nso-called Swedish Nightingale, as well as the various\r\nmodifications claimed by that charitable lady, and submitted to\r\nby you after her arrival in this country; which modifications (I\r\nsuppose it need no longer be a secret) secured to her--besides\r\nthe original stipulation of one thousand dollars for every\r\nconcert, attendants, carriages, assistant artists, and a pompous\r\nand extravagant retinue, fit (only) for a European\r\nprincess--one-half of the profits of each performance. You may\r\nalso remember the legal advice I gave you on the occasion\r\nreferred to, and the salutary effect of your following it. You\r\nmust remember the extravagant joy you felt afterwards, in\r\nPhiladelphia, when the 'Angel' made up her mind to avail herself\r\nof one of the stipulations in her contract, to break off at the\r\nend of a hundred nights, and even bought out seven of that\r\nhundred--supposing that she could go on without your aid as well\r\nas with it. And you cannot but remember, how, like a rocket-stick\r\nshe dropped, when your business connection with her ended, and\r\nhow she 'fizzed out' the remainder of her concert nights in this\r\npart of the world, and soon afterwards retired to her domestic\r\nblissitude in Sweden.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Mr. Barnum, if you would only tell, which of the two\r\nit was that was 'for-getting,' and which 'for-giving;' and you\r\nalso know who actually gave the larger portion of those sums\r\nwhich you heralded to the world as the sole gifts of the 'divine\r\nJenny.'\r\n\r\n\"Of all your speculations--from the negro centenarian, who didn't\r\nnurse General Washington, down to the Bearded Woman of\r\nGenoa--there was not one which required the exercise of so much\r\nhumbuggery as the Jenny Lind concerts; and I verily believe there\r\nis no man living, other than yourself, who could, or would, have\r\nrisked the enormous expenditure of money necessary to carry them\r\nthrough successfully--travelling, with sixty artists; four\r\nthousand miles, and giving ninety-three concerts, at an actual\r\ncost of forty-five hundred dollars each, is what no other man\r\nwould have undertaken --you accomplished this, and pocketed by\r\nthe operation but little less than two hundred thousand dollars!\r\nMr. Barnum, you are yourself, alone!\r\n\r\n\"I honor you, oh! Great Impressario, as the most successful\r\nmanager in America or any other country. Democrat, as you are,\r\nyou can give a practical lesson to the aristocrats of Europe how\r\nto live. At your beautiful and tasteful residence, 'Iranistan' (I\r\ndon't like the name, though), you can and do entertain your\r\nfriends with a warmth of hospitality, only equalled by that of\r\nthe great landed proprietors of the old country, or of our own\r\n'sunny South.' Whilst riches are pouring into your coffers from\r\nyour various 'ventures' in all parts of the world, you do not\r\nhoard your immense means, but continually 'cast them forth upon\r\nthe waters,' rewarding labor, encouraging the arts, and lending a\r\nhelping hand to industry in all its branches. Not content with\r\ndoing all this, you deal telling blows, whenever opportunity\r\noffers, upon the monster Intemperance. Your labors in this great\r\ncause alone should entitle you to the thanks of all good men,\r\nwomen and children in the land. Mr. Barnum, you deserve all your\r\ngood fortune, and I hope you may long live to enjoy your wealth\r\nand honor.\r\n\r\n\"As a small installment towards the debt, I, as one of the\r\ncommunity, owe you, and with the hope of affording you an hour's\r\namusement (if you can spare that amount of time from your\r\nnumerous avocations to read it), I present you with this little\r\nvolume, containing a very brief account of some of my\r\n'journey-work' in the South and West; and remain, very\r\nrespectfully,\r\n                 \"Your friend, and affectionate uncle,\r\n                                             \"SOL SMITH.\r\n\r\n\"CHOUTEAU AVENUE, ST. LOUIS,\r\n\"NOV. 1, 1854.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Barnum never acknowledged it, there was a vast deal of\r\ntruth in Mr. Smith's statements.\r\n\r\nWhenever Miss Lind sang for charity she gave what she might have\r\nearned at a regular concert; Barnum always insisted upon paying\r\nfor the hall, orchestra, printing and other expenses. But Miss\r\nLind received the entire credit for liberality and benevolence.\r\n\r\nIt is but just to say, however, that she frequently remonstrated\r\nwith Barnum and declared that the expenses ought to be deducted\r\nfrom the proceeds of the concert, but he always insisted on doing\r\nwhat he called his share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. CLOSING THE GRAND TOUR.\r\n\r\nAPRIL FOOL JOKES AT NASHVILLE--A TRICK AT CINCINNATI--RETURN TO\r\nNEW YORK--JENNY LIND PERSUADED TO LEAVE BARNUM--FINANCIAL RESULTS\r\nOF THE ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\nFive concerts were given at St. Louis, and then they went to\r\nNashville, Tenn., where the sixty-sixth and sixty-seventh of the\r\nseries were given. At the latter place, Jenny Lind, accompanied\r\nby Barnum and his daughter, Mrs. Lyman, visited \"The Hermitage,\"\r\nwhere Barnum himself had years before seen \"Old Hickory\" Jackson.\r\nWhile there, the prima donna heard, for the first time in her\r\nlife, wild mocking birds singing in the trees, and great was her\r\ndelight thereat.\r\n\r\nThey spent the first of April, 1851, at Nashville. In the\r\nforenoon of the day, the various members of the party amused\r\nthemselves by playing little \"April Fool\" jokes on Barnum, and\r\nafter dinner he took his revenge upon them. Securing a supply of\r\ntelegraph blanks and envelopes, he set to work preparing messages\r\nfull of the most sensational and startling intelligence, for most\r\nof the people in the party. Almost every one of them presently\r\nreceived what purported to be a telegraphic despatch. Barnum's\r\nown daughter did not escape. She was informed that her mother,\r\nher cousin, and several other relatives, were waiting for her in\r\nLouisville, and various other important and extraordinary items\r\nof domestic intelligence were communicated to her. Mr. Le Grand\r\nSmith was told by a despatch from his father that his native\r\nvillage in Connecticut, was in ashes, including his own\r\nhomestead, etc. Several of Barnum's employees had most liberal\r\noffers of engagements from banks and other institutions at the\r\nNorth. Burke, and others of the musical professors, were offered\r\nprincely salaries by opera managers, and many of them received\r\nmost tempting inducements to proceed immediately to the World's\r\nFair in London.\r\n\r\nOne married gentleman received the gratifying intelligence that\r\nhe had for two days been the father of a pair of bouncing boys\r\n(mother and children doing well), an event which he had been\r\nanxiously looking for during the week, though on a somewhat more\r\nlimited scale. In fact, nearly every person in the party engaged\r\nby Barnum received some extraordinary telegraphic intelligence;\r\nand, as the great impressario managed to have the despatches\r\ndelivered simultaneously, each recipient was for some time busily\r\noccupied with his own personal news.\r\n\r\nBy and by each began to tell his neighbor his good or bad\r\ntidings; and each was, of course, rejoiced or grieved, according\r\nto circumstances. Several gave Mr. Barnum notice of their\r\nintention to leave him, in consequence of better offers; and a\r\nnumber of them sent off telegraphic despatches and letters by\r\nmail, in answer to those received.\r\n\r\nThe man who had so suddenly become the father of twins,\r\ntelegraphed to his wife to \"be of good cheer,\" and that he would\r\n\"start for home to-morrow.\" And so cleverly did Barnum manage the\r\nwhole business that his victims did not discover how they had\r\nbeen fooled until next morning, when they read the whole story in\r\na local newspaper, to which it had been given by Barnum himself.\r\n\r\nFrom Nashville, Jenny Lind and a few of the party went to the\r\nMammoth Cave, and thence to Louisville, the others going directly\r\nto the latter point by steamer. There they were joined by Signor\r\nSalvi, whom Barnum had engaged at Havana. Three concerts were\r\ngiven at Louisville, and they then proceeded to Cincinnati,\r\naccompanied by George D. Prentice, the famous editor of The\r\nLouisville Journal. A stop was made at Madison long enough to\r\ngive one concert, and they reached Cincinnati the next morning.\r\nThere was a tremendous crowd on the wharf, and Barnum was afraid\r\nthat an attempt to repeat the ruse he had played with his\r\ndaughter at New Orleans would not work here, as an account of it\r\nhad been published in the Cincinnati papers, and everyone would\r\nbe suspecting it. But he was fertile in expedients, and quickly\r\ndevised another scheme.\r\n\r\nSo he took Miss Lind on his arm and boldly started to walk down\r\nthe gang-plank in the face of the crowd. As he did so, Le Grand\r\nSmith, who was in the plot, called out from the deck of the boat,\r\nas if he had been one of the passengers, \"That's no go, Mr.\r\nBarnum; you can't pass your daughter off for Jenny Lind this\r\ntime.\" The remark elicited a peal of merriment from the crowd,\r\nseveral persons calling out, \"that won't do, Barnum! You may fool\r\nthe New Orleans folks, but you can't come it over the 'Buckeyes.'\r\nWe intend to stay here until you bring out Jenny Lind!\" They\r\nreadily allowed him to pass with the lady whom they supposed to\r\nbe his daughter, and in five minutes afterwards the Nightingale\r\nwas complimenting Mr. Coleman upon the beautiful and commodious\r\napartments which were devoted to her in the Burnett House.\r\n\r\nA concert was given at Wheeling, and another at Pittsburg, and\r\nthen, early in May, the company returned to New York. There they\r\ngave fourteen concerts, partly at Castle Garden and partly at\r\nMetropolitan Hall, making ninety-two of the regular series.\r\n\r\nMiss Lind now came within the influence of various legal and\r\nother advisers, who seemed intent on creating trouble between her\r\nand her manager. Barnum soon discovered this state of affairs,\r\nbut was little troubled by it. Indeed he really hoped that they\r\nwould persuade her to stop at the hundredth concert, for he was\r\nalready worn out with the constant excitement and unremitting\r\nexertions of the tour. He thought that perhaps it would be well\r\nfor Miss Lind to try giving a few concerts on her own account, or\r\nunder some other manager, in order to disprove what her friends\r\nhad told her, namely, that Mr. Barnum had not managed the\r\nenterprise as successfully as he might have done.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he was much pleased when, after the eighty-fifth\r\nconcert, she told him that she had decided to pay the forfeit of\r\n$25,000, and terminate the concert tour after the one hundredth\r\nperformance. After the second series of concerts in New York,\r\nthey went to Philadelphia, where Barnum had advertised the\r\nninety-third and ninety-fourth concerts. As he did not care\r\nenough for the probable profits of the last seven of the hundred\r\nconcerts to run the risk of disturbing the very friendly\r\nrelations which had so far existed between him and Miss Lind, he\r\nnow offered to relinquish the engagement, if she desired it, at\r\nthe end of the ninety-third concert. The only terms he required\r\nwere that she would allow him $1,000 for each of the remaining\r\nseven concerts, besides the $25,000 forfeit already agreed upon.\r\nShe accepted this offer, and the engagement was forthwith ended.\r\n\r\nAfter parting with Barnum, Miss Lind gave a number of concerts,\r\nwith varied success. Then she went to Niagara Falls for a time,\r\nand afterward to Northampton, Massachusetts. While living at the\r\nlatter place she visited Boston, and was there married to Otto\r\nGoldschmidt. He was a German composer and pianist, who had\r\nstudied music with her in Germany, and to whom she had long been\r\nmuch attached. He had, indeed, travelled with her and Barnum\r\nduring a portion of their tour, and had played at several of the\r\nconcerts.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of their engagement, Barnum and Miss Lind met on\r\nseveral occasions, always in the friendliest manner. Once, at\r\nBridgeport, she complained rather bitterly to him of the\r\nunpleasant experiences she had had since leaving him. \"People\r\ncheat me and swindle me very much,\" said she, \"and I find it very\r\nannoying to give concerts on my own account.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was always,\" said Mr. Barnum, sometime afterward, \"supplied\r\nwith complimentary tickets when she gave concerts in New York,\r\nand on the occasion of her last appearance in America I visited\r\nher in her room back of the stage, and bade her and her husband\r\nadieu, with my best wishes. She expressed the same feeling to me\r\nin return. She told me she should never sing much, if any more,\r\nin public; but I reminded her that a good Providence had endowed\r\nher with a voice which enabled her to contribute in an eminent\r\ndegree to the enjoyment of her fellow beings, and if she no\r\nlonger needed the large sums of money which they were willing to\r\npay for this elevating and delightful entertainment, she knew by\r\nexperience what a genuine pleasure she would receive by devoting\r\nthe money to the alleviation of the wants and sorrows of those\r\nwho needed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Mr. Barnum,\" she replied, \"that is very true; and it would\r\nbe ungrateful in me to not continue to use, for the benefit of\r\nthe poor and lowly, that gift which our kind Heavenly Father has\r\nso graciously bestowed upon me. Yes, I will continue to sing so\r\nlong as my voice lasts, but it will be mostly for charitable\r\nobjects, for I am thankful to say that I have all the money which\r\nI shall ever need.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to add that this noble resolution was carried out.\r\nA large proportion of the concerts which she gave after her\r\nreturn to Europe and during the remainder of her entire public\r\ncareer, were devoted to objects of charity. If she consented, for\r\nexample, to sing for a charitable object in London, the fact was\r\nnot advertised at all, but the tickets were readily disposed of\r\nin private for from $5 to $10 each.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Barnum, he was glad to enjoy a season of rest and\r\nquiet after such an arduous campaign. After leaving Miss Lind, in\r\nPhiladelphia, therefore, he went to Cape May for a week and then\r\nto his home Iranistan, where he spent the remainder of the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, as a matter of record, to review at this\r\npoint, the financial results of this notable series of concerts.\r\nThe following recapitulation is entirely accurate, being taken\r\nfrom Mr. Barnum's own account books:\r\n\r\nJENNY LIND CONCERTS.\r\n\r\nTOTAL RECEIPTS, EXCEPTING OF CONCERTS DEVOTED TO CHARITY.\r\n----\r\nNew York ..............  $17,864.05\r\n  \"      ..............   14,203.03\r\n                       -----------\r\nNo. 1.  \"................ 12,519.59\r\n    2.  \"................ 14,266.09\r\n    3.  \"................ 12,174.74\r\n    4.  \"................ 16,028.39\r\n    5.

A FEW SIDE ISSUES.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPEDITION TO CEYLON--HARNESSING AN ELEPHANT TO A\r\nPLOW--BARNUM AND VANDERBILT--THE TALKING MACHINE--A FIRE AT\r\nIRANISTAN--MOUNTAIN GROVE CEMETERY.\r\n\r\nThe great showman did not allow even so great an enterprise as\r\nthe Jenny Lind concerts to monopolize his attention. In 1849 he\r\nplanned the formation of a great travelling show, combining the\r\nfeatures of a museum, a menagerie and a circus. In this he\r\nassociated with himself Mr. Seth B. Howes, who was already a\r\nnoted and successful showman, and also Mr. Stratton, the father\r\nof Tom Thumb. In order to procure a supply of novelties for this\r\nshow they chartered the ship \"Regatta,\" and sent it from New York\r\nin May, 1850, to Ceylon. The object of this voyage, was to\r\nprocure, either by purchase or by capture, a number of living\r\nelephants and other wild animals. To make sure of a sufficient\r\nsupply of fodder for them, nearly a thousand tons of hay were\r\npurchased in New York and taken out aboard the ship. Five hundred\r\ntons of it were left at the Island of St. Helena, to be taken up\r\non the return trip, and a great supply of staves and hoops were\r\nalso left there for the construction of water casks.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary mission was successful. In almost exactly a\r\nyear from the day of sailing the ship returned to New York. Its\r\nnovel cargo was unloaded, the ten elephants which had been\r\nsecured were harnessed in pairs to a gigantic chariot, and the\r\nwhole show paraded up Broadway past the Irving House. It was\r\nreviewed from the window of that hotel by Jenny Lind, who was\r\nstopping there on her second visit to New York. An elaborate\r\noutfit of horses, wagons, tents, etc., was added, the whole\r\ncosting over $100,000, and then the show went on the road under\r\nthe nominal leadership of Tom Thumb. It was called, \"Barnum's\r\nGreat Asiatic Caravan, Museum and Menagerie;\" it travelled about\r\nthe country for four years, and yielded to its proprietors\r\nenormous profits.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this tour Barnum sold out the entire establishment,\r\nincluding animals, cages, chariots and everything else, excepting\r\none elephant. This huge brute he took to his farm at Bridgeport,\r\nfor advertising purposes. It occurred to him that if he should\r\nkeep the animal there for a time and put him to some novel use,\r\nsuch as working on the farm, it would set people to talking and\r\ngreatly add to public curiosity and interest in his American\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly took the elephant to Bridgeport and put him in\r\ncharge of a competent keeper, who was dressed in a striking\r\nOriental costume. A six acre field close by the New York and New\r\nHaven railroad track was set apart for their use. Barnum gave the\r\nkeeper a time-table of the road and directed him to make a point,\r\nwhenever trains were passing, always to be busily engaged with\r\nthe elephant at plowing or other agricultural work as close to\r\nthe track as possible. Of course the passengers noticed the\r\nstrange spectacle, items concerning it appeared in the\r\nnewspapers, extending even to the press of foreign lands, and\r\nthousands of people came from all parts of the country to witness\r\nthe strange sight. Every mail brought numerous letters inquiring\r\nabout it. Many of these were from the officers of agricultural\r\nsocieties in all parts of the United States, making serious and\r\nearnest inquiry as to the utility of the elephant as an\r\nagricultural animal. These letters were greatly diversified in\r\ntone, but the substance of their inquires was about as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"Is the elephant a profitable agricultural animal?\"\r\n\r\n2. \"How much can an elephant plow in a day?\"\r\n\r\n3. \"How much can he draw?\"\r\n\r\n4. \"How much does he eat?\"--this question was invariably asked,\r\nand was a very important one.\r\n\r\n5. \"Will elephants make themselves generally useful on a farm?\"\r\n\r\n6. \"What is the price of an elephant?\"\r\n\r\n7. \"Where can elephants be purchased?\"\r\n\r\nThen would follow a score of other inquiries, such as, whether\r\nelephants were easily managed; if they would quarrel with cattle;\r\nif it was possible to breed them; how old calf elephants must be\r\nbefore they would earn their own living; and so on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nBarnum presently began to be alarmed lest some one should buy an\r\nelephant and thus share the fate of the man who drew one in a\r\nlottery and did not know what to do with him. \"Accordingly,\" he\r\nsays, \"I had a general letter printed, which I mailed to all my\r\nanxious inquirers. It was headed 'strictly confidential,' and I\r\nthen stated, begging my correspondents 'not to mention it,' that\r\nto me the elephant was a valuable agricultural animal, because he\r\nwas an excellent advertisement to my museum; but that to other\r\nfarmers he would prove very unprofitable for many reasons. In the\r\nfirst place, such an animal would cost from $3,000 to $10,000; in\r\ncold weather he could not work at all; in any weather he could\r\nnot earn half his living; he would eat up the value of his own\r\nhead, trunk and body every year; and I begged my correspondents\r\nnot to do so foolish a thing as to undertake elephant farming.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this experiment in advertising was highly\r\nsuccessful. Newspaper correspondents sent highly colored accounts\r\nof it all over the world, and numerous pictures of the elephant\r\nharnessed to a plow appeared in the illustrated papers and\r\nmagazines. After the field had been plowed over fifty or sixty\r\ntimes, Barnum concluded that the elephant had been \"worked for\r\nall he was worth,\" and sold him to Van Amburgh's menagerie.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Mr. Barnum became a part owner of the steamship \"North\r\nAmerica,\" which he proposed to run between America and Ireland as\r\na passenger and freight vessel. This idea was presently\r\nabandoned, and the ship was sent around Cape Horn to San\r\nFrancisco and put into service on the Pacific Mail Line,\r\nCommodore Cornelius Vanderbilt having purchased a one-half\r\ninterest in it and Mr. Barnum retaining one-third interest in the\r\nremaining half. After she had made several trips Barnum called\r\nupon Mr. Vanderbilt at his office and introduced himself. It was\r\ntheir first meeting, and this is Barnum's own account of the\r\ninterview:\r\n\r\n\" 'Is it possible you are Barnum?' exclaimed the Commodore, in\r\nsurprise, 'why, I expected to see a monster, part lion, part\r\nelephant, and a mixture of rhinoceros and tiger! Is it possible,'\r\nhe continued, 'that you are the showman who has made so much\r\nnoise in the world?'\r\n\r\n\"I laughingly replied that I was, and added that if I too had\r\nbeen governed in my anticipation of his personal appearance by\r\nthe fame he had achieved in his line, I should have expected to\r\nhave been saluted by a steam whistle, and to have seen him\r\ndressed in a pea jacket, blowing off steam, and crying out 'all\r\naboard that's going.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Instead of which,' replied Mr. Vanderbilt, 'I suppose you have\r\ncome to ask me to walk up to the Captain's office and settle.'\r\n\r\n\"After this interchange of civilities, we talked about the\r\nsuccess of the 'North America' in having got safely around the\r\nHorn, and of the acceptable manner in which she was doing her\r\nduty on the Pacific side.\r\n\r\n\" 'We have received no statement of her earnings yet,' said the\r\nCommodore, 'but if you want money, give your receipt to our\r\ntreasurer, and take some.'\r\n\r\n\"A few months subsequent to this, I sold out my share in the\r\nsteamship to Mr. Daniel Drew.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous smaller enterprises also marked this stage of Mr.\r\nBarnum's career. Some of these were connected with his museum,\r\nwhile others were entirely independent of it. Thus in 1844, in\r\nParis, besides purchasing Robt. Houdin's ingenius automatic\r\nwriter and other costly curiosities for the museum, he had made\r\nat great expense, a huge panorama of the funeral of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. This gigantic picture showed every event of that\r\npageant, beginning with the embarkation of the body at St. Helena\r\nand ending with its final entombment at the Hotel des Invalides.\r\nThis exhibition, after having had its day at the American Museum,\r\nwas sold, and extensively and profitably exhibited elsewhere.\r\nWhile Barnum was in London, during the same year, he engaged a\r\ncompany of \"Campanalogians, or Lancashire Bell Ringers,\" then\r\nperforming in Ireland, to make an American tour. They were really\r\nadmirable performers, and by means of their numerous bells of\r\nvarious sizes, they produced the most delightful music. They\r\nattracted much attention in various parts of the United States,\r\nin Canada, and in Cuba.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of the bell ringers to the English public Barnum\r\nsecured and sent thither a party of sixteen North American\r\nIndians, who were widely exhibited. On his return to America\r\nafter his first visit to Europe he engaged an ingenious workman\r\nto construct an automatic orator. This was a life-size and\r\nremarkably life-like figure, and when worked from a key-board\r\nsimilar to that of a piano it actually uttered words and\r\nsentences with surprising distinctness. It was exhibited for\r\nseveral months in London and elsewhere in England, but though it\r\nwas really a wonderful machine and attracted the earnest\r\nattention of some people, it was not a popular success. The Duke\r\nof Wellington visited it several times, and at first he thought\r\nthat the \"voice\" proceeded from the exhibiter, whom he assumed to\r\nbe a skilful ventriloquist. He was asked to touch the keys with\r\nhis own fingers, and, after some instruction in the method of\r\noperating, he was able to make the machine speak, not only in\r\nEnglish but also in German, with which language the Duke seemed\r\nfamiliar. Thereafter, he entered his name on the exhibiter's\r\nautograph book, and certified that the \"Automaton Speaker\" was an\r\nextraordinary production of mechanical genius.\r\n\r\nBarnum also secured duplicates of the models of machinery\r\nexhibited at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in London and a\r\ngreat many interesting panoramas and pictures. These were all\r\nexhibited at his museum in New York and afterwards sold to other\r\ntravelling showmen who exhibited them throughout the country. In\r\nthe summer of 1850 he added to the museum his famous Chinese\r\ncollection, including a Chinese family of two men, two \"small\r\nfooted\" women, and two children.\r\n\r\nFew of his curiosities attracted more attention than the\r\nperformances of the \"Scotch Boys.\" One of these was securely\r\nblindfolded, and then, in answer to questions put by the other,\r\naccurately described any objects presented by persons who\r\nattended the surprising exhibition. The mystery, which was merely\r\nthe result of patient practice, consisted wholly in the manner in\r\nwhich the question was propounded; in fact, the question\r\ninvariably carried its own answer; for instance:\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" meant gold; \"Now what is this?\" silver; \"Say,\r\nwhat is this?\" copper; \"Tell me what this is?\" iron; \"What is the\r\nshape?\" long; \"Now, what shape?\" round; \"Say what shape?\" square;\r\n\"Please say what this is,\" a watch; \"Can you tell what is in this\r\nlady's hand?\" a purse; \"Now, please say what this is?\" a key;\r\n\"Come now, what is this?\" money; \"How much?\" a penny; \"Now, how\r\nmuch?\" sixpence; \"Say how much,\" a quarter of a dollar; \"What\r\ncolor is this?\" black; \"Now, what color is this?\" red; \"Say what\r\ncolor?\" green; and so on, ad infinitum. To such perfection was\r\nthis brought that it was almost impossible to present any object\r\nthat could not be quite closely described by the blindfolded boy.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, the celebrated Bateman children acted for several weeks\r\nat the American Museum, and in June of that year Barnum sent them\r\nto London with their father and Mr. Le Grand Smith, where they\r\nplayed in the St. James Theatre, and afterwards in the principal\r\nprovincial theatres. The elder of these children, Miss Kate\r\nBateman, subsequently attained the highest histrionic distinction\r\nin America and abroad, and reached the head of her profession.\r\n\r\nMiss Catharine Hayes and Herr Begnis were engaged by Barnum in\r\nthe fall of 1852 to give a series of sixty concerts in\r\nCalifornia, and the enterprise proved highly profitable, although\r\nMr. Barnum intrusted its execution to his agents, not caring\r\nhimself to travel so far. Before she set out for California Miss\r\nHayes, with her mother and sister, spent several days at\r\nIranistan to attend the marriage of Barnum's eldest daughter,\r\nCaroline, to Mr. David W. Thompson.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was to take place in the evening, and on the\r\nafternoon of that day Mr. Barnum went to Bridgeport to get shaved\r\nfor the occasion. While he was lying in the barber's chair, half\r\nof his face shaved and the other half covered with lather, his\r\nprospective son-in-law, Mr. Thompson, drove up to the door of the\r\nshop and rushed in, exclaiming excitedly, \"Mr. Barnum, Iranistan\r\nis in flames!\" Barnum jumped up from the chair and, half shaved\r\nand with the lather still on his face, jumped into the wagon and\r\nstarted for home with the horse on a run. \"I was greatly\r\nalarmed,\" he afterward said, \"for the house was full of visitors\r\nwho had come from a distance to attend the wedding, and all the\r\ncostly presents, dresses, refreshments, and everything prepared\r\nfor a marriage celebration to which nearly a thousand guests had\r\nbeen invited, were already in my house. Mr. Thompson told me he\r\nhad seen the flames bursting from the roof, and it seemed to me\r\nthat there was little hope of saving the building.\r\n\r\n\"My mind was distressed, not so much at the great pecuniary loss\r\nwhich the destruction of Iranistan would involve, as at the\r\npossibility that some of my family or visitors would be killed or\r\nseriously injured in attempting to save something from the fire.\r\nThen I thought of the sore disappointment this calamity would\r\ncause to the young couple, as well as to those who were invited\r\nto the wedding. I saw that Mr. Thompson looked pale and anxious.\r\n\r\n\" 'Never mind!' said I; 'we can't help these things; the house\r\nwill probably be burned; but if no one is killed or injured, you\r\nshall be married to-night, if we are obliged to perform the\r\nceremony in the coach-house.'\r\n\r\n\"On our way, we overtook a fire company, and I implored them to\r\n'hurry up their machine.' Arriving in sight of Iranistan, we saw\r\nhuge volumes of smoke rolling out from the roof and many men on\r\nthe top of the house were passing buckets of water to pour upon\r\nthe fire. Fortunately, several men had been engaged during the\r\nday in repairing the roof, and their ladders were against the\r\nhouse. By these means and with the assistance of the men employed\r\nupon my grounds, water was passed very rapidly, and the flames\r\nwere soon subdued without serious damage. The inmates of\r\nIranistan were thoroughly frightened; Catherine Hayes and other\r\nvisitors, packed their trunks and had them carried out on the\r\nlawn; and the house came as near destruction as it well could and\r\nescape.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Hayes was at Bridgeport she gave, at Barnum's request,\r\na concert for the benefit of \"Mountain Grove Cemetery,\" and the\r\nlarge proceeds were devoted to the erection of the stone tower\r\nand gateway that now adorn the entrance to that beautiful resting\r\nplace of the dead. Barnum had bought the eighty acres of land for\r\nthis cemetery a few years before from several farmers. He had\r\nbeen in the habit of tramping over it, gunning, and while thus\r\nengaged, had observed its admirable fitness for the purposes of a\r\ncemetery. After the title deeds for the property were secured, it\r\nwas offered for a cemetery, and at a meeting of citizens, several\r\nlots were subscribed for. enough. indeed, to cover the amount of\r\nthe purchase money. Thus was begun the \"Mountain Grove Cemetery,\"\r\nwhich is now beautifully laid out and adorned with many tasteful\r\nand costly monuments. Among these are Barnum's own substantial\r\ngranite monument, the family monuments of Harral, Bishop,\r\nHubbell, Lyon, Wood, Loomis, Wordin, Hyde, and others, and\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb erected a tall marble shaft which is surmounted\r\nby a life-size statue of himself. There is no more charming\r\nburial-ground in the whole country; yet when the project was\r\nsuggested, many persons preferred an intermural cemetery to this\r\nrural resting-place for their departed friends; though now all\r\nconcur in considering it fortunate that this adjunct was secured\r\nto Bridgeport before the land could be permanently devoted to\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. Dion Boucicault also lectured at Bridgeport for the benefit\r\nof this cemetery and Tom Thumb gave an entertainment for the same\r\nobject. At Barnum's request and under his management, Tom Thumb\r\nand his wife, and Commodore Nutt and his wife, gave several\r\nexhibitions and entertainments for the benefit of the Bridgeport\r\nCharitable Society, the Bridgeport Library, and other local\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. SOME DOMESTIC ENTERPRISES.\r\n\r\nPUTTING A PICKPOCKET ON EXHIBITION--TRAVELLING INCOGNITO--THE\r\nPEQUONNOCK BANK--THE NEW YORK CRYSTAL PALACE--A POEM ON AN\r\nINCIDENT AT IRANISTAN.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1853 Alfred Bunn, formerly manager of Drury Lane\r\nTheatre, London, arrived in Boston. He was then one of the most\r\nnotable figures in the theatrical world. It was he who had made\r\nthe first engagement with Jenny Lind to appear in London. She had\r\nbeen induced to break this engagement, however, through the\r\nsolicitations of Mr. Lumley, of Her Majesty's Theatre, with the\r\nresult that Mr. Lumley had to pay to Mr. Bunn heavy damages for\r\nthe breach of contract. Barnum and Bunn had never met, though\r\nthey knew each other well by reputation, and indeed Bunn labored\r\nunder the delusion that he had met Barnum, for soon after his\r\narrival he hastened to New York and entered Barnum's private\r\noffice at the Museum with the exclamation, \"Well, Barnum, do you\r\nremember me?\"\r\n\r\nBarnum was confident that he had never seen him before, and\r\nindeed did not really know who he was. But, quick as a flash, he\r\nthought that the ex-manager of Drury Lane must be the only living\r\nEnglishman with presumption enough to accost him in this way. So\r\nhe answered without hesitation, \"Why, this is Mr. Bunn, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my boy,\" said Bunn, slapping him familiarly on the back, \"I\r\nthought you would remember me. Well, Barnum, how have you been\r\nsince I last saw you?\"\r\n\r\nBarnum replied in a manner that encouraged his impression that\r\nthey were old acquaintances, and during the next two hours they\r\nhad much gossip about men and affairs in London. Bunn called upon\r\nBarnum several times after that, and probably never realized that\r\nBarnum really had been in London two or three years without\r\nmaking his acquaintance. When Barnum went to London again in 1858\r\nhe renewed his acquaintance with Bunn and they became great\r\nchums.\r\n\r\nThe years 1851, 1852 and 1853 were mostly spent at Bridgeport,\r\nwith frequent visits to New York of a day or two each. In the\r\nlast-named year he resigned the office of President of the\r\nFairfield County Agricultural Society, but in accepting his\r\nresignation the society insisted that it should not go into\r\neffect until after the annual fair of 1854 His administration of\r\nthe affairs of the society had been very successful, especially\r\nin relation to the fairs and cattle shows.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Barnum turned every circumstance to account\r\nin the interest of these fairs is well shown in his dealings with\r\na pickpocket at the fair of 1853. The man was caught in the act\r\nof taking a pocket-book from a country farmer, and on arrest was\r\nfound to be a notorious English thief. He had already victimized\r\nmany other visitors to the fair, and there was almost a state of\r\npanic among the visitors. The fair was to close the next day.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the thief was taken before a justice,\r\nlegally examined, and was bound over for trial. Barnum then\r\nobtained consent from the Sheriff that the fellow should be put\r\non the fair grounds, for the purpose of giving those who had been\r\nrobbed an opportunity of identifying him. For this purpose he was\r\nhandcuffed and placed in a conspicuous position, where of course\r\nhe was \"the observed of all observers.\" Then Barnum papered the\r\ncountry round about with handbills, stating that, for the last\r\nday of the fair, the managers had secured an extraordinary\r\nattraction. They would, he said, exhibit, safely handcuffed, and\r\nwithout extra charge, a live pickpocket, who had on the day\r\npreceding been caught in the act of robbing an honest farmer.\r\nCrowds of people rushed in to see the show, parents for miles\r\naround brought their children to see the awful example of\r\niniquity, and great was the profit to the treasury of the fair.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his presidency in 1854 Barnum was asked to\r\ndeliver the opening speech at the County Fair at Stamford. He did\r\nso, delivering simply a portion of his lecture on \"The Philosophy\r\nof Humbug.\" The next morning, as he was being shaved in the\r\nvillage barber's shop, which was at the time crowded with\r\ncustomers, the ticket-seller to the fair came in. Here is\r\nBarnum's own account of what followed:\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a house did you have last night?\" asked one of the\r\ngentlemen in waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, first-rate, of course. Barnum always draws a crowd,\" was the\r\nreply of the ticket-seller, to whom I was not known.\r\n\r\nMost of the gentlemen present, however, knew me, and they found\r\nmuch difficulty in restraining their laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Did Barnum make a good speech?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I did not hear it. I was out in the ticket-office. I guess it\r\nwas pretty good, for I never heard so much laughing as there was\r\nall through his speech. But it makes no difference whether it was\r\ngood or not,\" continued the ticket-seller, \"the people will go to\r\nsee Barnum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barnum must be a curious chap,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess he is up to all the dodges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not personally,\" he replied; \"but I always get into the Museum\r\nfor nothing. I know the doorkeeper, and he slips me in free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barnum would not like that, probably, if he knew it,\" I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"But it happens he don't know it,\" replied the ticket-seller, in\r\ngreat glee.\r\n\r\n\"Barnum was on the cars the other day, on his way to Bridgeport,\"\r\nsaid I, \"and I heard one of the passengers blowing him up\r\nterribly as a humbug. He was addressing Barnum at the time, but\r\ndid not know him. Barnum joined in lustily, and indorsed\r\neverything the man said. When the passenger learned whom he had\r\nbeen addressing, I should think he must have felt rather flat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so, too,\" said the ticket-seller.\r\n\r\nThis was too much, and we all indulged in a burst of laughter;\r\nstill the ticket-seller suspected nothing. After I had left the\r\nshop, the barber told him who I was. I called into the\r\nticket-office on business several times during the day, but the\r\npoor ticket-seller kept his face turned from me, and appeared so\r\nchapfallen that I did not pretend to recognize him as the hero of\r\nthe joke in the barber's shop.\r\n\r\nThere were many incidents similar to the foregoing in Barnum's\r\ncareer. One occurred on board a steamboat, going from New York to\r\nBridgeport. As they entered the harbor of the latter city a\r\nstranger asked the great showman to point out \"Barnum's house\"\r\nfrom the deck. Barnum did so, and then another bystander\r\nremarked, \"I know all about that house, for I did a lot of\r\npainting there for several months while Barnum was in Europe.\" He\r\nwent on to say that it was the meanest and worst contrived house\r\nhe ever saw, and added, \"It will cost old Barnum a mint of money\r\nand not be worth two cents after it is finished.\" \"I suppose from\r\nthat that old Barnum didn't pay you very punctually,\" observed\r\nBarnum himself. \"Oh, yes; he pays promptly every Saturday night,\"\r\nsaid the other; \"there's no trouble about that. He has made half\r\na million by exhibiting a little boy whom he took from Bridgeport\r\nand whom we never thought any great shakes until Barnum took him\r\nand trained him.\"\r\n\r\nPresently one of the other passengers told this man who Barnum\r\nwas, and nothing more was seen of him.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, says Barnum, I went to Boston by the Fall\r\nRiver route. Arriving before sunrise, I found but one carriage at\r\nthe depot. I immediately engaged it, and, giving the driver the\r\ncheck for my baggage, told him to take me directly to the Revere\r\nHouse, as I was in great haste, and enjoined him to take in no\r\nother passengers, and I would pay his demands. He promised\r\ncompliance with my wishes, but soon afterwards appeared with a\r\ngentleman, two ladies, and several children, whom he crowded into\r\nthe carriage with me, and, placing their trunks on the\r\nbaggage-rack, started off. I thought there was no use in\r\ngrumbling, and consoled myself with the reflection that the\r\nRevere House was not far away. He drove up one street and down\r\nanother for what seemed to me a very long time, but I was wedged\r\nin so closely that I could not see what route he was taking.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour's drive he halted, and I found we were at the\r\nLowell Railway Depot. Here my fellow-passengers alighted, and\r\nafter a long delay the driver delivered their baggage, received\r\nhis fare, and was about closing the carriage door preparatory to\r\nstarting again. I was so thoroughly vexed at the shameful manner\r\nin which he had treated me, that I remarked:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you had better wait till the Lowell train arrives; you\r\nmay possibly get another load of passengers. Of course my\r\nconvenience is of no consequence. I suppose if you land me at the\r\nRevere House any time this week, it will be as much as I have a\r\nright to expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he replied, \"but that was Barnum and his\r\nfamily. He was very anxious to get here in time for the first\r\ntrain, so I stuck him for $2, and now I'll carry you to the\r\nRevere House free.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Barnum is it?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Museum and Jenny Lind man,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nThe compliment and the shave both having been intended for me, I\r\nwas of course mollified, and replied, \"You are mistaken, my\r\nfriend, _I_ am Barnum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coachee\" was thunderstruck, and offered all sorts of apologies.\r\n\r\n\"A friend at the other depot told me that I had Mr. Barnum on\r\nboard,\" said he, \"and I really supposed he meant the other man.\r\nWhen I come to notice you, I perceive my mistake, but I hope you\r\nwill forgive me. I have carried you frequently before, and hope\r\nyou will give me your custom while you are in Boston. I never\r\nwill make such a mistake again.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pequonnock Bank of Bridgeport was organized in the spring of\r\n1851. Barnum had no interest whatever in it, not holding a single\r\nshare of the stock. He was, however, unanimously elected\r\nPresident of it. He accepted the office, but as he knew he could\r\nnot devote much time to it, requested that Mr. Hubbell, then\r\nMayor of Bridgeport, should be made Vice-President.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum also invested $20,000, as special partner, in a\r\ncompany for the publication of an illustrated weekly newspaper in\r\nNew York. This was The Illustrated News. The first number was\r\nissued on the 1st of January, 1853, and within a month it had\r\nseventy thousand circulation. Various complications arose, which\r\ngreatly annoyed Barnum, and at the end of the first year the\r\nwhole concern was sold out without loss.\r\n\r\nHe was earnestly urged, in February, 1854, to accept the\r\npresidency of the Universal Exposition, which was held in New\r\nYork in the famous Crystal Palace. At first he positively\r\ndeclined. But the matter was persistently urged upon him by many\r\ninfluential gentlemen, who represented to him that the success of\r\nthe enterprise depended upon his acceptance of the position. The\r\nresult was that at last he did accept it, and he entered upon its\r\nduties with all the vigor he could command. The concern was\r\nalmost bankrupt, and to save it from utter ruin Barnum advanced\r\nlarge sums of money from his own purse. By this means and by\r\nvarious other efforts, such as the re-inauguration, the famous\r\nJullien concerts, etc., here stored a semblance of prosperity.\r\nBut it was uphill work, and after a time he resigned the\r\npresidency and abandoned the institution to its fate.\r\n\r\nA little incident which occurred at Iranistan, in the winter of\r\n1852, was observed by a lady from Philadelphia who was visiting\r\nthere at the time. She afterward made it the subject of a poem,\r\nwhich Mr. Barnum prized highly. It was as follows:\r\n\r\nWINTER BOUQUETS.\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.\r\n\r\n The poor man's garden lifeless lay\r\n     Beneath a fall of snow;\r\n But Art in costly greenhouses,\r\n     Keeps Summer in full glow.\r\n And Taste paid gold for bright bouquets,\r\n     The parlor vase that drest,\r\n That scented Fashion's gray boudoir,\r\n     Or bloomed on Beauty's breast.\r\n\r\n  A rich man sat beside the fire,\r\n     Within his sculptured halls;\r\n Brave heart, clear head, and busy hand\r\n     Had reared those stately walls.\r\n He to his gardener spake, and said\r\n     In tone of quiet glee--\r\n \"I want a hundred fine bouquets--\r\n    Canst make them, John, for me?\r\n\r\n  John's eyes became exceeding round,\r\n     This question when he heard;\r\n He gazed upon his master,\r\n     And he answered not a word.\r\n \"Well, John,\" the rich man laughing said,\r\n     \"If these too many be,\r\n What sayest to half the number, man?\r\n     Canst fifty make for me?\"\r\n\r\n  Now John prized every flower, as 'twere\r\n     A daughter or a son;\r\n And thought, like Regan--\"What the need\r\n     Of fifty, or of one?\"\r\n But, keeping back the thought, he said,\r\n     \"I think, sir, that I might;\r\n But it would leave my lady's flowers\r\n     In very ragged plight.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Well, John, thy vegetable pets\r\n     Must needs respected be;\r\n We'll halve the number once again--\r\n    Make twenty-five for me.\r\n And hark ye, John, when they are made\r\n     Come up and let me know;\r\n And I'll give thee a list of those\r\n     To whom the flowers must go,\"\r\n\r\n  The twenty-five bouquets were made,\r\n     And round the village sent;\r\n And to whom thinkest thou, my friend,\r\n     These floral jewels went?\r\n Not to the beautiful and proud--\r\n     Not to the rich and gay--\r\n Who, Dives-like, at Luxury's feast\r\n     Are seated every day.\r\n\r\n An aged Pastor, on his desk\r\n     Saw those fair preachers stand;\r\n A Widow wept upon the gift,\r\n     And blessed the giver's hand.\r\n Where Poverty bent o'er her task,\r\n     They cheered the lonely room;\r\n And round the bed where sickness lay,\r\n     They breathed Health's fresh perfume\r\n\r\n  Oh! kindly heart and open hand--\r\n     Those flowers in dust are trod,\r\n But they bloom to weave a wreath for thee,\r\n     In the Paradise of God.\r\n Sweet is the Minstrel's task, whose song\r\n     Of deeds like these may tell;\r\n And long may he have power to give,\r\n     Who wields that Dower so well!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE JEROME CLOCK COMPANY.\r\n\r\nFOUNDING EAST BRIDGEPORT--GROWTH OF THE CITY--THE JEROME CLOCK\r\nBUBBLE--A RUINED MAN--PAYING HONEST DEBTS--DOWN IN THE DEPTHS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851 Mr. Barnum had purchased from William H. Noble,\r\nof Bridgeport, Conn., the undivided half of his late father's\r\nhomestead--fifty acres of land on the east side of the river,\r\nopposite the city of Bridgeport. Together they bought the one\r\nhundred and seventy-four acres adjoining, and laid out the entire\r\nproperty in regular streets, and lined them with trees. A\r\nbeautiful grove of eight acres was reserved for a park. This they\r\nintended for a nucleus of a new city, to be known as East\r\nBridgeport.\r\n\r\nThey then commenced selling alternate lots, at the same price as\r\nthe land had cost them by the acre, always on condition that a\r\nsuitable dwelling-house, store or manufactory should be erected\r\non the ground within a year; that every building should be placed\r\nat a certain distance from the street; that the style of\r\narchitecture should be approved by the sellers; that the grounds\r\nbe inclosed with suitable fences, and that in all respects the\r\nlocality should be kept desirable for respectable residents.\r\n\r\nA new foot-bridge was built across the river, connecting the new\r\ntown with the city of Bridgeport, and a public toll-bridge, which\r\nbelonged to Barnum and Noble, was thrown open to the public free.\r\nThey also erected a covered drawbridge at a cost of $16,000,\r\nwhich was made free to the public for several years.\r\n\r\nThey built and leased to a union company of young coach-makers a\r\nlarge manufactory, which was one of the first buildings erected\r\nin the town, and which went into operation on the first day of\r\nthe year 1852.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the inducements of low prices for the lots, the\r\nowners advanced one-half, two-thirds, and sometimes all the funds\r\nto erect buildings, permitting the purchasers to repay them in\r\nsmall sums at their own convenience. The town, under such\r\nfavorable auspices, began to develop and to grow with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nNo one of Barnum's schemes had ever interested him as this one\r\ndid. He was willing to listen to any one who thought they had a\r\nproject favorable to the advancement of the new city. It was the\r\nman's weak spot, and it was this weak spot which was destined to\r\nbe touched once too often.\r\n\r\nThere was a small clock factory in the town of Litchfield, in\r\nwhich Barnum was a stockholder. Thinking always of his beloved\r\nenterprise, it occurred to him at length that if the Litchfield\r\nclock company could be transferred to East Bridgeport, it would\r\nnecessarily bring with it numerous families to swell the\r\npopulation. A new stock company was formed, under the name of the\r\n\"Terry and Barnum Manufacturing Company,\" and in 1852 a factory\r\nwas built in East Bridgeport.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen how recklessly the owners of the site were\r\nspending money. They looked for their profits wholly from the\r\nsale of the reserved lots, which they felt sure would bring high\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Mr. Barnum was visited by the President of the Jerome\r\nClock Company, Mr. Chauncey Jerome, with a proposition that the\r\nconcern, which was reputed to be very wealthy, should be removed\r\nto East Bridgeport. Negotiations were opened, and at last Barnum\r\nwas offered a transfer of the great manufactory with its seven\r\nhundred to one thousand employees, if he would lend his name as\r\nsecurity for $110,000 in aid of the company.\r\n\r\nHe was shown an official report of the directors of the company,\r\nexhibiting a capital of $400,000 with a surplus of $187,000. They\r\nwere in need of money to tide over a dull season and a market\r\nglutted with goods. The company also was represented as being\r\nextremely loth to dismiss any of their employees, who would\r\nsuffer greatly if their means of livelihood were taken from them.\r\nThe company was reputed to be rich; the President, Mr. Chauncey\r\nJerome, had built a church in New Haven, at a cost of $40,000,\r\nand proposed to present it to a congregation; he had given a\r\nclock to a church in Bridgeport, and these things showed that he,\r\nat least, thought he was wealthy. The Jerome clocks were for sale\r\nall over the world, even in China, where the Celestials were said\r\nto take out the \"movements,\" and use the cases for little temples\r\nfor their idols, \"Thus proving that faith was possible without\r\n'works,' \" as Mr. Barnum said.\r\n\r\nFurther testimony came in the form of a letter from the cashier\r\nof one of the New Haven banks, expressing the highest confidence\r\nin the financial strength of the company. Barnum afterwards\r\nlearned that his correspondent represented a bank which was one\r\nof the largest creditors of the concern.\r\n\r\nBarnum finally agreed to lend the clock company his notes for a\r\nsum not to exceed $50,000, and to accept drafts to an amount not\r\nto exceed $60,000. He also received the written guarantee of the\r\nPresident, Chauncey Jerome, that in no event should he lose by\r\nthe loan, as he would be personally responsible for the\r\nrepayment. Mr. Barnum was willing that his notes should be taken\r\nup and renewed an indefinite number of times just so the maximum\r\nof $110,000 was not exceeded. Upon the representation that it was\r\nimpossible to say exactly when it would be necessary to use the\r\nnotes, Barnum was induced to put his name to several notes for\r\n$3,000, $5,000 and $10,000, leaving the date of payment blank, it\r\nbeing stipulated that the blanks should be filled to make the\r\nnotes payable in five, ten, or even sixty days from date. On the\r\nother hand, it was agreed that the Jerome Company should exchange\r\nits stock with the Terry and Barnum stockholders, thus absorbing\r\nthat concern, and unite the whole business in East Bridgeport.\r\n\r\nThree months later Barnum's memoranda showed that the entire\r\n$110,000 had been used. He was then solicited by the New York\r\nagent of the company for five additional notes for $5,000 each.\r\nThe request was refused unless they would return an equal amount\r\nof his own cancelled notes, since the agent assured him that they\r\nwere cancelling these notes \"every week.\" The cancelled notes\r\nwere brought him next day and he renewed them. This he did\r\nafterwards very frequently, until at last his confidence in their\r\nintegrity became so firmly established that he ceased to ask to\r\nsee the notes that had been taken up, but furnished new paper as\r\noften as it was desired.\r\n\r\nBut gradually the rumor that the banks were hesitating about\r\ndiscounting his paper came to Barnum's ears. Wondering at this,\r\nhe made a few inquiries, which resulted in the startling\r\ndiscovery that his notes had never been taken up, as represented\r\nby the Jerome Company, and that some of the blank-date notes had\r\nbeen made payable in twelve, eighteen and twenty-four months.\r\nFurther investigation revealed the fact that he had indorsed for\r\nthe company to the amount of over half a million dollars, and\r\nthat most of the notes had been exchanged for old Jerome Company\r\nnotes due to the banks and other creditors.\r\n\r\nBarnum simply went to work, paid every debt he owed in the world,\r\nand--failed!\r\n\r\nThe Jerome Company also failed, and in addition to absorbing\r\nBarnum's fortune, was able to pay only about fifteen per cent. of\r\nits own obligations. Of course it never removed to East\r\nBridgeport at all.\r\n\r\nThe failure was a nine-days' wonder all over the country. Never\r\nhad Barnum achieved such notoriety. As he expressed it, he was\r\ntaken to pieces, analyzed, put together again, kicked, \"pitched\r\ninto,\" tumbled about, preached to, preached about, and made to\r\nserve every purpose to which a sensation loving world could put\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBarnum declared that he could stand the abuse, the cooling of\r\nfalse friends and even the loss of fortune, but it made him\r\nfurious to read and hear the moralizings over the \"instability of\r\nill-gotten gains.\" His fortune, if made quickly, had been\r\nhonestly worked for and honorably acquired, though envious people\r\npretended not to believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. THE WHEAT AND THE CHAFF.\r\n\r\nFALSE AND TRUE FRIENDS--MEETING OF BRIDGEPORT CITIZENS--BARNUM'S\r\nLETTER--TOM THUMB'S OFFER--SHILLABER'S POEM--BARNUM'S MESSAGE TO\r\nTHE CREDITORS OF THE JEROME CLOCK COMPANY--REMOVAL TO NEW\r\nYORK--BEGINNING LIFE ANEW AT FORTY-SIX.\r\n\r\nBut while misfortune reveals a man his foes, it also shows him\r\nhis friends. Barnum was overwhelmed with offers of assistance,\r\nfunds were declared at his disposal, both for the support of his\r\nfamily and to re-establish him in business. \"Benefits\" by the\r\nscore were offered him, and there was even a proposition among\r\nleading citizens of New York to give a series of benefits.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these offers Barnum declined on his unvarying\r\nprinciple of never accepting a money favor. The following\r\ncorrespondence is taken from the New York papers of the time, and\r\nwill show the stand he took in the matter:\r\n\r\n                                 NEW YORK, June 2d, 1856.\r\n\r\nMR. P. T. BARNUM:\r\n\r\nDear Sir. The financial ruin of a man of acknowledged energy and\r\nenterprise is a public calamity. The sudden blow, therefore, that\r\nhas swept away, from a man like yourself, the accumulated wealth\r\nof years, justifies, we think, the public sympathy. The better to\r\nmanifest our sincere respect for your liberal example in\r\nprosperity, as well as exhibit our honest admiration of your\r\nfortitude under overwhelming reverses, we propose to give that\r\nsympathy a tangible expression by soliciting your acceptance of a\r\nseries of benefits for your family, the result of which may\r\npossibly secure for your wife and children a future home, or at\r\nleast rescue them from the more immediate consequences of your\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nFreeman Hunt, E.

The popular sympathy is to me far\r\nmore precious than gold, and that sympathy seems in my case to\r\nextend from my immediate neighbors, in Bridgeport, to all parts\r\nof our Union.\r\n\r\nProffers of pecuniary assistance have reached me from every\r\nquarter, not only from friends, but from entire strangers. Mr.\r\nWm. E. Burton, Miss Laura Keene, and Mr. Wm. Niblo have in the\r\nkindest manner tendered me the receipts of their theatres for one\r\nevening, Mr. Gough volunteered he proceeds of one of his\r\nattractive lectures; Mr. James Phalon generously offered me the\r\nfree use of the Academy of Music; many professional ladies and\r\ngentlemen have urged me to accept their gratuitous services. I\r\nhave, on principle, respectfully declined them all, as I beg,\r\nwith the most grateful acknowledgments (at least for the\r\npresent), to decline yours--not because a benefit, in itself, is\r\nan objectionable thing, but because I have ever made it a point\r\nto ask nothing of the public on personal grounds, and should\r\nprefer, while I can possibly avoid that contingency, to accept\r\nnothing from it without the honest conviction that I had\r\nindividually given it in return a full equivalent.\r\n\r\nWhile favored with health, I feel competent to earn an honest\r\nlivelihood for myself and family. More than this I shall\r\ncertainly never attempt with such a load of debt suspended in\r\nterrorem over me. While I earnestly thank you, therefore, for\r\nyour generous consideration, gentlemen, I trust you will\r\nappreciate my desire to live unhumiliated by a sense of\r\ndependence, and believe me, sincerely yours,\r\n                          P. T. BARNUM.\r\n\r\nTo Messrs. FREEMAN HUNT, E. K. COLLINS, and others.\r\n\r\nAnd with other offers of assistance from far and near, came the\r\nfollowing from a little gentleman who did not forget his old\r\nfriend and benefactor in the time of trial:\r\n\r\n         JONES HOTEL, PHILADELPHIA, May 12th, 1856.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BARNUM: I understand your friends, and that means\r\n\"all creation,\" intend to get up some benefits for your family.\r\nNow, my dear sir, just be good enough to remember that I belong\r\nto that mighty crowd, and I must have a finger (or at least a\r\n\"thumb\") in that pie. I am bound to appear on all such occasions\r\nin some shape, from \"Jack the Giant killer,\" Up-stairs, to the\r\ndoor-keeper down, whichever may serve you best; and there are\r\nsome feats that I can perform as well as any other man of my\r\ninches. I have just started out on my Western tour, and have my\r\ncarriage, ponies, and assistants all here, but I am ready to go\r\non to New York, bag and baggage, and remain at Mrs. Barnum's\r\nservice as long as I, in a small way, can be useful. Put me into\r\nany \"heavy\" work, if you like. Perhaps I can not lift as much as\r\nsome other folks, but just take your pencil in hand and you will\r\nsee I can draw a tremendous load. I drew two hundred tons at a\r\nsingle pull to-day, embracing two thousand persons, whom I hauled\r\nup safely and satisfactorily to all parties, at one exhibition.\r\nHoping that you will be able to fix up a lot of magnets that will\r\nattract all New York, and volunteering to sit on any part of the\r\nloadstone, I am, as ever, your little but sympathizing friend,\r\n                           GEN. TOM THUMB.\r\n\r\nAll the prominent papers published editorials and paragraphs full\r\nof sympathy for the great man's misfortune, the Saturday Evening\r\nGazette of Boston breaking out in the following poem.\r\n\r\nBARNUM REDIVIVUS.\r\n\r\nA WORD FOR BARNUM.\r\n\r\n BARNUM, your hand! Though you are \"down,\"\r\n     And see full many a frigid shoulder,\r\n Be brave, my brick, and though they frown,\r\n     Prove that misfortune makes you bolder.\r\n There's many a man that sneers, my hero,\r\n     And former praise converts to scorning,\r\n Would worship--when he fears--a Nero,\r\n     And bend \"where thrift may follow fawning.\"\r\n\r\n  You humbugged us--that we have seen,\r\n     WE GOT OUR MONEY'S WORTH, old fellow,\r\n And though you thought our MINDS were GREEN,\r\n     We never thought your HEART was YELLOW.\r\n We knew you liberal, generous, warm,\r\n     Quick to assist a falling brother,\r\n And, with such virtues, what's the harm\r\n     All memories of your faults to smother?\r\n\r\n  We had not heard the peerless Lind,\r\n     But for your spirit enterprising,\r\n You were the man to raise the wind,\r\n     And make a coup confessed surprising.\r\n You're reckoned in your native town\r\n     A friend in need, a friend in danger,\r\n You ever keep the latch-string down,\r\n     And greet with open hand the stranger.\r\n\r\n  Stiffen your upper lip. You know\r\n     Who are your friends and who your foes now;\r\n We pay for knowledge as we go;\r\n     And though you get some sturdy blows now,\r\n You've a fair field--no favors crave--\r\n     The storm once passed will find you braver--\r\n In virtue's cause long may you wave,\r\n     And on the right side, never waver.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the paper was Mr. B. P. Shillaber, better known as\r\n\"Mrs. Partington,\" and to him Barnum years later wrote to find\r\nout the author of this effusion. Mr. Shillaber replied as\r\nfollows:\r\n                             CHELSEA, April 25th, 1868.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BARNUM: The poem in question was written by A.\r\nWallace Thaxter, associate editor with Mr. Clapp and myself, on\r\nthe Gazette--since deceased, a glorious fellow--who wrote th poem\r\nfrom a sincere feeling of admiration for yourself. Mr. Clapp\r\n(Hon. W. W. Clapp) published it with his full approbation. I\r\nheard of your new trouble, in my sick chamber, where I have been\r\nall winter, with regret, and wish you as ready a release from\r\nattending difficulty as your genius has hitherto achieved under\r\nlike circumstances.\r\n                   Yours, very truly\r\n                                 B. F. SHILLABER.\r\n\r\nThe manifestations of sympathy from his fellow-citizens in\r\nBridgeport gratified Barnum more than all the rest. The Mayor\r\nheaded and more than 300 leading citizens signed a call for a\r\nmass meeting of sympathy.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed for the meeting a large assemblage crowded\r\nWashington Hall, the principal hall of the city. Many people\r\nthronged the door, unable to gain entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles B. Hubbell, President of the Pequonnock Bank, was\r\nappointed President; Messrs. Charles Foote, Cashier of the\r\nConnecticut Bank; Stephen Tomlinson, President of the Farmers'\r\nBank; Samuel F. Hurd, President of the Bridgeport City Bank,\r\nHanford Lyon, Dwight Morris, E. Ferris Bishop, A. P. Houston, and\r\nWm. H. Noble, Vice-Presidents, and Messrs. Samuel M. Chesney and\r\nJulius L. Hanover, Secretaries.\r\n\r\nMr. Dwight Morris said that they had met for the purpose of\r\nexpressing their sympathy with their former fellow-citizen, P. T.\r\nBarnum, in his pecuniary reverses. It was well known how much Mr.\r\nBarnum had done for Bridgeport. He had expended large sums to\r\nbuild up their city, had accommodated many of them with the means\r\nof securing themselves homes, and it was principally to him that\r\nthey owed their present beautiful resting-place for the dead.\r\n[Applause.] The citizens of Bridgeport hoped that his misfortunes\r\nwould soon pass away, and that he would ere long resume his\r\nposition in Bridgeport, and among the citizens of Fairfield\r\nCounty. [Prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. H. Noble read the following resolutions.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Our late neighbor and friend, P. T. Barnum, has become\r\ninvolved in financial misfortune which seems likely to be\r\nirretrievable, and to prevent his again residing in our\r\nvicinity--Resolved, That we as citizens of Bridgeport deem it an\r\nact of justice no less than a slight return for the many acts of\r\nliberality, philanthropy, and public spirit in our midst, which\r\nhave marked his prosperity, to offer him our tribute of respect\r\nand sympathy in this the hour of his trouble.\r\n\r\nResolved, That in his intercourse with us in the private and\r\nsocial relations of life, Mr. Barnum is remembered as a man of\r\nupright dealings and honorable sentiments--a kind and genial\r\nneighbor, and exemplary character, a beneficent philanthropist,\r\nand a most generous friend.\r\n\r\nResolved, That in his more extended capacity as a citizen he has\r\nenduringly associated his name with numerous objects, which\r\nremain as monuments among us, connected with the institutions of\r\nreligion, education, and commercial prosperity--with the\r\nadvancement of the mechanical, agricultural, and other useful\r\narts and sciences--with the spirit of public improvement and\r\npublic morals; and that so long as these remain to us matters of\r\ninterest, we shall never forget that he has been of them all\r\namong the foremost, most liberal, and most efficient promoters.\r\n\r\nResolved, That we hereby express to him our heartfelt sympathy in\r\nhis misfortunes, our unshaken confidence in his integrity, and\r\nour admiration of the dignified fortitude and composure with\r\nwhich he has met the reverses into which he has been dragged,\r\nthrough no fault of his own, except a too generous confidence in\r\npretended friends, and our earnest hope that he may yet return to\r\nthat wealth which he has so nobly employed and to the community\r\nhe has so signally benefited.\r\n\r\nResolved, That copies of these resolutions, signed by the\r\nPresident and other officers of this meeting, be transmitted to\r\nMr. Barnum, and also to the press of this city.\r\n\r\nMr. E. B. Goodsell said that Mr. Barnum had been the friend of\r\nthe poor, and his hospitalities had been extended to men of every\r\nState in the Union. The citizens of Bridgeport should be proud to\r\nclaim as one of their citizens P. T. Barnum. His name was written\r\nupon every charity in their city, and the temples of God bore its\r\nimpress. By a few fell strokes of an ugly pen, he has been drawn\r\ninto that whirlpool of destruction to himself and almost\r\ndestruction to many in the city. In the midst of his prosperity,\r\nwhile he was building up a city on the east side of their little\r\nharbor, he had fallen by the hand of traitors. He hoped that he\r\nmight survive his misfortunes and come back to live in their\r\nmidst. He did not expect that he could ever return with that\r\n\"pocketful of rocks\" which he used to talk so much about; but, if\r\nhe would come, he for one was ready to pledge himself that he\r\nshould never starve in the city of Bridgeport. [Loud and\r\nprolonged applause.]\r\n\r\nMr. Oakley was loudly called for. He said that he had deep regard\r\nfor Mr. Barnum in his distress. He was one of the very few people\r\nin Bridgeport who had never received any aid from Mr. Barnum, but\r\nhe was ready to join in any expression of sympathy, and saw no\r\nreason why it should not assume a material form [loud applause].\r\nHe would only allude to Mr. Barnum's unostentatious benevolence.\r\nTo one of the churches of the city Mr. Barnum gave $500--to one\r\nof their churches in which he felt no interest beyond his\r\ninterest for Bridgeport, and this was but a specimen of his\r\nmunificence. Nobody could say that Mr. Barnum had not made the\r\nbest and most benevolent use of his money [Applause]. He had been\r\nthe means of adding a large number to the population of\r\nBridgeport. He never yet had found a man who was more eminently\r\nthe friend of the poor man than P. T. Barnum [Cheers]. He had\r\nalleviated the sufferings of many a broken heart, and he had\r\naided many a young man to start in business. If Mr. Barnum had\r\nerred, it was only an error of judgment [Cheers]. He sympathized\r\nwith Mr. Barnum. He had talents which would cope with those of\r\nmost of the human race. He did not believe that there was a man\r\nin the city who had so little soul as to begrudge a tear to him\r\nin his misfortune [loud applause]. They should at least send him\r\nassurance that there were thousands of hearts in his own city\r\nwhich appreciated his noble benevolence, and loved and honored\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\nMr. Noble read the following letter from Mr. Barnum:\r\n\r\n                       \"NEW YORK, April 25th, 1856.\r\n\"DEAR SIR: I have just received a slip containing a call for a\r\npublic meeting of the citizens of Bridgeport, to sympathize with\r\nme in my trouble. It is headed by his Honor the Mayor, and is\r\nsigned by most of our prominent citizens, as well as by many more\r\nwho by hard labor earn their daily bread, and who appreciate a\r\ncalamity which at a single blow strips a man of his fortune, his\r\ndear home, and all the worldly comfort which years of diligent\r\nlabor has acquired. It is due to truth to say that I knew nothing\r\nof this movement until your letter informed me of it. In\r\nmisfortune, the true sympathy of neighbors is more consoling and\r\nprecious than anything which money can purchase. This voluntary\r\noffering of my fellow-citizens, though it thrills me with painful\r\nemotions and causes tears of gratitude, yet it imparts renewed\r\nstrength and fills my heart with thankfulness to Providence for\r\nraising up to my sight, above all this wreck, kind hearts which\r\nsoar above the sordid atmosphere of 'dirty dollars.' I can never\r\nforget this unexpected kindness from my old friends and\r\nneighbors. I trust I am not blind to my many faults and\r\nshortcomings; I, however, do feel great consolation in believing\r\nthat I never used money or position to oppress the poor or wrong\r\nmy fellowmen, and that I never turned empty away whom I had the\r\npower to assist. My poor sick wife, who needs the bracing air\r\nwhich our dear home (made beautiful by her willing hand) would\r\nnow have afforded her, is driven by the orders of her physician\r\nto a secluded spot on Long Island, where the sea-wind lends its\r\nhealthful influence, and where I have also retired for the double\r\npurpose of consoling her and recruiting my own constitution,\r\nwhich, through the excitement of the last few months, has most\r\nseriously failed me. In our quiet and humble retreat that which I\r\nmost sincerely pray for is tranquillity and contentment. I am\r\nsure that the remembrance of the kindness of my Bridgeport\r\nfriends will aid me in securing these cherished blessings. No man\r\nwho has not passed through similar scenes, can fully comprehend\r\nthe misery which has been crowded into the last few months of my\r\nlife; but I have endeavored to preserve my integrity, and I\r\nhumbly hope and believe that I am being taught humility and\r\nreliance upon Providence, which will yet afford a thousand times\r\nmore peace and true happiness than can be acquired in the dire\r\nstrife and turmoil, excitements and struggles of this\r\nmoney-worshiping age. The man who coins his brain and blood into\r\ngold, who wastes all of his time and thought upon the almighty\r\ndollar, who looks no higher than blocks of houses and tracts of\r\nlands, and whose iron chest is crammed with stocks and mortgages,\r\ntied up with his own heart-strings, may console himself with the\r\nidea of safe investments; but he misses a pleasure which I firmly\r\nbelieve this lesson was intended to secure to me, and which it\r\nwill secure, if I can fully bring my mind to realize its wisdom.\r\nI think I hear you say,\r\n\r\nWhen the devil was sick,\r\nThe devil a saint would be,\r\nBut when the devil got well,\r\nThe devil a saint was he.'\r\n\r\n\"Granted, but after all the man who looks upon the loss of money\r\nas anything compared to the loss of honor, or health, or\r\nself-respect, or friends; a man who can find no source of\r\nhappiness except in riches, is to be pitied for his blindness. I\r\ncertainly feel that the loss of money, of home and my home\r\ncomforts, is dreadful; that to be driven again to find a resting\r\nplace away from the friends that I loved, and from where I had\r\nfondly hoped I was to end my days. And when I had lavished time,\r\nmoney, and everything to make my descent to the grave placid and\r\npleasant, is indeed a severe lesson; but after all I firmly\r\nbelieve it is for the best, and though my heart may break I will\r\nnot repine. I regret, beyond expression, that any man should be a\r\nloser for having trusted to my name; it would not have been so if\r\nI had not myself been deceived. As it is, I am gratified in\r\nknowing that all my individual obligations will be met. It would\r\nhave been much better if clock creditors had accepted the best\r\noffers that it was in my power to make them. But it was not so to\r\nbe, it is now too late, and as I willingly give up all I possess,\r\nI can do no more. Wherever my future lot may be cast, I shall\r\never fondly cherish the kindness which I have always received\r\nfrom the citizens of Bridgeport. I am, my dear sir,\r\n                              \"Truly yours, P. T. BARNUM.\"\r\n\r\nThe reading of the letter excited much sensation, applause, and\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were re-read and passed unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. William Bishop said it was unusual for citizens to meet\r\ntogether to express sympathy with one who had lost his fortune.\r\nIt was very common for the people and the press to eulogize a man\r\nwhen he was beyond the reach of human sympathy. He thought it was\r\nfar better to tender a man the marks of approval while he was yet\r\nalive and could appreciate it. [Applause] For along time in this\r\ncity they were accustomed to bury their dead among the living.\r\nMr. Barnum had done more than any other man to secure to this\r\ncity the most beautiful-cemetery in Connecticut. He alone had\r\nsecured to the city what it had never had before--a public\r\nsquare. On the east side of the river he had almost completed a\r\nschool-house, a thing which could be said of no other man. [Loud\r\ncheering.] If material aid were needed, he should be proud to\r\nassist in raising it. There was one clause in the resolutions\r\nwhich he did not believe. He did not believe that \"in all\r\nprobability he could ever retrieve\" his fortune. [Prolonged\r\ncheering.]\r\n\r\nMr. J. E. Dunham made a brief but earnest speech. He hoped this\r\nmeeting would put down the sneers which were in circulation in\r\nrelation to Mr. Barnum's sincerity, by showing that those\r\nestimated him most who knew him best.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathaniel Greene and Mr. Bowles made short but effective\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was characterized throughout by the greatest\r\nenthusiasm, and adjourned with three loud cheers for Barnum.\r\n\r\nNor was sympathy all his neighbors offered him; shortly after\r\nthis meeting a number of gentlemen in Bridgeport offered him a\r\nloan of $50,000, if that sum would meet the exigency.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the magnitude of the fraud practiced upon\r\nBarnum's too confiding nature dawned upon him. Not only had his\r\nnotes been used to five times the amount stipulated, but the\r\nmoney had been applied, not to relieving the temporary\r\nembarrassment of the company, but almost entirely to the\r\nredemption of the old claims of years gone by. Barnum sent two of\r\nhis friends to New Haven to ask for a meeting of the creditors,\r\nauthorizing them to say for him in substance:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN: This is a capital practical joke! Before I negotiated\r\nwith your clock company at all, I was assured by several of you,\r\nand particularly by a representative of the bank which was the\r\nlargest creditor of the concern, that the Jerome Company was\r\neminently responsible, and that the head of the same was\r\nuncommonly pious. On the strength of such representations solely,\r\nI was induced to agree to indorse and accept paper for that\r\ncompany to the extent of $110,000--no more. That sum I am now\r\nwilling to pay for my own verdancy, with an additional sum of\r\n$40,000 for your 'cuteness, making a total of $150,000, which you\r\ncan have if you cry 'quits' with the fleeced showman and let him\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the old creditors favored this proposition; but it was\r\nfound that the indebtedness was so scattered it would be\r\nimpracticable to attempt a settlement by an unanimous compromise\r\nof the creditors.\r\n\r\nBarnum therefore turned over his Bridgeport property to\r\nConnecticut assignees, moved his family to New York, and made an\r\nassignment there of all his other property, real estate and\r\npersonal effects.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he received a letter from Philadelphia proffering\r\nthe loan of $500 in case he really was in need. The wording of\r\nthe letter made Barnum suspicious that it was a trick to\r\nascertain whether he really had any property or if he made an\r\nhonest settlement to the best of his ability. To this letter\r\nBarnum replied that he did need $500, and as he had expected the\r\nmoney never came.\r\n\r\nBut the Philadelphia banks which were holding the Jerome paper\r\nfor a higher percentage, at once acceded to the terms which Mr.\r\nBarnum had announced himself able to pay,\r\n\r\nEvery dollar which he owed on his own account he had already\r\npaid, and for the liabilities incurred by the swindle which had\r\ninvolved him he offered such a percentage which he thought his\r\nestate, when sold, would eventually pay. Mrs. Barnum also gave up\r\ncertain portions of her own property to redeem such notes as\r\ncould be secured upon these terms.\r\n\r\nThey went to live in a hired furnished house in New York, the\r\nlandlady and her family boarding with them. At forty-six Barnum\r\nfound himself once more at the foot of the ladder--beginning life\r\nanew.\r\n\r\n\"The situation is disheartening,\" he said, \"but I have\r\nexperience, energy, health, and hope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. IDLENESS WITHOUT REST.\r\n\r\nANNOYING PERSECUTIONS OF CREDITORS--SUMMER ON LONG ISLAND--THE\r\nBLACK WHALE PAYS THE BOARD BILL--THE WHEELER & WILSON COMPANY\r\nREMOVE TO EAST BRIDGEPORT--SETTING SAIL FOR ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1855 Barnum had sold the American Museum to\r\nMessrs. John Greenwood, Jr., and Henry D. Butler. They paid\r\nnearly twice as much for the collection as it had originally\r\ncost, giving notes for nearly the entire amount, securing the\r\nnotes by a chattel mortgage, and hiring the premises from Mrs.\r\nBarnum, who owned the Museum property lease, and on which, by\r\nagreement of the lessees, she realized something like $19,000 a\r\nyear. The chattel mortgage was, of course, turned over to the New\r\nYork assignees with the other property.\r\n\r\nBarnum's widespread reputation for shrewdness was, in his present\r\ndifficulties, destined to be the cause of considerable annoyance\r\nto him. Certain outside creditors who had bought clock notes at a\r\ntremendous discount, believing that Barnum's means were still\r\nample, made up their minds that they must be paid at once without\r\nwaiting for the sale of the property by assignees.\r\n\r\nThey, therefore, took what is known as \"supplementary\r\nproceedings,\" by which is meant an examination before a judge,\r\ncompelling the debtor to disclose, under oath, everything in\r\nregard to his property, his present means of living, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"Putting Barnum through a course of sprouts,\" as they expressed\r\nit, came to be a very frequent occurrence. One creditor after\r\nanother hauled him up, and the attorneys would ask the same\r\nquestions which had already been answered a dozen times.\r\n\r\nThis persistent and unnecessary annoyance created a great deal of\r\nsympathy for the man, the papers took his part, and even the\r\njudges before whom he appeared, personally sided with him,\r\nalthough they were obliged to administer the law. After a while,\r\nthe judges ruled that he need not answer any questions propounded\r\nby an attorney, if he had already answered the same question in\r\nany previous examination.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the judges lost all patience on one occasion, and\r\nsaid sharply to the examining attorney:\r\n\r\n\"This, sir, has become simply a case of persecution. Mr. Barnum\r\nhas many times answered every question that can properly be put\r\nto him, to elicit the desired information; and I think it is time\r\nto stop these examinations. I advise him not to answer one\r\ninterrogatory which he has replied to under any previous\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nOne consequential little lawyer commenced his examination in\r\nbehalf of a note-shaver, who held a thousand dollar note which he\r\nhad bought for seven hundred. After the oath had been\r\nadministered, he arranged his pen, ink, and paper, and in a loud\r\ntone of voice asked:\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was given, and the next question delivered in a\r\nlouder, more peremptory tone was:\r\n\r\n\"What is your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Attending bar,\" answered Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Attending bar!\" exclaimed the lawyer; \"attending bar! Why, I\r\nthought you were a teetotaler.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am,\" declared the witness.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, sir, you have the audacity to assert that you peddle\r\nrum all day, and drink none yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not a relevant question,\" said Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"I will appeal to his Honor the Judge if you don't answer it\r\ninstantly,\" said the lawyer, gleefully.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; I do attend bar, and yet never drink intoxicating\r\nliquors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you attend bar, and for whom?\" pursued the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"I attend the bar of this court nearly every day, for the benefit\r\nof two-penny lawyers and their greedy clients,\" replied the\r\ndisgusted Barnum.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a young lawyer who had been pushing his\r\ninquiries to a great length, said in a half-laughing tone of\r\napology:\r\n\r\n\"You see, Mr. Barnum, I am searching after the small thing; I am\r\nwilling to take even the crumbs that fall from the rich man's\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which are you, then, Lazarus or one of the dogs?\" asked Barnum,\r\nwearily.\r\n\r\n\"I guess a blood-hound would not smell out much on this trial,\"\r\nreturned the lawyer, good-naturedly, adding that he had no more\r\nquestions to ask.\r\n\r\nOn account of Mrs. Barnum's continued ill-health, the family\r\nspent the summer in a farm-house at Westhampton, Long Island. The\r\nfarm lay close to the ocean, and the place was very cool and\r\ndelightful. The respite from active life, and the annoyance\r\nattendant to his financial troubles was of the greatest benefit\r\nto Mr. Barnum, who spent the time shooting, fishing, and driving.\r\n\r\nOne morning they discovered that the waves had thrown up on the\r\nbeach a young black whale, nearly twelve feet long. The animal\r\nwas dead, but still hard and fresh, and Barnum bought it for a\r\nfew dollars from the man who claimed it by right of discovery. He\r\nsent it at once to the Museum, where it was exhibited in a huge\r\nrefrigerator for a few days, where crowds came to see it. The\r\nmanagers very properly gave Barnum a share of the profits, which\r\namounted to a sum sufficient to pay the board-bill of the family\r\nfor the entire season.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the amazed landlord, when he heard of it, \"you do\r\nbeat all for luck. Here you come and board for four months with\r\nyour family, and when the time is nearly up and you're getting\r\nready to leave, out rolls a big black whale on our beach, a thing\r\nnever heard of before in this vicinity, and you take that whale\r\nand pay your board-bill with it!\"\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to New York an unforeseen event occurred\r\nwhich Barnum realized was likely to extricate him from his\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe new city which had led him into ruin now promised to be his\r\nredemption.\r\n\r\nThe now gigantic Wheeler & Wilson Sewing-Machine Company was then\r\ndoing a comparatively small yet rapidly growing business at\r\nWatertown, Connecticut. The Terroy & Barnum clock factory was\r\nstanding idle, almost worthless, in East Bridgeport, and Wheeler\r\n& Wilson saw in the empty building, the situation, the ease of\r\ncommunication with New York, and other advantages, precisely what\r\nthey wanted, provided they could procure the premises at a rate\r\nwhich would compensate them for the expense and trouble of\r\nremoving their establishment from Watertown. The clock factory\r\nwas sold for a trifle and the wheeler & Wilson Company moved into\r\nit and speedily enlarged it.\r\n\r\nThis important occurrence gave Barnum great hope for the\r\nincreased value of the land belonging to his estate. And moreover\r\nMr. Wheeler offered him a loan of $5,000 without security, which\r\nsum Barnum accepted, and devoted it, together with Mrs. Barnum's\r\nmoney, to purchasing the East Bridgeport property at the\r\nassignees' sale and also taking up such clock notes as could be\r\npurchased at a reasonable percentage. Though this new plan did\r\neventually result in putting more money in his pocket than the\r\nJerome complication had taken out, yet the process was a slow\r\none. But Barnum concluded to let it work itself out, and\r\nmeanwhile, with the idea of doing something to help out the\r\naccumulation and even saving something to add to the amount, he\r\nmade up his mind to go to Europe again.\r\n\r\nHe set sail in 1857, taking with him Tom Thumb and little\r\nCordelia Howard, who had attained celebrity for her artistic\r\nrendering of juvenile characters,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. A PROSPEROUS EXILE.\r\n\r\nHIS SUCCESSFUL PUPIL--MAKING MANY FRIENDS IN LONDON--ACQUAINTANCE\r\nWITH THACKERAY--A COMEDY OF ERRORS IN A GERMAN CUSTOM\r\nHOUSE--ARISTOCRATIC PATRONAGE AT FASHIONABLE RESORTS--BARNUM'S\r\nIMPRESSIONS OF HOLLAND AND THE DUTCH.\r\n\r\nYears ago Barnum had known Albert Smith in London as a dentist,\r\nliterary \"hack,\" occasional writer for Punch and various\r\nmagazines, etc., not achieving notable success in any of these\r\nundertakings. He now found him the most eminent and successful\r\nshowman in the city, occupying Barnum's old quarters in Egyptian\r\nHall. The chief attraction of his show was a panorama of Mont\r\nBlanc, accompanying which he gave a lecture, descriptive of the\r\nmountain and relating his own experiences in climbing it. When\r\nBarnum called upon him he found him just as unassuming and\r\ncordial as ever; he was forthwith entered on the free list at all\r\nof Smith's entertainments, and the two often dined together at\r\nthe Garrick Club.\r\n\r\nThe first time Barnum attended Smith's exhibition, the latter\r\ngave him a sly wink from the stage at the moment of his\r\ndescribing a scene in the golden chamber of St. Ursula's church\r\nin Cologne, where the old sexton narrating the story of the ashes\r\nand bones to the eleven thousand innocent virgins, who, according\r\nto tradition, were sacrificed on a certain occasion. One of the\r\ncharacters whom he pretended to have met several times on his\r\ntrip to Mont Blanc, was a Yankee, whom he named \"Phineas\r\nCutecraft.\" The wink came at the time he introduced Phineas in\r\nthe Cologne church, and made him say at the end of the sexton's\r\nstory about the virgins' bones:\r\n\r\n\"Old fellow, what will you take for that hull lot of bones? I\r\nwant them for my museum in America!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the question had been interpreted to the old German, he\r\nexclaimed in horror, according to Albert Smith:\r\n\r\n\"Mine Gott! it is impossible! We will never sell the virgins'\r\nbones!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" replied Phineas Cutecraft, \"I'll send another lot\r\nof bones to my museum, swear mine are the real bones of the\r\nVirgins of Cologne, and burst up your show!\"\r\n\r\nThis always excited the heartiest laughter; but Mr. Smith knew\r\nvery well that Barnum would at once recognize it as a paraphrase\r\nof the scene wherein they, too, had figured in 1844, at the\r\nporter's lodge of Warwick Castle. \"In the course of the\r\nentertainment,\" says Barnum, \"I found he had woven in numerous\r\nanecdotes I had told him at that time, and many incidents of our\r\nexcursion were also travestied and made to contribute to the\r\ninterest of his description of the ascent of Mont Blanc.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they dined together at the club that day, Smith introduced\r\nBarnum to several of his acquaintances as his teacher in the show\r\nbusiness. He also remarked to Barnum that he must have recognized\r\nas old friends many of the incidents and jokes in the lecture.\r\nBarnum replied that he did. \"Well,\" said Smith, \"of course you as\r\na showman, know very well that, to win popular success. we have\r\nto appropriate and adapt to our uses everything of the sort that\r\nwe can get hold of.\"\r\n\r\nBy thus engrafting his various experiences upon this Mont Blanc\r\nentertainment, Albert Smith succeeded in serving up a salmagundi\r\nfeast which was relished alike by royal and less distinguished\r\npalates.\r\n\r\nWhen William Makepeace Thackeray first visited this country, he\r\nbrought a letter of introduction to Barnum, from Albert Smith,\r\nand called on the showman at his New York museum. He spent an\r\nhour or more there, asking much advice of Barnum in regard to the\r\nmanagement of the course of lectures on \"The English Humorists of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century,\" which he proposed to deliver, as he did\r\nafterwards, with very great success, in the principal cities of\r\nthe Union. Barnum gave him the best advice he could as to\r\nmanagement, and the cities he ought to visit, for which he was\r\nvery grateful, and he called on Barnum whenever he was in New\r\nYork. Barnum also saw him repeatedly when he came to America the\r\nsecond time with his lectures on \"The Four Georges,\" which, it\r\nwill be remembered, he delivered in the United States in the\r\nseason of 1855-56, before he read them to audiences in Great\r\nBritain. Barnum's relations with this great novelist were cordial\r\nand intimate; and now, when he called upon him, in 1857, at his\r\nown house, Thackeray grasped him heartily by the hand, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum, I admire you more than ever I have read the accounts\r\nin the papers of the examinations you underwent in New York\r\ncourts; and the positive pluck you exhibit under your pecuniary\r\nembarrassments is worthy of all praise. You would never have\r\nreceived credit for the philosophy you manifest if these\r\nfinancial misfortunes had not overtaken you.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum thanked him for his compliment, and he continued:\r\n\r\n\"But tell me, Barnum, are you really in need of present\r\nassistance? For if you are you must be helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" the showman replied, laughing \"I need more\r\nmoney in order to get out of bankruptcy, and I intend to earn it;\r\nbut so far as daily bread is concerned, I am quite at ease, for\r\nmy wife is worth L30,000 or L40,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible!??\" he exclaimed, with evident delight; \"well,\r\nnow, you have lost all my sympathy; why, that is more than I ever\r\nexpect to be worth; I shall be sorry for you no more.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in London, Barnum met Thackeray several times,\r\nand on one occasion dined with him. He repeatedly expressed his\r\nobligations to Barnum for the advice and assistance he had given\r\nhim on the occasion of his first lecturing visit to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSoon after Barnum arrived in London he was visited by Mr. Otto\r\nGoldschmidt, who had married Jenny Lind. They were then living in\r\nDresden, but Madame Goldschmidt had insisted on his hurrying over\r\nto England to see her old manager, and ascertain whether he\r\nreally was in want. Barnum assured him that he was getting on\r\ncomfortably, though he had to exercise economy, and that his\r\nfamily would presently come over and live with him in London.\r\nGoldschmidt urged him to come to Dresden to live. \"It is much\r\ncheaper living there,\" he said, \"and my wife will be so glad to\r\nfind a suitable house for you.\" But Barnum declined the offer.\r\nHis business prospects would be better in London than in Dresden.\r\n\r\nBarnum's old friends, Julius Benedict and Signor Belletti, also\r\ncalled on him frequently, and made him feel much at home. Among\r\nothers whom he met in London, some of them quite frequently at\r\ndinners, were Mr. George Augustus Sala, Mr. Edmund Yates, Mr.\r\nHorace Mayhew, Mr. Alfred Bunn, Mr Lumley, of Her Majesty's\r\nTheatre; Mr. Buckstone; of the Haymarket; Mr. Charles Kean, our\r\nprincely countryman; Mr. George Peabody, Mr. J. M. Morris, the\r\nmanager, Mr. Bates, of Baring Brothers & Co.; Mr. Oxenford,\r\ndramatic critic of the London Times, Dr. Ballard, the American\r\ndentist, and many other eminent persons.\r\n\r\nHe had numerous offers from professional friends on both sides of\r\nthe Atlantic, who supposed him to be in need of employment. Mr.\r\nBarney Williams, who had not then acted in England, proposed, in\r\nthe kindest manner, to make him his agent for a tour through\r\nGreat Britain, and to give him one-third of the profits which he\r\nand Mrs. Williams might make by their acting. Mr. Pettengill, of\r\nNew York, the newspaper advertising agent, offered him the fine\r\nsalary of $10,000 a year to transact business for him in Great\r\nBritain. He wrote: \"When you failed in consequence of the Jerome\r\nclock notes, I felt that your creditors were dealing hard with\r\nyou; that they should have let you up and give you a chance, and\r\nthey would have fared better, and I wish I was a creditor, so as\r\nto show what I would do.\" These offers, both from Mr. Williams\r\nand Mr. Pettengill, Barnum felt obliged to decline.\r\n\r\nMr. Lumley, manager of Her Majesty's Theatre, used to send him an\r\norder for a private box for every opera night, and Barnum\r\nfrequently availed himself of his courtesy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the showman was by no means idle. Cordelia Howard as\r\n\"Little Eva,\" with her mother as the inimitable \"Topsy,\" were\r\nhighly successful in London and other large cities, while General\r\nTom Thumb, returning after so long an absence, drew crowded\r\nhouses wherever he went. These were strong spokes in the wheel\r\nthat was moving slowly but surely in the effort to get Barnum out\r\nof debt, and, if possible, to save some portion of his real\r\nestate. Of course, it was not generally known that he had any\r\ninterest whatever in either of these exhibitions; if it had been,\r\npossibly some of the clock creditors would have annoyed him; but\r\nhe busied himself in these and in other ways, working\r\nindustriously and making much money, which he constantly remitted\r\nto his trusty agent at home.\r\n\r\nBarnum spent some weeks in London and then went to Germany. He\r\nwas accompanied by Tom Thumb, and they went by the way of Paris,\r\nStrasburg, and Baden-Baden. At the frontier they had a terrible\r\ntime with the thick-headed customs-inspector. This was at Kehl,\r\nnear Strasburg. \"I knew,\" said Barnum in telling the story, \"that\r\nI had no baggage which was rightfully subject to duty, as I had\r\nnothing but my necessary clothing, and the package of placards\r\nand lithographs, illustrating the General's exhibitions. As the\r\nofficial was examining my trunks, I assured him in French, that I\r\nhad nothing subject to duty; but he made no reply and\r\ndeliberately handled every article in my luggage. He then cut the\r\nstrings to the large packages of show-bills. I asked him in\r\nFrench, whether he understood that language. He gave a grunt,\r\nwhich was the only audible sound I could get out of him, and then\r\nlaid my show-bills and lithographs on his scales as if to weigh\r\nthem. I was much excited. An English gentleman, who spoke German,\r\nkindly offered to act as my interpreter.\r\n\r\n\" 'Please to tell him,' said I, 'that those bills and lithographs\r\nare not articles of commerce; that they are simply\r\nadvertisements.'\r\n\r\n\"My English friend did as I requested; but it was of no use; the\r\ncustom-house officer kept piling them upon his scales. I grew\r\nmore excited.\r\n\r\n\" 'Please tell him I give them away,' I said. The translation of\r\nmy assertion into German did not help me; a double grunt from the\r\nfunctionary, was the only response. Tom Thumb, meanwhile, jumped\r\nabout like a little monkey, for he was fairly delighted at my\r\nworry and perplexity. Finally, I said to my new found English\r\nfriend: 'Be good enough to tell the officer to keep the bills if\r\nhe wants them, and that I will not pay duty on them, any how.'\r\n\r\n\"He was duly informed of my determination, but he was immovable.\r\nHe lighted his huge Dutch pipe, got the exact weight, and,\r\nmarking it down, handed it to a clerk, who copied it on his book,\r\nand solemnly passed it over to another clerk, who copied it on\r\nstill another book; a third clerk then took it, and copied it on\r\nto a printed bill, the size of a half letter sheet, which was\r\nduly stamped in red ink with several official devices. By this\r\ntime I was in a profuse perspiration; and, as the document passed\r\nfrom clerk to clerk, I told them they need not trouble themselves\r\nto make out a bill, for I would not pay it; they would get no\r\nduty and they might keep the property.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, I could not spare the placards for any length of\r\ntime, for they were exceedingly valuable to me as advertisements,\r\nand I could not easily have duplicated them in Germany; but I was\r\ndetermined that I would not pay duties on articles which were not\r\nmerchandise. Every transfer, therefore, of the bill to a new\r\nclerk, gave me a fresh twinge, for I imagined that every clerk\r\nadded more charges, and that every charge was a tighter turn to\r\nthe vise which held my fingers. Finally, the last clerk defiantly\r\nthrust in my face the terrible official document, on which were\r\nscrawled certain cabalistic characters, signifying the amount of\r\nmoney I should be forced to pay to the German government before I\r\ncould have my property. I would not touch it but resolved I would\r\nreally leave my packages until I could communicate with one of\r\nour consuls in Germany, and I said as much to the English\r\ngentleman who had kindly interpreted for me.\r\n\r\n\"He took the bill, and, examining it, burst into a loud laugh,\r\n'Why, it is but fifteen kreutzers!' he said.\r\n\r\n\" 'How much is that?' I asked, feeling for the golden sovereigns\r\nin my pocket.\r\n\r\n\" 'Sixpence!' was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I was astonished and delighted, and, as I handed out the money,\r\nI begged him to tell the officials that the custom-house charge\r\nwould not pay the cost of the paper on which it was written. But\r\nthis was a very fair illustration of sundry red-tape dealings in\r\nother countries as well as in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nBaden-Baden was found to be an uncommonly pleasant place, the\r\nneatest and cleanest little city he had ever seen, Barnum\r\nthought. As soon as they were fairly settled there, Tom Thumb\r\nbegan driving out on the streets in his tiny carriage, with his\r\nponies and liveried coachmen and footmen. Public curiosity was\r\ngreatly excited. The place was thronged with visitors, it being\r\none of the most popular resorts in Europe. There were kings and\r\nqueens, and minor royalties and members of the nobility without\r\nnumber. All these soon forgot their other amusements and\r\nentertainments in their interest in the little General. They\r\ncrowded his rooms at his reception every day, and Barnum, seeing\r\nthe quality of his patrons, put the entrance fee higher than it\r\never was at any other place. Their stay at this resort was\r\nexceedingly profitable.\r\n\r\nThence they proceeded to the other German watering places, such\r\nas Ems, Weisbaden and Hamburg. They saw that it paid to strike\r\nfor high game. No matter how high their fee, the crowned, titled,\r\nrich, aristocratic throng came to their show by thousands. Among\r\nthem was the King of Holland, who was particularly interested in\r\nTom Thumb. So profitable was the tour, that Barnum was able to\r\nsend many thousands of dollars to his agents in America, to buy\r\nback his real estate and settle up the remains of the disastrous\r\nclock business.\r\n\r\nOther German cities visited were Frankfort-on-the-Main, Mayence\r\nand Cologne. At the latter place, they remained for some time,\r\nseeing as well as giving shows. Then they went on to Rotterdam\r\nand Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThe shrewd and enterprising Yankee was much impressed by the\r\nthrift and industry of Holland. \"It gave me,\" he afterwards said,\r\n\"more genuine satisfaction than any other foreign country I have\r\never visited, if I except Great Britain. Redeemed as a large\r\nportion of the whole surface of the land has been from the bottom\r\nof the sea, by the wonderful dykes, which are monuments of the\r\nindustry of whole generations of human beavers, Holland seems to\r\nme the most curious, as well as interesting country in the world.\r\nThe people, too, with their quaint costumes, their extraordinary\r\ncleanliness, their thrift, industry and frugality, pleased me\r\nvery much. It is the universal testimony of all travellers, that\r\nthe Hollanders are the neatest and most economical people among\r\nall nations. So far as cleanliness is concerned, in Holland it is\r\nevidently not next to, but far ahead of godliness. It is rare,\r\nindeed, to meet a ragged, dirty, or drunken person. The people\r\nare very temperate and economical in their habits; and even the\r\nvery rich--and there is a vast amount of wealth in the\r\ncountry--live with great frugality, though all of the people live\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\"As for the scenery, I cannot say much for it, since it is only\r\ndiversified by thousands of windmills, which are made to do all\r\nkinds of work, from grinding grain to pumping water from the\r\ninside of the dykes back to the sea again. As I exhibited the\r\nGeneral only in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and to no great profit\r\nin either city, we spent most of our time in rambling about to\r\nsee what was to be seen. In the country villages it seemed as if\r\nevery house was scrubbed twice and whitewashed once every day in\r\nthe week, excepting Sunday. Some places were almost painfully\r\npure, and I was in one village where horses and cattle were not\r\nallowed to go through the streets and no one was permitted to\r\nwear their boots or shoes in the houses. There is a general and\r\nconstant exercise of brooms, pails, floor-brushes and mops all\r\nover Holland, and in some places, even, this kind of thing is\r\ncarried so far, I am told, that the only trees set out are\r\nscrub-oaks.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum thought that the reason why his exhibitions were not\r\nbetter patronized here was that the people were too frugal to\r\nspend much money for mere amusements. \"But they and their habits\r\nand ways afforded us so much amusement, that we were quite\r\nwilling they should give our entertainment the 'go by,' as they\r\ngenerally did. We were in Amsterdam at the season of 'Kremis,' or\r\nthe annual fair, which is held in all the principal towns, and\r\nwhere shows of all descriptions are open, at prices for admission\r\nranging from one to five pennies, and are attended by nearly the\r\nwhole population. For the people generally, this one great\r\nholiday seems all-sufficient for the whole year. I went through\r\nscores of booths, where curiosities and monstrosities of all\r\nkinds were exhibited, and was able to make some purchases and\r\nengagements for the American Museum. Among these was the Albino\r\nfamily, consisting of a man, his wife, and son, who were by far\r\nthe most interesting and attractive specimens of their class I\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"We visited the Hague, the capital and the finest city in\r\nHolland. It is handsomely and regularly laid out, and contains a\r\nbeautiful theatre, a public picture gallery, which contains some\r\nof the best works of Vandyke, Paul Potter, and other Dutch\r\nmasters, while the museum is especially rich in rarities from\r\nChina and Japan. When we arrived at the Hague, Mr. August\r\nBelmont, who had been the United States Minister at that court,\r\nhad just gone home, but I heard many encomiums passed upon him\r\nand his family, and I was told some pretty good stories of his\r\nfamiliarity with the king, and of the 'jolly times' these two\r\npersonages frequently enjoyed together. I did not miss visiting\r\nthe great government museum, as I wished particularly to see the\r\nrich collection of Japan ware and arms, made during the many\r\nyears when the Dutch carried on almost exclusively the entire\r\nforeign trade with the Japanese. I spent several days in minutely\r\nexamining these curious manufactures of a people who were then\r\nalmost as little known to nations generally as are the\r\ninhabitants of the planet Jupiter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first day of his visits to this museum, Barnum stood for\r\nan hour before a large case containing a most unique and\r\nextraordinary collection of fabulous animals, made from paper and\r\nother materials, and looking as natural and genuine as the\r\nstuffed skins of any animals in the American Museum. There were\r\nserpents two yards long, with a head and a pair of feet at each\r\nend; frogs as large as a man, with human hands and feet; turtles\r\nwith three heads; monkeys with two heads and six legs; scores of\r\nequally curious monstrosities; and at least two dozen mermaids,\r\nof all sorts and sizes. Looking at these \"sirens\" he easily\r\ndivined from whence the Feejee mermaid originated.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful visit in Holland, he went back to England; and\r\nproceeding to Manchester, opened his exhibition. For several days\r\nthe hall was crowded to overflowing at each of the three, and\r\nsometimes four, entertainments they gave every day. By this time,\r\nhis wife and two youngest daughters had come over to London, and\r\nhe hired furnished lodgings in the suburbs where they could live\r\nwithin the strictest limits of economy. It was necessary now for\r\nhim to return for a few weeks to America, to assist personally in\r\nforwarding a settlement of the clock difficulties. So leaving the\r\nlittle General in the hands of trusty and competent agents to\r\ncarry on the exhibitions in his absence, he set his face once\r\nmore towards home and the west, and took steamer at Liverpool for\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. HOME AGAIN.\r\n\r\nJOLLY VOYAGE--MOCK TRIALS ON SHIPBOARD--BARNUM ON TRIAL FOR HIS\r\nLIFE--DISCOMFITED WITNESSES AND A TRIUMPHANT PRISONER--FAIR\r\nWEATHER FRIENDS--THE BURNING OF IRANISTAN\r\n\r\nBarnum made in his life many voyages across the Atlantic, but\r\nnone, perhaps, pleasanter than this. On every such trip he got\r\nunder rest and relief from his multitudinous business cares and\r\narduous labors; and he always contrived to organize plenty of\r\nmerry-making among his fellow-passengers. On this occasion he\r\nfelt in uncommonly good spirits because he was so rapidly\r\nretrieving his well-nigh fallen fortunes. The feature of the\r\nvoyage was a series of mock trials, in which a judge was\r\nselected, jurymen drawn, prisoners arraigned, counsel employed,\r\nand all the formalities of a court established. \"I have the\r\nvanity to think,\" said he, afterwards, in telling in his own\r\ninimitable way the story of this voyage, \"that if my good fortune\r\nhad directed me to that profession, I should have made a very\r\nfair lawyer for I have always had a great fondness for debate and\r\nespecially for the cross-examination of witnesses, unless that\r\nwitness was P. T. Barnum in examination under supplementary\r\nproceedings at the instance of some note shaver, who had bought a\r\nclock note at a discount of thirty-six per cent. In this mock\r\ncourt, I was unanimously chosen as prosecuting attorney, and, as\r\nthe court was established expressly to convict, I had no\r\ndifficulty in carrying the jury and securing the punishment of\r\nthe prisoner. A small fine was generally imposed, and the fund\r\nthus collected was given to a poor sailor boy who had fallen from\r\nthe mast and broken his leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"After several of these trials had been held, a dozen or more of\r\nthe passengers secretly put their heads together and resolved to\r\nplace the 'showman' on trial for his life. An indictment,\r\ncovering twenty pages, was drawn up by several legal gentlemen\r\namong the passengers, charging him with being the Prince of\r\nHumbugs, and enumerating a dozen special counts, containing\r\ncharges of the most absurd and ridiculous description. Witnesses\r\nwere then brought together, and privately instructed what to say\r\nand do. Two or three days were devoted to arranging this mighty\r\nprosecution, 'When everything was ready, I was arrested, and the\r\nformidable indictment read to me. I saw at a glance that time and\r\ntalent had been brought into requisition, and that my trial was\r\nto be more elaborate than any that had preceded it. I asked for\r\nhalf an hour to prepare for my defense, which was granted.\r\nMeanwhile, seats were arranged to accommodate the court and\r\nspectators, and extra settees were placed for the ladies on the\r\nupper deck, where they could look down, see and hear all that\r\ntranspired. Curiosity was on tip-toe, for it was evident that\r\nthis was to be a long, exciting and laughable trial. At the end\r\nof half an hour the judge was on the bench the jury had taken\r\ntheir places; the witnesses were ready; the counsel for the\r\nprosecution, four in number, with pens, ink, and paper in\r\nprofusion, were seated, and everything seemed ready. I was\r\nbrought in by a special constable, the indictment read, and I was\r\nasked to plead guilty, or not guilty. I rose and In a most solemn\r\nmanner, stated that I could not conscientiously plead guilty or\r\nnot guilty; that I had, in fact, committed many of the acts\r\ncharged in the indictment, but these acts, I was ready to show,\r\nwere not criminal, but on the contrary, worthy of praise. My plea\r\nwas received and the first witness called.\r\n\r\n\"He testified to having visited the prisoner's museum, and of\r\nbeing humbugged by the Feejee mermaid; the nurse of Washington;\r\nand by other curiosities, natural and unnatural. The questions\r\nand answers having been all arranged in advance, everything\r\nworked smoothly. Acting as my own counsel, I cross-examined the\r\nwitness by simply asking whether he saw anything else in the\r\nmuseum besides what he had mentioned.\r\n\r\n\" 'Oh! yes, I saw thousands of other things.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Were they curious?'\r\n\r\n\" 'Certainly; many of them very astonishing.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Did you ever witness a dramatic representation in the museum?'\r\n\r\n\" 'Yes, sir, a very good one.'\r\n\r\n\" 'What did you pay for all this?'\r\n\r\n\" 'Twenty-five cents.'\r\n\r\n\" 'That will do, sir; you can step down.'\r\n\r\n\"A second, third and fourth witness were called, and the\r\nexamination was similar to the foregoing. Another witness then\r\nappeared to testify in regard to another count in the indictment.\r\nHe stated that for several weeks he was the guest of the\r\nprisoner, at his country residence Iranistan and he gave a most\r\namusing description of the various schemes and contrivances which\r\nwere there originated for the purpose of being carried out at\r\nsome future day in the museum.\r\n\r\n\" 'How did you live there?' asked one of the counsel for the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n\" 'Very well, indeed, in the daytime,' was the reply; 'plenty of\r\nthe best to eat and drink except liquors. In bed, however, it was\r\nimpossible to sleep. I rose the first night, struck a light, and\r\non examination found myself covered with myriads of tattle bugs,\r\nso small as to be almost imperceptible. By using my microscope I\r\ndiscovered them to be infantile bedbugs. After the first night I\r\nwas obliged to sleep in the coach-house in order to escape this\r\nannoyance.'\r\n\r\n\"Of course this elicited much mirth. The first question put on\r\nthe cross-examination was this:\r\n\r\n\" 'Are you a naturalist, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"The witness hesitated. In all the drilling that had taken place\r\nbefore the trial, neither the counsel nor witnesses had thought\r\nof what questions might come up in the cross-examination, and\r\nnow, not seeing the drift of the question, the witness seemed a\r\nlittle bewildered, and the counsel for the prosecution looked\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n\"The question was repeated with some emphasis.\r\n\r\n\" 'No, sir,' replied the witness, hesitatingly, 'I am not a\r\nnaturalist.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Then, sir, not being a naturalist, dare you affirm that those\r\nmicroscopic insects were not humbugs instead of bedbugs'--(here\r\nthe prisoner was interrupted by a universal shout of laughter, in\r\nwhich the solemn judge himself joined)--land if they were\r\nhumbugs, I suppose that even the learned counsel opposed to me\r\nwill not claim that they were out of place.\r\n\r\n\" 'They may have been humbugs,' replied the witness.\r\n\r\n\" 'That will do, sir; you may go,' said I; and at the same time,\r\nturning to the array of counsel, I remarked, with a smile, 'You\r\nhad better have a naturalist for your next witness, gentlemen.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Don't be alarmed, sir, we have got one, and we will now\r\nintroduce him,' replied the counsel.\r\n\r\n\"The next witness testified that he was a planter from Georgia,\r\nthat some years since the prisoner visited his plantation with a\r\nshow, and that while there he discovered an old worthless donkey\r\nbelonging to the planter, and bought him for five dollars. The\r\nnext year the witness visited Iranistan, the country seat of the\r\nprisoner, and, while walking about the grounds, his old donkey,\r\nrecognizing his former master, brayed; 'whereupon,' continued the\r\nwitness, 'I walked up to the animal and found that two men were\r\nengaged in sticking wool upon him, and this animal was afterwards\r\nexhibited by the prisoner as the woolly horse.'\r\n\r\n\"The whole court--spectators, and even the 'prisoner'\r\nhimself--were convulsed with laughter at the gravity with which\r\nthe planter gave his very ludicrous testimony.\r\n\r\n\" 'What evidence have you,' I inquired, 'that this was the same\r\ndonkey which you sold to me?'\r\n\r\n\" 'The fact that the animal recognized me, as was evident from\r\nhis braying as soon as he saw me.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Are you a naturalist, sir?'\r\n\r\n\" 'Yes, I am,' replied the planter, with firm emphasis, as much\r\nas to say, you can't catch me as you did the other witness.\r\n\r\n\" 'Oh! you are a naturalist, are you? Then, sir, I ask you, as a\r\nnaturalist, do you not know it to be a fact in natural history\r\nthat one jackass always brays as soon as he sees another?'\r\n\r\n\"This question was received with shouts of laughter, in the midst\r\nof which the nonplussed witness backed out of court, and all the\r\nefforts of special constables, and even the high sheriff himself,\r\nwere unavailing in getting him again on the witness stand.\r\n\r\n\"This trial lasted two days, to the great delight of all on\r\nboard. After my success with the 'naturalist,' not one-half of\r\nthe witnesses would appear against me. In my final argument I\r\nsifted the testimony, analyzed its bearings, ruffled the learned\r\ncounsel, disconcerted the witnesses, flattered the judge and\r\njury, and when the judge had delivered his charge, the jury\r\nacquitted me without leaving their seats. The judge received the\r\nverdict, and then announced that he should fine the naturalist\r\nfor the mistake he made, as to the cause of the donkey's braying,\r\nand he should also fine the several witnesses, who, through fear\r\nof the cross-fire, had refused to testify.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial afforded a pleasant topic of conversation for the rest\r\nof the voyage; and the morning before arriving in port, a vote of\r\nthanks was passed to Barnum, in consideration of the amusement he\r\nhad intentionally and unintentionally furnished to the passengers\r\nduring the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe treatment to which Barnum was subjected on his arrival in New\r\nYork, was in strange and discreditable contrast to that which he\r\nhad enjoyed abroad. He sometimes spoke of it in later life,\r\nthough without any bitterness. He was too much of a philosopher\r\nto take it to heart. \"After my arrival,\" he would say, \"often, in\r\npassing up and down Broadway, I saw old and prosperous friends\r\ncoming, but before I came anywhere near them, if they espied me,\r\nthey would dodge into a store, or across the street, or\r\nopportunely meet some one with whom they had pressing business,\r\nor they would be very much interested in something that was going\r\non over the way, or on top of the City Hall. I was delighted at\r\nthis, for it gave me at once a new sensation and a new\r\nexperience. 'Ah, ha!' I said to myself, 'my butterfly friends, I\r\nknow you now; and, what is more to the point, if ever I get out\r\nof this bewilderment of broken clock-wheels, I shall not forget\r\nyou;' and I heartily thanked the old clock concern for giving me\r\nthe opportunity to learn this sad but most needful lesson. I had\r\na very few of the same sort of experiences in Bridgeport, and\r\nthey proved valuable to me.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Barnum's assignees was his neighbor and quondam\r\n\"gamekeeper,\" Mr. Johnson, and he it was who had written to\r\nBarnum to return to America, to facilitate the settlement of his\r\naffairs. He now told him that there was no probability of\r\ndisposing of Iranistan at present, and that therefore he might as\r\nwell move back into his old home. That was August. In September,\r\nBarnum's family followed him to America, and they decided to take\r\nMr. Johnson's advice and re-occupy Iranistan. They went to\r\nBridgeport, to superintend arrangements, and there Barnum's\r\nsecond daughter, Helen, was married to Mr. S. W. Hurd, on October\r\n20, 1857.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Iranistan, which had been closed and unoccupied for\r\nmore than two years, was once more opened to the carpenters and\r\npainters whom Mr. Johnson sent there to put the house in order.\r\nHe agreed with Barnum that it was best to keep the property as\r\nlong as possible, and in the interval, till a purchaser for the\r\nestate appeared, or till it was forced to auction, to take up the\r\nclock notes, whenever they were offered. The workmen who were\r\nemployed in the house were specially instructed not to smoke\r\nthere, but nevertheless, it was subsequently discovered that some\r\nof the men were in the habit occasionally of going into the main\r\ndome to eat their dinners which they brought with them, and that\r\nthey stayed there awhile after dinner to smoke their pipes. In\r\nall probability, one of these lighted pipes was left on the\r\ncushion which covered the circular seat in the dome and ignited\r\nthe tow with which the cushion was stuffed. It may have been days\r\nand even weeks before this smouldering tow fire burst into flame.\r\n\r\nBarnum was staying at the Astor House, in New York, when, on the\r\nmorning of December 18, 1857, he received a telegram from his\r\nbrother, Philo F. Barnum, dated at Bridgeport, and informing him\r\nthat Iranistan was burned to the ground that morning. The alarm\r\nwas given at eleven o'clock on the night of the 17th, and the\r\nfire burned till one o'clock on the morning of the 18th.\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, a considerable loss to Barnum's estate, for\r\nthe house had cost about $150,000. It was also generally regarded\r\nas a public calamity. This house had been the only building in\r\nits peculiar style of architecture of any pretension in America,\r\nand many persons had visited Bridgeport every year expressly to\r\nsee it. The insurance on the mansion had usually been about\r\n$62,000, but Barnum had let some of the policies expire without\r\nrenewing them, so that at the time of the fire there was only\r\n$28,000 insurance on the property. Most of the furniture and\r\npictures were saved, generally in a damaged state.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the assignees sold the grounds and outhouses of\r\nIranistan to Elias Howe, Jr., the inventor of the sewing-machine.\r\nThe property brought $50,000, which, with the $28,000 insurance\r\nwent into Barnum's assets to satisfy clock creditors. It was Mr.\r\nHowe's intention to erect a splendid mansion on the estate, but\r\nhis untimely and lamented death prevented the fulfilment of the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE ART OF MONEY GETTING.\r\n\r\nTHE LECTURE FIELD--SUCCESS--CAMBRIDGE--OXFORD--AN UNIQUE\r\nENTERTAINMENT--BARNUM EQUAL TO THE OCCASION--INVITED TO STAY A\r\nWEEK.\r\n\r\nSeeing the necessity of making more money to assist in\r\nextricating his affairs from financial disorder, Barnum went back\r\nto England, taking with him Tom Thumb, whom he exhibited in all\r\nthe principal places of England, Scotland and Wales; this was\r\nearly in 1858.\r\n\r\nThe tour was a profitable one, and the money, as fast as it came\r\nin, was remitted to his agents and assignees in America.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of some of his American friends In London,\r\nBarnum next appeared on the lecture platform. The subject chosen\r\nwas \"The Art of Money Getting,\" although Barnum told his friends\r\nthat in the light of recent events he felt more competent to\r\nspeak on the art of money losing. But they assured him that his\r\nname having been associated with the Jenny Lind concerts and\r\nother great money-making enterprises, the lecture would\r\nundoubtedly prove both attractive and profitable.\r\n\r\nThe lecture was widely advertised, of course, and at the\r\nappointed time the great St. James' Hall, Regent Street,\r\nPiccadilly, was completely filled. It was the evening of December\r\n29, 1858. We subjoin extracts from the lecture, which was closely\r\nlistened to and well received by many more audiences than the one\r\nwhich heard it first at St. James' Hall.\r\n\r\nThose who really desire to attain an independence, have only to\r\nset their minds upon it, and adopt the proper means, as they do\r\nin regard to any other object which they wish to accomplish, and\r\nthe thing is easily done. But however easy it may be found to\r\nmake money, I have no doubt many of my hearers will agree it is\r\nthe most difficult thing in the world to keep it. The road to\r\nwealth is, as Dr. Franklin truly says, \"as plain as the road to\r\nmill.\" It consists simply in expending less than we earn; that\r\nseems to be a very simple problem. Mr. Micawber, one of those\r\nhappy creations of the genial Dickens, puts the case in a strong\r\nlight when he says that to have an income of twenty pounds per\r\nannum, and spend twenty pounds and sixpence, is to be the most\r\nmiserable of men; whereas, to have an income of only twenty\r\npounds, and spend but nineteen pounds and sixpence, is to be the\r\nhappiest of mortals. Many of my hearers may say, \"we understand\r\nthis; this is economy, and we know economy is wealth; we know we\r\ncan't eat our cake and keep it also.\" Yet I beg to say that\r\nperhaps more cases of failure arise from mistakes on this point\r\nthan almost any other. The fact is, many people think they\r\nunderstand economy when they really do not.\r\n\r\nTrue economy is misapprehended, and people go through life\r\nwithout properly comprehending what that principle is. One says,\r\n\"I have an income of so much, and here is my neighbor who has the\r\nsame; yet every year he gets something ahead and I fall short;\r\nwhy is it? I know all about economy.\" He thinks he does, but he\r\ndoes not. There are many who think that economy consists in\r\nsaving cheese-parings and candle-ends, in cutting off twopence\r\nfrom the laundress' bill and doing all sorts of little mean,\r\ndirty things. Economy is not meanness. The misfortune is, also,\r\nthat this class of persons let their economy apply in only one\r\ndirection. They fancy they are so wonderfully economical in\r\nsaving a half-penny where they ought to spend twopence, that they\r\nthink they can afford to squander in other directions. A few\r\nyears ago, before kerosene oil was discovered or thought of, one\r\nmight stop over night at almost any farmer's house in the\r\nagricultural districts and get a very good supper, but after\r\nsupper he might attempt to read in the sitting-room, and would\r\nfind it impossible with the inefficient light of one candle. The\r\nhostess, seeing his dilemma, would say: \"It is rather difficult\r\nto read here evenings; the proverb says 'you must have a ship at\r\nsea in order to be able to burn two candles at once;' we never\r\nhave an extra candle except on extra occasions.\" These extra\r\noccasions occur, perhaps, twice a year. In this way the good\r\nwoman saves five, six, or ten dollars in that time; but the\r\ninformation which might be derived from having the extra light\r\nwould, of course, far outweigh a ton of candles.\r\n\r\nBut the trouble does not end here. Feeling that she is so\r\neconomical in tallow candles, she thinks she can afford to go\r\nfrequently to the village and spend twenty or thirty dollars for\r\nribbons and furbelows, many of which are not necessary. This\r\nfalse economy may frequently be seen in men of business, and in\r\nthose instances it often runs to writing-paper. You find good\r\nbusiness men who save all the old envelopes and scraps, and would\r\nnot tear a new sheet of paper, if they could avoid it, for the\r\nworld. This is all very well; they may in this way save five or\r\nten dollars a year, but being so economical (only in note-paper),\r\nthey think they can afford to waste time; to have expensive\r\nparties, and to drive their carriages.\r\n\r\nTrue economy consists in always making the income exceed the\r\nout-go. Wear the old clothes a little longer if necessary;\r\ndispense with the new pair of gloves; mend the old dress; live on\r\nplainer food if need be; so that, under all circumstances, unless\r\nsome unforeseen accident occurs, there will be a margin in favor\r\nof the income. A penny here, and a dollar there, placed at\r\ninterest, goes on accumulating, and in this way the desired\r\nresult is attained. It requires some training, perhaps, to\r\naccomplish this economy, but when once used to it, you will find\r\nthere is more satisfaction in rational saving than in irrational\r\nspending. Here is a recipe which I recommend; I have found it to\r\nwork an excellent cure for extravagance, and especially for\r\nmistaken economy: When you find that you have no surplus at the\r\nend of the year, and yet have a good income, I advise you to take\r\na few sheets of paper and form them into a book and mark down\r\nevery item of expenditure. Post it every day or week in two\r\ncolumns, one headed \"necessaries\" or even \"comforts,\" and the\r\nother headed \"luxuries,\" and you will find that the latter column\r\nwill be double, treble, and frequently ten times greater than the\r\nformer. The real comforts of life cost but a small portion of\r\nwhat most of us can earn.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of success in life is good health; that is the\r\nsubstratum of fortune; it is also the basis of happiness. A\r\nperson cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick. He\r\nhas no ambition; no incentive; no force. Of course, there are\r\nthose who have bad health and cannot help it; you cannot expect\r\nthat such persons can accumulate wealth; but there are a great\r\nmany in poor health who need not be so.\r\n\r\nIf, then, sound health is the foundation of success and happiness\r\nin life, how important it is that we should study the laws of\r\nhealth, which is but another expression for the laws of nature!\r\nThe closer we keep to the laws of nature the nearer we are to\r\ngood health, and yet how many persons there are who pay no\r\nattention to natural laws, but absolutely transgress them, even\r\nagainst their own natural inclination. We ought to know that the\r\n\"sin of ignorance\" is never winked at in regard to the violation\r\nof nature's laws; their infraction always brings the penalty. A\r\nchild may thrust its finger into the flames without knowing it\r\nwill burn, and so suffers; repentance, even, will not stop the\r\nsmart. Many of our ancestors knew very little about the principle\r\nof ventilation. They did not know much about oxygen, whatever\r\nother \"gin\" they might have been acquainted with; and\r\nconsequently, they built their houses with little seven-by-nine\r\nfeet bedrooms, and these good old pious Puritans would lock\r\nthemselves up in one of these cells, say their prayers and go to\r\nbed. In the morning they would devoutly return thanks for the\r\n\"preservation of their lives\" during the night, and nobody had\r\nbetter reason to be thankful. Probably some big crack in the\r\nwindow, or in the door, let in a little fresh air, and thus saved\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMany persons knowingly violate the laws of nature against their\r\nbetter impulses, for the sake of fashion. For instance, there is\r\none thing that nothing living except a vile worm ever naturally\r\nloved, and that is tobacco; yet how many persons there are who\r\ndeliberately train an unnatural appetite, and overcome this\r\nimplanted aversion for tobacco, to such a degree that they get to\r\nlove it. They have got hold of a poisonous, filthy weed, or\r\nrather that takes a firm hold of them. Here are married men who\r\nrun about spitting tobacco-juice on the carpet and floors, and\r\nsometimes even upon their wives besides. They do not kick their\r\nwives out-of-doors like drunken men, but their wives, I have no\r\ndoubt, often wish they were outside of the house. Another\r\nperilous feature is that this artificial appetite, like jealousy,\r\n\"grows by what it feeds on;\" when you love that which is\r\nunnatural, a stronger appetite is created for the hurtful thing\r\nthan the natural desire for what is harmless. There is an old\r\nproverb which says that \"habit is second nature,\" but an\r\nartificial habit is stronger than nature. Take, for instance, an\r\nold tobacco-chewer; his love for the \"quid\" is stronger than his\r\nlove for any particular kind of food. He can give up roast beef\r\neasier than give up the weed.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply with tenfold force to the use of intoxicating\r\ndrinks. To make money, requires a clear brain. A man has got to\r\nsee that two and two make four; he must lay all his plans with\r\nreflection and forethought, and closely examine all the details\r\nand the ins and outs of business. As no man can succeed in\r\nbusiness unless he has a brain to enable him to lay his plans,\r\nand reason to guide him in their execution, so, no matter how\r\nbountifully a man may be blessed with intelligence, if the brain\r\nis muddled, and his judgment warped by intoxicating drinks, it is\r\nimpossible for him to carry on business successfully. How many\r\ngood opportunities have passed, never to return, while a man was\r\nsipping a \"social glass\" with his friend! How many foolish\r\nbargains have been made under the influence of the \"nervine,\"\r\nwhich temporarily makes its victim think he is rich. How many\r\nimportant chances have been put off until to-morrow, and then\r\nforever, because the wine-cup has thrown the system into a state\r\nof lassitude, neutralizing the energies so essential to success\r\nin business. Verily, \"wine is a mocker.\" The use of intoxicating\r\ndrinks as a beverage is as much an infatuation as is the smoking\r\nof opium by the Chinese, and the former is quite as destructive\r\nto the success of the business man as the latter. It is an\r\nunmitigated evil, utterly indefensible in the light of\r\nphilosophy, religion or good sense. It is the parent of nearly\r\nevery other evil in our country.\r\n\r\nThe safest plan, and the one most sure of success for the young\r\nman starting in life, is to select the vocation which is most\r\ncongenial to his tastes. Parents and guardians are often quite\r\ntoo negligent in regard to this. It is very common for a father\r\nto say, for example: \"I have five boys. I will make Billy a\r\nclergyman; John a lawyer; Tom a doctor, and Dick a farmer.\" He\r\nthen goes into town and looks about to see what he will do with\r\nSammy. He returns home, and says: \"Sammy, I see watchmaking is a\r\nnice, genteel business; I think I will make you a goldsmith.\" He\r\ndoes this, regardless of Sam's natural inclinations or genius.\r\n\r\nWe are all, no doubt, born for a wise purpose. There is as much\r\ndiversity in our brains as in our countenances. Some are born\r\nnatural mechanics, while some have great aversion to machinery.\r\nLet a dozen boys of ten years get together, and you will soon\r\nobserve two or three are \"whittling\" out some ingenious device;\r\nworking with locks or complicated machinery. When they were but\r\nfive years old their father could find no toy to please them like\r\na puzzle. They are natural mechanics; but the other eight or nine\r\nboys have different aptitudes I belong to the latter class; I\r\nnever had the slightest love for mechanism; on the contrary, I\r\nhave a sort of abhorrence for complicated machinery. I never had\r\ningenuity enough to whittle a cider-tap so it would not leak. I\r\nnever could make a pen that I could write with, or understand the\r\nprinciple of a steam-engine. If a man was to take such a boy as I\r\nwas, and attempt to make a watchmaker of him, the boy might,\r\nafter an apprenticeship of five or seven years be able to take\r\napart and put together a watch; but all through life he would be\r\nworking uphill and seizing every excuse for leaving his work and\r\nidling away his time. Watchmaking is repulsive to him.\r\n\r\nUnless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature,\r\nand best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed. I am\r\nglad to believe that the majority of persons do find their right\r\nvocation. Yet we see many who have mistaken their calling from\r\nthe blacksmith up (or down) to the clergyman. You will see, for\r\ninstance, that extraordinary linguist, the \"learned blacksmith,\"\r\nwho ought to have been a teacher of languages; and you may have\r\nseen lawyers, doctors and clergymen who were better fitted by\r\nnature for the anvil or the lapstone.\r\n\r\nAvoid debt. Young men starting in life should avoid running into\r\ndebt. There is scarcely anything that drags a person down like\r\ndebt. It is a slavish position to get in, yet we find many a\r\nyoung man, hardly out of his \"teens,\" running in debt. He meets a\r\nchum, and says, \"Look at this: I have got trusted for a new suit\r\nof clothes.\" He seems to look upon the clothes as so much given\r\nto him; well, it frequently is so, but, if he succeeds in paying\r\nand then gets trusted again, he is adopting a habit which will\r\nkeep him in poverty through life. Debt robs a man of his\r\nself-respect, and makes him almost despise himself. Grunting and\r\ngroaning and working for what he has eaten up or worn out, and\r\nnow when he is called upon to pay up he has nothing to show for\r\nhis money; this is properly termed \"working for a dead horse.\" I\r\ndo not speak of merchants buying and selling on credit, or of\r\nthose who buy on credit in order to turn the purchase to a\r\nprofit. The old Quaker said to his farmer son, \"John, never get\r\ntrusted; but if thee gets trusted for anything, let it be for\r\n'manure,' because that will help thee pay it back again.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beecher advised young men to get in debt if they could to a\r\nsmall amount in the purchase of land in the country districts.\r\n\"If a young man,\" he says, \"will only get in debt for some land\r\nand then get married, these two things will keep him straight, or\r\nnothing will.\" This may be safe to a limited extent, but getting\r\nin debt for what you eat and drink and wear is to be avoided.\r\nSome families have a foolish habit of getting credit at \"the\r\nstores,\" and thus frequently purchase many things which might\r\nhave been dispensed with.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to say, \"I have got trusted for sixty days,\r\nand if I don't have the money the creditor will think nothing\r\nabout it.\" There is no class of people in the world who have such\r\ngood memories as creditors. When the sixty days run out you will\r\nhave to pay. If you do not pay, you will break your promise, and\r\nprobably resort to a falsehood. You may make some excuse or get\r\nin debt elsewhere to pay it, but that only involves you the\r\ndeeper.\r\n\r\nA good-looking, lazy young fellow, was the apprentice boy,\r\nHoratio. His employer said, \"Horatio, did you ever see a snail?\"\r\n\"I--think--I--have,\" he drawled out. \"You must have met him,\r\nthen, for I am sure you never overtook one,\" said the \"boss.\"\r\nYour creditor will meet you or overtake you and say, \"Now, my\r\nyoung friend, you agreed to pay me; you have not done it, you\r\nmust give me your note.\" You give the note on interest and it\r\ncommences working against you; \"it is a dead horse.\" The creditor\r\ngoes to bed at night and wakes up in the morning better off than\r\nwhen he retired to bed, because his interest has increased during\r\nthe night, but you grow poorer while you are sleeping, for the\r\ninterest is accumulating against you.\r\n\r\nAmong the maxims of the elder Rothschild was one, an apparent\r\nparadox: \"Be cautious and bold.\" This seems to be a contradiction\r\nin terms, but it is not, and there is great wisdom in the maxim.\r\nIt is, in fact, a condensed statement of what I have already\r\nsaid. It is to say, \"you must exercise your caution in laying\r\nyour plans, but be bold in carrying them out.\" A man who is all\r\ncaution will never dare to take hold and be successful; and a man\r\nwho is all boldness is merely reckless, and must eventually fail.\r\nA man may go on \"'change\" and make fifty or one hundred thousand\r\ndollars in speculating in stocks at a single operation. But if he\r\nhas simple boldness without caution, it is mere chance, and what\r\nhe gains to-day he will lose to-morrow. You must have both the\r\ncaution and the boldness to insure success.\r\n\r\nThe Rothschilds have another maxim: \"Never have anything to do\r\nwith an unlucky man or place.\" That is to say, never have\r\nanything to do with a man or place which never succeeds, because,\r\nalthough a man may appear to be honest and intelligent, yet if he\r\ntries this or that thing and always fails, it is on account of\r\nsome fault or infirmity that you may not be able to discover, but\r\nnevertheless which must exist.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing in the world as luck. There never was a\r\nman who could go out in the morning and find a purse full of gold\r\nin the street to-day, and another to-morrow, and so on, day after\r\nday. He may do so once in his life; but so far as mere luck is\r\nconcerned, he is as liable to lose it as to find it. \"Like causes\r\nproduce like effects.\" If a man adopts the proper methods to be\r\nsuccessful, \"luck\" will not prevent him. If he does not succeed,\r\nthere are reasons for it, although, perhaps, he may not be able\r\nto see them.\r\n\r\nWe all depend, more or less, upon the public for our support. We\r\nall trade with the public--lawyers, doctors, shoemakers, artists,\r\nblacksmiths, showmen, opera singers, railroad presidents, and\r\ncollege professors. Those who deal with the public must be\r\ncareful that their goods are valuable; that they are genuine, and\r\nwill give satisfaction. When you get an article which you know is\r\ngoing to please your customers, and that when they have tried it\r\nthey will feel they have got their money's worth, then let the\r\nfact be known that you have got it. Be careful to advertise it in\r\nsome shape or other, because it is evident that if a man has ever\r\nso good an article for sale, and nobody knows it, it will bring\r\nhim no return. In a country like this, where nearly everybody\r\nreads, and where newspapers are issued and circulated in editions\r\nof five thousand to two hundred thousand, it would be very unwise\r\nif this channel was not taken advantage of to reach the public in\r\nadvertising. A newspaper goes into the family, and is read by\r\nwife and children, as well as the head of the house; hence\r\nhundreds and thousands of people may read your advertisement,\r\nwhile you are attending to your routine business. Many, perhaps,\r\nread it while you are asleep. The whole philosophy of life is,\r\nfirst \"sow,\" then \"reap.\" That is the way the farmer does; he\r\nplants his potatoes and corn, and sows his grain, and then goes\r\nabout something else, and the time comes when he reaps. But he\r\nnever reaps first and sows afterwards. This principle applies to\r\nall kinds of business, and to nothing more eminently than to\r\nadvertising. If a man has a genuine article, there is no way in\r\nwhich he can reap more advantageously than by \"sowing\" to the\r\npublic in this way. He must, of course, have a really good\r\narticle, and one which will please his customers; anything\r\nspurious will not succeed permanently, because the public is\r\nwiser than many imagine. Men and women are selfish, and we all\r\nprefer purchasing where we can get the most for our money; and we\r\ntry to find out where we can most surely do so.\r\n\r\nYou may advertise a spurious article, and induce many people to\r\ncall and buy it once, but they will denounce you as an impostor\r\nand swindler, and your business will gradually die out and leave\r\nyou poor. This is right. Few people can safely depend upon chance\r\ncustom. You all need to have your customers return and purchase\r\nagain. A man said to me, \"I have tried advertising and did not\r\nsucceed; yet I have a good article.\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"My friend, there may be exceptions to a general rule.\r\nBut how do you advertise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I put it in a weekly newspaper three times, and paid a dollar\r\nand a half for it.\" I replied: \"Sir, advertising is like\r\nlearning--'a little is a dangerous thing!' \"\r\n\r\nA French writer says that \"The reader of a newspaper does not see\r\nthe first insertion of an ordinary advertisement; the second\r\ninsertion he sees, but does not read; the third insertion he\r\nreads; the fourth insertion, he looks at the price; the fifth\r\ninsertion, he speaks of it to his wife; the sixth insertion, he\r\nis ready to purchase, and the seventh insertion, he purchases.\"\r\nYour object in advertising is to make the public understand what\r\nyou have got to sell, and if you have not the pluck to keep\r\nadvertising, until you have imparted that information, all the\r\nmoney you have spent is lost.\r\n\r\nWork at it, if necessary, early and late, in season and out of\r\nseason, not leaving a stone unturned, and never deferring for a\r\nsingle hour that which can be done just as well now. The old\r\nproverb is full of truth and meaning: \"Whatever is worth doing at\r\nall, is worth doing well.\" Many a man acquires a fortune by doing\r\nhis business thoroughly, while his neighbor remains poor for\r\nlife, because he only half does it. Ambition, energy, industry,\r\nperseverance, are indispensable requisites for success in\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFortune always favors the brave, and never helps a man who does\r\nnot help himself. It won't do to spend your time like Mr.\r\nMicawber, in waiting for something to \"turn up.\" To such men one\r\nof two things usually \"turns up:\" the poor-house or the jail; for\r\nidleness breeds bad habits, and clothes a man in rags. The poor\r\nspendthrift vagabond said to a rich man:\r\n\r\n\"I have discovered there is money enough in the world for all of\r\nus, if it was equally divided; this must be done, and we shall\r\nall be happy together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" was the response, \"if everybody was like you, it would be\r\nspent in two months, and what would you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! divide again; keep dividing, of course!\"\r\n\r\nI was recently reading in a London paper an account of a like\r\nphilosophic pauper, who was kicked out of a cheap boarding-house\r\nbecause he could not pay his bill, but he had a roll of papers\r\nsticking out of his coat pocket, which, upon examination, proved\r\nto be his plan for paying off the national debt of England\r\nwithout the aid of a penny. People have got to do as Cromwell\r\nsaid: \"Not only trust in Providence, but keep the powder dry.\" Do\r\nyour part of the work, or you cannot succeed. Mahomet, one night,\r\nwhile encamping in the desert, overheard one of his fatigued\r\nfollowers remark: \"I will loose my camel, and trust it to God.\"\r\n\"No, no, not so,\" said the prophet; \"tie thy camel, and trust it\r\nto God.\" Do all you can for yourselves, and then trust to\r\nProvidence, or luck, or whatever you please to call it, for the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSome men have a foolish habit of telling their business secrets.\r\nIf they make money they like to tell their neighbors how it was\r\ndone. Nothing is gained by this, and ofttimes much is lost. Say\r\nnothing about your profits, your hopes, your expectations, your\r\nintentions. And this should apply to letters as well as to\r\nconversation. Goethe makes Mephistophiles say: \"Never write a\r\nletter nor destroy one.\" Business men must write letters, but\r\nthey should be careful what they put in them. If you are losing,\r\nmoney, be specially cautious and not tell of it or you will lose\r\nyour reputation.\r\n\r\nPreserve your integrity. It is more precious than, diamonds or\r\nrubies. The old miser said to his sons: \"Get money; get it\r\nhonestly, if you can, but get money.\" This advice was not only\r\natrociously wicked, but it was the very essence of stupidity. It\r\nwas as much as to say, \"if you find it difficult to obtain money\r\nhonestly, you can easily get it dishonestly. Get it in that way.\"\r\nPoor fool! Not to know that the most difficult thing in life is\r\nto make money dishonestly! not to know that our prisons are full\r\nof men who attempted to follow this advice; not to understand\r\nthat no man can be dishonest without soon being found out, and\r\nthat when his lack of principle is discovered, nearly every\r\navenue to success is closed against him forever. The public very\r\nproperly shun all whose integrity is doubted. No matter how\r\npolite and pleasant and accommodating a man may be, none of us\r\ndare to deal with him if we suspect \"false weights and measures.\"\r\nStrict honesty not only lies at the foundation of all success in\r\nlife (financially), but in every other respect. Uncompromising\r\nintegrity of character is invaluable. It secures to its possessor\r\na peace and joy which cannot be attained without it--which no\r\namount of money, or houses and lands, can purchase. A man who is\r\nknown to be strictly honest, may be ever so poor, but he has the\r\npurses of all the community at his disposal--for all know that if\r\nhe promises to return what he borrows, he will never disappoint\r\nthem. As a mere matter of selfishness, therefore, if a man had no\r\nhigher motive for being honest, all will find that the maxim of\r\nDr. Franklin can never fail to be true--that \"honesty is the best\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\nI hold that no man ought ever to indorse a note or become\r\nsecurity for any man, be it his father or brother, to a greater\r\nextent than he can afford to lose and care nothing about, without\r\ntaking good security. Here is a man that is worth twenty thousand\r\ndollars; he is doing a thriving manufacturing or mercantile\r\ntrade; you are retired and living on your money; he comes to you\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\"You are aware that I am worth twenty thousand dollars, and don't\r\nowe a dollar: if I had five thousand dollars in cash, I could\r\npurchase a particular lot of goods and double my money in a\r\ncouple of months; will you indorse my note for that amount?\"\r\n\r\nYou reflect that he is worth twenty thousand dollars, and you\r\nincur no risk by indorsing his note; you like to accommodate him,\r\nand you lend your name without taking the precaution of getting\r\nsecurity. Shortly after, he shows you the note with your\r\nindorsement cancelled, and tells you, probably truly, \"that he\r\nmade the profit that he expected by the operation;\" you reflect\r\nthat you have done a good action, and the thought makes you feel\r\nhappy. By and by the same thing occurs again and you do it again;\r\nyou have already fixed the impression in your mind that it is\r\nperfectly safe to indorse his notes without security.\r\n\r\nBut the trouble is, this man is getting money too easily. He has\r\nonly to take your note to the bank, get it discounted, and take\r\nthe cash. He gets money for the time being without effort;\r\nwithout inconvenience to himself. Now mark the result. He sees a\r\nchance for speculation outside of his business. A temporary\r\ninvestment of only $10,000 is required. It is sure to come back\r\nbefore a note at the bank would be due. He places a note for that\r\namount before you. You sign it almost mechanically. Being firmly\r\nconvinced that your friend is responsible and trustworthy, you\r\nindorse his notes as a \"matter of course.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the speculation does not come to a head quite so\r\nsoon as was expected, and another $10,000 note must be discounted\r\nto take up the last one when due. Before this note matures the\r\nspeculation has proved an utter failure and all the money is\r\nlost. Does the loser tell his friend, the indorser, that he has\r\nlost half of his fortune? Not at all. He don't even mention that\r\nhe has speculated at all. But he has got excited; the spirit of\r\nspeculation has seized him; he sees others making large sums in\r\nthis way (we seldom hear of the loser), and, like other\r\nspeculators, he \"looks for his money where he loses it.\" He tries\r\nagain. Indorsing notes has become chronic with you, and at every\r\nloss he gets your signature for whatever amount he wants. Finally\r\nyou discover your friend has lost all of his property and all of\r\nyours. You are overwhelmed with astonishment and grief, and you\r\nsay \"it is a hard thing; my friend here has ruined me,\" but, you\r\nshould add, \"I have also ruined him.\" If you had said in the\r\nfirst place, \"I will accommodate you, but I never indorse without\r\ntaking ample security,\" he could not have gone beyond the length\r\nof his tether, and he would never have been tempted away from his\r\nlegitimate business. It is a very dangerous thing, therefore, at\r\nany time, to let people get possession of money too easily; it\r\ntempts them to hazardous speculations, if nothing more. Solomon\r\ntruly said, \"He that hateth suretiship is sure.\"\r\n\r\nWe sometimes see men who have obtained fortunes suddenly become\r\npoor. In many cases this arises from intemperance, and often from\r\ngaming and other bad habits. Frequently it occurs because a man\r\nhas been engaged in \"outside operations\" of some sort. When he\r\ngets rich in his legitimate business, he is told of a grand\r\nspeculation where he can make a score of thousands. He is\r\nconstantly flattered by his friends, who tell him that he is born\r\nlucky, that everything he touches turns into gold. Now if he\r\nforgets that his economical habits, his rectitude of conduct and\r\na personal attention to a business which he understood, caused\r\nhis success in life, he will listen to the siren voices. He says:\r\n\r\n\"I will put in twenty thousand dollars. I have been lucky, and my\r\ngood luck will soon bring me back sixty thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nA few days elapse, and it is discovered he must put in ten\r\nthousand dollars more; soon after he is told \"it is all right,\"\r\nbut certain matters not foreseen require an advance of twenty\r\nthousand dollars more, which will bring him a rich harvest; but\r\nbefore the time comes around to realize the bubble bursts, he\r\nloses all he is possessed of, and then he learns what he ought to\r\nhave known at the first, that however successful a man may be in\r\nhis own business, if he turns from that and engages in a business\r\nwhich he don't understand, he is like Samson when shorn of his\r\nlocks--his strength has departed, and he becomes like other men.\r\n\r\nIf a man has plenty of money, he ought to invest something in\r\neverything that appears to promise success, and that will\r\nprobably benefit mankind; but let the sums thus invested be\r\nmoderate in amount, and never let a man foolishly jeopardize a\r\nfortune that he has earned in a legitimate way by investing it in\r\nthings in which he has had no experience.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is in the right path he must persevere. I speak of\r\nthis because there are some persons who are \"born tired;\"\r\nnaturally lazy and possessing no self-reliance and no\r\nperseverance. But they can cultivate these qualities, as Davy\r\nCrockett said:\r\n\r\n          \"This thing remember, when I am dead,\r\n          Be sure you are right, then go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nIt is this go-aheaditiveness, this determination not to let the\r\n\"horrors\" or the \"blues\" take possession of you, so as to make\r\nyou relax your energies in the struggle for independence, which\r\nyou must cultivate.\r\n\r\nHow many have almost reached the goal of their ambition, but,\r\nlosing faith in themselves, have relaxed their energies, and the\r\ngolden prize has been lost forever.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, often true, as Shakespeare says:\r\n\r\n          \"There is a tide in the affairs of men,\r\n          Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.\"\r\n\r\n If you hesitate, some bolder hand will stretch out before you\r\nand get the prize. Remember the proverb of Solomon: \"He becometh\r\npoor that dealeth with a slack hand; but the hand of the diligent\r\nmaketh rich.\"\r\n\r\nPerseverance is sometimes but another word for self-reliance.\r\nMany persons naturally look on the dark side of life, and borrow\r\ntrouble. They are born so. Then they ask for advice, and they\r\nwill be governed by one wind and blown by another, and cannot\r\nrely upon themselves. Until you can get so that you can rely upon\r\nyourself, you need not expect to succeed. I have known men,\r\npersonally, who have met with pecuniary reverses, and absolutely\r\ncommitted suicide, because they thought they could never overcome\r\ntheir misfortune. But I have known others who have met more\r\nserious financial difficulties, and have bridged them over by\r\nsimple perseverance, aided by a firm belief that they were doing\r\njustly, and that Providence would \"overcome evil with good.\"\r\n\r\nLearn something useful. Every man should make his son or daughter\r\nlearn some trade or profession, so that in these days of changing\r\nfortunes--of being rich to-day and poor to-morrow--they may have\r\nsomething tangible to fall back upon. This provision might save\r\nmany persons from misery, who by some unexpected turn of fortune\r\nhave lost all their means.\r\n\r\nLet hope predominate, but be not too visionary. Many persons are\r\nalways kept poor because they are too visionary. Every project\r\nlooks to them like certain success, and therefore they keep\r\nchanging from one business to another, always in hot water,\r\nalways \"under the harrow.\" The plan of \"counting the chickens\r\nbefore they are hatched\" is an error of ancient date, but it does\r\nnot seem to improve by age.\r\n\r\nDo not scatter your powers. Engage in one kind of business only,\r\nand stick to it faithfully until you succeed, or until your\r\nexperience shows that you should abandon it. A constant hammering\r\non one nail will generally drive it home at last, so that it can\r\nbe clinched. When a man's undivided attention is centred on one\r\nobject, his mind will constantly be suggesting improvements of\r\nvalue, which would escape him if his brain was occupied by a\r\ndozen different subjects at once. Many a fortune has slipped\r\nthrough a man's fingers because he was engaged in too many\r\noccupations at a time. There is good sense in the old caution\r\nagainst having too many irons in the fire at once.\r\n\r\nBe systematic. Men should be systematic in their business. A\r\nperson who does business by rule, having a time and place for\r\neverything, doing his work promptly, will accomplish twice as\r\nmuch and with half the trouble of him who does it carelessly and\r\nslipshod. By introducing system into all your transactions, doing\r\none thing at a time, always meeting appointments with\r\npunctuality, you will find leisure for pastime and recreation;\r\nwhereas the man who only half does one thing, and then turns to\r\nsomething else, and half does that, will have his business at\r\nloose ends, and will never know when his day's work is done, for\r\nit never will be done. Of course, there is a limit to all these\r\nrules. We must try to preserve the happy medium, for there is\r\nsuch a thing as being too systematic. There are men and women,\r\nfor instance, who put away things so carefully that they can\r\nnever find them again. It is too much like the \"red-tape\"\r\nformality at Washington, and Mr. Dick-ens' \"Circumlocution\r\nOffice,\"--all theory and no result.\r\n\r\nTo get rich is not always equivalent to being successful. \"there\r\nare many rich poor men,\" while there are many others, honest and\r\ndevout men and women, who have never possessed so much money as\r\nsome rich persons squander in a week, but who are nevertheless\r\nreally richer and happier than any man can ever be while he is a\r\ntransgressor of the higher laws of his being.\r\n\r\nThe inordinate love of money, no doubt, may be and is \"the root\r\nof all evil,\" but money itself, when properly used, is not only a\r\n\"handy thing to have in the house,\" but affords the gratification\r\nof blessing our race by enabling its possessor to enlarge the\r\nscope of human happiness and human influence. The desire for\r\nwealth is nearly universal, and none can say it is not laudable,\r\nprovided the possessor of it accepts its responsibilities, and\r\nuses it as a friend to humanity.\r\n\r\nThe history of money-getting, which is commerce, is a history of\r\ncivilization, and wherever trade has flourished most, there, too,\r\nhave art and science produced the noblest fruits. In fact, as a\r\ngeneral thing, money-getters are the benefactors of our race. To\r\nthem in a great measure, are we indebted for our institutions of\r\nlearning and of art, our academies, colleges and churches. It is\r\nno argument against the desire for, or the possession of, wealth,\r\nto say that there are sometimes misers who hoard money only for\r\nthe sake of hoarding, and who have no higher aspiration than to\r\ngrasp everything which comes within their reach. As we have\r\nsometimes hypocrites in religion, and demagogues in politics, so\r\nthere are occasionally misers among money-getters. These,\r\nhowever, are only exceptions to the general rule. But when, in\r\nthis country, we find such a nuisance and stumbling block as a\r\nmiser, we remember with gratitude that in America we have no laws\r\nof primogeniture, and that in the due course of nature the time\r\nwill come when the hoarded dust will be scattered for the benefit\r\nof mankind. To all men and women, therefore, do I conscientiously\r\nsay, make money honestly, and not otherwise, for Shakespeare has\r\ntruly said, \"He that wants money, means and content, is without\r\nthree good friends.\"\r\n\r\nMoney is in some respects like fire; it is a very excellent\r\nservant but a terrible master. When you have it mastering you;\r\nwhen interest is constantly piling up against you, it will keep\r\nyou down in the worst kind of slavery. But let money work for\r\nyou, and you have the most devoted servant in the world. It is no\r\n\"eye-servant.\" There is nothing animate or inanimate that will\r\nwork so faithfully as money when placed at interest, well\r\nsecured. It works night and day, and in wet or dry weather.\r\n\r\nDo not let it work against you; if you do, there is no chance for\r\nsuccess in life so far as money is concerned. John Randolph, the\r\neccentric Virginian, once exclaimed in Congress, \"Mr. Speaker, I\r\nhave discovered the philosopher's stone: pay as you go.\" This is,\r\nindeed, nearer to the philosopher's stone than any alchemist has\r\never yet arrived.\r\n\r\nBarnum and the newspapers had always been on the best of terms,\r\nand in nearly every instance the press praised the lecture in\r\nmost unqualified terms. The following extract from the London\r\nTimes is a fair sample of many notices which he received:\r\n\r\n\"We are bound to admit that Mr. Barnum is one of the most\r\nentertaining lecturers that ever addressed an audience on a theme\r\nuniversally intelligible. The appearance of Mr. Barnum, it should\r\nbe added, has nothing of the 'charlatan' about it, but is that of\r\nthe thoroughly respectable man of business; and he has at command\r\na fund of dry humor that convulses everybody with laughter, while\r\nhe himself remains perfectly serious. A sonorous voice and an\r\nadmirably clear delivery complete his qualifications as a\r\nlecturer, in which capacity he is no 'humbug,' either in a higher\r\nor lower sense of the word.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1859 he delivered this lecture nearly one hundred\r\ntimes in London and in different parts of England, always with\r\ngreat success.\r\n\r\nRemembering his experiences with Tom Thumb at Oxford and\r\nCambridge, and knowing the fondness of the college men for\r\njoking, Barnum made up his mind to endure any amount of friendly\r\nchaff when he visited their cities.\r\n\r\nHe commenced at Cambridge, where he was greeted with a crowded\r\nhouse, composed largely of under-graduates. Soon after he began\r\nto speak, one of the young men called out: \"Where is Joice Heth?\"\r\nto which Barnum replied: \"Young gentleman, please to restrain\r\nyourself till the close of the lecture, when I shall take great\r\npleasure in affording you all the information I possess\r\nconcerning your deceased relative.\"\r\n\r\nThis turned the laugh against the youthful inquirer, and kept the\r\nstudents quiet for a few moments. Questions of a similar\r\ncharacter were occasionally propounded and as promptly answered,\r\nand on the whole the lecture was interrupted less than Barnum had\r\nanticipated, while the receipts were over one hundred pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford the hall was filled to suffocation half an hour before\r\nthe time announced for the lecture to begin, and the sale of\r\ntickets was stopped.\r\n\r\nBarnum therefore stepped upon the platform, and said: \"Ladies and\r\ngentlemen: as every seat is now occupied and the ticket-office is\r\nclosed, I propose to begin my lecture now and not keep you\r\nwaiting till the advertised hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, old Barnum,\"--\"Time is money,\"--\"Nothing like\r\neconomy,\" yelled the audience. Holding up his hand for silence,\r\nBarnum proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Young gentlemen, I have a word or two to say, in order that we\r\nmay have a thorough understanding between ourselves at the\r\noutset. I see symptoms of a pretty jolly time here this evening,\r\nand you have paid me liberally for the single hour of my time,\r\nwhich is at your service. I am an old traveller and an old\r\nshowman, and I like to please my patrons. Now, it is quite\r\nimmaterial to me; you may furnish the entertainment for the hour,\r\nor I will endeavor to do so, or we will take portions of the time\r\nby turns --you supplying a part of the amusement and I a part--as\r\nwe say sometimes in America, 'you pays your money, and you takes\r\nyour choice.' \"\r\n\r\nThis frankness pleased the students, who agreed to this unique\r\nproposition unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\nThe lecture proceeded for fifteen minutes, when a voice called\r\nout: \"Come, old chap! you must be tired by this time. Hold up now\r\ntill we sing Yankee Doodle.\" Whereupon they all joined in that\r\nhonorable song with lusty good-will, Barnum meanwhile sitting\r\ndown comfortably, to show them that he was quite satisfied with\r\ntheir manner of passing the time. When the song was concluded,\r\nthe leader of the party said: \"Now, Mr. Barnum, you may go ahead\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe lecture went on, or rather A lecture, for Barnum began to\r\nadapt his remarks to the occasion. Every few minutes would come\r\nsome interruption, which was always as much enjoyed by Barnum as\r\nby the audience. When the entertainment concluded, the young men\r\ncrowded to the platform to shake hands with the speaker,\r\ndeclaring that they had had a \"jolly good time,\" while the leader\r\nsaid: \"Stay with us a week, Barnum, and we'll dine you, wine you,\r\nand give you full houses every night.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum would have accepted the invitation had he not been\r\nannounced to lecture in London the next evening, and he told the\r\nstudents so. They asked him all sorts of questions about America,\r\nthe Museum and other shows, and expressed the hope that he would\r\ncome out of his troubles all right.\r\n\r\nAt least a score of them invited him to breakfast with them the\r\nnext morning, but he declined, until one young gentleman insisted\r\non personal grounds. \"My dear sir,\" said he, \"you must breakfast\r\nwith me. I have almost split my throat here to-night, and it is\r\nonly fair for you to repay me by coming to see me in the\r\nmorning.\" This appeal was irresistible, and Barnum agreed to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe boys were pleased with his nerve and good nature, but they\r\nconfided to him that they liked better to get people angry. A few\r\nweeks before Howard Paul had left them in disgust, because they\r\ninsisted on smoking when his wife was on the stage. They added\r\nthat the entertainment was excellent, and Howard Paul might have\r\nmade a thousand pounds if he had kept his temper.\r\n\r\nSome time later Barnum was offered L1,200, or $6,000, for the\r\ncopyright of his lecture; the offer was, however, refused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. AN ENTERPRISING ENGLISHMAN.\r\n\r\nA NEW FRIEND--DINNER TO TOM THUMB AND COMMODORE NUTT--MEASURING\r\nTHE GIANT--THE TWO ENGINES.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the lecture in Manchester a gentleman named\r\nJohn Fish called at the hotel where Barnum was staying. He said\r\nthat he had attended the lecture the evening before, and added\r\nthat he was pretty well acquainted with the lecturer, having read\r\nhis autobiography. He went on to say that he was joint proprietor\r\nwith another gentleman in a cotton-mill near Manchester,\r\n\"although,\" he said, \"a few years ago I was working as a\r\njourneyman, and probably should have been at this time had I not\r\nread your book.\"\r\n\r\nObserving Mr. Barnum's surprise, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Mr. Barnum, upon reading your autobiography, I\r\nthought I perceived you tried to make yourself out worse than you\r\nreally were; for I discovered a pleasant spirit and a good heart\r\nunder the rougher exterior in which you chose to present yourself\r\nto the public; but,\" he added, \"after reading your life, I found\r\nmyself in possession of renewed strength, and awakened energies\r\nand aspirations, and I said to myself, 'Why can't I go ahead and\r\nmake money, as Barnum did? He commenced without money and\r\nsucceeded; why may not I?' In this train of thought,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"I went to a newspaper office and advertised for a\r\npartner with money to join me in establishing a cotton-mill. I\r\nhad no applications, and, remembering your experiences when you\r\nhad money and wanted a partner, I spent half a crown in a similar\r\nexperiment. I advertised for a partner to join a man who had\r\nplenty of capital. Then I had lots of applicants ready to\r\nintroduce me into all sorts of occupations, from that of a banker\r\nto that of a horsejockey or gambler, if I would only furnish the\r\nmoney to start with. After a while, I advertised again for a\r\npartner, and obtained one with money. We have a good mill. I\r\ndevote myself closely to business, and have been very successful.\r\nI know every line in your book; so, indeed, do several members of\r\nmy family; and I have conducted my business on the principles\r\nlaid down in your published 'Rules for Money-making.' I find them\r\ncorrect principles; and, sir, I have sought this interview in\r\norder to thank you for publishing your autobiography, and to tell\r\nyou that to that act of yours I attribute my present position in\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your statement is certainly flattering,\" said Mr. Barnum, \"and I\r\nam glad if I have been able in any manner, through my\r\nexperiences, to aid you in starting in life. But I presume your\r\ngenius would have found vent in time if I had not written the\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, it would not,\" he replied, in an earnest tone; \"I am\r\nsure I should have worked as a mill-hand all my life if it had\r\nnot been for you. Oh, I have made no secret of it,\" he continued;\r\n\"the commercial men with whom I deal know all about it; indeed,\r\nthey call me 'Barnum' on 'change here in Manchester.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when General Tom Thumb exhibited in Bury, Mr.\r\nFish closed his mill, and gave each of his employees a ticket to\r\nthe exhibition; out of respect, as he said, to Barnum. On a\r\nsubsequent occasion, when the little General visited England the\r\nlast time, Mr. Fish invited him, his wife, Commodore Nutt, Minnie\r\nWarren, and the managers of \"the show,\" to a splendid and\r\nsumptuous dinner at his house, which the distinguished little\r\nparty enjoyed exceedingly.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to America, Barnum read an account of a\r\nFrench giant then exhibiting in Paris, and said to be over eight\r\nfeet in height. As this was considerably taller than anything\r\nthat the showman had ever beheld, he wrote to his friend Fish,\r\nwho had expressed a wish to do him any service in his power, and\r\nrequested him to go to Paris, and, by actual measurement, find\r\nout the exact height of the giant. He inclosed an offer,\r\narranging the prices on a sliding scale, commencing at eight\r\nfeet, and descending to seven feet two inches, for if he were not\r\ntaller than that he was not to be desired.\r\n\r\nMr. Fish put a two-foot rule in his pocket, and started for\r\nParis, where, after several days' delay and much trouble beside,\r\nhe finally succeeded in gaining an interview. The giant was shown\r\nBarnum's letter, and read the tempting offers made for his\r\nservices, provided he measured eight feet, or within six inches\r\nof that height.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I measure over eight feet,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" responded Mr. Fish, \"but you see my orders are to\r\nmeasure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no need of that; you can see for yourself,\" stretching\r\nhimself up a few inches by aid of a peculiar knack which giants\r\nand dwarfs possess to increase or diminish their apparent\r\nstature.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you are right,\" persisted Mr. Fish, \"but you see I must\r\nobey orders, and if I am not permitted to measure you I shall not\r\nengage you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the giant, \"if you can't take my word for it, look\r\nat that door. You see my head is more than two feet above the top\r\n(giving his neck a severe stretch); just measure the door.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Fish refused. The giant was now desperate, and,\r\nstretching himself up to his full height, exclaimed: \"Well, be\r\nquick! Put your rule to my feet and measure me; but hurry up,\r\nplease!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fish regarded him coolly. \"Look here!\" said he, \"this sort of\r\nthing won't do, you know. I don't understand this contrivance\r\naround the soles of your boots, but it seems to me you've got a\r\nset of springs there which aids your height when you desire it.\r\nNow I will not stand any more nonsense. If I engage you at all,\r\nyou must first take off your boots, and lie flat upon your back\r\nin the middle of the floor.\"\r\n\r\nThe giant protested, but Mr. Fish was firm, and at last he slowly\r\ntook off his coat and lay down on the floor. Mr. Fish applied his\r\nrule, and to his own astonishment and the giant's indignation the\r\nlatter proved to be barely seven feet one and one-half inches. So\r\nhe was not engaged at all.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards Barnum wrote to his friend and asked his\r\npermission to put him into a new book then in course of\r\npreparation. He wrote in return the following characteristic\r\nletter:\r\n\r\nHad I made a fortune of L100,000 I should have been proud of a\r\nplace in your Autobiography; but as I have only been able to make\r\n(here he named a sum which in this country would be considered\r\nalmost a fortune), I feel I should be out of place in your pages;\r\nat all events, if you mention me at all, draw it mildly, if you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nThe American war has made sad havoc in our trade, and it is only\r\nby close attention to business that I have lately been at all\r\nsuccessful. I have built a place for one thousand looms, and\r\nhave, as you know, put in a pair of engines, which I have named\r\n\"Barnum\" and \"Charity.\" Each engine has its name engraved on two\r\nlarge brass plates at either end of the cylinder, which has often\r\ncaused much mirth when I have explained the circumstances to\r\nvisitors. I started and christened \"Charity\" on the 14th of\r\nJanuary last, and she has saved me L12 per month in coals ever\r\nsince. The steam from the boiler goes first to \"Charity\" (she is\r\nhigh pressure), and \"Barnum\" only gets the steam after she has\r\ndone with it. He has to work at low pressure (a condensing\r\nengine), and the result is a saving. Barnum was extravagant when\r\nhe took steam direct, but since I fixed Charity betwixt him and\r\nthe boiler, he can only get what she gives him. This reminds me\r\nthat you state in your \"Life\" you could always make money, but\r\nformerly did not save it. Perhaps you never took care of it till\r\nCharity became Chancellor of Exchequer. When I visited you at the\r\nBull Hotel, in Blackburn, you pointed to General Tom Thumb, and\r\nsaid: \"That is my piece of goods; I have sold it hundreds of\r\nthousands of times, and have never yet delivered it!\" That was\r\nten years ago, in 1858. If I had been doing the same with my\r\npieces of calico, I must have been wealthy by this time; but I\r\nhave been hammering at one (cotton) nail several months, and, as\r\nit did not offer to clinch, I was almost tempted to doubt one of\r\nyour \"rules,\" and thought I would drive at some other nail; but,\r\non reflection, I knew I understood cotton better than anything\r\nelse, and so I back up your rule and stick to cotton, not\r\ndoubting it will be all right and successful.\r\n\r\nMr. Fish was one of the large class of English manufacturers who\r\nsuffered seriously from the effects of the rebellion in the\r\nUnited States. As an Englishman, he could not have a patriot's\r\ninterest in the progress of that terrible struggle; but he made a\r\npractical exhibition of sympathy for the suffering soldiers, in a\r\npleasant and characteristic manner.\r\n\r\nAt the great Sanitary Fair in New York, during the war, Mr. Fish\r\nsent two monster \"Simuel cakes,\" covered with miniature forts,\r\ncannon, armies, and all the panoply of war, which attracted great\r\nattention from every one present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. AT HOME AGAIN.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOCK DEBTS PAID--THE MUSEUM ONCE MORE UNDER BARNUM'S\r\nMANAGEMENT--ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION--HIS SPEECH--TWO POEMS.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, Barnum returned to the United States. During his trip\r\nabroad he had secured many novelties for the Museum, the Albino\r\nFamily, Thiodon's Mechanical Theatre, and others.\r\n\r\nThese afforded him a liberal commission, and he had beside made\r\nconsiderable money from the Tom Thumb exhibitions and his\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\nAll this, his wife's income, as well as a large sum derived from\r\nthe sale of some of her property, was faithfully devoted to the\r\none object of their lives--paying off the clock debts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barnum and her daughter, Pauline, had either boarded in\r\nBridgeport or lived in a small house in the suburbs during the\r\nentire four years of struggle. The land purchased by Mrs. Barnum\r\nat the assignee's sale in East Bridgeport had increased in value\r\nmeanwhile, and they felt justified in borrowing on it, some of\r\nthe single lots were sold, and all this money went toward the\r\ndischarge of the debts.\r\n\r\nAt last, in March, 1860, all the clock indebtedness was\r\nextinguished, except $20,000, which Barnum bound himself to take\r\nup within a certain time, his friend James D. Johnson\r\nguaranteeing his bond to that effect.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day of March, Messrs. Butler and Greenwood\r\nsigned an agreement to sell and deliver to Barnum on the\r\nfollowing Saturday their entire good-will and interest in the\r\nMuseum collection. This fact was thoroughly circulated, and\r\nblazing posters, placards, and advertisements announced that\r\n\"Barnum is on his feet again.\" It was furthermore stated that the\r\nMuseum would be closed for one week, opening March 31st, under\r\nthe management and proprietorship of its original owner. It was\r\nalso promised that Barnum would address the audience on the night\r\nof closing.\r\n\r\nThe Museum, decked in its holiday dress of flags and banners, was\r\ncrowded to its utmost capacity when Barnum made his appearance.\r\nHis reception was an enthusiastic one, cheers and shouts rent the\r\nair, and tears filled the showman's eyes as he thought of this\r\ntriumphant conclusion of his four years' struggle.\r\n\r\nRecovering himself, he bowed his acknowledgments for the\r\nreception, and addressed the audience as follows:\r\n\r\n\"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I should be more or less than human, if I\r\ncould meet this unexpected and overwhelming testimonial at your\r\nhands, without the deepest emotion. My own personal connection\r\nwith the Museum is now resumed, and I avail myself of the\r\ncircumstance to say why it is so. Never did I feel stronger in my\r\nworldly prosperity than in September, 1855. Three months later I\r\nwas so deeply embarrassed that I felt certain of nothing, except\r\nthe uncertainty of everything. A combination of singular efforts\r\nand circumstances tempted me to put faith in a certain clock\r\nmanufacturing company, and I placed my signature to papers which\r\nultimately broke me down. After nearly five years of hard\r\nstruggle to keep my head above water, I have touched bottom at\r\nlast, and here to-night I am happy to announce that I have waded\r\nashore. Every clock debt of which I have any knowledge has been\r\nprovided for. Perhaps, after the troubles and turmoils I have\r\nexperienced, I should feel no desire to re-engage in the\r\nexcitements of business; but a man like myself, less than fifty\r\nyears of age, and enjoying robust health, is scarcely old enough\r\nto be embalmed and put in a glass case in the Museum as one of\r\nits million of curiosities. 'It is better to wear out than rust\r\nout.' Besides, if a man of active temperament is not busy, he is\r\napt to get into mischief. To avoid evil, therefore, and since\r\nbusiness activity is a necessity of my nature, here I am, once\r\nmore, in the Museum, and among those with whom I have been so\r\nlong and so pleasantly identified. I am confident of a cordial\r\nwelcome, and hence feel some claim to your indulgence while I\r\nbriefly allude to the means of my present deliverance from utter\r\nfinancial ruin. Need I say, in the first place, that I am\r\nsomewhat indebted to the forbearance of generous creditors. In\r\nthe next place, permit me to speak of sympathizing friends, whose\r\nvolunteered loans and exertions vastly aided my rescue. When my\r\nday of sorrow came, I first paid or secured every debt I owed of\r\na personal nature. This done, I felt bound in honor to give up\r\nall of my property that remained toward liquidating my 'clock\r\ndebts.' I placed it in the hands of trustees and receivers for\r\nthe benefit of all the 'clock' creditors. But at the forced sale\r\nof my Connecticut real estate, there was a purchaser behind the\r\nscreen, of whom the world had little knowledge. In the day of my\r\nprosperity I made over to my wife much valuable property,\r\nincluding the lease of this Museum building--a lease then having\r\nabout twenty-two years to run, and enhanced in value to more than\r\ndouble its original worth. I sold the Museum collection to\r\nMessrs. Greenwood & Butler, subject to my wife's separate\r\ninterest in the lease, and she has received more than $80,000\r\nover and above the sums paid to the owners of the building.\r\nInstead of selfishly applying this amount to private purposes, my\r\nfamily lived with a due regard to economy, and the savings\r\n(strictly belonging to my wife) were devoted to buying in\r\nportions of my estate at the assignees' sales and to purchasing\r\n'clock notes' bearing my indorsements. The Christian name of my\r\nwife is Charity. I may well acknowledge, therefore, that I am not\r\nonly a proper 'subject of charity,' but that 'without Charity, I\r\nam nothing.'\r\n\r\n\"But, ladies and gentlemen, while Charity thus labored in my\r\nbehalf, Faith and Hope were not idle. I have been anything but\r\nindolent during the last four years. Driven from pillar to post,\r\nand annoyed beyond description by all sorts of legal claims and\r\nwrits, I was perusing protests and summonses by day, and dreaming\r\nof clocks run down by night. My head was ever whizzing with\r\ndislocated cog-wheels and broken main-springs; my whole mind (and\r\nmy credit) was running upon tick, and everything pressing on me\r\nlike a dead weight.\r\n\r\n\"In this state of affairs I felt that I was of no use on this\r\nside of the Atlantic, so, giving the pendulum a swing, and\r\nseizing time by the forelock, I went to Europe. There I furtively\r\npulled the wires of several exhibitions, among which that of Tom\r\nThumb may be mentioned for example. I managed a variety of\r\nmusical and commercial speculations in Great Britain, Germany,\r\nand Holland. These enterprises, together with the net profits of\r\nmy public lectures, enabled me to remit large sums to\r\nconfidential agents for the purchase of my obligations. In this\r\nmanner, I quietly extinguished, little by little, every dollar of\r\nmy clock liabilities. I could not have achieved this difficult\r\nfeat, however, without the able assistance of enthusiastic\r\nfriends--and among the chief of them let me gratefully\r\nacknowledge the invaluable services of Mr. James D. Johnson, a\r\ngentleman of wealth, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Other gentlemen\r\nhave been generous with me. Some have loaned me large sums\r\nwithout security, and have placed me under obligations which must\r\never command my honest gratitude \"but Mr. Johnson has been a\r\n'friend in deed,' for he has been truly a 'friend in need.'\r\n\r\n\"You must not infer, from what I have said, that I have\r\ncompletely recovered from the stunning blow to which I was\r\nsubjected four years ago. I have lost more in the way of tens of\r\nthousands, yes, hundreds of thousands, than I care to remember. A\r\nvaluable portion of my real estate in Connecticut, however, has\r\nbeen preserved, and as I feel all the ardor of twenty years ago,\r\nand the prospect here is so flattering, my heart is animated with\r\nthe hope of ultimately, by enterprise and activity, obliterating\r\nunpleasant reminiscences, and retrieving the losses of the past.\r\nExperience, too, has taught me not only that, even in the matter\r\nof money, 'enough is as good as a feast,' but that there are, in\r\nthis world, some things vastly better than the Almighty Dollar!\r\nPossibly I may contemplate, at times, the painful day when I said\r\n'Othello's occupation's gone'; but I shall the more frequently\r\ncherish the memory of this moment, when I am permitted to\r\nannounce that Richard's himself again.'\r\n\r\n\"Many people have wondered that a man considered so acute as\r\nmyself should have been deluded into embarrassments like mine,\r\nand not a few have declared, in short meter, that 'Barnum was a\r\nfool.' I can only reply that I never made pretensions to the\r\nsharpness of a pawnbroker, and I hope I shall never so entirely\r\nlose confidence in human nature as to consider every man a scamp\r\nby instinct, or a rogue by necessity. 'It is better to be\r\ndeceived sometimes, than to distrust always,' says Lord Bacon,\r\nand I agree with him.\r\n\r\n\"Experience is said to be a hard schoolmaster, but I should be\r\nsorry to feel that this great lesson in adversity has not brought\r\nforth fruits of some value. I needed the discipline this\r\ntribulation has given me, and I really feel, after all, that\r\nthis, like many other apparent evils, was only a blessing in\r\ndisguise. Indeed, I may mention that the very clock factory which\r\nI built in Bridgeport for the purpose of bringing hundreds of\r\nworkmen to that city, has been purchased and quadrupled in size\r\nby the Wheeler & Wilson Sewing-Machine Company, and is now filled\r\nwith intelligent New England mechanics, whose families add two\r\nthousand to the population, and who are doing a great work in\r\nbuilding up and beautifying that flourishing city. So that the\r\nsame concern which prostrated me seems destined as a most\r\nimportant agent toward my recuperation. I am certain that the\r\npopular sympathy has been with me from the beginning; and this,\r\ntogether with a consciousness of rectitude, is more than an\r\noffset to all the vicissitudes to which I have been subjected.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, I beg to assure you and the public that my chief\r\npleasure, while health and strength are spared me, will be to\r\ncater for your and their healthy amusement and instruction. In\r\nfuture, such capabilities as I possess will be devoted to the\r\nmaintenance of this Museum as a popular place of family resort,\r\nin which all that is novel and interesting shall be gathered from\r\nthe four quarters of the globe, and which ladies and children may\r\nvisit at all times unattended, without danger of encountering\r\nanything of an objectionable nature. The dramas introduced in the\r\nLecture Room will never contain a profane expression or a vulgar\r\nallusion; on the contrary, their tendency will always be to\r\nencourage virtue and frown upon vice.\r\n\r\n\"I have established connections in Europe, which will enable me\r\nto produce here a succession of interesting novelties otherwise\r\ninaccessible. Although I shall be personally present much of the\r\ntime, and hope to meet many of my old acquaintances, as well as\r\nto form many new ones, I am sure you will be glad to learn that I\r\nhave re-secured the services of one of the late proprietors, and\r\nthe active manager of this Museum, Mr. John Greenwood, Jr. As he\r\nis a modest gentleman, who would be the last to praise himself,\r\nallow me to add that he is one to whose successful qualities as a\r\ncaterer for the popular entertainments, the crowds that have\r\noften filled this building may well bear testimony. But, more\r\nthan this, he is the unobtrusive one to whose integrity,\r\ndiligence, and devotion I owe much of my present position of\r\nself-congratulation. Mr. Greenwood will hereafter act as\r\nassistant manager, while his late co-partner, Mr. Butler, has\r\nengaged in another branch of business. Once more, thanking you\r\nall for your kind welcome, I bid you, till the re-opening, 'an\r\naffectionate adieu.' \"\r\n\r\nThe speech was received with wild enthusiasm, and after the\r\nre-opening of the Museum the number of visitors was at once\r\nalmost doubled.\r\n\r\nAmong the many newspaper congratulations he received, none gave\r\nBarnum more pleasure than a poem from his old admirer on the\r\nBoston Saturday Evening Gazette.\r\n\r\nANOTHER WORD FOR BARNUM.\r\n\r\n Barnum, your hand! The struggle o'er,\r\n     You face the world and ask no favor;\r\n You stand where you have stood before,\r\n     The old salt hasn't lost its savor.\r\n You now can laugh with friends, at foes'\r\n     Ne'er heeding Mrs. Grundy's tattle;\r\n You've dealt and taken sturdy blows,\r\n     Regardless of the rabble's prattle.\r\n\r\n  Not yours the heart to harbor ill\r\n     'Gainst those who've dealt in trivial jesting;\r\n You pass them with the same good will\r\n     Erst shown when they their wit were testing.\r\nYou're the same Barnum that we knew,\r\n     You're good for years, still fit for labor,\r\n Be as of old, be bold and true,\r\n     Honest as man, as friend, as neighbor.\r\n\r\nAt about this period, the following poem was published in a\r\nPottsville, Pa., paper, and copied by many journals of the-day:\r\n\r\nA HEALTH TO BARNUM.\r\n\r\n Companions! fill your glasses round\r\n     And drink a health to one\r\n Who has few coming after him,\r\n     To do as he has done;\r\n Who made a fortune for himself,\r\n     Made fortunes, too, for many,\r\n Yet wronged no bosom of a sigh,\r\n     No pocket of a penny.\r\n Come! shout a gallant chorus,\r\n     And make the glasses ring,\r\n Here's health and luck to Barnum!\r\n     The Exhibition King.\r\n\r\n  Who lured the Swedish Nightingale\r\n     To Western woods to come?\r\n Who prosperous and happy made\r\n     The life of little Thumb?\r\n Who oped Amusement's golden door\r\n     So cheaply to the crowd,\r\n And taught Morality to smile\r\n     On all HIS stage allowed?\r\n Come! shout a gallant chorus,\r\n     Until the glasses ring--\r\n Here's health and luck to Barnum!\r\n     The Exhibition King.\r\n\r\n  And when the sad reverses came,\r\n     As come they may to all,\r\n Who stood a Hero, bold and true,\r\n     Amid his fortune's fall?\r\n Who to the utmost yielded up\r\n     What Honor could not keep,\r\n Then took the field of life again\r\n     With courage calm and deep?\r\n Come! shout a gallant chorus,\r\n     Until the glasses dance--\r\n Here's health and luck to Barnum,\r\n     The Napoleon of Finance\r\n\r\n Yet, no--OUR hero would not look\r\n     With smiles on such a cup;\r\n Throw out the wine--with water clear,\r\n     Fill the pure crystal up\r\n Then rise, and greet with deep respect,\r\n     The courage he has shown,\r\n And drink to him who well deserves\r\n     A seat on Fortune's throne.\r\n Here's health and luck to Barnum!\r\n     An ELBA he has seen,\r\n And never may his map of life\r\n     Display a ST HELENE!\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to observe that the phrase \"Napoleon of\r\nFinance,\" which has in recent years been applied to several Wall\r\nStreet speculators, was first coined in honorable description of\r\nPhineas T. Barnum, because of his honesty as well as his signal\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. THE STORY OF \"GRIZZLY ADAMS.\"\r\n\r\nBARNUM'S PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FAMOUS BEAR HUNTER--FOOLING HIM\r\nWITH THE \"GOLDEN PIGEONS\"--ADAMS EARNS $500 AT DESPERATE\r\nCOST--TRICKING BARNUM OUT OF A FINE HUNTING SUIT--PROSPERITY OF\r\nTHE MUSEUM--VISIT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.\r\n\r\nThe famous old American Museum was now the centre of Barnum's\r\ninterests, and he devoted himself to its development with such\r\nenergy as never before. His enterprise in securing new\r\ncuriosities, and his skill in presenting them to the public in\r\nthe most attractive light, surpassed all previous efforts. To his\r\noffice, as to their Mecca, flocked all the \"freaks\" of the land,\r\nand all who possessed any objects of rare or marvelous nature.\r\nForemost among these visitors was one veteran frontiersman, who\r\nhad attained--and well deserved--much fame as a fighter of the\r\nmost savage wild beasts. His name was James C. Adams, but he was\r\nuniversally known as \"Grizzly Adams,\" from the fact that he had\r\ncaptured a great many grizzly bears at the risk and cost of\r\nfearful encounters and perils. He was brave, and with his bravery\r\nthere was enough of the romantic in his nature to make him a real\r\nhero. For many years a hunter and trapper in the Rocky and Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains, he acquired a recklessness, which, added to his\r\nnatural invincible courage, rendered him one of the most striking\r\nmen of the age, and he was emphatically a man of pluck. A month\r\nafter Barnum had re-purchased the Museum, Adams arrived in New\r\nYork with his famous collection of California animals, captured\r\nby himself, consisting of twenty or thirty immense grizzly bears,\r\nat the head of which stood \"Old Samson,\" together with several\r\nwolves, half a dozen different species of California bears,\r\nCalifornia lions, tigers, buffalo, elk, and \"Old Neptune,\" the\r\ngreat sea-lion from the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOld Adams had trained all these monsters so that with him they\r\nwere as docile as kittens, though many of the most ferocious\r\namong them would attack a stranger without hesitation, if he came\r\nwithin their grasp. In fact, the training of these animals was no\r\nfool's play, as Old Adams learned to his cost, for the terrific\r\nblows which he received from time to time, while teaching them\r\n\"docility,\" finally cost him his life.\r\n\r\nAdams called on Barnum immediately on his arrival in New York. He\r\nwas dressed in his hunter's suit of buckskin, trimmed with the\r\nskins and bordered with the hanging tails of small Rocky Mountain\r\nanimals; his cap consisting of the skin of a wolf's head and\r\nshoulders, from which depended several tails, and under which\r\nappeared his stiff bushy, gray hair and his long, white, grizzly\r\nbeard; in fact, Old Adams was quite as much of a show as his\r\nbeasts. They had come around Cape Horn on the clipper ship\r\n\"Golden Fleece,\" and a sea voyage of three and a half months had\r\nprobably not added much to the beauty or neat appearance of the\r\nold bear-hunter. During their conversation Grizzly Adams took off\r\nhis cap, and showed Barnum the top of his head. His skull was\r\nliterally broken in. It had, on various occasions, been struck by\r\nthe fearful paws of his grizzly students; and the last blow, from\r\nthe bear called \"General Fremont,\" had laid open his brain so\r\nthat its workings were plainly visible. Barnum remarked that he\r\nthought it was a dangerous wound and might possibly prove fatal.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Adams, \"that will fix me out. It had nearly\r\nhealed; but old Fremont opened it for me, for the third or fourth\r\ntime, before I left California, and he did his business so\r\nthoroughly, I'm a used-up man. However, I reckon I may live six\r\nmonths or a year yet.\" This was spoken as coolly as if he had\r\nbeen talking about the life of a dog.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary man had come to see Barnum about the\r\n\"California Menagerie,\" of which he, Adams, was the owner. Barnum\r\nhad shortly before, however, purchased one-half interest in it\r\nfrom a man who had claimed to be Adams's equal partner. This\r\nAdams disputed, declaring that he had merely borrowed from the\r\nman some money on the security of the show, that the man was not\r\nhis partner, and that he had no right to sell one-half or any\r\nportion of the menagerie. As a matter of fact, however, the man\r\ndid have a bill of sale for one-half of the show, and Adams was\r\nsoon convinced that Barnum's purchase was entirely legitimate.\r\nThe result was that Barnum and Adams formed a regular\r\npartnership, the former to attend to all business affairs, the\r\nlatter to exhibit the animals. The show was opened in a huge\r\ncanvas tent on Broadway, at the corner of Thirteenth Street.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of opening, a band of music preceded a procession\r\nof animal cages down Broadway and up the Bowery, old Adams,\r\ndressed in his hunting costume, heading the line, with a platform\r\nwagon on which were placed three immense grizzly bears, two of\r\nwhich he held by chains, while he was mounted on the back of the\r\nlargest grizzly, which stood in the centre and was not secured in\r\nany manner whatever. This was the bear known as \"General\r\nFremont,\" and so docile had he become that Adams said he had used\r\nhim as a pack-bear, to carry his cooking and hunting apparatus\r\nthrough the mountains for six months, and had ridden him hundreds\r\nof miles. But apparently docile as were many of these animals,\r\nthere was not one among them that would not occasionally give\r\nAdams a sly blow or a sly bite when a good chance offered; hence\r\nold Adams was but a wreck of his former self, and expressed\r\npretty nearly the truth when he said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum, I am not the man I was five years ago. Then I felt\r\nable to stand the hug of any grizzly living, and was always glad\r\nto encounter, single handed, any sort of an animal that dared\r\npresent himself. But I have been beaten to a jelly, torn almost\r\nlimb from limb, and nearly chawed up and spit out by these\r\ntreacherous grizzly bears. However, I am good for a few months\r\nyet, and by that time I hope we shall gain enough to make my old\r\nwoman comfortable, for I have been absent from her some years.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife came from Massachusetts to New York and nursed him. Dr.\r\nJohns dressed his wounds every day, and not only told Adams he\r\ncould never recover, but assured his friends that probably a very\r\nfew weeks would lay him in his grave. But Adams was as firm as\r\nadamant and as resolute as a lion. Among the thousands who saw\r\nhim dressed in his grotesque hunter's suit, and witnessed the\r\nseeming vigor with which he \"performed\" the savage monsters,\r\nbeating and whipping them into apparently the most perfect\r\ndocility, probably not one suspected that this rough,\r\nfierce-looking, powerful semi-savage, as he appeared to be, was\r\nsuffering intense pain from his broken skull and fevered system,\r\nand that nothing kept him from stretching himself on his\r\ndeath-bed but his most indomitable and extraordinary will.\r\n\r\nAdams was an inveterate story-teller, and often \"drew the long\r\nbow\" with daring hand. He loved to astonish people with\r\nextraordinary tales, which were sheer inventions, but which no\r\none could disprove. He pretended, too, to have been everywhere\r\nand to have seen everything. This weakness made him good game for\r\nBarnum, who determined to expose his foibles to him at the first\r\nopportunity. The opportunity soon came. One day, amid the\r\ninnumerable caravan of cranks that moved to the weird realm of\r\nBarnum's wonder-house, there appeared a fat, stolid German,\r\ncarrying in his hand a small basket, which he guarded with\r\njealous care.\r\n\r\n\"I have come,\" he said, \"to see if you would not like some golden\r\npigeons to buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Barnum replied, \"I would like a flock of golden pigeons,\r\nif I could buy them for their weight in silver; for there are no\r\n'golden pigeons' in existence, unless they are made from the pure\r\nmetal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall some golden pigeons alive see,\" he replied, at the\r\nsame time entering the office, and closing the door after him. He\r\nthen removed the lid from the basket, and sure enough, there were\r\nsnugly ensconced a pair of beautiful, living ruff-necked pigeons,\r\nas yellow as saffron, and as bright as a double-eagle fresh from\r\nthe Mint.\r\n\r\nBarnum was somewhat staggered at this sight, and quickly asked\r\nthe man where those birds came from. A dull, lazy smile crawled\r\nover the sober face of the German visitor, as he replied in a\r\nslow, guttural tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\"What you think yourself?\"\r\n\r\nCatching his meaning, Barnum quickly replied:\r\n\r\n\"I think it is a humbug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I know you will so say; because you 'forstha' such\r\nthings; so I shall not try to humbug you; I have them myself\r\ncolored.\"\r\n\r\nIt then came out that the man was a chemist, and that he had\r\ninvented a process by which he could dye the feathers of living\r\nbirds any color he pleased, retaining at the same time all the\r\nnatural gloss of the plumage. Barnum at once closed a bargain\r\nwith him for the birds, for ten dollars, and then put them in his\r\n\"Happy Family\" at the Museum. He marked them \"Golden Pigeons,\r\nfrom California,\" and then gleefully awaited Adams' next visit,\r\nfeeling sure that the old fellow would be completely taken in.\r\n\r\nSure enough, next morning Adams came along, saw the pigeons,\r\nlooked at them earnestly for a few minutes, and then went\r\nstraight to the office.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum,\" said he, \"you must let me have those California\r\npigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't spare them,\" said Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"But you must spare them. All the birds and animals from\r\nCalifornia ought to be together. You own half of my California\r\nmenagerie, and you must lend me those pigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams, they are too rare and valuable a bird to be hawked\r\nabout in that manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be a fool,\" replied Adams. \"Rare bird, indeed! Why,\r\nthey are just as common in California as any other pigeon! I\r\ncould have brought a hundred of them from San Francisco, if I had\r\nthought of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did you not think of it?\" with a suppressed smile.\r\n\r\n\"Because they are so common there,\" said Adams. \"I did not think\r\nthey would be any curiosity here.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum was ready to burst with laughter to see how readily Adams\r\nswallowed the bait, but, maintaining the most rigid gravity, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! well, Mr. Adams, if they are really so common in California,\r\nyou had probably better take them, and you may write over and\r\nhave half a dozen pairs sent to me for the Museum.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Barnum, being in the California Menagerie,\r\nnoticed that something ailed the pigeons. They had a\r\nsadly-mottled appearance. Their feathers had grown out, and they\r\nwere half white. Adams had not yet noticed it, being too busy\r\nwith his bears. But Barnum called him at once to the pigeon cage.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Adams,\" he said, \"I'm afraid you are going to lose\r\nyour Golden Pigeons. They must be very sick. Just see how pale\r\nthey look! Good thing they're so common in California, so you can\r\neasily get some more, eh?\"\r\n\r\nAdams looked at them a moment in astonishment, then turning to\r\nBarnum, and seeing that he could not suppress a smile, he\r\nindignantly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Blast the Golden Pigeons! You had better take them back to the\r\nMuseum. You can't humbug me with your painted pigeons!\"\r\n\r\nThis was too much, and Barnum laughed till he cried, to witness\r\nthe mixed look of astonishment and vexation which marked the\r\ngrizzly features of old Adams.\r\n\r\nAfter the exhibition on Thirteenth Street and Broadway had been\r\nopen six weeks, the doctor insisted that Adams should sell out\r\nhis share in the animals and settle up his worldly affairs, for\r\nhe assured him that he was growing weaker every day, and his\r\nearthly existence must soon terminate. \"I shall live a good deal\r\nlonger than you doctors think for,\" replied Adams, doggedly; and\r\nthen, seeming after all to realize the truth of the doctor's\r\nassertion, he turned and said: \"Well, Mr. Barnum, you must buy me\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nA bargain was soon concluded. Arrangements had been made to\r\nexhibit the bears in Connecticut and Massachusetts during the\r\nsummer, in connection with the Museum, and Adams insisted that\r\nBarnum should engage him to travel for the season and manage the\r\nbears. He offered to do it for $60 a week and expenses. Barnum\r\nreplied that he would gladly make such an arrangement, but he\r\nfeared Adams was not strong enough to stand it.\r\n\r\n\"You are growing weaker every day,\" he said; \"and would better go\r\nto your home and rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you give me extra if I will travel and exhibit the\r\nbears every day for ten weeks?\" added old Adams, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" exclaimed Adams, \"I will do it, so draw up an agreement\r\nto that effect at once. But mind you, draw it payable to my wife,\r\nfor I may be too weak to attend to business after the ten weeks\r\nare up, and if I perform my part of the contract, I want her to\r\nget the $500 without any trouble.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum drew up a contract to pay him $60 per week for his\r\nservices, and if he continued to exhibit the bears for ten\r\nconsecutive weeks, to hand him, or his wife, $500 extra.\r\n\r\n\"You have lost your $500!\" exclaimed Adams on taking the\r\ncontract; \"for I am bound to live and earn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you may, with all my heart, and a hundred years more if\r\nyou desire it,\" replied Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Call me a fool if I don't earn the $500!\" exclaimed Adams, with\r\na triumphant laugh.\r\n\r\nThe \"show\" started off in a few days, and at the end of a\r\nfortnight Barnum met it at Hartford, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\"Well\" said he, \"Adams, you seem to stand it pretty well. I hope\r\nyou and your wife are comfortable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied with a laugh; \"and you may as well try to be\r\ncomfortable, too, for your $500 is a goner.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Barnum replied, \"I hope you will grow better every\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nBut the case was hopeless. Adams was dying. When Barnum met him\r\nthree weeks later at New Bedford his eyes were glassy and his\r\nhands trembling, but his courage and will were strong as ever.\r\n\r\n\"This hot weather tells on me,\" he said, \"but I'll last the ten\r\nweeks and more, and get your $500.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum urged him to quit work, to take half of the $500 and go\r\nhome. But, no. He would not listen to it. And he did actually\r\nserve through the whole ten weeks, and got the $500; remarking,\r\nas he pocketed the cash,\r\n\r\n\"Barnum, it's too bad you're a teetotaler, for I'd like to stand\r\ntreat with you on this.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Adams set out on this last tour, Barnum had a fine new\r\nhunting-suit made of beaver-skins. He had procured it for Herr\r\nDriesbach, the animal tamer, whom he had engaged to take Adams'\r\nplace whenever the latter should give out. Adams had asked him to\r\nloan him the suit, to wear occasionally when he had great\r\naudiences, as his own suit was badly worn. Barnum did so; and at\r\nthe end of the engagement, as he received the $500, Adams said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum, I suppose you are going to give me this new\r\nhunting-dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" Barnum replied, \"I got that for your successor, who\r\nwill exhibit the bears to-morrow, besides, you have no possible\r\nuse for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't be mean, but lend me the dress, if you won't give it\r\nto me, for I want to wear it home to my native village.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum could not refuse the poor old man anything, and he\r\ntherefore replied:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Adams, I will lend you the dress, but you will send it\r\nback to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, when I have done with it,\" he replied, with an evident\r\nchuckle of triumph.\r\n\r\nBarnum thought, \"he will soon be done with it,\" and replied:\r\n\"That's all right.\"\r\n\r\nA new idea evidently struck Adams, for, with a brightening look\r\nof satisfaction, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barnum, you have made a good thing out of the California\r\nmenagerie, and so have I; but you will make a heap more. So if\r\nyou won't give me this new hunter's dress, just draw a little\r\nwriting, and sign it, saying that I may wear it until I have done\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum knew that in a few days, at longest, he would be \"done\"\r\nwith this world altogether, and, to gratify him, he cheerfully\r\ndrew and signed the paper.\r\n\r\n\"Come, old Yankee, I've got you this time--see. if I hadn't!\"\r\nexclaimed Adams, with a broad grin, as he took the paper.\r\n\r\nBarnum smiled, and said:\r\n\r\n\"All right, my dear fellow; the longer you live the better I\r\nshall like it,\"\r\n\r\nThey parted, and Adams went to Charlton, Worcester County,\r\nMassachusetts, where his wife and daughter lived. He took at once\r\nto his bed, and never rose from it again. The excitement had\r\npassed away, and his vital energies could accomplish no more, The\r\nfifth day after arriving home, the physician told him he could\r\nnot live until the next morning. He received the announcement in\r\nperfect calmness, and with the most apparent indifference; then,\r\nturning to his wife, with a smile he requested her to have him\r\nburied in the new hunting-suit. \"For,\" said he, \"Barnum agreed to\r\nlet me have it until I have done with it, and I was determined to\r\nfix his flint this time. He shall never see that dress again.\"\r\nThat dress was indeed the shroud in which he was entombed.\r\n\r\nAfter Adams' death, Barnum incorporated the California Menagerie\r\nwith the American Museum, for a time, but afterward sold most of\r\nthe animals. The Museum was now most prosperous, and Barnum was\r\nmaking steady progress toward paying off the debts that burdened\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1860 the Museum was visited by the Prince of Wales\r\nand his suite, in response to an invitation from Barnum.\r\nUnfortunately, Barnum himself had gone to Bridgeport that very\r\nmorning, the invitation not having been accepted until about an\r\nhour before the visit. Mr. Greenwood, the manager, when he heard\r\nthat the Prince was coming, caused the performance in the\r\nlecture-room to be commenced half an hour before the usual time,\r\nso as to clear the floors of a portion of the crowd, in order\r\nthat he might have a better opportunity to examine the\r\ncuriosities. When the Prince arrived, there was a great crowd\r\noutside the Museum, and hundreds more were soon added to the\r\nnumbers assembled within the building. He was received by Mr.\r\nGreenwood, and immediately conducted to the second story, where\r\nthe first object of interest pointed out was the \"What Is It?\" in\r\nwhich his Royal Highness manifested much curiosity. In compliance\r\nwith his wish, the keeper went through the regular account of the\r\nanimal. Here, also, the party were shown the Albino family,\r\nconcerning whom they made inquiries. The Siamese twins, the\r\nsea-lions, and the seal were also pointed out, and some of the\r\nanimals were fed in the presence of the Prince at his own\r\nrequest. He was conducted through the building, and his attention\r\nwas called to many objects of special interest. At the close of a\r\nshort visit, the Prince asked for Mr. Barnum, and regretted that\r\nhe had not an opportunity of seeing him also. \"We have,\" he said,\r\n\"missed the most interesting feature of the establishment.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later Barnum called on the Prince in Boston and was\r\ncordially received. The Prince was much interested and amused at\r\nBarnum's reminiscences of the visits to Buckingham Palace with\r\nTom Thumb. He told Barnum that he had been much pleased with the\r\nMuseum, and had left his autograph there as a memento of his\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. BUILDING A CITY.\r\n\r\nAT HOME ONCE MORE--GROWTH OF EAST BRIDGEPORT--BARNUM'S OFFER TO\r\nMEN WANTING HOMES OF THEIR OWN--REMARKABLE PROGRESS OF THE\r\nPLACE--HOW THE STREETS WERE NAMED.\r\n\r\nIt was now about five years since Barnum had had a settled home.\r\nThe necessities of his business combined with the adversities of\r\nfortune had kept him knocking about from pillar to post.\r\nSometimes they lived in boarding-houses, and sometimes they kept\r\nhouse in temporary quarters. Mr. and Mrs. Barnum were now alone,\r\ntwo of their daughters being married and the third being away at\r\na boarding-school. Mrs. Barnum's health was much impaired, and it\r\nwas desirable that she should have a comfortable and permanent\r\nhome. Accordingly, in 1860, Barnum built a pleasant house at\r\nBridgeport, next to that of his daughter Caroline and not far\r\nfrom the ruins of Iranistan.\r\n\r\nHis unfortunate enterprise in the clock business had not\r\ndiscouraged him from further business ventures. His pet city,\r\nEast Bridgeport, was growing rapidly. An enormous sewing-machine\r\nfactory had been built, employing a thousand workmen. Other large\r\nfactories were springing up, many private residences were being\r\nerected, and there was a great demand for houses of all kinds,\r\nbut especially for small cottages suitable for mechanics and\r\nother laboring men. The farm-land which Barnum had purchased only\r\na few years before was rapidly becoming a city.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Barnum to place himself in the forefront\r\nin this city-building movement, and in the double role of\r\nspeculator and public benefactor. The enterprise which he\r\nundertook was calculated both to help those who were willing to\r\nhelp themselves to obtain independent homes, and at the same time\r\nto pay a handsome profit to Mr. Barnum. His scheme was described\r\nby himself as follows in the Bridgeport Standard:\r\n\r\n          \"NEW HOUSES IN EAST BRIDGEPORT.\r\n\"EVERY MAN TO OWN THE HOUSE HE LIVES IN.\r\n\r\n\"There is a demand at the present moment for two hundred more\r\ndwelling-houses in East Bridgeport. It is evident that if the\r\nmoney expended in rent can be paid towards the purchase of a\r\nhouse and lot, the person so paying will in a few years own the\r\nhouse he lives in, instead of always remaining a tenant. In view\r\nof this fact, I propose to loan money at six per cent. to any\r\nnumber, not exceeding fifty, industrious, temperate and\r\nrespectable individuals, who desire to build their own houses.\r\n\r\n\"They may engage their own builders, and build according to any\r\nreasonable plan (which I may approve), or I will have it done for\r\nthem at the lowest possible rate, without a farthing profit to\r\nmyself or agent, I putting the lot at a fair price and advancing\r\neighty per cent. of the entire cost; the other party to furnish\r\ntwenty per cent. in labor, material, or money, and they may pay\r\nme in small sums weekly, monthly, or quarterly, any amount not\r\nless than three per cent. per quarter, all of which is to apply\r\non the money advanced until it is paid.\r\n\r\n\"It has been ascertained that by purchasing building materials\r\nfor cash, and in large quantities, nice dwellings, painted, and\r\nfurnished with green blinds, can be erected at a cost of $1,500\r\nor $1,800, for house, lot, fences, etc., all complete, and if six\r\nor eight friends prefer to join in erecting a neat block of\r\nhouses with verandas in front, the average cost need not exceed\r\nabout $1,300 per house and lot. If, however, some parties would\r\nprefer a single or double house that would cost $2,500 to $3,000,\r\nI shall be glad to meet their views.\r\n        \"P. T. BARNUM.      \"February 16, 1864.\"\r\n\r\nOn this the editor of the paper commented as follows:\r\n\r\n\"AN ADVANTAGEOUS OFFER.--We have read with great pleasure Mr.\r\nBarnum's advertisement, offering assistance to any number of\r\npersons, not exceeding fifty, in the erection of dwelling-houses.\r\nThis plan combines all the advantages and none of the objections\r\nof building associations. Any individual who can furnish in cash,\r\nlabor, or material, one-fifth only of the amount requisite for\r\nthe erection of a dwelling-house, can receive the other\r\nfour-fifths from Mr. Barnum, rent his house, and by merely paying\r\nwhat may be considered as only a fair rent, for a few years, find\r\nhimself at last the owner, and all further payments cease. In the\r\nmeantime, he can be making such inexpensive improvements in his\r\nproperty as would greatly increase its market value, and besides\r\nhave the advantage of any rise in the value of real estate. It is\r\nnot often that such a generous offer is made to working men. It\r\nis a loan on what would be generally considered inadequate\r\nsecurity, at six per cent., at a time when a much better use of\r\nmoney can be made by any capitalist. It is therefore generous.\r\nMr. Barnum may make money by the operation. Very well, perhaps he\r\nwill, but if he does, it will be by making others richer, not\r\npoorer; by helping those who need assistance, not by hindering\r\nthem, and we can only wish that every rich man would follow such\r\na noble example, and thus, without injury to themselves, give a\r\nhelping hand to those who need it. Success to the enterprise. We\r\nhope that fifty men will be found before the week ends, each of\r\nwhom desires in such a manner to obtain a roof which he can call\r\nhis own.\"\r\n\r\nA considerable number of men immediately availed themselves of\r\nBarnum's offer, and succeeded after a time in paying for their\r\nhomes without much effort. There were many others, however, who\r\ndid not fully accept his proposals. They would not sign the\r\ntemperance pledge, and they would not give up the use of tobacco.\r\nThe result was, that they continued month after month and year\r\nafter year to pay rent on hired tenements. \"The money they have\r\nexpended for whiskey and tobacco,\" remarked Mr. Barnum,\r\nmoralizing upon this topic, \"would have given them homes of their\r\nown if it had been devoted to that object, and their positions,\r\nsocially and morally, would have been far better. How many\r\ninfatuated men there are in all parts of the country who could\r\nnow be independent, and even owners of their own carriages, but\r\nfor their slavery to these miserable habits!\"\r\n\r\nThis East Bridgeport land was originally purchased by Barnum at\r\nan average cost of about $200 per acre. A few years after the\r\nabove-described enterprise, a considerable part of it was\r\nassessed in the tax list at from $3,000 to $4,000 per acre. It\r\nwas presently annexed to the city, and connected with it by three\r\nbridges across the river. A horse-railroad was also built, of\r\nwhich Mr. Barnum was one of the original stockholders.\r\n\r\nThis part of the city was laid out by General Noble and Mr.\r\nBarnum, and various streets were named after members of the two\r\nfamilies. Hence there are Noble street, Barnum street, William\r\nstreet (General Noble's first name), Harriet street (Mrs. Noble's\r\nname), Hallett street (Mrs. Barnum's maiden name), and Caroline\r\nstreet, Helen street, and Pauline street, the names of Barnum's\r\nthree daughters. A public school was also named for Mr. Barnum.\r\nThe streets were lined with beautiful shade trees, set out by\r\nthousands by Barnum; and Noble, and the same gentlemen gave to\r\nthe city its beautiful Washington Park of seven acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. GREAT YEAR AT THE MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nCAPTURING AND EXHIBITING WHITE WHALES NEWSPAPER COMMENTS--A\r\nTOUCHING OBITUARY--THE GREAT BEHEMOTH--A LONG \"LAST\r\nWEEK\"--COMMODORE NUTT--REAL LIVE INDIANS ON EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\nThe year 1861 was notable in the history of the American Museum.\r\nBarnum heard that some fishermen at the mouth of the St. Lawrence\r\nriver had captured alive a fine white whale. He was also told\r\nthat such an animal, if packed in a box filled with sea-weed and\r\nsalt water, could be transported over land a considerable\r\ndistance without danger to its life or health. He accordingly\r\ndetermined to secure and place on exhibition in his Museum a\r\ncouple of live whales. So he built in the basement of the\r\nbuilding a tank of masonry, forty feet long and eighteen feet\r\nwide, to contain them. Then he went to the St. Lawrence river on\r\na whaling expedition. His objective point was the Isle au\r\nCoudres, which was populated by French Canadians. There he\r\nengaged a party of twenty-four fishermen, and instructed them to\r\ncapture for him, alive and unharmed, a couple of the white whales\r\nwhich at almost any time were to be seen in the water not far\r\nfrom the island.\r\n\r\nThe plan decided upon was to plant in the river a \"kraal,\"\r\ncomposed of stakes driven down in the form of a V, leaving the\r\nbroad end open for the whales to enter. This was done in a\r\nshallow place, with the point of the kraal towards shore; and if\r\nby chance one or more whales should enter the trap at high water,\r\nthe fishermen were to occupy the entrance with their boats, and\r\nkeep up a tremendous splashing and noise till the tide receded,\r\nwhen the frightened whales would find themselves nearly \"high and\r\ndry,\" or with too little water to enable them to swim, and their\r\ncapture would be next thing in order. This was to be effected by\r\nsecuring a slip-noose of stout rope over their tails, and towing\r\nthem to the sea-weed lined boxes in which they were to be\r\ntransported to New York.\r\n\r\nMany times fine whales were seen gliding close by the entrance to\r\nthe trap, but they did not enter it, and the patience of Barnum\r\nand his fishermen was sorely tried. One day one whale did enter\r\nthe kraal, and the fishermen proposed to capture it, but Barnum\r\nwas determined to have two, and while they waited for the second\r\none to enter the first one went out again. After several days of\r\nwaiting, Barnum was aroused early one morning by the excited and\r\ndelighted shouts of his men. Hastily dressing, he found that two\r\nwhales were in the trap and were sure of being captured. Leaving\r\nthe rest of the task to his assistants, he hurried back to New\r\nYork. At every station on the route he gave instructions to the\r\ntelegraph operators to take off all whaling messages that passed\r\nover the wires to New York, and to inform their fellow-townsmen\r\nat what hour the whales would pass through each place.\r\n\r\nThe result of these arrangements may be imagined; at every\r\nstation crowds of people came to the cars to see the whales which\r\nwere travelling by land to Barnum's Museum, and those who did not\r\nsee the monsters with their own eyes, at least saw some one who\r\nhad seen them, and thus was secured a tremendous advertisement,\r\nseven hundred miles long, for the American Museum.\r\n\r\nArrived in New York, dispatches continued to come from the\r\nwhaling expedition every few hours. These were bulletined in\r\nfront of the Museum and copies sent to the papers. The excitement\r\nwas intense, and, when at last, these marine monsters arrived and\r\nwere swimming in the tank that had been prepared for them,\r\nanxious thousands literally rushed to see the strangest\r\ncuriosities ever exhibited in New York.\r\n\r\nBarnum's first whaling expedition was thus a great success.\r\nUnfortunately he did not know how to feed or take care of the\r\nanimals. A supply of salt water could not be obtained, so they\r\nwere put into fresh water artificially salted, and this did not\r\nagree with them. The basement of the Museum building was also\r\npoorly ventilated and the air was unwholesome. As the result of\r\nthese circumstances the whales died within a week, although not\r\nuntil they had been seen by thousands of people. Barnum\r\nimmediately resolved to try again. In order to secure a better\r\nhome for his pets, he laid an iron pipe under the streets of the\r\ncity, from his Museum clear out into New York bay. Through this,\r\nby means of a steam-engine, he was able to secure a constant\r\nsupply of genuine sea-water. In order that the whales should have\r\ngood air to breathe, he constructed for them another tank on the\r\nsecond floor of the Museum building. This tank had a floor of\r\nslate, and the sides were made of French plate-glass, in huge\r\npieces six feet long, five feet wide, and one inch thick. These\r\nplates were imported by Barnum expressly for the purpose. The\r\ntank was twenty-four feet square. Two more white whales were soon\r\ncaught in the same manner as before, and were conveyed in a ship\r\nto Quebec and thence by rail to New York.\r\n\r\nBarnum was always proud of this enterprise, and it yielded him\r\nhandsome profits. The second pair of whales, however, soon died.\r\nBarnum remarked that their sudden and immense popularity was too\r\nmuch for them. But a third pair was quickly secured to take their\r\nplace. Envious and hostile critics declared that they were not\r\nwhales at all, but only porpoises, but this did no harm. Indeed,\r\nBarnum might well have paid them to start these malicious\r\nreports, for much good advertising was thereby secured. The\r\nillustrious Agassiz was appealed to. He came to see the animals,\r\ngave Barnum a certificate that they were genuine white whales,\r\nand this document was published far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the showman advertised his curiosities may be\r\nseen from the following, taken from one of the daily papers of\r\nthe time:\r\n\r\nBARNUM'S AMERICAN MUSEUM. ----After months of unwearied labor,\r\nand spending NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS NEARLY TEN THOUSAND\r\nDOLLARS NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS\r\n\r\nin capturing and transporting them from that part of the Gulf of\r\nSt. Lawrence nearest Labrador, the Manager is enabled to offer\r\nhis visitors\r\n\r\nTWO LIVING WHALES, TWO LIVING WHALES, TWO LIVING WHALES, TWO\r\nLIVING WHALES, TWO LIVING WHALES, TWO LIVING WHALES,\r\n\r\na male and a female.

T. BARNUM.--LIVING WHALES on exhibition.--Having\r\nlearned from fishermen and eminent naturalists, including the\r\nwritten statement of the celebrated Prof. Agassiz, that the White\r\nWhale could be found in that portion of the Gulf of St. Lawrence\r\nnearest to Labrador, I made a journey there in June last,\r\naccompanied by my agent. I remained there a fortnight, and made\r\nevery arrangement for capturing and keeping alive two of these\r\nmonsters. This arrangement included the service of thirty-five\r\nmen, beside my special agent. I then returned and had erected in\r\nthe Museum a reservoir fifty feet in length and twenty-five feet\r\nin width, in which was placed sea-water, and arrangements made\r\nfor a continual fresh supply. I also made arrangements with\r\nsteamers and railroads to convey these leviathans to New York at\r\nthe fastest possible speed, without regard to the expense.\r\n\r\nI am highly gratified in being able to assure the public that\r\nthey have arrived safe and well, a MALE and FEMALE, from 15 to 20\r\nfeet long, and are now swimming in the miniature ocean in my\r\nMuseum, to the delight of visitors. As it is very doubtful\r\nwhether these wonderful creatures can be kept alive more than a\r\nfew days, the public will see the importance of seizing the first\r\nmoment to see them.\r\n                        P. T. BARNUM.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN MUSEUM, Thursday, August 8, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"A real live whale,\" said an editorial writer in the New York\r\nTribune of that date, \"is as great a curiosity as a live lord or\r\nprince, being much more difficult to catch, and far more\r\nwonderful in its appearance and habits. After all people are\r\npeople, and have much the same ways of feeling and doing. But\r\nwhen we get among the whales, we catch glimpses of a new and neat\r\nthing in nose, recall the narrative of Jonah without throwing a\r\nshadow of a doubt upon its authenticity, and appreciate keenly\r\nthe difficulties with which mermaid society must have to contend.\r\n\r\n\"We owe the presence of two whales in our midst to the enterprise\r\nof Mr. P. T. Barnum. He has had them in tow for a long while, but\r\nhas kept his secret well, and it was not until his own special\r\nwhaler telegraphed from Troy that he had come so far into the\r\nbowels of the earth with his submarine charge, and all well, that\r\nhe felt warranted in whispering whale to the public. The public\r\nwas delighted, but not surprised, because it feels that the\r\ngenius that is equal to a What Is It is also equal to the biggest\r\nthing, and would experience no unusual thrill of wonder if a real\r\niceberg, or a section of the identical North Pole, should be\r\nannounced on the bills of the Museum.\r\n\r\n\"But flocks of the public sought the Museum yesterday, and were\r\nnot disappointed. They saw not, as Polonius, something 'very like\r\na whale,' but the original animal in its original element. The\r\nbears, and the anacondas, the hatchet, and the seal, sank into\r\nmerited insignificance, although they will have their day again\r\nif the whales should expire. The transfer of the fish was neatly\r\neffected. They travelled the whole distance in first-class\r\nhermetical boxes, filled with water and thickly lined with\r\nseaweed, and were landed, if the expression may be used, in the\r\nnew and excellent tank provided for them in the basement of the\r\nMuseum. This tank is fifty feet deep and twenty-five in width,\r\nhas seven feet of sea-water in it, and seems to suit the whales\r\neminently. Mr. Barnum has fears that the pets will have but a\r\nbrief, if brilliant, career, in their new quarters, but we prefer\r\nto predict for them a long and happy one.\r\n\r\n\"These are white whales, and were taken near the Labrador coast\r\nby a crew of thirty-five men. The largest has attained the\r\nextreme size reached by this species, and is about 22 feet long;\r\nthe other is 18 feet long. Their form and motion are graceful,\r\nand their silver backs and bellies show brightly through the\r\nwater. A long-continued intimacy has endeared them to each other,\r\nand they go about quite like a pair of whispering lovers, blowing\r\noff their mutual admiration in a very emphatic manner. Just at\r\npresent they are principally engaged in throwing their eyes\r\naround the premises, and pay small attention to visitors, upon\r\nwhom, indeed, the narrative of Jonah has a strong hold. And yet\r\nneither of these whales could make a single mouthful of a man of\r\nordinary size. Even if one of them should succeed in swallowing a\r\nman, he could just stand up with the whale, and make it, at\r\nleast, as uncomfortable as himself.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a real 'sensation.' We do not believe the enterprise of\r\nMr. Barnum will stop at white whales. It will embrace sperm\r\nwhales and mermaids, and all strange things that swim or fly or\r\ncrawl, until the Museum will become one vast microcosm of the\r\nanimal creation. A quarter seems positively contemptible weighed\r\nagainst such a treat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this was the public tribute, from the same pen, to the first\r\nof the cetaceans that died through too much publicity:\r\n\r\n\"The community was shocked to hear of the death of one of\r\nBarnum's whales yesterday morning. Death apparently loves a\r\nshining mark. It seems but yesterday--in fact it was the day\r\nbefore--we gazed upon the youthful form, instinct with life, and\r\nlooking forward to a useful and pleasant career. The whale shared\r\nnot the forebodings of its friends. Mr. Barnum was possessed with\r\na strange presentiment of calamity, and summoned the public to\r\neither a house of mourning or a house of joy, he knew not which,\r\nbut at all events to be quick. At daybreak, we believe, the great\r\nnatural curiosity passed away.\r\n\r\n\"The blow is a severe one. To Mr. Barnum it must be a shocking\r\nreminder of the emptiness of all human plans. Enterprise, liberal\r\nexpenditure, courage--what are they all before the fell\r\ndestroyer? Even whales have their time to sink and rise no more.\r\nTo the dear companion of all the joys and sorrows of the troubled\r\nlife of the deceased the bereavement must be sore indeed.\r\nDelicacy forbids that we should lay bare such sorrows. No\r\ntwenty-five cent ticket should admit to them, including the\r\nlecture-room. Such as witnessed the tender endearments between\r\nthese white whales, and saw how they had hearts that beat as one,\r\nand how they were not happy when they were not pretty near each\r\nother in the tank, may, perhaps, realize the anguish of their\r\nseparation. We are not surprised to learn, indeed, that the\r\naffliction has borne so heavily upon the survivor that there may\r\nbe tidings at any moment of the flight of its spirit also. May\r\nboth whales meet again in the open seas of immortality! The loss\r\nof the public is great, although not irreparable. The world moves\r\non, and many natural curiosities remain to fill up the gaps\r\ncaused by death. Mr. Barnum's spirit, although saddened, is not\r\nbroken. He sees the objects of his care and best management\r\nsnatched from him, and yet he announces that he will immediately\r\nsend on for two more whales of the same sort. We shall soon\r\nforget the lost whales in contemplation of the new. Such is life,\r\nit is well known.\r\n\r\n\"The decease may be attributed in a great measure to bear. It is\r\ntrue that there might have been something injurious to the health\r\nof the fish in a long overland journey. 'A fish out of water' is\r\na case that tries the utmost skill of the faculty. If a man were\r\nconfined in the most comfortable of water-tight boxes and\r\ncarried, under the care of a special agent, hundreds of miles\r\nbeneath the water, we should not be startled to hear that his\r\nconstitution was much shattered at the end of the journey. And\r\nyet we are more encouraged to think that the whale owed his death\r\nto other causes than the overland transportation, because the sea\r\nlion does so well, and the fishes in the aquaria appear to be so\r\nhearty and contented. To bear, then, we must attribute our loss.\r\nThis animal abounded in the basement where the tank is, and\r\nwhether through jealousy of the fame of the new-comers, or\r\nthrough some settled antipathy between flesh and fish, or simply\r\nthrough his natural beastliness, he communicated effluvia to the\r\natmosphere that were perfectly unendurable by whale, which\r\npromptly expired from want of good breath.\r\n\r\n\"This agent of destruction will be removed from the premises\r\nbefore the next whales arrive, and suitable measures will be\r\ntaken to guard against such a mournful catastrophe. There is a\r\nwhale in Boston whose health is so good that it never requires\r\nmedical attendance.\r\n\r\n\"The deceased was about sixty years of age. It bore an excellent\r\ncharacter. Its patience and sweet disposition under the most\r\ntrying circumstances will long be remembered. The remains,\r\nweighing not less than twenty-six hundred pounds, will be\r\nsuitably disposed off. While the public mourns it may also\r\nconsole itself with the reflection that there are plenty more\r\nwhere it came from, and that the energy of Barnum is not to be\r\nabated by any of the common disasters of life, and may hopefully\r\nanticipate a speedy announcement of an entirely new whale. Vale!\r\nVale!\"\r\n\r\nThe tank in the basement of the Museum was now devoted to a yet\r\nmore interesting exhibition. On August 12, 1861, Barnum placed in\r\nit the first live hippopotamus that had ever been seen in\r\nAmerica. The brute was advertised most extensively and\r\ningeniously as \"the great behemoth of the Scriptures,\" and\r\nthousands of scientific men, biblical students, clergymen and\r\nothers, besides the great host of the common people, flocked to\r\nsee it. There was fully as much excitement in New York over this\r\nwonder in the animal creation as there was in London when the\r\nfirst hippopotamus was placed in the Regent's Park \"Zoo.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum began by advertising that the animal was on exhibition for\r\na short time only. Then he announced the \"last week\" of the novel\r\nshow. Then, \"by special request,\" another week was added. And\r\nthus the \"last week of the hippopotamus\" was prolonged through\r\nmany months. The following is a fair sample of the advertisements\r\nwith which the daily papers literally teemed:\r\n\r\nBARNUM'S MUSEUM ----SECOND WEEK OF THAT WONDERFUL LIVING\r\nHIPPOPOTAMUS,\r\n\r\nFROM THE RIVER NILE IN EGYPT THE GREAT BEHEMOTH OF THE SCRIPTURES\r\nAND THE MARVEL OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nThe history of this animal is full of interest, and to every\r\nclass, especially the educated and intelligent, but above all to\r\nthe biblical student, who has read with interest the glowing\r\ndescription of\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BEHEMOTH\r\n\r\nin the Book of Job. He is strictly an\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL,\r\n\r\nliving in the water and out of it; under the water, or on the top\r\nof it, floats on its surface with perfect ease, or beneath the\r\nsurface, midway between the top and the bottom. In their natural\r\nstate these animals are wild and ferocious; though on the land,\r\nthey are not very formidable, but when pursued they fly to the\r\nrivers,\r\n\r\nDESCEND TO THE BOTTOM AND WALK ACROSS,\r\n\r\nfrequently appearing on the opposite side without the least\r\nindication of their course on the surface of the stream. If\r\nexasperated by assaults, in the water they are the most\r\n\r\nFRIGHTFUL ANTAGONISTS,\r\n\r\ntheir gigantic proportions and herculean strength, giving them\r\npower over every opposing force, frequently destroying whole\r\nboat-loads of men and their boats, crushing with their huge jaws\r\neverything that comes in their way. In the Museum the specimen\r\nhere exhibited has an\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL OCEAN OR RIVER,\r\n\r\nwhere he is to be seen in all his natural peculiarities, floating\r\non, and swiming beneath the surface, walking on the bottom\r\nseveral feet beneath, exhibiting, in short, all the peculiarities\r\nof his nature; and to perfect the scene, native\r\n\r\nARABIAN KEEPER, SALAAMA,\r\n\r\nwho is himself a curiosity as a specimen of that historic tribe\r\nof men, who exhibits all the stolidity and Arabian dignity of\r\nthat Oriental race; the only man who can control or exhibit his\r\nhippopotamiship, is in constant attendance. They are both to be\r\nseen at all hours, DAY and EVENING.\r\n\r\nThis is the\r\n\r\nFIRST AND ONLY REAL HIPPOPOTAMUS\r\n\r\never seen in America. He is engaged at a cost of many thousand of\r\ndollars, and will remain\r\n\r\nA SHORT TIME ONLY. A SHORT TIME ONLY.\r\n\r\nAlso just obtained at great expense, and now to be seen swimming\r\nin the large tank in the Aquarial Hall,\r\n\r\nA LIVING SHARK,\r\n\r\nbeside a great variety of other living Fish, Turtles, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS IT?

Said one writer: \"Nothing discomfitted by the sudden death\r\nthat overtook the gentle and loving whales, Mr. Barnum has again\r\ninvested untold heaps of money in a tremendous water-monster. The\r\ngreat tank has again a tenant, and the great public have huge\r\namphibious matter for their wonderment. The new curiosity comes\r\nto us staggering under the unwieldy name of Hippo-potamus. He is\r\na comely gentleman, fair and beauteous to look upon; and the\r\nstrange loveliness of his countenance cannot fail to captivate\r\nthe crowd. His youth, too, gives him a special claim to the\r\nconsideration of the ladies, for he is a little darling of only\r\nthree years--a very baby of a hippopotamus in fact, who, only a\r\nfew months ago, daily sucked his few gallons of lacteal\r\nnourishment from the fond bosom of mamma Hippo, at the bottom of\r\nsome murmuring Egyptian river. The young gentleman is about as\r\nheavy as an ox, and gives you the idea that he is the result of\r\nthe amalgamation of a horse, a cow, two pigs, a seal, a dozen\r\nIndia-rubber blankets, and an old-fashioned horse-hide covered\r\ntrunk. Big as he is, unwieldy as he is, strange, uncouth, and\r\nmonstrous as he is, he appears after all to be most mild and\r\neven-tempered. In truth, he is no more vicious than a\r\ngood-natured muley cow; and if by chance he should hurt anybody,\r\nhe would have to achieve it much in the same manner that such a\r\ncow would, by running against him, or rolling over upon him. So\r\nthat the red-breeched individual, who so valiantly gets over the\r\nrailing and stands by the side of young Hippo, doesn't, after\r\nall, do a deed of such superhuman daring, for all he does it with\r\nsuch an air of reckless sacrifice of self for the public good.\r\nThe hippopotamus is certainly one of the most interesting and\r\nattractive of all the strange creatures ever yet caught by Mr.\r\nBarnum, and offered for the delectation of the paying public. He\r\nis well worth a visit, and an hour's inspection. He receives\r\ndaily, from 9 A.M. to some time after dark.\"\r\n\r\nHaving now a good supply of salt water Barnum greatly enlarged\r\nhis aquarium, which was the first show of the kind ever seen in\r\nAmerica. He exhibited in it living sharks, porpoises, sea-horses\r\nand many rare fishes. For several seasons he kept a boat cruising\r\nthe ocean in search of marine novelties. In this way he secured\r\nmany of the beautiful angel fishes and others that never had been\r\nseen in New York before. He also purchased the Aquarial Gardens\r\nin Boston, and removed the entire collection to his Museum.\r\n\r\nThe story of another of Barnum's greatest hits must be told in\r\nhis own words: \"In December, 1861,\" he related, \"I was visited at\r\nthe Museum by a most remarkable dwarf, who was a sharp,\r\nintelligent little fellow, with a deal of drollery and wit. He\r\nhad a splendid head, was perfectly formed, and was very\r\nattractive, and, in short, for a 'showman,' he was a perfect\r\ntreasure. His name, he told me, was George Washington Morrison\r\nNutt, and his father was Major Rodnia Nutt, a substantial farmer,\r\nof Manchester, New Hampshire. I was not long in dispatching an\r\nefficient agent to Manchester, and in overcoming the competition\r\nwith other showmen who were equally eager to secure this\r\nextraordinary pigmy. The terms upon which I engaged him for three\r\nyears were so large that he was christened the $30,000 Nutt; I,\r\nin the meantime, conferring upon him the title of Commodore. As\r\nsoon as I engaged him, placards, posters and the columns of the\r\nnewspapers proclaimed the presence of 'Commodore Nutt' at the\r\nMuseum. I also procured for the Commodore a pair of Shetland\r\nponies, miniature coachman and footman, in livery, gold-mounted\r\nharness, and an elegant little carriage, which, when closed,\r\nrepresented a gigantic English walnut. The little Commodore\r\nattracted great attention, and grew rapidly in public favor.\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb was then travelling in the South and West. For\r\nsome years he had not been exhibited in New York, and during\r\nthese years he had increased considerably in rotundity and had\r\nchanged much in his general appearance. It was a singular fact,\r\nhowever, that Commodore Nutt was almost a fac-simile of General\r\nTom Thumb, as he looked half-a-dozen years before. Consequently,\r\nvery many of my patrons, not making allowance for the time which\r\nhad elapsed since they had last seen the General, declared that\r\nthere was no such person as 'Commodore Nutt;' but that I was\r\nexhibiting my old friend Tom Thumb under a new name.\r\n\r\n\"Commodore Nutt enjoyed the joke very much. He would sometimes\r\nhalf admit the deception, simply to add to the bewilderment of\r\nthe doubting portion of my visitors.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that here was an opportunity to turn all doubts\r\ninto hard cash, by simply bringing the two dwarf Dromios\r\ntogether, and showing them on the same platform. I therefore\r\ninduced Tom Thumb to bring his Western engagements to a close,\r\nand to appear for four weeks, beginning with August 11, 1862, in\r\nmy Museum. Announcements headed 'The Two Dromios,' and 'Two\r\nSmallest Men, and Greatest Curiosities Living,' as I expected,\r\ndrew large crowds to see them, and many came especially to solve\r\ntheir doubts with regard to the genuineness of the 'Nutt.' But\r\nhere I was considerably nonplussed, for, astonishing as it may\r\nseem, the doubts of many of the visitors were confirmed! The\r\nsharp people who were determined 'not to be humbugged, anyhow,'\r\nstill declared that Commodore Nutt was General Tom Thumb, and\r\nthat the little fellow whom I was trying to pass off as Tom\r\nThumb, was no more like the General than he was like the man in\r\nthe moon. It is very amusing to see how people will sometimes\r\ndeceive themselves by being too incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"In 1862 I sent the Commodore to Washington, and, joining him\r\nthere, I received an invitation from President Lincoln to call at\r\nthe White House with my little friend. Arriving at the appointed\r\nhour, I was informed that the President was in a special Cabinet\r\nmeeting, but that he had left word if I called to be shown in to\r\nhim with the Commodore. These were dark days in the rebellion,\r\nand I felt that my visit, if not ill-timed, must at all events be\r\nbrief. When we were admitted, Mr. Lincoln received us cordially,\r\nand introduced us to the members of the Cabinet. When Mr. Chase\r\nwas introduced as the Secretary of the Treasury, the little\r\nCommodore remarked:\r\n\r\n\" 'I suppose you are the gentleman who is spending so much of\r\nUncle Sam's money?'\r\n\r\n\" 'No, indeed,' said the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, very\r\npromptly; 'I am spending the money.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Well,' said Commodore Nutt, 'it is in a good cause, anyhow,\r\nand I guess it will come out all right.'\r\n\r\n\"His apt remark created much amusement. Mr. Lincoln then bent\r\ndown his long, lank body, and taking Nutt by the hand, he said:\r\n\r\n\" 'Commodore, permit me to give you a parting word of advice.\r\nWhen you are in command of your fleet, if you find yourself in\r\ndanger of being taken prisoner, I advise you to wade ashore.'\r\n\r\nThe Commodore found the laugh was against him, but placing\r\nhimself at the side of the President, and gradually raising his\r\neyes up the whole length of Mr. Lincoln's very long legs, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\" 'I guess, Mr. President, you could do that better than I\r\ncould.' \"\r\n\r\nIn no place did extremes ever meet in a more practical sense than\r\nin the American Museum. Commodore Nutt was the shortest of men;\r\nand at the same time the Museum contained the tallest of women.\r\nHer name was Anna Swan, and she came from Nova Scotia. Barnum\r\nfirst heard of her through a Quaker, who was visiting the Museum.\r\nThis visitor came to Barnum's office, and told him of a wonderful\r\ngirl, only seventeen years old, who lived near him at Pictou.\r\nBarnum soon sent an agent up there, who brought the young lady\r\nback to New York. She was an intelligent girl, and, despite her\r\nenormous stature, was decidedly good-looking. For a long time she\r\nwas a leading attraction at Barnum's Museum, and afterwards went\r\nto England and attracted great attention there.\r\n\r\nFor many years Barnum had been in the habit of engaging parties\r\nof American Indians from the far West to exhibit at the Museum.\r\nHe had also sent several parties of them to Europe, where they\r\nwere regarded as extraordinary curiosities.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 ten or twelve chiefs, of as many different tribes,\r\nvisited the President of the United States, at Washington. By a\r\npretty liberal outlay of money, Barnum succeeded in inducing the\r\ninterpreter to bring them to New York, and to pass some days at\r\nthe Museum. Of course, getting these Indians to dance, or to give\r\nany illustration of their games or pastimes, was out of the\r\nquestion. They were real chiefs of powerful tribes, and would no\r\nmore have consented to give an exhibition of themselves than the\r\nchief magistrate of our own nation would have done. Their\r\ninterpreter could not therefore promise that they would remain at\r\nthe Museum for any definite time; \"for,\" said he, \"you can only\r\nkeep them just so long as they suppose all your patrons come to\r\npay them visits of honor. If they suspected that your Museum was\r\na place where people paid for entering,\" he continued, \"you could\r\nnot keep them a moment after the discovery.\"\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the Museum, therefore, Barnum took them upon\r\nthe stage and personally introduced them to the public. The\r\nIndians liked this attention from him, as they had been informed\r\nthat he was the proprietor of the great establishment in which\r\nthey were invited and honored guests. His patrons were of course\r\npleased to see these old chiefs, as they knew they were the \"REAL\r\nthing,\" and several of them were known to the public, either as\r\nbeing friendly or cruel to the whites. After one or two\r\nappearances on the stage, Barnum took them in carriages and\r\nvisited the Mayor of New York in the Governor's room at the City\r\nHall. Here the Mayor made them a speech of welcome, which, being\r\ninterpreted to the savages, was responded to by a speech from one\r\nof the chiefs, in which he thanked the \"Great Father\" of the city\r\nfor his pleasant words, and for his kindness in pointing out the\r\nportraits of his predecessors hanging on the walls of the\r\nGovernor's room.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Barnum took them by special invitation to\r\nvisit one of the large public schools up town. The teachers were\r\npleased to see them, and arranged an exhibition of special\r\nexercises by the scholars, which they thought would be most\r\nlikely to gratify their barbaric visitors. At the close of these\r\nexercises, one old chief arose, and simply said: \"This is all new\r\nto us. We are mere unlearned sons of the forest, and cannot\r\nunderstand what we have seen and heard.\"\r\n\r\nOn other occasions he took them to ride in Central Park, and\r\nthrough different portions of the city. At every street-corner\r\nwhich they passed they would express their astonishment to each\r\nother, at seeing the long rows of houses which extended both ways\r\non either side of each cross-street. Of course, after each of\r\nthese outside visits Barnum would return with them to the Museum,\r\nand secure two or three appearances upon the stage to receive the\r\npeople who had there congregated \"to do them honor.\"\r\n\r\nAs they regarded him as their host, they did not hesitate to\r\ntrespass upon his hospitality. Whenever their eyes rested upon a\r\nglittering shell among his specimens of conchology, especially if\r\nit had several brilliant colors, one would take off his coat,\r\nanother his shirt, and insist that he should exchange the shell\r\nfor the garment. When he declined the exchange, but on the\r\ncontrary presented the coveted article, he soon found he had\r\nestablished a dangerous precedent. Immediately they all commenced\r\nto beg for everything in the vast collection which they happened\r\nto take a liking to. This cost Barnum many valuable specimens,\r\nand often \"put him to his trumps\" for an excuse to avoid giving\r\nthem things which he could not part with.\r\n\r\nThe chief of one of the tribes one day discovered an ancient\r\nshirt of chain-mail which hung in one of the cases of antique\r\narmor. He was delighted with it, and declared he must have it.\r\nBarnum tried all sorts of excuses to prevent his getting it, for\r\nit had cost a hundred dollars, and was a great curiosity. But the\r\nold man's eyes glistened, and he would not take \"no\" for an\r\nanswer. \"The Utes have killed my little child,\" he said through\r\nthe interpreter; and now he must have this steel shirt to protect\r\nhimself; and when he returned to the Rocky Mountains he would\r\nhave his revenge. Barnum remained inexorable until the chief\r\nfinally brought a new buckskin Indian suit, which he insisted\r\nupon exchanging. Barnum then felt compelled to accept his\r\nproposal; and never did anyone see a man more delighted than the\r\nIndian seemed to be when he took the mailed shirt into his hands.\r\nHe fairly jumped up and down with joy. He ran to his\r\nlodging-room, and soon appeared again with the coveted armor upon\r\nhis body, and marched down one of the main halls of the Museum,\r\nwith folded arms, and head erect, occasionally patting his breast\r\nwith his right hand, as much as to say, \"Now, Mr. Ute, look\r\nsharp, for I will soon be on the war-path!\"\r\n\r\nAmong these Indians were War Bonnet, Lean Bear, and\r\nHand-in-the-water, chiefs of the Cheyennes; Yellow Buffalo, of\r\nthe Kiowas; Yellow Bear, of the same tribe; Jacob, of the Caddos;\r\nand White Bull, of the Apaches. The little wiry chief known as\r\nYellow Bear had killed many whites as they had travelled through\r\nthe \"far West.\" He was a sly, treacherous, bloodthirsty savage,\r\nwho would think no more of scalping a family of women and\r\nchildren than a butcher would of wringing the neck of a chicken.\r\nBut now he was on a mission to the \"Great Father\" at Washington,\r\nseeking for presents and favors for his tribe, and he pretended\r\nto be exceedingly meek and humble, and continually urged the\r\ninterpreter to announce him as a \"great friend to the white man.\"\r\nHe would fawn about Barnum, and although not speaking or\r\nunderstanding a word of our language, would try to convince him\r\nthat he loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nIn exhibiting these Indian warriors on the stage, Barnum\r\nexplained to the large audiences the names and characteristics of\r\neach. When he came to Yellow Bear he would pat him familiarly\r\nupon the shoulder, which always caused him to look up with a\r\npleasant smile, while he softly stroked Barnum's arm with his\r\nright hand in the most loving manner. Knowing that he could not\r\nunderstand a word he said, Barnum pretended to be complimenting\r\nhim to the audience, while he was really saying something like\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\"This little Indian, ladies and gentlemen, is Yellow Bear, chief\r\nof the Kiowas. He has killed, no doubt, scores of white persons,\r\nand he is probably the meanest black-hearted rascal that lives in\r\nthe far West.\" Here Barnum patted him on the head, and he,\r\nsupposing he was sounding his praises, would smile, fawn upon\r\nhim, and stroke his arm, while he continued: \"If the bloodthirsty\r\nlittle villain understood what I was saying, he would kill me in\r\na moment; but as he thinks I am complimenting him, I can safely\r\nstate the truth to you, that he is a lying, thieving,\r\ntreacherous, murderous monster. He has tortured to death poor,\r\nunprotected women, murdered their husbands, brained their\r\nhelpless little ones; and he would gladly do the same to you or\r\nto me, if he thought he could escape punishment. This is but a\r\nfaint description of the character of Yellow Bear.\" Here Barnum\r\ngave him another patronizing pat on the head, and he, with a\r\npleasant smile, bowed to the audience, as much as to say that the\r\nwords were quite true, and that he thanked Barnum very much for\r\nthe high encomiums he had so generously heaped upon him.\r\n\r\nAfter the Indians had been at the Museum about week they\r\ndiscovered the real character of the place. They found they were\r\nsimply on exhibition, and that people paid a fee for the\r\nprivilege of coming in and gazing at them. Forthwith there was an\r\noutcry of discontent and anger. Nothing would induce them again\r\nto appear upon the stage. Their dignity had been irretrievably\r\noffended, and Barnum was actually fearful lest they should wreak\r\nvengeance upon him with physical violence. It was with a feeling\r\nof great relief that he witnessed their departure for Washington\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of this year Barnum produced at his Museum a\r\ndramatization of Dickens's \"Great Expectations.\" On the opening\r\nnight of the play, before the curtain rose, the great showman\r\nhimself went upon the stage and made this poetical address of\r\nwelcome to the audience:\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n \"That Prince of Humbugs, Barnum,\" so it appears\r\n Some folks have designated me for several years.\r\n Well, I don't murmur; indeed, when they embellish it,\r\n To tell the truth, my friends, I rather relish it,\r\n Since your true humbug's be, who as a host,\r\n For the least money entertains you most.\r\n In this sense I'm a \"humbug,\" I succumb!\r\n Who as a \"General\" thing brought out Tom Thumb?\r\n Who introduced (you can't say there I sinned)\r\n The Swedish Nightingale, sweet Jenny Lind?\r\n Who brought you Living Whales from Labrador?\r\n The Hippopotamus from Nilus's shore,\r\n The Bearded Lady with her (h)airs and graces,\r\n The Aztec Children with their normal faces,\r\n The Twins of Siam--rarest of dualities--\r\n Two ever separate, ne'er apart realities?\r\n The Family of Albinos? the Giraffe?\r\n The famous Baby Show that made you laugh?\r\n The Happy Family--cats, rats, doves, hawks, harmonious?\r\n Their voices blend in tones euphonious.\r\n The great Sea Lion from Pacific's coast,\r\n The \"Monarch of the Ocean,\" no empty boast;\r\n Old Adam's Bears, cutest of brute performers,\r\n In modern \"peace meetings\" models for reformers.\r\n That living miracle, the Lightning Calculator,\r\n Those figures confound Hermann the \"Prestidigitator.\"\r\n The Grand Aquaria, an official story\r\n Of life beneath the waves ill all its glory;\r\n The curious \"What is It?\" which you, though spunky,\r\n Won't call a man and cannot call a monkey.\r\n These things and many more time forbids to state,\r\n I first introduced, if I did not originate;\r\n \"The World's Seven Wonders,\" pooh! let them invite you,\r\n Here \"seven\" saloons all wonder-full delight you.\r\n To call this \"humbug\" admits of no defence,\r\n For all is shown for five and twenty cents.\r\n And now, good friends, to use less rhyme than reason,\r\n To-day re-opens our dramatic season;\r\n Therefore I welcome you! And though we're certain\r\n To raise \"Great Expectations\" with the curtain,\r\n And \"play the Dickens\" afternoon and nightly,\r\n I bid you welcome none the less politely,\r\n To these my \"quarters,\" merry and reliable,\r\n That yours are always welcome 'tis undeniable!\r\n And Patrick Henry like I say, I boast of it,\r\n If that be \"humbug,\" gentlemen, \"make the most of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing address may be correctly said to have as much truth\r\nas poetry. It is a graceful summary of the curiosities which\r\nBarnum had brought before the world up to his sixtieth year. It\r\ndoes not include the Sacred White Elephant of Siam, the mammoth\r\nJumbo and other wonders of nature which he was yet to reveal to\r\nastonished and delighted millions. Nor does it indicate that\r\ngrand genius of aggregation by which in later years he surpassed\r\nall his previous performances--masterly as they were. Not till\r\nthe veteran had reached the age of seventy--the allotted span of\r\nlife--did he gather and create \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with the dramatization of Dickens' novel, it seems\r\nsurprising that the Great Showman had little intercourse with the\r\nGreat Novelist. He was on intimate terms with Thackeray and gave\r\nhim useful hints for his lecturing tour in the United States, by\r\nwhich the humorist duly profited. But Dickens, who reached the\r\npopular heart as Barnum did their senses, seems to have held\r\naloof from one whose knowledge of men rivalled his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. GENERAL AND MRS. TOM THUMB.\r\n\r\nMISS LAVINIA WARREN--THE RIVALS--MISS WARREN'S ENGAGEMENT TO TOM\r\nTHUMB--THE WEDDING--GRAND RECEPTION--LETTER FROM A WOULD-BE\r\nGUEST, AND DR. TAYLOR'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Mr. Barnum heard of an extraordinary dwarf girl named\r\nLavinia Warren, who was living at Middleboro, Massachusetts, and\r\nsent an invitation to her and her parents to visit him at\r\nBridgeport: they came, and Barnum found her to be a very\r\nintelligent and refined young lady. He immediately made a\r\ncontract with her for several years, she agreeing to visit the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\nHe purchased a splendid wardrobe for her, including many elegant\r\ndresses, costly jewels and everything else that could add to her\r\nnaturally charming person. She was placed on exhibition at the\r\nMuseum, and from the first was a great success. Commodore Nutt\r\nwas exhibited with her, and although he was several years her\r\njunior, he at once took a violent fancy to her. One day Mr.\r\nBarnum gave Miss Warren a diamond and emerald ring, and as it did\r\nnot exactly fit her finger, he offered to get her another one\r\njust like it, and told her to present this one to Commodore Nutt\r\nin her own name. She did so, and the Commodore, who possessed a\r\nfull proportion of masculine vanity, construed the gift to be a\r\nlove token, and poor Lavinia was much distressed, for she\r\nconsidered herself quite a woman, and the Commodore only \"a nice\r\nboy.\" Still she did not like to offend him, and continued to\r\ntreat him kindly, while not actually encouraging his attentions.\r\n\r\nAt the time Tom Thumb was not on exhibition at the Museum; he was\r\ntaking a vacation at his home in Bridgeport. One day he came to\r\nNew York quite unexpectedly, and naturally called on Mr. Barnum\r\nat the Museum. Lavinia was holding one of her levees when he came\r\nin, and he was presented to her.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interview with her he went directly to Mr. Barnum's\r\nprivate office and asked to see him alone. The door was closed\r\nand the General sat down. His first question gave Mr. Barnum a\r\nslight inkling of the object of the interview. The General wanted\r\nto know all about the family of Lavinia Warren. Mr. Barnum gave\r\nhim all information, and the General said, earnestly, \"That is\r\nthe most charming little lady I ever saw, and I believe she was\r\ncreated to be my wife. Now, Mr. Barnum, you've always been a\r\nfriend of mine, and I want you to say a good word for me to her.\r\nI've got plenty of money and I want to marry and settle down, and\r\nI really feel as though I must marry that young lady.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum laughed, and recalling his ancient joke, said:\r\n\"Lavinia is already engaged, General.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom? Commodore Nutt?\" asked Tom Thumb, jealously.\r\n\r\n\"No, to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" laughed the General, much relieved. \"Never mind; you may\r\nexhibit her for a while, and then give up the engagement; but I\r\ndo hope you will favor my suit with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, General,\" replied Barnum, \"I will not oppose your suit,\r\nbut you must do your own courting. I will tell you, however, that\r\nCommodore Nutt will be jealous of you, and more than that, Miss\r\nWarren is nobody's fool, and you will have to proceed very\r\ncautiously if you succeed in winning her.\"\r\n\r\nThe General promised to be very discreet. A change now came over\r\nhim. He had been very fond of his country home at Bridgeport,\r\nwhere he spent all his leisure time with his horses and his\r\nyacht, for he had a great passion for the water; but now he was\r\nconstantly running down to the city, and the horses and yacht\r\nwere sadly neglected. He had a married sister living in New York,\r\nand his visits to her multiplied to such an extent that his\r\nmother, who lived in Bridgeport, remarked that Charles had never\r\nbefore shown so much brotherly affection, nor so much fondness\r\nfor city life.\r\n\r\nHis visits to the Museum were frequent, and it was very amusing\r\nto watch his new relations with Commodore Nutt, who strutted\r\naround like a bantam rooster whenever the General approached\r\nLavinia. One day the rivals got into a friendly scuffle in the\r\ndressing-room, and the Commodore laid the General very neatly on\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\nBut while the Commodore was performing on the stage, and on\r\nSunday afternoons and evenings, the General found plenty of\r\nopportunities to talk to Lavinia, and it was evident that his\r\nsuit was progressing.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tom Thumb returned to Bridgeport, and privately begged\r\nMr. Barnum to bring Lavinia up the next Saturday evening, and\r\nalso to invite him to the house.\r\n\r\nHis immediate object was that his mother might see Miss Warren.\r\nMr. Barnum agreed to the proposition, and on the following\r\nFriday, while Miss Warren and the Commodore were sitting in the\r\ngreen-room, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Lavinia, would you like to go up to Bridgeport with me\r\nto-morrow, and stay until Monday?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" she replied, \"it will be a great relief to get\r\ninto the country for a couple of days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum,\" said the Commodore, \"I should like to go up to\r\nBridgeport to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see my ponies; I have not seen them for several\r\nmonths;\" he replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum remarked that he was afraid he could not spare the\r\nCommodore from the Museum, but he said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I can perform at half past seven o'clock and then jump on\r\nthe evening train and go up by myself, reaching Bridgeport at\r\neleven, and return early Monday morning.\"\r\n\r\nFearing a clash of interests between the two little men, but\r\nwishing to please the Commodore, Mr. Barnum consented, especially\r\nas Miss Warren seemed to favor it.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore had made his feelings almost as plain to the\r\nmanager as had General Tom Thumb, but Lavinia Warren's secret was\r\nher own. She kept up a wonderful self-possession under the\r\ncircumstances, for she must have known the reason of the\r\nGeneral's frequent visits to the Museum. Barnum was afraid that\r\nshe intended to reject Tom Thumb, and he told him as much; the\r\nGeneral was nervous but determined; hence his anxiety to have\r\nLavinia meet his mother, and also to see the extent of his\r\npossessions in Bridgeport.\r\n\r\nThe General met his lady-love and Mr. Barnum at the station\r\nSaturday morning, and drove them to the latter's house in his own\r\ncarriage--the coachman being tidily dressed, with a broad velvet\r\nribbon and a silver buckle on his hat, especially for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for a half hour at Lindencroft, he came back and\r\ntook Lavinia out to drive. They stopped at his mother's house,\r\nwhere she saw the apartments which had been built for him and\r\nfilled with the most gorgeous furniture, all corresponding to his\r\ndiminutive size. Then he took her to East Bridgeport, and\r\nundoubtedly took occasion to point out all of the houses which he\r\nowned, for he depended much on his wealth making an impression on\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe stayed to lunch at Lindencroft, and was much pleased when\r\nLavinia expressed her opinion that \"Mr. Barnum or Tom Thumb owned\r\nabout all Bridgeport.\"\r\n\r\nThe General took his leave and returned to five o'clock dinner,\r\naccompanied by his mother, who was delighted with Lavinia. The\r\nGeneral took Mr. Barnum aside and begged him for an invitation to\r\nstay all night, \"For,\" said he, \"I intend to ask her to marry me\r\nbefore the Commodore arrives.\"\r\n\r\nAfter tea Lavinia and the General sat down to play backgammon. By\r\nand by the rest went to their separate rooms, but Tom Thumb had\r\nvolunteered to sit up for the Commodore, and persuaded Miss\r\nWarren to keep him company.\r\n\r\nThe General was beaten at backgammon, and after sitting a few\r\nminutes, he evidently thought it time to put a clincher on his\r\nfinancial abilities. So he drew from his pocket a policy of\r\ninsurance and handed it to Lavinia, asking her if she knew what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nExamining it, she replied, \"It is an insurance policy. I see you\r\nkeep your property insured.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the beauty of it is, it is not my property,\" replied the\r\nGeneral, \"and yet I get the benefit of the insurance in case of\r\nfire. You will see,\" he continued, unfolding the policy, \"this is\r\nthe property of Mr. Williams, but here, you will observe, it\r\nreads 'loss, if any, payable to Charles S. Stratton, as his\r\ninterest may appear.' The fact is, I loaned Mr. Williams three\r\nthousand dollars, took a mortgage on his house, and made him\r\ninsure it for my benefit. In this way, you perceive, I get my\r\ninterest, and he has to pay the taxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a very wise way, I should think,\" remarked Lavinia.\r\n\r\n\"That is the way I do all my business,\" replied the General,\r\ncomplacently, as he returned the huge insurance policy to his\r\npocket. \"You see,\" he continued, \"I never lend any of my money\r\nwithout taking bond and mortgage security, then I have no trouble\r\nwith taxes; my principal is secure, and I receive my interest\r\nregularly.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation seemed satisfactory to Lavinia, and the General's\r\ncourage began to rise. Drawing his chair a little nearer to hers,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"So you are going to Europe, soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Lavinia, \"Mr. Barnum intends to take me over in a\r\ncouple of months.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find it very pleasant,\" remarked the General; \"I have\r\nbeen there twice, in fact I have spent six years abroad, and I\r\nlike the old countries very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall like the trip, and I expect I shall,\" responded\r\nLavinia; \"for Mr. Barnum says I shall visit all the principal\r\ncities, and he has no doubt I will be invited to appear before\r\nthe Queen of England, the Emperor and Empress of France, the King\r\nof Prussia, the Emperor of Austria, and at the courts of any\r\nother countries which we may visit. Oh! I shall like that, it\r\nwill be so new to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it will be very interesting indeed. I have visited most of\r\nthe crowned heads,\" remarked the General, with an evident feeling\r\nof self-congratulation. \"But are you not afraid you will be\r\nlonesome in a strange country?\" asked the General.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think there is no danger of that, for friends will\r\naccompany me,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I was going over, for I know all about the different\r\ncountries, and could explain them all to you,\" remarked Tom\r\nThumb.\r\n\r\n\"That would be very nice,\" said Lavinia.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" said the General, moving his chair still\r\ncloser to Lavinia's.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replied Lavinia, coolly, \"for I, being a stranger to\r\nall the habits and customs of the people, as well as to the\r\ncountry, it would be pleasant to have some person along who could\r\nanswer all my foolish questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like it first rate, if Mr. Barnum would engage me,\"\r\nsaid the General.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you remarked the other day that you had money enough,\r\nand was tired of traveling,\" said Lavinia, with a slightly\r\nmischievous look from one corner of her eye.\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon my company while traveling,\" replied the\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n\"You might not find my company very agreeable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be glad to risk it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps Mr. Barnum would engage you, if you asked him,\"\r\nsaid Lavinia.\r\n\r\n\"Would you really like to have me go?\" asked the General, quietly\r\ninsinuating his arm around her waist, but hardly close enough to\r\ntouch her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I would,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe little General's arm clasped the waist closer as he turned\r\nhis face nearer to hers, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it would be pleasanter if we went as man and\r\nwife?\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a little hesitation she agreed that it would.\r\n\r\nA moment later a carriage drove up to the door, the bell rang and\r\nthe Commodore entered.\r\n\r\n\"You here, General?\" said the Commodore as he espied his rival.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lavinia, \"Mr. Barnum asked him to stay, and we were\r\nwaiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mr. Barnum?\" asked the Commodore.\r\n\r\n\"He has gone to bed,\" answered Tom Thumb, \"but a supper has been\r\nprepared for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not hungry, thank you,\" said the Commodore petulantly,\r\n\"What room does Mr. Barnum sleep in?\"\r\n\r\nHe was answered, and immediately went to Mr. Barnum whom he found\r\nreading in bed.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum,\" he said sarcastically, \"does Tom Thumb BOARD here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Barnum, \"Tom Thumb does not BOARD here. I invited\r\nhim to stop over night, so don't be foolish, but go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's no affair of mine. I don't care anything about it. Only\r\nI thought he'd taken up his residence here.\" And off he went to\r\nbed, in a very bad humor.\r\n\r\nTen minutes after, Tom Thumb rushed into the room in the greatest\r\nexcitement, and cried joyfully: \"We're engaged, Mr. Barnum! We're\r\nengaged!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that possible?\" said Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir, indeed it is,\" responded the General, \"but you must'nt\r\nmention it. We've agreed to tell no one, so don't say a word. I'm\r\ngoing to ask her Mother's consent Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum swore secrecy, and the General went off radiant with\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe next day the family plied Lavinia with all sorts of\r\nquestions, but not a breath passed her lips that would give the\r\nslightest indication as to what had transpired. She was most\r\namiable to the Commodore, and as the General concluded to go home\r\nthe next morning, the Commodore's happiness and good humor were\r\nfully restored. The General made a call Sunday evening and\r\nmanaged to have an interview with Lavinia. The next morning she\r\nand the Commodore returned to New York, without Mr. Barnum.\r\n\r\nThe General called on Monday to tell Mr. Barnum that he had\r\nconcluded to send his letter to Lavinia's mother by his friend,\r\nMr. Wells, who had consented to go to Middleboro' the next day,\r\nand to urge the General's suit if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe General went to New York on Wednesday to wait there for Mr.\r\nWells's return. That same day he and Lavinia came to Mr. Barnum,\r\nand Tom Thumb said: \"Mr. Barnum, I want somebody to tell the\r\nCommodore that Lavinia and I are engaged, for I'm afraid there\r\nwill be a row when he hears of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you do it yourself, General?\" asked Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the General, almost shuddering, \"I would not dare do\r\nit, he might knock me down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do it myself,\" said Lavinia. So the General retired and\r\nthe Commodore was sent for. When he had joined them, Mr. Barnum\r\nbegan by saying, \"Commodore, do you know what this little witch\r\nhas been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she has been cutting up the greatest prank you ever heard\r\nof. She almost deserves to be shut up for daring to do it. Can't\r\nyou guess what it is?\"\r\n\r\nHe mused a moment, and then said in a low tone, and looking full\r\nat her, \"Engaged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Barnum, \"actually engaged to be married to General\r\nTom Thumb. Did you ever hear of such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it so, Lavinia?\" he asked, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lavinia, \"it is really so.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commodore turned pale, choked a little, and turning on his\r\nheel, he said, in a broken voice:\r\n\r\n\"I hope you may be happy.\"\r\n\r\nAs he passed out the door a tear rolled down his cheek. \"That's\r\npretty hard,\" said Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Yes it is hard,\" said Lavinia, \"and I am very sorry. Only I\r\ncouldn't help it. It was all the fault of your emerald and\r\ndiamond ring.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the Commodore returned to the office and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Barnum do you think it would be right for Miss Warren to\r\nmarry Charlie Stratton if her mother should object?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Mr. Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she says she will marry him anyway; that she gives her\r\nmother the chance to consent, but if she objects, she will have\r\nher way and marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Barnum, \"I will not permit it. She is\r\nengaged to go to Europe with me, and I will not release her if\r\nher mother does not consent to her marriage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commodore's eyes glistened, and he said: \"Between you and me,\r\nMr. Barnum, I don't believe she will consent.\"\r\n\r\nBut she did, although at first she had objected, thinking that it\r\nmight be merely a money-making scheme; but after she read Tom\r\nThumb's letter, and heard Mr. Barnum's assurance that he would\r\nrelease her from her engagement with him, in event of the\r\nmarriage, she consented.\r\n\r\nAfter the Commodore heard the news Mr. Barnum said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Commodore; Minnie Warren is a better match for you\r\nanyhow. She is two years younger than you, and Lavinia is older.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Commodore replied grandly; \"Thank you sir, but I would\r\nnot marry the best woman living. I don't believe in women.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum then suggested that he stand with Minnie, as groom and\r\nbridesmaid, but he declined. A few weeks later, however, he told\r\nBarnum that Tom Thumb had asked him to stand with Minnie, and\r\nthat he was going to do so.\r\n\r\n\"And when I asked you, you refused,\" said Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"It was not your business to ask me,\" said the Commodore\r\npompously, \"when the proper person asked me, I accepted.\"\r\n\r\nThe approaching wedding was announced and created an immense\r\nexcitement. Lavinia's levees were crowded and she not\r\ninfrequently sold three hundred dollars' worth of photographs in\r\na day. The General was engaged to exhibit and his own photograph\r\nwas largely in demand. The Museum was so well attended, the daily\r\nreceipts being nearly three thousand dollars, that Barnum offered\r\nthem fifteen thousand dollars if they would postpone their\r\nwedding for a month and continue the levees.\r\n\r\n\"No sir,\" said the General excitedly, \"not for fifty thousand\r\ndollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you Charlie,\" said Lavinia, \"only you should have said\r\none hundred thousand.\"\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to Barnum to have the wedding take place in the\r\nAcademy of Music and charge a good admission.\r\n\r\nBut Barnum refused.\r\n\r\nGrace Church, at Broadway and Tenth St., was the scene of this\r\nhistoric wedding, which occurred at noon of Tuesday, Feb. 10,\r\n1863. Long before the hour designated the entire neighborhood was\r\nthronged by expectant and smiling crowds awaiting the arrival of\r\nthe happy pair with their attendants, and looking with\r\nill-concealed envy upon the scores of carriages that bore to the\r\nscene of action the fortunate possessors of cards of invitation.\r\nAt the entrance the ubiquitous Brown was to be seen, bland and\r\nsmiling, looking more like an honest Alderman of yore than a\r\nsexton, and recognizing in each new deposit of youth or beauty or\r\nwealth another star to shed lustre upon the extraordinary\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nExcellent police arrangements, no less than the self-respect and\r\ndecorum that always characterizes an American crowd, secured the\r\nutmost quiet and order. The truth was that an outsider could only\r\nhave discovered the marriage to have been one of peculiar\r\ninterest from the snatches of feminine gossip that met the ear,\r\nin which small-sized adjectives were profusely employed.\r\n\r\nThe church was crowded with a gay assemblage of ladies and\r\ngentlemen, the former appearing in full opera costume, and the\r\nlatter in dress coats and white neck-cloths. In front of the\r\naltar a platform three feet high covered with Brussels carpet had\r\nbeen erected. Pending the arrival of the wedding cortege, Mr.\r\nMorgan performed a number of operatic selections on the organ.\r\n\r\nAt high noon the murmuring of the swarming throng outside and the\r\nturning of all heads townward presaged the arrival of the bridal\r\nparty; its undoubted arrival was announced by the arrival of\r\nBarnum himself.\r\n\r\nThe bridal party quickly entered the church, and proceeding up\r\nthe middle aisle, took proper positions upon the platform.\r\nCommodore Nutt acting as groomsman, and Miss Minnie Warren as\r\nbridesmaid.\r\n\r\nAfter several operatic performances on the organ, the marriage\r\nservices were commenced, the Rev. Dr. Taylor and the Rev. Junius\r\nM. Willey officiating. The petite bride was given away by the\r\nRev. Mr. Palmer, at the request of her parents. Dr. Taylor\r\npronounced the marital benediction, when the party left the\r\nchurch and were rapidly driven to the Metropolitan Hotel, the\r\nstreet, stoops, buildings and windows in the neighborhood of\r\nwhich were crowded with men, women and children.\r\n\r\nAt 1 o'clock the reception commenced, the bride and groom,\r\nattended by the Commodore and Miss Minnie Warren, occupying a\r\ndais in one of the front parlors. The crowd soon resolved into a\r\nperfect jam, and for some time great confusion prevailed. After a\r\ntime, certain arrangements were made by which the company were\r\nenabled to pay their respects to the little couple.\r\n\r\nThe graceful form of Mrs. Charles S. Stratton was shown to\r\nadvantage in her bridal robe, which was composed of plain white\r\nsatin, the skirt en traine, being decorated with a flounce of\r\ncostly point lace, headed by tulle puffings; the berthe to match.\r\nHer hair, slightly waved, was rolled a la Eugenie, and\r\nelaborately puffed in noeuds behind, in which the bridal veil was\r\nlooped: natural orange blossoms breathed their perfume above her\r\nbrow, and mingled their fragrance with the soft sighs of her\r\ngentle bosom. Roses and japonicas composed a star-shaped bouquet,\r\nwhich she held in her just-bestowed hand.\r\n\r\nHer jewels consisted of diamond necklace, bracelets, earrings,\r\nand a star-shaped ornament en diadem, with brooch to match.\r\n\r\nMr. Stratton was attired in a black dress coat and a vest of\r\nwhite corded silk, with an undervest of blue silk.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore was similarly attired, and Miss Minnie Warren\r\nappeared in a white silk skirt, with a white illusion overdress,\r\ntrimmed half way up the skirt with bouillonnes of the same\r\nmaterial, dotted with pink rosebuds. The corsage was decollete,\r\nwith berthe to match.\r\n\r\nAt 3 o'clock the bridal party left the reception room, and\r\nretired to their private parlor, when the company soon after\r\ndispersed. Upon leaving the hotel the guests were supplied with\r\nwedding cake, over two thousand boxes being thus distributed. In\r\na parlor adjoining that used for the reception were exhibited the\r\nbridal presents.\r\n\r\nThe jewelry and silverware were displayed in glass cases.\r\n\r\nThat night, at 10 o'clock, the New York Excelsior Band serenaded\r\nthe bridal party at the Metropolitan, when Mr. Stratton appeared\r\nupon the balcony and made the following speech to the large\r\nassemblage in front of the hotel:\r\n\r\n\"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--I thank you most sincerely for this and\r\nmany other tokens of kindness showered upon me to-day. After\r\nbeing for more than twenty years before the public, I little\r\nexpected at this late day, to attract so much attention. Indeed\r\nif I had not become a family man I should never have known how\r\nhigh I stood in public favor, and I assure you I appreciate\r\nhighly and am truly grateful for this evidence of your esteem and\r\nconsideration. I am soon off for foreign lands, but I shall take\r\nwith me the pleasant recollection of your kindness to-day. But,\r\nladies and gentlemen, a little woman in the adjoining apartment\r\nis very anxious to see us, and I must, therefore, make this\r\nspeech, like myself, short. I kindly thank the excellent band of\r\nmusic for its melody, the sweetness of which is only exceeded by\r\nmy anticipations of happiness in the new life before me. And now,\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, wishing you all health and happiness, I bid\r\nyou all a cordial good-night.\" [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe following entirely authentic correspondence, the only\r\nsuppression being the name of the person who wrote to Dr. Taylor,\r\nand to whom Dr. Taylor's reply is addressed, shows how a certain\r\nwould-be \"witness\" was not a witness of the famous wedding. In\r\nother particulars the correspondence speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nTO THE REV. DR. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nSir: The object of my unwillingly addressing you this note is to\r\ninquire what right you had to exclude myself and other owners of\r\npews in Grace Church from entering it yesterday, enforced, too,\r\nby a cordon of police for that purpose. If my pew is not my\r\nproperty, I wish to know it; and if it is, I deny your right to\r\nprevent me from occupying it whenever the church is open, even at\r\na marriage of mountebanks, which I would not take the trouble to\r\ncross the street to witness.\r\n                     Respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                                         W*** S***\r\n\r\n                         804 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 1863.\r\nMR. W*** S***\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I am sorry, my valued friend, that you should have\r\nwritten me the peppery letter that is now before me. If the\r\nmatter of which you complain be so utterly insignificant and\r\ncontemptible as \"a marriage of mountebanks, which you would not\r\ntake the trouble to cross the street to witness,\" it surprises me\r\nthat you should have made such strenuous, but ill-directed\r\nefforts to secure a ticket of admission. And why, permit me to\r\nask, in the name of reason and philosophy, do you still suffer it\r\nto disturb you so sadly? It would, perhaps, be a sufficient\r\nanswer to your letter, to say that your cause of complaint exists\r\nonly in your imagination. You have never been excluded from your\r\npew. As rector, I am the only custodian of the church, and you\r\nwill hardly venture to say that you have ever applied to me for\r\npermission to enter, and been refused.\r\n\r\nHere I might safely rest, and leave you to the comfort of your\r\nown reflections in the case. But as you, in common with many\r\nother worthy persons, would seem to have very crude notions as to\r\nyour rights of \"property\" in pews, you will pardon me for saying\r\nthat a pew in a church is property only in a peculiar and\r\nrestricted sense. It is not property, as your house or horse is\r\nproperty. It vests you with no fee in the soil; you cannot use it\r\nin any way, and in every way, and at all times, as your pleasure\r\nor caprice may dictate; you cannot put it to any common or\r\nunhallowed uses; you cannot remove it, nor injure it, nor destroy\r\nit. In short, you hold by purchase, and may sell the right to,\r\nthe undisturbed possession of that little space within the church\r\nedifice which you call your pew during the hours of divine\r\nservice. But even that right must be exercised decorously, and\r\nwith a decent regard for time and place, or else you may at any\r\nmoment be ignominiously ejected from it.\r\n\r\nI regret to be obliged to add that, by the law of custom, you\r\nmay, during those said hours of divine service (but at no other\r\ntime) sleep in your pew; you must, however, do so noiselessly and\r\nnever to the disturbance of your sleeping neighbors; your\r\nproperty in your pew has this extent and nothing more. Now, if\r\nMr. W*** S*** were at any time to come to me and say, \"Sir, I\r\nwould that you should grant me the use of Grace Church for a\r\nsolemn service (a marriage, a baptism, or a funeral, as the case\r\nmay be), and as it is desirable that the feelings of the parties\r\nshould be protected as far as possible from the impertinent\r\nintrusion and disturbance of a crowd from the streets and lanes\r\nof the city, I beg that no one may be admitted within the doors\r\nof the church during the very few moments that we expect to be\r\nthere, but our invited friends only,\"--it would certainly, in\r\nsuch a case, be my pleasure to comply with your request, and to\r\nmeet your wishes in every particular; and I think that even Mr.\r\nW*** S*** will agree that all this would be entirely reasonable\r\nand proper. Then, tell me, how would such a case differ from the\r\ninstance of which you complain? Two young persons, whose only\r\ncrimes would seem to be that they are neither so big, nor so\r\nstupid, nor so ill-mannered, nor so inordinately selfish as some\r\nother people, come to me and say, sir, we are about to be\r\nmarried, and we wish to throw around our marriage all the\r\nsolemnities of religion. We are strangers in your city, and as\r\nthere is no clergyman here standing in a pastoral relation to us,\r\nwe have ventured to ask the favor of the bishop of New York to\r\nmarry us, and he has kindly consented to do so; may we then\r\nventure a little further and request the use of your church in\r\nwhich the bishop may perform the marriage service? We assure you,\r\nsir, that we are no shams, no cheats, no mountebanks; we are\r\nneither monsters nor abortions; it is true we are little, but we\r\nare as God made us, perfect in our littleness. Sir, we are simply\r\nman and woman of like passions and infirmities with you and other\r\nmortals. The arrangements for our marriage are controlled by no\r\n\"showman,\" and we are sincerely desirous that everything should\r\nbe ordered with a most scrupulous regard to decorum. We hope to\r\ninvite our relations and intimate friends, together with such\r\npersons as may in other years have extended civilities to either\r\nof us; but we pledge ourselves to you most sacredly that no\r\ninvitation can be bought with money. Permit us to say further,\r\nthat as we would most gladly escape from the insulting jeers, and\r\nribald sneers and coarse ridicule of the unthinking multitude\r\nwithout, we pray you to allow us, at our own proper charges, so\r\nto guard the avenues of access from the street, as to prevent all\r\nunseemly tumult and disorder.\r\n\r\nI tell you, sir, that whenever, and from whomsoever, such an\r\nappeal is made to my Christian courtesy, although it should come\r\nfrom the very humblest of the earth, I would go calmly and\r\ncheerfully forward to meet their wishes, although as many W***\r\nS***'s as would reach from here to Kamtschatka, clothed in furs\r\nand frowns, should rise up to oppose me.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will say, that if the marriage of Charles S.\r\nStratton and Lavinia Warren is to be regarded as a pageant, then\r\nit was the most beautiful pageant it has ever been my privilege\r\nto witness. If, on the contrary, it is rather to be thought of as\r\na solemn ceremony, then it was as touchingly solemn as a wedding\r\ncan possibly be rendered. It is true the bishop was not present,\r\nbut Mr. Stratton's own pastor, the Rev. Mr. Willey, of\r\nBridgeport, Connecticut, read the service with admirable taste\r\nand impressiveness, and the bride was given away by her mother's\r\npastor and her own \"next friend,\" a venerable Congregational\r\nclergyman from Massachusetts. Surely, there never was a gathering\r\nof so many hundreds of our best people, when everybody appeared\r\nso delighted with everything; surely it is no light thing to call\r\nforth so much innocent joy in so few moments of passing time;\r\nsurely it is no light thing, thus to smooth the roughness and\r\nsweeten the acerbities which mar our happiness as we advance upon\r\nthe wearing journey of life. Sir, it was most emphatically a high\r\ntriumph of \"Christian civilization!\"\r\n            Respectfully submitted, by your obedient servant,\r\n                                         THOMAS HOUSE TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nNot long after the wedding, a lady called at Barnum's office and\r\ncalled his attention to a little six-paged pamphlet which she\r\nsaid she had written. It was called \"Priests and Pigmies,\" and\r\nshe asked Barnum to read it. He glanced at the title, and at once\r\nestimating the character of the publication, promptly declined to\r\ndevote any portion of his valuable time to its perusal.\r\n\r\n\"But you had better look at it, Mr. Barnum; it deeply interests\r\nyou, and you may think it worth your while to buy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I will buy it, if you desire,\" said he, tendering her\r\na sixpence, which he supposed to be the price of the little\r\npamphlet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you quite misunderstand me; I mean buy the copyright and the\r\nentire edition, with the view of suppressing the work. It says\r\nsome frightful things, I assure you,\" urged the author.\r\n\r\nHe lay back in his chair and fairly roared at this exceedingly\r\nfeeble attempt at blackmail.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" persisted the lady, \"suppose it says that your Museum and\r\nGrace Church are all one, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"you may say what you please about\r\nme or about my Museum; you may print a hundred thousand copies of\r\na pamphlet stating that I stole the communion service, after the\r\nwedding, from Grace Church altar, or anything else you choose to\r\nwrite; only have the kindness to say something about me, and then\r\ncome to me and I will properly estimate the money value of your\r\nservices to me as an advertising agent. Good morning,\r\nmadam,\"--and she departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. POLITICAL NOTES.\r\n\r\nBARNUM BECOMES A REPUBLICAN--ILLUMINATING THE HOUSE OF A\r\nDEMOCRAT--THE PEACE MEETING--ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE--WAR ON\r\nTHE RAILROADS---SPEECH ON THE AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\nWhile he had always taken an active interest in politics, it was\r\nmany years before Barnum consented to run for any office. In 1852\r\nhe was strongly urged to submit his name to the State Convention,\r\nas a candidate for the office of Governor, and although the\r\nDemocratic party (to which he then belonged) was in the\r\nascendancy, and the nomination was equivalent to election, he\r\nstill refused.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 his political convictions were changed, and he identified\r\nhimself with the Republican party. During the exciting campaign\r\nof that year, which resulted in Lincoln's first election to the\r\npresidency, it will be remembered that the \"Wide-Awake\"\r\nassociations, with their uniforms and torchlight processions,\r\nwere organized in every city, town and village throughout the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Barnum arrived home from New York and learned that\r\nthe Bridgeport \"Wide Awakes?\" were to parade that evening and\r\nintended to march out to Lindencroft. Ordering two boxes of\r\ncandles he prepared for an illumination of every window in the\r\nhouse. Many of his neighbors, among them several Democrats, came\r\nto Lindencroft that evening to witness the parade, and to see the\r\nillumination. His next door neighbor, Mr. T., was a strong\r\nDemocrat, and before he left home, he ordered his servants to\r\nstay in the basement, and not show a light, thus proving by the\r\ndarkness of his premises, the firmness of his Democratic\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nBarnum urged his friend James D. Johnson, who was not less a\r\njoker than a Democrat, to engage the attention of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nT., and to keep their faces turned toward Bridgeport and the\r\napproaching procession, while he and Mr. George A. Wells, also a\r\nDemocrat, ran over and illuminated Mr. T.'s. house. As the\r\nWide-Awakes approached and saw that the house of Mr. T. was in a\r\nblaze with light, they concluded that he had changed his\r\npolitics, and gave three rousing cheers for him. Hearing his\r\nname, he turned and saw his house lighted from basement to attic,\r\nand uttering one single emphatic ejaculation, he rushed for home.\r\nBut he was not able to extinguish the lights before the\r\nWide-Awakes had gone on their way rejoicing over his apparent\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out in 1861, Barnum was too old for active\r\nservice in the field, but he sent four substitutes and\r\ncontributed largely from his means to the support of the Union.\r\n\r\nAfter Bull Run, July 21st, 1861, \"Peace Meetings\" began to be\r\nheld in different parts of the North, and especially in\r\nConnecticut. At these meetings it was usual to display a white\r\nflag bearing the word \"Peace,\" above the national flag, and to\r\nlisten to speeches denunciatory of the war.\r\n\r\nOne of these meetings was held August 24, 1861, at Stepney, ten\r\nmiles north of Bridgeport, and Mr. Barnum and Elias Howe, Jr.,\r\ninventor of the sewing machine needle, agreed to attend and hear\r\nfor themselves whether the speeches were loyal or not. They\r\ncommunicated their intention to a number of their friends, asking\r\nthem to go also, and at least twenty accepted the invitation. It\r\nwas their plan to listen quietly to the harangues, and if they\r\nfound any opposition to the government or anything calculated to\r\ncreate disaffection in the community, or liable to deter\r\nenlistments,--to report the matter to the authorities at\r\nWashington and ask that measures be taken to suppress the\r\ngatherings.\r\n\r\nAs the carriages of these gentlemen turned into Main street they\r\ndiscovered two large omnibuses filled with soldiers who were home\r\non a furlough, and who were going to Stepney. The lighter\r\ncarriages soon outran the omnibuses, and the party arrived at\r\nStepney in time to see the white flag run up above the stars and\r\nstripes. They stood quietly in the crowd, while the meeting was\r\norganized, and a preacher--Mr. Charles Smith--was invited to open\r\nthe proceedings with prayer. \"The Military and Civil History of\r\nConnecticut, during the war of 1861-65,\" by W. A. Croffut and\r\nJohn M. Morris, thus continues the account of the meeting:\r\n\r\n\"He (Smith) had not, however, progressed far in his supplication,\r\nwhen he slightly opened his eyes, and beheld, to his horror, the\r\nBridgeport omnibuses coming over the hill, garnished with Union\r\nbanners, and vocal with loyal cheers. This was the signal for a\r\npanic; Bull Run, on a small scale was re-enacted. The devout\r\nSmith, and the undelivered orators, it is alleged, took refuge in\r\na field of corn. The procession drove straight to the pole\r\nunresisted, the hostile crowd parting to let them pass; and a\r\ntall man--John Platt--amid some mutterings, climbed the pole,\r\nreached the halliards, and the mongrel banners were on the\r\nground. Some of the peace-men, rallying, drew weapons on 'the\r\ninvaders,' and a musket and a revolver were taken from them by\r\nsoldiers at the very instant of firing. Another of the defenders\r\nfired a revolver, and was chased into the fields. Still others,\r\nwaxing belligerent, were disarmed, and a number of loaded muskets\r\nfound stored in an adjacent shed were seized. The stars and\r\nstripes were hoisted upon the pole, and wildly cheered. P. T.\r\nBarnum was then taken on the shoulders of the boys in blue, and\r\nput on the platform, where he made a speech full of patriotism,\r\nspiced with the humor of the occasion. Captain James E. Dunham\r\nalso said a few words to the point. * * * * 'The Star Spangled\r\nBanner' was then sung in chorus, and a series of resolutions\r\npassed, declaring that 'loyal men are the rightful custodians of\r\nthe peace of Connecticut.' Elias Howe, Jr., chairman, made his\r\nspeech, when the crowd threatened to shoot the speakers. 'If they\r\nfire a gun, boys, burn the whole town, and I'll pay for it!'\r\nAfter giving the citizens wholesome advice concerning the\r\nsubstituted flag, and their duty to the government, the\r\nprocession returned to Bridgeport with the white flag trailing in\r\nthe mud behind an omnibus. * * * * They were received at\r\nBridgeport by approving crowds, and were greeted with continuous\r\ncheers as they passed along.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1865, Barnum accepted from the Republican party\r\na nomination to the Connecticut Legislature, from the town of\r\nFairfield, and he did so mainly because he wished to vote for the\r\nthen proposed amendment to the Constitution, to abolish slavery\r\nforever from the land.\r\n\r\nHe was elected, and on arriving at Hartford the night before the\r\nsession began, found the wire pullers at work, laying their plans\r\nfor the election of a Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nBarnum, with his usual penetration and shrewdness, saw that the\r\nrailroad interests had combined in support of one of the\r\ncandidates, and seeing in this, no promise of good to the\r\ncommunity at large, he at once consulted with a few friends in\r\nthe Legislature, and they resolved to defeat the railroad \"ring,\"\r\nif possible, in caucus. Their efforts were successful and the\r\nrailroad's candidate was not elected.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the caucus, Barnum sought the successful\r\nnominee, Hon. E. K. Foster, of New Haven, and begged him not to\r\nappoint as chairman of the Railroad Committee the man who had\r\nheld the office for several successive years, and who was, in\r\nfact, the great railroad factotum of the State. The speaker\r\ncomplied with Barnum's request, and he soon saw how important it\r\nwas to check the strong and growing monopoly; for, as he said,\r\nthe \"outside pressure\" to secure the appointment of the\r\nobjectionable party was terrible.\r\n\r\nAlthough Barnum had not foreseen such a thing until he reached\r\nHartford, he soon discovered that a battle with the railroad\r\ncommissioners would be necessary, and his course was shaped\r\naccordingly. A majority of the commissioners were mere tools in\r\nthe hands of the railroad companies, and one of them was actually\r\na hired clerk in the office of the New York and New Haven\r\nRailroad Company. It was also shown that the chairman of the\r\ncommissioners permitted most of the accidents which occurred on\r\nthat road to be taken charge of and reported upon by their paid\r\nlobby agent.\r\n\r\nThis was so manifestly destructive to the interests of all\r\nparties who might suffer from accidents on the road, or have any\r\ncontroversy with the company, that the farmers, and the\r\nanti-monopolist element united to defeat the chairman of the\r\nrailroad commissioners, who was a candidate for re-election, and\r\nto put their own candidate in his place.\r\n\r\nThrough Barnum's efforts a law was passed that no person in the\r\nemploy of any railroad in the State, should serve as railroad\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nBut the great struggle, which lasted through the entire session,\r\nwas upon the subject of railroad passenger commutations.\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt had secured control of the Hudson River and\r\nHarlem railroads, and had increased the price of commuters'\r\ntickets, from two hundred to four hundred per cent. Many men\r\nliving on the line of these roads, ten to fifty miles from New\r\nYork, had built fine residences in the country on the strength of\r\ncheap transit to and from the city, and were now compelled to\r\nsubmit to the extortion. Commodore Vanderbilt was also a large\r\nshareholder in the New York and New Haven road, and it seemed\r\nevident that the same practice would be introduced there Barnum\r\ntherefore enlisted as many as he could in a strong effort to\r\nstrangle the outrage before it became too strong to grapple with.\r\nSeveral lawyers in the Assembly promised their aid, but before\r\nthe final struggle came, all but one, in the whole body, had\r\nenlisted in favor of the railroads.\r\n\r\nWhat influence had been at work with these gentlemen was, of\r\ncourse, a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that all the railroad interests in the State were\r\ncombined; and while they had plenty of money with which to carry\r\nout their designs, the chances were small indeed for those\r\nmembers of the legislature who were struggling for simple\r\njustice, and who had no pecuniary interests at stake.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, every inch of ground was fought over, day after\r\nday, before the legislative railroad committee; examinations and\r\ncross-examinations of railroad commissioners and lobbyists were\r\nkept up. Scarcely more than one man, Senator Ballard, of Darien,\r\nlent his personal aid to Barnum in the investigation, but\r\ntogether they left not a stone unturned.\r\n\r\nThe man who was prevented from being appointed chairman succeeded\r\nin becoming one of the railroad commissioners, but so much light\r\nwas thrown on his connection with railroad reports, railroad laws\r\nand lobbying, by the indefatigable Barnum, the, the man took to\r\nhis bed, some ten days before the close of the session, and\r\nactually staid there \"sick \" until the legislature adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the United States Constitution abolishing\r\nslavery met with little opposition; but the proposed amendment to\r\nthe State Constitution, giving the right of suffrage to the\r\nnegro, was violently opposed by the Democratic members. The\r\nreport from the minority of the committee to whom the question\r\nwas referred gave certain reasons for rejecting the contemplated\r\namendment, and in reply to this minority report, Barnum spoke,\r\nMay 26th, 1865, as follows:--ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker: I will not attempt to notice at any length the\r\ndeclamation of the honorable gentleman from Milford, for\r\ncertainly I have heard nothing from his lips approaching to the\r\ndignity of argument. I agree with the gentleman that the right of\r\nsuffrage is \"dearly and sacredly cherished by the white man\"; and\r\nit is because this right is so dear and sacred, that I wish to\r\nsee it extended to every educated moral man within our State,\r\nwithout regard to color. He tells us that one race is a vessel to\r\nhonor, and another to dishonor; and that he has seen on ancient\r\nEgyptian monuments the negro represented as \"a hewer of wood and\r\na drawer of water.\" This is doubtless true, and the gentleman\r\nseems determined always to KEEP the negro a \"vessel of dishonor,\"\r\nand a \"hewer of wood.\" We, on the other hand, propose to give him\r\nthe opportunity of expanding his faculties and elevating himself\r\nto true manhood. He says he \"hates and abhors, and despises\r\ndemagogism.\" I am rejoiced to hear it, and I trust we shall see\r\ntangible evidence of the truth of what he professes in his\r\nabandonment of that slavery to party which is the mere trick and\r\ntrap of the demagogue.\r\n\r\nWhen, a few days since, this honorable body voted unanimously for\r\nthe Amendment of the United States Constitution, abolishing human\r\nslavery, I not only thanked God from my heart of hearts, but I\r\nfelt like going down on my knees to the gentlemen of the\r\nopposition, for the wisdom they had exhibited in bowing to the\r\nlogic of events by dropping that dead weight of slavery which had\r\ndisrupted the Democratic party, with which I had been so long\r\nconnected. And on this occasion I wish again to appeal to the\r\nwisdom and loyalty of my Democratic friends. I say Democratic\r\n\"friends,\" for I am and ever was, a thorough, out and out\r\nDemocrat. I supported General Jackson, and voted for every\r\nDemocratic president after him, up to and including Pierce; for I\r\nreally thought Pierce was a Democrat until he proved the\r\ncontrary, as I conceived, in the Kansas question. My democracy\r\ngoes for the greatest good to the greatest number, for equal and\r\nexact justice to all men, and for a submission to the will of the\r\nmajority. It was the repudiation by the Southern Democracy of\r\nthis great democratic doctrine of majority rule which opened the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. Speaker, let me remind our Democratic friends that\r\nthe present question simply asks that a majority of the legal\r\nvoters, the white citizens of this State, may decide whether or\r\nnot colored men of good moral character, WHO ARE ABLE TO READ,\r\nand who possess all the qualifications of white voters, shall be\r\nentitled to the elective franchise. The opposition may have their\r\nown ideas, or may be in doubt upon this subject; but surely no\r\ntrue Democrat will dare to refuse permission to our\r\nfellow-citizens to decide the question.\r\n\r\nNegro slavery, and its legitimate outgrowths of ignorance,\r\ntyranny and oppression, have caused this gigantic rebellion,\r\nwhich has cost our country thousands of millions of treasure, and\r\nhundreds of thousands of human lives in defending a principle.\r\nAnd where was this poor, down-trodden colored race in this\r\nrebellion? Did they seize the \"opportunity\" when their masters\r\nwere engaged with a powerful foe, to break out in insurrection,\r\nand massacre those tyrants who had so long held them in the most\r\ncruel bondage? No, Mr. Speaker, they did not do this. My\r\n\"Democratic\" friends would have done it. I would have done it.\r\nIrishmen, Chinamen, Portuguese, would have done it; any white man\r\nwould have done it; but the poor black man is like a lamb in his\r\nnature compared with the white man. The black man possesses a\r\nconfiding disposition, thoroughly tinctured with religious\r\nenthusiasm, and not characterized by a spirit of revenge. No, the\r\nonly barbarous massacres we heard of, during the war, were those\r\ncommitted by their white masters on their poor, defenceless white\r\nprisoners, and to the eternal disgrace of southern white\r\n\"Democratic\" rebels, be it said, these instances of barbarism\r\nwere numerous all through the war. When this rebellion first\r\nbroke out, the northern Democracy raised a hue-and-cry against\r\npermitting the negroes to fight; but when such a measure seemed\r\nnecessary, in order to put down traitors, these colored men took\r\ntheir muskets in hand and made their bodies a wall of defence for\r\nthe loyal citizens of the North. And now, when our grateful white\r\ncitizens ask from this assembly the privilege of deciding by\r\ntheir votes whether these colored men, who at least, were\r\npartially our saviours in the war, may or may not, under proper\r\nrestrictions, become participants in that great salvation, I am\r\namazed that men calling themselves Democrats dare refuse to grant\r\nthis democratic measure. We wish to educate ignorant men, white\r\nor black. Ignorance is incompatible with the genius of our free\r\ninstitutions. In the very nature of things it jeopardizes their\r\nstability, and it is always unsafe to transgress the laws of\r\nnature. We cannot safely shut ourselves up with ignorance and\r\nbrutality; we must educate and Christianize those who are now by\r\ncircumstances our social inferiors.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I was afraid of foreign voters. I feared that when\r\nEurope poured her teeming millions of working people upon our\r\nshores, our extended laws of franchise would enable them to swamp\r\nour free institutions, and reduce us to anarchy. But much\r\nreflection has satisfied me that we have only to elevate these\r\nmillions and their descendants to the standard of American\r\ncitizenship, and we shall find sufficient of the leaven of\r\nliberty in our system of government to absorb all foreign\r\nelements and assimilate them to a truly democratic form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker: We cannot afford to carry passengers and have them\r\nlive under our government with no real vital interest in its\r\nperpetuity. Every man must be a joint owner.\r\n\r\nThe only safe inhabitants of a free country are educated citizens\r\nwho vote.\r\n\r\nNor in a free government can we afford to employ journeymen; they\r\nmay be apprenticed until they learn to read, and study our\r\ninstitutions; and then let them become joint proprietors and feel\r\na proportionate responsibility. The two learned and distinguished\r\nauthors of the minority report have been studying the science of\r\nethnology and have treated us with a dissertation on the races.\r\nAnd what have they attempted to show? Why, that a race which,\r\nsimply on account of the color of the skin, has long been buried\r\nin slavery at the South, and even at the North has been tabooed\r\nand scarcely permitted to rise above the dignity of whitewashers\r\nand boot-blacks, does not exhibit the same polish and refinement\r\nthat the white citizens do who have enjoyed the advantages of\r\ncivilization, education, Christian culture and self-respect which\r\ncan only be attained by those who share in making the laws under\r\nwhich they live.\r\n\r\nDo our Democratic friends assume that the negroes are not human?\r\nI have heard professed Democrats claim even that; but do the\r\nauthors of this minority report insist that the negro is a beast?\r\nIs his body not tenanted by an immortal spirit? If this is the\r\nposition of the gentlemen, then I confess a beast cannot reason,\r\nand this minority committee are right in declaring that \"the\r\nnegro can develop no inventive faculties or genius for the arts.\"\r\nFor although the elephant may be taught to plow, or the dog to\r\ncarry your market-basket by his teeth, you cannot teach them to\r\nshave notes, to speculate in gold, or even to vote; whereas, the\r\nexperience of all political parties shows that men may be taught\r\nto vote, even when they do not know what the ticket means.\r\n\r\nBut if the colored man is indeed a man, then his manhood with\r\nproper training can be developed. His soul may appear dormant,\r\nhis brain inactive, but there is a vitality there; and Nature\r\nwill assert herself if you will give her the opportunity.\r\n\r\nSuppose an inhabitant of another planet should drop down upon\r\nthis portion of our globe at mid-winter. He would find the earth\r\ncovered with snow and ice, and congealed almost to the\r\nconsistency of granite. The trees are leafless, everything is\r\ncold and barren; no green thing is to be seen; the inhabitants\r\nare chilled, and stalk about shivering, from place to place; he\r\nwould exclaim, \"Surely this is not life; this means annihilation.\r\nNo flesh and blood can long endure this; this frozen earth is\r\nbound in the everlasting embraces of adamantine frost, and can\r\nnever develop vegetation for the sustenance of any living thing.\"\r\nHe little dreams of the priceless myriads of germs which\r\nbountiful Nature has safely garnered in the warm bosom of our\r\nmother earth; he sees no evidence of that vitality which the\r\nbeneficent sun will develop to grace and beautify the world. But\r\nlet him remain till March or April, and as the snow begins to\r\nmelt away, he discovers the beautiful crocus struggling through\r\nthe half-frozen ground; the snow-drops appear in all their chaste\r\nbeauty; the buds of the swamp-maple shoot forth; the beautiful\r\nmagnolia opens her splendid blossoms; the sassafras adds its\r\nevidence of life; the pearl-white blossoms of the dog-wood light\r\nup every forest: and while our stranger is rubbing his eyes in\r\nastonishment, the earth is covered with her emerald velvet\r\ncarpet; rich foliage and brilliant colored blossoms adorn the\r\ntrees; fragrant flowers are enwreathing every wayside; the\r\nswift-winged birds float through the air and send forth joyous\r\nnotes of gratitude from every tree-top; the merry lambs skip\r\njoyfully around their verdant pasture-grounds; and everywhere is\r\nour stranger surrounded with life, beauty, joy and gladness.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the poor African. You may take a dozen specimens of\r\nboth sexes from the lowest type of man found in Africa; their\r\nrace has been buried for ages in ignorance and barbarism, and you\r\ncan scarcely perceive that they have any more of manhood or\r\nwomanhood than so many orang-outangs or gorillas. You look at\r\ntheir low foreheads, their thick skulls and lips, their woolly\r\nheads, their flat noses, their dull, lazy eyes, and you may he\r\ntempted to adopt the language of this minority committee, and\r\nexclaim: Surely these people have \"no inventive faculties, no\r\ngenius for the arts, or for any of those occupations requiring\r\nintellect and wisdom.\" But bring them out into the light of\r\ncivilization; let them and their children come into the genial\r\nsunshine of Christianity; teach them industry, self-reliance, and\r\nself-respect; let them learn what too few white Christians have\r\nyet understood, that cleanliness is akin to godliness, and a part\r\nof godliness; and the human soul will begin to develop itself.\r\nEach generation, blessed with churches and common schools will\r\ngradually exhibit the result of such culture; the low foreheads\r\nwill be raised and widened by an active and expanded brain; the\r\nvacant eye of barbarism, ignorance and idleness will light up\r\nwith the fire of intelligence, education, ambition, activity and\r\nChristian civilization; and you will find the immortal soul\r\nasserting her dignity, by the development of a man who would\r\nstartle by his intelligence the honorable gentleman from\r\nWallingford, who has presumed to compare beings made in God's\r\nimage with \"oxen and asses.\" That honorable gentleman, if he is\r\nrightly reported in the papers (I did not have the happiness to\r\nhear his speech), has mistaken the nature of the colored man. The\r\nhonorable gentleman reminds me of the young man who went abroad,\r\nand when he returned, there was nothing in America that could\r\ncompare with what he had seen in foreign lands. Niagara Falls was\r\nnowhere; the White Mountains were \"knocked higher than a kite\" by\r\nMont Blanc; our rivers were so large that they were vulgar, when\r\ncontrasted with the beautiful little streams and rivulets of\r\nEurope; our New York Central Park was eclipsed by the Bois de\r\nBologne and the Champs Elysees of Paris, or Hyde or Regent Park\r\nof London, to say nothing of the great Phoenix Park at Dublin.\r\n\r\n\"They have introduced a couple of Venetian gondolas on the large\r\npond in Central Park,\" remarked a friend.\r\n\r\n\"All very well,\" replied the verdant traveler, \"but between you\r\nand me, these birds can't stand our cold climate more than one\r\nseason.\" The gentleman from Wallingford evidently had as little\r\nidea of the true nature of the African as the young swell had of\r\nthe pleasure-boats of Venice.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Wallingford: \"The gentleman misapprehends my\r\nremarks. The gentleman from Norwich had urged that the negro\r\nshould vote because they have fought in our battles. I replied\r\nthat oxen and asses can fight, and therefore should, on the same\r\ngrounds, be entitled to vote.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum: I accept the gentleman's explanation. Doubtless\r\nGeneral Grant will feel himself highly complimented when he\r\nlearns that it requires no greater capacity to handle the musket,\r\nand meet armed battalions in the field, than \"oxen and asses\"\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nLet the educated free negro feel that he is a man; let him be\r\ntrained in New England churches, schools and workshops; let him\r\nsupport himself, pay his taxes, and cast his vote, like other\r\nmen, and he will put to everlasting shame the champions of modern\r\nDemocracy, by the overwhelming evidence he will give in his own\r\nperson of the great Scripture truth, that \"God has made of one\r\nblood all the nations of men.\" A human soul, \"that God has\r\ncreated and Christ died for,\" is not to be trifled with. It may\r\ntenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot--it\r\nis still an immortal spirit; and, amid all assumptions of caste,\r\nit will in due time vindicate the great fact that, without regard\r\nto color or condition, all men are equally children of the common\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nA few years since, an English lord and his family were riding in\r\nhis carriage in Liverpool. It was an elegant equipage; the\r\nservants were dressed in rich livery; the horses caparisoned in\r\nthe most costly style; and everything betokened that the\r\nestablishment belonged to a scion of England's proudest\r\naristocracy. The carriage stopped in front of a palatial\r\nresidence. At this moment a poor beggar woman rushed to the side\r\nof the carriage, and gently seizing the lady by the hand,\r\nexclaimed, \"For the love of God give me something to save my poor\r\nsick children from starvation. You are rich; I am your poor\r\nsister, for God is our common Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed the proud lady, casting the woman's hand\r\naway; \"don't call me sister; I have nothing in common with such\r\nlow brutes as you.\" And the great lady doubtless thought she was\r\nformed of finer clay than this suffering mendicant; but when a\r\nfew days afterward she was brought to a sick bed by the smallpox,\r\ncontracted by touching the hand of that poor wretch, she felt the\r\nevidence that they belonged to the same great family, and were\r\nsubject to the same pains and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe State of Connecticut, like New Jersey, is a border State of\r\nNew York. New York has a great commercial city, where aldermen\r\nrob by the tens of thousands, and where principal is studied much\r\nmore than principle. I can readily understand how the negro has\r\ncome to be debased at the North as well as at the South. The\r\ninterests of the two sections in the product of negro labor were\r\nnearly identical. The North wanted Southern cotton and the South\r\nwas ready in turn to buy from the North whatever was needed in\r\nthe way of Northern supplies and manufactures. This community of\r\ncommercial interests led to an identity in political principles,\r\nespecially in matters pertaining to the negro race--the working\r\nrace of the South--which produced the cotton and consumed so much\r\nof what Northern merchants and manufacturers sold for plantation\r\nuse. The Southern planters were good customers and were worth\r\nconciliating. So when Connecticut proposed in 1818 to continue to\r\nadmit colored men to the franchise, the South protested against\r\nthus elevating the negroes, and Connecticut succumbed. No other\r\nNew England State has ever so disgraced herself; and now\r\nConnecticut Democrats are asked to permit the white citizens of\r\nthis State to express their opinion in regard to reinstating the\r\ncolored man where our Revolutionary sires placed him under the\r\nConstitution. Now, gentlemen, \"Democrats,\" as you call\r\nyourselves, you who speak so flippantly of your \"loyalty,\" your\r\n\"love for the Union\" and your \"love for the people\"; you who are\r\ngenerally talking right and voting wrong, we ask you to come\r\nforward and act \"democratically,\" by letting your masters, the\r\npeople, speak.\r\n\r\nThe word \"white\" in the Constitution cannot be strictly and\r\nliterally construed. The opposition express great love for white\r\nblood. Will they let a mulatto vote half the time, a quadroon\r\nthree-fourths, and an octoroon seven-eighths of the time? If not,\r\nwhy not? Will they enslave seven-eighths of a white man because\r\none-eighth is not Caucasian? Is this democratic? Shall not the\r\nmajority seven control the minority one? Out on such \"democracy.\"\r\n\r\nBut a Democratic minority committee (of two) seem to have done\r\nsomething besides study ethnology. They have also paid great\r\nattention to fine arts, and are particularly anxious that all\r\nvoters shall have a \"genius for the arts.\" I would like to ask\r\nthem if it has always been political practice to insist that\r\nevery voter in the great \"unwashed\" and \"unterrified\" of any\r\nparty should become a member of the Academy of Arts before he\r\nvotes the \"regular\" ticket? I thought he was received into the\r\nfull fellowship of a political party if he could exhibit\r\nsufficient \"inventive faculties and genius for the arts,\" to\r\nenable him to paint a black eye. Can a man whose \"genius for the\r\narts\" enables him to strike from the shoulder scientifically, be\r\nadmitted to full fellowship in a political party? Is it evident\r\nthat the political artist has studied the old masters, if he\r\nexhibits his genius by tapping an opponent's head with a\r\nshillelah? The oldest master in this school of art was Cain; and\r\nso canes have been made to play their part in politics, at the\r\npolls and even in the United States Senate Chamber.\r\n\r\nIs \"genius for the arts and those occupations requiring intellect\r\nand wisdom\" sufficiently exemplified in adroitly stuffing\r\nballot-boxes, forging soldiers' votes, and copying a directory,\r\nas has been done, as the return list of votes? Is the \"inventive\r\nfaculty\" of \"voting early and often\" a passport to political\r\nbrotherhood? Is it satisfactory evidence of \"artistic\" genius, to\r\nhead a mob? and a mob which is led and guided by political\r\npassion, as numerous instances in our history prove, is the worst\r\nof mobs. Is it evidence of \"high art\" to lynch a man by hanging\r\nhim to the nearest tree or lamp-post? Is a \"whisky scrimmage\" one\r\nof the lost arts restored? We all know how certain \"artists\" are\r\nprone to embellish elections and to enhance the excitements of\r\npolitical campaigns by inciting riots, and the frequency with\r\nwhich these disgraceful outbreaks have occurred of late,\r\nespecially in some of the populous cities, is cause for just\r\nalarm. It is dangerous \"art.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker: I repeat that I am a friend to the Irishman. I have\r\ntraveled through his native country and have seen how he is\r\noppressed. I have listened to the eloquent and patriotic appeals\r\nof Daniel O'Connell, in Conciliation Hall, in Dublin, and I have\r\ngladly contributed to his fund for ameliorating the condition of\r\nhis countrymen. I rejoice to see them rushing to this land of\r\nliberty and independence; and it is because I am their friend\r\nthat I denounce the demagogues who attempt to blind and mislead\r\nthem to vote in the interests of any party against the interests\r\nof humanity, and the principles of true democracy. My neighbors\r\nwill testify that at mid-winter I employ Irishmen by the hundred\r\nto do work that is not absolutely necessary, in order to help\r\nthem support their families.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the minority report last week, I began to feel that\r\nI might be disfranchised, for I have no great degree of \"genius\r\nfor the arts;\" I felt, therefore, that I must get \"posted\" on\r\nthat subject as soon as possible. I at once sauntered into the\r\nSenate Chamber to look at the paintings: there I saw portraits of\r\ngreat men, and I saw two empty frames from which the pictures had\r\nbeen removed. These missing paintings, I was told, were portraits\r\nof two ex-Governors of the State, whose position on political\r\naffairs was obnoxious to the dominant party in the Legislature;\r\nand especially obnoxious were the supposed sentiments of these\r\ngovernors on the war. Therefore, the Senate voted to remove the\r\npictures, and thus proved, as it would seem, that there is an\r\nintimate connection between politics and art.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly traveled through every State in the South, and\r\nI assert, what every intelligent officer and soldier who has\r\nresided there will corroborate, that the slaves, as a body are\r\nmore intelligent than the poor whites. No man who has not been\r\nthere can conceive to what a low depth of ignorance the poor\r\nsnuff-taking, clay-eating whites of some portions of the South\r\nhave descended. I trust the day is not far distant when the\r\n\"common school\" shall throw its illuminating rays through this\r\nEgyptian pall.\r\n\r\nI have known slave mechanics to be sold for $3,000, and even\r\n$5,000 each, and others could not be bought at all; and I have\r\nseen intelligent slaves acting as stewards for their masters,\r\ntraveling every year to New Orleans, Nashville, and even to\r\nCincinnati, to dispose of their masters' crops. The tree colored\r\ncitizens of Opelousas, St. Martinsville, and all the Attakapas\r\ncountry in Louisiana, are as respectable and intelligent as an\r\nordinary community of whites. They speak the French and English\r\nlanguages, educate their children in music and \"the arts,\" and\r\nthey pay their taxes on more than fifteen millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the opposition, I beseech you to remember that our\r\nState and our country ask from us something more than party\r\ntactics. It is absolutely necessary that the loyal blacks at the\r\nSouth should vote, in order to save the loyal whites. Let\r\nConnecticut, without regard to party, set them an example that\r\nshall influence the action at the South, and prevent a new form\r\nof slavery from arising there, which shall make all our\r\nexpenditure of blood and treasure fruitless.\r\n\r\nBut some persons have this color prejudice simply by the force of\r\neducation, and they say, \"Well, a nigger is a nigger, and he\r\ncan't be anything else. I hate niggers, anyhow.\" Twenty years ago\r\nI crossed the Atlantic, and among our passengers was an Irish\r\njudge, who was coming out to Newfoundland as chief justice. He\r\nwas an exceedingly intelligent and polished gentleman, and\r\nextremely witty. The passengers from the New England States and\r\nthose from the South got into a discussion on the subject of\r\nslavery, which lasted three days. The Southerners were finally\r\nworsted, and when their arguments were exhausted, they fell back\r\non the old story, by saying: \"Oh! curse a nigger, he ain't half\r\nhuman anyhow; he had no business to be a nigger, etc.\" One of the\r\ngentlemen then turned to the Irish judge, and asked his opinion\r\nof the merits of the controversy. The judge replied:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I have listened with much edification to your\r\narguments pro and con during three days. I was quite inclined to\r\nthink the anti-slavery gentlemen had justice and right on their\r\nside, but the last argument from the South has changed my mind. I\r\nsay a 'nigger has no business to be a nigger,' and we should kick\r\nhim out of society and trample him under foot--always provided,\r\ngentlemen, you prove he was born black at his own particular\r\nrequest. If he had no word to say in the matter, of course he is\r\nblameless for his color, and is entitled to the same respect that\r\nother men are who properly behave themselves!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker: I am no politician; I came to this legislature\r\nsimply because I wish to have the honor of voting for the two\r\nconstitutional amendments--one for driving slavery entirely out\r\nof our country; the other to allow men of education and good\r\nmoral character to vote, regardless of the color of their skins.\r\nTo give my voice for these two philanthropic, just and Christian\r\nmeasures is all the glory I ask legislativewise. I care nothing\r\nwhatever for any sect or party under heaven, as such. I have no\r\naxes to grind, no logs to roll, no favors to ask. All I desire is\r\nto do what is right, and prevent what is wrong. I believe in no\r\n\"expediency\" that is not predicated of justice, for in all\r\nthings--politics, as well as everything else--I know that\r\n\"honesty is the best policy.\" A retributive Providence will\r\nunerringly and speedily search out all wrong-doing; hence, right\r\nis always the best in the long run. Certainly,, in the light of\r\nthe great American spirit of liberty and equal rights which is\r\nsweeping over this country, and making the thrones of tyrants\r\ntotter in the Old World, no party can afford to carry slavery,\r\neither of body or of mind. Knock off your manacles and let the\r\nman go free. Take down the blinds from his intellect, and let in\r\nthe light of education and Christian culture. When this is done\r\nyou have developed a man. Give him the responsibility of a man\r\nand the self-respect of a man, by granting him the right of\r\nsuffrage, Let universal education, and the universal franchise be\r\nthe motto of free America, and the toiling millions of Europe,\r\nwho are watching you with such intense interest, will hail us as\r\ntheir saviours. Let us loyally sink \"party\" on this question, and\r\ngo for \"God and our Country.\" Let no man attach an eternal stigma\r\nto his name by shutting his eyes to the great lesson of the hour,\r\nand voting against permitting the people to express their opinion\r\non this important subject. Let us unanimously grant this truly\r\ndemocratic boon. Then, when our laws of franchise are settled on\r\na just basis, let future parties divide where they honestly\r\ndiffer on State or national questions which do nor trench upon\r\nthe claims of manhood or American citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. BURNING OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nHOW BARNUM RECEIVED THE TIDINGS--HUMOROUS DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\nFIRE--A PUBLIC CALAMITY--GREELEY'S ADVICE--INTENTION TO\r\nRE-ESTABLISH THE MUSEUM--SPEECH AT EMPLOYEES' BENEFIT.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th day of July, 1865, when Barnum was speaking in the\r\nLegislature at Hartford, against the railroad schemes, a telegram\r\nwas handed him from his son-in-law and assistant manager in New\r\nYork, S. H. Hurd, saying that the American Museum was in flames\r\nand its total destruction certain.\r\n\r\nBarnum glanced at the dispatch, folded and laid it in his desk,\r\nand went calmly on with his speech. At the conclusion of his\r\nremarks, the bill which he was advocating was voted upon and\r\ncarried, and the House adjourned.\r\n\r\nNot until then did Barnum hand the telegram to his friend,\r\nWilliam G. Coe, of Winsted, who immediately communicated the\r\nintelligence to several members.\r\n\r\nWarm sympathizers at once crowded around him, and one of his\r\nstrongest opponents pushing forward, seized his hand, and said:\r\n\"Mr. Barnum, I am truly sorry to hear of your great misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" replied Barnum; \"why, my dear sir, I shall not have time\r\nto be sorry in a week! It will take me at least that length of\r\ntime before I can get over laughing at having whipped you all so\r\nnicely on that bill.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did find time to be sorry when, next day, he went to New\r\nYork and saw nothing of what had been the American Museum but a\r\nsmouldering mass of debris.\r\n\r\nHere was destroyed, in a few hours, the result of many years'\r\ntoil in accumulating from every part of the world myriads of\r\ncurious productions of nature and art--a collection which a half\r\na million of dollars and a quarter of a century could not\r\nrestore.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there were many Revolutionary relics and\r\nother articles of historical interest that could never be\r\nduplicated. Not a thousand dollars worth of property was saved;\r\nthe loss was irreparable, and the insurance was only forty\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe fire probably originated in the engine-room, where steam was\r\nconstantly kept up to pump fresh air into the waters of the\r\naquaria and to propel the immense fans for cooling the atmosphere\r\nof the rooms.\r\n\r\nAll the New York newspapers made a great \"sensation\" of the fire,\r\nand the full particulars were copied in journals throughout the\r\ncountry. A facetious reporter; Mr. Nathan D. Urner, of the\r\nTribune, wrote the following amusing account, which appeared in\r\nthat journal, July 14, 1865, and was very generally quoted from\r\nand copied by provincial papers, many of whose readers accepted\r\nevery line of the glowing narrative as \"gospel truth\":\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the breaking out of the conflagration, a number of\r\nstrange and terrible howls and moans proceeding from the large\r\napartment in the third floor of the Museum, corner of Ann street\r\nand Broadway, startled the throngs who had collected in front of\r\nthe burning building, and who were at first under the impression\r\nthat the sounds must proceed from human beings unable to effect\r\ntheir escape. Their anxiety was somewhat relieved on this score,\r\nbut their consternation was by no means decreased upon learning\r\nthat the room in question was the principal chamber of the\r\nmenagerie connected with the Museum, and that there was imminent\r\ndanger of the release of the animals there confined, by the\r\naction of the flames. Our reporter fortunately occupied a room on\r\nthe north corner of Ann street and Broadway, the windows of which\r\nlooked immediately into this apartment; and no sooner was he\r\napprised of the fire than he repaired there, confident of finding\r\nitems in abundance. Luckily the windows of the Museum were\r\nunclosed, and he had a perfect view of almost the entire interior\r\nof the apartment. The following is his statement of what\r\nfollowed, in his own language.\r\n\r\n\"Protecting myself from the intense heat as well as I could by\r\ntaking the mattress from the bed and erecting it as a bulwark\r\nbefore the window, with only enough space reserved on the top so\r\nas to look out, I anxiously observed the animals in the opposite\r\nroom. Immediately opposite the window through which I gazed was a\r\nlarge cage containing a lion and lioness. To the right hand was\r\nthe three-storied cage, containing monkeys at the top, two\r\nkangaroos in the second story, and a happy family of cats, rats,\r\nadders, rabbits, etc., in the lower apartment. To the left of the\r\nlions' cage was the tank containing the two vast alligators, and\r\nstill further to the left, partially hidden from my sight, was\r\nthe grand tank containing the great white whale, which has\r\ncreated such a furore in our sightseeing midst for the past few\r\nweeks. Upon the floor were caged the boa-constrictor, anacondas\r\nand rattlesnakes, whose heads would now and then rise menacingly\r\nthrough the top of the cage. In the extreme right was the cage,\r\nentirely shut from my view at first, containing the Bengal tiger\r\nand the Polar bear, whose terrific growls could be distinctly\r\nheard from behind the partition. With a simultaneous bound the\r\nlion and his mate sprang against the bars, which gave way and\r\ncame down with a great crash, releasing the beasts, which for a\r\nmoment, apparently amazed at their sudden liberty, stood in the\r\nmiddle of the floor lashing their sides with their tails and\r\nroaring dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"Almost at the same moment the upper part of the three-storied\r\ncage, consumed by the flames, fell forward, letting the rods drop\r\nto the floor, and many other animals were set free. Just at this\r\ntime the door fell through and the flames and smoke rolled in\r\nlike a whirlwind from the Hadean river Cocytus. A horrible scene\r\nin the right-hand corner of the room, a yell of indescribable\r\nagony, and a crashing, grating sound, indicated that the tiger\r\nand Polar bear were stirred up to the highest pitch of\r\nexcitement. Then there came a great crash, as of the giving way\r\nof the bars of their cage. The flames and smoke momentarily\r\nrolled back, and for a few seconds the interior of the room was\r\nvisible in the lurid light of the flames, which revealed the\r\ntiger and the lion, locked together in close combat.\r\n\r\n\"The monkeys were perched around the windows, shivering with\r\ndread, and afraid to jump out. The snakes were writhing about,\r\ncrippled and blistered by the heat, darting out their forked\r\ntongues, and expressing their rage and fear in the most sibilant\r\nof hisses. The 'Happy Family' were experiencing an amount of\r\nbeatitude which was evidently too cordial for philosophical\r\nenjoyment. A long tongue of flame had crept under the cage,\r\ncompletely singing every hair from the cat's body. The felicitous\r\nadder was slowly burning in two and busily engaged in\r\nimpregnating his organic system with his own venom. The joyful\r\nrat had lost his tail by a falling bar of iron; and the beatific\r\nrabbit, perforated by a red-hot nail, looked as if nothing would\r\nbe more grateful than a cool corner in some Esquimaux farm-yard.\r\nThe members of the delectated convocation were all huddled\r\ntogether in the bottom of their cage, which suddenly gave way,\r\nprecipitating them out of view in the depths below, which by this\r\ntime were also blazing like the fabled Tophet.\r\n\r\n\"At this moment the flames rolled again into the room, and then\r\nagain retired. The whale and alligators were by this time\r\nsuffering dreadful torments. The water in which they swam was\r\nliterally boiling. The alligators dashed fiercely about,\r\nendeavoring to escape, and opening and shutting their great jaws\r\nin ferocious torture; but the poor whale, almost boiled, with\r\ngreat ulcers bursting from his blubbery sides, could only feebly\r\nswim about, though blowing excessively, and every now and then\r\nsending up great fountains of spray. At length, crack went the\r\nglass sides of the great cases, and whale and alligators rolled\r\nout on the floor with the rushing and steaming water. The whale\r\ndied easily, having been pretty well used up before. A few great\r\ngasps and a convulsive flap or two of his mighty flukes were his\r\nexpiring spasm. One of the alligators was killed almost\r\nimmediately by falling across a great fragment of shattered\r\nglass, which cut open his stomach and let out the greater part of\r\nhis entrails to the light of day. The remaining alligator became\r\ninvolved in a controversy with an anaconda, and joined the melee\r\nin the centre of the flaming apartment.\r\n\r\n\"A number of birds which were caged in the upper part of the\r\nbuilding were set free by some charitably inclined person at the\r\nfirst alarm of fire, and at intervals they flew out. There were\r\nmany valuable tropical birds, parrots, cockatoos, mockingbirds,\r\nhumming-birds, etc., as well as some vultures and eagles, and one\r\ncondor. Great excitement existed among the swaying crowds in the\r\nstreets below as they took wing. There were confined in the same\r\nroom a few serpents, which also obtained their liberty; and soon\r\nafter the rising and devouring flames began to enwrap the entire\r\nbuilding, a splendid and emblematic sight was presented to the\r\nwondering and upgazing throngs. Bursting through the central\r\ncasement, with flap of wings and lashing coils, appeared an eagle\r\nand a serpent wreathed in fight. For a moment they hung poised in\r\nmid-air, presenting a novel and terrible conflict. It was the\r\nearth and air (or their respective representatives) at war for\r\nmastery; the base and the lofty, the groveller and the soarer,\r\nwere engaged in deadly battle. At length the flat head of the\r\nserpent sank; his writhing, sinuous form grew still; and wafted\r\nupward by the cheers of the gazing multitude, the eagle, with a\r\nscream of triumph, and bearing his prey in his iron talons,\r\nsoared towards the sun. Several monkeys escaped from the burning\r\nbuilding to the neighboring roofs and streets; and considerable\r\nexcitement was caused by the attempts to secure them. One of the\r\nmost amusing incidents in this respect, was in connection with\r\nMr. James Gordon Bennett. The veteran editor of the Herald was\r\nsitting in his private office, with his back to the open window,\r\ncalmly discussing with a friend the chances that the Herald\r\nestablishment would escape the conflagration, which at that time\r\nwas threateningly advancing up Ann street towards Nassau street.\r\nIn the course of his conversation, Mr. Bennett observed:\r\n'Although I have usually had good luck in cases of fire, they say\r\nthat the devil is ever at one's shoulder, and'--here an\r\nexclamation from his friend interrupted him, and turning quickly\r\nhe was considerably taken aback at seeing the devil himself, or\r\nsomething like him, at his very shoulder as he spoke. Recovering\r\nhis equanimity, with the ease and suavity which is usual with him\r\nin all company, Mr. Bennett was about to address the intruder,\r\nwhen he perceived that what he had taken for the gentleman in\r\nblack was nothing more than a frightened orang-outang. The poor\r\ncreature, but recently released from captivity, and doubtless\r\nthinking that he might fill some vacancy in the editorial corps\r\nof the paper in question, had descended by the water-pipe and\r\ninstinctively taken refuge in the inner sanctum of the\r\nestablishment. Although the editor--perhaps from the fact that he\r\nsaw nothing peculiarly strange in the visitation--soon regained\r\nhis composure, it was far otherwise with his friend, who\r\nimmediately gave the alarm. Mr. Hudson rushed in and boldly\r\nattacked the monkey, grasping him by the throat. The book-editor\r\nnext came in, obtaining a clutch upon the brute by the ears; the\r\nmusical critic followed and seized the tail with both hands, and\r\na number of reporters, armed with inkstands and sharpened\r\npencils, came next, followed by a dozen policemen with brandished\r\nclubs; at the same time, the engineer in the basement received\r\nthe preconcerted signal and got ready his hose, wherewith to pour\r\nboiling hot water upon the heads of, those in the streets, in\r\ncase it should prove a regular systematized attack by gorillas,\r\nBrazil apes, and chimpanzees. Opposed to this formidable\r\ncombination the rash intruder fared badly, and was soon in\r\ndurance vile. Numerous other incidents of a similar kind\r\noccurred; but some of the most amusing were in connection with\r\nthe wax figures.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the same impulse which prompts men in time of fire to fling\r\nvaluable looking-glasses out of three-story windows, and at the\r\nsame time tenderly to lower down feather beds--soon after the\r\nMuseum took fire, a number of sturdy firemen rushed into the\r\nbuilding to carry out the wax figures. There were thousands of\r\nvaluable articles which might have been saved if there had been\r\nless of solicitude displayed for the miserable effigies which are\r\nusually exhibited under the appellation of 'wax figures.' As it\r\nwas, a dozen firemen rushed into the apartment where the figures\r\nwere kept, amid a multitude of crawling snakes, chattering\r\nmonkeys and escaped paroquets. The 'Dying Brigand' was\r\nunceremoniously throttled and dragged towards the door; liberties\r\nwere taken with the tearful 'Senorita' who has so long knelt and\r\nso constantly wagged her doll's head at his side; the mules of\r\nthe other bandits were upset, and they themselves roughly seized.\r\nThe full-length statue of P. T. Barnum fell down of its own\r\naccord, as if disgusted with the whole affair. A red-shined\r\nfireman seized with either hand Franklin Pierce and James\r\nBuchanan by their coat-collars, tucked the Prince Imperial of\r\nFrance under one arm and the Veiled Murderess under the other,\r\nand coolly departed for the street. Two ragged boys quarreled\r\nover the Tom Thumb, but at length settled the controversy by one\r\nof them taking the head, the other satisfying himself with the\r\nlegs below the knees. They evidently had Tom under their thumbs,\r\nand intended to keep him down. While the curiosity-seeking\r\npoliceman was garroting Benjamin Franklin, with the idea of\r\nabducting him, a small monkey, flung from the windowsill by the\r\nstrong hand of an impatient fireman, made a straight dive,\r\nhitting Poor Richard just below the waistcoat, and passing\r\nthrough his stomach, as fairly as the Harlequin in the 'Green\r\nMonster' pantomime ever pierced the picture with the slit in it,\r\nwhich always hangs so conveniently low and near. Patrick Henry\r\nhad his teeth knocked out by a flying missile, and in carrying\r\nDaniel Lambert down stairs, he was found to be so large that they\r\nhad to break off his head in order to get him through the door.\r\nAt length the heat became intense, the 'figgers' began to\r\nperspire freely, and the swiftly approaching flames compelled all\r\nhands to desist from any further attempt at rescue. Throwing a\r\nparting glance behind as we passed down the stairs, we saw the\r\nremaining dignitaries in a strange plight. Some one had stuck a\r\ncigar in General Washington's mouth, and thus, with his chapeau\r\ncrushed down over his eyes and his head leaning upon the ample\r\nlap of Moll Pitcher, the Father of his Country led the van of as\r\nsorry a band of patriots as not often comes within one's\r\nexperience to see. General Marion was playing a dummy game of\r\npoker with General Lafayette; Governor Morris was having a set-to\r\nwith Nathan Lane, and James Madison was executing a Dutch polka\r\nwith Madam Roland on one arm and Luicretia Borgia on the other.\r\nThe next moment the advancing flames compelled us to retire.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that all the living curiosities were saved; but the\r\ngiant girl, Anna Swan, was only rescued with the utmost\r\ndifficulty. There was not a door through which her bulky frame\r\ncould obtain a passage. It was likewise feared that the stairs\r\nwould break down, even if she should reach them. Her best friend,\r\nthe living skeleton, stood by her as long as he dared, but then\r\ndeserted her, while, as the heat grew in intensity, the\r\nperspiration rolled from her face in little brooks and rivulets,\r\nwhich pattered musically upon the floor. At length, as a last\r\nresort, the employees of the place procured a lofty derrick which\r\nfortunately happened to be standing near, and erected it\r\nalongside of the Museum. A portion of the wall was then broken\r\noff on each side of the window, the strong tackle was got in\r\nreadiness, the tall woman was made fast to one end and swung over\r\nthe heads of the people in the street, with eighteen men grasping\r\nthe other extremity of the line, and lowered down from the third\r\nstory, amid enthusiastic applause. A carriage of extraordinary\r\ncapacity was in readiness, and, entering this, the young lady was\r\ndriven away to a hotel.\r\n\r\n\"When the surviving serpents, that were released by the partial\r\nburning of the box in which they were contained, crept along on\r\nthe floor to the balcony of the Museum and dropped on the\r\nsidewalk, the crowd, seized with St. Patrick's aversion to the\r\nreptiles, fled with such precipitate haste that they knocked each\r\nother down and trampled on one another in the most reckless and\r\ndamaging manner.\r\n\r\n\"Hats were lost, coats torn, boots burst and pantaloons dropped\r\nwith magnificent miscellaneousness, and dozens of those who rose\r\nfrom the miry streets into which they had been thrown looked like\r\nthe disembodied spirits of a mud bank. The snakes crawled on the\r\nsidewalk and into Broadway, where some of them died from injuries\r\nreceived, and others were dispatched by the excited populace.\r\nSeveral of the serpents of the copper-head species escaped the\r\nfury of the tumultuous masses, and, true to their instincts,\r\nsought shelter in the World and News offices. A large black bear\r\nescaped from the burning Museum into Ann street, and then made\r\nhis way into Nassau, and down that thoroughfare into Wall, where\r\nhis appearance caused a sensation. Some superstitious persons\r\nbelieved him the spirit of a departed Ursa Major, and others of\r\nhis fraternity welcomed the animal as a favorable omen. The bear\r\nwalked quietly along to the Custom House, ascended the steps of\r\nthe building, and became bewildered, as many a biped bear has\r\ndone before him. He seemed to lose his sense of vision, and, no\r\ndoubt, endeavoring to operate for a fall, walked over the side of\r\nthe steps and broke his neck. He succeeded in his object, but it\r\ncost him dearly. The appearance of Bruin in the street sensibly\r\naffected the stock market, and shares fell rapidly; but when he\r\nlost his life in the careless manner we have described, shares\r\nadvanced again, and the Bulls triumphed once more.\r\n\r\n\"Broadway and its crossings have not witnessed a denser throng\r\nfor months than assembled at the fire yesterday. Barnum's was\r\nalways popular, but it never drew so vast a crowd before. There\r\nmust have been forty thousand people on Broadway, between Maiden\r\nLane and Chambers street, and a great portion stayed there until\r\ndusk. So great was the concourse of people that it was with\r\ndifficulty pedestrians or vehicles could pass.\r\n\r\n\"After the fire several high-art epicures, groping among the\r\nruins, found choice morsels of boiled whale, roasted kangaroo and\r\nfricasseed crocodile, which, it is said, they relished; though\r\nthe many would have failed to appreciate such rare edibles.\r\nProbably the recherche epicures will declare the only true way to\r\nprepare those meats is to cook them in a Museum wrapped in\r\nflames, in the same manner that the Chinese, according to Charles\r\nLamb, first discovered roast pig in a burning house, and ever\r\nafterward set a house on fire with a pig inside, when they wanted\r\nthat particular food.\"\r\n\r\nAll the New York journals, and many more in other cities,\r\neditorially expressed their sympathy with the misfortune, and\r\ntheir sense of the loss the community had sustained in the\r\ndestruction of the American Museum. The following editorial is\r\nfrom the New York Tribune of July 14, 1865:\r\n\r\n\"The destruction of no building in this city could have caused so\r\nmuch excitement and so much regret as that of Barnum's Museum.\r\nThe collection of curiosities was very large, and though many of\r\nthem may not have had much intrinsic or memorial value, a\r\nconsiderable portion was certainly of great worth for any Museum.\r\nBut aside from this, pleasant memories clustered about the place,\r\nwhich for so many years has been the chief resort for amusement\r\nto the common people who cannot often afford to treat themselves\r\nto a night at the more expensive theatres, while to the children\r\nof the city, Barnum's has been a fountain of delight, ever\r\noffering new attractions as captivating and as implicitly\r\nbelieved in as the Arabian Nights Entertainments: Theatre,\r\nMenagerie and Museum, it amused, instructed, and astonished. If\r\nits thousands and tens of thousands of annual visitors were\r\nbewildered sometimes with a Wooly Horse, a What is It? or a\r\nMermaid, they found repose and certainty in a Giraffe, a Whale or\r\na Rhinoceros. If wax effigies of pirates and murderers made them\r\nshudder lest those dreadful figures should start out of their\r\nglass cases and repeat their horrid deeds, they were reassured by\r\nthe presence of the mildest and most amiable of giants, and the\r\nfattest of mortal women, whose dead weight alone could crush all\r\nthe wax figures into their original cakes. It was a source of\r\nunfailing interest to all country visitors, and New York to many\r\nof them was only the place that held Barnum's Museum. It was the\r\nfirst thing--often the only thing--they visited when they came\r\namong us, and nothing that could have been contrived, out of our\r\npresent resources, could have offered so many attractions, unless\r\nsome more ingenious showman had undertaken to add to Barnum's\r\ncollection of waxen criminals by putting in a cage the live\r\nBoards of the Common Council. We mourn its loss, but not as\r\nwithout consolation. Barnum's Museum is gone, but Barnum himself,\r\nhappily, did not share the fate of his rattlesnakes and his, at\r\nleast, most \"un-Happy Family.\" There are fishes in the seas and\r\nbeasts in the forest; birds still fly in the air, and strange\r\ncreatures still roam in the deserts; giants and pigmies still\r\nwander up and down the earth; the oldest man, the fattest woman,\r\nand the smallest baby are still living, and Barnum will find\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Or even if none of these things or creatures existed, we could\r\ntrust to Barnum to make them out of hand. The Museum, then, is\r\nonly a temporary loss, and much as we sympathize with the\r\nproprietor, the public may trust to his well-known ability and\r\nenergy to soon renew a place of amusement which was a source of\r\nso much innocent pleasure, and had in it so many elements of\r\nsolid excellence.\"\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Mr. Barnum's insurance was but forty thousand\r\ndollars while the loss was fully four hundred thousand, and as\r\nhis premium was five per cent., he had already paid the insurance\r\ncompanies more than they returned to him.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse, on reckoning up his losses, was to retire from\r\nactive life and all business occupations, beyond what his real\r\nestate interests in Bridgeport and New York would compel. He went\r\nto his old friend, Horace Greeley, and asked for advice on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Accept this fire as a notice to quit, and go a-fishing,\" said\r\nMr. Greeley.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed Barnum.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go a-fishing,\" replied Greeley. \"Why, I have been wanting\r\nto go for thirty years, and have never yet found time to do so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd but for two considerations Barnum might have taken this\r\nadvice. One hundred and fifty employees were thrown out of work\r\nat a season when it would have been difficult to get anything\r\nelse to do. That was the most important consideration. Then, too,\r\nBarnum felt that a large city like New York needed a good Museum,\r\nand that his experience of a quarter of a century in that\r\ndirection afforded the greatest facilities for founding another\r\nestablishment of the kind. So he took a few days for reflection.\r\n\r\nThe Museum employees were tendered a benefit at the Academy of\r\nMusic, at which most of the dramatic artists in the city gave\r\ntheir services. At the conclusion Barnum was called for, and made\r\na brilliant speech, in which he announced that he had decided to\r\nestablish another Museum, and that, in order to give present\r\noccupation to his employees, he had engaged the Winter Garden\r\nTheatre for a few weeks, his new establishment promising to be\r\nready by fall.\r\n\r\nThe New York Sun commented on the speech as follows:\r\n\r\n\"One of the happiest impromptu oratorical efforts that we have\r\nheard for some time was that made by Barnum at the benefit\r\nperformance given for his employees on Friday afternoon. If a\r\nstranger wanted to satisfy himself how the great showman had\r\nmanaged so to monopolize the ear and eye of the public during his\r\nlong career, he could not have had a better opportunity of doing\r\nso than by listening to this address. Every word, though\r\ndelivered with apparent carelessness, struck a key-note in the\r\nhearts of his listeners. Simple, forcible and touching, it showed\r\nhow thoroughly this extraordinary man comprehends the character\r\nof his countrymen, and how easily he can play upon their\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\"Those who look upon Barnum as a mere charlatan, have really no\r\nknowledge of him. It would be easy to demonstrate that the\r\nqualities that have placed him in his present position of\r\nnotoriety and affluence would, in another pursuit, have raised\r\nhim to far greater eminence. In his breadth of views, his\r\nprofound knowledge of mankind, his courage under reverses, his\r\nindomitable perseverance, his ready eloquence and his admirable\r\nbusiness tact, we recognize the elements that are conducive to\r\nsuccess in most other pursuits. More than almost any other living\r\nman, Barnum may be said to be a representative type of the\r\nAmerican mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. POLITICAL LIFE.\r\n\r\nIN THE CONNECTICUT LEGISLATURE--THE GREAT RAILROAD\r\nFIGHT--BARNUM'S EFFECTIVE STROKE--CANVASSING FOR A UNITED STATES\r\nSENATOR--BARNUM'S CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN--A CHALLENGE THAT WAS\r\nNOT ACCEPTED.\r\n\r\nDuring his legislative career Mr. Barnum made many new friends\r\nand pleasant acquaintances, and there were many events great and\r\nsmall which tended to make the session memorable. Barnum was by\r\nno means an idle member. On several occasions, indeed, he took a\r\nmost conspicuous part in debates and in framing legislation. On\r\none occasion, a Representative, who was a lawyer, introduced\r\nresolutions to reduce the number of Representatives, urging that\r\nthe \"House\" was too large and ponderous a body to work smoothly;\r\nthat a smaller number of persons could accomplish business more\r\nrapidly and completely; and, in fact, that the Connecticut\r\nLegislature was so large that the members did not have time to\r\nget acquainted with each other before the body adjourned sine\r\ndie. Barnum replied, that the larger the number of\r\nRepresentatives, the more difficult it would be to tamper with\r\nthem; and if they all could not become personally acquainted, so\r\nmuch the better, for there would be fewer \"rings,\" and less\r\nfacilities for forcing improper legislation.\r\n\r\n\"As the House seems to be thin now, I will move to lay my\r\nresolutions on the table,\" remarked the member; \"but I shall call\r\nthem up when there is a full House.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to the gentleman's own theory,\" Barnum replied, \"the\r\nsmaller the number, the surer are we to arrive at correct\r\nconclusions. Now, therefore, is just the time to decide; and I\r\nmove that the gentleman's resolutions be considered.\" This\r\nproposition was seconded amid a roar of laughter; and the\r\nresolutions were almost unanimously voted down, before the member\r\nfairly comprehended what was going on. He afterwards acknowledged\r\nit as a pretty fair joke, and at any rate as an effective one.\r\n\r\nAt this time Connecticut had two capitals, Hartford and New\r\nHaven. The State House at Hartford was a wretched old building,\r\ntoo small and entirely unfit for the purposes to which it was\r\ndevoted; and that at New Haven was scarcely better. Barnum made a\r\nstrong effort to secure the erection of new buildings in both\r\ncities, and was made chairman of the committee having the matter\r\nin charge. During his investigations he ascertained that\r\nBridgeport, Middletown and Meriden would each be willing to erect\r\na fine new State House at its own cost, for the sake of being\r\nmade the capital of the State. Thus the jealousy of Hartford and\r\nNew Haven was greatly aroused, and committees of citizens waited\r\nupon Mr. Barnum, beseeching him not to press the matter of\r\nremoving the capital. In the end nothing definite was done, but\r\nyears afterward Hartford was made the sole capital and one of the\r\nfinest public buildings in the world was erected there.\r\n\r\nThe most notable event of the whole session however occurred near\r\nits close, when Barnum introduced a bill to amend the railroad\r\nlaw of the State by inserting in it the following:\r\n\r\n\"Section 508. No railroad company, which has had a system of\r\ncommutation fares in force for more than four years, shall\r\nabolish, alter, or modify the same, except for the regulation of\r\nthe price charged for such commutation; and such price shall, in\r\nno case, be raised to an extent that shall alter the ratio\r\nbetween such commutation and the rates then charged for way fare,\r\non the railroad of such company.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York and New Haven Railroad Company seemed determined to\r\nmove heaven and earth to prevent the passage of this law. The\r\nhalls of legislation were thronged with railroad lobbyists, who\r\nbutton-holed nearly every member. Barnum's motives were attacked,\r\nand the most foolish slanders were circulated. Not only every\r\nlegal man in the House was arrayed against him, but occasionally\r\na \"country member,\" who had promised to stick by and aid in\r\nchecking the cupidity of railroad managers, would drop off, and\r\nbe found voting on the other side. \"I devoted,\" says Barnum,\r\n\"many hours, and even days, to explaining the true state of\r\nthings to the members from the rural regions, and, although the\r\nprospect of carrying this great reform looked rather dark, I felt\r\nthat I had a majority of the honest and disinterested members of\r\nthe House with me. Finally, Senator Ballard informed me that he\r\nhad canvassed the Senate, and was convinced that the bill could\r\nbe carried through that body if I could be equally successful\r\nwith the House.\"\r\n\r\nThe date of the final debate and vote was fixed for the morning\r\nof July 13. At that time the excitement was intense. The State\r\nHouse was crowded with railroad lobbyists; for nearly every\r\nrailroad in the State had made common cause with the New York and\r\nNew Haven Company, and every Representative was in his seat,\r\nexcepting the sick man, who had doctored the railroads till he\r\nneeded doctoring himself. The debate was led off by skirmishers\r\non each side, and was finally closed on the part of the railroads\r\nby Mr. Harrison, of New Haven, who was chairman of the railroad\r\ncommittee. Mr. Harrison was a close and forcible debater and a\r\nclear-headed lawyer. His speech exhibited considerable thought,\r\nand his earnestness and high character as a gentleman of honor\r\ncarried much weight. Besides, his position as chairman of the\r\ncommittee naturally influenced some votes. He claimed to\r\nunderstand thoroughly the merits of the question, from having, in\r\nhis capacity as chairman, heard all the testimony and arguments\r\nwhich had come before that committee; and a majority of the\r\ncommittee, after due deliberation, had reported against the\r\nproposed bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum arose to close the debate. He endeavored to state\r\nbriefly the gist of the whole case. \"Only a few years before,\" he\r\nsaid, \"the New York and New Haven Company had fixed their own\r\nprice for commuters' tickets along the whole line of the road,\r\nand had thus induced hundreds of New York citizens to remove to\r\nConnecticut with their families, and build their houses on\r\nheretofore unimproved property, thus vastly increasing the value\r\nof the lands, and correspondingly helping our receipts for taxes.\r\nHe urged that there was a tacit understanding between the\r\nrailroad and these commuters and the public generally, that such\r\npersons as chose thus to remove from a neighboring State, and\r\nbring their families and capital within Connecticut's borders,\r\nshould have the right to pass over the railroad on the terms\r\nfixed at the time by the president and directors; 'that any claim\r\nthat the railroad could not afford to commute at the prices they\r\nhad themselves established was absurd, from the fact that, even\r\nnow, if one thousand families who reside in New York, and had\r\nnever been in our own State, should propose to the railroad to\r\nremove these families (embracing in the aggregate five thousand\r\npersons) to Connecticut, and build one thousand new houses on the\r\nline of the New York and New Haven Railroad, provided the\r\nrailroad would carry the male head of the family at all times for\r\nnothing, the company could well afford to accept the proposition,\r\nbecause they would receive full prices for transporting all other\r\nmembers of these families, at all times, as well as full prices\r\nfor all their visitors and servants.'\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he said, \"what are the facts? Do we desire the\r\nrailroad to carry even one-fifth of these new-comers for nothing?\r\nDo we, indeed, desire to compel them to transport them for any\r\ndefinitely fixed price at all? On the contrary, we find that\r\nduring the late rebellion, when gold was selling for two dollars\r\nand eighty cents per dollar, this company doubled its prices of\r\ncommutation, and retains the same prices now, although gold is\r\nbut one-half that amount ($1.40). We don't ask them to go back to\r\ntheir former prices; we don't compel them to rest even here; we\r\nsimply say, increase your rates, pile up your demands just as\r\nhigh as you desire, only you shall not make fish of one and fowl\r\nof another. You have fixed and increased your prices to\r\npassengers of all classes just as you liked, and established your\r\nown ratio between those who pay by the year and those who pay by\r\nthe single trip; and now, all we ask is, that you shall not\r\nchange the ratio. Charge ten dollars per passenger from New York\r\nto New Haven, if you have the courage to risk the competition of\r\nthe steamboats; and whatever percentage you choose to increase\r\nthe fare of transient passengers, we permit you to increase the\r\nrates of commuters in the same ratio.\r\n\r\n\"The interests of the State, as well as communities, demand this\r\nlaw; for if it is once fixed by statute that the prices of\r\ncommutation are not to be increased, many persons will leave the\r\nlocalities where extortion is permitted on the railroads, and\r\nwill settle in our State. But these railroad gentlemen say they\r\nhave no intention to increase their rates of commutation, and\r\nthey deprecate what they term 'premature legislation,' and an\r\nuncalled-for meddling with their affairs. Mr. Speaker, 'an ounce\r\nof prevention is worth a pound of cure.' Men engaged in plots\r\nagainst public interests always ask to be 'let alone.' Jeff Davis\r\nonly asked to be 'let alone,' when the North was raising great\r\narmies to prevent the dissolution of the Union. The people cannot\r\nafford to let these railroads alone. This hall, crowded with\r\nrailroad lobbyists, as the frogs thronged Egypt, is an admonition\r\nto all honest legislators that it is unsafe to allow the\r\nmonopolies the chance to rivet the chains which already fetter\r\nthe limbs of those whom circumstances place in the power of these\r\ncompanies.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point in his speech he was interrupted a messenger, who\r\nplaced in his hands a dispatch from his son-in-law in New York,\r\nmarked \"Urgent.\" He opened and read it. It announced that his\r\nMuseum had been totally destroyed by fire. He laid it upon his\r\ndesk, and without the slightest change of manner continued his\r\nargument, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"These railroad gentlemen absolutely deny any intention of\r\nraising the fares of commuters, and profess to think it very hard\r\nthat disinterested and conscientious gentlemen like them should\r\nbe judged by the doings of the Hudson River and Harlem Railroads.\r\nBut now, Mr. Speaker, I am going to expose the duplicity of these\r\nmen. I have had detectives on their track, for men who plot\r\nagainst public interest deserve to be watched. I have in my\r\npocket positive proofs that they did, and do, intend to spring\r\ntheir trap upon the unprotected commuters on the New York and New\r\nHaven Railroad.\"\r\n\r\nHe then drew from his pocket and read two telegrams received that\r\nmorning, one from New York and the other from Bridgeport,\r\nannouncing that the New York and New Haven Railroad Directory had\r\nheld a secret meeting in New York the day before, for the purpose\r\nof immediately raising the fares of commuters twenty per cent.,\r\nso that in case his bill became a law they could get ahead of\r\nhim. He continued:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Speaker, I know that these dispatches are true; my\r\ninformation is from the inside of the camp. I see a director of\r\nthe New York and New Haven Railroad sitting in this hall; I know\r\nthat he knows these dispatches are true; and if he will go before\r\nthe railroad committee and make oath that he don't know that such\r\na meeting took place yesterday, for exactly this purpose, I will\r\nforfeit and pay one thousand dollars to the families of poor\r\nsoldiers in this city. In consideration of this attempt to\r\nforestall the action of this Legislature, I offer an amendment to\r\nthe bill now under consideration, by adding after the word\r\n'ratio' the words 'as it existed on the 1st day of July, 1865.'\r\nIn this way we shall cut off any action which these sleek\r\ngentlemen may have taken yesterday. It is now evident that these\r\nrailroad gentlemen have set a trap for this Legislature; and I\r\npropose that we now spring the trap, and see if we cannot catch\r\nthese wily railroad directors in it. Mr. Speaker, I move the\r\nprevious question.\"\r\n\r\nThis revelation astounded the opposition, and the \"previous\r\nquestion\" was ordered. On the final vote the bill was carried\r\nthrough triumphantly, and has ever since remained an important\r\nitem in the statute-book of the State.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1866 Barnum was re-elected to represent the town\r\nof Fairfield in the Legislature. He had not intended to serve\r\nagain. But one of the directors of the railroad, who had led the\r\nopposition to Barnum's new railroad law, had openly boasted about\r\nthe town that Barnum should not be allowed to hold the office\r\nagain. It was in response to these boasts that Barnum decided to\r\naccept the nomination, and he was handsomely elected.\r\n\r\nThe leading issue before that Legislature was the election of a\r\nUnited States Senator. Andrew Johnson was then President of the\r\nUnited States, and had begun to break away from the Republican\r\nparty. One of the Connecticut Senators was following him in this\r\naction. The other Senator was now a candidate for re-election.\r\nBarnum had been an earnest admirer of him, but now ascertained\r\nthat he too was siding with Johnson. This caused Barnum to take\r\nan active part in opposing him, and the showman-legislator spent\r\nmany days and nights endeavoring to impress upon his colleagues\r\nthe importance of defeating this candidate and electing the Hon.\r\nO. S. Ferry to the Senatorship.\r\n\r\nExcitement ran high. At first Mr. Ferry had only a few votes. But\r\nunder Barnum's skilful leadership he at last obtained a majority\r\nin the party caucus and was accordingly elected.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer Barnum entertained many eminent politicians\r\nand other public men at his beautiful residence, Lindencroft.\r\nGovernor Hawley wanted him to serve as a Commissioner to the\r\nParis Exposition of 1867, but he was unable to do so.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1867 he was nominated for Congress by the\r\nRepublicans of the Fourth District. In referring to this episode,\r\nhe afterward remarked: \"Politics were always distasteful to me. I\r\npossessed, naturally, too much independence of mind, and too\r\nstrong a determination to do what I believe to be right,\r\nregardless of party expediency, to make a lithe and oily\r\npolitician. To be called on to favor applications from\r\noffice-seekers, without regard to their merits, and to do the\r\ndirty work too often demanded by political parties; to be \"all\r\nthings to all men,\" though not in the apostolic sense; to shake\r\nhands with those whom I despised, and to kiss the dirty babies of\r\nthose whose votes were courted, were political requirements which\r\nI felt I could never acceptably fulfil. Nevertheless, I had\r\nbecome, so far as business was concerned, almost a man of\r\nleisure; and some of my warmest personal friends insisted that a\r\nnomination to so high and honorable a position as a member of\r\nCongress was not to be lightly rejected, and so I consented to\r\nrun. Fairfield and Litchfield counties composed the district,\r\nwhich, in the preceding Congressional election, in 1865, and just\r\nafter the close of the war, was Republican. In the year\r\nfollowing, however, the district in the State election went\r\nDemocratic. I had this Democratic majority to contend against in\r\n1867, and as the whole State turned over and elected the\r\nDemocratic ticket, I lost my election. In the next succeeding\r\nCongressional election, in 1869, the Fourth District also elected\r\nthe only Democratic Congressman chosen from Connecticut that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"I was neither disappointed nor cast down by my defeat. The\r\npolitical canvass served the purpose of giving me a new\r\nsensation, and introducing me to new phases of human nature--a\r\nsubject which I had always great delight in studying. The filth\r\nand scandal, the slanders and vindictiveness, the plottings and\r\nfawnings, the fidelity, meanness and manliness,: which by turns\r\nexhibited themselves in the exciting scenes preceding the\r\nelection, were novel to me, and were so far interesting.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after my opponent was nominated I sent him the following\r\nletter, which was also published in the Bridgeport Standard:\r\n\r\n\" 'BRIDGEPORT, Conn., February 21, 1867.\r\n\" 'W. H. BARNUM, Esq., Salisbury, Conn.:\r\n\r\n\" 'Dear Sir: Observing that the Democratic party has nominated\r\nyou for Congress from this district, I desire to make you a\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\" 'The citizens of this portion of our State will be compelled,\r\non the first Monday in April next, to decide whether you or\r\nmyself shall represent their interests and their principles in\r\nthe Fortieth Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\n\" 'The theory of our government is, that the will of the people\r\nshall be the law of the land. It is important, therefore, that\r\nthe people shall vote understandingly, and especially at this\r\nimportant crisis in our national existence. In order that the\r\nvoters of this district shall fully comprehend the principles by\r\nwhich each of their Congressional candidates is guided, I\r\nrespectfully invite you to meet me in a serious and candid\r\ndiscussion of the important political issues of the day at\r\nvarious towns in the Fourth Congressional District of\r\nConnecticut, on each week-day evening, from the fourth day of\r\nMarch until the thirtieth day of the same month, both inclusive.\r\n\r\n\" 'If you will consent to thus meet me in a friendly discussion\r\nof those subjects, now so near and dear to every American heart,\r\nand, I may add, possessing at this time such momentous interest\r\nto all civilized nations in the world who are suffering from\r\nmisrule, I pledge myself to conduct my portion of the debate with\r\nperfect fairness, and with all due respect for my opponent, and\r\ndoubt not you will do the same.\r\n\r\n\" 'Never, in my judgment, in our past history as a nation, have\r\ninterests and questions more important appealed to the people for\r\ntheir wise and careful consideration. It is due to the voters of\r\nthe Fourth Congressional District that they have an early and\r\nfull opportunity to examine their candidates in regard to these\r\nimportant problems, and I shall esteem it a great privilege if\r\nyou will accept this proposition.\r\n\r\n\" 'Please favor me with an early answer, and oblige\r\n                                        \" 'Truly yours,\r\n                                             \" 'P. T. BARNUM.' \"\r\n\r\nTo this letter Mr. William H. Barnum replied, positively\r\ndeclining to accept his rival's proposition.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met P. T. Barnum was surprised to see in the\r\nnewspapers an announcement that the seat of his successful rival\r\nwas to be contested on the ground of bribery and fraud. \" This,\"\r\nhe said, \"was the first intimation that I had ever received of\r\nsuch an intention, and I was never, at any time before or\r\nafterwards, consulted upon the subject. The movement proved to\r\nhave originated with neighbors and townsmen of the successful\r\ncandidate, who claimed to be able to prove that he had paid large\r\nsums of money to purchase votes. They also claimed that they had\r\nproof that men were brought from an adjoining State to vote, and\r\nthat in the office of the successful candidate naturalization\r\npapers were forged to enable foreigners to vote upon them. But, I\r\nrepeat, I took no part nor lot in the matter, but concluded that\r\nif I had been defeated by fraud, mine was the real success.' \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX. FIGHTING A NEWSPAPER\r\n\r\nDISPOSING OF THE LEASE OF THE MUSEUM SITE--THE BARGAIN WITH MR.\r\nBENNETT--BARNUM'S REFUSAL TO BACK OUT--A LONG AND BITTER WAR WITH\r\n\"THE HERALD\"--ACTION OF THE OTHER MANAGERS--THE RETURN OF PEACE.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of his museum by fire, Barnum determined to\r\nopen another and still finer establishment. It would not be on\r\nthe old site, however, but further up town. The unexpired lease\r\nof the two lots at Ann Street and Broadway he proposed to sell;\r\nand he quickly had numerous offers for it. This lease still had\r\nabout eleven years to run, and the annual rental was only\r\n$10,000; and there was a provision that, in case of the burning\r\nof the building, the owner was to spend $24,000 in aiding Barnum\r\nto rebuild, and then, at the expiration of the lease, was to pay\r\nBarnum the appraised value of the building, not exceeding\r\n$100,000. This lease had seemed extravagant when Barnum had made\r\nit, but the great growth of the city had so increased the value\r\nof property in that vicinity, that now the rental of $10,000\r\nseemed ridiculously small. An experienced real estate broker,\r\nwhom Barnum engaged for the purpose, estimated the value of the\r\nlease at $275,000. Barnum was so anxious, however, to get the\r\nmatter settled at once that he decided to offer the lease for\r\nsale at $225,000.\r\n\r\nThe next day he met James Gordon Bennett, the elder, the owner of\r\nthe New York Herald. Mr. Bennett told him that he thought of\r\nbuying both the lease and the fee simple of the property itself,\r\nand erecting there a fine building for his great newspaper.\r\nBarnum therefore, offered him the lease for $200,000, and after a\r\nfew day's consideration Mr. Bennett accepted the offer. His\r\nattorney thereupon handed to Mr. Barnum a check on the Chemical\r\nBank for $200,000, which Barnum immediately used in the purchase\r\nof Government Bonds. Mr. Bennett had agreed to purchase the fee\r\nof the property for $500,000. He had been informed that the\r\nproperty was worth some $300,000 to $400,000, and he did not mind\r\npaying $100,000 extra for the purpose of carrying out his plans.\r\nBut the parties who estimated for him the value of the land knew\r\nnothing of the fact that there was a lease upon the property,\r\nelse of course they would in their estimate have deducted the\r\n$200,000, which the lease would cost. When, therefore, Mr.\r\nBennett saw it stated in the newspapers that the sum which he had\r\npaid for a piece of land measuring only fifty-six by one hundred\r\nfeet was more than was ever paid before in any city in the world\r\nfor a tract of that size, he discovered the serious oversight\r\nwhich he had made; and the owner of the property was immediately\r\ninformed that Bennett would not take it. But Bennett had already\r\nsigned a bond to the owner, agreeing to pay $100,000 cash, and to\r\nmortgage the premises for the remaining $400,000.\r\n\r\nSupposing that by this step he had shaken off the owner of the\r\nfee, Bennett was not long in seeing that, as he was not to own\r\nthe land, he would have no possible use for the lease, for which\r\nhe had paid the $200,000; and accordingly his next step was to\r\nshake Barnum off also, and get back the money he had paid him.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of what followed, Mr. Barnum afterwards said: \"My\r\nbusiness for many years, as manager of the Museum and other\r\npublic entertainments, compelled me to court notoriety; and I\r\nalways found Bennett's abuse far more remunerative than his\r\npraise, even if I could have had the praise at the same price,\r\nthat is for nothing. Especially was it profitable to me when I\r\ncould be the subject of scores of lines of his scolding\r\neditorials free of charge, instead of paying him forty cents a\r\nline for advertisements, which would not attract a tenth part so\r\nmuch attention. Bennett had tried abusing me, off and on, for\r\ntwenty years, on one occasion refusing my advertisement\r\naltogether for the space of about a year; but I always managed to\r\nbe the gainer by his course. Now, however, when new difficulties\r\nthreatened, all the leading managers in New York were members of\r\nthe 'Managers' Association,' and as we all submitted to the\r\narbitrary and extortionate demands of the Herald, Bennett thought\r\nhe had but to crack his whip, in order to keep all and any of us\r\nwithin the traces. Accordingly one day Bennett's attorney wrote\r\nme a letter, saying that he would like to have me call on him at\r\nhis office the following morning. Not dreaming of the object, I\r\ncalled as desired, and after a few pleasant commonplace remarks\r\nabout the weather, and other trifles, the attorney said:\r\n\r\n\" 'Mr. Barnum, I have sent for you to say that Mr. Bennett has\r\nconcluded not to purchase the museum lots, and therefore that you\r\nhad better take back the lease, and return the $200,000 paid for\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\" 'Are you in earnest?' I asked with surprise.\r\n\r\n\" 'Certainly, quite so,' he answered.\r\n\r\n\" 'Really,' I said, smiling, 'I am sorry I can't accommodate Mr.\r\nBennett; I have not got the little sum about me; in fact, I have\r\nspent the money.'\r\n\r\n\" 'It will be better for you to take back the lease,' said the\r\nattorney, seriously.\r\n\r\n\" 'Nonsense,' I replied, 'I shall do nothing of the sort; I don't\r\nmake child's bargains. The lease was cheap enough, but I have\r\nother business to attend to, and shall have nothing to do with\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"The attorney said very little in reply; but I could see, by the\r\nalmost benignant sorrow expressed upon his countenance, that he\r\nevidently pitied me for the temerity that would doubtless lead me\r\ninto the jaws of the insatiable monster of the Herald. The next\r\nmorning I observed that the advertisement of my entertainments\r\nwith my museum company at Winter Garden was left out of the\r\nHerald columns. I went directly to the editorial rooms of the\r\nHerald; and learning that Bennett was not in, I said to Mr.\r\nHudson, then managing editor:\r\n\r\n\" 'My advertisement is left out of the Herald; is there a screw\r\nloose?'\r\n\r\n\" 'I believe there is,' was the reply.\r\n\r\n\" 'What is the matter?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\" 'You must ask the Emperor,' said Mr. Hudson, meaning of course\r\nBennett.\r\n\r\n\" 'When will the \"Emperor\" be in?' I inquired. 'Next Monday,' was\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\n\" 'Well, I shall not see him,' I replied; 'but I wish to have\r\nthis thing settled at once. Mr. Hudson, I now tender you the\r\nmoney for the insertion of my museum advertisement on the same\r\nterms as are paid by other places of amusement; will you publish\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n\" 'I will not,' Mr. Hudson peremptorily replied.\r\n\r\n\" 'That is all,' I said. Mr. Hudson then smilingly and blandly\r\nremarked, 'I have formally answered your formal demand, because I\r\nsuppose you require it; but you know, Mr. Barnum, I can only obey\r\norders.' I assured him that I understood the matter perfectly,\r\nand attached no blame to him in the premises. I then proceeded to\r\nnotify the secretary of the 'Managers' Association' to call the\r\nmanagers together at twelve o'clock the following day; and there\r\nwas a full meeting at the appointed time. I stated the facts in\r\nthe case in the Herald affair, and simply remarked, that if we\r\ndid not make common cause against any newspaper publisher who\r\nexcluded an advertisement from his columns simply to gratify a\r\nprivate pique, it was evident that either and all of us were\r\nliable to imposition at any time.\r\n\r\n\"One of the managers immediately made a motion that the entire\r\nAssociation should stop their advertising and bill printing at\r\nthe Herald office, and have no further connection with that\r\nestablishment. Mr. Lester Wallack advised that this motion should\r\nnot be adopted until a committee had waited upon Bennett, and had\r\nreported the result of the interview to the Association.\r\nAccordingly, Messrs. Wallack, Wheatley and Stuart were delegated\r\nto go, down to the Herald office to call on Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"The moment Bennett saw them, he evidently suspected the object\r\nof their mission, for he at once commenced to speak to Mr.\r\nWallack in a patronizing manner; told him how long he had known,\r\nand how much he respected his late father, who was a true English\r\ngentleman of the old school,' with much more in the same strain.\r\nMr. Wallack replied to Bennett that the three managers were\r\nappointed a committee to wait upon him to ascertain if he\r\ninsisted upon excluding from his columns the museum\r\nadvertisements--not on account of any objection to the contents\r\nof the advertisements, or to the museum itself, but simply\r\nbecause he had a private business disagreement with the\r\nproprietor; intimating that such a proceeding, for such a reason,\r\nand no other, might lead to a rupture of business relations with\r\nother managers. In reply, Mr. Bennett had something to say about\r\nthe fox that had suffered tailwise from a trap, and thereupon\r\nadvised all other foxes to cut their tails off; and he pointed\r\nthe fable by setting forth the impolicy of drawing down upon the\r\nAssociation the vengeance of the Herald. The committee, however,\r\ncoolly insisted upon a direct answer to their question.\r\n\r\n\"Bennett then answered: 'I will not publish Barnum's\r\nadvertisement; I do my business as I please, and in my own way.'\r\n\r\n\" 'So do we,' replied one of the managers, and the committee\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n\"The next day the Managers' Association met, heard the report,\r\nand unanimously resolved to withdraw their advertisements from\r\nthe Herald, and their patronage from the Herald job\r\nestablishment, and it was done. Nevertheless, the Herald for\r\nseveral days continued to print gratutitously the advertisements\r\nof Wallack's Theatre and Niblo's Garden, and inordinately puffed\r\nthese establishments, evidently in order to ease the fall, and to\r\nconvey the idea that some of the theatres patronized the Herald,\r\nand perhaps hoping by praising these managers to draw them back\r\nagain, and so to nullify the agreement of the Association in\r\nregard to the Herald. Thereupon, the mangers headed their\r\nadvertisements in all the other New York papers with the line,\r\n'This establishment does not advertise in the New York Herald,'\r\nand for many months this announcement was kept at the top of\r\nevery theatrical advertisement and on the posters and playbills.\r\n\r\n\"The Herald then began to abuse and villify the theatrical and\r\nopera managers, their artists and their performances, which, of\r\ncourse, was well understood by the public, and relished\r\naccordingly. Meanwhile the theatres prospered amazingly. Their\r\nreceipts were never larger, and their houses never more thronged.\r\nThe public took sides in the matter with the managers and against\r\nthe Herald, and thousands of people went to the theatres merely\r\nto show their willingness to support the managers and to spite\r\n'Old Bennett.' The editor was fairly caught in his own trap.\r\nOther journals began to estimate the loss the Herald sustained by\r\nthe action of the managers, and it was generally believed that\r\nthis loss in advertising and job printing was not less than from\r\n$75,000 to $100,000 a year. The Herald's circulation also\r\nsuffered terribly, since hundreds of people, at the hotels and\r\nelsewhere, who were accustomed to buy the paper solely for the\r\nsake of seeing what amusements were announced for the evening,\r\nnow bought other papers. This was the hardest blow of all, and it\r\nfully accounted for the abuse which the Herald daily poured out\r\nupon the theatres.\r\n\r\n\"Bennett evidently felt ashamed of the whole transaction. He\r\nwould never publish the facts in his columns, though he once\r\nstated in an editorial that it had been reported that he had been\r\ncheated in purchasing the Broadway property; that the case had\r\ngone to court, and the public would soon know all the\r\nparticulars. Some persons supposed by this that Bennett had sued\r\nme; but this was far from being the case. The owner of the lots\r\nsued Bennett, to compel him to take the title and pay for the\r\nproperty as per agreement; and that was all the 'law' there was\r\nabout it. He held James Gordon Bennett's bond, that he would pay\r\nhim half a million of dollars for the land, as follows: $100,000\r\ncash, and a bond and mortgage upon the premises for the remaining\r\n$400,000. The day before the suit was to come to trial, Bennett\r\ncame forward, took the deed, and paid $100,000 cash, and gave a\r\nbond and mortgage of the entire premises for $400,000.\r\n\r\n\"Had I really taken back the lease, as Bennett desired, he would\r\nhave been in a worse scrape than ever; for having been compelled\r\nto take the property, he would have been obliged, as my landlord,\r\nto go on and assist in building a Museum for me, according to the\r\nterms of my lease, and a Museum I should certainly have built on\r\nBennett's property, even if I had owned a dozen Museums up town.\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1868, the associated managers came to the\r\nconclusion that the punishment of Bennett for two years was\r\nsufficient, and they consented to restore their advertisements to\r\nthe Herald. I was then carrying on my new Museum, and although I\r\ndid not immediately resume advertising in the Herald, I have\r\nsince done so.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the account Barnum gave, in his own words, of this\r\nextraordinary quarrel. He was, it will be seen, unsparing of\r\ncriticism and denunciation. Kindly as was his nature, he was \"a\r\ngood hater,\" and never was there a more relentless fighter. In\r\ndenouncing Mr. Bennett he was perfectly sincere, and believed\r\nhimself to be entirely in the right. At the same time he never\r\nhesitated to give a full meed of appreciative praise to the great\r\njournalist, for his extraordinary enterprise and commanding\r\ntalents. Both the men are now dead, after careers of marvellous\r\nsuccess, and the animosity that raged between them is also long\r\ndead; it perished years before they did. It is here rehearsed\r\nmerely as an integral and essential part of this biography, to be\r\nregarded in a spirit of philosophic contemplation, entirely\r\ndevoid of bitterness or acrimony,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. BRIDGEPORT.\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SEASIDE PARK--LAYING OUT CITY\r\nSTREETS IMPATIENCE WITH \"OLD FOGIES\"--BUILDING A SEASIDE\r\nHOME--WALDEMERE--A HOME IN NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of Mr. Barnum's life was his loyalty to the\r\nplace he had chosen as his home, and his devotion to its\r\ninterests. He had great faith in Bridgeport, and worked\r\nunceasingly to justify it. He looked far ahead, saw the\r\nprospective growth of the place, and laid broad plans of\r\npreparation for the future.\r\n\r\nApart from his great services in laying out East Bridgeport, he\r\nwas the author of the improvements on the water-front known as\r\nSeaside Park. The idea of such a thing occurred to him first in\r\n1863, when he rode over the ground and observed its fitness for\r\nthe purpose. He then began agitating the matter, and urging the\r\nimmediate acquirement by the city of land for a park and public\r\ndrive-way along the margin of the Sound. It was necessary, he\r\nrepresented, to do it at once, before the natural increase in the\r\nvalue of the land made such an undertaking too expensive. That it\r\nwould be a profitable venture he felt certain; for such an\r\nimprovement would make every bit of real estate in the city more\r\nvaluable, and would attract many new residents to the place.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, many conservatives, \"old fogies\" he called\r\nthem, who opposed him. He then approached the farmers who owned\r\nthe land lying immediately upon the shore, and tried to convince\r\nthem that, if they would give the city, free, a deep slip next to\r\nthe water, to be used as a public park, it would increase in\r\nvalue the rest of their land so much as to make it a profitable\r\noperation for them. But it was like beating against the wind.\r\nThey were \"not so stupid as to think that they could become\r\ngainers by giving away their property.\"\r\n\r\nHe succeeded, however, in getting the active aid and co-operation\r\nof Messrs. Nathaniel Wheeler, James Loomis, Francis Ives,\r\nFrederick Wood, and some others, who went with him to the\r\nlandowners and added their persuasions to his. After much urging,\r\nthey finally got the terms upon which the proprietors would give\r\na portion and sell another portion of their land, which fronted\r\non the water, provided the land thus disposed of should forever\r\nbe appropriated to the purposes of a public park. But,\r\nunfortunately, a part of the land it was desirable to include was\r\na farm, of some thirty acres, then belonging to an unsettled\r\nestate, and neither the administrator nor the heirs could or\r\nwould give away a rod of it. But the whole farm was for\r\nsale--and, to overcome the difficulty in the way of its transfer\r\nfor the public benefit, Barnum bought it for about $12,000, and\r\nthen presented the required front to the park. He did not want\r\nthis land or any portion of it, for his own purposes or profit,\r\nand he offered a thousand dollars to any one who would take his\r\nplace in the transaction; but no one accepted, and he was quite\r\nwilling to contribute so much of the land as was needed for so\r\nnoble an object. Besides this, he gave $1,400 toward purchasing\r\nother land and improving the park, and, after months of\r\npersistent personal effort, he succeeded in raising, by private\r\nsubscription, the sum necessary to secure the land needed. This\r\nwas duly paid for, deeded to, and accepted by the city, and\r\nBarnum had the pleasure of naming this new and great public\r\nimprovement, \"Seaside Park.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Barnum first selected Bridgeport as his home, as already\r\nstated in a preceding chapter, the place was commended to him by\r\nits nearness to New York, its convenience of access, and the\r\nbeauty of its situation. \"Nowhere,\" said he, \"in all my travels\r\nin America and abroad had I seen a city whose very position\r\npresented so many and varied attractions. Situated on Long Island\r\nSound, with that vast water-view in front, and on every other\r\nside a beautiful and fertile country with every variety of inland\r\nscenery, and charming drives which led through valleys rich with\r\nwell-cultivated farms, and over hills thick-wooded with\r\nfar-stretching forests of primeval growth--all these natural\r\nattractions appeared to me only so many aids to the advancement\r\nthe beautiful and busy city might attain, if public spirit,\r\nenterprise, and money grasped and improved the opportunities the\r\nlocality itself extended. I saw that what Nature had so freely\r\nlavished must be supplemented by yet more liberal Art.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in pursuance of this object that he built the famous\r\nIranistan; and when he did so he felt confident that this superb\r\nplace would so increase the value of surrounding property that\r\nnone but first-class residences would be erected in the vicinity.\r\nHe, however, went on to improve the surrounding property as much\r\nas possible. He opened numerous fine avenues through land\r\npurchased by himself, and freely gave them to the city. In this\r\nway he opened miles of new streets and planted them with\r\nthousands of shade trees. The planting of trees was almost a\r\nmania with him, in pursuit of the doctrine laid down in Scott's\r\n\"Heart of Mid-Lothian\": \"When ye hae naething else to do, ye may\r\nbe aye sticking in a tree; it will be growing when ye're\r\nsleeping.\"\r\n\r\nBarnum was always for enterprise and progress. \"Conservatism,\" he\r\nsaid, \"may be a good thing in the State, or in the Church, but it\r\nis fatal to the growth of cities, and the conservative notions of\r\nold fogies make them indifferent to the requirements which a very\r\nfew years in the future will compel, and blind to their own best\r\ninterests. Such men never look beyond the length of their noses,\r\nand consider every investment a dead loss unless they can get the\r\nsixpence profit into their pockets before they go to bed. My own\r\nlong training and experience as a manager impelled me to carry\r\ninto such private enterprises as the purchase of real estate that\r\nbest and most essential managerial quality of instantly deciding,\r\nnot only whether a venture was worth undertaking, but what, all\r\nthings considered, that venture would result in. Almost any man\r\ncan see how a thing will begin, but not every man is gifted with\r\nthe foresight to see how it will end, or how, with the proper\r\neffort, it may be made to end. In East Bridgeport where we had no\r\n'conservatives' to contend with, we were only a few years in\r\nturning almost tenantless farms into a populous and prosperous\r\ncity. On the other side of the river, while the opening of new\r\navenues, the planting of shade trees, and the building of many\r\nhouses, have afforded me the highest pleasures of my life, I\r\nconfess that not a few of my greatest annoyance's have been\r\noccasioned by the opposition of those who seem to be content to\r\nsimply vegetate through their existence, and who looked upon me\r\nas a restless, reckless innovator, because I was trying to remove\r\nthe moss from everything around them, and even from their own\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Barnum's health continued to decline, and in the summer of\r\n1867 her doctor commended her to live on the seashore.\r\nAccordingly her husband sold Lindencroft, and they removed for\r\nthe summer to a small farm-house adjoining Seaside Park. So\r\ndelighted were they with life by the water during the hot days of\r\nthe summer that they determined thereafter to spend every summer\r\non the very shore of Long Island Sound. Finding it impossible to\r\nprepare a house of their own in time for the next season, they\r\nspent the summer of 1868 in a new and handsome house which Mr.\r\nBarnum owned but which he had built for sale. In the fall of\r\n1868, however, he purchased a large and beautiful grove of\r\nhickory trees adjoining Seaside Park, and decided to build a\r\npermanent residence there.\r\n\r\nBut there was a vast deal to do in grading and preparing the\r\nground, in opening new streets and avenues as approaches to the\r\nproperty, and in setting out trees near the proposed site of the\r\nhouse; so that ground was not broken for the foundation till\r\nOctober. He planned a house which should combine the greatest\r\nconvenience with the highest comfort, keeping in mind always that\r\nhouses were made to live in as well as to look at, and to be\r\n\"homes\" rather than mere residences. So the house was made to\r\ninclude abundant room for guests, with dressing-rooms and baths\r\nto every chamber; water from the city throughout the premises;\r\ngas manufactured on the ground; and that greatest of all\r\ncomforts, a semi-detached kitchen, so that the smell as well as\r\nthe secrets of the cuisine might be confined to its own locality.\r\nThe stables and gardens were located far from the mansion, on the\r\nopposite side of one of the newly-opened avenues, so that in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the house, on either side and before both\r\nfronts, stretched large lawns, broken only by the grove, single\r\nshade-trees, rock-work, walks, flower-beds, and drives. The whole\r\nscheme as planned was faithfully carried out in less than eight\r\nmonths The first foundation stone was laid in October, 1868; and\r\nthey moved into the completed house in June following, in 1869.\r\n\r\nOn taking possession of this new residence, Barnum formally named\r\nit \"Waldemere.\" Literally this name was \"Wald-am-Meer,\" or\r\n\"Woods-by-the Sea,\" but Barnum preferred the more euphonious\r\nform. On the same estate he built at the same time two beautiful\r\ncottages, called \"Petrel's Nest,\" and \"Wavewood,\" the homes of\r\nhis two daughters, Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Seeley--the latter his\r\nyoungest. Here Barnum decided to speed five months of every year,\r\nand for his home during the other seven months he purchased a\r\nsplendid mansion on Murray Hill, in New York City, at the corner\r\nof Fifth Avenue and 38th Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. HONORS AND ADULATIONS.\r\n\r\nSECOND MARRIAGE--THE KING OF HAWAII--ELECTED MAYOR OF\r\nBRIDGEPORT--SUCCESSFUL TOUR OF THE HIPPODROME--BARNUM'S\r\nRETIREMENT FROM OFFICE.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1874 Mr. Barnum married the daughter of his old\r\nEnglish friend, John Fish. The wedding took place in the Church\r\nof the Divine Paternity, Fifth Avenue, New York, and after a\r\nbrief bridal tour, they returned to Waldemere.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1874, David Kalakau, King of the Sandwich Islands,\r\nvisited New York, and with his suite was invited to attend the\r\nHippodrome.\r\n\r\nDuring the performance Barnum sat beside the King, who kept up a\r\npleasant conversation with him for two hours. The King expressed\r\nhimself as highly delighted with the entertainment, and said he\r\nwas always fond of horses and racing.\r\n\r\nSome twelve thousand spectators were present, and before the\r\nexhibition was finished they began to call loudly \"The King! The\r\nKing!\"\r\n\r\nTurning to his host, Kalakau inquired the meaning of their\r\nexcitement. \"Your Majesty,\" replied Barnum, \"this vast audience\r\nwishes to give you an ovation. The building is so large that they\r\ncannot distinguish your Majesty from every part of the house, and\r\nare anxious that you should ride around the circle in order that\r\nthey may greet you.\"\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Barnum's open barouche was driven into the circle\r\nand approached the royal box.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt your Majesty would greatly gratify my countrymen, if\r\nyou would kindly step into this carriage and ride around the\r\ncircle.\"\r\n\r\nThe King immediately arose, and amidst tremendous cheering,\r\nstepped into the carriage. Barnum took a seat by his side, and\r\nthe King smilingly remarked, \"We are all actors.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience rose to their feet, cheered and waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs, as the King rode around the circle, raising his\r\nhat and bowing. The excitement was simply tremendous.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1875, the nomination for Mayor of Bridgeport was\r\noffered Barnum, but he refused it, until assured that the\r\nnomination was intended as a compliment, and that both parties\r\nwould sustain it. Politically the city is largely Democratic, but\r\nBarnum led the Republican ticket, and was easily elected.\r\n\r\nHis Inaugural address before the new Common Council, April 12, is\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE COMMON COUNCIL:--Intrusted as we are, by the\r\nvotes of our fellow-citizens, with the care and management of\r\ntheir interests, it behooves us to endeavor to merit the\r\nconfidence reposed in us. We are sometimes called the \"fathers of\r\nthe city.\" Certainly our duty is, and our pleasure should be, to\r\nadminister the municipal government as a good and wise father\r\nconducts his household, caring for all, partial to none. No\r\npersonal feelings should dictate our official acts. We are not\r\nplaced here to gratify personal or party resentment, nor to\r\nextend personal or party favor in any manner that may in the\r\nremotest degree conflict with the best interests of our city. As\r\ncitizens we enjoy a great common interest. Each individual is a\r\nmember of the body corporate, and no member can be unduly favored\r\nor unjustly oppressed without injury to the entire community. No\r\nperson or party can afford to be dishonest. Honesty is always the\r\nbest policy, for \"with what measure ye mete it shall be measured\r\nto you again.\"\r\n\r\nA large portion of this honorable body are now serving officially\r\nfor the first time, and therefore may not be fully acquainted\r\nwith the details of its workings; but we are all acquainted with\r\nthe great principles of Justice and Right. If we fail to work\r\naccording to these eternal principles, we betray the confidence\r\nplaced in us, and this our year of administration will be\r\nremembered with disapprobation and contempt.\r\n\r\nLet us bring to our duties careful judgment and comprehensive\r\nviews with regard to expenditure, so that we may be neither\r\nparsimonious nor extravagant, but, like a prudent householder,\r\never careful that expenses shall be less than the income.\r\n\r\nOur city is peculiarly adapted for commercial purposes, it should\r\nbe our care, therefore, to adopt such measures as tend to promote\r\ntrade, manufactures and commerce. Its delightful and healthy\r\nlocality makes it also a desirable place of residence. We should\r\nstrive to enhance its natural beauty, to improve our streets and,\r\nwith moderate expenditure, to embellish our parks, by which means\r\nwe shall attract refined and wealthy residents.\r\n\r\nAs conservators of the public peace and morals it is our duty to\r\nprevent, so far as possible, acts which disturb one or the other,\r\nand to enforce the laws in an impartial and parental spirit.\r\n\r\nThe last report of our Chief of Police says: \" 'Tis a sad and\r\npainful duty, yet candor compels us to state that at least ninety\r\nper cent. of the causes of all the arrests during the year are\r\ndirectly traceable to the immoderate use of intoxicating liquors,\r\nnot to speak of the poverty and misery it has caused families\r\nwhich almost daily come under our observation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the town of Vineland, N. J., where no intoxicating drinks are\r\nsold, the overseer of the poor stated in his annual report that\r\nin a population of 10,000 there was but one indictment in six\r\nmonths, and that the entire police expenses were but seventy-five\r\ndollars per year--the sum paid to him--and the poor expenses a\r\nmere trifle. He further says: \"We practically have no debt, and\r\nour taxes are only one per cent. on the valuation. \"Similar\r\nresults are reported in the town of Greeley, Colorado, where no\r\nliquors are sold.\r\n\r\nOur laws license the sale of intoxicating drinks under certain\r\nrestrictions on week days, but no man can claim the right under\r\nsuch license to cause mobs, riots, bloodshed or murder. Hence no\r\nman has, or can have, any right by license or otherwise to\r\ndispense liquors to intoxicated persons, nor to furnish\r\nsufficient liquor to cause intoxication. Our duty is therefore to\r\nsee that the police aid in regulating to the extent of their\r\nlegal power a traffic which our laws do not wholly prohibit.\r\nSpirituous liquors of the present day are so much adulterated and\r\ndoubly poisoned that their use fires the brain and drives their\r\nvictims to madness, violence and murder. The money annually\r\nexpended for intoxicating drinks, and the cost of their evil\r\nresults in Bridgeport, or any other American city where liquor\r\nselling is licensed, would pay the entire expenses of the city\r\n(if liquors were not drank), including the public schools, give a\r\ngood suit of clothes to every poor person of both sexes, a barrel\r\nof flour to every poor family living within its municipal\r\nboundaries, and leave a handsome surplus on hand. Our enormous\r\nexpenses for the trial and punishment of criminals, as well as\r\nfor the support of the poor, are mainly caused by this traffic.\r\nSurely, then, it is our duty to do all we can, legally, to limit\r\nand mitigate its evil. As no person ever became a drunkard who\r\ndid not sincerely regret that he or she ever tasted intoxicating\r\ndrinks, it is a work of mercy, as well as justice, to do all in\r\nour power to lessen this leprous hindrance to happiness. We\r\nshould strive to exterminate gambling, prostitution and other\r\ncrimes which have not yet attained to the dignity of a \"license.\"\r\n\r\nThe public health demands that we should pay attention to\r\nnecessary drainage, and prevent the sale of adulterated food. The\r\ninvigorating breezes from Long Island Sound, and the absence of\r\nmiasmatic marshes serve to make ours one of the most healthy\r\ncities in America. Scientific experiments made daily during the\r\nwhole of last year have established the fact that our atmosphere\r\nis impregnated with OZONE, or concentrated oxygen, to an extent\r\nnot hitherto discovered on this continent. No city of the same\r\nsize in America is so extensively known throughout our own land\r\nand in Europe as Bridgeport. It should be our pleasure to\r\nstrengthen all natural advantages which we possess as a city by\r\nmaintaining a government of corresponding excellence.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to the industrious and moral portions of our people\r\nto see so many loungers about the streets, and such a multitude\r\nwhose highest aspirations seem to be to waste their time in\r\nidleness, or at base ball, billiards, etc.\r\n\r\nNo person needs to be unemployed who is not over fastidious about\r\nthe kind of occupation. There are too many soft hands (and heads)\r\nwaiting for light work and heavy pay. Better work for half a loaf\r\nthan beg or steal a whole one. Mother earth is always near by,\r\nand ready to respond to reasonable drafts on her never-failing\r\ntreasury. A patch of potatoes raised \"on shares\" is preferable to\r\na poulticed pate earned in a whisky scrimmage. Some modern\r\nMicawbers stand with folded hands waiting for the panic to pass,\r\nas the foolish man waited for the river to run dry and allow him\r\nto walk over.\r\n\r\nThe soil is the foundation of American prosperity. When\r\nmultitudes of our consumers become producers; when fashion\r\nteaches economy, instead of expending for a gaudy dress what\r\nwould comfortably clothe the family; when people learn to walk\r\nuntil they can afford to ride; when the poor man ceases to spend\r\nmore for tobacco than for bread; when those who complain of\r\npanics learn that \"we cannot eat our cake and keep it,\" that a\r\nsieve will not hold water, that we must rely on our own exertions\r\nand earn before we expend, then will panics cease and prosperity\r\nreturn. While we should by no means unreasonably restrict healthy\r\nrecreation, we should remember that \"time is money,\" that\r\nidleness leads to immoral habits, and that the peace, prosperity\r\nand character of a city depend on the intelligence, integrity,\r\nindustry and frugality of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFrank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper of July 24th, contained a\r\npicture entitled \"His Honor, P. T. Barnum, Mayor of Bridgeport,\r\nPresiding at a Meeting of the Common Council of that City.\" The\r\neditor's remarks are as follows:--\"Mayor Barnum's message was a\r\nmodel of brevity and practical thought. Having at the beginning\r\nof his official career declared war against the whisky dealers,\r\nhe next proceeded to open the struggle. For twenty years the\r\nsaloons had been kept open on Sundays, and it was declared\r\nimpossible to close them. Mr. Barnum has all his life acted upon\r\nthe quaint French aphorism that 'nothing is so possible as the\r\nimpossible.' He gave notice that the saloons must be closed. A\r\nselect committee of citizens volunteered to aid in collecting\r\ntestimony in case the sellers should disregard the proclamation,\r\nand leave the latch-string to their back doors displayed on the\r\noutside. Although the doors were open, the keepers refused to\r\nsell except to personal friends. The committee-men stood opposite\r\nthe saloons, and took the names of a dozen or so who were\r\nadmitted. The next morning the saloon-keepers were arrested, and\r\nwhen they found their 'friends' had been subpoenaed to appear as\r\nwitnesses, they pleaded guilty and immediately brought out their\r\npocket-books to pay the judicial 'shot.' This plan effectually\r\nbroke up Sunday traffic in liquor, thus insuring a quiet day for\r\nthe citizens, and greatly accommodating the saloon-keepers, the\r\nbest portion of whom really favor a general closing on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"By nature an organizer of men and systems, he is his own best\r\nexecutive officer. No one knows so well as he how men may be best\r\ngoverned, and no one can so pleasantly polish off the rough sides\r\nof mankind. Successful beyond the usual measure as an\r\nintelligent, courteous and considerate showman, he has already\r\nproved himself the most acceptable of Mayors.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1875, the Hippodrome was transported by rail throughout the\r\nUnited States, going as far east as Portland, Maine, and west to\r\nKansas City, Missouri. Notwithstanding the depressed state of\r\nfinances generally that year, the season was a fairly profitable\r\none.\r\n\r\nA very painful event in connection with the show, occurred in\r\nJuly. The aeronaut, Donaldson, made his customary daily ascension\r\nfrom the Hippodrome grounds at Chicago, and was never heard from\r\nafterward. He took with him Mr. N. S. Grimwood, a reporter of the\r\nChicago Journal, whose body was found a few weeks later in Lake\r\nMichigan. There was a terrible storm the night of the ascension\r\nand it was doubtless then that the men perished.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June Barnum visited Niagara Falls with Mrs.\r\nBarnum and a party of English friends. Leaving the party at\r\nNiagara, Mr. and Mrs. Barnum went to Akron, Ohio, where the\r\n\"Travelling World's Fair\" was to exhibit. The Mayor of Akron\r\ncalled upon them and invited them to a concert, where, in\r\nresponse to loud calls, Barnum gave a short speech; they were\r\nafterward tendered a reception and a serenade at the hotel. The\r\nnext day they were escorted to Buchtel College by the founder of\r\nthe institution, Mr. J. R. Buchtel, and the Reverend D. C.\r\nTomlinson. The students received Barnum enthusiastically, and he\r\ngave them one of his delightful speeches.\r\n\r\nReturning to Buffalo, they rejoined their friends, and also met\r\nthe Hippodrome. Early in the morning of the second day of the\r\nexhibition Barnum despatched a special train to Niagara Falls,\r\nwith some hundreds of the Hippodrome Company, to whom he wished\r\nto give the pleasure of viewing the cataract. The band which\r\naccompanied them crossed Suspension Bridge playing \"God Save the\r\nQueen,\" and \"Yankee Doodle,\" and returned to Buffalo in time for\r\nthe afternoon performance. In July, Barnum visited the Hippodrome\r\nat St Louis and Chicago, and then returned to Waldemere for the\r\nrest of the summer.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1875, under the auspices of the Redpath\r\nLyceum Bureau, in Boston, Mr. Barnum found time to deliver some\r\nthirty times, a lecture on \"The World and How to Live in It,\"\r\ngoing as far east as Thomaston, Maine, and west to Leavenworth,\r\nKansas. When the tour was finished the Bureau wrote him that \"In\r\nparting for the season please allow us to say that none of our\r\nbest lecturers have succeeded in delighting our audiences and\r\nlecture committees so well as yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Jubilee year was celebrated by the Hippodrome\r\nCompany in a very patriotic manner. It was said, that they gave\r\nthe people, a Fourth of July celebration every day. The\r\nestablishment traveled in three trains of railroad cars; they\r\ntook along a battery of cannon, and every morning fired a salute\r\nof thirteen guns. Groups of persons costumed in the style of\r\nContinental troops, and supplemented with the Goddess of Liberty,\r\na live eagle and some good singers, sang patriotic songs,\r\naccompanied with bands of music, and also with cannon placed\r\noutside the tents and fired by means of electricity. The\r\nperformance was closed by singing \"America,\" the entire audience\r\nrising and joining in the chorus. At night there were fireworks\r\nin which Revolutionary scenes were brilliantly depicted. The\r\nstreet parade was a gorgeous feature. It began to move when the\r\nsalute was fired, and the town bells were always rung to aid the\r\neffect of the National Jubilee.\r\n\r\nBarnum's official term as Mayor of Bridgeport, expired April 3,\r\n1876. Preferring to travel part of the time with his Centennial\r\nshow, he refused a renomination. The last meeting of the Common\r\nCouncil under his administration, met March 29.\r\n\r\nThe New York Daily Graphic, of March 30, read:--\"Mr. P. T.\r\nBarnum, Mayor of Bridgeport, has uttered his valedictory message.\r\nThe document is very much like the man. He disapproves of the\r\nreports of the Chief of Police and Clerk of the Police\r\nCommissioners, because they declare that liquor saloons and\r\nbrothels cannot be closed, and he even reproves the latter for\r\nhis 'flippant manner' of dealing with the subject. Barnum must\r\nhave his joke or two, withal, and he can no more subsist without\r\nhis fun than could a former Mayor of this city. He ventures to\r\nallude in this solemn document to the management of the New York\r\nand New Haven Railroad Company, as 'the good bishop and his\r\ndirectors;' makes a first rate pun on the names of two citizens;\r\nand says to the Aldermen, 'And now we have, like the Arabs, only\r\nto 'fold our tents and silently steal away,' congratulating\r\nourselves that this is the only stealing which has been performed\r\nby this honorable body.' Mr. Barnum's administration in\r\nBridgeport has been mild, but characterized by firmness and\r\nindependence. His trouble with the Jews was of short duration,\r\nfor he is most respectful toward all theologies. He has not been\r\nable to carry out his extreme temperance views; but he has made a\r\nvery good Mayor of a city, for whose prosperity he has labored\r\nfor half a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nIt can safely be said that Barnum amused and instructed more\r\npersons than any men who ever lived. In the course of his career\r\nas manager of public entertainments, the number of his patrons\r\nwas enormous. Here is his own estimate, in 1889:--\"During the\r\nforty years that I have been a manager of public amusements, the\r\nnumber of my patrons has been almost incredible. From a careful\r\nexamination of my account books for the different exhibitions\r\nwhich I have owned and controlled, I find that more than\r\neighty-two millions of tickets, in the aggregate, were disposed\r\nof, and numerous exhibitions which I have had at various times\r\nare not included in this statement.\"\r\n\r\nThe traveling exhibitions which I managed during\r\nthe six years preceding my purchase of the New York\r\nAmerican  Museum, in 1841, were attended by . . . . .  1,500,000\r\npersons.\r\nThe American Museum which I managed from 1841\r\nto 1865, when it was destroyed by fire, sold . . . .  37,560,000\r\ntickets.\r\nMy Broadway Museum, in 1865-6-7 and 8, sold . . . . .  3,640,000\r\nMy Philadelphia Museum, 1849, 1850 and 1851, sold . .  1,800,000\r\nMy Baltimore Museum, sold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  900,000\r\nMy traveling Asiatic Caravan, Museum and Menagerie,\r\nin 1851-2-3 and 4, sold   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .5,824,000\r\nMy great traveling World's Fair and Hippodrome, in\r\n1871-2-3-4-5 and 6, sold . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   7,920,000\r\n                                                    ------------\r\n                                   Carried forward,  59,144,000\r\n\r\nMy other traveling exhibitions in America and Europe,\r\nsold  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    2,200,000\r\ntickets.\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb has exhibited for me 34 years,\r\nand sold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    20,400,000\r\n\"\r\nJenny Lind's Concerts, under my management, were\r\nattended by . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    600,000\r\npersons\r\nCatharine Hayes's 60 Concerts in California, under my\r\ncontract, sold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     120,000\r\ntickets.\r\n             ----------------\r\nThus, my patrons amount to the enormous number of     82,464,000\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, he delivered over seven hundred public\r\nlectures which were attended in the aggregate by 1,300,000\r\npersons, and wrote three books of reminiscences. Is it to be\r\nwondered at, that such a well-known character should receive a\r\nletter from New Zealand addressed simply, \"Mr. Barnum, America\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME REMINISCENCES OF P. T. BARNUM\r\n\r\n My first recollection of Mr. Barnum goes back to the period of\r\nmy small-boyhood, when he came to the country village near my\r\nhome to lecture upon temperance. I still remember the animation\r\nof his discourse on that occasion; its humor and its anecdote;\r\nand, with what absorbing interest the large audience sat out the\r\nhour and a half or more which the speaker so well filled. In\r\ndescribing the drunkard and the illusions which master him, he\r\nshowed a keen perception of human nature; and, in every part of\r\nhis address there was no end of spirited appeal and analysis,\r\nmingled with unbounded mirth and pathos, as the fluctuating\r\nargument went on.\r\n\r\nA few years later, when I had grown old enough to visit the\r\nmetropolis, I made it one of the chief items of my concern to\r\nvisit the old museum on the corner of Ann Street and Broadway,\r\nwhere the Herald Building now stands. There was, even then, no\r\ncuriosity there more impressive than its proprietor, who was the\r\nvery embodiment of life, kindly feeling, and wholesome joy. I\r\nnoticed that he was in all parts of the museum in very rapid\r\nsuccession, and that nothing escaped his attention. Something in\r\nhis manner caught every eye. It was said of Daniel Webster that\r\nwhen he walked through the streets of London, strangers who met\r\nhim turned around for another look after he passed by. And, I\r\nconfess I yielded in Mr. Barnum's presence, as others did, to\r\nthis same sight-seeing inclination. It was not merely that he was\r\nso well known, and that his name had gone about the world with\r\nthe circuit of the sun; it was because the force that made this\r\nthing possible worked also in other ways, and compelled you to\r\ngive its owner attention.\r\n\r\nHe had a kind word or an entertaining one for everybody who came\r\nnear him, as occasion offered, whether he was an old acquaintance\r\nor a stranger. The occasion did not come to me, though I remember\r\nwishing it had, when I left the museum. Probably I should have\r\ndeliberately sought it if I had had more assurance and experience\r\nat that time; and if I had known, too, that we were afterward to\r\nmeet intimately, and that for more than twenty years the\r\nlatch-string of his different homes, in Bridgeport and New York,\r\nwas to respond so many dozens of times to my touch, for days and\r\nweeks of remarkable hospitality.\r\n\r\nMy opportunity for knowing Mr. Barnum personally came about when\r\nI was, as a young man, conducting, almost single-handed, a\r\nlecture course in a very small country town in the later sixties,\r\nsoon after the close of the war. The night for Mr. Barnum to come\r\nto us was a very cold and forbidding one in February. A\r\nsnow-storm, the most formidable one of the winter, sprang up to\r\napparently thwart the success of the performance; and so certain\r\nwas Mr. Barnum that nobody would appear to hear him, he offered\r\nnot only to release me from the contract between us, but, in\r\naddition to that, would pay me the price I was to pay him, or\r\nmore, to be permitted to return to New York. \"There is nothing on\r\nearth I hate to do so much,\" said he, \"as to lecture to empty\r\nbenches.\"\r\n\r\nI said to him: \"Please trust me for the avoidance of that. If it\r\nhad been a pleasant night, instead of this howling storm, I would\r\nhave filled the hall and the yard in front to the front gate.\r\nBut, as it now is, I will still guarantee to fill the hall.\" And\r\nfilled it was, to our equal delight.\r\n\r\nBefore entering and discovering this fact, I ventured to say to\r\nMr. Barnum that, owing to the general untowardness and inclemency\r\nof the night, I would introduce him in my own way, and not in the\r\nconventional one, if he did not object. \"By all means,\" said he;\r\n\"if you can awaken any warmth or hilarity on as sorrowful an\r\noutlook as this, do not spare ME, or hesitate for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at our seats on the platform, I arose and said, in\r\nsome such words as these:\r\n\r\n\"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--You will bear me out in saying it has\r\nbeen my usual custom to introduce the speaker of the evening in\r\nthe briefest way possible, and not to trouble you with any talk\r\nof my own. To-night, in view of the storm, and while Mr. Barnum\r\nis resting for a moment, I will break my rule and tell you a\r\nstory. Some years ago a queer fellow from the country went to New\r\nYork, and, among the sights and experiences he had planned for,\r\nhe went to Barnum's Museum. Mr. Greenwood was then its manager,\r\nand noticed with some interest his patron's rusticity when he\r\ncalled for a ticket. He asked Mr. Greenwood, after having paid\r\nfor the card of admittance, 'Where is Barnum?' As Mr. Barnum\r\nhappened to be in sight on the entrance floor, Mr. Greenwood,\r\npointing to him said, There he is.'\r\n\r\n\"At once the querist started in the direction named. He got very\r\nnear Mr. Barnum and stood looking intently at him. Then he moved\r\na little segment in the circle he was describing, and looked\r\nagain. Several times he repeated these inspections, until he had\r\nfrom all points viewed the object of his curiosity and had\r\ncompleted the circle, when he started for the door, Mr. Greenwood\r\nwatching him all the time. When he came near enough Mr. Greenwood\r\nsaid to him: 'My friend, you have not seen the Museum yet. There\r\nis a whale downstairs and any number of things up-stairs, a moral\r\nplay soon to come off, etc.' 'I know it,' said the rustic, 'and I\r\ndon't care. I've seen Barnum, and I've got my money's worth.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have not been able to bring to you\r\nthe American Museum to-night, but I have done what is better--I\r\nhave brought to you Mr. Barnum.\"\r\n\r\n Mr. Barnum then arose, not in the least nonplussed, but greatly\r\npleased with the packed house and the hearty cheers which greeted\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n \"MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--I cannot, for the life of\r\nme, see why you should have sent so far as New York for me to\r\ncome and address you. I am not really a lyceum lecturer at all. I\r\nam only a showman, and it seems you have a man here who can show\r\nup the showman.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole story may read very weakly in print; for Mr. Barnum's\r\ntones of voice, and gestures and mobility of feature are not\r\ncommunicable to cold type. But the playfulness of this unusual\r\npreface not only stirred the audience on a dismal night, but put\r\nthe lecturer at his very best. Mr. Barnum's lecture was elastic.\r\nIt might be shaped for an hour, as it was not fully written, or\r\nit might consume more time. On this occasion it was two hours and\r\nover. While the snow was still falling in open sleighs, that\r\ncould find no shelter, their owners, not minding this, were\r\nenjoying one of the most delightful evenings of a whole\r\nwinter--of many winters, perhaps.\r\n\r\nAnd all this leads me to say that Mr. Barnum, while claiming no\r\npart of a professional lecturer's endowment, and only made\r\noratory a casual--if it was sometimes a frequent--matter, was,\r\nnevertheless, admirably equipped to entertain an audience. He\r\ncould tell a story inimitably. His mimetic faculty, like Gough's,\r\ngave him something of the quality of an actor, so that he\r\nillustrated well what he had to say. No lectures have proved much\r\nmore instructive and entertaining than Mr. Barnum's on The Art of\r\nMoney Getting; and, wherever he went to address an audience, he\r\nwas sure to be called again.\r\n\r\nWhen I met him in Bridgeport for the first time, I found he was\r\neasily the chief man of the place. He was living then at\r\nLindencroft, on Fairfield Avenue. His Oriental palace, Iranistan,\r\nhad burned down some years before. But, wherever he lived, his\r\nhouse gave open welcome to many guests, illustrious and other;\r\nand no one who had the good fortune to enter it, ever went away\r\nwithout connecting with his visit the happiest of memories. At\r\nthe table he especially shone. Wit, repartee, and even puns, when\r\noccasion offered, coruscated over the meal, and diffused\r\nuniversal good humor. He had always at hand innumerable\r\nanecdotes, which he made peculiarly his own, and which he told\r\nwith inimitable grace and unction. I am sure nobody will ever\r\ntell them again as he told them; for, contrary to the proverb,\r\nthe prosperity of the jest in his case lay, nine-tenths, in his\r\nway of relating it--though it was never a dull one.\r\n\r\nIt mattered not what the business of the day might be, or what\r\nobstacles or discouragements had been encountered, his\r\ncheerfulness was perennial and unfailing. Mirth and good cheer\r\nwere apparently inborn and organic with him. He could no more\r\nsuppress them than a fountain could cease bubbling up, or a river\r\nturn backward in its course. And what men and women he has had,\r\nfirst and last, at his table; it is impossible to exhaust the\r\nlist or exaggerate its quality. Horace Greeley, Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, E. H. Chapin, Bayard Taylor, Mark Twain, and the Cary\r\nsisters, were a few among Americans; and Thackeray, Matthew\r\nArnold, George Augustus Sala, and I know not how many others,\r\nfrom abroad. No catalogue of them, but only types can be given\r\nhere. He was almost never without people who made no claim to\r\ndistinction; and to them, too, he was the genial, urbane, and\r\nentertaining host.\r\n\r\nThere was a depth of warm humanity in Mr. Barnum's inmost texture\r\nthat his public fame does not fully disclose. That children liked\r\nhim has been already often said; but those in maturer\r\nyouth--young gentlemen and ladies--felt, somehow, that he never\r\nceased, at any age, to be their contemporary. No younger and more\r\nhopeful thoughts were offered than his. If, as sometimes\r\nhappened, when he organized, as he persistently did, the summer\r\npicnic, inland or on the coast, there was a party made for each\r\ndirection, the struggle was to see which could capture Mr.\r\nBarnum. Which way the rest of us might go was not of so much\r\nconsequence; but the party which lost him in behalf of the other,\r\nfelt like one trying to enjoy Hamlet with the chief character\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nAt one time he actually kept a seaside caterer at a distant beach\r\nto receive his guests of twenty or more on a place of his own,\r\nwhenever, on summer days, he could collect guests enough and give\r\nthem attention. It was only necessary to send word in the\r\nmorning, and the tables were ready, and the party was conveyed to\r\nthe shady grounds from Mr. Barnum's door. Swings were not\r\nforgotten for the children, nor was anything forgotten that\r\nconduced to rational joy. If some poor sick person was heard of\r\nin the city, one carriage, Mr. Barnum's own, would go somewhat\r\nout of the way to stop and leave delicacies and presents, not\r\nwithout a few words of sympathy and comfort. When, on one\r\noccasion that I remember, he took two or three hundred people\r\nfrom several towns in the State, and from New York, to Charles\r\nIsland, a summer place midway between Bridgeport and New Haven,\r\nthe hospitality was royal, and even the steamboat tickets were\r\nmysteriously provided for all.\r\n\r\nI have never noticed, in the multitude of printed sketches of Mr.\r\nBarnum's doings, any general mention of his lavish hospitality\r\npoured out for years, but there will be hundreds who can testify\r\nto and will remember it. It was as if he had said: \"As we go\r\nalong through life let us make others happy.\" And he did this\r\nwith no niggardliness or stint, in his private life as well as in\r\nhis public career.\r\n\r\nThere is a series of stories of Mr. Barnum's humane endeavors\r\nlonger than Aesop's or Pilpays' fables combined, and it is\r\nimpossible to relate them all. But I have heard one recently that\r\nwill very well illustrate the beneficial manner of his charity,\r\nand which shows that, by native sagacity, he had early learned\r\nthe scientific way of giving--to give so that the gift may be\r\nmore than its surface expression, and so as not to produce\r\nchronic pauperism.\r\n\r\nIt seems that a poor widow, some years ago, went to Mr. Barnum's\r\nhouse and told him she was very poor, and had a large family to\r\nsupport; she could not, in fact, decently support them. But if\r\nMr. Barnum would only loan her $75 with which to buy a\r\nsewing-machine, she assured him she could do enough better to be\r\nable to save a little, and to pay the money back. Mr. Barnum,\r\nthinking her honest and truthful, said she might have the money\r\non the terms suggested, but told her when she had saved the\r\nrequisite amount to bring it to him. After some struggle and\r\nprivation, in due time she did this, and laid it before him.\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"my good woman, you have now fairly earned your\r\nsewing-machine, and you have done one thing more, YOU HAVE\r\nLEARNED HOW TO SAVE.\" And thereupon he handed back the money, and\r\ntold her to put it in safe keeping.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum's deep attachment for Bridgeport grew year by year,\r\nand was most strikingly manifessed. The thousands of trees he had\r\nset out there, the new streets he opened, and the Seaside Park,\r\nwhich was his creation mainly, are but a few of the evidences of\r\nhis public enterprise. The Barnum Historical and Scientific\r\nInstitute, and the Barnum Gymnasium were among his latest\r\nendowments, East Bridgeport he practically gave existence to, and\r\nboth that and the city proper are so essentially his monument\r\nthat you cannot now divorce the name of Bridgeport from that of\r\nBarnum.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when certain experiments were made to test the\r\npresence of ozone in the air, and much was said of its value to\r\nhealth, Mr. Barnum had the air at Bridgeport put on trial, and\r\nproved exultingly that no climate in this country was so\r\nsalubrious as that of Bridgeport, especially in the region of the\r\nSeaside Park. He was very enthusiastic on the subject, and wrote\r\nto the local papers, to myself, and to others about it to give\r\nthe fact publicity and proper emphasis.\r\n\r\nIt may be said by some that Mr. Barnum, in many of his real\r\nestate enterprises, made money; and so he did, by his foresight,\r\nfaith, and sagacity concerning his adopted town. He partly\r\nforesaw the future of Bridgeport, and then largely made it. But\r\nif he had not made money--and his example was open for others to\r\nfollow--he could have had no money to give. He used to say\r\nhimself, half jokingly: \"I believe in a profitable philanthropy,\"\r\nwhich illustrates one of his characteristic traits--his absolute\r\nfrankness. In fact, he was so open-hearted about himself that no\r\naccount he ever gave of his private doings was ever flattering or\r\nexalted. He wore no phylacteries, and was as far away as possible\r\nfrom Pecksniffian pretensions.\r\n\r\nIn early life he suffered hardship and deprivations, and no Mark\r\nTapley ever met them with more composure and, on occasions, with\r\nmore hilarity. But he knew well what comfort and convenience are,\r\nand when they were at his command he enjoyed their best gifts. He\r\nonce told me that it pained him to see Mr. Greeley omit those\r\nlittle cares for himself in later life to which he was surely\r\nentitled, and so, when he was his guest for many days together,\r\nhe took care to provide him with a loose morning coat and\r\ncomfortable slippers, and would not have him drop in an ordinary\r\nchair by accident, but secured for him the easiest one.\r\n\r\nBusy as Mr. Barnum was, he found many hours for social and other\r\npleasures. He did this by his systematic allotment of his time.\r\nAll the machinery of his household and his business ran with a\r\nsmoothness and punctuality that would have delighted George\r\nWashington. Everything was on time; his meals were regular--not\r\nmovable feasts. It was a wonder how he wrote so many letters,\r\nforeign and domestic; dispatched so promptly his household and\r\nhis city affairs, and his out-of-town business; met all sorts of\r\ncallers on all sorts of errands; and yet spared time for rides, a\r\nsocial game or talk, and an evening out with so much frequency.\r\nAbsolute idleness was positively painful to him; occupation of\r\nsome sort he must have, and to the very end he had and enjoyed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely realize, even now, that he is really gone--so\r\nclear of mind and active was he to the very last. Nor can it be\r\neasily imagined how Bridgeport in this generation can accustom\r\nitself to so great a loss. To hear that the average man--of\r\ndistinction even--has died, seems common and credible. But the\r\nmessage which announced Mr. Barnum's death came like a troubled\r\ndream from which we somehow expect to awaken. That one so full of\r\nlife as to be its very embodiment, should leave us, it will take\r\ntime to fully comprehend. If, in the world, his demise leaves a\r\nstriking and peculiar void, to a multitude of friends it comes\r\nwith a tender sorrow that shall tincture indelibly many flowing\r\nyears.                                        J. B.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAmong letters that have come to hand we select the following as\r\nthe tribute of a representative American divine:\r\n\r\n                                      BROOKLYN, April 16th, 1891.\r\nDear Mr. Benton:\r\n\r\nThere was a Mr. Barnum whom all the world knew, and whose name is\r\nfamiliar in every civilized land; but there was another Mr.\r\nBarnum whom we, his intimate friends knew, and regarded with a\r\nhearty affection. That he was a most courteous gentleman and the\r\nentertaining companion at his table and hospitable fireside, is\r\nbut a part of the truth. He had a big warm heart that bound all\r\nhis friends to him with hooks of steel.\r\n\r\nI first met him on the platform of a grand temperance banquet, in\r\nTripler Hall, New York, thirty-nine years ago--where he and Mr.\r\nBeecher, and Dr. Chapin, Hon. Horace Mann, Gen. Houston, of\r\nTexas, and myself were the speakers.\r\n\r\nA gold medal was presented that evening to the Hon. Neal Dow, of\r\nMaine, the father of the \"Prohibitory Law.\" Mr. Barnum made a\r\nvery vivacious and vigorous address. In after years he delivered\r\nseveral addresses in behalf of Total Abstinence in my church, and\r\nthey were admirable specimens of close argument, most pungently\r\npresented. He indulged in but few witticisms or amusing stories;\r\nfor, as he well said, \"The Temperance Reform was too SERIOUS a\r\nmatter for trifling jokes and buffooneries.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of my married life, 1853, Mr. Barnum\r\nvisited me at Trenton, N. J., and he often spoke of the happy\r\nhour he spent at our table, and the cozy dinner my young wife\r\nprepared for him. In after years he often sat at my table, and on\r\ntwo occasions he entertained me with princely hospitality at his\r\nBridgeport mansion. On one occasion he invited the leading\r\nclergymen of the town to meet me.\r\n\r\nWe differed very decidedly in our religious creeds, and never\r\nfell into arguments about them. I honored his conscientious\r\nconvictions, and his staunch adherence to what he believed to be\r\nthe right interpretation of God's Word. With the scoffing\r\nscepticism of the day he had no sympathy, and utterly abhorred\r\nit. His kind heart made him a philanthropist, and in his own\r\npeculiar way he loved to do good to his fellow-men. Surrounded by\r\ninnumerable temptations, he maintained a clean, chaste, and\r\nhonest life, and found his happiest hours in the society of wife\r\nand children, under his own roof-tree. Had Mr. Barnum devoted\r\nhimself to political life he would have made an excellent figure;\r\nfor he had keen sagacity, vast and varied observations of human\r\nnature, and sturdy common sense. In conversation with\r\nintellectual men he always held his own with admirable acumen and\r\nvigor of expression. He was altogether one of the most unique\r\ncharacters that his native State has produced, and when his name\r\nceases to be connected with shows and zoological exhibitions, he\r\nwill be lovingly remembered as the genial friend, the sturdy\r\npatriot, the public-spirited and philanthropic neighbor, and the\r\nhonest, true-hearted man.\r\n                        Yours respectfully,\r\n                              THEODORE L. CUYLER.\r\n\r\n THE FUNERAL.\r\n\r\n April 10th, 1891, was the day set for Mr. Barnum's funeral. The\r\nmorning was cold, gray, and dismal. Nature's heart, with the\r\nspring joy put back and deadened, symboled the melancholy that\r\nhad fallen upon Bridgeport. No town was ever more transformed\r\nthan was this city by one earthly event. On the public and\r\nprivate buildings were hung the habiliments of woe; flags were at\r\nhalf mast, and, in the store windows were to be seen innumerable\r\nportraits and likenesses of the dead citizen, surrounded by dark\r\ndrapery, or embedded in flowers.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. The people on the street and in the windows of\r\ntheir houses seemed to be thinking of but one thing--their common\r\nloss. The pedestrian walked slower; the voices of talkers, even\r\namong the rougher classes, were more subdued, and in their looks\r\nwas imprinted the unmistakable signal of no common or ordinary\r\nbereavement.\r\n\r\nThe large church was not only filled, with its lecture-room, a\r\nconsiderable time before the hour set for the services; but\r\nthousands of people crowded the sidewalks near-by for hours,\r\nknowing they could only see the arrival and departure of the\r\nfuneral cortege. The private services at the house, \"Marina,\"\r\nnear the Seaside Park, which preceded the public services in the\r\nchurch, were simple and were only witnessed and participated in\r\nby the relatives and immediate friends.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n DR. COLLYER'S TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\nThe immense congregation that filled to repletion the South\r\nCongregational Church, while the last services were being held\r\nover the remains of Hon. P. T. Barnum, were deeply impressed with\r\nthe touching tribute which was paid the great showman and public\r\nbenefactor by his old friend, Rev. Robert Collyer, D. D.\r\n\r\nIt was a pathetic picture which met the eyes of the vast throng.\r\nThe aged preacher, with long white hair hanging loosely on his\r\nshoulders, and an expression of keen sorrow on his kindly face,\r\nstanding in a small pulpit looking down on the remains of his old\r\nand cherished friend. The speaker's voice was strong and steady\r\nthroughout his sermon. Each word of that sad panegyric could be\r\ndistinctly heard in all parts of the edifice, but in offering up\r\nthe last prayer, he broke down. The aged preacher made a strong\r\neffort to control himself, but his voice finally became husky,\r\nand tears streamed down his wrinkled cheeks. The audience was\r\ndeeply touched by this display of feeling, and many ladies among\r\nthe congregation joined with the preacher and wept freely.\r\n\r\nThe immense gathering were unusually quiet when the aged minister\r\ntook his place in the pulpit, and his words were strangely clear,\r\nand distinct in all portions of the church, In his feeling\r\ntribute, Dr. Collyer said:\r\n\r\n\"P. T. Barnum was a born fighter for the weak against the strong,\r\nfor the oppressed against the oppressor. The good heart, tender\r\nas it was brave, would always spring up at the cry for help and\r\nrush on with the sword of assistance. This was not all that made\r\nhim loved, for the good cheer of his nature was like a halo about\r\nhim. He had always time to right a wrong and always time to be a\r\ngood citizen and patriot of the town, State, or republic in which\r\nhe lived. His good, strong face, was known almost as well on the\r\nother side. You may be proud of him as he was proud of his town.\r\nHe helped to strengthen and beautify it, and he did beautify it\r\nin many places. 'It is said that the hand that grasps takes away\r\nthe strength from the hand that ought to give,' and that such a\r\nman must die without friends or blessings. He was not that man.\r\nHe was always the open and generous man, who could not do too\r\nmuch for Bridgeport. He often told me of his desire to help this\r\nplace, and he was not content to wait until after death. What he\r\nhas done for Bridgeport is the same as he has done for other\r\nnoble works. As my brother, Rev. Mr. Fisher, said today, there\r\nwas never anything proposed in this city that had any promise of\r\ngoodness but that he was ready to pour out money and assistance\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\"Faith in one's self fails in the spring if one has not faith in\r\nGod also. He had that faith I know. He had worship, reverence,\r\nand love in his heart, and as he rests from his labors we meet\r\nand linger here for a few minutes and pay respect and honor to\r\nthe memory of a great and good man. We can forget that we belong\r\nto divers churches, and stand here as children of one faith and\r\none baptism, honoring for the last time one who has finished his\r\nlabors here and with a crown of glory for his reward, has joined\r\nin his eternal home the Father he served so well.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the church services were over, the procession moved to\r\nMountain Cemetery, a mile or more distant, where, in a beautiful\r\nplat, long ago arranged, with a modest monument above it, rest\r\nthe remains of Mr. Barnum's first wife. Here, in a place made\r\nbeautiful by nature and improved by art, was consigned the mortal\r\npart of him whose story we have tried, weakly, perhaps, to tell.\r\nGreat masses of flowers, similar to those displayed in the house\r\nand church, were upon the grave and about it, and the people, who\r\ncame there in large numbers, did not leave for hours after the\r\nreligious service had been read.\r\n\r\nA book of good size might be made of the notable expressions\r\ncalled forth by Mr. Barnum's death from leading journals and men\r\nknown to fame. It is impossible to give any fair sample of them\r\nhere, but the London Times' leader of April 8th may serve,\r\nperhaps, as a good specimen:\r\n\r\n \"Barnum is gone. That fine flower of Western civilization, that\r\narbiter elegantiarum to Demos, has lived. At the age of eighty,\r\nafter a life of restless energy and incessant publicity, the\r\ngreat showman has lain down to rest. He gave, in the eyes of the\r\nseekers after amusement, a lustre to America. * * * He created\r\nthe metier of showman on a grandiose scale worthy to be professed\r\nby a man of genius. He early realized that essential feature of a\r\nmodern democracy, its readiness to be led to what will amuse and\r\ninstruct it. He knew that 'the people' means crowds, paying\r\ncrowds; that crowds love the fashion and will follow it; and that\r\nthe business of the great man is to make and control the fashion.\r\nTo live on, by, and before the public was his ideal. For their\r\nsake and his own, he loved to bring the public to see, to\r\napplaud, and to pay. His immense activity, covering all those\r\nyears, marked him out as one of the most typical and conspicuous\r\nof Yankees. From Jenny Lind to Jumbo, no occasion of a public\r\n'sensation' came amiss to him.\r\n\r\n\"Phineas Taylor Barnum, born in 1810, at Bethel, Connecticut--how\r\nserious and puritanical it sounds! --would have died with a\r\nmerely local reputation unless chance had favored him by putting\r\nin his way something to make a hit with. He stumbled across\r\nCharles H. Stratton, the famous, the immortal 'General Tom Thumb'\r\nof our childhood. Together they came to Europe and held\r\n'receptions' everywhere. It was the moment when the Queen's\r\neldest children were in the nursery, and Barnum saw that a\r\nfortune depended on his bringing them into friendly relations\r\nwith Tom Thumb. He succeeded; and the British public flocked to\r\nsee the amusing little person who had shown off his mature yet\r\nminiature dimensions by the side of the baby Heir Apparent. Then\r\ncame the Jenny Lind furore. Then came a publicity of a different\r\nsort. Mr. Barnum became a legislator for his State, and even, in\r\n1875, Mayor of Bridgeport. Why not? The man who can organize the\r\namusements of the people may very well be trusted to organize a\r\nfew of their laws for them.\r\n\r\n\"When, in 1889, the veteran brought over his shipload of giants\r\nand dwarfs, chariots and waxworks, spangles and circus-riders, to\r\nentertain the people of London, one wanted a Carlyle to come\r\nforward with a discourse upon 'the Hero as Showman.' It was the\r\nne plus ultra of publicity. * * * There was a three-fold\r\nshow--the things in the stalls and cages, the showman, and the\r\nworld itself. And of the three perhaps Barnum himself was the\r\nmost interesting. The chariot races and the monstrosities we can\r\nget elsewhere, but the octogenarian showman was unique. His name\r\nis a proverb already, and a proverb it will continue.\"",
