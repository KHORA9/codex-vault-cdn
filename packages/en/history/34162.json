PLATES.\r\n\r\n  Defence for ships.\r\n\r\n  History.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded proposal to employ armour for ships of war (for\r\nbody armour, &c., see ARMS AND ARMOUR) appears to have been made in\r\nEngland by Sir William Congreve in 1805. In _The Times_ of the 20th of\r\nFebruary of that year reference is made to Congreve's designs for an\r\narmoured, floating mortar battery which the inventor considered would be\r\nproof against artillery fire. Among Congreve's unpublished papers there\r\nis also a suggestion for armour-plating the embrasures of casemates.\r\nNothing, however, seems to have come of these proposals, and a similar\r\nlack of appreciation befell the next advocate of armour, John Stevens of\r\nNew Jersey, U.S.A., who submitted the plans of an armoured vessel to\r\nCongress in 1812. The Stevens family, however, continued to work at the\r\nsubject, and by 1841 had determined by actual experiment the thickness\r\nof wrought-iron armour which was proof against the projectiles then in\r\nuse. The necessity for armouring ships as a protection against shell\r\nfire was again pointed out by General Paixhans in 1841, and in 1845\r\nDupuy de Lome had prepared the designs of an armoured frigate for the\r\nFrench government. During the period between 1827 and 1854, experiments\r\nin connexion with the proposed application of armour to both ships and\r\nforts were carried out in England, the United States and France, but the\r\nquestion did not get beyond the experimental stage until the latter\r\nyear, when armoured floating batteries were laid down in all three\r\ncountries, probably as the immediate outcome of the destruction of the\r\nTurkish fleet by shell fire at Sinope on the 30th of November 1853.\r\n\r\nThree of the French floating batteries were in action at the bombardment\r\nof Kinburn in 1855, where they achieved a conspicuous success, silencing\r\nthe Russian forts after a four hours' engagement, during which they\r\nthemselves, although frequently struck, were practically uninjured,\r\ntheir loss in personnel being but trifling. To quote Very: \"This\r\ncomparatively insignificant action, which had little if any effect upon\r\nthe course of the Crimean War, changed the whole condition of armour for\r\nnaval use from one of speculation to one of actual and constant\r\nnecessity.\" The military application of armour for the protection of\r\nguns mounted in permanent fortifications followed. Its development,\r\nhowever, took rather a different course, and the question of armour\r\ngenerally is of less importance for the military engineer than for the\r\nnaval constructor. For the employment of armour in ship construction and\r\nin permanent works on land, see the articles SHIPBUILDING; FORTIFICATION\r\nAND SIEGECRAFT; the present article is concerned solely with the actual\r\narmour itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Construction and testing.\r\n\r\nThe earliest armour, both for ships and forts, was made of wrought iron,\r\nand was disposed either in a single thickness or in successive layers\r\nsandwiched with wood or concrete. Such armour is now wholly obsolete,\r\nthough examples of it may still be found in a few forts of early date.\r\nThe chief application of armour in modern land defences is in the form\r\nof shields for the protection of guns mounted _en barbette_. Examples of\r\nsuch shields are shown in figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows a 4.5-in. steel\r\nshield for the U.S.A. government, face-hardened by the Harvey process,\r\nto which reference is made below. It was attacked by 5-in. and 6-in.\r\narmour-piercing shot, and proved capable of keeping out the 5-in. up to\r\na striking velocity of nearly 1800 ft. per second, but was defeated by a\r\n6-in. capped A.P. shot with a striking velocity of 1842 ft. per second.\r\nThe mounting was not seriously damaged by the firing, but could be\r\noperated after the impact of one 3.2-in., five 5-in. and three 6-in.\r\nprojectiles. Fig. 2 shows a gun-shield, manufactured by Messrs Hadfield\r\nof Sheffield, after attack by 4.1-in., 4.7-in. and 6-in. armour-piercing\r\nand other projectiles. The limit of the shield's resistance was just\r\nreached by an uncapped 4.7-in. A.P. shell with a striking velocity of\r\n2128 ft. per second. The shield (the average maximum thickness of which\r\nwas 5.8 in.) showed great toughness, and although subjected to a severe\r\nbattering, and occasionally outmatched by the attacking projectiles,\r\ndeveloped no visible crack. It is chiefly remarkable for the fact that\r\nit was cast and not forged. As is evident from the fringing around the\r\nhole made by the 6-in. A.P. shell, the shield was not face-hardened. A\r\nmore highly developed form of the gun-shield is to be found in the\r\narmoured cupola, which has been employed to a very considerable extent\r\nin permanent fortifications, and whose use is still strongly advocated\r\nby continental European military engineers. The majority of the cupolas\r\nto be found in continental forts are not, however, of very recent date,\r\nthose erected in 1894 at Molsheim near Strassburg being comparatively\r\nmodern instances. Any cupolas constructed nowadays would be of steel,\r\neither forged or cast, and would probably be face-hardened, but a large\r\nnumber of those extant are of compound or even of iron armour. Many of\r\nthose on sea-fronts are made of chilled cast iron. Such armour, which\r\nwas introduced by Gruson of Magdeburg in 1868, is extremely hard, and\r\ncannot be perforated, but must be destroyed by fracture. It is thus the\r\nantithesis of wrought iron, which, when of good quality, does not break\r\nup under the impact of the shot but yields by perforation. Armour of the\r\nGruson type is well adapted for curved surfaces such as cupolas, which\r\non account of their shape are scarcely liable to receive a direct hit,\r\nexcept at distant ranges, and its extreme hardness would greatly assist\r\nit to throw off shot striking obliquely, which have naturally a tendency\r\nto glance. Chilled iron, on account of its liability to break up when\r\nsubjected to a continuous bombardment by the armour-piercing steel\r\nprojectiles of guns of even medium calibre, was usually considered\r\nunsuitable for employment in inland forts, where wrought iron, mild\r\nsteel or compound armour was preferred. On the other hand, as pointed\r\nout by the late Captain C. Orde Browne, R.A., it was admirably adapted\r\nto resist the few rounds that the heavy guns of battleships might be\r\nexpected to deliver during an attack of comparatively limited duration.\r\n\r\nChilled iron was never employed for naval purposes, and warship armour\r\ncontinued to be made exclusively of wrought iron until 1876 when steel\r\nwas introduced by Schneider. In an important trial at Spezzia in that\r\nyear the superiority in resisting power of steel to wrought iron was\r\nconclusively proved, but, on the other hand, steel showed a great\r\ntendency to through-cracking, a defect which led Messrs Cammell of\r\nSheffield in 1877 to introduce compound armour consisting of a steel\r\nsurface in intimate union with a wrought-iron foundation plate. In\r\nCammell plates, which were made by the Wilson process, the steel face\r\nwas formed by running molten steel on to a white-hot foundation plate of\r\niron, while in the compound plates, made by Messrs John Brown & Co.\r\naccording to the patent of J.D. Ellis, a thin steel surface plate was\r\ncemented on to the wrought-iron foundation by running in molten steel\r\nbetween. Compound armour possessed the advantages of a harder face than\r\nwas then possible in a homogeneous steel plate, while, on the other\r\nhand, the back was softer and less liable to crack. Its weak point was\r\nthe liability of the surface plate to crack through under fire and\r\nbecome detached from its iron backing. The manufacture of steel,\r\nhowever, continued to improve, so that in 1890 we find steel plates\r\nbeing made which were comparatively free from liability to\r\nthrough-cracking, while their power to resist perforation was somewhat\r\ngreater than that of the best compound. The difference, however, was at\r\nno time very marked, and between 1880 and 1890 the resistance to\r\nperforation of either steel or compound as compared with wrought iron\r\nmay be taken as about 1.3 to 1.\r\n\r\nCompound armour required to be well backed to bring out its best\r\nqualities, and there is a case on record in 1883 when a 12-in. Cammell\r\nplate weighing 10-1/2 tons, backed by granite, stopped a 16-in. Palliser\r\nshot with a striking energy of nearly 30,000 foot tons and a calculated\r\nperforation of 25 inches of wrought iron. As steel improved, efforts\r\nwere made to impart an even greater hardness to the actual surface or\r\nskin of compound armour, and, with this object in view, Captain T.J.\r\nTresidder, C.M.G., patented in 1887 a method of chilling the heated\r\nsurface of a plate by means of jets of water under pressure. By this\r\nmethod it was found possible to obtain a degree of hardness which was\r\nprevented in ordinary plunging by the formation of a layer of steam\r\nbetween the water and the heated surface of the plate. Compound plates\r\nface-hardened on this system gave excellent results, and forged-steel\r\narmour-piercing projectiles were in some cases broken up on their\r\nsurfaces as if they had been merely chilled iron. Attempts were also\r\nmade to increase the toughness of the back by the substitution of mild\r\nnickel steel for wrought iron. The inherent defect of compound armour,\r\nhowever--its want of homogeneity,--remained, and in the year 1891 H.A.\r\nHarvey of Newark, N.J., introduced a process whereby an all steel plate\r\ncould be face-hardened in such a way that the advantages of the compound\r\nprinciple were obtained in a homogeneous plate. The process in question\r\nconsisted in carburizing or cementing the surface of a steel plate by\r\nkeeping it for a fortnight or so at a high temperature in contact with\r\nfinely divided charcoal, so that the heated surface absorbed a certain\r\namount of carbon, which penetrated to a considerable depth, thus causing\r\na difference in chemical composition between the front and back of the\r\nplate. After it had been left a sufficient time in the cementation\r\nfurnace, the plate was withdrawn and allowed to cool slowly until it\r\nreached a dull red heat, when it was suddenly chilled by the application\r\nof water, but by a less perfect method than that employed by Tresidder.\r\nSteel plates treated by the Harvey and Tresidder processes, which\r\nshortly became combined, possessed about twice the resisting power of\r\nwrought iron. The figure of merit, or resistance to penetration as\r\ncompared with wrought iron, varied with the thickness of the plate,\r\nbeing rather more than 2 with plates from 6 to 8 in. thick and rather\r\nless for the thicker plates. In 1889 Schneider introduced the use of\r\nnickel in steel for armour plates, and in 1891 or 1892 the St Chamond\r\nworks employed a nickel steel to which was added a small percentage of\r\nchromium.\r\n\r\nAll modern armour contains nickel in percentages varying from 3 to 5,\r\nand from 1.0 to 2.0% of chromium is also employed as a general rule.\r\nNickel in the above quantities adds greatly to the toughness as well as\r\nto the hardness of steel, while chromium enables it to absorb carbon to\r\na greater depth during cementation, and increases its susceptibility to\r\ntempering, besides conducing to a tough fibrous condition in the body of\r\na plate. Alloy steels of this nature appear to be very susceptible to\r\nthermal treatment, by suitable variation of which, with or without oil\r\nquenching, the physical condition of the same steel may be made to vary\r\nto an extraordinary extent, a peculiarity which is turned to good\r\naccount in the manufacture of the modern armour plate.\r\n\r\nThe principal modern process is that introduced by Krupp in 1893.\r\nAlthough it is stated that a few firms both in Great Britain and in\r\nother countries use special processes of their own, it is probable that\r\nthey differ only in detail from the Krupp process, which has been\r\nadopted by the great majority of makers. Krupp plates are made of\r\nnickel-chrome steel and undergo a special heat treatment during\r\nmanufacture which is briefly described below. They can either be\r\ncemented or, as was usual in England until about 1902 in the case of the\r\nthinner plates (4 in. and under) and those used for curved structures\r\nsuch as casemates, non-cemented. They are in either case face-hardened\r\nby chilling. Messrs Krupp have, however, cemented plates of 3 in. and\r\nupward since 1895. Although the full process is now applied to plates of\r\nas little as 2 in. in thickness, there is some difference of opinion\r\nbetween manufacturers as to the value of cementing these very thin\r\nplates. The simple Harvey process is still employed to some extent in\r\nthe case of plates between 5 and 3 in. in thickness, and excellent\r\nresults are also stated to have been obtained with plates from 2 to 4\r\nin. in thickness, manufactured from a special steel by the process\r\npatented by M. Charpy of the St Jacques steel works at Montlucon. A\r\nKrupp cemented (K.C.) plate is not perhaps harder as regards surface\r\nthan a good Harveyed plate, but the depth of hard face is greater, and\r\nthe plate is very much tougher in the back, a quality which is of\r\nparticular importance in the thicker plates. The figure of merit varies,\r\nas in Harveyed plates, with the thickness of the armour, being about 2.7\r\nin the case of good 6-in. plates while for the thicker plates the value\r\ngradually falls off to about 2.3 in the case of 12-in. armour. This\r\nfigure of merit is as against uncapped armour-piercing shot of\r\napproximately the same calibre as the thickness of the plate. The\r\nresisting power of the non-cemented Krupp plates is usually regarded as\r\nbeing considerably less than that of the cemented plates, and may be\r\ntaken on an average to be 2.25 times that of wrought iron.\r\n\r\nFigs. 3, 4 and 5 are illustrations of good cemented plates of the Krupp\r\ntype. Fig. 3 shows an 11.8-in. plate, tried by Messrs Krupp in 1895,\r\nafter attack by three 12-in. steel armour-piercing projectiles of from\r\n712.7 to 716.1 lb. in weight. In the third round the striking velocity\r\nof the projectile was 1993 ft. per second, the calculated perforation of\r\nwrought iron by Tresidder's formula being 25.9 in. The attack was\r\nsuccessfully resisted, all the projectiles being broken up without\r\neffecting perforation, while there were no serious cracks. The figure of\r\nmerit of the plate was thus well in excess of 2.2. The great toughness\r\nof the plate is perhaps even more remarkable than its hardness; its\r\nwidth was only 6.28 ft., so that each shot head formed a wedge of\r\napproximately one-sixth of its width. The excellence of the metal which\r\nis capable of withstanding such a strain is apparent.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 is of a 9-in. K.C. plate, made by Messrs Armstrong, Whitworth &\r\nCo. for the Japanese government, after undergoing an unusually severe\r\nofficial test. The fourth round was capable of perforating 22 in. of\r\nwrought iron, so that the figure of merit of the plate must have been\r\nconsiderably in excess of 2.45, as there were no through-cracks, and the\r\nlimit of resistance was far from being reached.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows the front of an excellent 6-in. cemented plate of Messrs\r\nBeardmore's manufacture, tried at Eskmeals on the 11th of October 1901.\r\nIt withstood the attack of four armour-piercing 6-in. shot of 100 lb.\r\nweight, with striking velocities varying from 1996 to 2177 ft. per\r\nsecond. Its limit of resistance was just passed by the fifth round in\r\nwhich the striking velocity was no less than 2261 ft. per second. The\r\nprojectile, which broke up in passing through the plate, did not get\r\nthrough the skin plate behind the wood backing, and evidently had no\r\nsurplus energy left. The figure of merit of this plate was between 2.6\r\nand 2.8, but was evidently much closer to the latter than to the former\r\nfigure. A sixth round fired with a Johnson capped shot weighing 105.9\r\nlb. easily perforated both plate and backing with a striking velocity of\r\n1945 ft. per second, thus reducing the figure of merit of the plate to\r\nbelow 2.2 and illustrating very clearly the advantage given by capping\r\nthe point of an armour-piercing projectile. There were no through-cracks\r\nin the plate after this severe trial, the back being evidently as tough\r\nas the face was hard.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 shows a 3-in. K.N.C. plate of Messrs Vickers, Sons & Maxim's\r\nmanufacture, tested privately by the firm in November 1905. It proved to\r\nbe of unusual excellence, its limit of resistance being just reached by\r\na 12-1/2-lb. armour-piercing shell of 3 in. calibre with a striking\r\nvelocity of 2558 ft. per second, a result which, even if the projectiles\r\nused were not relatively of the same perforating power as those used in\r\nthe proof of 6-in. and thicker plates, shows that its resisting power\r\nwas very great. At a low estimate its figure of merit against 3-in. A.P.\r\n_shot_ may be taken as about 2.6, which is exceptionally high for a\r\nnon-cemented, or indeed for any but the best K.C. plates.\r\n\r\nThe plate also withstood the attack of a 4.7-in. service pattern steel\r\narmour-piercing shell of 45 lb. weight striking the unbacked portion\r\nwith a velocity of 1599 ft. per second, and was only just beaten by a\r\nsimilar shell with a velocity of 1630 ft. per second. The effect of all\r\nthe above-mentioned rounds is shown in the photograph. The same plate\r\nsubsequently kept out two 6-in. common shell filled up to weight with\r\nsalt and plugged, with striking velocities of 1412 and 1739 ft. per\r\nsecond respectively, the former being against the unbacked and the\r\nlatter against the backed half of the plate,--the only effect on the\r\nplate being that round 6 caused a fragment of the right-hand top corner\r\nof the plate to break off, and round 7 started a few surface cracks\r\nbetween the points of impact of rounds 1, 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nWithin the limitations referred to below, the resisting power of all\r\nhard-faced plates is very much reduced when the armour-piercing\r\nprojectiles used in the attack are capped, the average figure of merit\r\nof Krupp cemented plates not being more than 2 against capped shot as\r\ncompared with about 2.5 against uncapped. So long ago as 1878 it was\r\nsuggested by Lt.-Col. (then Captain) T. English, R.E., that\r\narmour-piercing projectiles would be assisted in attacking compound\r\nplates if caps of wrought iron could be fitted to their points.\r\nExperiments at Shoeburyness, however, did not show that any advantage\r\nwas gained by this device, and nothing further was heard of the cap\r\nuntil 1894, when experiments carried out in Russia with so-called\r\n\"magnetic\" shot against plates of Harveyed steel showed that the\r\nperforating power of an armour-piercing projectile was considerably\r\naugmented where hard-faced plates were concerned, if its point were\r\nprotected by a cap of wrought iron or mild steel. The conditions of the\r\nRussian results (and of subsequent trials in various parts of the world\r\nwhich have confirmed them) differed considerably from the earlier\r\nEnglish ones. The material of both projectiles and plates differed, as\r\ndid also the velocities employed--the low velocities in the earlier\r\ntrials probably contributing in large measure to the non-success of the\r\ncap. The cap, as now used, consists of a thimble of comparatively soft\r\nsteel of from 3 to 5% of the weight of the projectile, attached to the\r\npoint of the latter either by solder or by being pressed hydraulically\r\nor otherwise into grooves or indentations in the head. Its function\r\nappears to be to support the point on impact, and so to enable it to get\r\nunbroken through the hard face layers of the plate. Once through the\r\ncemented portion with its point intact, a projectile which is strong\r\nenough to remain undeformed, will usually perforate the plate by a true\r\nboring action if its striking velocity be high enough. In the case of\r\nthe uncapped projectile, on the other hand, the point is almost\r\ninvariably crushed against the hard face and driven back as a wedge into\r\nthe body of the projectile, which is thus set up so that, instead of\r\nboring, it acts as a punch and dislodges or tends to dislodge a coned\r\nplug or disk of metal, the greatest diameter of which may be as much as\r\nfour times the calibre of the projectile. The disproportion between the\r\nmaximum diameter of the disk and that of the projectile is particularly\r\nmarked when the calibre of the latter is much in excess of the thickness\r\nof the plate. When plate and projectile are equally matched, e.g. 6\"\r\nversus 6\", the plug of metal dislodged may be roughly cylindrical in\r\nshape, and its diameter not greatly in excess of that of the projectile.\r\nIn all cases the greatest width of the plug or disk is at the back of\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\nA stout and rigid backing evidently assists a plate very much more\r\nagainst this class of attack than against the perforating attack of a\r\ncapped shot. Fig. 7 shows the back of a 6-in. plate attacked in 1898,\r\nand affords an excellent illustration of the difference in action of\r\ncapped and uncapped projectiles. In round 7 the star-shaped opening made\r\nby the point of a capped shot boring its way through is seen, while\r\nrounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 show disks of plate partially dislodged by uncapped\r\nprojectiles. The perforating action of capped armour-piercing\r\nprojectiles is even better shown in fig. 8, which shows a 250-mm. (9.8\r\nin.) Krupp plate after attack by 150-mm. (5.9 in.) capped A.P. shot. In\r\nrounds 5 and 6 the projectiles, with striking velocities of 2302 and\r\n2281 ft. per second, perforated. Round 7, with a striking velocity of\r\n2244 ft. per second, just got its point through and rebounded, while\r\nround 8, with a striking velocity of 2232, lodged in the plate. In many\r\ncases a capped projectile punches out a plug, usually more or less\r\ncylindrical in shape and of about the same diameter as the projectile,\r\nfrom a plate, and does not defeat it by a true boring action. In such\r\ncases it will probably be found that the projectile has been broken up,\r\nand that only the head, set up and in a more or less crushed condition,\r\nhas got through the plate. This peculiarity of action can best be\r\naccounted for by attributing either abnormal excellence to the plate or\r\nto that portion of it concerned--for plates sometimes vary considerably\r\nand are not of uniform hardness throughout,--or comparative inferiority\r\nto the projectile. Whichever way it may be, what has happened appears to\r\nbe that after the cap has given the point sufficient support to get it\r\nthrough the very hard surface layers, the point has been flattened in\r\nthe region of extreme hardness and toughness combined, which exists\r\nimmediately behind the deeply carburized surface. The action from this\r\npoint becomes a punching one, and the extra strain tends to break up the\r\nprojectile, so that the latter gets through wholly or partially, in a\r\nbroken condition, driving a plug of plate in front of it. At low\r\nstriking velocities, probably in the neighbourhood of 1700 ft. per\r\nsecond, the cap fails to act, and no advantage is given by it to the\r\nshot. This is probably because the velocity is sufficiently low to give\r\nthe cap time to expand and so fail to grip the point as the latter is\r\nforced into it. The cap also fails as a rule to benefit the projectile\r\nwhen the angle of incidence is more than 30 deg. to the normal.\r\n\r\n[Illustrstion: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--HARVEYIZED SHIELD, 4.5 INCHES THICK, ON 6-INCH PEDESTAL\r\n  MOUNT, AFTER ATTACK BY 5-INCH AND 6-INCH CAPPED ARMOUR-PIERCING SHOT.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.--GUN SHIELD, 6 INCHES THICK, AFTER ATTACK.

Although in some cases based on very different theoretical\r\nconsiderations, there is a general agreement among them as far as\r\nperforation proper is concerned, and Tresidder's formula for the\r\nperforation of wrought iron, t^2 = wv^3/dA, may be taken as typical.\r\nHere t represents the thickness perforable in inches, w the weight of\r\nthe projectile in pounds, v its velocity in foot seconds, d its diameter\r\nin inches and A the constant given by log A = 8.8410.\r\n\r\nFor the perforation of Harveyed or Krupp cemented armour by capped\r\narmour-piercing shot, this formula may be employed in conjunction with a\r\nsuitable constant according to the nature of armour attacked. In the\r\ncase of K. C. armour the formula becomes t^2 = wv^(3)/4dA. A useful\r\nrough rule is t/d = v/1900.\r\n\r\nHard armour, such as chilled cast iron, cannot be perforated but must be\r\ndestroyed by fracture, and its destruction is apparently dependent\r\nsolely upon the striking energy of the projectile and independent of its\r\ndiameter. The punching of hard-faced armour by uncapped projectiles is\r\nintermediate in character between perforation and cracking, but\r\napproaches the former more nearly than the latter. The formula most used\r\nin England in this case is Krupp's formula for K.C., viz. t^2 =\r\nwv^2/dA^1, where t, w, v and d are the same as before, and log A^1 =\r\n6.3532. This, if we assume the sectional density (w/d^3) of projectiles\r\nto be constant and equal to 0.46, reduces to the very handy rule of\r\nthumb t/d = v/2200, which, within the limits of striking velocity\r\nobtainable under service conditions, is sufficiently accurate for\r\npractical purposes. For oblique attack up to an angle of 30 deg. to the\r\nnormal, the same formula may be employed, t sec [theta] being\r\nsubstituted for t, where [theta] is the angle of incidence and t the\r\nnormal thickness of the plate attacked. More exact results would be\r\nobtained, however, by the use of Tresidder's W.I. formula, given above,\r\nin conjunction with a suitable figure of merit, according to the nature\r\nand thickness of the plate. It should be remembered in this connexion\r\nthat the figure of merit of a plate against a punching attack falls off\r\nvery much when the thickness of the plate is considerably less than the\r\ncalibre of the attacking projectile. For example, the F.M. of a 6-in.\r\nplate may be 2.6 against 6-in. uncapped A.P. projectiles, but only 2.2\r\nagainst 9.2-in. projectiles of the same character. In the case of the\r\nperforating action of capped projectiles, on the other hand, the ratio\r\nof d and t does not appear to affect the F.M. to any great extent,\r\nthough according to Tresidder, the latter is inclined to fall when d is\r\nconsiderably less than t, which is the exact opposite of what happens\r\nwith punching.\r\n\r\nAnother method of measuring the quality of armour, which is largely\r\nemployed upon the continent of Europe, is by the ratio, r, between the\r\nvelocity requisite to perforate any given plate and that needed to\r\npierce a plate of mild steel of the same thickness, according to the\r\nformula of Commandant Jacob de Marre, viz. v = Ae^(0.7).a^(0.75)/p^(0.5)\r\nwhere e = the thickness of the plate in centimetres, a = the calibre of\r\nthe projectile in centimetres, p = the weight of the projectile in\r\nkilogrammes, v = the striking velocity of the projectile in metres per\r\nsecond, and log A = 1.7347. Converted into the usual English units and\r\nnotation, this formula becomes v = A^1t^(0.7).d^(0.75)/w^(0.5), in\r\nwhich log A^1 = 3.0094; in this form it constitutes the basis of the\r\nballistic tests for the acceptance of armour plates for the U.S. navy.\r\n\r\nCommon shell, which are not strong enough to remain undeformed on\r\nimpact, derive little benefit from the cap and usually defeat a plate by\r\npunching rather than by perforation. Their punching power may be taken\r\nroughly as about 2/3 that of an uncapped armour-piercing shot. Shells\r\nfilled with high explosives, unless special arrangements are made to\r\ndeaden the bursting charge and so obviate detonation upon impact, are\r\nonly effective against the thinnest armour.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Manufacture.\r\n\r\nWith regard to manufacture, a brief account of the Krupp process as\r\napplied in one of the great English armour plate works (omitting\r\nconfidential details of temperature, &c.) will illustrate the great\r\ncomplexity of treatment which the modern armour plate has to undergo\r\nbefore its remarkable qualities of combined hardness and toughness can\r\nbe developed. The composition of the steel probably differs slightly\r\nwith the manufacturer, and also with the thickness of the armour, but it\r\nwill usually contain from 3 to 4% of nickel, from 1.0 to 2.0% of\r\nchromium and about 0.25 to 0.35% of carbon, together with from 0.3 to\r\n0.7% of manganese. After being cast, the ingot is first heated to a\r\nuniform degree of temperature throughout its mass and then generally\r\nforged under the hydraulic forging press. It is then reheated and passed\r\nthrough the rolls. After rolling, the plate is allowed to cool, and is\r\nthen subjected to a thermal treatment preparatory to surfacing and\r\ncutting. Its surface is then freed from scale and planed. After planing,\r\nthe plate is passed into the cementation furnace, where its face remains\r\nfor some weeks in contact with specially prepared carbon, the\r\ntemperature being gradually raised to that required for cementation and\r\nas gradually lowered after that is effected. After cementation the plate\r\nis heated to a certain temperature and is then plunged into an oil bath\r\nin order to toughen it. After withdrawal from the oil bath, the plate is\r\ncooled, reheated to a lower temperature, quenched again in water,\r\nreheated and passed to the bending press, where it is bent to shape\r\nwhile hot, proper allowance being made for the slight change of curve\r\nwhich takes place on the final chilling. After bending it is again\r\nheated and then allowed to get cold, when the final machining, drilling\r\nand cutting are carried out. The plate is now placed in a furnace and\r\ndifferentially heated so that the face is raised to a higher temperature\r\nthan the back. After being thus heated for a certain period the plate is\r\nwithdrawn, and both back and face are douched simultaneously with jets\r\nof cold water under pressure, the result being that the face is left\r\nglass-hard while the back is in the toughest condition possible for such\r\nhard steel.\r\n\r\nThe cast-steel armour made by Hadfield has already been alluded to. That\r\nmade by Krupp (the only other maker at present of this class of armour)\r\nis of face-hardened nickel steel. A 5.9-in. plate of this material tried\r\nin 1902 had a figure of merit of more than 2.2 against uncapped 5.9-in.\r\narmour-piercing projectiles of 112 lb. in weight. The main advantage of\r\ncast armour is that it is well adapted to armoured structures of\r\ncomplicated design and of varying thickness, which it would be difficult\r\nor impossible to forge in one piece. It should also be cheaper than\r\nforged armour, and, should time be a consideration, could probably be\r\nturned out more quickly; on the other hand, it is improbable that heavy\r\ncastings such as would be required could be as regular in quality and as\r\nfree from flaws as is possible when forged material is used, and it is\r\nunlikely that the average resistance to attack of cast-steel armour will\r\never be equal to that of the best forged steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defence against small-arms.\r\n\r\nOf recent years there has been a considerable demand for thin steel\r\nplating proof against small-arm bullets at close ranges. This class of\r\nsteel is used for field-gun shields and for sap shields, to afford cover\r\nfor men in field-works, for armoured trains, motor-cars and ambulances,\r\nand also very largely for armouring shallow-draught river-gunboats.\r\nHoltzer made chrome steel breastplates in 1890, 0.158 in. of which was\r\nproof against the 0.43-in. hard lead bullet of the Gras rifle at 10\r\nmetres range, while 0.236 in. was proof against the 0.32 in. 231-grain\r\nLebel bullet at the same distance, the striking velocities being\r\napproximately 1490 and 2070 ft. per second respectively. The\r\nbullet-proof steel made by Messrs Cammell, Laird & Co. in Great Britain\r\nmay be taken as typical of that produced by the best modern\r\nmanufacturers. It is proof against the 215-grain Lee-Enfield bullet of\r\n0.303 in. calibre striking directly, as under:\r\n\r\n   Range.      Thickness of Plate.

The\r\nmaterial is stated to be readily adaptable to the ordinary operation of\r\nbending, machining, drilling, &c., and is thus very suitable for the\r\npurposes indicated above.     (W. E. E.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMS AND ARMOUR (Lat. _arma_, from the Aryan root _ar_, to join or fit;\r\ncf. Gr. [Greek: armos], joint; the form _armour_, from Lat. _armatura_,\r\nshould strictly be _armure_). Under this heading are included weapons of\r\noffence (arms) and defensive equipment (armour). The history of the\r\ndevelopment of arms and armour begins with that of the human race;\r\nindeed, combined with domestic implements, the most primitive weapons\r\nwhich have been found constitute the most important, if not the only,\r\ntangible evidence on which the history of primitive man is based. It is\r\nlargely from the materials and characteristics of the weapons and\r\nutensils found in caves, tombs and various strata of the earth's crust,\r\ncoupled with geological considerations, that the ethnological and\r\nchronological classifications of prehistoric man have been deduced. For\r\na detailed account of this classification and the evidence see\r\nARCHAEOLOGY; BRONZE AGE; FLINT IMPLEMENTS, &c., and articles on special\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Classification.\r\n\r\nOffensive weapons may be classified roughly, according to their shape\r\n(i.e. the kind of blow or wound which they are intended to inflict), and\r\nthe way in which they are used, as follows:--(1) Arms which are wielded\r\nby hand at close quarters. These are subdivided into (a) _cleaving_\r\nweapons, e.g. axes; (b) _crushing_, e.g. clubs, maces and all\r\nhammer-like arms; (c) _thrusting_, e.g. pointed swords and daggers; (d)\r\n_cutting_, e.g. sabres (such weapons frequently combine both the cut and\r\nthe thrust, e.g. swords with both edge and point); (e) those weapons\r\nrepresented by the spear, lance, pike, &c., which deal a thrusting blow\r\nbut are distinguished from (c) by their greater length. (2) Purely\r\nmissile weapons, e.g. darts, javelins and spears. Frequently these\r\nweapons are used also at close quarters as thrusting weapons; the\r\ntypical example of these is the medium-length spear of not more than\r\nabout 6 ft. in length. (3) Arms which discharge missiles, e.g. bows,\r\ncatapults and fire-arms generally. (See ARCHERY and section _Fire-arms_\r\nbelow.) The weapons in (2) and (3) are designed to avoid hand-to-hand\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nWeapons are also classified in a variety of other ways. Thus we have\r\n_small-arms_, i.e. all weapons in classes (1) and (2) with those in (3)\r\nwhich do not require carriages. _Side-arms_ are those which, when not in\r\nuse, are worn at the side, e.g. daggers, swords, bayonets. _Armes\r\nblanches_ is a term used for offensive weapons of iron and steel which\r\nare used at close quarters.\r\n\r\nDefensive armour consists of body armour, protections for the head and\r\nthe limbs, and various types of shield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Leaf-shaped Flint Dagger.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  History.\r\n\r\n1. _Stone Age._--One of the chief problems which have perplexed\r\narchaeologists is that of finding a criterion which will enable them to\r\ndistinguish the most primitive products of human skill from similar\r\nobjects whose form is due to the forces of nature. It is often\r\nimpossible to say precisely whether a rough piece of flint is to be\r\nregarded as a weapon (except so far as it could be used as a missile) or\r\nmerely as a fragment of rock. Passing over these doubtful cases, we come\r\nfirst to indubitable examples of weapons deliberately fashioned in stone\r\nfor offensive purposes. The use of stone weapons appears to have been\r\nuniversally characteristic of the earliest races of mankind, as it is\r\nstill distinctive of those savage races which are most nearly allied to\r\nprimitive man. These weapons were naturally simple in form and\r\nstructure. The earliest examples (Palaeolithic) found in river-drift\r\ngravel in various parts of Europe are merely chipped flints, celts, &c.\r\nLater on we find polished implements (Neolithic) progressively more\r\nelaborate in design and workmanship, such as socketed stones with wooden\r\nhandles and knives or daggers of flaked flint with handles. Besides\r\nflint the commonest materials are diorite, greenstone, serpentine and\r\nindurated clay-slate; there are also weapons of horn and bone (daggers\r\nand spear-heads). Spear-heads and arrow-points (leaf-shaped,\r\nlozenge-shaped, tanged and triangular) were chipped in flint with such\r\nskill as to be little inferior to their metal successors. They have\r\naccurately flaked barbs and tangs, and in some cases their edges are\r\nminutely chipped. The heads appear to have been fastened to the shafts\r\nby vegetable fibre and bitumen. Knife-daggers of flint, though\r\npractically of one single type, exhibit much variety of form. They vary\r\nin size also, but seldom exceed 12 in. in length. They are sometimes\r\nobtuse-edged like a scraping-tool, sometimes delicately chipped to a\r\nstraight edge, while the flakes are so regularly removed from the convex\r\npart of the blade as to give a wavy surface, and the corners of the\r\nhandle are delicately crimped. The daggers attain their highest\r\nperfection in the short, leaf-shaped form,--the precursor of the\r\nleaf-shaped sword which is peculiarly characteristic of the Bronze\r\nAge,--and the curved knives found especially in Great Britain and\r\nRussia, and also in Egypt. The precise object of the sharpening of both\r\nconvex and concave edges in the curved variety is not clear. There have\r\nalso been found sling-stones, and, in Scotland and Ireland, balls of\r\nstone with their \"surfaces divided into a number of more or less\r\nprojecting circles with channels between them.\" These latter, Sir John\r\nEvans suggests, were attached to a thong which passed through the\r\nsurface channels, and used like the _bolas_ of South America. The weapon\r\ncould thus deal a blow at close quarters, or could be thrown so as to\r\nentangle the limbs of an enemy. Of defensive armour of stone there is\r\nnone. The only approximation is to be found in the small rectangular\r\nplates of slate, &c., perforated with holes at the corners, which are\r\nsupposed to have been bound on to the arm to protect it from the recoil\r\nof the bow-string. Similar wristlets or bracers are in use among the\r\nEskimos (of bone) and in India (of ivory). These plates measure\r\ngenerally about 4 in. by 1-1/2 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Leaf-shaped Bronze Sword.]\r\n\r\n2. _Bronze Age._--It is impossible to assign any date as the beginning\r\nof the Bronze Age; indeed, archaeology has shown that the adoption of\r\nmetal for weapons was very gradual. The stone weapon perseveres\r\nalongside the bronze, and there exist stone axes which, by their shape,\r\nsuggest that they have been copied from metal axes. In the earliest\r\ninterments in which the weapons deposited with the dead are of other\r\nmaterials than stone, a peculiar form of bronze dagger occurs. It\r\nconsists of a well-finished, thin, knife-like blade, usually about 6 in.\r\nin length, broad at the hilt and tapering to the point, and attached to\r\nthe handle by massive rivets of bronze. It has been found associated\r\nwith stone celts; both of the roughly chipped and the highly polished\r\nkind, showing that these had not been entirely disused when bronze\r\nbecame available. A later type of bronze dagger is a broad, heavy,\r\ncurved weapon, usually from 9 to 15 in. in length, with massive rivets\r\nfor attachment to an equally massive handle. The leaf-shaped sword,\r\nhowever, is the characteristic weapon of the Bronze Age. It is found all\r\nover Europe, from Lapland to the Mediterranean. No warlike weapon of any\r\nperiod is more graceful in form or more beautifully finished. The finish\r\nseems to have been given in the mould without the aid of hammer or file,\r\nthe edge being formed by suddenly reducing the thickness of the metal,\r\nso as to produce a narrow border of extreme thinness along both sides\r\nof the blade from hilt to point. The handle-plate and blade were cast in\r\none piece, and the handle itself was formed by side plates of bone, horn\r\nor wood, riveted through the handle-plates. There was no guard, and the\r\nweapon, though short, was well balanced, but more fitted for stabbing\r\nand thrusting than for cutting with the edge. The Scandinavian variety\r\nis not so decidedly leaf-shaped, and is longer and heavier than the\r\ncommon British form; and instead of a handle-plate, it was furnished\r\nwith a tang on which a round, flat-topped handle was fastened, like that\r\nof the modern Highland dirk, sometimes surmounted by a crescent-like\r\nornament of bronze. A narrow, rapier-shaped variety, tapering from hilt\r\nto point, was made without a handle-plate, and attached to the hilt by\r\nrivets like the bronze daggers already mentioned. This form is more\r\ncommon in the British Isles than in Scandinavia, and is most abundant in\r\nIreland. The spear-heads of the Bronze Age present a considerable\r\nvariety of form, though the leaf-shaped predominates, and barbed\r\nexamples are extremely rare. Some British weapons of this form\r\noccasionally reach a length of 27 in. The larger varieties are often\r\nbeautifully designed, having segmental openings on both sides of the\r\ncentral ridge of the blade, and elaborately ornamented with chevron\r\npatterns of chased or inlaid work both on the socket and blade.\r\nArrow-points are much rarer in bronze than in flint. In all probability\r\nthe flint arrow-point (which was equally effective and much more easily\r\nreplaced when lost) continued to be used throughout the Bronze Age.\r\nShields of bronze, circular, with hammered-up bosses, concentric ridges\r\nand rows of studs, were held in the hand by a central handle underneath\r\nthe boss. The transition period between the Bronze and Iron Ages in\r\ncentral Europe is well defined by the occurrence of iron swords, which\r\nare simple copies of the leaf-shaped weapon, sometimes with flat\r\nhandle-plate of bronze.

The\r\nhilts are decorated with ivory, amber, wood, bronze, horn, and the\r\ndecoration of blade and scabbard is often elaborate. The length of these\r\nswords is sometimes as much as 30 to 33 in. Again at La Tene on Lake\r\nNeuchatel iron swords have been found to the number of one hundred, with\r\nhandles of 4 to 7-1/2 in. long and a total length varying from 30 to 38\r\nin. Similar remains have been found in France at Bibracte and Alesia,\r\nand even in Ireland (cf. Munro, _The Lake-dwellings of Europe_, pp. 282,\r\n383).\r\n\r\nThe occurrence at Hallstatt of bronze swords together with iron, having\r\nthe characteristic long handle, has led to the hypothesis that the\r\ngraves are those of an immigrant (probably Celtic) people of northern\r\nextraction which had conquered and overlaid a smaller-framed Bronze Age\r\npeople, and had introduced the use of iron while continuing to use the\r\nbronze of their predecessors with the necessary modifications. This\r\ntheory derived from tangible remains is corroborated by literary\r\nevidence. Thus Polybius (ii. 33, iii. 114) describes the Celtic peoples\r\nas fighting with a long pointless iron sword, which easily bent and was\r\nin any case too large to be used easily in a melee.\r\n\r\nThe graves at Hallstatt yielded in addition to these important swords a\r\nmuch larger number of spears. Of these two only were of bronze, the head\r\nof the larger being 7-1/2 in. long. The much more numerous iron heads\r\nrange up to as much as 2 ft. in length, and are all fastened to the\r\nshaft by rivets. All the arrow-heads found are of bronze, while of the\r\naxes the great majority are of iron; a few have iron edges fitted in a\r\nbed of bronze.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to show that the transition from bronze to\r\niron was very slow. The fact that they were found in a district which is\r\nknown to have been directly in the line of march pursued by invaders\r\nfrom the north tends to confirm the theory that the introduction of iron\r\nwas the work of such invaders.\r\n\r\n  See Sir John Evans, _Ancient Stone Implements_ (2nd. ed., 1897),\r\n  _Bronze Implements_; W. Ridgeway, _Early Age of Greece_; and works\r\n  quoted under ARCHAEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mycenaean and Homeric.\r\n\r\n3. _Early Greek Weapons._--The character of the weapons used by the\r\nearly peoples of the Aegean in the periods known as Minoan, Mycenaean\r\nand Homeric is a problem which has given rise of recent years to much\r\ndiscussion. The controversy is an important part of the Homeric question\r\nas a whole, and the various theories of the weapons used in the Trojan\r\nWar hinge on wider theories as to the date and authorship of the Homeric\r\npoems. One widely accepted hypothesis, based on the important monograph\r\nby Dr Wolfgang Reichel, _Uber homerische Waffen. Archaologische\r\nUntersuchungen_ (Vienna, 1894), is that the Homeric heroes, like those\r\nwho created the civilization known as Mycenaean, had no defensive armour\r\nexcept the Mycenaean shield, and used weapons of bronze. This view is\r\nderived to a great extent from the Homeric poems themselves, in which\r\nthe metal most frequently mentioned is [Greek: chalkos] (bronze), and\r\ninvolves the assumption that all passages which describe the use of\r\ncorslets, breastplates, small shields and greaves are later\r\ninterpolations. It is maintained on the other hand (e.g. by Prof. W.\r\nRidgeway, _Early Age of Greece_, i. chap. 3), that the Homeric Achaeans\r\n(whom he regards as the descendants of the central European peoples, the\r\nmakers of the Hallstatt iron swords) were far advanced into the Iron\r\nAge, and that the use of bronze weapons is merely another instance of\r\nthe fact that the introduction of a new element does not necessarily\r\nbanish the older. This theory would separate the Homeric from the\r\nMycenaean altogether, and is part of a much more comprehensive\r\nethnological hypothesis. According to another hypothesis, the Homeric\r\npoems are true descriptions of a single age, or, in other words, the\r\nweapons of the Homeric age were far more diverse and elaborate than is\r\nsupposed by Reichel.\r\n\r\nVery few traces of iron have been found in the Mycenaean settlements,\r\nnor have any examples of body armour been found except the ceremonial\r\ngold breastplates at Mycenae. The Mycenaean soldiers carried apparently\r\na bronze spear, a bronze sword and a bow and arrows. The arrow-heads are\r\nfirst of obsidian and later of bronze. It would appear that only the\r\nchief warriors used spear and shield, while the majority fought with\r\nbows. The swords found at Mycenae are two-edged, of rigid bronze, and as\r\nlong as 3 ft. or even more; from representations of battles it would\r\nseem that they were perhaps used for thrusting mainly. They are highly\r\nornamented and some have hilts of wood, bone or ivory, or even gold\r\nmounting. Later swords became shorter and of a type like that of early\r\niron swords found in Greece. Moreover in a few cases there have been\r\nfound in pre-Mycenaean (late Minoan III.) tombs a few examples of short\r\niron swords together with bronze remains. All Mycenaean spears are of\r\nbronze and, apparently, their shafts, unlike the Homeric, had no\r\nbutt-piece. In the absence of any metal helmets in the tombs we may\r\nperhaps assume that the Mycenaean helmet was a leather cap, possibly\r\nstrengthened with tusks, such as appears in Homer (_Iliad_, x.) also.\r\nThe Mycenaean shield (generally, perhaps, made of leather) has given\r\nrise to much controversy, which hinges largely on the interpretation of\r\nthe evidence provided by the representation on the Warrior Vase and the\r\nPainted Stele from Mycenae and pottery found at Tiryns. Professor\r\nRidgeway regards these as describing post-Mycenaean conditions, and\r\nmaintains that the true Mycenaean shield was always long (from neck to\r\nfeet), and that it was either in the form of a figure-of-eight targe, or\r\nrectangular and sometimes incurved like the section of a cylinder;\r\nwhereas the Homeric shield was round (e.g. [Greek: kukloteros,\r\neukuklos], &c.). Dr Reichel's followers believe that the Homeric shield\r\nwas long (\"like a tower\") and incurved in the centre like the\r\nMycenaean, that Homer knew nothing of the small round shield, and that\r\nthe epithets implying roundness used in the poems are to be explained as\r\nmeaning \"well-balanced\" or as late interpolations. On the whole we must\r\nconclude that the Mycenaean age is by no means a single homogeneous\r\nwhole (see AEGEAN CIVILIZATION), and that the weapons are not\r\nexclusively of bronze, nor of any single type.\r\n\r\nThe Homeric warrior in full armour, according to the Homeric poems,\r\nwore: (1) shield ([Greek: aspis, sakos]), (2) greaves ([Greek:\r\nknaemides]), (3) band ([Greek: zoma]), (4) belt ([Greek: zostaer])and\r\n_mitre_, (5) tunic ([Greek: chiton]), (6) helmet ([Greek: korus]), (7)\r\nbreastplate ([Greek: thorex]), (8) sword ([Greek: xiphos]). The [Greek:\r\nlaisaeion] was a protection worn by the archers in place of a shield.\r\nAccording to the usual view, the Homeric shield was, as we have seen,\r\nbent in about half way up each side (in the form of a figure-of-eight)\r\nto give freedom to the arms, and large enough to protect the whole body.\r\nThe two curves were held rigid by two Wooden (probably) staves inside.\r\nIt was composed of layers of ox-hide overlaid with bronze, forming a\r\nboss in the centre, and sometimes had studs upon it. Reichel's view is\r\nthat it was the weight of these huge shields which led to the use of the\r\nchariot as a means of going rapidly from one part of the field to\r\nanother (though Professor Ridgeway and others contest this, and Helbig\r\nmentions more than one case of long journeys on foot under shield), and\r\nfurther that the round shield is entirely unknown to Homer. This large\r\nshield was clearly the natural protection against showers of missiles,\r\nrather than against enemies fighting with the sword.\r\n\r\nThe greaves were, no doubt, generally of hide, protected the leg all\r\nround, and were fastened at the knee with cords. On the other hand\r\nMycenaean bronze greaves have been found at Enkomi (Cyprus) and at\r\nGlassinatz (Glasinac), and therefore it is not necessary, following\r\nReichel, to cut out Homer's references to the \"bronze-greaved\" Achaeans\r\n(_Iliad_, vii. 41), a phrase which has been taken as evidence for\r\nregarding the passage as spurious. The tin greaves of Achilles are\r\nobviously exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe _thorex_ again is the subject of controversy. Reichel, arguing that\r\nthe great shield rendered any breastplate unnecessary, regarded the word\r\nas a general term for body clothing, but Ridgeway strongly maintains the\r\nolder theory that it was a bronze breastplate, and Andrew Lang points\r\nout that, on Reichel's theory, a word which originally meant the\r\n\"breast\" was transferred to mean \"loin-cloth\" (which, to judge from the\r\nartistic representations, was all that the Mycenaean warrior wore), and\r\nsubsequently in historic times returned to its natural use for the\r\nbreastplate--a most unlikely evolution. The passages in Homer which\r\ndescribe it as a breastplate are regarded by Reichel's school as later\r\ninterpolations. Gilbert Murray thinks that the Homeric poems must be\r\nregarded as belonging to different periods of development, and therefore\r\nattributes the more elaborate armour to the \"surface\" (late Ionian)\r\nstratum. The _zoma_ was probably a loin-cloth, and the _mitre_ a metal\r\nband about a foot wide in front and narrow behind to protect the lower\r\npart of the body. As a matter of fact, however, the big shield does not\r\nexclude the use of body armour, and it is quite likely that the Homeric\r\nwarrior wore a bronze corslet, i.e. a somewhat improved form of the\r\n[Greek: linothorex], or stiffened shirt. On the other hand, it is\r\nprobable, as we gather from the poems, that this corslet was not strong\r\nenough to do more than stop a spent spear. The _chiton_ was worn over\r\nthe _mitre_, and reached the knees; it was held to the body by the\r\n_zoster_, a metal-plated belt. Helmets were both of metal on leather,\r\nand of leather throughout; the crests were of horsehair (not of metal\r\nlike the later Greek helmets) and there were no cheek-pieces.\r\n\r\nThe sword has already been mentioned. Ridgeway, in spite of the almost\r\ninvariable mention of bronze as the material of the Homeric weapons,\r\nbelieves that it was generally of iron, but, while the presence of iron\r\nin the Homeric age is admitted in the case of implements, it is\r\ngenerally held that weapons were all of bronze. Except for one\r\narrow-head (_Iliad_, iv. 123), and the mace of Areithous, mentioned as a\r\nunique example by Nestor (_Iliad_, vii. 141), no reference to an iron\r\nweapon proper occurs in the Homeric poems. But the sword was used only\r\nwhen the favourite spear or javelin had failed to decide the contest.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the problem of pre-Homeric armour and Homeric\r\narmour must always be largely a matter of inference, based on a\r\ncomparative study of the evidence literary and archaeological. Unless we\r\nare prepared to adopt the theory that the Homeric poems consist of a\r\nmosaic of interpolation informed by an archaizing editor, we must assume\r\nthat they describe a single period of transition intermediate between\r\nthe Mycenaean prime and the dawn of history proper. In this case we\r\nshall believe that the Homeric warrior has so far adapted to changing\r\nconditions the simple appliances of the Mycenaean that he has evolved a\r\nfeeble corslet with minor pieces of body armour, while retaining the big\r\ndouble-bellied shield as a protection against the arrows which are still\r\nthe chief weapon of the rank and file and are even used on occasion by\r\nthe chiefs. If we further believe that the iron at his disposal was\r\nsimilar to that used by the Celts of Polybius, it is natural to believe\r\nalso that he preferred the harder bronze for his weapons, though iron\r\nwas common for domestic and other implements.\r\n\r\n  On early Greek arms in general see, besides Reichel and Ridgeway _op.\r\n  cit._: A.

The hoplites, who formed the main army, wore helmet,\r\nbody armour, greaves and shield, and fought with pike and sword. The\r\nhelmets were (1) the Corinthian, which covered the face to the chin,\r\nwith slits for the eyes, and often had no plume or crest; (2) the\r\nAthenian, which did not cover the face (though sometimes it had\r\ncheek-plates which could be turned up if necessary), had crests,\r\nsometimes triple, with plumes of feathers, horsehair or leather; (3) a\r\nsteel cap ([Greek: pilos]) without crest, plumes or cheek-plates. The\r\nlast seems to have been most common in the Spartan army. The body armour\r\nconsisted of breast and back plates fastened together by thongs or\r\nstraps and buckles; sometimes poverty compelled a man to be content with\r\na leather jerkin ([Greek: spolas]) partly strengthened by metal plates,\r\nor even a quilted linen or stuffed shirt. Greaves were of pliant bronze\r\nfastened at the back above the ankle and below the knee. Shields were of\r\nthe small round or oval type, adapted to the new conditions in which the\r\nbow and arrow had given place to hand-to-hand fighting. They were held\r\nby means of two handles ([Greek: ochana]), the left hand being thrust\r\nthrough the first and grasping the second. In the 5th and 4th centuries\r\nthe shield bore a device or initial representing the state and also the\r\nindividual's own crest. The hoplite's pike, about 8 ft. long, unlike the\r\nHomeric weapon, was hardly ever thrown. In the Macedonian phalanx a pike\r\n([Greek: sarissa]), certainly 18 ft., and perhaps later in the 3rd and\r\nand 2nd centuries even 24 ft. long, was introduced. The sword was\r\nstraight, sharp-pointed, short, sometimes less than 20 in., and rarely\r\nmore than 2 ft. long. It was double-edged and used for both cut and\r\nthrust. A less common type was the [Greek: machaira] or curved sabre\r\nused by the Spartans, with one sharp edge. The hoplite had no other\r\noffensive weapons.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry were heavy-armed like the hoplites except that they carried\r\na smaller shield, or, more usually, none at all. They were armed with a\r\nlance which they wielded freely (i.e. not \"in rest\") and occasionally\r\nthrew. The Macedonian cavalry had a [Greek: sarissa]. The light-armed\r\n([Greek: gymnaetes, psiloi]) were (1) [Greek: akontistai], armed with a\r\njavelin (3 to 5 ft. long) and a small shield; (2) [Greek: toxotai],\r\narchers; and (3) [Greek: sphendonaetai], slingers, whose missiles were\r\nballs of lead, stones and hardened clay pellets. Between the heavy and\r\nthe light armed were the peltasts. The _pelta_, from which they took the\r\nname, was a light shield or target, made of skin or leather on a wooden\r\nor wickerwork frame. The Athenian Iphicrates armed them with linen\r\ncorslet and a larger spear and sword than those of the hoplites; he also\r\ninvented a new footgear (called after him _iphicratides_) to replace the\r\nolder greaves.\r\n\r\n5. _Roman._--The equipment of the Roman soldier, like the organization\r\nof the army (see ROMAN ARMY), passed through a great number of changes,\r\nand it is quite impossible to summarize it as a single subject. In the\r\nperiod of the kings the legion was the old Greek phalanx with Greek\r\narmour; the front ranks wore the Greek panoply and fought with long\r\nspears and the circular Argolic shield. The early Roman sword, like that\r\nof the Greeks, Egyptians and Etruscans, was of bronze. We have no direct\r\nstatement as to its form, but in all probability it was of the ordinary\r\nleaf-shape. We gather from the monuments that, in the 1st century B.C.,\r\nthe Roman sword was short, worn on the right side (except by officers,\r\nwho carried no shield), suspended from a shoulder-belt (_balteus_) or a\r\nwaist-belt (_cingulum_), and reaching from the hollow of the back to the\r\nmiddle of the thigh, thus representing a length of from 22 in. to 2 ft.\r\nThe blade was straight, double-edged, obtusely-pointed. On the Trajan\r\ncolumn (A.D. 114) it is considerably longer, and under the Flavian\r\nemperors the long, single-edged _spatha_ appears frequently along with\r\nthe short sword.\r\n\r\nThe second period ending with the Punic wars witnessed a change. The\r\n_hastati_ and the _principes_ are both heavily armed, but the round\r\nshield has given way to the oblong (_scutum_), except for one-third of\r\nthe _hastati_ who bore only the spear and the light javelin (_gaesa_).\r\nThe third period--that described by Polybius--is characterized by\r\ngreater complexity of armour, due no doubt in part to the experience\r\ngained in conflicts with a wider range of peoples, and in part to the\r\nassimilation of the methods peculiar to the new Italian allies. Thus we\r\nfind the skirmishers (_velites_) armed with a light javelin 3 ft. long\r\nand 3/4 in. thick, with an iron point 9 in. long; this point was so\r\nfragile that it was rendered useless by the first cast. For defence they\r\nwore a hide-covered headpiece and a round buckler 3 ft. in diameter. The\r\nheavy-armed carried a _scutum_ formed of two boards glued together,\r\ncovered with canvas and skin, and incurved into the shape of a\r\nhalf-cylinder; its upper and lower edges were strengthened with iron\r\nrims and its centre with a boss (_umbo_). A greave was worn on the right\r\nleg, and the helmet was of bronze with a crest of three feathers. The\r\nwealthier soldiers wore the full cuirass of chain armour (_lorica_), the\r\npoorer a brass plate 9 in. square. For offence they carried a sword and\r\ntwo javelins. The former was the Spanish weapon, straight, double-edged\r\nand pointed, for both thrust and cut, in place of the old Greek sword.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic weapon, however, was the _pilum_ (Gr. [Greek:\r\nussos]). The form of this weapon and the mode of using it have been\r\nminutely described by Polybius (vi. 23), but his description has been\r\nmuch misunderstood in consequence of the rarity of representations or\r\nremains of the _pilum_. It is shown on a monument of St Remy in\r\nProvence, assigned to the age of the first emperors, and in a bas-relief\r\nat Mainz, on the grave-stone of Quintus Petilius Secundus, a soldier of\r\nthe 15th legion. A specimen of the actual weapon is in the museum at\r\nWiesbaden. It is a javelin with a stout iron head (7 in.), carried on an\r\niron rod, about 20 in. in length, which terminates in a tang for\r\ninsertion in the wooden shaft. As represented on the monuments, the iron\r\npart of the weapon is about one-third of its entire length (6-3/4 ft.).\r\nIt was used primarily as a missile. When the point pierced the shield\r\nthe weight of the stave pulled the shield downwards and rendered it\r\nuseless. At close quarters it answered all the purposes, offensive and\r\ndefensive, of the modern bayonet when \"fixed.\" Vegetius, in his _Rei\r\nmilitaris instituta_, describes it in a modified form as used in the\r\narmies of the lower empire, and in a still more modified form it\r\nreappears as the \"argon\" of the Franks. This equipment was\r\ncharacteristic of _hastati, principes_ and _triarii_ (save that the\r\nlatter used the _hasta_ instead of the _pilum_). We thus see how great\r\nis the change from the time when the _hastati_ were the light-armed\r\n(from _hasta_) of the Greek phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry, which had originally been protected only by a light ox-hide\r\nshield and the most fragile spears, adopted, about Polybius's time, the\r\nfull Greek equipment of buckler, strong spear and breastplate.\r\n\r\nIn the last period of the republic the _pilum_ became the universal\r\nweapon of the heavy-armed, while the auxiliaries (all foreigners, the\r\n_velites_ having disappeared) used the _hasta_ and the long single-edged\r\nsword (_spatha_). Under the empire the heavy-armed, according to\r\nJosephus, had helmet, cuirass, a long sword worn on the left side, and a\r\ndagger on the right, _pilum_ and _scutum_. The special detachment\r\ndetailed to attend the commander had a round shield (_clipeus_) and a\r\nlong spear. The cavalry wore armour like that of the infantry, with a\r\nbroadsword, a buckler slung from the horse's side, a long pole for\r\nthrusting, and several javelins, almost as large as spears, in a sheath\r\nor quiver. Arrian, writing of a period some fifty years later, gives\r\nfurther particulars from which we gather that of the cavalry some were\r\nbowmen, some polemen, while others wielded lances and axes.\r\n\r\n  For the arms and armour of other peoples of antiquity see e.g. PERSIA:\r\n  _History, Ancient_, section v. \"The Persian Empire of the\r\n  Achaemenids\"; BRITAIN, _Anglo-Saxon_, section v. \"Warfare\"; ETRURIA;\r\n  EGYPT, &c.     (J. M. M.)\r\n\r\n6. _English from the Norman Conquest._--It is unnecessary here to trace\r\nin detail the history of European armour in the middle ages and after,\r\nbut its use and fashion in England may illustrate the broad lines of the\r\ngradual perfection and the hurried abandonment of the ancient\r\nwar-harness. Each country gave its armour something of the national\r\ncharacter, the Spanish harness being touched with the Moorish taste, the\r\nItalian with the classical note borrowed from the monuments of old time,\r\nand the German with the Teutonic feeling for the grotesque.\r\n\r\n[FIG. 4.--From the Bayeux Tapestry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  11th-century Bayeux tapestry.\r\n\r\nTo understand the development of English arms and armour it is well for\r\nus to consider carefully the fashion of these things at the time of that\r\nlandmark of history, the Norman Conquest. Poets, chroniclers and\r\nlaw-makers give us material for their description, and in the great\r\nembroidery of Bayeux, with its more than six hundred lively figures, we\r\nhave pictured all the circumstances of war. We find that weapons and war\r\ngear have advanced little or nothing beyond the age which saw the Dacian\r\nwarrior armed from crown to foot. A knight is reckoned fully armed if he\r\nhave helmet, hawberk and shield; his weapons are sword and lance,\r\nalthough he sometimes carries axe or mace and, more rarely, a bow. The\r\ncoat of fence, which the Norman called _hawberk_ and the English\r\n_byrnie_, hangs from neck to knee, the sleeves loose and covering the\r\nelbow only, the skirt slit before and behind for ease in the saddle. The\r\nBayeux artists (see fig. 4) commonly show these skirts as though they\r\nwere short breeches, the hawberk taking the fashion at first sight of a\r\nman's swimming dress, but other authorities set us right, and towards\r\nthe end of the tapestry we see men stripping hawberks from the slain by\r\npulling them over the head. Back and front are so much alike that he who\r\narmed Duke William for the fight slipped on the armour hind side before,\r\nan omen that he should change his state of a duke for that of a king.\r\nThe hawberk might be mail of woven rings, of rings sewn upon leather or\r\ncotton, of overlapping scales of leather, horn or iron, of that jazerant\r\nwork which was formed of little plates sewn to canvas or linen, or of\r\nthick cotton and old linen padded and quilted in lozenges, squares or\r\nlines. There are indications that the hawberk was sometimes reinforced\r\nat the breast probably by a small oblong plate fastened underneath. Its\r\nweight is shown in the scene where William's men carry arms to the\r\nships, each hawberk being borne between two men upon a pole thrust\r\nthrough the sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe helmet is a brimless and pointed cap, either all of metal or of\r\nleather or even wood framed and strengthened with metal. Its\r\ncharacteristic piece is the guard which protects the nose and brow from\r\nswinging cuts, so disguising the knight that William must needs take off\r\nhis helmet to show his men that he had not fallen. Such a nasal appears\r\nin a 10th-century illumination; at the time of the Conquest it was all\r\nbut universal. It grows rare and all but disappears in the 13th century,\r\nalthough examples are found to the end of the middle ages. The helmet is\r\nlaced under the chin, and under it the knight often wore a hood of mail\r\nor quilting which covered the top of the head, the ears and neck, but\r\nleft the chin free--in two or three cases he has this hood without the\r\nhelmet. A close coif was probably worn beneath it when it was of ringed\r\nmail, to spare the fretting of the metal on the head.\r\n\r\nThe knights' legs are shown in most cases as unprotected save by stout\r\nhose or leg-bands: only in two or three instances does the tapestry\r\npicture a warrior with armed legs, and it is perhaps significant of the\r\nrarity of this defence that the duke is so armed. The feet are covered\r\nonly by the leather boot, the heels having prick spurs.\r\n\r\nBroad-bladed swords with cross-hilts of straight or drooping quills are\r\nfastened with a strap and buckle girdle to the left side. They have a\r\nshort grip, and the blade would seem to be from 2-1/2 to 3 ft. in\r\nlength. The chieftain unarmed in his house is often seen with unbuckled\r\nand sheathed sword sceptre-wise in his hands, carrying it as an Indian\r\nraja will nurse his sheathed tulwar. The ash spears brandished or\r\ncouched by the knights as they charge seem from 7 to 8 or 9 ft. in\r\nlength. In a few cases a three-forked pennon flutters at the end. The\r\naxe, a weapon which the Normans, in spite of their Norse ancestry, do\r\nnot carry in the battle, is of the type called the Danish axe,\r\nlong-shafted, the large blade boldly curved out. Maces, such as that\r\nwith which the bishop of Bayeux rallies his young men, seem knotted\r\nclubs of simple form. Short and strong bows are drawn to the breast by\r\nthe Norman archers.\r\n\r\nOf the shields in the fight, four or five borne by the English are of\r\nthe old English form--large, round bucklers of linden-wood, bossed and\r\nribbed with iron. For the rest the horsemen bear the Norman shield,\r\nkite-shaped, with tapering foot, and long enough to carry a dead warrior\r\nfrom the field. On the inner side are straps for the hand to grip and a\r\nlong strap allowed the knight to hang the shield from his neck. Let us\r\nnote that although wyvern-like monsters, crosses, roundels and other\r\ndevices appear on these shields, none of them has any indication of true\r\narmory, whose origins must be placed in the next century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  12th Century.\r\n\r\nThe 12th century, although an age of riding and warring, affects but\r\nlittle the fashion of armour. The picture of a king on his seal may well\r\nstand for the full-armed knight of his age, but Henry Beauclerc, Stephen\r\nand Henry II. are shown in harness not much unlike that of the Bayeux\r\nneedlework. But the sleeve of the hawberk goes to the wrist, and the\r\nkite shield grows less, Stephen's shield being 30 in. long at the most.\r\nOn Stephen's second seal the mail hood is drawn over the point of the\r\nchin, and Henry II.'s seals show the chin covered to the lips. At least\r\none seal of this king has the legs and feet armed with hose of ringed\r\nmail, probably secured by lacing at the back of the leg as a modern boot\r\nis laced. The first seal of Richard Lionheart marks an important\r\nmovement. His hawberk, hood and hose clothe him, like his father, from\r\ncrown to toe, and to this equipment he adds gloves of mail. Under the\r\nhawberk flows out to the heels the skirt of a long gown slit in front.\r\nBut helm and shield are the most remarkable points. The shield has\r\nbecome flatter at the top, and at last the shield of an English king\r\nbears those armorial devices whose beginnings are seen elsewhere a\r\ngeneration before. The earlier seal has the shield with a rampant lion\r\nramping to the sinister side and closely resembling that on the shield\r\nof Philip of Alsace, long believed to be the earliest example of true\r\narmory. But the shield in the second seal bears the three leopards which\r\nhave been ever since the arms of the kings of England, and from this\r\ntime to the end of the middle ages armorial devices become the common\r\ndecorations of the knight's shield, coat, saddle and horse-trapper. The\r\nhelmet of the first seal is a high thimble-topped cap, without a nasal\r\nguard, but the second has the king's head covered with the great helm,\r\nbarrel-shaped and reinforced in front with a flat ventaile pierced in\r\nslits for the sight. This helm is crested with a semicircular ridge from\r\nwhich spring two wings, or rows of feathers fan-wise. On its side the\r\nridge bears a single leopard, the forerunner of the coming crests.\r\n\r\n\r\n  13th Century.\r\n\r\nFor 13th-century arms, although but poor scraps remain of original\r\nmaterial, we have authority in plenty--pictures, seals and carving, and,\r\nabove all, the effigies in stone or brass which give us each visible\r\nlink, strap and ornament. All these have for a commentary chronicles,\r\npoems and account books, so that the history of armour may be followed\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Knights' Armour, c. 1250.\r\n\r\nFrom _The Ancestor_, by permission of A Constable & Co. Ltd.]\r\n\r\nThe long, sleeveless surcoat seen over King John's mail on his broad\r\nseal goes through the century and is often embroidered with arms. The\r\nshield becomes flat-topped the better to receive armorial charges. The\r\ngreat helm is common, although many knights on the day of battle like\r\nbetter the freedom of the mail hood with a steel cap worn over or under\r\nits crown, keeping for the tourney-yard the great helm which towards the\r\ncentury-end begins to carry its towering crest. Great variety is seen in\r\nthe forms of the flat or round-topped helm, some being in one piece,\r\npierced for sight and air, others having hinged or movable ventailes. At\r\nthe end of the century a sugar-loaf type is the established form. The\r\nknight's hawberk is worn over a gambeson of linen, quilted linen or\r\ncotton, which lesser men wear with a steel cap for all defence. Breast\r\nand back plates also are sometimes borne under the hawberk, and the\r\nfirst plates in sight at last appear in those knee-cops which protect\r\nthe joining of the upper and lower hose, and in a few examples of\r\nbainbergs or greaves of metal or leather. At the end of Henry III.'s\r\nreign we have the admirable illustrations of a manuscript of Matthew\r\nParis's _Lives of the Offas_, with many pictures of knights. (See fig\r\n5.) Here we see knights with knee-cop and greave and a plenty of curious\r\nheadpieces, the plain mail hood and mail hoods with a plate ventaile to\r\ncover the face, barrel-helms and round-topped helms and even\r\nround-topped helmets with the Norman nose-guard.\r\n\r\nIn the last half of the 13th century appears the curious defence known\r\nas _alettes_. This name is given to a pair of leather plates generally\r\noblong in form and tagged to the back of the shoulder. As a rule they\r\nare borne to display the wearer's arms, but being sometimes plain they\r\nmay have had some slight defensive value, covering a weak spot at the\r\narmpit and turning a sweeping sword-cut at the neck. They disappear in\r\nthe earlier years of Edward III.\r\n\r\nSurcoat, shield and trapper have the arms of their owner. The rowel-spur\r\nmakes a rare appearance. Weapons change little. although the sword is\r\noften longer and heavier. Richard I. had favoured the cross-bow, in\r\nspite of papal denunciations of that weapon hateful to God, and its use\r\nis common through all the 13th century, after which it makes way for the\r\nnational weapon of the long-bow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  14th century.\r\n\r\nIn the 14th century, the high-day of chivalry, the age of Crecy and\r\nPoitiers, of the Black Prince and Chandos, the age which saw enrolled\r\nthe noble company of the Garter, the art of the armourer and\r\nweapon-smith strides forward. At its beginning we see many knights still\r\nclad in chain mail with no visible plate. At its end the knight is often\r\nlocked in plates from head to foot, no chainwork showing save the camail\r\nedge under the helm and the fringe of the mail skirt or hawberk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Brass of Sir John de Creke.\r\n\r\nFrom Waller's _Monumental Brasses._]\r\n\r\nBefore the first quarter of the 14th century is past many of these\r\nplates are in common use. Sir John de Creke's brass, about 1325-1330, is\r\na fair example (fig. 6). His helmet is a basinet, pointed at the top,\r\nprobably worn over a complete hood of mail flowing to the mid-breast.\r\nThis hood was soon to lose its crown, the later basinets having the\r\ncamail, a defence of mail covering neck, cheeks and chin and secured to\r\nthe basinet with eyelet holes and loops through which a lace was passed.\r\nA rerebrace of plate defends the outer side of the upper arm, plain\r\nelbow-cops the elbow, and round bosses in the form of leopard heads\r\nguard the shoulder and the crook of the elbow. The fore-arm is covered\r\nwith the plates of a vambrace which appears from under the hawberk\r\nsleeve. Large and decorated knee-cops cover the knees, ridged greaves\r\nthe shins, and the upper part of the foot from pointed toe to ankle is\r\nfenced with those articulated and overlapping plates the perfection of\r\nwhich in the next century enabled the full-harnessed knight to move his\r\nbody as freely as might an unarmed man. Under the plates the mail hose\r\nshow themselves and the heels have rowelled spurs. He has a hawberk of\r\nmail whose front skirt ends in a point between the knees, the loose\r\nsleeves between wrist and elbow. Under this is a haketon of some soft\r\nmaterial whose folds fall to a line above the height of the knee. Over\r\nthe hawberk is a garment, perhaps of leather with a dagged skirt-edge,\r\nand over this again is a sleeveless gambeson or pourpoint of leather or\r\nquilted work, studded and enriched. Over all is the sleeveless surcoat,\r\nthe skirt before cut squarely off at the height of the fork of the leg,\r\nthe skirt behind falling to below the knee. The loose folds of this\r\nsurcoat are gathered at the waist by a narrow belt, the sword hanging\r\nfrom a broader belt carried across the hip. Before 1350 the long surcoat\r\nof the 13th century was still further shortened, the tails being cut off\r\nsquarely with the front. The fate of Sir John Chandos, who in 1369\r\nstumbled on a slippery road, his long coat \"armed with his arms\"\r\nbecoming tangled with his legs, points to the fact that an old soldier\r\nmight cling to an old fashion.\r\n\r\nThe desire for a better defence than a steel cap and camail and a less\r\ncumbrous one than the great helm, in which the knight rode half stifled\r\nand half blind, brought in as a fighting headpiece the basinet with a\r\nmovable viser. This is found throughout this century, disappearing in\r\nthe next when the salet and its varieties displaced it. But there were\r\nmany knights who still fought with the great helm covering basinet and\r\ncamail, a fact which speaks eloquently of the mighty blows given in this\r\nwarlike age. The many monumental brasses of the last half of the 14th\r\ncentury show us for the most part knights in basinet and camail with the\r\nface exposed, but their heads are commonly pillowed on the great helm\r\nand in any case the viser would hinder the artist's desire to show the\r\nknight's features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Brass of Sir John de Foxley.\r\n\r\nFrom Waller's _Monumental Brasses_.]\r\n\r\nThe fully-armed man of the latter half of the 14th century seems to have\r\nworn a rounded breastplate and a back-plate over his chain hawberk.\r\nChaucer's Sir Thopas must always be cited for the defences of this age,\r\nthe hero wearing the quilted haketon next his shirt, and over that the\r\nhabergeon, a lesser hawberk of chain mail. His last defence is a fine\r\nhawberk \"full strong of plate\" showing that \"hawberk\" sometimes served\r\nas a word for the body plates. Over all this is the \"cote-armure\" or\r\nsurcoat. Many passages from the chroniclers show that the three coats of\r\nfence one over the other were in common use in the field, and Froissart\r\ntells a tale of a knight struck by a dart in such wise that the head\r\npierced through his plates, his coat of mail and his haketon stuffed\r\nwith twisted silk. The surcoat in the age of Edward III. became a scanty\r\ngarment sitting tightly to the body, laced up the back or sides, the\r\nclose skirts ending at the fork of the leg with a dagged or slittered\r\nedge. The waistbelt is rarely in sight, but the broad belt across the\r\nhips, on which the dagger comes to hang as a balance to the sword, grows\r\nricher and heavier, the best work of the goldsmith or silversmith being\r\nspent upon it. Arms and legs and feet become cased in plate of steel or\r\nstudded leather, and before the mid-century the shoulder-plates, like\r\nthe steel shoes, are of overlapping pieces and the elbow also moves\r\neasily under the same defence. (See fig. 7.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  15th century.\r\n\r\nSuch harness, ever growing more beautiful in its rich details, serves\r\nour champions until the beginning of the 15th century, when the fashion\r\nbegins to turn. The scanty surcoat tends to disappear. It may be that\r\nduring the bitter feuds and fierce slaughters of the Wars of the Roses\r\nmen were unwilling to display on their breasts the bearings by which\r\ntheir mortal foe might know them afar. The horseman's shield went with\r\nthe surcoat, its disuse hastened by the perfection of armour, and the\r\nbanners of leaders remained as the only armorial signs commonly seen in\r\nwar. But at jousts and tourneys, where personal distinction was eagerly\r\nsought, the loose tabard, which, after the middle of the century, bore\r\nthe arms of the wearer on back, front and both sleeves, was still to be\r\nseen, with the crest of parchment or leather towering above a helm whose\r\nmantle, from the ribbon-like strip of the early 13th century, had grown\r\ninto a fluttering cloak with wildly slittered edge streaming out behind\r\nthe charging knight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Brass of Sir John Lisle at Thruxton.]\r\n\r\nWhen a score of years of this 15th century had run we find the knight\r\nclosed in with plates, no edge of chain mail remaining in sight. The\r\nsurcoat being gone we see him armed in breast and back plate, his loins\r\ncovered by a skirt of \"tonlets,\" as the defence of overlapping\r\nhorizontal bands comes to be named (fig. 8). The chain camail has gone\r\nout of fashion, the basinet continuing itself with a chin and cheek\r\nplate which joins a gorget of plate covering the collar-bone, a movable\r\nviser shutting in the whole head with steel. The gussets of chain mail\r\nsewn into the leathern or fustian doublet worn below the body armour are\r\nunseen even at the gap at the hollow of the arm where the plates must be\r\nallowed to move freely, for a little plate, round, oval or oblong, is\r\ntagged to each side to fence the weak point. These plates often differ\r\nin size and shape one from the other, the sword-arm side carrying the\r\nsmaller one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Gothic Style of Armour. Monument of Count Otto\r\nIV. of Henneberg.]\r\n\r\nSoon after this the six or eight \"tonlets\" grow fewer, being continued\r\non the lower edge by the so-called tuilles, small plates strapped to the\r\ntonlets and swinging with the movement of the legs. A fine suit of\r\narmour is shown in the monument of Count Otto IV. of Henneberg (fig. 9).\r\nKnightly armour takes perhaps its last expression of perfection in such\r\na noble harness as that worn by Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick,\r\nwhose armed effigy was wrought between 1451 and 1454 (fig. 10). In this\r\nwe see the characteristic feature of the great elbow-cops, whose\r\nchannelled and fluted edges overlapping vambrace and rerebrace become\r\nmonstrous fan-like shapes in the brass of Richard Quartremayns, graven\r\nabout 1460. At this time the harness of the left shoulder is often\r\nnotably reinforced, as compared with that of the sword-arm shoulder.\r\nTowards the latter part of the century chain mail reappears as a skirt\r\nor breech of mail, showing itself under the diminished tonlets, and,\r\nwhen helm and gorget are removed, as a high-standing collar. The\r\narticulation by overlapping plates extends even to the breastplate,\r\nwhose front is thus in two or more pieces. Very long-necked rowel-spurs\r\nare often found, and the toes of the sabbatons or steel shoes are\r\nsharply pointed. The characteristic helmet of the latter half of the\r\ncentury is the salet or salade, a large steel cap, whose edge is carried\r\nout from the brows and still more boldly at the back of the neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Brass of Richard Beachamp, earl of Warwick.\r\n\r\nFrom Stothard's _Monumental Effigies_.]\r\n\r\nKnights abandon the great helm in war, but it is perfected for use in\r\nthe tilt-yard, taking for that purpose an enormous size, to enable two\r\ngood inches of stuffing to come between head or face and the steel\r\nplate. Such a helm sits well down on the shoulders, to which it is\r\nlocked before and behind by strong buckles or rivets. The note of the\r\n15th century in armour is that of fantastically elaborate forms boldly\r\noutlined and a splendour of colour which gained much from the custom of\r\nwearing over the full harness short cloaks or rich coats turned up with\r\nfurs, or from another fashion of covering the body plates or brigandines\r\nwith rich velvets studded with gold. The details of the harness take a\r\nthousand curious shapes, and even amongst the simpler jacks and steel\r\ncaps of the archers the same glorious variety is seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Meeting of Henry VIII. and Maximilian.\r\n\r\nFrom Hewitt's _Arms and Armour_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  16th century.\r\n\r\nIf the note of the 15th century be variety of form, that of the 16th\r\ncentury, the last important chapter in the history of armour, is surface\r\ndecoration, the harness of great folk atoning in some measure for loss\r\nof the beautiful medieval sense of line by elaborate enrichment. Plain\r\nengraving, niello, russet work, golden inlay and beaten ornament are\r\ncommon methods of enrichment. The great plume of ostrich feathers flows\r\nfrom the helmet crown of leaders in war. As in the reign of Edward III.,\r\ncostume's fashion affects the forms of armour, the broad toe of the\r\nHenry VIII. shoe being imitated in steel, as the wide fluted skirts of\r\nthe so-called Maximilian armour imitate the German fashion in civil\r\ndress which the Imperial host popularized through northern Europe (fig.\r\n11). These skirts have been called \"lamboys\" by modern writers on\r\nmilitary antiquities, but the word seems an antiquarianism of no value,\r\napparently a misreading of the word \"jambeis\" in some early document. So\r\nmany notable examples of the armour of this 16th century are accessible\r\nin European collections, other illustrations occurring in great plenty,\r\nthat its details call for little discussion; a fine and characteristic\r\nsuit is that by the famous English armourer, Jacob Topf (fig. 12), which\r\nbelonged to Sir Christopher Hatton. Into this century the arquebusier\r\nmarches, demanding a chief place in the line of battle, although it is a\r\ncommon error that the improvement in fire-arms drove out the fully armed\r\nwarrior, whose plates gave him no protection. Until the rifle came to\r\nthe soldier's hands, plate armour could easily be made shot-proof. It\r\nwas driven from the field by the new strategy which asked for long\r\nmarches and rapid movements of armies. This century's armour for the\r\ntilt-yard gives such protection to the champion, with its many\r\nreinforcing pieces, that unless the caged helm were used--the same which\r\ncost Henry II. of France his life--the risks of the tilt-yard must have\r\nfallen much below those of the polo-field. The horse with crinet,\r\nchafron and bards of steel was as well covered from harm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Suit by Jacob Topf, nearly complete, the gorget\r\ndoes not belong to it. Below is the placcate.]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the 16th century the full suit of war harness is an\r\nantique survival. Long boots take the place of greaves and steel shoes,\r\nand early in the 16th century the military pedants are heard to bewail\r\nthe common laying aside of other pieces. The mounted cavalier--cuirassier\r\nor pistolier--might take the field, even as late as the Great Rebellion,\r\narmed at all points save the backs of the thighs and the legs below the\r\nknee; but a combed and brimmed cap, breast and back plate and tassets\r\nequipped the pikeman, and the musketeer would march without any metal on\r\nhim save his headpiece, for it was soon found that heavily armed\r\nmusketeers, after a long trudge through summer dust or winter mud, were\r\nreadier to rest than to shoot. Everywhere there was revolt against the\r\nburden of plates, and as early as 1593 Sir Richard Hawkins found that his\r\nadventurers would not use even the light corslets provided by him,\r\n\"esteeming a pot of wine a better defence.\" Gervase Markham, in his\r\n_Souldier's Accidence_ of 1645, asks that at least the captain of\r\ncuirassiers should be armed \"at all peeces, cap a pee,\" but he would have\r\nfound few such captains, and Markham is a great praiser of noble old\r\ncustom. The famous figure of a pikeman of 1668 (fig. 13) in Elton's _Art\r\nMilitary_ has steel cap, corslet and tassets, but he stands for a fashion\r\ndead or dying. The last noteworthy helmet was what is now termed the\r\nlobster-tail helmet, a headpiece with round top, flat brim before, a\r\nbroad articulated brim behind, cheek-pieces hanging by straps and a grate\r\nof upright bars to cover the face, some having in place of the grate a\r\nmovable nose-guard to be raised or lowered at will. The close resemblance\r\nof this helmet to that worn by the Japanese, with whom the Dutch were\r\nthen trading, is worth remark, although each of the two pieces seems to\r\nhave had its separate origin. Thus, save for a steel cap here and a\r\ncorslet there, especially to be found amongst the guards of sovereigns\r\nwho must cling to something of antique tradition, armour departs out of\r\nthe civilized world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Pikeman.\r\n\r\nFrom _The Compleat Body of the Art Military_, by Lieut. Col. Elton\r\n(1668).]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Survival of armour.\r\n\r\nWhen in the reign of Queen Victoria her mounted guardsmen were given\r\nback their breast and back plates, the last piece of body armour had\r\nbeen the tiny gilt crescent worn at the throat by officers of foot,\r\nwhich crescent was the shrunken symbol of that great gorget of plate\r\nthat came in with the 13th century. The shining plates of the Guards are\r\nparade pieces only, but a curious revival of an old defence was carried\r\nby English cavalry in the field at the end of the 19th century, when\r\nsmall gussets of chain mail were attached to the shoulders of certain\r\ncavalrymen as a defence against sword cuts. Through all the age of\r\nmodern warfare inventors have pressed the claims of various bullet-proof\r\nbreastplates, but where they have been effective against rifle fire\r\ntheir weight has made them too heavy an addition to the soldier's\r\nburden. (See, however, ARMOUR PLATES, _ad fin_.) Last of all we may\r\nreckon those secret coats of mail which are said to be worn on occasion\r\nby modern rulers in dread of the assassin. The London detective\r\ndepartment has such coats of fence in its armoury; and on the other side\r\nit may be remembered that the Kelly gang of bushrangers, driven to bay,\r\nwere found to have forged suits of plate for themselves out of sheets of\r\nboiler-iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Collections.\r\n\r\nAncient arms and armour are now eagerly sought by European and American\r\ncollectors, and high prices are paid down for every noteworthy piece.\r\nThe supply is assisted by the efforts of many forgers of false pieces,\r\nthe most cunning of whom bring all archaeological skill to their aid,\r\nand few great national or private collections are free from some example\r\nof this industry. For the genuine pieces competition runs high. Suits of\r\nplate of the earliest period may be sought in vain, and the greatest\r\ncollectors may hardly hope for such a panoply of the late Gothic period\r\nas that which is the ornament of the Wallace collection. Even this\r\nfamous harness is not wholly free from suspicion of restoration. Armour\r\nof the latter half of the 16th century, however, often appears in the\r\nsale-rooms and is found in many private collections, although the\r\n\"ancestral armour\" which decorates so many ancient halls in England is\r\ngenerally the plates and pots which served the pikemen of the\r\n17th-century militia.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to understand this scarcity of ancient pieces. In the\r\nfirst place it must be remembered that the fully armed man was always a\r\nrare figure in war, and only the rich could engage in the costly follies\r\nof the later tournaments. The novelists have done much to encourage the\r\nbelief that most men of gentle rank rode to the wars lance in hand,\r\nlocked up in full harness of plate; but the country gentleman, serving\r\nas light horseman or mounted archer, would hold himself well armed had\r\nhe a quilted jack or brigandine and a basinet or salet. Men armed _cap a\r\npee_ crowd the illuminations of chronicle books, the artists having the\r\nsame tastes as the boy who decorates his Latin grammar with battles\r\nwhich are hand-to-hand conflicts of epauletted generals. Monuments and\r\nbrasses also show these fully armed men, but here again we must\r\nrecognize the tendency which made the last of the cheap miniaturists\r\nendow their clients lavishly with heavy watch-chains and rings. As late\r\nas the 18th century the portrait painters drew their military or naval\r\nsitters in the breastplates and pauldrons, vambraces and rerebraces of\r\nan earlier age. Ancient wills and inventories, save those of great folk\r\nor military adventurers, have scanty reference to complete harnesses.\r\nRinged hawberks, in a damp northern climate, will not survive long\r\nneglect, and many of them must have been cut in pieces for burnishers or\r\nfor the mail skirts and gussets attached to the later arming doublets.\r\nAs the fashion of plate armour changed, the smith might adapt an old\r\nharness to the new taste, but more often it would be cast aside. Men to\r\nwhom the sight of a steel coat called up the business of their daily\r\nlife wasted no sentimentality over an obsolete piece. The early\r\nantiquaries might have saved us many priceless things, but it was not\r\nuntil a few _virtuosi_ of the 18th century were taken with the Gothic\r\nfancy that popular archaeology dealt with aught but Greek statuary and\r\nRoman inscriptions. The 19th century was well advanced before an\r\ninterest in medieval antiquities became common amongst educated men, and\r\nfor most contemporaries of Dr Johnson a medieval helm was a barbarous\r\ncuriosity exciting the same measure of mild interest as does the Zulu\r\nknobkerry seen by us as we pass a pawnbroker's window. (O. Ba.)\r\n\r\n7. _Fire-arms._ (For the development of cannon, see ARTILLERY and\r\nORDNANCE.)--Hand-cannons appear almost simultaneously with the larger\r\n_bombards_. They were made by the Flemings in the 14th century. An early\r\ninstance of the use of hand fire-arms in England is the siege of\r\nHuntercombe Manor in 1375. These were simply small cannon, provided with\r\na stock of wood, and fired by the application of a match to the\r\ntouch-hole. During the 15th century the hand-gun was steadily improved,\r\nand its use became more general. Edward IV., landing in England in 1471\r\nto reconquer his throne, brought with him a force of Burgundian hand-gun\r\nmen (mercenaries), and in 1476 the Swiss at Morat had no less than 6000\r\nof their men thus armed. The prototype of the modern military weapon is\r\nthe _arquebus_ (q.v.), a form of which was afterwards called in England\r\nthe _caliver_. Various dates are given for the introduction of the\r\narquebus, which owed many of its details to the perfected crossbow which\r\nit superseded. The Spanish army in the Italian wars at the beginning of\r\nthe 16th century was the first to make full and effective use of the new\r\nweapon, and thus to make the fire action of infantry a serious factor in\r\nthe decision of battles. The Spaniards also took the next step in\r\nadvance. The _musket_ (q.v.) was heavier and more powerful than the\r\narquebus, and, in the hands of the duke of Alva's army in the\r\nNetherlands, so conclusively proved its superiority that it at once\r\nreplaced its rival in the armies of Europe. Both the arquebus and the\r\nmusket had a touch-hole on the right side of the barrel, with a pan for\r\nthe priming, with which a lighted quick match was brought in contact by\r\npressing a trigger. The musket, on account of its weight, was provided\r\nwith a long rest, forked in the upper part and furnished with a spike to\r\nstick in the ground. The _matchlock_ (long-barrelled matchlocks are\r\nstill used by various uncivilized peoples, notably in India) was the\r\ntypical weapon of the soldier for two centuries. The class of hand\r\nfire-arms provided with an arrangement for striking a spark to ignite\r\nthe powder charge begins with the _wheel-lock_. This lock was invented\r\nat Nuremberg in 1515, but was seldom applied to the arquebus and musket\r\non account of the costliness of its mechanism and the uncertainty of its\r\naction. The early forms of flint-lock (_snaphance_) were open to the\r\nsame objections, and the _fire-lock_ (as the flint-lock was usually\r\ncalled) remained for many years after its introduction the armament of\r\nspecial troops only, till about the beginning of the 18th century it\r\nfinally superseded the old matchlock. Thenceforward the fire-lock\r\n(called familiarly in England \"Brown Bess\") formed with the bayonet\r\n(q.v.) the armament of all infantry, and the fire-arms carried by other\r\ntroops were constructed on the same principle. Flint-lock muskets were\r\nsupplanted about 1830-1840 by the percussion musket, in which a\r\nfulminate cap was used. A Scottish clergyman, Alexander Forsyth,\r\ninvented this method of ignition in 1807, but it was not till 1820 that\r\nit began to come into general use. (See GUN.) The system of firing the\r\ncharge by a fulminate was followed by the invention of the needle-gun\r\n(q.v.). The muzzle-loading rifle, employed by special troops since about\r\n1800, came into general use in the armies of Europe about 1854-1860. It\r\nwas superseded, as a result of the success of the needle-gun in the war\r\nof 1866, by the breech-loading rifle, this in its turn giving way to the\r\nmagazine rifle about 1886-1890. (See RIFLE.) Neither breech-loaders nor\r\nrevolvers, however, are inventions of modern date. Both were known in\r\nGermany as early as the close of the 15th century. There are in the\r\nMusee d'Artillerie at Paris wheel-lock arquebuses of the 16th century\r\nwhich are breech-loaders; and there is, in the Tower armoury, a revolver\r\nwith the old matchlock, the date of which is about 1550. A German\r\narquebus of the 16th century, in the museum of Sigmaringen, is a\r\nrevolver of seven barrels. Nor is rifling a new thing in fire-arms, for\r\nthere was a rifled arquebus of the 15th century, in which the balls were\r\ndriven home by a mallet, and a patent was taken out in England for\r\nrifling in 1635. All these systems were thus known at an early period in\r\nthe history of fire-arms, but for want of the minutely accurate\r\nworkmanship required and, above all, of a satisfactory firing\r\narrangement, they were left in an undeveloped state until modern times.\r\nThe earliest pistols were merely shorter handguns, modified for mounted\r\nmen, and provided with a straight stock which was held against the\r\nbreastplate (poitrinal or petronel). The long-barrelled pistol was the\r\ntypical weapon of the cavalry of the 16th century. (See CAVALRY.) With\r\nthe revival of shock tactics initiated by Gustavus Adolphus the length\r\nof the pistol barrel became less and less, and its stock was then shaped\r\nfor the hand alone. (See PISTOL.)     (C. F. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTEAD, HENRY HUGH (1828-1905), English sculptor, was first trained as\r\na silversmith, and achieved the highest excellence with the \"St George's\r\nVase\" and the \"Outram Shield.\" He rose to the front rank among\r\ncontemporary sculptors, his chief works being the external sculptural\r\ndecorations of the colonial office in Whitehall, the sculptures on the\r\nsouthern and eastern sides of the podium of the Albert Memorial, the\r\nlarge fountain at King's College, Cambridge, and numerous effigies, such\r\nas \"Bishop Wilberforce\" at Winchester, and \"Lord John Thynne\" at\r\nWestminster, with smaller portraiture and much ideal work. His sense of\r\nstyle and nobility was remarkable; and he was besides gifted with a fine\r\npower of design and draughtsmanship, which he put to good use in his\r\nearly years for book illustration. He was elected associate of the Royal\r\nAcademy in 1875 and a full member in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG, ARCHIBALD (d. 1672), court jester, called \"Archy,\" was a\r\nnative of Scotland or of Cumberland, and according to tradition first\r\ndistinguished himself as a sheep-stealer; afterwards he entered the\r\nservice of James VI., with whom he became a favourite. When the king\r\nsucceeded to the English throne, Archy was appointed court jester. In\r\n1611 he was granted a pension of two shillings a day, and in 1617 he\r\naccompanied James on his visit to Scotland. His influence was\r\nconsiderable and he was greatly courted and flattered, but his success\r\nappears to have turned his head. He became presumptuous, insolent and\r\nmischievous, excited foolish jealousies between the king and Henry,\r\nprince of Wales, and was much disliked by the members of the court. In\r\n1623 he accompanied Prince Charles and Buckingham in their adventure\r\ninto Spain, where he was much caressed and favoured by the Spanish court\r\nand, according to his own account, was granted a pension. His conduct\r\nhere became more intolerable than ever. He rallied the infanta on the\r\ndefeat of the Armada and censured the conduct of the expedition to\r\nBuckingham's face. Buckingham declared he would have him hanged, to\r\nwhich the jester replied that \"dukes had often been hanged for insolence\r\nbut never fools for talking.\" On his return he gained some complimentary\r\nallusions from Ben Jonson by his attacks upon the Spanish marriage. He\r\nretained his post on the accession of Charles I., and accumulated a\r\nconsiderable fortune, including the grant by the king of 1000 acres in\r\nIreland. After the death of Buckingham in 1628, whom he declared \"the\r\ngreatest enemy of three kings,\" the principal object of his dislike and\r\nrude jests was Laud, whom he openly vilified and ridiculed. He\r\npronounced the following grace at Whitehall in Laud's presence: \"Great\r\npraise be given to God and little _laud_ to the devil,\" and after the\r\nnews of the rebellion in Scotland in 1637 he greeted Laud on his way to\r\nthe council chamber at Whitehall with: \"Who's fool now? Does not your\r\nGrace hear the news from Stirling about the liturgy?\" On Laud's\r\ncomplaint to the council, Archy was sentenced the same day \"to have his\r\ncoat pulled over his head and be discharged the king's service and\r\nbanished the king's court.\" He settled in London as a money-lender, and\r\nmany complaints were made to the privy council and House of Lords of his\r\nsharp practices. In 1641 on the occasion of Laud's arrest, he enjoyed a\r\nmean revenge by publishing _Archy's Dream; sometimes Jester to his\r\nMajestie, but exiled the Court by Canterburie's malice_. Subsequently he\r\nresided at Arthuret in Cumberland, according to some accounts his\r\nbirthplace, where he possessed an estate, and where he died in 1672, his\r\nburial taking place on the 1st of April. He was twice married, his\r\nsecond wife being Sybilla Bell. There is no record of any legal\r\noffspring, but the baptism of a \"base son\" of Archibald Armstrong is\r\nentered in the parish register of the 17th of December 1643. _A Banquet\r\nof Jests: A change of Cheare_, published about 1630, a collection\r\nchiefly of dull, stale jokes, is attributed to him, and with still less\r\nreason probably _A choice Banquet of Witty Jests ... Being an addition\r\nto Archee's Jests, taken out of his Closet but never published in his\r\nLifetime_ (1660).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG, JOHN (1709-1779), British physician and writer, was born\r\nabout 1709 at Castletown, Roxburghshire, where his father was parish\r\nminister. He graduated M.D. (1732) at Edinburgh University, and soon\r\nafterwards settled in London, where he paid more attention to literature\r\nthan to medicine. He was, in 1746, appointed one of the physicians to\r\nthe military hospital behind Buckingham House; and, in 1760, physician\r\nto the army in Germany, an appointment which he held till the peace of\r\n1763, when he retired on half-pay. For many years he was closely\r\nassociated with John Wilkes, but quarrelled with him in 1763. He died on\r\nthe 7th of September 1779. Armstrong's first publication, an anonymous\r\none, entitled _An Essay for Abridging the Study of Physic_ (1735), was a\r\nsatire on the ignorance of the apothecaries and medical men of his day.\r\nThis was followed two years after by the _Economy of Love_, a poem the\r\nindecency of which damaged his professional practice. In 1744 appeared\r\nhis _Art of Preserving Health_, a very successful didactic poem, and the\r\none production on which his literary reputation rests. His\r\n_Miscellanies_ (1770) contains some shorter poems displaying\r\nconsiderable humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG, JOHN (1738-1843), American soldier, diplomatist and political\r\nleader, born at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 25th of November 1758.\r\nHis father, also named John Armstrong (1725-1795), a native of the north\r\nof Ireland, who had emigrated to the Pennsylvania frontier between 1745\r\nand 1748, served successively as a brigadier-general in the Continental\r\narmy (1776-77), as brigadier-general and then major-general of the\r\nPennsylvania militia (1777-83), during the War of Independence, and was\r\na member of the Continental Congress in 1779-1780 and again in\r\n1787-1788. The son studied for a time at the College of New Jersey (now\r\nPrinceton University), and served as a major in the War of Independence.\r\nIn March 1783, while the Continental army was stationed at Newburgh\r\n(q.v.), New York, he wrote and issued, anonymously, the famous \"Newburgh\r\nAddresses.\" In 1784 he led a force of Pennsylvania militia against the\r\nConnecticut settlers in Wyoming Valley, and treated them in such a\r\nhigh-handed manner as to incur the disapproval even of the Pennsylvania\r\nlegislature. In 1789 he married the sister of Chancellor Robert R.\r\nLivingston of New York, and removed to New York city, where his own\r\nability and his family connexion gave him great political influence. In\r\n1801-2 and again in 1803-4 he was a member of the United States Senate.\r\nFrom 1804 to 1810 he was the United States minister to France, and in\r\nMarch 1806 he was joined with James Bowdoin as a special minister to\r\ntreat through France with Spain concerning the acquisition of Florida,\r\nSpanish spoliations of American commerce, and the \"Louisiana\" boundary.\r\nDuring the War of 1812, he was a brigadier-general in the United States\r\narmy from July 1812 until January 1813, and from then until August 1814\r\nsecretary of war in the cabinet of President Madison, when his\r\nunpopularity forced him to resign. \"In spite of Armstrong's services,\r\nabilities and experience,\" says Henry Adams, \"something in his character\r\nalways created distrust. He had every advantage of education, social and\r\npolitical connexion, ability and self-confidence; ... but he suffered\r\nfrom the reputation of indolence and intrigue.\" Nevertheless, he\r\n\"introduced into the army an energy wholly new,\" an energy the results\r\nof which were apparent \"for half a century.\" After his resignation he\r\nlived in retirement at Red Hook, New York, where he died on the 1st of\r\nApril 1843. He published _Notices of the War of 1812_ (2 vols., 1836;\r\nnew ed., 1840), the value of which is greatly impaired by its obvious\r\npartiality.\r\n\r\n  The best account of Armstrong's career as minister to France and as\r\n  secretary of war may be found in Henry Adams's _History of the United\r\n  States, 1801-1817_ (9 vols., New York, 1889-1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG, SAMUEL CHAPMAN (1839-1893), American soldier, philanthropist\r\nand educator, was born on Maui, one of the Hawaiian Islands, on the 30th\r\nof January 1839, his parents Richard and Clarissa Armstrong, being\r\nAmerican missionaries. He was educated at the Punahou school in\r\nHonolulu, at Oahu College, into which the Punahou school developed in\r\n1852, and at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he\r\ngraduated in 1862. He served in the Civil War, on the Union side, from\r\n1862 to 1865, rising in the volunteer service to the regular rank of\r\ncolonel and the brevet rank of brigadier-general, and, after December\r\n1863, acted as one of the officers of the coloured troops commanded by\r\nGeneral William Birney. In November 1865 he was honourably mustered out\r\nof the volunteer service. His experience as commander of negro troops\r\nhad added to his interest, always strong, in the negroes of the south,\r\nand in March 1866 he became superintendent of the Ninth District of\r\nVirginia, under the Freedman's Bureau, with headquarters near Fort\r\nMonroe. While in this position he became convinced that the only\r\npermanent solution of the manifold difficulties which the freedmen\r\nencountered lay in their moral and industrial education. He remained in\r\nthe educational department of the Bureau until this work came to an end\r\nin 1872; though five years earlier, at Hampton, Virginia, near Fort\r\nMonroe, he had founded, with the aid principally of the American\r\nMissionary Association, an industrial school for negroes, Hampton\r\nInstitute, which was formally opened in 1868, and at the head of which\r\nhe remained until his death, there, on the 11th of May 1893. After 1878\r\nIndians were also admitted to the Institute, and during the last fifteen\r\nyears of his life Armstrong took a deep interest in the \"Indian\r\nquestion.\" Much of his time after 1868 was spent in the Northern and\r\nEastern states, whither he went to raise funds for the Institute. See\r\n_Samuel Chapman Armstrong, a Biographical Study_ (New York, 1904), by\r\nhis daughter, Edith Armstrong Talbot.\r\n\r\nHis brother, WILLIAM N. ARMSTRONG, was attorney-general in the cabinet\r\nof the Hawaiian king Kalakaua I. He accompanied that monarch on a\r\nprolonged foreign tour in 1881, visiting Japan, China, Siam, India,\r\nEurope and the United States, and in 1904 published an amusing account\r\nof the journey, called _Round the World with a King_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG, WILLIAM GEORGE ARMSTRONG, BARON (1810-1900), British\r\ninventor, founder of the Elswick manufacturing works, was born on the\r\n26th of November 1810, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and was educated at a\r\nschool in Bishop Auckland. The profession which he adopted was that of a\r\nsolicitor, and from 1833 to 1847 he was engaged in active practice in\r\nNewcastle as a member of the firm of Donkin, Stable & Armstrong. His\r\nsympathies, however, were always with mechanical and scientific\r\npursuits, and several of his inventions date from a time anterior to his\r\nfinal abandonment of the law. In 1841-1843 he published several papers\r\non the electricity of effluent steam. This subject he was led to study\r\nby the experience of a colliery engineman, who noticed that he received\r\na sharp shock on exposing one hand to a jet of steam issuing from a\r\nboiler with which his other hand was in contact, and the inquiry was\r\nfollowed by the invention of the \"hydro-electric\" machine, a powerful\r\ngenerator of electricity, which was thought worthy of careful\r\ninvestigation by Faraday. The question of the utilization of water-power\r\nhad engaged his attention even earlier, and in 1839 he invented an\r\nimproved rotary water motor. Soon afterwards he designed a hydraulic\r\ncrane, which contained the germ of all the hydraulic machinery for which\r\nhe and Elswick were subsequently to become famous. This machine depended\r\nsimply on the pressure of water acting directly in a cylinder on a\r\npiston, which was connected with suitable multiplying gear. In the first\r\nexample, which was erected on the quay at Newcastle in 1846, the\r\nnecessary pressure was obtained from the ordinary water mains of the\r\ntown; but the merits and advantages of the device soon became widely\r\nappreciated, and a demand arose for the erection of cranes in positions\r\nwhere the pressure afforded by the mains was insufficient. Of course\r\npressure could always be obtained by the aid of special reservoirs, but\r\nto build these was not always desirable, or even practicable. Hence,\r\nwhen in 1850 a hydraulic installation was required for a new ferry\r\nstation at New Holland, on the Humber estuary, the absence of water\r\nmains of any kind, coupled with the prohibitive cost of a special\r\nreservoir owing to the character of the soil, impelled him to invent a\r\nfresh piece of apparatus, the \"accumulator,\" which consists of a large\r\ncylinder containing a piston that can be loaded to give any desired\r\npressure, the water being pumped in below it by a steam-engine or other\r\nprime mover. This simple device may be looked upon as the crown of the\r\nhydraulic system, since by its various modifications the installation of\r\nhydraulic power became possible in almost any situation. In particular,\r\nit was rendered practicable on board ship, and its application to the\r\nmanipulation of heavy naval guns and other purposes on warships was not\r\nthe least important of Armstrong's achievements.\r\n\r\nThe Elswick works were originally founded for the manufacture of this\r\nhydraulic machinery, but it was not long before they became the\r\nbirthplace of a revolution in gunmaking; indeed, could nothing more be\r\nplaced to Armstrong's credit than their establishment, his name would\r\nstill be worthy of remembrance. Modern artillery dates from about 1855,\r\nwhen Armstrong's first gun made its appearance. This weapon embodied all\r\nthe essential features which distinguish the ordnance of to-day from the\r\ncannon of the middle ages--it was built up of rings of metal shrunk upon\r\nan inner steel barrel; it was loaded at the breech; it was rifled; and\r\nit threw, not a round ball, but an elongated projectile with ogival\r\nhead. The guns constructed on this principle yielded such excellent\r\nresults, both in range and accuracy, that they were adopted by the\r\nBritish government in 1859, Armstrong himself being appointed engineer\r\nof rifled ordnance and receiving the honour of knighthood. At the same\r\ntime the Elswick Ordnance Company was formed to manufacture the guns\r\nunder the supervision of Armstrong, who, however, had no financial\r\ninterest in the concern; it was merged in the Elswick Engineering Works\r\nfour years later. Great Britain thus originated a principle of gun\r\nconstruction which has since been universally followed, and obtained an\r\narmament superior to that possessed by any other country at that time.\r\nBut while there was no doubt as to the shooting capacities of these\r\nguns, defects in the breech mechanism soon became equally patent, and in\r\na few years caused a reversion to muzzle-loading. Armstrong resigned his\r\nposition in 1863, and for seventeen years the government adhered to the\r\nolder method of loading, in spite of the improvements which experiment\r\nand research at Elswick and elsewhere had during that period produced in\r\nthe mechanism and performance of heavy guns. But at last Armstrong's\r\nresults could no longer be ignored; and wire-wound breech-loading guns\r\nwere received back into the service in 1880. The use of steel wire for\r\nthe construction of guns was one of Armstrong's early ideas. He\r\nperceived that to coil many turns of thin wire round an inner barrel was\r\na logical extension of the large hooped method already mentioned, and in\r\nconjunction with I.K. Brunel, was preparing to put the plan to practical\r\ntest when the discovery that it had already been patented caused him to\r\nabandon his intention, until about 1877. This incident well illustrates\r\nthe ground of his objection to the British system of patent law, which\r\nhe looked upon as calculated to stifle invention and impede progress;\r\nthe patentees in this case did not manage to make a practical success of\r\ntheir invention themselves, but the existence of prior patents was\r\nsufficient to turn him aside from a path which conducted him to valuable\r\nresults when afterwards, owing to the expiry of those patents, he was\r\nfree to pursue it as he pleased.\r\n\r\nLord Armstrong, who was raised to the peerage in 1887, was the author of\r\n_A Visit to Egypt_ (1873), and _Electric Movement in Air and Water_\r\n(1897), besides many professional papers. He died on the 27th of\r\nDecember 1900, at Rothbury, Northumberland. His title became extinct,\r\nbut his grand-nephew and heir, W.H.A.F. Watson-Armstrong (b. 1863), was\r\nin 1903 created Baron Armstrong of Bamburgh and Cragside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY (from Fr. _armee_, Lat. _armata_), a considerable body of men armed\r\nand organized for the purpose of warfare on land (Ger. _Armee_), or the\r\nwhole armed force at the disposal of a state or person for the same\r\npurpose (Ger. _Heer_ = host). The application of the term is sometimes\r\nrestricted to the permanent, active or regular forces of a state. The\r\nhistory of the development of the army systems of the world is dealt\r\nwith in this article in sections 1 to 38, being followed by sections 39\r\nto 59 on the characteristics of present-day armies. The remainder of the\r\narticle is devoted to sections on the history of the principal armies of\r\nEurope, and that of the United States. For the Japanese Army see JAPAN,\r\nand for the existing condition of the army in each country see under the\r\ncountry heading.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n1. _Early Armies._--It is only with the evolution of the specially\r\nmilitary function in a tribe or nation, expressed by the separation of a\r\nwarrior-class, that the history of armies (as now understood) commences.\r\nNumerous savage tribes of the present day possess military organizations\r\nbased on this system, but it first appears in the history of\r\ncivilization amongst the Egyptians. By the earliest laws of Egypt,\r\nprovision was made for the support of the warriors. The exploits of her\r\narmies under the legendary Sesostris cannot be regarded as historical,\r\nbut it appears certain that the country possessed an army, capable of\r\nwaging war in a regular fashion, and divided thus early into separate\r\narms, these being chariots, infantry and archers. The systems of the\r\nAssyrians and Babylonians present no particular features of interest,\r\nsave that horsemen, as distinct from charioteers, appear on the scene.\r\nThe first historical instance of a military organization resembling\r\nthose of modern times is that of the Persian empire.\r\n\r\n2. _Persia._--Drawn from a hardy and nomadic race, the armies of Persia\r\nat first consisted mainly of cavalry, and owed much of their success to\r\nthe consequent ease and rapidity of their movements. The warlike\r\nPersians constantly extended their power by fresh conquests, and for\r\nsome time remained a distinctly conquering and military race, attaining\r\ntheir highest power under Cyrus and Cambyses. Cyrus seems to have been\r\nthe founder of a comprehensive military organization, of which we gather\r\ndetails from Xenophon and other writers. To each province was allotted a\r\ncertain number of soldiers as standing army. These troops, formed\r\noriginally of native Persians only, were called the king's troops. They\r\ncomprised two classes, the one devoted exclusively to garrisoning towns\r\nand castles, the other distributed throughout the country. To each\r\nprovince was appointed a military commander, responsible for the number\r\nand efficiency of the troops in his district, while the civil governor\r\nwas answerable for their subsistence and pay. Annual musters were held,\r\neither by the king in person or by generals deputed for the purpose and\r\ninvested with full powers. This organization seems to have fully\r\nanswered its original purpose, that of holding a vast empire acquired by\r\nconquest and promptly repelling inroads or putting down insurrections.\r\nBut when a great foreign war was contemplated, the standing army was\r\naugmented by a levy throughout the empire. The extent of the empire made\r\nsuch a levy a matter of time, and the heterogeneous and unorganized mass\r\nof men of all nations so brought together was a source of weakness\r\nrather than strength. Indeed, the vast hosts over which the Greeks\r\ngained their victories comprised but a small proportion of the true\r\nPersians. The cavalry alone seems to have retained its national\r\ncharacter, and with it something of its high reputation, even to the\r\ndays of Alexander.\r\n\r\n3. _Greece._--The Homeric armies were tribal levies of foot, armed with\r\nspear, sword, bow, &c., and commanded by the chiefs in their\r\nwar-chariots. In historic times all this is changed. Greece becomes a\r\ncongeries of city-states, each with its own citizen-militia. Federal\r\narmies and permanent troops are rare, the former owing to the\r\ncentrifugal tendency of Greek politics, the latter because the\r\n\"tyrannies,\" which must have relied very largely on standing armies to\r\nmaintain themselves, had ultimately given way to democratic\r\ninstitutions. But the citizen-militia of Athens or Sparta resembled\r\nrather a modern \"nation in arms\" than an auxiliary force. Service was\r\ncompulsory in almost all states, and as the young men began their career\r\nas soldiers with a continuous training of two or three years, Hellenic\r\narmies, like those of modern Europe, consisted of men who had undergone\r\na thorough initial training and were subsequently called up as required.\r\nCavalry, as always in the broken country of the Peloponnesus, was not of\r\ngreat importance, and it is only when the theatre of Greek history is\r\nextended to the plains of Thessaly that the mounted men become numerous.\r\nIn the 4th century the mainstay of Greek armies was the _hoplite_\r\n([Greek: hoplitaes]), the heavy-armed infantryman who fought in the\r\n_corps de bataille_; the light troops were men who could not provide the\r\nfull equipment of the hoplite, rather than soldiers trained for certain\r\nspecial duties such as skirmishing. The fighting formation was that of\r\nthe _phalanx_, a solid corps of hoplites armed with long spears. The\r\narmies were recruited for each war by calling up one or more classes of\r\nmen in reserve according to age. It was the duty and privilege of the\r\nfree citizen to bear arms; the slaves were rarely trusted with weapons.\r\n\r\n4. _Sparta._--So much is common to the various states. In Sparta the\r\nidea of the nation in arms was more thoroughly carried out than in any\r\nother state in the history of civilization. In other states the\r\nindividual citizen often lived the life of a soldier, here the nation\r\nlived the life of a regiment. Private homes resembled the \"married\r\nquarters\" of a modern army; the unmarried men lived entirely in\r\nbarracks. Military exercises were only interrupted by actual service in\r\nthe field, and the whole life of a man of military age was devoted to\r\nthem. Under these circumstances, the Spartans maintained a practically\r\nunchallenged supremacy over the armies of other Greek states; sometimes\r\ntheir superiority was so great that, like the Spanish regulars in the\r\nearly part of the Dutch War of Independence, they destroyed their\r\nenemies with insignificant loss to themselves. The surrender of a\r\nSpartan detachment, hopelessly cut off from all assistance, and the\r\nvictory of a body of well-trained and handy light infantry over a closed\r\nbattalion of Spartiates were events so unusual as seriously to affect\r\nthe course of Greek history.\r\n\r\n5. _Greek Mercenaries._--The military system of the 4th century was not\r\ncalled upon to provide armies for continuous service on distant\r\nexpeditions. When, after the earlier campaigns of the Peloponnesian War,\r\nthe necessity for such expeditions arose, the system was often strained\r\nalmost to breaking point, (e.g. in the case of the Athenian expedition\r\nto Syracuse), and ultimately the states of Greece were driven to choose\r\nbetween unprofitable expenditure of the lives of citizens and recruiting\r\nfrom other sources. Mercenaries serving as light troops, and\r\nparticularly as _peltasts_ (a new form of disciplined \"light infantry\")\r\nsoon appeared. The _corps de bataille_ remained for long the old phalanx\r\nof citizen hoplites. But the heavy losses of many years told severely on\r\nthe resources of every state, and ultimately non-national\r\nrecruits--adventurers and soldiers of fortune, broken men who had lost\r\ntheir possessions in the wars, political refugees, runaway slaves,\r\n&c.--found their way even into the ranks of the hoplites, and Athens at\r\none great crisis (407) enlisted slaves, with the promise of citizenship\r\nas their reward. The Arcadians, like the Scots and the Swiss in modern\r\nhistory, furnished the most numerous contingent to the new professional\r\narmies. A truly national army was indeed to appear once more in the\r\nhistory of the Peloponnesus, but in the meantime the professional\r\nsoldier held the field. The old bond of strict citizenship once broken,\r\nthe career of the soldier of fortune was open to the adventurous Greek.\r\nTaenarum and Corinth became regular _entrepots_ for mercenaries. The\r\nyounger Cyrus raised his army for the invasion of Persia precisely as\r\nthe emperors Maximilian and Charles V. raised regiments of\r\n_Landsknechte_--by the issue of recruiting commissions to captains of\r\nreputation. This army became the famous Ten Thousand. It was a marching\r\ncity-state, its members not desperate adventurers, but men with the calm\r\nself-respect of Greek civilization. On the fall of its generals, it\r\nchose the best officers of the army to command, and obeyed implicitly.\r\nCheirisophus the Spartan and Xenophon the Athenian, whom they chose,\r\nwere not plausible demagogues; they were line officers, who, suddenly\r\npromoted to the chief command under circumstances of almost overwhelming\r\ndifficulty, proved capable of achieving the impossible. The merit of\r\nchoosing such leaders is not the least title to fame of the Ten Thousand\r\nmercenary Greek hoplites. About the same time Iphicrates with a body of\r\nmercenary _peltasts_ destroyed a _mora_ or corps of Spartan hoplites\r\n(391 B.C.).\r\n\r\n6. _Epaminondas._--Not many years after this, Spartan oppression roused\r\nthe Theban revolt, and the Theban revolt became the Theban hegemony. The\r\narmy which achieved this under the leadership of Epaminondas, one of the\r\ngreat captains of history, had already given proofs of its valour\r\nagainst Xenophon and the Cyreian veterans. Still earlier it had won the\r\ngreat victory of Delium (424 B.C.).\r\n\r\nIt was organized, as were the professional armies, on the accepted model\r\nof the old armies, viz. the phalangite order, but the addition of\r\npeltasts now made a Theban army, unlike the Spartans, capable of\r\noperating in broken country as well as in the plain. The new tactics of\r\nthe phalanx, introduced by Epaminondas, embodied, for the first time in\r\nthe history of war, the modern principle of local superiority of force,\r\nand suggested to Frederick the Great the famous \"oblique order of\r\nbattle.\" Further, the cavalry was more numerous and better led than that\r\nof Peloponnesian states. The professional armies had well understood the\r\nmanagement of cavalry; Xenophon's handbook of the subject is not without\r\nvalue in the 20th century. In Greek armies the dearth of horses and the\r\nconsequent numerical weakness of the cavalry prevented the bold use of\r\nthe arm on the battlefield (see CAVALRY). But Thebes had always to deal\r\nwith nations which possessed numerous horsemen. Jason of Pherae, for\r\ninstance, put into the field against Thebes many thousands of Thessalian\r\nhorse; and thus at the battle of Tegyra in 375 the Theban cavalry under\r\nPelopidas, aided by the _corps d'elite_ of infantry called the Sacred\r\nBand, carried all before them. At Leuctra Epaminondas won a glorious\r\nvictory by the use of his \"oblique order\" tactics; the same methods\r\nachieved the second great victory of Mantineia (362 B.c.) at which\r\nEpaminondas fell. Pelopidas had already been slain in a battle against\r\nthe Thessalians, and there was no leader to carry on their work. But the\r\nnew Greek system was yet to gain its greatest triumphs under Alexander\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\n7. _Alexander._--The reforms of Alexander's father, Philip of Macedon,\r\nmay most justly be compared to those of Frederick William I. in Prussia.\r\nPhilip had lived at Thebes as a hostage, and had known Iphicrates,\r\nEpaminondas and Pelopidas. He grafted the Theban system of tactics on to\r\nthe Macedonian system of organization. That the latter--a complete\r\nterritorial system--was efficient was shown by the fact that Philip's\r\nblow was always struck before his enemies were ready to meet it. That\r\nthe new Greek tactics, properly used, were superior to the old was once\r\nmore demonstrated at Chaeronea (338 B.C.), where the Macedonian infantry\r\nmilitia fought in phalanx, and the cavalry, led by the young Alexander,\r\ndelivered the last crushing blow. On his accession, like Frederick the\r\nGreat, Alexander inherited a well-trained and numerous army, and was not\r\nslow to use it. The invasion of Asia was carried out by an army of the\r\nGreek pattern, formed both of Hellenes and of non-Hellenes on an\r\nexceedingly strong Macedonian nucleus. Alexander's own guard was\r\ncomposed of picked horse and foot. The infantry of the line comprised\r\nMacedonian and Greek hoplites, the Macedonians being subdivided into\r\nheavy and medium troops. These fought in a grand phalanx, which was\r\nsubdivided into units corresponding to the modern divisions, brigades\r\nand regiments, the fighting formation being normally a line of battalion\r\nmasses. The arm of the infantry was the 18-foot pike (_sarissa_). The\r\npeltasts, Macedonian and Greek, were numerous and well trained, and\r\nthere was the usual mass of irregular light troops, bowmen, slingers,\r\n&c. The cavalry included the Guard ([Greek: agaema]), a body of heavy\r\ncavalry composed of chosen Macedonians, the line cavalry of Macedonia\r\n([Greek: hetairoi]) and Thessaly, the numerous small contingents of the\r\nGreek states, mercenary corps and light lancers for outpost work. The\r\nfinal blow and the gathering of the fruits of victory were now for the\r\nfirst time the work of the mounted arm. The solid phalanx was almost\r\nunbreakable in the earlier stages of the battle, but after a long\r\ninfantry fight the horsemen had their chance. In former wars they were\r\ntoo few and too poorly mounted to avail themselves of it, and decisive\r\nvictories were in consequence rarely achieved in battles of Greek versus\r\nGreek. Under Epaminondas, and still more under Philip and Alexander, the\r\ncavalry was strong enough for its new work. Battles are now ended by the\r\nshock action of mounted men, and in Alexander's time it is noted as a\r\nnovelty that the cavalry carried out the pursuit of a beaten army. There\r\nwere further, in Alexander's army, artillerymen with a battering train,\r\nengineers and departmental troops, and also a medical service, an\r\nimprovement attributed to Jason of Pherae. The victories of this army,\r\nin close order and in open, over every kind of enemy and on every sort\r\nof terrain, produced the Hellenistic world, and in that achievement the\r\nhistory of Greek armies closes, for after the return of the greater part\r\nof the Europeans to their homes the armies of Alexander and his\r\nsuccessors, while preserving much of the old form, become more and more\r\norientalized.\r\n\r\nThe decisive step was taken in 323, when a picked contingent of\r\nPersians, armed mainly with missile weapons, was drafted into the\r\nphalanx, in which henceforward they formed the middle ranks of each file\r\nof sixteen men. But, like the third rank of Prussian infantry up to\r\n1888, they normally fought as skirmishers in advance, falling into their\r\nplace behind the pikes of the Macedonian file-leaders only if required\r\nfor the decisive assault. The new method, of course, depended for\r\nsuccess on the steadiness of the thin three-deep line of Macedonians\r\nthus left as the line of battle. Alexander's veterans were indeed to be\r\ntrusted, but as time went on, and little by little the war-trained\r\nGreeks left the service, it became less and less safe to array the\r\nHellenistic army in this shallow and articulated order of battle. The\r\npurely formal organization of the phalanx sixteen deep became thus the\r\nactual tactical formation, and around this solid mass of 16,384 men\r\ngathered the heterogeneous levies of a typical oriental army. Pyrrhus,\r\nking of Epirus, retained far more of the tradition of Alexander's system\r\nthan his contemporaries farther east, yet his phalanx, comparatively\r\nlight and mobile as it was, achieved victories over the Roman legion\r\nonly at the cost of self-destruction. Even elephants quickly became a\r\nnecessary adjunct to Hellenistic armies.\r\n\r\n8. _Carthage._--The military systems of the Jews present few features of\r\nunusual interest. The expedient of calling out successive contingents\r\nfrom the different tribes, in order to ensure continuity in military\r\noperations, should, however, be noticed. David and Solomon possessed\r\nnumerous permanent troops which served as guards and garrisons; in\r\nprinciple this organization was identical with that of the Persians, and\r\nthat of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Particular interest\r\nattaches to the Carthaginian military forces of the 3rd century B.C.\r\nRarely has any army achieved such renown in the short space of sixty\r\nyears (264-202 B.C.). Carthage produced a series of great generals,\r\nculminating in Hannibal, who is marked out, even by the little that is\r\nknown of him, as the equal of Napoleon. But Napoleon was supported by a\r\nnational army, Hannibal and his predecessors were condemned to work with\r\narmies of mercenaries. For the first time in the world's history war is\r\na matter with which the civil population has no concern. The merchants\r\nof Carthage fought only in the last extremity; the wars in which their\r\nmarkets were extended were conducted by non-national forces and directed\r\nby the few Carthaginian citizens who possessed military aptitudes. The\r\ncivil authorities displayed towards their instruments a spirit of hatred\r\nfor which it is difficult to find a parallel. Unsuccessful leaders were\r\ncrucified, the mercenary soldiers were cheated of their pay, and broke\r\nout into a mutiny which shook the empire of Carthage to its foundations.\r\nBut the magnetism of a leader's personality infused a corporate military\r\nspirit into these heterogeneous Punic armies, and history has never\r\nwitnessed so complete an illustration of the power of pure and unaided\r\n_esprit de corps_ as in the case of Hannibal's army in Italy, which,\r\ncomposed as it was of Spaniards, Africans, Gauls, Numidians, Italians\r\nand soldiers of fortune of every country, was yet welded by him into\r\nthorough efficiency. The army of Italy was as great in its last fight at\r\nZama as the army of Spain at Rocroi; its victories of the Trebia,\r\nTrasimene and Cannae were so appalling that, two hundred years later,\r\nthe leader to whom these soldiers devoted their lives was still, to a\r\nRoman, the \"dire\" Hannibal.\r\n\r\nIn their formal organization the Carthaginian armies resembled the new\r\nGreek model, and indeed they were created in the first instance by\r\nXanthippus, a Spartan soldier in the service of Carthage, who was called\r\nupon to raise and train an army when the Romans were actually at the\r\ngates of Carthage, and justified his methods in the brilliant victory of\r\nTunis (255 B.C.). For the solid Macedonian phalanx of 16,000 spears\r\nXanthippus substituted a line of heavy battalions equal in its aggregate\r\npower of resistance to the older form, and far more flexible. The\r\ntriumphs of the cavalry arm in Hannibal's battles far excelled those of\r\nAlexander's horsemen. Hannibal chose his fighting ground whenever\r\npossible with a view to using their full power, first to defeat the\r\nhostile cavalry, then to ride down the shaken infantry masses, and\r\nfinally to pursue _au fond_. At Cannae, the greatest disaster ever\r\nsuffered by the Romans, the decisive blow and the slaughter were the\r\nwork of Hannibal's line cavalry, the relentless pursuit that of his\r\nlight horse. But a professional long-service army has always the\r\ngreatest difficulty in making good its losses, and in the present case\r\nit was wholly unable to do so. Even Hannibal failed at last before the\r\nsustained efforts of the citizen army of Rome.\r\n\r\n9. _Roman Army under the Republic._--The earliest organization of the\r\nRoman army is attributed to Romulus, who formed it on the tribal\r\nprinciple, each of the three tribes contributing its contingent of horse\r\nand foot. But it was to Servius Tullius that Rome owed, traditionally,\r\nthe complete classification of her citizen-soldiers. For the details of\r\nthe Roman military system, see ROMAN ARMY. During the earlier period of\r\nRoman history the army was drawn entirely from the first classes of the\r\npopulation, who served without pay and provided their own arms and\r\narmour. The wealthiest men (_equites_) furnished the cavalry, the\r\nremainder the infantry, while the poorer classes either fought as light\r\ntroops or escaped altogether the privilege and burden of military\r\nservice. Each \"legion\" of 3000 heavy foot was at first formed in a solid\r\nphalanx. The introduction of the elastic and handy three-line formation\r\nwith intervals (similar in many respects to Alexander's) was brought\r\nabout by the Gallic wars, and is attributed to M. Furius Camillus, who\r\nalso, during the siege of Veii, introduced the practice of paying the\r\nsoldiers, and thus removed the chief obstacle to the employment of the\r\npoorer classes. The new order of battle was fully developed in the\r\nPyrrhic Wars, and the typical army of the Republic may be taken as\r\ndating from the latter part of the 3rd century B.C. The legionary was\r\nstill possessed of a property qualification, but it had become\r\nrelatively small. An annual levy was made at Rome to provide for the\r\ncampaign of the year. Discipline was severe, and the rewards appealed as\r\nmuch to the soldier's honour as to his desire of gain. A legion now\r\nconsisted of three lines (_Hastati, Principes, Triarii_), each line\r\ncomposed of men of similar age and experience, and was further\r\nsubdivided into thirty \"maniples,\" each of two \"centuries.\" The normal\r\nestablishment of 300 cavalry, 3000 heavy and 1200 light infantry was\r\nstill maintained, though in practice these figures were often exceeded.\r\nIn place of the old light-armed and somewhat inferior _rorarii_, the new\r\n_velites_ performed light infantry duties (211 B.C.), at the same time\r\nretaining their place in the maniples, of which they formed the last\r\nranks (compare the Macedonian phalanx as reorganized in 323, S 7 above).\r\nThe 300 cavalry of the legion were trained for shock action. But the\r\nstrength of the Roman army lay in the heavy legionary infantry of\r\ncitizens. The thirty maniples of each legion stood in three lines of\r\nbattle, but the most notable point of their formation was that each\r\nmaniple stood by itself on its own small manoeuvre-area, free to take\r\nground to front or flank. To the Roman legion was added a legion of\r\nallies, somewhat differently organized and possessing more cavalry, and\r\nthe whole force was called a \"double legion\" or briefly a \"legion.\" A\r\nconsul's army consisted nominally of two double legions, but in the\r\nPunic wars military exigencies rather than custom dictated the numbers\r\nof the army, and the two consuls at Cannae (216 B.C.) commanded two\r\ndouble consular armies, or eight double legions.\r\n\r\n10. _Characteristics of the Roman Army._--Such in outline was the Roman\r\nmilitary organization at the time when it was put to the severe test of\r\nthe Second Punic War. Its elements were good, its military skill\r\nsuperior to that of any other army of ancient history, while its\r\norganization was on the whole far better than any that had gone before.\r\nThe handy formation of maniples at open order was unique in the ancient\r\nworld, and it did not reappear in history up to the advent of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus. In this formation, in which everything was entrusted to the\r\nskill of subordinates and the individual courage of the rank and file,\r\nthe Romans met and withstood with success every type of impact, from the\r\nponderous shock of the Macedonian phalanx and the dangerous rush of\r\nCeltic savages to the charge of elephants. Yet it was no particular\r\nvirtue in the actual form employed that carried the Roman arms to so\r\nmany victories. There would have been positive danger in thus\r\narticulating the legion had it been composed of any but the most\r\ntrustworthy soldiers. To swiftness and precision of manoeuvre they added\r\na dogged obstinacy over which nothing but overwhelming disaster\r\nprevailed. It is, therefore, not unnatural to ask wherein the system\r\nwhich produced these soldiers failed, as it did within a century after\r\nthe battle of Zama. The greatest defect was the want of a single\r\nmilitary command. The civil magistrates of Rome were _ex officio_\r\nleaders of her armies, and though no Roman officer lacked military\r\ntraining, the views of a consul or praetor were almost invariably\r\ninfluenced by the programme of his political party. When, as sometimes\r\nhappened, the men under their command sided in the political differences\r\nof their leaders, all real control came to an end. The soldiers of the\r\nRepublic hardly ever forgot that they were citizens with voting powers;\r\nthey served as a rule only during a campaign; and, while there could be\r\nlittle question as to their patriotism and stubbornness, they lacked\r\nalmost entirely that _esprit de corps_ which is found only amongst the\r\nmembers of a body having a permanent corporate existence. Thus they had\r\nthe vices as well as the virtues of a nation in arms, and they fell\r\nstill further short of the ideal because of the dubious and precarious\r\ntenure of their generals' commands. The great officers were usually sent\r\nhome at the end of a campaign, to be replaced by their elected\r\nsuccessors, and they showed all the hesitation and fear of\r\nresponsibility usually found in a temporary commander. Above all, when\r\ntwo armies, each under its own consul or praetor, acted together, the\r\ncommand was either divided or exercised on alternate days.\r\n\r\n11. _Roman Empire._--The essential weaknesses of militia forces and the\r\naccidental circumstances of that under consideration led, even in\r\nearlier times, to the adoption of various expedients which for a time\r\nobviated the evils to which allusion has been made. But a change of far\r\ngreater importance followed the final exploits of the armies of the old\r\nsystem. The increasing dominions of the Republic, the spread of wealth\r\nand luxury, the gradual decadence of the old Roman ideas, all tended to\r\nproduce an army more suited to the needs of the newer time than the\r\ncitizen militia of the 3rd century. Permanent troops were a necessity;\r\nthe rich, in their newly acquired dislike of personal effort, ceased to\r\nbear their share in the routine life of the army, and thus the\r\nproletariat began to join the legions with the express intention of\r\ntaking to a military career. The actual change from the old _regime_ to\r\nthe new was in the main the work of Gaius Marius. The urgent demand for\r\nmen at the time of the Teutonic invasions caused the service to be\r\nthrown open to all Roman citizens irrespective of _census_. The new\r\nterritories furnished cavalry, better and more numerous than the old\r\n_equites_, and light troops of various kinds to replace the _velites_.\r\nOnly the heavy foot remained a purely Italian force, and the spread of\r\nthe Roman citizenship gradually abolished the distinction between a\r\nRoman and an allied legion. The higher classes had repeatedly shown\r\nthemselves unwilling to serve under plebeians (e.g. Varro and\r\nFlaminius); Marius preferred to have as soldiers men who did not despise\r\nhim as an inferior. Under all these influences for good or for evil, the\r\nstanding army was developed in the first half of the 1st century B.C.\r\nThe tactical changes in the legion indicate its altered character. The\r\nsmall maniples gave way to heavy \"cohorts,\" ten cohorts forming the\r\nlegion; as in the Napoleonic wars, light and handy formations became\r\ndenser and more rigid with the progressive decadence in _moral_ of the\r\nrank and file. It is more significant still that in the days of Marius\r\nthe annual oath of allegiance taken by the soldier came to be replaced\r\nby a personal vow, taken once and for all, of loyalty to the general.\r\n_Ubi bene, ibi patria_ was an expression of the new spirit of the army,\r\nand Caesar had but to address his men as _quirites_ (civilians) to quell\r\na mutiny. _Hastati, principes_ and _triarii_ were now merely expressions\r\nin drill and tactics. But perhaps the most important of all these\r\nchanges was the growth of regimental spirit and tradition. The legions\r\nwere now numbered throughout the army, and the Tenth Legion has remained\r\na classic instance of a \"crack\" corps. The _moral_ of the Roman army was\r\nfounded no longer on patriotism, but on professional pride and _esprit\r\nde corps_.\r\n\r\nWith this military system Rome passed through the era of the Civil Wars,\r\nat the end of which Augustus found himself with forty-five legions on\r\nhis hands. As soon as possible he carried through a great\r\nreorganization, by which, after ruthlessly rejecting inferior elements,\r\nhe obtained a smaller picked force of twenty-five legions, with numerous\r\nauxiliary forces. These were permanently stationed in the frontier\r\nprovinces of the Empire, while Italy was garrisoned by the Praetorian\r\ncohorts, and thus was formed a regular long-service army, the strength\r\nof which has been estimated at 300,000 men. But these measures,\r\ntemporarily successful, produced in the end an army which not only was\r\nperpetually at variance with the civil populations it was supposed to\r\nprotect, but frequently murdered the emperors to whom it had sworn\r\nallegiance when it raised them to the throne. The evil fame of the\r\nItalian cohorts has survived in the phrase \"praetorianism\" used to imply\r\na venal military despotism. The citizens gradually ceased to bear arms,\r\nand the practice of self-mutilation became common. The inevitable\r\n_denouement_ was delayed from time to time by the work of an energetic\r\nprince. But the ever-increasing inefficiency and factiousness of the\r\nlegions, and the evanescence of all military spirit in the civil\r\npopulation, made it easy for the barbarians, when once the frontier was\r\nbroken through, to overrun the decadent Empire. The end came when the\r\nGothic heavy horse annihilated the legions of Valens at Adrianople (A.D.\r\n378).\r\n\r\nThere was now no resource but to take the barbarians into Roman pay.\r\nUnder the name of _foederati_, the Gothic mercenary cavalry played the\r\nmost conspicuous part in the succeeding wars of the Empire, and began\r\nthe reign of the heavy cavalry arm, which lasted for almost a thousand\r\nyears. Even so soon as within six years of the death of Valens twenty\r\nthousand Gothic horse decided a great battle in the emperor's favour.\r\nThese men, however, became turbulent and factious, and it was not until\r\nthe emperor Leo I. had regenerated the native Roman soldier that the\r\nbalance was maintained between the national and the hired warrior. The\r\nwork of this emperor and of his successors found eventual expression in\r\nthe victories of Belisarius and Narses, in which the Romans, in the new\r\nrole of horse-archers, so well combined their efforts with those of the\r\n_foederati_ that neither the heavy cavalry of the Goths nor the phalanx\r\nof Frankish infantry proved to be capable of resisting the imperial\r\nforces. At the battle of Casilinum (553) Roman foot-archers and infantry\r\nbore no small part of the work. It was thus in the Eastern Empire that\r\nthe Roman military spirit revived, and the Byzantine army, as evolved\r\nfrom the system of Justinian, became eventually the sole example of a\r\nfully organized service to be found in medieval history.\r\n\r\n12. _The \"Dark Ages.\"_--In western Europe all traces of Roman military\r\ninstitutions quickly died out, and the conquerors of the new kingdoms\r\ndeveloped fresh systems from the simple tribal levy. The men of the\r\nplains were horsemen, those of marsh and moor were foot, and the four\r\ngreater peoples retained these original characteristics long after the\r\nconquest had been completed. In organization the Lombards and Franks,\r\nVisigoths and English scarcely differed. The whole military population\r\nformed the mass of the army, the chiefs and their personal retainers the\r\n_elite_. The Lombards and the Visigoths were naturally cavalry; the\r\nFranks and the English were, equally naturally, infantry, and the armies\r\nof the Merovingian kings differed but little from the English _fyrd_\r\nwith which Offa and Penda fought their battles. But in these nations the\r\nuse of horses and armour, at first confined to kings and great chiefs,\r\ngradually spread downwards to the ever-growing classes of _thegns,\r\ncomites_, &c. Finally, under Charlemagne were developed the general\r\nlines of the military organization which eventually became feudalism.\r\nFor his distant wars he required an efficient and mobile army. Hence\r\nsuccessive \"capitularies\" were issued dealing with matters of\r\nrecruiting, organization, discipline and field service work. Very\r\nnoticeable are his system of forts (_burgi_) with garrisons, his\r\nmilitary train of artillery and supplies, and the reappearance of the\r\nancient principle that three or four men should equip and maintain one\r\nof themselves as a warrior. These and other measures taken by him tended\r\nto produce a strong veteran army, very different in efficiency from the\r\ntumultuary levy, to which recourse was had only in the last resort.\r\nWhile war (as a whole) was not yet an art, fighting (from the\r\nindividual's point of view) had certainly become a special function;\r\nafter Charlemagne's time the typical feudal army, composed of\r\nwell-equipped cavalry and ill-armed peasantry serving on foot, rapidly\r\ndeveloped. Enemies such as Danes and Magyars could only be dealt with by\r\nmounted men who could ride round them, compel them to fight, and\r\nannihilate them by the shock of the charge; consequently the practice of\r\nleaving the infantry in rear, and even at home, grew up almost as a part\r\nof the feudal system of warfare. England, however, sought a different\r\nremedy, and thus diverged from the continental methods. This remedy was\r\nthe creation of a fleet, and, the later Danish wars being there carried\r\nout, not by bands of mounted raiders, but by large armies of military\r\nsettlers, infantry retained its premier position in England up to the\r\nday of Hastings. Even the _thegns_, who there, as abroad, were the\r\nmainstay of the army, were heavy-armed infantry. The only contribution\r\nmade by Canute to the military organization of England was the retention\r\nof a picked force of _hus carles_ (household troops) when the rest of\r\nthe army with which he had conquered his realm was sent back to\r\nScandinavia. At Hastings, the forces of Harold consisted wholly of\r\ninfantry. The English array was composed of the king and his personal\r\nfriends, the _hus carles_, and the contingents of the _fyrd_ under the\r\nlocal _thegns_; though better armed, they were organized after the\r\nmanner of their forefathers. On that field there perished the best\r\ninfantry in Europe, and henceforward for three centuries there was no\r\nserious rival to challenge the predominance of the heavy cavalry.\r\n\r\n13. _The Byzantines_ (cf. article ROMAN EMPIRE, LATER).--While the west\r\nof Europe was evolving feudalism, the Byzantine empire was acquiring an\r\narmy and military system scarcely surpassed by any of those of antiquity\r\nand not often equalled up to the most modern times. The _foederati_\r\ndisappeared after the time of Justinian, and by A.D. 600 the army had\r\nbecome at once professional and national. For generations, regiments had\r\nhad a corporate existence. Now brigades and divisions also appeared in\r\nwar, and, somewhat later, in peace likewise. With the disappearance of\r\nthe barbarians, the army became one homogeneous service, minutely\r\nsystematized, and generally resembling an army in the modern sense of\r\nthe word. The militia of the frontier districts performed efficiently\r\nthe service of surveillance, and the field forces of disciplined\r\nregulars were moved and employed in accordance with well-reasoned\r\nprinciples of war; their maintenance was provided for by a scutage,\r\nlevied, in lieu of service, on the central provinces of the empire.\r\nLater, a complete territorial system of recruiting and command was\r\nintroduced. Each \"theme\" (military district) had its own regular\r\ngarrison, and furnished a field division of some 5000 picked troopers\r\nfor a campaign in any theatre of war. Provision having been made in\r\npeace for a depot system, all weakly men and horses could be left\r\nbehind, and local duties handed over to second line troops; thus the\r\nfield forces were practically always on a war footing. Beside the\r\n\"themes\" under their generals, there were certain districts on the\r\nfrontiers, called \"clissuras,\" placed under chosen officers, and\r\nspecially organized for emergency service. The corps of officers in the\r\nByzantine army was recruited from the highest classes, and there were\r\nmany families (e.g. that from which came the celebrated Nicephorus\r\nPhocas) in which soldiering was the traditional career. The rank and\r\nfile were either military settlers or men of the yeoman class, and in\r\neither case had a personal interest in the safety of the theme which\r\nprevented friction between soldiers and civilians. The principal arm\r\nwas, of course, cavalry, and infantry was employed only in special\r\nduties. Engineer, train and medical services were maintained in each\r\ntheme. Of the ensemble of the Byzantine army it has been said that \"the\r\nart of war as it was understood at Constantinople ... was the only\r\nsystem of real merit existing. No western nation could have afforded\r\nsuch a training to its officers till the 16th or ... 17th century.\" The\r\nvitality of such an army remained intact long after the rest of the\r\nempire had begun to decay, and though the old army practically ceased to\r\nexist after the great disaster of Manzikert (1071), the barbarians and\r\nother mercenaries who formed the new service were organized, drilled and\r\ntrained to the same pitch of military efficiency. Indeed the greatest\r\ntactical triumph of the Byzantine system (Calavryta, 1079) was won by an\r\narmy already largely composed of foreigners. But mercenaries in the end\r\ndeveloped praetorianism, as usual, and at last they actually mutinied,\r\nin the presence of the enemy, for higher pay (Constantinople, 1204).\r\n\r\n14. _Feudalism._--From the military point of view the change under\r\nfeudalism was very remarkable. For the first time in the history of\r\nwestern Europe there appears, in however rough a form, a systematized\r\nobligation to serve in arms, regulated on a territorial basis. That army\r\norganization in the modern sense--organization for tactics and\r\ncommand--did not develop in any degree commensurate with the development\r\nof military administration, was due to the peculiar characteristics of\r\nthe feudal system, and the virtues and weaknesses of medieval armies\r\nwere its natural outcome. Personal bravery, the primary virtue of the\r\nsoldier, could not be wanting in the members of a military class, the\r\n_metier_ of which was war and manly exercises. Pride of caste, ambition\r\nand knightly emulation, all helped to raise to a high standard the\r\nindividual efficiency of the feudal cavalier. But the gravest faults of\r\nthe system, considered as an army organization, were directly due to\r\nthis personal element. Indiscipline, impatience of superior control, and\r\ndangerous knight-errantry, together with the absence of any chain of\r\ncommand, prevented the feudal cavalry from achieving results at all\r\nproportionate to the effort expended and the potentialities of a force\r\nwith so many soldierly qualities. If such defects were habitually found\r\nin the best elements of the army--the feudal tenants and subtenants who\r\nformed the heavy cavalry arm--little could be expected of the despised\r\nand ill-armed foot-soldiery of the levy. The swift raids of the Danes\r\nand others (see above) had created a precedent which in French and\r\nGerman wars was almost invariably followed. The feudal levy rarely\r\nappeared at all on the battlefield, and when it was thus employed it was\r\nridden down by the hostile knights, and even by those of its own party,\r\nwithout offering more than the feeblest resistance. Above all, one\r\ndisadvantage, common to all classes of feudal soldiers, made an army so\r\ncomposed quite untrustworthy. The service which a king was able to exact\r\nfrom his feudatories was so slight (varying from one month to three in\r\nthe year) that no military operation which was at all likely to be\r\nprolonged could be undertaken with any hope of success.\r\n\r\n15. _Medieval Mercenaries._--It was natural, therefore, that a sovereign\r\nwho contemplated a great war should employ mercenaries. These were\r\nusually foreigners, as practically all national forces served on feudal\r\nterms. While the greater lords rode with him on all his expeditions, the\r\nbulk of his army consisted of professional soldiers, paid by the levy of\r\n_scutage_ imposed upon the feudal tenantry. There had always been\r\nsoldiers of fortune. William's host at Hastings contained many such men;\r\nlater, the Flemings who invaded England in the days of Henry I. sang to\r\neach other--\r\n\r\n  \"Hop, hop, Willeken, hop! England is mine and thine,\"--\r\n\r\nand from all the evidence it is clear that in earlier days the hired\r\nsoldiers were adventurers seeking lands and homes. But these men usually\r\nproved to be most undesirable subjects, and sovereigns soon began to pay\r\na money wage for the services of mercenaries properly so called. Such\r\nwere the troops which figured in English history under Stephen. Such\r\ntroops, moreover, formed the main part of the armies of the early\r\nPlantagenets. They were, as a matter of course, armed and armoured like\r\nthe knights, with whom they formed the men-at-arms (_gendarmes_) of the\r\narmy. Indeed, in the 11th and 12th centuries, the typical army of France\r\nor the Empire contains a relatively small percentage of \"knights,\"\r\nevidence of which fact may be found even in so fanciful a romance as\r\n_Aucassin and Nicolete_. It must be noted, however, that not all the\r\nmercenaries were heavy cavalry; the Brabancon pikeman and the Italian\r\ncrossbowman (the value of whose weapon was universally recognized) often\r\nformed part of a feudal army.\r\n\r\n16. _Infantry in Feudal Times._--These mercenary foot soldiers came as a\r\nrule from districts in which the infantry arm had maintained its ancient\r\npredominance in unbroken continuity. The cities of Flanders and Brabant,\r\nand those of the Lombard plain, had escaped feudal interference with\r\ntheir methods of fighting, and their burgher militia had developed into\r\nsolid bodies of heavy-armed pikemen. These were very different from\r\nthose of the feudal levy, and individual knightly bravery usually failed\r\nto make the slightest impression on a band of infantry held together by\r\nthe stringent corporate feeling of a trade-gild. The more adventurous of\r\nthe young men, like those of the Greek cities, took service abroad and\r\nfought with credit in their customary manner. The reign of the\r\n\"Brabancon\" as a mercenary was indeed short, but he continued, in his\r\nown country, to fight in the old way, and his successor in the\r\nprofession of arms, the Genoese crossbowman, was always highly valued.\r\nIn England, moreover, the infantry of the old _fyrd_ was not suffered to\r\ndecay into a rabble of half-armed countrymen, and in France a burgher\r\ninfantry was established by Louis VI. under the name of the _milice des\r\ncommunes_, with the idea of creating a counterpoise to the power of the\r\nfeudatories. Feudalism, therefore, as a military system, was\r\nshort-lived. Its limitations had always necessitated the employment of\r\nmercenaries, and in several places a solid infantry was coming into\r\nexistence, which was drawn from the sturdy and self-respecting middle\r\nclasses, and in a few generations was to prove itself a worthy opponent\r\nnot only to the knight, but to the professional man-at-arms.\r\n\r\n17. _The Crusades._--It is an undoubted fact that the long wars of the\r\nCrusades produced, directly, but slight improvement in the feudal armies\r\nof Europe. In the East large bodies of men were successfully kept under\r\narms for a considerable period, but the application of crusading methods\r\nto European war was altogether impracticable. In the first place, much\r\nof the permanent force of these armies was contributed by the military\r\norders, which had no place in European political activities. Secondly,\r\nenthusiasm mitigated much of the evil of individualism. In the third\r\nplace, there was no custom to limit the period of service, since the\r\nCrusaders had undertaken a definite task and would merely have\r\nstultified their own purpose in leaving the work only half done. There\r\nwere, therefore, sharp contrasts between crusading and European armies.\r\nIn the latter, systematization was confined to details of recruiting; in\r\nthe armies of the Cross, men were from time to time obtained by the\r\naccident of religious fervour, while at the same time continuous service\r\nproduced a relatively high system of tactical organization. Different\r\nconditions, therefore, produced different methods, and crusading unity\r\nand discipline could not have been imposed on an ordinary army, which\r\nindeed with its paid auxiliaries was fairly adequate for the somewhat\r\ndesultory European wars of that time. The statement that the Crusaders\r\nhad a direct influence on the revival of infantry is hardly susceptible\r\nof convincing demonstration, but it is at any rate beyond question that\r\nthe social and economic results of the Crusades materially contributed\r\nto the downfall of the feudal knight, and in consequence to a rise in\r\nthe relative importance of the middle classes. Further, not only were\r\nthe Crusading knights compelled by their own want of numbers to rely on\r\nthe good qualities of the foot, but the foot themselves were the\r\n\"survivors of the fittest,\" for the weakly men died before they reached\r\nthe Holy Land, and with them there were always knights who had lost\r\ntheir horses and could not obtain remounts. Moreover, when \"simple\" and\r\n\"gentle\" both took the Cross there could be no question of treating\r\nCrusaders as if they were the mere feudal levy. But the little direct\r\ninfluence of the whole of these wars upon military progress in Europe is\r\nshown clearly enough by the fact that at the very close of the Crusades\r\na great battle was lost through knight-errantry of the true feudal type\r\n(Mansurah).\r\n\r\n18. _The Period of Transition_ (1290-1490).--Besides the infantry\r\nalready mentioned, that of Scotland and that of the German cities fought\r\nwith credit on many fields. Their arm was the pike, and they were always\r\nformed in solid masses (called in Scotland, _schiltrons_). The basis of\r\nthe medieval commune being the suppression of the individual in the\r\nsocial unit, it was natural that the burgher infantry should fight \"in\r\nserried ranks and in better order\" than a line of individual knights,\r\nwho, moreover, were almost powerless before walled cities. But these\r\nforces lacked offensive power, and it was left for the English archers,\r\nwhose importance dates from the latter years of the 13th century, to\r\nshow afresh, at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, the value of missile\r\naction. When properly supported by other arms, they proved themselves\r\ncapable of meeting both the man-at-arms and the pikeman. The greatest\r\nimportance attaches to the evolution of this idea of mutual support and\r\ncombination. Once it was realized, war became an art, and armies became\r\nspecially organized bodies of troops of different arms. It cannot be\r\nadmitted, indeed, as has been claimed, that the 14th century had a\r\nscientific system of tactics, or that the campaign of Poitiers was\r\narranged by the French \"general staff.\" Nevertheless, during this\r\ncentury armies were steadily coming to consist of expert soldiers, to\r\nthe exclusion of national levies and casual mercenaries. It is true\r\nthat, by his system of \"indents,\" Edward III. of England raised national\r\narmies of a professional type, but the English soldier thus enrolled,\r\nwhen discharged by his own sovereign, naturally sought similar\r\nemployment elsewhere. This system produced, moreover, a class of\r\nunemployed soldiers, and these, with others who became adventurers from\r\nchoice or necessity, and even with foreign troops, formed the armies\r\nwhich fought in the Wars of the Roses--armies which differed but\r\nslightly from others of the time. The natural result of these wars was\r\nto implant a hatred of soldiery in the heart of a nation which had\r\nformerly produced the best fighting men in Europe, a hatred which left a\r\ndeep imprint on the constitutional and social life of the people. In\r\nFrance, where Joan of Arc passed like a meteor across the military\r\nfirmament, the idea of a national regular army took a practical form in\r\nthe middle of the 15th century. Still, the forces thus brought into\r\nexistence were not numerous, and the soldier of fortune, in spite of\r\nsuch experiences of his methods as those of the Wars of the Roses, was\r\nyet to attain the zenith of his career.\r\n\r\n19. _The Condottieri._--The immediate result of this confused period of\r\ndestruction and reconstruction was the _condottiere_, who becomes\r\nimportant about 1300. In Italy, where the _condottieri_ chiefly\r\nflourished, they were in demand owing to the want of feudal cavalry, and\r\nthe inability of burgher infantry to undertake wars of aggression. The\r\n\"free companies\" (who served in great numbers in France and Spain as\r\nwell as in Italy) were \"military societies very much like trade-gilds,\"\r\nwhich (so to speak) were hawked from place to place by their managing\r\ndirectors, and hired temporarily by princes who needed their services.\r\nUnlike the older hirelings, they were permanently organized, and thus,\r\nwith their experience and discipline, became the best troops in\r\nexistence. But the carrying on of war \"in the spirit of a handicraft\"\r\nled to bloodless battles, indecisive campaigns, and other unsatisfactory\r\nresults, and the reign of the _condottieri_ proper was over by 1400,\r\nsubsequent free companies being raised on a more strictly national\r\nbasis. With all their defects, however, they were the pioneers of modern\r\norganization. In the inextricable tangle of old and new methods which\r\nconstitutes the military system of the 15th century, it is possible to\r\ndiscern three marked tendencies. One is the result of a purely military\r\nconception of the now special art of war, and its exposition as an art\r\nby men who devote their whole career to it. The second is the idea of a\r\nnational army, resulting from many social, economical and political\r\ncauses. The third is the tendency towards minuter organization and\r\nsubdivision within the army. Whereas the individual feudatories had\r\ndisliked the close supervision of a minor commander, and their army had\r\nin consequence remained always a loosely-knit unit, the men who made war\r\ninto an art belonged to small bands or corps, and naturally began their\r\norganization from the lower units. Herein, therefore, was the germ of\r\nthe regimental system of the present day.\r\n\r\n20. _The Swiss._--The best description of a typical European army at the\r\nopening of the new period of development is that of the French army in\r\nItaly in 1494, written by Paolo Giovio. He notes with surprise that the\r\nvarious corps of infantry and cavalry are distinct, the usual practice\r\nof the time being to combine one lancer, one archer, one groom, &c.,\r\ninto a small unit furnished and commanded by the lancer. There were\r\nSwiss and German infantry, armed with pike and halbert, with a few\r\n\"shot,\" who marched in good order to music. There were the heavy\r\nmen-at-arms (_gendarmes_), accompanied as of old by mounted archers,\r\nwho, however, now fought independently. There were, further, Gascon\r\nslingers and crossbowmen, who had probably acquired, from contact with\r\nSpain, some of the lightness and dash of their neighbours. The artillery\r\ntrain was composed of 140 heavy pieces and a great number of lighter\r\nguns; these were then and for many generations thereafter a special arm\r\noutside the military establishments (see ARTILLERY). In all this the\r\nonly relic of the days of Crecy is the administrative combination of the\r\nmen-at-arms and the horse archers, and even this is no longer practised\r\nin action. The most important element in the army is the heavy infantry\r\nof Swiss and Germans. The Swiss had for a century past gradually\r\ndeveloped into the most formidable troops of the day. The wars of Zizka\r\n(q.v.) in Bohemia (1420) materially assisted in the downfall of the\r\nheavy cavalry; and the victories of the Swiss, beginning with Sempach\r\n(1382), had by 1480 proved that their solid battalions, armed with the\r\nlong pike and the halberd, were practically invulnerable to all but\r\nmissile and shock action combined. By fortune of war, they never met the\r\nEnglish, who had shown the way to deal with the _schiltron_ as early as\r\nFalkirk. So great was their confidence against ordinary troops, that on\r\none occasion (1444) they detached 1600 men to engage 50,000. It was\r\nnatural that a series of victories such as Granson, Morat and Nancy\r\nshould place them in the forefront of the military nations of Europe.\r\nThe whole people devoted itself thereupon to professional soldiering,\r\nparticularly in the French service, and though their monopoly of\r\nmercenary employment lasted a short time only, they continued to furnish\r\nregiments to the armies of France, Spain and the Pope up to the most\r\nmodern times. But their efficiency was thoroughly sapped by the growth\r\nof a mutinous and insubordinate spirit, the memory of which has survived\r\nin the proverb _Point d'argent, point de Suisse_, and inspired\r\nMachiavelli with the hatred of mercenaries which marks every page of his\r\nwork on the art of war. One of their devices for extorting money was to\r\nappear at the muster with many more soldiers than had been contracted\r\nfor by their employers, who were forced to submit to this form of\r\nblackmail. At last the French, tired of these caprices, inflicted on the\r\nSwiss the crushing defeat of Marignan (q.v.), and their tactical system\r\nreceived its death-blow from the Spaniards at Pavia (1525).\r\n\r\n21. _The Landsknechts._--The modern army owes far more of its\r\norganization and administrative methods to the Landsknechts (\"men of the\r\ncountry,\" as distinct from foreigners) than to the Swiss. As the latter\r\nwere traditionally the friends of France, so these Swabians were the\r\nmainstay of the Imperial armies, though both were mercenaries. The\r\nemperor Maximilian exerted himself to improve the new force, which soon\r\nbecame the model for military Europe. A corps of Landsknechts was\r\nusually raised by a system resembling that of \"indents,\" commissions\r\nbeing issued by the sovereign to leaders of repute to enlist men. A\r\n\"colour\" (_Fahnlein_) numbered usually about 400 men, a corps consisted\r\nof a varying number of colours, some corps having 12,000 men. From these\r\ntroops, with their intense pride, _esprit de corps_ and comradeship,\r\nthere has come down to modern times much of present-day etiquette,\r\ninterior economy and \"regimental customs\"--in other words, nearly all\r\nthat is comprised in the \"regimental\" system. Amongst the most notable\r\nfeatures of their system were the functions of the provost, who combined\r\nthe modern offices of provost-marshal, transport and supply officer, and\r\ncanteen manager; the disciplinary code, which admitted the right of the\r\nrank and file to judge offences touching the honour of the regiment; and\r\nthe women who, lawfully or unlawfully attached to the soldiers, marched\r\nwith the regiment and had a definite place in its corporate life. The\r\nconception of the regiment as the home of the soldier was thus realized\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\n22. _The Spanish Army._--The tendencies towards professional soldiering\r\nand towards subdivision had now pronounced themselves. At the same time,\r\nwhile national armies, as dreamed of by Machiavelli; were not yet in\r\nexistence, two at least of the powers were beginning to work towards an\r\nideal. This ideal was an army which was entirely at the disposal of its\r\nown sovereign, trained to the due professional standard, and organized\r\nin the best way found by experience to be applicable to military needs.\r\nOn these bases was formed the old Spanish army which, from Pavia (1525)\r\nto Rocroi (1643), was held by common consent to be the finest service in\r\nexistence. Almost immediately after emerging from the period of internal\r\ndevelopment, Spain found herself obliged to maintain an army for the\r\nItalian wars. In the first instance this was raised from amongst\r\nveterans of the war of Granada, who enlisted for an indefinite time.\r\nProbably the oldest line regiments in Europe are those descended from\r\nthe famous _tercios_, whose formation marks the beginning of military\r\nestablishments, just as the Landsknechts were the founders of military\r\nmanners and customs. The great captains who led the new army soon\r\nassimilated the best points of the Swiss system, and it was the Spanish\r\narmy which evolved the typical combination of pike and musket which\r\nflourished up to 1700. Outside the domain the tactics, it must be\r\ncredited with an important contribution to the science of army\r\norganization, in the depot system, whereby the _tercios_ in the field\r\nwere continually \"fed\" and kept up to strength. The social position of\r\nthe soldier was that of a gentleman, and the young nobles (who soon came\r\nto prefer the _tercios_ to the cavalry service) thought it no shame,\r\nwhen their commands were reduced, to \"take a pike\" in another regiment.\r\nThe provost and his gallows were as much in evidence in a Spanish camp\r\nas in one of Landsknechts, but the comradeship and _esprit de corps_ of\r\na _tercio_ were the admiration of all contemporary soldiers. With all\r\nits good qualities, however, this army was not truly national; men soon\r\ncame from all the various nations ruled by the Habsburgs, and the\r\nsoldier of fortune found employment in a _tercio_ as readily as\r\nelsewhere. But it was a great gain that corps, as such, were fully\r\nrecognized as belonging to the government, however shifting the\r\n_personnel_ might be. Permanence of regimental existence had now been\r\nattained, though the universal acceptance and thorough application of\r\nthe principle were still far distant. During the 16th century, the\r\nFrench regular army (originating in the _compagnies d'ordonnance_ of\r\n1445), which was always in existence, even when the Swiss and\r\n_gendarmes_ were the best part of the field forces, underwent a\r\nconsiderable development, producing amongst other things the military\r\nterminology of the present day. But the wars of religion effectually\r\nchecked all progress in the latter part of the century, and the European\r\nreputation of the French army dates only from the latter part of the\r\nThirty Years' War.\r\n\r\n23. _The Sixteenth Century._--The battle of St Quentin (1557) is usually\r\ntaken as the date from which the last type of a purely mercenary _arm_\r\n(as distinct from _corps_) comes into prominence. \"Brabancon\" or \"Swiss\"\r\nimplied pikemen without further qualification, the new term \"Reiter\"\r\nsimilarly implied mercenary cavalry fighting with the pistol. Heavy\r\ncavalry could disperse arquebusiers and musketeers, but it was helpless\r\nagainst solid masses of pikemen; the Reiters solved the difficulty by\r\nthe use of the pistol. They were well armoured and had little to fear\r\nfrom musket-balls. Arrayed in deep squadrons, therefore, they rode up to\r\nthe pikes with impunity, and fired methodically _dans le tas_, each rank\r\nwhen it had discharged its pistols filing to the rear to reload. These\r\nReiters were organized in squadrons of variable strength, and recruited\r\nin the same manner as were the Landsknechts. They were much inferior,\r\nhowever, to the latter in their discipline and general conduct, for\r\ncavalry had many more individual opportunities of plunder than the foot,\r\nand the rapacity and selfishness of the Reiters were consequently in\r\nmarked contrast to the good order and mutual helpfulness in the field\r\nand in quarters which characterized the regimental system of the\r\nLandsknechts.\r\n\r\n24. _Dutch System._--The most interesting feature of the Dutch system,\r\nwhich was gradually evolved by the patriots in the long War of\r\nIndependence, was its minute attention to detail. In the first years of\r\nthe war, William the Silent had to depend, for field operations, on\r\nmutinous and inefficient mercenaries and on raw countrymen who had\r\nnothing but devotion to oppose to the discipline and skill of the best\r\nregular army in the world. Such troops were, from the point of view of\r\nsoldiers like Alva, mere _canaille_, and the ludicrous ease with which\r\ntheir armies were destroyed (as at Jemmingen and Mookerheyde), at the\r\ncost of the lives of perhaps a dozen Spanish veterans, went far to\r\njustify this view. But, fortunately for the Dutch, their fortified towns\r\nwere exceedingly numerous, and the individual bravery of\r\ncitizen-militia, who were fighting for the lives of every soul within\r\ntheir walls, baffled time after time all the efforts of Alva's men. In\r\nthe open, Spanish officers took incredible liberties with the enemy;\r\nonce, at any rate, they marched for hours together along submerged\r\nembankments with hostile vessels firing into them from either side.\r\nBehind walls the Dutch were practically a match for the most furious\r\nvalour of the assailants.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents' first important victory in the open field, that of\r\nRymenant near Malines (1577), was won by the skill of \"Bras de Fer,\" de\r\nla Noue, a veteran French general, and the stubbornness of the English\r\ncontingent of the Dutch army--for England, from 1572 onwards, sent out\r\nan ever-increasing number of volunteers. This battle was soon followed\r\nby the great defeat of Gembloux (1578), and William the Silent was not\r\ndestined to see the rise of the Dutch army. Maurice of Nassau was the\r\nreal organizer of victory. In the wreck of all feudal and burgher\r\nmilitary institutions, he turned to the old models of Xenophon,\r\nPolybius, Aelian and the rest. Drill, as rigid and as complicated as\r\nthat of the Macedonian phalanx, came into vogue, the infantry was\r\norganized more strictly into companies and regiments, the cavalry into\r\ntroops or cornets. The _Reiter_ tactics of the pistol were followed by\r\nthe latter, the former consisted of pikes, halberts and \"shot.\" This\r\nform was generally followed in central Europe, as usual, without the\r\nspirit, but in Holland it was the greater trustworthiness of the rank\r\nand file that allowed of more flexible formations, and here we no longer\r\nsee the foot of an army drawn up, as at Jemmingen, in one solid and\r\nimmovable \"square.\" In their own country and with the system best suited\r\nthereto, the Dutch, who moreover acquired greater skill and steadiness\r\nday by day, maintained their ground against all the efforts of a Parma\r\nand a Spinola. Indeed, it is the best tribute to the vitality of the\r\nSpanish system that the inevitable _debacle_ was so long delayed. The\r\ncampaigns of Spinola in Germany demonstrated that the \"Dutch\" system, as\r\na system for general use, was at any rate no better than the system over\r\nwhich it had locally asserted its superiority, and the spirit, and not\r\nthe form, of Maurice's practice achieved the ultimate victory of the\r\nNetherlanders. In the Thirty Years' War, the unsuccessful armies of\r\nMansfeld and many others were modelled on the Dutch system,--the forces\r\nof Spinola, of Tilly and of Wallenstein, on the Spanish. In other words,\r\nthese systems as such meant little; the discipline and spirit behind\r\nthem, everything. Yet the contribution made by the Dutch system to the\r\narmies of to-day was not small; to Maurice and his comrades we owe,\r\nfirst the introduction of careful and accurate drill, and secondly the\r\nbeginnings of an acknowledged science of war, the groundwork of both\r\nbeing the theory and practice of antiquity. The present method of\r\n\"forming fours\" in the British infantry is ultimately derived from\r\nAelian, just as the first beats of the drums in a march represent the\r\nregimental calls of the Landsknechts, and the depots and the drafts for\r\nthe service battalions date from the Italian wars of Spain.\r\n\r\n25. _The Thirty Years' War._--Hitherto all armies had been raised or\r\nreduced according to the military and political situation of the moment.\r\nSpain had indeed maintained a relatively high effective in peace, but\r\nelsewhere a few personal guards, small garrisons, and sometimes a small\r\nregular army to serve as a nucleus, constituted the only permanent\r\nforces kept under arms by sovereigns, though, in this era of perpetual\r\nwars, armies were almost always on a war footing. The expense of\r\nmaintenance at that time practically forbade any other system than this,\r\ncalled in German _Werbe-system_, a term for which in English there is no\r\nnearer equivalent than \"enlistment\" or \"levy\" system. It is worth\r\nnoticing that this very system is identical in principle with that of\r\nthe United States at the present day, viz., a small permanent force,\r\ninflated to any required size at the moment of need. The exceptional\r\nconditions of the Dutch army, indeed, secured for its regiments a long\r\nlife; yet when danger was finally over, a large portion of the army was\r\nat once reduced. The history of the British army from about 1740 to 1820\r\nis a most striking, if belated, example of the _Werbe-system_ in\r\npractice. But the Thirty Years' War naturally produced an unusual\r\ncontinuity of service in corps raised about 1620-1630, and fifty years\r\nlater the principle of the standing army was universally accepted. It is\r\nthus that the senior regiments of the Prussian and Austrian armies date\r\nfrom about 1630. At this time an event took place which was destined to\r\nhave a profound influence on the military art. Gustavus Adolphus of\r\nSweden landed in Germany with an army better organized, trained and\r\nequipped than any which had preceded it. This army, by its great victory\r\nof Breitenfeld (1631), inaugurated the era of \"modern\" warfare, and it\r\nis to the system of Gustavus that the student must turn for the initial\r\npoint of the progressive development which has produced the armies of\r\nto-day. Spanish and Dutch methods at once became as obsolete as those of\r\nthe Landsknechts.\r\n\r\n26. _The Swedish Army._--The Swedish army was raised by a carefully\r\nregulated system of conscription, which was \"preached in every pulpit in\r\nSweden.\" There were indeed enlisted regiments of the usual type, and it\r\nwould seem that Gustavus obtained the best even of the soldiers of\r\nfortune. But the national regiments were raised on the _Indelta_ system.\r\nEach officer and man, under this scheme, received a land grant within\r\nthe territorial district of his corps, and each of these districts\r\nsupplied recruits in numbers proportionate to its population. This\r\ncurious mixture of feudal and modern methods produced the best elements\r\nof an army, which, aided by the tactical and technical improvements\r\nintroduced by Gustavus, proved itself incomparably superior to its\r\nrivals. Of course the long and bloody campaigns of 1630-34 led to the\r\nadmission of great numbers of mercenaries even into the Swedish corps;\r\nand German, Scottish and other regiments figured largely, not only in\r\nthe armies of Duke Bernhard and his successors, but in the army of\r\nGustavus' own lifetime. As early as 1632 one brigade of the army was\r\ndistinguished by the title \"Swedish,\" as alone containing no foreigners.\r\nYet the framework was much the same as it had been in 1630. The\r\nbattle-organization of two lines and two wings, which was typical of the\r\nlater \"linear\" tactics, began to supplant the system of the _tercios_.\r\nHow cumbrous the latter had become by 1630 may be judged from any\r\nbattle-plan of the period, and notably from that of Lutzen. Gustavus'\r\ncavalry fought four or three deep only, and depended as little as\r\npossible on the pistol. The work of riding down the pikes was indeed\r\nrendered easier by the improved tactical handiness of the musketeers,\r\nbut it was fiery leading which alone compelled victory, for there were\r\nrelatively few Swedish horse and many squadrons of Germans and others,\r\nwho in themselves were far less likely to charge boldly than the\r\n\"Pappenheimers\" and other crack corps of the enemy. The infantry was of\r\nthe highest class, and only on that condition could loose and supple\r\nlines be trusted to oppose the solid _tercios_ of Tilly and Wallenstein.\r\nCumbrous indeed these were, but by long practice they had acquired no\r\nsmall manoeuvring power, of which Breitenfeld affords a striking\r\nexample. The Swedes, however, completely surpassed them. The progress\r\nthus made may be gauged from the fact that under Gustavus the largest\r\nclosed body of infantry was less than 300 strong. Briefly, the genius of\r\na great commander, the ardour of a born cavalry leader, better arms and\r\nbetter organization, carried the Swedes to the end of their career of\r\nvictory, but how personal was the _vis viva_ which inspired the army was\r\nquickly noticeable after the death of Gustavus. Even a Bernhard could,\r\nin the end, evoke no more heroism from a Swedish army than from any\r\nother, and the real Swedish troops fought their last battle at\r\nNordlingen (1634). After this, little distinguished the \"Swedish\" forces\r\nfrom the general mass of the armies of the time, save their system, to\r\nwhich, and to its influence on the training of such leaders as Baner,\r\nTorstensson and Wrangel, all their later victories were due. So much of\r\nGustavus' work survived even the carnage of Nordlingen, and his system\r\nalways obtained better results, even with the heterogeneous troops of\r\nthis later period, than any other of the time.\r\n\r\n27. _The English Civil War_ (see GREAT REBELLION).--The armies on either\r\nside which, about the same time, were fighting out the constitutional\r\nquarrel in England were essentially different from all those of the\r\ncontinent, though their formal organization was similar to that of the\r\nSwedes. The military expression of a national conscience had appeared\r\nrarely indeed in the Thirty Years' War, which was a means of livelihood\r\nfor, rather than an assertion of principle by, those who engaged in it.\r\nIn England, on the other hand, there were no mercenaries, and the whole\r\ncharacter of the operations was settled by the burning desire of a true\r\n\"nation in arms\" to decide at once, by the arbitrament of battle, the\r\nvital points at issue. A German critic (Fritz Hoenig) has indicated\r\nWorcester as the prototype of Sedan; at any rate, battles of this kind\r\ninvariably resulted in failure when entrusted to a \"standing\" army of\r\nthe 18th century. But the national armies disappeared at the end of the\r\nstruggle; after the Restoration, English political aims became, so far\r\nas military activity was concerned, similar in scope and execution to\r\nthose of the continent; and the example of Cromwell and the \"New Model,\"\r\nwhich might have revolutionized military Europe, passed away without\r\nhaving any marked influence on the armies of other nations.\r\n\r\n28. _Standing Armies._--Nine years after Nordlingen, the old Spanish\r\narmy fought its last and most honourable battle at Rocroi. Its\r\nconquerors were the new French troops, whose victory created as great a\r\nsensation as Pavia and Crecy had done. Infusing a new military spirit\r\ninto the formal organization of Gustavus' system, the French army was\r\nnow to \"set the fashion\" for a century. France had been the first power\r\nto revive regular forces, and the famous \"Picardie\" regiment disputed\r\nfor precedence even with the old _tercios_. The country had emerged from\r\nthe confusion of the past century with the foreign and domestic strength\r\nof a practically absolute central power. The Fronde continued the\r\nmilitary history of the army from the end of the Thirty Years' War; and\r\nwhen the period of consolidation was finally closed, all was prepared\r\nfor the introduction of a \"standing army,\" practically always at war\r\nstrength, and entirely at the disposal of the sovereign. The\r\nreorganization of the military establishments by Louvois may be taken as\r\nthe formal date at which standing armies came into prominence (see\r\nhistorical sketch of the French army below). Other powers rapidly\r\nfollowed the lead of France, for the defects of enlisted troops had\r\nbecome very clear, and the possession of an army always ready for war\r\nwas an obvious advantage in dynastic politics. The French proprietary\r\nsystem of regiments, and the general scheme of army administration which\r\nreplaced it, may be taken as typical of the armies of other great powers\r\nin the time of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n29. _Character of the Standing Armies._--A peculiar character was from\r\nthe first imparted to the new organizations by the results of the Thirty\r\nYears' War. A well-founded horror of military barbarity had the effect\r\nof separating the soldier from the civilian by an impassable gulf. The\r\ndrain of thirty years on the population, resources and finances of\r\nalmost every country in middle Europe, everywhere limited the size of\r\nthe new armies; and the decision in 1648 of all questions save those of\r\ndynastic interest dictated the nature of their employment. The best\r\nsoldiers of the time pronounced in favour of small field armies, for in\r\nthe then state of communications and agriculture large forces proved in\r\npractice too cumbrous for good work. In every country, therefore, the\r\narmy took the form of a professional body, nearly though not quite\r\nindependent of extra recruits for war, set apart entirely from all\r\ncontact with civil life, rigidly restricted as to conduct in peace and\r\nwar, and employed mostly in the \"maintenance\" of their superiors'\r\nprivate quarrels. Iron discipline produced splendid tenacity in action,\r\nand wholesale desertion at all times. In the Seven Years' War, for\r\ninstance, the Austrians stated one-fifth of their total loss as due to\r\ndesertion, and Thackeray's _Barry Lyndon_ gives no untrue picture of the\r\nlife of a soldier under the old regime. Further, since men were costly,\r\nrigid economy of their lives in action, and minute care for their\r\nfeeding and shelter on the march, occupied a disproportionate amount of\r\nthe attention of their generals. Armies necessarily moved slowly and\r\nremained concentrated to facilitate supply and to check desertion, and\r\nthus, when a commander had every unit of his troops within a short ride\r\nof his headquarters, there was little need for intermediate general\r\nofficers, and still less for a highly trained staff.\r\n\r\n30. _Organization in the 18th Century._--All armies were now almost\r\nequal in fighting value, and war was consequently reduced to a set of\r\nrules (not principles), since superiority was only to be gained by\r\nmethods, not by men. Soldiers such as Marlborough, who were superior to\r\nthese jejune prescriptions, met indeed with uniform success. But the\r\nmethods of the 18th century failed to receive full illustration, save by\r\nthe accident of a great captain's direction, even amidst the\r\ncircumstances for which they were designed. It is hardly to be wondered\r\nat, therefore, that they failed, when forced by a new phase of\r\ndevelopment to cope with events completely beyond their element. The\r\ninner organization was not markedly altered. Artillery was still outside\r\nthe normal organization of the line of battle, though in the period\r\n1660-1740 much was done in all countries to improve the material, and\r\nabove all to turn the _personnel_ into disciplined soldiers. Cavalry was\r\norganized in regiments and squadrons, and armed with sabre and pistol.\r\nInfantry had by 1703 begun to assume its three-deep line formation and\r\nthe typical weapons of the arm, musket and bayonet. Regiments and\r\nbattalions were the units of combat as well as organization. In the\r\nfight the company was entirely merged in the higher unit, but as an\r\nadministrative body it still remained. As for the higher organization,\r\nan army consisted simply of a greater or less number of battalions and\r\nsquadrons, without, as a rule, intermediate commands and groupings. The\r\narmy was arrayed as a whole in two lines of battle, with the infantry in\r\nthe centre and the cavalry on the flanks, and an advanced guard; the\r\nso-called reserve consisting merely of troops not assigned to the\r\nregular commands. It was divided, for command in action, into right and\r\nleft wings, both of cavalry and infantry, of each line. This was the\r\nfamous \"linear\" organization, which in theory produced the maximum\r\neffort in the minimum time, but in practice, handled by officers whose\r\nchief care was to avoid the expenditure of effort, achieved only\r\nnegative results. To see its defects one need only suppose a battalion\r\nof the first line hard pressed by the enemy. A battalion of the second\r\nline was directly behind it, but there was no authority, less than that\r\nof the wing commander, which could order it up to support the first. All\r\nthe conditions of the time were opposed to tactical subdivision, as the\r\nterm is now understood. That the 18th century did not revive\r\n_schiltrons_ was due to the new fire tactics, to which everything but\r\ncontrol was sacrificed. This \"control,\" as has been said, implied not so\r\nmuch command as police supervision. But far beyond any faults of\r\norganization and recruiting, the inherent vice of these armies was, as\r\nMachiavelli had pointed out two centuries previously, and as Prussia was\r\nto learn to her cost in 1806, that once they were thoroughly defeated,\r\nthe only thing left to be done was to make peace at once, since there\r\nwas no other armed force capable of retrieving a failure.\r\n\r\n31. _Frederick the Great._--The military career of Frederick the Great\r\nis very different from those of his predecessors. With an army organized\r\non the customary system, and trained and equipped, better indeed, but\r\nstill on the same lines as those of his rivals, the king of Prussia\r\nachieved results out of all proportion to those imagined by contemporary\r\nsoldiers. It is to his campaigns, therefore, that the student must refer\r\nfor the real, if usually latent, possibilities of the army of the 18th\r\ncentury. The prime secret of his success lay in the fact that he was his\r\nown master, and responsible to no superior for the uses to which he put\r\nhis men. This position had never, since the introduction of standing\r\narmies, been attained by any one, even Eugene and Leopold of Dessau\r\nbeing subject to the common restriction; and with this extraordinary\r\nadvantage over his opponents, Frederick had further the firmness and\r\nruthless energy of a great commander. Prussia, moreover, was more\r\nstrictly organized than other countries, and there was relatively little\r\nof that opposition of local authorities to the movement of troops which\r\nwas conspicuous in Austria. The military successes of Prussia,\r\ntherefore, up to 1757, were not primarily due to the system and the\r\nformal tactics, but were the logical outcome of greater energy in the\r\nleading, and less friction in the administration, of her armies. But the\r\nconditions were totally different in 1758-1762, when the full force of\r\nthe alliance against Prussia developed itself in four theatres of war.\r\nFrederick was driven back to the old methods of making war, and his men\r\nwere no longer the soldiers of Leuthen and Hohenfriedberg. If discipline\r\nwas severe before, it was merciless then; the king obtained men by force\r\nand fraud from every part of Germany, and had both to repress and to\r\ntrain them in the face of the enemy. That under such conditions, and\r\nwith such men, the weaker party finally emerged triumphant, was indeed a\r\nstartling phenomenon. Yet its result for soldiers was not the production\r\nof the national army, though the dynastic forces had once more shown\r\nthemselves incapable of compassing decisive victories, nor yet the\r\nremoval of the barrier between army and people, for the operations of\r\nFrederick's recruiting agents made a lasting impression, and, further,\r\nlarge numbers of men who had thought to make a profession of arms were\r\nturned adrift at the end of the war. On the contrary, all that the great\r\nand prolonged _tour de force_ of these years produced was a tendency,\r\nquite in the spirit of the age, to make a formal science out of the art\r\nof war. Better working and better methods were less sought after than\r\nsystematization of the special practices of the most successful\r\ncommanders. Thus Frederick's methods, since 1758 essentially the same as\r\nthose of others, were taken as the basis of the science now for the\r\nfirst time called \"strategy,\" the fact that his opponents had also\r\npractised it without success being strangely ignored. Along with this\r\ncame a mania for imitation. Prussian drill, uniforms and hair-powder\r\nwere slavishly copied by every state, and for the next twenty years, and\r\nespecially when the war-trained officers and men had left active\r\nservice, the purest pedantry reigned in all the armies of Europe,\r\nincluding that of Prussia. One of the ablest of Frederick's subordinates\r\nwrote a book in which he urged that the cadence of the infantry step\r\nshould be increased by one pace per minute. The only exceptions to the\r\nuniversal prevalence of this spirit were in the Austrian army, which was\r\nsaved from atrophy by its Turkish wars, and in a few British and French\r\ntroops who served in the American War of Independence. The British\r\nregiments were sent to die of fever in the West Indies; when the storm\r\nof the French Revolution broke over Europe, the Austrian army was the\r\nonly stable element of resistance.\r\n\r\n32. _The French Revolution._--Very different were the armies of the\r\nRevolution. Europe, after being given over to professional soldiers for\r\nfive hundred years, at last produced the modern system of the \"nation in\r\narms.\" The French volunteers of 1792 were a force by which the routine\r\ngenerals of the enemy, working with instruments and by rules designed\r\nfor other conditions, were completely puzzled, and France gained a short\r\nrespite. The year 1793 witnessed the most remarkable event that is\r\nrecorded in the history of armies. Raw enthusiasm was replaced, after\r\nthe disasters and defections which marked the beginning of the campaign,\r\nby a systematic and unsparing conscription, and the masses of men thus\r\nenrolled, inspired by ardent patriotism and directed by the ferocious\r\nenergy of the Committee of Public Safety, met the disciplined formalists\r\nwith an opposition before which the attack completely collapsed. It was\r\nless marvellous in fact than in appearance that this should be so. Not\r\nto mention the influence of pedantry and senility on the course of the\r\noperations, it may be admitted that Frederick and his army at their best\r\nwould have been unable to accomplish the downfall of the now thoroughly\r\nroused French. Tactically, the fire of the regulars' line caused the\r\nRevolutionary levies to melt away by thousands, but men were ready to\r\nfill the gaps. No complicated supply system bound the French to\r\nmagazines and fortresses, for Europe could once more feed an army\r\nwithout convoys, and roads were now good and numerous. No fear of\r\ndesertion kept them concentrated under canvas, for each man was\r\npersonally concerned with the issue. If the allies tried to oppose them\r\non an equal front, they were weak at all points, and the old\r\norganization had no provision for the working of a scattered army. While\r\nten victorious campaigns had not carried Marlborough nearer to Paris\r\nthan some marches beyond the Sambre, two campaigns now carried a French\r\narmy to within a few miles of Vienna. It was obvious that, before such\r\nforces and such mobility, the old system was doomed, and with each\r\nsuccessive failure the old armies became more discouraged. Napoleon's\r\nvictories finally closed this chapter of military development, and by\r\n1808 the only army left to represent it was the British. Even to this\r\nthe Peninsular War opened a line of progress, which, if different in\r\nmany essentials from continental practice, was in any case much more\r\nthan a copy of an obsolete model.\r\n\r\n33. _The Conscription._--In 1793, at a moment when the danger to France\r\nwas so great as to produce the rigorous emergency methods of the Reign\r\nof Terror, the combined enemies of the Republic had less than 300,000\r\nmen in the field between Basel and Dunkirk. On the other hand, the call\r\nof the \"country in danger\" produced more than four times this number of\r\nmen for the French armies within a few months. Louis XIV., even when all\r\nFrance had been awakened to warlike enthusiasm by a similar threat\r\n(1709), had not been able to put in the field more than one-fifth of\r\nthis force. The methods of the great war minister Carnot were enforced\r\nby the ruthless committee, and when men's lives were safer before the\r\nbayonets of the allies than before the civil tribunals at home, there\r\nwas no difficulty in enlisting the whole military spirit of France.\r\nThere is therefore not much to be said as to the earliest application of\r\nthe conscription, at least as regards its formal working, since any\r\nsystem possessing elasticity would equally have served the purpose. In\r\nthe meanwhile, the older plans of organization had proved inadequate for\r\ndealing with such imposing masses of men. Even with disciplined soldiers\r\nthey had long been known as applicable only to small armies, and the\r\ndeficiencies of the French, with their consequences in tactics and\r\nstrategy, soon produced the first illustrations of modern methods.\r\nUnable to meet the allies in the plain, they fought in broken ground and\r\non the widest possible front. This of course produced decentralization\r\nand subdivision; and it became absolutely necessary that each detachment\r\non a front of battle 30 m. long (e.g. Stokach) should be properly\r\ncommanded and self-sufficing. The army was therefore constituted in a\r\nnumber of _divisions_, each of two or more brigades with cavalry and\r\nartillery sufficient for its own needs. It was even more important that\r\neach divisional general, with his own staff, should be a real commander,\r\nand not merely the supervisor of a section of the line of battle, for he\r\nwas almost in the position that a commander-in-chief had formerly held.\r\nThe need of generals was easily supplied when there was so wide a field\r\nof selection. For the allies the mere adoption of new forms was without\r\nresult, since it was contrary both to tradition and to existing\r\norganization. The attempts which were made in this direction did not\r\ntend to mitigate the evils of inferior numbers and _moral_. The French\r\nsoon followed up the divisional system with the further organization of\r\ngroups of divisions under specially selected general officers; this\r\nagain quickly developed into the modern army corps.\r\n\r\n34. _Napoleon._--Revolutionary government, however, gave way in a few\r\nyears to more ordinary institutions, and the spirit of French politics\r\nhad become that of aggrandizement in the name of liberty. The ruthless\r\napplication of the new principle of masses had been terribly costly, and\r\nthe disasters of 1799 reawakened in the mass of the people the old\r\ndislike of war and service. Even before this it had been found necessary\r\nto frame a new act, the famous law proposed by General Jourdan (1798).\r\nWith this the conscription for general service began. The legal term of\r\nfive years was so far exceeded that the service came to be looked upon\r\nas a career, or servitude, for life; it was therefore both unavoidable\r\nand profitable to admit substitutes. Even in 1806 one quarter of\r\nNapoleon's conscripts failed to come up for duty. The _Grande Armee_\r\nthus from its inception contained elements of doubtful value, and only\r\nthe tradition of victory and the 50% of veterans still serving aided the\r\ngenius of Napoleon to win the brilliant victories of 1805 and 1806. But\r\nthese veterans were gradually eliminated by bloodshed and service\r\nexposure, and when, after the peace of Tilsit, \"French\" armies began to\r\nbe recruited from all sorts of nations, decay had set in. As early as\r\n1806 the emperor had had to \"anticipate\" the conscription, that is, call\r\nup the conscripts before their time, and by 1810 the percentage of\r\nabsentees in France had grown to about 80, the remainder being largely\r\nthose who lacked courage to oppose the authorities. Finally, the armies\r\nof Napoleon became masses of men of all nations fighting even more\r\nunwillingly than the armies of the old regime. Little success attended\r\nthe emperor's attempt to convert a \"nation in arms\" into a great\r\ndynastic army. Considered as such, it had even fewer elements of\r\nsolidity than the standing armies of the 18th century, for it lacked the\r\ndiscipline which had made the regiments of Frederick invincible. After\r\n1812 it was attacked by huge armies of patriots which possessed\r\nadvantages of organization and skilful direction that the _levee en\r\nmasse_ of 1793 had lacked. Only the now fully developed genius and\r\nmagnificent tenacity of Napoleon staved off for a time the _debacle_\r\nwhich was as inevitable as had been that of the old regime.\r\n\r\n35. _The Grande Armee._--In 1805-1806, when the older spirit of the\r\nRevolution was already represented by one-half only of French soldiers,\r\nthe actual steadiness and manoeuvring power of the _Grande Armee_ had\r\nattained its highest level. The army at this time was organized into\r\nbrigades, divisions and corps, the last-named unit being as a rule a\r\nmarshal's command, and always completed as a small army with all the\r\nnecessary arms and services. Several such corps (usually of unequal\r\nstrength) formed the army. The greatest weakness of the organization,\r\nwhich was in other respects most pliant and adaptable, was the want of\r\ngood staff-officers. The emperor had so far cowed his marshals that few\r\nof them could take the slightest individual responsibility, and the\r\ncombatant staff-officers remained, as they had been in the 18th century,\r\neither confidential clerks or merely gallopers. No one but a Napoleon\r\ncould have managed huge armies upon these terms; in fact the marshals,\r\nfrom Berthier downwards, generally failed when in independent commands.\r\nOf the three arms, infantry and cavalry regiments were organized in much\r\nthe same way as in Frederick's day, though tactical methods were very\r\ndifferent, and discipline far inferior. The greatest advance had taken\r\nplace in the artillery service. Field and horse batteries, as organized\r\nand disciplined units, had come into general use during the\r\nRevolutionary wars, and the division, corps and army commanders had\r\nalways batteries assigned to their several commands as a permanent and\r\nintegral part of the fighting troops. Napoleon himself, and his\r\nbrilliant artillery officers Senarmont and Drouot, brought the arm to\r\nsuch a pitch of efficiency that it enabled him to win splendid victories\r\nalmost by its own action. As a typical organization we may take the III.\r\ncorps of Marshal Davout in 1806. This was formed of the following\r\ntroops:--\r\n\r\n  Cavalry brigade--General Vialannes--three regiments, 1538 men. Corps\r\n  artillery, 12 guns.\r\n\r\n  1st Division--General Morand--five infantry regiments in three\r\n  brigades, 12 guns, 10,820 men.\r\n\r\n  2nd Division--General Friant--five regiments in three brigades, 8\r\n  guns, 8758 men.\r\n\r\n  3rd Division--General Gudin--four regiments in three brigades, 12\r\n  guns, 9077 men.\r\n\r\nA comparison of this _ordre de bataille_ with that of a modern army\r\ncorps will show that the general idea of corps organization has\r\nundergone but slight modification since the days of Napoleon. More\r\ntroops allotted to departmental duties, and additional engineers for the\r\nworking of modern scientific aids, are the only new features in the\r\nformal organization of a corps in the 20th century. Yet the spirit of\r\n1806 and that of 1906 were essentially different, and the story of the\r\ndevelopment of this difference through the 19th century closes for the\r\npresent the history of progress in tactical organization.\r\n\r\n36. _The Wars of Liberation._--The Prussian defeat at Jena was followed\r\nby a national surrender so abject as to prove conclusively the eternal\r\ntruth, that a divorce of armies from national interests is completely\r\nfatal to national well-being. But the oppression of the victors soon\r\nbegan to produce a spirit of ardent patriotism which, carefully directed\r\nby a small band of able soldiers, led in the end to a national uprising\r\nof a steadier and more lasting kind than that of the French Revolution.\r\nPrussia was compelled, by the rigorous treaty of peace, to keep a small\r\nforce only under arms, and circumstances thus drove her into the path of\r\nmilitary development which she subsequently followed. The stipulation of\r\nthe treaty was evaded by the _Krumper_ system, by which men were passed\r\nthrough the ranks as hastily as possible and dismissed to the reserve,\r\ntheir places being taken by recruits. The regimental establishments were\r\ntherefore mere _cadres_, and the _personnel_, recruited by universal\r\nservice with few exemptions, ever-changing. This system depended on the\r\nwillingness of the reserves to come up when called upon, and the\r\narrogance of the French was quite sufficient to ensure this. The\r\n_denouement_ of the Napoleonic wars came too swiftly for the full\r\ndevelopment of the armed strength of Prussia on these lines; and at the\r\noutbreak of the Wars of Liberation a newly formed _Landwehr_ and\r\nnumerous volunteer corps took the field with no more training than the\r\nFrench had had in 1793. Still, the principles of universal service\r\n(_allgemeine Wehrpflicht_) and of the army reserve were, for the first\r\ntime in modern history, systematically put into action, and modern\r\nmilitary development has concerned itself more with the consolidation of\r\nthe _Krumper_ system than with the creation of another. The debut of the\r\nnew Prussian army was most unsuccessful, for Napoleon had now attained\r\nthe highest point of soldierly skill, and managed to inflict heavy\r\ndefeats on the allies. But the Prussians were not discouraged; like the\r\nFrench in 1793 they took to broken ground, and managed to win combats\r\nagainst all leaders opposed to them except Napoleon himself. The Russian\r\narmy formed a solid background for the Prussians, and in the end Austria\r\njoined the coalition. Reconstituted on modern lines, the Austrian army\r\nin 1813, except in the higher leading, was probably the best-organized\r\non the continent. After three desperate campaigns the Napoleonic regime\r\ncame to an end, and men felt that there would be no such struggle again\r\nin their lifetime. Military Europe settled down into grooves along which\r\nit ran until 1866. France, exhausted of its manhood, sought a field for\r\nmilitary activities in colonial wars waged by long-service troops. The\r\nconscription was still in force, but the citizens served most\r\nunwillingly, and substitution produced a professional army, which as\r\nusual became a dynastic tool. Austria, always menaced with foreign war\r\nand internal disorder, maintained the best army in Europe. The British\r\narmy, though employed far differently, retained substantially the\r\nPeninsular system.\r\n\r\n37. _European Armies 1815-1870._--The events of the period 1815-1859\r\nshowed afresh that such long-service armies were incomparably the best\r\nform of military machine for the purpose of giving expression to a\r\nhostile \"view\" (not \"feeling\"). Austrian armies triumphed in Italy,\r\nFrench armies in Spain, Belgium, Algeria, Italy and Russia, British in\r\ninnumerable and exacting colonial wars. Only the Prussian forces\r\nretained the characteristics of the levies of 1813, and the enthusiasm\r\nwhich had carried these through Leipzig and the other great battles was\r\nhardly to be expected of their sons, ranged on the side of despotism in\r\nthe troubled times of 1848-1850. But the principle was not permitted to\r\ndie out. The Bronnzell-Olmutz incident of 1850 (see SEVEN WEEKS' WAR)\r\nshowed that the organization of 1813 was defective, and this was altered\r\nin spite of the fiercest opposition of all classes. Soon afterwards, and\r\nbefore the new Prussian army proved itself on a great battlefield, the\r\nAmerican Civil War, a fiercer struggle than any of those which followed\r\nit in Europe, illustrated the capabilities and the weaknesses of\r\nvoluntary-service troops. Here the hostile \"view\" was replaced by a\r\nhostile \"feeling,\" and the battles of the disciplined enthusiasts on\r\neither side were of a very different kind from those of contemporary\r\nEurope. But, if the experiences of 1861-1865 proved that armies\r\nvoluntarily enlisted \"for the war\" were capable of unexcelled feats of\r\nendurance, they proved further that such armies, whose discipline and\r\ntraining in peace were relatively little, or indeed wholly absent, were\r\nincapable of forcing a swift decision. The European \"nation in arms,\"\r\nwhatever its other failings, certainly achieved its task, or failed\r\ndecisively to do so, in the shortest possible time. Only the special\r\ncharacteristics of the American theatre of war gave the Union and\r\nConfederate volunteers the space and time necessary for the creation of\r\narmies, and so the great struggle in North America passed without\r\naffecting seriously the war ideas and preparations of Europe. The\r\nweakness of the staff work with which both sides were credited helped\r\nfurther to confirm the belief of the Prussians in their system, and in\r\nthis instance they were justified by the immense superiority of their\r\nown general staff to that of any army in existence. It was in this\r\nparticular that a corps of 1870 differed so essentially from a corps of\r\nNapoleon's time. The formal organization had not been altered save as\r\nthe varying relative importance of the separate arms had dictated. The\r\nalmost intangible spirit which animates the members of a general staff,\r\ncauses them not merely to \"think\"--that was always in the\r\nquartermaster-general's department--but to \"think alike,\" so that a few\r\nsimple orders called \"directives\" sufficed to set armies in motion with\r\na definite purpose before them, whereas formerly elaborate and detailed\r\nplans of battle had to be devised and distributed in order to achieve\r\nthe object in view. A comparison of the number of orders and letters\r\nwritten by a marshal and by his chief of staff in Napoleon's time with\r\nsimilar documents in 1870 indicates clearly the changed position of the\r\nstaff. In the _Grande Armee_ and in the French army of 1870 the officers\r\nof the general staff were often absent entirely from the scene of\r\naction. In Prussia the new staff system produced a far different\r\nresult--indeed, the staff, rather than the Prussian military system, was\r\nthe actual victor of 1870. Still, the system would probably have\r\nconquered in the end in any case, and other nations, convinced by events\r\nthat their departure from the ideal of 1813, however convenient\r\nformerly, was no longer justified, promptly copied Prussia as exactly,\r\nand, as a matter of fact, as slavishly, as they had done after the Seven\r\nYears' War.\r\n\r\n38. _Modern Developments._--Since 1870, then, with the single exception\r\nof Great Britain, all the major European powers have adopted the\r\nprinciple of compulsory short service with reserves. Along with this has\r\ncome the fullest development of the territorial system (see below). The\r\nnatural consequence therefore of the heavy work falling upon the\r\nshoulders of the Prussian officer, who had to instruct his men, was, in\r\nthe first place, a general staff of the highest class, and in the\r\nsecond, a system of distributing the troops over the whole country in\r\nsuch a way that the regiments were permanently stationed in the district\r\nin which they recruited and from which they drew their reserves. Prussia\r\nrealized that if the reservists were to be obtained when required the\r\nunit must be strictly localized; France, on the contrary, lost much time\r\nand spent much trouble, in the mobilization of 1870, in forwarding the\r\nreservists to a regiment distant, perhaps, 300 m. The Prussian system\r\ndid not work satisfactorily at first, for until all the district\r\nstaff-officers were trained in the same way there was great inequality\r\nin the efficiency of the various army corps, and central control, before\r\nthe modern development of railways, was relatively slight. Further, the\r\nmobilization must be completed, or nearly so, before concentration\r\nbegins, and thus an active professional army, always at war strength,\r\nmight annihilate the frontier corps before those in the interior were\r\nready to move. But the advantages far outweighed the defects of the\r\nsystem, and, such professional armies having after 1870 disappeared,\r\nthere was little to fear. Everywhere, therefore, save in Great Britain\r\n(for at that time the United States was hardly counted as a great\r\nmilitary power, in spite of its two million war-trained veterans in\r\ncivil life), the German model was followed, and is now followed, with\r\nbut slight divergence. The period of reforms after the Prussian model\r\n(about 1873-1890) practically established the military systems which are\r\ntreated below as those of the present day. The last quarter of the\r\ncentury witnessed a very great development of military forces, without\r\nimportant organic changes. The chief interest to the student of this\r\nperiod lies in the severe competition between the great military powers\r\nfor predominance in numbers, expressed usually in the reduction of the\r\nperiod of service with the colours to a minimum. The final results of\r\nthis cannot well be predicted: it is enough to say that it is the\r\n_Leitmotiv_ in the present stage in the development of armies. Below\r\nwill be found short historical sketches of various armies of the present\r\nday which are of interest in respect of their historical development.\r\nDetails of existing forces are given in articles dealing with the\r\nseveral states to which they belong. Historical accounts of the armies\r\nof Japan and of Egypt will be found in the articles on those states. The\r\nJapanese wars of 1894-95 and 1904-5 contributed little to the history of\r\nmilitary organization as a pure science. The true lessons of this war\r\nwere the demonstration of the wide applicability of the German methods,\r\nupon which exclusively the Japanese army had formed itself, and still\r\nmore the first illustration of the new moral force of nationalities as\r\nthe decisive factor. The form of armies remained unaltered. Neither the\r\nevents of the Boer War of 1899-1902 nor the Manchurian operations were\r\nheld by European soldiers to warrant any serious modifications in\r\norganization. It is to the moral force alluded to above, rather than to\r\nmere technical improvements, that the best soldiers of Europe, and\r\nnotably those of the French general staff (see the works of General H.\r\nBonnal), have of late years devoted their most earnest attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT-DAY ARMIES\r\n\r\n39. The main principles of all military organization as developed in\r\nhistory would seem to be national recruiting and allegiance, distinctive\r\nmethods of training and administration, continuity of service and\r\ngeneral homogeneity of form. The method of raising men is of course\r\ndifferent in different states. In this regard armies may conveniently be\r\nclassed as voluntarily enlisted, levied or conscript, and militia,\r\nrepresented respectively by the forces of Great Britain, Germany and\r\nSwitzerland. It must not be forgotten, however, that voluntary troops\r\nmay be and are maintained even in states in which the bulk of the army\r\nis levied by compulsion, and the simple militia obligation of defending\r\nthe country is universally recognized.\r\n\r\n40. _Compulsory Service._--Universal liability to service (_allgemeine\r\nWehrpflicht_) draws into the active army all, or nearly all, the men of\r\nmilitary age for a continuous period of short service, after which they\r\npass successively to the reserve, the second and the third line troops\r\n(_Landwehr, Landsturm_, &c.). In this way the greatest number of\r\nsoldiers is obtained at the cheapest rate and the number of trained men\r\nin reserve available to keep the army up to strength is in theory that\r\nof the able-bodied manhood of the country. In practice the annual levy\r\nis, however, not exhaustive, and increased numerical strength is\r\nobtained by reducing the term of colour-service to a minimum. This may\r\nbe less in a hard-worked conscript army than in one which depends upon\r\nthe attractions of the service to induce recruits to join. In conscript\r\narmies, training for war is carried out with undeviating rigour. In\r\nthese circumstances the recruits are too numerous and the time available\r\nis too limited for the work of training to be committed to a few\r\nselected instructors, and every officer has therefore to instruct his\r\nown men. The result is usually a corps of officers whose capacity is\r\nbeyond question, while the general staff is composed of men whose\r\nability is above a high general average. As to the rank and file, the\r\nmen taken for service are in many respects the best of the nation, and\r\nthis superiority is progressively enhanced, since increase of population\r\nis not often accompanied by a corresponding increase in the military\r\nestablishments. In Germany in 1905, it is stated, nearly half the\r\ncontingent was excused from serving in peace time, over and above the\r\nusual numbers exempted or medically rejected. The financial aspect of\r\ncompulsory service may be summed up in a few words. The state does not\r\noffer a wage, the pay of the soldier is a mere trifle, and, for a given\r\nexpenditure, at least three times as many men may be kept under arms as\r\nunder any known \"voluntary\" system. Above all, the state has at its\r\ndisposal for war an almost inexhaustible supply of trained soldiers.\r\nThis aspect of compulsory service has indeed led its admirers sometimes\r\nto sacrifice quality to quantity; but, provided always that the regular\r\ntraining is adequate, it may be admitted that there is no limit to the\r\nnumbers which are susceptible of useful employment. There are, however,\r\nmany grave defects inherent in all armies raised by compulsory levy (see\r\nCONSCRIPTION, for a discussion of the chief economical and social\r\nquestions involved). Most of the advantages of universal service result,\r\nnot from the compulsory enlistment, but from the principle of short\r\nservice and reserves. But the cost of maintaining huge armies of the\r\nmodern European type on the voluntary system would be entirely\r\nprohibitive, and those nations which have adopted the _allgemeine\r\nWehrpflicht_ have done so with full cognizance of the evil as well as of\r\nthe good points of the system.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these evils is the doubtful element which exists in all\r\nsuch armies. Under the merciless discipline of the old regime the most\r\nunwilling men feared their officers more than the enemy. Modern short\r\nservice, however, demands the good-will of all ranks and may fail\r\naltogether to make recalcitrants into good soldiers, and it may be taken\r\nfor granted that every conscript army contains many men who cannot be\r\ninduced to fight. Herein lies the justification of the principle of\r\n\"masses,\" and of reduced colour-service; by drawing into the ranks the\r\nmaximum number of men, the government has an eventual residuum of the\r\nbravest men in the nation left in the ranks. What has been said of the\r\nofficers of these armies cannot be applied to the non-commissioned\r\nofficers. Their promotion is necessarily rapid, and the field of\r\nselection is restricted to those men who are willing to re-engage, i.e.\r\nto serve beyond their compulsory term of two or three years. Many men do\r\nso to avoid the struggles of civil life, and such \"fugitive and\r\ncloistered virtue\" scarcely fosters the moral strength required for\r\ncommand. As the best men return to civil life, there is no choice but to\r\npromote inferior men, and the latter, when invested with authority, not\r\ninfrequently abuse it. Indeed in some armies the soldier regards his\r\nofficer chiefly as his protector from the rapacity or cruelty of his\r\nsergeant or corporal. A true short-service army is almost incapable of\r\nbeing employed on peace service abroad; quite apart from other\r\nconsiderations, the cost of conveying to and from home annually\r\none-third or one-half of the troops would be prohibitive. If, as must be\r\nthe case, a professional force is maintained for oversea service many\r\nmen would join it who would otherwise be serving as non-commissioned\r\nofficers at home and the prevailing difficulty would thus be enhanced.\r\nWhen colonial defence calls for relatively large numbers of men, i.e. an\r\narmy, home resources are severely strained.\r\n\r\n41. _Conscription_ in the proper sense, i.e. selection by lot of a\r\nproportion of the able-bodied manhood of a country, is now rarely\r\npractised. The obvious unfairness of selection by lot has always had the\r\nresult of admitting substitutes procured by those on whom the lot has\r\nfallen; hence the poorer classes are unduly burdened with the defence of\r\nthe country, while the rich escape with a money payment. In practice,\r\nconscription invariably produces a professional long-service army in\r\nwhich each soldier is paid to discharge the obligations of several\r\nsuccessive conscripts. Such an army is therefore a voluntary\r\nlong-service army in the main, _plus_ a proportion of the unwilling men\r\nfound in every forced levy. The gravest disadvantage is, however, the\r\nfact that the bulk of the nation has not been through the regular army\r\nat all; it is almost impossible to maintain a large and costly standing\r\narmy and at the same time to give a full training to auxiliary forces.\r\nThe difference between a \"national guard\" such as that of the siege of\r\nParis in 1870-71 and a _Landwehr_ produced under the German system, was\r\nvery wide. Regarded as a compromise between universal and voluntary\r\nservice, conscription still maintains a precarious existence in Europe.\r\nAs the cardinal principle of recruiting armies, it is completely\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n42. _Voluntary Service._--Existing voluntary armies have usually\r\ndeveloped from armies of the old regime, and seem to owe their continued\r\nexistence either to the fact that only comparatively small armaments are\r\nmaintained in peace, other and larger armies being specially recruited\r\nduring a war (a modification of the \"enlistment system\"), or to the\r\nnecessities of garrisoning colonial empires. The military advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of voluntary service are naturally the faults and merits\r\nof the opposite system. The voluntary army is available for general\r\nservice. It includes few unwilling soldiers, and its resultant advantage\r\nover an army of the ordinary type has been stated to be as high as 30%.\r\nAt all events, we need only examine military history to find that with\r\nconscript armies wholesale shirking is far from unknown. That loss from\r\nthis cause does not paralyse operations as it paralysed those of the\r\n18th century, is due to the fact that such fugitives do not desert to\r\nthe enemy, but reappear in the ranks of their own side; it must not\r\ntherefore be assumed that men have become braver because the \"missing\"\r\nare not so numerous. In colonial and savage warfare the superior\r\npersonal qualities of the voluntary soldier often count for more than\r\nskill on the part of the officers. These would be diminished by\r\nshortening the time of service, and this fact, with the expense of\r\ntransport, entails that a reasonably long period must be spent with the\r\ncolours. On the other hand, the provision of the large armies of modern\r\nwarfare requires the maintenance of a reserve, and no reserve is\r\npossible if the whole period for which men will enlist is spent with the\r\ncolours. The demand for long service in the individual, and for trained\r\nmen in the aggregate, thus produces a compromise. The principle of long\r\nservice, i.e. ten years or more with the colours, is not applicable to\r\nthe needs of the modern _grande guerre_; it gives neither great initial\r\nstrength nor great reserves. The force thus produced is costly and not\r\nlightly to be risked; it affords relatively little opportunity for the\r\ntraining of officers, and tends to become a class apart from the rest of\r\nthe population. On the other hand, such a force is the best possible\r\narmy for foreign and colonial service. A state therefore which relies on\r\nvoluntary enlistment for its forces at home and abroad, must either keep\r\nan army which is adaptable to both functions or maintain a separate\r\nservice for each.\r\n\r\nIn a state where relatively small armaments are maintained in peace,\r\nvoluntary armies are infinitely superior to any that could be obtained\r\nunder any system of compulsion. The state can afford to give a good\r\nwage, and can therefore choose its recruits carefully. It can thus have\r\neither a few incomparable veteran soldiers (long-service), or a fairly\r\nlarge number of men of superior physique and intelligence, who have\r\nreceived an adequate short-service training. Even the youngest of such\r\nmen are capable of good service, while the veterans are probably better\r\nsoldiers than any to be found in conscript armies. This is, however, a\r\nspecial case. The raw material of any but a small voluntary army usually\r\ntends to be drawn from inferior sources; the cost of a larger force,\r\npaid the full wages of skilled labourers, would be very great, and\r\nnumbers commensurate with those of an army of the other model could only\r\nbe obtained at an exorbitant price. The short-service principle is\r\ntherefore accepted. Here, however, as recruiting depends upon the\r\ngood-will of the people, it is impossible to work the soldiers with any\r\ndegree of rigour. Hence the voluntary soldier must serve longer than a\r\nconscript in order to attain the same proficiency. The reserve is thus\r\nweakened, and the total trained regular force diminished. Moreover, as\r\nfewer recruits are required annually, there is less work for the\r\nofficers to do. In the particular case of Great Britain it is\r\npractically certain that in future, reliance will be placed upon the\r\nauxiliary forces and the civil population for the provision of the\r\nenormous reserves required in a great war; this course is, however, only\r\nfeasible in the case of an insular nation which has time to collect its\r\nstrength for the final and decisive blow overseas. The application of\r\nthe same principle to a continental military power depends on the\r\ncapacity for stern and unflagging resistance displayed by the _corps de\r\ncouverture_ charged with the duty of gaining the time necessary for the\r\ndevelopment and concentration of the national masses. In Great Britain\r\n(except in the case of a surprise invasion) the place of this corps\r\nwould be taken by \"command of the sea.\" Abroad, the spirit of the\r\nexposed regiments themselves furnishes the only guarantee, and this can\r\nhardly be calculated with sufficient certainty, under modern conditions,\r\nto justify the adoption of this new \"enlistment system.\" Voluntary\r\nservice, therefore, with all its intrinsic merits, is only applicable to\r\nthe conditions of a great war when the war reserve can be trained _ad\r\nhoc_.\r\n\r\n43. The militia idea (see MILITIA) has been applied most completely in\r\nSwitzerland, which has no regular army, but trains almost the whole\r\nnation as a militia. The system, with many serious disadvantages, has\r\nthe great merit that the maximum number of men receives a certain amount\r\nof training at a minimum cost both to the state and to the individual.\r\nMention should also be made of the system of augmenting the national\r\nforces by recruiting \"foreign legions.\" This is, of course, a relic of\r\nthe _Werbe-system_; it was practised habitually by the British\r\ngovernments of the 18th and early 19th centuries. \"Hessians\" figured\r\nconspicuously in the British armies in the American War of Independence,\r\nand the \"King's German Legion\" was only the best and most famous of many\r\nforeign corps in the service of George III. during the Revolutionary and\r\nNapoleonic wars. A new German Legion was raised during the Crimean War,\r\nbut the almost universal adoption of the _Krumper_ system has naturally\r\nput an end to the old method, for all the best recruits are now\r\naccounted for in the service of their own countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n44. _Arms of the Service._--Organization into \"arms\" is produced by the\r\nmultiplicity of the weapons used, their functions and their limitations.\r\nThe \"three arms\"--a term universally applied to infantry (q.v.), cavalry\r\n(q.v.) and artillery (q.v.)--coexist owing to the fact that each can\r\nundertake functions which the others cannot properly fulfil. Thus\r\ncavalry can close with an enemy at the quickest pace, infantry can work\r\nin difficult ground, and artillery is effective at great ranges.\r\nInfantry indeed, having the power of engaging both at close quarters and\r\nat a distance, constitutes the chief part of a fighting force. Other\r\n\"arms,\" such as mounted infantry, cyclists, engineers, &c., are again\r\ndifferentiated from the three chief arms by their proper functions. In\r\ndeciding upon the establishment in peace, or the composition of a force\r\nfor war, it is therefore necessary to settle beforehand the relative\r\nimportance of these functions in carrying out the work in hand. Thus an\r\narmy operating in Essex would be unusually strong in infantry, one on\r\nSalisbury Plain would possess a great number of guns, and an army\r\noperating on the South African veldt would consist very largely of\r\nmounted men. The normal European war has, however, naturally been taken\r\nas the basis upon which the relative proportions of the three arms are\r\ncalculated. At the battle of Kolin (1757) the cavalry was more than half\r\nas strong as the infantry engaged. At Borodino (1812) there were 39\r\ncavalry to 100 of other arms, and 5 guns per 1000 men. In 1870 the\r\nGermans had at the outset 7 cavalrymen to every 100 men of other arms,\r\nthe French 10. As for guns, the German artillery had 3, the French 3-1/2\r\nper 1000 men. In more modern times the proportions have undergone some\r\nalteration, the artillery having been increased, and the cavalry brought\r\nnearer to the Napoleonic standard. Thus the relative proportions, in\r\npeace time, now stand at 5 or 6 guns per 1000 men, and 16 cavalry\r\nsoldiers to 100 men of other arms. It must be borne in mind that cavalry\r\nand artillery are maintained in peace at a higher effective than\r\ninfantry, the strength of the latter being much inflated in war, while\r\ncavalry and artillery are not easily extemporized. Thus in the\r\nManchurian campaign these proportions were very different. The Russian\r\narmy on the eve of the battle of Mukden (20th of February 1905)\r\nconsisted of 370 battalions, 142 squadrons and 153 field batteries (1200\r\nguns), with, in addition, over 200 heavy guns. The strength of this\r\nforce, which was organized in three armies, was about 300,000 infantry\r\nand 18,000 cavalry and Cossacks, with 3-1/2 guns per 1000 men of other\r\narms. The Japanese armies consisted of 300,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry,\r\n900 field and 170 heavy guns, the proportion of field artillery being\r\n2-1/2 guns per 1000 men.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not superfluous to mention that all the smaller units in a\r\nmodern army consist of one arm only. Formerly several dissimilar weapons\r\nwere combined in the same unit. The knight with his four or five\r\nvariously armed retainers constituted an example of this method of\r\norganization, which slowly died out as weapons became more uniform and\r\ntheir functions better defined.\r\n\r\n45. _Command._--The first essential of a good organization is to ensure\r\nthat each member of the organized body, in his own sphere of action,\r\nshould contribute his share to the achievement of the common object.\r\nFurther, it is entirely beyond the power of one man, or of a few, to\r\ncontrol every action and provide for every want of a great number of\r\nindividuals. The modern system of command, therefore, provides for a\r\nsystem of grades, in which, theoretically, officers of each grade\r\ncontrol a group of the next lower units. A lieutenant-colonel, for\r\ninstance, may be in charge of a group of eight companies, each of which\r\nis under a captain. In practice, all armies are permanently organized on\r\nthese lines, up to the colonel's or lieutenant-colonel's command, and\r\nmost of them are permanently divided into various higher units under\r\ngeneral officers, the brigade, division and army corps. The almost\r\ninvariable practice is to organize _infantry_ into companies, battalions\r\nand regiments. _Cavalry_ is divided into troops, squadrons and\r\nregiments. _Artillery_ is organized in batteries, these being usually\r\ngrouped in various ways. The other arms and departments are subdivided\r\nin the same general way. The commands of general officers are the\r\n_brigade_ of infantry, cavalry, and in some cases artillery, the\r\n_division_ of two or more infantry brigades and a force of artillery and\r\nmounted troops, or of cavalry and horse artillery, and the _army corps_\r\nof two or more divisions and \"corps troops.\" _Armies_ of several corps,\r\nand _groups of armies_ are also formed.\r\n\r\n46. A _brigade_ is the command of a brigadier or major-general, or of a\r\ncolonel. It consists almost invariably of one arm only. In armies of the\r\nold regime it was not usual to assign troops of all arms to the\r\nsubordinate generals. Hence the brigade is a much older form of\r\norganization than the division of all arms, and in fact dates from the\r\n16th century. The infantry brigade consists, in the British service, of\r\nthe brigadier and his staff, four battalions of infantry, and\r\nadministrative and medical units, the combatant strength being about\r\n4000 men. In Germany and France the brigade is composed of the staff,\r\nand two regiments (6 battalions) with a total of over 6000 combatants at\r\nwar strength. The cavalry brigade is sometimes formed of three,\r\nsometimes of two regiments; the number of squadrons to a regiment on\r\nservice is usually four, exceptionally three, and rarely five and six.\r\nThe \"brigade\" of artillery in Great Britain is a lieutenant-colonel's\r\ncommand, and the term here corresponds to the _Abtheilung_ of the\r\nGerman, and the _groupe_ of the French armies (see ARTILLERY). In\r\nGermany and France, however, an artillery brigade consists of two or\r\nmore regiments, or twelve batteries at least, under the command of an\r\nartillery general officer.\r\n\r\n47. A _division_ is an organization containing troops of all arms. Since\r\nthe virtual abolition of the \"corps artillery\" (see ARTILLERY), the\r\nforce of field artillery forming part of an infantry division is\r\nsometimes as high as 72 guns (Germany); in Great Britain the augmented\r\ndivision of 1906 has 54 field guns, 12 field howitzers, and 4 heavy\r\nguns, a total of 70. The term \"infantry\" division is, in strictness, no\r\nlonger applicable, since such a unit is a miniature army corps of\r\ninfantry, artillery and cavalry, with the necessary services for the\r\nsupply of ammunition, food and forage, and for the care of the sick and\r\nwounded. A more exact title would be \"army\" division. In general it is\r\ncomposed, so far as combatants are concerned, of the divisional\r\ncommander and his staff, two or more infantry brigades, a number of\r\nbatteries of field artillery forming a regiment, brigade or group, a\r\nsmall force, varying from a squadron to a regiment, of cavalry\r\n(divisional cavalry), with some engineers. The force of the old British\r\ndivision (1905) may be taken, on an average, as 10,000 men, increased in\r\nthe 1906 reorganization to about 15,000 combatants. In other armies the\r\nfighting force of the division amounts to rather more than 14,000. The\r\n_cavalry division_ (see CAVALRY) is composed of the staff, two or three\r\ncavalry brigades, horse artillery, with perhaps mounted infantry,\r\ncyclists, or even light infantry in addition. In many, if not most,\r\narmies cavalry divisions are formed only in war. In the field the\r\ncavalry division is usually an independent unit with its own commander\r\nand staff. \"Cavalry corps\" of several divisions have very rarely been\r\nformed in the past, a division having been regarded as the largest unit\r\ncapable of being led by one man. There is, however, a growing tendency\r\nin favour of the corps organization, at any rate in war.\r\n\r\n48. _Army Corps._--The \"corps\" of the 18th century was simply a large\r\ndetachment, more or less complete in itself, organized for some\r\nparticular purpose (e.g. to cover a siege), and placed for the time\r\nbeing under some general officer other than the chief commander. The\r\nmodern army corps is a development from the division of all arms, which\r\noriginated in the French Revolutionary wars. It is a unit of\r\nconsiderable strength, furnished with the due proportion of troops of\r\nall arms and of the auxiliary and medical services, and permanently\r\nplaced under the command of one general. The corps organization (though\r\na _corps d'armee_ was often spoken of as an _armee_) was used in\r\nNapoleon's army in all the campaigns of the Empire. It may be mentioned,\r\nas a curious feature of Napoleon's methods, that he invariably\r\nconstituted each _corps d'armee_ of a different strength, so that the\r\nenemy would not be able to estimate his force by the simple process of\r\ncounting the corps flags which marked the marshals' headquarters. Thus\r\nin 1812 he constituted one corps of 72,000 men, while another had but\r\n18,000. After the fall of Napoleon a further advance was made. The\r\nadoption of universal service amongst the great military nations brought\r\nin its train the territorial organization, and the corps, representing a\r\nlarge district, soon became a unit of peace formation. For the smooth\r\nworking of the new military system it was essential that the framework\r\nof the war army should exist in peace. The Prussians were the first to\r\nbring the system to perfection; long before 1866 Prussia was permanently\r\ndivided into army corps districts, all the troops of the III. army corps\r\nbeing Brandenburgers, all those of the VI. Silesians, and so on, though\r\npolitical reasons required, and to some extent still require,\r\nmodifications of this principle in dealing with annexed territory (e.g.\r\nHanover and Alsace-Lorraine). The events of 1866 and of 1870-71 caused\r\nthe almost universal adoption of the army corps regional system. In the\r\ncase of the British army, operating as it usually did in minor wars, and\r\nrarely having more than sixty or seventy thousand men on one theatre\r\neven in continental wars, there was less need of so large a unit as the\r\ncorps. Not only was a British army small in numbers, but it preserved\r\nhigh traditions of discipline, and was sufficiently well trained to be\r\nsusceptible as a unit to the impulse given by one man. Even where the\r\nterm \"corps\" does appear in Peninsular annals, the implication is of a\r\ncorps in the old sense of a grand detachment. Neither cavalry nor\r\nartillery was assigned to any of the British \"corps\" at Waterloo.\r\n\r\n49. _Constitution of the Army Corps._--In 1870-71 the III. German army\r\ncorps (with which compare Marshal Davout's _ordre de bataille_ above)\r\nconsisted of the following combatant units: (a) staff; (b) two infantry\r\ndivisions (4 brigades. 8 regiments or 24 battalions), with, in each\r\ndivision, a cavalry regiment, 4 batteries of artillery or 24 guns, and\r\nengineers; (c) corps troops, artillery (6 field batteries), pioneer\r\nbattalion (engineers), train battalion (supply and transport). A rifle\r\nbattalion was attached to one of the divisions.\r\n\r\nThis _ordre de bataille_ was followed more or less generally by all\r\ncountries up to the most modern times, but between 1890 and 1902 came a\r\nvery considerable change in the point of view from which the corps was\r\nregarded as a fighting unit. This change was expressed in the abolition\r\nof the corps artillery. Formerly the corps commander controlled the\r\ngreater part of the field artillery, as well as troops of other arms; at\r\nthe present time he has a mere handful of troops. Unless battalions are\r\ntaken from the divisions to form a corps reserve, the direct influence\r\nof the corps organization on the battle is due almost solely to the fact\r\nthat the commander has at his disposal the special natures of artillery\r\nand also some horse artillery. Thus the (augmented) division is regarded\r\nby many as the fighting unit of the 20th, as the corps was that of the\r\n19th century. In Europe there is even a tendency to substitute the\r\nancient phrase \"reserve artillery\" for \"corps artillery,\" showing that\r\nthe role to be played by the corps batteries is subordinated to the\r\noperations of the masses of divisional artillery, the whole being\r\nsubject, of course, to the technical supervision of the artillery\r\ngeneral officer who accompanies the corps headquarters. Thus limited,\r\nthe army corps has now come to consist of the staff, two or more\r\ndivisions, the corps or reserve artillery (of special batteries), a\r\nsmall force of \"corps\" cavalry, and various technical and departmental\r\ntroops. The cavalry is never very numerous, owing to the demands of the\r\nindependent cavalry divisions on the one hand and those of the\r\ndivisional cavalry on the other. The engineers of an army corps include\r\ntelegraph, balloon and pontoon units. Attached to the corps are reserves\r\nof munitions and supplies in ammunition columns, field parks, supply\r\nparks, &c. The term and the organization were discontinued in England in\r\n1906, on the augmentation of the divisions and the assignment of certain\r\nformer \"corps troops\" to the direct control of the army commanders. It\r\nshould be noticed that the Japanese, who had no corps organization\r\nduring the war of 1904-5, afterwards increased the strength of their\r\ndivisions from 15,000 to 20,000; the augmented \"division,\" with the\r\nabove _peace_ strength, becomes to all intents and purposes a corps, and\r\nthe generals commanding divisions were in 1906 given the title of\r\ngenerals-in-chief.\r\n\r\n50. _Army._--The term \"army\" is applied, in war time, to any command of\r\nseveral army corps, or even of several divisions, operating under the\r\norders of one commander-in-chief. The army in this sense (distinguished\r\nby a number or by a special title) varies, therefore, with\r\ncircumstances. In the American Civil War, the Army of the Ohio consisted\r\nin 1864 only of the army staff and the XXIII. corps. At the other\r\nextreme we find that the German II. Army in 1870 consisted of seven army\r\ncorps and two cavalry divisions, and the III. Army of six army corps and\r\ntwo cavalry divisions. The term \"army\" in this sense is therefore very\r\nelastic in its application, but it is generally held that large groups\r\nof corps operating in one theatre of war should be subdivided into\r\narmies, and that the strength of an army should not exceed about 150,000\r\nmen, if indeed this figure is reached at all. This again depends upon\r\ncircumstances. It might be advisable to divide a force of five corps\r\ninto two armies, or on the other hand it might be impossible to find\r\nsuitable leaders for more than two armies when half a million men were\r\npresent for duty. In France, organization has been carried a step\r\nfurther. The bulk of the national forces is, in case of war, organized\r\ninto a \"group of armies\" under a commander, usually, though incorrectly,\r\ncalled the _generalissimo_. This office, of course, does not exist in\r\npeace, but the insignia, the distinctive marks of the headquarters flag,\r\n&c., are stated in official publications, and the names of the\r\ngeneralissimo and of his chief of staff are known. Under the\r\ngeneralissimo would be four or five army commanders, each with three or\r\nfour army corps under him. Independent of this \"group of armies\" there\r\nwould be other and minor \"armies\" where required.\r\n\r\n51. _Chief Command._--The leading of the \"group of armies\" referred to\r\nabove does not, in France, imply the supreme command, which would be\r\nexercised by the minister of war in Paris. The German system, on the\r\nother hand, is based upon the leadership of the national forces by the\r\nsovereign in person, and even though the headquarters of the \"supreme\r\nwar lord\" (_Oberste Kriegsherr_) are actually in the field in one\r\ntheatre of operations, he directs the movements of the German armies in\r\nall quarters. Similarly, in 1864, General Grant accompanied and\r\ncontrolled as a \"group\" the Armies of the Potomac and the James,\r\nsupervising at the same time the operations of other groups and armies.\r\nIn the same campaign a subordinate general, Sherman, commanded a \"group\"\r\nconsisting of the Armies of the Tennessee, the Cumberland and the Ohio.\r\nThe question as to whether the supreme command and the command of the\r\nprincipal group of armies should be in the same hands is very difficult\r\nof solution. In practice, the method adopted in each case usually grows\r\nout of the military and political conditions. The advantage of the\r\nGerman method is that the supreme commander is in actual contact with\r\nthe troops, and can therefore form an accurate judgment of their powers.\r\nUnder these conditions the risk of having cabinet strategy forced upon\r\nthe generals is at its minimum, and more especially so if the supreme\r\ncommander is the head of the state. On the other hand, his judgment is\r\nvery liable to be influenced unduly by facts, coming under his own\r\nnotice, which may in reality have no more than a local significance.\r\nFurther, the supreme commander is at the mercy of distant subordinates\r\nto a far greater degree than he would be if free to go from one army to\r\nanother. Thus, in 1870 the king of Prussia's headquarters before Paris\r\nwere subjected to such pressure from subordinate army commanders that on\r\nseveral occasions selected staff-officers had to be sent to examine, for\r\nthe king's private information, the real state of things at the front.\r\nThe conduct of operations by one group commander in the campaign of 1864\r\nseemed, at a distance, so eccentric and dangerous that General Grant\r\nactually left his own group of armies and went in person to take over\r\ncommand at the threatened point. Balanced judgment is thus often\r\nimpossible unless the supreme command is independent of, and in a\r\nposition to exercise general supervision over, each and every group or\r\narmy. At the other end of the scale is the system of command employed by\r\nthe Turks in 1877, in which four armies, three of them being actually on\r\nthe same theatre of war, were directed from Constantinople. This system\r\nmay be condemned unreservedly. It is recognized that, once the armies on\r\neither side have become seriously engaged, a commander-in-chief on the\r\nspot must direct them. Thus in 1904, while the Japanese and Russian\r\narmies were under the supreme command of their respective sovereigns,\r\nGeneral Kuropatkin and Marshal Oyama personally commanded the chief\r\ngroups of armies in the field. This is substantially the same as the\r\nsystem of the French army. It is therefore permissible to regard the\r\nsystem pursued by the Germans in 1870, and by the Union government in\r\n1864, more as suited to special circumstances than as a general rule. As\r\nhas been said above, the special feature of the German system of command\r\nis the personal leadership of the German emperor, and this brings the\r\nstudent at once to the consideration of another important part of the\r\n\"superior leading.\"\r\n\r\n52. The _Chief of the General Staff_ is, as his title implies, the chief\r\nstaff officer of the service, and as such, he has duties of the highest\r\npossible importance, both in peace and war. For the general subject of\r\nstaff duties see STAFF. Here we are concerned only with the peculiar\r\nposition of the chief of staff under a system in which the sovereign is\r\nthe actual commander-in-chief. It is obvious in the first place that the\r\nsovereign may not be a great soldier, fitted by mental gifts, training\r\nand character to be placed at the head of an army of, perhaps, a million\r\nmen. Allowing that it is imperative that, whatever he may be in himself,\r\nthe sovereign should _ex officio_ command the armies, it is easy to see\r\nthat the ablest general in these armies must be selected to act as his\r\nadviser, irrespective of rank and seniority. This officer must therefore\r\nbe assigned to a station beyond that of his army rank, and his orders\r\nare in fact those of the sovereign himself. Nor is it sufficient that he\r\nshould occupy an unofficial position as adviser, or _ad latus_. If he\r\nwere no more than this, the sovereign could act without his adviser\r\nbeing even aware of the action taken. As the staff is the machinery for\r\nthe transmission of orders and despatches, all orders of the\r\ncommander-in-chief are signed by the chief of staff as a matter of\r\ncourse, and this position is therefore that in which the adviser has the\r\nnecessary influence. The relations between the sovereign and his chief\r\nmilitary adviser are thus of the first importance to the smooth working\r\nof the great military machine, and never have the possibilities of this\r\napparently strange system been more fully exploited than by King William\r\nand his chief of staff von Moltke in 1866 and in 1870-71. It is not true\r\nto say that the king was the mere figurehead of the German armies, or\r\nthat Moltke was the real commander-in-chief. Those who have said this\r\nforget that the sole responsibility for the consequences of every order\r\nlay with the king, and that it is precisely the fear of this\r\nresponsibilty that has made so many brilliant subordinates fail when in\r\nchief command. The characters of the two men supplemented each other, as\r\nalso in the case of Blucher and Gneisenau and that of Radetzky and Hess.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the German system of command works, on the\r\nwhole, smoothly. Matters would, however, be different if either of the\r\ntwo officers failed to realize their mutual interdependence, and the\r\nsystem is in any case only required when the self-sufficing great\r\nsoldier is not available for the chief executive command.\r\n\r\n53. _First and Second Lines._--The organization into arms and units is\r\nof course maintained in peace as well as for war. Military forces are\r\nfurther organized, in peace, into active and reserve troops, first and\r\nsecond lines, &c., according to the power possessed by the executive\r\nover the men. Broadly speaking, the latter fall into three classes,\r\nregulars, auxiliary forces and irregular troops. The regulars or active\r\ntroops are usually liable to serve at all times and in any country to\r\nwhich they may be sent. Auxiliary forces may be defined as all troops\r\nwhich undergo actual military training without being constantly under\r\narms, and in Great Britain these were until 1908 represented by the\r\nMilitia, the Yeomanry and the Volunteers, and now by the Territorial\r\nForce and the Special Reserve. In a country in which recruiting is by\r\nvoluntary enlistment the classification is, of course, very different\r\nfrom that prevailing in a conscript army. The various \"lines\" are\r\nusually composed of separate organizations; the men are recruited upon\r\ndifferent engagements, and receive a varying amount of training. Of the\r\nmen not permanently embodied, only the reserve of the active army has\r\nactually served a continuous term with the colours. Other troops, called\r\nby various appellations, of which \"militia\" may be taken as generic, go\r\nthrough their military training at intervals. The general lines of army\r\norganization in the case of a country recruiting by universal service\r\nare as follows:--The male population is divided into classes, by ages,\r\nand the total period of liability to service is usually about 25 years.\r\nThus at any given time, assuming two years' colour-service, the men of\r\n20 and 21 years of age would constitute the active army serving with the\r\ncolours, those of, say, 22 and 23, the reserve. The _Landwehr_ or second\r\nline army would consist of all men who had been through the active army\r\nand were now aged 24 to 36. The third line would similarly consist of\r\nmen whose ages were between 36 and 44. Assuming the same annual levy,\r\nthe active army would consist of 200,000 men, its reserve 200,000, the\r\nsecond line of 1,300,000, and the third of 800,000. Thus of 2,500,000\r\nmen liable to, and trained for, military service, 200,000 only would be\r\nunder arms at any given time. The simple system here outlined is of\r\ncourse modified and complicated in practice owing to re-engagements by\r\nnon-commissioned officers, the speedy dismissal to the reserve of\r\nintelligent and educated men, &c.\r\n\r\n54. _War Reserves._--In war, the reserves increase the field armies to\r\n400,000 men, the whole or part of the second line is called up and\r\nformed into auxiliary regiments, brigades and divisions, and in case of\r\nnecessity the third line is also called upon, though usually this is\r\nonly in the last resort and for home defence only. The proportion of\r\nreservists to men with the colours varies of course with the length of\r\nservice. Thus in France or Germany, with two years' service in force,\r\nhalf of the rank and file of a unit in war would be men recalled from\r\ncivil life. The true military value of reservists is often questioned,\r\nand under certain circumstances it is probable that units would take the\r\nfield at peace strength without waiting for their reservists. The\r\nfrontier guards of the continental military powers, which are expected\r\nto move at the earliest possible moment after hostilities have begun,\r\nare maintained at a higher effective than other units, and do not depend\r\nto any great extent on receiving reservists. The peace footing of\r\ncavalry and artillery units is similarly maintained at an artificial\r\nlevel. An operation of the nature of a _coup de main_ would in any case\r\nbe carried out by the troops available at the moment, however large\r\nmight be the force required--twenty weak battalions would, in fact, be\r\nemployed instead of ten strong ones. There is another class of troops,\r\nwhich may be called depot troops. These consist of officers and men left\r\nbehind when the active corps completed with reserves takes the field,\r\nand they have (a) to furnish drafts for the front--and (b) to form a\r\nnucleus upon which all later formations are built up. The troops of the\r\nsecond line undertake minor work, such as guarding railways, and also\r\nfurnish drafts for the field army. Later, when they have been for some\r\ntime under arms, the second line troops are often employed by themselves\r\nin first line. A year's training under war conditions should bring such\r\ntroops to the highest efficiency. As for irregulars, they have real\r\nmilitary value only when the various permanent establishments do not\r\ntake up the whole fighting strength of the nation, and thus states\r\nhaving universal service armies do not, as a rule, contemplate the\r\nemployment of combatants other than those shown on the peace rolls. The\r\nstatus of irregulars is ill defined, but it is practically agreed that\r\ncombatants, over whose conduct the military authorities have no\r\ndisciplinary power, should be denied the privileges of recognized\r\nsoldiers, and put to death if captured. So drastic a procedure is\r\nnaturally open to abuse and is not always expedient. Still, it is\r\nperfectly right that the same man shall not be allowed, for example, to\r\nshoot a sentry at one moment, and to claim the privileges of a harmless\r\ncivilian at the next. The division into first, second and third lines\r\nfollows generally from the above. The first line troops, in a conscript\r\narmy, are the \"active army\" or regulars, permanently under arms in peace\r\ntime, and its reserves, which are used on the outbreak of war to\r\ncomplete the existing units to full strength. The German terms\r\n_Landwehr_ and _Landsturm_ are often applied to armies of the second and\r\nthe third lines.\r\n\r\n55. The military characteristics of the various types of regular troops\r\nhave been dealt with in considering the advantages and disadvantages of\r\nthe several forms of recruiting. It only remains to give some indication\r\nof the advantages which such forces (irrespective of their time of\r\nservice) possess over troops which only come up for training at\r\nintervals. Physically, the men with the colours are always superior to\r\nthe rest, owing to their constant exercise and the regularity and order\r\nunder which they live; as soldiers, they are more under the control of\r\ntheir officers, who are their leaders in daily life, in closer touch\r\nwith army methods and discipline, and, as regards their formal training,\r\nthey possess infinitely greater power of strategic and tactical\r\nmanoeuvre. Their steadiness under fire is of course more to be relied\r\nupon than that of other troops. Wellington, speaking of the contrast\r\nbetween old and young soldiers (regulars), was of opinion that the chief\r\ndifference lay in the greater hardiness, power of endurance, and general\r\ncampaigning qualities given by experience. This is of course more than\r\never true in respect of regular and auxiliary troops, as was strikingly\r\ndemonstrated in the Spanish-American War. On the whole, it is true to\r\nsay that only a regular army can endure defeat without dissolution, and\r\nthat volunteers, reservists or militiamen fresh from civil life may win\r\na victory but cannot make the fullest use of it when won. At the same\r\ntime, when they have been through one or two arduous campaigns, raw\r\ntroops become to all intents and purposes equal to any regulars. On the\r\nother hand, the greatest military virtue of auxiliary forces is their\r\nenthusiasm. With this quality were won the great victories of 1792-94 in\r\nFrance, those of 1813 in Germany, and the beginnings of Italian unity at\r\nCalatafimi and Palermo. The earlier days of the American Civil War\r\nwitnessed desperate fighting, of which Shiloh is the best example,\r\nbetween armies which had had but the slightest military training. In the\r\nsame war the first battle of Bull Run illustrated what has been said\r\nabove as to the weaknesses of unprofessional armies. Both sides, raw and\r\nuntrained, fought for a long time with the greatest determination, after\r\nwhich the defeated army was completely dissolved in rout and the victors\r\nquite unable to pursue. So far it is the relative military value of the\r\nprofessional soldier and the citizen-soldier that has been reviewed. A\r\ncontinental army of the French or German stamp is differently\r\nconstituted. It is, first of all, clear that the drilled citizen-soldier\r\ncombines the qualities of training and enthusiasm. From this it follows\r\nthat a hostile \"feeling\" as well as a hostile \"view\" must animate such\r\nan army if it is to do good service. If a modern \"nation in arms\" is\r\nengaged in a purely dynastic quarrel against a professional army of\r\ninferior strength, the result will probably be victory for the latter.\r\nBut the active army of France or Germany constitutes but a small part of\r\nthe \"nation in arms,\" and the army for war is composed in addition of\r\nmen who have at some period in the past gone through a regular training.\r\nHerein lies the difference between continental and British auxiliary\r\nforces. In the French army, an ex-soldier during his ten years of\r\nreserve service was by the law of 1905 only liable for two months'\r\ntraining, and for the rest of his military career for two weeks' service\r\nonly. The further reduction of this liability was proposed in 1907 and\r\nled to much controversy. The question of the value of auxiliary forces,\r\nthen, as between the continuous work of, say, English territorials, and\r\nthe permanent though dwindling influence of an original period of active\r\nsoldiering, is one of considerable importance. It is largely decided in\r\nany given case by the average age of the men in the ranks.\r\n\r\n56. The transfer of troops from the state of peace to that of war is\r\ncalled _mobilization_. This is, of course, a matter which primarily\r\ndepends on good administration, and its minutest details are in all\r\nstates laid down beforehand. Reservists have to be summoned, and, on\r\narrival, to be clothed and equipped out of stores maintained in peace.\r\nOfficers and men of the regular army on leave have to be recalled, the\r\nwhole medically examined for physical fitness to serve, and a thousand\r\ndetails have to be worked out before the unit is ready to move to its\r\nconcentration station. The concentration and the strategic deployment\r\nare, of course, dependent upon the circumstances of each war, and the\r\npeace organization ceases to be applicable. But throughout a war the\r\ndepots at home, the recruiting districts of second-line troops, and\r\nabove all the various arsenals, manufactories and offices controlled by\r\nthe war department are continually at work in maintaining the troops in\r\nthe field at proper strength and effectiveness.\r\n\r\n57. _Territorial System._--The feudal system was of course a territorial\r\nsystem in principle. Indeed, as has been shown above, a feudal army was\r\nchiefly at fault owing to the dislocation of the various levies.\r\nConcentration was equally the characteristic of the professional armies\r\nwhich succeeded those of feudalism, and only such militia forces as\r\nremained in existence preserved a local character. The origin of\r\nterritorial recruiting for first-line troops is to be found in the\r\n\"cantonal\" system, said to have been introduced by Louis XIV., but\r\nbrought to the greatest perfection in Prussia under Frederick William I.\r\nBut long service and the absence of a reserve vitiated the system in\r\npractice, since losses had to be made good by general recruiting, and\r\neven the French Revolution may hardly be said to have produced the\r\nterritorial system as we understand it to-day. It was only in the\r\ndeliberate preparation of the Prussian army on short-service lines that\r\nwe find the beginning of the \"territorial system of dislocation and\r\ncommand.\" This is so intimately connected with the general system of\r\norganization that it cannot be considered merely as a method of\r\nrecruiting by districts. It may be defined as a system whereby, for\r\npurposes of command in peace, recruiting, and of organization generally,\r\nthe country is divided into districts, which are again divided and\r\nsubdivided as may be required. In a country in which universal service\r\nprevails, an army corps district is divided into divisional districts,\r\nthese being made up of brigade and of regimental districts. Each of\r\nthese units recruits, and is in peace usually stationed, in its own\r\narea; the artillery, cavalry and special arms are recruited for the\r\ncorps throughout the whole allotted area, and stationed at various\r\npoints within the same. Thus in the German army the III. army corps is\r\ncomposed entirely of Brandenburgers. The infantry of the corps is\r\nstationed in ten towns, the cavalry in four and the artillery in five.\r\nIn countries which adhere to voluntary recruiting, the system, depending\r\nas it does on the calculable certainty of recruiting, is not so fully\r\ndeveloped, but in Great Britain the auxiliary forces have been\r\nreorganized in divisions of all arms on a strictly territorial basis.\r\nThe advantage of the system as carried into effect in Germany is\r\nobvious. Training is carried out with a minimum of friction and expense,\r\nas each unit has an ample area for training. Whilst the brigadiers can\r\nexercise general control over the colonels, and the divisional generals\r\nover the brigadiers, there is little undue interference of superior\r\nauthority in the work of each grade, and the men, if soldiers by\r\ncompulsion, at any rate are serving close to their own homes. Most of\r\nthe reservists required on mobilization reside within a few miles of\r\ntheir barracks. Living in the midst of the civil population, the troops\r\ndo not tend to become a class apart. Small garrisons are not, as\r\nformerly, allowed to stagnate, since modern communications make\r\nsupervision easy. Further, it must be borne in mind that the essence of\r\nthe system is the organization and training for war of the whole\r\nmilitary population. Now so great a mass of men could not be\r\nadministered except through this decentralization of authority, and the\r\ncorollary of short service universally applied is the full territorial\r\nsystem, in which the whole enrolled strength of the district is\r\nsubjected to the authority of the district commander. Practice, however,\r\nfalls short of theory, and the dangers of drawing whole units from\r\ndisaffected or unmilitary districts are often foreseen and discounted by\r\ndistributing the recruits, non-regionally, amongst more or less distant\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\n58. _Army Administration._--The existing systems of command and\r\norganization, being usually based upon purely military considerations,\r\nhave thus much, indeed almost all, in common. _Administration_ differs\r\nfrom them in one important respect. While the methods of command and\r\norganization are the result of the accumulated experience of many armies\r\nthrough many hundred years, the central administration in each case is\r\nthe product of the historical evolution of the particular country, and\r\nis dependent upon forms of government, constitutions and political\r\nparties. Thus France, after 1870, remodelled the organization of her\r\nforces in accordance with the methods which were presumed to have given\r\nGermany the victory, but the headquarters staff at Paris is very\r\ndifferent in all branches from that of Berlin. Great Britain adopted\r\nGerman tactics, and to some extent even uniform, but the Army Council\r\nhas no counterpart in the administration of the German emperor's forces.\r\n\r\nThe first point for consideration, therefore, is, what is the ultimate,\r\nand what is the proximate, authority supervising the administration? The\r\nformer is, in most countries, the people or its representatives in\r\nparliament, for it is in their power to stop supplies, and without money\r\nthe whole military fabric must crumble. The constitutional chief of the\r\narmy is the sovereign, or, in republics, the president, but in most\r\ncountries the direct control of army matters by the representatives of\r\nthe people extends over all affairs into which the well-being of the\r\ncivil population, the expenditure of money, alleged miscarriages of\r\nmilitary justice, &c., enter, and it is not unusual to find grand\r\nstrategy, and even the technical deficiencies of a field-gun or rifle,\r\nthe subject of interpellation and debate. The peculiar influence of the\r\nsovereign is in what may be termed patronage (that is, the selection of\r\nofficers to fill important positions and the general supervision of the\r\nofficer-corps), and in the fact that loyalty is the foundation of the\r\ndiscipline and soldierly honour which it is the task of the officers to\r\ninculcate into their men. In all cases the head of the state is _ipso\r\nfacto_ the head of the army. The difference between various systems may\r\nthen be held to depend on the degree of power allowed to or held by him.\r\nThis reacts upon the central administration of the army, and is the\r\ncause of the differences of system alluded to. For the civil chief of\r\nthe executive is not necessarily a soldier, much less an expert and\r\ncapable soldier; he must, therefore, be provided with technical\r\nadvisers. The chief of the general staff is often the principal of\r\nthese, though in some cases a special commander-in-chief, or the\r\nminister for war, or, as in France and England, a committee or council,\r\nhas the duty of advising the executive on technical matters.\r\n\r\n59. _Branches of Administration._--In these circumstances the only\r\ngeneral principle of army administration common to all systems is the\r\ndivision of the labour between two great branches. Military\r\nadministration, in respect of the troops and material which it has to\r\ncontrol, is divided between the departments of the _War Office_ and the\r\n_General Staff_. In the staff work of subordinate units, e.g. army corps\r\nand divisions, the same classification of duties is adopted, \"general\r\nstaff\" duties being performed by one set of officers, \"routine staff\"\r\nduties by another.\r\n\r\nThe work of a _General Staff_ may be taken as consisting in preparation\r\nfor war, and this again, both in Great Britain and abroad, consists of\r\nmilitary policy in all its branches, staff duties in war, the collection\r\nof intelligence, mobilization, plans of operations and concentration,\r\ntraining, military history and geography, and the preparation of war\r\nregulations. These subjects are usually subdivided into four or five\r\ngroups, each of which is dealt with by a separate section of the general\r\nstaff, the actual division of the work, of course, varying in different\r\ncountries. Thus, the second section of the French staff deals with \"the\r\norganization and tactics of foreign armies, study of foreign theatres of\r\nwar, and military missions abroad.\" A _War Office_ is concerned with\r\npeace administration and with the provision of men and material in war.\r\nUnder the former category fall such matters as \"routine\" administration,\r\nfinance, justice, recruiting, promotion of officers (though not always),\r\nbarracks and buildings generally, armament, equipment and clothing, &c.,\r\nin fact all matters not directly relevant to the training of the troops\r\nfor and the employment of the troops in war. In war, some of the\r\nfunctions of a war office are suspended, but on the other hand the work\r\nnecessary for the provision of men and material to augment the army and\r\nto make good its losses is vastly increased. In 1870 the minister of war,\r\nvon Roon, accompanied the headquarters in the field, but this arrangement\r\ndid not work well, and will not be employed again. The chief duties other\r\nthan those of the general staff fall into two classes, the \"routine\r\nstaff,\" administration or adjutant-general's branch, which deals with all\r\nmatters affecting _personnel_, and the quartermaster-general's branch,\r\nwhich supervises the provision and issue of supplies, stores and\r\n_materiel_ of all kinds. Over and above these, provision has to be made\r\nfor control of all the technical parts of administration, such as\r\nartillery and engineer services (in Great Britain, this, with a portion\r\nof the quartermaster-general's department, is under the master-general of\r\nthe ordnance), and for military legislation, preparation of estimates,\r\n&c. These are, of course, special subjects, not directly belonging to the\r\ngeneral administrative system. It is only requisite that the latter\r\nshould be sufficiently elastic to admit of these departments being formed\r\nas required. However these subordinate offices may be multiplied, the\r\nmain work of the war office is in the two departments of the\r\nadjutant-general (_personnel_) and the quartermaster-general\r\n(_materiel_). Beyond and wholly distinct from these is the general staff,\r\nthe creation of which is perhaps the most important contribution of the\r\npast century to the pure science of military organization.\r\n\r\n    COMPARATIVE STRENGTH OF VARIOUS ARMIES\r\n\r\n  (a) _Compulsory Service_ (1906).\r\n\r\n

Prior to the Norman Conquest the armed force of England was\r\nessentially a national militia. Every freeman was bound to bear arms for\r\nthe defence of the country, or for the maintenance of order. To give\r\nsome organization and training to the levy, the several sheriffs had\r\nauthority to call out the contingents of their shires for exercise. The\r\n\"fyrd,\" as the levy was named, was available for home service only, and\r\ncould not be moved even from its county except in the case of emergency;\r\nand it was principally to repel oversea invasions that its services\r\nwere required. Yet even in those days the necessity of some more\r\npermanent force was felt, and bodies of paid troops were maintained by\r\nthe kings at their own cost. Thus Canute and his successors, and even\r\nsome of the great earls kept up a household force (_huscarles_). The\r\nEnglish army at Hastings consisted of the _fyrd_ and the corps of\r\n_huscarles_.\r\n\r\nThe English had fought on foot; but the mailed horseman had now become\r\nthe chief factor in war, and the Conqueror introduced into England the\r\nsystem of tenure by knight-service familiar in Normandy. This was based\r\non the unit of the feudal host, the _constabularia_ of ten knights, the\r\nConqueror granting lands in return for finding one or more of these\r\nunits (in the case of great barons) or some fraction of them (in the\r\ncase of lesser tenants). The obligation was to provide knights to serve,\r\nwith horse and arms, for forty days in each year at their own charges.\r\nThis obligation could be handed on by sub-enfeoffment through a whole\r\nseries of under-tenants. The system being based, not on the duty of\r\npersonal service, but on the obligation to supply one or more knights\r\n(or it might be only the fraction of a knight), it was early found\r\nconvenient to commute this for a money payment known as \"scutage\" (see\r\nKNIGHT SERVICE and SCUTAGE). This money enabled the king to hire\r\nmercenaries, or pay such of the feudal troops as were willing to serve\r\nbeyond the usual time. From time to time proclamations and statutes were\r\nissued reminding the holders of knights' fees of their duties; but the\r\nimmediate object was generally to raise money rather than to enforce\r\npersonal service, which became more and more rare. The feudal system had\r\nnot, however, abrogated the old Saxon levies, and from these arose two\r\nnational institutions--the _posse comitatus_, liable to be called out by\r\nthe sheriff to maintain the king's peace, and later the _militia_\r\n(q.v.). The _posse comitatus_, or power of the county, included all\r\nmales able to bear arms, peers and spiritual men excepted; and though\r\nprimarily a police force it was also bound to assist in the defence of\r\nthe country. This levy was organized by the Assize of Arms under Henry\r\nII. (1181), and subsequently under Edward I. (1285) by the so-called\r\n\"Statute of Winchester,\" which determined the numbers and description of\r\nweapons to be kept by each man according to his property, and also\r\nprovided for their periodical inspection. The early Plantagenets made\r\nfree use of mercenaries. But the weakness of the feudal system in\r\nEngland was preparing, through the 12th and 13th centuries, a nation in\r\narms absolutely unique in the middle ages. The Scottish and Welsh wars\r\nwere, of course, fought by the feudal levy, but this levy was far from\r\nbeing the mob of unwilling peasants usual abroad, and from the _fyrd_\r\ncame the English archers, whose fame was established by Edward I.'s\r\nwars, and carried to the continent by Edward III. Edward III. realized\r\nthat there was better material to be had in his own country than abroad,\r\nand the army with which he invaded France was an army of national\r\nmercenaries, or, more simply, of English soldiers. The army at Crecy was\r\ncomposed exclusively of English, Welsh and Irish. From the pay list of\r\nthe army at the siege of Calais (1346) it appears that all ranks, from\r\nthe prince of Wales downward, were paid, no attempt being made to force\r\neven the feudal nobles to serve abroad at their own expense. These\r\narmies were raised mainly by contracts entered into \"with some knight or\r\ngentleman expert in war, and of great revenue and livelihood in the\r\ncountry, to serve the king in war with a number of men.\" Copies of the\r\nindentures executed when Henry V. raised his army for the invasion of\r\nFrance in 1415 are in existence. Under these the contracting party\r\nagreed to serve the king abroad for one year, with a given number of men\r\nequipped according to agreement, and at a stipulated rate of pay. A\r\ncertain sum was usually paid in advance, and in many cases the crown\r\njewels and plate were given in pledge for the rest. The profession of\r\narms seems to have been profitable. The pay of the soldier was high as\r\ncompared with that of the ordinary labourer, and he had the prospect of\r\na share of plunder in addition, so that it was not difficult to raise\r\nmen where the commander had a good military reputation. Edward III. is\r\nsaid to have declined the services of numbers of foreign mercenaries who\r\nwished to enrol under him in his wars against France.\r\n\r\nThe funds for the payment of these armies were provided partly from the\r\nroyal revenues, partly from the fines paid in lieu of military service,\r\nand other fines arbitrarily imposed, and partly by grants from\r\nparliament. As the soldier's contract usually ended with the war, and\r\nthe king had seldom funds to renew it even if he so wished, the armies\r\ndisbanded of themselves at the close of each war. To secure the services\r\nof the soldier during his contract, acts were passed (18 Henry VI. c.\r\n19; and 7 Henry VII. c. 1) inflicting penalties for desertion; and in\r\nEdward VI.'s reign an act \"touching the true service of captains and\r\nsoldiers\" was passed, somewhat of the nature of a Mutiny Act.\r\n\r\n61. It is difficult to summarize the history of the army between the\r\nHundred Years' War and 1642. The final failure of the English arms in\r\nFrance was soon followed by the Wars of the Roses, and in the long\r\nperiod of civil strife the only national force remaining to England was\r\nthe Calais garrison. Henry VIII. was a soldier-king, but he shared the\r\npublic feeling for the old bow and bill, and English armies which served\r\nabroad did not, it seems, win the respect of the advanced professional\r\nsoldiers of the continent. In 1519 the Venetian ambassador described the\r\nEnglish forces as consisting of 150,000 men whose peculiar, though not\r\nexclusive, weapon was the long bow (Fortescue i. 117). The national levy\r\nmade in 1588 to resist the Armada and the threat of invasion produced\r\nabout 750 lancers (heavy-armed cavalry), 2000 light horse and 56,000\r\nfoot, beside 20,000 men employed in watching the coasts. The small\r\nproportion of mounted men is very remarkable in a country in which\r\nCromwell was before long to illustrate the full power of cavalry on the\r\nbattlefield. It is indeed not unfair to regard this army as a\r\nmiscellaneous levy of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nIt was in cavalry that England was weakest, and by three different acts\r\nit was sought to improve the breed of horses, though the light horse of\r\nthe northern counties had a good reputation, and even won the admiration\r\nof the emperor Charles V. Perhaps the best organized force in England at\r\nthis time was the London volunteer association which ultimately became\r\nthe Honourable Artillery Company. At Floddon the spirit of the old\r\nEnglish yeomanry triumphed over the outward form of continental\r\nbattalions which the Scots had adopted, and doubtless the great victory\r\ndid much to retard military progress in England. The chief service of\r\nHenry VIII. to the British army was the formation of an artillery train,\r\nin which he took a special interest. Before he died the forces came to\r\nconsist of a few permanent troops (the bodyguard and the fortress\r\nartillery service), the militia or general levy, which was for home, and\r\nindeed for county, service only, and the paid armies which were\r\ncollected for a foreign war and disbanded at the conclusion of peace,\r\nand were recruited on the same principle of indents which had served in\r\nthe Hundred Years' War. In the reign of Mary, the old Statute of\r\nWinchester was revised (1553), and the new act provided for a\r\nreadjustment of the county contingents and in some degree for the\r\nrearmament of the militia. But, from the fall of Calais and the\r\nexpedition to Havre up to the battle of the Dunes a century later, the\r\nintervention of British forces in foreign wars was always futile and\r\ngenerally disastrous. During this time, however, the numerous British\r\nregiments in the service of Holland learned, in the long war of Dutch\r\nindependence, the art of war as it had developed on the continent since\r\n1450, and assimilated the regimental system and the drill and armament\r\nof the best models. Thus it was that in 1642 there were many hundreds of\r\ntrained and war-experienced officers and sergeants available for the\r\narmies of the king and the parliament. By this time bows and bills had\r\nlong disappeared even from the militia, and the Thirty Years' War,\r\nwhich, even more than the Low Countries, offered a career for the\r\nadventurous man, contributed yet more trained officers and soldiers to\r\nthe English and Scottish forces. So closely indeed was war now studied\r\nby Englishmen that the respective adherents of the Dutch and the Swedish\r\nsystems quarrelled on the eve of the battle of Edgehill. Francis and\r\nHorace Vere, Sir John Norris, and other Englishmen had become generals\r\nof European reputation. Skippon, Astley, Goring, Rupert, and many others\r\nsoon to be famous were distinguished as company and regimental officers\r\nin the battles and sieges of Germany and the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nThe home forces of England had, as has been said, little or nothing to\r\nrevive their ancient renown. Instead, they had come to be regarded as a\r\nmenace to the constitution. In Queen Elizabeth's time the demands of the\r\nIrish wars had led to frequent forced levies, and the occasional\r\nbilleting of the troops in England also gave rise to murmurs, but the\r\nbrilliancy and energy of her reign covered a great deal, and the\r\npeaceful policy of her successor removed all immediate cause of\r\ncomplaint. But after the accession of Charles I. we find the army a\r\nconstant and principal source of dispute between the king and\r\nparliament, until under William III. it is finally established on a\r\nconstitutional footing. Charles, wishing to support the Elector Palatine\r\nin the Thirty Years' War, raised an army of 10,000 men. He was already\r\nencumbered with debts, and the parliament refused all grants, on which\r\nhe had recourse to forced loans. The army was sent to Spain, but\r\nreturned without effecting anything, and was not disbanded, as usual,\r\nbut billeted on the inhabitants. The billeting was the more deeply\r\nresented as it appeared that the troops were purposely billeted on those\r\nwho had resisted the loan. Forced loans, billeting and martial law--all\r\ndirectly connected with the maintenance of the army--formed the main\r\nsubstance of the grievances set forth in the Petition of Right. In\r\naccepting this petition, Charles gave up the right to maintain an army\r\nwithout consent of parliament; and when in 1639 he wished to raise one\r\nto act against the rebellious Scots, parliament was called together, and\r\nits sanction obtained, on the plea that the army was necessary for the\r\ndefence of England. This army again became the source of dispute between\r\nthe king and parliament, and finally both sides appealed to arms.\r\n\r\n62. The first years of the Great Rebellion (q.v.) showed primarily the\r\nabundance of good officers produced by the wars on the continent, and in\r\nthe second place the absolute inadequacy of the military system of the\r\ncountry; the commissions of array, militia ordinances, &c., had at last\r\nto give way to regular methods of enlistment and a central army\r\nadministration. It was clear, at the same time, that when the struggle\r\nwas one of principles and not of dynastic politics, excellent recruits,\r\nfar different from the wretched levies who had been gathered together\r\nfor the Spanish war, were to be had in any reasonable number. These\r\ncauses combined to produce the \"New Model\" which, originating in\r\nCromwell's own cavalry and the London trained bands of foot, formed of\r\npicked men and officers, severely disciplined, and organized and\r\nadministered in the right way, quickly proved its superiority over all\r\nother armies in the field, and in a few years raised its general to\r\nsupreme civil power. The 15th of February 1645 was the birthday of the\r\nBritish standing army, and from its first concentration at Windsor Park\r\ndates the scarlet uniform. The men were for the most part voluntarily\r\nenlisted from existing corps, though deficiencies had immediately to be\r\nmade good by impressment.\r\n\r\nFour months later the New Model decided the quarrel of king and\r\nparliament at Naseby. When Cromwell, the first lieutenant-general and\r\nthe second captain-general of the army, sent his veterans to take part\r\nin the wars of the continent they proved themselves a match for the best\r\nsoldiers in Europe. On the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the army,\r\nnow some 80,000 strong, was disbanded. It had enforced the execution of\r\nCharles I., it had dissolved parliament, and England had been for years\r\ngoverned under a military regime. Thus the most popular measure of the\r\nRestoration was the dissolution of the army. Only Monk's regiment of\r\nfoot (now the Coldstream Guards) survived to represent the New Model in\r\nthe army of to-day. At the same time the troops (now regiments) of\r\nhousehold cavalry, and the regiment of foot which afterwards became the\r\nGrenadier Guards, were formed, chiefly from Royalists, though the\r\ndisbanded New Model contributed many experienced recruits. The permanent\r\nforces of the crown came to consist once more of the \"garrisons and\r\nguards,\" maintained by the king from the revenue allotted to him for\r\ncarrying on the government of the country. The \"garrisons\" were\r\ncommissioned to special fortresses--the Tower of London, Portsmouth, &c.\r\nThe \"guards\" comprised the sovereign's bodyguards (\"the yeomen of the\r\nguard\" and \"gentlemen-at-arms,\" who had existed since the times of Henry\r\nVII. and VIII.), and the regiments mentioned above. Even this small\r\nforce, at first not exceeding 3000 men, was looked on with jealousy by\r\nparliament, and every attempt to increase it was opposed. The\r\nacquisition of Tangier and Bombay, as part of the dower of the infanta\r\nof Portugal, led to the formation of a troop of horse (now the 1st Royal\r\nDragoons) and a regiment of infantry (the 2nd, now Queen's R.W. Surrey,\r\nregiment) for the protection of the former; and a regiment of infantry\r\n(afterwards transferred to the East India Company) to hold the latter\r\n(1661). These troops, not being stationed in the kingdom, created no\r\ndistrust; but whenever, as on several occasions during Charles's reign,\r\nconsiderable armies were raised, they were mostly disbanded when the\r\noccasion ceased. Several regiments, however, were added to the permanent\r\nforce, including Dumbarton's regiment (the 1st or Royal Scots, nicknamed\r\nPontius Pilate's Bodyguard)--which had a long record of service in the\r\narmies of the continent, and represented the Scots brigade of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus's army--and the 3rd Buffs, representing the English regiments\r\nof the Dutch army and through them the volunteers of 1572, and on\r\nCharles's death in 1685 the total force of \"guards and garrisons\" had\r\nrisen to 16,500, of whom about one-half formed what we should now call\r\nthe standing army.\r\n\r\n63. James II., an experienced soldier and sailor, was more obstinate\r\nthan his predecessor in his efforts to increase the army, and Monmouth's\r\nrebellion afforded him the opportunity. A force of about 20,000 men was\r\nmaintained in England, and a large camp formed at Hounslow. Eight\r\ncavalry and twelve infantry regiments (the senior of which was the 7th\r\n\"Royal\" Fusiliers, formed on a new French model) were raised, and given\r\nthe numbers which, with few exceptions, they still bear. James even\r\nproposed to disband the militia, which had not distinguished itself in\r\nthe late rebellion, and further augment the standing army; and although\r\nthe proposal was instantly rejected, he continued to add to the army\r\ntill the Revolution deprived him of his throne. The army which he had\r\nraised was to a great extent disbanded, the Irish soldiers especially,\r\nwhom he had introduced in large numbers on account of their religion,\r\nbeing all sent home.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the army immediately engaged the attention of\r\nparliament. The Bill of Rights had definitely established that \"the\r\nraising or keeping of a standing army within the kingdom, unless it be\r\nby the consent of parliament, is against the law,\" and past experience\r\nmade them very jealous of such a force. But civil war was imminent,\r\nforeign war certain; and William had only a few Dutch troops, and the\r\nremains of James's army, with which to meet the storm. Parliament\r\ntherefore sanctioned a standing army, trusting to the checks established\r\nby the Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement, and by placing the pay of\r\nthe army under the control of the Commons. An event soon showed the\r\naltered position of the army. A regiment mutinied and declared for\r\nJames. It was surrounded and compelled to lay down its arms; but William\r\nfound himself without legal power to deal with the mutineers. He\r\ntherefore applied to parliament, and in 1689 was passed the first Mutiny\r\nAct, which, after repeating the provisions regarding the army inserted\r\nin the Bill of Rights, and declaring the illegality of martial law, gave\r\npower to the crown to deal with the offences of mutiny and desertion by\r\ncourts-martial. From this event is often dated the history of the\r\nstanding army as a constitutional force (but see Fortescue, _British\r\nArmy_, i. 335).\r\n\r\n64. Under William the army was considerably augmented. The old regiments\r\nof James's army were reorganized, retaining, however, their original\r\nnumbers, and three of cavalry and eleven of infantry (numbered to the\r\n28th) were added. In 1690 parliament sanctioned a force of 62,000 men,\r\nfurther increased to 65,000 in 1691; but on peace being made in 1697\r\nthe Commons immediately passed resolutions to the effect that the land\r\nforces be reduced to 7000 men in England and 12,000 in Ireland. The War\r\nof the Spanish Succession quickly obliged Great Britain again to raise a\r\nlarge army, at one time exceeding 200,000 men; but of these the greater\r\nnumber were foreign troops engaged for the continental war. Fortescue\r\n(_op. cit._ i. 555) estimates the British forces at home and abroad as\r\n70,000 men at the highest figure. After the peace of Utrecht the force\r\nwas again reduced to 8000 men in Great Britain and 11,000 in the\r\nplantations (i.e. colonies) and abroad. From that time to the present\r\nthe strength of the army has been determined by the annual votes of\r\nparliament, and though frequently the subject of warm debates in both\r\nhouses, it has ceased to be a matter of dispute between the crown and\r\nparliament. The following table shows the fluctuations from that time\r\nonward--the peace years showing the average peace strength, the war\r\nyears the maximum to which the forces were raised:--\r\n\r\n        PEACE.           |          WAR.\r\n  Year.

Twenty English regiments\r\ntook part in the campaign of 1694. In the great wars of Queen Anne's\r\nreign the British army under Marlborough acquired a European reputation.\r\nThe cavalry, which had called forth the admiration of Prince Eugene when\r\npassed in review before him after its long march across Germany (1704),\r\nespecially distinguished itself in the battle of Blenheim, and\r\nRamillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet were added to the list of English\r\nvictories. But the army as usual was reduced at once, and even the\r\ncadres of old regiments were disbanded, though the alarm of Jacobite\r\ninsurrections soon brought about the re-creation of many of these.\r\nDuring the reign of the first and second Georges an artillery corps was\r\norganized, and the army further increased by five regiments of cavalry\r\nand thirty-five of infantry. Fresh laurels were won at Dettingen (1743),\r\nin which battle twenty English regiments took part; and though Fontenoy\r\n(q.v.) was a day of disaster for the English arms, it did not lower\r\ntheir reputation, but rather added to it. Six regiments of infantry won\r\nthe chief glory of Prince Ferdinand's victory of Minden (q.v.) in 1759,\r\nand throughout the latter part of the Seven Years' War the British\r\ncontingent of Ferdinand's army served with almost unvarying distinction\r\nin numerous actions. About this time the first English regiments were\r\nsent to India, and the 39th shared in Clive's victory at Plassey. During\r\nthe first half of George III.'s reign the army was principally occupied\r\nin America; and though the conquest of Canada may be counted with pride\r\namong its exploits, this page in its history is certainly the darkest.\r\nEnglish armies capitulated at Saratoga and at Yorktown, and the war\r\nended by the evacuation of the revolted states of America and the\r\nacknowledgment of their independence.\r\n\r\n65. Before passing to the great French Revolutionary wars, from which a\r\nfresh period in the history of the army may be dated, it will be well to\r\nreview the general condition of the army in the preceding century,\r\ninjured as it was by the distrust of parliament and departmental\r\nweakness and corruption which went far to neutralize the good work of\r\nthe duke of Cumberland as commander-in-chief and of Pitt as war\r\nadministrator. Regiments were raised almost as in the days of the\r\nEdwards. The crown contracted with a distinguished soldier, or gentleman\r\nof high position, who undertook to raise the men, receiving a certain\r\nsum as bounty-money for each recruit. In some cases, in lieu of money,\r\nthe contractor received the nomination of all or some of the officers,\r\nand recouped himself by selling the commissions. This system--termed\r\n\"raising men for rank\"--was retained for many years, and originally\r\nhelped to create the \"purchase system\" of promotion. For the maintenance\r\nof the regiment the colonel received an annual sum sufficient to cover\r\nthe pay of the men, and the expenses of clothing and of recruiting. The\r\ncolonel was given a \"beating order,\" without which no enlistment was\r\nlegal, and was responsible for maintaining his regiment at full\r\nstrength. \"Muster masters\" were appointed to muster the regiments, and\r\nto see that the men for whom pay was drawn were really effective.\r\nSometimes, when casualties were numerous, the allowance was insufficient\r\nto meet the cost of recruiting, and special grants were made. In war\r\ntime the ranks were also filled by released debtors, pardoned criminals,\r\nand impressed paupers and vagrants. Where the men were raised by\r\nvoluntary enlistment, the period of service was a matter of contract\r\nbetween the colonel and the soldier, and the engagement was usually for\r\nlife; but exceptional levies were enlisted for the duration of war, or\r\nfor periods of three or five years. As for the officers, the low rate of\r\npay and the purchase system combined to exclude all but men of\r\nindependent incomes. Appointments (except when in the gift of the\r\ncolonel) were made by the king at home, and by the commander-in-chief\r\nabroad; even in Ireland the power of appointment rested with the local\r\ncommander of the forces until the Union. The soldier was clothed by his\r\ncolonel, the charge being defrayed from the \"stock fund.\" The army lived\r\nin barracks, camps or billets. The barrack accommodation in Great\r\nBritain at the beginning of the 18th century only sufficed for five\r\nthousand men; and though it had gradually risen to twenty thousand in\r\n1792, a large part of the army was constantly in camps and billets--the\r\nlatter causing endless complaints and difficulties.\r\n\r\n66. The first efforts of the army in the long war with France did not\r\ntend to raise its reputation amongst the armies of Europe. The campaigns\r\nof allied armies under the duke of York in the Netherlands, in which\r\nBritish contingents figured largely, were uniformly unsuccessful\r\n(1793-94 and 1799), though in this respect they resembled those of\r\nalmost all soldiers who commanded against the \"New French\" army. The\r\npolicy of the younger Pitt sent thousands of the best soldiers to\r\nunprofitable employment, and indeed to death, in the West Indies. At\r\nhome the administration was corrupt and ineffective, and the people\r\ngenerally shared the contemptuous feeling towards the regular army which\r\nwas then prevalent in Europe. But a better era began with the\r\nappointment of Frederick Augustus, duke of York, as commander-in-chief\r\nof the army. He did much to improve its organization, discipline and\r\ntraining, and was ably seconded by commanders of distinguished ability.\r\nUnder Abercromby in Egypt, under Stuart at Maida, and under Lake,\r\nWellesley and others in India, the British armies again attached victory\r\nto their standards, and made themselves feared and respected. Later,\r\nNapoleon's threat of invading England excited her martial spirit to the\r\nhighest pitch to which it had ever attained. Finally, her military glory\r\nwas raised by the series of successful campaigns in the Peninsula, until\r\nit culminated in the great victory of Waterloo; and the army emerged\r\nfrom the war with the most solidly founded reputation of any in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe events of this period belong to the history of Europe, and fall\r\noutside the province of an article dealing only with the army. The great\r\naugmentations required during the war were effected partly by raising\r\nadditional regiments, but principally by increasing the number of\r\nbattalions, some regiments being given as many as four. On the\r\nconclusion of peace these battalions were reduced, but the regiments\r\nwere retained, and the army was permanently increased from about twenty\r\nthousand, the usual peace establishment before the war, to an average of\r\neighty thousand. The duke of York, on first appointment to the command,\r\nhad introduced a uniform drill throughout the army, which was further\r\nmodified according to Sir David Dundas's system in 1800; and, under the\r\ndirection of Sir John Moore and others, a high perfection of drill was\r\nattained. At the beginning of the war, the infantry, like that of the\r\ncontinental powers, was formed in three ranks; but a two-rank formation\r\nhad been introduced in America and in India and gradually became\r\ngeneral, and in 1809 was finally approved. In the Peninsula the army was\r\npermanently organized in divisions, usually consisting of two brigades\r\nof three or four battalions each, and one or two batteries of artillery.\r\nThe duke of Wellington had also brought the commissariat and the army\r\ntransport to a high pitch of perfection, but in the long peace which\r\nfollowed these establishments were reduced or broken up.\r\n\r\n67. The period which elapsed between Waterloo and the Crimean War is\r\nmarked by a number of Indian and colonial wars, but by no organic\r\nchanges in the army, with perhaps the single exception of the Limited\r\nService Act of 1847, by which enlistment for ten or twelve years, with\r\npower to re-engage to complete twenty-one, was substituted for the life\r\nenlistments hitherto in force. The army went to sleep on the laurels and\r\nrecollections of the Peninsula. The duke of Wellington, for many years\r\ncommander-in-chief, was too anxious to hide it away in the colonies in\r\norder to save it from further reductions or utter extinction, to attempt\r\nany great administrative reforms. The force which was sent to the Crimea\r\nin 1854 was an agglomeration of battalions, individually of the finest\r\nquality, but unused to work together, without trained staff,\r\nadministrative departments or army organization of any kind. The lesson\r\nof the winter before Sevastopol was dearly bought, but was not thrown\r\naway. From that time successive war ministers and commanders-in-chief\r\nhave laboured perseveringly at the difficult task of army organization\r\nand administration. Foremost in the work was Sidney Herbert (Lord\r\nHerbert of Lea), the soldier's friend, who fell a sacrifice to his\r\nlabours (1861), but not before he had done much for the army. The whole\r\nsystem of administration was revised. In 1854 it was inconceivably\r\ncomplicated and cumbersome. The \"secretary of state for war and\r\ncolonies,\" sitting at the Colonial Office, had a general but vague\r\ncontrol, practically limited to times of war. The \"secretary at war\" was\r\nthe parliamentary representative of the army, and exercised a certain\r\nfinancial control, not extending, however, to the ordnance corps. The\r\ncommander-in-chief was responsible to the sovereign alone in all matters\r\nconnected with the discipline, command or patronage of the army, but to\r\nthe secretary at war in financial matters. The master-general and board\r\nof ordnance were responsible for the supply of material on requisition,\r\nbut were otherwise independent, and had the artillery and engineers\r\nunder them. The commissariat department had its headquarters at the\r\ntreasury, and until 1852 the militia were under the home secretary. A\r\nnumber of minor subdepartments, more or less independent, also existed,\r\ncausing endless confusion, correspondence and frequent collision. In\r\n1854 the business of the colonies was separated from that of war, and\r\nthe then secretary of state, the duke of Newcastle, assumed control over\r\nall the other administrative officers. In the following year the\r\nsecretary of state was appointed secretary at war also, and the duties\r\nof the two offices amalgamated. The same year the commissariat office\r\nwas transferred to the war department, and the Board of Ordnance\r\nabolished, its functions being divided between the commander-in-chief\r\nand the secretary of state. The minor departments were gradually\r\nabsorbed, and the whole administration divided under two great chiefs,\r\nsitting at the war office and Horse Guards respectively. In 1870 these\r\ntwo were welded into one, and the war office now existing was\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nCorresponding improvements were effected in every branch. The system of\r\nclothing the soldiers was altered, the contracts being taken from the\r\ncolonels of regiments, who received a money allowance instead, and the\r\nclothing supplied from government manufactories. The pay, food and\r\ngeneral condition of the soldier were improved; reading and recreation\r\nrooms, libraries, gymnasia and facilities for games of all kinds being\r\nprovided. Barracks (q.v.) were built on improved principles, and a large\r\npermanent camp was formed at Aldershot, where considerable forces were\r\ncollected and manoeuvred together. Various educational establishments\r\nwere opened, a staff college was established for the instruction of\r\nofficers wishing to qualify for the staff, and regimental schools were\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n68. The Indian Mutiny of 1857, followed by the transference of the\r\ngovernment of India, led to important changes. The East India Company's\r\nwhite troops were amalgamated with the Queen's army, and the whole\r\nreorganized (see _Indian Army_ below).\r\n\r\nThe fact that such difficulties as those of 1854 and 1857, not to speak\r\nof the disorders of 1848, had been surmounted by the weak army which\r\nremained over from the reductions of forty years, coupled with the\r\ninstantaneous and effective rejoinder to the threats of the French\r\ncolonels in 1859--the creation of the Volunteer Force--certainly lulled\r\nthe nation and its representatives into a false sense of security. Thus\r\nthe two obvious lessons of the German successes of 1866 and 1870--the\r\npower of a national army for offensive invasion, and the rapidity with\r\nwhich such an army when thoroughly organized could be moved--created the\r\ngreatest sensation in England. The year 1870 is, therefore, of prime\r\nimportance in the history of the regular forces of the crown. The\r\nstrength of the home forces at different times between 1815 and 1870 is\r\ngiven as follows (Biddulph, _Lord Cardwell at the War Office_):--\r\n\r\n  +------+-----------------+--------------+-------------+\r\n  |      |    Regulars.    | Auxiliaries. | Field Guns. |\r\n  +------+-----------------+--------------+-------------+\r\n  | 1820 |      64,426     |    60,740    |      22     |\r\n  | 1830 |      50,876     |    34,614    |      30     |\r\n  | 1840 |      53,379     |    20,791    |      30     |\r\n  | 1850 |      68,538     |    29,868    |      70     |\r\n  | 1860 |     100,701     |   229,301    |     180     |\r\n  | 1870 |      89,051     |   281,692    |     180     |\r\n  |      | (later 109,000) |              |             |\r\n  +------+-----------------+--------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n69. The period of reform commences therefore with 1870, and is connected\r\nindissolubly with the name of Edward, Lord Cardwell, secretary of state\r\nfor war 1869-1874. In the matter of organization the result of his\r\nlabours was seen in the perfectly arranged expedition to Ashanti (1874);\r\nas for recruiting, the introduction of short service and reserve\r\nenlistment together with many rearrangements of pay, &c., proved so far\r\npopular that the number of men annually enlisted was more than trebled\r\n(11,742 in 1869; 39,971 in 1885; 40,729 in 1898), and so far efficient\r\nthat \"Lord Cardwell's ... system, with but small modification, gave us\r\nduring the Boer War 80,000 reservists, of whom 96 or 97% were found\r\nefficient, and has enabled us to keep an army of 150,000 regulars in the\r\nfield for 15 months\" (Rt. Hon. St John Brodrick, House of Commons, 8th\r\nof March 1901). The localization of the army, subsequently completed by\r\nthe territorial system of 1882, was commenced under Cardwell's regime,\r\nand a measure which encountered much powerful opposition at the time,\r\nthe abolition of the purchase of commissions, was also effected by him\r\n(1871). The machinery of administration was improved, and autumn\r\nmanoeuvres were practised on a scale hitherto unknown in England. In\r\n1871 certain powers over the militia, formerly held by lords-lieutenant,\r\nwere transferred to the crown, and the auxiliary forces were placed\r\ndirectly under the generals commanding districts. In 1881 came an\r\nimportant change in the infantry of the line, which was entirely\r\nremodelled in two-battalion regiments bearing territorial titles. This\r\nmeasure (the \"linked battalion\" system) aroused great opposition; it was\r\ndictated chiefly by the necessity of maintaining the Indian and colonial\r\ngarrisons at full strength, and was begun during Lord Cardwell's tenure\r\nof office, the principle being that each regiment should have one\r\nbattalion at home and one abroad, the latter being fed by the former,\r\nwhich in its turn drew upon the reserve to complete it for war. The\r\nworking of the system is to be considered as belonging to present\r\npractice rather than to history, and the reader is therefore referred to\r\nthe article UNITED KINGDOM. On these general lines the army progressed\r\nup to 1899, when the Boer War called into the field on a distant theatre\r\nof war all the resources of the regular army, and in addition drew\r\nlargely upon the existing auxiliary forces, and even upon wholly\r\nuntrained civilians, for the numbers required to make war in an area\r\nwhich comprised nearly all Africa south of the Zambezi. As the result\r\nof this war (see TRANSVAAL) successive schemes of reform were undertaken\r\nby the various war ministers, leading up to Mr Haldane's \"territorial\"\r\nscheme (1908), which put the organization of the forces in the United\r\nKingdom (q.v.) on a new basis.\r\n\r\nInnovations had not been unknown in the period immediately preceding the\r\nwar; as a single example we may take the development of the mounted\r\ninfantry (q.v.). It was natural that the war itself, and especially a\r\nwar of so peculiar a character, should intensify the spirit of\r\ninnovation. The corresponding period in the German army lasted from 1871\r\nto 1888, and such a period of unsettlement is indeed the common,\r\npractically the universal, result of a war on a large scale. Much that\r\nwas of value in the Prussian methods, faithfully and even slavishly\r\ncopied by Great Britain as by others after 1870, was temporarily\r\nforgotten, but the pendulum swung back again, and the Russo-Japanese War\r\nled to the disappearance, so far as Europe was concerned, of many\r\nproducts of the period of doubt and controversy which followed the\r\nstruggle in South Africa. Side by side with continuous discussions of\r\nthe greater questions of military policy, amongst these being many\r\nwell-reasoned proposals for universal service, the technical and\r\nadministrative efficiency of the service has undergone great\r\nimprovement, and this appears to be of more real and permanent value\r\nthan the greater part of the solutions given for the larger problems.\r\nThe changes in the organization of the artillery afford the best\r\nevidence of this spirit of practical and technical reform. In the first\r\nplace the old \"royal regiment\" was divided into two branches. The\r\nofficers for the field and horse artillery stand now on one seniority\r\nlist for promotion, the garrison, heavy and mountain batteries on\r\nanother. In each branch important changes of organization have been also\r\nmade. In the field branch, both for Royal Field and Royal Horse\r\nArtillery, the battery is no longer the one unit for all purposes. A\r\nlieutenant-colonel's command, the \"brigade,\" has been created. It\r\nconsists of a group, in the horse artillery of two, in the field\r\nartillery of three batteries. For the practical training of the horse\r\nand field artillery a large area of ground on the wild open country of\r\nDartmoor, near Okehampton, has for some years been utilized. A similar\r\nschool has been started at Glen Imaal in Ireland, and a new training\r\nground has been opened on Salisbury Plain. Similarly, with the Royal\r\nGarrison Artillery a more perfect system has been devised for the\r\nregulation and practice of the fire of each fortress, in accordance with\r\nthe varying circumstances of its position, &c. A practice school for the\r\ngarrison artillery has been established at Lydd, but the various coast\r\nfortresses themselves carry out regular practice with service\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN ARMY\r\n\r\n70. Historically, the Indian army grew up in three distinct divisions,\r\nthe Bengal, Madras and Bombay armies. This separation was the natural\r\nresult of the original foundation of separate settlements and factories\r\nin India; and each retains to the present day much of its old identity.\r\n\r\n  _Bengal._--The English traders in Bengal were long restricted by the\r\n  native princes to a military establishment of an ensign and 30 men;\r\n  and this force may be taken as the germ of the Indian army. In 1681\r\n  Bengal received the first reinforcement from Madras, and two years\r\n  later a company was sent from Madras, raising the little Bengal army\r\n  to a strength of 250 Europeans. In 1695 native soldiers were first\r\n  enlisted. In 1701-1702 the garrison of Calcutta consisted of 120\r\n  soldiers and seamen gunners. In 1756 occurred the defence of Calcutta\r\n  against Suraj-ud-Dowlah, and the terrible tragedy of the Black Hole.\r\n  The work of reconquest and punishment was carried out by an expedition\r\n  from Madras, and in the little force with which Clive gained the great\r\n  victory of Plassey the Bengal army was represented by a few hundred\r\n  men only (the British 39th, now Dorsetshire regiment, which was also\r\n  present, was the first King's regiment sent to India, and bears the\r\n  motto _Primus in Indis_); but from this date the military power of the\r\n  Company rapidly increased. A company of artillery had been organized\r\n  in 1748; and in 1757, shortly before Plassey, the 1st regiment of\r\n  Bengal native infantry was raised. Next, in 1759 the native infantry\r\n  was augmented, in 1760 dragoons were raised, and in 1763 the total\r\n  forces amounted to 1500 Europeans and 12 battalions of native infantry\r\n  (11,500 men). In 1765 the European infantry was divided into 3\r\n  regiments, and the whole force was organized in 3 brigades, each\r\n  consisting of 1 company of artillery, 1 regiment European infantry, 1\r\n  troop of native cavalry, and 7 battalions of sepoys. In 1766, on the\r\n  reduction of some money allowances, a number of officers of the Bengal\r\n  army agreed to resign their commissions simultaneously. This dangerous\r\n  combination was promptly put down by Clive, to whom the Bengal army\r\n  may be said to owe its existence.\r\n\r\n  The constant wars and extensions of dominion of the next thirty years\r\n  led to further augmentations; the number of brigades and of European\r\n  regiments was increased to 6; and in 1794 the Bengal army numbered\r\n  about 3500 Europeans and 24,000 natives.\r\n\r\n  71. _Madras._--The first armed force in the Madras presidency was the\r\n  little garrison of Armegon on the Coromandel coast, consisting of 28\r\n  soldiers. In 1644 Fort St George was built and garrisoned, and in 1653\r\n  Madras became a presidency. In 1745 the garrison of Fort St George\r\n  consisted of 200 Europeans, while a similar number, with the addition\r\n  of 200 \"Topasses\" (descendants of the Portuguese), garrisoned Fort St\r\n  David. In 1748 the various independent companies on the Coromandel\r\n  coast and other places were consolidated into the Madras European\r\n  regiment. From this time the military history of the Madras army was\r\n  full of incident, and it bore the principal part in Clive's victories\r\n  of Arcot, Kavaripak and Plassey. In 1754 the 39th regiment of the\r\n  Royal army was sent to Madras. In 1758 three others followed. In 1772\r\n  the Madras army numbered 3000 European infantry and 16,000 natives,\r\n  and in 1784 the number of native troops had risen to 34,000.\r\n\r\n  72. _Bombay._--The island of Bombay formed part of the marriage\r\n  portion received by Charles II. with the infanta of Portugal, and in\r\n  1662 the Bombay regiment of Europeans was raised to defend it. In 1668\r\n  the island was granted to the Company, and the regiment at the same\r\n  time transferred to them. In 1708 Bombay became a presidency, but it\r\n  did not play so important a part as the others in the early extension\r\n  of British power, and its forces were not so rapidly developed. It is\r\n  said, however, to have been the first to discipline native troops, and\r\n  Bombay sepoys were sent to Madras in 1747, and took part in the battle\r\n  of Plassey in 1757. In 1772 the Bombay army consisted of 2500\r\n  Europeans and 3500 sepoys, but in 1794, in consequence of the\r\n  struggles with the Mahratta power, the native troops had been\r\n  increased to 24,000.\r\n\r\n  73. _Consolidation of the Army._--In 1796 a general reorganization\r\n  took place. Hitherto the officers in each presidency had been borne on\r\n  general \"lists,\" according to branches of the service. These lists\r\n  were now broken up and cadres of regiments formed. The colonels and\r\n  lieutenant-colonels remained on separate lists, and an establishment\r\n  of general officers was created, while the divisional commands were\r\n  distributed between the royal and Company's officers. Further\r\n  augmentations took place, consequent on the great extension of British\r\n  supremacy. In 1798 the native infantry in India numbered 122\r\n  battalions. In 1808 the total force in India amounted to 24,500\r\n  Europeans and 154,500 natives.\r\n\r\n  The first half of the 19th century was filled with wars and\r\n  annexations and the army was steadily increased. Horse artillery was\r\n  formed, and the artillery in general greatly augmented. \"Irregular\r\n  cavalry\" was raised in Bengal and Bombay, and recruited from a better\r\n  class of troopers, who received high pay and found their own horses\r\n  and equipment. \"Local forces\" were raised in various parts from time\r\n  to time, the most important being the Punjab irregular force (raised\r\n  after the annexation of the Punjab in 1849), consisting of 3 field\r\n  batteries, 5 regiments of cavalry, and 5 of infantry, and the Nagpur\r\n  and Oudh irregular forces. Another kind of force, which had been\r\n  gradually formed, was that called \"contingents\"--troops raised by the\r\n  protected native states. The strongest of these was that of Hyderabad,\r\n  originally known as the nizam's army. Changes were also made in the\r\n  organization of the army. Sanitary improvements were effected,\r\n  manufacturing establishments instituted or increased, and the\r\n  administration generally improved.\r\n\r\n  74. _The Army before the Mutiny._--The officering and recruiting of\r\n  the three armies were in all essentials similar. The officers were\r\n  mainly supplied by the Company's military college at Addiscombe in\r\n  Surrey (established in 1809), and by direct appointments. The Bengal\r\n  army was recruited from Hindustan, the infantry being mostly drawn\r\n  from Oudh and the great Gangetic plains. The soldiers were chiefly\r\n  high-caste Hindus, a sixth being Mahommedans. The cavalry was composed\r\n  mainly of Mahommedans, recruited from Rohilkhand and the Gangetic\r\n  Doab. The only other elements in the army were four Gurkha regiments,\r\n  enlisted from Nepal, and the local Punjab irregular force. The Madras\r\n  army was chiefly recruited from that presidency, or the native states\r\n  connected with it, and consisted of Mahommedans, Brahmans, and of the\r\n  Mahratta, Tamil and Telugu peoples. The Bombay army was recruited from\r\n  its own presidency, with some Hindustanis, but chiefly formed of\r\n  Mahrattas and Mahommedans; the Bombay light cavalry mainly from\r\n  Hindustan proper.\r\n\r\n  Including the local and irregular troops (about 100,000 strong), the\r\n  total strength amounted to 38,000 Europeans of all arms, with 276\r\n  field guns, and 348,000 native troops, with 248 field guns,--truly a\r\n  magnificent establishment, and, outwardly, worthy of the great empire\r\n  which England had created for herself in the East, but inwardly\r\n  unsound, and on the very verge of the great mutiny of 1857.\r\n\r\n  In 1856 the establishment in the several presidencies was a follows:--\r\n\r\n    +-------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------+\r\n    |                               | Bengal. | Madras. | Bombay. | Total.|\r\n    +-------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------+\r\n    | British Cavalry Regiments     |    2    |    1    |    1    |    4  |\r\n    | British Infantry Battalions   |   15    |    3    |    4    |   22  |\r\n    | Company's European Battalions |    3    |    3    |    3    |    9  |\r\n    | European and Native Artillery |         |         |         |       |\r\n    |   Battalions                  |   12    |    7    |    5    |   24  |\r\n    | Native Infantry Battalions    |   74    |   52    |   29    |  155  |\r\n    | Native Cavalry Regiments      |   28    |    8    |    3    |   39  |\r\n    +-------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------+\r\n\r\n  An account of the events of 1857-58 will be found under INDIAN MUTINY.\r\n  After the catastrophe the reorganization of the military forces on\r\n  different lines was of course unavoidable. Fortunately, the armies of\r\n  Madras and Bombay had been almost wholly untouched by the spirit of\r\n  disaffection, and in the darkest days the Sikhs, though formerly\r\n  enemies of the British, had not only remained faithful to them, but\r\n  had rendered them powerful assistance.\r\n\r\n  75. _The Reorganization._--By the autumn of 1858 the mutiny was\r\n  virtually crushed, and the task of reorganization commenced. On the\r\n  1st of September 1858 the East India Company ceased to rule, and Her\r\n  Majesty's government took up the reins of power. On the important\r\n  question of the army, the opinions and advice of the most\r\n  distinguished soldiers and civilians were invited. Masses of reports\r\n  and evidence were collected in India, and by a royal commission in\r\n  England. On the report of this commission the new system was based.\r\n  The local European army was abolished, and its personnel amalgamated\r\n  with the royal army. The artillery became wholly British, with the\r\n  exception of a few native mountain batteries. The total strength of\r\n  the British troops, all of the royal army, was largely increased,\r\n  while that of the native troops was largely diminished. Three distinct\r\n  native armies--those of Bengal, Madras and Bombay--were still\r\n  maintained. The reduced Indian armies consisted of cavalry and\r\n  infantry only, with a very few artillery, distributed as follows:--\r\n\r\n                    Battalions  Regiments\r\n                     Infantry.   Cavalry.\r\n    Bengal              49         19\r\n    Madras              40          4\r\n    Bombay              30          7\r\n    Punjab Force        12          6\r\n                       ---        ---\r\n        Total          131         36\r\n\r\n  There were also three sapper battalions, one to each army.\r\n\r\n  The Punjab force, which had 5 batteries of native artillery attached\r\n  to it, continued under the Punjab government. In addition, the\r\n  Hyderabad contingent of 4 cavalry, 6 infantry regiments and 4\r\n  batteries, and a local force in central India of 2 regiments cavalry\r\n  and 6 infantry, were retained under the government of India. After all\r\n  the arrangements had been completed the army of India consisted of\r\n  62,000 British and 125,000 native troops.\r\n\r\n  76. _The Modern Army._--The college at Addiscombe was closed in 1860,\r\n  and the direct appointment of British officers to the Indian local\r\n  forces ceased in 1861. In that year a staff corps was formed by royal\r\n  warrant in each presidency \"to supply a body of officers for service\r\n  in India, by whom various offices and appointments hitherto held by\r\n  officers borne on the strength of the several corps in the Indian\r\n  forces shall in future be held.\" Special roles were laid down. The\r\n  corps was at first recruited partly from officers of the Company's\r\n  service and partly from the royal army, holding staff appointments\r\n  (the new regimental employment being considered as staff duty) and all\r\n  kinds of political and civil posts; for the system established later\r\n  see INDIA: _Army_. The native artillery and sappers and miners were to\r\n  be officered from the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. The only\r\n  English warrant and non-commissioned officers now to be employed in\r\n  the native army were to be those of the Royal Engineers with the\r\n  sappers and miners.\r\n\r\n  A radical change in the regimental organization of all the native\r\n  armies was effected in 1863. The Punjab Frontier Force was from the\r\n  first organized on the irregular system, which was there seen at its\r\n  best, as also were the new regiments raised during the Mutiny. This\r\n  system was now applied to the whole army, each regiment and battalion\r\n  having seven British officers attached to it for command and\r\n  administrative duties, the immediate command of troops and companies\r\n  being left to the native officers. Thus was the system reverted to,\r\n  which was initiated by Clive, of a few British officers only being\r\n  attached to each corps for the higher regimental duties of command and\r\n  control. Time had shown that this was more effective than the regular\r\n  system instituted in 1796 of British officers commanding troops and\r\n  companies.\r\n\r\n  A new spirit was breathed into the army. The supremacy of the\r\n  commandant was the main principle. He was less hampered by the\r\n  unbending regulations enjoined upon the old regular regiments, had\r\n  greater powers of reward and punishment, was in a position to assume\r\n  larger responsibility and greater freedom of action, and was supported\r\n  in the full exercise of his authority. The system made the officers.\r\n\r\n  Up to 1881 the native army underwent little change, but in that year\r\n  18 regiments of infantry and 4 of cavalry were broken up, almost the\r\n  same total number of men being maintained in fewer and stronger\r\n  regiments. The only reduction made in the British troops was in the\r\n  Royal Artillery, which was diminished by 11 batteries. The events of\r\n  1885, however, on the Russo-Afghan frontier, led to augmentations. The\r\n  11 batteries Royal Artillery were brought back from England; each of\r\n  the 9 British cavalry regiments in India received a fourth squadron;\r\n  each of the British infantry battalions was increased by 100 men, and\r\n  3 battalions were added. The native cavalry had a fourth squadron\r\n  added to each regiment; three of the four regiments broken up in 1881\r\n  were re-raised, while the native infantry was increased in regimental\r\n  strength, and 9 new battalions raised composed of Gurkhas, Sikhs and\r\n  Punjabis. The addition in all amounted to 10,600 British and 21,200\r\n  native troops. In 1890 the strength of the army of India was 73,000\r\n  British and, including irregulars, 147,500 native troops. For the\r\n  Indian volunteers, see VOLUNTEERS.\r\n\r\n  Many important changes took place between 1885 and 1904. Seven Madras\r\n  infantry regiments were converted into regiments for service in Burma,\r\n  composed of Gurkhas and hardy races from northern India; six Bengal\r\n  and Bombay regiments were similarly converted into regiments of\r\n  Punjabis, Pathans and Gurkhas; the native mountain batteries have been\r\n  increased to ten; a system of linked battalions has been introduced\r\n  with the formation of regimental centres for mobilization; and\r\n  reserves for infantry and mountain artillery have been formed. The\r\n  number of British officers with each regiment has been increased to\r\n  nine, and the two wing commands in battalions have been converted into\r\n  4 double-company commands of 250 men each, under a British commander,\r\n  who is responsible to the commandant for their training and\r\n  efficiency, the command of the companies being left to the native\r\n  officers. This system, which is analogous to the squadron command in\r\n  the cavalry, admits of closer individual attention to training, and\r\n  distributes among the senior British regimental officers effective\r\n  responsibility of a personal kind.\r\n\r\n  An addition (at the imperial expense) of five battalions of Sikhs,\r\n  Punjabi Mahommedans, Jats and hillmen in northern India was made in\r\n  1900, as the result of India being called upon to furnish garrisons\r\n  for Mauritius and other stations overseas.\r\n\r\n  The unification of the triplicate army departments in the different\r\n  presidential armies was completed in 1891, all being brought directly\r\n  under the supreme government; and the three separate staff corps of\r\n  Bengal, Madras and Bombay were fused into one in 1891 as the Indian\r\n  Staff Corps. The term \"Indian Staff Corps\" was in turn replaced by\r\n  that of \"Indian Army\" in 1903. These measures prepared the way for the\r\n  new system of army organization which, by authority of parliament,\r\n  abolished divided control and placed the whole army of India under the\r\n  governor-general and the commander-in-chief in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADIAN FORCES\r\n\r\n  77. In the earliest European settlements in Canada, the necessity of\r\n  protection against Indians caused the formation of a militia, and in\r\n  1665 companies were raised in every parish. The military history of\r\n  the Canadian forces under French rule is full of incident, and they\r\n  served not only against Indian raiders but also against the troops of\r\n  Great Britain and of her North American colonies. Six militia\r\n  battalions took part in the defence of Quebec in 1759, and even the\r\n  transfer of Canada from the French to the British crown did not cause\r\n  the disbandment of the existing forces. The French Canadians\r\n  distinguished themselves not less than the British settlers in the War\r\n  of American Independence, and in particular in the defence of Quebec\r\n  against Montgomery and Arnold. In 1787 an ordinance was made whereby\r\n  three battalions of the militia were permanently embodied, each\r\n  contingent serving for two years, at the end of which time a fresh\r\n  contingent relieved it, and after this a succession of laws and\r\n  regulations were made with a view to complete organization of the\r\n  force. The brunt of the fighting on the American frontier in the war\r\n  of 1812 was borne very largely by the permanent force of three\r\n  battalions and the fresh units called out, all these being militia\r\n  corps. Up to 1828 a distinction had been made between the British and\r\n  the French regiments: this was then abolished. The militia was again\r\n  employed on active service during the disturbances of 1837, and the\r\n  \"Active Militia\" in 1863 had grown to a strength of 25,000 men. The\r\n  Fenian troubles of 1864 and 1866 caused the embodiment of the Canadian\r\n  forces once more. In 1867 took place the unification of Canada, after\r\n  which the whole force was completely organized on the basis of a\r\n  militia act (1868). A department of Militia and Defence with a\r\n  responsible minister was established, and the strength of the active\r\n  militia of all arms was fixed at 40,000 rank and file. Two years later\r\n  the militia furnished 6000 men to deal with the Fenian Raid of 1870,\r\n  and took part in Colonel (Lord) Wolseley's Red River expedition. In\r\n  1871 a permanent force, serving the double purpose of a regular\r\n  nucleus and an instructional cadre, was organized in two troops of\r\n  cavalry, two batteries of artillery and one regiment of infantry, and\r\n  in 1876 the Royal Military College of Canada was founded at Kingston.\r\n  In 1885 the Riel rebellion was dealt with, and the important action of\r\n  Batoche won, by the militia, without assistance from regular troops.\r\n  In the same year Canada contributed a force of _voyageurs_ to the Nile\r\n  expedition of Lord Wolseley; the experience of these men was\r\n  admittedly of great assistance in navigating the Rapids. The militia\r\n  sent contingents of all arms to serve in the South African War,\r\n  1899-1902, including \"Strathcona's Horse,\" a special corps, recruited\r\n  almost entirely from the Active Militia and the North-west Mounted\r\n  Police. The latter, a permanent constabulary of mounted riflemen, was\r\n  formed in 1873.\r\n\r\n  After the South African War an extensive scheme of reorganization was\r\n  taken in hand, the command being exercised for two years (1902-1904)\r\n  by Major-General Lord Dundonald, and subsequently by a militia council\r\n  (Militia Act 1904), similar in constitution to the home Army Council.\r\n  For details of the present military strength of Canada, see the\r\n  article CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIAN ARMY\r\n\r\n78. The _Landsknecht_ infantry constituted the mainstay of the imperial\r\narmies in the 16th century. Maximilian I. and Charles V. are recorded to\r\nhave marched and carried the \"long pike\" in their ranks. Maximilian also\r\nformed a corps of _Kyrisser_, who were the origin of the modern\r\ncuirassiers. It was not, however, until much later that the Austrian\r\narmy came into existence as a permanent force. Rudolph II. formed a\r\nsmall standing force about 1600, but relied upon the \"enlistment\"\r\nsystem, like other sovereigns of the time, for the bulk of his armies.\r\nThe Thirty Years' War produced the permanence of service which led in\r\nall the states of Europe to the rise of standing armies. In the Empire\r\nit was Wallenstein who first raised a distinctly imperial army of\r\nsoldiers owing no duty but to the sovereign; and it was the suspicion\r\nthat he intended to use this army, which was raised largely at his own\r\nexpense, to further his own ends, that led to his assassination. From\r\nthat time the regiments belonged no longer to their colonels, but to the\r\nemperor; and the oldest regiments in the present Austrian army date from\r\nthe Thirty Years' War, at the close of which Austria had 19 infantry, 6\r\ncuirassier and 1 dragoon regiments. The almost continuous wars of\r\nAustria against France and the Turks (from 1495 to 1895 Austrian troops\r\ntook part in 7000 actions of all sorts) led to a continuous increase in\r\nher establishments. The wars of the time of Montecucculi and of Eugene\r\nwere followed by that of the Polish Succession, the two Turkish wars,\r\nand the three great struggles against Frederick the Great. Thus in 1763\r\nthe army had been almost continuously on active service for more than\r\n100 years, in the course of which its organization had been modified in\r\naccordance with the lessons of each war. This, in conjunction with the\r\nfact that Austria took part in other Turkish campaigns subsequently,\r\nrendered this army the most formidable opponent of the forces of the\r\nFrench Revolution (1792). But the superior leading, organization and\r\nnumbers of the emperor's forces were totally inadequate to the magnitude\r\nof the task of suppressing the Revolutionary forces, and though such\r\nvictories as Neerwinden were sufficient proof of the efficiency and\r\nvalour of the Austrians, they made no headway. In later campaigns, in\r\nwhich the enemy had acquired war experience, and the best of their\r\nofficers had come to the front, the tide turned against the Imperialists\r\neven on the field of battle. The archduke Charles's victories of 1796\r\nwere more than counterbalanced by Bonaparte's Italian campaign, and the\r\ntemporary success of 1799 ended at Marengo and Hohenlinden.\r\n\r\n79. The Austrians, during the short peace which preceded the war of\r\n1805, suffered, in consequence of all this, from a feeling of distrust,\r\nnot merely in their leaders, but also in the whole system upon which the\r\narmy was raised, organized and trained. This was substantially the same\r\nas that of the Seven Years' War time. Enlistment being voluntary and for\r\nlong service, the numbers necessary to cope with the output of the\r\nFrench conscription could not be raised, and the inner history of the\r\nAustrian headquarters in the Ulm campaign shows that the dissensions and\r\nmutual distrust of the general officers had gone far towards the\r\ndisintegration of an army which at that time had the most _esprit de\r\ncorps_ and the highest military qualities of any army in Europe. But the\r\ndisasters of 1805 swept away good and bad alike in the abolition of the\r\nold system. Already the archduke Charles had designed a \"nation in arms\"\r\nafter the French model, and on this basis the reconstruction was begun.\r\nThe conscription was put in force and the necessary numbers thus\r\nobtained; the administration was at the same time reformed and the\r\norganization and supply services brought into line with modern\r\nrequirements. The war of 1809 surprised Austria in the midst of her\r\nreorganization, yet the new army fought with the greatest spirit. The\r\ninvasion of Bavaria was by no means so leisurely as it had been in 1805,\r\nand the archduke Charles obtained one signal victory over Napoleon in\r\nperson. Aspern and Wagram were most desperately contested, and though\r\nthe archduke ceased to take part in the administration after 1809 the\r\nwork went on steadily until, in 1813, the Austrian armies worthily\r\nrepresented the combination of discipline with the \"nation in arms\"\r\nprinciple. Their intervention in the War of Liberation was decisive, and\r\nAustria, in spite of her territorial losses of the past years, put into\r\nthe field well-drilled armies far exceeding in numbers those which had\r\nappeared in the wars of the Revolution. After the fall of Napoleon,\r\nAustria's hold on Italy necessitated the maintenance of a large army of\r\noccupation. This army, and in particular its cavalry, was admittedly the\r\nbest in Europe, and, having to be ready to march at a few days' notice,\r\nit was saved from the deadening influence of undisturbed peace which\r\naffected every other service in Europe from 1815 to 1850.\r\n\r\n80. The Austrian system has conserved much of the peculiar tone of the\r\narmy of 1848, of which English readers may obtain a good idea from\r\nGeorge Meredith's _Vittoria_. It was, however, a natural result of this\r\nthat the army lost to some considerable extent the spirit of the \"nation\r\nin arms\" of 1809 and 1813. It was employed in dynastic wars, and the\r\nconscription was of course modified by substitution; thus, when the war\r\nof 1859 resulted unfavourably to the Austrians, the army began to lose\r\nconfidence, precisely as had been the case in 1805. Once more, in 1866,\r\nan army animated by the purely professional spirit, which was itself\r\nweakened by distrust, met a \"nation in arms,\" and in this case a nation\r\nwell trained in peace and armed with a breechloader. Bad staff work, and\r\ntactics which can only be described as those of pique, precipitated the\r\ndisaster, and in seven weeks the victorious Prussians were almost at the\r\ngates of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe result of the war, and of the constitutional changes about this\r\ntime, was the re-adoption of the principles of 1806-1813, the abolition\r\nof conscription and long service in favour of universal service for a\r\nshort term, and a thorough reform in the methods of command and staff\r\nwork. It has been said of the Prussian army that \"discipline is--the\r\nofficers.\" This is more true of the \"K.K.\" army[1] than of any other in\r\nEurope; the great bond of union between the heterogeneous levies of\r\nrecruits of many races is the spirit of the corps of officers, which\r\nretains the personal and professional characteristics of the old army of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH ARMY\r\n\r\n81. The French army (see for further details FRANCE: _Law and\r\nInstitutions_) dates from the middle of the 15th century, at which time\r\nCharles VII. formed, from mercenaries who had served him in the Hundred\r\nYears' War, the _compagnies d'ordonnance_, and thus laid the foundation\r\nof a national standing army. But the armies that followed the kings in\r\ntheir wars still consisted mainly of mercenaries, hired for the\r\noccasion; and the work of Charles and his successors was completely\r\nundone in the confusion of the religious wars. Louvois, who was minister\r\nof Louis XIV., was the true creator of the French royal army. The\r\norganization of the first standing army is here given in some detail, as\r\nit served as a model for all armies for more than a century, and is also\r\nfollowed to some extent in our own times. Before the advent of Louvois,\r\nthe forces were royal only in name. The army was a fortuitous concourse\r\nof regiments of horse and foot, each of which was the property of its\r\ncolonel. The companies similarly belonged to their captains, and, the\r\nstate being then in no condition to buy out these vested interests,\r\nsuperior control was almost illusory. Indeed, all the well-known devices\r\nfor eluding such control, for instance, showing imaginary men on the pay\r\nlists, can be traced to the French army of the 16th century. A further\r\ndifficulty lay in the existence of the offices called Colonel-General,\r\nMarshal-General and Grand Master of Artillery, between whom no common\r\nadministration was possible. The grand master survived until 1743, but\r\nLouvois managed to suppress the other offices, and even to put one of\r\nhis own subordinates into the office of grand master. Thus was assured\r\ndirect royal control, exercised through the war minister. Louvois was\r\nunable indeed to overthrow the proprietary system, but he made stringent\r\nregulations against abuses, and confined it to the colonels (_mestre de\r\ncamp_ in the cavalry) and the captains. Henceforward the colonel was a\r\nwealthy noble, with few duties beyond that of spending money freely and\r\nof exercising his court influence on behalf of his regiment. The real\r\nwork of the service was done by the lieutenant-colonels and lieutenants,\r\nand the king and the minister recognized this on all occasions. Thus\r\nVauban was given, as a reward for good service, a company in the\r\n\"Picardie\" regiment without purchase. Promotions from the ranks were\r\nvery rare but not unknown, and all promotions were awarded according to\r\nmerit except those to captain or colonel. One of the captains in a\r\nregiment was styled major, and acted as adjutant. This post was of\r\ncourse filled by selection and not by purchase. The grades of general\r\nofficers were newly fixed by Louvois--the _brigadier, marechal de camp_,\r\nlieutenant-general and marshal of France. The general principle was to\r\ngive command, but not promotion, according to merit. The rank and file\r\nwere recruited by voluntary enlistment for four years' service. The\r\ninfantry company was maintained in peace at an effective of 60, except\r\nin the guards and the numerous foreign corps, in which the company was\r\nalways at the war strength of 100 to 200 men. This arm was composed, in\r\n1678, of the _Gardes francaises_, the Swiss guards, the old (_vieux_ and\r\n_petits vieux_) regiments of the line, of which the senior, \"Picardie,\"\r\nclaimed to be the oldest regiment in Europe, and the regiments raised\r\nunder the new system. The _regiment du roi_, which was deliberately made\r\nthe model of all others and was commanded by the celebrated Martinet,\r\nwas the senior of these latter. The whole infantry arm in 1678 numbered\r\n320,000 field and garrison troops. The cavalry consisted of the _Maison\r\ndu Roi_ (which Louvois converted from a \"show\" corps to one of the\r\nhighest discipline and valour), divided into the _Gardes du Corps_ and\r\nthe _Mousquetaires_, the _Gendarmerie_ (descended from the old feudal\r\ncavalry and the _ordonnance_ companies) and the line cavalry, the whole\r\nbeing about 55,000 strong. There were also 10,000 dragoons. In addition\r\nto the regular army, the king could call out, in case of need, the\r\nancient _arriere-ban_ or levy, as was in fact done in 1674. On that\r\noccasion, however, it behaved badly, and it was not again employed. In\r\n1688 Louvois organized a militia raised by ballot. This numbered 25,000\r\nmen and proved to be better, at any rate, than the _arriere-ban_. Many\r\ninfantry regiments of the line were, as has been said, foreign, and in\r\n1678 the foreigners numbered 30,000, the greater part of these being\r\nSwiss.\r\n\r\n82. The artillery had been an industrial concern rather than an arm of\r\nthe service. In sieges a sum of money was paid for each piece put in\r\nbattery, and the grand master was not subordinated to the war office. A\r\nnominee of Louvois, as has been said, filled the post at this time, and\r\neventually Louvois formed companies of artillerymen, and finally the\r\nregiment of \"Fusiliers\" which Vauban described as the \"finest regiment\r\nin the world.\" The engineer service, as organized by Vauban, was\r\ncomposed of engineers \"in ordinary,\" and of line officers especially\r\nemployed in war. Louvois further introduced the system of magazines. To\r\nensure the regular working of supply and transport, he instituted direct\r\ncontrol by the central executive, and stored great quantities of food in\r\nthe fortresses, thereby securing for the French armies a precision and\r\ncertainty in military operations which had hitherto been wanting. The\r\nhigher administration of the army, under the minister of war, fell into\r\ntwo branches, that of the commissaries and that of the inspecting\r\nofficers. The duties of the former resembled those of a modern \"routine\"\r\nstaff--issue of equipment, checking of returns, &c. The latter exercised\r\nfunctions analogous to those of a general staff, supervising the\r\ntraining and general efficiency of the troops. Louvois also created an\r\nexcellent hospital service, mobile and stationary, founded the Hotel des\r\nInvalides in Paris for the maintenance of old soldiers, established\r\ncadet schools for the training of young officers, and stimulated bravery\r\nand good conduct by reviving and creating military orders of merit.\r\n\r\n83. The last half of the 17th century is a brilliant period in the\r\nannals of the French armies. Thoroughly organized, animated by the\r\npresence of the king, and led by such generals as Conde, Turenne,\r\nLuxembourg, Catinat and Vendome, they made head against coalitions which\r\nembraced nearly all the powers of Europe, and made France the first\r\nmilitary nation of Europe. The reverses of the later part of Louis\r\nXIV.'s reign were not of course without result upon the tone of the\r\nFrench army, and the campaigns of Marlborough and Eugene for a time\r\ndiminished the repute in which the troops of Louis were held by other\r\npowers. Nevertheless the War of the Spanish Succession closed with\r\nFrench victories, and generals of the calibre of Villars and Berwick\r\nwere not to be found in the service of every prince. The war of the\r\nPolish Succession in Germany and Italy reflected no discredit upon the\r\nFrench arms; and the German general staff, in its history of the wars of\r\nFrederick the Great, states that \"in 1740 the French army was still\r\nregarded as the first in Europe.\" Since the death of Louvois very little\r\nhad changed. The army was still governed as it had been by the great war\r\nminister, and something had been done to reduce evils against which even\r\nhe had been powerless. A royal regiment of artillery had come into\r\nexistence, and the engineers were justly regarded as the most skilful in\r\nEurope. Certain alterations had been made in the organization of both\r\nthe guard and the line, and the total strength of the French in peace\r\nwas somewhat less than 200,000. Relatively to the numbers maintained in\r\nother states, it was thus as powerful as before. Indeed, only one\r\nfeature of importance differentiated the French army from its\r\ncontemporaries--the proportion of officers to men, which was one to\r\neleven. In view of this, the spirit of the army was necessarily that of\r\nits officers, and these were by no means the equals of their\r\npredecessors of the time of Turenne or Luxembourg. Louvois' principle of\r\nemploying professional soldiers for command and wealthy men for\r\ncolonelcies and captaincies was not deliberately adopted, but inevitably\r\ngrew out of the circumstances of the time. The system answered fairly\r\nwhilst continual wars gave the professional soldiers opportunities for\r\ndistinction and advancement. But in a long peace the captains of\r\neighteen and colonels of twenty-three blocked all promotion, and there\r\nwas no work save that of routine to be done. Under these conditions the\r\nbest soldiers sought service in other countries, the remainder lived\r\nonly for pleasure, whilst the titular chiefs of regiments and companies\r\nrarely appeared on parade. Madame de Genlis relates how, when young\r\ncourtiers departed to join their regiments for a few weeks' duty, the\r\nladies of the court decked them with favours, as if proceeding on a\r\ndistant and perilous expedition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fact that the French armies required large drafts\r\nof militia to bring up their regular forces to war strength gave them a\r\nvitality which was unusual in armies of the time. Even in the time of\r\nLouis XIV. the military spirit of the country had arisen at the threat\r\nof invasion, and the French armies of 1709 fought far more desperately,\r\nas the casualty lists of the allies at Malplaquet showed, than those of\r\n1703 or 1704. In the time of the Revolution the national spirit of the\r\nFrench army formed a rallying-point for the forces of order, whereas\r\nPrussia, whose army was completely independent of the people, lost all\r\npower of defending herself after a defeat in the field. It is difficult\r\nto summarize the conduct of the royal armies in the wars of 1740-63.\r\nWith a few exceptions the superior leaders proved themselves\r\nincompetent, and in three great battles, at least, the troops suffered\r\nignominious defeat (Dettingen 1743, Rossbach 1757, Minden 1759). On the\r\nother hand, Marshal Saxe and others of the younger generals were\r\nexcellent commanders, and Fontenoy was a victory of the first magnitude.\r\nThe administration, however, was corrupt and inefficient, and the\r\ngeneral reputation of the French armies fell so low that Frederick the\r\nGreat once refused an important command to one of his generals on the\r\nground that his experience had been gained only against French troops.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XVI. things improved somewhat; the American War and the\r\nsuccesses of Lafayette and Rochambeau revived a more warlike spirit.\r\nInstruction was more carefully attended to, and a good system of drill\r\nand tactics was elaborated at the camp of St Omer. Attempts were made to\r\nreform the administration. Artillery and engineer schools had come into\r\nexistence, and the intellectual activity of the best officers was\r\nremarkable (see Max Jahns, _Gesch. der Kriegswissenschaften_, vol. iii.\r\npassim). But the Revolution soon broke over France, and the history of\r\nthe royal army was henceforward carried on by that revolutionary army,\r\nwhich, under a new flag, was destined to raise the military fame of\r\nFrance to its greatest height.\r\n\r\n84. If Louis was the creator of the royal army, Carnot was so of the\r\nrevolutionary army. At the outbreak of the Revolution the royal army\r\nconsisted of 224 infantry battalions, 7 regiments of artillery, and 62\r\nregiments of cavalry, numbering about 173,000 in all, but capable of\r\naugmentation on war strength to 210,000. To this might be added about\r\n60,000 militia (see Chuquet, _Premiere invasion prussienne_).\r\n\r\nThe first step of the Constituent Assembly was the abrogation of an\r\nedict of 1781 whereby men of non-noble birth had been denied\r\ncommissioned rank (1790). Thus, when many of the officers emigrated\r\nalong with their fellows of the _noblesse_, trained non-commissioned\r\nofficers, who would already have been officers save for this edict, were\r\navailable to fill their places. The general scheme of reform (see\r\nCONSCRIPTION) was less satisfactory, but the formation of a National\r\nGuard, comprising in theory the whole military population, was a step of\r\nthe highest importance. At this time the titles of regiments were\r\nabandoned in favour of numbers, and the costly and dangerous _Maison du\r\nRoi_ abolished. But voluntary enlistment soon failed; the old corps,\r\nwhich kept up their discipline, were depleted, and the men went to the\r\nvolunteers, where work was less exacting and promotion more rapid.\r\n_\"Aussi fut-on,\"_ says a French writer, _\"reduit bientot a forcer\r\nl'engagement volontaire et a imposer le choix du corps.\"_ The \"first\r\ninvasion\" (July 1792) put an end to half-measures, and the country was\r\ndeclared \"in danger.\" Even these measures, however, were purely designed\r\nto meet the emergency, and, after Valmy, enthusiasm waned to such a\r\ndegree that, of a paper strength of 800,000 men (December 1792), only\r\n112,000 of the line and 290,000 volunteers were actually present. The\r\ndisasters of the following spring once more called for extreme energy,\r\nand 300,000 national guards were sent to the line, a step which was\r\nfollowed by a compulsory _levee en masse_; one million men were thus\r\nassembled to deal with the manifold dangers of civil and foreign war.\r\nFrance was saved by mere numbers and the driving energy of the\r\nTerrorists, not by discipline and organization. The latter was chaotic,\r\nand almost every element of success was wanting to the tumultuary levies\r\nof the year 1793 save a ferocious energy born of liberty and the\r\nguillotine. But under the Terrorist regime the army became the\r\nrallying-point of the nation, and when Lazare Carnot (q.v.) became\r\nminister of war a better organization and discipline began to appear.\r\nThe amalgamation of the old army and the volunteers, which had been\r\ncommenced but imperfectly carried out, was effected on a different and\r\nmore thorough principle. The infantry was organized in demi-brigades of\r\nthree battalions (usually one of the old army to two of volunteers). A\r\npermanent organization in divisions of all arms was introduced, and the\r\nablest officers selected for the commands. Arsenals and manufactories of\r\nwarlike stores were created, schools of instruction were re-established;\r\nthe republican forces were transformed from hordes to armies, well\r\ndisciplined, organized and equipped. Later measures followed the same\r\nlines, and the artillery and engineers, which in 1790 were admittedly\r\nthe best in Europe and which owing to the _roturier_ element in their\r\nofficer cadres had not been disorganized by the emigration, steadily\r\nimproved. The infantry, and in a less degree the cavalry, became good\r\nand trustworthy soldiers, and the glorious campaigns of 1794, 1795 and\r\n1796, which were the direct result of Carnot's administration, bore\r\nwitness to the potentialities of the essentially modern system. But,\r\ngreat as was the triumph of 1796-97, the exhaustion of years of\r\ncontinuous warfare had made itself felt: the armies were reduced to mere\r\nskeletons, and no sufficient means existed of replenishing them, till in\r\n1798 the _conscription_ was introduced. From that time the whole male\r\npopulation of France was practically at her ruler's disposal; and\r\nNapoleon had full scope for his genius in organizing these masses. His\r\nprincipal improvements were effected in the interval between the peace\r\nof Amiens and the war with the third coalition, while threatening the\r\ninvasion of England. His armies were collected in large camps on the\r\ncoasts of the Channel, and there received that organization which, with\r\nminor variations, they retained during all his campaigns, and which has\r\nsince been copied by all European nations. The divisions had already\r\ngiven place to the army corps, and Napoleon completed the work of his\r\npredecessors. He withdrew the whole of the cavalry and a portion of the\r\nartillery from the divisions, and thus formed \"corps troops\" and cavalry\r\nand artillery reserves for the whole army. The grade of marshal of\r\nFrance was revived at Napoleon's coronation. At the same time, the\r\noperation of Jourdan's law, acquiesced in during times of national\r\ndanger and even during peace, soon found opposition when the conscripts\r\nrealized that long foreign wars were to be their lot. It was not the\r\nactual losses of the field armies, great as these undoubtedly were,\r\nwhich led Napoleon in the full tide of his career to adopt the fatal\r\npractice of \"anticipating\" the conscription, but the steady increase in\r\nthe number of _refractaires_, men who refused to come up for service. To\r\nhunt these men down, no less than forty thousand picked soldiers were\r\nengaged within the borders of France, and the actual French element in\r\nthe armies of Napoleon grew less and less with every extension of the\r\nempire. Thus, in the Grand Army of 1809, about one-third of the corps of\r\nall arms were purely German, and in 1812 the army which invaded Russia,\r\n467,000 strong, included 280,000 foreigners. In other words, the million\r\nof men produced by the original conscription of 1793 had dwindled to\r\nabout half that number (counting the various subsidiary armies in Spain,\r\n&c.), and one hundred thousand of the best and sturdiest Frenchmen were\r\nengaged in a sort of civil war in France itself. The conscription was\r\n\"anticipated\" even in 1806, the conscripts for 1807 being called up\r\nbefore their time. As the later wars of the Empire closed one by one the\r\nforeign sources of recruiting, the conscription became more terrible\r\nevery year, with the result that more _refractaires_ and more trusted\r\nsoldiers to hunt them down were kept in non-effective employment.\r\nFinally the capacity for resistance was exhausted, and the army, from\r\nthe marshals downward, showed that it had had enough.\r\n\r\n85. One of the first acts of the Restoration was to abolish the\r\nconscription, but it had again to be resorted to within three years. In\r\n1818 the annual contingent was fixed at 40,000, and the period of\r\nservice at six years; in 1824 the contingent was increased to 60,000,\r\nand in 1832 to 80,000. Of this, however, a part only, according to the\r\nrequirements of the service, were enrolled; the remainder were sent home\r\non leave or furlough. Up to 1855 certain exemptions were authorized, and\r\nsubstitution or exchange of lots amongst young men who had drawn was\r\npermitted, but the individual drawn was obliged either to serve\r\npersonally or find a substitute. The long series of Algerian wars\r\nproduced further changes, and in 1855 the law of \"dotation\" or exemption\r\nby payment was passed, and put an end to personal substitution. The\r\nstate now undertook to provide substitutes for all who paid a fixed sum,\r\nand did so by high bounties to volunteers or to soldiers for\r\nre-engaging. Although the price of exemption was fixed as high as L92,\r\non an average 23,000 were claimed annually, and in 1859 as many as\r\n42,000 were granted. Thus gradually the conscription became rather\r\nsubsidiary to voluntary enlistment, and in 1866, out of a total\r\nestablishment of 400,000, only 120,000 were conscripts. Changes had also\r\ntaken place in the constitution of the army. On the Restoration its\r\nnumbers were reduced to 150,000, the old regiments broken up and recast,\r\nand a royal guard created in place of the old imperial one. When the\r\nrevolution of July 1830 had driven Charles X. from his throne, the royal\r\nguard, which had made itself peculiarly obnoxious, was dissolved; and\r\nduring Louis Philippe's reign the army was augmented to about 240,000\r\nwith the colours. Under the Provisional Government of 1848 it was\r\nfurther increased, and in 1854, when France allied herself with England\r\nagainst Russia, the army was raised to 500,000 men. The imperial guard\r\nwas re-created, and every effort made to revive the old Napoleonic\r\ntraditions in the army. In 1859 Napoleon III. took the field as the\r\nchampion and ally of Italy, and the victories of Montebello, Magenta and\r\nSolferino raised the reputation of the army to the highest pitch, and\r\nfor a time made France the arbiter of Europe. But the campaign of 1866\r\nsuddenly made the world aware that a rival military power had arisen,\r\nwhich was prepared to dispute that supremacy.\r\n\r\nMarshal Niel (q.v.), the then war minister, saw clearly that the\r\norganization which had with difficulty maintained 150,000 men in Italy,\r\nwas no match for that which had within a month thrown 250,000 into the\r\nvery heart of Austria, while waging a successful war on the Main against\r\nBavaria and her allies. In 1867, therefore, he brought forward a measure\r\nfor the reorganization of the army. This was to have been a true \"nation\r\nin arms\" based on universal service, and Niel calculated upon producing\r\na first-line army 800,000 strong--half with the colours, half in\r\nreserve--with a separate army of the second line. But many years must\r\nelapse before the full effect of this principle of recruiting can be\r\nproduced, as the army is incomplete in some degree until the oldest\r\nreservist is a man who has been through the line training. Niel himself\r\ndied within a year, and 1870 witnessed the complete ruin of the French\r\narmy. The law of 1868 remained therefore no more than an expression of\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n86. At the outbreak of the Franco-German War (q.v.) the French field\r\ntroops consisted of 368 battalions, 252 squadrons, and 984 guns. The\r\nstrength of the entire army on peace footing was 393,000 men; on war\r\nfooting, 567,000. Disasters followed one another in rapid succession,\r\nand the bulk of this war-trained long-service army was captive in\r\nGermany within three months of the opening battle. But the spirit of the\r\nnation rose to the occasion as it had done in 1793. The next year's\r\ncontingent of recruits was called out and hastily trained. Fourth\r\nbattalions were formed from the depot cadres, and organized into\r\n_regiments de marche_. The _gardes mobiles_ (Niel's creation) were\r\nmobilized, and by successive decrees and under various names nearly all\r\nthe manhood of the country called to arms.\r\n\r\nThe regular troops raised as _regiments de marche_, &c., amounted to\r\n213,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry and 10,000 artillery. The _garde\r\nmobile_ exceeded 300,000, and the mobilized national guard exceeded\r\n1,100,000--of whom about 180,000 were actually in the field and 250,000\r\nin Paris; the remainder preparing themselves in camps or depots for\r\nactive work. Altogether the new formations amounted to nearly 1,700,000.\r\nThough, in the face of the now war-experienced well-led and disciplined\r\nGermans, their efforts failed, this cannot detract from the admiration\r\nwhich must be felt by every soldier for the patriotism of the people and\r\nthe creative energy of their leaders, of whom Gambetta and Freycinet\r\nwere the chief. After the war every Frenchman set himself to solve the\r\narmy problem not less seriously than had every Prussian after Jena, and\r\nthe reformed French army (see FRANCE) was the product of the period of\r\nnational reconstruction. The adoption of the \"universal service\"\r\nprinciple of active army, reserves and second-line troops, the essential\r\nfeature of which is the _line_ training of every man, was almost as a\r\nmatter of course the basis of the reorganization, for the want of a\r\ntrained reserve was the most obvious cause of the disasters of \"the\r\nterrible year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN ARMY\r\n\r\n87. The German army, strictly speaking, dates only from 1871, or at\r\nearliest 1866. Before the unification of the German empire or\r\nconfederation, the several states possessed distinct armies, federal\r\narmies when required being formed from the contingents which the members\r\nof the union, like those of an ordinary alliance, engaged to furnish.\r\nThe armies of the Holy Roman Empire were similarly formed from \"single,\"\r\n\"double,\" or \"treble\" contingents under the supreme command of specially\r\nappointed field marshals of the Empire. In the troubles of 1848 there\r\nwas witnessed the curious spectacle of half of a victorious army being\r\nunable to pursue the enemy; this, being composed of \"Prussian\" as\r\ndistinct from \"federal contingent\" troops, had to stop at the frontier\r\nof another state. The events of 1866 and 1870 put an end to all this,\r\nand to a very great extent to the separate armies of the old\r\nconfederation, all being now remodelled on Prussian lines. The Prussian\r\narmy therefore is at once the most important and historically the most\r\ninteresting of the forces of the German empire. Its _debut_ (about 1630)\r\nwas not satisfactory, and in the Thirty Years' War troops of Sweden, of\r\nthe Emperor, of the League, &c., plundered Brandenburg unharmed. The\r\nelector, when appealed to for protection, could but answer, \"Que faire?\r\nIls ont des canons.\" The humiliations of this time, were, however,\r\navenged by the troops of the next ruler of Brandenburg, called the Great\r\nElector. The supposed invincibility of the Swedes did not prevent him\r\nfrom inflicting upon them a severe defeat at Fehrbellin, and thereafter\r\nthe Prussian contingents which took part in the many European wars of\r\nthe time acquitted themselves creditably. One of their generals was the\r\nfamous Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau, and the reckless gallantry of this\r\nleader was conspicuous on many fields, from Blenheim to Malplaquet. But\r\nLeopold's greatest work was done in the years of peace (1715-40), during\r\nwhich Prussia was preparing the army with which Frederick the Great won\r\nhis battles. He had introduced (about 1700) iron ramrods into the\r\ninfantry service, and for over twenty years the Prussian infantry was\r\ndrilled to a perfection which gave it a superiority of five to three\r\nover the best-drilled troops of the Austrian service, and still greater\r\npredominance over the French, which was then accounted the best in\r\nEurope. Frederick William I., king of Prussia, directed and supervised\r\nthe creation of the new Prussian army, and Leopold was his principal\r\nassistant. In organization and methods of recruiting, as well as in\r\ntactical efficiency, the army of 1740 was equally pre-eminent. Then came\r\nthe wars of Frederick the Great. It is not too much to say that the\r\ninfantry won his earlier battles; the cavalry had been neglected both by\r\nFrederick William and by Leopold, and Frederick wrote that \"it was not\r\nworth the devil's while to fetch it away.\" But the predominance of the\r\ninfantry was so far indisputable that Frederick was able to devote\r\nhimself to the reorganization of the mounted arm, with results which\r\nappeared in the splendid victories of Hohenfriedberg, Rossbach, Leuthen\r\nand Zorndorf. But long before the close of the Seven Years' War the\r\nincomparable infantry of the old army had disappeared, to be replaced by\r\nforeigners, deserters and vagabonds of all kinds, not to mention the\r\nunwilling Saxon and other recruits forced into the king's service. The\r\narmy of 200,000 men which Frederick bequeathed to his successor was\r\nindeed superb, and deserved to be the model of Europe. But with\r\nFrederick's death the genius which had animated it, and which alone gave\r\nvalue to such heterogeneous materials, was gone. The long peace had the\r\ncustomary effect of sapping the efficiency of the long-service troops.\r\nThey still retained their imposing appearance and precision of movement,\r\nand overweening self-confidence. But in 1806, after two crushing defeats\r\nand a series of humiliating surrenders, Prussia found herself at the\r\nfeet of the conqueror, shorn of half her territory, obliged to receive\r\nFrench troops in all her towns and fortresses, and only existing on\r\nsufferance. But in these very disasters were laid the seeds of her\r\nfuture greatness. By the treaty of Tilsit the Prussian army was limited\r\nto 43,000 men. This limitation suggested to Scharnhorst \"universal\r\nservice\" on the _Krumper_[2] system already described (see S 36 above).\r\n\r\n88. The bitter humiliation and suffering endured under the French yoke\r\naroused a national spirit which was capable of any sacrifices. The\r\ncivilian became eager to be trained to fight against the oppressor of\r\nhis country; and when Prussia rose in 1813, the armies she poured into\r\nthe field were no longer professional, but national armies, imperfectly\r\ntrained and organized, but animated by a spirit which more than\r\ncompensated for these defects. At the close of the war her rulers, with\r\nfar-seeing sagacity, at once devoted themselves to organize on a\r\npermanent footing the system which had sprung up under the necessities\r\nand enthusiasm of the moment. Universal compulsory service, and a three\r\nyears' term in the ranks, with further periods in the reserve and\r\n_Landwehr_, were then introduced; and though variations have\r\nsubsequently been made in the distribution of time, the principles were\r\nsubstantially the same as those now in force. By the law of 1814 the\r\nperiods of service were fixed at three years in the army, two in the\r\nreserve and fourteen in the _Landwehr_, and the annual contingent at\r\n40,000 men. As the population increased, it was felt that the service\r\nwas unequally distributed, pressing unnecessarily heavily on some, while\r\nothers escaped altogether. Further, the experiences of Bronnzell and\r\nOlmutz in 1850, and of 1859, when Prussia armed in anticipation of a war\r\nwith France, aroused great doubts as to the efficiency of the\r\n_Landwehr_, which then formed the bulk of Prussia's forces, and of whom\r\nmany had been as long as ten years away from the colours. At this time\r\nthe French remark that the Prussian army was \"a sort of militia\" was by\r\nno means untrue. Accordingly, by the law of 1860 the annual contingent\r\nwas fixed at 63,000, the period in the reserve was increased from two to\r\nfour years, and that in the _Landwehr_ reduced from fourteen to five.\r\nThe total armed force thus remained nearly the same (12 contingents of\r\n63,000, in place of 19 of 40,000), but the army and its reserves were\r\nmore than doubled (increased from 5 X 40,000 to 7 X 63,000) while the\r\n_Landwehr_ was proportionately reduced.\r\n\r\nThis change was not effected without great opposition, and led to a\r\nprolonged struggle between the king, guided by Bismarck, and the\r\nparliament. It required the victories of 1866 and 1870, and the position\r\nthereby won for Prussia, to reconcile the nation to the new law. The\r\nmilitary alliance (1866) of Prussia with the other German states gave\r\nplace in 1871 to the union of all the armies into the German army as it\r\nis to-day. Some retained their old peculiarities of uniform, and even\r\nmore than this was allowed to Bavaria and to Saxony, but the whole army,\r\nwhich has been increased year by year to its present strength, is\r\nmodelled on the Prussian part of it. The Prussian army corps are the\r\nGuard, and the line numbered I. to XI., and XV. to XVIII.\r\n\r\n89. The _Saxon Army_ formerly played a prominent part in all the wars of\r\nnorthern Europe, chiefly in connexion with Poland. In the War of the\r\nAustrian Succession the Saxon army played a prominent part, but in the\r\nend it suffered a heavy defeat in the battle of Kesselsdorf (1745). In\r\nthe Seven Years' War Saxony was overrun by the Prussians almost without\r\nresistance, and the military forces of the country under Field Marshal\r\nRutowski were forced to surrender _en masse_ at Pirna (1756); the men\r\nwere compelled by Frederick the Great to join the Prussian army, and\r\nfought, though most unwillingly, through the remainder of the war as\r\nPrussian soldiers. A few outlying regiments which had not been involved\r\nin the catastrophe served with the Austrians, and on one occasion at\r\nleast, at Kolin, inflicted a severe blow on the Prussians. At the\r\noutbreak of the wars of the French Revolution the Saxon army was over\r\n30,000 strong. It took part in the campaign of Jena on the side of the\r\nPrussians, and during the Napoleonic domination in Germany Saxony\r\nfurnished strong contingents to the armies of Napoleon, who in return\r\nrecognized her elector as king, and largely increased his territories.\r\nThe newly made king remained faithful to Napoleon even in his reverses;\r\nbut the army was too German in feeling to fight willingly under the\r\nFrench flag. Their defection at Leipzig contributed not a little to the\r\nresults of that bloody day. After the peace the king was shorn of a\r\ngreat part of his dominions, and the army was reconstituted on a smaller\r\nscale. In 1866 Saxony sided with Austria, and her army shared in the\r\ndisasters of the brief campaign and the crowning defeat at Koniggratz.\r\nUnder the crown prince's leadership, however, the Saxons distinguished\r\nthemselves by their courage and steadiness wherever they were engaged.\r\nAfter the war Saxony became part of the North German Confederation, and\r\nin 1870-1871 her troops, under the command of the crown prince, formed\r\nthe XII. corps of the great German army. They were assigned to the II.\r\narmy of Prince Frederick Charles, and delivered the decisive attack on\r\nthe French right at Gravelotte. Subsequently a IV. army was formed under\r\nthe command of the crown prince, in which the XII. corps, now under\r\nPrince George of Saxony, served with unvarying credit in the campaign of\r\nSedan and the siege of Paris. The Saxon army is now organized in every\r\nrespect on Prussian lines, and forms two army corps (XII. at Dresden and\r\nXIX. at Leipzig) of the German army. The German emperor, in concert with\r\nthe king of Saxony, names the officers for the higher commands. Saxony\r\nretains, however, her separate war ministry, budget, &c.; and\r\nappointments and promotion to all but the highest commands are made by\r\nthe king. The colours of the older Saxon forces, and especially the\r\ngreen of the tunics, are retained in many of the uniforms of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n  90. The _Bavarian Army_ has perhaps the most continuous record of good\r\n  service in the field of any of the minor German armies. The oldest\r\n  regiments date from the Thirty Years' War, in which the veteran army\r\n  of the Catholic league, commanded by Count Tilly and formed on the\r\n  nucleus of the Bavarian army, played a conspicuous part. Later in the\r\n  war the Bavarian general, Count Mercy, proved himself a worthy\r\n  opponent of Turenne and Conde. Henceforward the Bavarians were engaged\r\n  in almost every war between France and Austria, taking part\r\n  successively in the wars of the Grand Alliance, the Spanish Succession\r\n  (in which they came into conflict with the English), and the Polish\r\n  and Austrian Succession wars. In pursuance of the traditional\r\n  anti-Austrian policy, the troops of Bavaria, led by a distinguished\r\n  Bavarian, Marshal (Prince) Wrede, served in the campaigns of 1805 to\r\n  1813 side by side with the French, and Napoleon made the electorate\r\n  into a kingdom. But in 1813 Bavaria joined the Alliance, and Wrede\r\n  tried to intercept the French on their retreat from Leipzig. Napoleon,\r\n  however, inflicted a severe defeat on his old general at Hanau, and\r\n  opened his road to France. In 1866 the Bavarians took part against\r\n  Prussia, but owing to their dilatoriness in taking the field, the\r\n  Prussians were able to beat them in detail. In 1870, reorganized to\r\n  some extent on Prussian lines, they joined their former enemy in the\r\n  war against France, and bore their full share in the glories and\r\n  losses of the campaign, the II. Bavarian corps having suffered more\r\n  heavily than any but the III. Prussian corps. The I. Bavarian corps\r\n  distinguished itself very greatly at Sedan and on the Loire. Bavaria\r\n  still retains her separate war office and special organization, and\r\n  the troops have been less affected by the Prussian influence than\r\n  those of the other states. The Bavarian corps are numbered separately\r\n  (I. Bav., Munich; II. Bav., Wurzburg; III. Bav., Nuremberg), and the\r\n  old light blue uniforms and other distinctive peculiarities of detail\r\n  are still maintained.\r\n\r\n  91. _Wurttemberg_ furnishes one army corps (XIII.; headquarters,\r\n  Stuttgart), organized, clothed and equipped in all respects like the\r\n  Prussian army. Like the Bavarians, the Wurttembergers fought against\r\n  the Prussians in 1866, but in 1870 made common cause with them against\r\n  the French, and by the convention entered into the following year\r\n  placed their army permanently under the command of the Prussian king\r\n  as emperor. The emperor nominates to the highest commands, but the\r\n  king of Wurttemberg retains the nomination and appointment of officers\r\n  in the lower grades.\r\n\r\n  92. The old _Hanoverian Army_ disappeared, of course, with the\r\n  annexation of Hanover to Prussia in 1866, but it is still represented\r\n  officially by certain regiments of the X. army corps, and, in one case\r\n  at least, battle honours won by the King's German Legion in the\r\n  British service are borne on German colours of to-day. The _Hessian\r\n  Army_ is now represented by the XXV. (Grand-ducal Hessian) division,\r\n  which forms part of the XVIII. army corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN ARMY\r\n\r\n93. The old conscription law of the kingdom of Sardinia is the basis of\r\nthe military organization of Italy, as its constitution is of that of\r\nthe modern Italian kingdom. The Piedmontese have long borne a high\r\nreputation for their military qualities, a reputation shared by the\r\nrulers of the house of Savoy (q.v.), many of whom showed special ability\r\nin preserving the independence of their small kingdom between two such\r\npowerful neighbours as France and Austria. During the wars of the French\r\nRevolution Piedmont was temporarily absorbed into the French republic\r\nand empire. The Italian troops who fought under Napoleon proved\r\nthemselves, in many if not most cases, the best of the French allies,\r\nand Italy contributed large numbers of excellent general officers to the\r\n_Grande Armee_.\r\n\r\n  After 1815 various causes combined to place Piedmont (Sardinia) at the\r\n  head of the national movement which agitated Italy during the ensuing\r\n  thirty years, and bring her in direct antagonism to Austria. Charles\r\n  Albert, her then ruler, had paid great attention to the army, and when\r\n  Italy rose against Austria in 1848 he took the field with an excellent\r\n  force of nearly 70,000 men. At the outset fortune favoured the arms of\r\n  Italy; but the genius and energy of Radetzky, the veteran Austrian\r\n  commander, turned the tide, and in the summer of 1849 after many\r\n  battles the Piedmontese army was decisively defeated at Novara, and\r\n  her king compelled to sue for peace. Charles Albert abdicated in\r\n  favour of his son Victor Emanuel, a prince who had already\r\n  distinguished himself by his personal gallantry in the field. Under\r\n  his care the army soon recovered its efficiency, and the force which\r\n  joined the allied armies in the Crimea attracted general admiration\r\n  from the excellence of its organization, equipment and discipline. In\r\n  1859 Piedmont again took up arms against Austria for the liberation of\r\n  Italy; but this time she had the powerful assistance of France, and\r\n  played but a subordinate part herself. In this campaign the Sardinian\r\n  army was composed of one cavalry and five infantry divisions, and\r\n  numbered about 60,000 combatants. By the peace of Villafranca, Italy,\r\n  with the exception of Venetia, was freed from the Austrians, and\r\n  Lombardy was added to Piedmont. The revolutionary campaign of\r\n  Garibaldi in the following year united the whole peninsula under the\r\n  rule of Victor Emanuel, and in 1866, when Italy for the third time\r\n  took up arms against Austria--this time as the ally of Prussia--her\r\n  forces had risen to nearly 450,000, of whom about 270,000 actually\r\n  took the field. But in quality these were far from being equal to the\r\n  old Piedmontese army; and the northern army, under the personal\r\n  command of the king, was decisively defeated at Custozza by the\r\n  archduke Albert of Austria.\r\n\r\n  The existing organization of the Italian army is determined by the\r\n  laws of 1873, which made universal liability to service the basis of\r\n  recruiting. The territorial system has not, however, been adopted at\r\n  the same time, the materials of which the Italian army is composed\r\n  varying so much that it was decided to blend the different types of\r\n  soldiers so far as possible by causing them to serve together. The\r\n  colonial wars in which Italian troops have taken part have been marked\r\n  with great disasters, but relieved by the gallantry of the officers\r\n  and the rank and file.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN ARMY\r\n\r\n94. The history of the Russian army begins with the abolition of the\r\nStrelitz (q.v.) by Peter the Great in 1698, the nucleus of the new\r\nforces being four regiments of foot, two of which are well known to-day\r\nunder their old titles of Preobrazhenski and Semenovski. Throughout the\r\n18th century Russian military progress obeyed successive dynasties of\r\nwestern European models--first those of Prussia, then those of France.\r\nIn the earlier part of the 19th century the army, used chiefly in wars\r\nagainst the revolutionary spirit, became, like others of that time, a\r\ndynastic force; subsequently the \"nation in arms\" principle reasserted\r\nitself, and on this basis has been carried out the reorganization of\r\nRussia's military power. The enormous development of this since 1874 is\r\none of the most striking phenomena in recent military history. In 1892,\r\nin expectation of a general European war, whole armies were massed in\r\nthe districts of Warsaw and Vilna, three-fifths of the entire forces\r\nbeing in position on the German and Austrian frontiers.\r\n\r\n  The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 is generally held to have proved that\r\n  the fighting power of the Russian has in no way diminished in\r\n  intrinsic value from that of the days of Zorndorf, Borodino and\r\n  Sevastopol. The proverbial stubbornness of the rank and file is the\r\n  distinctive quality of the armies of the tsar, and in view of the\r\n  general adoption of two-years' service in other countries it is a\r\n  matter for grave consideration whether, against European forces and in\r\n  defence of their own homes, the Russians would not prove more than\r\n  formidable antagonists to the men of more highly individualized races\r\n  who are their probable opponents. Equally remarkable is the new power\r\n  of redistribution possessed by Russia. Formerly it was usual to count\r\n  upon one campaign at least elapsing before Russia could intervene\r\n  effectively in European wars; much, in fact the greater part, of her\r\n  losses in the Crimean War was due to the enormous distances which had\r\n  to be traversed on foot. Nowadays the original equal distribution of\r\n  the army over the country has been modified in accordance with the\r\n  political needs of each moment. In 1892 the centre of gravity was\r\n  shifted to Poland and Kiev, in 1904 the performances of the\r\n  trans-Siberian railway in transporting troops to the seat of war in\r\n  Manchuria excited the admiration of military Europe. The attitude of\r\n  the army in the troubles which followed upon the Japanese War belongs\r\n  to the history of Russia, not to that of military organization, and it\r\n  will be sufficient to say that the conduct of the \"nation in arms\" at\r\n  times of political unrest may vary between the extremes of\r\n  unquestioning obedience to authority and the most dangerous form of\r\n  licence, examples of both being frequent in the history of nearly all\r\n  national armies. A remarkable innovation in the modern history of this\r\n  army is the conversion of the whole of the cavalry, except a few\r\n  _elite_ regiments, into dragoons of the old type. After the war of\r\n  1904-5, however, this policy was reversed and the cavalry reformed on\r\n  the usual model. The Cossacks still retain to a large extent the\r\n  peculiarities of the light troops of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH ARMY\r\n\r\n95. The feudal sovereignties of medieval Spain differed but little, in\r\ntheir military organization, from other feudal states. As usual,\r\nmercenaries were the only forces on which reliance was placed for\r\nforeign wars. These troops called _almugavares_ (Arabic = scouts) won a\r\ngreat reputation on Italian and Greek battlefields of the 13th century,\r\nand with many transformations in name and character appeared from time\r\nto time up to the Peninsular War. Castile, however, had a military\r\nsystem very different from the rest. The forces of the kingdom were\r\ncomposed of local contingents similar to the English _fyrd_,\r\nprofessional soldiers who were paid followers of the great lords, and\r\nthe heavy cavalry of the military orders. The groups of cities called\r\n_Hermandades_, while they existed, also had permanent forces in their\r\npay. At the union of Castile and Aragon the Castilian methods received a\r\nmore general application. The new _Hermandad_ was partly a light\r\ncavalry, partly a police, and was organized in the ratio of one soldier\r\nto every hundred families. In the conquest of Grenada (1482-92)\r\n_mesnadas_ or contingents were furnished by the crown, the nobles and\r\nthe cities, and permanently kept in the field. The _Hermandad_ served\r\nthroughout the war as a matter of course. From the veterans of this war\r\nwas drawn the army which in the Italian wars won its reputation as the\r\nfirst army in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1596 the home defence of Spain was reorganized and the _ordenanza_,\r\nor militia, which was then formed of all men not belonging to the still\r\nextant feudal contingents, was generally analogous to the system of\r\n\"assizes at arms\" in England. This _ordenanza_ served in the Peninsular\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n  96. With the Italian wars of the early 16th century came the\r\n  development of the regular army; a brief account of its place in the\r\n  evolution of armies has been given above. Discipline, the feeling of\r\n  comradeship and soldierly honour were the qualities which marked out\r\n  the Spanish army as the model for others to follow, and for more than\r\n  a century the Spanish army maintained its prestige as the first in\r\n  Europe. The oldest regiments of the present Spanish army claiming\r\n  descent from the _tercios_ date from 1535. An officer whose regiment\r\n  was reduced commonly took a pike in some other corps (e.g. Tilly), the\r\n  _senor soldado_ was counted as a gentleman, and his wife and family\r\n  received state allowances. Nor was this army open only to Spaniards.\r\n  Walloons, Italians, Burgundians and other nationalities ruled over by\r\n  the Habsburgs all contributed their quotas. But the career of the old\r\n  army came to an end at Rocroi (1643), and after this the forces of the\r\n  monarchy began more and more to conform to the French model.\r\n\r\n  97. The military history of Spain from 1650 to 1700 is full of\r\n  incident, and in the long war of the Spanish Succession both the army\r\n  and the _ordenanza_ found almost continuous employment. They were now\r\n  organized, as were most other armies of Europe, on the lines of the\r\n  French army, and in 1714 the old _tercios_, which had served in the\r\n  Spanish Netherlands under Marlborough, were brought to Spain. The\r\n  king's regiment \"Zamora\" of the present army descends from one of\r\n  these which, as the _tercio_ of Bovadilla, had been raised in 1580.\r\n  The army underwent few changes of importance during the 18th century,\r\n  and it is interesting to note that there were never less than three\r\n  Irish regiments in the service. In 1808 the _Irlanda, Ultonia_ (=\r\n  Ulster) and _Hibernia_ regiments had come to consist (as had similar\r\n  corps in the French service before the Revolution) largely of native\r\n  soldiers. At that time the Spanish army consisted of 119 Spanish and\r\n  foreign (Swiss, Walloon and Irish) battalions, with 24 cavalry\r\n  regiments and about 8000 artillery and engineers. There were further\r\n  51 battalions of militia, and the total forces numbered actually\r\n  137,000. The part played by the Spanish standing army in the\r\n  Peninsular War was certainly wholly insignificant relatively to these\r\n  figures. It must be borne in mind, however, that only continued wars\r\n  can give real value to long-service troops of the old style, and this\r\n  advantage the Spanish regulars did not possess. Further, the general\r\n  decadence of administration reacted in the usual way, the appointment\r\n  of court favourites to high command was a flagrant evil, and all that\r\n  can be urged is that the best elements of the army behaved as well as\r\n  did the Prussians of 1806, that the higher leading and the\r\n  administration of the army in the field were both sufficiently weak to\r\n  have ruined most armies, and that the men were drawn from the same\r\n  country and the same classes which furnished the _guerrilleros_ whom\r\n  it became fashionable to exalt at the expense of the soldiers. In the\r\n  later campaigns of Wellington, Spanish divisions did good service, and\r\n  the corps of La Romana (a picked contingent of troops which had been\r\n  sent before the war to Denmark at Napoleon's instance), though often\r\n  defeated, always retained some cohesion and discipline. But the result\r\n  of this war, the second French invasion, and the continued civil wars\r\n  of the 19th century was the destruction of the old army, and the\r\n  present army of Spain still bears traces of the confusion out of which\r\n  it arose.\r\n\r\n  The most important changes were in 1870, when conscription was\r\n  introduced, and in 1872, when universal service was proposed in its\r\n  place. The military virtues of the rank and file and the devotion of\r\n  the officers were conspicuously displayed in the Spanish-American War\r\n  of 1898, and it cannot be claimed even for the Germans of 1870 that\r\n  they fired so coolly and accurately as did the defenders of S. Juan\r\n  and El Caney.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH ARMY\r\n\r\n98. The writers who have left the most complete and trustworthy\r\ncontemporary accounts of the Turkish army in the 14th and 15th\r\ncenturies, when it reached the height of its most characteristic\r\ndevelopment, are Bertrandon de la Brocquiere, equerry to Philip the\r\nGood, duke of Burgundy, and Francesco Filelfo of Tolentino. Bertrandon,\r\na professional soldier, visited Palestine in 1432, and returned overland\r\nin 1433, traversing the Balkan Peninsula by the main trade-route from\r\nConstantinople to Belgrade. He wrote an account of his journey for\r\nPhilip: see _Early Travels in Palestine_, translated and edited by T.\r\nWright (London, 1848). Filelfo served as secretary to the Venetian\r\n_baylo_ at Constantinople, and recorded his observations in a series of\r\nletters (see FILELFO). Both ascribe the military superiority of the\r\nTurks over the nations of western Europe to two facts--firstly to their\r\npossession of a well-organized standing army, an institution unknown\r\nelsewhere, and secondly to their far stricter discipline, itself a\r\nresult of their military organization and of the moral training afforded\r\nby Islam.\r\n\r\n  The regular troops comprised the Janissaries (q.v.), a corps of\r\n  infantry recruited from captured sons of Christians, and trained to\r\n  form a privileged caste of scientific soldiers and religious fanatics;\r\n  and the Spahis, a body of cavalry similarly recruited, and armed with\r\n  scimitar, mace and bow. Celibacy was one of the rules of this standing\r\n  army, which, in its semi-monastic ideals and constitution, resembled\r\n  the knightly orders of the West in their prime. The Janissaries\r\n  numbered about 12,000, the Spahis about 8000. A second army of some\r\n  40,000 men, mostly mounted and armed like the Spahis, was feudal in\r\n  character, and consisted chiefly of the personal followers of the\r\n  Moslem nobility; more than half its numbers were recruited in Europe.\r\n  This force of 60,000 trained soldiers was accompanied by a horde of\r\n  irregulars, levied chiefly among the barbarous mountaineers of the\r\n  Balkans and Asia Minor, and very ill-armed and ill-disciplined. Their\r\n  numbers may be estimated at 140,000, for Bertrandon gives 200,000 as\r\n  the total of the Turkish forces. Many 15th and 16th century writers\r\n  give a smaller total, but refer only to the standing and feudal\r\n  armies. Others place the total higher. Laonicus Chalcocondylas in his\r\n  _Turcica Historia_ states that at the siege of Constantinople in 1453\r\n  the sultan commanded 400,000 troops, but most other eye-witnesses of\r\n  the siege give a total varying from 150,000 to 300,000. Many Christian\r\n  soldiers of fortune enlisted with the Turks as artillerists or\r\n  engineers, and supplied them at Constantinople with the most powerful\r\n  cannon of the age. Other Christians were compelled to serve as\r\n  engineers or in the ranks. As late as 1683 a corps of Wallachians was\r\n  forced to join the Turkish army before Vienna, and entrusted with the\r\n  task of bridging the Danube. But in the 18th and early 19th centuries\r\n  the introduction of Christians tended to weaken the _moral_ of the\r\n  army already sapped by defeat; it was found impossible to maintain the\r\n  discipline of the Janissaries, whose privileges had become a source of\r\n  danger; and the feudal nobility became more and more independent of\r\n  the sultan's authority. These three causes contributed to make\r\n  reorganization inevitable.\r\n\r\n  The destruction of the Janissaries in 1826 marked the close of the\r\n  history of the old Turkish army; already the re-creation of the\r\n  service on the accepted models of western Europe had been commenced.\r\n  This was still incomplete when the new force was called upon to meet\r\n  the Russians in 1828, and though the army displayed its accustomed\r\n  bravery, its defective organization and other causes led to its\r\n  defeat. Since then the army has been almost as constantly on active\r\n  service as the British; the Crimean War, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\r\n  and the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 witnessed the employment of a large\r\n  proportion of the sultan's available forces, while innumerable local\r\n  revolts in different parts of the empire called for great exertions,\r\n  and often for fierce fighting on the part of the troops locally in\r\n  garrison and those sent up from the nearest provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES ARMY\r\n\r\n99. The regular army of the United States has always been small. From\r\nthe first it has been a voluntary force, and until 1898 its chief work\r\nin peace was to furnish numerous small posts on the frontier and amongst\r\nthe Indians, and to act as a reserve to the civil power in the great\r\ncities. In war-time the regular army, if, as was usually the case, it\r\nwas insufficient in numbers for the task of subduing the enemy, formed\r\nthe nucleus of large armies raised \"for the war.\" In 1790 the rank and\r\nfile of the army, as fixed by act of Congress, amounted to 1216 men; and\r\nin 1814 an English expedition of only 3500 men was able to seize and\r\nburn Washington, the capital of a country which even then numbered eight\r\nmillions of inhabitants. In 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War, the\r\nwhole regular force amounted to about 15,300 men. In April of that year\r\nthe president called out 75,000 volunteers for three months; and in May\r\na further call for 42,000 was made. In July a call for 500,000 men was\r\nauthorized by Congress, and as even this vast force proved insufficient\r\nit was found necessary to use a system of drafts. In October 1863 a levy\r\nof 300,000 men was ordered, and in February 1864 a further call of\r\n500,000 was made. Finally, in the beginning of 1865 two further levies,\r\namounting in all to 500,000 men, were ordered, but were only partially\r\ncarried out in consequence of the cessation of hostilities. The total\r\nnumber of men called under arms by the government of the United States,\r\nbetween April 1861 and April 1865, amounted to 2,759,049, of whom\r\n2,656,053 were actually embodied in the armies. If to these be added the\r\n1,100,000 men embodied by the South during the same time, the total\r\narmed forces reach the enormous amount of nearly four millions, drawn\r\nfrom a population of only 32 millions--figures before which the\r\ncelebrated uprising of the French nation in 1793, or the efforts of\r\nFrance and Germany in the Franco-German War, sink into insignificance.\r\nThese 2,700,000 Federals were organized into volunteer regiments bearing\r\nstate designations. The officers, except general and staff officers,\r\nwere appointed by the governors of the respective states. The maximum\r\nauthorized strength of the regular army never, during the war, exceeded\r\n40,000 men; and the number in the field, especially towards the close of\r\nthe war, was very much less. The states, in order to obtain men to fill\r\ntheir quotas, offered liberal bounties to induce men to enlist, and it\r\ntherefore became very difficult to obtain recruits for the regular army,\r\nfor which no bounties were given. The regular regiments accordingly\r\ndwindled away to skeletons. The number of officers present was also much\r\nreduced, since many of them, while retaining their regular commissions,\r\nheld higher rank in the volunteer army. After the close of the Civil War\r\nthe volunteers were mustered out; and by the act of Congress of the 28th\r\nof July 1866 the line of the army was made to consist of 10 regiments of\r\ncavalry of 12 troops each, 5 regiments of artillery of 12 batteries each\r\nand 45 regiments of infantry of 10 companies. The actual strength in\r\nAugust 1867 was 53,962. The act of the 3rd of March 1869 reduced the\r\nnumber of infantry regiments to 25 and the enlisted strength of the army\r\nto 35,036. The numbers were further reduced, without change in\r\norganization, to 32,788 in 1870 and to 25,000 in 1874. The latter number\r\nremained the maximum for twenty-four years.\r\n\r\nIn March 1898, in view of hostilities with Spain, the artillery was\r\nincreased by 2 regiments, and, in April, 2 companies were added to each\r\ninfantry regiment, giving it 3 battalions of 4 companies each. The\r\nstrength of batteries, troops and companies was increased, the maximum\r\nenlisted strength reached during 1898 being over 63,000. A volunteer\r\narmy was also organized. Of this army, 3 regiments of engineer troops, 3\r\nof cavalry and 10 of infantry were United States volunteers, all the\r\nofficers being commissioned by the president. The other organizations\r\ncame from the states, the officers being appointed by the respective\r\ngovernors. As fast as they were organized and filled up, they were\r\nmustered into the service of the United States. The total number\r\nfurnished for the war with Spain was 10,017 officers and 213,218\r\nenlisted men. All general and staff officers were appointed by the\r\npresident. Three hundred and eighty-seven officers of the regular army\r\nreceived volunteer commissions. After the conclusion of hostilities with\r\nSpain, the mustering out of the volunteers was begun, and by June 1899\r\nall the volunteers, except those in the Philippines, were out of the\r\nservice. The latter, as well as those serving elsewhere, having enlisted\r\nonly for the war, were brought home and mustered out as soon as\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe act of the 2nd of March 1899 added 2 batteries to each regiment of\r\nartillery. On the 2nd of February 1901 Congress passed an important bill\r\nproviding for the reorganization and augmentation (max. 100,000) of the\r\nregular army, and other measures followed in the next years. (See UNITED\r\nSTATES.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR ARMIES\r\n\r\n  100. _Dutch and Belgian Armies._--The military power of the \"United\r\n  Provinces\" dates its rise from the middle of the 16th century, when,\r\n  after a long and sanguinary struggle, they succeeded in emancipating\r\n  themselves from the yoke of Spain; and in the following century it\r\n  received considerable development in consequence of the wars they had\r\n  to maintain against Louis XIV. In 1702 they had in their pay upwards\r\n  of 100,000 men, including many English and Scottish regiments, besides\r\n  30,000 in the service of the Dutch East India Company. But the\r\n  slaughter of Malplaquet deprived the republic of the flower of the\r\n  army. Its part in the War of the Austrian Succession was far from\r\n  being as creditable as its earlier deeds, a Prussian army overran\r\n  Holland in 1787 almost without opposition, and at the beginning of the\r\n  wars of the French Revolution the army had fallen to 36,000 men. In\r\n  1795 Holland was conquered by the French under Pichegru, and in the\r\n  course of the changes which ensued the army was entirely reorganized,\r\n  and under French direction bore its share in the great wars of the\r\n  empire.\r\n\r\n  With the fall of Napoleon and the reconstitution of the Netherlands,\r\n  the Dutch-Belgian army, formed of the troops of the now united\r\n  countries, came into existence. The army fought at Waterloo, but was\r\n  not destined to a long career, for the revolution of 1830 brought\r\n  about the separation of Belgium. A Dutch garrison under Baron Chasse,\r\n  a distinguished veteran of the Napoleonic wars, defended Antwerp\r\n  against the French under Marshal Gerard, and the Netherlands have been\r\n  engaged in many arduous colonial wars in the East Indies. The Belgian\r\n  army similarly has contributed officers and non-commissioned officers\r\n  to the service of the Congo Free State.\r\n\r\n  101. _Swiss Army._--The inhabitants of Switzerland were always a hardy\r\n  and independent race, but their high military reputation dates from\r\n  the middle of the 15th century, when the comparatively ill-armed and\r\n  untrained mountaineers signally defeated Charles the Bold of Burgundy\r\n  and the flower of the chivalry of Europe in the battles of Granson,\r\n  Morat and Nancy. The Swabian war, towards the end of that century, and\r\n  the Milanese war, at the beginning of the following one, added to the\r\n  fame of the Swiss infantry, and made it the model on which that arm\r\n  was formed all over Europe. The wealthier countries vied with each\r\n  other in hiring them as mercenaries, and the poor but warlike Swiss\r\n  found the profession of arms a lucrative one.\r\n\r\n  A brief account of the Swiss mercenaries will be found earlier in this\r\n  article. Their fall was due in the end to their own indiscipline in\r\n  the first place, and the rise of the Spanish standing army and its\r\n  musketeers in the second. Yet it does not seem that the military\r\n  reputation of the Swiss was discredited, even by reverses such as\r\n  Marignan. On the contrary, they continued all through the 17th and\r\n  18th centuries to furnish whole regiments for the service of other\r\n  countries, notably of France, and individuals, like Jomini in a later\r\n  age, followed the career of the soldier of fortune everywhere. The\r\n  most notable incident in the later military history of the Swiss, the\r\n  heroic faithfulness of Louis XVI.'s Swiss guard, is proverbial, and\r\n  has been commemorated with just pride by their countrymen. The French\r\n  Revolutionary armies overran Switzerland, as they did all the small\r\n  neighbouring states, and during Napoleon's career she had to submit to\r\n  his rule, and furnish her contingent to his armies. On the fall of\r\n  Napoleon she regained her independence, and returned to her old trade\r\n  of furnishing soldiers to the sovereigns and powers of Europe. Charles\r\n  X. of France had at one time as many as 17,000 Swiss in his pay;\r\n  Naples and Rome had each four regiments. The recruiting for these\r\n  foreign services was openly acknowledged and encouraged by the\r\n  government. The young Swiss engaged usually for a period of four or\r\n  six years; they were formed in separate regiments, officered by\r\n  countrymen of their own, and received a higher rate of pay than the\r\n  national regiments; and at the close of their engagement returned with\r\n  their earnings to settle down on their paternal holdings. A series of\r\n  revolutions, however, expelled them from France and Italy, and\r\n  recently the advance of liberal ideas, and the creation of great\r\n  national armies based on the principle of personal service, has\r\n  destroyed their occupation. Switzerland is now remarkable in a\r\n  military sense as being the only country that maintains no standing\r\n  army (see Militia).\r\n\r\n  102. The _Swedish Army_ can look back with pride to the days of\r\n  Gustavus Adolphus and of Charles XII. The contributions made by it to\r\n  the military science of the 17th century have been noticed above. The\r\n  triumphs of the small and highly disciplined army of Charles were\r\n  often such as to recall the similar victories of the Greeks under\r\n  Alexander. The then nebulous armies of Russia and Poland resembled\r\n  indeed the forces of Darius in the 4th century B.C., but Peter the\r\n  Great succeeded at last in producing a true army, and the resistance\r\n  of the Swedes collapsed under the weight of the vastly superior\r\n  numbers then brought against them.\r\n\r\n  The _Danish Army_ has a long and meritorious record of good service\r\n  dating from the Thirty Years' War.\r\n\r\n  103. The existing Army of _Portugal_ dates from the Peninsular War,\r\n  when a considerable force of Portuguese, at one time exceeding 60,000\r\n  men, was organized under Marshal Beresford. Trained and partly\r\n  officered by English officers, it proved itself not unworthy of its\r\n  allies, and bore its full share in the series of campaigns and battles\r\n  by which the French were ultimately expelled from Spain. At the peace\r\n  the army numbered about 50,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry, formed on\r\n  the English model, and all in the highest state of efficiency. This\r\n  force was reduced in 1821, under the new constitutional government, to\r\n  about one-half.\r\n\r\n  104. The _Rumanian, Bulgarian_ and _Servian_ armies are the youngest\r\n  in Europe. The conduct of the Rumanians before Plevna in 1877 earned\r\n  for them the respect of soldiers of all countries. Servia and Bulgaria\r\n  came to war in 1885, and the Bulgarian soldiers, under the most\r\n  adverse conditions, achieved splendid victories under the leadership\r\n  of their own officers. In the crisis following the Austrian annexation\r\n  of Bosnia-Herzegovina (1908-9), it seemed likely that the Servian\r\n  forces might play an unexpectedly active part in war even with a\r\n  strong power.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Below are the titles of some of the more important\r\n  works on the subject of armies.

After serving in the army,\r\nand working in a button factory, he took to the stage. His first\r\nappearance (1815) was in tragedy, and for some time he was unsuccessful;\r\nit was not until 1827 that he showed his real ability in comedy parts,\r\nespecially in plays by Felix August Duvert (1795-1876) and Augustin\r\nTheodore Lauzanne (1805-1877), whose _Cabinets particuliers_ (1832), _Le\r\nMari de la dame de choeurs_ (1837), _Passe minuit, L'Homme blase_\r\n(1843), _La Clef dans le dos_ (1848), &c., contained parts written for\r\nhim.

Arnal was the\r\nauthor of _Epitre a bouffe_ (1840), which is reprinted in his volume of\r\npoetry, _Boutades en vers_ (1861).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNALDUS DE VILLA NOVA, also called ARNALDUS DE VILLANUEVA, ARNALDUS\r\nVILLANOVANUS or ARNAUD DE VILLENEUVE (c. 1235-1313), alchemist,\r\nastrologer and physician, appears to have been of Spanish origin, and to\r\nhave studied chemistry, medicine, physics, and also Arabian philosophy.\r\nAfter having lived at the court of Aragon, he went to Paris, where he\r\ngained a considerable reputation; but he incurred the enmity of the\r\necclesiastics and was forced to flee, finally finding an asylum in\r\nSicily. About 1313 he was summoned to Avignon by Pope Clement V., who\r\nwas ill, but he died on the voyage. Many alchemical writings, including\r\n_Thesaurus Thesaurorum_ or _Rosarius Philosophorum, Novum Lumen, Flos\r\nFlorum_, and _Speculum Alchimiae_, are ascribed to him, but they are of\r\nvery doubtful authenticity. Collected editions of them were published at\r\nLyons in 1504 and 1532 (with a biography by Symphorianus Campegius), at\r\nBasel in 1585, at Frankfort in 1603, and at Lyons in 1686. He is also\r\nthe reputed author of various medical works, including _Breviarium\r\nPracticae_.\r\n\r\n  See J.B. Haureau in the _Histoire litteraire de la France_ (1881),\r\n  vol. 28; E. Lalande, _Arnaud de Villeneuve, sa vie et ses oeuvres_\r\n  (Paris, 1896). A list of writings is given by J. Ferguson in his\r\n  _Bibliotheca Chemica_ (1906). See also U. Chevalier, _Repertoire des\r\n  sources hist., &c., Bio-bibliographie_ (Paris, 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNAUD, HENRI (1641-1721), pastor and general of the Vaudois or\r\nWaldensians of Piedmont, was born at Embrun. About 1650 his family\r\nreturned to their native valley of Luserna, where Arnaud was educated at\r\nLa Tour (the chief village), later visiting the college at Basel (1662\r\nand 1668) and the Academy at Geneva (1666). He then returned home, and\r\nseems to have been pastor in several of the Vaudois valleys before\r\nattaining that position at La Tour (1685). He was thus the natural\r\nleader of his co-religionists after Victor Amadeus expelled them (1686)\r\nfrom their valleys, and most probably visited Holland, the ruler of\r\nwhich, William of Orange, certainly gave him help and money. Arnaud\r\noccupied himself with organizing his 3000 countrymen who had taken\r\nrefuge in Switzerland, and who twice (1687-1688) attempted to regain\r\ntheir homes. The English revolution of 1688, and the election of William\r\nto the throne, encouraged the Vaudois to make yet another attempt.\r\nFurnished with detailed instructions from the veteran Josue Janavel\r\n(prevented by age from taking part in the expedition) Arnaud, with about\r\n1000 followers, started (August 17, 1689) from near Nyon on the Lake of\r\nGeneva for the _glorieuse rentree_. On the 27th of August, the valiant\r\nband, after many hardships and dangers, reached the Valley of St\r\nMartin, having passed by Sallanches and crossed the Col de Very (6506\r\nft.), the Enclave de la Fenetre (7425 ft.), the Col du Bonhomme (8147\r\nft.), the Col du Mont Iseran (9085 ft.), the Grand Mont Cenis (6893\r\nft.), the Petit Mont Cenis (7166 ft.), the Col de Clapier (8173 ft.),\r\nthe Col de Coteplane (7589 ft.), and the Col du Piz (8550 ft.). They\r\nsoon took refuge in the lofty and secure rocky citadel of the Balsille,\r\nwhere they were besieged (October 24, 1689 to May 14, 1690) by the\r\ntroops (about 4000 in number) of the king of France and the duke of\r\nSavoy. They maintained this natural fortress against many fierce attacks\r\nand during the whole of a winter. In particular, on the 2nd of May, one\r\nassault was defeated without the loss of a single man of Arnaud's small\r\nband. But another attack (May 14) was not so successful, so that Arnaud\r\nwithdrew his force, under cover of a thick mist, and led them over the\r\nhills to the valley of Angrogna, above La Tour. A month later the\r\nVaudois were received into favour by the duke of Savoy, who had then\r\nabandoned his alliance with France for one with Great Britain and\r\nHolland. Hence for the next six years the Vaudois helped Savoy against\r\nFrance, though suffering much from the repeated attacks of the French\r\ntroops. But by a clause in the treaty of peace of 1696, made public in\r\n1698, Victor Amadeus again became hostile to the Vaudois, about 3000 of\r\nwhom, with Arnaud, found a shelter in Protestant countries, mainly in\r\nWurttemberg, where Arnaud became the pastor of Durrmenz-Schonenberg,\r\nN.W. of Stuttgart (1699). Once again (1704-1706) the Vaudois aided the\r\nduke against France. Arnaud, however, took no part in the military\r\noperations, though he visited England (1707) to obtain pecuniary aid\r\nfrom Queen Anne. He died at Schonenberg (which was the church hamlet of\r\nthe parish of Durrmenz) in 1721. It was during his retirement that he\r\ncompiled from various documents by other hands his _Histoire de la\r\nglorieuse rentree des Vaudois dans leurs vallees_, which was published\r\n(probably at Cassel) in 1710, with a dedication to Queen Anne. It was\r\ntranslated into English (1827) by H. Dyke Acland, and has also appeared\r\nin German and Dutch versions. A part of the original MS. is preserved in\r\nthe Royal Library in Berlin.\r\n\r\n  See K.H. Klaiber, _Henri Arnaud, ein Lebensbild_ (Stuttgart, 1880); A.\r\n  de Rochas d'Aiglun, _Les Vallees vaudoises_ (Paris, 1881); various\r\n  chapters in the _Bulletin du bicentenaire de la glorieuse rentree_\r\n  (Turin, 1889).     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNAULD, the surname of a family of prominent French lawyers, chiefly\r\nremembered in connexion with the Jansenist troubles of the 17th century.\r\nAt their head was ANTOINE ARNAULD (1560-1619), a leader of the Paris\r\nbar; in this capacity he delivered a famous philippic against the\r\nJesuits in 1594, accusing them of gross disloyalty to the newly\r\nconverted Henry IV. This speech was afterwards known as the original sin\r\nof the Arnaulds.\r\n\r\nOf his twenty children several grew up to fight the Jesuits on more\r\nimportant matters. Five gave themselves up wholly to the church. HENRI\r\nARNAULD (1597-1692), the second son, became bishop of Angers in 1649,\r\nand represented Jansenism on the episcopal Bench for as long as\r\nforty-three years. The youngest son, ANTOINE (1612-1694), was the most\r\nfamous of Jansenist theologians (see below). The second daughter,\r\nANGELIQUE (1591-1661), was abbess and reformer of Port Royal; here she\r\nwas presently joined by her sister AGNES (1593-1671) and two younger\r\nsisters, both of whom died early.\r\n\r\nOnly two of Antoine's children married--ROBERT ARNAULD D'ANDILLY\r\n(1588-1674), the eldest son, and CATHERINE LEMAISTRE (1590-1651), the\r\neldest daughter. But both of these ended their lives under the shadow of\r\nthe abbey. Andilly's five daughters all took the veil there; the second,\r\nANGELIQUE DE ST JEAN ARNAULD D'ANDILLY (1624-1684) rose to be abbess,\r\nwas a writer of no mean repute, and one of the most remarkable figures\r\nof the second generation of Jansenism. One of Andilly's sons became a\r\nhermit at Port Royal; the eldest, ANTOINE (1615-1699), was first a\r\nsoldier, afterwards a priest. As the Abbe Arnauld, he survives as author\r\nof some interesting _Memoirs_ of his time. The second son, SIMON ARNAULD\r\nDE POMPONNE (1616-1699), early entered public life. After holding\r\nvarious embassies, he rose to be foreign secretary to Louis XIV., and\r\nwas created marquis de Pomponne. Lastly Madame Lemaistre and two of her\r\nsons became identified with Port Royal. On her husband's death she took\r\nthe veil there. Her eldest son, ANTOINE LEMAISTRE (1608-1658), became\r\nthe first of the _solitaires_, or hermits of Port Royal. There he was\r\njoined by his younger brother, ISAAC LEMAISTRE DE SACI (1613-1684), who\r\npresently took holy orders, and became confessor to the hermits.\r\n\r\nThe Arnaulds' connexion with Port Royal (q.v.)--a convent of Cistercian\r\nnuns in the neighbourhood of Versailles--dated back to 1599, when the\r\noriginal Antoine secured the abbess's chair for his daughter Angelique,\r\nthen a child of eight. About 1608 she started to reform her convent in\r\nthe direction of its original Rule; but about 1623 she made the\r\nacquaintance of du Vergier (q.v.) and thenceforward began to move in a\r\nJansenist direction. Her later history is entirely bound up with the\r\nfortunes of that revival. Angelique's strength lay chiefly in her\r\ncharacter. Her sister and collaborator, Agnes, was also a graceful\r\nwriter; and her _Letters_, edited by Prosper Feugere (2 vols., Paris,\r\n1858), throw most valuable light on the inner aims and aspirations of\r\nthe Jansenist movement. The first relative to join their projects of\r\nreform was their nephew, Antoine Lemaistre, who threw up brilliant\r\nprospects at the bar to settle down at the Abbey gates (1638). Here he\r\nwas presently joined by his brother, de Saci, and other hermits, who led\r\nan austere semi-monastic existence, though without taking any formal\r\nvow. In 1646 they were joined by their uncle, Arnauld d'Andilly,\r\nhitherto a personage of some importance at court and in the world; he\r\nwas a special favourite of the queen regent, Anne of Austria, and had\r\nheld various offices of dignity in the government. Uncle and nephews\r\npassed their time partly in ascetic exercises--though Andilly never\r\npretended to vie in austerity with the younger men--partly in managing\r\nthe convent estates, and partly in translating religious classics.\r\nAndilly put Josephus, St Augustine's _Confessions_, and many other\r\nworks, into singularly delicate French. Lemaistre attacked the lives of\r\nthe saints; in 1654 Saci set to work on a translation of the Bible. His\r\nlabours were interrupted by the outbreak of persecution. In 1661 he was\r\nforced to go into hiding; in 1666 he was arrested, thrown into the\r\nBastille, and kept there more than two years. Meanwhile his friends\r\nprinted his translation of the New Testament--really in Holland,\r\nnominally at Mons in the Spanish Netherlands (1667). Hence it is usually\r\nknown as the _Nouveau Testament de Mons_. It found enthusiastic friends\r\nand violent detractors. Bossuet approved its orthodoxy, but not its\r\nover-elaborate style; and it was destructively criticized by Richard\r\nSimon, the founder of Biblical criticism in France. On the other hand it\r\nundoubtedly did much to popularize the Bible, and was bitterly attacked\r\nby the Jesuits on that ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Le grand Arnauld.\r\n\r\nBy far the most distinguished of the family, however, was Antoine--_le\r\ngrand_ Arnauld, as contemporaries called him--the twentieth and youngest\r\nchild of the original Antoine. Born in 1612, he was originally intended\r\nfor the bar; but decided instead to study theology at the Sorbonne. Here\r\nhe was brilliantly successful, and was on the high-road to preferment,\r\nwhen he came under the influence of du Vergier, and was drawn in the\r\ndirection of Jansenism. His book, _De la frequente Communion_ (1643),\r\ndid more than anything else to make the aims and ideals of this movement\r\nintelligible to the general public. Its appearance raised a violent\r\nstorm, and Arnauld eventually withdrew into hiding; for more than twenty\r\nyears he dared not make a public appearance in Paris. During all this\r\ntime his pen was busy with innumerable Jansenist pamphlets. In 1655 two\r\nvery outspoken _Lettres a un duc et pair_ on Jesuit methods in the\r\nconfessional brought on a motion to expel him from the Sorbonne. This\r\nmotion was the immediate cause of Pascal's _Provincial Letters_. Pascal,\r\nhowever, failed to save his friend; in February 1656 Arnauld was\r\nsolemnly degraded. Twelve years later the tide of fortune turned. The\r\nso-called peace of Clement IX. put an end to persecution. Arnauld\r\nemerged from his retirement, was most graciously received by Louis XIV.,\r\nand treated almost as a popular hero. He now set to work with Nicole\r\n(q.v.) on a great work against the Calvinists: _La Perpetuite de la foi\r\ncatholique touchant l'eucharistie_. Ten years later, however, another\r\nstorm of persecution burst. Arnauld was compelled to fly from France,\r\nand take refuge in the Netherlands, finally settling down at Brussels.\r\nHere the last sixteen years of his life were spent in incessant\r\ncontroversy with Jesuits, Calvinists and misbelievers of all kinds; here\r\nhe died on the 8th of August 1694. His inexhaustible energy is best\r\nexpressed by his famous reply to Nicole, who complained of feeling\r\ntired. \"Tired!\" echoed Arnauld, \"when you have all eternity to rest in?\"\r\nNor was this energy by any means absorbed by purely theological\r\nquestions. He was one of the first to adopt the philosophy of Descartes,\r\nthough with certain orthodox reservations; and between 1683 and 1685 he\r\nhad a long battle with Malebranche on the relation of theology to\r\nmetaphysics. On the whole, public opinion leant to Arnauld's side. When\r\nMalebranche complained that his adversary had misunderstood him, Boileau\r\nsilenced him with the question: \"My dear sir, whom do you expect to\r\nunderstand you, if M. Arnauld does not?\" And popular regard for\r\nArnauld's penetration was much increased by his _Art de penser_,\r\ncommonly known as the _Port-Royal Logic_, which has kept its place as an\r\nelementary text-book until quite modern times. Lastly a considerable\r\nplace has quite lately been claimed for Arnauld among the mathematicians\r\nof his age; a recent critic even describes him as the Euclid of the 17th\r\ncentury. In general, however, since his death his reputation has been\r\nsteadily on the wane. Contemporaries admired him chiefly as a master of\r\nclose and serried reasoning; herein Bossuet, the greatest theologian of\r\nthe age, was quite at one with d'Aguesseau, the greatest lawyer. But a\r\npurely controversial writer is seldom attractive to posterity. Anxiety\r\nto drive home every possible point, and cut his adversary off from every\r\npossible line of retreat, makes him seem intolerably prolix. \"In spite\r\nof myself,\" Arnauld once said regretfully, \"my books are seldom very\r\nshort.\" And even lucidity may prove a snare to those who trust to it\r\nalone, and scornfully refuse to appeal to the imagination or the\r\nfeelings. It is to be feared that, but for his connexion with Pascal,\r\nArnauld's name would be almost forgotten--or, at most, live only in the\r\nfamous epitaph Boileau consecrated to his memory--\r\n\r\n  \"Au pied de cet autel de structure grossiere\r\n   Git sans pompe, enferme dans une vile biere\r\n   Le plus savant mortel qui jamais ait ecrit.\"\r\n\r\n  Full details as to the lives and writings of the Arnaulds will be\r\n  found in the various books mentioned at the close of the article on\r\n  Port Royal. The most interesting account of Angelique will be found in\r\n  _Memoires pour servir a l'histoire de Port-Royal_ (3 vols., Utrecht\r\n  1742). Three volumes of her correspondence were also published at the\r\n  same time and place. There are excellent modern lives of her in\r\n  English by Miss Frances Martin (_Angelique Arnauld_, 1873) and by A.\r\n  K. H. (_Angelique of Port Royal_, 1905). Antoine Arnauld's complete\r\n  works--thirty-seven volumes in forty-two parts--were published in\r\n  Paris, 1775-1781. No modern biography of him exists; but there is a\r\n  study of his philosophy in Bouillier, _Histoire de la philosophie\r\n  cartesienne_ (Paris, 1868); and his mathematical achievements are\r\n  discussed by Dr Bopp in the 14th volume of the _Abhandlungen zur\r\n  Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften_ (Leipzig, 1902). The\r\n  memoirs of Arnauld d'Andilly and of his son, the abbe Arnauld, are\r\n  reprinted both in Petitot's and Poujoulat's collections of memoirs\r\n  illustrative of the 17th century.     (St. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNAULT, ANTOINE VINCENT (1766-1834), French dramatist, was born in\r\nParis in January 1766. His first play, _Marius a Minturnes_ (1791),\r\nimmediately established his reputation. A year later he followed up his\r\nfirst success with a second republican tragedy, _Lucrece_. He left\r\nFrance during the Terror and on his return was arrested by the\r\nrevolutionary authorities, but was liberated through the intervention of\r\nFabre d'Eglantine and others. He was commissioned by Bonaparte in 1797\r\nwith the reorganization of the Ionian Islands, and was nominated to the\r\nInstitute and made secretary general of the university. He was faithful\r\nto his patron through his misfortunes, and after the Hundred Days\r\nremained in exile until 1819. In 1829 he was re-elected to the Academy\r\nand became perpetual secretary in 1833. Others of his plays are _Blanche\r\net Montcassin, ou les Venitiens_ (1798); and _Germanicus_ (1816), the\r\nperformance of which was the occasion of a disturbance in the _parterre_\r\nwhich threatened serious political complications. His tragedies are\r\nperhaps less known now than his _Fables_ (1813, 1815 and 1826), which\r\nare written in very graceful verse. Arnault collaborated in a _Vie\r\npolitique et militaire de Napoleon_ (1822), and wrote some very\r\ninteresting _Souvenirs d'un sexagenaire_ (1833), which contain much\r\nout-of-the-way information about the history of the years previous to\r\n1804. Arnault died at Goderville on the 16th of September 1834.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, Emilien Lucien (1787-1863), wrote several tragedies, the\r\nleading roles in which were interpreted by Talma.\r\n\r\n  See Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, vol. 7. Arnault's _Oeuvres\r\n  completes_ (4 vols.) were published at the Hague and Paris in\r\n  1818-1819 and again (8 vols.) at Paris in 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNDT, ERNST MORITZ (1769-1860), German poet and patriot, was born on\r\nthe 26th of December 1769 at Schoritz in the island of Rugen, which at\r\nthat time belonged to Sweden. He was the son of a prosperous farmer, and\r\nemancipated serf of the lord of the district, Count Putbus; his mother\r\ncame of well-to-do German yeoman stock. In 1787 the family removed into\r\nthe neighbourhood of Stralsund, where Arndt was enabled to attend the\r\nacademy. After an interval of private study he went in 1791 to the\r\nuniversity of Greifswald as a student of theology and history, and in\r\n1793 removed to Jena, where he fell under the influence of Fichte. On\r\nthe completion of his university course he returned home, was for two\r\nyears a private tutor in the family of Ludwig Kosegarten (1758-1818),\r\npastor of Wittow and poet, and having qualified for the ministry as a\r\n\"candidate of theology,\" assisted in the church services. At the age of\r\ntwenty-eight he renounced the ministry, and for eighteen months he led a\r\nwandering life, visiting Austria, Hungary, Italy, France and Belgium.\r\nReturning homewards up the Rhine, he was moved by the sight of the\r\nruined castles along its banks to intense bitterness against France. The\r\nimpressions of this journey he later described in _Reisen durch einen\r\nTheil Teutschlands, Ungarns, Italiens und Frankreichs in den Jahren 1798\r\nund 1799_ (1802-1804). In 1800 he settled in Greifswald as\r\n_privat-docent_ in history, and the same year published _Uber die\r\nFreiheit der alien Republiken_. In 1803 appeared _Germanien und\r\nEuropa_,\" a fragmentary ebullition,\" as be himself called it, of his\r\nviews on the French aggression. This was followed by one of the most\r\nremarkable of his books, _Versuch einer Geschichte der Leibeigenschaft\r\nin Pommern und Rugen_ (Berlin, 1803), a history of serfdom in Pomerania\r\nand Rugen, which was so convincing an indictment that King Gustavus\r\nAdolphus IV. in 1806 abolished the evil. Arndt had meanwhile risen from\r\n_privat-docent_ to extraordinary professor, and in 1806 was appointed to\r\nthe chair of history at the university. In this year he published the\r\nfirst part of his _Geist der Zeit_, in which he flung down the gauntlet\r\nto Napoleon and called on his countrymen to rise and shake off the\r\nFrench yoke. So great was the excitement it produced that Arndt was\r\ncompelled to take refuge in Sweden to escape the vengeance of Napoleon.\r\nSettling in Stockholm, he obtained government employment, but devoted\r\nhimself to the great cause which was nearest his heart, and in\r\npamphlets, poems and songs communicated his enthusiasm to his\r\ncountrymen. Schill's heroic death at Stralsund impelled him to return to\r\nGermany and, under the disguise of \"Almann, teacher of languages,\" he\r\nreached Berlin in December 1809. In 1810 he returned to Greifswald, but\r\nonly for a few months. He again set out on his adventurous travels,\r\nlived in close contact with the first men of his time, such as Blucher,\r\nGneisenau and Stein, and in 1812 was summoned by the last named to St\r\nPetersburg to assist in the organization of the final struggle against\r\nFrance. Meanwhile, pamphlet after pamphlet, full of bitter hatred of the\r\nFrench oppressor, came from his pen, and his stirring patriotic songs,\r\nsuch as _Was ist das deutsche Vaterland? Der Gott, der Eisen wachsen\r\nliess_, and _Was blasen die Trompeten?_ were on all lips. When, after\r\nthe peace, the university of Bonn was founded in 1818, Arndt was\r\nappointed to the chair of modern history. In this year appeared the\r\nfourth part of his _Geist der Zeit_, in which he criticized the\r\nreactionary policy of the German powers. The boldness of his demands for\r\nreform offended the Prussian government, and in the summer of 1819 he\r\nwas arrested and his papers confiscated. Although speedily liberated, he\r\nwas in the following year, at the instance of the Central Commission of\r\nInvestigation at Mainz, established in accordance with the Carlsbad\r\nDecrees, arraigned before a specially constituted tribunal. Although not\r\nfound guilty, he was forbidden to exercise the functions of his\r\nprofessorship, but was allowed to retain the stipend. The next twenty\r\nyears he passed in retirement and literary activity. In 1840 he was\r\nreinstated in his professorship, and in 1841 was chosen rector of the\r\nuniversity. The revolutionary outbreak of 1848 rekindled in the\r\nvenerable patriot his old hopes and energies, and he took his seat as\r\none of the deputies to the National Assembly at Frankfort. He formed one\r\nof the deputation that offered the imperial crown to Frederick William\r\nIV., and indignant at the king's refusal to accept it, he retired with\r\nthe majority of von Gagern's adherents from public life. He continued to\r\nlecture and to write with freshness and vigour, and on his 90th birthday\r\nreceived from all parts of Germany good wishes and tokens of affection.\r\nHe died at Bonn on the 29th of January 1860. Arndt was twice married,\r\nfirst in 1800, his wife dying in the following year; a second time in\r\n1817.\r\n\r\n  Arndt's untiring labour for his country rightly won for him the title\r\n  of \"the most German of all Germans.\" His lyric poems are not, however,\r\n  all confined to politics. Many among the Gedichte (1803-1818; complete\r\n  edition, 1860) are religious pieces of great beauty. Among his other\r\n  works are _Reise durch Schweden_ (1797); _Nebenstunden, eine\r\n  Beschreibung und Geschichte der schottlandischen Inseln und der\r\n  Orkaden_ (1820); _Die Frage uber die Niederlande_ (1831);\r\n  _Erinnerungen aus dem ausseren Leben_ (an autobiography, and the most\r\n  valuable source of information for Arndt's life, 1840); _Rhein- und\r\n  Ahrwanderungen_ (1846), _Wanderungen und Wandlungen mit dem\r\n  Reichsfreiherrn von Stein_ (1858), and _Pro populo Germanico_ (1854),\r\n  which was originally intended to form the fifth part of the _Geist der\r\n  Zeit_. Arndt's _Werke_ have been edited by H. Rosch and H. Meisner in\r\n  8 vols. (not complete) (1892-1898). Biographies have been written by\r\n  E. Langenberg (1869) and Wilhelm Baur (5th ed., 1882); see also H.\r\n  Meisner and R. Geerds, _E.M. Arndt, ein Lebensbild in Briefen_ (1898),\r\n  and R. Thiele, _E.M. Arndt_ (1894). There are monuments to his memory\r\n  at Schoritz, his birthplace, and at Bonn, where he is buried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNDT, JOHANN (1555-1621), German Lutheran theologian, was born at\r\nBallenstedt, in Anhalt, and studied in several universities. He was at\r\nHelmstadt in 1576; at Wittenberg in 1577. At Wittenberg the\r\ncrypto-Calvinist controversy was then at its height, and he took the\r\nside of Melanchthon and the crypto-Calvinists. He continued his studies\r\nin Strassburg, under the professor of Hebrew, Johannes Pappus\r\n(1549-1610), a zealous Lutheran, the crown of whose life's work was the\r\nforcible suppression of Calvinistic preaching and worship in the city,\r\nand who had great influence over him. In Basel, again, he studied\r\ntheology under Simon Sulzer (1508-1585), a broad-minded divine of\r\nLutheran sympathies, whose aim was to reconcile the churches of the\r\nHelvetic and Wittenberg confessions. In 1581 he went back to\r\nBallenstedt, but was soon recalled to active life by his appointment to\r\nthe pastorate at Badeborn in 1583. After some time his Lutheran\r\ntendencies exposed him to the anger of the authorities, who were of the\r\nReformed Church. Consequently, in 1590 he was deposed for refusing to\r\nremove the pictures from his church and discontinue the use of exorcism\r\nin baptism. He found an asylum in Quedlinburg (1590), and afterwards was\r\ntransferred to St Martin's church at Brunswick (1599). Arndt's fame\r\nrests on his writings. These were mainly of a mystical and devotional\r\nkind, and were inspired by St Bernard, J. Tauler and Thomas a Kempis.\r\nHis principal work, _Wahres Christentum_ (1606-1609), which has been\r\ntranslated into most European languages, has served as the foundation of\r\nmany books of devotion, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. Arndt here\r\ndwells upon the mystical union between the believer and Christ, and\r\nendeavours, by drawing attention to Christ's life _in_ His people, to\r\ncorrect the purely forensic side of the Reformation theology, which paid\r\nalmost exclusive attention to Christ's death _for_ His people. Like\r\nLuther, Arndt was very fond of the little anonymous book, _Deutsche\r\nTheologie_. He published an edition of it and called attention to its\r\nmerits in a special preface. After _Wahres Christentum_, his best-known\r\nwork is _Paradiesgartlein aller christlichen Tugenden_, which was\r\npublished in 1612. Both these books have been translated into English;\r\n_Paradiesgartlein_ with the title the _Garden of Paradise_. Several of\r\nhis sermons are published in R. Nesselmann's _Buch der Predigten_\r\n(1858). Arndt has always been held in very high repute by the German\r\nPietists. The founder of Pietism, Philipp Jacob Spener, repeatedly\r\ncalled attention to him and his writings, and even went so far as to\r\ncompare him with Plato (cf. Karl Scheele, _Plato und Johann Arndt, Ein\r\nVortrag, &c._, 1857).\r\n\r\n  A collected edition of his works was published in Leipzig and Gorlitz\r\n  in 1734. A valuable account of Arndt is to be found in C. Aschmann's\r\n  _Essai sur la vie, &c., de J. Arndt_. See further, Herzog-Hauck,\r\n  _Realencyklopadie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNE, THOMAS AUGUSTINE (1710-1778), English musical composer, was born\r\nin London on the 12th of March 1710, his father being an upholsterer.\r\nIntended for the legal profession, he was educated at Eton, and\r\nafterwards apprenticed to an attorney for three years. His natural\r\ninclination for music, however, proved irresistible, and his father,\r\nfinding from his performance at an amateur musical party that he was\r\nalready a skilful violinist, furnished him with the means of educating\r\nhimself in his favourite art. On the 7th of March 1733 he produced his\r\nfirst work at Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre, a setting of Addison's\r\n_Rosamond_, the heroine's part being performed by his sister, Susanna\r\nMaria, who afterwards became celebrated as Mrs Gibber. This proving a\r\nsuccess was immediately followed by a burletta, entitled _The Opera of\r\nOperas_, based on Fielding's _Tragedy of Tragedies_. The part of Tom\r\nThumb was played by Arne's young brother, and the opera was produced at\r\nthe Haymarket theatre. On the 19th of December 1733 Arne produced at the\r\nsame theatre the masque _Dido and Aeneas_, a subject of which the\r\nmusical conception had been immortalized for Englishmen more than half a\r\ncentury earlier by Henry Purcell. Arne's individuality of style first\r\ndistinctly asserted itself in the music to Dr Dalton's adaptation of\r\nMilton's _Comus_, which was performed at Drury Lane in 1738, and\r\nspeedily established his reputation. In 1740 he wrote the music for\r\nThomson and Mallet's _Masque of Alfred_, which is noteworthy as\r\ncontaining the most popular of all his airs--\"Rule, Britannia!\" In 1740\r\nhe also wrote his beautiful settings of the songs, \"Under the greenwood\r\ntree,\" \"Blow, blow, thou winter wind\" and \"When daisies pied,\" for a\r\nperformance of Shakespeare's _As You Like It_. Four years before this,\r\nin 1736, he had married Cecilia, the eldest daughter of Charles Young,\r\norganist of All Hallows Barking. She was considered the finest English\r\nsinger of the day and was frequently engaged by Handel in the\r\nperformance of his music. In 1742 Arne went with his wife to Dublin,\r\nwhere he remained two years and produced his oratorio _Abel_, containing\r\nthe beautiful melody known as the Hymn of Eve, the operas _Britannia,\r\nEliza_ and _Comus_, and where he also gave a number of successful\r\nconcerts. On his return to London he was engaged as leader of the band\r\nat Drury Lane theatre (1744), and as composer at Vauxhall (1745). In\r\nthis latter year he composed his successful pastoral dialogue, _Colin\r\nand Phoebe_, and in 1746 the song, \"Where the bee sucks.\" In 1759 he\r\nreceived the degree of doctor of music from Oxford. In 1760 he\r\ntransferred his services to Covent Garden theatre, where on the 28th of\r\nNovember he produced his _Thomas and Sally_. Here, too, on the 2nd of\r\nFebruary 1762 he produced his _Artaxerxes_, an opera in the Italian\r\nstyle with recitative instead of spoken dialogue, the popularity of\r\nwhich is attested by the fact that it continued to be performed at\r\nintervals for upwards of eighty years. The libretto, by Arne himself,\r\nwas a very poor translation of Metastasio's _Artaserse_. In 1762 also\r\nwas produced the ballad-opera _Love in a Cottage_. His oratorio\r\n_Judith_, of which the first performance was on the 27th of February\r\n1761 at Drury Lane, was revived at the chapel of the Lock hospital,\r\nPimlico, on the 29th of February 1764, in which year was also performed\r\nhis setting of Metastasio's _Olimpiade_ in the original language at the\r\nKing's theatre in the Haymarket. At a later performance of _Judith_ at\r\nCovent Garden theatre on the 26th of February 1773 Arne for the first\r\ntime introduced female voices into oratorio choruses. In 1769 he wrote\r\nthe musical parts for Garrick's ode for the Shakespeare jubilee at\r\nStratford-on-Avon, and in 1770 he gave a mutilated version of Purcell's\r\n_King Arthur_. One of his last dramatic works was the music to Mason's\r\n_Caractacus_, published in 1775. Though inferior to Purcell in intensity\r\nof feeling, Arne has not been surpassed as a composer of graceful and\r\nattractive melody. There is true genius in such airs as \"Rule,\r\nBritannia!\" and \"Where the bee sucks,\" which still retain their original\r\nfreshness and popularity. As a writer of glees he does not take such\r\nhigh rank, though he deserves notice as the leader in the revival of\r\nthat peculiarly English form of composition. He was author as well as\r\ncomposer of _The Guardian outwitted_, _The Rose_, _The Contest of Beauty\r\nand Virtue_, and _Phoebe at Court_. Dr Arne died on the 5th of March\r\n1778, and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden.\r\n\r\n  See also the article in _Grove's Dictionary_ (new ed.); and two\r\n  interesting papers in the _Musical Times_, November and December 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNETH, ALFRED, RITTER VON (1819-1897), Austrian historian, born at\r\nVienna on the both of July 1819, was the son of Joseph Calasanza von\r\nArneth (1791-1863), a well-known historian and archaeologist, who wrote\r\na history of the Austrian empire (Vienna, 1827) and several works on\r\nnumismatics. Alfred Arneth studied law, and became an official of the\r\nAustrian state archives, of which in 1868 he was appointed keeper. He\r\nwas a moderate liberal in politics and a supporter of the ideal of\r\nGerman unity. As such he was elected to the Frankfort parliament in\r\n1848. In 1861 he became a member of the Lower Austrian diet and in 1869\r\nwas nominated to the Upper House of the Austrian Reichsrath. In 1879 he\r\nwas appointed president of the _Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften_\r\n(Academy of Sciences) at Vienna, and in 1896 succeeded von Sybel as\r\nchairman of the historical commission at Munich. He died on the 30th of\r\nJuly 1897.\r\n\r\nArneth was an indefatigable worker, and, as director of the archives,\r\nhis broad-minded willingness to listen to the advice of experts, as well\r\nas his own sound sense, did much to promote the more scientific\r\ntreatment and use of public records in most of the archives of Europe.\r\nHis scientific temper and the special facilities which he enjoyed for\r\ndrawing from original sources give to his numerous historical works a\r\nvery special value.\r\n\r\n  Among his publications may be mentioned: _Leben des Feld-marschalls\r\n  Grafen Guido Starhemberg_ (Vienna, 1863); _Prinz Eueen von Savoyen_ (3\r\n  vols., _ib_. 1864); _Gesch. der Maria Theresa_ (10 vols., _ib_.\r\n  1863-1879); _Maria Theresa u. Marie Antoinette, ihr Briefwechsel_\r\n  (_ib_. 1866); _Marie Antoinette, Joseph II. und Leopold II., ihr\r\n  Briefwechsel_ (1866); _Maria Theresa und Joseph II., ihre\r\n  Korrespondenz samt Briefen Josephs an seinen Bruder Leopold_ (3 vols.,\r\n  1867); _Beaumarchais und Sonnenfels_ (1868); _Joseph II. und Katharina\r\n  von Russland, ihr Briefwechsel_ (1869); _Johann Christian Barthenstein\r\n  und seine Zeit_ (1871); _Joseph II. und Leopold von Toskana, ihr\r\n  Briefwechsel_ (2 vols., 1872); _Briefe der Kaiserin Maria Theresa an\r\n  ihre Kinder und Freunde_ (4 vols., 1881); _Marie Antoinette:\r\n  Correspondance secrete entre Marie-Therese et le comte de\r\n  Mercy-Argenteau_ (3 vols., Paris, 1875), in collaboration with Auguste\r\n  Geffroy; _Graf Philipp Cobenzl und seine Memoiren_ (1885);\r\n  _Correspondance secrete du comte de Mercy-Argenteau avec l'empereur\r\n  Joseph II. et Kaunitz_ (2 vols., 1889-1891), in collaboration with\r\n  Jules Flammermont; _Anton Ritter von Schmerling. Episoden aus seinem\r\n  Leben 1835, 1848-1849_ (1895); _Johann Freiherr von Wessenberg, ein\r\n  osterreichischer Staatsmann des 19. Jahrh._ (2 vols., 1898). Arneth\r\n  also published in 1893 two volumes of early reminiscences under the\r\n  title of _Aus meinem Leben_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNHEM, or ARNHEIM, the capital of the province of Gelderland, Holland,\r\non the right bank of the Rhine (here crossed by a pontoon bridge), and a\r\njunction station 35 m. by rail E.S.E. of Utrecht. Pop. (1900) 57,240. It\r\nis connected by tramway with Zutphen and Utrecht, and there is a regular\r\nservice of steamers to Cologne, Amsterdam, Nijmwegen, Tiel, 's\r\nHertogenbosch and Rotterdam. Arnhem is a gay and fashionable town\r\nprettily situated at the foot of the Veluwe hills, and enjoys a special\r\nreputation for beauty on account of its wooded and hilly surroundings,\r\nwhich have attracted many wealthy people to its neighbourhood. The\r\nGroote Kerk of St Eusebius, built in the third quarter of the 15th\r\ncentury, contains the marble monument to Charles (d. 1538), the last\r\nduke of Gelderland of the Egmont dynasty. High up against the wall is an\r\neffigy of the same duke in his armour. The fine lofty tower contains a\r\nchime of forty-five bells. The Roman Catholic church of St Walburgis is\r\nof earlier date, and a new Roman Catholic church dates from 1894. The\r\ntown hall was built as a palace by Maarten van Rossum, Duke Charles's\r\ngeneral, at the end of the 15th century, and was only converted to its\r\npresent use in 1830. Its grotesque external ornamentation earned for it\r\nthe name of Duivelshuis, or devil's house. The provincial government\r\nhouse occupies the site of the former palace of the dukes of Gelderland.\r\nOther buildings are the court-house, a public library containing many\r\nold works, a theatre, a large concert-hall, a museum of antiquities (as\r\nwell as a separate collection of Spanish antiquities), a gymnasium, a\r\nteachers' and art school, a building (1880) to contain the provincial\r\narchives, a hospital (1889) and barracks. On account of its proximity to\r\nthe fertile Betuwe district and its situation near the confluence of the\r\nRhine and Ysel, the markets and shipping of Arnhem are in a flourishing\r\ncondition. A wharf for building and repairing iron steamers was\r\nconstructed in 1889. The manufactures include woollen and cotton goods,\r\npaper, earthenware, soap, carriages, furniture and tobacco, which is\r\ncultivated in the neighbourhood. Wool-combing and dyeing are also\r\ncarried on, and there are oil and timber mills.\r\n\r\nThe environs of Arnhem are much admired. Following either the Zutphen or\r\nthe Utrecht road, numerous pleasing views of the Rhine valley present\r\nthemselves, and country houses and villas appear among the woods on\r\nevery side. At Bronbeek, a short distance east of the town, is a\r\nhospital endowed by King William III. for soldiers of the colonial army.\r\nBeyond is the popular summer resort of Velp, with the castle of Biljoen\r\nbuilt by Charles, duke of Gelderland, in 1530, and the beautiful park of\r\nthe ancient castle of Rozendaal in the vicinity. The origin of the\r\ncastle of Rozendaal is unknown. The first account of it is in connexion\r\nwith a tournament given there by Reinald I., count of Gelderland, in the\r\nbeginning of the 14th century, and it ever after remained the favourite\r\nresidence of the counts and dukes of Gelderland. About the beginning of\r\nthe 18th century fountains and lanes in the style of those at Versailles\r\nwere laid out in the park, and soon after the castle itself, of which\r\nonly the round tower remained (and is still standing), was rebuilt. The\r\npark is open to the public, and is famous for the beauty of the beech\r\navenues and fir woods. Beyond this is De Steeg, another popular resort,\r\nwhence stretches the famous Middachten Allee of beech trees to Dieren.\r\nOn the Apeldoorn road is Sonsbeek, with a wooded park and small lakes,\r\nformerly a private seat and now belonging to the municipality. On the\r\nwest of Arnhem is another pleasure ground, called the Reeberg, with a\r\ncasino, and the woods of Heienoord. Close by is the ancient and\r\nwell-preserved castle of Doornwerth with its own chapel. It was the seat\r\nof an independent lordship until 1402, after which time it was held in\r\nfief from the dukes of Gelderland. Beyond Doornwerth, at Renkum, is the\r\nroyal country seat called Oranje-Nassau's Oord, which was bought by the\r\ncrown in 1881.\r\n\r\n_History._--Arnhem, called _Arnoldi Villa_ in the middle ages, is,\r\naccording to some, the _Arenacum_ of the Romans, and is first mentioned\r\nin a document in 893. In 1233 Otto II., count of Gelderland, chose this\r\nspot as his residence, conferred municipal rights on the town, and\r\nfortified it. At a later period it entered the Hanseatic League. In 1473\r\nit was captured by Charles the Bold of Burgundy. In 1505 it received the\r\nright of coining from Philip, son of the emperor Maximilian I. In 1514\r\nCharles of Egmont, duke of Gelderland, took it from the Spaniards; but\r\nin 1543 it fell to the emperor Charles V., who made it the seat of the\r\ncouncil of Gelderland. It joined the union of Utrecht in 1579, and came\r\nfinally under the effective government of the states-general in 1585,\r\nall the later attacks of the Spaniards being repulsed. In 1586 Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney died in the town from the effects of his wound received\r\nbefore Zutphen. The French took the town in 1672, but left it dismantled\r\nin 1674. It was refortified by the celebrated Dutch general of\r\nengineers, Coehoorn, in the beginning of the 18th century. In 1795 it\r\nwas again stormed by the French, and in 1813 it was taken from them by\r\nthe Prussians under Bullow. Gardens and promenades have now taken the\r\nplace of the old ramparts, the last of which was levelled in 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNICA, a genus of plants belonging to the natural order Compositae, and\r\ncontaining 18 species, mostly north-west American. The most important\r\nspecies is _Arnicamontana_ (mountain tobacco), a perennial herb found in\r\nupland meadows in northern and central Europe (but not extending to\r\nBritain), and on the mountains of western and central Europe. A closely\r\nallied species (_A. angustifolia_), with very narrow leaves, is met with\r\nin Arctic Asia and America. The heads of flowers are large, 2 to 2-1/2\r\nin. across, orange-yellow in colour, and borne on the summit of the stem\r\nor branches; the outer ray-flowers are an inch in length. The achenes\r\n(fruits) are brown and hairy, and are crowned by a tuft of stiffish\r\nhairs (pappus). The root-stock of _A. montana_ is tough, slender, of a\r\ndark brown colour and an inch or two in length. It gives off numerous\r\nsimple roots from its under side, and shows on its upper side the\r\nremains of rosettes of leaves. It yields an essential oil in small\r\nquantity, and a resinous matter called arnicin, C12H22O2, a yellow\r\ncrystalline substance with an acrid taste. The tincture prepared from it\r\nis an old remedy which has a popular reputation in the treatment of\r\nbruises and sprains. The plant was introduced into English gardens about\r\nthe middle of the 18th century, but is not often grown; it is a handsome\r\nplant for a rockery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNIM, ELISABETH (BETTINA) VON (1785-1859), German authoress, sister of\r\nKlemens Brentano, was born at Frankfort-On-Main on the 4th of April\r\n1785. After being educated at a convent school in Fritzlar, she lived\r\nfor a while with her grandmother, the novelist, Sophie Laroche\r\n(1731-1807), at Offenbach, and from 1803 to 1806 with her\r\nbrother-in-law, Friedrich von Savigny, the famous jurist, at Marburg. In\r\n1807 she made at Weimar the acquaintance of Goethe, for whom she\r\nentertained a violent passion, which the poet, although entering into\r\ncorrespondence with her, did not requite, but only regarded as a\r\nharmless fancy. Their friendship came to an abrupt end in 1811, owing to\r\n\"Bettina's\" insolent behaviour to Goethe's wife. In this year she\r\nmarried Ludwig Achim von Arnim (q.v.), by whom she had seven children.\r\nAfter her husband's death in 1831, her passion for Goethe revived, and\r\nin 1835 she published her remarkable book, _Goethes Briefwechsel mit\r\neinem Kinde_, which purported to be a correspondence between herself and\r\nthe poet. Regarded at first as genuine, it was afterwards for many years\r\nlooked upon as wholly fictitious, until the publication in 1879 of G.\r\nvon Loeper's _Briefe Goethes an Sophie Laroche und Bettina Brentano,\r\nnebst dichterischen Beilagen_, which proved it to be based on authentic\r\nmaterial, though treated with the greatest poetical licence. Equally\r\nfantastic is her correspondence _Die Gunderode_ (1840), with her unhappy\r\nfriend, the poet, Karoline von Gunderode (1780-1806), who committed\r\nsuicide, and that with her brother Klemens Brentano, under the title\r\n_Klemens Brentanos Fruhlingskranz_ (1844). She also published _Dies Buck\r\ngehort dem Konig_ (1843), in which she advocated the emancipation of the\r\nJews, and the abolition of capital punishment. Among her other works may\r\nbe mentioned _Ilius Pamphilius und die Ambrosia_ (1848), also a\r\nsupposititious correspondence. In all her writings she showed real\r\npoetical genius, combined with evidence of an unbalanced mind and a\r\nmannerism which becomes tiresome. She died at Berlin on the 20th of\r\nJanuary 1859. Part of a design by her for a colossal statue of Goethe,\r\nexecuted in marble by the sculptor Karl Steinhauser (1813-1878), is in\r\nthe museum at Weimar.\r\n\r\n  Her collected works (_Samtliche Schriften_) were published in Berlin\r\n  in 11 vols., 1853. Goethe's _Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde_ has been\r\n  edited by H. Grimm (4th ed., Berlin, 1890). See also C. Alberti, _B.\r\n  von Arnim_ (Leipzig, 1885); Moritz Carriere, _Bettina von Arnim_\r\n  (Breslau, 1887), and the literature cited under Ludwig von Arnim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNIM, HARRY KARL KURT EDUARD VON, COUNT (1824-1881), German\r\ndiplomatist, was a member of one of the most numerous and most widely\r\nspread families of the Prussian nobility. He was born in Pomerania on\r\nthe 3rd of October 1824, and brought up by his uncle Heinrich von Arnim,\r\nwho was Prussian ambassador at Paris and foreign minister from March to\r\nJune 1848, while Count Arnim-Boytzenburg, whose daughter Harry von Arnim\r\nafterwards married, was minister-president. It is noticeable that the\r\nuncle was brought before a court of justice and fined for publishing a\r\npamphlet directed against the ministry of Manteuffel. After holding\r\nother posts in the diplomatic service Arnim was in 1864 appointed\r\nPrussian envoy (and in 1867 envoy of the North German Confederation) at\r\nthe papal court. In 1869 he proposed that the governments should appoint\r\nrepresentatives to be present at the Vatican council, a suggestion which\r\nwas rejected by Bismarck, and foretold that the promulgation of papal\r\ninfallibility would bring serious political difficulties. After the\r\nrecall of the French troops from Rome he attempted unsuccessfully to\r\nmediate between the pope and the Italian government. He was appointed in\r\n1871 German commissioner to arrange the final treaty with France, a task\r\nwhich he carried out with such success that in 1871 he was appointed\r\nGerman envoy at Paris, and in 1872 received his definite appointment as\r\nambassador, a post of the greatest difficulty and responsibility.\r\nDifferences soon arose between him and Bismarck; he wished to support\r\nthe monarchical party which was trying to overthrow Thiers, while\r\nBismarck ordered him to stand aloof from all French parties; he did not\r\ngive that implicit obedience to his instructions which Bismarck\r\nrequired. Bismarck, however, was unable to recall him because of the\r\ngreat influence which he enjoyed at court and the confidence which the\r\nemperor placed in him. He was looked upon by the Conservative party, who\r\nwere trying to overthrow Bismarck, as his successor, and it is said that\r\nhe was closely connected with the court intrigues against the\r\nchancellor. In the beginning of 1874 he was recalled and appointed to\r\nthe embassy at Constantinople, but this appointment was immediately\r\nrevoked. A Vienna newspaper published some correspondence on the Vatican\r\ncouncil, including confidential despatches of Arnim's, with the object\r\nof showing that he had shown greater foresight than Bismarck. It was\r\nthen found that a considerable number of papers were missing from the\r\nParis embassy, and on the 4th of October Arnim was arrested on the\r\ncharge of embezzling state papers. This recourse to the criminal law\r\nagainst a man of his rank, who had held one of the most important\r\ndiplomatic posts, caused great astonishment. His defence was that the\r\npapers were not official, and he was acquitted on the charge of\r\nembezzlement, but convicted of undue delay in restoring official papers\r\nand condemned to three months' imprisonment. On appeal the sentence was\r\nincreased to nine months. Arnim avoided imprisonment by leaving the\r\ncountry, and in 1875 published anonymously at Zurich a pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Pro nihilo,\" in which he attempted to show that the attack on him was\r\ncaused by Bismarck's personal jealousy. For this he was accused of\r\ntreason, insult to the emperor, and libelling Bismarck, and in his\r\nabsence condemned to five years' penal servitude. From his exile in\r\nAustria he published two more pamphlets on the ecclesiastical policy of\r\nPrussia, \"Der Nunzius kommt!\" (Vienna, 1878), and \"Quid faciamus nos?\"\r\n(_ib._ 1879). He made repeated attempts, which were supported by his\r\nfamily, to be allowed to return to Germany in order to take his trial\r\nafresh on the charge of treason; his request had just been granted when\r\nhe died on the 19th of May 1881.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Bismarck carried an amendment to the criminal code making it an\r\noffence punishable with imprisonment or a fine up to L250 for an\r\nofficial of the foreign office to communicate to others official\r\ndocuments, or for an envoy to act contrary to his instructions. These\r\nclauses are commonly spoken of in Germany as the \"Arnim paragraphs.\"\r\n     (J. W. He.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNIM, LUDWIG ACHIM (JOACHIM) VON (1781-1831), German poet and novelist,\r\nwas born at Berlin on the 26th of January 1781. He studied natural\r\nscience at Halle and Gottingen, and published one or two essays on\r\nscientific subjects; but his bent was from the first towards literature.\r\nFrom the earlier writings of Goethe and Herder he learned to appreciate\r\nthe beauties of German traditional legends and folk-songs; and, forming\r\na collection of these, published the result (1806-1808), in\r\ncollaboration with Klemens Brentano (q.v.) under the title _Des Knaben\r\nWunderhorn._ From 1810 onward he lived with his wife Bettina, Brentano's\r\nsister, alternately at Berlin and on his estate at Wiepersdorf, near\r\nDahme in Brandenburg, where he died on the 21st of January 1831. Arnim\r\nwas a prolific and versatile writer, gifted with a sense of humour and a\r\nrefined imagination--qualities shown in the best-known of his works,\r\n_Des Knaben Wunderhorn_, deficient as this is in the philological\r\naccuracy and faithfulness to original sources which would now be\r\nexpected of such a compilation. In general, however, his writings, full\r\nas they are of the exaggerated sentiment and affectations of the\r\nromantic school, make but little appeal to modern taste. There are\r\npossible exceptions, such as the short stories _Furst Ganzgott und\r\nSanger Halbgott_ and _Der tolle Invalide auf dem Fort Ratonneau_ and the\r\nunfinished romance _Die Kronenwachter_ (1817), which promised to develop\r\ninto one of the finest historical romances of the 19th century. Among\r\nArnim's other works may be mentioned _Hollins Liebesleben_ (1802), _Der\r\nWintergarten_ (1809), a collection of tales; _Armut, Reichtum Schuld,\r\nund Busse der Grafin Dolores_ (1810), a novel; _Halle und Jerusalem_\r\n(1811), a dramatic romance; and one or two smaller novels, such as\r\n_Isabella von Agypten_ (1812).\r\n\r\n  Arnim's _Samtliche Werke_ were edited by his widow and published in\r\n  Berlin in 1839-1840; second edition in 22 vols., 1853-1856. Selections\r\n  have been edited by J. Dohmke (1892); M.

Steig, _Achim von Arnim\r\n  und Klemens Brentano_ (1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNIM-BOYTZENBURG, HANS GEORG VON (1581-1641), German general and\r\ndiplomatist, was born in 1581 at Boytzenburg in Brandenburg. From 1613\r\nto 1617 he served in the Swedish army under Gustavus Adolphus, took part\r\nin the Russian War, and afterwards fought against the Turks in the\r\nservice of the king of Poland. In 1626, though a Protestant, he was\r\ninduced by Wallenstein to join the new imperial army, in which he\r\nquickly rose to the rank of field marshal, and won the esteem of his\r\nsoldiers as well as that of his commander, whose close friend and\r\nfaithful ally he became. This attachment to Wallenstein, and a spirit of\r\nreligious toleration, were the leading motives of a strange career of\r\nmilitary and political inconstancy. Thus the dismissal of Wallenstein\r\nand the perilous condition of German Protestantism after the edict of\r\nRestitution combined to induce Arnim to quit the imperial service for\r\nthat of the elector of Saxony. He had served under Gustavus many years\r\nbefore, and later he had defeated him in the field, when in command of a\r\nPolish army; the fortune of war now placed Arnim at the head of the\r\nSaxon army which fought by the side of the Swedes at Breitenfeld (1631),\r\nand indeed the alliance of these two Protestant powers in the cause of\r\ntheir common religion was largely his work. The reappearances of\r\nWallenstein, however, caused him to hesitate and open negotiations,\r\nthough he did not attempt to conceal his proceedings from the elector\r\nand Gustavus. During the Lutzen campaign, Arnim was operating with\r\nsuccess at the head of an allied army in Silesia. In the following year\r\nhe was under the hard necessity of opposing his old friend in the field,\r\nbut little was done by either; the complicated political situation which\r\nfollowed the death of Gustavus at Lutzen led him into a renewal of the\r\nprivate negotiations of the previous year, though he did nothing\r\nactually treasonable in his relations with Wallenstein. In 1634\r\nWallenstein was assassinated, and Arnim began at once more active\r\noperations. He won an important victory at Liegnitz in May 1634, but\r\nfrom this time he became more and more estranged from the Swedes. The\r\npeace of Prague followed, in which Arnim's part, though considerable,\r\nwas not all-important (1635). Soon after this event he refused an offer\r\nof high command in the French army and retired from active life. From\r\n1637 to 1638 he was imprisoned in Stockholm, having been seized at\r\nBoytzenburg by the Swedes on suspicion of being concerned in various\r\nintrigues. He made his escape ultimately, and returned to Saxony. Arnim\r\ndied suddenly at Dresden in 1641, whilst engaged in raising an army to\r\nfree German soil from foreign armies of all kinds.

Helbig, \"Wallenstein und Arnim\" (1850) and \"Der Prager\r\n  Friede,\" in Raumer's _Historisches Taschenbuch_ (1858); also E.D.M.\r\n  Kirchner, _Das Schloss Boytzenburg, &c._ (1860) and _Archiv fur die\r\n  sachsische Geschichte_, vol. viii. (1870).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNO, ARN or AQUILA (c. 750-821), bishop and afterwards archbishop of\r\nSalzburg, entered the church at an early age, and after passing some\r\ntime at Freising became abbot of Elnon, or St Amand as it was afterwards\r\ncalled, where he made the acquaintance of Alcuin. In 785 he was made\r\nbishop of Salzburg and in 787 was employed by Tassilo III., duke of the\r\nBavarians, as an envoy to Charlemagne at Rome. He appears to have\r\nattracted the notice of the Frankish king, through whose influence in\r\n798 Salzburg was made the seat of an archbishopric; and Arno, as the\r\nfirst holder of this office, became metropolitan of Bavaria and received\r\nthe pallium from Pope Leo III. The area of his authority was extended to\r\nthe east by the conquests of Charlemagne over the Avars, and he began to\r\ntake a prominent part in the government of Bavaria. He acted as one of\r\nthe _missi dominici_, and spent some time at the court of Charlemagne,\r\nwhere he was known by the assembled scholars as Aquila, and his name\r\nappears as one of the signatories to the emperor's will. He established\r\na library at Salzburg, furthered in other ways the interests of\r\nlearning, and presided over several synods called to improve the\r\ncondition of the church in Bavaria. Soon after the death of Charlemagne\r\nin 814, Arno appears to have withdrawn from active life, although he\r\nretained his archbishopric until his death on the 24th of January 821.\r\nAided by a deacon named Benedict, Arno drew up about 788 a catalogue of\r\nlands and proprietary rights belonging to the church in Bavaria, under\r\nthe title of _Indiculus_ or _Congestum Arnonis_. An edition of this\r\nwork, which is of considerable value to historical students, was\r\npublished at Munich in 1869 with notes by F. Keinz. Many other works\r\nwere produced under the protection of Arno, among them a Salzburg\r\nconsuetudinary, an edition of which appears in _Quellen und Erorterungen\r\nzur bayrischen und deutschen Geschichte_, Band vii., edited by L.\r\nRockinger (Munich, 1856). It has been suggested by W. von Giesebrecht\r\nthat Arno was the author of an early section of _Annales Laurissenses\r\nmajores_, which deals with the history of the Frankish kings from 741 to\r\n829, and of which an edition appears in _Monumenta Germaniae historica.\r\nScriptores_, Band i. pp. 128-131, edited by G.H. Pertz (Hanover, 1826).\r\nIf this supposition be correct, Arno was the first extant writer to\r\napply the name _Deutsch_ (_theodisca_) to the German language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNO (anc. _Arnus_), a river of Italy which rises from the Monte\r\nFalterona, about 25 m. E.N.E. of Florence, 4265 ft. above the sea. It\r\nfirst runs S.S.E. through a beautiful valley, the Casentino; near Arezzo\r\nit turns W., and at Montevarchi N.N.W.; 10 m. below it forces its way\r\nthrough the limestone rock at Incisa and 10 m. farther on, at\r\nPontassieve, it is joined by the Sieve. Thence it runs westward to\r\nFlorence and through the gorge of Golfolina onwards to Empoli and Pisa,\r\nreceiving various tributaries in its course, and falls into the sea\r\n7-1/2 m. west of Pisa, after a total course of 155 m. In prehistoric\r\ntimes the river ran straight on along the valley of the Chiana and\r\njoined the Tiber near Orvieto; and there was a great lake, the north end\r\nof which was at Incisa and the south at the lake of Chiusi. The distance\r\nfrom Pisa to the mouth in the time of Strabo was only 2-1/2 m. The\r\nSerchio (anc. _Auser_), which joined the Arno at Pisa in ancient times,\r\nnow flows into the sea independently. The Arno is navigable for barges\r\nas far as Florence; but it is liable to sudden floods, and brings down\r\nwith it large quantities of earth and stones, so that it requires\r\ncareful regulation. The most remarkable inundations were those of 1537\r\nand 1740; in the former year the water rose to 8 ft. in the streets of\r\nFlorence. The valley between Incisa and Arezzo contains accumulations of\r\nfossil bones of the deer, elephant, rhinoceros, mastodon, hippopotamus,\r\nbear, tiger, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOBIUS (called _Afer_, and sometimes \"the Elder\"), early Christian\r\nwriter, was a teacher of rhetoric at Sicca Venerea in proconsular Africa\r\nduring the reign of Diocletian. His conversion to Christianity is said\r\nby Jerome to have been occasioned by a dream; and the same writer adds\r\nthat the bishop to whom Arnobius applied distrusted his professions, and\r\nasked some proof of them, and that the treatise _Adversus Gentes_ was\r\ncomposed for this purpose. But this story seems rather improbable; for\r\nArnobius speaks contemptuously of dreams, and besides, his work bears no\r\ntraces of having been written in a short time, or of having been revised\r\nby a Christian bishop. From internal evidence (bk. iv. 36) the time of\r\ncomposition may be fixed at about A.D. 303. Nothing further is known of\r\nthe life of Arnobius. He is said to have been the author of a work on\r\nrhetoric, which, however, has not been preserved. His great treatise, in\r\nseven books, _Adversus Gentes_ (or _Nationes_), on account of which he\r\ntakes rank as a Christian apologist, appears to have been occasioned by\r\na desire to answer the complaint then brought against the Christians,\r\nthat the prevalent calamities and disasters were due to their impiety\r\nand had come upon men since the establishment of their religion. In the\r\nfirst book Arnobius carefully discusses this complaint; he shows that\r\nthe allegation of greater calamities having come upon men since the\r\nChristian era is false; and that, even if it were true, it could by no\r\nmeans be attributed to the Christians. He skilfully contends that\r\nChristians who worship the self-existent God cannot justly be called\r\nless religious than those who worship subordinate deities, and concludes\r\nby vindicating the Godhead of Christ. In the second book Arnobius\r\ndigresses into a long discussion on the soul, which he does not think is\r\nof divine origin, and which he scarcely believes to be immortal. He even\r\nsays that a belief in the soul's immortality would tend to remove moral\r\nrestraint, and have a prejudicial effect on human life. In the\r\nconcluding chapters he answers the objections drawn from the recent\r\norigin of Christianity. Books iii., iv. and v. contain a violent attack\r\non the heathen mythology, in which he narrates with powerful sarcasm the\r\nscandalous chronicles of the gods, and contrasts with their grossness\r\nand immorality the pure and holy worship of the Christian. These books\r\nare valuable as a repertory of mythological stories. Books vi. and vii.\r\nably handle the questions of sacrifices and worship of images. The\r\nconfusion of the final chapter points to some interruption. The work of\r\nArnobius appears to have been written when he was a recent convert, for\r\nhe does not possess a very extensive knowledge of Scripture. He knows\r\nnothing of the Old Testament, and only the life of Christ in the New,\r\nwhile he does not quote directly from the Gospels. He is also at fault\r\nin regard to the Jewish sects. He was much influenced by Lucretius and\r\nhad read Plato. His statements concerning Greek and Roman mythology are\r\nbased respectively on the _Protrepticus_ of Clement of Alexandria, and\r\non Antistius Labeo, who belonged to the preceding generation and\r\nattempted to restore Neoplatonism. There are some pleasing passages in\r\nArnobius, but on the whole he is a tumid and a tedious author.\r\n\r\n  EDITIONS.--Migne, _Patr. Lat._ iv. 349; A.

He is the author of a mystical and allegorical commentary on\r\nthe Psalms, first published by Erasmus in 1522, and by him attributed to\r\nthe elder Arnobius. It has been frequently reprinted, and in the edition\r\nof De la Barre, 1580, is accompanied by some notes on the Gospels by the\r\nsame author. To him has sometimes been ascribed the anonymous treatise,\r\n_Arnobii catholici et Serapionis conflictus de Deo trino et uno ... de\r\ngratiae liberi arbitrii concordia_, which was probably written by a\r\nfollower of Augustine. The opinions of Arnobius, as appears from the\r\ncommentary, are semi-Pelagian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, known as \"ARNOLD OF BRESCIA\" (d. 1155), one of the most ardent\r\nadversaries of the temporal power of the popes. He belonged to a family\r\nof importance, if not noble, and was born probably at Brescia, in Italy,\r\ntowards the end of the 11th century. He distinguished himself in his\r\nmonastic studies, and went to France about 1115. He studied theology in\r\nParis, but there is no proof that he was a pupil of Abelard. Returning\r\nto Italy he became a canon regular. His life was rigidly austere, St\r\nBernard calling him \"homo neque manducans neque bibens.\" He at once\r\ndirected his efforts against the corruption of the clergy, and\r\nespecially against the temporal ambitions of the high dignitaries of the\r\nchurch. During the schism of Anacletus (1131-1137) the town of Brescia\r\nwas torn by the struggles between the partisans of Pope Innocent II. and\r\nthe adherents of the anti-pope, and Arnold gave effect to his abhorrence\r\nof the political episcopate by inciting the people to rise against their\r\nbishop, and, exiled by Innocent II., went to France. St Bernard accused\r\nhim of sharing the doctrines of Abelard (see _Ep._ 189, 195), and\r\nprocured his condemnation by the council of Sens (1140) at the same time\r\nas that of the great scholastic. This was perhaps no more than the\r\noutcome of the fierce polemical spirit of the abbot of Clairvaux, which\r\nled him to include all his adversaries under a single anathema. It seems\r\ncertain that Arnold professed moral theology in Paris, and several times\r\nreprimanded St Bernard, whom he accused of pride and jealousy. St\r\nBernard, as a last resort, begged King Louis VII. to take severe\r\nmeasures against Arnold, who had to leave France and take refuge at\r\nZurich. There he soon became popular, especially with the lay nobility;\r\nbut, denounced anew by St Bernard to the ecclesiastical authorities, he\r\nreturned to Italy, and turned his steps towards Rome (1145). It was two\r\nyears since, in 1143, the Romans had rejected the temporal power of the\r\npope. The urban nobles had set up a republic, which, under forms\r\nostensibly modelled on antiquity (e.g. patriciate, _senatus populusque\r\nromanus_, &c.), concealed but clumsily a purely oligarchical government.\r\nPope Eugenius III. and his adherents had been forced after a feeble\r\nresistance to resign themselves to exile at Viterbo. Arnold, after\r\nreturning to Rome, immediately began a campaign of virulent denunciation\r\nagainst the Roman clergy, and, in particular, against the Curia, which\r\nhe stigmatized as a \"house of merchandise and den of thieves.\" His\r\nenemies have attributed to him certain doctrinal heresies, but their\r\naccusations do not bear examination. According to Otto of Freising\r\n(_Lib. de gestis Friderici_, bk. ii. chap. xx.) the whole of his\r\nteaching, outside the preaching of penitence, was summed up in these\r\nmaxims:--\"Clerks who have estates, bishops who hold fiefs, monks who\r\npossess property, cannot be saved.\" His eloquence gained him a hearing\r\nand a numerous following, including many laymen, but consisting\r\nprincipally of poor ecclesiastics, who formed around him a party\r\ncharacterized by a rigid morality and not unlike the Lombard Patarenes\r\nof the 11th century. But his purely political action was very\r\nrestricted, and not to be compared with that of a Rienzi or a\r\nSavonarola. The Roman revolution availed itself of Arnold's popularity,\r\nand of his theories, but was carried out without his aid. His name was\r\nassociated with this political reform solely because his was the only\r\nvigorous personality which stood out from the mass of rebels, and\r\nbecause he was the principal victim of the repression that ensued. On\r\nthe 15th of July 1148 Eugenius III. anathematized Arnold and his\r\nadherents; but when, a short time afterwards, the pope, through the\r\nsupport of the king of Naples and the king of France, succeeded in\r\nentering Rome, Arnold remained in the town unmolested, under the\r\nprotection of the senate. But in 1152 the German king Conrad III., whom\r\nthe papal party and the Roman republic had in vain begged to intervene,\r\nwas succeeded by Frederick I. Barbarossa. Frederick, whose authoritative\r\ntemper was at once offended by the independent tone of the Arnoldist\r\nparty, concluded with the pope a treaty of alliance (October 16, 1152)\r\nof such a nature that the Arnoldists were at once put in a minority in\r\nthe Roman government; and when the second successor of Eugenius III.,\r\nthe energetic and austere Adrian IV. (the Englishman, Nicholas\r\nBreakspear), placed Rome under an interdict, the senate, already rudely\r\nshaken, submitted, and Arnold was forced to fly into Campania (1155). At\r\nthe request of the pope he was seized by order of the emperor Frederick,\r\nthen in Italy, and delivered to the prefect of Rome, by whom he was\r\ncondemned to death. In June 1155 Arnold was hanged, his body burnt, and\r\nthe ashes were thrown into the Tiber. His death produced but a feeble\r\nsensation in Rome, which was already pacified, and passed almost\r\nunnoticed in Italy. The adherents of Arnold do not appear actually to\r\nhave formed, either before or after his death, a heretical sect. It is\r\nprobable that his adherents became merged in the communities of the\r\nLombard Waldenses, who shared their ideas on the corruption of the\r\nclergy. Legend, poetry, drama and politics have from time to time been\r\nmuch occupied with the personality of Arnold of Brescia, and not seldom\r\nhave distorted it, through the desire to see in him a hero of Italian\r\nindependence and a modern democrat. He was before everything an ascetic,\r\nwho denied to the church the right of holding property, and who occupied\r\nhimself only as an accessory with the political and social consequences\r\nof his religious principles.\r\n\r\n  The bibliography of Arnold of Brescia is very vast and of very unequal\r\n  value. The following works will be found useful: W. von Giesebrecht,\r\n  _Arnold van Brescia_ (Munich, 1873); G. Gaggia, _Arnaldo da Brescia_\r\n  (Brescia, 1882); and notices by Vacandard in the _Revue des questions\r\n  historiques_ (Paris, 1884), pp. 52-114, by R. Breyer in the _Histor.\r\n  Taschenbuch_ (Leipzig, 1889), vol. viii. pp. 123-178, and by A.\r\n  Hausrath in _Neue Heidelberg. Jahrb._ (1891), Band i. pp. 72-144.\r\n       (P. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, BENEDICT (1741-1801), American soldier, born in Norwich,\r\nConnecticut, on the 14th of January 1741. He was the great-grandson of\r\nBenedict Arnold (1615-1678), thrice colonial governor of Rhode Island\r\nbetween 1663 and 1678; and was the fourth in direct descent to bear the\r\nname. He received a fair education but was not studious, and his youth\r\nwas marked by the same waywardness which characterized his whole career.\r\nAt fifteen he ran away from home and took part in an expedition against\r\nthe French, but, restless under restraint, he soon deserted and returned\r\nhome. In 1762 he settled in New Haven, where he became the proprietor of\r\na drug and book shop; and he subsequently engaged successfully in trade\r\nwith the West Indies. Immediately after the battle of Lexington Arnold\r\nled the local militia company, of which he was captain, and additional\r\nvolunteers to Cambridge, and on the 29th of April 1775 he proposed to\r\nthe Massachusetts Committee of Safety an expedition against Crown Point\r\nand Ticonderoga. After a delay of four days the offer was accepted, and\r\nas a colonel of Massachusetts militia he was directed to enlist in the\r\nwest part of Massachusetts and in the neighbouring colonies the men\r\nnecessary for the undertaking. He was forestalled, however, by Ethan\r\nAllen (q.v.), acting on behalf of some members of the Connecticut\r\nAssembly. Under him, reluctantly waiving his own claim to command,\r\nArnold served as a volunteer; and soon afterwards, Massachusetts having\r\nyielded to Connecticut, and having angered Arnold by sending a committee\r\nto make an inquiry into his conduct, he resigned and returned to\r\nCambridge. He was then ordered to co-operate with General Richard\r\nMontgomery in the invasion of Canada, which he had been one of the first\r\nto suggest to the Continental Congress. Starting with 1100 men from\r\nCambridge on the 17th of September 1775, he reached Gardiner, Maine, on\r\nthe 20th, advanced through the Maine woods, and after suffering terrible\r\nprivations and hardships, his little force, depleted by death and\r\ndesertion, reached Quebec on the 13th of November. The garrison had been\r\nforewarned, and Arnold was compelled to await the coming of Montgomery\r\nfrom Montreal. The combined attack on the 31st of December 1775 failed;\r\nMontgomery was killed, and Arnold was severely wounded. Arnold, who had\r\nbeen commissioned a brigadier-general in January 1776, remained in\r\nCanada until the following June, being after April in command at\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nSome time after the retreat from Canada, charges of misconduct and\r\ndishonesty, growing chiefly out of his seizure from merchants in\r\nMontreal of goods for the use of his troops, were brought against him;\r\nthese charges were tardily investigated by the Board of War, which in a\r\nreport made on the 23rd of May 1777, and confirmed by Congress, declared\r\nthat his \"character and conduct\" had been \"cruelly and groundlessly\r\naspersed.\" Having constructed a flotilla on Lake Champlain, Arnold\r\nengaged a greatly superior British fleet near Valcour Island (October\r\n11, 1776), and after inflicting severe loss on the enemy, made his\r\nescape under cover of night. Two days later he was overtaken by the\r\nBritish fleet, which however he, with only one war-vessel, and that\r\ncrippled, delayed long enough to enable his other vessels to make good\r\ntheir escape, fighting with desperate valour and finally running his own\r\nship aground and escaping to Crown Point. The engagement of the 11th was\r\nthe first between British and American fleets. Arnold's brilliant\r\nexploits had drawn attention to him as one of the most promising of the\r\nContinental officers, and had won for him the friendship of Washington.\r\nNevertheless, when in February 1777 Congress created five new\r\nmajor-generals, Arnold, although the ranking brigadier, was passed over,\r\npartly at least for sectional reasons--Connecticut had already two\r\nmajor-generals--in favour of his juniors. At this time it was only\r\nWashington's urgent persuasion that prevented Arnold from leaving the\r\nservice. Two months later while he was at New Haven, Governor Tryon's\r\ndescent on Danbury took place; and Arnold, who took command of the\r\nmilitia after the death of General Wooster, attacked the British with\r\nsuch vigour at Ridgefield (April 27, 1777) that they escaped to their\r\nships with difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of this service Arnold was now commissioned major-general\r\n(his commission dating from 17th February) but without his former\r\nrelative rank. After serving in New Jersey with Washington, he joined\r\nGeneral Philip Schuyler in the Northern Department, and in August 1777\r\nproceeded up the Mohawk Valley against Colonel St Leger, and raised the\r\nsiege of Fort Stanwix (or Schuyler). Subsequently, after Gates had\r\nsuperseded Schuyler (August 19), Arnold commanded the American left wing\r\nin the first battle of Saratoga (September 19, 1777). His ill-treatment\r\nat the hands of General Gates, whose jealousy had been aroused, led to a\r\nquarrel which terminated in Arnold being relieved of command. He\r\nremained with the army, however, at the urgent request of his brother\r\nofficers, and although nominally without command served brilliantly in\r\nthe second battle of Saratoga (October 7, 1777), during which he was\r\nseriously wounded. For his services he was thanked by Congress, and\r\nreceived a new commission giving him at last his proper relative rank.\r\n\r\nIn June 1778 Washington placed him in command of Philadelphia. Here he\r\nsoon came into conflict with the state authorities, jealous of any\r\noutside control. In the social life of Philadelphia, largely dominated\r\nby families of Loyalist sympathies, Arnold was the most conspicuous\r\nfigure; he lived extravagantly, entertained lavishly, and in April 1779\r\ntook for his second wife, Margaret Shippen (1760-1804), the daughter of\r\nEdward Shippen (1729-1806), a moderate Loyalist, who eventually became\r\nreconciled to the new order and was in 1799-1805 chief-justice of the\r\nstate. Early in February 1779 the executive council of Pennsylvania,\r\npresided over by Joseph Reed, one of his most persistent enemies,\r\npresented to Congress eight charges of misconduct against Arnold, none\r\nof which was of any great importance. Arnold at once demanded an\r\ninvestigation, and in March a committee of Congress made a report\r\nexonerating him; but Reed obtained a reconsideration, and in April 1779\r\nCongress, though throwing out four charges, referred the other four to a\r\ncourt-martial. Despite Arnold's demand for a speedy trial, it was\r\nDecember before the court was convened. It was probably during this\r\nperiod of vexatious delay that Arnold, always sensitive and now incited\r\nby a keen sense of injustice, entered into a secret correspondence with\r\nSir Henry Clinton with a view to joining the British service. On the\r\n26th of January 1780 the court, before which Arnold had ably argued his\r\nown case, rendered its verdict, practically acquitting him of all\r\nintentional wrong, but, apparently in deference to the Pennsylvania\r\nauthorities, directing Washington to reprimand him for two trivial and\r\nvery venial offences. Arnold, who had confidently expected absolute\r\nacquittal, was inflamed with a burning anger that even Washington's\r\nkindly reprimand, couched almost in words of praise, could not subdue.\r\n\r\nIt was now apparently that he first conceived the plan of betraying some\r\nimportant post to the British. With this in view he sought and obtained\r\nfrom Washington (August 1780) command of West Point, the key to the\r\nHudson River Valley. Arnold's offers now became more explicit, and, in\r\norder to perfect the details of the plot, Clinton's adjutant-general,\r\nMajor John Andre, met him near Stony Point on the night of the 21st of\r\nSeptember. On the 23rd, while returning by land, Andre with\r\nincriminating papers was captured, and the officer to whom he was\r\nentrusted unsuspectingly sent information of his capture to Arnold, who\r\nwas thus enabled to escape to the British lines. Arnold, commissioned a\r\nbrigadier-general in the British army, received L6315 in compensation\r\nfor his property losses, and was employed in leading an expedition into\r\nVirginia which burned Richmond, and in an attack upon New London (q.v.)\r\nin September 1781. In December 1781 he removed to London and was\r\nconsulted on American affairs by the king and ministry, but could obtain\r\nno further employment in the active service. Disappointed at the failure\r\nof his plans and embittered by the neglect and scorn which he met in\r\nEngland, he spent the years 1787-1791 at St John, New Brunswick, once\r\nmore engaging in the West India trade, but in 1791 he returned to\r\nLondon, and after war had broken out between Great Britain and France,\r\nwas active in fitting out privateers. Gradually sinking into\r\nmelancholia, worn down by depression, and suffering from a nervous\r\ndisease, he died at London on the 14th of June 1801.\r\n\r\nArnold had three sons--Benedict, Richard and Henry--by his first wife,\r\nand four sons--Edward Shippen, James Robertson, George and William\r\nFitch--by his second wife; five of them, and one grandson, served in the\r\nBritish army.

The best general account is Isaac Newton Arnold's _Life of\r\n  Benedict Arnold_ (Chicago, 1880), which, while offering no apologies\r\n  or defence of his treason, lays perhaps too great emphasis on his\r\n  provocations. Charles Burr Todd's _The Real Benedict Arnold_ (New\r\n  York, 1903) is a curious attempt to make Arnold's wife wholly\r\n  responsible for his defection. Francois de Barbe-Marbois's _Complot\r\n  d'Arnold et de Sir H. Clinton contre les Etats-Unis_ (Paris, 1816)\r\n  contains much interesting material, but is inaccurate. Two good\r\n  accounts of the Canadian Expedition are Justin H. Smith's _Arnold's\r\n  March from Cambridge to Quebec_ (New York, 1903), which contains a\r\n  reprint of Arnold's journal of the expedition; and John Codman's\r\n  _Arnold's Expedition to Quebec_ (New York, 1901). Arnold's _Letters on\r\n  the Expedition to Canada_ were printed in the Maine Historical\r\n  Society's _Collections_ for 1831 (repr. 1865). See also William\r\n  Abbatt, _The Crisis of the Revolution_ (New York, 1899); _The Northern\r\n  Invasion of 1780_ (Bradford Club Series, No. 6, New York, 1866); \"The\r\n  Treason of Benedict Arnold\" (letters of Sir Henry Clinton to Lord\r\n  George Germaine) in _Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography_,\r\n  vol. xxii. (Philadelphia, 1898); and _Proceedings of a General Court\r\n  Martial for the Trial of Major-General Arnold_ (Philadelphia, 1780;\r\n  reprinted with introduction and notes, New York, 1865).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, SIR EDWIN (1832-1904), British poet and journalist, was born on\r\nthe 10th of June 1832, and was educated at the King's school, Rochester;\r\nKing's College, London; and University College, Oxford, where in 1852 he\r\ngained the Newdigate prize for a poem on Belshazzar's feast. On leaving\r\nOxford he became a schoolmaster, and went to India as principal of the\r\ngovernment Sanskrit College at Poona, a post which he held during the\r\nmutiny of 1857, when he was able to render services for which he was\r\npublicly thanked by Lord Elphinstone in the Bombay council. Returning to\r\nEngland in 1861 he worked as a journalist on the staff of the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_, a newspaper with which he continued to be associated for\r\nmore than forty years. It was he who, on behalf of the proprietors of\r\nthe _Daily Telegraph_ in conjunction with the _New York Herald_,\r\narranged for the journey of H.M. Stanley to Africa to discover the\r\ncourse of the Congo, and Stanley named after him a mountain to the\r\nnorth-east of Albert Edward Nyanza. Arnold must also be credited with\r\nthe first idea of a great trunk line traversing the entire African\r\ncontinent, for in 1874 he first employed the phrase \"a Cape to Cairo\r\nrailway\" subsequently popularized by Cecil Rhodes. It was, however, as a\r\npoet that he was best known to his contemporaries. _The Light of Asia_\r\nappeared in 1879 and won an immediate success, going through numerous\r\neditions both in England and America. It is an Indian epic, dealing with\r\nthe life and teaching of Buddha, which are expounded with much wealth of\r\nlocal colour and not a little felicity of versification. The poem\r\ncontains many lines of unquestionable beauty; and its immediate\r\npopularity was rather increased than diminished by the twofold criticism\r\nto which it was subjected. On the one hand it was held by Oriental\r\nscholars to give a false impression of Buddhist doctrine; while, on the\r\nother, the suggested analogy between Sakyamuni and Christ offended the\r\ntaste of some devout Christians. The latter criticism probably suggested\r\nto Arnold the idea of attempting a second narrative poem of which the\r\ncentral figure should be the founder of Christianity, as the founder of\r\nBuddhism had been that of the first. But though _The Light of the World_\r\n(1891), in which this idea took shape, had considerable poetic merit, it\r\nlacked the novelty of theme and setting which had given the earlier poem\r\nmuch of its attractiveness; and it failed to repeat the success attained\r\nby _The Light of Asia_. Arnold's other principal volumes of poetry were\r\n_Indian Song of Songs_ (1875), _Pearls of the Faith_ (1883), _The Song\r\nCelestial_ (1885), _With Sadi in the Garden_ (1888), _Potiphar's Wife_\r\n(1892) and _Adzuma_ (1893). In his later years Arnold resided for some\r\ntime in Japan, and his third wife was a Japanese lady. In _Seas and\r\nLands_ (1891) and _Japonica_ (1892) he gives an interesting study of\r\nJapanese life. He received the order of C.S.I. on the occasion of the\r\nproclamation of Queen Victoria as empress of India in 1877, and in 1888\r\nwas created K.C.I.E. He also possessed decorations conferred by the\r\nrulers of Japan, Persia, Turkey and Siam. Sir Edwin Arnold died on the\r\n24th of March 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, GOTTFRIED (1666-1714), German Protestant divine, was born at\r\nAnnaberg, in Saxony, where his father was a schoolmaster. In 1682 he\r\nwent to the Gymnasium at Gera, and three years later to the university\r\nof Wittenberg. Here he made a special study of theology and history, and\r\nafterwards, through the influence of P.J. Spener, \"the father of\r\npietism,\" he became tutor in Quedlinburg. His first work, _Die Erste\r\nLiebe zu Christo_, to which in modern times attention was again directed\r\nby Leo Tolstoy, appeared in 1696. It went through five editions before\r\n1728, and gained the author much reputation. In the year after its\r\npublication he was invited to Giessen as professor of church history.\r\nThe life and work here, however, proved so distasteful to him that he\r\nresigned in 1698, and returned to Quedlinburg. In 1699 he began to\r\npublish his largest work, described by Tolstoy (_The Kingdom of God is\r\nwithin You_, chap, iii.) as \"remarkable, although little known,\"\r\n_Unparteiische Kirchen- und Ketzerhistorie_, in which he has been\r\nthought by some to show more impartiality towards heresy than towards\r\nthe Church (cp. Otto Pfleiderer, _Development of Theology_, p. 277). His\r\nnext work, _Geheimniss der gottlichen Sophia_, published in 1700, seemed\r\nto indicate that he had developed a form of mysticism. Soon afterwards,\r\nhowever, his acceptance of a pastorate marked a change, and he produced\r\na number of noteworthy works on practical theology. He was also known as\r\nthe author of sacred poems. Gottfried Arnold has rightly been classed\r\nwith the pietistic section of Protestant historians (_Bibliotheca\r\nSacra_, 1850).\r\n\r\n  See Calwer-Zeller, _Theologisches Handworterbuch_, and the account of\r\n  him in Albert Knapp's new edition of _Die erste Liebe zu Christo_\r\n  (1845).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, MATTHEW (1822-1888), English poet, literary critic and inspector\r\nof schools, was born at Laleham, near Staines, on the 24th of December\r\n1822. When it is said that he was the son of the famous Dr Arnold of\r\nRugby, and that Winchester, Rugby and Balliol College, Oxford,\r\ncontributed their best towards his education, it seems superfluous to\r\nadd that, in estimating Matthew Arnold and his work, training no less\r\nthan original endowment has to be considered. A full academic training\r\nhas its disadvantages as well as its gains. In the individual no less\r\nthan in the species the history of man's development is the history of\r\nthe struggle between the impulse to express original personal force and\r\nthe impulse to make that force bow to the authority of custom. Where in\r\nany individual the first of these impulses is stronger than usual, a\r\ncomplete academic training is a gain; but where the second of these\r\nimpulses is the dominant one, the effect of the academic habit upon the\r\nmind at its most sensitive and most plastic period is apt to be\r\ncrippling. In regard to Matthew Arnold, it would be a bold critic of his\r\nlife and his writings who should attempt to say what his work would have\r\nbeen if his training had been different. In his judgments on Goethe,\r\nWordsworth, Byron, Shelley and Hugo, it may be seen how strong was his\r\nimpulse to bow to authority. On the other hand, in Arnold's ingenious\r\nreasoning away the conception of Providence to \"a stream of tendency not\r\nourselves which makes for righteousness,\" we see how strong was his\r\nnatural impulse for taking original views. The fact that the very air\r\nArnold breathed during the whole of the impressionable period of his\r\nlife was academic is therefore a very important fact to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nIn one of his own most charming critical essays he contrasts the poetry\r\nof Homer, which consists of \"natural thoughts in natural words,\" with\r\nthe poetry of Tennyson, which consists of \"distilled thoughts in\r\ndistilled words.\" \"Distilled\" is one of the happiest words to be found\r\nin poetical criticism, and may be used with equal aptitude in the\r\ncriticism of life. To most people the waters of life come with all their\r\nnatural qualities--sweet or bitter--undistilled. Only the ordinary\r\nconditions of civilization, common to all, flavoured the waters of life\r\nto Shakespeare, to Cervantes, to Burns, to Scott, to Dumas, and those\r\nother great creators whose minds were mirrors--broad and clear--for\r\nreflecting the rich drama of life around them. To Arnold the waters of\r\nlife came distilled so carefully that the wonder is that he had any\r\noriginality left. A member of the upper stratum of that \"middle class\"\r\nwhich he despised, or pretended to despise--the eldest son of one of the\r\nmost accomplished as well as one of the most noble-tempered men of his\r\ntime--Arnold from the moment of his birth drank the finest distilled\r\nwaters that can be drunk even in these days. Perhaps, on the whole, the\r\nsurprising thing is how little he suffered thereby. Indeed those who had\r\nformed an idea of Arnold's personality from their knowledge of his\r\n\"culture,\" and especially those who had been delighted by the fastidious\r\nand feminine delicacy of his prose style, used to be quite bewildered\r\nwhen for the first time they met him at a dinner-table or in a friend's\r\nsmoking-room. His prose was so self-conscious that what people expected\r\nto find in the writer was the Arnold as he was conceived by certain\r\n\"young lions\" of journalism whom he satirized--a somewhat over-cultured\r\n_petit-maitre_--almost, indeed, a coxcomb of letters. On the other hand,\r\nthose who had been captured by his poetry expected to find a man whose\r\nsensitive organism responded nervously to every uttered word as an\r\naeolian harp answers to the faintest breeze. What they found was a\r\nbroad-shouldered, manly--almost burly--Englishman with a fine\r\ncountenance, bronzed by the open air of England, wrinkled apparently by\r\nthe sun, wind-worn as an English skipper's, open and frank as a\r\nfox-hunting squire's--and yet a countenance whose finely chiselled\r\nfeatures were as high-bred and as commanding as Wellington's or Sir\r\nCharles Napier's. The voice they heard was deep-toned, fearless, rich\r\nand frank, and yet modulated to express every _nuance_ of thought, every\r\nmovement of emotion and humour. In his prose essays the humour he showed\r\nwas of a somewhat thin-lipped kind; in his more important poems he\r\nshowed none at all. It was here, in this matter of humour, that Arnold's\r\nwritings were specially misleading as to the personality of the man.\r\nJudged from his poems, it was not with a poet like the writer of \"The\r\nNorthern Farmer,\" or a poet like the writer of \"Ned Bratts,\" that any\r\nstudent of poetry would have dreamed of classing him. Such a student\r\nwould actually have been more likely to class him with two of his\r\ncontemporaries between whom and himself there were but few points in\r\ncommon, the \"humourless\" William Morris and the \"humourless\" Rossetti.\r\nFor, singularly enough, between him and them there was this one point of\r\nresemblance: while all three were richly endowed with humour, while all\r\nthree were the very lights of the sets in which they moved, the moment\r\nthey took pen in hand to write poetry they became sad. It would almost\r\nseem as if, like Rossetti, Arnold actually held that poetry was not the\r\nproper medium for humour. No wonder, then, if the absence of humour in\r\nhis poetry did much to mislead the student of his work as to the real\r\ncharacter of the man.\r\n\r\nAfter a year at Winchester, Matthew Arnold entered Rugby school in 1837.\r\nHe early began to write and print verses. His first publication was a\r\nRugby prize poem, _Alaric at Rome_, in 1840. This was followed in 1843,\r\nafter he had gone up to Oxford in 1840 as a scholar of Balliol, by his\r\npoem _Cromwell_, which won the Newdigate prize. In 1844 he graduated\r\nwith second-class honours, and in 1845 was elected a fellow of Oriel\r\nCollege, where among his colleagues was A.H. Clough, his friendship with\r\nwhom is commemorated in that exquisite elegy _Thyrsis_. From 1847 to\r\n1851 he acted as private secretary to Lord Lansdowne; and in the latter\r\nyear, after acting for a short time as assistant-master at Rugby, he was\r\nappointed to an inspectorship of schools, a post which he retained until\r\ntwo years before his death. He married, in June 1851, the daughter of Mr\r\nJustice Wightman, Meanwhile, in 1849, appeared _The Strayed Reveller,\r\nand other Poems, by A_, a volume which gained a considerable esoteric\r\nreputation. In 1852 he published another volume under the same initial,\r\n_Empedocles on Etna, and other Poems_. _Empedocles_ is as undramatic a\r\npoem perhaps as was ever written in dramatic form, but studded with\r\nlyrical beauties of a very high order. In 1853 Arnold published a volume\r\nof _Poems_ under his own name. This consisted partially of poems\r\nselected from the two previous volumes. A second series of poems, which\r\ncontained, however, only two new ones, was published in 1855. So great\r\nwas the impression made by these in academic circles, that in 1857\r\nArnold was elected professor of poetry at Oxford, and he held the chair\r\nfor ten years. In 1858 he published his classical tragedy, _Merope_.\r\nNine years afterwards his _New Poems_ (1867) were published. While he\r\nheld the Oxford professorship he published several series of lectures,\r\nwhich gave him a high place as a scholar and critic. The essays[1] _On\r\nTranslating Homer: Three Lectures given at Oxford_, published in 1861,\r\nsupplemented in 1862 by _On Translating Homer: Last Words_, a fourth\r\nlecture given in reply to F.W. Newman's _Homeric Translation in Theory\r\nand Practice_ (1861), and _On the Study of Celtic Literature_, published\r\nin 1867, were full of subtle and brilliant if not of profound criticism.\r\nSo were the two series of _Essays in Criticism_, the first of which,\r\nconsisting of articles reprinted from various reviews, appeared in 1865.\r\nThe essay on \"A Persian Passion Play\" was added in the editions of 1875;\r\nand a second series, edited by Lord Coleridge, appeared in 1888.\r\n\r\nArnold's poetic activity almost ceased after he left the chair of poetry\r\nat Oxford. He was several times sent by government to make inquiries\r\ninto the state of education in France, Germany, Holland and other\r\ncountries; and his reports, with their thorough-going and searching\r\ncriticism of continental methods, as contrasted with English methods,\r\nshowed how conscientiously he had devoted some of his best energies to\r\nthe work. His fame as a poet and a literary critic has somewhat\r\novershadowed the fact that he was during thirty-five years of his\r\nlife--from 1851 to 1836--employed in the Education Department as one of\r\nH.M. inspectors of schools, while his literary work was achieved in such\r\nintervals of leisure as could be spared from the public service. At the\r\ntime of his appointment the government, by arrangement with the\r\nreligious bodies, entrusted the inspection of schools connected with the\r\nChurch of England to clergymen, and agreed also to send Roman Catholic\r\ninspectors to schools managed by members of that communion. Other\r\nschools--those of the British and Foreign Society, the Wesleyans, and\r\nundenominational schools generally--were inspected by laymen, of whom\r\nArnold was one. There were only three or four of these officers at\r\nfirst, and their districts were necessarily large. It is to the\r\nexperience gained in intercourse with Nonconformist school managers that\r\nwe may attribute the curiously intimate knowledge of religious sects\r\nwhich furnished the material for some of his keen though good-humoured\r\nsarcasms. The Education Act of 1870, which simplified the administrative\r\nsystem, abolished denominational inspection, and thus greatly reduced\r\nthe area assigned to a single inspector. Arnold took charge of the\r\ndistrict of Westminster, and remained in that office until his\r\nresignation, taking also an occasional share in the inspection of\r\ntraining colleges for teachers, and in conferences at the central\r\noffice. His letters, _passim_, show that some of the routine which\r\ndevolved upon him was distasteful, and that he was glad to entrust to a\r\nskilled assistant much of the duty of individual examination and the\r\nmaking up of schedules and returns. But the influence he exerted on\r\nschools, on the department, and on the primary education of the whole\r\ncountry, was indirectly far greater than is generally supposed. His\r\nannual reports, of which more than twenty were collected into a volume\r\nby his friend and official chief, Sir Francis (afterwards Lord)\r\nSandford, attracted, by reason of their freshness of style and thought,\r\nmuch more of public attention than is usually accorded to blue-book\r\nliterature; and his high aims, and his sympathetic appreciation of the\r\nefforts and difficulties of the teachers, had a remarkable effect in\r\nraising the tone of elementary education, and in indicating the way to\r\nimprovement. In particular, he insisted on the formative elements of\r\nschool education, on literature and the \"humanities,\" as distinguished\r\nfrom the collection of scraps of information and \"useful knowledge\"; and\r\nhe sought to impress all the young teachers with the necessity of\r\nbroader mental cultivation than was absolutely required to obtain the\r\ngovernment certificate. In his reports also he dwelt often and forcibly\r\non the place which the study of the Bible, not the distinctive\r\nformularies of the churches, ought to hold in English schools. He urged\r\nthat besides the religious and moral purposes of Scriptural teaching, it\r\nhad a literary value of its own, and was the best instrument in the\r\nhands even of the elementary teacher for uplifting the soul and refining\r\nand enlarging the thoughts of young children.\r\n\r\nOn three occasions Arnold was asked to assist the government by making\r\nspecial inquiries into the state of education in foreign countries.\r\nThese duties were especially welcome to him, serving as they did as a\r\nrelief from the monotony of school inspection at home, and as\r\nopportunities for taking a wider survey of the whole subject of\r\neducation, and for expressing his views on principles and national aims\r\nas well as administrative details. In 1859, as foreign assistant\r\ncommissioner, he prepared for the duke of Newcastle's commission to\r\ninquire into the subject of elementary education a report (printed 1860)\r\nwhich was afterwards reprinted (1861) in a volume entitled _The Popular\r\nEducation of France, with Notices of that of Holland and Switzerland_.\r\nIn 1865 he was again employed as assistant-commissioner by the Schools\r\nInquiry Commission under Lord Taunton; and his report on this subject,\r\n_On Secondary Education in Foreign Countries_ (1866), was subsequently\r\nreprinted under the title _Schools and Universities on the Continent_\r\n(1868). Twenty years later he was sent by the Education Department to\r\nmake special inquiries on certain specified points, e.g. free education,\r\nthe status and training of teachers, and compulsory attendance at\r\nschools. The result of this investigation appeared as a parliamentary\r\npaper, _Special Report on certain points connected with Elementary\r\nEducation in Germany, Switzerland and France_, in 1886. He also\r\ncontributed the chapter on \"Schools\" (1837-1887) to the second volume of\r\nMr Humphry Ward's _Reign of Queen Victoria_. Part of his official\r\nwritings may be studied in _Reports for Elementary Schools_ (1852-1882),\r\nedited by Sir F. Sandford in 1889.\r\n\r\nAll these reports form substantial contributions to the history and\r\nliterature of education in the Victorian age. They have been quoted\r\noften, and have exercised marked influence on subsequent changes and\r\ncontroversies. One great purpose underlies them all. It is to bring home\r\nto the English people a conviction that education ought to be a national\r\nconcern, that it should not be left entirely to local, or private, or\r\nirresponsible initiative, that the watchful jealousy so long shown by\r\nLiberals, and especially by Nonconformists, in regard to state action\r\nwas a grave practical mistake, and that in an enlightened democracy,\r\nanimated by a progressive spirit and noble and generous ideals, it was\r\nthe part of wisdom to invoke the collective power of the state to give\r\neffect to those ideals. To this theme he constantly recurred in his\r\nessays, articles and official reports. \"_Porro unum est necessarium_.\r\nOne thing is needful; organize your secondary education.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 a pension of L250 was conferred on Arnold in recognition of his\r\nliterary merits. In the same year he went to the United States on a\r\nlecturing tour, and again in 1886, his subjects being \"Emerson\" and the\r\n\"Principles and Value of Numbers.\" The success of these lectures, though\r\nthey were admirable in matter and form, was marred by the lecturer's\r\nlack of experience in delivery. It is sufficient, further, to say that\r\n_Culture and Anarchy: an Essay in Political and Social Criticism_,\r\nappeared in 1869; _St Paul and Protestantism, with an Introduction on\r\nPuritanism and the Church of England_ (1870); _Friendship's Garland:\r\nbeing the Conversations, Letters and Opinions of the late Arminius Baron\r\nvan Thunder-ten-Tronckh_ (1871); _Literature and Dogma: an Essay towards\r\na Better Apprehension of the Bible_ (1873); _God and the Bible: a Review\r\nof Objections to Literature and Dogma_ (1875); _Last Essays on Church\r\nand Religion_ (1877); _Mixed Essays_ (1879); _Irish Essays and Others_\r\n(1882); _Discourses in America_ (1885). Such essays as the first of\r\nthese, embodying as they did Arnold's views of theological and polemical\r\nsubjects, attracted much attention at the time of their publication,\r\nowing to the state of the intellectual atmosphere at the moment; but it\r\nis doubtful, perhaps, whether they will be greatly considered in the\r\nnear future. Many severe things have been said, and will be said,\r\nconcerning the inadequacy of poets like Coleridge and Wordsworth when\r\nconfronting subjects of a theological or philosophical kind.\r\nWordsworth's High Church Pantheism and Coleridge's disquisitions on the\r\nLogos seem farther removed from the speculations of to-day than do the\r\ndreams of Lucretius. But these two great writers lived before the days\r\nof modern science. Arnold, living only a few years later, came at a\r\ntransition period when the winds of tyrannous knowledge had blown off\r\nthe protecting roof that had covered the centuries before, but when time\r\nand much labour were needed to build another roof of new materials--a\r\nperiod when it was impossible for the poet to enjoy either the quietism\r\nof High Church Pantheism in which Wordsworth had basked, or the\r\nsheltering protection of German metaphysics under which Coleridge had\r\npreached--a period, nevertheless, when the wonderful revelations of\r\nscience were still too raw, too cold and hard, to satisfy the yearnings\r\nof the poetic soul. Objectionable as Arnold's rationalizing criticism\r\nwas to contemporary orthodoxy, and questionable as was his equipment in\r\npoint of theological learning, his spirituality of outlook and ethical\r\npurpose were not to be denied. Yet it is not Arnold's views that have\r\nbecome current coin so much as his literary phrases--his craving for\r\n\"culture\" and \"sweetness and light,\" his contempt for \"the dissidence of\r\nDissent and the Protestantism of the Protestant religion,\" his \"stream\r\nof tendency not ourselves making for righteousness,\" his classification\r\nof \"Philistines and barbarians\"--and so forth. His death at Liverpool,\r\nof heart failure on the 15th of April 1888, was sudden and quite\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\nArnold was a prominent figure in that great galaxy of Victorian poets\r\nwho were working simultaneously--Tennyson, Browning, Rossetti, William\r\nMorris and Swinburne--poets between whom there was at least this\r\nconnecting link, that the quest of all of them was the old-fashioned\r\npoetical quest of the beautiful. Beauty was their watchword, as it had\r\nbeen the watchword of their immediate predecessors--Wordsworth,\r\nColeridge, Keats, Shelley and Byron. That this group of early\r\n19th-century poets might be divided into two--those whose primary quest\r\nwas physical beauty, and those whose primary quest was moral beauty-is\r\nno doubt true. Still, in so far as beauty was their quest they were all\r\nakin. And so with the Victorian group to which Arnold belonged. As to\r\nthe position which he takes among them opinions must necessarily vary.\r\nOn the whole, his place in the group will be below all the others. The\r\nquestion as to whether he was primarily a poet or a _prosateur_ has been\r\noften asked. If we were to try to answer that question here, we should\r\nhave to examine his poetry in detail--we should have to inquire whether\r\nhis primary impulse of expression was to seize upon the innate\r\nsuggestive power of words, or whether his primary impulse was to rely\r\nupon the logical power of the sentence. In nobility of temper, in\r\nclearness of statement, and especially in descriptive power, he is\r\nbeyond praise. But intellect, judgment, culture and study of great poets\r\nmay do much towards enabling a prose-writer to write what must needs be\r\ncalled good poetry. What they cannot enable him to do is to produce\r\nthose magical effects which poets of the rarer kind can achieve by\r\nseizing that mysterious, suggestive power of words which is far beyond\r\nall mere statement. Notwithstanding the exquisite work that Arnold has\r\nleft behind him, some critics have come to the conclusion that his\r\nprimary impulse in expression was that of the poetically-minded\r\n_prosateur_ rather than that of the born poet. And this has been said by\r\nsome who nevertheless deeply admire poems like \"The Scholar Gypsy,\"\r\n\"Thyrsis,\" \"The Forsaken Merman,\" \"Dover Beach,\" \"Heine's Grave,\" \"Rugby\r\nChapel,\" \"The Grande Chartreuse,\" \"Sohrab and Rustum,\" \"The Sick King in\r\nBokhara,\" \"Tristram and Iseult,\" &c. It would seem that a man may show\r\nall the endowments of a poet save one, and that one the most\r\nessential--the instinctive mastery over metrical effects.\r\n\r\nIn all literary expression there are two kinds of emphasis, the emphasis\r\nof sound and the emphasis of sense. Indeed the difference between those\r\nwho have and those who have not the true rhythmic instinct is that,\r\nwhile the former have the innate faculty of making the emphasis of sound\r\nand the emphasis of sense meet and strengthen each other, the latter are\r\nwithout that faculty. But so imperfect is the human mind that it can\r\nrarely apprehend or grasp simultaneously these two kinds of emphasis.\r\nWhile to the born _prosateur_ the emphasis of sense comes first, and\r\nrefuses to be more than partially conditioned by the emphasis of sound,\r\nto the born poet the emphasis of sound comes first, and sometimes will,\r\neven as in the case of Shelley, revolt against the tyranny of the\r\nemphasis of sense. Perhaps the very origin of the old quantitative\r\nmetres was the desire to make these two kinds of emphasis meet in the\r\nsame syllable. In manipulating their quantitative metrical system the\r\nGreeks had facilities for bringing one kind of emphasis into harmony\r\nwith the other such as are unknown to writers in accentuated metres.\r\nThis accounts for the measureless superiority of Greek poetry in verbal\r\nmelody as well as in general harmonic scheme to all the poetry of the\r\nmodern world. In writers so diverse in many ways as Homer, Aeschylus,\r\nSophocles, Pindar, Sappho, the harmony between the emphasis of sound and\r\nthe emphasis of sense is so complete that each of these kinds of\r\nemphasis seems always begetting, yet always born of the other. When in\r\nEurope the quantitative measures were superseded by the accentuated\r\nmeasures a reminiscence was naturally and inevitably left behind of the\r\nold system; and the result has been, in the English language at least,\r\nthat no really great line can be written in which the emphasis of\r\naccent, the emphasis of quantity and the emphasis of sense do not meet\r\non the same syllable. Whenever this junction does not take place the\r\nweaker line, or lines, are always introduced, not for makeshift\r\npurposes, but for variety, as in the finest lines of Milton and\r\nWordsworth. Wordsworth no doubt seems to have had a theory that the\r\naccent of certain words, such as \"without,\" \"within,\" &c., could be\r\ndisturbed in an iambic line; but in his best work he does not act upon\r\nhis theory, and endeavours most successfully to make the emphasis of\r\naccent, of quantity and of sense meet. It might not be well for a poem\r\nto contain an entire sequence of such perfect lines as\r\n\r\n  \"I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous boy,\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  \"Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart,\"\r\n\r\nfor then the metricist's art would declare itself too loudly and weaken\r\nthe imaginative strength of the picture. But such lines should no doubt\r\nform the basis of the poem, and weaker lines--lines in which there is no\r\nsuch combination of the three kinds of emphasis--should be sparingly\r\nused, and never used for makeshift purposes. Now, neither by instinct\r\nnor by critical study was Arnold ever able to apprehend this law of\r\nprosody. If he does write a line of the first order, metrically\r\nspeaking, he seems to do so by accident. Such weak lines as these are\r\nconstantly occurring--\r\n\r\n  \"The poet, to whose mighty heart\r\n   Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart,\r\n   Subdues that energy to scan\r\n   Not his own course, but that of man.\"\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about what is called the \"Greek temper\" of Matthew\r\nArnold's muse. A good deal depends upon what it meant by the Hellenic\r\nspirit. But if the Greek temper expresses itself, as is generally\r\nsupposed, in the sweet acceptance and melodious utterance of the beauty\r\nof the world as it is, accepting that beauty without inquiring as to\r\nwhat it means and as to whither it goes, it is difficult to see where in\r\nArnold's poetry this temper declares itself. Surely it is not in\r\n_Empedocles on Etna_, and surely it is not in _Merope_. If there is a\r\npoem of his in which one would expect to find the joyous acceptance of\r\nlife apart from questionings about the civilization in which the poet\r\nfinds himself environed (its hopes, its fears, its aspirations and its\r\nfailures)--such questionings, in short, as were for ever Vexing Arnold's\r\nsoul--it would be in \"The Scholar Gypsy,\" a poem in which the poet tries\r\nto throw himself into the mood of a \"Romany Rye.\" The great attraction\r\nof the gypsies to Englishmen of a certain temperament is that they alone\r\nseem to feel the joyous acceptance of life which is supposed to be\r\nspecially Greek. Hence it would have been but reasonable to look, if\r\nanywhere, for the expression of Arnold's Greek temper in a poem which\r\nsets out to describe the feelings of the student who, according to\r\nGlanville's story, left Oxford to wander over England with the Romanies.\r\nBut instead of this we got the old fretting about the unsatisfactoriness\r\nof modern civilization. Glanville's Oxford student, whose story is\r\nglanced at now and again in the poem, flits about in the scenery like a\r\ncloud-shadow on the grass; but the way in which Arnold contrives to\r\navoid giving us the faintest idea either dramatic or pictorial of the\r\nstudent about whom he talks so much, and the gypsies with whom the\r\nstudent lived, is one of the most singular feats in poetry. The\r\nreflections which come to a young Oxonian lying on the grass and longing\r\nto escape life's fitful fever without shuffling off this mortal coil,\r\nare, no doubt, beautiful reflections beautifully expressed, but the\r\ntemper they show is the very opposite of the Greek. To say this is not\r\nin the least to disparage Arnold. \"A man is more like the age in which\r\nhe lives,\" says the Chinese aphorism, \"than he is like his own father\r\nand mother,\" and Arnold's polemical writings alone are sufficient to\r\nshow that the waters of life he drank were from fountains distilled,\r\nseven times distilled, at the topmost slope of 19th-century\r\ncivilization. Mr George Meredith's \"Old Chartist\" exhibits far more of\r\nthe temper of acceptance than does any poem by Matthew Arnold.\r\n\r\nHis most famous critical dictum is that poetry is a \"criticism of\r\nlife.\" What he seems to have meant is that poetry is the crowning fruit\r\nof a criticism of life; that just as the poet's metrical effects are and\r\nmust be the result of a thousand semiconscious generalizations upon the\r\nlaws of cause and effect in metric art, so the beautiful things he says\r\nabout life and the beautiful pictures he paints of life are the result\r\nof his generalizations upon life as he passes through it, and\r\nconsequently that the value of his poetry consists in the beauty and the\r\ntruth of his generalizations. But this is saying no more than is said in\r\nthe line--\r\n\r\n  \"Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable\"--\r\n\r\nor in the still more famous lines--\r\n\r\n  \"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,'--that is all\r\n   Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"\r\n\r\nTo suppose that Arnold confounded the poet with the writer of _pensees_\r\nwould be absurd. Yet having decided that poetry consists of\r\ngeneralizations on human life, in reading poetry he kept on the watch\r\nfor those generalizations, and at last seemed to think that the less and\r\nnot the more they are hidden behind the dramatic action, and the more\r\nunmistakably they are intruded as generalizations, the better. For\r\ninstance, in one of his essays he quotes those lines from the \"Chanson\r\nde Roland\" of Turoldus, where Roland, mortally wounded, lays himself\r\ndown under a pine-tree with his face turned towards Spain and the enemy,\r\nand begins to \"call many things to remembrance; all the lands which his\r\nvalour conquered, and pleasant France, and the men of his lineage, and\r\nCharlemagne, his liege lord, who nourished him\"--\r\n\r\n  \"De plusurs choses a remembrer li prist,\r\n   De tames teres cume li bers cunquist,\r\n   De dulce France, des humes de sun ligu,\r\n   De Carlemagne sun seignor ki l'nurrit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" says Arnold, \"is primitive work, I repeat, with an undeniable\r\npoetic quality of its own. It deserves such praise, and such praise is\r\nsufficient for it.\" Then he contrasts it with a famous passage in\r\nHomer--that same passage which is quoted in the article POETRY, for the\r\nvery opposite purpose to that of Arnold's, quoted indeed to show how the\r\nepic poet, leaving the dramatic action to act as chorus, weakens the\r\n[Greek: apatae] of the picture--the passage in the _Iliad_ (iii 243-244)\r\nwhere the poet, after Helen's pathetic mention of her brother's comments\r\non the causes of their absence, \"criticizes life\" and generalizes upon\r\nthe impotence of human intelligence, the impotence even of human love,\r\nto pierce the darkness in which the web of human fate is woven. He\r\nappends Dr Hawtrey's translation:--\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Os phato roys d ede katechen physizoos aia\r\n  en Lakedaimoni authi, phile en patridi gaie.]\r\n\r\n  \"So said she; they long since in Earth's soft arms were reposing\r\n   There, in their own dear land, their fatherland, Lacedaemon.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are here,\" says Arnold, \"in another world, another order of poetry\r\naltogether; here is rightly due such supreme praise as that which M.\r\nVitel gives to the _Chanson de Roland_. If our words are to have any\r\nmeaning, if our judgments are to have any solidity, we must not heap\r\nthat supreme praise upon poetry of an order immeasurably inferior.\" He\r\ndoes not see that the two passages cannot properly be compared at all.\r\nIn the one case the poet gives us a dramatic picture; in the other; a\r\ncomment on a dramatic picture.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, indeed, the place Arnold held and still holds as a critic is\r\ndue more to his exquisite felicity in expressing his views than to the\r\npenetration of his criticism. Nothing can exceed the easy grace of his\r\nprose at the best. It is conversational and yet absolutely exact in the\r\nstructure of the sentences; and in spite of every vagary, his\r\ndistinguishing note is urbanity. Keen-edged as his satire could be, his\r\nwriting for the most part is as urbane as Addison's own. His influence\r\non contemporary criticism and contemporary ideals was considerable, and\r\ngenerally wholesome. His insistence on the necessity of looking at \"the\r\nthing in itself,\" and the need for acquainting oneself with \"the best\r\nthat has been thought and said in the world,\" gave a new stimulus alike\r\nto originality and industry in criticism; and in his own selection of\r\nsubjects--such as _Joubert_, or the _de Guerins_--he opened a new world\r\nto a larger class of the better sort of readers, exercising in this\r\nrespect an awakening influence in his own time akin to that of Walter\r\nPater a few years afterwards. The comparison with Pater might indeed be\r\npressed further, and yet too far. Both were essentially products of\r\nOxford. But Arnold, whose description of that \"home of lost causes, and\r\nforsaken beliefs, and unpopular names, and impossible loyalties,\" is in\r\nitself almost a poem, had a classical austerity in his style that\r\nsavoured more intimately of Oxford tradition, and an ethical earnestness\r\neven in his most flippant moments which kept him notably aloof from the\r\nmore sensuous school of aesthetics.\r\n\r\n  The first collected edition of Arnold's poems was published in 1869 in\r\n  two volumes, the first consisting of _Narrative and Elegiac Poems_,\r\n  and the second of _Dramatic and Lyric Poems_. Other editions appeared\r\n  in 1877, 1881; a library edition (3 vols., 1885); a one-volume reprint\r\n  of the poems printed in the library edition with one or two additions\r\n  (1890). Publications by Matthew Arnold not mentioned in the foregoing\r\n  article include: _England and the Italian Question_ (1859), a\r\n  pamphlet; _A French Eton; or, Middle Class Education and the State_\r\n  (1864); _Higher Schools and Universities in Germany_ (1874), a partial\r\n  reprint from _Schools and Universities on the Continent_ (1868); _A\r\n  Bible Reading for Schools; The Great Prophecy of Israel's\r\n  Restoration_, an arrangement of _Isaiah_, chs. xl.-lxvi. (1872),\r\n  republished with additions and varying titles in 1875 and 1883; an\r\n  edition of the _Six Chief Lives from Johnson's Lives of the Poets_\r\n  (1878); editions of the _Poems of Wordsworth_ (1879), and the _Poetry\r\n  of Byron_ (1881), for the Golden Treasury Series, with prefatory\r\n  essays reprinted in the second series of _Essays in Criticism_; an\r\n  edition of _Letters, Speeches and Tracts on Irish Affairs by Edmund\r\n  Burke_ (1881); and many contributions to periodical literature. _The\r\n  Letters of Matthew Arnold_ (1848-1888) were collected and arranged by\r\n  George W.E. Russell in 1895, reprinted 1901. _Matthew Arnold's Note\r\n  Books, with a Preface by the Hon. Mrs Wodehouse_, appeared in 1902. A\r\n  complete and uniform edition of _The Works of Matthew Arnold_ (15\r\n  vols., 1904-1905) includes the letters as edited by Mr Russell. Vol.\r\n  iii. contains a complete bibliography of his works, many of the early\r\n  editions of which are very valuable, by Mr T.B. Smart, who published a\r\n  separate bibliography in 1892. A valuable note on the rather\r\n  complicated subject of Arnold's bibliography is given by Mr H. Buxton\r\n  Forman in Arnold's _Poems, Narrative, Elegiac and Lyric_ (Temple\r\n  Classics, 1900).\r\n\r\n  It was Arnold's expressed desire that his biography should not be\r\n  written, and before his letters were published they underwent\r\n  considerable editing at the hands of his family. There are, however,\r\n  monographs on Matthew Arnold (1899) in _Modern English Writers_ by\r\n  Prof. Saintsbury, and by Mr H.W. Paul (1902), in the English Men of\r\n  Letters Series. These two works are supplemented by Mr G.W.E. Russell,\r\n  who, as the editor of Arnold's letters, is in a sense the official\r\n  biographer, in _Matthew Arnold_ (1904, Literary Lives Series). There\r\n  are also studies of Arnold in Mr J.M. Robertson's _Modern Humanists_\r\n  (1891), and in W.H. Hudson's _Studies in Interpretation_ (1896), in\r\n  Sir J.G. Fitch's _Thomas and Matthew Arnold_ (1897), and a review of\r\n  some of the works above mentioned in the _Quarterly_ for January 1905\r\n  by T.H. Warren.     (T. W.-D.; J. G.

He received a thorough musical education at the\r\nChapel Royal, and when little more than twenty years of age was\r\nappointed composer at Covent Garden theatre. Here, in 1765, he produced\r\nhis popular opera, _The Maid of the Mill_, many of the songs in which\r\nwere selected from the works of Italian composers. In 1776 he\r\ntransferred his services to the Haymarket theatre. In 1783 he was made\r\ncomposer to George III. Between 1765 and 1802 he wrote as many as\r\nforty-three operas, after-pieces and pantomimes, of which the best were\r\n_The Maid of the Mill_, _Rosamond_, _Inkle and Yarico_, _The Battle of\r\nHexham_, _The Mountaineers_. His oratorios included _The Cure of Saul_\r\n(1767), _Abimelech_ (1768), _The Resurrection_ (1773), _The Prodigal\r\nSon_ (1777) and _Elisha_ (1795). In 1783 he became organist to the\r\nChapel Royal. In 1786 he began an edition of Handel's works, which\r\nextended to 40 volumes, but was never completed. In 1793 he became\r\norganist of Westminster Abbey, where he was buried after his death on\r\nthe 22nd of October 1802. Arnold is chiefly remembered now for the\r\npublication of his _Cathedral Music, being a collection in score of the\r\nmost valuable and useful compositions for that service by the several\r\nEnglish masters of the last 200 years_ (1790).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, THOMAS (1705-1842), English clergyman and headmaster of Rugby\r\nschool, was born at West Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, on the 13th of\r\nJune 1795. He was the son of William and Martha Arnold, the former of\r\nwhom occupied the situation of collector of customs at Cowes. His\r\nfather died suddenly of spasm in the heart in 1801, and his early\r\neducation was confided by his mother to her sister, Miss Delafield. From\r\nher tuition he passed to that of Dr Griffiths, at Warminster, in\r\nWiltshire, in 1803; and in 1807 he was removed to Winchester, where he\r\nremained until 1811, having entered as a commoner, and afterwards become\r\na scholar of the college. In after life he retained a lively feeling of\r\ninterest in Winchester school, and remembered with admiration and profit\r\nthe regulative tact of Dr Goddard and the preceptorial ability of Dr\r\nGabell, who were successively head-masters during his stay there.\r\n\r\nFrom Winchester he removed to Oxford in 1811, where he became a scholar\r\nat Corpus Christi College; in 1815 he was elected fellow of Oriel\r\nCollege, and there he continued to reside until 1819. This interval was\r\ndiligently devoted to the pursuit of classical and historical studies,\r\nto preparing himself for ordination, and to searching investigations,\r\nunder the stimulus of continued discussion with a band of talented and\r\ncongenial associates, of the profoundest questions in theology,\r\necclesiastical polity and social philosophy. The authors he most\r\ncarefully studied at this period were Thucydides and Aristotle, and for\r\ntheir writings he formed an attachment which remained to the close of\r\nhis life, and exerted a powerful influence upon his mode of thought and\r\nopinions, as well as upon his literary occupations in subsequent years.\r\nHerodotus also came in for a considerable share of his regard, but more,\r\napparently, for recreation than for work. Accustomed freely and\r\nfearlessly to investigate whatever came before him, and swayed by a\r\nscrupulous dread of insincerity, he was doomed to long and anxious\r\nhesitation concerning some of the fundamental points of theology before\r\narriving at a firm conviction of the truth of Christianity. Once\r\nsatisfied, however, his faith remained clear and firm; and thenceforward\r\nhis life became that of a supremely _religious_ man.\r\n\r\nTo the name of Christ he was prepared to \"surrender his whole soul,\" and\r\nto render before it \"obedience, reverence without measure, intense\r\nhumility, most unreserved adoration\" (_Serm. ns._ vol. iv. p. 210). He\r\ndid not often talk about religion; he had not much of the accredited\r\nphraseology of piety even when he discoursed on spiritual topics; but\r\nmore than most men he was directed by religious principle and feeling in\r\nall his conduct. He left Oxford in 1819, and settled at Laleham, near\r\nStaines, where he took pupils for the university. His spare time was\r\ndevoted to the prosecution of studies in philology and history, more\r\nparticularly to the study of Thucydides, and of the new light which had\r\nbeen cast upon Roman history and upon historical method in general by\r\nthe researches of Niebuhr. He was also occasionally engaged in\r\npreaching, and it was whilst here that he published the first volume of\r\nhis sermons. Shortly after he settled at Laleham, he married Mary,\r\nyoungest daughter of the Rev. John Penrose, rector of Fledborough,\r\nNottinghamshire. After nine years spent at Laleham he was induced to\r\noffer himself as a candidate for the vacant head-mastership of Rugby;\r\nand though he entered somewhat late upon the contest, and though none of\r\nthe electors was personally known to him, he was elected in December\r\n1827. In June 1828 he received priest's orders; in April end November of\r\nthe same year he took his degrees of B.D. and D.D., and in August\r\nentered on his new office.\r\n\r\nIn one of the testimonials which accompanied his application to the\r\ntrustees of Rugby, the writer stated it as his conviction that \"if Mr\r\nArnold were elected, he would change the face of education all through\r\nthe public schools of England.\" This somewhat hazardous pledge was nobly\r\nredeemed. Under Arnold's superintendence the school became not merely a\r\nplace where a certain amount of classical or general learning was to be\r\nobtained, but a sphere of intellectual, moral and religious discipline,\r\nwhere healthy characters were formed, and men were trained for the\r\nduties, and struggles and responsibilities of life. His energies were\r\nchiefly devoted to the business of the school; but he found time also\r\nfor much literary work, as well as for an extensive correspondence. Five\r\nvolumes of sermons, an edition of Thucydides, with English notes and\r\ndissertations, a History of Rome in three vols. 8vo, beside numerous\r\narticles in reviews, journals, newspapers and encyclopaedias, are extant\r\nto attest the untiring activity of his mind, and his patient diligence\r\nduring this period. His interest also in public matters was incessant,\r\nespecially ecclesiastical questions, and such as bore upon the social\r\nwelfare and moral improvement of the masses.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, after fourteen years at Rugby, Dr Arnold was appointed by Lord\r\nMelbourne, then prime minister, to the chair of modern history at\r\nOxford. On the 2nd of December 1841 he delivered his inaugural lecture.\r\nSeven other lectures were delivered during the first three weeks of the\r\nLent term of 1842. When the midsummer vacation arrived, he was preparing\r\nto set out with his family to Fox How in Westmoreland, where he had\r\npurchased some property and built a house. But he was suddenly attacked\r\nby angina pectoris, and died on Sunday, the 12th of June 1842. His\r\nremains were interred on the following Friday in the chancel of Rugby\r\nchapel, immediately under the communion table.\r\n\r\nThe great peculiarity and charm of Dr Arnold's nature seemed to lie in\r\nthe supremacy of the moral and the spiritual element over his whole\r\nbeing. He was not a notable scholar, and he had not much of what is\r\nusually called tact in his dealings either with the juvenile or the\r\nadult mind. What gave him his power, and secured for him so deeply the\r\nrespect and veneration of his pupils and acquaintances, was the\r\nintensely religious character of his whole life. He seemed ever to act\r\nfrom a severe and lofty estimate of duty. To be just, honest and\r\ntruthful, he ever held to be the first aim of his being.\r\n\r\n  His _Life_ was written by Dean Stanley (1845).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOTT, NEIL (1788-1874), Scottish physician, was born at Arbroath on\r\nthe 15th of May 1788. He studied medicine first at Aberdeen, and\r\nsubsequently in London under Sir Everard Home (1756-1832), through whom\r\nhe obtained, while yet in his nineteenth year, the appointment of full\r\nsurgeon to an East Indiaman. After making two voyages to China he\r\nsettled in 1811 to practise in London, and speedily acquired high\r\nreputation in his profession. Within a few years he was made physician\r\nto the French and Spanish embassies, and in 1837 he became a physician\r\nextraordinary to the queen. From his earliest youth Arnott had an\r\nintense love of natural philosophy, and to this was added an\r\ninventiveness which served him in good stead in his profession and\r\nyielded the \"Arnott water-bed,\" the \"Arnott ventilator,\" the \"Arnott\r\nstove,\" &c. He was the author of several works bearing on physical\r\nscience or its applications, the most important being his _Elements of\r\nPhysics_ (1827), which went through six editions in his lifetime. In\r\n1838 he published a treatise on _Warming and Ventilating_, and, in 1855,\r\none on the _Smokeless Fireplace_. He was a strong advocate of\r\nscientific, as opposed to purely classical, education; and he manifested\r\nhis interest in natural philosophy by the gift of L2000 to each of the\r\nfour universities of Scotland and to the university of London, to\r\npromote its study in the experimental and practical form. He died in\r\nLondon on the 2nd of March 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOULD-PLESSY, JEANNE SYLVANIE (1819-1897), French actress, was born in\r\nMetz on the 7th of September 1819, the daughter of a local actor named\r\nPlessy. She was a pupil of Samson at the Conservatoire in 1829, and made\r\nher _debut_ as Emma at the Comedie Francaise in 1834 in Alexandre\r\nDuval's _La Fille d'honneur_. She had an immense success, and Mlle Mars,\r\nto whom the public already compared her, took her up. Until 1845 she had\r\nprominent parts in all the plays, new and old, at the Theatre Francais,\r\nwhen suddenly at the height of her success, she left Paris and went to\r\nLondon, marrying the dramatic author, J.F. Arnould (d. 1854), a man much\r\nolder than herself. The Comedie Francaise, after having tried in vain to\r\nbring her back, brought a suit against her, and obtained heavy damages.\r\nIn the meantime Madame Arnould-Plessy accepted an engagement at the\r\nFrench theatre at St Petersburg, where she played for nine years. In\r\n1855 she returned to Paris and was re-admitted to the Comedie Francaise,\r\nas _pensionnaire_ with an engagement for eight years. This second part\r\nof her career was even more brilliant than the first. She revived some\r\nof her old roles, but began to abandon the _jeunes premieres_ for the\r\n\"lead,\" in which she had a success unequalled since the retirement of\r\nMlle Mars. Her later triumphs were especially associated with new plays\r\nby Emile Augier, _Le Fils de Giboyer_ and _Maitre Guerin_. Her last\r\nappearance was in Edouard Cadol's _La Grand-maman_; she retired in 1876,\r\nand died in 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNSBERG, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Westphalia,\r\nromantically situated on an eminence almost surrounded by the river\r\nRuhr, 44 m. S.E. of Munster and 58 m. E.N.E. of Dusseldorf by rail. Pop.\r\n(1900) 8490. It is the seat of the provincial authorities, and has three\r\nchurches, a court of appeal, a Roman Catholic gymnasium, which was\r\nformerly the Benedictine abbey of Weddinghausen, a library, a normal\r\nschool and a chamber of commerce. Weaving, brewing and distilling are\r\ncarried on, and there are manufactories of white lead, shot and paper,\r\nworks for the production of railway plant, and saw-mills. Near the town\r\nare the ruins of the castle of the counts of Arnsberg, the last of whom,\r\nGottfried, sold his countship, in 1368, to the archbishop of Cologne.\r\nThe countship was incorporated by the archbishops in their duchy of\r\nWestphalia, which in 1802 was assigned to Hesse-Darmstadt and in 1815 to\r\nPrussia. The town, which had received its first charter in 1237 and\r\nlater joined the Hanseatic League, became the capital of the duchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNSTADT, a town in the principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen,\r\nGermany, on the river Gera, 11 m. S. of Erfurt, with which it is\r\nconnected by rail. Pop. (1900) 14,413. There are five churches, four\r\nProtestant and one Catholic. The Evangelical Liebfrauenkirche, a\r\nRomanesque building (mainly 12th-century), has two octagonal towers and\r\na 10th-century porch. The palace contains collections of pictures and\r\nporcelain, and attached to it is a magnificent tower, all that remains\r\nof the castle built in 1560. The town hall dates from 1561. The\r\nindustries of Arnstadt include iron and other metal founding, the\r\nmanufacture of leather, cloth, tobacco, weighing-machines, paper,\r\nplaying-cards, chairs, gloves, shoes, iron safes, and beer, and\r\nmarket-gardening and trade in grain and wood are carried on. There are\r\ncopper-mines in the neighbourhood, as well as tepid saline springs, the\r\nwaters of which are used for bathing, and are much frequented in summer.\r\nArnstadt dates back to the 8th century. It was bought in 1306 by the\r\ncounts of Schwarzburg, who lived here till 1716.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNSWALDE, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Prussia, in a marshy\r\ndistrict between four lakes, 20 m. S.W. of Stargard and on the main line\r\nbetween that place and Posen. Besides the Gothic church there are no\r\nnoteworthy public buildings. Its industries include iron founding,\r\nmachinery, and manufactures of cloth, matches and starch. Pop. (1900)\r\n8665.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNULF (c. 850-899), Roman emperor, illegitimate son of Carloman, king\r\nof Bavaria and Italy, was made margrave of Carinthia about 876, and on\r\nhis father's death in 880 his dignity and possessions were confirmed by\r\nthe new king of the east Franks, Louis III. The failure of legitimate\r\nmale issue of the later Carolingians gave Arnulf a more important\r\nposition than otherwise he would have occupied; but he did homage to the\r\nemperor Charles the Fat in 882, and spent the next few years in constant\r\nwarfare with the Slavs and the Northmen. In 887, however, Arnulf\r\nidentified himself with the disgust felt by the Bavarians and others at\r\nthe incapacity of Charles the Fat. Gathering a large army, he marched to\r\nTribur; Charles abdicated and the Germans recognized Arnulf as their\r\nking, a proceeding which L. von Ranke describes as \"the first\r\nindependent action of the German secular world.\" Arnulf's real authority\r\ndid not extend far beyond the confines of Bavaria, and he contented\r\nhimself with a nominal recognition of his supremacy by the kings who\r\nsprang up in various parts of the Empire. Having made peace with the\r\nMoravians, he gained a great and splendid victory over the Northmen near\r\nLouvain in October 891, and in spite of some opposition succeeded in\r\nestablishing his illegitimate son, Zwentibold, as king of the district\r\nafterwards called Lorraine. Invited by Pope Formosus to deliver him from\r\nthe power of Guido III., duke of Spoleto, who had been crowned emperor,\r\nArnulf went to Italy in 894, but after storming Bergamo and receiving\r\nthe homage of some of the nobles at Pavia, he was compelled by\r\ndesertions from his army to return. The restoration of peace with the\r\nMoravians and the death of Guido prepared the way for a more successful\r\nexpedition in 895 when Rome was stormed by his troops; and Arnulf was\r\ncrowned emperor by Formosus in February 896. He then set out to\r\nestablish his authority in Spoleto, but on the way was seized with\r\nparalysis. He returned to Bavaria, where he died on the 8th of December\r\n899, and was buried at Regensburg. He left, by his wife Ota, a son Louis\r\nsurnamed the Child. Arnulf possessed the qualities of a soldier, and was\r\na loyal supporter of the church.\r\n\r\n  See \"Annales Fuldenses\" in the _Monumenta Germaniae historica.\r\n  Scriptores_, Band i.

It is\r\ngenerally distributed in temperate and tropical regions, but especially\r\ndeveloped in warm countries. The common British representative of the\r\norder, _Arum maculatum_ (cuckoo-pint, lords and ladies, or wake robin),\r\ngives a meagre idea of its development. The plants are generally\r\nherbaceous, often, however, reaching a gigantic size, but are sometimes\r\nshrubby, as in _Pothos_, a genus of shrubby climbing plants, chiefly\r\nMalayan. _Monstera_ is a tropical American genus of climbing shrubs,\r\nwith large often much-perforated leaves; the fruiting spikes of a\r\nMexican species, _M. deliciosa_, are eaten. The roots of the climbing\r\nspecies are of interest in their adaptation to the mode of life of the\r\nplant. For instance, some species of _Philodendron_ have a growth like\r\nthat of ivy, with feeding roots penetrating the soil and clasping roots\r\nwhich fix the plant to its support. In other species of the genus the\r\nseed germinates on a branch, and the seedling produces clasping roots,\r\nand roots which grow downwards hanging like stout cords, and ultimately\r\nreaching the ground. The leaves, which show great variety in size and\r\nform, are generally broad and net-veined, but in sweet-flag (_Acorus\r\nCalamus_) are long and narrow with parallel veins. In _Arum_ the blade\r\nis simple, as also in the so-called arum-lily (_Richardia_), a South\r\nAfrican species common in Britain as a greenhouse plant, and in\r\n_Caladium_, a tropical South American genus, and _Alocasia_ (tropical\r\nAsia), species of which are favourite warm-greenhouse plants on account\r\nof their variegated leaves. In other genera the leaves are much divided\r\nand sometimes very large; those of _Dracontium_ (tropical America) may\r\nbe 15 ft. high, with a long stem-like stalk and a much-branched\r\nspreading blade. The East Indian genus _Amorphophallus_ has a similar\r\nhabit. A good series of tropical aroids is to be seen in the aroid house\r\nat Kew. The so-called water cabbage (_Pistia Stratiotes_) is a floating\r\nplant widely distributed in the tropics, and consisting of rosettes of\r\nbroadish leaves several inches across and a tuft of roots hanging in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arum maculatum_, Cuckoo-pint.\r\n\r\n  1.

Showing in succession (from below) female flowers,\r\n  male flowers, and sterile flowers forming a ring of hairs borne on the\r\n  spadix.]\r\n\r\nThe small flowers are densely crowded on thick fleshy spikes, which are\r\nassociated with, and often more or less enveloped by, a large leaf\r\n(bract), the so-called spathe, which, as in cuckoo-pint, where it is\r\ngreen in colour, _Richardia_, where it is white, creamy or yellow,\r\n_Anthurium_, where it is a brilliant scarlet, is often the most striking\r\nfeature of the plant. The details of the structure of the flower show a\r\nwide variation; the flowers are often extremely simple, sometimes as in\r\n_Arum_, reduced to a single stamen or pistil. The fruit is a berry--the\r\nscarlet berries of the cuckoo-pint are familiar objects in the hedges in\r\nlate summer. The plants generally contain an acrid poisonous juice. The\r\nunderground stems (rhizomes or tubers) are rich in starch; from that of\r\n_Arum maculatum_ Portland arrowroot was formerly extensively prepared by\r\npounding with water and then straining; the starch was deposited from\r\nthe strained liquid.\r\n\r\nThe order is represented in Britain by _Arum maculatum_, a low\r\nherbaceous plant common in woods and hedgerows in England, but probably\r\nnot wild in Scotland. It grows from a whitish root-stock which sends up\r\nin the spring a few long-stalked, arrow-shaped leaves of a polished\r\ngreen, often marked with dark blotches. These are followed by the\r\ninflorescence, a fleshy spadix bearing in the lower part numerous\r\nclosely crowded simple unisexual flowers and continued above into a\r\npurplish or yellowish appendage; the spadix is enveloped by a leafy\r\nspathe, constricted in the lower part to form a chamber, in which are\r\nthe flowers. The mouth of this chamber is protected by a ring of hairs\r\npointing downwards, which allow the entrance but prevent the escape of\r\nsmall flies; after fertilization of the pistils the hairs wither. The\r\ninsects visit the plant in large numbers, attracted by the foetid smell,\r\nand act as carriers of the pollen from one spathe to another. As the\r\nfruit ripens the spathe withers, and the brilliant red berries are\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThe sweet-flag _Acorus Calamus_ (q.v.), which occurs apparently wild in\r\nEngland in ditches, ponds, &c., is supposed to have been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAROLSEN, a town of Germany, capital of the principality of Waldeck, 25\r\nm. N.W. of Cassel, with which it is connected by rail via Warburg. Pop.\r\n3000. It lies in a pleasant undulating country at an elevation of 900\r\nft. above the sea. The Evangelical parish church contains some fine\r\nstatues by Christian Rauch, and the palace (built 1710-1720), in\r\naddition to a valuable library of 30,000 vols., a collection of coins\r\nand pictures, among the latter several by Angelica Kauffmann. Arolsen is\r\nthe birthplace of the sculptor C. Rauch and of the painters Wilhelm and\r\nFriedrich Kaulbach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARONA, a town of Piedmont, Italy, in the province of Novara, on the W.\r\nbank of Lake Maggiore, 3 m. from its S. extremity, 23 m. N. of Novara,\r\nand 42 m. N.W. of Milan by rail. Pop. (1901) 4700. It is a railway\r\ncentre of some importance on the Simplon line, and is also the southern\r\nterminus of the steamers which ply on Lake Maggiore. The church of S.\r\nMaria contains a fine altar-piece by Gaudenzio Ferrari. On a hill to the\r\nnorth of the town stands a colossal bronze statue of S. Carlo Borromeo\r\n(born here in 1538), erected in 1697. The pedestal, of red granite, is\r\n42 ft. high, and the statue 70 ft. high; the latter is hollow, and can\r\nbe ascended from within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARPEGGIO (from Ital. _arpeggiare_, to play upon the harp), in music, the\r\nnotes of a chord, played in rapid succession as on a harp, and not\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARPI (Gr. [Greek: Hargorippa]), an ancient city of Apulia, 20 m. W. of\r\nthe sea coast, and 5 m. N. of the modern Foggia. The legend attributes\r\nits foundation to Diomedes, and the figure of a horse, which appears on\r\nits coins, shows the importance of horse-breeding in early times in the\r\ndistrict. Its territory extended to the sea, and Strabo says that from\r\nthe extent of the city walls one could gather that it had once been one\r\nof the greatest cities of Italy. As a protection against the Samnites\r\nArpi became an ally of Rome, and remained faithful until after the\r\nbattle of Cannae, but Fabius captured it in 213 B.C., and it never\r\nrecovered its former importance. It lay on a by-road from Luceria to\r\nSipontum. No Roman inscriptions have, indeed, been found here, and\r\nremains of antiquity are scanty. Foggia is its medieval representative.\r\n     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARPINO (anc. _Arpinum_), a town of Campania, Italy, in the province of\r\nCaserta, 1475 ft. above sea-level; 12 m. by rail N.W. of Roccasecca, a\r\nstation on the railway from Naples to Rome. Pop. (1901) 10,607. Arpino\r\noccupies the lower part of the site of the ancient Volscian town of\r\nArpinum, which was finally taken from the Samnites by the Romans in 305\r\nB.C. It became a _civitas sine suffragio_, but received full privileges\r\n(_civitas cum suffragio_) in 188 B.C. with Formiae and Fundi; it was\r\ngoverned as a _praefectura_ until the Social War, and then became a\r\n_municipium_. The ancient polygonal walls, which are still finely\r\npreserved, are among the best in Italy. They are built of blocks of\r\npudding-stone, originally well jointed, but now much weathered. They\r\nstand free in places to a height of 11 ft., and are about 7 ft. wide at\r\nthe top. A single line of wall, with medieval round towers at intervals,\r\nruns on the north side from the present town to Civitavecchia (2055\r\nft.), on the site of the ancient citadel. Here is the Porta dell' Arco,\r\na gate of the old wall, with an aperture 15 ft. high, formed by the\r\ngradual inclination of the two sides towards one another. Below Arpino,\r\nin the valley of the Liris, between the two arms of its tributary the\r\nFibrenus, and 3/4 m. north of Isola del Liri, lies the church of S.\r\nDomenico, which marks the site of the villa in which Cicero was born and\r\nfrequently resided. Near it is an ancient bridge, of a road which\r\ncrossed the Liris to Cereatae (modern Casamari). The painter Giuseppe\r\nCesari (1560-1640), more often known as the Cavaliere d' Arpino, was\r\nalso born here.\r\n\r\n  See O.E. Schmidt, _Arpinum, eine topographisch-historische Skizze_\r\n  (Meissen, 1900).     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARQUA PETRARCA, a village of Venetia, Italy, in the province of Padua, 3\r\nm. to the S.W. of Battaglia. Pop. (1901) 1573. It is chiefly famous as\r\nthe place where Petrarch lived his last few years and died in 1374. His\r\nhouse still exists, and his tomb, a sarcophagus supported by four short\r\ncolumns of red marble, stands in front of the church. Near Arqua, on the\r\nbanks of the small Lago della Costa, is the site of a prehistoric lake\r\nvillage, excavations in which have produced interesting results.\r\n\r\n  See A. Moschetti and F. Cordenone in _Bollettino del Museo Civico di\r\n  Padova_, iv. (1901), 102 seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARQUEBUS (also called harquebus, hackbut, &c.), a firearm of the 16th\r\ncentury, the immediate predecessor of the musket. The word itself is\r\ncertainly to be derived from the German Hakenbuhse (mod. Hakenbuchse,\r\ncf. Eng. _hackbut_ and _hackbush_), \"hook gun.\" The \"hook\" is often\r\nsupposed to refer to the bent shape of the butt, which differentiated it\r\nfrom the straight-stocked hand gun, but it has also been suggested that\r\nthe original arquebus had a metal hook near the muzzle, which was used\r\nto grip the wall (or other fixed object) so as to steady the aim and\r\ntake up the force of recoil, that from this the name _Hakenbuhse_\r\nspread till it became the generic name for small arms, and that the\r\noriginal form of the weapon then took the name of _arquebus a croc_. The\r\nFrench form _arquebuse_ and Italian _arcobugio_, _archibugio_, often and\r\nwrongly supposed to indicate the hackbut's affinity with the crossbow\r\n(\"hollow bow\" or \"mouthed bow\"), are popular corruptions, the Italian\r\nbeing apparently the earlier of the two and supplanting the first and\r\npurest French form _haquebut_. Previous to the French wars in Italy,\r\nhand-gun men and even arbalisters seem to have been called arquebusiers,\r\nbut in the course of these wars the arquebus or hackbut came into\r\nprominence as a distinct type of weapon. The Spanish arquebusiers, who\r\nused it with the greatest effect in the Italian wars, notably at Bicocca\r\n(1522) and Pavia (1525), are the originators of modern infantry fire\r\naction. Filippo Strozzi made many improvements in the arquebus about\r\n1530, and his weapons were effective up to four and five hundred paces.\r\nHe also standardized the calibres of the arquebuses of the French army,\r\nand from this characteristic feature of the improved weapon arose the\r\nEnglish term \"caliver.\" In the latter part of the 16th century (c. 1570)\r\nthe arquebus began to be displaced by the musket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARQUES-LA-BATAILLE, a village of France, in the department of\r\nSeine-Inferieure, 4 m. S.E. of Dieppe by the Western railway. Pop.\r\n(1906) 1250. Arques is situated near the confluence of the rivers\r\nVarenne and Bethune; the forest of Arques stretches to the north-east.\r\nThe interest of the place centres in the castle dominating the town,\r\nwhich was built in the 11th century by William of Arques; his nephew,\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, regarding it as a menace to his own power,\r\nbesieged and occupied it. After frequently changing hands, it came into\r\nthe possession of the English, who were expelled in 1449 after an\r\noccupation of thirty years. In 1589 its cannon decided the battle of\r\nArques in favour of Henry IV. Since 1869 the castle has been state\r\nproperty. The first line of fortification was the work of Francis I.;\r\nthe second line and the donjon date back to the 11th century. The church\r\nof Arques, a building of the 16th century, preserves a fine stone rood\r\nscreen, statuary, stained glass and other relics of the Renaissance\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRACK, RACK or RAK, a generic name applied to a variety of spirituous\r\nliquors distilled in the Far East. According to some authorities the\r\nword is derived from the Arabic _arak_ (perspiration), but according to\r\nothers (see Morewood's _History of Inebriating Liquors_, 1834, p. 140)\r\nit is derived from the _areca-nut_, a material from which a variety of\r\narrack was long manufactured, and is of Indian origin. The liquor to\r\nwhich this or a similar name is applied is (or was, since the\r\nintroduction of European spirits and methods of manufacture is gradually\r\ncausing the native spirit industries on the old lines to decay)\r\nmanufactured in India, Ceylon, Siam, Java, Batavia, China, Corea, &c.,\r\nand its manufacture still constitutes a considerable industry. The term\r\narrack as designating a distilled liquor does not, however, appear to\r\nhave been confined to the Far East, as, in Timkowski's _Travels_, it is\r\nstated that a spirit distilled from koumiss (q.v.) by the Tatars,\r\nMongols and presumably the Caucasian races generally, is called _arrack,\r\naraka or ariki_. In Ceylon arrack is distilled chiefly from palm toddy,\r\nwhich is the fermented juice drawn from the unexpanded flower-spathes of\r\nvarious palms, such as the Palmyra palm (_Borassus flabelliformis_) and\r\nthe cocoa palm (_Cocos nucifera_). At the beginning of the 19th century\r\nthe arrack industry of Ceylon was of considerable dimensions, whole\r\nwoods being set apart for no other purpose than that of procuring toddy,\r\nand the distillation of the spirit took place at every village round the\r\ncoast. The land rents in 1831 included a sum of L35,573 on the cocoa-nut\r\ntrees, and the duties on the manufacture and retail of the spirit\r\namounted to over L30,000. On the Indian continent arrack is made from\r\npalm toddy, rice and the refuse of the sugar refineries, but mainly from\r\nthe flowers of the muohwa or mahua tree (_Bassia latifolia_). The mahua\r\nflowers are very rich in sugar, and may, according to H.H. Mann, contain\r\nas much as 58% of fermentable sugar, calculated on the total solids.\r\nEven at the present day the process of manufacture is very primitive,\r\nthe fermentation as a rule being carried on in so concentrated a liquid\r\nthat complete fermentation rarely takes place. According to Mann, the\r\ntotal sugar in the liquor ready for fermentation may reach 20%. The\r\nferment employed (it is so impure that it can scarcely be called yeast)\r\nis obtained from a previous fermentation, and, as the latter is never\r\nvigorous, it is not surprising that the resulting spirit contains,\r\ncompared with the more scientifically prepared European spirits, a very\r\nhigh proportion of by-products (acid, fusel oil, &c.). The injurious\r\nnature of these native spirits has long been known and has been\r\nfrequently set down to the admixture of drugs, such as hemp (_ganga_),\r\nbut a recent investigation of this question appears to show that this is\r\nnot generally the case. The chemical constitution of these liquors alone\r\naffords sufficient proof of their inferior and probably injurious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n  See H.H. Mann, _The Analyst_ (1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAH, a town of British India, headquarters of Shahabad district, in\r\nthe Patna division of Bengal, situated on a navigable canal connecting\r\nthe river Sone with the Ganges. It is a station on the East Indian\r\nrailway, 368 m. from Calcutta. In 1901 the population was 40,170. Arrah\r\nis famous for an incident in the Mutiny, when a dozen Englishmen, with\r\n50 Sikhs, defended an ordinary house against 2000 Sepoys and a multitude\r\nof armed insurgents, perhaps four times that number. A British regiment,\r\ndespatched to their assistance from Dinapur, was disastrously repulsed;\r\nbut they were ultimately relieved, after eight days' continuous\r\nfighting, by a small force under Major (afterwards Sir Vincent) Eyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAIGNMENT (from Lat. _ad_, to, and _rationare_, to reason, call to\r\naccount), a law term, properly denoting the calling of a person to\r\nanswer in form of law upon an indictment. After a true bill has been\r\nfound against a prisoner by the grand jury, he is called by name to the\r\nbar, the indictment is read over to him, and he is asked whether he be\r\nguilty or not of the offence charged. This is the arraignment. Formerly,\r\nit was usual to require the prisoner to hold up his hand, in order to\r\nidentify him the more completely, but this practice is now obsolete, as\r\nwell as that of asking him how he will be tried. His plea in answer to\r\nthe charge is then entered, or a plea of not guilty is entered for him\r\nif he stands mute of malice and refuses to plead, If a person is mute by\r\nthe visitation of God (i.e. deaf and dumb), it will be no bar to an\r\narraignment if intelligence can be conveyed to him by signs or symbols.\r\nIf he pleads guilty, sentence may be passed forthwith; if he pleads not\r\nguilty, he is then given in charge to a jury of twelve men to inquire\r\ninto the truth of the indictment. He may also plead in abatement, or to\r\nthe jurisdiction, or demur on a point of law. Several defendants, except\r\nthose entitled to the privilege of peerage, charged on the same\r\nindictment, are arraigned together.\r\n\r\nIn Scots law the term for arraignment is _calling the diet_.\r\n\r\nThe _Clerk of Arraigns_ is a subordinate officer attached to assize\r\ncourts and to the Old Bailey. He is appointed by the clerk of assize\r\n(see ASSIZE) and acts as his deputy. He assists at the arraignment of\r\nprisoners, and puts the formal questions to the jury when delivering\r\ntheir verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAN, EARLS OF. The extinct Scottish title of the earls of Arran (not\r\nto be confused with the modern Irish earls of Arran--from the Arran or\r\nAran Islands, Galway--a title created in 1762) was borne by some famous\r\ncharacters in Scottish history. Except the first earl, Thomas Boyd (see\r\nARRAN), and James Stewart, all the holders of this title were members of\r\nthe Hamilton family.\r\n\r\nJAMES HAMILTON, 1st earl of Arran of the new creation (c. 1475-1529),\r\nson of James, 1st Lord Hamilton, and of Mary Stewart, daughter of James\r\nII. of Scotland, was born about 1475, and succeeded in 1479 to his\r\nfather's titles and estates. In 1489 he was made sheriff of Lanark, was\r\nappointed a privy councillor to James IV., and in 1503 negotiated in\r\nEngland the marriage between the king and Margaret Tudor. Hamilton\r\nexcelled in the knightly exercises of the day, and the same year on the\r\n11th of August, after distinguishing himself in a famous tournament, he\r\nwas created earl and justiciary of Arran. In 1504 as lieutenant-general\r\nof the realm he was employed in reducing the Hebrides, and about the\r\nsame time in an expedition with 10,000 men in aid of John, king of\r\nDenmark. In 1507 he was sent ambassador to France, and on his return\r\nthrough England was seized and imprisoned by Henry VII. After the\r\naccession of Henry VIII., Arran, in 1509, signed the treaty of peace\r\nbetween the two countries, and later, when hostilities began, was given\r\ncommand of a great fleet equipped for the aid of France in 1513. The\r\nexpedition proved a failure, Arran wasting time by a useless attack on\r\nCarrickfergus, lingering for months on the Scottish coast, and returning\r\nwith a mere remnant of his fleet, the larger ships having probably been\r\npurchased by the French government. During his absence the battle of\r\nFlodden had been lost, and Arran found his rival Angus, who enjoyed\r\nHenry's support, married to the queen dowager and in control of the\r\ngovernment. Arran naturally turned to the French party and supported the\r\nregency of the duke of Albany. Later, however, becoming impatient of the\r\nlatter's monopoly of power, he entered into various plots against him,\r\nand on Albany's departure in 1517 he was chosen president of the council\r\nof regency and provost of Edinburgh. The same year he led an expedition\r\nto the border to punish the murderers of the French knight La Bastie. In\r\nSeptember, however, after a temporary absence with the young king, the\r\ngates of Edinburgh were shut against him by the Douglases, and on the\r\n30th of April 1520 the fierce fight of \"Cleanse the Causeway\" took place\r\nin the streets between the two factions, in which the Hamiltons were\r\nworsted. The quarrel, however, between Angus and his wife, the\r\nqueen-mother, with whom Arran now allied himself, gave the latter\r\nanother opportunity of regaining power, which he held from 1522, after\r\nAlbany's return to France, till 1524, when he was forced to include\r\nAngus in the government. In 1526, on the refusal of the latter to give\r\nup his control of the king on the expiry of his term of office, Arran\r\ntook up arms, but retreated before Angus's forces, and having made terms\r\nwith him, supported him in his close custody of the king, in September\r\ndefeating the earl of Lennox, who was marching to Edinburgh to liberate\r\nJames. On the proscription of Angus and the Douglases, Arran joined the\r\nking at Stirling. He died in 1529. His eldest son James succeeded him.\r\n\r\nJAMES HAMILTON, 2nd earl of Arran and duke of Chatelherault (c.\r\n1515-1575), accompanied James V. in 1536 to France, and on the latter's\r\ndeath in 1542 was, in consequence of his position as next successor to\r\nthe throne after the infant Mary, proclaimed protector of the realm and\r\nheir-presumptive of the crown, in 1543. He was a zealous supporter of\r\nthe reformation, authorized the translation and reading of the\r\nScriptures in the vulgar tongue, and at first supported the English\r\npolicy in opposition to Cardinal Beaton, whom he arrested on the 27th of\r\nJanuary 1543, arranging the treaty with England and the marriage of Mary\r\nwith Prince Edward in July, and being offered by Henry the hand of the\r\nprincess Elizabeth for his son. But on the 3rd of September he suddenly\r\njoined the French party, met Beaton at Stirling, and abjured his\r\nreligion for Roman Catholicism. On the 13th of January 1544, with Angus,\r\nLennox and others, he signed a bond repudiating the English alliance. In\r\n1544 an attempt was made to transfer the regency from him to Mary of\r\nLorraine, but Arran fortified Edinburgh and her forces retired; in March\r\n1545 a truce was arranged by which each had a share in the government.\r\nMeanwhile, immediately on the repudiation of the treaty, war had broken\r\nout with England, and Arran was unable either to maintain order within\r\nthe realm or defend it from outside aggression, the Scots being defeated\r\nat Pinkie on the 10th of September 1547. He reluctantly agreed in July\r\n1548 to the marriage of the dauphin with Mary, whom he had designed for\r\nhis son, to the appeal for French aid, and to the removal of Mary for\r\nsecurity to France, and on the 5th of February 1549 was created duke of\r\nChatelherault in Poitou, his eldest son James being henceforth commonly\r\nstyled earl of Arran. In June 1548 he had also been made a knight of the\r\norder of St Michael in France. On the 12th of April 1554 he abdicated in\r\nfavour of the queen-mother, whose government he supported till after the\r\ncapture of Edinburgh in October 1559 by the lords of the congregation,\r\nwhen he declared himself on their side and took the Covenant. The same\r\nmonth he was one of the council of the Protestant lords, joined them in\r\nsuspending Mary of Lorraine from the regency, and was made provisionally\r\none of the governors of the kingdom. In order to discredit him with the\r\nEnglish government a letter was forged by his enemies, in which Arran\r\ndeclared his allegiance to Francis II., but the plot was exposed. On the\r\n27th of February 1560 he agreed to the treaty of Berwick with Elizabeth,\r\nwhich placed Scotland under her protection. The death the same year of\r\nFrancis II. renewed his hopes of a union between his son and Mary, but\r\ndisappointment drove him into an attitude of hostility to the court. In\r\n1562 he was accused by his son, probably already insane, of plots\r\nagainst Mary's person, and he was obliged to give up Dumbarton Castle.\r\nLennox claimed precedence over Arran in the succession to the throne, on\r\nthe plea of the latter's supposed illegitimacy, and his restoration to\r\nfavour in 1564, together with the project of Mary's marriage with\r\nDarnley, still further embittered Arran; he refused to appear at court,\r\nwas declared a traitor, and fled to England, where on his consent to go\r\ninto exile for five years he received a pardon from Mary. In 1566 he\r\nwent to France, where he made vain attempts to regain his confiscated\r\nduchy. After the murder of Darnley in 1567 he was nominated by Mary on\r\nher abdication one of the regents, and he returned to Scotland in 1569\r\nas a strong supporter of her cause. In March in an assembly of nobles\r\ncalled by Murray, he acknowledged James as king, but on the 5th of April\r\nhe was arrested for not fulfilling the compact, and continued in\r\nconfinement till April 1570. After Murray's assassination in January\r\n1570, the regency in July was given to Lennox, and in June 1571 Arran\r\nassembled a parliament, when it was declared that Mary's abdication was\r\nobtained by fear, and the king's coronation was annulled. On the 28th of\r\nAugust he was declared a traitor and \"forfeited,\" but he continued to\r\nsupport Mary's hopeless cause and to appeal for help to France and\r\nSpain, in spite of the pillage of his houses and estates, till February\r\n1573, when he acknowledged James's authority and laid down his arms. He\r\ndied on the 22nd of January 1575. He was by general consent a weak,\r\nfickle man, whose birth alone called him to high office. He married\r\nMargaret, daughter of James Douglas, 3rd earl of Morton, and had,\r\nbesides several daughters, four sons: James, who succeeded him as 3rd\r\nearl of Arran, John, 1st marquess of Hamilton, David, and Claud, Lord\r\nPaisley, ancestor of the dukes of Abercorn.\r\n\r\nJAMES HAMILTON, 3rd earl (c. 1537-1609), was styled earl of Arran after\r\nthe creation of his father as duke of Chatelherault in 1549; the latter\r\ntitle did not descend to him, having been resumed by the French crown.\r\nHis father's ambition destined him for the hand of Mary queen of Scots,\r\nand his union with the princess Elizabeth was proposed by Henry VIII. as\r\nthe price of his father's adherence to the English interest. He was\r\nearly involved in the political troubles in which Scotland was then\r\nimmersed. In 1546 he was seized as a hostage at St Andrews by the\r\nmurderers of Cardinal Beaton and released in 1547. In 1550 he went to\r\nFrance, was given the command of the Scots guards, and in 1557\r\ndistinguished himself in the defence of St Quentin. He became a strong\r\nadherent of the reformed doctrine. His arrest was ordered by Henry II.\r\nin 1559, Mary (probably in consequence of his projected union with\r\nElizabeth which would have raised the Hamiltons higher than the Stuarts)\r\ndeclaring her wish that he should be \"used as an arrant traitor.\" He,\r\nhowever, escaped to Geneva and then to England, and had an interview\r\nwith Elizabeth in August. He returned to Scotland in September, where he\r\nsupported his father's adherence to the lords of the Congregation\r\nagainst Mary of Lorraine, upheld the alliance with Elizabeth, and became\r\none of the leaders of the Protestant party in the subsequent fighting,\r\nin particular organizing, together with Lord James Stuart (afterwards\r\nearl of Murray), in 1560, a stubborn resistance to the French at Dysart,\r\nand saving Fife. In November 1559 he had declined Bothwell's challenge\r\nto single combat. Subsequently he signed the treaty of Berwick, became\r\none of the lords of the Congregation, and was appointed a visitor for\r\nthe destruction of the religious houses. The same year proposals were\r\nagain made for his marriage with Elizabeth, which were rejected by the\r\nlatter in 1561; and subsequently after the death of Francis II. (in\r\nDecember 1560), he became, with the strong support of the Protestants\r\nand Hamiltons, a suitor for Mary, also without success. He was chosen a\r\nmember of her council on her arrival in Scotland in 1561, but took up a\r\nhostile attitude to the court in consequence of the practice of the\r\nRoman Catholic religion. He now showed marked signs of insanity, and was\r\nconfined in Edinburgh Castle, where he remained till May 1566. He had\r\nthen lost the power of speech, and from 1568 he lived in retirement with\r\nhis mother at Craignethan Castle, while his estates were administered by\r\nhis brother John, afterwards 1st marquess of Hamilton. In 1579, at the\r\ntime of the fresh prosecution of the Hamiltons, when the helpless Arran\r\nwas also included in the attainder of his brothers and his titles\r\nforfeited, the castle was besieged on the pretence of delivering him\r\nfrom unlawful confinement, and Arran and his mother were brought to\r\nLinlithgow, while the charge of his estates was taken over by the\r\ngovernment. In 1580 James Stewart (see below) was appointed his\r\nguardian, and in 1581 acquired the earldom; but his title and estates\r\nwere restored after Stewart's disgrace in 1586, when the forfeiture was\r\nrepealed. Arran died unmarried in March 1609, the title devolving on his\r\nnephew James, 2nd marquess of Hamilton.\r\n\r\nJAMES STEWART (d. 1595), the rival earl of Arran above referred to, was\r\nthe son of Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree. He served in his youth\r\nwith the Dutch forces in Holland against the Spanish, and returned to\r\nScotland in 1579. He immediately became a favourite of the young king,\r\nand in 1580 was made gentleman of the bedchamber and tutor of his\r\ncousin, the 3rd earl of Arran. The same year he was the principal\r\naccuser of the earl of Morton, and in 1581 was rewarded for having\r\naccomplished the latter's destruction by being appointed a member of the\r\nprivy council, and by the grant the same year, to the prejudice of his\r\nward, of the earldom of Arran and the Hamilton estates, on the pretence\r\nthat the children of his grandmother's father, the 1st earl of Arran, by\r\nhis third wife, from whom sprang the succeeding earls of Arran, were\r\nillegitimate. He claimed the position of second person in the kingdom as\r\nnearest to the king by descent. The same year he married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of John Stewart, earl of Atholl, and wife of the earl of March,\r\nafter both had been compelled to undergo the discipline of the kirk on\r\naccount of previous illicit intercourse. He became the rival of Lennox\r\nfor the chief power in the kingdom, but both were deprived of office by\r\nthe raid of Ruthven on the 22nd of August 1582, and Arran was imprisoned\r\ntill September under the charge of the earl of Gowrie. In 1583, however,\r\nhe assembled a force of 12,000 men against the new government; the\r\nProtestant lords escaped over the border, and Arran, returning to power,\r\nwas made governor of Stirling Castle and in 1584 lord chancellor. The\r\nsame year Gowrie was captured through Arran's treachery and executed\r\nafter the failure of the plot of the Protestant lords against the\r\nlatter's government. He now obtained the governorship of Edinburgh\r\nCastle and was made provost of the city and lieutenant-general of the\r\nking's forces. Arran induced the English government to refrain from\r\naiding the banished lords, and further secured his power by the\r\nforfeitures of his opponents. His tyranny and insolence, however,\r\nstirred up a multitude of enemies and caused his rapid fall from power.\r\nHis agent in England, Patrick, Master of Gray, was secretly conspiring\r\nagainst him at Elizabeth's court. On account of the murder of Lord\r\nRussell on the border in July 1585, of which he was accused by\r\nElizabeth, he was imprisoned at the castle of St Andrews, and\r\nsubsequently the banished lords with Elizabeth's support entered\r\nScotland, seized the government and proclaimed Arran a traitor. He fled\r\nin November, and from this time his movements are furtive and uncertain.\r\nIn 1586 he was ordered to leave the country, but it is doubtful whether\r\nhe ever quitted Scotland. He contrived secretly to maintain friendly\r\ncommunications with James, and in 1592 returned to Edinburgh, and\r\nendeavoured unsuccessfully to get reinstated in the court and kirk.\r\nSubsequently he is reported as making a voyage to Spain, probably in\r\nconnexion with James's intrigues with that country. His unscrupulous and\r\nadventurous career was finally terminated towards the close of 1595 by\r\nhis assassination near Symontown in Lanarkshire at the hands of Sir\r\nJames Douglas (nephew of his victim the earl of Morton), who carried his\r\nhead in triumph on the point of a spear through the country, while his\r\nbody was left a prey to the dogs and swine. He had three sons, the\r\neldest of whom became Lord Ochiltree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAN, the largest island of the county of Bute, Scotland, at the mouth\r\nof the Firth of Clyde. Its greatest length, from the Cock of Arran to\r\nBennan Head, is about 20 m., and the greatest breadth--from Drumadoon\r\nPoint to King's Cross Point--is 11 m. Its area is 105,814 acres or 165\r\nsq. m. In 1891 its population was 4824, in 1901, 4819 (or 29 persons to\r\nthe sq. m.). In 1901 there were 1900 persons who spoke English and\r\nGaelic and nine Gaelic only. There is daily winter communication with\r\nBrodick and Lamlash by steamer from Ardrossan, and in summer by many\r\nsteamers which call not only at these piers, but at Corrie, Whiting Bay\r\nand Loch Ranza.\r\n\r\nThe chief mountains are in the north. The highest is Goatfell (2866 ft.,\r\nthe name said to be a corruption of the Gaelic _Goadh Bhein_, \"mountain\r\nof the winds\"). Others are Caistel Abhail (2735 ft., \"peaks of the\r\ncastles\"), Beinn Tarsuinn (2706 ft.), Cir Mhor (2618 ft.) and Beinn Nuis\r\n(2597 ft.). In the south Tighvein (1497 ft.) and Cnoc Dubh (1385 ft.)\r\nare the most important. Owing to the mountainous character of the\r\nisland, glens are numerous. Glen Rosa and Glen Sannox are remarkable for\r\ntheir wild beauty, and among others are Iorsa, Catacol, Chalmadale,\r\nCloy, Shant, Shurig, Tuie, Clachan, Monamore, Ashdale (with two\r\ncascades) and Scorrodale. Excepting Loch Tanna, the inland lakes are\r\nsmall. Loch Ranza, an arm of the sea, is one of the most beautiful in\r\nScotland. The streams, or \"waters\" as they are called, are nearly all\r\nhill burns, affording good fishing.\r\n\r\nThe oldest rocks, consisting of slate, mica-schists and grits, which\r\nhave been correlated with the metamorphic series of the eastern\r\nHighlands, form an incomplete ring round the granite in the north of the\r\nisland and occupy the whole of the west coast from Loch Ranza south to\r\nDougrie. On the east side in North Glen Sannox Burn, they are associated\r\nwith cherts, grits and dark schists with pillowy lavas, tuffs and\r\nagglomerates which, on lithological grounds, have been regarded as\r\nprobably of the same age as the Arenig cherts and volcanic rocks in the\r\nsouth of Scotland. The Lower Old Red Sandstone strata are separated from\r\nthe foregoing series by a fault and forma curving belt extending from\r\nCorloch on the east coast south by Brodick Castle to Dougrie on the west\r\nshore. Consisting of red sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates, they\r\nare inclined at high angles usually away from the granite massif and the\r\nencircling metamorphic rocks. They are associated with a thin band of\r\nlava visible on the west side of the island near Auchencar and traceable\r\ninland to Garbh Thorr. The Upper Old Red Sandstone, composed of red\r\nsandstone and conglomerates, is only sparingly developed. The strata\r\noccur on the east shore between the Fallen Rocks and Corrie, and they\r\nappear along a narrow strip to the east and south of the lower division\r\nof the system, between Sannox Bay and Dougrie. On the north side of\r\nNorth Glen Sannox they rest unconformably on the Lower Old Red rocks.\r\nContemporaneous lavas, highly decomposed, are intercalated with this\r\ndivision on the north side of North Glen Sannox where the band is highly\r\nfaulted. The Carboniferous rocks of Arran include representatives of the\r\nCalciferous Sandstone, the three subdivisions of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series, and to a small extent the Coal Measures, and are\r\nconfined to the north part of the island. They appear on the east coast\r\nbetween the Fallen Rocks and the Cock of Arran, where they form a strip\r\nabout a quarter of a mile broad, bounded on the west by a fault. Here\r\nthere is an ascending sequence from the Calciferous Sandstone, through\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone with thin coals formerly worked, to the Coal\r\nMeasures, the strata being inclined at high angles to the north. On the\r\nsouth side of a well-marked anticline in the Upper Old Red Sandstone at\r\nNorth Sannox, the Carboniferous strata reappear on the coast with a\r\nsouth dip showing a similar ascending sequence for about half a mile.\r\nThe lower limestones are well seen at Corrie, but the thin coals are not\r\nthere represented. From Corrie they can be traced southwards and inland\r\nto near the head of Ben Lister Glen. The small development of Upper\r\nCarboniferous strata, visible on the shore south of Corrie and in Ben\r\nLister Glen, consists of sandstones, red and mottled clays and purple\r\nshales, which yield plant-remains of Upper Carboniferous facies. These\r\nmay represent partly the Millstone Grit and partly the Coal Measures.\r\nContemporaneous volcanic rocks, belonging to three stages of the\r\nCarboniferous formation, occur in Arran. The lowest group is on the\r\nhorizon of the Calciferous Sandstone series, being visible at Corrie\r\nwhere it underlies the Corrie limestone, and is traceable southwards\r\nbeyond Brodick. The second is represented by a thin lava, associated\r\nwith the Upper Limestone group of the Carboniferous Limestone series,\r\nand the highest is found in Ben Lister Glen intercalated with the Upper\r\nCarboniferous strata, and may be the equivalent of the volcanic series\r\nwhich, in Ayrshire, occupies the position of the Millstone Grit. The\r\nTriassic rocks are arranged in two groups, a lower, composed of\r\nconglomerates and sandstones, and an upper one consisting of red and\r\nmottled shales and marls with thin sandstones and nodular limestones. In\r\nthe extreme north at the Cock of Arran, there is a small development of\r\nthese beds; they also occupy the whole of the east coast south of\r\nCorrie, and they spread over the south part of the island south of a\r\nline between Brodick Bay and Machrie Bay on the west. At Corrie and the\r\nCock of Arran they rest on Upper Carboniferous strata; in Ben Lister\r\nGlen, on the lower limestone group of the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nseries; and on the west coast they repose on the Old Red Sandstone.\r\nThere is, therefore, a clear discordance between the Trias and all older\r\nstrata in Arran. The former extension of Rhaetic, Liassic and Cretaceous\r\nformations in the island is indicated by the presence of fragments of\r\nthese strata in a large volcanic vent on the plateau, on the south side\r\nof the road leading from Brodick to Shiskine. The fossils from the\r\nRhaetic beds belong to the _Avicula contorta_ zone, those from the Lias\r\nto the _Ammonites angulatus_ zone, while the blocks of limestone with\r\nchert contain _Inoceramus_, Cretaceous foraminifera and other organisms.\r\nThe materials yielding these fossils are embedded in a course volcanic\r\nagglomerate which gives rise to crags and is pierced by acid and basic\r\nigneous rocks. One of the striking features in the geology of Arran is\r\nthe remarkable series of intrusive igneous rocks of Tertiary age which\r\noccupy nearly one-half of the area and form the wildest and grandest\r\nscenery in the island. Of these the most important is the great oval\r\nmass of granite in the North, composed of two varieties; one,\r\ncoarse-grained and older, forms the outside rim, while the fine-grained\r\nand newer type occurs in the interior. Another granite area appears on\r\nthe south side of the road between Brodick and Shiskine, where it is\r\nassociated with granophyre and quartz-diorite and traverses the volcanic\r\nvent of post-Cretaceous or Tertiary age already described. In the south\r\nof the island there are sills and dykes of felsite, quartz-porphyry,\r\nrhyolite, trachyte and pitchstone. The felsite sheets are well\r\nrepresented in Holy Island. It is worthy of note that the dykes and\r\nsheets of felsite are seldom pierced by the basalt dykes and are\r\nprobably about the most recent of the intrusive rocks. The best example\r\nof the basic sills forms the Clauchland Hills and runs out to sea at\r\nClauchland Point. Finally the basic dykes of dolerite, basalt and\r\naugite-andesite are abundant and traverse the various sedimentary\r\nformations and the granite.\r\n\r\nThe chief crops are oats and potatoes. Cattle and sheep are raised in\r\nconsiderable numbers. The game, which is abundant, consisting of\r\nblackcock and grouse, is strictly preserved. A few red deer still occur\r\nin the wilder hilly district. The fisheries are of some value. Loch\r\nRanza being an important station.\r\n\r\nStanding stones, cairns and other memorials of a remote antiquity occur\r\nnear Tormore, on Machrie Bay, Lamlash, and other places. The Norse\r\nraiders found a home in Arran for a long period until the defeat of\r\nHaakon V. at Largs (1263) compelled them to retire. The chief name in\r\nthe island's history is that of Robert Bruce, who found shelter in the\r\nKing's Caves on the western coast. One was reputed to be his kitchen,\r\nanother his cellar, a third his stable, while the hill above was styled\r\nthe King's Hill. From a point still known as King's Cross he crossed\r\nover to Carrick, in answer to the signal which warned him that the\r\nmoment for the supreme effort for his country was come. In Glen Cloy the\r\nruins of a fort bear the name of Bruce's Castle, in which his men lay\r\nconcealed, and on the southern arm of Loch Ranza stands a picturesque\r\nruined castle which is said to have been his hunting-seat. Kildonan\r\nCastle, near the south-easternmost point, is a fine ruin of the 14th\r\ncentury, once a royal stronghold. The island gave the title of earl to\r\nThomas Boyd, who married the elder sister of James III., a step so\r\nunpopular with his peers that he had to fly the country, and the title\r\nsoon afterwards passed to the Hamiltons. Brodick Castle, the ancestral\r\nseat of the dukes of Hamilton, is a splendid mansion on the northern\r\nshore of Brodick Bay.\r\n\r\nBrodick is the chief village in Arran, but most of the dwelling-houses\r\nhave been built at Invercloy, close to the pier. Three m. south (by\r\nroad) is Lamlash, on a fine bay so completely sheltered by Holy Island\r\nas to form an excellent harbour for ships of all sizes. Four m. to the\r\nnorth lies the village of Corrie which takes its name from a rugged\r\nhollow in the hill of Am Binnein (2172 ft.) which overshadows it. Daniel\r\nMacmillan (1813-1857), the founder of the publishing firm of Macmillan &\r\nCo., was a native of Corrie.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half east of Lamlash village lies Holy Island, which\r\nforms a natural breakwater to the bay. It is 1-3/4 m. long, nearly 3/4\r\nm. wide, and its finely-marked basaltic cone rises to a height of 1030\r\nft. The island takes its name from the fact that St Molios, a disciple\r\nof St Columba, founded a church near the north-western point. In the\r\nsaint's cave on the shore may be seen the rocky shelf on which he made\r\nhis bed, but his remains were interred in the hamlet of Clachan, some 2\r\nm. from Blackwaterfoot. Off the south-eastern coast, 3/4 m. from Port\r\nDearg, lies the pear-shaped isle of Pladda, which serves as the\r\ntelegraph station from which the arrival of vessels in the Clyde is\r\nnotified to Glasgow and Greenock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANT (a variant of \"errant,\" from Lat. _errare_, to wander), a word at\r\nfirst used in its original meaning of wandering, as in \"knight-errant,\"\r\nthus an arrant or itinerant preacher, an arrant thief, one outlawed and\r\nwandering at large; the meaning easily passed to that of self-declared,\r\nnotorious, and by the middle of the 16th century was confined, as an\r\nintensive adjective, to words of opprobrium and abuse, an arrant coward\r\nmeaning thus a self-declared, downright coward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS, a city of northern France, chief town of the department of\r\nPas-de-Calais, 38 m. N.N.E. of Amiens on the Northern railway between\r\nthat city and Lille. Pop (1906) 20,738. Arras is situated in a fertile\r\nplain on the right and southern bank of the Scarpe, at its junction with\r\nthe Crinchon which skirts the town on the south and east. Of the\r\nfortifications erected by Vauban in the 17th century, only a gateway and\r\nthe partially dismantled citadel, nicknamed _la Belle Inutile_, are\r\nleft. The most interesting quarter lies in the east of the town, where\r\nthe lofty houses which border the spacious squares known as the Grande\r\nand the Petite Place are in the Flemish style. They are built with their\r\nupper storeys projecting over the footway and supported on columns so as\r\nto form arcades; beneath these are deep cellars extending under the\r\nsquares themselves. The celebrated hotel de ville of the 16th century\r\noverlooks the Petite Place; its belfry, which contains a fine peal of\r\nbells, rises to a height of 240 ft. The decoration is in the richest\r\nGothic style, and is especially admirable in the case of the windows. Of\r\nthe numerous ecclesiastical buildings the cathedral, a church of the\r\n18th century possessing some good pictures, is the most important. It\r\noccupies the site of the church of the abbey of St Vaast, the buildings\r\nof which adjoin it and contain the bishop's palace, the ecclesiastical\r\nseminary, a museum of antiquities, paintings and sculptures, and a rich\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nArras is the seat of a prefect and of a bishop. It has tribunals of\r\nfirst instance and of commerce, a chamber of commerce, a branch of the\r\nBank of France, a communal college, training colleges, and a school of\r\nmilitary engineering. Its industrial establishments include oil-works,\r\ndye-works and breweries, and manufactories of hosiery, railings and\r\nother iron-work, and of oil-cake. For the tapestry manufacture formerly\r\nflourishing at Arras see TAPESTRY. It has a very important market for\r\ncereals and oleaginous grains. The trade of the town is facilitated by\r\nthe canalization of the Scarpe, the basin of which forms the port.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the Christian era Arras was known as _Nemetacum_,\r\nor _Nemetocenna_, and was the chief town of the Atrebates, from which\r\nthe word Arras is derived. Passing under the rule of the Romans, it\r\nbecame a place of some importance, and traces of the Roman occupation\r\nhave been found. In 407 it was destroyed by the Vandals, and having been\r\npartially rebuilt, came into the hands of the Franks. Christianity was\r\nintroduced by St Vedast (Vaast), who founded a bishopric at Arras about\r\n500. This was soon transferred to Cambrai, but brought back to its\r\noriginal seat about 1100. As the chief town of the province of Artois,\r\nArras passed to Baldwin I., count of Flanders, in 863, and about 880 was\r\nravaged by the Normans. During this troubled period it retained some\r\nvestiges of its former trade, and the woollen manufacture was\r\nestablished here at an early date. Early in the 12th century a commune\r\nwas established here, but the earliest known charter only dates from\r\nabout 1180; owing to the importance of Arras, this soon became a model\r\nfor many neighbouring communes. At this time the city appears to have\r\nbeen divided into two parts, one dependent upon the bishop, and the\r\nother upon the count. When Philip Augustus, king of France, married\r\nIsabella, niece of Philip, count of Flanders, Arras came under the rule\r\nof the French king, who confirmed its privileges in 1194. As part of\r\nArtois it came in 1237 to Robert, son of Louis VIII., king of France,\r\nand in 1384 to Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, who promised to\r\nrespect its privileges. Anxious to recover the city for France, Louis\r\nXI. placed a garrison therein after the death of Charles the Bold, duke\r\nof Burgundy, in 1477. This was driven out by the inhabitants, and Louis\r\nthen stormed Arras, razed the walls, deported the citizens, whose places\r\nwere taken by Frenchmen, and changed the name to _Franchise_. The\r\nsuccessor of Louis, Charles VIII., restored the city to its former name\r\nand position, and as part of the inheritance of Mary, daughter and\r\nheiress of Charles the Bold, it was contended for by the French king,\r\nand his rival, the German king, Maximilian I. The peace of Senlis in\r\n1493 gave Arras to Maximilian, and in spite of attacks by the French, it\r\nremained under the rule of the Habsburgs until 1640. Taken in this year\r\nby the French, this capture was ratified by the peace of the Pyrenees in\r\n1659, and henceforward it remained part of France. It suffered severely\r\nduring the French Revolution, especially from Joseph Lebon, who, like\r\nthe brothers Maximilien and Augustin Robespierre, was a native of the\r\ntown. Owing to its position and importance, Arras has been the scene of\r\nvarious treaties. In 1414 the peace between the Armagnacs and the\r\nBurgundians was made here, and in 1435 a congress met here to make peace\r\nbetween the English and their Burgundian allies on the one side, and the\r\nFrench on the other, and after the English representatives had\r\nwithdrawn, a treaty was signed on the 20th of September between France\r\nand Burgundy. In 1482 Louis XI. made a treaty here with the estates and\r\ntowns of Flanders about the inheritance of Mary of Burgundy, wife of the\r\nGerman king Maximilian I.\r\n\r\n  See E. Lecesne, _Histoire d'Arras jusqu'en 1789_ (Arras, 1880); _Arras\r\n  sous la Revolution_ (Arras, 1882-1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAY (from the O. Fr. _areyer_, Med. Lat. _arredare_, to get ready), an\r\norderly arrangement, particularly the drawing up of an army in position\r\nof battle. From the 13th century onwards in England \"Commissions of\r\nArray\" issued from the king for the levy of military forces (see\r\nMILITIA). In English law the term is used for the setting in order, name\r\nby name, of the panel of a jury, which may be challenged as a whole, \"to\r\nthe array,\" or individually, \"to the polls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRENOTOKOUS, ARRENOTOKY (from Gr. [Greek: arraen], male, and [Greek:\r\ntokos] from [Greek: tiktein], to beget), biological terms proposed by\r\nLeuckart and Eduard von Siebold to denote those parthenogenetic females\r\nwhich produce male young, while \"thelytokous\" and \"thelytoky\" would\r\ndenote their producing female young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARREST (Fr. _arrester, arreter_, to stop or stay), the restraint of a\r\nman's person, for the purpose of compelling him to be obedient to the\r\nlaw. It is defined to be the execution of the command of some court of\r\nrecord or officer of justice.\r\n\r\nArrests in England are either in civil or in criminal cases.\r\n\r\nI. _In Civil Cases._--The arrest must be by virtue of a precept or order\r\nout of some court, and must be effected by corporal seizing or touching\r\nthe defendant's body, or as directed by the writ, _capias et attachias_,\r\ntake and catch hold of. And if the defendant make his escape it is a\r\n_rescous_, or rescue, and attachment may be had against him, and the\r\nbailiff may then justify the breaking open of the house in which he is,\r\nto carry him away.\r\n\r\n_Arrests on mesne process_ (see PROCESS), before judgment obtained, were\r\nabolished by the Debtors Act 1869, s. 6; an exception, however, is made\r\nin cases in which the plaintiff proves, at any time before final\r\njudgment, by evidence on oath to the satisfaction of a judge of one of\r\nthe superior courts, that he has a good cause of action to the amount of\r\nL50, that the defendant is about to quit the country, and that his\r\nabsence will materially prejudice the plaintiff in prosecuting his\r\naction. In such cases an order for arrest may be obtained till security\r\nto the amount of the claim be found.\r\n\r\nFormerly a judgment creditor might arrest his debtor under a writ of\r\n_capias ad satisfaciendum_, but since 1869 imprisonment for debt has\r\nbeen abolished in England, except in certain cases, and in these the\r\nperiod of detention must not exceed one year.\r\n\r\nThe following persons are privileged from arrest, viz., 1st, members of\r\nthe royal family and the ordinary servants of the king or queen regnant,\r\nchaplains, lords of the bedchamber, &c. This privilege does not extend\r\nto servants of a consort queen or dowager. 2nd, peers of the realm,\r\npeeresses by birth, creation or marriage, Scottish and Irish peers and\r\npeeresses. 3rd, members of the House of Commons during the session of\r\nparliament, and for a convenient time (forty days) before and after it.\r\nMembers of Convocation appear to have the same privilege. 4th, foreign\r\nambassadors and their \"domestics and domestic servants.\" Temporary\r\nprivilege from arrest in civil process is enjoyed by barristers\r\ntravelling on circuit, by parties, witnesses or attorneys connected with\r\na cause, and by clergymen whilst performing divine service.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of any privileged person is irregular _ab initio_, and the\r\nparty may be discharged on motion. The only exception is as to\r\nindictable crimes, such as treason, felony and breach of the peace.\r\n\r\nThere are no longer any places where persons are privileged from arrest,\r\nsuch as the Mint, Savoy, Whitefriars, &c., on the ground of their being\r\nancient palaces.\r\n\r\nExcept in cases of treason, felony or breach of the peace, an arrest\r\ncannot be made on a Sunday, and if made it is void (Sunday Observance\r\nAct 1677); but it may be made in the night as well as in the day.\r\n\r\nII. _In Criminal Cases._--All persons whatsoever are, without\r\ndistinction, equally liable to this arrest, and any man may arrest\r\nwithout warrant or precept, and outer doors may be broken open for that\r\npurpose. The arrest may be made,--1st, by warrant; 2nd, by an officer\r\nwithout warrant; 3rd, by a private person without warrant; or, 4th, by a\r\nhue and cry.\r\n\r\n1. Warrants are ordinarily granted by justices of the peace on\r\ninformation or complaint in writing and upon oath, and they must be\r\nindorsed when it is intended they should be executed in another county\r\nby a magistrate of that county (see Indictable Offences Act 1848). A\r\nwarrant issued by a metropolitan police magistrate can be executed\r\nanywhere by a metropolitan police officer. Warrants are also granted in\r\ncases of treason or other offence affecting the government by the privy\r\ncouncil, or one of the secretaries of state, and also by the chief or\r\nother justice of the court of king's bench (_bench-warrant_) in cases of\r\nfelony, misdemeanour or indictment found, or criminal information\r\ngranted in that court. Every warrant ought to specify the offence\r\ncharged, the authority under which the arrest is to be made, the person\r\nwho is to execute it and the person who is to be arrested. A warrant\r\nremains in force till executed or discharged by order of a court. An\r\nofficer may break open doors in order to execute a warrant in cases of\r\ntreason, felony or indictable offences, provided that, on demand,\r\nadmittance cannot otherwise be obtained. (See WARRANT.)\r\n\r\n2. The officers who may arrest without warrant are,--justices of the\r\npeace, for felony or breach of the peace committed in their presence;\r\nthe sheriff and the coroner in their county, for felony; constables, for\r\ntreason, felony or breach of the peace committed in their view,--and\r\nwithin the metropolitan police district they have even larger powers\r\n(Metropolitan Police Acts 1829-1895).\r\n\r\n3. A private person is bound to arrest for a felony committed in his\r\npresence, under penalty of fine and imprisonment. By the Prevention of\r\nOffences Act 1851, a private person is allowed to arrest any one whom he\r\nfinds committing an indictable offence by night, and under the Malicious\r\nDamage Act 1861, any person committing an offence against that act may\r\nbe arrested without warrant by the owner of the property damaged, or his\r\nservants, or persons authorized by him. So, too, by the Coinage Offences\r\nAct 1861. s. 31, any person may arrest any one whom he shall find\r\ncommitting any offence relating to the coin, or other offence against\r\nthat act.\r\n\r\nA person arrested without warrant must not be detained in private\r\ncustody but must be taken with all convenient speed to a police station\r\nor justice and there charged (Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879).\r\n\r\n4. The arrest by hue and cry is where officers and private persons are\r\nconcerned in _pursuing_ felons, or such as have dangerously wounded\r\nothers. By the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881, provision was made for the\r\narrest in the United Kingdom of persons committing treason, and felony\r\nin any of the British colonies and vice versa; as to the arrest of\r\nfugitives in foreign countries see EXTRADITION.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for a wrongful arrest is by an action for false imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the law of arrest in criminal procedure has a general\r\nconstitutional analogy with that of England, though the practice differs\r\nwith the varying character of the judicatories. Colloquially the word\r\narrest is used in compulsory procedure for the recovery of debt; but the\r\ntechnical term applicable in that department is _caption_, and the law\r\non the subject is generically different from that of England. There\r\nnever was a practice in Scottish law corresponding with the English\r\narrest in mesne process; but by old custom a warrant for caption could\r\nbe obtained where a creditor made oath that he had reason to believe his\r\ndebtor meditated flight from the country, and the writ so issued is\r\ncalled a warrant against a person _in meditatione fugae_. Imprisonment\r\nof old followed on ecclesiastical cursing, and by fiction of law in\r\nlater times it was not the creditor's remedy, but the punishment of a\r\nrefractory person denounced rebel for disobedience to the injunctions of\r\nthe law requiring fulfilment of his obligation. The system was reformed\r\nand stripped of its cumbrous fictions by an act of the year 1837.\r\nAlthough the proceedings against the person could only follow on\r\ncompleted process, yet, by a peculiarity of the Scottish law, documents\r\nexecuted with certain formalities, and by special statute bills and\r\npromissory notes, can be registered in the records of a court for\r\nexecution against the person as if they were judgments of the court.\r\n\r\nThe general principles as to the law of arrest in most European\r\ncountries correspond more or less exactly to those prevailing in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAn _arrest of a ship_, which is the method of enforcing the admiralty\r\nprocess _in rem_, founded either on a maritime lien or on a claim\r\nagainst the ship, is dealt with under ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION.\r\n\r\nSee also article ATTACHMENT.\r\n\r\n_Arrest of Judgment_ is the assigning just reason why judgment should\r\nnot pass, notwithstanding verdict given, either in civil or in criminal\r\ncases, and from intrinsic causes arising on the face of the record.\r\n\r\n_United States._--The law of arrest assimilates to that existing in\r\nEngland. Actual manual touching is not necessary (_Pike_ v. _Hanson_, 9\r\nN.H. 491; _Hill_ v. _Taylor_, 50 Mich. 549); words of arrest by the\r\nofficer, not protested against and no resistance offered, are sufficient\r\n(_Emery_ v. _Chesley_, 18 N.H. 198; _Goodell_ v. _Tower_, 1904, 58 Am.\r\nRep. 790). Words of arrest, staying over night at prisoner's house,\r\ngoing with him before the magistrate next day constitute arrest\r\n(_Courtery_ v. _Dozier_, 20 Ga. 369). Restraining a person in his own\r\nhouse is arrest.\r\n\r\nIn civil cases in most of the states arrest for debt is abolished,\r\nexcept in cases of fraud or wilful injury to persons or property by\r\nconstitutional provision or by statute. One arrested under process of a\r\nfederal court cannot be arrested under that of a state court for the\r\nsame cause. There is no provision in the United States constitution as\r\nto imprisonment for debt, but congress has enacted (in Rev. Stat., s.\r\n990) that all the provisions of the law of any state applicable to such\r\nimprisonment shall apply to the process of federal courts in that state.\r\nA woman can be arrested in New York for wilful injury to person,\r\ncharacter or property, and in certain other cases (Code, s. 553). The\r\npresident, federal officials, governors of states, members of congress\r\nand of state legislatures (during the session), marines, soldiers and\r\nsailors on duty, voters while going to and from the polls, judges, court\r\nofficials (1904, 100 N.W. 591), coroners and jurors while attending upon\r\ntheir public duties, lawyers, parties and witnesses while going to,\r\nattending or returning from court, and generally married women without\r\nseparate property, are exempt from arrest.\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases a bench-warrant in New York may be served in any\r\ncounty without being backed by a magistrate (Code Crim. Proc., s. 304).\r\nIn Nebraska one found violating the law may be arrested and detained\r\nuntil a legal warrant can be issued (Crim. Code, s. 283). A bail may\r\nlawfully recapture his principal (1905) 121 Georgia Rep. 594. Foreign\r\nambassadors and ministers and their servants are exempt from arrest.\r\nExemption from arrest is a privilege, not of the court, as in England,\r\nbut of the person, and can be waived (_Petrie_ v. _Fitzgerald_, 1 Daly\r\n401).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRESTMENT, in Scots law, the process by which a creditor detains the\r\ngoods or effects of his debtor in the hands of third parties till the\r\ndebt due to him shall be paid. It is divided into two kinds: (1)\r\nArrestment in security, used when proceedings are commencing, or in\r\nother circumstances where a claim may become, but is not yet,\r\nenforceable; and (2) Arrestment in execution, following on the decree of\r\na court, or on a registered document, under a clause or statutory power\r\nof registration, according to the custom of Scotland. By the process of\r\narrestment the property covered is merely retained in place; to realize\r\nit for the satisfaction of the creditor's claim a further proceeding\r\ncalled \"furthcoming\" is necessary. By old practice, alimentary funds,\r\ni.e. those necessary for subsistence, were not liable to arrestment. By\r\nthe Wages Arrestment Limitation (Scotland) Act 1870, the wages of all\r\nlabourers, farm-servants, manufacturers, artificers and work-people are\r\nnot arrestable except (1) in so far as they exceed 20s. per week; but\r\nthe expense of the arrestment is not to be charged against the debtor\r\nunless the sum recovered exceed the amount of the said expense; or (2)\r\nunder decrees for alimentary allowances and payments, or for rates and\r\ntaxes imposed by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRETIUM (mod. _Arezzo_), an ancient city of Etruria, in the upper\r\nvalley of the Arno, situated on the Via Cassia, 50 m. S.E. of Florentia.\r\nThe site of the original city is not quite certain; some writers place\r\nit on the isolated hill called Poggio di S. Cornelio, 2-1/2 m. to the\r\nS.E., where remains of a fortified _enceinte_ still exist (cf. F. Noack\r\nin _Romische Mitteilungen_, 1897, p. 186); while others maintain, and\r\nprobably rightly, that it occupied the hill at the summit of the modern\r\ntown, where the medieval citadel (_fortezza_) was erected, and which was\r\nenclosed by an ancient wall. Numerous Etruscan tombs have been\r\ndiscovered within the lower portion of the area of the modern town,\r\nwhich appears to correspond in site with the Roman (_C.I.L._ xi. p.\r\n1082; G. Gamurrini in _Notizie degli scavi_, 1883, 262; 1887, 437).\r\nVitruvius (ii. 8. 9) and Pliny (_Nat. Hist._ xxxv. 173) speak of the\r\nstrength of its walls of bricks, but these have naturally disappeared.\r\nMany remains of Roman buildings have been discovered within the modern\r\ntown, and the amphitheatre is still visible in the southern angle.\r\nArretium appears as one of the cities which aided the Tarquins after\r\ntheir expulsion. It was an opponent of Rome at the end of the 4th and\r\nbeginning of the 3rd century B.C., but soon sought for help against the\r\nattacks of the Gauls, against whom it was almost a frontier fortress. It\r\nwas an important Roman base during the Hannibalic wars (though at one\r\ntime it threatened defection--Livy xxvii. 21-24), and in 205 B.C. was\r\nable to furnish Scipio with a considerable quantity of arms and\r\nprovisions (Livy xxviii. 45). In 187 B.C. the high road was extended as\r\nfar as Bononia. Arretium took the part of Marius against Sulla, and the\r\nlatter settled some of his veterans there as colonists. Caesar, or\r\nOctavian, added others, so that there are three classes, _Arretini\r\nveteres, Fidentiores_, and _Iulienses_. A considerable contingent from\r\nArretium joined Catiline and in 49 B.C. Caesar occupied it. C.\r\nMaecenas[1] was perhaps a native of Arretium. Its fertility was famous\r\nin ancient times, and still more the red pottery made of the local clay,\r\nwith its imitation of chased silver. The reliefs upon it are sometimes\r\nof considerable beauty, and large quantities of it, and the sites of\r\nseveral of the kilns, have been discovered in and near Arretium. It was\r\nalso considerably exported. See _Corp. Inscrip. Lat._ xi. (Berlin, 1901)\r\np. 1081, and _Notizie degli scavi, passim_ (especially, 1884, 369, for\r\nthe discovery of a fine group of the moulds from which these vases were\r\nmade). The museum contains a very fine collection of these and a good\r\ncollection of medieval majolica.     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The name Cilnius was apparently never borne by Maecenas himself,\r\n    though he is so described, e.g. by Tacitus, _Ann_. vi. II, cf.\r\n    Macrob. ii. 4, 12. The Cilnii with whom Maecenas was connected were a\r\n    noble Etruscan family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRHENIUS, SVANTE AUGUST (1859-   ), Swedish physicist and chemist, was\r\nborn on the 19th of February 1859, at Schloss Wijk, near Upsala. He\r\nstudied at Upsala from 1876 to 1881 and at Stockholm from 1881 to 1884,\r\nthen returning to Upsala as privat-docent in physical chemistry. He\r\nspent two years from 1886 to 1888 in travelling, and visited Riga\r\nPolytechnic and the universities of Wurzburg, Graz, Amsterdam and\r\nLeipzig. In 1891 he was appointed lecturer in physics at Stockholm and\r\nfour years later became full professor. Arrhenius is specially\r\nassociated with the development of the theory of electrolytic\r\ndissociation, and his great paper on the subject, _Recherches sur la\r\nconductibilite galvanique des electrolytes_--(1) _conductibilite\r\ngalvanique des solutions aqueuses extremement diluees_, (2) _theorie\r\nchimique des electrolytes_, was presented to the Stockholm Academy of\r\nSciences in 1883. He was subsequently continuously engaged in extending\r\nthe applications of the doctrine of electrolytic conduction in relation\r\nnot only to the problems of chemical action but also, on the supposition\r\nthat in certain conditions the air conducts electrolytically, to the\r\nphenomena of atmospheric electricity. In 1900 he published a _Larobok i\r\nteoretik elektrokemi_, which was translated into German and English, and\r\nhis _Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik_ appeared in 1903. In 1904 he\r\ndelivered at the university of California a course of lectures, the\r\nobject of which was to illustrate the application of the methods of\r\nphysical chemistry to the study of the theory of toxins and antitoxins,\r\nand which were published in 1907 under the title _Immunochemistry_. In\r\nhis _Worlds in the Making_ (1908), an English translation of _Das Werden\r\nder Welten_ (1907), he combated the generally accepted doctrine that the\r\nuniverse is tending to what Clausius termed _Warmetod_ through\r\nexhaustion of all sources of heat and motion, and suggested that by\r\nvirtue of a mechanism which maintains its available energy it is\r\nself-renovating, energy being \"degraded\" in bodies which are in the\r\nsolar state, but \"elevated\" or raised to a higher level in bodies which\r\nare in the nebular state. He further put forward the conception that\r\nlife is universally diffused, constantly emitted from all habitable\r\nworlds in the form of spores which traverse space for years or ages, the\r\nmajority being ultimately destroyed by the heat of some blazing star,\r\nbut some few finding a resting-place on bodies which have reached the\r\nhabitable stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIA, in Roman history, the heroic wife of Caecina Paetus. When her\r\nhusband was implicated in the conspiracy of Scribonianus against the\r\nemperor Claudius (A.D. 42), and condemned to death, she resolved not to\r\nsurvive him. She accordingly stabbed herself with a dagger, which she\r\nthen handed to him with the words, \"Paetus, it does not hurt\" (_Paete,\r\nnon dolet_; see Pliny, _Epp._ iii. 16; Martial i. 14; Dio Cassius lx.\r\n16). Her daughter, also called Arria, was the wife of Thrasea Paetus.\r\nWhen he was condemned to death by Nero, she would have imitated her\r\nmother's example, but was dissuaded by her husband, who entreated her to\r\nlive for the sake of their children. She was sent into banishment\r\n(Tacitus, _Annals_, xvi. 34).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIAN (FLAVIUS ARRIANUS), of Nicomedia in Bithynia, Greek historian and\r\nphilosopher, was born about A.D. 96, and lived during the reigns of\r\nHadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. In recognition of his\r\nabilities, he received the citizenship of both Athens and Rome. He was\r\ngreatly esteemed by Hadrian, who appointed him governor (_legatus_) of\r\nCappadocia (131-137), in which capacity he distinguished himself in a\r\ncampaign against the Alani. This is the only instance before the 3rd\r\ncentury in which a first-rate Roman military command was given to a\r\nGreek. Arrian spent a considerable portion of his time at Athens, where\r\nhe was archon 147-148. With his retirement or recall from Cappadocia his\r\nofficial career came to an end. In his declining years, he retired to\r\nhis native place, where he devoted himself to literary work. He died\r\nabout 180. His biography, by Dio Cassius, is lost.\r\n\r\nWhen young, Arrian was the pupil and friend of Epictetus, who had\r\nprobably withdrawn to Nicopolis, when Domitian expelled all philosophers\r\nfrom Rome. He took verbatim notes of his teacher's lectures, which he\r\nsubsequently published under the title of _The Dissertations_ ([Greek:\r\nDiatribai]), in eight books, of which the first four are extant and\r\nconstitute the chief authority for Stoic ethics, and _The Encheiridion_\r\n(i.e. Manual) _of Epictetus_, a handbook of moral philosophy, for many\r\nyears a favourite instruction book with both Christians and pagans. It\r\nwas adapted for Christian use by St Nilus of Constantinople (5th\r\ncentury), and Simplicius (about 550) wrote a commentary on it which we\r\nstill possess.\r\n\r\nThe most important of Arrian's original works is his _Anabasis of\r\nAlexander_, in seven books, containing the history of Alexander the\r\nGreat from his accession to his death. Arrian's chief authorities were,\r\nas he tells us, Aristobulus of Cassandreia and Ptolemy, son of Lagus\r\n(afterwards king of Egypt), who both accompanied Alexander on his\r\ncampaigns. In spite of a too indulgent view of his hero's defects, and\r\nsome over-credulity, Arrian's is the most complete and trustworthy\r\naccount of Alexander that we possess.\r\n\r\nOther extant works of Arrian are: _Indica_, a description of India in\r\nthe Ionic dialect, including the voyage of Nearchus, intended as a\r\nsupplement to the _Anabasis; Acies Contra Alanos_, a fragment of\r\nimportance for the knowledge of Roman military affairs; _Periplus of the\r\nEuxine_, an official account written (131) for the emperor Hadrian;\r\n_Tactica_, attributed by some to Aelianus, who wrote in the reign of\r\nTrajan; _Cynegeticus_, a treatise on the chase, supplementing Xenophon's\r\nwork on the same subject; the _Periplus of the Erythraean Sea_,\r\nattributed to him, is by a later compiler. Amongst his lost works may be\r\nmentioned: [Greek: Ta mer Alexandron], a history of the period\r\nsucceeding Alexander, of which an epitome is preserved in Photius;\r\nhistories of Bithynia, the Alani and the Parthian wars under Trajan; the\r\nlives of Timoleon of Syracuse, Dion of Syracuse and a famous brigand\r\nnamed Timoleon. Arrian's style is simple, lucid and manly; but his\r\nlanguage, though pure, presents some peculiarities. He was called\r\n\"Xenophon the younger\" from his imitation of that writer, and he even\r\nspeaks of himself as Xenophon.\r\n\r\n  Complete works ed. F. Dubner (1846); _Anabasis_, C.

Dating nominally from 1800, the\r\narrondissement was really a re-creation of the \"district\" of 1790. It\r\ncomprises within itself the canton and the commune. It differs from the\r\ndepartment and from the commune in being merely an administrative\r\ndivision and not a complete legal personality with power to acquire and\r\npossess. The purposes for which it exists are, again, unlike those of\r\nthe department and the commune, comparatively limited. It is the\r\nelectoral district for the chamber of deputies, each arrondissement\r\nreturning one member; if the population is in excess of 100,000 it is\r\ndivided into two or more constituencies. It is also a judicial district\r\nhaving a court of first instance. It is under the control of a\r\nsub-prefect. There are 362 arrondissements in the 87 departments. Each\r\narrondissement has a council, with as many members as there are cantons,\r\nwhose function is to subdivide among the communes their _quota_ of the\r\ndirect taxes charged to the arrondissement by the general council of the\r\ndepartment. (See FRANCE) Somewhat different from the arrondissements of\r\nthe department are the arrondissements (20 in number) into which Paris\r\nis divided. They bear a certain resemblance to the sub-municipalities\r\ncreated in London by the London Government Act 1899, and each forms a\r\nlocal administrative unit (see PARIS).\r\n\r\nFrance is also subdivided, for purposes of defence, into five _maritime_\r\ndivisions, termed arrondissements. Instituted originally under the\r\nConsulate, they were suppressed in 1815, but re-established again in\r\n1826. They are under the direction of maritime prefects, who, by a\r\ndecree of 1875, must be vice-admirals in the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARROWROOT. A large proportion of the edible starches obtained from the\r\nrhizomes or root-stocks of various plants are known in commerce under\r\nthe name of arrowroot. Properly the name should be restricted to the\r\nstarch yielded by two or three species of _Maranta_ (nat. ord.\r\nMarantaceae), the chief of which is _M. arundinacea_; and when genuine\r\nor West Indian arrowroot is spoken of, it is understood that this is the\r\nvariety meant. _Maranta arundinacea_ is probably a native of Guiana and\r\nwestern Brazil, but it has long been cultivated in the West Indian\r\nIslands, and has now spread to most tropical countries. The plant is a\r\nherbaceous perennial with a creeping root-stock which gives off fleshy\r\ncylindrical branches or tubers, covered with pale brown or white scales\r\nand afterwards ringed with their scars. It is at the period when these\r\ntubers are gorged with starch, immediately before the season of rest,\r\nthat it is ripe for use. In addition to about 25% of starch, the tubers\r\ncontain a proportion of woody tissue, vegetable albumen and various\r\nsalts. The arrowroot may be separated on a small scale in the same\r\nmanner as potato-starch is frequently prepared, that is, by peeling the\r\nroot and grating it in water, when the starch falls to the bottom. The\r\nliquor is then drained off, and the starch purified by repeated washings\r\ntill it is ready for drying. On a large scale the manufacture of\r\narrowroot is conducted with specially arranged machinery. The rhizomes\r\nwhen dug up are washed free of earthy impurities and afterwards skinned.\r\nSubsequently, according to Pereira's _Materia Medica_, \"the carefully\r\nskinned tubers are washed, then ground in a mill, and the pulp washed in\r\ntinned-copper cylindrical washing-machines. The fecula (dim. of Lat.\r\n_faex_, dregs, or sediment) is subsequently dried in drying-houses. In\r\norder to obtain the fecula free from impurity, pure water must be used,\r\nand great care and attention paid in every step of the process. The\r\nskinning or peeling of the tubers must be performed with great nicety,\r\nas the cuticle contains a resinous matter which imparts colour and a\r\ndisagreeable flavour to the starch. German-silver palettes are used for\r\nskinning the deposited fecula, and shovels of the same metal for packing\r\nthe dried fecula. The drying is effected in pans, covered with white\r\ngauze to exclude dust and insects.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nArrowroot Plant (Maranta arundinacea).--Fig. 1, stem, leaves and\r\nflowers; fig. 2, tubers.]\r\n\r\nArrowroot is distinguished by the granules agglomerating into small\r\nballs, by slightly crepitating when rubbed between the fingers, and by\r\nyielding with boiling water a fine, transparent, inodorous and\r\npleasant-tasting jelly. In microscopic structure the granules present an\r\novoid form, marked with concentric lines very similar to potato-starch,\r\nbut readily distinguished by having a \"hilum\" marking at the thick\r\nextremity of the granule, while in potato-starch the same appearance\r\noccurs at the thin end (compare figs. 3 and 4 below). In addition to the\r\nWest Indian supplies, arrowroot is found in the commerce of Brazil, the\r\nEast Indies, Australia, Cape Colony and Natal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. FIG. 4. FIG. 5. FIG. 6. Starch Granules\r\nmagnified.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. Potato.\r\n  Fig. 4. Arrowroot.\r\n  Fig. 5. Tous-les-mois.\r\n  Fig. 6. Manihot.]\r\n\r\nThe name \"arrowroot\" is derived from the use by the Mexican Indians of\r\nthe juice of the fresh root as an application to wounds produced by\r\npoisoned arrows. Sir Hans Sloane refers to it in his _Catalogue of\r\nJamaica Plants_ (1696), and it is said to have been introduced into\r\nEngland by William Houston about 1732. It is grown as a stove-plant in\r\nbotanic gardens. The slender, much-branched stem is 5 or 6 ft. high, and\r\nbears numerous leaves with long, narrow sheaths and large spreading\r\novate blades, and a few short-stalked white flowers.\r\n\r\n_Tous-les-mois_, or Tulema arrowroot, also from the West Indies, is\r\nobtained from several species of _Canna_, a genus allied to _Maranta_,\r\nand cultivated in the same manner. The granules of _tous-les-mois_ are\r\nreadily distinguishable by their very large size (fig. 5). East Indian\r\narrowroot is obtained from the root-stocks of several species of the\r\ngenus _Curcuma_ (nat. ord. Zingiberaceae), chiefly _C. angustifolia_, a\r\nnative of central India. Brazilian arrowroot is the starch of the\r\ncassava plant, a species of Manihot (fig. 6), which when agglutinated on\r\nhot plates forms the tapioca of commerce. The cassava is cultivated in\r\nthe East Indian Archipelago as well as in South America. _Tocca_, or\r\n_Otaheite_ arrowroot, is the produce of _Tacca pinnatifida_, the pia\r\nplant of the South Sea Islands. Portland arrowroot was formerly prepared\r\non the Isle of Portland from the tubers of the common cuckoo-pint, _Arum\r\nmaculatum_. Various other species of arum yield valuable food-starches\r\nin hot countries. Under the name of British arrowroot the farina of\r\npotatoes is sometimes sold, and the French excel in the preparation of\r\nimitations of the more costly starches from this source. The chief use,\r\nhowever, of potato-farina as an edible starch is for adulterating other\r\nand more costly preparations. This falsification can readily be detected\r\nby microscopic examination, and the accompanying drawings exhibit the\r\nappearance under the microscope of the principal starches we have\r\ndescribed. Although these starches agree in chemical composition, their\r\nvalue as articles of diet varies considerably, owing to different\r\ndegrees of digestibility and pleasantness of taste. Arrowroot contains\r\nabout 82% of starch, and about 1% of proteid and mineral matter. Farina,\r\nor British arrowroot, at about one-twelfth the price, is just as useful\r\nand pleasant a food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARROWSMITH, the name of an English family of geographers. The first of\r\nthem, Aaron Arrowsmith (1750-1823), migrated to London from Winston in\r\nDurham when about twenty years of age, and was employed by John Gary,\r\nthe engraver. In 1790 he made himself famous by his large chart of the\r\nworld on Mercator's projection. Four years later he published another\r\nlarge map of the world on the globular projection, with a companion\r\nvolume of explanation. The maps of North America (1796) and Scotland\r\n(1807) are the most celebrated of his many later productions. He left\r\ntwo sons, Aaron and Samuel, the elder of whom was the compiler of the\r\n_Eton Comparative Atlas_, of a Biblical atlas, and of various manuals of\r\ngeography. They carried on the business in company with John Arrowsmith\r\n(1790-1873), nephew of the elder Aaron. In 1834 John published his\r\n_London Atlas_, the best set of maps then in existence. He followed up\r\nthe atlas with a long series of elaborate and carefully executed maps,\r\nthose of Australia, America, Africa and India being especially valuable.\r\nIn 1863 he received the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, of\r\nwhich body he was one of the founders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARROYO (O. Sp. _arrogio_, Lat. _arrogium_, a rivulet or stream), the\r\nchannel of a stream cut in loose earth, found often at the head of a\r\ngully, where the water flows only at certain seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSACES, a Persian name, which occurs on a Persian seal, where it is\r\nwritten in cuneiform characters. The most famous Arsaces was the chief\r\nof the Parni, one of the nomadic Scythian or Dahan tribes in the desert\r\neast of the Caspian Sea. A later tradition, preserved by Arrian, derives\r\nArsaces I. and Tiridates from the Achaemenian king Artaxerxes II., but\r\nthis has evidently no historical value. Arsaces, seeking refuge before\r\nthe Bactrian king Diodotes, invaded Parthia, then a province of the\r\nSeleucid empire, about 250 B.C. (Strabo xi. p. 515, cf. Arrian p. 1,\r\nMuller, in Photius, _Cod._ 58, and Syncellus p. 284). After two years\r\n(according to Arrian) he was killed, and his brother Tiridates, who\r\nsucceeded him and maintained himself for a short time in Parthia, during\r\nthe dissolution of the Seleucid empire by the attacks of Ptolemy III.\r\n(247 ff.), was defeated and expelled by Seleucus II. (about 238). But\r\nwhen this king was forced, by the rebellion of his brother, Antiochus\r\nHierax, to return to the west, Tiridates came back and defeated the\r\nMacedonians (Strabo xi. pp. 513, 515; Justin xli. 4; Appian, _Syr._ 65;\r\nIsidorus of Charax 11). He was the real founder of the Parthian empire,\r\nwhich was of very limited extent until the final decay of the Seleucid\r\nempire, occasioned by the Roman intrigues after the death of Antiochus\r\nIV. Epiphanes (165 B.C.), enabled Mithradates I. and his successors to\r\nconquer Media and Babylonia. Tiridates adopted the name of his brother\r\nArsaces, and after him all the other Parthian kings (who by the\r\nhistorians are generally called by their proper names), amounting to the\r\nnumber of about thirty, officially wear only the name Arsaces. With very\r\nfew exceptions only the name [Greek: ARSAKIS] (with various epithets)\r\noccurs on the coins of the Parthian kings, and the obverse generally\r\nshows the seated figure of the founder of the dynasty, holding in his\r\nhand a strung bow. The Arsacidian empire was overthrown in A.D. 226 by\r\nArdashir (Artaxerxes), the founder of the Sassanid empire, whose\r\nconquests began about A.D. 212. The name Arsaces of Persia is also borne\r\nby some kings of Armenia, who were of Parthian origin. (See PERSIA and\r\nPARTHIA.)     (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARS-AN-DER-MOSEL, a town of Germany, in the imperial province\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, 5 m. S. of Metz on the railway to Noveant. It has a\r\nhandsome Roman Catholic church and extensive foundries. In the vicinity\r\nare the remains of a Roman aqueduct, which formerly spanned the valley.\r\nPop. 5000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSCHOT, PHILIPPE DE CROY, DUKE OF (1526-1595), governor-general of\r\nFlanders, was born at Valenciennes, and inherited the estates of the\r\nancient and wealthy family of Croy. Becoming a soldier, he was made a\r\nknight of the order of the Golden Fleece by Philip II., king of Spain,\r\nand was afterwards employed in diplomatic work. He took part in the\r\ntroubles in the Netherlands, and in 1563 refused to join William the\r\nSilent and others in their efforts to remove Cardinal Granvella from his\r\npost. This attitude, together with Arschot's devotion to the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, which he expressed by showing his delight at the\r\nmassacre of St Bartholomew, led Philip of Spain to regard him with still\r\ngreater favour, which, however, was withdrawn in consequence of\r\nArschot's ambiguous conduct when welcoming the new governor, Don John of\r\nAustria, to the Netherlands in 1576. In spite, however, of his being\r\ngenerally distrusted by the inhabitants of the Netherlands, he was\r\nappointed governor of the citadel of Antwerp when the Spanish troops\r\nwithdrew in 1577. After a period of vacillation he deserted Don John\r\ntowards the end of that year. Jealous of the prince of Orange, he was\r\nthen the head of the party which induced the archduke Matthias\r\n(afterwards emperor) to undertake the sovereignty of the Netherlands,\r\nand soon afterwards was appointed governor of Flanders by the state\r\ncouncil. A strong party, including the burghers of Ghent, distrusted the\r\nnew governor; and Arschot, who was taken prisoner during a riot at\r\nGhent, was only released on promising to resign his office. He then\r\nsought to regain the favour of Philip of Spain, and having been pardoned\r\nby the king in 1580 again shared in the government of the Netherlands;\r\nbut he refused to serve under the count of Fuentes when he became\r\ngovernor-general in 1594, and retired to Venice, where he died on the\r\n11th of December 1595.\r\n\r\n  See J.L. Motley, _The Rise of the Dutch Republic_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENAL, an establishment for the construction, repair, receipt, storage\r\nand issue of warlike stores; details as to _materiel_ will be found\r\nunder AMMUNITION, ORDNANCE, &c. The word \"arsenal\" appears in various\r\nforms in Romanic languages (from which it has been adopted into\r\nTeutonic), i.e. Italian _arzanale_, Spanish _arsenal_, &c.; Italian also\r\nhas _arzana_ and _darsena_, and Spanish a longer form _atarazanal_. The\r\nword is of Arabic origin, being a corruption of _daras-sina'ah_, house\r\nof trade or manufacture, _dar_, house, _al_, the, and _sina'ah_, trade,\r\nmanufacture, _sana'a_, to make. Such guesses as _arx navalis_, naval\r\ncitadel, _arx senatus_ (i.e. of Venice, &c.), are now entirely rejected.\r\n\r\nA first-class arsenal, which can renew the _materiel_ and equipment of a\r\nlarge army, embraces a gun factory, carriage factory, laboratory and\r\nsmall-arms ammunition factory, small-arms factory, harness, saddlery and\r\ntent factories, and a powder factory; in addition it must possess great\r\nstore-houses. In a second-class arsenal the factories would be replaced\r\nby workshops. The situation of an arsenal should be governed by\r\nstrategical considerations. If of the first class, it should be situated\r\nat the base of operations and supply, secure from attack, not too near a\r\nfrontier, and placed so as to draw in readily the resources of the\r\ncountry. The importance of a large arsenal is such that its defences\r\nwould be on the scale of those of a large fortress. The usual\r\nsubdivision of branches in a great arsenal is into A, Storekeeping; B,\r\nConstruction; C, Administration. Under A we should have the following\r\ndepartments and stores:--Departments of issue and receipt, pattern room,\r\narmoury department, ordnance or park, harness, saddlery and\r\naccoutrements, camp equipment, tools and instruments, engineer store,\r\nmagazines, raw material store, timber yard, breaking-up store,\r\nunserviceable store. Under B--Gun factory, carriage factory, laboratory,\r\nsmall-arms factory, harness and tent factory, powder factory, &c. In a\r\nsecond-class arsenal there would be workshops instead of these\r\nfactories. C--Under the head of administration would be classed the\r\nchief director of the arsenal, officials military and civil,\r\nnon-commissioned officers and military artificers, civilian foremen,\r\nworkmen and labourers, with the clerks and writers necessary for the\r\noffice work of the establishments. In the manufacturing branches are\r\nrequired skill, and efficient and economical work, both executive and\r\nadministrative; in the storekeeping part, good arrangement, great care,\r\nthorough knowledge of all warlike stores, both in their active and\r\npassive state, and scrupulous exactness in the custody, issue and\r\nreceipt of stores. For fuller details the reader is referred to papers\r\nby Sir E. Collen, R.A., in vol. viii., and Lieut. C.E. Grover, R.E., in\r\nvol. vi. _Proceedings of R. Artillery Institution_. In England the Royal\r\nArsenal, Woolwich, manufactures and stores the requirements of the army\r\nand navy (see WOOLWICH).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIC (symbol As, atomic weight 75.0), a chemical element, known to\r\nthe ancients in the form of its sulphides. Aristotle gave them the name\r\n[Greek: sanoarakae], and Theophrastus mentions them under the name\r\n[Greek: arsenikon]. The oxide known as white arsenic is mentioned by the\r\nGreek alchemist Olympiodorus, who obtained it by roasting arsenic\r\nsulphide. These substances were all known to the later alchemists, who\r\nused minerals containing arsenic in order to give a white colour to\r\ncopper. Albertus Magnus was the first to state that arsenic contained a\r\nmetal-like substance, although later writers considered it to be a\r\nbastard or semi-metal, and frequently called it _arsenicum rex_. In 1733\r\nG. Brandt showed that white arsenic was the calx of this element, and\r\nafter the downfall of the phlogiston theory the views concerning the\r\ncomposition of white arsenic were identical with those which are now\r\nheld, namely that it is an oxide of the element.\r\n\r\nArsenic is found in the uncombined condition in various localities, but\r\nmore generally in combination with other metals and sulphur, in the form\r\nof more or less complex sulphides. Native arsenic is usually found as\r\ngranular or curvilaminar masses, with a reniform or botryoidal surface.\r\nThese masses are of a dull grey colour, owing to surface tarnish; only\r\non fresh fractures is the colour tin-white with metallic lustre. The\r\nhardness is 3.5 and the specific gravity 5.63-5.73. Crystals of arsenic\r\nbelong to the rhombohedral system, and have a perfect cleavage parallel\r\nto the basal plane; natural crystals are, however, of rare occurrence,\r\nand are usually acicular in habit. Native arsenic occurs usually in\r\nmetalliferous veins in association with ores of antimony, silver, &c.;\r\nthe silver mines of Freiberg in Saxony, St Andreasberg in the Harz, and\r\nChanarcillo in Chile being well-known localities. Attractive globular\r\naggregates of well-developed radiating crystals have been found at\r\nAkatani, a village in the province Echizen, in Japan.\r\n\r\nArsenic is a constituent of the minerals arsenical iron, arsenical\r\npyrites or mispickel, tin-white cobalt or smaltite, arsenical nickel,\r\nrealgar, orpiment, pharmacolite and cobalt bloom, whilst it is also met\r\nwith in small quantities in nearly all specimens of iron pyrites. The\r\nordinary commercial arsenic is either the naturally occurring form,\r\nwhich is, however, more or less contaminated with other metals, or is\r\nthe product obtained by heating arsenical pyrites, out of contact with\r\nair, in earthenware retorts which are fitted with a roll of sheet iron\r\nat the mouth, and an earthenware receiver. By this method of\r\ndistillation the arsenic sublimes into the receiver, leaving a residue\r\nof iron sulphide in the retort. For further purification, it may be\r\nsublimed, after having been previously mixed with a little powdered\r\ncharcoal, or it may be mixed with a small quantity of iodine and heated.\r\nIt can also be obtained by the reduction of white arsenic (arsenious\r\noxide) with carbon. An electro-metallurgical process for the extraction\r\nof arsenic from its sulphides has also been proposed (German Patent.\r\n67,973). These compounds are brought into solution by means of\r\npolysulphides of the alkali metals and the resultant liquor run into the\r\ncathode compartment of a bath, which is divided by diaphragms into a\r\nseries of anode and cathode chambers; the anode divisions being closed\r\nand gas-tight, and containing carbon or platinum electrodes. The arsenic\r\nsolution is decomposed at the cathode, and the element precipitated\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nArsenic possesses a steel-grey colour, and a decided metallic lustre; it\r\ncrystallizes on sublimation and slow condensation in rhombohedra,\r\nisomorphous with those of antimony and tellurium. It is very brittle.\r\nIts specific gravity is given variously from 5.395 to 5.959; its\r\nspecific heat is 0.083, and its coefficient of linear expansion\r\n0.00000559 (at 40 deg. C.). It is volatile at temperatures above 100\r\ndeg. C. and rapidly vaporizes at a dull red heat. It liquefies when\r\nheated under pressure, and its melting point lies between 446 deg. C.\r\nand 457 deg. C. The vapour of arsenic is of a golden yellow colour, and\r\nhas a garlic odour. The vapour density is 10.6 (air = 1) at 564 deg. C.,\r\ncorresponding to a tetratomic molecule As4; at a white heat the vapour\r\ndensity shows a considerable lowering in value, due to the dissociation\r\nof the complex molecule.\r\n\r\nBy condensing arsenic vapour in a glass tube, in a current of an\r\nindifferent gas, such as hydrogen, amorphous arsenic is obtained, the\r\ndeposit on the portion of the tube nearest to the source of heat being\r\ncrystalline, that farther along (at a temperature of about 210 deg. C.)\r\nbeing a black amorphous solid, while still farther along the tube a grey\r\ndeposit is formed. These two latter forms possess a specific gravity of\r\n4.710 (14 deg. C.) [A. Bettendorff, _Annalen_, 1867, 144, p. 110], and\r\nby heating at about 358 deg.-360 deg. C. pass over into the crystalline\r\nvariety. Arsenic burns on heating in a current of oxygen, with a pale\r\nlavender-coloured flame, forming the trioxide. It is easily oxidized by\r\nheating with concentrated nitric acid to arsenic acid, and with\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid to arsenic trioxide; dilute nitric acid only\r\noxidizes it to arsenious acid. It burns in an atmosphere of chlorine\r\nforming the trichloride; it also combines directly with bromine and\r\nsulphur on heating, while on fusion with alkalis it forms arsenites.\r\n\r\nArsenic and most of its soluble compounds are very poisonous, and\r\nconsequently the methods used for the detection of arsenic are very\r\nimportant. For full accounts of methods used in detecting minute traces\r\nof arsenic in foods, &c., see \"Report to Commission to Manchester\r\nBrewers' Central Association,\" the _Analyst_, 1900, 26, p. 8; \"Report of\r\nConjoint Committee of Society of Chemical Industry and Society of Public\r\nAnalysts,\" the _Analyst_, 1902, 27, p. 48; T.E. Thorpe, _Journal of the\r\nChemical Society_, 1903, 83, p. 774; O. Hehner and others, _Journal of\r\nSociety of Chemical Industry_, 1902, 21, p. 94; also ADULTERATION.\r\n\r\n  Arsenic and arsenical compounds generally can be detected by (a)\r\n  _Reinsch's test_: A piece of clean copper is dipped in a solution of\r\n  an arsenious compound which has been previously acidified with pure\r\n  hydrochloric acid. A grey film is produced on the surface of the\r\n  copper, probably due to the formation of a copper arsenide. The\r\n  reaction proceeds better on heating the solution. On removing, washing\r\n  and gently drying the metal and heating it in a glass tube, a white\r\n  crystalline sublimate is formed on the cool part of the tube; under\r\n  the same conditions antimony does not produce a crystalline sublimate.\r\n\r\n  (b) _Fleitmann's test_ and _Marsh's test_ depend on the fact that\r\n  arsenic and its compounds, when present in a solution in which\r\n  hydrogen is being generated, are converted into arseniuretted\r\n  hydrogen, which can be readily detected either by its action on silver\r\n  nitrate solution or by its decomposition on heating. In Fleitmann's\r\n  test, the solution containing the arsenious compound is mixed with\r\n  pure potassium hydroxide solution and a piece of pure zinc or\r\n  aluminium foil dropped in and the whole then heated. A piece of\r\n  bibulous paper, moistened with silver nitrate, is held over the mouth\r\n  of the tube, and if arsenic be present, a grey or black deposit is\r\n  seen on the paper, due to the silver nitrate being reduced by the\r\n  arseniuretted hydrogen. Antimony gives no reaction under these\r\n  conditions, so that the method can be used to detect arsenic in the\r\n  presence of antimony, but the test is not so delicate as either\r\n  Reinsch's or Marsh's method.\r\n\r\n  In the Marsh test the solution containing the arsenious compounds is\r\n  mixed with pure hydrochloric acid and placed in an apparatus in which\r\n  hydrogen is generated from pure zinc and pure sulphuric acid. The\r\n  arseniuretted hydrogen produced is passed through a tube containing\r\n  lead acetate paper and soda-lime, and finally through a narrow glass\r\n  tube, constricted at various points, and heated by a very small flame.\r\n  As the arseniuretted hydrogen passes over the heated portion it is\r\n  decomposed and a black deposit formed. Instead of heating the tube,\r\n  the gas may be ignited at the mouth of the tube and a cold surface of\r\n  porcelain or platinum placed in the flame, when a black deposit is\r\n  formed on the surface. This may be distinguished from the similar\r\n  antimony deposit by its ready solubility in a solution of sodium\r\n  hypochlorite. A blank experiment should always be carried out in\r\n  testing for small quantities of arsenic, to ensure that the materials\r\n  used are quite free from traces of arsenic. It is to be noted that the\r\n  presence of nitric acid interferes with the Marsh test; and also that\r\n  if the arsenic is present as an _arsenic_ compound it must be reduced\r\n  to the _arsenious_ condition by the action of sulphurous acid. Arsenic\r\n  compounds can be detected in the dry way by heating in a tube with a\r\n  mixture of sodium carbonate and charcoal when a deposit of black\r\n  amorphous arsenic is produced on the cool part of the tube, or by\r\n  conversion of the compound into the trioxide and heating with dry\r\n  sodium acetate when the offensive odour of the extremely poisonous\r\n  cacodyl oxide is produced. In the wet way, arsenious oxide and\r\n  arsenites, acidified with hydrochloric acid, give a yellow precipitate\r\n  of arsenic trisulphide on the addition of sulphuretted hydrogen; this\r\n  precipitate is soluble in solutions of the alkaline hydroxides,\r\n  ammonium carbonate and yellow ammonium sulphide. Under like conditions\r\n  arsenates only give a precipitate on long-continued boiling.\r\n\r\n  Arsenic is usually estimated either in the form of magnesium\r\n  pyroarsenate or as arsenic sulphide. For the pyroarsenate method it is\r\n  necessary that the arsenic should be in the _arsenic_ condition, if\r\n  necessary this can be effected by heating with nitric acid; the acid\r\n  solution is then mixed with \"magnesia mixture\" and made strongly\r\n  alkaline by the addition of ammonia. It is then allowed to stand\r\n  twenty-four hours, filtered, washed with dilute ammonia, dried,\r\n  ignited to constant weight and weighed, the filter paper being\r\n  incinerated separately after moistening with nitric acid. From the\r\n  weight of magnesium pyroarsenate obtained the weight of arsenic can be\r\n  calculated.\r\n\r\n  In the sulphide method, the arsenic should be in the _arsenious_ form.\r\n  Sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through the liquid until it is\r\n  thoroughly saturated, the excess of sulphuretted hydrogen is expelled\r\n  from the solution by a brisk stream of carbon dioxide, and the\r\n  precipitate is filtered on a Gooch crucible and washed with water\r\n  containing a little sulphuretted hydrogen and dried at 100 deg. C.; it\r\n  is then well washed with small quantities of pure carbon disulphide to\r\n  remove any free sulphur, again dried and weighed. Arsenic can also be\r\n  estimated by volumetric methods; for this purpose it must be in the\r\n  _arsenious_ condition, and the method of estimation consists in\r\n  converting it into the _arsenic_ condition by means of a standard\r\n  solution of iodine, in the presence of a cold saturated solution of\r\n  sodium bicarbonate.\r\n\r\n  The atomic weight of arsenic has been determined by many different\r\n  chemists. J. Berzelius, in 1818, by heating arsenious oxide with\r\n  excess of sulphur obtained the value 74.3; J. Pelouze (_Comptes\r\n  rendus_, 1845, 20, p. 1047) titrated arsenic chloride with silver\r\n  solution and obtained 75.0; and F. Kessler (_Pogg. Ann._ 1861, 113, p.\r\n  134) by converting arsenic trisulphide in hydrochloric acid solution\r\n  into arsenic pentasulphide also obtained 75.0.\r\n\r\n  _Compounds._--Arsenic forms two hydrides:--The _dihydride_, As2H2, is\r\n  a brown velvety powder formed when sodium or potassium arsenide is\r\n  decomposed by water. It is a somewhat unstable substance, decomposing\r\n  on being heated, with liberation of hydrogen. Arsenic _trihydride_\r\n  (arsine or arseniuretted hydrogen), AsH3, is formed by decomposing\r\n  zinc arsenide with dilute sulphuric acid; by the action of nascent\r\n  hydrogen on arsenious compounds, and by the electrolysis of solutions\r\n  of arsenious and arsenic acids; it is also a product of the action of\r\n  organic matter on many arsenic compounds. It is a colourless gas of\r\n  unpleasant smell, excessively poisonous, very slightly soluble in\r\n  water. It easily burns, forming arsenious oxide if the combustion\r\n  proceeds in an excess of air, or arsenic if the supply of air is\r\n  limited; it is also decomposed into its constituent elements when\r\n  heated. It liquefies at -40 deg. C. and becomes solid at -118.9 deg.\r\n  C. (K. Olszewski). Metals such as tin, potassium and sodium, when\r\n  heated in the gas, form arsenides, with liberation of hydrogen; and\r\n  solutions of gold and silver salts are reduced by the gas with\r\n  precipitation of metallic gold and silver. Chlorine, bromine and\r\n  iodine decompose arsine readily, the action being most violent in the\r\n  case of chlorine.\r\n\r\n  _Arsenic tribromide_, AsBr3, is formed by the direct union of arsenic\r\n  and bromine, and subsequent distillation from the excess of arsenic;\r\n  it forms colourless deliquescent prisms which melt at 20 deg.-25 deg.\r\n  C., and boil at 220 deg. C. Water decomposes it, a small quantity of\r\n  water leading to the formation of the _oxybromide_, AsOBr, whilst a\r\n  large excess of water gives arsenious oxide, As4O6.\r\n\r\n  Arsenic certainly forms two, or possibly three iodides. The\r\n  _di-iodide_, As2I4 or AsI2, which is prepared by heating one part of\r\n  arsenic with two parts of iodine, in a sealed tube to 230 deg. C.,\r\n  forms dark cherry-red prisms, which are easily oxidized, and are\r\n  readily decomposed by water. The _tri-iodide_, AsI3, prepared by\r\n  subliming arsenic and iodine together in a retort, by leading arsine\r\n  into an alcoholic iodine solution, or by boiling powdered arsenic and\r\n  iodine with water, filtering and evaporating, forms brick-red\r\n  hexagonal tables, of specific gravity 4.39, soluble in alcohol, ether\r\n  and benzene, and in a large excess of water; in the presence of a\r\n  small quantity of water, it is decomposed with formation of hydriodic\r\n  acid and an insoluble basic salt of the composition\r\n  4AsOI.3As4O6.24H2O. It combines with alkaline iodides to form very\r\n  unstable compounds. The _pentaiodide_, AsI5, appears to be formed when\r\n  a mixture of one part of arsenic and seven parts of iodine is heated\r\n  to 190 deg. C., but on dissolving the resulting product in carbon\r\n  bisulphide and crystallizing from this solvent, only the tri-iodide is\r\n  obtained.\r\n\r\n  _Arsenic trichloride_, AsCl3, is prepared by distilling white arsenic\r\n  with concentrated sulphuric acid and common salt, or by the direct\r\n  union of arsenic with chlorine, or from the action of phosphorus\r\n  pentachloride on white arsenic. It is a colourless oily heavy liquid\r\n  of specific gravity 2.205 (0 deg. C.), which, when pure and free from\r\n  chlorine, solidifies at -18 deg. C., and boils at 132 deg. C. It is\r\n  very poisonous and decomposes in moist air with evolution of white\r\n  fumes. With a little water it forms arsenic oxychloride, AsOCl, and\r\n  with excess of water it is completely decomposed into hydrochloric\r\n  acid and white arsenic. It combines directly with ammonia to form a\r\n  solid compound variously given as AsCl3.3NH3, or 2AsCl3.7NH3, or\r\n  AsCl3.4NH3.\r\n\r\n  _Arsenic trifiuoride_, AsF3, is prepared by distilling white arsenic\r\n  with fluorspar and sulphuric acid, or by heating arsenic tribromide\r\n  with ammonium fluoride; it is a colourless liquid of specific gravity\r\n  2.73, boiling at 63 deg. C.; it fumes in air, and in contact with the\r\n  skin produces painful wounds. It is decomposed by water into arsenious\r\n  and hydrofluoric acids, and absorbs ammonia forming the compound\r\n  2AsF3.5NH3. By the action of gaseous ammonia on arsenious halides at\r\n  -30 deg. C. to -40 deg. C., _arsenamide_, As(NH2)3, is formed. Water\r\n  decomposes it into arsenious oxide and ammonia, and when heated to 60\r\n  deg. it loses ammonia and forms _arsenimide_, As2(NH)3 (C. Hugot,\r\n  _Compt. rend._ 1904, 139, p. 54). For AsF5, see _Ber_., 1906, 39, p.\r\n  67.\r\n\r\n  Two oxides of arsenic are definitely known to exist, namely the\r\n  trioxide (white arsenic), As4O6, and the pentoxide, As2O5, while the\r\n  existence of a suboxide, As2O(?), has also been mooted. Arsenic\r\n  trioxide has been known from the earliest times, and was called\r\n  _Huttenrauch_ (furnace-smoke) by Basil Valentine. It occurs naturally\r\n  in the mineral claudetite, and can be artificially prepared by burning\r\n  arsenic in air or oxygen. It is obtained commercially by roasting\r\n  arsenical pyrites in either a Brunton's or Oxland's rotatory calciner,\r\n  the crude product being collected in suitable condensing chambers, and\r\n  afterwards refined by resublimation, usually in reverberatory\r\n  furnaces, the foreign matter being deposited in a long flue leading to\r\n  the condensing chambers. White arsenic exists in two crystalline forms\r\n  (octahedral and prismatic) and one amorphous form; the octahedral form\r\n  is produced by the rapid cooling of arsenic vapour, or by cooling a\r\n  warm saturated solution in water, or by crystallization from\r\n  hydrochloric acid, and also by the gradual transition of the amorphous\r\n  variety, this last phenomenon being attended by the evolution of heat.\r\n  Its specific gravity is 3.7; it is only slightly soluble in cold\r\n  water, but is more soluble in hot water, the solution reacting faintly\r\n  acid. The prismatic variety of the oxide can be obtained by\r\n  crystallization from a saturated boiling solution in potassium\r\n  hydroxide, or by the crystallization of a solution of silver arsenite\r\n  in nitric acid. Its specific gravity is 4.15. In the amorphous\r\n  condition it can be obtained by condensing the vapour of the oxide at\r\n  as high a temperature as possible, when a vitreous mass is produced,\r\n  which melts at 200 deg. C., has a specific gravity of 3.68-3.798, and\r\n  is more soluble in water than the crystalline variety.\r\n\r\n  Arsenious oxide is very poisonous. It acts as a reducing agent; it is\r\n  not convertible into the pentoxide by the direct action of oxygen; and\r\n  its solution is reduced by many metals (e.g. zinc, tin and cadmium)\r\n  with precipitation of arsenic and formation of arseniuretted hydrogen.\r\n  The solution of arsenious oxide in water reacts acid towards litmus\r\n  and contains tribasic arsenious acid, although on evaporation of the\r\n  solution the trioxide is obtained and not the free acid. The salts of\r\n  the acid are, however, very stable, and are known as arsenites. Of\r\n  these salts several series are known, namely the ortho-arsenites,\r\n  which are derivatives of the acid H3AsO3, the meta-arsenites,\r\n  derivatives of HAsO2, and the pyro-arsenites, derivatives of H4As2O5.\r\n  The arsenites of the alkali metals are soluble in water, those of the\r\n  other metals are insoluble in water, but are readily soluble in acids.\r\n  A neutral solution of an arsenite gives a yellow precipitate of silver\r\n  arsenite, Ag3AsO3, with silver nitrate solution, and a yellowish-green\r\n  precipitate (Scheele's green) of cupric hydrogen arsenite, CuHAsO3,\r\n  with copper sulphate solution. By the action of oxidizing agents such\r\n  as nitric acid, iodine solution, &c., arsenious acid is readily\r\n  converted into arsenic acid, in the latter case the reaction\r\n  proceeding according to the equation H3AsO3 + I2 + H2O = H3AsO4 + 2HI.\r\n  Arsenic pentoxide, As2O5, is most easily obtained by oxidation of a\r\n  solution of arsenious acid with nitric acid; the solution on\r\n  concentration deposits the compound 2H3AsO4.H2O (below 15 deg. C.),\r\n  which on being heated to a dark red heat loses its water of\r\n  crystallization and leaves a white vitreous mass of the pentoxide.\r\n  This substance dissolves slowly in water, forming arsenic acid; by\r\n  heating to redness it decomposes into arsenic and oxygen. It\r\n  deliquesces in moist air, and is easily reduced to arsenic by heating\r\n  with carbon.\r\n\r\n  Arsenic acid, H3AsO4, is prepared as shown above, the compound\r\n  2H3AsO4.H2O on being heated to 100 deg. C. parting with its water of\r\n  crystallization and leaving a residue of the acid, which crystallizes\r\n  in needles. On heating to 180 deg. C. it loses water and yields\r\n  pyroarsenic acid, H4As2O7, which at 200 deg. C. loses more water and\r\n  leaves a crystalline mass of meta-arsenic acid, HAsO3. These latter\r\n  two acids are only stable in the solid state; they dissolve readily in\r\n  water with evolution of heat and immediate transformation into the\r\n  ortho-arsenic acid. The salts of arsenic acid, termed arsenates, are\r\n  isomorphous with the phosphates, and in general character and\r\n  reactions resemble the phosphates very closely; thus both series of\r\n  salts give similar precipitates with \"magnesia mixture\" and with\r\n  ammonium molybdate solution, but they can be distinguished by their\r\n  behaviour with silver nitrate solution, arsenates giving a\r\n  reddish-brown precipitate, whilst phosphates give a yellow\r\n  precipitate.\r\n\r\n  There are three known compounds of arsenic and sulphur, namely,\r\n  realgar As2S2, orpiment As2S3, and arsenic pentasulphide As2S5.\r\n  Realgar occurs native in orange prisms of specific gravity 3.5; it is\r\n  prepared artificially by fusing together arsenic and sulphur, but the\r\n  resulting products vary somewhat in composition; it is readily fusible\r\n  and sublimes unchanged, and burns on heating in a current of oxygen,\r\n  forming arsenic trioxide and sulphur dioxide.\r\n\r\n  Orpiment (_auri pigmentum_) occurs native in pale yellow rhombic\r\n  prisms, and can be obtained in the amorphous form by passing a current\r\n  of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through a solution of arsenious oxide or\r\n  an arsenite, previously acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid. It\r\n  melts easily and volatilizes. It burns on heating in air, and is\r\n  soluble in solutions of alkaline hydroxides and carbonates, forming\r\n  thioarsenites, As2S3 + 4KHO = K2HAsO3 + K2HAsS3 + H2O. On acidifying\r\n  the solution so obtained with hydrochloric acid, the whole of the\r\n  arsenic is reprecipitated as trisulphide, K2HAsO3 + K2HAsS3 + 4HCl =\r\n  4KCl + 3H2O + As2S3. Arsenic pentasulphide, As2S5, can be prepared by\r\n  fusing the trisulphide with the requisite amount of sulphur; it is a\r\n  yellow easily-fusible solid, which in absence of air can be sublimed\r\n  unchanged; it is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis, forming\r\n  thioarsenates, which can also be obtained by the action of alkali\r\n  polysulphides on orpiment. The thioarsenites and thioarsenates of the\r\n  alkali metals are easily soluble in water, and are readily decomposed\r\n  by the action of mineral acids. Arsenic compounds containing selenium\r\n  and sulphur are known, such as arsenic seleno-sulphide, AsSeS2, and\r\n  arsenic thio-selenide, AsSSe2. Arsenic phosphide, AsP, results when\r\n  phosphine is passed into arsenic trichloride, being precipitated as a\r\n  red-brown powder.\r\n\r\n  Many organic arsenic compounds are known, analogous to those of\r\n  nitrogen and phosphorus, but apparently the primary and secondary\r\n  arsines, AsH2.CH3 and AsH(CH3)2, do not exist, although the\r\n  corresponding chlorine derivatives, AsCl2.CH3, methyl arsine chloride,\r\n  and AsCl(CH4)2, dimethyl arsine chloride, are known. The tertiary\r\n  arsines, such as As(CH3)3, trimethyl arsine, and the quaternary\r\n  arsonium iodides and hydroxides, (CH3)4AsI and (CH3)4As.OH,\r\n  tetramethyl arsonium iodide and hydroxide, have been obtained. The\r\n  arsines and arsine chlorides are liquids of overpowering smell, and in\r\n  some cases exert an extremely irritating action on the mucous\r\n  membrane. They do not possess basic properties; the halogen in the\r\n  chlorine compounds is readily replaced by oxygen, and the oxides\r\n  produced behave like basic oxides. The chlorides AsCl2.CH3 and\r\n  AsCl(CH3)2 as well as As(CH3)3 are capable of combining with two atoms\r\n  of chlorine, the arsenic atom apparently changing from the tri- to the\r\n  penta-valent condition, and the corresponding oxygen compounds can\r\n  also be oxidized to compounds containing one oxygen atom or two\r\n  hydroxyl groups more, forming acids or oxides. The compounds of the\r\n  type AsX5, e.g. AsCl4.CH3, AsCl3(CH3)2, on heating break down, with\r\n  separation of methyl chloride and formation of compounds of the type\r\n  AsX3; the breaking down taking place more readily the fewer the number\r\n  of methyl groups in the compound. The dimethyl arsine (or cacodyl)\r\n  compounds have been most studied. On distillation of equal parts of\r\n  dry potassium acetate and arsenious oxide, a colourless liquid of\r\n  unbearable smell passes over, which is spontaneously inflammable and\r\n  excessively poisonous. It is sometimes called Cadet's fuming liquid,\r\n  and its composition was determined by R. Bunsen, who gave it the name\r\n  cacodyl oxide ([Greek: kakodes], stinking); its formation may be shown\r\n  thus:\r\n\r\n    As4O6 + 8CH3CO2K = 2[(CH3)2As]2O + 4K2CO3 + 4CO2.\r\n\r\n  The liquid is spontaneously inflammable owing to the presence of free\r\n  cacodyl, As2(CH3)4, which is also obtained by heating the oxide with\r\n  zinc clippings in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide; it is a liquid of\r\n  overpowering odour, and boils at 170 deg.C. Cacodyl oxide boils at 150\r\n  deg. C., and on exposure to air takes up oxygen and water and passes\r\n  over into the crystalline cacodylic acid, thus:\r\n\r\n    [(CH3)2As]2O + H2O + O2 = 2(CH3)2As.O.OH.\r\n\r\n_Pharmacology._--Of arsenic and its compounds, arsenious acid (dose\r\n1/60-1/15 gr.) and its preparation liquor arsenicalis, Fowler's solution\r\n(dose 2-8 [minim]), are in very common use. The iodide of arsenic (dose\r\n1/20-1/5 gr.) is one of the ingredients of Donovan's solution (see\r\nMERCURY); and iron arsenate (dose 1/16-1/4 gr. in a pill), a mixture of\r\nferrous and ferric arsenates with some iron oxide, is of great use in\r\ncertain cases. Sodium arsenate (1/40-1/10 gr.) is somewhat less commonly\r\nprescribed, though all the compounds of this metal have great value in\r\nexperienced hands.\r\n\r\nExternally, arsenious acid is a powerful caustic when applied to raw\r\nsurfaces, though it has no action on the unbroken skin. Internally,\r\nunless the dose be extremely small, all preparations are severe\r\ngastro-intestinal irritants. This effect is the same however the drug be\r\nadministered, as, even after subcutaneous injection, the arsenic is\r\nexcreted into the stomach after absorption, and thus sets up gastritis\r\nin its passage through the mucous membrane. In minute doses it is a\r\ngastric stimulant, promoting the flow of gastric juice. It is quickly\r\nabsorbed into the blood, where its presence can be demonstrated\r\nespecially in the white blood corpuscles. In certain forms of anaemia it\r\nincreases the number of the red corpuscles and also their haemoglobin\r\ncontent. None of these known effects of arsenic is sufficient to account\r\nfor the profound change that a course of the drug will often produce in\r\nthe condition of a patient. It has some power of affecting the general\r\nmetabolism, but no wholly satisfactory explanation is forthcoming.\r\nAccording to Binz and Schultz its power is due to the fact that it is an\r\noxygen-carrier, arsenious acid withdrawing oxygen from the protoplasm to\r\nform arsenic acid, which subsequently yields up its oxygen again. It is\r\nthus vaguely called an alterative, since the patient recovers under its\r\nuse. It is eliminated chiefly by the urine, and to a less extent by the\r\nalimentary canal, sweat, saliva, bile, milk, tears, hair, &c., but it is\r\nalso stored up in the body mainly in the liver and kidneys.\r\n\r\n_Therapeutics._--Externally arsenious acid has been much used by quack\r\ndoctors to destroy morbid growths, &c., a paste or solution being\r\napplied, strong enough to kill the mass of tissue and make it slough out\r\nquickly. But many accidents have resulted from the arsenic being\r\nabsorbed, and the patient thereby poisoned. Internally it is useful in\r\ncertain forms of dyspepsia, but as some patients are quite unable to\r\ntolerate the drug, it must always be administered in very small doses at\r\nfirst, the quantity being slowly increased as tolerance is shown.\r\nChildren as a rule bear it better than adults. It should never be given\r\non an empty stomach, but always after a full meal. Certain cases of\r\nanaemia which do not yield to iron are often much improved by arsenic,\r\nthough in other apparently similar ones it appears to be valueless. It\r\nis the routine treatment for pernicious anaemia and Hodgkin's disease,\r\nthough here again the drug may be of no avail. For the neuralgia and\r\nanaemia following malaria, for rheumatoid arthritis, for chorea and also\r\nasthma and hay fever, it is constantly prescribed with excellent\r\nresults. Certain skin diseases, as psoriasis, pemphigus and occasionally\r\nchronic eczema, are much benefited by its use, though occasionally a too\r\nprolonged course will produce the very lesion for which under other\r\ncircumstances it is a cure. A recent method of using the drug is in the\r\nform of sodium cacodylate by subcutaneous injection, and this\r\npreparation is said to be free from the cumulative effects sometimes\r\narising after the prolonged use of the other forms. Other organic\r\nderivatives employed are sodium metharsenite and sodium anilarsenate or\r\natoxyl; hypodermic injections of the latter have been used in the\r\ntreatment of sleeping sickness. Occasionally, as among the Styrians,\r\nindividuals acquire the habit of arsenic-eating, which is said to\r\nincrease their weight, strength and appetite, and clears their\r\ncomplexion. The probable explanation is that an antitoxin is developed\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\n_Toxicology and Forensic Medicine._--The commonest source of arsenical\r\npoisoning is the arsenious acid or white arsenic, which in one form is\r\nwhite and opaque, like flour, for which it has been mistaken with fatal\r\nresults. Also, as it has little taste and no colour it is easily mixed\r\nwith food for homicidal purposes. When combined with potash or soda it\r\nis used to saturate flypapers, and strong solutions can be obtained by\r\nsoaking these in water; this fact has also been used with criminal\r\nintent. Copper arsenite (or Scheele's green) used to be much employed as\r\na pigment for wall-papers and fabrics, and toxic effects have resulted\r\nfrom their use. Metallic arsenic is probably not poisonous, but as it\r\nusually becomes oxidized in the alimentary canal, the usual symptoms of\r\narsenical poisoning follow its use.\r\n\r\nIn acute poisoning the interval between the reception of the poison and\r\nthe onset of symptoms ranges from ten minutes, or even less, if a strong\r\nsolution be taken on an empty stomach, to twelve or more hours if the\r\ndrug be taken in solid form and the stomach be full of food. The usual\r\nperiod, however, is from half an hour to an hour. In a typical case a\r\nsensation of heat developing into a burning pain is felt in the throat\r\nand stomach. This is soon followed by uncontrollable vomiting, and a\r\nlittle later by severe purging, the stools being first of all faecal but\r\nlater assuming a rice water appearance and often containing blood. The\r\npatient suffers from intense thirst, which cannot be relieved, as\r\ndrinking is immediately followed by rejection of the swallowed fluid.\r\nThere is profound collapse, the features are sunken, the skin moist and\r\ncyanosed. The pulse is feeble and irregular, and respiration is\r\ndifficult. The pain in the stomach is persistent, and cramps in the\r\ncalves of the legs add to the torture. Death may be preceded by coma,\r\nbut consciousness is often maintained to the end. The similarity of the\r\nsymptoms to those of cholera is very marked, but if the suspicion arises\r\nit can soon be cleared up by examining any of the secretions for\r\narsenic. More rarely the poison seems to centre itself on the nerve\r\ncentres, and gastro-intestinal symptoms may be almost or quite absent.\r\nIn such cases the acute collapse occurs in company with both superficial\r\nand deep anaesthesia of the limbs, and is soon followed by coma\r\nterminating in death. In criminal poisoning repeated doses are usually\r\ngiven, so that such cases may not be typical, but will present some of\r\nthe aspects of acute and some of chronic arsenical poisoning. As regards\r\ntreatment, the stomach must be washed out with warm water by means of a\r\nsoft rubber tube, an emetic being also administered. Then, if available,\r\nfreshly precipitated ferric hydrate must be given, which can be prepared\r\nby adding a solution of ammonia to one of iron perchloride. The\r\nprecipitate is strained off, and the patient can swallow it suspended in\r\nwater. While this is being obtained, magnesia, castor oil or olive oil\r\ncan be given; or failing all these, copious draughts of water. The\r\ncollapse must be treated with hot blankets and bottles, and subcutaneous\r\ninjections of brandy, ether or strychnine. The pain can be lessened by\r\ninjections of morphia.\r\n\r\nArsenic may be gradually absorbed into the system in very small\r\nquantities over a prolonged period, the symptoms of chronic poisoning\r\nresulting. The commonest sources used to be wall-papers, fabrics,\r\nartificial flowers and toys: also certain trades, as in the manufacture\r\nof arsenical sheep-dipping. But at the present time cases arising from\r\nthese causes occur very rarely. In 1900 an outbreak of \"peripheral\r\nneuritis\" with various skin affections occurred in Lancashire, which was\r\ntraced to beer made from glucose and invert sugar, in the preparation of\r\nwhich sulphuric acid contaminated with arsenic was said to have been\r\nused. But the nature of the disease in this case was decidedly obscure.\r\nThe symptoms so closely resembled those of _beri-beri_ that it has also\r\nbeen suggested that the illness was the same, and was caused by the\r\nmanufacture of the glucose from mouldy rice (see BERI-BERI), though no\r\nproof of this was possible. The earliest symptoms are slight gastric\r\ndisorders, loss of appetite and general malaise, followed later by\r\ncolicky pains, irritation of eyelids and skin eruptions. But sooner or\r\nlater peripheral neuritis develops, usually beginning with sensory\r\ndisturbances, tingling, numbness, formication and occasionally cutaneous\r\nanaesthesia. Later the affected muscles become exquisitely tender, and\r\nthen atrophy, while the knee-jerk or other reflex is lost. Pigmentation\r\nof the skin may occur in the later stages. Recovery is very slow, and in\r\nfatal cases death usually results from heart failure.\r\n\r\nAfter acute poisoning, the stomach at a _post-mortem_ presents signs of\r\nintense inflammation, parts or the whole of its mucous membrane being of\r\na colour varying from dark red to bright vermilion and often corrugated.\r\nSubmucous haemorrhages are usually present, but perforation is rare. The\r\nrest of the alimentary canal exhibits inflammatory changes in a somewhat\r\nlesser degree. After chronic poisoning a widely spread fatty\r\ndegeneration is present. Arsenic is found in almost every part of the\r\nbody, but is retained in largest amount by the liver, secondly by the\r\nkidneys. After death from chronic poisoning it is found present even in\r\nthe brain and spongy bone. The detection of arsenic in criminal cases is\r\neffected either by Reinsch's test or by Marsh's test, the urine being\r\nthe secretion analysed when available. But Reinsch's test cannot be used\r\nsatisfactorily for a quantitative determination, nor can it be used in\r\nthe presence of chlorates or nitrates. And Marsh's test is very\r\nunmanageable with organic liquids on account of the uncontrollable\r\nfrothing that takes place. But in such cases the organic matter can be\r\nfirst destroyed by one of the various methods, usually the moist method\r\ndevised by Fresenius being chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIUS (c. 354-450), an anchorite, said to have been born of a noble\r\nRoman family, who achieved a high reputation for his knowledge of Greek\r\nand Roman literature. He was appointed by Theodosius the Great, tutor of\r\nthe young princes Arcadius and Honorius, but at the age of forty he\r\nretired to Egypt, where for forty years he lived in monastic seclusion\r\nat Scetis in the Thebais, under the spiritual guidance of St John the\r\nDwarf. He is said to have gained the admiration of his fellows by the\r\nextreme rigour of his asceticism. The remainder of his life he spent at\r\nCanopus, and Troe near Memphis, where he died at the age of ninety-five.\r\nOf his writings two collections of admonitory maxims are extant: the\r\nfirst, [Greek: Didaskalia kai parainesis], containing instructions for\r\nmonks, is published with a Latin version by Fr. Combefis in _Auctarium\r\nbiblioth. patr. novissim._ (Paris, 1672), pp. 301 f.; the second is a\r\ncollection of forty-four wise sayings put together by his friends under\r\nthe title of [Greek: Apophthegmata] (see Cotelerius, _Eccl. graec.\r\nmonum._, 1677, i. pp. 353-372). In the Roman Catholic Church his\r\nfestival is on the 19th of July, in the Orthodox Eastern Church on the\r\n8th of May. His biography by Simeon Metaphrastes is largely fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIUS AUTORIANUS (13th century), patriarch of Constantinople, lived\r\nabout the middle of the 13th century. He received his education in\r\nNicaea at a monastery of which he later became the abbot, though not in\r\norders. Subsequently he gave himself up to a life of solitary asceticism\r\nin a Bithynian monastery, and is said, probably wrongly, to have\r\nremained some time in a monastery on Mount Athos. From this seclusion he\r\nwas in A.D. 1255 called by Theodore II. Lascaris to the position of\r\npatriarch at Nicaea, and four years later, on that emperor's death,\r\nbecame joint guardian of his son John. His fellow-guardian Georgios\r\nMouzalon was immediately murdered by Michael Palaeologus, who assumed\r\nthe position of tutor. Arsenius then took refuge in the monastery of\r\nPaschasius, retaining his office of patriarch but refusing to discharge\r\nits duties. Nicephorus of Ephesus was appointed in his stead. In 1261\r\nMichael, having recovered Constantinople, induced Arsenius again to\r\nundertake the office of patriarch, but soon incurred his severe censure\r\nby ordering the young prince John to be blinded. Arsenius went so far as\r\nto excommunicate the emperor, who, having vainly sought for pardon, took\r\nrefuge in false accusations against Arsenius and caused him to be\r\nbanished to Proconnesus, where some years afterwards (according to\r\nFabricius in 1264; others say in 1273) he died. Throughout these years\r\nhe declined to remove the sentence of excommunication which he had\r\npassed upon Michael, and after his death, when the new patriarch\r\nJosephus gave absolution to the emperor, the quarrel was carried on\r\nbetween the \"Arsenites\" and the \"Josephists.\" The \"Arsenian schism\"\r\nlasted till 1315, when reconciliation was effected by the patriarch\r\nNiphon (see Gibbon, _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, ed. J.B.\r\nBury, 1898, vol. vi. 467 foll.). Arsenius is said to have prepared from\r\nthe decisions of the councils and the works of the Fathers a summary of\r\ndivine laws under the title _Synopsis Canonum_. This was published\r\n(Greek original and Latin version) by G. Voel and H. Justel in\r\n_Bibliotheca Jur. Canon. Vet._ (Paris, 1661), 749 foll. Some hold that\r\nthe _Synopsis_ was the work of another Arsenius, a monk of Athos (see L.\r\nPetit in Vacant's _Dict. theol. cathol._ i. col. 1994); the ascription\r\ndepends on whether the patriarch Arsenius did or did not sojourn at\r\nMount Athos.\r\n\r\n  See Georgius Pachymeres ii. 15, iii. _passim_, iv. 1-16; Nicephorus\r\n  Gregoras iii. 1, iv. 1; for the will of Arsenius see Cotelerius,\r\n  _Monumenta_, ii. 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSES, Persian king, youngest son of Artaxerxes III., was raised to the\r\nthrone in 338 B.C. by Bagoas (q.v.), who had murdered his father and\r\nall his brothers. But when the young king tried to make himself\r\nindependent, Bagoas killed him too, with all his children, in the third\r\nyear of his reign (336) (Diod. 17.5; Strabo 15. 736; Trogus, Prol. x.,\r\nAlexander's despatch to Darius III.; Arrian ii. 14. 5, and the\r\nchronographers). In Plutarch, _De fort. Alex._ ii. 3. 5, he is called\r\n_Oarses_; in Johannes Antioch. p. 38, _Arsamos_; in the canon of\r\nPtolemy, _Aroges_ (by Elias of Nisibis, _Piruz_); in a chronological\r\ntablet from Babylon (Brit. Mus. Sp. ii. 71, _Zeitschrift fur\r\nAssyriologie_, viii. 176, x. 64) he is abbreviated into _Ar_. See\r\nPERSIA: _Ancient History_.     (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSINOE, the name of four Egyptian princesses of the Ptolemaic dynasty.\r\nThe name was introduced into the Ptolemaic dynasty by the mother of\r\nPtolemy I. This Arsinoe was originally a mistress of Philip II. of\r\nMacedon, who presented her to a Macedonian soldier Loqus shortly before\r\nPtolemy was born. It was, therefore, assumed by the Macedonians that the\r\nPtolemaic house was really descended from Philip (see PTOLEMIES).\r\n\r\n1. Daughter of Lysimachus, king of Thrace, first wife of Ptolemy II.\r\nPhiladelphus (285-247 B.C.). Accused of conspiring against her husband,\r\nwho perhaps already contemplated marriage with his sister, also named\r\nArsinoe, she was banished to Coptos, in Upper Egypt. Her son Ptolemy was\r\nafterwards king under the title of Euergetes. It is supposed by some\r\n(e.g. Niebuhr, _Kleine Schriften_; cf. Ehrlichs, _De Callimachi hymnis_)\r\nthat she is to be identified with the Arsinoe who became wife of Magas,\r\nking of Cyrene, and that she married him after her exile to Coptos. But\r\nthis hypothesis is apparently without foundation. Magas before his death\r\nhad betrothed his daughter Berenice to the son of his brother Ptolemy\r\nII. Philadelphus, but Arsinoe, disliking the projected alliance, induced\r\nDemetrius the Fair, son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, to accept the throne\r\nof Cyrene as husband of Berenice. She herself, however, fell in love\r\nwith the young prince, and Berenice in revenge formed a conspiracy, and,\r\nhaving slain Demetrius, married Ptolemy's son (see BERENICE, 3).\r\n\r\n2. Daughter of Ptolemy I. Soter and Berenice. Born about 316 B.C., she\r\nmarried Lysimachus, king of Thrace, who made over to her the territories\r\nof his divorced wife, Amastris. To secure the succession for her own\r\nchildren she brought about the murder of her stepson Agathocles.\r\nLysandra, the wife of Agathocles, took refuge with Seleucus, king of\r\nSyria, who made war upon Lysimachus and defeated him (281). After her\r\nhusband's death Arsinoe fled to Ephesus and afterwards to Cassandreia in\r\nMacedonia. Seleucus, who had seized Lysimachus's kingdom, was murdered\r\nin 281 by Ptolemy Ceraunus (half-brother of Arsinoe), who thus became\r\nmaster of Thrace and Macedonia. To obtain possession of Cassandreia, he\r\noffered his hand in marriage to Arsinoe, and being admitted into the\r\ntown, killed her two younger sons and banished her to Samothrace.\r\nEscaping to Egypt, she became the wife of her full brother Ptolemy II.,\r\nthe first instance of the practice (afterwards common) of the Greek\r\nkings of Egypt marrying their sisters. She was a woman of a masterful\r\ncharacter and won great influence. Her husband, though she bore him no\r\nchildren, was devoted to her and paid her all possible honour after her\r\ndeath in 271. He gave her name to a number of cities, and also to a\r\ndistrict (nome) of Egypt.[1] It is related that he ordered the architect\r\nDinochares to build a temple in her honour in Alexandria; in order that\r\nher statue, made of iron, might appear to be suspended in the air, the\r\nroof was to consist of an arch of loadstones (Pliny, _Hist. Nat._ xxxiv.\r\n42). Coins were also struck, showing her crowned and veiled on the\r\nobverse, with a double cornucopia on the reverse. She was worshipped as\r\na goddess under the title of [Greek: Thea Philadelphos], and she and her\r\nhusband as [Greek: Theoi adelphoi] (Justin xxiv. 2, 3; Pausanias i. 7).\r\n\r\n  See von Prott, _Rhein. Mus._ liii. (1898), pp. 460 f.\r\n\r\n3. Daughter of Ptolemy III. Euergetes, sister and wife of Ptolemy IV.\r\nPhilopator. She seems to be erroneously called Eurydice by Justin (xxx.\r\n2), and Cleopatra by Livy (xxvii. 4). Her presence greatly encouraged\r\nthe troops at the battle of Raphia (217), in which Antiochus the Great\r\nwas defeated. Her husband put her to death to please his mistress\r\nAgathocleia, a Samian dancer (between 210 and 205). She was worshipped\r\nas [Greek: Thea Philopator]; she and her husband as [Greek: Theoi\r\nPhilopatores] (Polybius v. 83, 84, xv. 25-33).\r\n\r\n4. Youngest daughter of Ptolemy XIII. Auletes, and sister of the famous\r\nCleopatra. During the siege of Alexandria by Julius Caesar (48) she was\r\nrecognized as queen by the inhabitants, her brother, the young Ptolemy,\r\nbeing then held captive by Caesar. Caesar took her with him to Rome as a\r\nprecaution. After Caesar's triumph she was allowed to return to\r\nAlexandria. After the battle of Philippi she was put to death at Miletus\r\n(or in the temple of Artemis at Ephesus) by order of Mark Antony, at the\r\nrequest of her sister Cleopatra (Dio Cassius xlii. 39; Caesar, _Bell.\r\nciv._ iii. 112; Appian, _Bell. civ._ v. 9).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--For general authorities see article PTOLEMIES. The\r\n  article \"Arsinoe\" in Pauly-Wissowa's _Realencyclopadie_ contains a\r\n  full list of those who bore the name, and also of the numerous towns\r\n  which were called after the various princesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The appendix to pt. ii. of the Tebtunis series of papyri\r\n    (Grenfell, Hunt and Goodspeed, 1907) contains a lengthy account of\r\n    the topography of the Arsinoite nome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSINOITHERIUM (so called from the Egyptian queen Arsinoe), a gigantic\r\nhorned mammal from the Middle Eocene beds of the Fayum, Egypt,\r\nrepresenting a sub-order of Ungulata, called Barypoda. The skull is\r\nremarkable for carrying a huge pair of horn-cores above the muzzle,\r\nwhich seem to be the enlarged nasal bones, and a rudimentary pair\r\nfarther back; the front horn-cores, like the rest of the skull, consist\r\nof a mere shell of bone, and were probably clothed in life with horny\r\nsheaths. The teeth form a continuous even series, the small canines\r\nbeing crowded between the incisors and premolars; the crowns of the\r\ncheek-series are tall (hypsodont), with a distinctive pattern of their\r\nown. Although the brain is relatively larger, the bones of the limbs,\r\nespecially the short, five-toed feet, approximate to those of the\r\nAmblypoda and Proboscidea; but in the articulation of the astragalus\r\nwith both the navicular and cuboid _Arsinoitherium_ is nearer the former\r\nthan the latter group.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that these resemblances are mainly due to\r\nparallelism in development, and are in all three cases adaptations\r\nnecessary to support the enormous weight of the body. On the other hand,\r\nthe marked resemblance of the structure of the tarsus is probably\r\nindicative of descent from nearly allied condylarthrous ancestors (see\r\nPHENACODUS). No importance can be attached to the presence of horns as\r\nan indication of affinity between _Arsinoitherium_ and the Amblypoda;\r\nand there are important differences in the structure of the skulls of\r\nthe two, notably in the external auditory meatus, the occiput, the\r\npremaxillae, the palatal foramina and the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nFrom the Proboscidea _Arsinoitherium_ differs broadly in skull\r\nstructure, in the form of the cheek-teeth, and in the persistence of the\r\ncomplete dental series of forty-four without gaps or enlargement of\r\nparticular teeth. Whether there is any relationship with the Hyracoidea\r\ncannot be determined until we are acquainted with the forerunners of\r\n_Arsinoitherium_, which is evidently a highly specialized type.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that as the name Barypoda has been used at an earlier\r\ndate for another group of animals, the alternative title Embrithopoda\r\nhas been suggested in case the former should be considered barred.\r\n\r\n  See C.W. Andrews, _Descriptive Catalogue of the Tertiary Vertebrata of\r\n  the Fayum, British Museum_ (1906).     (R. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSON (from Lat. _ardere_, to burn), a crime which has been described as\r\nthe malicious and voluntary burning of the house of another (3 Co.\r\n_Inst._ 66). At common law in England it is an offence of the degree of\r\nfelony. In the Roman civil law arson was punishable by death. It appears\r\nearly in the history of English law, being known in ancient laws by the\r\nterm of _boernet_. It is mentioned by Cnut as one of the bootless\r\ncrimes, and under the Saxon laws was punishable by death. The sentence\r\nof death for arson was, says Stephen (_Commentaries_, iv. 89), in the\r\nreign of Edward I. executed by a kind of _lex talionis_, for the\r\nincendiaries were burnt to death; a punishment which was inflicted also\r\nunder the Gothic institutions. Death continued to be the penalty at\r\nleast down to the reign of King John, according to a reported case\r\n(Gloucester Pleas, pl. 216), but in course of time the penalty became\r\nthat of other common-law felonies, death by the gallows. It is one of\r\nthe earliest crimes in which the _mens rea_, or criminal intent, was\r\ntaken special notice of. Bracton deals at length with the _mala\r\nconscientia_, which he says is necessary for this crime, and contrasts\r\nit with _negligentia_ (f. 146 b), while in many early indictments malice\r\naforethought (_malitia praecogitata_) appears. Arson was deprived of\r\n\"benefit of clergy\" under the Tudors, while an act of 8 Henry VI. c. 6\r\n(1429) made the wilful burning of houses, under particular\r\ncircumstances, high treason, but acts of 1 Ed. VI. c. 12 (1547) and 1\r\nMary (1553) reduced it to an ordinary felony. The English law concerning\r\narson was consolidated by 7 & 8 Geo. IV. c. 30, which was repealed and\r\nre-enacted by the Malicious Damage Act 1861.\r\n\r\nThe common-law offence of arson (which has been greatly enlarged by the\r\nact of 1861) required some part of the house to be actually burnt;\r\nneither a bare intention nor even an actual attempt by putting fire in\r\nor towards it will constitute the offence, if no part was actually\r\nburnt, but the burning of any part, however trifling, is sufficient, and\r\nthe offence is complete even if the fire is put out or goes out of\r\nitself. The burning must be malicious and wilful, otherwise it is only a\r\ntrespass. If a man by wilfully setting fire to his own house burn the\r\nhouse of his neighbour also, it will be a felony, even though the\r\nprimary intention of the party was to burn his own house only. The word\r\n_house_, in the definition of the offence at common law, extends not\r\nonly to dwelling-houses, \"but to all out-houses which are parcel\r\nthereof, though not adjoining thereto.\" Barns with corn and hay in them,\r\nthough distant from a house, are within the definition.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of the offence are specified in the Malicious\r\nDamage Act 1861. The following crimes are thereby made felonies: (1)\r\nsetting fire to any church, chapel, meeting-house or other place of\r\ndivine worship; (2) setting fire to a dwelling-house, any person being\r\ntherein; (3) setting fire to a house, out-house, manufactory,\r\nfarm-building, &c., with intent to impose and defraud any person; (4)\r\nsetting fire to buildings appertaining to any railway, port, dock or\r\nharbour; or (5) setting fire to any public building. In these cases the\r\nact provides that the person convicted shall be liable, at the\r\ndiscretion of the court, to be kept in penal servitude for life, or for\r\nany term not less than three years (altered to _five_ years by the Penal\r\nServitude Acts Amendment Act 1864), or to be imprisoned for any time not\r\nexceeding two years, with or without hard labour, and, if a male under\r\nsixteen years of age, with or without whipping. Setting fire to other\r\nbuildings, and setting fire to goods in buildings under such\r\ncircumstances that, if the building were thereby set fire to, the\r\noffence would amount to felony, are subject to the punishments last\r\nenumerated, with this exception that the period of penal servitude is\r\nlimited to fourteen years. The attempt to set fire to any building, or\r\nany matter or thing not enumerated above, is punishable as a felony.\r\nRussell says (_Crimes_, p. 1781) that the term building is no doubt very\r\nindefinite, but it was used in 9 & 10 Vict. c. 25, s. 2; and it was\r\nthought much better to adopt this term and leave it to be interpreted as\r\neach case might arise, than to attempt to define; as any such attempt\r\nwould probably have failed in producing any expression more certain than\r\nthe term \"building\" itself. In _R._ v. _Manning_, 1872 (L.R. 1 C.C.R.\r\n338), it was held that an unfinished house was a building within the\r\nmeaning of the act. The setting fire to crops of hay, grass, corn, &c.,\r\nis punishable by penal servitude for any period not exceeding fourteen\r\nyears, but setting fire to stacks of the same, or any cultivated\r\nvegetable produce, or to peat, coals, &c., is regarded as a more serious\r\noffence, and the penal servitude may be for life. For the attempt to\r\ncommit the last two offences penal servitude is limited to seven years.\r\nSetting fire to mines of coal, anthracite or other mineral fuel is\r\nvisited with the full measure of penalty, and in the case of an attempt\r\nthe penal servitude is limited to fourteen years. By the Dockyards, &c.,\r\nProtection Act 1772 it is a felony punishable by death wilfully and\r\nmaliciously to set fire to any of His Majesty's ships or vessels of war,\r\nor any of His Majesty's arsenals, magazines, dockyards, rope-yards,\r\nvictualling offices or buildings therein, or any timber, material,\r\nstores or ammunition of war therein or in any part of His Majesty's\r\ndominions. If the person guilty of the offence is a person subject to\r\nnaval discipline, he is triable by court-martial, and if found guilty, a\r\nsentence of capital punishment may be passed. The Malicious Damage Act\r\n1861, s. 43, also includes as a felony the setting fire to any ship or\r\nvessel, with intent to prejudice any owner or part owner of the vessel,\r\nor of any goods on the same, or any person who has underwritten any\r\npolicy of insurance on the vessel, or upon any goods on board the same.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the offence equivalent to arson in England is known by the\r\nmore expressive name of fire-raising. The crime was punishable capitally\r\nby old consuetudinary law, but it is now no longer capital, and may be\r\ntried in the sheriff court (50 & 51 Vict. c. 35, s. 56). Formerly the\r\npublic prosecutor had the privilege of declining to demand capital\r\npunishment, and he invariably did so. _Wilful fire-raising_, which is\r\nthe most heinous form of the crime, requires the raising of fire,\r\nwithout any lawful object, but with the deliberate intention of\r\ndestroying certain premises or things, whether directly by the\r\napplication of fire thereto, or indirectly by its application to\r\nsomething contained in or forming part of or communicating with them;\r\nalso the intention to destroy premises or things of a certain\r\ndescription (much as mentioned above); and such premises or things must\r\nbe the property of another than the accused. _Wicked, culpable and\r\nreckless fire-raising_ differs from wilful fire-raising in that the fire\r\nis raised _without_ the deliberate intention of destroying premises or\r\nthings, but while the accused was engaged in some unlawful act, or while\r\nhe was in such a state of passion, excitement or recklessness as not to\r\ncare what results might follow from his acts.\r\n\r\n_United States._--The same general principles apply to this crime in\r\nAmerican law. In some states by statute the intent to injure or defraud\r\nmust be shown, e.g. when the property is insured. In New York one who\r\nwilfully burns property (including a vessel or its cargo) with intent to\r\ndefraud or prejudice the insurer thereof, though the offence of arson is\r\nnot committed, is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five\r\nyears (N.Y. Pen. Code, ss. 575, 578). There must be an intent to destroy\r\nthe building (_ibid._ s. 490; California Code, s. 447). An agreement to\r\ncommit arson is conspiracy (_ibid._ s. 171). Killing a person in\r\ncommitting the crime of arson is murder in the first degree (_ibid._ s.\r\n183); this is so in California, even where the crime is merely an\r\nattempt to commit arson (Cal. Pen. Code, s. 189). Explosion of a house\r\nby gunpowder or dynamite is arson (Texas Pen. Code, art. 761), but a\r\ncharge of arson by \"burning\" will not be sustained by proof of exploding\r\nby dynamite, even though part of the building is burnt by the explosion\r\n(_Landers_ v. _State_ [Tex.], 47 S.W. 1008).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--W.S.

On the\r\neast it is continued by the forest of Denney, which contains the\r\nfortress of Roppe, dominating the road from Colmar into France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSUF, a town on the coast of Palestine, 12 m. N.N.E. of Jaffa, famous\r\nas the scene of a victory of the crusaders under Richard I. of England\r\nover the army of Saladin. After the capture of Acre on the 12th of July\r\n1191, the army of the crusaders, under Richard Coeur-de-Lion and the\r\nduke of Burgundy, opened their campaign for the recovery of Jerusalem by\r\nmarching southward towards Jaffa, from which place it was intended to\r\nmove direct upon the holy city. The march was along the sea-shore, and,\r\nthe forces of Saladin being in the vicinity, the army moved in such a\r\nformation as to be able to give battle at any moment. Richard thus moved\r\nslowly, but in such compact order as to arouse the admiration even of\r\nthe enemy. The right column of baggage and supplies, guarded by\r\ninfantry, was nearest the sea, the various corps of heavy cavalry, one\r\nbehind the other, formed the central column, and on the exposed left\r\nflank was the infantry, well closed up, and \"level and firm as a wall,\"\r\naccording to the testimony of Saracen authors. The columns were united\r\ninto a narrow rectangle by the advanced and rear guards. The whole march\r\nwas a running fight between untiring horse-archers and steady infantry.\r\nOnly once did the column open out, and the opportunity was swiftly\r\nseized by the Saracens, yet so rapid was the rally of the crusaders that\r\nlittle damage was done (August 25). The latter maintained for many days\r\nan absolutely passive defence, and could not be tempted to fight;\r\nRichard and his knights made occasional charges, but quickly withdrew,\r\nand on the 7th of September this irregular skirmishing, in which the\r\ncrusaders had scarcely suffered at all, culminated in the battle of\r\nArsuf. Saladin had by now decided that the only hope of success lay in\r\ncompelling the rear of the Christians' column to halt--and thus opening\r\na gap, should the van be still on the move. Richard, on the other hand,\r\nhad prepared for action by closing up still more, and as the crusaders\r\nwere now formed a simple left turn brought them into two lines of\r\nbattle, infantry in first line, cavalry in second line. Near Arsuf the\r\nroad entered a defile between the sea and a wooded range of hills; and\r\nfrom the latter the whole Moslem army suddenly burst forth. The weight\r\nof the attack fell upon the rear of Richard's column, as Saladin\r\ndesired. The column slowly continued its march, suffering heavily in\r\nhorses, but otherwise unharmed. The first assault thus made no\r\nimpression, but a fierce hand-to-hand combat followed, in which the\r\nHospitallers, who formed the rear of the Christian army, were hard\r\npressed. Their grand master, like many other subordinates in history,\r\nrepeatedly begged to be allowed to charge, but Richard, who on this\r\noccasion showed the highest gift of generalship, that of feeling the\r\npulse of the fight, waited for the favourable moment. Almost as he gave\r\nthe signal for the whole line to charge, the sorely pressed Hospitallers\r\nrode out upon the enemy on their own initiative. At once the whole of\r\nthe cavalry followed suit. The head (or right wing) and centre were not\r\nclosely engaged, and their fleeter opponents had time to ride off, but\r\nthe rear of the column carried all before it in its impetuous onset, and\r\ncut down the Saracens in great numbers. A second charge, followed by a\r\nthird, dispersed the enemy in all directions. The total loss of the\r\nSaracens was more than tenfold that of the Christians, who lost but\r\nseven hundred men. The army arrived at Jaffa on the 10th of September.\r\n\r\n  See Oman, _Hist. of the Art of War_, ii. 303-317.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARSURE, a village of France in the department of Jura, has some stone\r\nquarries and extensive layers of peat in its neighbourhood.

Pop. 233.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART, a word in its most extended and most popular sense meaning\r\neverything which we distinguish from Nature. Art and Nature are the two\r\nmost comprehensive genera of which the human mind has formed the\r\nconception. Under the genus Nature, or the genus Art, we include all the\r\nphenomena of the universe. But as our conception of Nature is\r\nindeterminate and variable, so in some degree is our conception of Art.\r\nNor does such ambiguity arise only because some modes of thought refer a\r\ngreater number of the phenomena of the universe to the genus Nature, and\r\nothers a greater number to the genus Art. It arises also because we do\r\nnot strictly limit the one genus by the other. The range of the\r\nphenomena to which we point, when we say Art, is never very exactly\r\ndetermined by the range of the other phenomena which at the same time we\r\ntacitly refer to the order of Nature. Everybody understands the general\r\nmeaning of a phrase like Chaucer's \"Nature ne Art ne koude him not\r\namende,\" or Pope's \"Blest with each grace of nature and of art.\" In such\r\nphrases we intend to designate familiarly as Nature all which exists\r\nindependently of our study, forethought and exertion--in other words,\r\nthose phenomena in ourselves or the world which we do not originate but\r\nfind; and we intend to designate familiarly as Art all which we do not\r\nfind but originate--or, in other words, the phenomena, which we add by\r\nstudy, forethought and exertion to those existing independently of us.\r\nBut we do not use these designations consistently. Sometimes we draw an\r\narbitrary line in the action of individuals and societies, and say, Here\r\nNature ends and Art begins--such a law, such a practice, such an\r\nindustry even, is natural, and such another is artificial; calling those\r\nnatural which happen spontaneously and without much reflection, and the\r\nothers artificial. But this line different observers draw at different\r\nplaces. Sometimes we adopt views which waive the distinction altogether.\r\nOne such view is that wherein all phenomena are regarded as equally\r\nnatural, and the idea of Nature is extended so as to include \"all the\r\npowers existing in either the outer or the inner world, and everything\r\nwhich exists by means of those powers.\" In this view Art becomes a part\r\nof Nature. It is illustrated in the familiar passage of Shakespeare,\r\nwhere Polixenes reminds Perdita that\r\n\r\n         \"Nature is made better by no mean,\r\n  But nature makes that mean: so, over that art\r\n  Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art\r\n  That nature makes.\" ...\r\n                          \"This is an art\r\n  Which does mend nature, change it rather, but\r\n  The art itself is nature.\"\r\n\r\nA posthumous essay of John Stuart Mill contains a full philosophical\r\nexposition and defence of this mode of regarding the relations of Nature\r\nand Art. Defining Nature as above, and again as a \"collective name for\r\nall facts, actual and possible,\" that writer proceeds to say that such a\r\ndefinition\r\n\r\n  \"is evidently inapplicable to some of the modes in which the word is\r\n  familiarly employed. For example, it entirely conflicts with the\r\n  common form of speech by which Nature is opposed to Art, and natural\r\n  to artificial. For in the sense of the word Nature which has thus been\r\n  defined, and which is the true scientific sense, Art is as much Nature\r\n  as anything else; and everything which is artificial is natural--Art\r\n  has no independent powers of its own: Art is but the employment of the\r\n  powers of Nature for an end. Phenomena produced by human agency no\r\n  less than those which, as far as we are concerned, are spontaneous,\r\n  depend on the properties of the elementary forces, or of the\r\n  elementary substances and their compounds. The united powers of the\r\n  whole human race could not create a new property of matter in general,\r\n  or of any one of its species. We can only take advantage for our\r\n  purposes of the properties we find. A ship floats by the same laws of\r\n  specific gravity and equilibrium as a tree uprooted by the wind and\r\n  blown into the water. The corn which men raise for food grows and\r\n  produces its grain by the same laws of vegetation by which the wild\r\n  rose and the mountain strawberry bring forth their flowers and fruit.\r\n  A house stands and holds together by the natural properties, the\r\n  weight and cohesion of the materials which compose it. A steam engine\r\n  works by the natural expansive force of steam, exerting a pressure\r\n  upon one part of a system of arrangements, which pressure, by the\r\n  mechanical properties of the lever, is transferred from that to\r\n  another part, where it raises the weight or removes the obstacle\r\n  brought into connexion with it. In these and all other artificial\r\n  operations the office of man is, as has often been remarked, a very\r\n  limited one; it consists of moving things into certain places. We move\r\n  objects, and by doing this, bring some things into contact which were\r\n  separate, or separate others which were in contact; and by this simple\r\n  change of place, natural forces previously dormant are called into\r\n  action, and produce the desired effect. Even the volition which\r\n  designs, the intelligence which contrives, and the muscular force\r\n  which executes these movements, are themselves powers of Nature.\"\r\n\r\nAnother mode of thought, in some sort complementary to the last, is\r\nbased on the analogy which the operations of forces external to a man\r\nbear to the operations of man himself. Study, forethought and exertion\r\nare assigned to Nature, and her operations are called operations of Art.\r\nThis view was familiar to ancient systems of philosophy, and especially\r\nto that of the Stoics. According to the report of Cicero, Nature as\r\nconceived by Zeno was a fire, and at the same time a voluntary agent\r\nhaving the power or art of creating things with regularity and design\r\n(\"naturam esse ignem artificiosum ad gignendum progredientem via\"). To\r\nthis fire not merely creative force and systematic action were\r\nascribed, but actual personality. Nature was \"non artificiosa solum, sed\r\nplane artifex.\" \"That which in the works of human art is done by hands,\r\nis done with much greater art by Nature, that is, by a fire which\r\nexercises an art and is the teacher of other arts.\" This conception of\r\nNature as an all-generating fire, and at the same time as a personal\r\nartist both teaching and including in her own activity all the human\r\narts, on the one hand may be said, with Polixenes and J.S. Mill, to\r\nmerge Art in Nature; but on the other hand it finds the essence of\r\nNature in the resemblance of her operations to those of Art. \"It is the\r\n_proprium_ of art,\" according to the same system, \"to create and beget,\"\r\nand the reasoning proceeds--Nature creates and begets, therefore Nature\r\nis an artist or Demiurgus. A kindred view is set forth by Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne in the _Religio Medici_, when he declares that \"all things are\r\nartificial; for Nature is the Art of God.\"\r\n\r\nBut these modes of thought, according to which, on the one hand, the\r\nprocesses of Art are included among processes of Nature, or on the other\r\nthe processes of Nature among the processes of Art, are exceptional. In\r\nordinary use the two conceptions, each of them somewhat vague and\r\ninexact, are antithetical. Their antithesis was what Dr Johnson had\r\nchiefly in his mind when he defined Art as \"the power of doing something\r\nwhich is not taught by Nature or by instinct.\" But this definition is\r\ninsufficient, because the abstract word Art, whether used of all arts at\r\nonce or of one at a time, is a name not only for the power of doing\r\nsomething, but for the exercise of the power; and not only for the\r\nexercise of the power, but for the rules according to which it is\r\nexercised; and not only for the rules, but for the result. Painting, for\r\ninstance, is an art, and the word connotes not only the power to paint,\r\nbut the act of painting; and not only the act, but the laws for\r\nperforming the act rightly; and not only all these, but the material\r\nconsequences of the act or the thing painted. So of agriculture,\r\nnavigation and the rest. Exception might also be taken to Dr Johnson's\r\ndefinition on the ground that it excludes all actions of instinct from\r\nthe genus Art, whereas usage has in more languages than one given the\r\nname of Art to several of those ingenuities in the lower animals which\r\npopular theory at the same time declares to be instinctive. Dante, for\r\ninstance, speaks of boughs shaken by the wind, but not so violently as\r\nto make the birds forgo their Art--\r\n\r\n      \"Non pero dal lor esser dritto sparte\r\n  Tanto, che gl' augelletti per le cime\r\n  Lasciasser d' operar ogni lor _arte_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Fontenelle, speaking in the language not of poetry but of\r\nscience:--\"Most animals--as, for instance, bees, spiders and\r\nbeavers--have a kind of art peculiar to themselves; but each race of\r\nanimals has no more than one art, and this one has had no first inventor\r\namong the race. Man, on the other hand, has an infinity of different\r\narts which were not born with his race, and of which the glory is his\r\nown.\" Dr Johnson might reply that those properties of variety and of\r\noriginality or individual invention, which Fontenelle himself alleges in\r\nthe ingenuities of man but not in those of the lower animals, are\r\nsufficient to make a generic difference, and to establish the\r\nimpropriety of calling a honeycomb or a spider's web a work of Art. It\r\nis not our purpose to trespass on ground so debateable as that of the\r\nnature of consciousness in the lower animals. Enough that when we use\r\nthe term Art of any action, it is because we are thinking of properties\r\nin the action from which we infer, whether justly or not, that the agent\r\nvoluntarily and designedly puts forth skill for known ends and by\r\nregular and uniform methods. If, then, we were called upon to frame a\r\ngeneral definition of Art, giving the word its widest and most\r\ncomprehensive meaning, it would run thus:--_Every regulated operation or\r\ndexterity by which organized beings pursue ends which they know\r\nbeforehand, together with the rules and the result of every such\r\noperation or dexterity_.\r\n\r\nHere it will be well to consider very briefly the natural history of the\r\nname which has been given to this very comprehensive conception by the\r\nprincipal branches of civilized mankind. Our own word Art the English\r\nlanguage has taken, as all the Romance languages of modern Europe have\r\ntaken theirs, directly from the Latin. The Latin _ars_, according to the\r\nprevailing opinion of philologists, proceeds from a root AR, of which\r\nthe primitive signification was to put or fit things together, and which\r\nis to be found in a large family of Greek words. The Greek [Greek:\r\ntechnae], the name both for arts in the particular and art in the\r\nabstract, is by its root related both to [Greek: tek-ton] and [Greek:\r\ntek-non], and thus contains the allied ideas of making and begetting.\r\nThe _proprium_ of art in the logic of the Stoics, \"to create and beget,\"\r\nwas strictly in accordance with this etymology. The Teutonic _Kunst_ is\r\nformed from _konnen_, and _konnen_ is developed from a primitive _Ich\r\nkann_. In _kann_ philology is inclined to recognize a preterite form of\r\na lost verb, of which we find the traces in _Kin-d_, a child; and the\r\nform _Ich kann_ thus meaning originally \"I begot,\" contains the germ of\r\nthe two several developments,--_konnen_, \"to be master,\" \"to be able,\"\r\nand _kennen_, \"to know.\" We thus see that the chief Indo-European\r\nlanguages have with one consent extended a name for the most elementary\r\nexercise of a constructive or productive power, till that name has\r\ncovered the whole range of the skilled and deliberate operations of\r\nsentient beings.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as men left out of sight the idea of creation, of\r\nconstructing or producing, \"artificiosum esse ad gignendum,\" which is\r\nthe primitive half of this extended notion, and attended only to the\r\nidea of skill, of proceeding by regular and disciplined methods,\r\n\"progredi via,\" which is the superadded half, the whole notion Art, and\r\nthe name for it, might become subject to a process of thought which, if\r\nanalysed, would be like this:--What is done by regular and disciplined\r\nmethods is Art; facts are observed and classified, and a systematic view\r\nof the order of the universe obtained, by regular and disciplined\r\nmethods; the observing and classifying of facts, and obtaining a\r\nsystematic view of the order of the universe, is therefore Art. To a\r\npartial extent this did unconsciously take place. Science, of which the\r\nessence is only in knowledge and theory, came to be spoken of as Art, of\r\nwhich the essence is all in practice and production. Cicero,\r\nnotwithstanding his citation of the Stoical dictum that practice and\r\nproduction were of the essence of Art, elsewhere divides Art into two\r\nkinds--one by which things are only contemplated in the mind, another by\r\nwhich something is produced and done. (\"Quumque artium aliud eiusmodi\r\nsit, ut tantummodo rem cernat; aliud, ut moliatur aliquid et\r\nfaciat.\"--_Acad_. ii. 7.) Of the former kind his instance is geometry;\r\nof the latter the art of playing on the lyre. Now geometry,\r\nunderstanding by geometry an acquisition of the mind, that is, a\r\ncollected body of observations and deductions concerning the properties\r\nof space and magnitude, is a science and not an art; although there is\r\nan art of the geometer, which is the skill by which he solves any given\r\nproblem in his science, and the rules of that skill, and his exertion in\r\nputting it forth. And so every science has its instrumental art or\r\npractical discipline; and in as far as the word Art is used only of the\r\npractical discipline or dexterity of the geometer, the astronomer, the\r\nlogician, the grammarian, or other person whose business it is to\r\ncollect and classify facts for contemplation, in so far the usage is\r\njust. The same justification may be extended to another usage, whereby\r\nin Latin, and some of its derivative languages, the name Art came to be\r\ntransferred in a concrete sense to the body of rules, the written code\r\nor manual, which lays down the discipline and regulates the dexterity;\r\nas _ars grammatica, ars logica, ars rhetorica_ and the rest. But when\r\nthe word is stretched so as to mean the sciences, as theoretical\r\nacquisitions of the mind, that meaning is illegitimate. Whether or not\r\nCicero, in the passage above quoted, had in his mind the science of\r\ngeometry as a collected body of observations and deductions, it is\r\ncertain that the Ciceronian phrase of the _liberal arts_, the _ingenuous\r\narts_, both in Latin and its derivatives or translations in modern\r\nspeech, has been used currently to denote the sciences themselves, and\r\nnot merely the disciplines instrumental to them. The _trivium_ and the\r\n_quadrivium_ (grammar, logic and rhetoric--geometry, astronomy, music\r\nand arithmetic) have been habitually called arts, when some of them have\r\nbeen named in that sense in which they mean not arts but sciences,\r\n\"only contemplating things in the mind.\" Hence the nomenclature, history\r\nand practical organization, especially in Britain, of one great division\r\nof university studies: the division of \"arts,\" with its \"faculty,\" its\r\nexaminations, and its degrees.\r\n\r\nIn the German language the words for Art and Science have in general\r\nbeen loosely interchanged. The etymology of the word for Art secured a\r\nlong continuance for this ambiguity. _Kunst_ was employed\r\nindiscriminately in both the senses of the primitive _Ich kann_, to\r\nsignify what I know, or Science, and what I can do, or Art. It was not\r\ntill the end of the 17th century that a separate word for Science, the\r\nmodern _Wissenschaft_, came into use. On the other hand, the Greek word\r\n[Greek: technae], with its distinct suggestion of the root signification\r\nto make or get, acted probably as a safeguard against this tendency. The\r\ndistinction between [Greek: technae], Art or practice, and [Greek:\r\nepistaemae], knowledge or Science, is observed, though not\r\nsystematically, in Greek philosophy. But for our present purpose, that\r\nof making clear the true relation between the one conception and the\r\nother, further quotation is rendered superfluous by the discussion the\r\nsubject has received at the hands of the modern writer already quoted.\r\nBetween Art, of which we practise the rules, and Science, of which we\r\nentertain the doctrines, J.S. Mill establishes the difference in the\r\nsimplest shape, by pointing out that one grammatical mood is proper for\r\nthe conclusions of Science, and another for those of Art. Science\r\nenunciates her conclusions in the indicative mood, whereas \"the\r\nimperative is the characteristic of Art, as distinguished from Science.\"\r\nAnd as Art utters her conclusions in her own form, so she supplies the\r\nsubstance of her own major premise.\r\n\r\n  \"Every art has one first principle, or general major premise, not\r\n  borrowed from science, that which enunciates the object aimed at, and\r\n  affirms it to be a desirable object. The builder's art assumes that it\r\n  is desirable to have buildings; architecture (as one of the fine arts)\r\n  that it is desirable to have them beautiful and imposing. The hygienic\r\n  and medical arts assume, the one that the preservation of health, the\r\n  other that the cure of disease, are fitting and desirable ends. These\r\n  are not propositions of science. Propositions of science assert a\r\n  matter of fact--an existence, a co-existence, a succession, or a\r\n  resemblance. The propositions now spoken of do not assert that\r\n  anything is, but enjoin or recommend that something should be. They\r\n  are a class by themselves. A proposition of which the predicate is\r\n  expressed by the words _ought_ or _should be_ is generically different\r\n  from one which is expressed by _is_ or _will be_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the logical relation of Art and Science, in other words, the manner\r\nof framing the intermediate member between the general major premise of\r\nArt and its imperative conclusion, is thus defined:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Art [in any given case] proposes to itself an end to be attained,\r\n  defines the end, and hands it over to the Science. The Science\r\n  receives it, considers it as a phenomenon or effect to be studied, and\r\n  having investigated its causes and conditions, sends it back to Art\r\n  with a theorem of the causes and combinations by which it could be\r\n  produced. Art then examines these combinations of circumstances, and\r\n  according as any of them are or are not in human power, pronounces the\r\n  end attainable or not. The only one of the premises, therefore, which\r\n  Art supplies, is the original major premise, which asserts that the\r\n  attainment of the given end is desirable. Science, then, lends to Art\r\n  the proposition (obtained by a series of inductions or deductions)\r\n  that the performance of certain actions will attain the end. From\r\n  these premises Art concludes that the performance of these actions is\r\n  desirable, and finding it also practicable, converts the theorem into\r\n  a rule or precept.... The grounds, then, of every rule of Art are to\r\n  be found in the theorems of Science. An Art, or a body of Art,\r\n  consists of the rules, together with as much of the speculative\r\n  propositions as comprises the justification of these rules. The\r\n  complete Art of any matter includes a selection of such a portion from\r\n  the Science as is necessary to show on what conditions the effects,\r\n  which the Art aims at producing, depend. And Art in general consists\r\n  of the truths of Science arranged in the most convenient order for\r\n  practice, instead of the order which is most convenient for thought.\r\n  Science groups and arranges its truths so as to enable us to take in\r\n  at one view as much as possible of the general order of the universe.\r\n  Art, though it must assume the same general laws, follows them only\r\n  into such of their detailed consequences as have led to the formation\r\n  of rules of conduct, and brings together from parts of the field of\r\n  Science most remote from one another, the truths relating to the\r\n  production of the different and heterogeneous causes necessary to each\r\n  effect which the exigencies of practical life require to be\r\n  produced.\"--(Mill's _Logic_, vol. ii. pp. 542-549).\r\n\r\nThe whole discussion may be summed up thus. Science consists in knowing,\r\nArt consists in doing. What I must do in order to know, is Art\r\nsubservient to Science: what I must know in order to do, is Science\r\nsubservient to Art.\r\n\r\nArt, then, is defined by two broad distinctions: first, its popular\r\ndistinction from Nature; and next, its practical and theoretic\r\ndistinction from Science. Both of these distinctions are observed in the\r\nterms of our definition given above. Within the proper limits of this\r\ndefinition, the conception of Art, and the use of the word for it, have\r\nundergone sundry variations. These variations correspond to certain\r\nvicissitudes or developments in the order of historical facts and in\r\nsociety. The requirements of society, stimulating the ingenuity of its\r\nindividual members, have led to the invention of arts and groups of\r\narts, constantly progressing, with the progress of civilization, in\r\nnumber, in complexity, and in resource. The religious imagination of\r\nearly societies, who find themselves in possession of such an art or\r\ngroup of arts, forgets the history of the invention, and assigns it to\r\nthe inspiration or special grace of some god or hero. So the Greeks\r\nassigned the arts of agriculture to Triptolemus, those of spinning and\r\nnavigation to Athena, and of music to Apollo. At one stage of\r\ncivilization one art or group of arts is held in higher esteem, another\r\nat another. In societies, like most of those of the ancient world, where\r\nslaves were employed in domestic service, and upon the handicrafts\r\nsupplying the immediate utilities of life--food, shelter and\r\nclothing--these constituted a group of servile arts. The arts of\r\nhusbandry or agriculture, on the other hand, have alternately been\r\nregarded as servile and as honourable according as their exercise has\r\nbeen in the hands of a subject class, as under feudal institutions, or,\r\nas under the Roman republic, of free cultivators. Under feudal\r\ninstitutions, or in a society in a state of permanent war, the allied\r\narts of war and of government have been held the only honourable class.\r\nIn commercial states, like the republics of Italy, the arts of gain, or\r\nof production (other than agricultural) and distribution, have made good\r\ntheir title to equal estimation and greater power beside the art of\r\ncaptains. But among peaceful arts, industries or trades, some have\r\nalways been held to be of higher and others of lower rank; the higher\r\nrank being assigned to those that required larger operations, higher\r\ntraining, or more thoughtful conduct, and yielded ampler returns--the\r\nlower rank to those which called for simple manual exercise, especially\r\nif such exercise was of a disagreeable or degrading kind. In the cities\r\nof Italy, where both commerce and manufactures were for the first time\r\norganized on a considerable scale, the name _arte_, Art, was retained to\r\ndesignate the gilds or corporations by which the several industries were\r\nexercised; and, according to the nature of the industry, the art was\r\nclassed as higher or lower (_maggiore_ and _minore_).\r\n\r\nThe arts of which we have hitherto spoken have arisen from positive\r\nrequirements, and supply what are strictly utilities, in societies; not\r\nexcluding the art of war, at least so far as concerns one-half of war,\r\nthe defensive half. But war continued to be an honourable pursuit,\r\nbecause it was a pursuit associated with birth, power and wealth, as\r\nwell as with the virtue of courage, in cases where it had no longer the\r\nplea of utility, but was purely aggressive or predatory; and the arts of\r\nthe chase have stood in this respect in an analogous position to those\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nThere are other arts which have not had their origin in positive\r\npractical needs, but have been practised from the first for pleasure or\r\namusement. The most primitive human beings of whom we have any\r\nknowledge, the cave-dwellers of the palaeolithic period, had not only\r\nthe useful art of chipping stones into spear-heads, knife-heads and\r\narrow-heads, and making shafts or handles of these implements out of\r\nbone; they had also the ornamental art of scratching upon the bone\r\nhandle the outlines of the animals they saw--mammoth, rhinoceros or\r\nreindeer--or of carving such a handle into a rude resemblance of one of\r\nthese animals. Here we have a skill exercised, in the first case, for\r\npure fancy or pleasure, and in the second, for adding an element of\r\nfancy or pleasure to an element of utility. Here, therefore, is the\r\ngerm of all those arts which produce imitations of natural objects for\r\npurposes of entertainment or delight, as painting, sculpture, and their\r\nsubordinates; and of all those which fashion useful objects in one way\r\nrather than another because the one way gives pleasure and the other\r\ndoes not, as architecture and the subordinate decorative arts of\r\nfurniture, pottery and the rest. Arts that work in a kindred way with\r\ndifferent materials are those of dancing and music. Dancing works with\r\nthe physical movements of human beings. Music works with sound. Between\r\nthat imitative and plastic group, and the group of these which only\r\nproduce motion or sound and pass away, there is the intermediate group\r\nof eloquence and the drama, which deal with the expression of human\r\nfeeling in spoken words and acted gestures. There is also the\r\ncomprehensive art of poetry, which works with the material of written\r\nwords, and can ideally represent the whole material of human life and\r\nexperience. Of all these arts the end is not use but pleasure, or\r\npleasure before use, or at least pleasure and use conjointly. In modern\r\nlanguage, there has grown up a usage which has put them into a class by\r\nthemselves under the name of the Fine Arts, as distinguished from the\r\nUseful or Mechanical Arts. (See AESTHETICS and FINE ARTS.) Nay more, to\r\nthem alone is often appropriated the use of the generic word Art, as if\r\nthey and they only were the arts [Greek: katexochin]. And further yet,\r\ncustom has reduced the number which the class-word is meant to include.\r\nWhen Art and the works of Art are now currently spoken of in this sense,\r\nnot even music or poetry is frequently denoted, but only architecture,\r\nsculpture and painting by themselves, or with their subordinate and\r\ndecorative branches. In correspondence with this usage, another usage\r\nhas removed from the class of _arts_, and put into a contrasted class of\r\n_manufactures_, a large number of industries and their products, to\r\nwhich the generic term Art, according to our definition, properly\r\napplies. The definition covers the _mechanical_ arts, which can be\r\nefficiently exercised by mere trained habit, rote or calculation, just\r\nas well as the fine arts, which have to be exercised by a higher order\r\nof powers. But the word Art, becoming appropriated to the fine arts, has\r\nbeen treated as if it necessarily carried along with it, and as if works\r\nto be called works of art must necessarily possess, the attributes of\r\nfree individual skill and invention, expressing themselves in ever new\r\ncombinations of pleasurable contrivance, and seeking perfection not as a\r\nmeans towards some ulterior practical end but as an ideal end in itself.\r\n     (S. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTA (_Narda_, i.e. [Greek: en Arda], or _Zarta_, i.e. [Greek: eis\r\nArta]), a town of Greece, in the province of Arta, 59 m. N.N.W. of\r\nMesolonghi. Pop. about 7000. It is built on the site of the ancient\r\nAmbracia (q.v.), its present designation being derived from a corruption\r\nof the name of the river Arachthus (Arta) on which it stands. This\r\nenters the Gulf of Arta some distance south of the town. The river forms\r\nthe frontier between Greece and Turkey, and is crossed by a picturesque\r\nbridge, which is neutral ground. There are a few remains of old\r\ncyclopean walls. The town contains also a Byzantine castle, built on the\r\nlofty site of the ancient citadel; a palace belonging to the Greek\r\nmetropolitan; a number of mosques, synagogues and churches, the most\r\nremarkable being the church of the Virgin of Consolation, founded in\r\n819. The streets of the town were widened and improved in 1869.\r\nManufacture of woollens, cottons, Russia leather and embroidery is\r\ncarried on, and there is trade in cattle, wine, tobacco, hemp, hides and\r\ngrain. Much of the neighbouring plain is very fertile, and the town is\r\nsurrounded with gardens and orchards, in which orange, lemon and citron\r\ncome to great perfection. In 1083 Arta was taken by Bohemund of\r\nTarentum; in 1449 by the Turks; in 1688 by the Venetians. In 1797 it was\r\nheld by the French, but in the following year, 1798, Ali Pasha of\r\nIannina captured it. During the Greek War of Independence it suffered\r\nseverely, and was the scene of several conflicts, in which the ultimate\r\nsuccess was with the Turks. An insurrection in 1854 was at once\r\nrepressed. It was ceded to Greece in 1881. In the Greco-Turkish War of\r\n1897 the Greeks gained some temporary successes at Arta during April and\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTA, GULF OF (anc. _Sinus Ambracius_), an inlet of the Ionian Sea, 25\r\nm. long and 10 broad, most of the northern shores of which belong to\r\nTurkey, the southern and eastern to Greece. Its only important affluent,\r\nbesides the Arta, is the Luro (anc. _Charadra_), also from the north.\r\nThe gulf abounds with mullets, soles and eels. Around its shores are\r\nnumerous ruins of ancient cities: Actium at the entrance, where the\r\nfamous battle was fought in 31 B.C.; Nicopolis, Argos, Limnaea and\r\nOlpae; and several flourishing towns, such as Preveza, Arta (anc.\r\n_Ambracia_), Karavasara or Karbasaras, and Vonitza.\r\n\r\nThe river ARTA (anc. _Arachthus_ or _Aratthus_, in Livy xxxviii. 3,\r\n_Aretho_) is the chief river of Epirus, and is said to have been\r\nnavigable in ancient times as far as Ambracia. Below this town it flows\r\nthrough a marshy plain, consisting mainly of its own alluvium; its upper\r\ncourse is through the territory of the Molossians; its total length is\r\nabout 80 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTABANUS, the name of a number of Persian princes, soldiers and\r\nadministrators. The most important are the following:--\r\n\r\n1. Brother of Darius I., and, according to Herodotus, the trusted\r\nadviser of his nephew Xerxes. Herodotus makes him a principal figure in\r\nepic dialogues: he warns Darius not to attack the Scythians (iv. 83; cf.\r\nalso iv. 143), and predicts to Xerxes his defeat by the Greeks (vii. 10\r\nff., 46 ff.); Xerxes sent him home to govern the empire during the\r\ncampaign (vii. 52, 53).\r\n\r\n2. Vizier of Xerxes (Ctesias, _Pers_. 20), whom he murdered in 465 B.C.\r\nAccording to Aristotle, _Pol_. v. 1311 b, he had previously killed\r\nXerxes' son Darius, and was afraid that the father would avenge him;\r\naccording to Ctesias, _Pers_. 29, Justin iii. 1, Diod. xi. 69, he killed\r\nXerxes first and then pretended that Darius had murdered him, and\r\ninstigated his brother Artaxerxes to avenge the parricide. At all\r\nevents, during the first months of the reign of Artaxerxes I., he was\r\nthe ruling power in the state (therefore the chronographers wrongly\r\nreckon him as king, with a reign of seven months), until Artaxerxes,\r\nhaving learned the truth about the murder of his father and his brother,\r\noverwhelmed and killed Artabanus and his sons in open fight.\r\n\r\n3. A satrap of Bactria, who revolted against Artaxerxes I., but was\r\ndefeated in two battles (Ctes. _Pers_. 31).\r\n\r\nThe name was borne also by four Parthian kings. The Parthian king\r\nArsaces, who was attacked by Antiochus III. in 209, has been called\r\nArtabanus by some modern authors without any reason.\r\n\r\n4. ARTABANUS I., successor of his nephew Phraates II. about 127 B.C.,\r\nperished in a battle against the Tochari, a Mongolian tribe, which had\r\ninvaded the east of Iran (Justin xli. 2). He is perhaps identical with\r\nthe Artabanus mentioned in Trogus, Prol. xlii.\r\n\r\n5. ARTABANUS II. c. A.D. 10-40, son of an Arsacid princess (Tac. _Ann_.\r\nvi. 48), lived in the East among the Dahan nomads. He was raised to the\r\nthrone by those Parthian grandees who would not acknowledge Vonones I.,\r\nwhom Augustus had sent from Rome (where he lived as hostage) as\r\nsuccessor of his father Phraates IV. The war between the two pretenders\r\nwas long and doubtful; on a coin Vonones mentions a victory over\r\nArtabanus. At last Artabanus defeated his rival completely and occupied\r\nCtesiphon; Vonones fled to Armenia, where he was acknowledged as king,\r\nunder the protection of the Romans. But when Artabanus invaded Armenia,\r\nVonones fled to Syria, and the emperor Tiberius thought it prudent to\r\nsupport him no longer. Germanicus, whom he sent to the East, concluded a\r\ntreaty with Artabanus, in which he was recognized as king and friend of\r\nthe Romans. Armenia was given (A.D. 18) to Zeno, the son of the king of\r\nPontus (Tac. _Ann_. ii. 3 f., 58; Joseph. _Ant_. 18. 24).\r\n\r\nArtabanus II., like all Parthian princes, was much troubled by the\r\nopposition of the grandees. He is said to have been very cruel in\r\nconsequence of his education among the Dahan barbarians (Tac. _Ann_. vi.\r\n41). To strengthen his power he killed all the Arsacid princes whom he\r\ncould reach (Tac. _Ann_. vi. 31). Rebellions of the subject nations may\r\nhave occurred also. We learn that he intervened in the Greek city\r\nSeleucia in favour of the oligarchs (Tac. _Ann_. vi. 48), and that two\r\nJewish brigands maintained themselves for years in Neerda in the swamps\r\nof Babylonia, and were acknowledged as dynasts by Artabanus (Jos. _Ant._\r\n18. 9). In A.D. 35 he tried anew to conquer Armenia, and to establish\r\nhis son Arsaces as king there. A war with Rome seemed inevitable. But\r\nthat party among the Parthian magnates which was hostile to Artabanus\r\napplied to Tiberius for a king of the race of Phraates. Tiberius sent\r\nPhraates's grandson, Tiridates III., and ordered L. Vitellius (the\r\nfather of the emperor) to restore the Roman authority in the East. By\r\nvery dexterous military and diplomatic operations Vitellius succeeded\r\ncompletely. Artabanus was deserted by his followers and fled to the\r\nEast. Tiridates, who was proclaimed king, could no longer maintain\r\nhimself, because he appeared to be a vassal of the Romans; Artabanus\r\nreturned from Hyrcania with a strong army of Scythian (Dahan)\r\nauxiliaries, and was again acknowledged by the Parthians. Tiridates left\r\nSeleucia and fled to Syria. But Artabanus was not strong enough for a\r\nwar with Rome; he therefore concluded a treaty with Vitellius, in which\r\nhe gave up all further pretensions (A.D. 37). A short time afterwards\r\nArtabanus was deposed again, and a certain Cinnamus was proclaimed king.\r\nArtabanus took refuge with his vassal, the king Izates, of Adiabene; and\r\nIzates by negotiations and the promise of a complete pardon induced the\r\nParthians to restore Artabanus once more to the throne (Jos. _Ant._ 20.\r\n3). Shortly afterwards Artabanus died, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nVardanes, whose reign was still more turbulent than that of his father.\r\n\r\n6. ARTABANUS III. reigned a short time in A.D. 80 (on a coin of this\r\nyear he calls himself Arsaces Artabanus) and the following years, and\r\nsupported a pretender who rose in Asia Minor under the name of Nero\r\n(Zonaras xi. 18), but could not maintain himself against Pacorus II.\r\n\r\n7. ARTABANUS IV., the last Parthian king, younger son of Vologaeses IV.,\r\nwho died A.D. 209. He rebelled against his brother Vologaeses V. (Dio\r\nCass. vii. 12), and soon obtained the upper hand, although Vologaeses V.\r\nmaintained himself in a part of Babylonia till about A.D. 222. The\r\nemperor Caracalla, wishing to make use of this civil war for a conquest\r\nof the East in imitation of his idol, Alexander the Great, attacked the\r\nParthians in 216. He crossed the Tigris, destroyed the towns and spoiled\r\nthe tombs of Arbela; but when Artabanus advanced at the head of an army,\r\nhe retired to Carrhae. There he was murdered by Macrinus in April 217.\r\nMacrinus was defeated at Nisibis and concluded a peace with Artabanus,\r\nin which he gave up all the Roman conquests, restored the booty, and\r\npaid a heavy contribution to the Parthians (Dio Cass. lxxviii. 26 f.).\r\nBut at the same time, the Persian dynast Ardashir (q.v.) had already\r\nbegun his conquests in Persia and Carmania. When Artabanus tried to\r\nsubdue him his troops were defeated. The war lasted several years; at\r\nlast Artabanus himself was vanquished and killed (A.D. 226), and the\r\nrule of the Arsacids came to an end.\r\n\r\n  See further PERSIA: History, S ancient, and works there quoted.\r\n       (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART AND PART, a term used in Scots law to denote the aiding or abetting\r\nin the perpetration of a crime,--the being an accessory before or at the\r\nperpetration of the crime. There is no such offence recognized in\r\nScotland as that of being an accessory after the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTAPHERNES, more correctly ARTAPHRENES, brother of Darius Hystaspis,\r\nand satrap of Sardis. It was he who received the embassy from Athens\r\nsent probably by Cleisthenes (q.v.) in 507 B.C., and subsequently warned\r\nthe Athenians to receive back the \"tyrant\" Hippias. Subsequently he took\r\nan important part in suppressing the Ionian revolt (see IONIA,\r\nARISTAGORAS, HISTIAEUS), and after the war compelled the cities to make\r\nagreements by which all differences were to be settled by reference. He\r\nalso measured out their territories in parasangs and assessed their\r\ntributes accordingly (Herod, vi. 42). In 492 he was superseded in his\r\nsatrapy by Mardonius (Herodotus v. 25, 30-32, 35, &c.; Diod. Sic. x.\r\n25). His son, of the same name, was appointed (490), together with\r\nDatis, to take command of the expedition sent by Darius to punish Athens\r\nand Eretria for their share in the Ionian revolt. After the defeat of\r\nMarathon he returned to Asia. In the expedition of Xerxes, ten years\r\nlater, he was in command of the Lydians and Mysians (Herod, vi. 94, 119;\r\nvii. 74, Aesch. _Persae_, 21).\r\n\r\nAeschylus in his list of Persian kings (_Persae_, 775 ff.), which is\r\nquite unhistorical, mentions two kings with the name Artaphrenes, who\r\nmay have been developed out of these two Persian commanders. (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTAXERXES, a name representing Pers. _Artakhshatra_, \"he whose empire\r\nis well-fitted\" or \"perfected\", Heb. _Artakhshasta_, Bab. _Artakshatsu_,\r\nSusian _Irtakshashsha_ (and variants), Gr. [Greek: Artaxerxes], [Greek:\r\nArtoxerxes], and in an inscription of Tralles (Dittenberger, _Sylloge_,\r\n573) [Greek: Artaxerres]; Herodotus (vi. 98) gives the translation\r\n[Greek: megas areios], and considers the name as a compound of Xerxes,\r\nshowing thereby that he knew nothing of the Persian language; the later\r\nPersian form is _Ardashir_, which occurs in the form Artaxias (Artaxes)\r\nas the name of some kings of Armenia. It was borne by three kings of the\r\nAchaemenian dynasty of ancient Persia; though, so long as its meaning\r\nwas understood, it can have been adopted by the kings only after their\r\naccession to the throne.\r\n\r\n1. ARTAXERXES I., surnamed _Macrocheir, Longimanus_, \"Longhand,\" because\r\nhis right hand was longer than his left (Plut. _Artax._ i.). He was the\r\nyounger son of Xerxes, and was raised to the throne in 465 by the vizier\r\nArtabanus, the murderer of his father. After a few months he became\r\naware of the crimes of the vizier, and slew him and his sons in a\r\nhand-to-hand fight in the palace. His reign was, on the whole, peaceful;\r\nthe empire had reached a period of stagnation. Plutarch (_Artax._ i.)\r\nsays that he was famous for his mild and magnanimous character, Nepos\r\n(_de Reg._ i.) that he was exceedingly beautiful and valiant. From the\r\nauthentic report of his cup-bearer Nehemiah we see that he was a kind,\r\ngood-natured, but rather weak monarch, and he was undoubtedly much under\r\nthe baneful influence of his mother Amestris (for whose mischievous\r\ncharacter cf. Herod. ix. 109 ff.) and his sister and wife Amytis. The\r\npeacefulness of his rule was interrupted by several insurrections. At\r\nthe very beginning the satrap Artabanus raised a rebellion in Bactria,\r\nbut was defeated in two battles. More dangerous was the rebellion of\r\nEgypt under Inarus (Inaros), which was put down by Megabyzus only after\r\na long struggle against the Egyptians and the Athenians (460-454). Out\r\nof it sprang the rebellion of Megabyzus, who was greatly exasperated\r\nbecause, though he had persuaded Inarus to surrender by promising that\r\nhis life would be spared, Artaxerxes, yielding to the entreaties of his\r\nwife Amytis, who wanted to take revenge on Inarus for the death of her\r\nbrother Achaemenes, the satrap of Egypt, had surrendered him to her for\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his weakness, Artaxerxes I. was not unsuccessful in his\r\npolity. In 448 the war with Athens was terminated by the treaty\r\nconcluded by Callias (but see CALLIAS and CIMON), by which the Athenians\r\nleft Cyprus and Egypt to the Persians, while Persia gave up nothing of\r\nher rights, but promised not to make use of them against the Greek\r\ncities on the Asiatic coast, which had gained their liberty (Ed. Meyer,\r\n_Forschungen zur alt. Gesch._ ii. 71 ff.). In the Samian and the\r\nPeloponnesian wars, Artaxerxes remained neutral, in spite of the\r\nattempts made by both Sparta and Athens to gain his alliance.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Artaxerxes I. the Jewish religion was definitely\r\nestablished and sanctioned by law in Jerusalem, on the basis of a firman\r\ngranted by the king to the Babylonian priest Ezra in his seventh year,\r\n458 B.C., and the appointment of his cup-bearer Nehemiah as governor of\r\nJudaea in his twentieth year, 445 B.C. The attempts which have been made\r\nto deny the authenticity of those parts of the books of Ezra and\r\nNehemiah which contain an account of these two men, taken from their own\r\nmemoirs, or to place them in the reign of Artaxerxes II., are not\r\nconvincing (cf. Ed. Meyer, _Die Entstehung des Judentums_, 1896; see\r\nfurther JEWS, SS 19, 21, 22; EZRA AND NEHEMIAH).\r\n\r\nArtaxerxes I. died in December 425, or January 424 (Thuc. iv. 50). To\r\nhis reign must belong the famous quadrilingual alabaster vases from\r\nEgypt (on which his name is written in Persian, Susian and Babylonian\r\ncuneiform characters and in hieroglyphics), for Artaxerxes II. and III.\r\ndid not possess Egypt. A great many tablets, dated from his reign, have\r\nbeen found in Nippur (published by H. von Hilprecht and Clay, _The\r\nBabylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania_, series A, vol.\r\nix.), and a few others at other places in Babylonia. Inscriptions of the\r\nking himself are not extant; his grandson mentions his buildings in\r\nSusa. For the suggested identification of Artaxerxes I. with the\r\nBiblical Ahasuerus, see AHASUERUS.\r\n\r\n2. ARTAXERXES II., surnamed _Mnemon_, the eldest son of Darius II., whom\r\nhe succeeded in the spring of 404. According to Ctesias (_Pers._ 57;\r\nPlut. _Artax._ i.) he was formerly called Arsaces or Arsikas, whereas\r\nDinon (Plut. _Artax._ i.) calls him Oarses. This is corroborated by a\r\nBabylonian tablet with observations of the moon (Brit. Mus. Sp. ii. 749;\r\n_Zeitsch. f. Assyriologie_, vii. 223), which is dated from the 26th year\r\nof \"Arshu, who is Artakshatsu,\" i.e. 379 B.C. (cp. Ed. Meyer,\r\n_Forschungen zur allen Geschichte_, ii. 466 ff.). When Artaxerxes II.\r\nmounted the throne, the power of Athens had been broken by Lysander, and\r\nthe Greek towns in Asia were again subjects of the Persian empire. But\r\nhis whole reign is a time of continuous decay; the original force of the\r\nPersians had been exhausted in luxury and intrigues, and the king,\r\nthough personally brave and good-natured, was quite dependent upon his\r\nfavourites and his harem, and especially upon his mother Parysatis. In\r\nthe beginning of his reign falls the rebellion of his brother Cyrus, who\r\nwas secretly favoured by Parysatis and by Sparta. Although Cyrus was\r\ndefeated at Cunaxa, this rebellion was disastrous inasmuch as it opened\r\nto the Greeks the way into the interior of the empire, and demonstrated\r\nthat no oriental force was able to withstand a band of well-trained\r\nGreek soldiers. Subsequently Greek mercenaries became indispensable not\r\nonly to the king but also to the satraps, who thereby gained the means\r\nfor attempting successful rebellions, into which they were provoked by\r\nthe weakness of the king, and by the continuous intrigues between the\r\nPersian magnates. The reign is, therefore, a continuous succession of\r\nrebellions. Egypt soon revolted anew and could not be subdued again.\r\nWhen in 399 war broke out between Sparta and Persia, the Persian troops\r\nin Asia Minor were quite unable to resist the Spartan armies. The active\r\nand energetic Persian general Pharnabazus succeeded in creating a fleet\r\nby the help of Evagoras, king of Salamis in Cyprus, and the Athenian\r\ncommander Conon, and destroyed the Spartan fleet at Cnidus (August 394).\r\nThis victory enabled the Greek allies of Persia (Thebes, Athens, Argos,\r\nCorinth) to carry on the Corinthian war against Sparta, and the Spartans\r\nhad to give up the war in Asia Minor. But it soon became evident that\r\nthe only gainers by the war were the Athenians, who in 389, under\r\nThrasybulus, tried to found their old empire anew (see DELIAN LEAGUE).\r\nAt the same time Evagoras attempted to conquer the whole of Cyprus, and\r\nwas soon in open rebellion. The consequence was that, when in 388 the\r\nSpartan admiral Antalcidas (q.v.) came to Susa, the king was induced to\r\nconclude a peace with Sparta by which Asia fell to him and European\r\nGreece to Sparta. After the peace, Evagoras was attacked. He lost his\r\nconquests, but had to be recognized as independent king of Salamis (380\r\nB.C.). Two expeditions against Egypt (385-383 and 374-372) ended in\r\ncomplete failure. At the same period there were continuous rebellions in\r\nAsia Minor; Pisidia, Paphlagonia, Bithynia and Lycia, threw off the\r\nPersian yoke and Hecatomnus, the satrap of Caria, obtained an almost\r\nindependent position. Similar wars were going on against the mountain\r\ntribes of Armenia and Iran, especially against the Cadusians on the\r\nCaspian Sea. In this war Artaxerxes is said to have distinguished\r\nhimself personally (380 B.C.), but got into such difficulties in the\r\nwild country that he was glad when Tiribazus succeeded in concluding a\r\npeace with the Cadusian chieftains.\r\n\r\nBy the peace of Antalcidas the Persian supremacy was proclaimed over\r\nGreece; and in the following wars all parties, Spartans, Athenians,\r\nThebans, Argives continually applied to Persia for a decision in their\r\nfavour. After the battle of Leuctra, when the power of Thebes was\r\nfounded by Epaminondas, Pelopidas went to Susa (367) and restored the\r\nold alliance between Persia and Thebes. The Persian supremacy, however,\r\nwas not based upon the power of the empire, but only on the discord of\r\nthe Greeks. Shortly after the edict by which the king had proclaimed his\r\nalliance with Thebes, and the conditions of the general peace which he\r\nwas going to impose upon Greece, his weakness became evident, for since\r\n366 all the satraps of Asia Minor (Datames, Ariobarzanes, Mausolus,\r\nOrontes, Artabazus) were in rebellion again, in close alliance with\r\nAthens, Sparta and Egypt. The king could do little against them; even\r\nAutophradates, satrap of Lydia, who had remained faithful, was forced\r\nfor some time to unite himself with the rebels. But every one of the\r\nallies mistrusted all the others; and the sole object of every satrap\r\nwas to improve his condition and his personal power, and to make a\r\nfavourable peace with the king, for which his neighbours and former\r\nallies had to pay the costs. The rebellion was at last put down by a\r\nseries of treacheries and perfidious negotiations. Some of the rebels\r\nretained their provinces; others were punished, as opportunity offered.\r\nMithradates betrayed his own father Ariobarzanes, who was crucified, and\r\nmurdered Datames, to whom he had introduced himself as a faithful ally.\r\nWhen the long reign of Artaxerxes II. came to its close in the autumn of\r\n359 the authority of the empire had been restored almost everywhere.\r\n\r\nArtaxerxes himself had done very little to obtain this result. In fact,\r\nin the last years of his reign he had sunk into a perfect dotage. All\r\nhis time was spent in the pleasures of his harem, the intrigues of which\r\nwere further complicated by his falling in love with and marrying his\r\nown daughter Atossa (according to the Persian religion a marriage\r\nbetween the nearest relations is no incest). At the same time, his sons\r\nwere quarrelling about the succession; one of them, Ochus, induced the\r\nfather by a series of intrigues to condemn to death three of his older\r\nbrothers, who stood in his way. Shortly afterwards, Artaxerxes II. died.\r\n\r\nIn this reign an important innovation took place in the Persian\r\nreligion. Berossus (in Clemens Alex. _Protrept._ i. 5. 65) tells us that\r\nthe Persians knew of no images of the gods until Artaxerxes II. erected\r\nimages of Anaitis in Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, Bactra,\r\nDamascus, Sardis. This statement is proved correct by the inscriptions;\r\nall the former kings name only Auramazda (Ahuramazda), but Artaxerxes\r\nII. in his building inscriptions from Susa and Ecbatana invokes\r\nAhuramazda, Anahita and Mithra. These two gods belonged to the old\r\npopular religion of the Iranians, but had until then been neglected by\r\nthe true Zoroastrians; now they were introduced into the official\r\nworship much in the way in which the cult of the saints came into the\r\nChristian religion. About the history of Artaxerxes II. we are\r\ncomparatively well informed from Greek sources; for the earlier part of\r\nhis reign from Ctesias and Xenophon (_Anabasis_), for the later times\r\nfrom Dinon of Ephesus, the historian of the Persians (from whom the\r\naccount of Justin is derived), from Ephorus (whose account is quoted by\r\nDiodorus) and others. Upon these sources is based the biography of the\r\nking by Plutarch.\r\n\r\n3. ARTAXERXES III. is the title adopted by Ochus, the son of Artaxerxes\r\nII., when he succeeded his father in 359. The chronographers generally\r\nretain the name Ochus, and in the Babylonian inscriptions he is called\r\n\"Umasu, who is called Artakshatsu.\" The same form of the name (probably\r\npronounced Uvasu) occurs in the Syrian version of the canon of Ptolemy\r\nby Elias of Nisibis (Amos).\r\n\r\nArtaxerxes III. was a cruel but an energetic ruler. To secure his throne\r\nhe put to death almost all his relatives, but he suppressed the\r\nrebellions also. In 356 he ordered all the satraps to dismiss their\r\nmercenaries. Most of them obeyed; Artabazus of Phrygia, who tried to\r\nresist and was supported by his brothers-in-law, Mentor and Memnon of\r\nRhodes, was defeated and fled to Philip of Macedon. Athens, whose\r\ngeneral Chares had supported Artabazus, was by the threatening messages\r\nof the king forced to conclude peace, and to acknowledge the\r\nindependence of its rebellious allies (355 B.C.). Then the king\r\nattempted to subjugate Egypt, but two expeditions were unsuccessful,\r\nand, in consequence, Sidon and the other Phoenician towns, and the\r\nprinces of Cyprus, rebelled against Persia and defeated the Persian\r\ngenerals. After great preparations the king came in person, but again\r\nthe attack on Egypt was repelled by the Greek generals of Nectanebus\r\n(346). One or two years later Artaxerxes, at the head of a great army,\r\nbegan the siege of Sidon. The Sidonian king Tennes considered resistance\r\nhopeless, and betrayed the town to the Persian king, assisted by Mentor,\r\nwho had been sent with Greek troops from Egypt to defend the town.\r\nArtaxerxes repressed the rebellion with great cruelty and destroyed the\r\ntown. The traitor Tennes was put to death, but Mentor rose high in the\r\nfavour of the king, and entered into a close alliance with the eunuch\r\nBagoas, the king's favourite and vizier. They succeeded in subjecting\r\nthe other rebels, and, after a hard fight at Pelusium, and many\r\nintrigues, conquered Egypt (343); Nectanebus fled to Ethiopia.\r\nArtaxerxes used his victory with great cruelty; he plundered the\r\nEgyptian temples and is said to have killed the Apis. After his return\r\nto Susa, Bagoas ruled the court and the upper satrapies, while Mentor\r\nrestored the authority of the empire everywhere in the west. He deposed\r\nor killed many Greek dynasts, among them the famous Hermias of Atarneus,\r\nthe protector of Aristotle, who had friendly relations with Philip (342\r\nB.C.). When Philip attacked Perinthus and Byzantium (340), Artaxerxes\r\nsent them support, by which they were enabled to withstand the\r\nMacedonians; Philip's antagonists in Greece, Demosthenes and his party,\r\nhoped to get subsidies from the king, but were disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn 338 Artaxerxes III., with his older sons, was killed by Bagoas, who\r\nraised his youngest son Arses to the throne. Artaxerxes III. is said\r\nnever to have entered the country of Persia proper, because, being a\r\ngreat miser, he would not pay the present of a gold piece for every\r\nPersian woman, which it was usual to give on such occasions (Plut.\r\n_Alex._ 69). But we have a building inscription from Persepolis, which\r\ncontains his name and genealogy, and invocations of Ahuramazda and\r\nMithra.\r\n\r\n  For the relations of Artaxerxes I.--III. with the Jews see JEWS, SS\r\n  19-21. For bibliographical references see PERSIA: _Ancient History_.\r\n\r\n  The name Artaxerxes was adopted by Bessus when he proclaimed himself\r\n  king after the assassination of Darius III. It was borne by several\r\n  dynasts of Persis, when it formed an independent kingdom in the time\r\n  of the Parthian empire (on their coins they call themselves\r\n  Artakhshathr; one of them is mentioned by Lucian, _Macrobii_, 15), and\r\n  by three kings of the Sassanid dynasty, who are better known under the\r\n  modern form Ardashir (q.v.).     (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEDI, PETER (1705-1735), Swedish naturalist, was born in the province\r\nof Angermania, in Sweden, on the 22nd of February 1705. Intending to\r\nbecome a clergyman, he went, in 1724, to study theology at Upsala, but\r\nhe turned his attention to medicine and natural history, especially\r\nichthyology, upon the study of which he exercised great influence (see\r\nICHTHYOLOGY). In 1728 his countryman Linnaeus arrived in Upsala, and a\r\nlasting friendship was formed between the two. In 1732 both left Upsala,\r\nArtedi for England, and Linnaeus for Lapland; but before parting they\r\nreciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the\r\nevent of death. He was accidentally drowned on the 27th of September\r\n1735 at Amsterdam, where he was engaged in cataloguing the collections\r\nof Albert Seba, a wealthy Dutchman, who had formed what was perhaps the\r\nrichest museum of his time. According to agreement, his manuscripts came\r\ninto the hands of Linnaeus, and his _Bibliotheca Ichthyologica_ and\r\n_Philosophia Ichthyologica_, together with a life of the author, were\r\npublished at Leiden in the year 1738.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEGA, a tribe of African \"Arabs,\" said to be descendants of a sheik of\r\nthat name who came from Hadramut in pre-Islamic days, settling near\r\nTokar. The name is said to be \"patrician,\" and the Artega may be\r\nregarded as the most ancient stock in the Suakin district. They are now\r\nan inferior mixed race. They were all followers of the mahdi and khalifa\r\nin the Sudan wars (1883-1898).\r\n\r\n  See _Anglo-Egyptian Sudan_, edited by Count Gleichen (London, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEL (Russ. for \"gang\"), the name for the co-operative associations in\r\nRussia. Originally, the artels were true examples of productive\r\nco-operation, bodies of working-men associating together for the purpose\r\nof jointly undertaking some piece of work, and dividing the profits.\r\nThis original form of artel still survives among the fishermen of\r\nArchangel. Artels have come, however, to be little more than trade\r\ngilds, with mutual responsibility. (For details see RUSSIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS. (1) A geographer \"of Ephesus\" who flourished about 100 B.C.\r\nAfter studying at Alexandria, he travelled extensively and published the\r\nresults of his investigations in a large work on general geography\r\n([Greek: Ta geographoumena]) in eleven books, much used by Strabo and\r\nothers. The original work is lost, but we possess many small fragments\r\nand larger fragments of an abridgment made by Marcianus of Heracleia\r\n(5th century), which contains the periplus of the Euxine and accounts of\r\nBithynia and Paphlagonia. (See Muller, _Geographi Graeci Minores_;\r\nBunbury, _History of Ancient Geography_; Stiehle, \"Der Geograph\r\nArtemidoros von Ephesos,\" in _Philologus_, xi., 1856). (2) A soothsayer\r\nand interpreter of dreams, who flourished in the 2nd century A.D.,\r\nduring the reigns of Hadrian and the Antonines. He called himself\r\nDaldianus from his mother's birthplace, Daldis in Lydia, in order to\r\nmake its name known to the world. His [Greek: Oneirokritica], or\r\ninterpretation of dreams, was said to have been written by command of\r\nApollo Daldianus, whose initiated votary he was. It is in four books,\r\nwith an appendix containing a collection of prophetic dreams which had\r\nbeen realized. The first three books, addressed to Cassius Maximus, a\r\nPhoenician rhetorician (perhaps identical with Maximus of Tyre), treat\r\nof dreams and divination generally; the fourth--with a reply to his\r\ncritics--and the appendix are dedicated to his son, also named\r\nArtemidorus and an interpreter of dreams. Artemidorus boasts of the\r\ntrouble expended on his work; he had read all the authorities on dreams,\r\ntravelled extensively, and conversed with all who had studied the\r\nsubject. The work is valuable as affording an insight into ancient\r\nsuperstitions. According to Suidas, Artemidorus also wrote on augurs and\r\ncheiromancy, but all trace of these works is lost. (Editions: Reiff,\r\n1805, Hercher, 1864; translation and notes, Krauss, 1881; English\r\ntranslation by Wood, 1644, and later editions.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEMIS, one of the principal goddesses in Greek mythology, the\r\ncounterpart of the Roman Diana. The suggested etymologies of the name\r\n(see O. Gruppe, _Griechische Mythologie_, ii. p. 1267, note 2), as in\r\nthe case of most of the Olympian deities, are unsatisfactory, and throw\r\nno light upon her significance and characteristics. The Homeric and\r\nlater conception of Artemis, though by no means the original one, may be\r\nnoticed first. She is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, twin-sister and\r\ncounterpart of Apollo. She is said to have been born a day before him\r\n(on the 6th of the month) and tradition assigns them different\r\nbirthplaces--Delos to Apollo, Ortygia to Artemis. But Ortygia (\"home of\r\nquails\") applies still to Delos, and may well have been a synonym for\r\nthat island. In its original sense it does not apply either to the\r\nisland of Ortygia at Syracuse, or to Ortygia near Ephesus, which also\r\nclaimed the honour of having been the birthplace of the goddess. Artemis\r\nis the goddess of chastity, an aspect of her character which gradually\r\nassumed more and more importance--the protectress of young men and\r\nmaidens, who defies and contemns the power of Aphrodite. Her resemblance\r\nto her brother is shown in many ways. Like him, armed with bow and\r\narrows, she deals death to mortals, sometimes gently and suddenly,\r\nespecially to women, but also as a punishment for offences against\r\nherself or morality. With him she takes part in the combat with Python\r\nand with Tityus, in the slaughter of the children of Niobe, while alone\r\nshe executes vengeance on Orion. Although Apollo has nothing to do with\r\nthe earlier cult of Artemis, nor Artemis with that of Delphi, their\r\nassociation was a comparatively early one, and probably originated in\r\nDelos. Here the connexion of Artemis with the Hyperborean legend (see\r\nAPOLLO) is shown in the names of the maidens (Opis, Hecaerge) who were\r\nsupposed to have brought offerings from the north to Delos, where they\r\nwere buried. Both Opis (or Oupis) and Hecaerge are names of Artemis, the\r\nlatter being the feminine of Hecaergos, an epithet of Apollo. Like her\r\nbrother, she is not only a goddess who deals death, but she is also a\r\nhealing and a purifying divinity, [Greek: oulia] (\"the healer,\" cf.\r\nApollo Oulios), [Greek: luae, luaia] (\"purifier,\") and [Greek: soteira],\r\n\"she who saves from all evils\" (cf. Apollo [Greek: apotropaios]). Her\r\nconnexion with the prophetic art is doubtful, although mention is made\r\nof an Artemis Sibylla. To her association with Apollo are certainly to\r\nbe referred the names Delphinia and Pythia, and the titles referring to\r\nstate and family life--[Greek: prostataeria], [Greek: patriotis],\r\n[Greek: boulaia]. It probably accounts for her appearance as a goddess\r\nof seafarers, the bestower of fair weather and prosperous voyages. At\r\nPhigalia in Arcadia, Eurynome, represented as half woman and half fish,\r\nwas probably another form of Artemis. To the same association may be\r\ntraced her slight connexion with music, song and dance.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Arcadian and Athenian rites and legends, however, which are\r\ncertainly earlier than Homer, that the original conception of the\r\ngoddess is to be found. These tend to show that Artemis was first and\r\nforemost a nature goddess, whose cult shows numerous traces of totemism.\r\nAs a goddess of fertilizing moisture, lakes, rivers, springs, and marshy\r\nlowlands are brought into close connexion with her. Thus she is [Greek:\r\nlimnaia, despoina limnaes] (\"lady of the lake\"), [Greek: eleia] (\"of\r\nmarshes\"), [Greek: potamia] (\"of rivers,\" especially of the Cladaus and\r\nAlpheus, whence her name [Greek: Alpheiaia]). Her influence is very\r\nactive in promoting the increase of the fruits of the field, hence she\r\nis specially a goddess of agriculture. She drives away the mice (cf.\r\nApollo Smintheus) and slays the Aloidae, the corn spirits; she is the\r\nfriend of the reapers, and requires her share of the first fruits. Her\r\ncharacter as a harvest goddess is clearly shown in the legend of the\r\nCalydonian boar, sent by her to ravage the fields out of resentment at\r\nnot having received a harvest offering from Oeneus (see MELEAGER). As\r\n[Greek: epimulios] and [Greek: epiklibanios] (\"presiding over the mill\r\nand the oven\") she extends her protection over the further development\r\nof the grain for the use of man.\r\n\r\nArtemis was naturally also a goddess of trees and vegetation. Near\r\nOrchomenus her wooden image stood in a large cedar-tree--an indication\r\nthat her worship was originally that of the tree itself ([Greek:\r\nkedreatis], \"the cedar goddess\"); at Caryae there was an image of\r\nArtemis [Greek: karuatis] (\"the nut-tree goddess\"). Two curious epithets\r\nin this connexion deserve notice: [Greek: lugodesma] (\"bound with\r\nwithies\"), derived from the legend that the image of Artemis Orthia was\r\nfound in a thicket of withies, which twined round it and kept it upright\r\n([Greek: lugos] is the _agnus castus_, and points to Artemis in her\r\nrelation to women); and [Greek: apagchomenae] (\"the suspended\"),\r\nprobably a reference to the custom of hanging the mask or image of a\r\nvegetation-divinity on a tree to obtain fertility (Farnell, _Cults of\r\nthe Greek States_, ii. p. 429; cf. the \"swing\" festival ([Greek: aiora])\r\nof the Greeks, and the _oscilla_ of the Romans).\r\n\r\nThe functions of the goddess extended from the vegetable to the animal\r\nworld, to the inhabitants of the woods and mountains. This is clearly\r\nexpressed in the cult of Artemis Laphria (possibly connected with\r\n[Greek: laphura], \"spoils\"), at whose festivals all kinds of animals,\r\nboth wild and tame, as well as fruits, were thrown together on a huge\r\nwood fire. Her general name in this connexion was [Greek: agrotera]\r\n(\"roaming the wilds,\" not necessarily \"goddess of the chase,\" an aspect\r\nless familiar in the older religion), to whom five hundred goats were\r\noffered every year by the Athenians as a thanksgiving in commemoration\r\nof the victory at Marathon. Numerous animals were sacred to her, and at\r\nSyracuse all kinds of wild beasts, including a lioness, were carried in\r\nprocession in her honour. It has been observed that she is rather the\r\npatroness of the wild beasts of the field than of the more agricultural\r\nor domestic animals (Farnell, _Cults_, ii. p. 431), although the epithet\r\n[Greek: Haemerasia] (\"the tamer,\" according to others, the \"gentle\"\r\ngoddess of healing) seems to refer to her connexion with the latter. The\r\nbear was especially associated with her in Arcadia, and in her worship\r\nas Artemis Brauronia at Brauron in Attica. According to the legend,\r\nCallisto, an Arcadian nymph, became by Zeus the mother of Arcas, the\r\neponymous hero of the Arcadians. Zeus, to conceal the amour, changed\r\nCallisto into a she-bear; Hera, however, discovered it, and persuaded\r\nArtemis to slay Callisto, who was placed amongst the stars as [Greek:\r\narktos] (\"the bear\"). There is no doubt that Callisto is identical with\r\nArtemis; her name is an obvious variation of [Greek: kallistae], a\r\nfrequent epithet of the goddess, to whom a temple was erected on the\r\nhill where Callisto was supposed to be buried. It is suggested by M.\r\nKraus in _Classical Review_, February 1908, that Aphaea, the cult-name\r\nof Artemis at Aegina, is of Semitic origin and means \"beautiful.\"\r\nClosely connected with this legend is the worship of Artemis Brauronia.\r\nThe accounts of its institution, which differ in detail, agree that it\r\nwas intended to appease the wrath of the goddess at the killing of a\r\nbear. A number of young girls, between five and ten years of age,\r\nwearing a bear-skin (afterwards a saffron-coloured robe) danced a\r\nbear-dance, called [Greek: arkteia], the girls themselves being called\r\n[Greek: arktoi]. In one account, a maiden was ordered to be sacrificed\r\nto the bear Artemis, but a certain man who had a goat called it his\r\ndaughter and offered it up in secret, just as at Munychium a fawn\r\ndressed up as a girl was sacrificed to the goddess. In place of the goat\r\nor fawn a bear might have been expected, but the choice may have been\r\ninfluenced by the animal totem of the tribe into whose hands the ritual\r\nfell. The whole is a reminiscence of earlier times, when the goddess\r\nherself was a bear, to whom human sacrifice was offered. Callisto was\r\noriginally a bear-goddess worshipped in Arcadia, identified with\r\nArtemis, when nothing remained of the original animal-worship but name\r\nand ritual. The worship of Callisto being merged in that of the greater\r\ndivinity, she became the handmaid and companion of Artemis. A stone\r\nfigure of a bear found on the Acropolis seems to point to the worship of\r\nArtemis Brauronia. Her death at the hands of the latter was explained by\r\nthe wrath of the goddess--in her later aspect as goddess of chastity--at\r\nCallisto's amour with Zeus (see A. Lang, _Myth, Ritual and Religion_,\r\nii.; Farnell, _Cults_, ii. p. 437). The custom of flogging youths at the\r\naltar of Artemis Orthia[1] at Limnaeum in Laconia, and the legend of\r\nIphigeneia (q.v.), herself another form of Artemis, connected with\r\nArtemis Taurica of the Tauric Chersonese, are usually supposed to point\r\nto early human sacrifice (but see Farnell). Various explanations have\r\nbeen given of the epithet [Greek: orthia]: (1) that it refers to the\r\nprimitive type of the \"erect\" wooden idol; (2) that it means \"she who\r\nsafely rears children after birth,\" or \"heals the sick\" (cf. [Greek:\r\northios] applied to Asclepius); (3) that it has a phallic significance\r\n(Schreiber in Roscher's _Lexikon_). Scholars differ as to whether\r\nArtemis Taurica is identical with Artemis Tauropolos, worshipped chiefly\r\nat Samos with a milder ritual, but it is more probable that [Greek:\r\nTauropolos] simply means \"protectress of bulls.\"\r\n\r\nThe protecting influence of Artemis was extended, like that of Apollo,\r\nto the highest animal, man. She was especially concerned in the bringing\r\nup of the young. Boys were brought by their nurses to the temple of\r\nArtemis [Greek: koruthalia] (= [Greek: kourotrophos]) and there\r\nconsecrated to her; at the Apaturia, on the day called [Greek:\r\nkoureotis], boys cut off and dedicated their hair to her. Girls as well\r\nas boys were under her protection. Her function as a goddess of marriage\r\nis less certain, and the cult-titles adduced in support of it are hardly\r\nconvincing; such are [Greek: Haegemonae], interpreted as \"she who leads\r\nhome the bride,\" [Greek: selasphoros], \"bearer of light,\" that is, of\r\ntorches at the marriage procession. On the other hand, her connexion\r\nwith childbirth is clearly shown: in many places she is even called\r\nEilithyia, who in the earlier poets was regarded as distinct from her.\r\nIn one version of the story of her birth she is said to have been born a\r\nday before Apollo, in order to assist Leto at his birth; women in\r\nchildbirth invoked her aid, and after delivery offered up their clothes\r\nor a lock of hair. As already noticed, in Homer Artemis appears as a\r\ngoddess of death; closely akin to this is the conception of her as a\r\ngoddess of war. As such she is [Greek: nikaephoros] (\"bringer of\r\nvictory\"); the title [Greek: kolainis] is possibly connected with\r\n[Greek: koleos] (\"sword-sheath\"); and [Greek: laphria] (see above) may\r\nrefer to the spoils of war as well as the chase.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Artemis as a virgin goddess, the \"queen and huntress, chaste\r\nand fair,\" which obtained great prominence in early times, and seems\r\ninconsistent with her association with childbirth, is generally\r\nexplained as due to her connexion with Apollo, but it is suggested by\r\nFarnell that [Greek: parthenos] originally meant \"unmarried,\" and that\r\n\"[Greek: Artemis parthenos] may have been originally the goddess of a\r\npeople who had not yet the advanced Hellenic institutions of settled\r\nmarriage ... and when society developed the later family system the\r\ngoddess remained celibate, though not opposed to childbirth.\"\r\n\r\nAnother view of the original character of Artemis, which has found much\r\nsupport in modern times, is that she was a moon-goddess. But there is no\r\ntrace of Artemis as such in the epic period, and the Homeric hymn knows\r\nnothing of her identification with Selene. The attribute of the torch\r\nwill apply equally well to the goddess of the chase, and epithets such\r\nas [Greek: phosphoros, selasphoros, aithopia], although applicable, are\r\nby no means convincing. The idea dates from the 5th century, and was due\r\nto her connexion with Hecate and Apollo. When the latter came to be\r\nidentified by philosophical speculation with the sun-god Helios, it was\r\nnatural that his sister and counterpart should be identified with the\r\nmoon-goddess Selene. But she is nowhere recognized in cult as such (see\r\nGruppe, _Griechische Mythologie_, ii. p. 1297, note 2).\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that Callisto, Iphigeneia, Eilithyia, are only\r\nArtemis under different names; to these may be added Adrasteia,\r\nAtalanta, Helen, Leto and others (see Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa's\r\n_Realencyclopadie_).\r\n\r\nAgain, various non-Hellenic divinities were identified with Artemis, and\r\ntheir cult gradually amalgamated with hers. The most important of these\r\nwas Artemis of Ephesus, whose seat was in the marshy valley of the\r\nCaystrus. Like the Greek Artemis, she was essentially a nature goddess,\r\nthe great foster-mother of the vegetable and animal kingdom. A number of\r\nofficials were engaged in the performance of her temple service. Her\r\neunuch priests, [Greek: megabyzoi] (a name which points to a Persian\r\norigin), were under the control of a high priest called Essen (according\r\nto others, there was a body of priests called Essenes). There were also\r\nthree classes of priestesses, Mellierae, Hierae, Parierae; there is no\r\nevidence that they were called Melissae (\"bees\"), although the bee is a\r\nfrequent symbol on the coins of the city. Her chief festival, Ephesia or\r\nArtemisia, was held in the spring, at which games and various contests\r\ntook place after the Greek fashion, although the ritual continued to be\r\nof a modified oriental, orgiastic type. This goddess is closely\r\nconnected with the Amazons (q.v.), who are said to have built her temple\r\nand set up her image in the trunk of a tree. The Greeks of Ephesus\r\nidentified her with their own Artemis, and claimed that her birthplace\r\nOrtygia was near Ephesus, not in Delos. She has much in common with the\r\noriental prototype of Aphrodite, and the Cappadocian goddess Ma, another\r\nform of Cybele. The usual figure of the Ephesian Artemis, which was said\r\nin the first instance to have fallen from heaven, is in the form of a\r\nfemale with many breasts, the symbol of productivity or a token of her\r\nfunction as the all-nourishing mother. From the waist to the feet her\r\nimage resembles a pillar, narrowing downwards and sculptured all round\r\nwith rows of animals (lions, rams and bulls).\r\n\r\nMention may also be made of the following non-Hellenic representatives\r\nof Artemis. Leucophryne (or Leucophrys), whose worship was brought by\r\nemigrants from Magnesia in Thessaly to Magnesia on the Maeander, was a\r\nnature goddess, and her representation on coins exactly resembles that\r\nof the Ephesian Artemis. Her cult, however, from the little that is\r\nknown of it appears to have been more Hellenic. There was an altar and\r\ntemple of Artemis Pergaea at Perga in Pamphylia, where a yearly festival\r\nwas held in her honour. As in the case of Cybele, mendicant priests were\r\nattached to her service. Similar figures were Artemis Coloene,\r\nworshipped at Lake Coloe near Sardis; Artemis Cordax, celebrated in\r\nwanton dances on Mount Sipylus; the Persian Artemis, identical with\r\nAnaitis Bendis, was a Thracian goddess of war and the chase, whose cult\r\nwas introduced into Attica in the middle of the 5th century B.C. by\r\nThracian metics. At her festival called Bendidea, held at the Peiraeus,\r\nthere was a procession of Thracians who were settled in the district,\r\nand a torch-race on horseback. (For Britomartis see separate article.)\r\n\r\nAmong the chief attributes of Artemis are: the hind, specially regarded\r\nas her sacred animal; the bear, the boar and the goat; the zebu (Artemis\r\nLeucophrys); the lion, one of her oldest animal symbols; bow and arrows,\r\nas goddess of the chase and death; a mural crown, as the protectress of\r\ncities; the torch, originally an attribute of the goddess of the chase\r\nor marriage, but, like the crescent (originally an attribute of the\r\nAsiatic nature goddesses), transferred to Artemis, when she came to be\r\nregarded as a moon-goddess. The Greek Artemis was usually represented as\r\na huntress with bow and quiver, or torch in her hand, in face very like\r\nApollo, her drapery flowing to her feet, or, more frequently, girt high\r\nfor speed. She is accompanied often by a deer or a dog. Perhaps the\r\nfinest existing statue of her is the Diana of Versailles from Hadrian's\r\nVilla (now in the Louvre), in which she wears a short tunic drawn in at\r\nthe waist and sandals on her feet; her hair is bound up into a knot at\r\nthe back of her head, with a band over the forehead. With her left hand\r\nshe holds a stag, while drawing an arrow from the quiver on her shoulder\r\nwith the right. Another famous statue is one from Gabii, in which she is\r\nfinishing her toilet and fastening the chlamys over her tunic. In older\r\ntimes her figure is fuller and stronger, and the clothing more complete;\r\ncertain statues discovered at Delos, imitated from wooden models\r\n(xoana), are supposed to represent Artemis; they are described as stiff\r\nand rigid, the limbs as it were glued to the body without life or\r\nmovement, garments closely fitting, the folds of which fall in\r\nsymmetrical parallel lines. As a goddess of the moon she wears a long\r\nrobe, carries a torch, and her head is surmounted by a crescent. On the\r\ncoins of Arcadia, Aetolia, Crete and Sicily, are to be seen varied and\r\nbeautiful representations of her head as conceived by the Greek artists\r\nin the best times.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Articles in Pauly-Wissowa's _Realencyclopadie_;\r\n  Roscher's _Lexikon der Mythologie_, and Daremberg and Saglio's\r\n  _Dictionnaire des antiquites_ (s.v.

The\r\n    flogging ([Greek: diamastigosis]) is explained by R.C. Bosanquet as a\r\n    late institution of decadent Sparta, an exaggeration of an old ritual\r\n    practice of whipping away boys who tried to steal cheeses from the\r\n    altar (see _The Year's Work in Classical Studies_, ed. W.H.D. Rouse,\r\n    1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEMISIA, daughter of Lygdamis, was queen of Halicarnassus and Cos\r\nabout 480 B.C. Being a dependent of Persia, she took part in person in\r\nthe expedition of Xerxes against the Greeks, and fitted out five ships,\r\nwith which she distinguished herself in the sea-fight near Salamis\r\n(480). When closely pursued by the Athenians she escaped by the\r\nstratagem of attacking one of the Persian vessels, whereupon the\r\nAthenians concluded that she was an ally, and gave up the pursuit\r\n(Herod. vii. 99, viii. 68). After the battle Xerxes declared that the\r\nmen had fought like women, and the women like men. By her advice he did\r\nnot risk another battle, but at once retired from Greece. She is said to\r\nhave loved a young man named Dardanus, of Abydos, and, enraged at his\r\nneglect of her, to have put out his eyes while he was asleep. The gods,\r\nas a punishment for this, ordered her, by an oracle, to take the famous\r\nbut rather mythical _lover's leap_ from the Leucadian promontory\r\n(Photius, _Cod. 153a_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEMISIA, the sister and wife of Mausolus (or Maussollus), king of\r\nCaria, was sole ruler from about 353 to 350 B.C. She has immortalized\r\nherself by the honours paid to the memory of her husband. She built for\r\nhim, in Halicarnassus, a very magnificent tomb, called the Mausoleum,\r\nwhich was one of the seven wonders of the world, and from which the name\r\nmausoleum was afterwards given to all tombs remarkable for their\r\ngrandeur. She appointed panegyrics to be composed in his honour, and\r\noffered valuable prizes for the best oratorical and tragic compositions.\r\nShe also erected a monument, or trophy, in Rhodes, to commemorate her\r\nconquest of that island. When the Rhodians regained their freedom they\r\nbuilt round this trophy so as to render it inaccessible, whence it was\r\nknown as the _Abaton_. There are statues of Mausolus and Artemisia in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\n  Vitruvius ii. 8; Diodorus Siculus xvi. 36; Cicero, _Tusc._ iii. 31;\r\n  Val.

A.D. 230), a prominent Christian teacher at Rome, who\r\nheld Adoptianist (see ADOPTIANISM), or humanitarian views, of the same\r\ntype as his elder contemporaries the Theodotians, though perhaps\r\nasserting more definitely than they the superiority of Christ to the\r\nprophets in respect of His supernatural birth and sinlessness.

(See also MONARCHIANISM.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTENA, a village of Italy, in the province of Rome, situated at the\r\nN.N.W. extremity of the Volscian Mountains; it is 36 m. S.E. by rail,\r\nand 24 m. direct from Rome. Pop. (1901) 5016. On the mountain above it\r\n(2073 ft.) are the fine remains of the fortifications of a city built in\r\na very primitive style, in cyclopean blocks of local limestone; within\r\nthe walls are traces of buildings, and a massive terrace which supported\r\nsome edifice of importance. The name of this city is quite uncertain;\r\nEcetra is a possible suggestion. The modern village, which was called\r\nMonte Fortino until 1870, owes its present name to an unwarrantable\r\nidentification of the site with the ancient Volscian Artena, destroyed\r\nin 404 B.C. Another Artena, which belonged to the district of Caere, and\r\nlay between it and Veii, was destroyed in the period of the kings, and\r\nits site is quite unknown.\r\n\r\n  See T. Ashby and G.J. Pfeiffer in _Supplementary Papers of the\r\n  American School in Rome_, i. 87 seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTERIES (Gr. [Greek: artaeria], probably from [Greek: airein], to\r\nraise, but popularly connected by the ancients with [Greek: aaer], air),\r\nin anatomy, the elastic tubes which carry the blood away from the heart\r\nto the tissues. As, after death, they are always found empty, the older\r\nanatomists believed that they contained air, and to this belief they owe\r\nthe name, which was originally given to the windpipe (_trachea_). Two\r\ngreat trunks, the aorta and pulmonary artery, leave the heart and divide\r\nagain and again, until they become minute vessels to which the name of\r\narterioles is given. The larger trunks are fairly constant in position\r\nand receive definite names, but as the smaller branches are reached\r\nthere is an increasing inconstancy in their position, and anatomists are\r\nstill undecided as to the normal, i.e. most frequent, arrangement of\r\nmany of the smaller arteries. From a common-sense point of view it is\r\nprobably of greater importance to realize how variable the distribution\r\nof small arteries is than to remember the names of twigs which are of\r\nneither surgical nor morphological importance. Arteries adapt themselves\r\nmore quickly than most other structures to any mechanical obstruction,\r\nand many of the differences between the arterial systems of Man and\r\nother animals are due to the assumption of the erect position. Many\r\narteries are tortuous, especially when they supply movable parts such as\r\nthe face or scalp, but when one or two sharp bends are found they are\r\ngenerally due to the artery going out of its way to give off a constant\r\nand important branch. Small arteries unite or anastomose with others\r\nnear them very freely, so that when even a large artery is obliterated a\r\ncollateral circulation is carried on by the rapid increase in size of\r\nthe communications between the branches coming off above and below the\r\npoint of obstruction. Some branches, however, such as those going to the\r\nbasal ganglia of the brain and to the spleen, are known as \"end\r\narteries,\" and these do not anastomose with their neighbours at all;\r\nthus, if one is blocked, arterial blood is cut off from its area of\r\nsupply. As a rule, there is little arterial anastomosis across the\r\nmiddle line of the body near the surface, though the scalp, lips and\r\nthyroid body are exceptions.\r\n\r\n  The distribution of the pulmonary artery is considered in connexion\r\n  with the anatomy of the lungs (see RESPIRATORY SYSTEM). That of the\r\n  aorta will now be briefly described.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aorta.\r\n\r\n  The _Aorta_ lies in the cavities of the thorax and abdomen, and arises\r\n  from the base of the left ventricle of the heart. It ascends forward,\r\n  upward, and to the right as far as the level of the second right\r\n  costal cartilage, then runs backward, and to the left to reach the\r\n  left side of the body of the 4th thoracic vertebra, and then descends\r\n  almost vertically. It thus forms the _arch of the aorta_, which arches\r\n  over the root of the left lung, and which has attached to its concave\r\n  surface a fibrous cord, known as the obliterated _ductus arteriosus_,\r\n  which connects it with the left branch of the pulmonary artery. The\r\n  aorta continues its course downward in close relation to the bodies of\r\n  the thoracic vertebrae, then passes through an opening in the\r\n  diaphragm (q.v.), enters the abdomen, and descends in front of the\r\n  bodies of the lumbar vertebrae as low as the 4th, where it usually\r\n  divides into two terminal branches, the common iliac arteries. Above\r\n  and behind the angle of bifurcation, however, a long slender artery,\r\n  called the _middle sacral_, is prolonged downward in front of the\r\n  sacrum to the end of the coccyx.\r\n\r\n  It will be convenient to describe the distribution of the arteries\r\n  under the following headings:--(1) Branches for the head, neck and\r\n  upper limbs; (2) branches for the viscera of the thorax and abdomen;\r\n  (3) branches for the walls of the thorax and abdomen; (4) branches for\r\n  the pelvis and lower limbs.\r\n\r\n  The branches for the head, neck and upper limbs arise as three large\r\n  arteries from the transverse part of the aorta; they are named\r\n  _innominate, left common carotid_ and _left subclavian_. The\r\n  innominate artery is the largest and passes upward and to the right,\r\n  to the root of the neck, where it divides into the right common\r\n  carotid and the right subclavian. The carotid arteries supply the two\r\n  sides of the head and neck; the subclavian arteries the two upper\r\n  extremities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Carotid system.\r\n\r\n  The _common carotid_ artery runs up the neck by the side of the\r\n  windpipe, and on a level with the upper border of the thyroid\r\n  cartilage divides into the internal and external carotid arteries.\r\n\r\n  The _internal carotid_ artery ascends through the carotid canal in the\r\n  temporal bone into the cranial cavity. It gives off an _ophthalmic_\r\n  branch to the eyeball and other contents of the orbit, and then\r\n  divides into the _anterior_ and _middle cerebral_ arteries. The middle\r\n  cerebral artery extends outward into the Sylvian fissure of the brain,\r\n  and supplies the island of Reil, the orbital part, and the outer face\r\n  of the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, and the temporo-sphenoidal\r\n  lobe; it also gives a choroid branch to the choroid plexus of the\r\n  velum interpositum. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the inner\r\n  face of the hemisphere from the anterior end of the frontal lobe as\r\n  far back as the internal parieto-occipital fissure. At the base of the\r\n  brain not only do the two internal carotids anastomose with each other\r\n  through the _anterior communicating_ artery, which passes between\r\n  their anterior cerebral branches, but the internal carotid on each\r\n  side anastomoses with the posterior cerebral branch of the basilar, by\r\n  a _posterior communicating_ artery. In this manner a vascular circle,\r\n  the _circle of Willis_, is formed, which permits of freedom of the\r\n  arterial circulation by the anastomoses between arteries not only on\r\n  the same side, but on opposite sides of the mesial plane. The\r\n  vertebral and internal carotid arteries, which are the arteries of\r\n  supply for the brain, are distinguished by lying at some depth from\r\n  the surface in their course to the organ, by having curves or twists\r\n  in their course, and by the absence of large collateral branches.\r\n\r\n  The _external carotid_ artery ascends through the upper part of the\r\n  side of the neck, and behind the lower jaw into the parotid gland,\r\n  where it divides into the internal maxillary and superficial temporal\r\n  branches. This artery gives off the following branches:--(a) _Superior\r\n  thyroid_ to the larynx and thyroid body; (b) _Lingual_ to the tongue\r\n  and sublingual gland; (c) _Facial_ to the face, palate, tonsil and\r\n  sub-maxillary gland; (d) _Occipital_ to the sterno-mastoid muscle and\r\n  back of the scalp; (e) _Posterior auricular_ to the back of the ear\r\n  and the adjacent part of the scalp; (f) _Superficial temporal_ to the\r\n  scalp in front of the ear, and by its _transverse facial_ branch to\r\n  the back part of the face; (g) _Internal maxillary_, giving _muscular_\r\n  branches to the muscles of mastication, _meningeal_ branches to the\r\n  dura mater, _dental_ branches to the teeth, and other branches to the\r\n  nose, palate and tympanum; (h) _Ascending pharyngeal_, which gives\r\n  branches to the pharynx, palate, tonsils and dura mater.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Subclavian system.\r\n\r\n  The _subclavian_ artery is the commencement of the great arterial\r\n  trunk for the upper limb. It passes across the root of the neck and\r\n  behind the clavicle, where it enters the armpit, and becomes the\r\n  _axillary_ artery; by that name it extends as far as the posterior\r\n  fold of the axilla, where it enters the upper arm, takes the name of\r\n  brachial, and courses as far as the bend of the elbow; here it\r\n  bifurcates into the _radial_ and _ulnar_ arteries. From the subclavian\r\n  part of the trunk the following branches arise:--(a) _Vertebral_,\r\n  which enters the foramen at the root of the transverse process of the\r\n  6th cervical vertebra, ascends through the corresponding foramina in\r\n  the vertebrae above, lies in a groove on the arch of the atlas, and\r\n  enters the skull through the foramen magnum, where it joins its fellow\r\n  to form the _basilar_ artery; it gives off _muscular_ branches to the\r\n  deep muscles of the neck, _spinal_ branches to the spinal cord,\r\n  _meningeal_ branches to the dura mater, and an _inferior cerebellar_\r\n  branch to the under surface of the cerebellum. The _basilar_ artery,\r\n  formed by the junction of the two vertebrals, extends from the lower\r\n  to the upper border of the pons Varolii; it gives off _transverse_\r\n  branches to the pons, _auditory_ branches to the internal ear,\r\n  _inferior cerebellar_ branches to the under surface of the cerebellum,\r\n  whilst it breaks up into four terminal branches, viz. two _superior\r\n  cerebellar_ to the upper surface of the cerebellum, and two _posterior\r\n  cerebral_ which supply the tentorial and mesial aspects of the\r\n  temporo-sphenoidal lobes, the occipital lobes, and the posterior\r\n  convolutions of the parietal lobes. (b) _Thyroid axis_, which\r\n  immediately divides into the _inferior thyroid_, the _supra-scapular_,\r\n  and the _transverse cervical_ branches; the _inferior thyroid_\r\n  supplies the thyroid body, and gives off an _ascending cervical_\r\n  branch to the muscles of the neck; the _supra-scapular_ supplies the\r\n  muscles on the dorsum scapulae; the _transverse cervical_ supplies the\r\n  trapezius and the muscles attached to the vertebral border of the\r\n  scapula. (c) _Internal mammary_ supplies the anterior surface of the\r\n  walls of the chest and abdomen, and the upper surface of the\r\n  diaphragm. (d) _Superior intercostal_ supplies the first intercostal\r\n  space, and by its deep _cervical_ branch the deep muscles of the back\r\n  of the neck.\r\n\r\n  The _axillary_ artery supplies _thoracic_ branches to the wall of the\r\n  chest, the pectoral muscles, and the fat and glands of the axilla; an\r\n  _acromio-thoracic_ to the parts about the acromion; _anterior_ and\r\n  _posterior circumflex_ branches to the shoulder joint and deltoid\r\n  muscle; a _subscapular_ branch to the muscles of the posterior fold of\r\n  the axilla.\r\n\r\n  The _brachial_ artery supplies _muscular_ branches to the muscles of\r\n  the upper arm; a _nutrient_ branch to the humerus; _superior_ and\r\n  _inferior profunda_ branches and an _anastomotic_ to the muscles of\r\n  the upper arm and the region of the elbow joint.\r\n\r\n  The _ulnar_ artery extends down the ulnar side of the front of the\r\n  fore-arm to the palm of the hand, where it curves outward toward the\r\n  thumb, and anastomoses with the superficial volar or other branch of\r\n  the radial artery to form the _superficial palmar arch_. In the\r\n  fore-arm the ulnar gives off the _interosseous_ arteries, which supply\r\n  the muscles of the fore-arm and give _nutrient_ branches to the bones;\r\n  two _recurrent_ branches to the region of the elbow; _carpal_ branches\r\n  to the wrist joint: in the hand it gives a _deep_ branch to the deep\r\n  muscles of the hand, and from the superficial arch arise _digital_\r\n  branches to the sides of the little, ring, and middle fingers, and the\r\n  ulnar border of the index finger.\r\n\r\n  The _radial_ artery extends down the radial side of the front of the\r\n  fore-arm, turns round the outer side of the wrist to the back of the\r\n  hand, passes between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones to the palm,\r\n  where it joins the deep branch of the ulnar, and forms the _deep\r\n  palmar arch_. In the fore-arm it gives off a _recurrent_ branch to the\r\n  elbow joint; _carpal_ branches to the wrist joint; and _muscular_\r\n  branches, one of which, named superficial volar, supplies the muscle\r\n  of the thumb and joins the ulnar artery: in the hand it gives off a\r\n  branch to the thumb, and one to the radial side of the index,\r\n  _interosseous_ branches to the interosseous muscles, _perforating_\r\n  branches to the back of the hand, and _recurrent_ branches to the\r\n  wrist.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Visceral branches.\r\n\r\n  The branches of the aorta which supply the viscera of the thorax are\r\n  the coronary, the oesophageal, the bronchial and the pericardiac. The\r\n  _coronary_ arteries, two in number, are the first branches of the\r\n  aorta, and arise opposite the anterior and left posterior segments of\r\n  the semilunar valve, from the wall of the aorta, where it dilates into\r\n  the sinuses of Valsalva. They supply the tissue of the heart.\r\n\r\n  The _oesophageal, bronchial_ and _pericardiac_ branches are\r\n  sufficiently described by their names.\r\n\r\n  The branches of the aorta which supply the viscera of the abdomen\r\n  arise either singly or in pairs. The single arteries are the coeliac\r\n  axis, the superior mesenteric, and the inferior mesenteric, which\r\n  arise from the front of the aorta; the pairs are the capsular, the two\r\n  renal, and the two spermatic or ovarian, which arise from its sides.\r\n  The single arteries supply viscera which are either completely or\r\n  almost completely invested by the peritoneum, and the veins\r\n  corresponding to them are the roots of the vena portae. The pairs of\r\n  arteries supply viscera developed behind the peritoneum, and the veins\r\n  corresponding to them are rootlets of the inferior vena cava.\r\n\r\n  The _coeliac axis_ is a thick, short artery, which almost immediately\r\n  divides into the gastric, hepatic and splenic branches. The _gastric_\r\n  gives off oesophageal branches and then runs along the lesser\r\n  curvature of the stomach. The _hepatic_ artery ends in the substance\r\n  of the liver; but gives off a _cystic_ branch to the gall bladder, a\r\n  _pyloric_ branch to the stomach, a _gastro-duodenal_ branch, which\r\n  divides into a _superior pancreatico-duodenal_ for the pancreas and\r\n  duodenum, and a _right gastro-epiploic_ for the stomach and omentum.\r\n  The _splenic_ artery ends in the substance of the spleen; but gives\r\n  off _pancreatic_ branches to the pancreas, _vasa brevia_ to the left\r\n  end of the stomach, and a _left gastro-epiploic_ to the stomach and\r\n  omentum.\r\n\r\n  The _superior mesenteric_ artery gives off an _inferior\r\n  pancreatico-duodenal_ branch to the pancreas and duodenum; about\r\n  twelve _intestinal_ branches to the small intestines, which form in\r\n  the substance of the mesentery a series of arches before they end in\r\n  the wall of the intestines; an _ileocolic_ branch to the end of the\r\n  ileum, the caecum, and beginning of the colon; a _right colic_ branch\r\n  to the ascending colon; and a _middle colic_ branch to the transverse\r\n  colon.\r\n\r\n  The _inferior mesenteric_ artery gives off a _left colic_ branch to\r\n  the descending colon, a _sigmoid_ branch to the iliac and pelvic\r\n  colon, and ends in the superior _haemorrhoidal_ artery, which supplies\r\n  the rectum. The arteries which supply the coats of the alimentary tube\r\n  from the oesophagus to the rectum anastomose freely with each other in\r\n  the wall of the tube, or in its mesenteric attachment, and the\r\n  anastomoses are usually by the formation of arches or loops between\r\n  adjacent branches.\r\n\r\n  The _capsular arteries_, small in size, run outward from the aorta to\r\n  end in the supra-renal capsules.\r\n\r\n  The _renal_ arteries pass one to each kidney, in which they for the\r\n  most part end, but in the substance of the organ they give off small\r\n  _perforating_ branches, which pierce the capsule of the kidney, and\r\n  are distributed in the surrounding fat. Additional renal arteries are\r\n  fairly common.\r\n\r\n  The _spermatic_ arteries are two long slender arteries, which descend,\r\n  one in each spermatic cord, into the scrotum to supply the testicle.\r\n  The corresponding ovarian arteries in the female do not leave the\r\n  abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Parietal branches.\r\n\r\n  The branches of the aorta which supply the walls of the thorax,\r\n  abdomen and pelvis, are the intercostal, the lumbar, the phrenic, and\r\n  the middle sacral.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram of a pair of intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n    Ao, The aorta transversely divided, giving off at each side an\r\n     intercostal artery.\r\n    PB, The posterior or dorsal branch.\r\n    AB, The anterior or proper intercostal branch.\r\n    IM, A transverse section through the internal mammary artery.]\r\n\r\n  The _intercostal_ arteries arise from the back of the thoracic aorta,\r\n  and are usually nine pairs. They run round the sides of the vertebral\r\n  bodies as far as the commencement of the intercostal spaces, where\r\n  each divides into a _dorsal_ and a _proper intercostal_ branch; the\r\n  dorsal branch passes to the back of the thorax to supply the deep\r\n  muscles of the spine; the proper intercostal branch (AB.) runs outward\r\n  in the intercostal space to supply its muscles, and the lower pairs of\r\n  intercostals also give branches to the diaphragm and wall of the\r\n  abdomen. Below the last rib a subcostal artery runs.\r\n\r\n  The _lumbar_ arteries arise from the back of the abdominal aorta, and\r\n  are usually four pairs. They run round the sides of the lumbar\r\n  vertebrae, and divide into a _dorsal_ branch which supplies the deep\r\n  muscles of the back of the loins, and an _abdominal_ branch which runs\r\n  outward to supply the wall of the abdomen. The distribution of the\r\n  lumbar and intercostal arteries exhibits a transversely segmented\r\n  arrangement of the vascular system, like the transversely segmented\r\n  arrangement of the bones, muscles and nerves met with in these\r\n  localities, but more especially in the thoracic region.\r\n\r\n  The _phrenic_ arteries, two in number, pass to supply the under\r\n  surface of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n  The _middle sacral_ artery, as it runs down the front of the sacrum,\r\n  gives branches to the back of the pelvic wall.\r\n\r\n  Injections made by Sir W. Turner have shown that, both in the thoracic\r\n  and abdominal cavities, slender anastomosing communications exist\r\n  between the visceral and parietal branches.\r\n\r\n  The arteries to the pelvis and hind limbs begin at the bifurcation of\r\n  the aorta into the two common iliacs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Iliac system.\r\n\r\n  The _common iliac_ artery, after a short course, divides into the\r\n  internal and external iliac arteries. The _internal iliac_ enters the\r\n  pelvis and divides into branches for the supply of the pelvic walls\r\n  and viscera, including the organs of generation, and for the great\r\n  muscles of the buttock. The _external iliac_ descends behind Poupart's\r\n  ligament into the thigh, where it takes the name of _femoral_ artery.\r\n  The femoral descends along the front and inner surface of the thigh,\r\n  gives off a _profunda_ or deep branch, which, by its _circumflex_ and\r\n  _perforating_ branches, supplies the numerous muscles of the thigh;\r\n  most of these extend to the back of the limb to carry blood to the\r\n  muscles situated there. The femoral artery then runs to the back of\r\n  the limb in the ham, where it is called _popliteal_ artery. The\r\n  popliteal divides into two branches, of which one, called _anterior\r\n  tibial_, passes between the bones to the front of the leg, and then\r\n  downward to the upper surface of the foot; the other, _posterior\r\n  tibial_, continues down the back of the leg to the sole of the foot,\r\n  and divides into the _internal_ and _external plantar_ arteries;\r\n  branches proceed from the external plantar artery to the sides of the\r\n  toes, and constitute the _digital_ arteries. From the large arterial\r\n  trunks in the leg many branches proceed, to carry blood to the\r\n  different structures in the limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Structure of arteries.\r\n\r\n  The wall of an artery consists of several coats (see fig. 2). The\r\n  outermost is the _tunica adventitia_, composed of connective tissue;\r\n  immediately internal to this is the _yellow elastic_ coat; within this\r\n  again the _muscular coat_, formed of involuntary. muscular tissue, the\r\n  contractile fibre-cells of which are for the most part arranged\r\n  transversely to the long axis of the artery; in the larger arteries\r\n  the elastic coat is much thicker than the muscular, but in the smaller\r\n  the muscular coat is relatively strong; the vaso-motor nerves\r\n  terminate in the muscular coat. In the first part of the aorta,\r\n  pulmonary artery and arteries of the retina there is no muscular coat.\r\n  Internal to the muscular coat is the _elastic fenestrated coat_,\r\n  formed of a smooth elastic membrane perforated by small apertures.\r\n  Most internal of all is a layer of _endothelial cells_, which form the\r\n  free surface over which the blood flows. The arteries are not\r\n  nourished by the blood which flows through them, but by minute\r\n  vessels, _vasa vasorum_, distributed in their external, elastic and\r\n  muscular coats.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Diagram of the structure of an artery. A,\r\n  tunica adventitia; E, elastic coat; M, muscular coat; F, fenestrated\r\n  coat; En, endothelium continuous with the endothelial wall of C, the\r\n  capillaries.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  EMBRYOLOGY\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram of the Embryonic Arterial Arches. 1,\r\n  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, point to the six arches.

Here will be briefly described the fate of the main\r\n  vessel which carries the blood away from the truncus arteriosus of the\r\n  developing heart (q.v.). This ventral aorta, if traced forward, soon\r\n  divides into two lateral parts, the explanation being that there were\r\n  originally two vessels, side by side, which fused to form the heart,\r\n  but continued separate anteriorly. The two parts run for a little\r\n  distance toward the head of the embryo, ventral to the alimentary\r\n  canal, and then turn toward the dorsum, passing one on either side of\r\n  that tube to form the first aortic arch. Having reached the dorsum\r\n  they turn backward toward the tail end and form the dorsal aortae;\r\n  here, according to A.H. Young (_Studies in Anatomy_, Owens College,\r\n  1891 and 1900) they again turn toward the ventral side and become,\r\n  after a transitional stage, the _hypogastric, placental, allantoic_ or\r\n  _umbilical_ arteries. This authority does not believe that the middle\r\n  sacral artery of the adult is the real continuation of the single\r\n  median dorsal aorta into which the two parallel dorsal vessels just\r\n  mentioned soon coalesce, though until recently it has always been so\r\n  regarded. The anterior loop between the ventral and dorsal aortae\r\n  already described as the first aortic arch is included in the\r\n  _maxillary_ or _first visceral arch_ of the soft parts (see fig. 3,\r\n  _1_). Later, four other well-marked aortic arches grow behind this in\r\n  the more caudal visceral arches, so that there are altogether five\r\n  arterial arches on each side of the pharynx, through which the blood\r\n  can pass from the ventral to the dorsal aorta. Of these arches the\r\n  first soon disappears, but is probably partly represented in the adult\r\n  by the _internal maxillary_ artery, one branch of which, the\r\n  _infraorbital_, is enclosed in the upper jaw, while another, the\r\n  _inferior dental_, is surrounded by the lower jaw. Possibly the\r\n  ophthalmic artery also belongs to this arch. The second arch also\r\n  disappears, but the _posterior auricular_ and _occipital_ arteries\r\n  probably spring from it, and at an early period it passed through the\r\n  stapes as the transitory stapedial artery. The third arch forms the\r\n  beginning of the internal carotid. The fourth arch becomes the arch of\r\n  the adult aorta, between the origins of the left carotid and left\r\n  subclavian, on the left side, and the first part of the right\r\n  subclavian artery on the right. The apparent fifth arch on the left\r\n  side (fig. 3, _6_) remains all through foetal life as the _ductus\r\n  arteriosus_, and, as the lungs develop, the _pulmonary_ arteries are\r\n  derived from it. J.E.V. Boas and W. Zimmermann have shown that this\r\n  arch is in reality the sixth, and that there is a very transitory true\r\n  fifth arch in front of it (fig. 3, _5_). The part of the ventral aorta\r\n  from which this last arch rises is a single median vessel due to the\r\n  same fusion of the two primitive ventral aortae which precedes the\r\n  formation of the heart, but a spiral septum has appeared in it which\r\n  divides it in such a way that while the anterior or cephalic arches\r\n  communicate with the left ventricle of the heart, the last one\r\n  communicates with the right (see HEART). The fate of the ventral and\r\n  dorsal longitudinal vessels must now be followed. The fused part of\r\n  the two ventral aortae, just in front of the heart, forms the\r\n  ascending part of the adult aortic arch, and where this trunk divides\r\n  between the fifth and fourth arches (strictly speaking, the sixth and\r\n  fifth), the right one forms the _innominate_ (fig. 3, In.) and the\r\n  left one a very short part of the _transverse arch_ of the aorta until\r\n  the fourth arch comes off (see fig. 4). From this point to the origin\r\n  of the third arch is _common carotid_, and after that, to the head,\r\n  _external carotid_ on each side. The _dorsal longitudinal_ arteries on\r\n  the head side of the junction with the third arch form the _internal\r\n  carotids_. Between the third and fourth arches they are obliterated,\r\n  while on the caudal side of this, until the point of fusion is reached\r\n  on the dorsal side of the heart, the left artery forms the upper part\r\n  of the dorsal aorta while the right entirely disappears. Below this\r\n  point the _thoracic_ and _abdominal aortae_ are formed by the two\r\n  _primitive dorsal aortae_ which have fused to form a single median\r\n  vessel. As the limbs are developed, vessels bud out in them. The\r\n  _subclavian_ for the arm comes from the fourth aortic arch on each\r\n  side, while in the leg the main artery is a branch of the _caudal\r\n  arch_ which is curving ventralward to form the umbilical artery. From\r\n  the convexity of this arch the internal iliac and sciatic at first\r\n  carry the blood to the limb, as they do permanently in reptiles, but\r\n  later the external iliac and femoral become developed, and, as they\r\n  are on the concave side of the bend of the hip, while the sciatic is\r\n  on the convex, they have a mechanical advantage and become the\r\n  permanent main channel.\r\n\r\n  For further details see O. Hertwig, _Handbuch der vergleichenden und\r\n  experimentellen Entwickelungslehre der Wirbeltiere_ (Jena, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n  COMPARATIVE ANATOMY\r\n\r\n  In the Acrania the lancelet (Amphioxus) shows certain arrangements of\r\n  its arteries which are suggestive of the embryonic stages of the\r\n  higher vertebrates and Man. There is a median ventral aorta below the\r\n  pharynx, from which branchial arteries run up on each side between the\r\n  branchial clefts, where the blood is aerated, to join two dorsal\r\n  aortae which run back side by side until the hind end of the pharynx\r\n  is reached; here they fuse to form a median vessel from which branches\r\n  are distributed to the straight intestine. There is no heart, but the\r\n  ventral aorta is contractile, and the blood is driven forward in it\r\n  and backward in the dorsal aortae. The branchial arteries are very\r\n  numerous, and cannot be homologized closely with the five (originally\r\n  six) pairs of aortic arches in Man.\r\n\r\n  In the fish the ventral aorta gives rise to five afferent branchial\r\n  arteries carrying the blood to the gills, though these may not all\r\n  come off as independent trunks from the aorta. From the gills the\r\n  afferent branchials carry the blood to the median dorsal aorta. As\r\n  pectoral and pelvic fins are now developed, subclavian and iliac\r\n  arteries are found rising from the dorsal aorta, though the aorta\r\n  itself is continued directly backward as the caudal artery into the\r\n  tail. In the Dipnoi or mud fish, in which the swim bladder is\r\n  converted into a functional lung, the hindmost afferent branchial\r\n  artery, corresponding to the fifth (strictly speaking the sixth)\r\n  aortic arch of the human embryo, gives off on each side a pulmonary\r\n  artery to that structure.\r\n\r\n  The arrangement of the branchial aortic arches in the tailed Amphibia\r\n  (Urodela), and in the tadpole stage of the tailless forms (Anura),\r\n  makes it probable that the generalized vertebrate has six (if not\r\n  more) pairs of these instead of the five which are evident in the\r\n  human embryo. Four pairs of arches are present, the first of which is\r\n  the carotid and corresponds to the third of Man; the second is the\r\n  true aortic arch on each side; the third undergoes great reduction or\r\n  disappears when the gills atrophy, and is very transitory in the\r\n  Mammalia (fig. 3, _5_), while the fourth is the one from which the\r\n  pulmonary artery is developed when the lungs appear, and corresponds\r\n  to the nominal fifth, though really the sixth arch, of the higher\r\n  forms (fig. 3, _6_). The dorsal part of this sixth arch remains as a\r\n  pervious vessel in the Urodela, joining the pulmonary arch to the\r\n  dorsal aorta. In the central part of the carotid arch the vessel\r\n  breaks up into a plexus, for a short distance forming the so-called\r\n  carotid gland, which has an important effect upon the adult\r\n  circulation of the Amphibia. In the Reptilia the great arteries are\r\n  arranged on the same plan as in the adult Amphibia, but the carotid\r\n  arch retains its dorsal communication with the systematic aortic arch\r\n  on each side, and this communication is known as the duct of Botalli\r\n  (fig. 3, D.B.). In this class, as in the Amphibia, one great artery,\r\n  the coeliaco-mesenteric, usually supplies the liver, spleen, stomach\r\n  and anterior part of the intestines; this is a point of some interest\r\n  when it is noticed how very close together the coeliac axis and\r\n  superior mesenteric arteries rise from the abdominal aorta in Man.\r\n\r\n  In the Birds the right fourth arch alone remains as the aorta, the\r\n  dorsal part of the left corresponding arch being obliterated. From the\r\n  arch of the aorta rise two symmetrical innominates, each of which\r\n  divides later into a carotid and subclavian. The blood path from the\r\n  aorta to the hind limb in the Amphibia, Reptilia and Aves, is a dorsal\r\n  one, and passes through the internal iliac and sciatic to the back of\r\n  the thigh, and so to the popliteal space; the external iliac is, if it\r\n  is developed at all, only a small branch to the pelvis.\r\n\r\n  In the Mammalia the fourth left arch becomes the aorta, the\r\n  corresponding right one being obliterated, but several cases have been\r\n  recorded in Man in which both arches have persisted, as they do in the\r\n  reptiles (H. Leboucq, _Ann. Sci. Med. Gand_, 1894, p. 7). Examples\r\n  have also been found of a right aortic arch, as in birds, while a very\r\n  common human abnormality is that in which the dorsal part of the\r\n  fourth right arch persists, and from it the right subclavian artery\r\n  arises (see fig. 3).\r\n\r\n  The commonest arrangement of the great branches of the aortic arch in\r\n  Mammals is that in which the innominate and left carotid arise by a\r\n  single short trunk, while the left subclavian comes off later; this is\r\n  also Man's commonest abnormality. Sometimes, especially among the\r\n  Ungulata, all the branches may rise from one common trunk; at other\r\n  times two innominate arteries may be present; this is commonest in the\r\n  Cheiroptera, Insectivora and Cetacea. It is extremely rare to find all\r\n  four large arteries rising independently from the aorta, though it has\r\n  been seen in the Koala (F.G. Parsons, \"Mammalian Aortic Arch,\" _Journ.\r\n  of Anat._ vol. xxxvi. p. 389). The human arrangement of the common\r\n  iliacs is not constant among mammals, for in some the external and\r\n  internal iliacs rise independently from the aorta, and this is\r\n  probably the more primitive arrangement. The middle sacral artery has\r\n  already been referred to. A.H. Young and A. Robinson believe, on\r\n  embryological grounds, that this artery in mammals is not homologous\r\n  with the caudal artery of the fish, and is not the direct continuation\r\n  of the aorta; it is an artery which usually gives off two or more\r\n  collateral branches, and sometimes, as in the Ornithorynchus and some\r\n  edentates, breaks up into a network of branches which reunite and so\r\n  form what is known as a _rete mirabile_. These retia mirabilia are\r\n  often found in other parts of the mammalian body, though their\r\n  function is still not satisfactorily explained. The way in which the\r\n  blood is carried to the foot in the pronograde mammals differs from\r\n  that of Man; a large branch called the internal saphenous comes off\r\n  the common femoral in the lower third of the thigh, and this runs down\r\n  the inner side of the leg to the foot. This arrangement is quite\r\n  convenient as long as the knee is flexed, but when it comes to be\r\n  extended, as in the erect posture, the artery is greatly stretched,\r\n  and it is much easier for the blood to pass to the foot through the\r\n  anterior and posterior tibials. A vestige of this saphenous artery,\r\n  however, remains in Man as the anastomotica magna.\r\n\r\n  The literature of the Comparative Anatomy of the Arteries up to 1902\r\n  will be found in R. Wiedersheim's _Vergleichende Anatomie der\r\n  Wirbeltiere_ (Jena, 1902). The morphology of the Iliac Arteries is\r\n  described by G. Levi, _Archivio Italiano di Anat. ed Embriol._, vol.\r\n  i. (1902).     (F. G.

S. of the last named. Pop. 5000. It has an\r\nEvangelical church, an agricultural college and some manufactures of\r\nmachinery, sugar and boots. Its brine springs, known as early as the\r\n15th century, are still frequented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTESIAN WELLS, the name properly applied to water-springs rising above\r\nthe surface of the ground by natural hydrostatic pressure, on boring a\r\nsmall hole down through a series of strata to a water-carrying bed\r\nenclosed between two impervious layers; the name is, however, sometimes\r\nloosely applied to any deep well, even when the water is obtained by\r\npumping. In Europe this mode of well-boring was first practised in the\r\nFrench province of Artois, whence the name of Artesian is derived. At\r\nAire, in that province, there is a well from which the water has\r\ncontinued steadily to flow to a height of 11 feet above the ground for\r\nmore than a century; and there is, within the old Carthusian convent at\r\nLillers, another which dates from the 12th century, and which still\r\nflows. But unmistakable traces of much more ancient bored springs appear\r\nin Lombardy, in Asia Minor, in Persia, in China, in Egypt, in Algeria,\r\nand even in the great desert of Sahara. (See WELL.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEVELDE, JACOB VAN (c. 1290-1345), Flemish statesman, was born at\r\nGhent about 1290. He sprang from one of the wealthy commercial families\r\nof this great industrial city, his father's name being probably William\r\nvan Artevelde. His brother John, a rich cloth merchant, took a leading\r\npart in public affairs during the first decades of the 14th century.\r\nJacob, who according to tradition was a brewer by trade, spent three\r\nyears in amassing quietly a large fortune. He was twice married, the\r\nsecond time to Catherine de Coster, whose family was of considerable\r\ninfluence in Ghent. Not till 1337, when the outbreak of hostilities\r\nbetween France and England threatened to injure seriously the industrial\r\nwelfare of his native town, did Jacob van Artevelde make his first\r\nappearance as a political leader. As the Flemish cities depended upon\r\nEngland for the supply of the wool for their staple industry of weaving,\r\nhe boldly came forward, as a tribune of the people, and at a great\r\nmeeting at the monastery of Biloke unfolded his scheme of an alliance of\r\nthe Flemish towns, with those of Brabant, Holland and Hainaut, to\r\nmaintain an armed neutrality in the dynastic struggle between Edward\r\nIII. and Philip VI. of France. His efforts were successful. Bruges,\r\nYpres and other towns formed a league with Ghent, in which town\r\nArtevelde, with the title of captain-general, henceforth until his death\r\nexercised almost dictatorial authority. His first step was to conclude a\r\ncommercial treaty with England. The efforts of the count of Flanders to\r\noverthrow the power of Artevelde by force of arms completely failed, and\r\nhe was compelled at Bruges to sign a treaty (June 21, 1338) sanctioning\r\nthe federation of the three towns, Ghent, Bruges and Ypres, henceforth\r\nknown as the \"Three members of Flanders.\" This was the first of a series\r\nof treaties, made during the year 1339-1340, which gradually brought\r\ninto the federation all the towns and provinces of the Netherlands. The\r\npolicy of neutrality, however, proved impracticable, and the Flemish\r\ntowns, under the leadership of Artevelde, openly took the side of the\r\nEnglish king, with whom a close alliance was concluded. Artevelde now\r\nreached the height of his power, concluding alliances with kings, and\r\npublicly associating with them on equal terms. Under his able\r\nadministration trade flourished, and Ghent rose rapidly in wealth and\r\nimportance. His well-nigh despotic rule awoke at last among his\r\ncompatriots jealousy and resentment. The proposal of Artevelde to disown\r\nthe sovereignty of Louis, count of Flanders, and to recognize in its\r\nplace that of Edward, prince of Wales (the Black Prince), gave rise to\r\nviolent dissatisfaction. A popular insurrection broke out in Ghent, and\r\nArtevelde fell into the hands of the crowd and was murdered on the 24th\r\nof July 1345.\r\n\r\nThe great services that he rendered to Ghent and to his country have in\r\nlater times been recognized. A statue was erected in his native town on\r\nthe Marche du Vendredi, and was unveiled by Leopold I., king of the\r\nBelgians, on the 13th of September 1863.\r\n\r\n  See J. Hutten, _James and Philip van Artevelde_ (London, 1882); W.J.\r\n  Ashley, _James and Philip van Artevelde_ (London, 1883); P. Nameche,\r\n  _Les van Artevelde et leur epoque_ (Louvain, 1887); L. Vanderkindere,\r\n  _Le Siecle des Arteveldes_ (Brussels, 1879).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTEVELDE, PHILIP VAN (c. 1340-1382), youngest son of the above, and\r\ngodson of Queen Philippa of England, who held him in her arms at his\r\nbaptism, lived in retirement until 1381. The Ghenters had in that year\r\nrisen in revolt against the oppression of the count of Flanders, and\r\nPhilip, now forty years of age, and without any military or political\r\nexperience, was offered the supreme command. His name awakened general\r\nenthusiasm. At first his efforts were attended by considerable success.\r\nHe defeated Louis de Male, count of Flanders, before Bruges, entered\r\nthat city in triumph, and was soon master of all Flanders. But France\r\ntook up the cause of the Flemish count, and a splendid French army was\r\nled across the frontier by the young king Charles VI. in person.\r\nArtevelde advanced to meet the enemy at the head of a burgher army of\r\nsome 50,000 Flemings. The armies met at Roosebeke near Courtrai, with\r\nthe result that the Flemings were routed with terrible loss, Philip\r\nhimself being among the slain. This happened on the 27th of November\r\n1382.\r\n\r\n  The brief but stirring career of this popular leader is admirably\r\n  treated in Sir Henry Taylor's drama, _Philip van Artevelde_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART GALLERIES. An art gallery (by which, as distinguished from more\r\ngeneral MUSEUMS OF ART, q.v., is here meant one specially for pictures)\r\nepitomizes so many phases of human thought and imagination that it\r\nconnotes much more than a mere collection of paintings. In its technical\r\nand aesthetic aspect the gallery shows the treatment of colour, form and\r\ncomposition. In its historical aspect we find the true portraits of\r\ngreat men of the past; we can observe their habits of life, their\r\nmanners, their dress, the architecture of their times, and the religious\r\nworship of the period in which they lived. Regarded collectively, the\r\nart of a country epitomizes the whole development of the people that\r\nproduced it. Most important of all is the emotional aspect of painting,\r\nwhich must enter less or more into every picture worthy of notice. To\r\ntake examples from the British National Gallery: pathos in its most\r\nintense degree will be found in Francia's \"Pieta\"; dignity in Velasquez'\r\nportrait of Admiral Pareja; homeliness in Van Eyck's portrait of Jan\r\nArnolfini and his wife; the interpretation of the varying moods of\r\nnature in the work of Turner or Hobbema; nothing can be more devotional\r\nthan the canvases of Bellini or his Umbrian contemporaries. So also the\r\nruling sentiments of mankind--mysticism, drama and imagination--are the\r\nkeynotes of other great conceptions of the artist. All this may be at\r\nthe command of those who visit the art gallery; but without patience,\r\ncare and study the higher meaning will be lost to the spectator. The\r\npicture which \"tells its own story\" is often the least didactic, for it\r\nhas no inner or deeper lesson to reveal; it gives no stimulus or\r\ntraining to the eye, quick as that organ may be--_segnius irritant\r\nanimos_--to translate sight into thought. In brief, the painter asks\r\nthat his [Greek: aethos] may be shared as much as possible by the man\r\nwho looks at the painting--the art above all others in which it is most\r\nneedful to share the master's spirit if his work is to be fully\r\nappreciated. So, too, the art gallery, recalling the gentler\r\nassociations of the past amidst surroundings of harmonious beauty and\r\nits attendant sense of comfort, is essentially a place of rest for the\r\nmind and eye. In the more famous galleries where the wealth of paintings\r\nallows a grouping of pictures according to their respective schools, one\r\nmay choose the country, the epoch, the style or even the emotion best\r\nsuited to one's taste. According to this theory, though imperfectly\r\nrealized owing to the paucity of examples, the philosophic influence of\r\nart galleries is becoming more widely extended; and in its further\r\ndevelopment will be found an ever-growing source of interest,\r\ninstruction and scholarship to the community. The most suitable method\r\nof describing art galleries is to classify them by their types and\r\ncontents rather than by the various countries to which they belong. Thus\r\nthe great representative galleries of the world which possess works of\r\nevery school are grouped together, followed by state galleries which are\r\nnot remarkable for more than one school of national art. Municipal\r\ngalleries are divided into those which have general collections, and\r\nthose which are notable for special collections. Churches which have\r\ngood paintings, together with those which are now secularized, are\r\ntreated separately; while the collections in the Vatican and private\r\nhouses are described together. The remaining galleries, such as the\r\nSalon or the Royal Academy, are periodical or commercial in character,\r\nand are important in the development of modern art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Plan of the National Gallery, London.\r\n\r\n  North Vestibule, Early Italian Schools:\r\n      I.

Among these the British\r\nNational Gallery holds a high place. The collection was founded in 1824\r\nby the acquisition of the Angerstein pictures. Its accessions are mainly\r\ngoverned by the parliamentary grant of L5000 to L10,000 a year, a sum\r\nwhich has occasionally been enlarged to permit special purchases. Thus,\r\nin 1871, the Peel collection of seventy-seven pictures was bought for\r\nL75,000, and in 1885 the Ansidei Madonna (Raphael) and Van Dyck's\r\nportrait of Charles I. were bought, the one for L70,000 and the other\r\nfor L17,500. In 1890 the government gave L25,000 to meet a gift of\r\nL30,000 made by three gentlemen to acquire three portraits by Moroni,\r\nVelazquez and Holbein. The most important private gifts were the Vernon\r\ngift in 1847, the Turner bequest in 1856 and the Wynne-Ellis legacy in\r\n1876. Since 1905 the Art Collections Fund, a society of private\r\nsubscribers, has also been responsible for important additions to the\r\ngallery, notably the Venus of Velazquez (1907). The gallery contains\r\nvery few poor works and all schools are well represented, with the sole\r\nexception of the French school. This, however, can be amply studied at\r\nHertford House (Wallace Collection), which, besides Dutch, Spanish and\r\nBritish pictures of the highest value, contains twenty examples of\r\nGreuze, fifteen by Pater, nineteen by Boucher, eleven by Watteau and\r\nfifteen by Meissonier. The national gallery of pictures at Berlin\r\n(Kaiser Friedrich Museum), like the British National Gallery, is\r\nremarkable for its variety of schools and painters, and for the select\r\ntype of pictures shown. During the last twenty-five years of the 19th\r\ncentury, the development of this collection was even more striking than\r\nthat of the English gallery. Italian and Dutch examples are specially\r\nnumerous, though every school but the British (here as elsewhere) is\r\nreally well seen. The purchase grant is considerable, and is well\r\napplied. Two other German capitals have collections of international\r\nimportance--Dresden and Munich. The former is famous for the Sistine\r\nMadonna by Raphael, a work of such supreme excellence that there is a\r\ntendency to overlook other Italian pictures of celebrity by Titian,\r\nGiorgione and Correggio. Munich (Old Pinakothek) has examples of all the\r\nbest masters, the South German school being particularly noticeable. The\r\narrangement is good, and the methods of exhibition make this one of the\r\nmost pleasant galleries on the continent. Vienna has the Imperial\r\nGallery, a collection which in point of number cannot be considered\r\nlarge, as there are not more than 1700 pictures. This, however, is in\r\nitself a safeguard, like the wise provision in a statute of 1856 for\r\nenabling the English authorities to dispose of pictures \"unfit for the\r\ncollection, or not required.\" It avoids the undue multiplication of\r\ncanvases, and the overcrowding so noticeable in many Italian galleries\r\nwhere first-rate pictures hang too high to be examined. Thus the\r\nViennese gallery, besides the intrinsic value of its pictures (Albert\r\nDurer's chief work is there), is admirably adapted for study. The best\r\ngallery in Russia (St Petersburg, Hermitage) was made entirely by royal\r\nefforts, having been founded by Peter the Great, and much enlarged by\r\nthe empress Catherine. It contains the collections of Crozat, Bruhl and\r\nWalpole. There are about 1800 works, the schools of Flanders and Italy\r\nbeing of signal merit; and there are at least thirty-five genuine\r\nexamples by Rembrandt. The French collection (Louvre Palace, Paris) is\r\none of the most important of all. In 1880 it was undoubtedly the first\r\ngallery in Europe, but its supremacy has since been menaced by other\r\nestablishments where acquisitions are made more frequently and with\r\ngreater care, and where the system of classification is such that the\r\nvalue of the pictures is enhanced rather than diminished by their\r\ndisplay. In 1900 it was partly rearranged with great effect. The feature\r\nof the Louvre is the Salon Carre, a room in which the supposed finest\r\ncanvases in the collection are kept together, pictures of world-wide\r\nfame, representing all schools. It is now generally accepted that this\r\nsystem of selection not only lowers the standard of individual schools\r\nelsewhere by withdrawing their best pictures, but does not add to the\r\naesthetic or educational value of the masterpieces themselves. In\r\nFlorence the Tribuna room of the Uffizi gallery is a similar case in\r\npoint. Probably the two most widely known pictures in the Louvre are\r\nWatteau's second \"Embarquement pour Cythere,\" and the \"Monna Lisa,\" a\r\nportrait by Leonardo da Vinci, but each school has many unique examples.\r\nThe original drawings should be noted, being of equal importance to the\r\ncollection preserved at the British Museum. The last collection to be\r\nmentioned under this heading is that known as the Royal Galleries in\r\nFlorence, housed in the Pitti and Uffizi palaces. In some ways this\r\ncollection does not represent general painting sufficiently to justify\r\nits inclusion with the galleries of Berlin, Paris and London. On the\r\nother hand, the great number of Italian pictures of vital importance to\r\nthe history of international art makes this one of the finest existing\r\ncollections. The two great palaces, dating from the 15th and 16th\r\ncenturies, are joined together and contain the Medici pictures. They\r\nform the largest gallery in the world, and though many of the rooms are\r\nsmall and badly lighted, and although many paintings have suffered from\r\nthoughtless restoration, they have a charm and attraction which\r\ncertainly make them the most popular galleries in Europe. The Pitti has\r\nten Raphaels and excellent examples of Andrea del Sarto, Giorgione and\r\nPerugino. The Uffizi is more representative of non-Italian schools, but\r\nis best known for its works by Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nMichelangelo and Sodoma, the schools of Tuscany and Umbria forming the\r\nbulk of both collections. Admission to the galleries is by payment, and\r\nthe small income derived from this source is devoted to maintaining and\r\nenlarging the collections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Plan of the first and second floors of the\r\nImperial Gallery, Vienna.]\r\n\r\nAs to the ground plans of the National Gallery, London (fig. 1), and of\r\nthe Imperial Gallery at Vienna (fig. 2), it will be observed that while\r\nthe former has the advantage of uniform top-light, the galleries at\r\nVienna possess the most ample facilities for minute classification,\r\nsmall rooms or \"cabinets\" opening from each large room. Special rooms\r\nare also provided for drawings and water-colours, while special ranges\r\nof rooms are used by copyists and those responsible for the repair and\r\npreservation of the pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  State galleries of national schools.\r\n\r\nThough not so comprehensive as the great collections just described, the\r\nstate galleries showing national schools of painting and little else are\r\nof striking interest. In England the National Gallery of British Art\r\n(known as the Tate Gallery) contains British pictures. The corresponding\r\ncollection of modern French art is at Paris (Luxembourg Palace), Berlin,\r\nRome, Dresden, Vienna and Madrid having analogous galleries. The\r\nVictoria and Albert Museum has also numerous British pictures,\r\nespecially in water-colour, and the National Portrait Gallery, founded\r\nin 1856, and since 1896 housed in its permanent home, is instructive in\r\nthis connexion, though many of its pictures are the work of foreign\r\nartists. The national collections at Dublin and Edinburgh may be\r\nmentioned here, though most schools are represented. Brussels and\r\nAntwerp are remarkable for fine examples of Flemish art--Matsys, Memlinc\r\nand Van Eyck of the primitive schools, Rubens and Van Dyck of the later\r\nperiod. The collections at Amsterdam (Ryks Museum) and the Hague\r\n(Mauritshuis) are a revelation to those who have only studied Rembrandt,\r\nFranz Hals, Van der Helst, and other Dutch portrait painters outside\r\nHolland; and in the former gallery especially, the pictures are arranged\r\nin a manner showing them to the best advantage. The Museo del Prado is\r\neven more noteworthy, for the fifty examples of Velasquez (outrivalling\r\nthe Italian pictures, important as they are) make a visit to Madrid\r\nimperative to those who wish to realize the achievements of Spanish art.\r\nChristiania, Stockholm and Copenhagen have large collections of\r\nScandinavian art, and the cities of Budapest and Basel have galleries of\r\nsome importance. In Italy the state maintains twelve collections, mainly\r\ndevoted to pictorial art. Of these the best are situated at Bologna,\r\nLucca, Parma, Venice, Modena, Turin and Milan. In each case the local\r\nschool of painting is fully represented. In Rome the Corsini and\r\nBorghese Galleries, the latter being the most catholic in the city,\r\ncontain superb examples, some of them accepted masterpieces of Italian\r\nart; there are also good foreign pictures, but their number is limited.\r\nThe Accademia at Florence should also be noted as the most important\r\nstate gallery of early Italian art. The central Italian Renaissance can\r\nbe more adequately studied here than in the Pitti. The \"Primavera\" of\r\nBotticelli, and the \"Last Judgment\" by Fra Angelico are perhaps the\r\nbest-known works. The large statue of David by Michelangelo is also in\r\nthis gallery, which, on the whole, is one of the most remarkable in\r\nItaly. Speaking broadly, these national galleries scattered throughout\r\nthe country are not well arranged or classified; and though some are\r\nkept in fine old buildings, beautiful in themselves, the lighting is\r\noften indifferent, and it is with difficulty that the pictures can be\r\nseen. In nearly every case admission fees are charged every day,\r\nfestivals and Sundays excepted; few pictures are bought, acquisitions\r\nbeing chiefly made by removing pictures from churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Municipal galleries of special schools.\r\n\r\nMany towns own collections of well-merited repute. In Italy such\r\ngalleries are common, and among them may be noted Siena, with Sodoma and\r\nhis school; Venice with Tintoretto (Doge's Palace); Genoa, with the\r\ngreat palaces Balbi and Rosso; Vicenza (Montagna and school), Ferrara\r\n(Dosso and school), Bergamo and Milan (north Italian schools). Other\r\ncivic collections of Italian art are maintained at Verona, Pisa, Rome,\r\nPerugia and Padua. In Holland, Haarlem, Leiden, Rotterdam and the Hague\r\nhave galleries supplemental to those of the state, and are remarkable in\r\nshowing the brilliance of artists like Grebber, de Bray and Ravesteyn,\r\nwho are usually ignored. Birmingham and Manchester have good examples of\r\nmodern British art. Moscow (Tretiakoff collection) has modern Russian\r\npictures, and contemporary German and French work will be found in all\r\nthe galleries of these two countries included in the municipal group.\r\nCollections of French work are found at Amiens, Rouen, Nancy, Tours, Le\r\nMans and Angers, but large as these civic collections are, sometimes\r\ncontaining six and eight hundred canvases, few of their pictures are\r\nreally good, many being the enormous patriotic canvases marked \"Don de\r\nl'Etat,\" which do not confer distinction on the galleries. Cologne has\r\nthe central collection of the early Rhenish school; Nuremberg is\r\nremarkable for early German work (Wohlgemut, &c.). Stuttgart, Cassel\r\n(Dutch) and Hamburg (with a considerable number of British pictures) are\r\nalso noteworthy, together with Brunswick, Hanover, Augsburg, Darmstadt\r\nand Dusseldorf, where German and Dutch art preponderate. Seville is\r\nfamous for twenty-five examples of Murillo, and there are old Spanish\r\npaintings at Valencia, Cordova and Cadiz.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Municipal galleries of general schools.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the best of the municipal galleries of general schools\r\nare at Liverpool (early Flemish and British), and at Glasgow (Scottish\r\npainters, Rembrandt, Van der Goes and Venetian schools). In France there\r\nare very large galleries at Tours, Montpellier, Lyons (Perugino,\r\nRubens), Dijon and Grenoble (Italian), Valenciennes (Watteau and\r\nschool), while Rennes, Lille and Marseilles have first-rate collections.\r\nNantes, Orleans, Besancon, Cherbourg and Caen have also many paintings,\r\nFrench for the most part, but with occasional foreign pictures of real\r\nimportance, presented by the state during the Napoleonic conquests, and\r\nnot returned on the declaration of peace as were the works of art\r\namassed in Paris. Some of the American collections have in recent years\r\nmade a great advance in their acquisition of good pictures. At Boston\r\n(Museum of Fine Arts) all schools are represented, so too at the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which is strong in Italian and\r\nDutch works. Modern French and Flemish art is a feature of the Academy\r\nat Philadelphia, at the Lenox Library (New York), and at Chicago, where\r\nthere are good examples of Millet, Constable and Rembrandt. The Corcoran\r\nbequest at Washington is of minor importance. The best civic collection\r\nin Germany of this class is the Stadel Institute at Frankfort (Van Eyck,\r\nChristus, early Flemish and Italian).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Churches.\r\n\r\nAs the great bulk of religious painting was executed for church\r\ndecoration, there are still numberless churches which may be considered\r\npicture galleries. Thus at Antwerp cathedral the Rubens paintings are\r\nremarkable; at Ghent, Van Eyck; at Bruges (hospital of St John),\r\nMemlinc; at Pisa, the Campo Santo (early Tuscan schools); at Sant'\r\nApollinare, Ravenna, primitive Italo-Byzantine mosaics; at Siena,\r\nPinturichio. Examples could be multiplied indefinitely--in Italy alone\r\nthere are 80,000 churches and chapels, in all of which pictorial art has\r\nbeen employed. In Italy, besides the church \"galleries\" still used for\r\nreligious services, there are some which have been secularized and are\r\nnow used as museums, e.g. Certosa at Pavia, and San Vitale at Ravenna\r\n(mosaics); at Florence, the Scalzo (Andrea del Sarto); San Marco (Fra\r\nAngelico); the Riccardi and Pazzi chapels (Gozzoli and Perugino); at\r\nMilan, in the Santa Maria delle Grazie, the \"Last Supper,\" by Leonardo,\r\nand at Padua, the famous Arena chapel (Giotto).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Private and semi-private galleries.\r\n\r\nThe Vatican galleries, though best known for their statuary, have fine\r\nexamples of painting, chiefly of the Italian school; the most famous\r\neasel picture is Raphael's \"Transfiguration,\" but the Stanze, apartments\r\nentirely decorated by painting, are even more famous. In England three\r\nroyal palaces are open to the public--Hampton Court (Mantegna), Windsor\r\n(Van Dyck, Zuccarelli), and Kensington (portraits). At Buckingham Palace\r\nthe Dutch pictures are admirable, and Queen Victoria lent the celebrated\r\nRaphael cartoons to the Victoria and Albert Museum. Semi-private\r\ncollections belong to Dulwich College (Velasquez and Watteau), Oxford\r\nUniversity (Italian drawings), the Soane Museum (Hogarth and English\r\nschool), and the Royal Academy (Leonardo). Among private collections the\r\nmost important are the Harrach, and Prince Liechtenstein (Vienna), J.\r\nPierpont Morgan (including miniatures), Mrs J. Gardner of Boston\r\n(Italian), Prince Corsini (Florence). In Great Britain there are immense\r\nriches in private houses, though many collections have been dispersed.\r\nThe most noteworthy (1909) belong to the dukes of Devonshire and\r\nWestminster, Lord Ellesmere, Captain Holford (including the masterpiece\r\nof Cuyp), Ludwig Mond, Lord Lansdowne, Miss Rothschild. The finest\r\nprivate collection is at Panshanger, formerly the seat of Lord Cowper,\r\nthe gallery of Van Dyck's work being quite the best in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Periodical and commercial.\r\n\r\nMany galleries are devoted to periodical exhibitions in London; the\r\nRoyal Academy is the leading agency of this character, having held\r\nexhibitions since 1769. Its loan exhibitions of Old Masters are most\r\nimportant. Similar enterprises are the New Gallery, opened in 1888, the\r\nGrafton Gallery, and others. There are also old-established societies of\r\netchers, water-colourists, &c. A feature common to these exhibitions is\r\nthat the public always pays for admission, though they differ from the\r\ncommercial exhibitions, becoming more common every year, in which the\r\nwork of a single school or painter is shown for profit. But the annual\r\nexhibitions at the Guildhall, under the auspices of the corporation, are\r\nfree. The great periodical exhibition of French art is known as the\r\nSalon, and for some years it has had a rival in the Champ de Mars\r\nexhibition. These two societies are now respectively housed in the Grand\r\nPalais and Petit Palais, in the Champs Elysees, which were erected in\r\nconnexion with the Paris Exhibition of 1900, but with the ultimate\r\nobject of being devoted to the service of the two Salons. Berlin, Rome,\r\nVienna and other Continental towns have regular exhibitions of original\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n  The best history of art galleries is found in their official and other\r\n  catalogues, see article MUSEUMS.

(B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHRITIS (from Gr. [Greek: arthron], a joint), inflammation of the\r\njoints, in various forms of what are generally called gout and\r\nrheumatism (qq.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHROPODA, a name, denoting the possession by certain animals of\r\njointed limbs, now applied to one of the three sub-phyla into which one\r\nof the great phyla (or primary branches) of coelomocoelous animals--the\r\nAppendiculata-is divided; the other two being respectively the\r\nChaetopoda and the Rotifera. The word \"Arthropoda\" was first used in\r\nclassification by Siebold and Stannius (_Lehrbuch der vergleich.\r\nAnatomie_, Berlin, 1845) as that of a primary division of animals, the\r\nothers recognized in that treatise being Protozoa, Zoophyta, Vermes,\r\nMollusca and Vertebrata. The names Condylopoda and Gnathopoda have been\r\nsubsequently proposed for the same group. The word refers to the\r\njointing of the chitinized exo-skeleton of the limbs or lateral\r\nappendages of the animals included, which are, roughly speaking, the\r\nCrustacea, Arachnida, Hexapoda (so-called \"true insects\"), Centipedes\r\nand Millipedes. This primary group was set up to indicate the residuum\r\nof Cuvier's Articulata when his class Annelides (the modern Chaetopoda)\r\nwas removed from that _embranchement_. At the same time C.T.E. von\r\nSiebold and H. Stannius renovated the group Vermes of Linnaeus, and\r\nplaced in it the Chaetopods and the parasitic worms of Cuvier, besides\r\nthe Rotifers and Turbellarian worms.[1]\r\n\r\nThe result of the knowledge gained in the last quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury has been to discredit altogether the group Vermes (see WORM),\r\nthus set up and so largely accepted by German writers even at the\r\npresent day. We have, in fact, returned very nearly to Cuvier's\r\nconception of a great division or branch, which he called Articulata,\r\nincluding the Arthropoda and the Chaetopoda (Annelides of Lamarck, a\r\nname adopted by Cuvier), and differing from it only by the inclusion of\r\nthe Rotifera. The name Articulata, introduced by Cuvier, has not been\r\nretained by subsequent writers. The same, or nearly the same, assemblage\r\nof animals has been called Entomozoaria by de Blainville (1822),\r\nArthrozoa by Burmeister (1843), Entomozoa or Annellata by H.\r\nMilne-Edwards (1855), and Annulosa by Alexander M'Leay (1819), who was\r\nfollowed by Huxley (1856). The character pointed to by all these terms\r\nis that of a ring-like segmentation of the body. This, however, is not\r\nthe character to which we now ascribe the chief weight as evidence of\r\nthe genetic affinity and monophyletic (uni-ancestral) origin of the\r\nChaetopods, Rotifers and Arthropods. It is the existence in each ring of\r\nthe body of a pair of hollow _lateral appendages_ or _parapodia_, moved\r\nby intrinsic muscles and penetrated by blood-spaces, which is the\r\nleading fact indicating the affinities of these great sub-phyla, and\r\nuniting them as blood-relations. The parapodia (fig. 8) of the marine\r\nbranchiate worms are the same things genetically as the \"legs\" of\r\nCrustacea and Insects (figs. 10 and 11). Hence the term Appendiculata\r\nwas introduced by Lankester (preface to the English edition of\r\nGegenbaur's _Comparative Anatomy_, 1878) to indicate the group. The\r\nrelationships of the Arthropoda thus stated are shown in the subjoined\r\n\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n                          / Sub-phylum 1. Rotifera.\r\n  Phylum--APPENDICULATA  <      \"      2. Chaetopoda.\r\n                          \\     \"      3. Arthropoda.\r\n\r\nThe ROTIFERA are characterized by the retention of what appears in\r\nMolluscs and Chaetopods as an embryonic organ, the velum or ciliated\r\nprae-oral girdle, as a locomotor and food-seizing apparatus, and by the\r\nreduction of the muscular parapodia to a rudimentary or non-existent\r\ncondition in all present surviving forms except _Pedalion_. In many\r\nimportant respects they are degenerate--reduced both in size and\r\nelaboration of structure.\r\n\r\nThe CHAETOPODA are characterized by the possession of horny epidermic\r\nchaetae embedded in the integument and moved by muscles. Probably the\r\nchaetae preceded the development of parapodia, and by their\r\nconcentration and that of the muscular bundles connected with them at\r\nthe sides of each segment, led directly to the evolution of the\r\nparapodia. The parapodia of Chaetopoda are never coated with dense\r\nchitin, and are, therefore, never converted into jaws; the primitive\r\n\"head-lobe\" or prostomium persists, and frequently carries eyes and\r\nsensory tentacles. Further, in all members of the sub-phylum Chaetopoda\r\nthe relative position of the prostomium, mouth and peristomium or first\r\nring of the body, retains its primitive character. We do not find in\r\nChaetopoda that parapodia, belonging to primitively post-oral rings or\r\nbody-segments (called \"somites,\" as proposed by H. Milne-Edwards), pass\r\nin front of the mouth by adaptational shifting of the oral aperture.\r\n(See, however, 8.)\r\n\r\nThe ARTHROPODA might be better called the \"Gnathopoda,\" since their\r\ndistinctive character is, that one or more pairs of appendages behind\r\nthe mouth are densely chitinized and turned (fellow to fellow on\r\nopposite sides) towards one another so as to act as jaws. This is\r\nfacilitated by an important general change in the position of the\r\nparapodia; their basal attachments are all more ventral in position than\r\nin the Chaetopoda, and tend to approach from the two sides towards the\r\nmid-ventral line. Very usually (but not in the Onychophora =\r\n_Peripatus_) all the parapodia are plated with chitin secreted by the\r\nepidermis, and divided into a series of joints--giving the\r\n\"arthropodous\" or hinged character.\r\n\r\nThere are other remarkable and distinctive features of structure which\r\nhold the Arthropoda together, and render it impossible to conceive of\r\nthem as having a polyphyletic origin, that is to say, as having\r\noriginated separately by two or three distinct lines of descent from\r\nlower animals; and, on the contrary, establish the view that they have\r\nbeen developed from a single line of primitive Gnathopods which arose by\r\nmodification of parapodiate annulate worms not very unlike some of the\r\nexisting Chaetopods. These additional features are the following--(1)\r\nAll existing Arthropoda have an ostiate heart and have undergone\r\n\"phleboedesis,\" that is to say, the peripheral portions of the\r\nblood-vascular system are not fine tubes as they are in the Chaetopoda\r\nand as they were in the hypothetical ancestors of Arthropoda, but are\r\nswollen so as to obliterate to a large extent the coelom, whilst the\r\nseparate veins entering the dorsal vessel or heart have coalesced,\r\nleaving valvate ostia (see fig. 1) by which the blood passes from a\r\npericardial blood-sinus formed by the fused veins into the dorsal vessel\r\nor heart (see Lankester's _Zoology_, part ii., introductory chapter,\r\n1900). The only exception to this is in the case of minute degenerate\r\nforms where the heart has disappeared altogether. The rigidity of the\r\nintegument caused by the deposition of dense chitin upon it is\r\nintimately connected with the physiological activity and form of all the\r\ninternal organs, and is undoubtedly correlated with the total\r\ndisappearance of the circular muscular layer of the body-wall present in\r\nChaetopods. (2) In all existing Arthropoda the region in front of the\r\nmouth is no longer formed by the primitive prostomium or head-lobe, but\r\none or more segments, originally post-oral, with their appendages have\r\npassed in front of the mouth (prosthomeres). At the same time the\r\nprostomium and its appendages cease to be recognizable as distinct\r\nelements of the head. The brain no longer consists solely of the\r\nnerve-ganglion-mass proper to the prostomial lobe, as in Chaetopoda, but\r\nis a composite (syncerebrum) produced by the fusion of this and the\r\nnerve-ganglion-masses proper to the prosthomeres or segments which pass\r\nforwards, whilst their parapodia (= appendages) become converted into\r\neye-stalks, and antennae, or more rarely grasping organs. (3) As in\r\nChaetopoda, coelomic funnels (coelomoducts) _may_ occur right and left\r\nas pairs in each ring-like segment or somite of the body, and some of\r\nthese are in all cases retained as gonoducts and often as renal\r\nexcretory organs (green glands, coxal glands of Arachnida, _not_ crural\r\nglands, which are epidermal in origin); but true nephridia, genetically\r\nidentical with the nephridia of earthworms, do not occur (on the subject\r\nof coelom, coelomoducts and nephridia, see the introductory chapter of\r\npart ii. of Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Lankester, _Q.

The justification of the\r\narrangement adopted will form the substance of the rest of the present\r\narticle. The orders included in the various classes are not discussed\r\nhere, but are treated of under the following titles:--PERIPATUS\r\n(Onychophora), CENTIPEDE and MILLIPEDE (Myriapoda), HEXAPODA (Insecta),\r\nARACHNIDA and CRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\n  SUB-PHYLUM ARTHROPODA (of the Phylum Appendiculata).\r\n\r\n  Grade A.

A similar constitution of the body is more\r\n  clearly seen in the Chaetopod worms. In the Vertebrata also a\r\n  repetition of units of structure (myotomes, vertebrae, &c.)--which is\r\n  essentially of the same nature as the repetition in Arthropods and\r\n  Chaetopods, but in many respects subject to peculiar developments--is\r\n  observed. The name \"metamerism\" has been given to this structural\r\n  phenomenon because the \"meres,\" or repeated units, follow one another\r\n  in line. Each such \"mere\" is often called a \"metamere.\" A satisfactory\r\n  consideration of the structure of the Arthropods demands a knowledge\r\n  of what may be called the laws of metamerism, and reference should be\r\n  made to the article under that head.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Goodrich, _Q. J. Micr. Sci._ vol. xi p. 247.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.--Diagram of the head and adjacent region of an Ohgochaet\r\n  Chaetopod.\r\n\r\n    Pr, The prostomium.\r\n    m, The mouth.\r\n    A, The prostomial ganglion-mass or archi-cerebrum.\r\n    I, II, III, coelom of the first, second and third somites.]\r\n\r\n  _The Theory of the Arthropod Head._--The Arthropod head is a tagma or\r\n  group of somites which differ in number and in their relative position\r\n  in regard to the mouth, in different classes. In a simple Chaetopod\r\n  (fig. 2) the head consists of the first somite only; that somite is\r\n  perforated by the mouth, and is provided with a prostomium or\r\n  prae-oral lobe. The prostomium is essentially a part or outgrowth of\r\n  the first somite, and cannot be regarded as itself a somite. It gives\r\n  rise to a nerve-ganglion mass, the prostomial ganglion. In the marine\r\n  Chaetopods (the Polychaeta) (fig. 3), we find the same essential\r\n  structure, but the prostomium may give rise to two or more tactile\r\n  tentacles, and to the vesicular eyes. The somites have well-marked\r\n  parapodia, and the second and third, as well as the first, may give\r\n  rise to tentacles which are directed forward, and thus contribute to\r\n  form \"the head.\" But the mouth remains as an inpushing of the wall of\r\n  the first somite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram of the head and adjacent region of a\r\n  Polychaet Chaetopod Letters as in fig. 1, with the addition of T,\r\n  prostomial tentacle; _Pa_, parapodium. (From Goodrich.)]\r\n\r\n  The Arthropoda are all distinguished from the Chaetopoda by the fact\r\n  that the head consists of one or more somites which lie _in front of\r\n  the mouth_ (now called prosthomeres), as well as of one or more\r\n  somites behind it (opisthomeres). The first of the post-oral somites\r\n  invariably has its parapodia modified so as to form a pair of\r\n  hemignaths (mandibles). About 1870 the question arose for discussion\r\n  whether the somites in front of the mouth are to be considered as\r\n  derived from the prostomium of a Chaetopod-like ancestor.\r\n  Milne-Edwards and Huxley had satisfied themselves with discussing and\r\n  establishing, according to the data at their command, the number of\r\n  somites in the Arthropod head, but had not considered the question of\r\n  the _nature_ of the prae-oral somites. Lankester (2) was the first to\r\n  suggest that (as is actually the fact in the Nauplius larva of the\r\n  Crustacea) the prae-oral somites or prosthomeres and their appendages\r\n  were ancestrally post-oral, but have become prae-oral \"by adaptational\r\n  shifting of the oral aperture.\" This has proved to be a sound\r\n  hypothesis and is now accepted as the basis upon which the Arthropod\r\n  head must be interpreted (see Korschelt and Heider (3)). Further, the\r\n  morphologists of the 'fifties appear, with few exceptions, to have\r\n  accepted a preliminary scheme with regard to the Arthropod head and\r\n  Arthropod segmentation generally, which was misleading and caused them\r\n  to adopt forced conclusions and interpretations. It was conceived by\r\n  Huxley, among others, that the same number of cephalic somites would\r\n  be found to be characteristic of all the diverse classes of\r\n  Arthropoda, and that the somites, not only of the head but of the\r\n  various regions of the body, could be closely compared in their\r\n  numerical sequence in classes so distinct as the Hexapods, Crustaceans\r\n  and Arachnids.\r\n\r\n  The view which it now appears necessary to take is, on the contrary,\r\n  this--viz that all the Arthropoda are to be traced to a common\r\n  ancestor resembling a Chaetopod worm, but differing from it in having\r\n  lost its chaetae and in having a prosthomere in front of the mouth\r\n  (instead of prostomium only) and a pair of hemignaths (mandibles) on\r\n  the parapodia of the buccal somite. From this ancestor Arthropods with\r\n  heads of varying degrees of complexity have been developed\r\n  characteristic of the different classes, whilst the parapodia and\r\n  somites of the body have become variously modified and grouped in\r\n  these different classes. The resemblances which the members of one\r\n  class often present to the members of another class in regard to the\r\n  form of the limb-branches (rami) of the parapodia and the formation of\r\n  tagmata (regions) are not hastily to be ascribed to common\r\n  inheritance, but we must consider whether they are not due to\r\n  homoplasy--that is, to the moulding of natural selection acting in the\r\n  different classes upon fairly similar elements under like exigencies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Diagram of the head and adjacent region of\r\n  _Peripatus_. Monoprosthomerous.\r\n\r\n    m, Mouth.\r\n    I, Coelom of the first somite which carries the antennae and is in\r\n      front of the mouth.\r\n    II, Coelom of the second somite which carries the mandibles (hence\r\n      deuterognathous).\r\n    III and IV, Coelom of the third and fourth somites.\r\n    FP, Rudimentary frontal processes perhaps representing the\r\n      prostomial tentacles of Polychaeta.\r\n    Ant, Antenna or tactile tentacle.\r\n    Md, Mandible.\r\n    Op, Oral-papilla.\r\n    P, Protocerebrum or foremost cerebral mass belonging to the first\r\n      somite.\r\n    D, Deuterocerebrum, consisting of ganglion cells belonging to the\r\n      second or mandibular somite. (After Goodrich.)]\r\n\r\n  The structure of the head in Arthropods presents _three_ profoundly\r\n  separated grades of structure dependent upon the number of\r\n  prosthomeres which have been assimilated by the prae-oral region. The\r\n  classes presenting these distinct plans of head-structure cannot be\r\n  closely associated in any scheme of classification professing to be\r\n  natural. Penpatus, the type-genus of the class Onychophora, stands at\r\n  the base of the series with only a single prosthomere (fig. 4). In\r\n  Peripatus the prostomium of the Chaetopod-like ancestor is atrophied,\r\n  but it is possible that two processes on the front of the head (FP)\r\n  represent in the embryo the dwindled prostomial tentacles. The single\r\n  prosthomere carries the retractile tentacles as its \"parapodia.\" The\r\n  second somite is the buccal somite (II, fig. 4); its parapodia have\r\n  horny jaws on their ends, like the claws on the following legs (fig.\r\n  9), and act as hemignaths (mandibles). The study of sections of the\r\n  embryo establishes these facts beyond doubt. It also shows us that the\r\n  neuromeres, no less than the embryonic coelomic cavities, point to the\r\n  existence of one, and only one, prosthomerp in Peripatus, of which the\r\n  \"protocerebrum,\" P, is the neuromere, whilst the deuterocerebrum, D,\r\n  is the neuromere of the second or buccal somite. A brief indication of\r\n  these facts is given by saying that the Onychophora are\r\n  \"deuterognathous\"--that is to say, that the buccal somite carrying the\r\n  mandibular hemignaths is the second of the whole series.\r\n\r\n  What has become of the nerve-ganglion of the prostomial lobe of the\r\n  Chaetopod in Peripatus is not clearly ascertained, nor is its fate\r\n  indicated by the study of the embryonic head of other Arthropods so\r\n  far. Probably it is fused with the protocerebrum, and may also be\r\n  concerned in the history of the very peculiar paired eyes of\r\n  Peripatus, which are like those of Chaetopods in structure--viz\r\n  vesicles with an intravesicular lens, whereas the eyes of all other\r\n  Arthropods have essentially another structure, being \"cups\" of the\r\n  epidermis, in which a knob-like or rod-like thickening of the cuticle\r\n  is fitted as refractive medium.\r\n\r\n  In Diplopoda (_Julus_, &c.) the results of embryological study point\r\n  to a composition of the front part of the head exactly similar to that\r\n  which we find in Onychophora. They are deuterognathous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Diagram of the head and adjacent region of an\r\n  Arachnid.

Here embryology\r\n  shows that there are two prosthomeres (fig. 5), and that the\r\n  gnathobases of the chelae which act as the first pair of hemignaths\r\n  are carried by the third somite. The Arachnida are therefore\r\n  tritognathous. The two prosthomeres are indicated by their coelomic\r\n  cavities in the embryo (I and II, fig. 5), and by two neuromeres, the\r\n  protocerebrum and the deuterocerebrum. The appendages of the first\r\n  prosthomere are not present as tentacles, as in Peripatus and\r\n  Diplopods, but are possibly represented by the eyes or possibly\r\n  altogether aborted. The appendages of the second prosthomere are the\r\n  well-known chelicerae of the Arachnids, rarely, if ever, antenniform,\r\n  but modified as \"retroverts\" or clasp-knife tangs in spiders.\r\n\r\n  The Crustacea (fig. 6) and the Hexapoda (fig. 7) agree in having three\r\n  somites in front of the mouth, and it is probable, though not\r\n  ascertained, that the Chilopoda (Scolopendra, &c.) are in the same\r\n  case. The three prosthomeres or prae-oral somites of Crustacea due to\r\n  the sinking back of the mouth one somite farther than in Arachnida are\r\n  not clearly indicated by coelomic cavities in the embryo, but their\r\n  existence is clearly established by the development and position of\r\n  the appendages and by the neuromeres.\r\n\r\n  The eyes in some Crustacea are mounted on articulated stalks, and from\r\n  the fact that they can after injury be replaced by antenna-like\r\n  appendages it is inferred that they represent the parapodia of the\r\n  most anterior prosthomere. The second prosthomere carries the first\r\n  pair of antennae and the third the second pair of antennae. Sometimes\r\n  the pair of appendages has not a merely tactile jointed ramus, but is\r\n  converted into a claw or clasper. Three neuromeres--a proto-,\r\n  deutero-, and trito-cerebrum--corresponding to those three\r\n  prosthomeres are sharply marked in the embryo. The fourth somite is\r\n  that in which the mouth now opens, and which accordingly has its\r\n  appendages converted into hemignathous mandibles. The Crustacea are\r\n  tetartognathous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Diagram of the head of a Crustacean.\r\n  Tri-prosthomerous.\r\n\r\n    FP, Frontal processes (observed in Cirrhiped nauplius-larvae)\r\n      probably representing the prostomial tentacles of Chaetopods.\r\n    e, Eye.\r\n    Ant^1, First pair of antennae.\r\n    Ant^2, Second pair of antennae.\r\n    md, Mandible.\r\n    mx^1, mx^2, First and second pairs of maxillae.\r\n    m, Mouth.\r\n    I, II, and III, The three prosthomeres.\r\n    IV, V, VI, The three somites following the mouth.\r\n    P, Protocerebrum.\r\n    D, Deuterocerebrum.\r\n    T, Tritocerebrum.\r\n\r\n  (After Goodrich.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Diagram of the head of a Hexapod insect.\r\n\r\n    e, Eye.\r\n    ant, Antenna.\r\n    md, Mandible.\r\n    mx^1, First maxilla.\r\n    mx^2, Second maxilla.\r\n    m, Mouth.\r\n    I, Region of the first or eye-bearing prosthomere.\r\n    II, Coelom of the second antenna-bearing prosthomere.\r\n    III, Coelom of the third prosthomere devoid of appendages.\r\n    IV, V, and VI, Coelom of the fourth, fifth and sixth somites.\r\n    P, Protocerebrum belonging to the first prosthomere.\r\n    D, Deuterocerebrum belonging to the second prosthomere.\r\n    T, Tritocerebrum belonging to the third prosthomere.\r\n\r\n  (After Goodrich.)]\r\n\r\n  The history of the development of the head has been carefully worked\r\n  out in the Hexapod insects. As in Crustacea and Arachnida, a first\r\n  prosthomere is indicated by the paired eyes and the protocerebrum; the\r\n  second prosthomere has a well-marked coelomic cavity, carries the\r\n  antennae, and has the deuterocerebrum for its neuromere. The third\r\n  prosthomere is represented by a well-marked pair of coelomic cavities\r\n  and the tritocerebrum (III, fig. 7), but has no appendages. They\r\n  appear to have aborted. The existence of this third prosthomere\r\n  corresponding to the third prosthomere of the Crustacea is a strong\r\n  argument for the derivation of the Hexapoda, and with them the\r\n  Chilopoda, from some offshoot of the Crustacean stem or class. The\r\n  buccal somite, with its mandibles, is in Hexapoda, as in Crustacea,\r\n  the fourth: they are tetartognathous.\r\n\r\n  The adhesion of a greater or less number of somites to the buccal\r\n  somite posteriorly (opisthomeres) is a matter of importance, but of\r\n  minor importance, in the theory and history of the Arthropod head. In\r\n  Peripatus no such adhesion or fusion occurs. In Diplopoda two\r\n  opisthomeres--that is to say, one in addition to the buccal\r\n  somite--are united by a fusion of their terga with the terga of the\r\n  prosthomeres. Their appendages are respectively the mandibles and the\r\n  gnathochilarium.\r\n\r\n  In Arachnida the highest forms exhibit a fusion of the tergites of\r\n  five post-oral somites to form one continuous carapace united with the\r\n  terga of the two prosthomeres. The five pairs of appendages of the\r\n  post-oral somites of the head or prosoma thus constituted all\r\n  primitively carry gnathobasic projections on their coxal joints, which\r\n  act as hemignaths: in the more specialized forms the mandibular\r\n  gnathobases cease to develop.\r\n\r\n  In Crustacea the fourth or mandibular somite never has less than the\r\n  two following somites associated with it by the adaptation of their\r\n  appendages as jaws, and the ankylosis of their terga with that of the\r\n  prosthomeres. But in higher Crustacea the cephalic \"tagma\" is\r\n  extended, and more somites are added to the fusion, and their\r\n  appendages adapted as jaws of a kind.\r\n\r\n  The Hexapoda are not known to us in their earlier or more primitive\r\n  manifestations; we only know them as possessed of a definite number of\r\n  somites arranged in definite numbers in three great tagmata. The head\r\n  shows two jaw-bearing somites besides the mandibular somite (V, VI, in\r\n  fig. 7)--thus six in all (as in some Crustacea), including\r\n  prosthomeres, all ankylosed by their terga to form a cephalic shield.\r\n  There is, however, good embryological evidence in some Hexapods of the\r\n  existence of a seventh somite, the supra-lingual, occurring between\r\n  the somite of the mandibles and the somite of the first maxillae (4).\r\n  This segment is indicated embryologically by its paired coelomic\r\n  cavities. It is practically an excalated somite, having no existence\r\n  in the adult. It is probably not a mere coincidence that the Hexapod,\r\n  with its two rudimentary somites devoid of appendages, is thus found\r\n  to possess twenty-one somites, including that which carries the anus,\r\n  and that this is also the number present in the Malacostracous\r\n  Crustacea.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Diagram of the somite-appendage or parapodium\r\n  of a Polychaet Chaetopod.

(Original).]\r\n\r\n  _The Segmented Lateral Appendages or Limbs of Arthropoda._--It has\r\n  taken some time to obtain any general acceptance of the view that the\r\n  parapodia of the Chaetopoda and the limbs of Arthropoda are\r\n  genetically identical structures; yet if we compare the parapodium of\r\n  Tomopteris or of Phyllodoce with one of the foliaceous limbs of\r\n  Branchipus or Apus, the correspondences of the two are striking. An\r\n  erroneous view of the fundamental morphology of the Crustacean limb,\r\n  and consequently of that of other Arthropoda, came into favour owing\r\n  to the acceptance of the highly modified limbs of Astacus as typical.\r\n  Protopodite, endopodite, exopodite, and epipodite were considered to\r\n  be the morphological units of the crustacean limb. Lankester (5) has\r\n  shown (and his views have been accepted by Professors Korschelt and\r\n  Heider in their treatise on _Embryology_) that the limb of the lowest\r\n  Crustacea, such as Apus, consists of a corm or axis which may be\r\n  jointed, and gives rise to outgrowths, either leaf-like or filiform,\r\n  on its inner and outer margins (endites and exites). Such a corm (see\r\n  figs. 10 and 11), with its outgrowths, may be compared to the simple\r\n  parapodia of Chaetopoda with cirrhi and branchial lobe (fig. 8). It is\r\n  by the specialization of two \"endites\" that the endopodite and\r\n  exopodite of higher Crustacea are formed, whilst a flabelliform exite\r\n  is the homogen or genetic equivalent of the epipodite (see Lankester,\r\n  \"Observations and Reflections on Apus Cancriformis,\" _Q. J. Micr.\r\n  Sci._). The reduction of the outgrowth-bearing \"corm\" of the\r\n  parapodium of either a Chaetopod or an Arthropod to a simple\r\n  cylindrical stump, devoid of outgrowths, is brought about when\r\n  mechanical conditions favour such a shape. We see it in certain\r\n  Chaetopods (e.g. Hesione) and in the Arthropod Peripatus (fig. 9). The\r\n  conversion of the Arthropod's limb into a jaw, as a rule, is effected\r\n  by the development of an endite near its base into a hard, chitinized,\r\n  and often toothed gnathobase (see figs. 10 and 11, _en^1_). It is not\r\n  true that all the biting processes of the Arthropod limb are thus\r\n  produced--for instance, the jaws of Peripatus are formed by the axis\r\n  or corm itself, whilst the poison-jaws of Chilopods, as also their\r\n  maxillae, appear to be formed rather by the apex or terminal region of\r\n  the ramus of the limb; but the opposing jaws (= hemignaths) of\r\n  Crustacea, Arachnida and Hexapoda are gnathobases, and not the axis or\r\n  corm. The endopodite (corresponding to the fifth endite of the limb of\r\n  Apus, see fig. 10) becomes in Crustacea the \"walking leg\" of the\r\n  mid-region of the body; it becomes the palp or jointed process of\r\n  anterior segments. A second ramus, the \"exopodite,\" often is also\r\n  retained in the form of a palp or feeler. In Apus, as the figure\r\n  shows, there are four of these \"antenna-like\" palps or filaments on\r\n  the first thoracic limb. A common modification of the chief ramus of\r\n  the Arthropod parapodium is the chela or nipper formed by the\r\n  elongation of the penultimate joint of the ramus, so that the last\r\n  joint works on it--as, for instance, in the lobster's claw. Such\r\n  chelate rami or limb-branches are independently developed in Crustacea\r\n  and in Arachnida, and are carried by somites of the body which do not\r\n  correspond in position in the two groups. The range of modification of\r\n  which the rami or limb-branches of the limbs of Arthropoda are capable\r\n  is very large, and in allied orders or even families or genera we\r\n  often find what is certainly the palp of the same appendage (as\r\n  determined by numerical position of the segments)--in one case\r\n  antenniform, in another chelate, in another pediform, and in another\r\n  reduced to a mere stump or absent altogether. Very probably the power\r\n  which the appendage of a given segment has of assuming the perfected\r\n  form and proportions previously attained by the appendage of another\r\n  segment must be classed as an instance of \"homoeosis,\" not only where\r\n  such a change is obviously due to abnormal development or injury, but\r\n  also where it constitutes a difference permanently established between\r\n  allied orders or smaller groups, or between the two sexes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Three somite-appendages or parapodia of\r\n  _Peripatus._\r\n\r\n    A, A walking leg; p^1 to p^4, the characteristic \"pads\"; f, the\r\n      foot; cl^1, cl^2, the two claws.\r\n    B, An oral papilla, one of the second pair of post-oral appendages.\r\n    C, One of the first post-oral pair of appendages or mandibles; cl^1,\r\n      cl^2, the greatly enlarged claws. (Compare A.)\r\n\r\n  The appendages are represented with the neural or ventral surface\r\n  uppermost.]\r\n\r\n  The most extreme disguise assumed by the Arthropod parapodium or\r\n  appendage is that of becoming a mere stalk supporting an eye--a fact\r\n  which did not obtain general credence until the experiments of Herbst\r\n  in 1895, who found, on cutting off the eye-stalk of Palaemon, that a\r\n  jointed antenna-like appendage was regenerated in its place. Since the\r\n  eye-stalks of Podophthalmate Crustacea represent appendages, we are\r\n  forced to the conclusion that the sessile eyes of other Crustacea, and\r\n  of other Arthropoda generally, indicate the position of appendages\r\n  which have atrophied.[2]\r\n\r\n  From what has been said, it is apparent that we cannot, in attempting\r\n  to discover the affinities and divergences of the various forms of\r\n  Arthropoda, attach a very high phylogenetic value to the coincidence\r\n  or divergence in form of the appendages belonging to the somites\r\n  compared with one another.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Lankester, _Q.

This is\r\n  the usual uni-ramose limb found in the various classes of Arthropoda.\r\n  It varies as to the presence or absence of the jaw-process and as to\r\n  the stoutness of the segments of the ramus, their number (frequently\r\n  six, plus the basal corm), and the modification of the free end. This\r\n  may be filiform or brush-like or lamellate when it is an antenna or\r\n  palp; a simple spike (walking leg of Crustacea, of other aquatic\r\n  forms, and of Chilopods and Diplopods); the terminal joint flattened\r\n  (swimming leg of Crustacea and Gigantostraca); the terminal joint\r\n  provided with two or with three recurved claws (walking leg of many\r\n  terrestrial forms--e.g. Hexapoda and Arachnida); the penultimate joint\r\n  with a process equal in length to the last joint, so as to form a\r\n  nipping organ (chelae of Crustaceans and Arachnids); the last joint\r\n  reflected and movable on the penultimate, as the blade of a\r\n  clasp-knife on its handle (the retrovert, toothed so as to act as a\r\n  biting jaw in the Hexapod _Mantis_, the Crustacean _Squilla_ and\r\n  others); with the last joint produced into a needle-like stabbing\r\n  process in spiders.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Lankester, _Q.

This is the typical \"bi-ramose limb\"\r\n  often found in Crustacea. The rami may be flattened for swimming, when\r\n  it is \"a bi-ramose swimmeret,\" or both or only one may be filiform and\r\n  finely annulate; this is the form often presented by the antennae of\r\n  Crustacea, and rarely by prae-oral appendages in other Arthropods.\r\n\r\n  (7) The endopoditic ramus is greatly enlarged and flattened, without\r\n  or with only one jointing, the corm (basal segment) is evanescent;\r\n  often the plate-like endopodites of a pair of such appendages unite in\r\n  the middle line with one another or by the intermediary of a sternal\r\n  up-growth and form a single broad plate. These are the plate-like\r\n  swimmerets and opercula of Gigantostraca and Limulus among Arachnids\r\n  and of Isopod Crustaceans. They may have rudimentary exopodites, and\r\n  may or may not have branchial filaments or lamellae developed on their\r\n  posterior faces. The simplest form to which they may be reduced is\r\n  seen in the genital operculum of the scorpion.\r\n\r\n  (8) The gnathobase becomes greatly enlarged and not separated by a\r\n  joint from the corm; it acts as a hemignath or half jaw working\r\n  against its fellow of the opposite side. The endopodite may be\r\n  retained as a small segmented palp at the side of the gnathobase or\r\n  disappear (mandible of Crustacea, Chilopoda and Hexapoda).\r\n\r\n  (9) The corm becomes the seat of a development of a special visual\r\n  organ, the Arthropod eye (as opposed to the Chaetopod eye). Its\r\n  jointing (segmentation) may be retained, but its rami disappear\r\n  (Podophthalmous Crustacea). Usually it becomes atrophied, leaving the\r\n  eye as a sessile organ upon the prae-oral region of the body (the\r\n  eye-stalk and sessile lateral eyes of Arthropoda generally, exclusive\r\n  of Peripatus).\r\n\r\n  (10) The forms assumed by special modification of the elements of the\r\n  parapodium in the maxillae, labium, &c., of Hexapods, Chilopods,\r\n  Diplopods, and of various Crustacea, deserve special enumeration, but\r\n  cannot be dealt with without ample space and illustration.\r\n\r\n  It may be pointed out that the most radical difference presented in\r\n  this list is that between appendages consisting of the corm alone\r\n  without rami (Onychophora) and those with more or less developed rami\r\n  (the rest of the Arthropoda). In the latter class we should\r\n  distinguish three phases: (a) those with numerous and comparatively\r\n  undeveloped rami; (b) those with three, or two highly developed rami,\r\n  or with only one--the corm being reduced to the dimensions of a mere\r\n  basal segment; (c) those reduced to a secondary simplicity\r\n  (degeneration) by overwhelming development of one segment (e.g. the\r\n  isolated gnathobase often seen as \"mandible\" and the genital\r\n  operculum).\r\n\r\n  There is no reason to suppose that any of the forms of limb observed\r\n  in Arthropoda may not have been independently developed in two or more\r\n  separate diverging lines of descent.\r\n\r\n  _Branchiae._--In connexion with the discussion of the limbs of\r\n  Arthropods, a few words should be devoted to the gill-processes. It\r\n  seems probable that there are branchial plumes or filaments in some\r\n  Arthropoda (some Crustacea) which can be identified with the distinct\r\n  branchial organs of Chaetopoda, which lie dorsal of the parapodia and\r\n  are not part of the parapodium. On the other hand, we cannot refuse to\r\n  admit that any of the processes of an Arthropod parapodium may become\r\n  modified as branchial organs, and that, as a rule, branchial\r\n  out-growths are easily developed, _de novo_, in all the higher groups\r\n  of animals. Therefore, it seems to be, with our present knowledge, a\r\n  hopeless task to analyse the branchial organs of Arthropoda and to\r\n  identify them genetically in groups.\r\n\r\n  A brief notice must suffice of the structure and history of the\r\n  _Eyes_, the _Tracheae_ and the so-called _Malpighian tubes_ of\r\n  Arthropoda, though special importance attaches to each in regard to\r\n  the determination of the affinities of the various animals included in\r\n  this great sub-phylum.\r\n\r\n  _The Eyes._--The Arthropod eye appears to be an organ of special\r\n  character developed in the common ancestor of the Euarthropoda, and\r\n  distinct from the Chaetopod eye, which is found only in the\r\n  Onychophora where the true Arthropod eye is absent. The essential\r\n  difference between these two kinds of eye appears to be that the\r\n  Chaetopod eye (in its higher developments) is a vesicle enclosing the\r\n  lens, whereas the Arthropod eye is a pit or series of pits into which\r\n  the heavy chitinous cuticle dips and enlarges knobwise as a lens. Two\r\n  distinct forms of the Arthropod eye are observed--the monomeniscous\r\n  (simple) and the polymeniscous (compound). The nerve-end-cells, which\r\n  lie below the lens, are part of the general epidermis. They show in\r\n  the monomeniscous eye (see article ARACHNIDA, fig. 26) a tendency to\r\n  group themselves into \"retinulae,\" consisting of five to twelve cells\r\n  united by vertical deposits of chitin (rhabdoms). In the case of the\r\n  polymeniscous eye (fig. 23, article ARACHNIDA) a single retinula or\r\n  group of nerve-end-cells is grouped beneath each associated lens. A\r\n  further complication occurs in each of these two classes of eye. The\r\n  monomeniscous eye is rarely provided with a single layer of cells\r\n  beneath its lens; when it is so, it is called monostichous (simple\r\n  lateral eye of Scorpion, fig. 22, article ARACHNIDA). More usually, by\r\n  an infolding of the layer of cells in development, we get three layers\r\n  under the lens; the front layer is the corneagen layer, and is\r\n  separated by a membrane from the other two which, more or less, fuse\r\n  and contain the nerve-end-cells (retinal layer). These eyes are called\r\n  diplostichous, and occur in Arachnida and Hexapoda (fig. 24, article\r\n  ARACHNIDA).\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the polymeniscous eye undergoes special elaboration\r\n  on its lines. The retinulae become elongated as deep and very narrow\r\n  pits (fig. 12 and explanation), and develop additional cells near the\r\n  mouth of the narrow pit. Those nearest to the lens are the corneagen\r\n  cells of this more elaborated eye, and those between the original\r\n  retinula cells and the corneagen cells become firm and transparent.\r\n  They are the crystalline cells or vitrella (see Watase, 7). Each such\r\n  complex of cells underlying the lenticle of a compound eye is called\r\n  an \"ommatidium\"; the entire mass of cells underlying a monomeniscous\r\n  eye is an \"ommataeum.\" The ommataeum, as already stated, tends to\r\n  segregate into retinulae which correspond potentially each to an\r\n  ommatidium of the compound eye. The ommatidium is from the first\r\n  segregate and consists of few cells. The compound eye of the king-crab\r\n  (Limulus) is the only recognized instance of ommatidia in their\r\n  simplest state. Each can be readily compared with the single-layered\r\n  lateral eye of the scorpion. In Crustacea and Hexapoda of all grades\r\n  we find compound eyes with the more complicated ommatidia described\r\n  above. We do not find them in any Arachnida.\r\n\r\n  It is difficult in the absence of more detailed knowledge as to the\r\n  eyes of Chilopoda and Diplopoda to give full value to these facts in\r\n  tracing the affinities of the various classes of Arthropods. But they\r\n  seem to point to a community of origin of Hexapods and Crustacea in\r\n  regard to the complicated ommatidia of the compound eye, and to a\r\n  certain isolation of the Arachnida, which are, however, traceable, so\r\n  far as the eyes are concerned, to a distant common origin with\r\n  Crustacea and Hexapoda through the very simple compound eyes\r\n  (monostichous, polymeniscous) of Limulus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Diagram to show the derivation of the unit or\r\n  \"ommatidium\" of the compound eye of Crustacea and Hexapoda, C, from a\r\n  simple monomeniscous monostichous eye resembling the lateral eye of a\r\n  scorpion, A, or the unit of the compound lateral eye of Limulus (see\r\n  article ARACHNIDA, figs. 22 and 23). B represents an intermediate\r\n  hypothetical form in which the cells beneath the lens are beginning to\r\n  be superimposed as corneagen, vitrella and retinula, instead of\r\n  standing side by side in horizontal series. The black represents the\r\n  cuticular product of the epidermal cells of the ocular area, taking\r\n  the form either of lens, _cl_, of crystalline body, _cry_, or of\r\n  rhabdom, _rhab_; _hy_, hypodermis or epidermal cells; _corn^1_,\r\n  laterally-placed cells in the simpler stage, A, which like the\r\n  nerve-end cells, _vit^1_ and _ret^1_, are corneagens or\r\n  lens-producing; _corn_, specialized corneagen or lens-producing cells;\r\n  _vit^1_, potential vitrella cells with _cry^1_, potential crystalline\r\n  body now indistinguishable from retinula cells and rhabdomeres; _vit_,\r\n  vitrella cell with _cry_, its contained cuticular product, the\r\n  crystalline cone or body; _ret^1_, _rhab^1_, retinula cells and\r\n  rhabdom of scorpion undifferentiated from adjacent cells, _vit^1;\r\n  ret_, retinula cell; _rhab_, rhabdom; _nf_, optic nerve-fibres.\r\n  (Modified from Watase.)]\r\n\r\n  _The Tracheae._--In regard to tracheae the very natural tendency of\r\n  zoologists has been until lately to consider them as having once\r\n  developed and once only, and therefore to hold that a group\r\n  \"Tracheata\" should be recognized, including all tracheate Arthropods.\r\n  We are driven by the conclusions arrived at as to the derivation of\r\n  the Arachnida from branchiate ancestors, independently of the other\r\n  tracheate Arthropods, to formulate the conclusion that tracheae have\r\n  been independently developed in the Arachnidan class. We are also, by\r\n  the isolation of Peripatus and the impossibility of tracing to it all\r\n  other tracheate Arthropoda, or of regarding it as a degenerate offset\r\n  from some one of the tracheate classes, forced to the conclusion that\r\n  the tracheae of the Onychophora have been independently acquired.\r\n  Having accepted these two conclusions, we formulate the generalization\r\n  that tracheae can be independently acquired by various branches of\r\n  Arthropod descent in adaptation to a terrestrial as opposed to an\r\n  aquatic mode of life. A great point of interest therefore exists in\r\n  the knowledge of the structure and embryology of tracheae in the\r\n  different groups. It must be confessed that we have not such full\r\n  knowledge on this head as could be wished for. Tracheae are\r\n  essentially tubes like blood-vessels--apparently formed from the same\r\n  tissue elements as blood-vessels--which contain air in place of blood,\r\n  and usually communicate by definite orifices, the tracheal stigmata,\r\n  with the atmosphere. They are lined internally by a cuticular deposit\r\n  of chitin. In Peripatus and the Diplopods they consist of bunches of\r\n  fine tubes which do not branch but diverge from one another; the\r\n  chitinous lining is smooth. In the Hexapods and Chilopods, and the\r\n  Arachnids (usually), they form tree-like branching structures, and\r\n  their finest branches are finer than any blood-capillary, actually in\r\n  some cases penetrating a single cell and supplying it with gaseous\r\n  oxygen. In these forms the chitinous lining of the tubes is thickened\r\n  by a close-set spiral ridge similar to the spiral thickening of the\r\n  cellulose wall of the spiral vessels of plants. It is a noteworthy\r\n  fact that other tubes in these same terrestrial Arthropoda--namely,\r\n  the ducts of glands--are similarly strengthened by a chitinous\r\n  cuticle, and that a spiral or annular thickening of the cuticle is\r\n  developed in them also. Chitin is _not_ exclusively an ectodermal\r\n  product, but occurs also in cartilaginous skeletal plates of\r\n  mesoblastic origin (connective tissue). The immediate cavities or pits\r\n  into which the tracheal stigmata open appear to be in many cases\r\n  ectodermic in sinkings, but there seems to be no reason (based on\r\n  embryological observation) for regarding the tracheae as an ingrowth\r\n  of the ectoderm. They appear, in fact, to be an air-holding\r\n  modification of the vasifactive connective tissue. Tracheae are\r\n  abundant just in proportion as blood-vessels become suppressed. They\r\n  are reciprocally exclusive. It seems not improbable that they are two\r\n  modifications of the same tissue-elements. In Peripatus the stigmatic\r\n  pits at which the tracheae communicate with the atmosphere are\r\n  scattered and not definite in their position. In other cases the\r\n  stigmata are definitely paired and placed in a few segments or in\r\n  several. It seems that we have to suppose that the vasifactive tissue\r\n  of Arthropoda can readily take the form of air-holding instead of\r\n  blood-holding tubes, and that this somewhat startling change in its\r\n  character has taken place independently in several instances--viz. in\r\n  the Onychophora, in more than one group of Arachnida, in Diplopoda,\r\n  and again in the Hexapoda and Chilopoda.\r\n\r\n  _The Malpighian Tubes._--This name is applied to the numerous fine\r\n  caecal tubes of noticeable length developed from the proctodaeal\r\n  invert of ectodermal origin in Hexapods. These tubes are shown to\r\n  excrete nitrogenous waste products similar to uric acid. Tubes of\r\n  renal excretory function in a like position occur in most terrestrial\r\n  Arthropoda--viz. in Chilopoda, Diplopoda and Arachnida. They are also\r\n  found in some of the semi-terrestrial and purely aquatic Amphipod\r\n  Crustaceans. But the conclusion that all such tubes are identical in\r\n  essential character seems to be without foundation. The Malpighian\r\n  tubes of Hexapods are outgrowths of the proctodaeum, but those of\r\n  Scorpion and the Amphipod Crustacea are part of the metenteron or\r\n  endodermal gut, though originating near its junction with the\r\n  proctodaeum. Hence the presence or absence of such tubes cannot be\r\n  used as an argument as to affinity without some discrimination. The\r\n  Scorpion's so-called Malpighian tubes are _not_ the same organs as\r\n  those so named in the other Tracheata. Such renal caecal tubes seem to\r\n  be readily evolved from either metenteron or proctodaeum when the\r\n  conditions of the out-wash of nitrogenous waste-products are changed\r\n  by the transference from aquatic to terrestrial life. The absence of\r\n  such renal caeca in Limulus and their presence in the terrestrial\r\n  Arachnida is precisely on a parallel with their absence in aquatic\r\n  Crustacea and their presence in the feebly branchiate Amphipoda.\r\n\r\n  _Group Characters._--We shall now pass the groups of the Arthropoda in\r\n  review, attempting to characterize them in such a way as will indicate\r\n  their probable affinities and genetic history.\r\n\r\n  SUB-PHYLUM ARTHROPODA.--The characters of the sub-phylum and those of\r\n  the associated sub-phyla Chaetopoda and Rotifera have been given\r\n  above, as well as the general characters of the phylum Appendiculata\r\n  which comprises these great sub-phyla.\r\n\r\n    Grade A.--Hyparthropoda.\r\n\r\n    Hypothetical forms.\r\n\r\n    Grade B.--Protarthropoda.\r\n\r\n  (a) The integument is covered by a delicate soft cuticle (not firm or\r\n  plated) which allows the body and its appendages great range of\r\n  extension and contraction.\r\n\r\n  (b) The paired claws on the ends of the parapodia and the fang-like\r\n  modifications of these on the first post-oral appendages (mandibles)\r\n  are the only hard chitinous portions of the integument.\r\n\r\n  (c) The head is deuterognathous--that is to say, there is only one\r\n  prosthomere, and accordingly the first and only pair of hemignaths is\r\n  developed by adaptation of the appendages of the second somite.\r\n\r\n  (d) The appendages of the third somite (second post-oral) are clawless\r\n  oral papillae.\r\n\r\n  (e) The rest of the somites carry equi-formal simple appendages,\r\n  consisting of a corm or axis tipped with two chitinous claws and\r\n  devoid of rami.\r\n\r\n  (f) The segmentation of the body is anomomeristic, there being no\r\n  fixed number of somites characterizing all the forms included.\r\n\r\n  (g) The pair of eyes situated on the prosthomere are not of the\r\n  Euarthropod type, but resemble those of Chaetopods (hence\r\n  Nereid-ophthalmous).\r\n\r\n  (h) The muscles of the body-wall and gut do not consist of\r\n  transversely-striped muscular fibre, but of the unstriped tissue\r\n  observed also in Chaetopoda.\r\n\r\n  (i) A pair of coelomoducts is developed in every somite including the\r\n  prosthomere, in which alone it atrophies in later development.\r\n\r\n  (j) The ventral nerve-cords are widely separated--in fact, lateral in\r\n  position.\r\n\r\n  (k) There are no masses of nerve-cells forming a ganglion (neuromere)\r\n  in each somite. (In this respect the Protarthropoda are at a lower\r\n  stage than most of the existing Chaetopoda.)\r\n\r\n  (l) The genital ducts are formed by the enlargement of the\r\n  coelomoducts of the penultimate somite.\r\n\r\n    Class (Unica).--ONYCHOPHORA.\r\n\r\n  With the characters of the grade: add the presence within the body of\r\n  fine unbranched tracheal tubes, devoid of spiral thickening, opening\r\n  to the exterior by numerous irregularly scattered tracheal pits.\r\n\r\n  Genera--Eoperipatus, Peripatopsis, Opisthopatus, &c. (See PERIPATUS.)\r\n\r\n    Grade C (of the Arthropoda).--Euarthropoda.\r\n\r\n  (a) Integument heavily plated with firm chitinous cuticle, allowing no\r\n  expansion and retraction of regions of the body nor change of\r\n  dimensions, except, in some cases, a dorso-ventral bellows movement.\r\n  The separation of the heavier plates of chitin by grooves of delicate\r\n  cuticle results in the hinging or jointing of the body and its\r\n  appendages, and the consequent flexing and extending of the jointed\r\n  pieces.\r\n\r\n  (b) Claws and fangs are developed on the branches or rami of the\r\n  parapodia, not on the end of the axis or corm.\r\n\r\n  (c) The head is either deuterognathous, tritognathous, or\r\n  tetartognathous.\r\n\r\n  (d) Rarely only one, and usually at least two, of the somites\r\n  following the mandibular somite carry appendages modified as jaws\r\n  (with exceptions of a secondary origin).\r\n\r\n  (e) The rest of the somites may all carry appendages, or only a\r\n  limited number may carry appendages. In all cases the appendages\r\n  primarily develop rami or branches which form the limbs, the primitive\r\n  axis or corm being reduced and of insignificant size. In the most\r\n  primitive stock all the post-oral appendages had gnathobasic\r\n  outgrowths.\r\n\r\n  (f) The segmentation of the body is anomomeristic in the more archaic\r\n  members of each class, nomomeristic in the higher members.\r\n\r\n  (g) The two eyes of Chaetopod structure have disappeared, and are\r\n  replaced by the Euarthropod eyes.\r\n\r\n  (h) The muscles in all parts of the body consist of striped muscular\r\n  fibre, never of unstriped muscular tissue.\r\n\r\n  (i) The coelomoducts are suppressed in most somites, and retained only\r\n  as the single pair of genital ducts (very rarely more numerous) and in\r\n  some also as the excretory glands (one or two pairs).\r\n\r\n  (j) The ventral nerve-cords approach one another in the mid-ventral\r\n  line behind the mouth.\r\n\r\n  (k) The nerve-cells of the ventral nerve cords are segregated as\r\n  paired ganglia in each somite, often united by meristic dislocation\r\n  into composite ganglia.\r\n\r\n  (l) The genital ducts may be the coelomoducts of the penultimate or\r\n  ante-penultimate or adjacent somite, or of a somite placed near the\r\n  middle of the series, or of a somite far forward in the series.\r\n\r\n    Class 1 (of the Euarthropoda).--DIPLOPODA.\r\n\r\n  The head has but one prosthomere (monoprosthomerous), and is\r\n  accordingly deuterognathous. This carries short-jointed antennae (in\r\n  one case bi-ramose) and eyes, the structure and development of which\r\n  require further elucidation. Only one somite following the first\r\n  post-oral or mandibular segment has its appendages modified as jaws.\r\n\r\n  The somites of the body, except in Pauropus, either fuse after early\r\n  development and form double somites with two pairs of appendages\r\n  (Julus, &c.), or present legless and leg-bearing somites alternating.\r\n\r\n  Somites, anomomeristic, from 12 to 150 in the post-cephalic series.\r\n\r\n  The genital ducts open in the fourth, or between the fourth and fifth\r\n  post-oral somite.\r\n\r\n  Terrestrial forms with small-jointed legs formed by adaptation of a\r\n  single ramus of the appendage. Tracheae are present.\r\n\r\n  _Note._--The Diplopoda include the Juliformia, the Symphyla\r\n  (Scolopendrella), and Pauropoda (Pauropus). They were until recently\r\n  classified with the Chilopoda (Centipedes), with which they have no\r\n  close affinity, but only a superficial resemblance. (Compare the\r\n  definition of the class Chilopoda.)\r\n\r\n  The movement of the legs in Diplopoda is like that of those of\r\n  Peripatus, of the Phyllopod Crustacea, and of the parapodia of\r\n  Chaetopoda, symmetrical and identical on the two sides of the body.\r\n  The legs of Chilopoda move in alternating groups on the two sides of\r\n  the body. This implies a very much higher development of nerves and\r\n  muscles in the latter. (See MILLIPEDE.)\r\n\r\n    Class 2 (of the Euarthropoda).--ARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\n  Head tritognathous and diprosthomerous--that is to say, with two\r\n  prosthomeres, the first bearing typical eyes, the second a pair of\r\n  appendages reduced to a single ramus, which is in more primitive forms\r\n  antenniform, in higher forms chelate or retrovert. The ancestral stock\r\n  was pantognathobasic--i.e. had a gnathobase or jaw process on every\r\n  parapodium. As many as six pairs of appendages following the mouth may\r\n  have an enlarged gnathobase actually functional as a jaw or hemignath,\r\n  but a ramus is well developed on each of these appendages either as a\r\n  simple walking leg, a palp or a chela. In the more primitive forms the\r\n  appendage of every post-oral somite has a gnathobase and two rami; in\r\n  higher specialized forms the gnathobases may be atrophied in every\r\n  appendage, even in the first post-oral.\r\n\r\n  The more primitive forms are anomomeristic; the higher forms\r\n  nomomeristic, showing typically three groups or tagmata of six somites\r\n  each.\r\n\r\n  The genital apertures are placed on the first somite of the second\r\n  tagma or mesosoma. Their position is unknown in the more primitive\r\n  forms. The more primitive forms have branchial respiratory processes\r\n  developed on a ramus of each of the post-oral appendages. In higher\r\n  specialized forms these branchial processes become first of all\r\n  limited to five segments of the mesosoma, then sunk beneath the\r\n  surface as pulmonary organs, and finally atrophied, their place being\r\n  taken by a well-developed tracheal system.\r\n\r\n  A character of great diagnostic value in the more primitive Arachnida\r\n  is the tendency of the chitinous investment of the tergal surface of\r\n  the telson to unite during growth with that of the free somites in\r\n  front of it, so as to form a pygidial shield or posterior carapace,\r\n  often comprising as many as fifteen somites (Trilobites, Limulus).\r\n\r\n  A pair of central monomeniscous diplostichous eyes is often present on\r\n  the head. Lateral eyes also are often present which are monostichous\r\n  with aggregated lenses (_Limulus_) or with isolated lenses (Scorpio),\r\n  or are diplostichous with simple lens (_Pedipalpi_, Araneae, &c.).\r\n\r\n    Class 3 (of the Euarthropoda).--CRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\n  Head tetartognathous and triprosthomerous--that is to say, with three\r\n  prosthomeres; the first bearing typical eyes, the second a pair of\r\n  antenniform appendages (often bi-ramose), the third a pair of\r\n  appendages usually antenniform, sometimes claw-like. The ancestral\r\n  stock was (as in the Arachnida) pantognathobasic, that is to say, had\r\n  a gnathobase or jaw-process on the base of every post-oral appendage.\r\n\r\n  Besides the first post-oral or mandibular pair, at least two\r\n  succeeding pairs of appendages are modified as jaws. These have small\r\n  and insignificant rami, or none at all, a feature in which the\r\n  Arachnida differ from them. The appendages of four or more additional\r\n  following somites may be turned upwards towards the mouth and assist\r\n  in the taking of food.\r\n\r\n  The more primitive forms (Entomostraca) are anomomeristic, presenting\r\n  great variety as to number of somites, form of appendages, and\r\n  tagmatic grouping; the higher forms (Malacostraca) are nomomeristic,\r\n  showing in front of the telson twenty somites, of which the six hinder\r\n  carry swimmerets and the five next in front ambulatory limbs. The\r\n  genital apertures are neither far forward nor far backward in the\r\n  series of somites, e.g. on the fourteenth post-oral in Apus, on the\r\n  ninth post-oral in female Astacus and in Cyclops.\r\n\r\n  With rare exceptions, branchial plates are developed either by\r\n  modification of a ramus of the limbs or as processes on a ramus, or\r\n  upon the sides of the body. No tracheate Crustacea are known, but some\r\n  terrestrial Isopoda develop pulmonary in-sinkings of the integument. A\r\n  characteristic, comparable in value to that presented by the pygidial\r\n  shield of Arachnida, is the frequent development of a pair of long\r\n  appendages by the penultimate somite, which with the telson form a\r\n  trifid, or, when that is small, a bifid termination to the body.\r\n\r\n  The lateral eyes of Crustacea are polymeniscous, with highly\r\n  specialized retinulae like those of Hexapoda, and unlike the simpler\r\n  compound lateral eyes of lower Arachnida. Monomeniscous eyes are\r\n  rarely present, and when present, single, minute, and central in\r\n  position.\r\n\r\n  _Note._--The Crustacea exhibit a longer and more complete series of\r\n  forms than any other class of Arthropoda, and may be regarded as\r\n  preserving the most completely represented line of descent.\r\n\r\n    Class 4.--CHILOPODA.\r\n\r\n  Head triprosthomerous[3] and tetartognathous. The two somites\r\n  following the mandibular or first post-oral or buccal somite carry\r\n  appendages modified as maxillae. The fourth post-oral somite has its\r\n  appendages converted into very large and powerful hemignaths, which\r\n  are provided with poison-glands. The remaining somites carry\r\n  single-clawed walking legs, a single pair to each somite. The body is\r\n  anomomeristic, showing in different genera from 17 (inclusive of the\r\n  anal and genital) to 175 somites behind that which bears the poison\r\n  jaws. No tagmata are developed. The genital ducts open on the\r\n  penultimate somite.\r\n\r\n  Tracheae are developed which are dendriform and with spiral thickening\r\n  of their lining. Their trunks open at paired stigmata placed laterally\r\n  in each somite of the trunk or in alternate somites. Usually the\r\n  tracheae open by paired stigmata placed upon the sides of a greater or\r\n  less number of the somites, but never quite regularly on alternating\r\n  somites. At most they are present on all the pedigerous somites\r\n  excepting the first and the last. In _Scutigera_ there are seven\r\n  unpaired dorsal stigmata, each leading into a sac whence a number of\r\n  air-holding tubes project into the pencardial blood-sinus.\r\n\r\n  Renal caecal tubes (Malpighian tubes) open into the proctodaeum. (See\r\n  CENTIPEDE.)\r\n\r\n    Class 5.--HEXAPODA.\r\n\r\n  Head shown by its early development to be triprosthomerous and\r\n  consequently tetartognathous. The first prosthomere has its appendages\r\n  represented by the compound eyes and a protocerebrum, the second has\r\n  the antennae for its appendages and a deutocerebral neuromere, the\r\n  third has suffered suppression of its appendages (which corresponded\r\n  to the second pair of antennae of Crustacea), but has a tritocerebrum\r\n  and coelomic chamber. The mandibular somite bears a pair of\r\n  gnathobasic hemignaths without rami or palps, and is followed by two\r\n  jaw-bearing somites (maxillary and labial). This enumeration would\r\n  give six somites in all to the head--three prosthomeres and three\r\n  opisthomeres. Recent investigations (Folsom, 4) show the existence in\r\n  the embryo of a prae-maxillary or supra-lingual somite which is\r\n  suppressed during development. This gives seven somites to the\r\n  Hexapod's head, the tergites of which are fused to form a cephalic\r\n  carapace or box. The number is significant, since it agrees with that\r\n  found in Edriophthalmous Crustacea, and assigns the labium of the\r\n  Hexapod to the same somite numerically as that which carries the\r\n  labium-like maxillipedes of those Crustacea.\r\n\r\n  The somites following the head are strictly nomomeristic and\r\n  nomotagmic. The first three form the thorax, the appendages of which\r\n  are the walking legs, tipped with paired claws or ungues (compare the\r\n  homoplastic claws of Scorpio and Peripatus). Eleven somites follow\r\n  these, forming the abdominal \"tagma,\" giving thus twenty-one somites\r\n  in all (as in the higher Crustacea). The somites of the abdomen all\r\n  may carry rudimentary appendages in the embryo, and some of the hinder\r\n  somites may retain their appendages in a modified form in adult life.\r\n  Terminal telescoping of the abdominal somites and excalation may occur\r\n  in the adult, reducing the obvious abdominal somites to as few as\r\n  eight. The genital apertures are median and placed far back in the\r\n  series of somites, viz. the female on the seventh abdominal\r\n  (seventeenth of the whole series) and the male on the ninth or\r\n  ante-penultimate abdominal (nineteenth of the whole series). The\r\n  appendages of the eighth and tenth abdominal somites are modified as\r\n  gonapophyses. The eleventh abdominal segment is the telson, usually\r\n  small and soft; it carries the anus.\r\n\r\n  The Hexapoda are not only all confined to a very definite disposition\r\n  of the somites, appendages and apertures, as thus indicated, but in\r\n  other characters also they present the specialization of a\r\n  narrowly-limited highly-developed order of such a class as the\r\n  Crustacea rather than a range from lower more generalized to higher\r\n  more specialized forms such as that group and also the Arachnida\r\n  present. It seems to be a legitimate conclusion that the most\r\n  primitive Hexapoda were provided with wings, and that the term\r\n  Pterygota might be used as a synonym of Hexapoda. Many Hexapoda have\r\n  lost either one pair or both pairs of wings; cases are common of\r\n  wingless genera allied to ordinary Pterygote genera. Sdme Hexapods\r\n  which are very primitive in other respects happen to be also Apterous,\r\n  but this cannot be held to prove that the possession of wings is not a\r\n  primitive character of Hexapods (compare the case of the Struthious\r\n  Birds). The wings of Hexapoda are lateral expansions of the terga of\r\n  the second and third thoracic somites. They appear to be serial\r\n  equivalents (homogenous meromes) of the tracheal gills, which develop\r\n  in a like position on the abdominal segments of some aquatic Hexapods.\r\n\r\n  The Hexapoda are all provided with a highly developed tracheal system,\r\n  which presents considerable variation in regard to its stigmata or\r\n  orifices of communication with the exterior. In some a serial\r\n  arrangement of stigmata comparable to that observed in Chilopoda is\r\n  found. In other cases (some larvae) stigmata are absent; in other\r\n  cases again a single stigma is developed, as in the smaller Arachnida\r\n  and Chilopoda, in the median dorsal line or other unexpected position.\r\n  When the facile tendency of Arthropoda to develop tracheal air-tubes\r\n  is admitted, it becomes probable that the tracheae of Hexapods do not\r\n  all belong to one original system, but may be accounted for by new\r\n  developments within the group. Whether the primitive tracheal system\r\n  of Hexapoda was a closed one or open by serial stigmata in every\r\n  somite remains at present doubtful, but the intimate relation of the\r\n  system to the wings and tracheal gills cannot be overlooked.\r\n\r\n  The lateral eyes of Hexapoda, like those of Crustacea, belong to the\r\n  most specialized type of \"compound eye,\" found only in these two\r\n  classes. Simple monomeniscous eyes are also present in many Hexapods.\r\n\r\n  Renal excretory caeca (Malpighian tubes) are developed from the\r\n  proctodaeum (not from mesenteron as in scorpion and Amphipoda).\r\n\r\n  _Concluding Remarks on the Relationships to one another of the\r\n  Classes of the Arthropoda._--Our general conclusion from a survey of\r\n  the Arthropoda amounts to this, that whilst Peripatus, the Diplopoda,\r\n  and the Arachnida represent terrestrial offshoots from successive\r\n  lower grades of primitive aquatic Arthropoda which are extinct, the\r\n  Crustacea alone present a fairly full series of representatives\r\n  leading upwards from unspecialized forms. The latter were not very far\r\n  removed from the aquatic ancestors (Trilobites) of the Arachnida, but\r\n  differed essentially from them by the higher specialization of the\r\n  head. We can gather no indication of the forefathers of the Hexapoda\r\n  or of the Chilopoda less specialized than they are, whilst possessing\r\n  the essential characteristics of these classes. Neither embryology nor\r\n  palaeontology assists us in this direction. On the other hand, the\r\n  facts that the Hexapoda and the Chilopoda have triprosthomerous heads,\r\n  that the Hexapoda have the same total number of somites as the\r\n  nomomeristic Crustacea, and the same number of opisthomeres in the\r\n  head as the more terrestrial Crustacea, together with the same\r\n  adaptation of the form of important appendages in corresponding\r\n  somites, and that the compound eyes of both Crustacea and Hexapoda are\r\n  extremely specialized and elaborate in structure and identical in that\r\n  structure, all lead to the suggestion that the Hexapoda, and with\r\n  them, at no distant point, the Chilopoda, have branched off from the\r\n  Crustacean main stem as specialized terrestrial lines of descent. And\r\n  it seems probable that in the case of the Hexapoda, at any rate, the\r\n  point of departure was subsequent to the attainment of the\r\n  nomomeristic character presented by the higher grade of Crustacea. It\r\n  is on the whole desirable to recognize such affinities in our schemes\r\n  of classification.\r\n\r\n  We may tabulate the facts as to head-structure in Chaetopoda and\r\n  Arthropoda as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Grade x (below the Arthropoda).--AGNATHA, APROSTHOMERA.\r\n\r\n  Without parapodial jaws; without the addition of originally post-oral\r\n  somites to the prae-oral region, which is a simple prostomial lobe of\r\n  the first somite; the first somite is perforated by the mouth and its\r\n  parapodia are not modified as jaws.\r\n\r\n    = CHARTOPODA.\r\n\r\n    Grade 1 (of the Arthropoda).--MONOGNATHA, MONOPROSTHOMERA.\r\n\r\n  With a single pair of parapodial jaws carried by the somite which is\r\n  perforated by the mouth; this is not the first somite, but the second.\r\n  The first somite has become a prosthomere, and carries a pair of\r\n  extensile antennae.\r\n\r\n    = ONYCHOPHORA (_Peripatus, &c._).\r\n\r\n    Grade 2 (of the Arthropoda).--DIGNATHA, MONOPROSTHOMERA.\r\n\r\n  The third somite as well as the second develops a pair of parapodial\r\n  jaws; the first somite is a prosthomere carrying jointed antennae.\r\n\r\n    = DIPLOPODA.\r\n\r\n    Grade 3 (of the Arthropoda).--PANTOGNATHA, DIPROSTHOMERA.\r\n\r\n  A gnathobase is developed (in the primitive stock) on every pair of\r\n  post-oral appendages; two prosthomeres present, the second somite as\r\n  well as the first having passed in front of the mouth, but only the\r\n  second has appendages.\r\n\r\n    = ARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\n    Grade 4 (of the Arthropoda).--PANTOGNATHA, TRIPROSTHOMERA.\r\n\r\n  The original stock, like that of the last grade, has a gnathobase on\r\n  every post-oral appendage, but three prosthomeres are now present, in\r\n  consequence of the movement of the oral aperture from the third to the\r\n  fourth somite. The later eyes are polymeniscous, with specialized\r\n  vitrellae and retinulae of a definite type peculiar to this grade.\r\n\r\n    = CRUSTACEA, CHILOPODA, HEXAPODA.\r\n\r\n  According to older views the increase of the number of somites in\r\n  front of the mouth would have been regarded as a case of intercalation\r\n  by new somite-budding of new prae-oral somites in the series. We are\r\n  prohibited by a general consideration of metamerism in the Arthropoda\r\n  from adopting the hypothesis of intercalation of somites. However\r\n  strange it may seem, we have to suppose that one by one in the course\r\n  of long historical evolution somites have passed forwards and the\r\n  mouth has passed backwards. In fact, we have to suppose that the\r\n  actual somite which in grades 1 and 2 bore the mandibles lost those\r\n  mandibles, developed their rami as tactile organs, and came to occupy\r\n  a position in front of the mouth, whilst its previous jaw-bearing\r\n  function was taken up by the next somite in order, into which the oral\r\n  aperture had passed. A similar history must have been slowly brought\r\n  about when this second mandibulate somite in its turn became agnathous\r\n  and passed in front of the mouth. The mandibular parapodia may be\r\n  supposed during the successive stages of this history to have had,\r\n  from the first, well-developed rami (one or two) of a palp-like form,\r\n  so that the change required when the mouth passed away from them would\r\n  merely consist in the suppression of the gnathobase. The solid\r\n  palpless mandible such as we now see in some Arthropoda is,\r\n  necessarily, a late specialization. Moreover, it appears probable that\r\n  the first somite never had its parapodia modified as jaws, but became\r\n  a prosthomere with tactile appendages before parapodial jaws were\r\n  developed at all, or rather _pari passu_ with their development on the\r\n  second somite. It is worth while bearing in mind a second possibility\r\n  as to the history of the prosthomeres, viz. that the buccal\r\n  gnathobasic parapodia (the mandibles) were in each of the three grades\r\n  of prosthomerism only developed after the recession of the mouth and\r\n  the addition of one, of two, or of three post-oral somites to the\r\n  prae-oral region had taken place. In fact, we may imagine that the\r\n  characteristic adaptation of one or more pairs of post-oral parapodia\r\n  to the purposes of the mouth as jaws did not occur until after\r\n  ancestral forms with one, with two, and with three prosthomeres had\r\n  come into existence. On the whole the facts seem to be against this\r\n  supposition, though we need not suppose that the gnathobase was very\r\n  large or the rami undeveloped in the buccal parapodia which were\r\n  destined to lose their mandibular features and pass in front of the\r\n  mouth.\r\n\r\n  REFERENCES.--1.

(E. R. L.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] The group Arthropoda itself, thus constituted, was precisely\r\n    identical in its area with the Insecta of Linnaeus, the Entoma of\r\n    Aristotle. But the word \"Insect\" had become limited since the days of\r\n    Linnaeus to the Hexapod Pterygote forms, to the exclusion of his\r\n    Aptera. Lamarck's penetrating genius is chiefly responsible for the\r\n    shrinkage of the word Insecta, since it was he who, forty years after\r\n    Linnaeus's death, set up and named the two great classes Crustacea\r\n    and Arachnida (included by Linnaeus under Insecta as the order\r\n    \"Aptera\"), assigning to them equal rank with the remaining Insecta of\r\n    Linnaeus, for which he proposed the very appropriate class-name\r\n    \"Hexapoda.\" Lamarck, however, appears not to have insisted on this\r\n    name Hexapoda, and so the class of Pterygote Hexapods came to retain\r\n    the group-name Insecta, which is, historically or etymologically, no\r\n    more appropriate to them than it is to the classes Crustacea and\r\n    Arachnida. The tendency to retain the original name of an old and\r\n    comprehensive group for one of the fragments into which such group\r\n    becomes divided by the advance of knowledge--instead of keeping the\r\n    name for its logical use as a comprehensive term, including the new\r\n    divisions, each duly provided with a new name--is most curiously\r\n    illustrated in the history of the word physiology. Cicero says,\r\n    \"Physiologia naturae ratio,\" and such was the meaning of the name\r\n    _Physiologus_, given to a cyclopaedia of what was known and imagined\r\n    about earth, sea, sky, birds, beasts and fishes, which for a thousand\r\n    years was the authoritative source of information on these matters,\r\n    and was translated into every European tongue. With the revival of\r\n    learning, however, first one and then another special study became\r\n    recognized--anatomy, botany, zoology, mineralogy, until at last the\r\n    great comprehensive term physiology was bereft of all its\r\n    once-included subject-matter, excepting the study of vital processes\r\n    pursued by the more learned members of the medical profession.\r\n    Professional tradition and an astute perception on their part of the\r\n    omniscience suggested by the terms, have left the medical men in\r\n    English-speaking lands in undisturbed but illogical possession of the\r\n    words physiology, physic and physician.\r\n\r\n  [2] H. Milne-Edwards, who was followed by Huxley, long ago formulated\r\n    the conclusion that the eye-stalks of Crustacea are modified\r\n    appendages, basing his argument on a specimen of Palinurus (figured\r\n    in Bateson's book (1), in which the eye-stalk of one side is replaced\r\n    by an antenniform palp. Hofer (6) in 1894 described a similar case in\r\n    Astacus.\r\n\r\n  [3] Embryological evidence of this is still wanting. In the other\r\n    classes of Arthropoda we have more or less complete embryological\r\n    evidence on the subject. It appears from observation of the embryo\r\n    that whilst the first prosthomere of Centipedes has its appendages\r\n    reduced and represented only by eye-patches (as in Arachnida,\r\n    Crustacea and Hexapoda). the second has a rudimentary antenna, which\r\n    disappears, whilst the third carries the permanent antennae, which\r\n    accordingly correspond to the second antennae of Crustacea, and are\r\n    absent in Hexapoda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR (Fr. _Artus_), the central hero of the cycle of romance known as\r\nthe _Matiere de Bretagne_ (see ARTHURIAN LEGEND). Whether there was an\r\nhistoric Arthur has been much debated; undoubtedly for many centuries\r\nafter the appearance of Geoffrey of Monmouth's _Historia Britonum_\r\n(circ. 1136), the statements therein recorded of a mighty monarch, who\r\nruled over Britain in the 5th-6th centuries, and carried his conquests\r\nfar afield, even to the gates of Rome, obtained general, though not\r\nuniversal, credence. Even in the 12th century there were some who\r\ndetected, and derided, the fictitious character of Geoffrey's \"History.\"\r\nAs was naturally to be expected, the pendulum swung to the other\r\nextreme, and in a more critical age the existence of Arthur was roundly\r\ndenied. The truth probably lies midway between the two. The words of\r\nWace, the Norman poet who translated the _Historia_ into verse, are here\r\nadmirably to the point. Speaking of the tales told of Arthur, he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ne tot mencunge, ne tot veir,\r\n   Ne tot fable, ne tot saveir,\r\n   Tant ont li conteor conte,\r\n   Et li fableor tant fable\r\n   Por lor contes embeleter\r\n   Que tout ont fait fable sembler.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe opinion now generally accepted by scholars is that the evidence of\r\nNennius, whose _Historia Britonum_ preceded that of Geoffrey by some 400\r\nyears, is in the main to be relied on. He tells us that Arthur was _Dux\r\nbellorum_, and led the armies of the British kings against the Saxon\r\ninvaders, whom he defeated in twelve great battles. _Tunc Arthur\r\npugnabat cum regibus Britonum, sed ipse dux erat bettorum._\r\n\r\nThe traditional site of these battles covers a very wide area, and it is\r\nsupposed that Arthur held a post analogous to that of the general who,\r\nunder the Roman occupation, was known as _Comes Britanniae_, and held a\r\nroving commission to defend the island wherever attacked, in\r\ncontradistinction to the _Dux Britanniarum_, who had charge of the\r\nforces in the north, and the _Comes Littoris Saxonici_, whose task it\r\nwas to defend the south-east line. The Welsh texts never call Arthur\r\n_gwledig_ (prince), but _amheradawr_ (Latin _imperator_) or emperor, a\r\ntitle which would be bestowed on the highest official in the island. The\r\ntruth thus appears to be that, while there was never a _King_ Arthur,\r\nthere was a noted chieftain and general of that name. If we say that he\r\ncarried on a successful war against the Saxons, was probably betrayed by\r\nhis wife and a near kinsman, and fell in battle, we have stated all\r\nwhich can be claimed as an historical nucleus for his legend. It is now\r\ngenerally admitted that the representation of Arthur as world conqueror,\r\n_Welt-Kaiser_, is due to the influence of the Charlemagne cycle. In the\r\n12th century the _Matiere de France_ was waning, the _Matiere de\r\nBretagne_ waxing in popularity, and public opinion demanded that the\r\ncentral figure of the younger cycle (for whatever the date of the\r\nsubject matter, as a literary cycle the Arthurian is the younger) should\r\nnot be inferior in dignity and importance to that of the earlier. When\r\nwe add to this the fact that the writers of the 12th century represented\r\nthe personages and events of the 6th in the garb, and under the\r\nconditions, of their own time, we can understand the reason of the\r\nmanifold difficulties which beset the study of the cycle.\r\n\r\nBut into the figure of Arthur as we know him, other elements have\r\nentered; he is not merely an historic personality, but at the same time\r\na survival of pre-historic myth, a hero of romance, and a fairy king;\r\nand all these threads are woven together in one fascinating but\r\nbewildering web. It is only possible here to summarize the leading\r\nfeatures which may be claimed as characteristic of each phase.\r\n\r\n_Mythic._--Certain elements of the story point to Arthur as a culture\r\nhero; as such his name has been identified with the _Mercurius Artaius_\r\nof the Gauls. In this role he slays monsters, the boar Twrch Trwyth, the\r\ngiant of Mont St Michel and the Demon Cat of Losanne (Andre de Coutances\r\ntells us that Arthur was really vanquished and carried off by the Cat,\r\nbut that one durst not tell that tale before Britons!). He never, it\r\nshould be noted, rides on purely chivalric ventures, such as aiding\r\ndistressed damsels, seeking the Grail, &c. His expeditions are all more\r\nor less warlike. The story of his youth belongs, as Alfred Nutt\r\n(_Folk-lore_, vol. iv.) has shown, to the group of tales classified as\r\nthe _Aryan Expulsion and Return_ formula, found in all Aryan lands.\r\nNumerous parallels exist between the Arthurian and early Irish heroic\r\ncycles, notably the Fenian or Ossianic. This Fenian cycle is very\r\nclosely connected with the Tuatha de Danaan, the Celtic deities of\r\nvegetation and increase; recent research has shown that two notable\r\nfeatures of the Arthurian story, the Round Table and the Grail, can be\r\nmost reasonably accounted for as survivals of this Nature worship, and\r\nwere probably parts of the legend from the first.\r\n\r\n_Romantic._--The character of Arthur as a romantic hero is, in reality,\r\nvery different from that which, mainly through the popularity of\r\nTennyson's _Idylls_, English people are wont to suppose. In the earlier\r\npoems he is practically a lay figure, his court the point of departure\r\nand return for the knights whose adventures are related in detail, but\r\nhe himself a passive spectator. In the prose romances he is a monarch,\r\nthe splendour of whose court, whose riches and generosity, are the\r\nadmiration of all; but morally he is no whit different from the knights\r\nwho surround him; he takes advantage of his _bonnes fortunes_ as do\r\nothers. He has two sons, neither of them born in wedlock; one, Modred,\r\nis alike his son and his nephew. In certain romances, the _Perlesvaus_\r\nand _Diu Crone_, he is a veritable _roi faineant_, overcome by sloth and\r\nluxury. Certain traits of his story appear to show the influence of\r\nNorthern romance. Such is the story of his begetting, where Uther takes\r\nupon him the form of Gorlois to deceive Yguerne, even as Siegfried\r\nchanged shapes with Gunther to the undoing of Brunnhilde. The sword in\r\nthe perron (stone pillar or block), the withdrawal of which proves his\r\nright to the kingdom, is the sword of the Branstock. Morgain carries him\r\noff, mortally wounded, to Avalon, even as the Valkyr bears the Northern\r\nhero to Valhal. Morgain herself has many traits in common with the\r\nValkyrie; she is one of nine sisters, she can fly through the air as a\r\nbird (Swan maiden); she possesses a marvellous ointment (as does Hilde,\r\nthe typical Valkyr). The idea of a slumbering hero who shall awake at\r\nthe hour of his country's greatest need is world-wide, but the most\r\nfamous instances are Northern, e.g. Olger Danske and Barbarossa, and\r\ndepend ultimately on an identification with the gods of the Northern\r\nPantheon, notably Thor. W. Larminie cited an instance of a rhyme current\r\nin the Orkneys as a charm against nightmare, which confuses Arthur with\r\nSiegfried and his winning of the Valkyr.\r\n\r\n_Fairy._--We find that at Arthur's birth (according to Layamon, who here\r\ndiffers from Wace), three ladies appeared and prophesied his future\r\ngreatness. This incident is also found in the first continuation to the\r\n_Perceval_, where the prediction is due to a lady met with beside a\r\nforest spring, clearly here a water fairy. In the late romance of _La\r\nBataille de Loquifer_ Avalon has become a purely fairy kingdom, where\r\nArthur rules in conjunction with Morgain. In _Huon de Bordeaux_ he is\r\nOberon's heir and successor, while in the romance of _Brun de la\r\nMontagne_, preserved in a unique MS. of the Bibliotheque Nationale, we\r\nhave the curious statement that all fairy-haunted places, wherever\r\nfound, belong to Arthur:--\r\n\r\n  \"Et touz ces lieux faes\r\n   Sont Artus de Bretagne.\"\r\n\r\nThis brief summary of the leading features of the Arthurian tradition\r\nwill indicate with what confused and complex material we are here\r\ndealing. (See also ARTHURIAN LEGEND, GRAIL, MERLIN, ROUND TABLE; and\r\nCELT: _Celtic literature_.)\r\n\r\n  _Texts_. Historic:--Nennius, _Historia Britonum_; H. Zimmer, _Nennius\r\n  Vindicatus_ (Berlin, 1893), an examination into the credibility of\r\n  Nennius; Geoffrey of Monmouth, _Historia Britonum_ (translations of\r\n  both histories are in Bohn's Library); Wace, the _Brut_ (ed. by Leroux\r\n  de Lincey); Layamon (ed. by Sir Fred. Madden).\r\n\r\n  Romantic:--_Merlin_--alike in the Ordinary, or Vulgate (ed. Sommer),\r\n  the _Suite_ or \"Huth\" _Merlin_, the 13th century _Merlin_ (ed. by G.\r\n  Paris and J. Ulrich), and the unpublished and unique version of _Bibl.\r\n  nat. fonds francais_, 337 (cf. Freymond's analysis in _Zeitschrift fur\r\n  franz. Sprache_, xxii.)--devotes considerable space to the elaboration\r\n  of the material supplied by the chronicles, the beginning of Arthur's\r\n  reign, his marriage and wars with the Saxons. The imitation of the\r\n  Charlemagne romances is here evident; the Saxons bear names of Saracen\r\n  origin, and camels and elephants appear on the scene. The _Morte\r\n  Arthur_, or _Mort au roi Artus_, a metrical romance, of which a unique\r\n  English version exists in the Thornton collection (ed. for Early\r\n  English Text Society), gives an expanded account of the passing of\r\n  Arthur; in the French prose form it is now always found incorporated\r\n  with the _Lancelot_, of which it forms the concluding section. The\r\n  remains of the Welsh tradition are to be found in the _Mabinogion_\r\n  (cf. Nutt's edition, where the stories are correctly classified), and\r\n  in the Triads. Professor Rhys' _Studies in the Arthurian Legend_ are\r\n  largely based on Welsh material, and may be consulted for details,\r\n  though the conclusions drawn are not in harmony with recent research.\r\n  These are the only texts in which Arthur is the central figure; in the\r\n  great bulk of the romances his is but a subordinate role.\r\n       (J. L. W.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Nor all a lie, nor all true, nor all fable, nor all known, so\r\n    much have the story-tellers told, and the fablers fabled, in order to\r\n    embellish their tales, that they have made all seem fable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR I. (1187-1203), duke of Brittany, was the posthumous son of\r\nGeoffrey, the fourth son of Henry II. of England, and Constance, heiress\r\nof Conan IV., duke of Brittany. The Bretons hoped that their young\r\nprince would uphold their independence, which was threatened by the\r\nEnglish. Henry II. tried to seize Brittany, and in 1187 forced Constance\r\nto marry one of his favourites, Randulph de Blundevill, earl of Chester\r\n(d. 1232). Henry, however, died soon afterwards (1189). The new king of\r\nEngland, Richard Coeur de Lion, claimed the guardianship of the young\r\nArthur, but in 1190 Richard left for the Crusade. Constance profited by\r\nhis absence by governing the duchy, and in 1194 she had Arthur\r\nproclaimed duke of Brittany by an assembly of barons and bishops.\r\nRichard invaded Brittany in 1196, but was defeated in 1197 and became\r\nreconciled to Constance. On his death in 1189, the nobles of Anjou,\r\nMaine and Touraine refused to recognize John of England, and did homage\r\nto Arthur, who declared himself the vassal of Philip Augustus. In 1202\r\nwar was resumed between the king of England and the king of France. The\r\nking of France recognized Arthur's right to Brittany, Anjou, Maine and\r\nPoitou. While Philip Augustus was invading Normandy, Arthur tried to\r\nseize Poitou. But, surprised at Mirebeau, he fell into the hands of\r\nJohn, who sent him prisoner to Falaise. In the following year he was\r\ntransferred to Rouen, and disappeared suddenly. It is thought that John\r\nkilled him with his own hand. After this murder John was condemned by\r\nthe court of peers of France, and stripped of the fiefs which he\r\npossessed in France.\r\n\r\n  See Ralph of Coggeshall, \"Chronicon Anglicanum,\" in the _Monumenta\r\n  Britanniae historica_; Dom Lobineau, _Histoire de Bretagne_ (1702);\r\n  Dom Morice, _Histoire de Bretagne_ (1742-1756); A. de la Borderie,\r\n  _Histoire de Bretagne_, vol. iii.

(1393-1458), earl of Richmond, constable of France, and\r\nafterwards duke of Brittany, was the third son of John IV., duke of\r\nBrittany, and Joan of Navarre, afterwards the wife of Henry IV. of\r\nEngland. His brother, John V., gave him his earldom of Richmond in\r\nEngland. While still very young, he took part in the civil wars which\r\ndesolated France during the reign of Charles VI. From 1410 to 1414 he\r\nserved on the side of the Armagnacs, and afterwards entered the service\r\nof Louis the dauphin, whose intimate friend he became. He profited by\r\nhis position at court to obtain the lieutenancy of the Bastille, the\r\ngovernorship of the duchy of Nemours, and the confiscated territories of\r\nJean Larcheveque, seigneur of Parthenay. His efforts to reduce the\r\nlatter were, however, interrupted by the necessity of marching against\r\nthe English. At Agincourt he was wounded and captured, and remained a\r\nprisoner in England from 1415 to 1420. Released on parole, he gained the\r\nfavour of King Henry V. by persuading his brother, the duke of Brittany,\r\nto conclude the treaty of Troyes, by which France was handed over to the\r\nEnglish king. He was rewarded with the countship of Ivry.\r\n\r\nIn 1423 Arthur married Margaret of Burgundy, widow of the dauphin Louis,\r\nand became thus the brother-in-law of Philip the Good of Burgundy, and\r\nof the regent, the duke of Bedford. Offended, however, by Bedford's\r\nrefusal to give him a high command, he severed his connexion with the\r\nEnglish, and in March 1425 accepted the constable's sword from King\r\nCharles VII. He now threw himself with ardour into the French cause,\r\nand persuaded his brother, John V. of Brittany, to conclude with Charles\r\nVII. the treaty of Saumur (October 7, 1425). But though he saw clearly\r\nenough the measures necessary for success, he lacked the means to carry\r\nthem out. In the field he met with a whole series of reverses; and at\r\ncourt, where his rough and overbearing manners made him disliked, his\r\ninfluence was overshadowed by that of a series of incompetent\r\nfavourites. The peace concluded between the duke of Brittany and the\r\nEnglish in September 1427 led to his expulsion from the court, where\r\nGeorges de la Tremoille, whom he himself had recommended to the king,\r\nremained supreme for six years, during which Richmond tried in vain to\r\noverthrow him. In the meantime, in June 1429, he joined Joan of Arc at\r\nOrleans, and fought in several battles under her banner, till the\r\ninfluence of La Tremoille forced his withdrawal from the army. On the\r\n5th of March 1432 Charles VII. concluded with him and with Brittany the\r\ntreaty of Rennes; but it was not until June of the following year that\r\nLa Tremoille was overthrown. Arthur now resumed the war against the\r\nEnglish, and at the same time took vigorous measures against the\r\nplundering bands of soldiers and peasants known as _routiers_ or\r\n_ecorcheurs_. On the 20th of September 1435, mainly as a result of his\r\ndiplomacy, was signed the treaty of Arras between Charles VII. and the\r\nduke of Burgundy, to which France owed her salvation.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of April 1436, Arthur took Paris from the English; but he\r\nwas ill seconded by the king, and hampered by the necessity for leading\r\nfrequent expeditions against the _ecorcheurs_; it was not till May 1444\r\nthat the armistice of Tours gave him leisure to carry out the\r\nreorganization of the army which he had long projected. He now created\r\nthe _compagnies d'ordonnance_, and endeavoured to organize the militia\r\nof the _francs archers_. This reform had its effect in the struggles\r\nthat followed. In alliance with his nephew, the duke of Brittany, he\r\nreconquered, during September and October 1449, nearly all the Cotentin;\r\non the 15th of April 1450 he gained over the English the battle of\r\nFormigny; and during the year he recovered for France the whole of\r\nNormandy, which for the next six or seven years it was his task to\r\ndefend from English attacks. On the death of his nephew Peter II., on\r\nthe 22nd of September 1457, he became duke of Brittany, and though\r\nretaining his office of constable of France, he refused, like his\r\npredecessors, to do homage to the French king for his duchy. He reigned\r\nlittle more than a year, dying on the 26th of December 1458, and was\r\nsucceeded by his nephew Francis II., son of his brother Richard, count\r\nof Etampes.\r\n\r\nArthur was three times married: (1) to Margaret of Burgundy, duchess of\r\nGuienne (d. 1442); (2) to Jeanne d'Albret, daughter of Charles II. of\r\nAlbret (d. 1444); (3) to Catherine of Luxemburg, daughter of Peter of\r\nLuxemburg, count of St Pol, who survived him. He left no legitimate\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The main source for the life of Duke Arthur III. is the\r\n  chronicle of Guillaume Gruel (c. 1410-1474-1482). Gruel entered the\r\n  service of the earl of Richmond about 1425, shared in all his\r\n  campaigns, and lived with him on intimate terms. The chronicle covers\r\n  the whole period of the duke's life, but the earlier part, up to 1425,\r\n  is much less full and important than the later, which is based on\r\n  Gruel's personal knowledge and observation. In spite of a perhaps\r\n  exaggerated admiration for his hero, Gruel displays in his work so\r\n  much good faith, insight and originality that he is accepted as a\r\n  thoroughly trustworthy authority. It was first published at Paris in\r\n  1622. Of the numerous later editions, the best is that of Achille le\r\n  Vavasseur, _Chronique d'Arthur de Richemont_ (Paris, 1890). See also\r\n  E. Cosneau, _Le Connetable de Richemont_ (Paris, 1886); G. du Fresne\r\n  de Beaucourt, _Histoire de Charles VII._ (Paris, 1881, seq.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR, CHESTER ALAN (1830-1886), twenty-first president of the United\r\nStates, was born in Fairfield, Vermont, on the 5th of October 1830. His\r\nfather, William Arthur (1796-1875), when eighteen years of age,\r\nemigrated from Co. Antrim, Ireland, and, after teaching in various\r\nplaces in Vermont and Lower Canada, became a Baptist minister. William\r\nArthur had married Malvina Stone, an American girl who lived at the time\r\nof the marriage in Canada, and the numerous changes of the family\r\nresidence afforded a basis for allegations in 1880 that the son Chester\r\nwas born not in Vermont, but in Canada, and was therefore ineligible for\r\nthe presidency. Chester entered Union College as a sophomore, and\r\ngraduated with honour in 1848. He then became a schoolmaster, at the\r\nsame time studying law. In 1853 he entered a law office in New York\r\ncity, and in the following year was admitted to the bar. His reputation\r\nas a lawyer began with his connexion with the famous \"Lemmon slave\r\ncase,\" in which, as one of the special counsel for the state, he secured\r\na decision from the highest state courts that slaves brought into New\r\nYork while in transit between two slave states were _ipso facto_ free.\r\nIn another noted case, in 1855, he obtained a decision that negroes were\r\nentitled to the same accommodations as whites on the street railways of\r\nNew York city. In politics he was actively associated from the outset\r\nwith the Republican party. When the Civil War began he held the position\r\nof engineer-in-chief on Governor Edwin D. Morgan's staff, and afterwards\r\nbecame successively acting quartermaster-general, inspector-general, and\r\nquartermaster-general of the state troops, in which capacities he showed\r\nmuch administrative efficiency. At the close of Governor Morgan's term,\r\non the 31st of December 1862, General Arthur resumed the practice of his\r\nprofession, remaining active, however, in party politics in New York\r\ncity. In November 1871 he was appointed by President U.S. Grant\r\ncollector of customs for the port of New York. The custom-house had long\r\nbeen conspicuous for the most flagrant abuses of the \"spoils system\";\r\nand though General Arthur admitted that the evils existed and that they\r\nrendered efficient administration impossible, he made no extensive\r\nreforms. In 1877 President Rutherford B. Hayes began the reform of the\r\ncivil service with the New York custom-house. A non-partisan commission,\r\nappointed by Secretary John Sherman, recommended sweeping changes. The\r\npresident demanded the resignation of Arthur and his two principal\r\nsubordinates, George H. Sharpe, the surveyor, and Alonzo B. Cornell, the\r\nnaval officer, of the Port. General Arthur refused to resign on the\r\nground that to retire \"under fire\" would be to acknowledge wrong-doing,\r\nand claimed that as the abuses were inherent in a widespread system he\r\nshould not be made to bear the responsibility alone. His cause was\r\nespoused by Senator Roscoe Conkling, for a time successfully; but on the\r\n11th of July 1878, during a recess of the Senate, the collector was\r\nremoved, and in January 1879, after another severe struggle, this action\r\nreceived the approval of the Senate. In 1880 General Arthur was a\r\ndelegate at large from New York to the Republican national convention.\r\nIn common with the rest of the \"Stalwarts,\" he worked hard for the\r\nnomination of Gen. U.S. Grant for a third term. Upon the triumph of\r\nJames A. Garfield, the necessity of conciliating the defeated faction\r\nled to the hasty acceptance of Arthur for the second place on the\r\nticket. His nomination was coldly received by the public; and when,\r\nafter his election and accession, he actively engaged on behalf of\r\nConkling in the great conflict with Garfield over the New York\r\npatronage, the impression was widespread that he was unworthy of his\r\nposition. Upon the death of President Garfield, on the 19th of September\r\n1881, Arthur took the oath as his successor. Contrary to the general\r\nexpectation, his appointments were as a rule unexceptionable, and he\r\nearnestly promoted the Pendleton law for the reform of the civil\r\nservice. His use of the veto in 1882 in the cases of a Chinese\r\nImmigration Bill (prohibiting immigration of Chinese for twenty years)\r\nand a River and Harbour Bill (appropriating over $18,000,000, to be\r\nexpended on many insignificant as well as important streams) confirmed\r\nthe favourable impression which had been made. The most important events\r\nof his administration were the passage of the Tariff Act of 1883 and of\r\nthe \"Edmunds Law\" prohibiting polygamy in the territories, and the\r\ncompletion of three great trans-continental railways--the Southern\r\nPacific, the Northern Pacific, and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe. His\r\nadministration was lacking in political situations of a dramatic\r\ncharacter, but on all questions that arose his policy was sane and\r\ndignified. In 1884 he allowed his name to be presented for renomination\r\nin the Republican convention, but he was easily defeated by the friends\r\nof James G. Blaine. At the expiration of his term he resumed his\r\nresidence in New York city, where he died on the 18th of November 1886.\r\n\r\n  For an account of his administration see UNITED STATES: _History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHURIAN LEGEND. By the \"Arthurian legend,\" or _Matiere de Brelagne_,\r\nwe mean the subject-matter of that important body of medieval literature\r\nknown as the Arthurian cycle (see ARTHUR). The period covered by the\r\ntexts in their present form represents, roughly speaking, the century\r\n1150-1250. The _History_ of Nennius is, of course, considerably earlier,\r\nand that of Geoffrey of Monmouth somewhat antedates 1150 (1136), but\r\nwith these exceptions the dates above given will be found to cover the\r\ncomposition of all our extant texts.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of this _Matiere de Bretagne_, and the circumstances\r\nunder which it became a favourite theme for literary treatment, two\r\ndiametrically opposite theories are held. One body of scholars, headed\r\nby Professor Wendelin Forster of Bonn, while admitting that, so far as\r\nany historic basis can be traced, the events recorded must have happened\r\non insular ground, maintain that the knowledge of these events, and\r\ntheir romantic development, are due entirely to the Bretons of the\r\ncontinent. The British who fled before the Teutonic and Scandinavian\r\ninvasions of the 6th and 8th centuries, had carried with them to\r\nArmorica, and fondly cherished, the remembrance of Arthur and his deeds,\r\nwhich in time had become interwoven with traditions of purely Breton\r\norigin. On the other side of the Channel, i.e. in Arthur's own land,\r\nthese memories had died out, or at most survived only as the faint echo\r\nof historic tradition. Through the medium of French-speaking Bretons\r\nthese tales came to the cognizance of Northern French poets, notably\r\nChretien de Troyes, who wove them into romances. According to Professor\r\nForster there were no Arthurian romances previous to Chretien, and\r\nequally, of course, no insular romantic tradition. This theory reposes\r\nmainly on the supposed absence of pre-Chretien poems, and on the\r\nwritings of Professor H. Zimmer, who derives the Arthurian names largely\r\nfrom Breton roots. This represents the prevailing standpoint of German\r\nscholars, and may be called the \"continental\" theory. In opposition to\r\nthis the school of which the late Gaston Paris was the leading, and most\r\nbrilliant, representative, maintains that the Arthurian tradition,\r\nromantic equally with historic, was preserved in Wales through the\r\nmedium of the bards, was by them communicated to their Norman\r\nconquerors, worked up into poems by the Anglo-Normans, and by them\r\ntransmitted to the continental poets. This, the \"insular\" theory, in\r\nspite of its inherent probability, has hitherto been at a disadvantage\r\nthrough lack of positive evidence, but in a recently acquired MS. of the\r\nBritish Museum, Add. 36614, we find the first continuator of the\r\n_Perceval_, Wauchier de Denain, quoting as authority for stories of\r\nGawain a certain Bleheris, whom he states to have been \"born and bred in\r\nWales.\" The identity of this Bleheris with the Bledhericus mentioned by\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis as _Famosus ille fabulator_, living at a bygone and\r\nunspecified date, and with the Breri quoted by Thomas as authority for\r\nthe _Tristan_ story, has been fully accepted by leading French scholars.\r\nFurther, on the evidence of certain MSS. of the _Perceval_, notably the\r\nParis MS. (Bibl. Nat. 1450), it is clear that Chretien was using, and\r\nusing freely, the work of a predecessor, large fragments of which have\r\nbeen preserved by the copyists who completed his unfinished work. The\r\nevidence of recent discoveries is all in favour of the insular, or\r\nFrench, view.\r\n\r\nSo far as the character, as distinguished from the _provenance_, of this\r\nsubject-matter is concerned, it is largely of folk-lore origin,\r\nrepresenting the working over of traditions, in some cases (as e.g. in\r\nthe account of Arthur's birth and upbringing) common to all the Aryan\r\npeoples, in others specifically Celtic. Thus there are a number of\r\nparallels between the Arthurian and the Irish heroic cycles, the precise\r\nnature of which has yet to be determined. So far as Arthur himself is\r\nconcerned these parallels are with the Fenian, or Ossianic, cycle, in\r\nthe case of Gawain with the Ultonian.\r\n\r\nIn its literary form the cycle falls into three\r\ngroups:--pseudo-historic: the _Histories_ of Nennius and Geoffrey, the\r\n_Brut_ of Wace and Layamon (see ARTHUR); poetic: the works of Chretien\r\nde Troyes, Thomas, Raoul de Houdenc and others (see GAWAIN, PERCEVAL,\r\nTRISTAN, and the writers named above); prose: the largest and most\r\nimportant group (see GRAIL, LANCELOT, MERLIN, TRISTAN). Of these three\r\nbranches the prose romances offer the most insuperable problems; none\r\ncan be dated with any certainty; all are of enormous length; and all\r\nhave undergone several redactions. Of not one do we as yet possess a\r\ncritical and comparative text, and in the absence of such texts the\r\npublication of any definite and detailed theory as to the evolution and\r\nrelative position of the separate branches of the Arthurian cycle is to\r\nbe deprecated. The material is so vast in extent, and in so chaotic a\r\ncondition, that the construction of any such theory is only calculated\r\nto invite refutation and discredit.\r\n\r\n  The best general study of the cycle is to be found in Gaston Paris's\r\n  manual _La Litterature francaise au moyen age_ (new and revised\r\n  edition, 1905). See also the introduction to vol. xxx. of _Histoire\r\n  litteraire de la France_. For the theories as to origin, see the\r\n  Introductions to Professor Forster's editions of the poems of Chretien\r\n  de Troyes, notably that to vol. iv., _Der Karrenritter_, which is a\r\n  long and elaborate restating of his position. Also Professor H.\r\n  Zimmer's articles in _Gottingische gelehrte Anzeigen_, 12 and 20. For\r\n  the Insular view, Ferd. Lot's \"Etudes sur la provenance du cycle\r\n  arthurien,\" _Romania_, vols. xxiv.-xxviii., are very valuable. For a\r\n  popular treatment of the subject, cf. Nos. i. and iv. of _Popular\r\n  Studies in Romance and Folk-lore_ (Nutt). Robert Huntington Fletcher's\r\n  \"The Arthurian Matter in the Chronicles\" (vol. x. of _Harvard Studies\r\n  and Notes in Philology and Literature_), is a most useful summary.\r\n       (J. L. W.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICHOKE. The common artichoke, _Cynara, scolymus_, is a plant\r\nbelonging to the natural order Compositae, having some resemblance to a\r\nlarge thistle. It has long been esteemed as a culinary vegetable; the\r\nparts chiefly employed being the immature receptacle or floret disk,\r\nwith the lower part of the surrounding leaf-scales, which are known as\r\n\"artichoke bottoms.\" In Italy the receptacles, dried, are largely used\r\nin soups; those of the cultivated plant as _Carciofo domestico_, and of\r\nthe wild variety as _Carciofo spinoso_.\r\n\r\nThe Jerusalem artichoke, _Helianthus tuberosus_, is a distinct plant\r\nbelonging to the same order, cultivated for its tubers. It closely\r\nresembles the sunflower, and its popular name is a corruption of the\r\nItalian _Girasole Articiocco_, the sunflower artichoke. It is a native\r\nof Canada and the north-eastern United States, and was cultivated by the\r\naborigines. The tubers are rich in the carbohydrate inulin and in sugar.\r\n\r\nThe name is derived from the northern Italian _articiocco_, or\r\n_arciciocco_, modern _carciofo_; these words come, through the Spanish,\r\nfrom the Arabic _al-kharshuf_. False etymology has corrupted the word in\r\nmany languages: it has been derived in English from \"choke,\" and\r\n\"heart,\" or the Latin _hortus_, a garden; and in French, the form\r\n_artichaut_ has been connected with _chaud_, hot, and _chou_, a cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE (from Lat. _articulus_, a joint), a term primarily for that\r\nwhich connects two parts together, and so transferred to the parts thus\r\njoined; thus the word is used of the separate clauses or heads in\r\ncontracts, treaties or statutes and the like; of a literary composition\r\non some specific subject in a periodical; or of particular commodities,\r\nas in \"articles of trade and commerce.\" It appears also in the phrase\r\n\"in the article of death\" to translate _in articulo mortis_, at the\r\nmoment of death. In grammar the term is used of the adjectives which\r\nstate the extension of a substantive, i.e. the number of individuals to\r\nwhich a name applies; the indefinite article denoting one or any of a\r\nparticular class, the definite denoting a particular member of a class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, in English company law, the regulations for the\r\ninternal management of a joint stock company registered under the\r\nCompanies Acts. They are, in fact, the terms of the partnership agreed\r\nupon by the shareholders among themselves. They regulate such matters as\r\nthe transfer and forfeiture of shares, calls upon shares, the\r\nappointment and qualification of directors, their powers and\r\nproceedings, general meetings of the shareholders, votes, dividends, the\r\nkeeping and audit of accounts, and other such matters. In regard to\r\nthese internal regulations the legislature has left the company free to\r\nadopt whatever terms of association it chooses. It has furnished in the\r\nschedule to the Companies Act 1862 (Table A), a model or specimen set of\r\nregulations, but their adoption, wholly or in part, is optional; only if\r\na company does not register articles of its own these statutory\r\nregulations are to apply. When, as is commonly the case, a company\r\ndecides to have articles of its own framing, such articles must be\r\nexpressed in separate paragraphs, numbered arithmetically, and signed by\r\nthe subscribers of the memorandum of association. They must also be\r\nprinted, stamped like a deed, and attested. When so perfected, they are\r\nto be delivered, with the memorandum of association, to the registrar of\r\njoint stock companies, who is to retain and register them. The articles\r\nof association thereupon become a public document, which any person may\r\ninspect on payment of a fee of one shilling. This has important\r\nconsequences, because every person dealing with the company is presumed\r\nto be acquainted with its constitution, and to have read its articles.\r\nThe articles, also, upon registration, bind the company and its members\r\nto the same extent as if each member had subscribed his name and affixed\r\nhis seal to them. (See also MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION; COMPANY;\r\nINCORPORATION.)\r\n\r\nIn the United States, articles of association are any instrument in\r\nwriting which sets forth the purposes, the terms and conditions upon\r\nwhich a body of persons have united for the prosecution of a joint\r\nenterprise. When this instrument is duly executed and filed, the law\r\ngives it the force and effects of a charter of incorporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICULATA, a zoological name now obsolete, applied by Cuvier to\r\nanimals, such as insects and worms, in which the body displays a jointed\r\nstructure. (See ARTHROPODA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICULATION (from Lat. _articulare_, to divide into joints), the act of\r\njoining together; in anatomy the junction of the bones (see JOINTS); in\r\nbotany the point of attachment and separation of the deciduous parts of\r\na plant, such as a leaf. The word is also used for division into\r\ndistinct parts, as of human speech by words or syllables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTILLERY (the O. Fr. _artiller_, to equip with engines of war, probably\r\ncomes from Late Lat. _articulum_, dim. of _ars_, art, cf. \"engine\" from\r\n_ingenium_, or of _artus_, joint), a term originally applied to all\r\nengines for discharging missiles, and in this sense used in English in\r\nthe early 17th century. In a more restricted sense, artillery has come\r\nto mean all firearms not carried and used by hand, and also the\r\n_personnel_ and organization by which the power of such weapons is\r\nwielded. It is, however, not usual to class _machine guns_ (q.v.) as\r\nartillery. The present article deals with the development and\r\ncontemporary state of the artillery arm in land warfare, in respect of\r\nits organization, personnel and special or \"formal\" employment. For the\r\n_materiel_--the guns, their carriages and their ammunition--see ORDNANCE\r\nand AMMUNITION. For _ballistics_, see that heading, and for the work of\r\nartillery in combination with the other arms, see TACTICS.\r\n\r\nArtillery, as distinct from ordnance, is usually classified in\r\naccordance with the functions it has to perform. The simplest division\r\nis that into _mobile_ and _immobile_ artillery, the former being\r\nconcerned with the handling of all weapons so mounted as to be capable\r\nof more or less easy movement from place to place, the latter with that\r\nof weapons which are installed in fixed positions. Mobile artillery is\r\nsubdivided, again chiefly in respect of its employment, into _horse_ and\r\n_field_ batteries, _heavy field_ or _position_ artillery, _field\r\nhowitzers, mountain artillery_ and _siege trains_, adapted to every kind\r\nof terrain in which field troops may be employed, and work they may have\r\nto do. Immobile artillery is used in fixed positions of all kinds, and\r\nabove all in permanent fortifications; it cannot, therefore, be\r\nclassified as above, inasmuch as the _raison d'etre_, and consequently\r\nthe armament of one fort or battery may be totally distinct from that of\r\nanother. \"Fortress,\" \"Garrison\" and \"Foot\" artillery are the usual names\r\nfor this branch. The dividing line, indeed, in the case of the heavier\r\nweapons, varies with circumstances; guns of position may remain on their\r\nground while elaborate fortifications grow up around them, or the\r\ndeficiencies of a field army in artillery may be made good from the\r\n_materiel_, more frequently still from the _personnel_, of the fortress\r\nartillery. Thus it may happen that mobile artillery becomes immobile and\r\nvice versa. But under normal circumstances the principle of\r\nclassification indicated is maintained in all organized military forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SKETCH\r\n\r\n1. _Early Artillery._--Mechanical appliances for throwing projectiles\r\nwere produced early in the history of organized warfare, and \"engines\r\ninvented by cunning men to shoot arrows and great stones\" are mentioned\r\nin the Old Testament. These were continually improved, and, under the\r\nvarious names of _catapulta, balista, onager, trebuchet_, &c., were\r\nemployed throughout the ancient and medieval periods of warfare. The\r\nmachines finally produced were very powerful, and, even when a\r\npropelling agent so strong as gunpowder was discovered and applied, the\r\nsupersession of the older weapons was not effected suddenly nor without\r\nconsiderable opposition. The date of the first employment of cannon\r\ncannot be established with any certainty, but there is good evidence to\r\nshow that the Germans used guns at the siege of Cividale in Italy\r\n(1331). The terms of a commission given (1414) by Henry V. to his\r\n_magister operationum, ingeniarum, et gunnarum ac aliarum ordinationum_,\r\none Nicholas Merbury, show that the organization of artillery\r\nestablishments was grafted upon that which was already in existence for\r\nthe service of the old-fashioned machines. Previously to this it is\r\nrecorded that of some 340 men forming the ordnance establishment of\r\nEdward III. in 1344 only 12 were artillerymen and gunners. Two years\r\nlater, at Crecy, it is said, the English brought guns into the open\r\nfield for the first time. At the siege of Harfleur (1415) the ordnance\r\nestablishment included 25 \"master gunners\" and 50 \"servitour gunners.\"\r\nThe \"gunner\" appears to have been the captain of the gun, with general\r\ncharge of the guns and stores, and the special duty of laying and firing\r\nthe piece in action.\r\n\r\n2. _The Beginnings of Field Artillery._--It is clear, from such evidence\r\nas we possess, that the chief and almost the only use of guns at this\r\ntime was to batter the walls of fortifications, and it is not until\r\nlater in the 15th century that their employment in the field became\r\ngeneral (see also CAVALRY). The introduction of field artillery may be\r\nattributed to John Zizka, and it was in his Hussite wars (1419-1424)\r\nthat the _Wagenburg_, a term of more general application, but taken here\r\nas denoting a cart or vehicle armed with several small guns, came into\r\nprominence. This device allowed a relatively high manoeuvring power to\r\nbe attained, and it is found occasionally in European wars two centuries\r\nlater, as for instance at Wimpfen in 1622 and Cropredy Bridge in 1644.\r\nIn an act of attainder passed by the Lancastrian party against the\r\nYorkists (1459), it is stated that the latter were \"traiterously ranged\r\nin bataill ... their cartes with gonnes set before their batailles\"\r\n(Rot. Parl. 38 Henry VI., v. 348). In the London fighting of 1460, small\r\nguns were used to clear the streets, heavy ordnance to batter the walls\r\nof the Tower. The battle of Lose Coat Field (1469) was decided almost\r\nentirely by Edward IV.'s field guns, while at Blackheath (1497) \"some\r\ncornets of horse, and bandes of foot, and good store of artillery\r\nwheeling about\" were sent to \"put themselves beyond\" the rebel camp\r\n(Bacon, _Henry VII._). The greatest example of artillery work in the\r\n15th century was the siege of Constantinople in 1453, at which the Turks\r\nused a large force of artillery, and in particular some monster pieces,\r\nsome of which survived to engage a British squadron in 1807, when a\r\nstone shot weighing some 700 lb. cut the mainmast of Admiral (Sir) J.T.\r\nDuckworth's flagship in two, and another killed and wounded sixty men.\r\nFor siege purposes the new weapon was indeed highly effective, and the\r\ncastles of rebellious barons were easily knocked to pieces by the prince\r\nwho owned, or succeeded in borrowing, a few pieces of ordnance (cf.\r\nCarlyle, _Frederick the Great_, book iii. chap. i.).\r\n\r\n3. _The 16th Century._--In the Italian wars waged by Charles VIII.,\r\nLouis XII. and Francis I. of France, artillery played a most conspicuous\r\npart, both in siege and field warfare. Indeed, cannon did excellent\r\nservice in the field before hand firearms attained any considerable\r\nimportance. At Ravenna (1512) and Marignan (1515) field artillery did\r\ngreat execution, and at the latter battle \"the French artillery played a\r\nnew and distinguished part, not only by protecting the centre of the\r\narmy from the charges of the Swiss phalanxes, and causing them excessive\r\nloss, but also by rapidly taking up such positions from time to time ...\r\nas enabled the guns to play upon the flanks of the attacking columns\"\r\n(Chesney, _Observations on Firearms_, 1852). In this connexion it must,\r\nhowever, be observed that, when the arquebus and other small arms became\r\nreally efficient (about 1525), less is heard of this small and handy\r\nfield artillery, which had hitherto been the only means of breaking up\r\nthe heavy masses of the hostile pikemen. We have seen that artillery was\r\nnot ignored in England; but, in view of the splendid and unique\r\nefficiency of the archers, there was no great opportunity of developing\r\nthe new arm. In the time of Henry VIII., the ordnance in use in the\r\nfield consisted in the main of heavy _culverins_ and other guns of\r\nposition, and of lighter field pieces, termed _sakers, falcons_, &c. It\r\nis to be noticed that already the lightest pieces had disappeared, the\r\nsmallest of the above being a 2-pounder. In the earlier days of field\r\nartillery, the artillery train was a miscellaneous congeries of pontoon,\r\nsupply, baggage and tool wagons, heavy ordnance and light guns in carts.\r\nWith the development of infantry fire the use of the last-named weapons\r\ndied out, and it is largely due to this fact that \"artillery\" came to\r\nimply cumbrous and immobile guns of position. Little is, therefore,\r\nheard of smart manoeuvring, such as that at Marignan, during the latter\r\npart of the 16th century. The guns now usually come into action in\r\nadvance of the troops, but, from their want of mobility, could neither\r\naccompany a farther advance nor protect a retreat, and they were\r\ngenerally captured and recaptured with every changing phase of the\r\nfight. Great progress was in the meanwhile made in the adaptation of\r\nordnance to the attack and defence of fortresses and, in particular,\r\nvertical fire came into vogue. A great Turkish gun, carrying a 600-lb.\r\nstone shot, was used in the siege of Constantinople, apparently in this\r\nway, since Gibbon records that at the range of a mile the shot buried\r\nitself a fathom deep in earth, a fact which implies that a high angle of\r\nelevation was given. In the celebrated siege of Malta in 1565 artillery\r\nplayed a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\n4. _The Thirty Years' War._--Such, in its broadest outlines, is the\r\nhistory of artillery work during the first three centuries of its\r\nexistence. Whilst the material had undergone a very considerable\r\nimprovement, the organization remained almost unchanged, and the\r\ntactical employment of guns had become restricted, owing to their\r\nslowness and difficulty of movement on the march and immobility in\r\naction. In wars of the type of the War of Dutch Independence and the\r\nearlier part of the Thirty Years' War, this heavy artillery naturally\r\nremained useful enough, and the _Wagenburg_ had given place to the\r\nmusketry initiated by the Spaniards at Bicocca and Pavia, which since\r\n1525 had steadily improved and developed. It is not, therefore, until\r\nthe appearance of a captain whose secret of success was vigour and\r\nmobility that the first serious attempt was made to produce field\r\nartillery in the proper sense of the word, that is, a gun of good power,\r\nand at the same time so mounted as to be capable of rapid movement. The\r\n\"carte with gonnes\" had been, as is the modern machine gun, a mechanical\r\nconcentration of musketry rather than a piece of artillery. Maurice of\r\nNassau, indeed, helped to develop the field gun, and the French had\r\ninvented the limber, but Gustavus Adolphus was the first to give\r\nartillery its true position on the battlefield. At the first battle of\r\nBreitenfeld (1631) Gustavus had twelve heavy and forty-two light guns\r\nengaged, as against Tilly's heavy 24-pounders, which were naturally far\r\ntoo cumbrous for field work. At the Lech (1632) Gustavus seems to have\r\nobtained a local superiority over his opponent owing to the handiness of\r\nhis field artillery even more than by its fire-power. At Lutzen (1632)\r\nhe had sixty guns to Wallenstein's twenty-one. His field pieces were not\r\nthe celebrated \"leather\" guns (which were indeed a mere makeshift used\r\nin Gustavus' Polish wars) but iron 4-pounders. These were distributed\r\namongst the infantry units, and thus began the system of \"battalion\r\nguns\" which survived in the armies of Europe long after the conditions\r\nrequiring it had vanished. The object of thus dispersing the guns was\r\ndoubtless to ensure in the first place more certain co-operation between\r\nthe two arms, and in the second to exercise a military supervision over\r\nthe lighter and more useful field pieces which it was as yet impossible\r\nto exercise over the _personnel_ of the heavy artillery.\r\n\r\n5. _Personnel and Classification._--More than 300 years after the first\r\nemployment of ordnance, the men working the guns and the transport\r\ndrivers were still civilians. The actual commander of the artillery was\r\nindeed, both in Germany and in England, usually a soldier, and Lennart\r\nTorstensson, the commander of Gustavus' artillery, became a brilliant\r\nand successful general. But the transport and the drivers were still\r\nhired, and even the gunners were chiefly concerned for the safety of\r\ntheir pieces, the latter being often the property, not of the king\r\nwaging war, but of some \"master gunner\" whose services he had secured,\r\nand the latter's apprentices were usually in entire charge of the\r\nmaterial. These civilian \"artists,\" as they were termed, owed no more\r\nduty to the prince than any other employes, and even Gustavus, it would\r\nappear, made no great improvement in the matter of the reorganization of\r\nartillery trains. Soldiers as drivers do not appear until 150 years\r\nlater, and in the meanwhile companies of \"firelocks\" and \"fusiliers\"\r\n(q.v.) came into existence, as much to prevent the gunners and drivers\r\nfrom running away as to protect them from the enemy. A further cause of\r\ndifficulties, in England at any rate, was the age of the \"gunners.\" In\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, some of the Tower gunners were over ninety years\r\nof age. Complaints as to the inefficiency of these men are frequent in\r\nthe years preceding the English Civil War. Gustavus, however, has the\r\nmerit of being the first to make the broad classification of artillery,\r\nas mobile or non-mobile, which has since been almost universally in\r\nforce. In his time the 12-pounder was the heaviest gun classed as\r\nmobile, and the \"feildpeece\" _par excellence_ was the 9-pounder or\r\n_demi-culverin_. After the death of Gustavus at Lutzen (1632), his\r\nprinciples came universally into practice, and amongst them were those\r\nof the employment of field artillery.\r\n\r\n6. _The English Civil War._--Even in the English Civil War (Great\r\nRebellion), in which artillery was hampered by the previous neglect of a\r\ncentury, its field work was not often contemptible, and on occasion the\r\narm did excellent service. But in the campaigns of this war, fought out\r\nby men whose most ardent desire was to decide the quarrel swiftly, the\r\nmarching and manoeuvring were unusually rapid. The consequence of this\r\nwas that the guns were sometimes either late in arriving, as at\r\nEdgehill, or absent altogether, as at Preston. The _role_ of guns was\r\nfurther reduced by the fact that there were few fortresses to be\r\nreduced, and country houses, however strong, rarely required to be\r\nbattered by a siege train. The New Model army usually sent for siege\r\nguns only when they were needed for particular service. On such\r\noccasions, indeed, the heavy ordnance did its work so quickly and\r\neffectually that the assault often took place one or two days after the\r\nguns had opened fire. Cromwell in his sieges made great use of shells,\r\n12-inch and even larger mortars being employed. The castle of Devizes,\r\nwhich had successfully resisted the Parliamentary battering guns,\r\nsuccumbed at once to vertical fire. It does not, however, appear certain\r\nthat there was any separation of field from siege ordnance, although the\r\nSwedish system was followed in almost all military matters.\r\n\r\n7. _Artillery Progress, 1660-1740._--Cromwell's practice of relegating\r\nheavy guns to the rear, except when a serious siege operation was in\r\nview, and in very rapid movements leaving even the field pieces far\r\nbehind, was followed to some extent in the campaigns of the age of Louis\r\nXIV. The number of ammunition wagons, and above all of horses, required\r\nfor each gun was four or five times as great as that required even for a\r\nmodern quick-firer. In the days of Turenne heavy guns were much\r\nemployed, as the campaigns of the French were directed as a rule to the\r\nmethodical conquest of territory and fortified towns. Similarly,\r\nMarlborough, working amidst the fortresses of the Netherlands in 1706,\r\nhad over 100 pieces of artillery (of which 60 were mortars) to a force\r\nof some 11,000 men, or about 9 pieces per 1000 men. On the other hand,\r\nin his celebrated march to the Danube in 1704, he had but few guns, and\r\nthe allied armies at Blenheim brought into the field only 1 piece per\r\n1000 men. At Oudenarde \"from the _rapidity of the march_ ... the battle\r\nwas fought with little aid from artillery on either side\" (Coxe,\r\n_Marlborough_). There was less need now than ever before for rapid\r\nmanoeuvres of mobile artillery, since the pike finally disappeared from\r\nthe scene about 1700, and infantry fire-power had become the decisive\r\nfactor in battles. In the meantime, artillery was gradually ceasing to\r\nbe the province of the skilled workman, and assuming its position as an\r\narm of the military service. In the 17th century, when armies were as a\r\nrule raised only \"for the war\" and disbanded at the conclusion of\r\nhostilities, there had been no very pressing need for the maintenance in\r\npeace of an expensive _personnel_ and material. Gunners therefore\r\nremained, as civilians, outside the regular administration of the\r\nforces, until the general adoption of the \"standing army\" principle in\r\nthe last years of the century (see ARMY). From this time steps were\r\ntaken, in all countries, to organize the artillery as a military force.\r\nAfter various attempts had been made, the \"Royal Regiment of Artillery\"\r\ncame into existence in England in 1716. It is, however, stated that the\r\nEnglish artillery did not \"begin to assume a military appearance until\r\nthe Flanders campaigns\" of the War of the Austrian Succession. Even in\r\nthe War of American Independence a dispute arose as to whether a general\r\nofficer, whose regimental service had been in the Royal Artillery, was\r\nentitled to command troops of all arms, and the artillery drivers were\r\nnot actually soldiers until 1793 at the earliest. French artillery\r\nofficers received military rank only in 1732.\r\n\r\n8. _Artillery in the Wars of Frederick the Great._--By the time of\r\nFrederick the Great's first wars, artillery had thus been divided into\r\n(a) those guns moving with an army in the field, and (b) those which\r\nwere either wholly stationary or were called upon only when a siege was\r\nexpected. The _personnel_ was gradually becoming more efficient and more\r\namenable to discipline; the transport arrangements, however, remained in\r\na backward state. Siege and fortress artillery was now organized and\r\nemployed in accordance with the system of the \"formal attack\" as finally\r\ndeveloped by Vauban. For details of this, as involving the tactical\r\nprocedure of artillery in the attack and defence of fortresses, the\r\nreader is referred to FORTIFICATION AND SIEGECRAFT. We are concerned\r\nhere more especially with the progress of field artillery. The part\r\nplayed by this arm began now to vary according to the circumstances of\r\neach action, and the \"moral\" support of guns was calculated as a factor\r\nin the dispositions. In the early Silesian wars, heavy or reserve guns\r\nprotected the deployment of the army and endeavoured to prepare for the\r\nsubsequent advance by firing upon the hostile troops; the battalion guns\r\nremained close to the infantry, accompanied its movements and assisted\r\nin the fire fight. Their support was not without value, and the heavy\r\nguns often provoked the enemy into a premature advance, as at Mollwitz.\r\nBut the infantry or the cavalry forced the decision. It has been\r\nmentioned that with the final disappearance of the pike, about 1700,\r\ninfantry fire-power ruled the battlefield. Throughout the 18th century,\r\nit will be found, when the infantry is equal to its work the guns have\r\nonly a subordinate part in the fighting of pitched battles. At\r\nKunersdorf (1759) the first dashing charge of the Prussian grenadiers\r\ncaptured 72 guns from the Russian army. Later the total of captured\r\nordnance reached 180, yet the Russians, then almost wholly in flight,\r\nwere not cut to pieces, for only a few light guns of the Prussian army\r\ncould get to the front; their heavy pieces, though twelve horses were\r\nharnessed to each, never came into action. This example will serve to\r\nillustrate the difference between the artillery of 1760 and that of\r\nfifty years later. According to Tempelhof, who was present, Kunersdorf\r\nwas the finest opportunity for field artillery that he had ever seen.\r\nYet the field artillery of the 18th century was, if anything, more\r\npowerful than that of Napoleon's time; it was the want of mobility alone\r\nwhich prevented the Prussians from turning to good account an\r\nopportunity fully as favourable as that of the German artillery at\r\nSedan. That Frederick made more use of his guns in the later campaigns\r\nof the Seven Years' War is accounted for by the fact that his infantry\r\nand cavalry were no longer capable of forcing a decision, and also by\r\nchanges in the general character of the operations. These were fought in\r\nand about broken country and entrenched positions, and the mobility of\r\nthe other arms sank to that of the artillery. Thus power came to the\r\nfront again, and the heavier weapons regained their former supremacy. In\r\na _bataille rangee_ in the open field the proportion of guns to men had\r\nbeen, in 1741, 2 per 1000. At Leuthen (1757) heavy fortress guns were\r\nbrought to the front for a special purpose. At Kunersdorf the proportion\r\nwas 4 and 5 per 1000 men, with what degree of effectiveness we have\r\nseen. In the later campaigns the Austrian artillery, which was,\r\nthroughout the Seven Years' War, the best in Europe, placed its numerous\r\nand powerful ordnance (an \"amphitheatre of 400 guns,\" as Frederick said)\r\nin long lines of field works. The combination of guns and obstacles was\r\nalmost invariably too formidable to offer the slightest chance of a\r\nsuccessful assault. It was at this stage that Frederick, in 1759,\r\nintroduced horse artillery to keep pace with the movements of cavalry, a\r\nproof, if proof were needed, of the inability of the field artillery to\r\nmanoeuvre. The field howitzer, the weapon _par excellence_ for the\r\nattack of field works, has never perhaps been more extensively employed\r\nthan it was by the Prussians at that time. At Burkersdorf (1762)\r\nFrederick placed 45 howitzers in one battery. In those days the mobile\r\nartillery was always formed in groups or \"batteries\" of from 10 to 20\r\npieces. England too was certainly abreast of other countries in the\r\norganization of the field artillery arm. About the middle of the 18th\r\ncentury the guns in use consisted of 24-pounders, 12-pounders,\r\n6-pounders and 3-pounders. The guns were divided into \"brigades\" of\r\nfour, five and six guns respectively, and began to be separated into\r\n\"heavy\" and \"light\" brigades. Each field gun was drawn by four horses,\r\nthe two leaders being ridden by artillerymen, and had 100 rounds of shot\r\nand 30 rounds of grape. The British artillery distinguished itself in\r\nthe latter part of the Seven Years' War. Foreign critics praised its\r\nlightness, its elegance and the good quality of its materials. At\r\nMarburg (1760) \"the English artillery could not have been better served;\r\nit followed the enemy with such vivacity, and maintained its fire so\r\nwell, that it was impossible for the latter to re-form,\" says Tempelhof,\r\nthe Prussian artillery officer who records the lost opportunity of\r\nKunersdorf. The merits and the faults of the artillery had been made\r\nclear, and nowhere was the lesson taken to heart more than in France,\r\nwhere General Gribeauval, a French officer who had served in the war\r\nwith the Austrian artillery, initiated reforms which in the end led to\r\nthe artillery triumphs of the Napoleonic era. While Frederick had\r\nendeavoured to employ, as profitably as possible, the existing heavy\r\nequipments, Gribeauval sought improvement in other directions.\r\n\r\n9. _Gribeauval's Reforms._--At the commencement of the 18th century,\r\nFrench artillery had made but little progress. The carriages and wagons\r\nwere driven by wagoners on foot, and on the field of battle the guns\r\nwere dragged about by ropes or remained stationary. Towards the middle\r\nof the century some improvements were made. Field guns and carriages\r\nwere lightened, and the guns separated into brigades. Siege carriages\r\nwere introduced. From 1765 onwards, however, Gribeauval strove to build\r\nup a complete system both of _personnel_ and _materiel_, creating a\r\ndistinct _materiel_ for field, siege, garrison and coast artillery.\r\nAlive to the vital importance of mobility for field artillery, he\r\ndismissed to other branches all pieces of greater calibre than\r\n12-pounders, and reduced the weight of those retained. His reforms were\r\nresisted, and for a time successfully; but in 1776 he became first\r\ninspector-general of artillery, and was able to put his ideas into\r\nforce. The field artillery of the new system included 4-pounder\r\nregimental guns, and for the reserve 8- and 12-pounders, with 6-inch\r\nhowitzers. For siege and garrison service Gribeauval adopted the\r\n16-pounder and 12-pounder guns, 8-inch howitzer and 10-inch mortar, 12-,\r\n10- and 8-inch mortars being introduced in 1785.\r\n\r\nThe carriages were constructed on a uniform model and technically\r\nimproved. The horses were harnessed in pairs, instead of in file as\r\nformerly, but the manner in which the teams were driven remained much\r\nthe same. The _prolong_ (a sort of tow-rope) was introduced, to unite\r\nthe trail of the gun and the limber in slow retiring movements. Siege\r\ncarriages differed from those of field artillery only in details.\r\nGribeauval also introduced new carriages for garrison and coast service.\r\nThe great step made was in a uniform construction being adopted for all\r\n_materiel_, and in making the parts interchangeable so far as possible.\r\nIn 1765 the _personnel_ of the French artillery was reorganized. The\r\ncorps or reserve artillery was organized in divisions of eight guns. The\r\nbattery or division was thus made a unit, with guns, munitions and\r\ngunners complete, the horses and drivers being added at a later date.\r\nHorse artillery was introduced into the French army in 1791. The last\r\nstep was made in 1800, when the establishment of a driver corps of\r\nsoldiers put an end to the old system of horsing by contract.\r\n\r\n10. _British Artillery, 1793-1815._--Meanwhile the numbers of the\r\nEnglish artillery had increased to nearly 4000 men. For some five\r\ncenturies the word \"artillery\" in England meant entirely garrison\r\nartillery; the field artillery only existed in time of war. When war\r\nbroke out, a train of artillery was organized, consisting of a certain\r\nnumber of field (or siege) guns, manned by garrison gunners; and when\r\npeace was proclaimed the train was disbanded, the _materiel_ being\r\nreturned into store, and the gunners reverting to some fort or\r\nstronghold. In 1793 the British artillery was anything but efficient.\r\nGuns were still dispersed among the infantry, mobility had declined\r\nagain since the Seven Years' War, and the American war had been fought\r\nout by the other arms. The drivers were mere carters on foot with long\r\nwhips, and the whole field equipment was scarcely able to break from a\r\nfoot-pace. Prior to the Peninsular War, however, the exertions of an\r\nable officer, Major Spearman, had done much to bring about improvement.\r\nHorse artillery had been introduced in 1793, and the driver corps\r\nestablished in 1794. Battalion guns were abolished in 1802, and field\r\n\"brigades of six guns\" were formed, horse artillery batteries being\r\nstyled \"troops.\" Military drivers were introduced, and the horses teamed\r\nin pairs. The drivers were mounted on the near horses, the gunners\r\neither rode the off horses or were carried on the limbers and wagons.\r\nThe equipment was lightened, and a new system of manoeuvres introduced.\r\nA troop of horse artillery and a field brigade each had five guns and\r\none howitzer. The \"driver corps,\" raised in 1794, was divided into\r\ntroops, the addition of one of which to a company of foot artillery\r\nconverted it into a field brigade. The horse artillery possessed both\r\ndrivers and horses, and required very limited assistance from the driver\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\n11. _French Revolutionary Wars._--During the long wars of the French\r\nRevolution and Empire the artillery of the field army by degrees became\r\nfield artillery as we know it to-day. The development of musketry in the\r\n16th century had taken the work of preparing an assault out of the hands\r\nof the gunners. _Per contra_, the decadence of infantry fire-power in\r\nthe latter part of the Seven Years' War had reinstated the artillery\r\narm. A similar decadence of the infantry arm was destined to produce, in\r\n1807, artillery predominance, but this time with an important\r\ndifference, viz. _mobility_, and when mobility is thus achieved we have\r\nthe first modern field artillery. The new tactics of the French in the\r\nRevolutionary wars, forced upon them by circumstances, involved an\r\nalmost complete abandonment of the fire-tactics of Frederick's day, and\r\nthe need for artillery was, from the first fight at Valmy onwards, so\r\nobvious that its moral support was demanded even in the outpost line of\r\nthe new French armies. St Cyr (_Armies of the Rhine_, p. 112) quotes a\r\ncase in which \"right in the very farthest outpost line\" the original\r\n4-pounder guns were replaced by 8-, 16-, and in the end by 24-pounders.\r\nThe cardinal principle of massing batteries was not, indeed, forgotten,\r\nnotwithstanding the weakness of raw levies. But though, as we have seen,\r\nthe _materiel_ had already been greatly improved, and the artillery was\r\nless affected by the Revolution than other arms of the service,\r\ncircumstances were against it, and we rarely find examples of artillery\r\nwork in the Revolutionary wars which show any great improvement upon\r\nolder methods. The field guns were however, at last organized in\r\nbatteries each complete in itself, as mentioned above. The battalion gun\r\ndisappeared; it was a relic of days in which it was thought advisable,\r\nboth for other reasons and also because the short range of guns forbade\r\nany attempt at concentration of fire from several positions at one\r\ntarget, to have some force of artillery at any point that might be\r\nthreatened. Though it was officially retained in the regulations of the\r\nFrench army, \"officers and men combined to reject it\" (Rouquerol, _Q.F.\r\nField Artillery_, p. 121), and its last appearances, in 1809 and in\r\n1813, were due merely to an endeavour on the part of Napoleon to give\r\ncohesion thereby to the battalions of raw soldiers which then\r\nconstituted his army. But, with the development of mobility, it was\r\nprobably found that sufficient guns could be taken to any threatened\r\npoint, and no one had ever denied the principle of massed batteries,\r\nalthough, in practice, dispersion had been thought to be unavoidable.\r\n\r\n12. _Napoleon's Artillery Tactics._--During the war the French artillery\r\nsteadily improved in manoeuvring power. But many years elapsed before\r\nperfection was attained. Meanwhile, the infantry, handled without regard\r\nto losses in every fight, had in consequence deteriorated. The final\r\nproduction of the field artillery battle, usually dated as from the\r\nbattle of Friedland (June 14, 1807), therefore saved the situation for\r\nthe French. Henceforward Napoleon's battles depend for their success on\r\nan \"artillery preparation,\" the like of which had never been seen.\r\nNapoleon's own maxim illustrates the typical tactics of 1807-1815. \"When\r\nonce the _melee_ has begun,\" he says, \"the man who is clever enough to\r\nbring up an unexpected force of artillery, without the enemy knowing it,\r\nis sure to carry the day.\" The guns no longer \"prepared\" the infantry\r\nadvance by slowly disintegrating the hostile forces. Still less was it\r\ntheir business merely to cover a deployment. On the contrary, they now\r\nwent in to the closest ranges and, by actually _annihilating_ a portion\r\nof the enemy's line with case-shot fire, \"covered\" the assault so\r\neffectively that columns of cavalry and infantry reached the gap thus\r\ncreated without striking a blow. It is unnecessary to give examples.\r\nEvery one of Napoleon's later battles illustrates the principle. The\r\nmost famous case is that of the great battery of 100 guns at Wagram\r\n(q.v.) which preceded the final attack of the centre. When Napoleon at\r\nLeipzig saw the allied guns forming up in long lines to prepare the\r\nassault, he exclaimed, \"At last they have learned something.\" This\r\n\"case-shot preparation,\" of course, involved a high degree of efficiency\r\nin manoeuvre, as the guns had to gallop forward far in front of the\r\ninfantry. The want of this quality had retarded the development of field\r\nartillery for 300 years, during which it had only been important\r\nrelatively to the occasional inferiority of other troops. After\r\nNapoleon's time the art of tactics became the art of _combining the\r\nthree arms_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n  FIGS. 1 and 2.--15th Century Field Artillery (Napoleon III).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.--Field Artillery. 1525 (Napoleon III).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.--French Artillery 1735 (_Journal d'Armee_,1835).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.--French Field Artillery,1835 (_Journal d'Armee_,1835).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.--Artillery in Action, Roveredo, 1796 (C.

FIELD ARTILLERY MANOEUVRING.\r\n  _Photo, Topical Press._]\r\n\r\n13. _Artillery, 1815-1865._--Henceforward, therefore, the history of\r\nartillery becomes the history of its technical effectiveness,\r\nparticularly in relation to infantry fire, and of improvements or\r\nmodifications in the method of putting well-recognized principles into\r\naction. Infantry fire, however, being more variable in its effectiveness\r\nthan that of artillery, the period 1815-1870 saw many changes in the\r\nrelations of the two arms. In the time of Napoleon, infantry fire never\r\nequalled that of the Seven Years' War, and after the period of the great\r\nwars the musket was less and less effectively used. Economy was,\r\nhowever, practised to excess in every army of Europe during the period\r\n1815-1850, and even if there had been great battles at this time, the\r\nartillery, which was maintained on a minimum strength of guns, men and\r\nhorses, would not have repeated the exploits of Senarmont and Drouot in\r\nthe Napoleonic wars. The principle was well understood, but under such\r\nconditions the practice was impossible. It was at this stage that the\r\ngeneral introduction of the rifled musket put an end, once for all,\r\nto the artillery tactics of the smooth-bore days. Infantry, armed with a\r\nfar-ranging rifle, as in the American Civil War, kept the guns beyond\r\ncase-shot range, compelling them to use only round shot or common shell.\r\nIn that war, therefore, attacking infantry met, on reaching close\r\nquarters, not regiments already broken by a _feu d'enfer_, but the full\r\nforce of the defenders' artillery and infantry, both arms fresh and\r\nunshaken, and the full volume of their case shot and musketry. At\r\nFredericksburg the Federal infantry attacked, unsupported by a single\r\nfield piece; at Gettysburg the Federal artillery general Hunt was able\r\nto reserve his ammunition to meet Lee's assault, although the infantry\r\nof his own side was meanwhile subjected to the fire of 137 Confederate\r\nguns. Thus, in both these cases the assault became one of infantry\r\nagainst unshaken infantry and artillery. On many occasions, indeed, the\r\nbatteries on either side went into close ranges, as the traditions of\r\nthe old United States army dictated, but their losses were then totally\r\nout of proportion to their effectiveness. Indeed, the increased range at\r\nwhich battles were now fought, and the ineffectiveness of the\r\nprojectiles necessarily used by the artillery at these ranges, so far\r\nneutralized even rifled guns that artillery generals could speak of\r\n\"idle cannonades\" as the \"besetting sin\" of some commanders.\r\n\r\n14. _The Franco-German War, 1870-71._--In the next great war, that of\r\n1866 (Bohemia), guns were present on both sides in great numbers, the\r\naverage for both sides being three guns per 1000 men. Artillery,\r\nhowever, played but a small part in the Prussian attacks, this being due\r\nto the inadequate training then afforded, and also to the mixture of\r\nrifled guns and smooth-bores in their armament. In Prussia, however, the\r\nexertions of General v. Hindersin, the improvement of the _materiel_,\r\nand above all the better tactical training of the batteries, were\r\nrewarded four years later by success on the battlefield almost as\r\ndecisive as Napoleon's. In 1870 the French artillery was invariably\r\ndefeated by that of the Germans, who were then free to turn their\r\nattention to the hostile infantry. At first, indeed, the German infantry\r\nwas too impatient to wait until the victorious artillery had prepared\r\nthe way for them by disintegrating the opposing line of riflemen. Thus\r\nthe attack of the Prussian Guards at St Privat (August 18, 1870) melted\r\naway before the unbroken fire-power of the French, as had that of the\r\nFederals at Fredericksburg and that of the Confederates at Gettysburg.\r\nBut such experiences taught the German infantry commanders the necessity\r\nof patience, and at Sedan the French army was enveloped by the fire of\r\nnearly 600 guns, which did their work so thoroughly that the Germans\r\nannihilated the Imperial army at the cost of only 5% of casualties.\r\n\r\n15. _Results of the War._--The tactical lessons of the war, so far as\r\nfield artillery is concerned, may be briefly summarized as (a)\r\nemployment of great masses of guns; (b) forward position of guns in the\r\norder of march, in order to bring them into action as quickly as\r\npossible; (c) the so-called \"artillery duel,\" in which the assailant\r\nsubdues the enemy's artillery fire; and (d) when this is achieved, and\r\nnot before, the thorough preparation of all infantry attacks by\r\nartillery bombardment. This theory of field artillery action has not,\r\neven with the almost revolutionary improvements of the present period,\r\nentirely lost its value, and it may be studied in detail in the\r\nwell-known work of von Schell, _Taktik der Feldartillerie_ (1877), later\r\ntranslated into English by Major-General Sir A.E. Turner (_Tactics of\r\nField Artillery_, 1900). In one important matter, however, the precepts\r\nof Schell and his contemporaries no longer hold good. \"It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the object of the infantry's attack should be cannonaded\r\nbefore it advances. To accomplish this, sufficient time should be given\r\nto the artillery, and on no account should the infantry be ordered to\r\nadvance until the fire of the guns has produced the desired effect.\"\r\nThis, the direct outcome of the slaughter at St Privat, represents the\r\nbest possibilities of breech-loading guns with common shell--no more\r\nthan a slow disintegration of the enemy's power of resistance by a\r\nthorough and lengthy \"artillery preparation.\" Against troops sheltered\r\nbehind works (as in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78) the common shell\r\nusually failed to give satisfactory results, if for no other reason,\r\nbecause the \"preparation\" consumed an inordinate time, and in any case\r\nthe hostile artillery had first of all to be subdued in the artillery\r\nduel.\r\n\r\n16. _Quick-firing Field Guns._--In 1891, a work by General Wille of the\r\nGerman army (_The Field Gun of the Future_) and in 1892 another by\r\nColonel Langlois of the French service (_Field Artillery with the other\r\nArms_) foreshadowed many revolutionary changes in _materiel_ and tactics\r\nwhich have now taken place. The new ideas spread rapidly, and the\r\nquick-firing gun came by degrees to be used in every army. The original\r\ndesigns have been greatly improved upon (see ORDNANCE: _Field artillery\r\nequipments_), but the principles of these designs have not undergone\r\nserious modification. These are, briefly, the mechanical absorption of\r\nthe recoil, by means of brakes or buffers, and the development of \"time\r\nshrapnel\" as the projectile of field artillery. The absorption of recoil\r\nof itself permits of a higher rate of fire, since the gun does not\r\nrequire to be run up and relaid after every shot. Formerly such an\r\nadvantage was illusory (since aim could not be taken through the thick\r\nbank of smoke produced by rapid fire), but the introduction of smokeless\r\npowder removed this objection. Artillerists, no longer handicapped, at\r\nonce turned their attention to the increase of the rate of fire. At the\r\nsame time a shield was applied to the gun, for the protection of the\r\ndetachment. This advantage is solely the result of the non-recoiling\r\ncarriage. The gunners had formerly to stand clear of the recoiling gun,\r\nand a shield was therefore of but slight value.\r\n\r\n17. _Time Shrapnel._--The power of modern artillery owes even more to\r\nthe improvement of the projectile than to that of the gun (see\r\nAMMUNITION). The French, always in the forefront of artillery progress,\r\nwere the first nation to realize the new significance of the time-fuze\r\nand the shrapnel shell. These had been in existence for many years; to\r\nthe British army are due both the invention and the development of the\r\nshrapnel, which made its first appearance in European warfare at Vimeira\r\nin 1808. But, up to the introduction of rifled pieces, the Napoleonic\r\ncase-shot attack was universally and justly considered the best method\r\nof fighting, and in the transition stage of the _materiel_ many soldiers\r\ncontinued to put faith in the old method,--hence the Prussian artillery\r\nin 1866 had many smooth-bore batteries in the field,--and between 1860\r\nand 1870 gunners, now convinced of the superiority of the new\r\nequipments, undoubtedly sought to turn to account the minute accuracy of\r\nthe rifled weapons in unnecessarily fine shooting. Thus, in 1870 the\r\nFrench time-fuze was only graduated for two ranges, and the Germans used\r\npercussion fuzes only. But this phase has passed, and General Langlois\r\nhas summarized the tactics of the newest field artillery in one phrase:\r\n\"It results in transferring to 3000 yds. the point-blank and case-shot\r\nfire of the smooth-bore.\" The meaning of this will be discussed later;\r\nhere it will be sufficient to say that it is claimed for the modern gun\r\nand the modern shell that the Napoleonic method[1] of annihilating by a\r\nrain of bullets has been revived, with the distinction that the shell,\r\nand not the gun, fires the bullets close up to the enemy. In the Boer\r\nWar, Pieter's Hill furnished a notable example of this \"covering,\" as\r\ndistinct from \"preparation,\" of an assault by artillery fire.\r\n\r\n18. _Heavy Field, Siege and Garrison Artillery._--Amongst other results\r\nof this war was a recrudescence of the idea of \"dispersion.\" This will\r\nbe noticed later; the more material result of the Boer War, and of the\r\ngenerally increasing specialization in the various functions of the\r\nartillery arm, has been the reintroduction of heavy ordnance into field\r\narmies. The field howitzer reappeared some time before the outbreak of\r\nthat war, and the British howitzers had illustrated their shell-power in\r\nthe Sudan campaign of 1898. During the latter part of the 19th century,\r\nsiege and fortress artillery underwent a development hardly less\r\nremarkable than that of field artillery in the same time. Rifled guns,\r\n\"long\" and \"short\" for direct and curved fire, formed the siege\r\nartillery of the Germans in 1870-71, and with the reduction of the\r\nold-fashioned fortresses of France began a new era in siegecraft (see\r\nFORTIFICATION AND SIEGECRAFT). At the present time howitzers[2] (B.L.\r\nrifled) are the principal siege weapons, while heavy direct-fire guns\r\n(see ORDNANCE _passim_) still retain a part of the work formerly\r\nassigned to the artillery of the attack. For an account of a siege with\r\nmodern artillery see Macalik and Langer, _Kampf um eine Festung_, which\r\ndescribes an imaginary siege of Koniggratz. On the whole, it may be said\r\nthat modern artillery has caused a revolution in methods of\r\nfortification and siegecraft, which is little less far-reaching than the\r\noriginal change from the trebuchet to the bombard.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n19. _Field Artillery Organization._--A _battery_ of field artillery\r\ncomprises three elements, viz. _materiel_,--guns, carriages, ammunition\r\nand stores; _personnel_,--officers, non-commissioned officers, gunners,\r\ndrivers and artificers; and _transport_,--almost invariably horses,\r\nthough other animals, and also motor and mechanical transport, are used\r\nunder special circumstances. As for the _materiel_, the guns used by\r\nfield artillery in almost all countries are quick-firers, throwing\r\nshells of 13 to 18 pounds; details of these will be found in the article\r\nORDNANCE. The number of guns in a battery varies in different countries\r\nbetween four and eight; by far the most usual number is six. With the\r\nintroduction of the quick-firing gun, the tendency towards small\r\nbatteries (of four guns) has become very pronounced, the ruling motives\r\nbeing (a) better control of fire in action, and (b) more horses\r\navailable to draw the increased number of ammunition wagons required.\r\n\"Mixed\" batteries of guns and howitzers were formerly employed on\r\noccasion, and were supposed to be adapted to every kind of work.\r\nHowever, the difference between the gun and the howitzer was so great\r\nthat at all times one part of the armament was idle, while the general\r\nincrease in the artillery arm has permitted batteries and brigades of\r\nhowitzers to be formed, separately, as required. Machine guns (q.v.) are\r\nnot treated in Great Britain as being artillery weapons, though abroad\r\nthey are often organized in batteries. During, and subsequent to the\r\nBoer War, heavier machine guns, called pompoms, came into use. The\r\nrocket (q.v.), formerly a common weapon of the artillery, is now used,\r\nif at all, only for mountain and forest warfare against savages.\r\n\r\n20. _Ammunition._--The vehicles of a battery include (besides guns and\r\nlimbers) ammunition wagons, store and provision carts or wagons and\r\nforage wagons. On the amount of ammunition that should be carried with a\r\nfield battery there was formerly a considerable diversity of opinion.\r\nThe greater the amount a battery carries with it, the more independent\r\nit is; on the other hand, every additional wagon makes the battery more\r\ncumbrous and, by lengthening out the column, keeps back the combatant\r\ntroops marching in rear. But since the introduction of the Q.F. gun it\r\nhas been universally recognized that the gun must have a very liberal\r\nsupply of ammunition present with it in action, and the old standard\r\nallowance of one wagon per gun has been increased to that of two and\r\neven three. Formerly batteries were further hampered by having to carry\r\nthe reserve of small-arm ammunition for infantry and cavalry. But the\r\ngreater distances of modern warfare accentuate the difficulties of such\r\na system, and the reserve ammunition for all arms is now carried in\r\nspecial \"ammunition columns\" (see AMMUNITION), the _personnel_ and\r\ntransport of which is furnished by the artillery.\r\n\r\n21. _Interior Economy._--The organization and interior economy of a\r\nbattery is much the same in all field artillery. In England the command\r\nis held by a major, the second in command is a captain. The battery is\r\ndivided into three \"sections\" of two guns each, each under a subaltern\r\nofficer, who is responsible for everything connected with his\r\nsection--men, horses, guns, carriages, ammunition and stores. Each\r\nsection again consists of two sub-sections, each comprising one gun and\r\nits wagons, men and horses, and at the head of each is the \"No. 1\" of\r\nthe gun detachment--usually a sergeant--who is immediately responsible\r\nto the section commander for his sub-section.\r\n\r\nThe No. 1 rides with the gun, there is also another mounted\r\nnon-commissioned officer who rides with the first wagon, and the gunners\r\nare seated on the gun-carriage, wagon and limbers. The increased number\r\nof wagons now accompanying the gun has, however, given more seating\r\naccommodation to the detachment, and this distribution has in some cases\r\nbeen altered. The three drivers ride the near horses of their respective\r\npairs, each gun and each wagon being drawn by six horses. On the march,\r\nthe gun is attached to the limber, a two-wheeled carriage drawn by the\r\ngun team; the wagon consists likewise of a \"body\" and a limber. A\r\nbattery has also a number of non-combatant carriages, such as forge and\r\nbaggage wagons. In addition to the gunners and drivers, there are men\r\nspecially trained in range-taking, signalling, &c., in all batteries.\r\n\r\n22. _Special Natures of Field Artillery._--_Horse Artillery_ differs\r\nfrom field in that the whole gun detachment is mounted, and the gun and\r\nwagon therefore are freed from the load of men and their equipment. The\r\norganization of a battery of horse artillery differs but slightly from\r\nthat of a field battery; it is somewhat stronger in rank and file, as\r\nhorse-holders have to be provided for the gunners in action. Horse\r\nartillery is often lightened, moreover, by sacrificing power (see\r\nORDNANCE). The essential feature of _Mountain Artillery_ in general is\r\nthe carrying of the whole equipment on the backs of mules or other\r\nanimals. The total weight is usually distributed in four or five\r\nmule-loads. For action the loads are lifted off the saddles and\r\n\"assembled,\" and the time required to do this is, in well-trained\r\nbatteries, only one minute. For the technical questions connected with\r\nthe gun and its carriage, see ORDNANCE. The weight of a shell in a\r\nmountain gun rarely exceeds 12 lb., and is usually less. In most armies\r\nthe _field howitzer_ has, after an eclipse of many years, reasserted its\r\nplace. The weapons used are B.L. or Q.F. howitzers on field carriages;\r\nthe calibre varies from about 4 to 5 in. In Great Britain the field\r\nhowitzer batteries are organized as, and form part of, the Royal Field\r\nArtillery, two batteries of six howitzers each forming a brigade.\r\n\r\n23. _Heavy Ordnance._--_Heavy Field Artillery_, officially defined as\r\n\"all artillery equipped with mobile guns of 4-in. calibre and upwards,\"\r\nis usually composed, in Great Britain, of 5-in. or 4.7-in. Q.F. guns on\r\nfield carriages. 6-in. Q.F. guns have also been used. A battery (4 guns)\r\nis attached to the divisional artillery of each division, a company of\r\nthe Royal Garrison Artillery furnishing the _personnel_. The four guns\r\nare divided into two sections, each section under an officer and each\r\nsubsection under a non-commissioned officer, as in the horse and field\r\nbatteries. _Siege_ and _garrison artillery_ have not usually the\r\ncomplete and permanent organization that distinguishes field artillery.\r\nFor siege trains the _materiel_ is usually kept in store, and the\r\n_personnel_ and transport are supplied from other sources according to\r\nrequirement. In garrison artillery, the guns mounted in fortresses and\r\nbatteries, or stored in arsenals for the purpose, furnish the\r\n_materiel_, and the companies of garrison artillery the _personnel_. In\r\nGreat Britain, the Royal Garrison Artillery finds the mountain batteries\r\nand the heavy field artillery in addition to its own units. The siege\r\ntrains are, as has been said, organized _ad hoc_ on each particular\r\noccasion (see FORTIFICATION AND SIEGECRAFT). In Great Britain, the guns\r\nand howitzers manned by the R.G.A. would be 6-in. and 8-in. howitzers,\r\n4.7-in. and 6-in. guns, and still heavier howitzers, as well as the\r\nfield and heavy batteries belonging to the divisions making the siege.\r\n\r\n24. _Higher Organization of Artillery._--The higher units, in almost\r\nevery country except Great Britain, are the regiment, and, sometimes,\r\nthe brigade of two or more regiments. These units are distributed to\r\narmy corps, divisions and districts, in the same way as units of other\r\narms (see ARMY). In Great Britain the Royal Regiment of Artillery still\r\ncomprises the whole _personnel_ of the arm, being divided into the Royal\r\nHorse, Royal Field and Royal Garrison Artillery; to each branch Special\r\nReserve and Territorial artillery are affiliated. Over and above the\r\nmilitary command of these higher units, provision is usually made for\r\ntechnical control of the _materiel_, and a variety of training and\r\nexperimental establishments, such as schools of gunnery, are maintained\r\nin all countries. The more special unit of organization in mobile\r\nartillery is the _brigade_, formerly called brigade-division (German,\r\n_Abteilung_; French _groupe_). The brigade is in Great Britain the\r\nadministrative and tactical unit. Mountain artillery is not organized in\r\nbrigades in the British empire. The unit consists, in the case of guns,\r\nof three batteries (18 guns, heavy artillery 12), in the case of field\r\nhowitzers of two batteries (12 howitzers), and in the horse artillery of\r\ntwo batteries (12 guns), and is commanded by a lieutenant-colonel. To\r\neach brigade is allotted an ammunition column. The necessity for such a\r\ngrouping of batteries will be apparent if the reader notes that 54 field\r\nguns, 12 howitzers and 4 heavy field guns form the artillery of a single\r\nBritish division of about 15,000 combatants.\r\n\r\n25. _Grouping of the Artillery._--The \"corps artillery\" (formerly the\r\n\"reserve artillery\") now consists only of the howitzer and heavy\r\nbrigades, with a brigade of horse artillery. The latter is held at the\r\ndisposal of the corps commander for the swift reinforcement of a\r\nthreatened point; the howitzers and the heavy guns have, of course,\r\nfunctions widely different from those of the mass of guns. As the field\r\nartillery is required to come into action at the earliest possible\r\nmoment, it has now been distributed amongst the infantry divisions, and\r\nmarches almost at the head of the various combatant columns, instead of\r\nbeing relegated perhaps to the tail of the centre column. The\r\nredistribution of the British army (1907) on a divisional basis is a\r\nremarkable example of this; even the special natures of artillery\r\n(except horse artillery) are distributed amongst the divisions. In\r\nGermany two \"regiments\" (each of 2 _Abteilungen_ = 6 batteries) form a\r\nbrigade, under an artillery general in each division who thus disposes\r\nof 72 field guns, and the howitzers, with such horse artillery batteries\r\nas remain over after the cavalry has been supplied, still form a corps\r\nor reserve artillery. In 1903 the French, after long hesitation,\r\nassigned the whole of the field artillery to the various divisions, but\r\nlater (for reasons stated in the article TACTICS) arranged to\r\nreconstitute the old-fashioned corps artillery in war. (See also ARMY, S\r\n49).\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL WORK\r\n\r\n26. _General Characteristics of Field Artillery Action._--The duty of\r\nfield artillery in action is to fire with the greatest effect on the\r\ntarget which is for the moment of the greatest tactical importance. This\r\ndefinition of field artillery tactics brings the student at once to\r\nquestions of combined tactics, for which consult the article TACTICS.\r\nThe purpose of the present article is to indicate the methods employed\r\nby the gunners to give effect to their fire at the targets mentioned.\r\nFor this purpose the artillery has at its disposal two types of\r\nprojectile, common (or rather, high explosive) shell and shrapnel, and\r\ntwo fuzes, \"time\" and \"percussion\" (see AMMUNITION). The actual process\r\nof coming into action may be described in a few words. The gun is, at or\r\nnear its position in action, \"unlimbered\" and the gun limber and team\r\nsent back under cover. Ammunition for the gun is first taken from the\r\nwagon that accompanies it, as it is very desirable to keep the limbers\r\nfull as long as possible, in case of emergencies such as that of a\r\ntemporary separation from the wagon. Limber supply is, however, allowed\r\nin certain circumstances. The wagon is now placed as a rule by the side\r\nof the gun, an arrangement which immensely simplifies the supply of\r\nammunition, this being done under cover of the armour on the wagon and\r\nof the gun-shield and also without fatigue to the men. The older method\r\nof placing the wagon at some distance behind the gun is still\r\noccasionally used, especially in the case of unshielded equipments. No\r\nhorses are allowed, in any case, to be actually with the line of guns.\r\nAccording to the British _Field Artillery Training_ of 1906, a battery\r\nin action would be thus distributed: first, the \"fighting battery\"\r\nconsisting of the six guns, each with its wagon alongside, and the\r\nlimbers of the two flank guns; then, under cover in rear, the \"first\r\nline of wagons\" comprising the teams of the fighting battery, the four\r\nremaining gun limbers, and six more wagons. The non-combatant vehicles\r\nform the \"second line of wagons.\"\r\n\r\n27. _Occupation of a Position._--This depends primarily upon\r\nconsiderations of tactics, for the accurate co-operation of the guns is\r\nthe first essential to success in the general task. In details, however,\r\nthe choice of position varies to some extent with the nature of the\r\nequipment: for instance, an elevated position is better adapted than a\r\nlow one for high velocity guns firing over the heads of their own\r\ninfantry, and again, the \"spade\" with which nearly all equipments are\r\nfurnished (see ORDNANCE) should have soil in which it can find a hold.\r\nCover for the gun and its detachment cannot well be obtained from the\r\nconfiguration of the ground, because, if the gun can shoot over the\r\ncovering mass of earth, the hostile shells can of course do likewise.\r\nSufficient protection is given by the shield, and thus \"cover\" for\r\nfield-guns simply means concealment. Cover for the \"first line of\r\nwagons\" is, however, a very serious consideration. As to concealment, it\r\nis stated that \"the broad white flash from a gun firing smokeless powder\r\nis visible\" to an enemy \"unless the muzzle is at least 10 ft. below the\r\ncovering crest\" (Bethell, _Modern Guns and Gunnery_, 1907, p. 147).\r\nConcealment therefore, means only the skilful use of ground in such a\r\nway as to make the enemy's ranging difficult. This frequently involves\r\nthe use of retired positions, on reverse slopes, in low ground, &c., and\r\nin all modern artillery the greatest stress is laid on practice in\r\nfiring by indirect means. Controversy has, however, arisen as to whether\r\ninability to see the foreground is not a drawback so serious that direct\r\nfire from a crest position, in spite of its exposure, must be taken as\r\nthe normal method. The latter is of course immensely facilitated by the\r\nintroduction of the shield. A great advantage of retired positions is\r\nthat, provided unity of direction is kept, an overwhelming artillery\r\nsurprise (see _F.A. Training_, 1906, p. 225) is carried out more easily\r\nthan from a visible position. The extent of _front_ of a battery in\r\naction is governed by the rule that no two gun detachments should be\r\nexposed to being hit by the bullets of one shell, and also by the\r\nnecessity of having as many guns as possible at work. These two\r\nconditions are met by the adoption of a 20-yards interval between the\r\nmuzzles of the guns. At the present time the gun and its wagon are\r\nplaced as close together as possible, to obtain the full advantage of\r\nthe armoured equipment. The _shield_, behind which the detachments\r\nremain at all times covered from rifle (except at very short range) and\r\nshrapnel bullets,[3] enables the artillery commander to handle his\r\nbatteries far more boldly than formerly was the case. General Langlois\r\nsays \"the shield-protected carriage is the corollary to the quick-firing\r\ngun.\" Armour on the wagon, enabling ammunition supply as well as the\r\nservice of the gun, to be carried on under cover, soon followed the\r\nintroduction of the shield. The disadvantage of extra weight and\r\nconsequently increased difficulty of \"man-handling\" the equipment is\r\nheld to be of far less importance than the advantages obtained by the\r\nuse of armour.\r\n\r\n28. _Laying._--\"Elevation\" may be defined as the vertical inclination of\r\nthe gun, \"direction\" as the horizontal inclination to the right or left,\r\nnecessary to direct the path of the projectile to the object aimed at.\r\n\"Laying\" the gun, in the case of most modern equipments, is divided, by\r\nmeans of the device called the independent line of sight (see ORDNANCE),\r\ninto two processes, performed simultaneously by different men, the\r\nadjustment of the sights and that of the gun. The first is the act of\r\nfinding the \"line of sight,\" or line joining the sights and the point\r\naimed at; for this the equipment has to be \"traversed\" right or left so\r\nas to point in the proper direction, and also adjusted in the vertical\r\nplane. The simplest form of laying for direction, or \"line,\" is called\r\nthe \"direct\" method. If the point aimed at is the target, and it can be\r\nseen by the layer, he has merely to look over the \"open\" sights. But the\r\npoint aimed at is rarely the target itself. In war, the target, even if\r\nvisible, is often indistinct, and in this case, as also when the guns\r\nare under cover or engaging a target under cover, an \"aiming point\" or\r\n\"auxiliary mark,\" a conspicuous point quite apart and distinct from the\r\ntarget, has to be employed (\"indirect\" method). In the Russo-Japanese\r\nWar the sun was sometimes used as an aiming point. When the guns are\r\nbehind cover and the foreground cannot be seen, an artificial aiming\r\npoint is often made by placing a line of \"aiming posts\" in the ground.\r\nIf an aiming point can be found which is in line with the target, as\r\nwould be the case when aiming posts are laid out, the laying is simple,\r\nbut it is as often as not out of the line. Finding the \"line\" in this\r\ncase involves the calculation, from a distant observing point, of the\r\nangle at which the guns must be laid in order that, when the sights are\r\ndirected upon the aiming point, the shell will strike the target. It is\r\nfurther necessary to find the \"angle of sight\" or inclination of the\r\nline of sight to the horizontal plane. If aim be taken over the open\r\nsights at the target, the line of sight naturally passes through the\r\ntarget, but in any other case it may be above or below it. Then the\r\npoint where the projectile will meet the line of sight, which should\r\ncoincide with the target, is beyond it if the line of sight is below or\r\nangle of sight is too small, and short of it if the line of sight is too\r\nhigh--that is, range and fuze will be wrong. The process of indirect\r\nlaying for elevation therefore is, first, the measurement of the angle\r\nof sight, and secondly, the setting of the sights to that angle by means\r\nof a clinometer; this is called clinometer laying. In all cases the\r\nactual elevation of the gun to enable the shell to strike the target is\r\na purely mechanical adjustment, performed independently; the gun is\r\nmoved relatively to the sights, which have been previously set as\r\ndescribed. Frequently the battery commander directs the guns from a\r\npoint at some distance, communication being maintained by signallers or\r\nby field telephone. This is the normal procedure when the guns are\r\nfiring from cover. Instruments of precision and careful calculations\r\nare, of course, required to fight a battery in this manner, many\r\nallowances having to be made for the differences in height, distance and\r\nangle between the position of the battery commander and that of the\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n29. _Ranging_[4] (except on the French system alluded to below) is,\r\nfirst, finding the range (i.e. elevation required), and secondly,\r\ncorrecting the standard length of fuze for that range in accordance with\r\nthe circumstances of each case. To find the elevation required, it is\r\nnecessary to observe the bursts of shells \"on graze\" with reference to\r\nthe target. The battery commander orders two elevations differing by 300\r\nyds., e.g. \"2500, 2800,\" and tells off a \"ranging section\" of two guns.\r\nThese proceed to fire percussion shrapnel at the two different\r\nelevations, in order to obtain bursts \"over\" (+) and \"short\" (-). When\r\nit is certain that this \"long bracket\" is obtained, the \"100 yds.\r\nbracket\" is found, the elevations in the given case being, perhaps, 2600\r\nand 2700 yds. \"Verifying\" rounds are then fired, to make certain of the\r\n100 yds. bracket. The old \"short bracket\" (50 yds.) is not now required\r\nexcept at standing targets. Circumstances may, of course, shorten the\r\nprocess; for instance, a hit upon the target itself could be \"verified\"\r\nat once. The determination of the fuze (by time shrapnel) follows. The\r\nfuze has a standard length for the ascertained range, but the proper\r\ncorrection of this standard length to suit the atmospheric conditions\r\nhas to be made. The commander has therefore already given out a series\r\nof corrector[5] lengths, his object being to secure bursts both in air\r\nand on graze. When he is finally satisfied he opens fire \"for effect.\"\r\n\r\n30. An example of the ordinary method of ranging, adapted from _Field\r\nArtillery Training_, 1906, is given below.\r\n\r\n  Battery commander gives target, &c., and orders: \"Right section\r\n  ranging section; remainder corrector 150 increase 10, 4400-4700,\" for\r\n  the long bracket.\r\n\r\n  No. 1 gun fires, elevation 4400 yds., P.S., round observed -\r\n  No. 2  \"    \"        \"     4700  \"      \"     \"       \"    +\r\n                B.C. orders \"4500-4600.\"\r\n  No. 1 gun fires, elevation 4500 yds., P.S., round observed -\r\n  No. 2  \"    \"        \"     4600  \"      \"     \"       \"    +\r\n\r\n  The 100 yds. bracket appears to be 4500-4600. B.C. orders: \"Remainder\r\n  4500 time shrapnel,\" and gives the ranging section 4500-4600 to\r\n  \"verify.\" Guns 3, 4, 5, 6 set fuzes for 4500 with correctors 150, 160,\r\n  170, 180.\r\n\r\n  No. 1 gun fires, elevation 4500 yds., P.S., round observed -\r\n  No. 2  \"    \"        \"     4600  \"      \"     \"       \"    +\r\n     B.C. orders: \"Remainder 4500, one round gun fire, 3 seconds.\"\r\n             No. 3 elevation 4500 yds. T.S. corrector 150 air\r\n             No. 4     \"      \"    \"    \"       \"     160 air\r\n             No. 5     \"      \"    \"    \"       \"     160 graze\r\n             No. 6     \"      \"    \"    \"       \"     180   \"\r\n\r\n  B.C. selects corrector 160 and goes to \"section fire.\"\r\n\r\n  The battery now begins to fire \"for effect.\"\r\n\r\n             No. 1 elevation 4500 yds. T.S. corrector 160 air\r\n             No. 3     \"      \"         \"      \"       \"   \"\r\n\r\n  followed by Nos. 5, 2, 4 and 6.\r\n\r\nThere is another method of ranging, viz. with time shrapnel only. In\r\nthis the principle is that several shells, fired with the same corrector\r\nsetting, but at different elevations, will burst in air at different\r\npoints along one line. Bursts high in the air cannot be judged, and it\r\nis therefore necessary to bring down the line of bursts to the target,\r\nso that the bursts in air appear directly in front or directly in rear\r\nof it. Rounds are therefore fired (in pairs owing to possible\r\nimperfections in the fuzes) to ascertain the corrector which gives the\r\nbest line of observation. This found, the target is bracketed by bursts\r\nlow in the air observed + and -, as in the ordinary method with\r\npercussion shrapnel.\r\n\r\nThe operations of finding the \"line of fire\" and the proper elevation\r\nmay be combined, as the shells in ranging can be made to \"bracket\" for\r\ndirection as well as for elevation. The line can be changed towards a\r\nnew target in any kind of direct and indirect laying, in the latter case\r\nby observing the angle made with it by the original line of fire and\r\ngiving deflection to the guns accordingly. Further, the fire of several\r\ndispersed batteries may be concentrated, distributed, or \"switched\" from\r\none target to another on a wide front, at the will of the commander.\r\n\r\n31. _Observation of Fire_, on the accuracy of which depends the success\r\nof ranging, may be done either by the battery commander himself or by a\r\nspecial \"observing\" party. In either case the shooting is carefully\r\nobserved throughout, and corrections ordered at any time, whether during\r\nthe process of ranging or during fire for effect. The difficulties of\r\nobservation vary considerably with the ground, &c., for instance, the\r\nlight may be so bad that the target can hardly be seen, or again, if\r\nthere be a hollow in front of the target, a shell may burst in it so far\r\nbelow that the smoke appears thin, the round being then judged \"over\"\r\ninstead of \"short.\" On the other hand, a hollow behind the target may\r\ncause a round to be lost altogether. Ranging with time shrapnel has the\r\nmerit of avoiding most of these \"traps.\" The \"French system of fire\r\ndiscipline,\" referred to below, has this method as the usual procedure.\r\n\r\n32. _Fire._--Field Artillery ranges are classed in the British service\r\nas: \"distant,\" 6000 to 4500 yds.; \"long,\" 4500 to 3500; \"effective,\"\r\n3500 to 2000: and \"decisive,\" 2000 and under. The actual methods of\r\nfire employed are matters of detail; it will be sufficient to say that\r\n\"section fire,\" in which the two guns of a section are fired alternately\r\nat a named interval, usually 30 seconds, and \"rapid fire,\" in which two,\r\nthree or more rounds as ordered are fired by each gun as quickly as\r\npossible, are the normal methods. Each battery usually engages a portion\r\nof the objective equal in length to its own front, owing to the spread\r\nof the cone of shrapnel bullets (see below). The fire is, of course,\r\nalmost always frontal, though enfilade and oblique fire, when\r\nopportunities occur for their employment, are more deadly than ever,\r\nbecause of the depth of the cone. As for the general conduct of an\r\nartillery action, accurate fire for effect, at a medium rate, is used in\r\nmost armies, but in the French and, since 1906, in the British services\r\na new method has arisen, in consequence of the introduction of the\r\nmodern quick-firer and the perfection of the time shrapnel. The French\r\nbattery (1900 Q.F. equipment) consists of four guns and twelve wagons.\r\nThe gun is shielded, as also are the wagons; the high velocity and flat\r\ntrajectory give a maximum depth to the cone of shrapnel bullets. In the\r\nhope of obtaining a rapid and overwhelming fire, the French artillery\r\nranges only for a long bracket, and once this bracket is found, the\r\nground within its limits is swept from end to end in a burst of rapid\r\nfire. This is termed a _rafale_ (squall or gust), and technically\r\nsignifies \"a series of eight rounds per gun, each two rounds being laid\r\nwith 100 metres more elevation than the last pair, the whole fired off\r\nas rapidly as possible.\" The cone of time shrapnel being assumed as 300\r\nyds. (or metres), it is clear that four pairs of rounds, bursting, say,\r\nat 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300 yds. (adding, for the last, 300 yds. for\r\nits forward effect), sweep the whole ground between 1000 and 1600 yds.\r\nfrom the guns. The maximum depth would, of course, be obtained with four\r\nelevations differing by the depth of the cone; in such a case the space\r\nfrom 1000 to 2200 yds. would be covered, though much less effectively,\r\nsince the same number of bullets are distributed over a larger area. On\r\nthe other hand, the _rafale_, at a minimum, covers 300 yds., all the\r\nguns in this case being laid at the same elevation throughout. Here the\r\nmaximum number of bullets is obtained for every square yard attacked.\r\nBetween these extremes, a skilful artillery officer can vary the\r\n_rafale_ to the needs of each several case almost indefinitely.\r\n\"Sweeping\" fire is a series of three rounds per gun, one in the original\r\nline, one to the right and one to the left of it; this is significantly\r\ncalled \"mowing\" (_tir fauchant_). A further refinement in both services\r\nis the combined \"search and sweep.\" Forty-eight rounds, constituting in\r\nthe French army a series of this last kind, can, it is said, be fired in\r\n1 minute and 15 seconds, without setting fuzes beforehand, to cover an\r\narea of 600 X 200 metres. The result of such a series, worked out\r\nmathematically, is that 19% of all men and 75% of all horses, in the\r\narea and not under cover, should be hit by separate bullets (Bethell,\r\n_Modern Guns and Gunnery_, 1907). Even allowing a liberal deduction for\r\nimperfect distribution of bullets, we may feel certain that nothing but\r\nshielded guns could live long in the fire-swept zone. This is, of\r\ncourse, a rate of fire which could not be kept up for any length of time\r\nby the same battery. A French battery, firing at the maximum rate, would\r\nexpend every available round in 13 minutes.\r\n\r\n33. _Projectiles Employed._--\"Time shrapnel,\" say the German Field\r\nArtillery regulations, \"is the projectile _par excellence_ ... against\r\nall animate targets which are not under cover.\" It achieves its purpose,\r\nas has been said, by sending a shower of bullets over an area of ground\r\nin such quantity that this is swept from end to end. These bullets are\r\npropelled, in a cone, forward from the point of burst of the shell, and\r\nthe effective depth of this cone at medium ranges with a fairly high\r\nvelocity gun may be taken at 300 yds. Further, the corrector enables the\r\nartillery commander to burst his shells at any desired point; for\r\nexample, a long fuze may be given, to burst them close up when firing\r\nupon a deep target (such as troops in several lines, one behind the\r\nother), and thereby to obtain the maximum searching effect, or to obtain\r\ndirect hits on shielded guns, while a short corrector, bursting the\r\nshell well in front of the enemy, allows the maximum lateral spread of\r\nthe bullets, and therefore sweeps the greatest front. The number of\r\nbullets in the shell is such that troops in the open under effective\r\nshrapnel fire must suffer very heavily, and may be almost annihilated.\r\nIf the enemy is close behind good cover, the bullets, indeed, pass\r\nharmlessly overhead. This, however, leads to a very important fact, viz.\r\nthat artillery can keep down the fire of hostile infantry, \"blind\" the\r\nenemy, in Langlois' phrase, by _pinning it down_ to cover. Under cover\r\nthe men are safe, but if they raise their heads to take careful aim,\r\nthey will almost certainly be hit. Their fire under such conditions is\r\ntherefore unaimed and wild at the best, and may be wholly ineffective.\r\n_Common_ shell and _high-explosive_ shell (see AMMUNITION) belong to\r\nanother class of projectile. The former is now not often used, but a\r\ncertain proportion of H.E. shell is carried by the field artillery in\r\nmany armies (see table in ORDNANCE: _Field Equipments_). This has a very\r\nviolent local effect within a radius of 20 to 25 yds. of the point of\r\nburst (see AMMUNITION, fig. 10). It therefore covers far less ground\r\nthan shrapnel, and is naturally used either (a) against troops under\r\nsubstantial cover or (b) to wreck cover and buildings. In the former\r\ncase the shell is supposed to send a rain of splinters vertically\r\ndownwards. This it will do, provided the fuze is minutely accurate, and\r\na burst is thus obtained exactly over the heads of the enemy, but this\r\nis now generally held to be unlikely, and in so far as effect against\r\n_personnel_ is concerned the H.E. shell is not thought to be of much\r\nvalue. Indeed, in the British and several other services, no H.E. shells\r\nat all are carried by field batteries, reliance being placed upon\r\npercussion shrapnel in attacking localities, buildings, &c., and for\r\nranging. Experiments have been made towards producing a \"H.E. shrapnel,\"\r\nwhich combines the characteristics of both types (see, for a\r\ndescription, AMMUNITION). For the projectiles used in attacking shielded\r\nguns, see section on \"field howitzers\" below. _Case shot_ is now rarely\r\nemployed. In the war of 1870-71 Prince Kraft von Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen,\r\nwho commanded the Prussian Guard artillery, reported the expenditure of\r\nonly one round of case, and even that was merely \"broken in transport.\"\r\nThe close-quarters projectile of to-day is more usually shrapnel with\r\nthe fuze set at zero. Langlois, however, calls case shot \"the true\r\nprojectile for critical moments, which nothing can replace.\"\r\n\r\n34. _Tactics of Field Artillery._--On the march, the position and\r\nmovement of the guns are regulated by the necessity of coming quickly\r\ninto action; the usual place for the arm is at or near the heads of the\r\ncombatant columns, i.e. as far forward as is consistent with safety.\r\nSafety is further provided for by an \"escort,\" or, if such be not\r\ndetailed, by the nearest infantry or cavalry. In attack, the role of the\r\nfield artillery is usually (1) to assist if necessary the advanced guard\r\nin the preliminary fighting--for this purpose a battery is usually\r\nassigned to that corps of troops, other batteries also being sent up to\r\nthe front as required, (2) to prepare, and (3) to support or cover the\r\ninfantry attack. \"Preparation\" consists chiefly in engaging and subduing\r\nthe hostile artillery. This is often spoken of as the \"artillery duel,\"\r\nand is not a meaningless bombardment, but an essential preliminary to\r\nthe advance. Massed guns with modern shrapnel would, if allowed to play\r\nfreely upon the attack, infallibly stop, and probably annihilate, the\r\ntroops making it. The task of the guns, then, is to destroy the opposing\r\nguns and artillerymen, a task which will engage almost all the resources\r\nof the assailant's artillery in the struggle for artillery superiority.\r\nShielded guns, enhanced rate of fire, perfection in indirect laying\r\napparatus, and many other factors, have modified the lessons of 1870,\r\nand complicated the work of achieving victory in the artillery duel so\r\nfar that the simple \"hard pounding\" of former days has given way to a\r\nvariety of expedients for inflicting the desired loss and damage, as to\r\nwhich opinions differ in and within every army. One point is, however,\r\nclear and meets with universal acceptance. \"The whole object of the duel\r\nis to enable the artillery subsequently to devote all available\r\nresources to its principal task, which is the material and moral support\r\nof the infantry during each succeeding stage of the fight\" (French\r\nregulations). One side must be victorious in the end, and when, and not\r\nuntil, the hostile artillery is beaten out of action, the victor has\r\nacquired the power of pressing home the attack. The British regulations\r\n(1906), indeed, deal with the steps to be taken when, though the\r\nartillery of the attack is beaten, the infantry advance is continued,\r\nbut only so as to order the guns to \"reopen at all costs,\" in other\r\nwords, as a forlorn hope. The second part of the preparation, the\r\ngradual disintegration of the opposing line of infantry, has practically\r\ndisappeared from the drill books. The next task of the guns, and that in\r\nwhich modern artillery asserts its power to the utmost, is the _support_\r\nof the infantry attack. The artillery and infantry co-operate, \"the\r\nformer by firing rapidly when they see their own infantry ... press\r\nforward, and the latter by making full use of the periods of intense\r\nartillery fire to gain ground\" (British _F.A. Training_, 1906). Thus\r\naided, the infantry closes in to decisive ranges, and as it gains ground\r\nto the front, every gun \"must be at once turned upon the points selected\r\n... the most effective support afforded to the attacking infantry by the\r\nconcentrated fire of guns and field howitzers. The former tie the\r\ndefenders to their entrenchments (for retreat is practically impossible\r\nover ground swept by shrapnel bullets), distract their attention and\r\ntend to make them keep their heads down, while the shell from the field\r\nhowitzers searches out the interior of the trenches, the reverse slopes\r\nof the position, and checks the movement of reinforcements towards the\r\nthreatened point.\" In these words the British Field Artillery drill-book\r\nof 1902 summarizes the act of \"covering\" the infantry advance.\r\nUnofficial publications are still more emphatic. The advance of the\r\ninfantry to decisive range would often be covered by a mass of one\r\nhundred or more field guns, firing shrapnel at the rate of ten rounds\r\nper gun per minute at the critical moment. Against such a storm of fire\r\nthe defending infantry, even supposing that its own guns had refitted\r\nand were again in action, would be powerless. It is in recognition of\r\nthe appalling power of field artillery (which has increased in a ratio\r\nout of all proportion to the improvements of modern rifles) that the\r\nFrench system has been elaborated to the perfection which it has now\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nWith modern guns and modern tactics artillery almost invariably fires\r\nover the heads of its own infantry. The German regulations indeed say\r\nthat it should be avoided as far as possible, but, as a matter of fact,\r\nif the numerous guns of a modern army (at Koniggratz there were 1550\r\nguns on the field, at Gravelotte 1252, at Mukden 3000) were to be given\r\na clear front, there would be no room for deploying the infantry.\r\nConsequently the French regulations, in which the power of the artillery\r\nis given the greatest possible scope, say that \"it almost always fires\r\nover the heads of its own infantry.\" With field guns and on level ground\r\nit is considered dangerous that infantry in front of the guns should be\r\nless than 600 yds. distant--not for fear of the shells striking the\r\ninfantry, but because the fragments resulting from a \"premature\" burst\r\nare dangerous up to that distance. The question of distance is more\r\nimportant in connexion with the \"covering\" of the assault. Up to a\r\npoint, the artillery enables the attacking infantry to advance with a\r\nminimum of loss and exhaustion, and thus to close with the enemy at\r\nleast on equal terms, if not with a serious advantage, for the fire of\r\nthe guns may shake, perhaps almost destroy the enemy's power of\r\nresistance. But when the infantry approaches the enemy the guns can no\r\nlonger fire upon the latter's front line without risk of injuring their\r\nfriends. All that they can do, when the opposing infantries can see the\r\nwhites of each other's eyes, is to lengthen the fuze, raise the\r\ntrajectory and sweep the ground where the enemy's supports are posted.\r\nUnder these circumstances it is practically agreed that the risk should\r\nbe taken without hesitation at so critical a moment as that of a\r\ndecisive infantry assault which must be pushed home at whatever cost.\r\n\"It will be better for the infantry to chance a few friendly shells than\r\nto be received at short range with a fresh outburst of hostile rifle\r\nfire\" (Rouquerol, _Tactical Employment of Quick-firing Field\r\nArtillery_). Thus, the distance at which direct support ceases, formerly\r\n600 yds., has been diminished to 100, and even to 50 yds. Howitzers can,\r\nof course, maintain their fire almost up to the very last stage, and, in\r\ngeneral, high-explosive shell, owing to its purely local effect, may be\r\nemployed for some time after it has become unsafe to use shrapnel.\r\n\r\n35. Field artillery in _defence_, which would presumably be inferior to\r\nthat of the attack, must, of course, act according to circumstances. We\r\nare here concerned not with the absolute strength or weakness of the\r\npassive defensive, which is a matter of tactics (q.v.), but with the\r\ntactical procedure of artillery, which, relatively to other methods, is\r\nheld to offer the best chance of success, so far as success is\r\nattainable. On the defensive in a prepared position, which in European\r\nwarfare at any rate will be an unusually favourable case for the\r\ndefender--the guns have two functions, that of engaging and holding the\r\nhostile artillery, and that of meeting the infantry assault. The dilemma\r\nis this, that on the one hand a position in rear of the line of battle,\r\nwith modern improvements in communicating and indirect laying apparatus,\r\nis well suited for engaging the hostile guns, but not for meeting the\r\nassault; and on the other, guns on the forward slope of the defender's\r\nridge or hill can fire direct, but are quickly located and overwhelmed,\r\nfor they can hardly remain silent while their own infantry bears the\r\nfire of the assailant's shrapnel. Thus the defender's guns would, as a\r\nrule, have to be divided. One portion would seek to fight from rearward\r\nconcealed positions, and use every device to delay the victory of the\r\nenemy's guns and the development of the battle until it is too late in\r\nthe day for a serious infantry attack. Further, the enemy's mistakes and\r\nthe \"fortune of war\" may give opportunities of inflicting severe losses;\r\nsuch opportunities have always occurred and will do so again. In the\r\npossible (though very far from probable) case of the defender not merely\r\nbaffling, but crushing his opponent in the artillery duel, he may, if he\r\nso desires, himself assume the role of assailant, and at any rate he\r\nplaces a veto on the enemy's attack.\r\n\r\nThe portion told off to meet the infantry assault would be entrenched on\r\nthe forward slope and would take no part in the artillery duel. Very\r\nexceptionally, this advanced artillery might fire upon favourable\r\ntargets, but its paramount duty is to remain intact for the decisive\r\nmoment. Here again the defender is confronted with grave difficulties.\r\nIt is true that his advanced batteries may be of the greatest possible\r\nassistance at the crisis of the infantry assault, yet even so the\r\ncovering fire of the hostile guns, as soon as the hostile infantry had\r\nfound them their target, may be absolutely overwhelming; moreover, once\r\nthe fight has begun, the guns cannot be withdrawn, nor can their\r\npositions easily be modified to meet unexpected developments. The\r\nproportion of the whole artillery force which should be committed to the\r\nforward position is disputed. Colonel Bethell (_Journal Royal\r\nArtillery_, vol. xxxiii. p. 67) holds that all the mountain guns, and\r\ntwo-thirds of the field guns, should be in the forward, all the\r\nhowitzers and heavy guns and one-third of the field guns in the retired\r\nposition. But in view of the facts that if once the advanced guns are\r\nsubmerged in the tide of the enemy's assault, they will be\r\nirrecoverable, and that a modern Q.F. gun, with plenty of ammunition at\r\nhand, may use \"rapid fire\" freely, artillery opinion, as a whole, is in\r\nfavour of having fewer guns and an abnormal ammunition supply in the\r\nforward entrenchments, and the bulk of the artillery (with the\r\nammunition columns at hand) in rear. But the purely passive defensive is\r\nusually but a preliminary to an active counter-stroke. This\r\ncounter-attack would naturally be supported to the utmost by the\r\noffensive tactics of the artillery, which might thus at the end of a\r\nbattle achieve far greater results than it could have done at the\r\nbeginning of the day. In _pursuit_, it is universally agreed that the\r\naction of the artillery may be bold to the verge of rashness. The\r\nemployment of field artillery in _advanced_ and _rear guard actions_\r\nvaries almost indefinitely according to circumstances; with _outposts_,\r\nguns would only be employed exceptionally.\r\n\r\n36. _Marches._--The importance of having the artillery well up at the\r\nfront of a marching column is perhaps best expressed in the phrase of\r\nPrince Kraft von Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, \"save hours and not minutes.\"\r\nThe Germans in 1870 so far acted up to the principle that Prince\r\nHohenlohe, when asked, at the beginning of the battle of Sedan, for a\r\ncouple of guns, was able to reply, \"You shall have ninety\" (see, for\r\ndetails of the march of the Guard artillery, his _Letters on Artillery_,\r\n6th letter). The German regulations for field service say, very plainly,\r\n\"the horses have not done their work until they have got the guns into\r\naction, even at the cost of utter exhaustion.\" A notable march was made\r\nby the 62nd battery, R.F.A., in the South African War. On the day of the\r\nbattle of Modder River, the battery marched 32 m. (mostly through deep\r\nsand) arriving in time to take part in the action. Such forced marches,\r\nif rare, are nowadays expected to be within the power of field artillery\r\nto accomplish. Horse artillery is capable of more than this, and as to\r\npace, manoeuvring at the cavalry rate. Heavy guns are the least mobile,\r\nand would rarely be able to keep pace with infantry in a forced march.\r\nField artillery walks 4, trots 9, and gallops at the rate of 15 m. an\r\nhour. A fair marching pace (trot and walk) is 4 m. an hour for field, 5\r\nfor horse batteries. A march of 14 m. would, according to the German\r\nregulations, be performed by\r\n\r\n  a field battery in 5 hours,\r\n  a horse battery in 4 hours,\r\n\r\nunder favourable circumstances (Bronsart von Schellendorf).\r\n\r\n37. _Power and Mobility._--It will have been made clear that every gun\r\nrepresents a compromise between these two requirements, and that each\r\ntype of artillery has been evolved in accordance with the relative\r\nrequirements of these conditions in respect of the work to be performed.\r\nThe classification which has been followed in this article represents\r\nthe practically unanimous decision of every important military state.\r\nStill, there has always been controversy between the individual\r\nadherents of each side, and the Boer War experiences raised the question\r\nas to whether field artillery, as the term is usually understood, should\r\nnot be abolished, with a view to having only heavy guns and horse\r\nartillery with a field army.\r\n\r\n38. _Concentration and Dispersion._--The use of their artillery made by\r\nthe Boers in the South African War led to the revival of the idea of\r\n\"dispersing\" guns instead of \"concentrating\" them. It would be more\r\naccurate to say that military thinkers had, after the introduction of\r\nthe quick-firing gun, challenged every received principle, and amongst\r\nothers the employment of artillery in masses, which, as a result of the\r\nwar of 1870, \"had become almost an article of faith.\" The idea was to\r\nmake use of the increased power of the guns to gain equally great\r\nresults with the employment of less material than formerly. Thus the\r\ndispersion of guns is bound up with the passive defensive. The first\r\neditions of the British _Field Artillery Training_ and _Combined\r\nTraining_, strongly influenced as they were by South African experience,\r\ndid not legislate, even in dealing with defence, for \"dispersion\" in the\r\nBoer manner, but only for adaptability (see _Field Artillery Training_,\r\n1902, p. 15). In the Boer War, whilst the Boers nearly always scattered\r\ntheir guns, almost the only occasion upon which their artillery played a\r\ndecisive part was at Spion Kop, where its fire was concentrated upon the\r\npoint of assault. At Pieter's Hill, the fire of seventy guns covered the\r\nBritish infantry assault in the Napoleonic manner. On the whole it may\r\nbe accepted as a general truth that guns are safe, and may be locally\r\neffective, when dispersed, but that they cannot produce decisive effect\r\nexcept when used in masses. It must, however, be clearly understood that\r\na \"mass\" in this sense means a large number of guns, under one command,\r\nand susceptible of being handled as a unit, so far as the direction and\r\neffectiveness of their fire is concerned. _This being secured_, and on\r\nthat condition only, it does not matter whether the actual gun positions\r\nare scattered over a few square miles, or are closed in one long line\r\nand using direct fire--they are still a mass, and capable of acting\r\neffectively as such. While there are undoubtedly grave dangers in using\r\nthe indirect method too freely, technical improvements in laying,\r\ntelephones, &c., have had much to do with the possibility, at any rate\r\nunder favourable circumstances, of a concentration which may be\r\ndescribed as one of shells rather than of guns, and the reader is\r\nreminded in this connexion that the work formerly done by the gun is now\r\nperformed by the shell.\r\n\r\n39. _Horse Artillery_ is to be regarded as field artillery of great\r\nmobility and manoeuvring power. Its value may be said, in general terms,\r\nto lie in augmenting the weak fire-power of the mounted troops, and in\r\nfacilitating their work as much as possible. Thus, when cavalry meets\r\nserious opposition in reconnoitring, the guns may be able to break down\r\nthe enemy's resistance without calling for assistance from the main body\r\nof the cavalry, and, in the action of cavalry _versus_ cavalry, the\r\n\"paramount duty of the horse artillery is to shatter the enemy's\r\ncavalry\" (_Field Artillery Training_, 1906), i.e. to \"prepare\" the\r\nsuccess of the cavalry charge by breaking up as far as possible the\r\nenemy's power of meeting it. In the cavalry battle, covering fire is\r\npractically impossible, owing both to the short distances separating the\r\ncombatants and to the rapidity of their movements, but steps are taken\r\n\"to enable all the guns to bear on the enemy's cavalry at the points of\r\ncollision.\" The ideal position for the horse artillery is out to a\r\nflank, the cavalry manoeuvring so as to draw the enemy's cavalry under\r\nenfilade fire, and at the same time to force them to mask the fire of\r\ntheir own horse artillery. Another and a most important function of the\r\nhorse batteries is to reinforce, with the greatest possible speed, any\r\npoint in the general line of battle which is in need of artillery\r\nsupport. For this reason the corps artillery generally includes horse\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\n40. _Field Howitzers_ are somewhat less mobile than field guns; they\r\nhave, however, far greater shell power. The special features of the\r\nweapon are, of course, the product of the special requirements which\r\nhave called it into existence. These are, briefly (a) the necessity of\r\nbeing able to \"search\" the interior of earthworks, a task which, as has\r\nbeen said, is beyond the power of high-velocity field guns, and (b)\r\ndemolition work, which is equally beyond the power of even a H.E. shell\r\nof field-gun calibre. The first of these conditions implies a steep\r\n\"angle of descent,\" which again implies a high angle of elevation. The\r\nsecond requires great shell power but does not call for high velocity.\r\nThe howitzer, therefore, is a short gun, firing a heavy shell at high\r\nangles of elevation. Howitzers almost always are laid by the indirect\r\nmethod of fire from under cover, since it is clear that, with high\r\nangles of elevation, the gun may be brought close up to the covering\r\nmass, and still fire over it. Ranging must be done very accurately and\r\nyet economically, as but few of their heavy shells can be carried in the\r\nwagons and limbers, and the shells descending upon an enemy almost\r\nvertically lose the long sweeping effect of the field shrapnel which\r\nneutralizes minor errors of ranging. The projectiles employed are high\r\nexplosive and shrapnel, the latter for use against _personnel_ under\r\ncover, the former for demolition of field works, casemates or buildings.\r\nIt is very generally held that howitzer time shrapnel is the best form\r\nof projectile for the attack of shielded guns. Here it may be said that\r\nno completely satisfactory method of dealing with these has yet been\r\ndiscovered. The best procedure with field guns is said to be lengthening\r\nthe fuze to obtain a high percentage of bursts on graze. A shell\r\nstriking the face of the shield will penetrate it, and should kill some\r\nat least of the gun detachment behind. The high-explosive shrapnel\r\nalluded to above is designed primarily for the attack of shielded guns.\r\n\r\n41. _Heavy Field Artillery_, alternatively called _Artillery of\r\nPosition_, as has been said, includes all guns of 4-in. calibre and\r\nupwards, mounted on travelling carriages. In South Africa, where firm\r\nsoil was usually to be found, 6-in. guns were employed as heavy field\r\nguns, but in Europe even the 5-in. (British Service) is liable to sink\r\ninto the ground. In Great Britain, guns only are used by this branch;\r\nabroad, the \"heavy artillery of the field army,\" the \"light siege\r\ntrain,\" &c., as it is variously called, is as a rule composed of\r\nhowitzers of a heavier calibre than the field howitzer, the 15-cm.\r\n(6-in.) howitzer being most commonly met with. This artillery has,\r\nhowever, a different tactical role from the heavy field artillery of the\r\nBritish service; and it is always with a view to the attack of permanent\r\nor semi-permanent fortifications that the _materiel_ is organized. In\r\nGreat Britain, heavy batteries armed with the 5-in. gun are considered\r\nas \"an auxiliary to the horse and field artillery\" (_Heavy Artillery\r\nTraining_). Ranging is conducted with greater deliberation than ranging\r\nwith the lighter guns, though upon the same general lines. Parts of the\r\nprocess may, however, be omitted in certain circumstances. Heavy guns\r\nuse high-explosive (lyddite) shells and time shrapnel, the former for\r\nranging and for demolishing cover, the latter against _personnel_.\r\nLaying is usually indirect. The tactical principles upon which heavy\r\nartillery does its work are based, in the main, on the long range (up to\r\n10,000 yds.) and great shell-power of the guns. This power enables the\r\nartillery to reach with effect targets which are beyond the range of\r\nlighter ordnance, and it is, therefore, considered possible to disperse\r\nthe guns in batteries, and even in sections of two guns, along the front\r\nof the army, without forfeiting the power of concentrating their fire on\r\nany point--a power which otherwise they would not possess owing to their\r\nwant of mobility. At the same time it is not forbidden to bring them\r\ninto line with the rest of the artillery, in order to achieve a decisive\r\nresult. In the _attack_, beside the general task of supplementing the\r\neffect of other natures of ordnance, heavy artillery may demolish cover,\r\nbuildings, &c., held by the enemy, and during the infantry assault they\r\nmay do excellent service in sweeping a great depth of ground, their\r\nsmaller angle of descent, and the greater remaining velocity and heavier\r\ndriving charge of their shrapnel, as compared with field guns, enabling\r\nthem to do this effectively. In the _defence_, long-range fire has great\r\nvalue, especially in sweeping approaches which the enemy must use. In\r\n_pursuit_, the heavy artillery may be able to shell the main body of the\r\nenemy during its retreat, even if it has left a rearguard. In _retreat_,\r\nthe want of mobility of these guns militates against their employment in\r\nexposed positions, such as rearguards usually have to take up.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.[6]--Amongst general historical works may be mentioned\r\n  Napoleon III. and Col.

For the early 17th century, Diego Ufano, _Tratado de la\r\n  Artilleria_ (1613) is a standard treatise of the time, but the mystery\r\n  preserved by artillerists in regard to their arm is responsible for an\r\n  astonishing dearth of artillery literature even in the time of the\r\n  Thirty Years' War. In 1650 appeared Casimir Simienowicz' _Ars magnae\r\n  artilleriae_, an English translation of which was published in London\r\n  in 1729, and in 1683 Michael Mieth published _Artilleriae Recentior\r\n  Praxis_. The first edition of Surirey de S. Remy, _Memoires\r\n  d'Artillerie_, appeared in Paris in 1697. With the reorganization of\r\n  the arm in the early 18th century came many manuals and other works\r\n  (see Jahns, _op. cit._ pp. 1607-1621 and 1692-1698), amongst which may\r\n  be mentioned the marquis de Quincy's _Art de la guerre_ (1726). From\r\n  1740 onwards numerous manuals appeared, mostly official\r\n  _reglements_--see French General Staff, _L'Artillerie francaise au\r\n  XVIII^e siecle_ (1908); and the tactical handling of the arm is\r\n  treated in general works, such as Guibert's, on war.

A.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Napoleon's maxim, quoted above, reappears in spirit in the\r\n    British F.A. Training of 1906 (p. 225).\r\n\r\n  [2] The old smooth-bore mortar for high-angle fire has of course\r\n    disappeared, but the name \"mortar\" is still applied in some countries\r\n    to short rifled howitzers.\r\n\r\n  [3] Though not of course against the direct impact of shrapnel or\r\n    H.E. shells.\r\n\r\n  [4] Finding the line is also an integral part of ranging. When an\r\n    aiming point is used, the angle at which the guns must be laid with\r\n    reference to it is calculated and given out by the battery commander.\r\n    The modern goniometric sight permits of a wide angle (in England 180\r\n    deg. right or left) being given. \"Deflection\" is a small angular\r\n    correction applied to individual guns.\r\n\r\n  [5] The \"corrector\" is an adjustment on the sights of the gun used\r\n    to determine the correct fuze. In the British Q.F. equipment, a\r\n    graduated dial or drum shows the elevation of the gun above the line\r\n    of sight. The fuze lengths are marked on a movable scale opposite\r\n    the range graduations to which they apply, and the \"corrector\" moves\r\n    this fuze scale so as to bring different fuze lengths opposite the\r\n    range graduation. For example, a certain corrector setting gives\r\n    11-1/2 on the fuze scale opposite 4000 yds. on the range scale, and\r\n    if the shells set to 11-1/2 burst too high, a new corrector setting\r\n    is taken, the fuze length 12 is now opposite to the 4000 range\r\n    graduation, and this length gives bursts closer up and lower. In the\r\n    German service a corrector (_Aufsatzschieber_) alters the real\r\n    elevation given to the gun, so that while throughout the battery all\r\n    guns have the same (nominal or ordered) elevation shown on the\r\n    sights, the real elevations of individual guns vary according to the\r\n    different corrector settings. Thus bursts at different heights and\r\n    distances from the target are obtained by shifting the trajectory of\r\n    the shell. The fuze, being set for the nominal elevation common to\r\n    all the guns, burns for the same time in each case, and thus the\r\n    burst will be lower and closer to the target with a less (real)\r\n    elevation, and higher and farther from it with a greater.\r\n\r\n  [6] Most of the works named deal with technical questions of\r\n    equipment, ammunition, ballistics, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIODACTYLA (from Gr. [Greek: artios], even, and [Greek: daktylos], a\r\nfinger or toe, \"even-toed\"), the suborder of ungulate mammals in which\r\nthe central (and in some cases the only) pair of toes in each foot are\r\narranged symmetrically on each side of a vertical line running through\r\nthe axes of the limbs. As contrasted with the Perissodactyla living, and\r\nin a great degree extinct, Artiodactyla are characterized by the\r\nfollowing structural features. The upper premolar and molar teeth are\r\nnot alike, the former being single and the latter two-lobed; and the\r\nlast lower molar of both first and second dentition is almost invariably\r\nthree-lobed. Nasal bones not expanded posteriorly. No alisphenoid canal.\r\nDorsal and lumbar vertebrae together always nineteen, though the former\r\nmay vary from twelve to fifteen. Femur without third trochanter. Third\r\nand fourth digits of both feet almost equally developed, and their\r\nterminal phalanges flattened on their inner or contiguous surfaces, so\r\nthat each is not symmetrical in itself, but when the two are placed\r\ntogether they form a figure symmetrically disposed to a line drawn\r\nbetween them. Or, in other words, the axis or median line of the whole\r\nfoot is a line drawn between the third and fourth digits (fig. 1). Lower\r\narticular surface of the astragalus divided into two nearly equal\r\nfacets, one for the navicular and a second for the cuboid bone. The\r\ncalcaneum with an articular facet for the lower end of the fibula.\r\nStomach almost always more or less complex. Colon convoluted. Caecum\r\nsmall. Placenta diffused or cotyledonary. Teats either few and inguinal,\r\nor numerous and abdominal.\r\n\r\nArtiodactyla date from the Eocene period, when they appear to have been\r\nless numerous than the Perissodactyla, although at the present day they\r\nare immeasurably ahead of that group, and form indeed the dominant\r\nungulates. As regards the gradual specialization and development of the\r\nmodern types, the following features are noteworthy.\r\n\r\n1. As regards the teeth, we have the passage of a simply tubercular, or\r\nbunodont ([Greek: bounos], a hillock) type of molar into one in which\r\nthe four main tubercles, or columns, have assumed a crescentic form,\r\nwhence this type is termed selenodont ([Greek: selaenae], the new moon).\r\nFurther, there is the modification of the latter from a short-crowned,\r\nor brachyodont type, to one in which the columns are tall, constituting\r\nthe hypsodont, or hypsiselenodont, type. It is noteworthy, however, that\r\nin some instances there appears to have been a retrograde modification\r\nfrom the selenodont towards the bunodont type, the hippopotamus being a\r\ncase in point. Other modifications are the loss of the upper incisors;\r\nthe development of the canines into projecting tusks; and the loss of\r\nthe anterior premolars.\r\n\r\n2. As regards the limbs. Reduction of the ulna from a complete and\r\ndistinct bone to a comparatively rudimentary state in which it coalesces\r\nmore or less firmly with the radius. Reduction of the fibula till\r\nnothing but its lower extremity remains. Reduction and final loss of\r\nouter pair of digits (second and fifth), with coalescence of the\r\nmetacarpal and metatarsal bones of the two middle digits to form a\r\ncannon-bone. Union of the navicular and cuboid, and sometimes the\r\nectocuneiform bone, of the tarsus.\r\n\r\n3. Change of form of the odontoid process of the second or axis\r\nvertebrae from a cone to a hollow half-cylinder.\r\n\r\n4. Development of horns or antlers on the frontal bones, and gradual\r\ncomplication of form of antlers.\r\n\r\n5. By inference only, increasing complication of stomach with ruminating\r\nfunction superadded. Modification of placenta from simple diffused to\r\ncotyledonary form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Bones of Right Fore Feet of existing\r\nArtiodactyla.\r\n\r\n  A, Pig (_Sus scrofa_).             l, Lunar.\r\n  B, Red deer (_Cervus elaphus_).    s, Scaphoid.\r\n  C, Camel (_Camelus bactrianus_).   u, Unciform.\r\n  U, Ulna.                           m, Magnum.\r\n  R, Radius.                         td, Trapezoid.]\r\n  c, Cuneiform.\r\n\r\nIn the Sheep and the Camel the long compound bone, supporting the two\r\nmain (or only) toes is the cannon-bone.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Artiodactyla thus probably had the typical number (44) of\r\nincisor, canine and molar teeth, brachyodont molars, conical odontoid\r\nprocess, four distinct toes on each foot, with metacarpal, metatarsal\r\nand all the tarsal bones distinct, and no frontal appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pecora.\r\n\r\nAs regards classification, the first group is that of the Pecora, or\r\nCotylophora, in which the cheek-teeth are selenodont, but there are no\r\nupper incisors or canine-like premolars, while upper canines are\r\ngenerally absent, though sometimes largely developed. Inferior incisors,\r\nthree on each side with an incisiform canine in contact with them.\r\nCheek-teeth consisting of p.3/3, m.3/3, in continuous series. Auditory\r\nbulla simple and hollow within. Odontoid process of second vertebra in\r\nthe form of a crescent, hollow above. Lower extremity of the fibula\r\nrepresented by a distinct malleolar bone articulating with the outer\r\nsurface of the lower end of the tibia. Third and fourth metacarpals and\r\nmetatarsals confluent into cannon-bones (fig. 1 B), and the toes\r\nenclosed in hoofs. Outer toes small and rudimentary, or in some cases\r\nentirely suppressed; their metacarpal or metatarsal bones never\r\ncomplete. Navicular and cuboid bones of tarsus united. The skull\r\ngenerally lacks a sagittal crest; and the condyle of the lower jaw is\r\ntransversely elongated. Horns or antlers usually present, at least in\r\nthe male sex. Left brachial artery arising from a common innominate\r\ntrunk, instead of coming off separately from the aortic arch. Stomach\r\nwith four complete cavities. Placenta cotyledonous. Teats 2 or 4.\r\n\r\nThe group at the present day is divided into _Giraffidae_ (giraffe and\r\nokapi), _Cervidae_ (deer), _Antilocapridae_ (prongbuck), and _Bovidae_\r\n(oxen, sheep, goats, antelopes, &c.). (See PECORA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tylopoda.\r\n\r\nThe second group is represented at the present day by the camels\r\n(_Camelus_) of the Old, and the llamas (_Lama_) of the New World,\r\ncollectively constituting the family _Camelidae_. They derive their name\r\nof Tylopoda (\"boss-footed\") from the circumstance that the feet form\r\nlarge cushion-like pads, supporting the weight of the body, while the\r\ntoes have broad nails on their upper surface only, instead of being\r\nencased in hoofs. The cheek-teeth are selenodont, and one pair of upper\r\nincisors is retained, while some of the anterior premolars assume a\r\ncanine-like shape, and are separated from the rest of the cheek-series.\r\nAuditory bulla filled with honeycombed bony tissue. Odontoid process of\r\nsecond vertebra semi-cylindrical; skull with a sagittal crest; and the\r\ncondyle of the lower jaw rounded. Third and fourth metacarpals and\r\nmetatarsals (which are alone present) fused into cannon-bones for the\r\ngreater part of their length, but diverging inferiorly (fig. 1, C) and\r\nwith their articular surfaces for the toes smooth, instead of ridged as\r\nin the Pecora. Navicular and cuboid bones of tarsus distinct. No horns\r\nor antlers. Stomach, although complex, differing essentially from that\r\nof the Pecora. Placenta diffuse, without cotyledons. Teats few. (See\r\nTYLOPODA.)\r\n\r\nIn the same sectional group is included the North American family of\r\noreodonts (_Oreodontidae_), which are much more primitive ruminants, with\r\nshorter necks and limbs, the full series of 44 teeth, all in apposition,\r\nand the metacarpal and metatarsal bones separate, and the toes generally\r\nof more normal type, although sometimes claw-like. (See OREODON.) The\r\nEocene American genus _Homacodon_ is regarded as representing a third\r\nfamily group, the _Homacodontidae (= Pantolestidae_), in which the molars\r\nwere of a bunodont type, and approximate to those of the Condylarthra\r\nfrom which this family appears to have sprung, and to have given origin\r\non the one hand to the _Oreodontidae_, and on the other to the\r\n_Camelidae_. The family is represented in the Lower, or Wasatch, Eocene\r\nby _Trigonolestes_, in the Middle (Bridger) Eocene by _Homacodon_\r\n(Pantolestes), and in the Upper (Uinta) Eocene by _Bunomeryx_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tragulina.\r\n\r\nThe third group is that represented by the chevrotains or mouse-deer,\r\nforming the family _Tragulidae_, with _Tragulus_ in south-eastern Asia\r\nand _Dorcatherium_ (or _Hyomoschus_) in equatorial Africa. The\r\ncheek-teeth are selenodont, as in the two preceding groups; there are no\r\nupper incisors, but there are long, narrow and pointed upper canines,\r\nwhich attain a large size in the males; the lower canines are\r\nincisor-like, as in the Pecora, and there are no caniniform premolars in\r\neither jaw. Cheek-teeth in a continuous series consisting of p. 3/3, m.\r\n3/3. Odontoid process of axis conical. Fibula complete. Four complete\r\ntoes on each foot. The middle metacarpals and metatarsals generally\r\nconfluent, the outer ones (second and fifth) slender but complete, i.e.\r\nextending from the carpus or tarsus to the digit. Navicular, cuboid and\r\nectocuneiform bones of tarsus united. Auditory bulla of skull filled\r\nwith cancellar tissue. No frontal appendages. Ruminating, but the\r\nstomach with only three distinct compartments, the maniplies or third\r\ncavity of the stomach of the Pecora being rudimentary. Placenta\r\ndiffused. (See CHEVROTAIN.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Anoplotherina.\r\n\r\nIn this place must be mentioned the extinct Oligocene European group\r\ntypified by the well-known genus _Anoplotherium_ of the Paris\r\ngypsum-quarries, and hence termed Anoplotherina, although the\r\nalternative title Dichobunoidea has been suggested. It includes the two\r\nfamilies _Anoplotheriidae_ and _Dichobunidae_, of which the first died\r\nout with the Oligocene, while the second may have given origin to the\r\nTragulina and perhaps the Pecora. There is the full series of 44 teeth,\r\ngenerally without any gaps, and most of the bones of the skeleton are\r\nseparate and complete; while, in many instances at any rate, the tail\r\nwas much longer than in any existing ungulates, and the whole bodily\r\nform approximated to that of a carnivore. The upper molars, which may\r\nbe either selenodont or buno-selenodont, carry five cusps each, instead\r\nof the four characteristic of all the preceding groups; and they are all\r\nvery low-crowned, so as to expose the whole of the valleys between the\r\ncusps. In _Anoplotherium_, some of the species of which were larger than\r\ntapirs, there were either two or three toes, the latter number being\r\nalmost unique among the Artiodactyla. Allied genera are _Diplobune_ and\r\n_Dacrytherium_.\r\n\r\nThe _Dichobunidae_ include the genus _Dichobune_, of which the species\r\nwere small animals with buno-selenodont molars. _Xiphodon_ and\r\n_Dichodon_ represent another type with cutting premolars and selenodont\r\nmolars; while _Caenotherium_ and _Plesiomeryx_ form yet another branch,\r\nwith resemblances to the ruminants. The most interesting genera are\r\nhowever, the Upper Oligocene and Lower Miocene _Gelocus_ and\r\n_Prodremotherium_, which have perfectly selenodont teeth, and the third\r\nand fourth metacarpal and metatarsal bones respectively fused into an\r\nimperfect cannon-bone, with the reduction of the lateral metacarpals and\r\nmetatarsals to mere remnants of their upper and lower extremities. While\r\n_Gelocus_ exhibits a marked approximation to the _Tragulidae,\r\nProdremotherium_ comes nearer to the _Cervidae_, of which it not\r\nimprobably indicates the ancestral type. The _Dichobunidae_ may be\r\nregarded as occupying a position analogous to that of the\r\n_Homacodontidae_ in the Tylopoda, and like the latter, are probably the\r\ndirect descendants of Condylarthra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 2.--Restoration of _Anoplotherium commune._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Suina.\r\n\r\nThe last section of the Artiodactyla is that of the Suina, represented\r\nat the present day by the pigs (_Suidae_), and the hippopotamuses\r\n(_Hippopotamidae_), and in past times by the _Anthracotheriidae_, in\r\nwhich may probably be included the _Elotheriidae._ In the existing\r\nmembers of the group the cheek-teeth approximate to the bunodont type,\r\nalthough showing signs of being degenerate modifications of the\r\nselenodont modification. There is at least one pair of upper incisors,\r\nwhile the full series of 44 teeth may be present. The metacarpals and\r\nmetatarsals are generally distinct (fig. 1 A), and never fuse into a\r\ncomplete cannon-bone; and the navicular and cuboid bones of the tarsus\r\nare separate. The odontoid process of the second vertebra is pig-like:\r\nand the tibia and fibula and radius and ulna are severally distinct. The\r\nstomach is simple or somewhat complex, and the placenta diffused. The\r\n_Suidae_ include the Old World pigs (_Suinae_) and the American\r\npeccaries (_Dicotylinae_), and are characterized by the snout\r\nterminating in a fleshy disk-like expansion, in the midst of which are\r\nperforated the nostrils; while the toes are enclosed in sharp hoofs, of\r\nwhich the lateral ones do not touch the ground. There is a caecum. The\r\n_Dicotylinae_ differ from the _Suinae_ in that the upper canines are\r\ndirected downwards (instead of curving upwards) and have sharp\r\ncutting-edges, while the toes are four in front and three behind\r\n(instead of four on each foot), and the stomach is complex instead of\r\nsimple. In the Old World a large number of fossil forms are known, of\r\nwhich the earliest is the Egyptian Eocene _Geniohyus._ Originally the\r\nfamily was an Old World type, but in the Miocene it gained access into\r\nNorth America, where the earliest form is _Bothriolabis_, an ancestral\r\npeccary showing signs of affinity with the European Miocene genus\r\n_Palaeochoerus._ (See SWINE and PECCARY.)\r\n\r\nThe _Hippopotamidae_ are an exclusively Old World group, in which the\r\nmuzzle is broad and rounded and quite unlike that of the _Suidae_, while\r\nthe crowns of the cheek-teeth form a distinctly trefoil pattern, when\r\npartially worn, which is only foreshadowed in those of the latter. The\r\nshort and broad teeth terminate in four subequal toes, protected by\r\nshort rounded hoofs, and all reaching the ground. The hinder end of the\r\nlower jaw is provided with a deep descending flange. Both incisors and\r\ncanines are devoid of roots and grow throughout life, the canines, and\r\nin the typical species one pair of lower incisors, growing to an immense\r\nsize. The stomach is complex; but there is no caecum. Although now\r\nexclusively African, the family (of which all the representatives may be\r\nincluded in the single genus _Hippopotamus_, with several subgeneric\r\ngroups) is represented in the Pliocene of Europe and the Lower Pliocene\r\nof northern India. Its place of origin cannot yet be determined.\r\n\r\nThe extinct _Anthracotheriidae_ were evidently nearly allied to the\r\n_Hippopotamidae_, of which they are in all probability the ancestral\r\nstock. They agree, for instance, with that family in the presence of a\r\ndescending flange at the hinder end of each side of the lower jaw; but\r\ntheir dentition is of a more generalized type, comprising the full\r\nseries of 44 teeth, among which the incisors and canines are of normal\r\nform, but specially enlarged, and developing roots in the usual manner.\r\nThe molars are partially selenodont in the typical genus\r\n_Anthracotherium_, with five cusps, or columns, on the crowns of those\r\nof the upper jaw, which are nearly square. The genus has a very wide\r\ndistribution, extending from Europe through Asia to North America, and\r\noccurring in strata which are of Oligocene and Miocene age. In _Ancodon_\r\n(_Hyopotamus_) the cusps on the molars are taller, so that the dentition\r\nis more decidedly selenodont; the distribution of this genus includes\r\nnot only Europe, Asia and North Africa, but also Egypt where it occurs\r\nin Upper Eocene beds in company with the European genus _Rhagatherium_,\r\nwhich is nearer _Anthracotherium._ On the other hand, in\r\n_Merycopotamus_, of the Lower Pliocene of India and Burma, the upper\r\nmolars have lost the fifth intermediate cusp of _Ancodon_; and thus,\r\nalthough highly selenodont, might be easily modified, by a kind of\r\nretrograde development, into the trefoil-columned molars of\r\n_Hippopotamus._ In the above genera, so far as is known, the feet were\r\nfour-toed, although with the lateral digits relatively small; but in\r\n_Elotherium_ (or _Entelodon_), from the Lower Miocene of Europe and the\r\nOligocene of North America, the two lateral digits in each foot had\r\ndisappeared. This is the more remarkable seeing that _Elotherium_ may be\r\nregarded as a kind of bunodont _Anthracotherium._ It shows the\r\ncharacteristic hippopotamus-flange to the lower jaw, but has also a\r\nlarge descending process from the jugal bone of the zygomatic arch of\r\nthe skull. Finally, we have in the Pliocene of India the genus\r\n_Tetraconodon_, remarkable for the enormous size attained by the bluntly\r\nconical premolars; as the molars are purely bunodont, this genus seems\r\nto be a late and specialized survivor of a primitive type.     (R. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISAN, or ARTIZAN, a mechanic; a handicraftsman in distinction to an\r\nartist. The English word (from Late Lat. _artitianus_, instructed in\r\narts) at one time meant \"artist,\" but has been restricted to signify the\r\noperative workman only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTOIS, an ancient province of the north of France, corresponding to the\r\npresent department of Pas de Calais, with the exclusion of the\r\narrondissements of Boulogne and Montreuil, which belonged to Picardy. It\r\nis a rich and well-watered country, producing abundance of grain and\r\nhops, and yielding excellent pasture for cattle. The capital of the\r\nprovince was Arras, and the other important places were Saint-Omer,\r\nBethune, Aire, Hesdin, Bapaume, Lens, Lillers, Saint-Pol and\r\nSaint-Venant. The name Artois (still more corrupted in \"Arras\") is\r\nderived from the Atrebates, who possessed the district in the time of\r\nCaesar. From the 9th to the 12th century Artois belonged to the counts\r\nof Flanders. It was bestowed in 1180 on Philip Augustus of France by\r\nPhilip of Alsace, as the dowry of his niece Isabella of Hainaut. At her\r\ndeath in 1190, Baldwin IX., count of Flanders (d. 1206), and then his\r\nson-in-law, Ferrand (Ferdinand) of Portugal, count of Flanders, disputed\r\nthe possession of the country with the king of France, Ferrand being in\r\nthe coalition which was overthrown by Philip Augustus at Bouvines\r\n(1214). In 1237 Artois, which was raised to a countship the following\r\nyear, was conferred as an appanage by Saint Louis on his brother\r\nRobert, who died on crusade in 1250. His son, Robert II., took part in\r\nthe wars in Navarre, Sicily, Guienne and Flanders, and was killed at the\r\nbattle of Courtrai in 1302. After his death, his son Philip having\r\npredeceased him (1298), Artois was adjudged to his daughter Mahaut, or\r\nMatilda, as against her nephew Robert, son of Philip, who attempted to\r\nsupport his claim to the countship by forged titles. Banished from\r\nFrance for this crime (1322), Robert of Artois took refuge in England,\r\nwhere he became earl of Richmond, and incited Edward III. to make war\r\nupon Philip of Valois. His descendants, the counts of Eu (q.v.),\r\ncontinued to style themselves counts of Artois. By the marriage of\r\nMahaut (d. 1329) with Otto IV., Artois passed to the house of Burgundy,\r\nin whose possession it remained till the marriage of Mary, the daughter\r\nof Charles the Bold, to the archduke Maximilian brought it to the house\r\nof Austria. Louis XI., however, occupied portions of Artois, and the\r\nclaims of Austria were contested by France until the treaty of Senlis\r\n(1493). The emperor Charles V. established the council of Artois, with\r\nsovereign authority. At the end of the Thirty Years' War Artois was\r\nagain conquered by the French, and the conquest was ratified in the\r\ntreaty of the Pyrenees (1659) by Spain, to whom the province had fallen\r\nin 1634. During the war between France and Holland (1672-77) and that of\r\nthe Spanish Succession. Artois was invaded again, but the treaties of\r\nNijmwegen (1678) and of Utrecht (1713) confirmed the sovereignty of\r\nFrance. The title of count of Artois was borne by Charles X. of France\r\nbefore his accession to the throne. This new creation became extinct on\r\nthe death of the comte de Chambord in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART SALES. The practice of selling objects of art by auction in England\r\ndates from the latter part of the 17th century, when in most cases the\r\nnames of the auctioneers were suppressed. Evelyn (under date June 21,\r\n1693) mentions a \"great auction of pictures (_Lord Melford's_) in the\r\nBanquetting House, Whitehall,\" and the practice is frequently referred\r\nto by other contemporary and later writers. Before the introduction of\r\nregular auctions the practice was, as in the case of the famous\r\ncollection formed by Charles I., to price each object and invite\r\npurchasers, just as in other departments of commerce. But this was a\r\nslow process, especially in the case of pictures, and lacked the\r\nincentive of excitement. The first really important art collection to\r\ncome under the hammer was that of Edward, earl of Oxford, dispersed by\r\nCock, under the Piazza, Covent Garden, on 8th March 1741/2 and the five\r\nfollowing days, six more days being required by the coins. Nearly all\r\nthe leading men of the day, including Horace Walpole, attended or were\r\nrepresented at this sale, and the prices varied from five shillings for\r\nan anonymous bishop's \"head\" to 165 guineas for Vandyck's group of \"Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, lady, and son.\" The next great dispersal was Dr Richard\r\nMead's extensive collection, of which the pictures, coins and gems, &c.,\r\nwere sold by Langford in February and March 1754, the sale realizing the\r\ntotal, unprecedented up to that time, of L16,069. The thirty-eight days'\r\nsale (1786) of the Duchess of Portland's collection is very noteworthy,\r\nfrom the fact that it included the celebrated Portland vase, now in the\r\nBritish Museum. Many other interesting and important 18th-century sales\r\nmight be mentioned. High prices did not become general until the\r\nCalonne, Trumbull (both 1795) and Bryan (1798) sales. As to the quality\r\nof the pictures which had been sold by auction up to the latter part of\r\nthe 18th century, it may be assumed that this was not high. The\r\nimportation of pictures and other objects of art had assumed extensive\r\nproportions by the end of the 18th century, but the genuine examples of\r\nthe Old Masters probably fell far short of 1%. England was felt to be\r\nthe only safe asylum for valuable articles, but the home which was\r\nintended to be temporary often became permanent. Had it not been for the\r\npolitical convulsions on the continent, England, instead of being one of\r\nthe richest countries in the world in art treasures, would have been one\r\nof the poorest. This fortuitous circumstance had, moreover, another\r\neffect, in that it greatly raised the critical knowledge of pictures.\r\nGenuine works realized high prices, as, for example, at Sir William\r\nHamilton's sale (1801), when Beckford paid 1300 guineas for the little\r\npicture of \"A Laughing Boy\" by Leonardo da Vinci; and when at the\r\nLafontaine sales (1807 and 1811) two Rembrandts each realized 5000\r\nguineas, \"The Woman taken in Adultery,\" now in the National Gallery, and\r\n\"The Master Shipbuilder,\" now at Buckingham Palace. The Beckford sale of\r\n1823 (41 days, L43,869) was the forerunner of the great art dispersal of\r\nthe 19th century; Horace Walpole's accumulation at Strawberry Hill, 1842\r\n(24 days, L33,450), and the Stowe collection, 1848 (41 days, L75,562),\r\nwere also celebrated. They comprised every phase of art work, and in all\r\nthe quality was of a very high order. They acted as a most healthy\r\nstimulus to art collecting, a stimulus which was further nourished by\r\nthe sales of the superb collection of Ralph Bernal in 1855 (32 days,\r\nL62,690), and of the almost equally fine but not so comprehensive\r\ncollection of Samuel Rogers, 1856 (18 days, L42,367). Three years later\r\ncame the dispersal of the 1500 pictures which formed Lord Northwick's\r\ngallery at Cheltenham (pictures and works of art, 18 days, L94,722).\r\n\r\nTowards the latter part of the first half of the 19th century an\r\nentirely new race of collectors gradually came into existence; they were\r\nfor the most part men who had made, or were making, large fortunes in\r\nthe various industries of the midlands and north of England and other\r\ncentres. They were untrammelled by \"collecting\" traditions, and their\r\npatronage was almost exclusively extended to the artists of the day. The\r\ndispersals of these collections began in 1863 with the Bicknell Gallery,\r\nand continued at irregular intervals for many years, e.g. Gillott\r\n(1872), Mendel (1875), Wynn Ellis and Albert Levy (1876), Albert Grant\r\n(1877) and Munro of Novar (1878). These patrons purchased at munificent\r\nprices either direct from the easel or from the exhibitions not only\r\npictures in oils but also water-colour drawings. As a matter of\r\ninvestment their purchases frequently realized far more than the\r\noriginal outlay; sometimes, however, the reverse happened, as, for\r\ninstance, in the case of Landseer's \"Otter Hunt,\" for which Baron Grant\r\nis said to have paid L10,000 and which realized shortly afterwards only\r\n5650 guineas. One of the features of the sales of the 'seventies was the\r\nhigh appreciation of water-colour drawings. At the Gillott sale (1872)\r\n160 examples realized L27,423, Turner's \"Bamborough Castle\" fetching\r\n3150 gns.; at the Quilter sale (1875) David Cox's \"Hayfield,\" for which\r\na dealer paid him 50 gns. in 1850, brought 2810 gns. The following are\r\nthe most remarkable prices of later years. In 1895 Cox's \"Welsh Funeral\"\r\n(which cost about L20) sold for 2400 gns., and Burne-Jones's\r\n\"Hesperides\" for 2460 gns. In 1908, 13 Turner drawings fetched L12,415\r\n(Acland-Hood sale) and 7 brought L11,077 (Holland sale), the\r\n\"Heidelberg\" reaching 4200 gns. For Fred Walker's \"Harbour of Refuge\"\r\n2580 gns. were paid (Tatham sale) and 2700 gns. for his \"Marlow Ferry\"\r\n(Holland). The demand for pictures by modern artists, whose works sold\r\nat almost fabulous prices in the 'seventies, has somewhat declined; but\r\nduring all its _furore_ there was still a small band of collectors to\r\nwhom the works of the Old Masters more especially appealed. The\r\ndispersal of such collections as the Bredel (1875), Watts Russell\r\n(1875), Foster of Clewer Manor (1876), the Hamilton Palace (17 days,\r\nL397,562)--the greatest art sale in the annals of Great Britain--Bale\r\n(1882), Leigh Court (1884), and Dudley (1892) resulted, as did the sale\r\nof many minor collections each season, in many very fine works of the\r\nOld Masters finding eager purchasers at high prices. A striking example\r\nof the high prices given was the L24,250 realized by the pair of Vandyck\r\nportraits of a Genoese senator and his wife in the Peel sale, 1900.\r\n\r\nSince the last quarter of the 19th century the chief feature in art\r\nsales has been the demand for works, particularly female portraits, by\r\nReynolds, his contemporaries and successors. This may be traced to the\r\nSouth Kensington Exhibitions of 1867 and 1868 and the annual winter\r\nexhibitions at Burlington House, which revealed an unsuspected wealth\r\nand charm in the works of many English artists who had almost fallen\r\ninto oblivion. A few of the most remarkable prices for such pictures may\r\nbe quoted: Reynolds's \"Lady Betty Delme\" (1894), 11,000 gns.; Romney's\r\n\"The Ladies Spencer\" (1896), 10,500 gns.; Gainsborough's \"Duchess of\r\nDevonshire\" (1876), 10,100 gns. (for the history of its disappearance\r\nsee GAINSBOROUGH, THOMAS), \"Maria Walpole,\" 12,100 gns. (Duke of\r\nCambridge's sale, 1904); Constable's \"Stratford Mill\" (1895), 8500 gns.;\r\nHoppner's \"Lady Waldegrave\" (1906), 6000 gns.; Lawrence's \"Childhood's\r\nInnocence\" (1907), 8000 gns.; Raeburn's \"Lady Raeburn\" (1905), 8500 gns.\r\nHere may also be mentioned the 12,600 gns. paid for Turner's \"Mortlake\r\nTerrace\" in 1908 (Holland sale).\r\n\r\nThe \"appreciation\" of the modern continental schools, particularly the\r\nFrench, has been marked since 1880; of high prices paid may be mentioned\r\nCorot's \"Danse des Amours\" (1898), L7200; Rosa Bonheur's \"Denizens of\r\nthe Highlands\" (1888), 5550 gns.; Jules Breton's \"First Communion,\"\r\nL9100 in New York (1886); Meissonier's \"Napoleon I. in the Campaign of\r\nParis,\" 12-1/4 in. by 9-1/4 in. (1882), 5800 gns., and \"The Sign Painter\"\r\n(1891), 6450 gns. High prices are also fetched by pictures of Daubigny,\r\nFortuny, Gallait, Gerome, Troyon and Israels. The most marked feature of\r\nlate has been the demand for the 18th-century painters Watteau, Boucher,\r\nFragonard, Pater and Lancret; thus \"La Ronde Champetre\" of the last\r\nnamed brought L11,200 at the Say Sale in 1908, and Fragonard's \"Le\r\nReveil de Venus\" L5520 at the Sedelmeyer sale, 1907.\r\n\r\n\"Specialism\" is the one important development in art collecting which\r\nhas manifested itself since the middle of the 19th century. This\r\naccounts for and explains the high average quality of the Wellesley\r\n(1866), the Buccleuch (1888) and the Holford (1893) collections of\r\ndrawings by the Old Masters; for the Sibson Wedgwood (1877), the Duc de\r\nForli Dresden (1877), the Shuldham blue and white porcelain (1880), the\r\nBenson collection of antique coins (1909), and for the objects of art at\r\nthe Massey-Mainwaring and Lewis-Hill sales of 1907. Very many other\r\nillustrations in nearly every department of art collecting might be\r\nquoted--the superb series of Marlborough gems (1875 and 1899) might be\r\nincluded in this category but for the fact that it was formed chiefly in\r\nthe 18th century. The appreciation--commercially at all events--of\r\nmezzotint portraits and of portraits printed in colours, after masters\r\nof the early English school, was one of the most remarkable features in\r\nart sales during the last years of the 19th century. The shillings of\r\nfifty years before were then represented by pounds. The Fraser\r\ncollection (December 4 to 6, 1900) realized about ten times the original\r\noutlay, the mezzotint of the \"Sisters Frankland,\" after Hoppner, by W.\r\nWard, selling for 290 guineas as against 10 guineas paid for it about\r\nthirty years previously. The H.A. Blyth sale (March 11 to 13, 1901, 346\r\nlots, L21,717: 10s.) of mezzotint portraits was even more remarkable,\r\nand as a collection it was the choicest sold within recent times, the\r\nengravings being mostly in the first state. The record prices were\r\nnumerous, and, in many cases, far surpassed the prices which Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds received for the original pictures; e.g. the exceptionally fine\r\nexample of the first state of the \"Duchess of Rutland,\" after Reynolds,\r\nby V. Green, realized 1000 guineas, whereas the artist received only\r\nL150 for the painting itself. Even this unprecedented price for a\r\nmezzotint portrait was exceeded on the 30th of April 1901, when an\r\nexample of the first published state of \"Mrs Carnac,\" after Reynolds, by\r\nJ.R. Smith, sold for 1160 guineas. At the Louis Huth sale (1905) 83 lots\r\nbrought nearly L10,000, Reynolds's \"Lady Bampfylde\" by T. Watson, first\r\nstate before letters, unpublished, fetching 1200 guineas. Such prices as\r\nthese and many others which might be quoted are exceptional, but they\r\nwere paid for objects of exceptional rarity or quality.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to pursue the chronicle of recent sales, which have\r\nbecome a feature of every season. It is worth mentioning, however, that\r\nthe Holland sale, in June 1908, realized L138,118 (432 lots), a \"record\"\r\nsum for a collection of pictures mainly by modern artists; and that for\r\nthe Rodolphe Kann collection (Paris) of pictures and objects of art,\r\nincluding 11 magnificent Rembrandts, Messrs Duveen paid L1,000,000 in\r\n1907. In every direction there has been a tendency to increase prices\r\nfor really great artistic pieces, even to a sensational extent. The\r\ncompetition has become acute, largely owing to American and German\r\nacquisitiveness. The demand for the finest works of art of all\r\ndescriptions is much greater than the supply. As an illustration of the\r\nmagnitude of the art sale business it may be mentioned that the\r\n\"turnover\" of one firm in London alone has occasionally exceeded\r\nL1,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The chief compilations dealing with art sales in Great\r\n  Britain are: G. Redford, _Art Sales_ (1888); and W. Roberts,\r\n  _Memorials of Christie's_ (1897); whilst other books containing much\r\n  important matter are W. Buchanan, _Memoirs of Painting_; _The Year's\r\n  Art_ (1880 and each succeeding year); F.S. Robinson, _The\r\n  Connoisseur_; and L. Soullie, _Les Ventes de tableaux, dessins et\r\n  objets d'art au XIX^e siecle_ (chiefly French).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTS AND CRAFTS, a comprehensive title for the arts of decorative design\r\nand handicraft--all those which, in association with the mother-craft of\r\nbuilding (or architecture), go to the making of the house beautiful.\r\nAccounts of these will be found under separate headings. \"Arts and\r\ncrafts\" are also associated with the movement generally understood as\r\nthe English revival of decorative art, which began about 1875. The title\r\nitself only came into general use when the Arts and Crafts Exhibition\r\nSociety was founded, and held its first exhibition at the New Gallery,\r\nLondon, in the autumn of 1888, since which time arts and crafts\r\nexhibitions have been common all over Great Britain. The idea of forming\r\na society for the purpose of showing contemporary work in design and\r\nhandicraft really arose out of a movement of revolt or protest against\r\nthe exclusive view of art encouraged by the Royal Academy exhibitions,\r\nin which oil paintings in gilt frames claimed almost exclusive\r\nattention--sculpture, architecture and the arts of decorative design\r\nbeing relegated to quite subordinate positions. In 1886, out of a\r\nfeeling of discontent among artists as to the inadequacy of the Royal\r\nAcademy exhibitions, considered as representing the art of Great\r\nBritain, a demand arose for a national exhibition to include all the\r\narts of design. One of the points of this demand was for the annual\r\nelection of the hanging committee by the whole body of artists. After\r\nmany meetings the group representing the arts and crafts (who belonged\r\nto a larger body of artists and craftsmen called the Art-workers' Guild,\r\nfounded in 1884),[1] perceiving that the painters, especially the\r\nleading group of a school not hitherto well represented in the Academy\r\nexhibitions, only cherished the hope of forcing certain reforms on the\r\nAcademy, and were by no means prepared to lose their chances of\r\nadmission to its privileges, still less to run any risk in the\r\nestablishment of a really comprehensive national exhibition of art,\r\ndecided to organize an exhibition themselves in which artists and\r\ncraftsmen might show their productions, so that contemporary work in\r\ndecorative art should be displayed to the public on the same footing,\r\nand with the same advantages as had hitherto been monopolized by\r\npictorial art. For many years previously there had been great activity\r\nin the study and revival in the practice of many of the neglected\r\ndecorative handicrafts. Amateur societies and classes were in existence,\r\nlike the Home Arts and Industries Association, which had established\r\nvillage classes in wood-carving, metal work, spinning and weaving,\r\nneedlework, pottery and basket-work, and the public interest in\r\nhandicraft was steadily growing. The machine production of an industrial\r\ncentury had laid its iron hands upon what had formerly been the\r\nexclusive province of the handicraftsman, who only lingered on in a few\r\nobscure trades and in forgotten corners of England for the most part.\r\nThe ideal of mechanical perfection dominated British workmen, and the\r\nfactory system, first by extreme division of labour, and then by the\r\nfurther specialization of the workman under machine production, left no\r\nroom for individual artistic feeling among craftsmen trained and working\r\nunder such conditions. The demand of the world-market ruled the\r\ncharacter and quality of production, and to the few who would seek some\r\nhumanity, simplicity of construction or artistic feeling in their\r\ndomestic decorations and furniture, the only choice was that of the\r\ntradesman or salesman, or a plunge into costly and doubtful experiments\r\nin original design. From the 'forties onward there had been much\r\nresearch and study of medieval art in England; there had been many able\r\ndesigners, architects and antiquaries, such as the Pugins and Henry Shaw\r\n(1800-1873) and later William Burges (1827-1881), William Butterfield\r\n(1814-1900) and G.E. Street and others. The school of pre-Raphaelite\r\npainters, by their careful and thorough methods, and their sympathy with\r\nmedieval design, were among the first to turn attention to beauty of\r\ndesign, colour and significance in the accessories of daily life, and\r\nartists like D.G. Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown, and W. Holman Hunt\r\nthemselves designed and painted furniture. The most successful and most\r\npractical effort indeed towards the revival of sounder ideas of\r\nconstruction and workmanship may be said to have arisen out of the work\r\nof this group of artists, and may be traced to the workshop of William\r\nMorris and his associates in Queen Square, London. William Morris, whose\r\nname covers so large a field of artistic as well as literary and social\r\nwork, came well equipped to his task of raising the arts of design and\r\nhandicraft, of changing the taste of his countrymen from the corrupt and\r\nvulgar ostentation of the Second Empire, and its cheap imitations, which\r\nprevailed in the 'fifties and 'sixties, and of winning them back, for a\r\ntime at least, to the massive simplicity of plain oak furniture, or the\r\ndelicate beauty of inlays of choice woods, or the charm of painted work,\r\nthe richness and frank colour of formal floral and heraldic pattern in\r\nsilk textiles and wall-hangings and carpets, the gaiety and freshness of\r\nprinted cotton, or the romantic splendour of arras tapestry. Both\r\nWilliam Morris and his artistic comrade and lifelong friend, Edward\r\nBurne-Jones, were no doubt much influenced at the outset by the\r\nimaginative insight, the passionate artistic feeling, and the love of\r\nmedieval romance and colour of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who remains so\r\nremarkable a figure in the great artistic and poetic revival of the\r\nlatter half of the 19th century. To William Morris himself, in his\r\nartistic career, it was no small advantage to gain the ear of the\r\nEnglish public first by his poetry. His verse-craft helped his\r\nhandicraft, but both lived side by side. The secret of Morris's great\r\ninfluence in the revival was no doubt to be attributed to his way of\r\npersonally mastering the working details and handling of each craft he\r\ntook up in turn, as well as to his power of inspiring his helpers and\r\nfollowers. He was painter, designer, scribe, illuminator, wood-engraver,\r\ndyer, weaver and finally printer and papermaker, and having mastered\r\nthese crafts he could effectively direct and criticize the work of\r\nothers. His own work and that of Burne-Jones were well known to the\r\npublic, and in high favour long before the Arts and Crafts Exhibition\r\nSociety was formed, and though largely helped and inspired by the work\r\nof these two artists, the aims and objects of the society rather\r\nrepresented those of a younger generation, and were in some measure a\r\nfresh development both of the social and the artistic ideas which were\r\nrepresented by Ruskin, Rossetti and Morris, though the society includes\r\nmen of different schools. Other sources of influence might be named,\r\nsuch as the work of Norman Shaw and Philip Webb in architecture and\r\ndecoration, of Lewis Day in surface pattern, and William de Morgan in\r\npottery. The demand for the acknowledgment of the personality of each\r\nresponsible craftsman in a co-operative work was new, and it had direct\r\nbearing upon the social and economic conditions of artistic production.\r\nThe principle, too, of regarding the material, object, method and\r\npurpose of a work as essential conditions of its artistic expression,\r\nthe form and character of which must always be controlled by such\r\nconditions, had never before been so emphatically stated, though it\r\npractically endorsed the somewhat vague aspirations current for the\r\nunity of beauty with utility. Again, a very notable return to extreme\r\nsimplicity of design in furniture and surface decoration may be\r\nremarked; and a certain reserve in the use of colour and ornament, and a\r\nlove of abstract forms in decoration generally, which are characteristic\r\nof later taste. Not less remarkable has been the new development in the\r\ndesign and workmanship of jewelry, gold- and silversmiths' work, and\r\nenamels, with which the names of Alexander Fisher, Henry Wilson, Nelson\r\nDawson and C.R. Ashbee are associated. Among the arts and crafts of\r\ndesign which have blossomed into new life in recent years-and there is\r\nhardly one which has not been touched by the new spirit--book-binding\r\nmust be named as having attained a fresh and tasteful development\r\nthrough the work of Mr Cobden-Sanderson and his pupils. The art and\r\ncraft of the needle also must not be forgotten, and its progress is a\r\ngood criterion of taste in design, choice of colour and treatment. The\r\nwork of Mrs Morris, of Miss Burden (sometime instructress at the Royal\r\nSchool of Art Needlework, which has carried on its work from 1875), of\r\nMiss May Morris, of Miss Una Taylor, of Miss Buckle, of Mrs Walter\r\nCrane, of Mrs Newbery, besides many other skilled needlewomen, has been\r\nfrequently exhibited. Good work is often seen in the national\r\ncompetition works of the students of the English art schools, shown at\r\nSouth Kensington in July. The increase of late years in these\r\nexhibitions of designs worked out in the actual material for which they\r\nwere intended is very remarkable, and is an evidence of the spread of\r\nthe arts and crafts movement (fostered no doubt by the increase of\r\ntechnical schools, especially of the type of the Central School of Arts\r\nand Crafts under the Technical Education Board of the London County\r\nCouncil), of which it may be said that if it has not turned all British\r\ncraftsmen into artists or all British artists into craftsmen, it had\r\ndone not a little to expand and socialize the idea of art, and (perhaps\r\nit is not too much to say) has made the tasteful English house with its\r\nfurniture and decorations a model for the civilized world.     (W. Cr.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Whose members, comprehending as they do the principal living\r\n    designers, architects, painters and craftsmen of all kinds, have\r\n    played no inconsiderable part in the English revival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART SOCIETIES. In banding themselves into societies and associations\r\nartists have always been especially remarkable. The fundamental motive\r\nof such leaguing together is apparent, for, by the establishment of\r\nsocieties, it becomes possible for the working members of these to hold\r\nexhibitions and thereby to obtain some compensation or reward for their\r\nlabours. With the growth of artistic practice and public interest,\r\nhowever, art societies have been instituted where this primary object is\r\neither absent or is allied to others of more general scope. The\r\nfurtherance of a cult and the specializing of work have also given rise\r\nto many new associations in Great Britain, besides the Royal Academy\r\n(see ACADEMY, ROYAL). At the outset, therefore, it will be well to\r\nmention the leading art societies thus described. The (now Royal)\r\nSociety of Painters in Water Colours, founded in 1804, and the (now\r\nRoyal) Society of British Artists (1823), are typical of those societies\r\nwhich exist merely for purposes of holding exhibitions and conferring\r\ndiplomas of membership. The British Institution (for the encouragement\r\nof British artists) was started in 1806 on a plan formed by Sir Thomas\r\nBernard; and in the gallery, erected by Alderman Boydell to exhibit the\r\npaintings executed for his edition of Shakespeare, were from time to\r\ntime exhibited pictures by the old masters, deceased British artists and\r\nothers, till 1867, when the lease of the premises expired. A fund of\r\nL16,200, then in the hands of trustees, had accumulated to L24,610 in\r\n1884. The Artists' Society, formed in 1830, has for its object the\r\nproviding of facilities to enable its members to perfect themselves in\r\ntheir art. To this end there is a good library of works on art, and\r\nabundant opportunities are afforded for general study from the life. In\r\nthe furtherance of a cult the Japan Society, devoted to the\r\nencouragement of the study of the arts and industries of Japan, is a\r\ntypical example; and the Society of Mezzotint Engravers is\r\nrepresentative of those bodies formed in the interests of particular\r\ngroups of workers. One of the remarkable features in the history of art\r\nin Great Britain has been the rapid increase of the artistic rank and\r\nfile. Taking the number of exhibitors at the principal London and\r\nprovincial exhibitions, it is found that in the period 1885-1900 the\r\nranks were doubled. At the end of the 19th century it was estimated that\r\nthere were quite 7000 practising artists. Coincident with this\r\nastonishing development there has been a corresponding addition of new\r\nart societies and the enlargement of older bodies. For instance, the\r\nmembership of the Royal Society of British Artists advanced in the\r\nperiod mentioned from 80 to 150. Similar extensions can be noted in\r\nother societies, or in such a case as that of the Royal Institute of\r\nPainters in Water Colours, where the membership is limited to 100, it\r\nis to be noticed that more space is given to the works of outsiders. But\r\nthe expansion of older exhibiting societies has not proved sufficient.\r\nPortrait painters, pastellists, designers, miniaturists and women\r\nartists have felt the necessity of forming separate coteries.\r\nInteresting though these movements from within may be, the growth of\r\nsocieties originating in the spirit of altruism associated with such\r\nnames as Ruskin and Kyrle is equally instructive. Nearly all these are\r\nthe products of the last quarter of the 19th century, and include the\r\nSunday Society, which in 1896 secured the Sunday opening of the national\r\nmuseums and galleries in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe specializing of study and work has also given rise to much artistic\r\nendeavour. For a long time archaeology--British and Egyptian--claimed\r\nalmost exclusive attention. Latterly the arts of India and Japan have\r\nengaged much notice, and societies have been organized to further their\r\nstudy. Finally, bands of workers in particular branches of art have felt\r\nthe need of clubbing together in order to protect their special\r\ninterests. A slight suspicion of trade-unionism is attached to some of\r\nthese; but on the whole the establishment of such bodies as the Society\r\nof Illustrators, the Society of Designers, and the Society of Mezzotint\r\nEngravers has been with a view to advancing the public knowledge of the\r\nmerits of these branches of artistic enterprise.\r\n\r\nEXHIBITING SOCIETIES.--(a) Old Established. These in London are: The\r\nRoyal Academy, the Royal Water Colour Society, the Royal Institute of\r\nPainters in Water Colours, the Society of Oil Painters, and the Royal\r\nSociety of British Artists. In the provinces, the Birmingham Royal\r\nSociety of Artists has been in existence since 1825, and has a life\r\nacademy with professors attached. (b) Modern.--In this category are many\r\nwhich reflect the new spirit which came into artistic life in the last\r\nquarter of the 19th century. The New English Art Club, founded in 1885\r\nas a protest against academic art, achieves its purpose by exhibition\r\nonly. The International Society of Painters and Engravers, again,\r\nrepresents the wider ideas of the 20th century. The Royal Society of\r\nPainter-Etchers and Engravers, consisting of fellows and associates, not\r\nexceeding 150 in all, conserves the interests of a numerous body of\r\nworkers, and, in addition to holding exhibitions, confers diplomas (R.E.\r\nand A.R.E.) on the exhibitors of meritorious etchings or engravings. The\r\nSociety of Women Artists (formerly the Society of Lady Artists) is\r\nwholly devoted to the display of works by female artists, and in 1891\r\nthe Society of Portrait Painters was formed to carry out the object\r\nconveyed in its title. Two associations advance the art of the\r\nminiature-painter, and the Pastel Society, formed in 1898, holds\r\ndisplays of members' work at the Royal Institute Galleries. In Scotland\r\nthere is the Royal Scottish Academy. The Royal Scottish Society of\r\nPainters in Water Colours (Glasgow) grants the title R.S.W. to its\r\nmembers, and the Society of Scottish Artists (Edinburgh), founded in\r\n1891, has a membership of nearly 500 young artists. Other exhibiting\r\nsocieties which call for mention are: The Yorkshire Union of Artists\r\n(Leeds), which consolidates many local societies; the Nottingham Society\r\nof Artists, which also encourages drawing from the living model; and the\r\nLiverpool Sketching Club, founded in 1870, which holds an annual\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nSOCIETIES OF INSTRUCTION AND POPULAR ENCOURAGEMENT.--It is under this\r\nhead that the chief evidence of the modern art revival will be found.\r\nFirst it should be noted that there are very few societies designed for\r\nthe artistic improvement of artists. The Artists' Society has already\r\nbeen mentioned; and the Art Workers' Guild, which meets at Clifford's\r\nInn Hall, provides meetings, from which the public is excluded, where\r\nprofitable discussions take place on questions of craft and design. But,\r\nas a rule, the art society, of which only artists are members, is\r\norganized for exhibition purposes or for the protection of interests.\r\nWith regard to those societies of popular and educational intention the\r\nold Society of Arts in the Adelphi, founded in 1754, enjoys a good\r\nrecord. Numerous lectures on art subjects have from time to time been\r\ngiven, and in 1887 a scheme was devised by which awards are made to\r\nstudent-workers in design. The Society for the Encouragement of the Fine\r\nArts (Conduit Street) has also laboured since its foundation in 1858 to\r\nincrease a technical knowledge, its members holding conversazioni at\r\nvarious picture galleries. The Artists' and Amateurs' Conversazione,\r\ninstituted in 1831, which used to meet at the Piccadilly Galleries and\r\nis now defunct, carried out a similar plan. Two other societies, now\r\nobsolete, should be mentioned whose method were directly educational.\r\nThe Arundel Society, which for many years promoted the knowledge of art\r\nby copying and publishing important works of ancient masters, issued to\r\nits members on payment of annual subscriptions, was eventually wound up\r\non the last day of 1897. The Arundel Club, founded in 1904, continues\r\nthe aim, but with a wider scope, reproducing works of art rendered\r\nsomewhat inaccessible by being in private collections. The International\r\nChalcographical Society, formed for the study of the early history of\r\nengraving, also did useful work. Another association of painters,\r\nsculptors, architects and engravers, the Graphic Society, ceased on the\r\n29th of October 1890. This was one of the most interesting of societies,\r\nrare works of art being exhibited and discussed at its meetings. A very\r\nactive educational body, originated in 1888, namely the Royal Drawing\r\nSociety, has for its definite object the teaching of drawing as a means\r\nof education. The methods of instruction are based on the facts that\r\nvery young children try to draw before they can write, and that they\r\nhave very keen perception and retentive memory. The society aims,\r\ntherefore, at using drawing as a means of developing these innate\r\ncharacteristics of the young, and already nearly 300 important schools\r\nfollow out its system. Lord Leighton, Sir John Millais, and Sir Edward\r\nBurne-Jones took an active part in the society's labours. The Art for\r\nSchools Association, founded in 1883, has also done steady work in\r\nendeavouring to provide schools with works of art. These are chiefly\r\nreproductions of standard works of art or of historical and natural\r\nsubjects. The wave of enthusiasm aroused by Mr Ruskin's teachings caused\r\nSocieties of the Rose to be founded in London, Manchester, Sheffield,\r\nBirmingham, Aberdeen and Glasgow; but some of these eventually ceased\r\nactive work, to be revived again, however, by the Ruskin Union, formed\r\nin the year of the great writer's death (1900). Most of these societies\r\nwere formed in 1879; but it should not be forgotten that two years\r\nearlier the Kyrle Society was started with the object of bringing the\r\nrefining and cheering influences of natural and artistic beauty to the\r\nhomes of the people. Under the presidency of Earl Brownlow, the Home\r\nArts and Industries Association continues a work which was started in\r\n1884, and anticipated much of the present system of technical education.\r\nVoluntary teachers organize classes for working people, at which a\r\npractical knowledge of art handiwork is taught. Training classes for\r\nvoluntary teachers are held at the studios at the Albert Hall, as well\r\nas an annual exhibition. An interesting type of society has been\r\nestablished in Bolton, Lancashire. Under the title of an Arts Guild the\r\nmembers, numbering over 200, devote themselves to the advancement of\r\ntaste in municipal improvements.\r\n\r\nSOCIETIES OF SPECIAL STUDY, PRACTICE AND PROTECTION.--Under this head\r\nshould be placed those associations which affect a cult, or are composed\r\nof particular workers, or which protect public or private interests.\r\nPerhaps the chief of the first kind is the Japan Society, which, since\r\nits inception in 1892, has been joined by over 1350 members interested\r\nin matters relating to Japanese art and industries. The Durer Society,\r\nformed in 1897, has for its main object the reproduction of works by\r\nAlbrecht Durer, and his German and Italian contemporaries. The Vasari\r\nSociety, founded in 1905, works in harmony with the Arundel Club and the\r\nDurer Society, reproducing drawings by the Old Masters. In this category\r\nof special study may also be placed the Society for the Encouragement\r\nand Preservation of Indian Art, the Egypt Exploration Fund, and the\r\nSociety for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. Of the societies of\r\nspecial practice it has already been noticed that some are purely\r\nexhibiting associations, such as the Portrait Painters, the Pastel\r\nSociety, and the two miniature bodies. The formation of the Society of\r\nMezzotint Engravers in 1898 is an example of the leaguing together of\r\nparticular workers to call attention to their interests. Original and\r\ntranslator engravers, together with collectors and connoisseurs,\r\ncomprise the membership. The decaying art of wood engraving is also\r\nfostered by the International Society of Wood Engravers, and the Society\r\nof Designers, founded in 1896, safeguards the interests of professional\r\ndesigners for applied art, without holding exhibitions. Special practice\r\nand protection are also considered by the Society of Illustrators,\r\ncomposed of artists who work in black and white for the illustrated\r\npress. This society was inaugurated in 1894, and fifteen of the members\r\nof the committee must be active workers in illustration. As an instance\r\nof the tendency of art workers to combine, the Society of Art Masters is\r\na good illustration. This is an association of teachers of art schools,\r\ncontrolled by the art branch of the Board of Education, and has a\r\nmembership of over 300. Good work of another kind occupies the National\r\nTrust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. The council of\r\nthe Trust includes representatives of such bodies as the National\r\nGallery, the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of Painters in Water\r\nColours, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Institute of British\r\nArchitects, the Universities, Kyrle Society, Society for the Protection\r\nof Ancient Buildings and the Selborne Society.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN ART SOCIETIES.--The following are brief particulars of the chief\r\nart societies elsewhere than in Great Britain:--\r\n\r\n  AUSTRIA.--Vienna, _Vereinigung bildender Kunstler Osterreichs_\r\n  (Society of Austrian Painters) and the _Wiener Kunstlergenossenschaft_\r\n  (Association of Viennese Artists).\r\n\r\n  BELGIUM.--Brussels, _Societe des beaux-arts_, the _Libre Esthetique_,\r\n  _Societe des aquarellistes et pastellistes_, _Societe royale beige des\r\n  aquarellistes_, and numerous private societies (_cercles_) in\r\n  Brussels, Antwerp, Liege, Ghent and other cities.\r\n\r\n  FRANCE.--Paris, the _Societe des artistes francais_ (The Salon),\r\n  _Societe nationale des beaux-arts_ (The New Salon), _Societe des\r\n  aquarellistes_. Exhibiting societies are the _Societe des artistes\r\n  independants_, _Societe des orientalistes_, and _Salon des\r\n  pastellistes_.\r\n\r\n  GERMANY.--The small local societies are affiliated to one large parent\r\n  body, the _Deutsche Kunstlergenossenschaft_, in Berlin under the\r\n  presidency of Anton von Werner. The _Deutsche Illustratoren-verband_\r\n  watches over the interests of illustrators and designers. In Munich\r\n  there are two bodies--the _Kunstlergenossenschaft_ (old society of\r\n  artists), holding its exhibitions in the Glaspalast, and the _Verein\r\n  bildender Kunstler_, the Secessionists.\r\n\r\n  ITALY.--Four exhibiting societies: Rome, _Societa in Arte Libertas_,\r\n  _Scuola degli Aquarellisti_; Milan, _Famiglia Artistica_, _Societa\r\n  degli Artiste_; Florence, _Circolo Artistico_; Naples, _Instituti di\r\n  Belli Arti._\r\n\r\n  PORTUGAL.--_Sociedade promotora das Bellas-Artes_ and _Gremio\r\n  Artistico_.\r\n\r\n  RUSSIA.--There is no exclusively art society of importance, but there\r\n  is at St Petersburg the _Societe litteraire et artistique_.\r\n\r\n  SPAIN.--Madrid, _L'Association des artistes espagnols_.\r\n\r\n  SWEDEN.--Stockholm, _Svenska Konstuareruas Forening_.\r\n\r\n  SWITZERLAND.--Berne, _La Societe des peintres et sculpteurs suisses_.\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES.--New York, National Academy of Design, American Water\r\n  Color Society, and National Sculpture Society. (A. C. R. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART TEACHING. It is the tendency of all departments of the human mind to\r\noutgrow their original limits. Traditions of teaching are long-lived,\r\nespecially in art, and new ideas only slowly displace the old, so that\r\nart teaching as a whole is seldom abreast of the ideas and practice of\r\nthe more advanced artists. The old academic system adapted to the\r\nmethods and aims in art in the 18th century, which has been carried on\r\nin the principal art schools of Great Britain with but slight changes of\r\nmethod, consisted chiefly of a course of drawing from casts of antique\r\nstatues in outline, and in light and shade without backgrounds, of\r\nanatomical drawings, perspective, and drawing and painting from the\r\nliving model. Such a training seems to be more or less a response to\r\nLessing's definition of painting as \"the imitation of solid bodies upon\r\na plane surface.\" It seems to have been influenced more by the\r\nsculptor's art than any other. Indeed, the academic teaching from the\r\ntime of the Italian Renaissance was no doubt principally derived from\r\nthe study of antique sculpture; the proportions of the figure, the\r\nstyle, pose, and sentiment being all taken from Graeco-Roman and Roman\r\nsculptures, discovered so abundantly in Italy from the 16th century\r\nonwards. As British ideas of art were principally derived from Italy,\r\nBritish academics endeavoured to follow the methods of teaching in vogue\r\nthere in later times, and so the art student in Great Britain has had\r\nhis intention and efforts directed almost exclusively to the\r\nrepresentations of the abstract human form in abstract relief.\r\nTraditions in art, however, may sometimes prove helpful and beneficial,\r\nand preservative of beauty and character, as in the case of certain\r\ndecorative and constructive arts and handicrafts in common use, such as\r\nthose of the rural waggon-maker and wheelwright, and horse-harness\r\nmaker.\r\n\r\nSome schools of painting, sculpture and architecture have preserved fine\r\nand noble traditions which yet allowed for individuality. Such\r\ntraditions may be said to have been characteristic of the art of the\r\nmiddle ages. It often happens, too, when many streams of artistic\r\ninfluence meet, there may be a certain domination or ascendancy of the\r\ntraditions of one art over the others, which is injurious in its effects\r\non those arts and diverts them from their true path. The domination of\r\nindividualistic painting and sculpture over the arts of design during\r\nthe last century or two is a case in point.\r\n\r\nWith the awakening of interest in industrial art--sharply separated by\r\npedantic classification from fine art--which began in England about the\r\nmiddle of the 19th century, schools of design were established which\r\nincluded more varied studies. Even as early as 1836 a government grant\r\nwas made towards the opening of public galleries and the establishment\r\nof a normal school of design with a museum and lectures, and in 1837 the\r\nfirst school of design was opened at Somerset House. In 1840 grants were\r\nmade to establish schools of the same kind in provincial towns, such as\r\nManchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and Paisley. The names of G.\r\nWallis in 1847, and Ambrose Poynter in 1850, are associated with schemes\r\nof art instruction adopted in the government art schools, and the year\r\n1851, the year of the Great Exhibition, was also marked by the first\r\npublic exhibition of students' works, and the first institution of\r\nprizes and scholarships. In 1852 \"the Department of Practical Art\" was\r\nconstituted, and a museum of objects collected at Marlborough House\r\nwhich afterwards formed the nucleus of the future museum at South\r\nKensington. In 1853 \"the Department of Science and Art\" was established,\r\nand in 1857, under the auspices of Henry Cole, the offices of the\r\ndepartment and the National Art Training School were removed from\r\nMarlborough House to South Kensington. Classes for instruction in\r\nvarious crafts had been carried on both at Somerset House and\r\nMarlborough House, and the whole object of the government schools of\r\ndesign was to give an artistic training to the designer and craftsman,\r\nso that he could carry back to his trade or craft improved taste and\r\nskill. The schools, however, became largely filled by students of\r\nanother type--leisured amateurs who sought to acquire some artistic\r\naccomplishment, and even in the case of genuine designers and craftsmen\r\nwho developed pictorial skill in their studies, the attraction and\r\nsuperior social distinction and possibility of superior commercial value\r\naccruing to the career of a painter of easel pictures diverted the\r\nschools from their original purpose.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the removal to South Kensington, during the progress\r\nof the new buildings, and under the direction of Godfrey Sykes and F.W.\r\nMoody, practical decorative work both in modelling and painting was\r\ncarried out in the National Art Training School; but on the completion\r\nof these works, the school relapsed into a more or less academic school\r\non the ordinary lines, and was regarded chiefly as a school for the\r\ntraining of art teachers and masters who were required to pass through\r\ncertain stereotyped courses and execute a certain series of drawings in\r\norder to obtain their certificates. Thus model-drawing, freehand\r\noutline, plant-drawing in outline, outline from the cast, light and\r\nshade from the cast, drawing of the antique figure, still life,\r\nanatomical drawings, drawing and painting from the life, ornamental\r\ndesign, historic studies of ornament, perspective and geometry, were all\r\ntaken up in a cut-and-dried way, as isolated studies, and with a view\r\nsolely to obtaining the certificate or passing an examination. This\r\ntheoretic kind of training, though still in force, and though it\r\nenabled the department to turn out certificated teachers for the\r\nschools of the country of a certain standard, and to give to students a\r\ngeneral theoretic idea of art, has been found wanting, since, in\r\npractice, when the student in design leaves his school and desires to\r\ntake up practical work as a designer or craftsman, he requires _special_\r\nknowledge, and specialized skill in design for his work to be of use;\r\nand though he may be able to impart to others what he himself has\r\nlaboriously acquired, the theoretic and general character of his\r\ntraining proves of little or no use, face to face with the ever shifting\r\nand changing demands of the modern manufacturer and the modern market.\r\n\r\nA growing conviction of the inadequacy of the schools of the Science and\r\nArt Department (now the Board of Education), considered as training\r\ngrounds for practical designers and craftsmen, led to the establishment\r\nof new technical schools in the principal towns of Great Britain. The\r\ncircumstance of certain large sums, diverted from their original purpose\r\nof compensation to brewers, being available for educational purposes and\r\nat the disposal of the county councils and municipal bodies, provided\r\nthe means for the building and equipment of these new technical schools,\r\nwhich in many cases are under the same roof as the art school in the\r\nprovincial towns, and, since the Education Act of 1902, are generally\r\nrate-supported. The art schools formerly managed by private committees\r\nand supported by private donors, assisted by the government grants, are\r\nnow, in the principal industrial towns of Great Britain, taken over by\r\nthe municipality. Birmingham is singularly well organized in this\r\nrespect, and its art school has long held a leading position. The school\r\nis well housed in a new building with class-rooms with every appliance,\r\nnot only for the drawing, designing and modelling side, but also for the\r\npractice of artistic handicrafts such as metal repousse, enamelling,\r\nwood-carving, embroidery, &c. The municipality have also established a\r\njewelry school, so as to associate the practical study of art with local\r\nindustry. Manchester and other cities are also equipped with\r\nwell-organized art schools.\r\n\r\nThe important change involved in the incorporation of the Science and\r\nArt Department with the Board of Education also led to a reorganization\r\nof the Royal College of Art. A special council of advice on art matters\r\nwas appointed, consisting of representatives of painting, sculpture,\r\narchitecture and design, who deal with the Royal College of Art, and\r\nappoint the professors who control the teaching in the classes for\r\narchitecture, design and handicraft, decorative painting and sculpture,\r\nmodelling and carving. The council decide upon the curriculum, and\r\nexamine and criticize the work of the college from time to time. They\r\nalso advise the board in regard to the syllabus issued to the art\r\nschools of the country, and act as referees in regard to purchases for\r\nthe museum.\r\n\r\nOf other institutions for the teaching of art, the following may be\r\nnamed: The Royal Drawing Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which was\r\nformed principally to promote the teaching of drawing in schools as a\r\nmeans of education. The system therein adopted differs from the ordinary\r\ndrawing courses, and favours the use of the brush. Brushwork has\r\ngenerally been adopted for elementary work, too, by London County\r\nCouncil teachers, drawing being now a compulsory subject. Remarkable\r\nresults have been obtained by the Alma Road Council schools in the\r\nteaching of boys from eight to twelve by giving them spaces to fill with\r\ngiven forms--leaf shapes--from which patterns are constructed to fill\r\nthe spaces, brush and water-colour being the means employed. At the\r\nRoyal Female School of Art in Queen Square, London, classes in drawing\r\nand painting from life are held, and decorative design is also studied.\r\nThere are also the Royal School of Art Needlework and the School of Art\r\nWood-carving, all aided by the London County Council. The City and\r\nGuilds of London Institute has two departments for what is termed\r\n\"applied\" art, one at the South London School of Technical Art, and the\r\nother at the Art Department in the Technical College, Finsbury. The\r\nSlade School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture, University College,\r\nGower Street, confines itself to drawing and painting from the antique\r\nand life, and exercise in pictorial composition. There are also lectures\r\non anatomy and perspective. The Slade professorships at Oxford and\r\nCambridge universities are concerned with the teaching and literature of\r\nart, but they do not concern themselves with the practice. There are\r\nalso, in addition to the schools of art named and those in connexion\r\nwith the Board of Education and the London County Council in the various\r\ndistricts of London, many and various private clubs and schools, such as\r\nthe Langham and \"Heatherley's,\" chiefly concerned in encouraging drawing\r\nand painting from the life, and for the study of art from the pictorial\r\npoint of view, or for the preparation of candidates for the Royal\r\nAcademy or other schools. The polytechnics and technical institutes also\r\nprovide instruction in a great variety of artistic crafts.\r\n\r\nA general survey, therefore, of the various institutions which are\r\nestablished for the teaching of art in Great Britain gives the\r\nimpression that the study of art is not neglected, although, perhaps,\r\nfurther inquiry might show that, compared with the great educational\r\nestablishments, the proportion is not excessive. Now that the Education\r\nAct 1902 has given the county councils control of elementary and\r\nsecondary education and charged them with the task of promoting the\r\nco-ordination of all forms of education in consultation with the Board\r\nof Education, it is probable that an elementary scholar who shows\r\nartistic ability will be enabled to pass on from the elementary classes\r\nin one school to the higher art and technical schools, secondary and\r\nadvanced, without retracing his steps, thus escaping the depression of\r\ngoing over old ground.\r\n\r\nThe general movement of revival of interest in the arts of decorative\r\ndesign and the allied handicrafts, with the desire to re-establish their\r\ninfluence in art-teaching, has been due to many causes, among which the\r\nwork of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society may count as important.\r\nFrom the leading members of this body the London County Council\r\nTechnical Educational Board, when it was face to face with the problem\r\nof organizing its new schools and its technical classes, sought advice\r\nand aid. Success has attended their schools, especially the Central\r\nSchool of Arts and Crafts at Morley Hall, Regent Street. The object of\r\nthe school is to provide the craftsman in the various branches of\r\ndecorative design with such means of improving his taste and skill as\r\nthe workshop does not afford. It does not concern itself with the\r\namateur or with theoretic drawing. The main difference in principle\r\nadopted in this school in the teaching of design is the absence of\r\nteaching design _apart from handicraft._ It is considered that a\r\ncraftsman thoroughly acquainted with the natural capacities of his\r\nmaterial and strictly understanding the conditions of his work, would be\r\nable, if he had any feeling or invention, to design appropriately in\r\nthat material, and no designing can be good apart from a knowledge of\r\nthe material in which it is intended to be carried out. It should be\r\nremembered, too, that graphic skill in representing the appearances of\r\nnatural objects is one sort of skill, and the executive skill of the\r\ncraftsman in working out his design, say in wood or metal, is quite\r\nanother. It follows that the works of drawing or design made by the\r\ncraftsman would be of quite a different character from a pictorial\r\ndrawing, and might be quite simple and abstract, while clear and\r\naccurate. The training for the pictorial artist and for the craftsman\r\nwould, therefore, naturally be different.\r\n\r\nThe character of the art-teaching adopted in any country must of course\r\ndepend upon the dominant conception of art and its function and purpose.\r\nIf we regard it as an idle accomplishment for the leisured few, its\r\nmethods will be amateurish and superficial. If we regard art as an\r\nimportant factor in education, as a language of the intelligence, as an\r\nindispensable companion to literature, we shall favour systematic study\r\nand a training in the power of direct expression by means of line. We\r\nshall value the symbolic drawing of early civilizations like the\r\nEgyptian, and symbolic art generally, and in the history of decorative\r\nart we shall find the true accompaniment and illustration of human\r\nhistory itself. From this point of view we shall value the acquisition\r\nof the power of drawing for the purpose of presenting and explaining the\r\nfacts and forms of nature. Drawing will be the most direct means at the\r\ncommand of the teacher to explain, to expound, to demonstrate where mere\r\nwords are not sufficiently definite or explicit. Drawing in this sense\r\nis taking a more important place in education, especially in primary\r\neducation, though there is no need for it to stop there, and one feels\r\nit may be destined to take a more important position both as a training\r\nfor the eye and hand and an aid to the teacher. Then, again, we may\r\nregard art more from its social aspect as an essential accompaniment of\r\nhuman life, not only for its illustrative and depicting powers, but also\r\nand no less for its pleasure-giving properties, its power of awakening\r\nand stimulating the observation and sympathy with the moods of nature,\r\nits power of touching the emotions, and above all of appealing to our\r\nsense of beauty. We shall regard the study of art from this point of\r\nview as the greatest civilizer, the most permeating of social and human\r\nforces. Such ideas as these, shared no doubt by all who take pleasure\r\nand interest in art, or feel it to be an important element in their\r\nlives, are crossed and often obscured by a multitude of mundane\r\nconsiderations, and it is probably out of the struggle for ascendancy\r\nbetween these that our systems of art teaching are evolved. There is the\r\ndemand of the right to live on the part of the artist and the teacher of\r\nart. There is the demand on the part of the manufacturer and salesman\r\nfor such art as will help him to dispose of his goods. In the present\r\ncommercial rivalry between nations this latter demand is brought into\r\nprominent relief, and art is apt to be made a minister, or perhaps a\r\nslave to the market. These are but accidental relationships with art.\r\nAll who care for art value it as a means of expression, and for the\r\npleasure and beauty it infuses into all it touches, or as essential and\r\ninseparable from life itself. Seeing then the importance of art from any\r\npoint of view, individual, social, commercial, intellectual, emotional,\r\neconomic, it should be important to us in our systems of art-teaching\r\nnot to lose sight of the end in arranging the means--not to allow our\r\nteaching to be dominated by either dilettantism or commercialism,\r\nneither to be feeble for want of technical skill, nor to sacrifice\r\neverything to technique. The true object of art-teaching is very much\r\nlike that of all education--to inform the mind, while you give skill to\r\nthe hand--not to impose certain rigid rules, or fixed recipes and\r\nmethods of work, but while giving instruction in definite methods and\r\nthe use of materials, to allow for the individual development of the\r\nstudent and enable him to acquire the power to express himself through\r\ndifferent media without forgetting the grammar and alphabet of design.\r\nPractice may vary, but principles remain, and there is a certain logic\r\nin art, as well as in reasoning. All art is conditioned in the mode of\r\nits expression by its material, and even the most individual kind of art\r\nhas a convention of its own by the very necessities and means of its\r\nexistence. Methods of expression, conventions alter as each artist, each\r\nage seeks some new interpretation of nature and the imagination--the\r\nwell-springs of artistic life, and from these reviving streams\r\ncontinually flow new harmonies, new inventions and recombinations,\r\ntaking form and colour according to the temperaments which give them\r\nbirth.     (W. Cr.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTUSI, GIOVANNI MARIA, Italian composer and musical theorist, was born\r\nin Bologna, and died on the 18th of August 1613. He was _canonico\r\nregulare_ at the church of San Salvatore in his native city. He is\r\nchiefly famous in the history of music for his attacks upon Monteverde\r\n(q.v.) embodied in his _L'Artusi overo d. imp._ (1600). For an\r\nexhaustive explanation and a translation of excerpts from these the\r\nstudies of Dr G. Vogel and O. Riemann should be consulted. These will be\r\nfound in the _Vierteljahrsschrift fur Musikwissenschaft_, Leipzig, vol.\r\n3, pp. 326, 380 and 426.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARU ISLANDS (Dutch _Aroe_), a group in the residency of Amboyna, Dutch\r\nEast Indies; between 5 deg. 18' and 7 deg. 5' S., and 134 deg. and 135\r\ndeg. E.; the member nearest to the south-west coast of New Guinea lying\r\nabout 70 m. from it. The larger islands (Wokan, Kobrur, Maikor and\r\nTrangan), and certain of the lesser ones, are regarded by the Malays as\r\none land mass which they call _tana besar_ (\"great land\"). This is\r\njustified inasmuch as its parts are only isolated by narrow creeks of\r\ncurious form, having the character of rivers. The smaller islands number\r\nsome eighty; the total land area is 3244 sq. m.; and the population\r\nabout 22,000. The islands are low, but it is only on the coast that the\r\nground is swampy. The principal formation is coralline limestone; the\r\neastern coast is defended by coral reefs, and the neighbouring sea\r\n(extending as far as New Guinea, and thus demonstrating a physical\r\nconnexion with that land) is shallow, and abounds in coral in full\r\ngrowth. A large part of the surface is covered with virgin forest,\r\nconsisting of screw-pines, palm trees, tree ferns, canariums, &c. The\r\nfauna is altogether Papuan. The natives are also Papuans, but of mixed\r\nblood. They are divided into two confederations, the Uli-luna and the\r\nUli-sawa, which are hostile to each other. The houses are remarkable as\r\nbeing built on piles sunk in the solid rock and having two rooms, the\r\none surrounding the other. The people are in manners complete savages.\r\nThe natives are governed by rajas (_orang kajas_), the Dutch government\r\nbeing represented by a _posthouder._ In the interior is said to exist a\r\ntribe--the Korongoeis--with white skins and fair hair, but it has never\r\nbeen seen by travellers. A few villages are nominally Christian, and the\r\nMalays have introduced Mahommedanism, but most of the natives have no\r\nreligion. Dobbo, on a small western island, is the chief place; its\r\nresident population is reinforced annually, at the time of the west\r\nmonsoon, by traders from that quarter, who deal in the tripang, pearl\r\nshell, tortoise-shell, and other produce of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARUNDEL, EARLDOM OF. This historic dignity, the premier earldom of\r\nEngland, is popularly but erroneously supposed to be annexed to the\r\npossession of Arundel Castle. Norman earls were earls of counties,\r\nthough sometimes styled from their chief residence or from the county\r\ntown, and Mr J.H. Round has shown that the earldom of \"Arundel\" was\r\nreally that of Sussex. Its origin was the grant by Henry I. to his\r\nsecond wife, in dower, of the forfeited \"honour\" of Arundel, of which\r\nthe castle was the head, and which comprised a large portion of Sussex.\r\nAfter his death she married William \"de Albini\" (i.e. d'Aubigny), who\r\nfrom about the year 1141 is variously styled earl of Sussex, of\r\nChichester, or of Arundel, or even Earl William \"de Albini.\" His first\r\nknown appearance as earl is at Christmas 1141, and it has been\r\nascertained that, after acquiring the castle by marriage, he had not\r\nthereby become an earl. Henry II., on his accession, \"gave\" him the\r\ncastle and honour of Arundel, in fee, together with \"the third penny of\r\nthe pleas of Sussex, of which he is earl.\" His male line of heirs became\r\nextinct on the death of Hugh \"de Albini,\" earl of Arundel, in 1243, who\r\nhad four sisters and co-heirs. In the partition of his estates, the\r\ncastle and honour of Arundel were assigned to his second sister's son,\r\nJohn Fitzalan of a Breton house, from which sprang also the royal house\r\nof Stuart. It is proved, however, by record evidence, that neither John\r\nnor his son and successor were ever earls; but from about the end of\r\n1289, when his grandson Richard came of age, he is styled earl of\r\nArundel. Richard's son Edmund was forfeited and beheaded in 1326, and\r\nArundel was out of possession of the family till 1331, when his son was\r\nrestored, and regained the castle and also the earldom by separate\r\ngrants. Both were again lost in 1397 on his son being beheaded and\r\nattainted. But the latter's son was restored to both the earldom and the\r\nestates by Henry IV. in 1400. He died without issue in 1415.\r\n\r\nThe castle and estates now passed to the late earl's cousin and\r\nheir-male under a family entail, but the representation in blood of the\r\nlate earl passed to his sisters and co-heirs, of whom the eldest had\r\nmarried Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk. The descent of the earldom\r\nremained in doubt, till the heir-male's son and heir successfully\r\nclaimed it in 1433, in virtue of his tenure of the castle, alleging that\r\nit was \"a dignity or name united and annexed to the castle and lordship\r\nof Arundel for time whereof memory of man was not to the contrary.\" His\r\nclaim was opposed on behalf of the Mowbrays, and the allegation on which\r\nit was based is discussed and refuted at great length in the _Lords'\r\nReports on the Dignity of a Peer_ (i. 404-429). In the descendants of\r\nhis brother the earldom remained vested till 1580, when the last\r\nFitzalan earl died, leaving as his sole heir his daughter's son Philip\r\nHoward, whose father Thomas, duke of Norfolk, had been beheaded and\r\nattainted in 1572.\r\n\r\nPhilip, who was through his father senior representative of the earls of\r\nArundel down to 1415, and through his mother sole representative of the\r\nsubsequent earls, was summoned to parliament as earl in January 1581,\r\nbut was attainted in 1589. His son Thomas was restored to the earldom\r\nand certain other honours in 1604, and, in 1627, obtained an act of\r\nparliament \"concerning the title, name and dignity of Earl of Arundel,\r\nand for the annexing of the Castle, Honour, Manor and Lordship of\r\nArundel ... with the titles and dignities of the Baronies of Fitzalan,\r\nClun and Oswaldestre, and Maltravers, ... to the same title, name and\r\ndignity of Earl of Arundel.\" This act, which was based on the earl's\r\nallegation that the title had been \"invariably used and enjoyed\" by the\r\nowners of the castle, \"and by reason of the said inheritance and\r\nseisin,\" has been much discussed, especially in the _Lords' Reports_ (i.\r\n430-434). There is no doubt that the earl's object was to entail the\r\nearldom and the castle strictly on a certain line of heirs, and this was\r\neffected by elaborate remainders (passing over the Howards, earls of\r\nSuffolk). It is under this act of parliament that the earldom has been\r\nheld ever since, and that it passed with the castle in 1777 to the\r\nheir-male of the Howards, although the representation in blood then\r\npassed to heirs general. Thus the castle and the earldom cannot be\r\nalienated from the line of heirs on whom it is entailed by the act of\r\n1627; while the heirship in blood of the earlier earls (to 1415) is\r\nvested in Lords Mowbray and Petre and the Baroness Berkeley, and that of\r\nthe later earls (to 1777) in Lords Mowbray and Petre.\r\n\r\nThe precedence of the earldom was challenged in 1446 by Thomas\r\nCourtenay, earl of Devon, owing to the question as to its descent spoken\r\nof above, but the king in council confirmed to the earl the precedence\r\nof his ancestors \"by reason of the Castle, Honour and Lordship of\r\nArundel.\" In the act of 1627 the \"places\" and \"pre-eminences\" belonging\r\nto the earldom were secured to it. It would appear, however, that the\r\ndecision of the dispute with the earl of Devon in 1446 restricts that\r\nprecedency to such as the earl's ancestors had enjoyed, if indeed it\r\ngoes farther than to guarantee his precedence over the earl of Devon.\r\nBut as there is no other existing earldom older than that of Shrewsbury\r\n(1442), the present position of Arundel as the premier earldom is beyond\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n  See _Lords' Reports on the Dignity of a Peer_; Dugdale's _Baronage_;\r\n  Tierney's _History of Arundel_; G.E. C[okayne]'s _Complete Peerage_;\r\n  Round's _Geoffrey de Mandeville_; Pike's _Constitutional History of\r\n  the House of Lords_.     (J. H. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARUNDEL, EARLS OF. According to Cokayne (_Complete Peerage_, i. p. 138,\r\nnote a) there is an old Sussex tradition to the effect that\r\n\r\n  \"Since William rose and Harold fell\r\n   There have been earls of Arundel.\"\r\n\r\nThis, he adds, \"is the case if for 'of' we read 'at.'\" The questions\r\ninvolved in this distinction are discussed in the preceding article on\r\nthe earldom of Arundel, now held by the duke of Norfolk. The present\r\narticle is confined to a biographical sketch of the more conspicuous\r\nearls of Arundel, first in the Fitzalan line, and then in the Howard\r\nline.\r\n\r\nRICHARD FITZALAN (1267-1302), earl of Arundel, was a son of John, lord\r\nof Arundel (1246-1272), and a grandson of another John, lord of Arundel,\r\nClun and Oswaldestre (Oswestry), who took a prominent, if somewhat\r\nwavering, part in the troubles during the reign of Henry III., and who\r\ndied in November 1267. Richard, who was called earl of Arundel about\r\n1289, fought for Edward I. in France and in Scotland, and died on the\r\n9th of March 1302.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his son, EDMUND (1285-1326), who married Alice,\r\nsister of John, earl de Warenne. A bitter enemy of Piers Gaveston,\r\nArundel was one of the ordainers appointed in 1310; he declined to march\r\nwith Edward II. to Bannockburn, and after the king's humiliation he was\r\nclosely associated with Thomas, earl of Lancaster, until about 1321,\r\nwhen he became connected with the Despensers and sided with the king. He\r\nwas faithful to Edward to the last, and was executed at Hereford by the\r\npartisans of Queen Isabella on the 17th of November 1326.\r\n\r\nHis son, RICHARD (c. 1307-1376), who obtained his father's earldom and\r\nlands in 1331, was a soldier of renown and a faithful servant of Edward\r\nIII. He was present at the battle of Sluys and at the siege of Tournai\r\nin 1340; he led one of the divisions of the English army at Crecy and\r\ntook part in the siege of Calais; and he fought in the naval battle with\r\nthe Spaniards off Winchelsea in August 1350. Moreover, he was often\r\nemployed by Edward on diplomatic business. Soon after 1347 Arundel\r\ninherited the estates of his uncle John, earl de Warenne, and in 1361 he\r\nassumed the title of earl de Warenne or earl of Surrey. He was regent of\r\nEngland in 1355, and died on the 24th of January 1376, leaving three\r\nsons, the youngest of whom, Thomas, became archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nRichard's eldest son, RICHARD, earl of Arundel and Surrey (c.\r\n1346-1397), was a member of the royal council during the minority of\r\nRichard II., and about 1381 was made one of the young king's governors.\r\nAs admiral of the west and south he saw a good deal of service on the\r\nsea, but without earning any marked distinction except in 1387 when he\r\ngained a victory over the French and their allies off Margate. About\r\n1385 the earl joined the baronial party led by the king's uncle, Thomas\r\nof Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, and in 1386 was a member of the\r\ncommission appointed to regulate the kingdom and the royal household.\r\nThen came Richard's rash but futile attempt to arrest Arundel, which was\r\nthe signal for the outbreak of hostilities. The Gloucester faction\r\nquickly gained the upper hand, and the earl was one, and perhaps the\r\nmost bitter, of the lords appellant. He was again a member of the royal\r\ncouncil, and was involved in a quarrel with John of Gaunt, duke of\r\nLancaster, whom he accused in the parliament of 1394. After a personal\r\naltercation with the king at Westminster in the same year Arundel\r\nunderwent a short imprisonment, and in 1397 came the final episode of\r\nhis life. Suspicious of Richard he refused the royal invitation to a\r\nbanquet, but his party had broken up, and he was persuaded by his\r\nbrother, Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, to surrender himself\r\nand to trust to the king's clemency. At once he was tried, was attainted\r\nand sentenced to death, and, bearing himself with great intrepidity, was\r\nbeheaded on the 21st of September 1397. He was twice married and had\r\nthree sons and four daughters. The earl founded a hospital at Arundel,\r\nand his tomb in the church of the Augustinian Friars, Broad Street,\r\nLondon, was long a place of pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nHis only surviving son, THOMAS (1381-1415), was a ward of John Holand,\r\nduke of Exeter, from whose keeping he escaped about 1398 and joined his\r\nuncle, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, at Utrecht, returning to England with\r\nHenry of Lancaster, afterwards King Henry IV., in 1399. After Henry's\r\ncoronation he was restored to his father's titles and estates, and was\r\nemployed in fighting against various rebels in Wales and in the north of\r\nEngland. Having left the side of his uncle, the archbishop, Arundel\r\njoined the party of the Beauforts, and was one of the leaders of the\r\nEnglish army which went to France in 1411; then after a period of\r\nretirement he became lord treasurer on the accession of Henry V. From\r\nthe siege of Harfleur he returned ill to England and died on the 13th of\r\nOctober 1415. His wife was Beatrix (d. 1439), a natural daughter of John\r\nI., king of Portugal, but he left no children, and the lordship of\r\nArundel passed to a kinsman, JOHN FITZALAN, Lord Maltravers (1385-1421),\r\nwho was summoned as earl of Arundel in 1416.\r\n\r\nJohn's son, JOHN (1408-1435), did not secure the earldom until 1433,\r\nwhen as the \"English Achilles\" he had already won great distinction in\r\nthe French wars. He was created duke of Touraine, and continued to serve\r\nHenry VI. in the field until his death at Beauvais from the effects of a\r\nwound on the 12th of June 1435. The earl's only son, Humphrey, died in\r\nApril 1438, when the earldom passed to John's brother, WILLIAM\r\n(1417-1488).\r\n\r\nHENRY FITZALAN, 12th earl of Arundel (c. 1517-1580), son of William,\r\n11th earl, by Anne, daughter of Henry Percy, 4th earl of\r\nNorthumberland, was born about 1517. He entered King Henry's household,\r\nattending the latter to Calais in 1532. In 1533 he was summoned to\r\nparliament in his father's barony of Maltravers, and in 1540 he was made\r\ndeputy of Calais, where his vigorous administration was much praised. He\r\nreturned to England in April 1544 after the death of his father, and was\r\nmade a knight of the Garter. In July of the same year he commanded with\r\nSuffolk the English expedition to France as lord marshal, and besieged\r\nand took Boulogne. On his return to England he was made lord\r\nchamberlain, an office which he retained after the accession in 1547 of\r\nEdward VI., at whose coronation he acted as high constable. He was one\r\nof the twelve counsellors nominated in Henry VIII.'s will to assist the\r\nexecutors, but he had little power during the protectorship of Somerset\r\nor the ascendancy of Warwick (afterwards duke of Northumberland), and in\r\n1550 by the latter's device he was accused of embezzlement, removed from\r\nthe council, confined to his house, and fined L12,000--L8000 of this sum\r\nbeing afterwards remitted and the charges never being proved.\r\nSubsequently he allied himself with Somerset, and was implicated in 1551\r\nin the latter's plot against Northumberland, being imprisoned in the\r\nTower in November. On the 3rd of December 1552, though he had never been\r\nbrought to trial, he signed a submission and confession before the privy\r\ncouncil, and was liberated after having been again heavily fined. As\r\nEdward's reign drew to its close, Arundel's support was desired by\r\nNorthumberland to further his designs on the throne for his family, and\r\nhe was accordingly reinstated in the council and discharged of his fine.\r\nIn June 1553 he opposed Edward's \"device\" for the succession, which\r\npassed over his sisters Mary and Elizabeth as illegitimate, and left the\r\ncrown to the children of the duchess of Suffolk, and alone of the\r\ncouncil refused the \"engagement\" to support it, though he signed the\r\nletters patent. On the death of Edward (July 6, 1553) he ostensibly\r\njoined in furthering the duke's plans, but secretly took measures to\r\ndestroy them, and according to some accounts sent a letter to Mary the\r\nsame evening informing her of Edward's death and advising her to retreat\r\nto a place of security. Meanwhile he continued to attend the meetings of\r\nthe council, signed the letter to Mary declaring her illegitimacy and\r\nLady Jane Grey's right to the throne, accompanied Northumberland to\r\nannounce to Jane her accession, and urged Northumberland to leave London\r\nand place himself at the head of the forces to attack Mary, wishing him\r\nGod-speed on his departure. In Northumberland's absence, he gained over\r\nhis fellow-councillors, and having succeeded with them in getting out of\r\nthe Tower, called an assembly of the corporation and chief men of the\r\ncity, denounced Northumberland, and had Mary proclaimed queen,\r\nsubsequently riding off to join her with the Great Seal at Framlingham.\r\nOn the 20th of July he secured Northumberland at Cambridge, and returned\r\nin triumph with Mary to London on the 3rd of August, riding before her\r\nwith the sword of state. He was now made a privy councillor and lord\r\nsteward, and was granted several favours and privileges, acting as high\r\nconstable at the coronation, and obtaining the right to create sixty\r\nknights. He took a prominent part in various public acts of the reign,\r\nwas a commissioner to treat for the queen's marriage, presided at the\r\ntrial of the duke of Suffolk, assisted in suppressing Wyatt's rebellion\r\nin 1554, was despatched on foreign missions, and in September 1555\r\naccompanied Philip to Brussels. The same year he received, together with\r\nother persons, a charter under the name of the Merchant Adventurers of\r\nEngland, for the discovery of unknown lands, and was made high steward\r\nof Oxford University, being chosen chancellor in 1559, but resigning his\r\noffice in the same year. In 1557, on the prospect of the war with\r\nFrance, he was appointed lieutenant-general of the forces for the\r\ndefence of the country, and in 1558 attended the conference at the abbey\r\nof Cercamp for the negotiation of a peace. He returned to England on the\r\ndeath of Mary in November 1558, and is described to Philip II. at that\r\ntime as \"going about in high glee, very smart\" and with hopes of\r\nmarrying the queen, but as \"flighty\" and of \"small ability.\" He was\r\nreinstated in all his offices by Elizabeth, served as high constable at\r\nher coronation, and was visited several times by the queen at Nonsuch in\r\nSurrey. As a Roman Catholic he violently opposed the arrest of his\r\nco-religionists and the war with Scotland, and in 1560 came to blows\r\nwith Lord Clinton in the queen's presence on a dispute arising on those\r\nquestions. He incurred the queen's displeasure in 1562 by holding a\r\nmeeting at his house during her illness to consider the question of the\r\nsuccession and promote the claims of Lady Catherine Grey. In 1564, being\r\nsuspected of intrigues against the government, he was dismissed from the\r\nlord-stewardship and confined to his house, but was restored to favour\r\nin December. In March 1566 he went to Padua, but being summoned back by\r\nthe queen he returned to London accompanied by a large cavalcade on the\r\n17th of April 1567. Next year he served on the commission of inquiry\r\ninto the charges against Mary, queen of Scots. Subsequently he furthered\r\nthe marriage of Mary with the duke of Norfolk, his son-in-law, together\r\nwith the restoration of the Roman Catholic religion and government, and\r\ndeposition of Elizabeth, in collusion with Spain. He made use of the\r\nincident in 1568, of the seizure of treasure at Southampton intended for\r\nPhilip, as a means of effecting Cecil's overthrow, and urged upon the\r\nSpanish government the stoppage of trade. He is described in 1569 to\r\nPhilip as having \"good intentions,\" \"whilst benefiting himself as he was\r\nvery needy.\" In January he alarmed Elizabeth by communicating to her a\r\nsupposed Spanish project for aiding Mary and replacing her on her\r\nthrone, and put before the queen in writing his own objections to the\r\nadoption of extreme measures against her. In June he received with\r\nNorfolk and Lumley 6000 crowns from Philip. In September, on the\r\ndiscovery of Norfolk's plot, he was arrested, but not having committed\r\nhimself sufficiently to incur the charge of treason in the northern\r\nrebellion he escaped punishment, was released in March 1570, and was\r\nrecalled by Leicester to the council with the aim of embarrassing Cecil.\r\nHe again renewed his treasonable intrigues, which were at length to some\r\nextent exposed by the discovery of the Ridolfi plot in September 1571.\r\nHe was once more arrested, and not liberated till December 1572 after\r\nNorfolk's execution. He died on the 24th of February 1580, and was\r\nburied in the chapel at Arundel, where a monument was erected to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nHe married (1) Catherine, daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd marquess of\r\nDorset, by whom he had Henry, who predeceased him, and two daughters, of\r\nwhom Mary married Thomas Howard, 4th duke of Norfolk; and (2) Mary,\r\ndaughter of Sir John Arundell and dowager countess of Sussex, by whom he\r\nhad no children. Arundel was the last earl of his family, the title at\r\nhis death passing through his daughter Mary to the Howards.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--MS.

He was married in 1571 to Anne,\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Thomas Dacre, Lord Dacre (1566), and was\r\neducated at Cambridge, being accorded the degree of M.A. in 1576.\r\nSubsequently Lord Surrey, as he was styled, came to court, partook in\r\nits extravagant gaieties and dissipations, and kept his wife in the\r\nbackground; but he nevertheless failed to secure the favour of\r\nElizabeth, who suspected the Howards generally. On the death of his\r\nmaternal grandfather in February 1580 he became earl of Arundel and\r\nretired from the court. In 1582 his wife joined the church of Rome, and\r\nwas committed to the charge of Sir Thomas Shirley by the queen. He was\r\nhimself suspected of disloyalty, and was regarded by the discontented\r\nRoman Catholics as the centre of the plots against the queen's\r\ngovernment, and even as a possible successor. In 1583 he was with some\r\nreason suspected of complicity in Throgmorton's plot and prepared to\r\nescape to Flanders, but his plans were interrupted by a visit from\r\nElizabeth at his house in London, and by her order subsequently to\r\nconfine himself there. In September 1584 he became a Roman Catholic,\r\ndissembling his conversion and attempting next year once more to escape\r\nabroad; but having been brought back he was placed in the Tower on the\r\n25th of April 1585, and charged before the Star Chamber with being a\r\nRomanist, with quitting England without leave, sharing in Jesuit plots,\r\nand claiming the dukedom of Norfolk. He was sentenced to pay L10,000 and\r\nto be imprisoned during the queen's pleasure. In July 1586 his liberty\r\nwas offered to him if he would carry the sword of state before the queen\r\nto church. In 1588 he was accused of praying, together with other\r\nRomanists, for the success of the Spanish Armada. He was tried for high\r\ntreason on the 14th of April 1589, found guilty and condemned to death;\r\nbut lingered in confinement under his sentence, which was never\r\nexecuted, till his death on the 19th of October 1595. He was buried in\r\nthe Tower, whence his remains were removed in 1624 to Arundel. His\r\ncareer, his later religious constancy and his tragic end have evoked\r\ngeneral sympathy, but his conduct gave rise to grave suspicions, and the\r\npunishment inflicted upon him was not unwarranted; while the account of\r\nthe severity of his imprisonment given by his anonymous and contemporary\r\nbiographer should be compared with his own letters expressing gratitude\r\nfor favours allowed.[2] There appears no foundation for the belief that\r\nhe was poisoned, and according to Camden his death was caused by his\r\nreligious austerities.[3] He was the author of a translation of _An\r\nEpistle of Jesus Christ to the Faithful Soule_ by Johann Justus (1595,\r\nreprinted 1871) and of three MS. treatises _On the Excellence and\r\nUtility of Virtue_. Inscriptions carved by his hand are still to be seen\r\nin the Tower. He had two children, Elizabeth, who died young, and\r\nThomas, who (restored in blood) succeeded him as 2nd earl of Arundel,\r\nand was created earl of Norfolk in 1644.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Article in the _Dict. of Nat.

Owing to the attainder of his father he\r\nwas styled Lord Maltravers, but at the accession of James I. he was\r\nrestored to his father's earldoms of Arundel and Surrey, and to the\r\nbaronies of his grandfather, Thomas, 4th duke of Norfolk. He came to\r\ncourt, travelled subsequently abroad, acquiring a taste for art, and was\r\ncreated K. G. on his return in May 1611. In 1613 he escorted Elizabeth,\r\nthe electress palatine, to Heidelberg, and again visited Italy. On\r\nChristmas day 1615 Arundel joined the Church of England, and took\r\noffice, being appointed a privy councillor in 1616. He supported\r\nRaleigh's expedition in 1617, became a member of the New England\r\nPlantations Committee in 1620 and planned the colonization of\r\nMadagascar. He presided over the House of Lords Committee in April 1621\r\nfor investigating the charges against Bacon, whom he defended from\r\ndegradation from the peerage, and at whose fall he was appointed a\r\ncommissioner of the great seal. On the 16th of May he was sent to the\r\nTower by the Lords on account of violent and insulting language used by\r\nhim to Lord Spencer. He incurred Prince Charles's and Buckingham's anger\r\nby his opposition to the war with Spain in 1624, and by his share in the\r\nduke's impeachment, and on the occasion of his son's marriage to Lady\r\nElizabeth Stewart without the king's approval he was imprisoned in the\r\nTower by Charles I., shortly after his accession, but was released at\r\nthe instance of the Lords in June 1626, being again confined to his\r\nhouse till March 1628, when he was once more liberated by the Lords. In\r\nthe debates on the Petition of Right, while approving its essential\r\ndemands, he supported the retention of some discretionary power by the\r\nking in committing to prison. The same year he was reconciled to the\r\nking and again made a privy councillor. On the 29th of August 1621 he\r\nhad been appointed earl marshal, and in 1623 constable of England, in\r\n1630 reviving the earl marshal's court. In 1625 he was made\r\nlord-lieutenant of Sussex and in 1635 of Surrey. He was sent to the\r\nHague in 1632 on a mission of condolence to the queen of Bohemia on her\r\nhusband's death. In 1634 he was made chief justice in eyre of the\r\nforests north of the Trent; he accompanied Charles the same year to\r\nScotland on the occasion of his coronation, and in 1636 undertook an\r\nunsuccessful mission to the emperor to procure the restitution of the\r\nPalatinate to the young elector. In 1638 he supported the king's\r\nexactions from the vintners, was entrusted with the charge of the Border\r\nforts, and, supporting alone amongst the peers the war against the\r\nScots, was made general of the king's forces in the first Bishops' War,\r\nthough according to Clarendon \"he had nothing martial about him but his\r\npresence and looks.\" He was not employed in the second Bishops' War, but\r\nin August 1640 was nominated captain-general south of the Trent. In\r\nApril he was appointed lord steward of the royal household, and in 1641\r\nas lord high steward presided at the trial of Strafford. This closed his\r\npublic career. He became again estranged from the court, and in 1641 he\r\nescorted home Marie de' Medici, remaining abroad, with the exception of\r\na short visit to England in 1642, for the rest of his life, and taking\r\nup permanent residence at Padua. He contributed a sum of L34,000 to the\r\nking's cause, and suffered severe losses in the war. On the 6th of June\r\n1644 he was created earl of Norfolk. He died at Padua, when on the point\r\nof returning home, on the 14th of September 1646, and was buried at\r\nArundel.\r\n\r\nLord Arundel was a man of high character, an exemplary husband and\r\nparent, but reserved and unpopular, and Clarendon ridicules his family\r\npride. His claim to fame rests upon his patronage of arts and learning\r\nand his magnificent collections. He employed Hollar, Oughtred, Francis\r\nJunius and Inigo Jones; included among his friends Sir Robert Cotton,\r\nSpelman, Camden, Selden and John Evelyn, and his portrait was painted by\r\nRubens and Vandyck. He is called the \"Father of vertu in England,\" and\r\nwas admired by a contemporary as the person to whom \"this angle of the\r\nworld oweth the first sight of Greek and Roman statues.\"[4] He was the\r\nfirst to form any considerable collection of art in Great Britain. His\r\nacquisitions, obtained while on his travels or through agents, and\r\nincluding inscribed marbles, statues, fragments, pictures, gems, coins,\r\nbooks and manuscripts, were deposited at Arundel House, and suffered\r\nconsiderable damage during the Civil War; and, owing to the carelessness\r\nand want of appreciation of his successors, nearly half of the marbles\r\nwere destroyed. After his death the treasures were dispersed. The\r\nmarbles and many of the statues were given by his grandson, Henry, 6th\r\nduke of Norfolk, to the university of Oxford in 1667, became known as\r\nthe _Arundel_ (or Oxford) _Marbles_, and included the famous _Parian\r\nChronicle_, or _Marmor Chronicon_, a marble slab on which are recorded\r\nin Greek events in Grecian history from 1582 B.C. to 354 B.C., said to\r\nhave been executed in the island of Paros about 263 B.C. Its narration\r\nof events differs in some respects from the most trustworthy historical\r\naccounts, but its genuineness, challenged by some writers, has been\r\nstrongly supported by Porson and others, and is considered fairly\r\nestablished. Other statues were presented to the university by Henrietta\r\nLouisa, countess of Pomfret, in 1755. The cabinets and gems were removed\r\nby the wife of Henry, 7th duke of Norfolk, in 1685, and after her death\r\nfound their way into the Marlborough collection. The pictures and\r\ndrawings were sold in 1685 and 1691, and Lord Stafford's moiety of the\r\ncollection in 1720. The coins and medals were, bought by Heneage Finch,\r\n2nd earl of Winchelsea, and dispersed in 1696; the library, at the\r\ninstance of John Evelyn, who feared its total loss, was given to the\r\nRoyal Society, and a part, consisting of genealogical and heraldic\r\ncollections, to the College of Heralds, the manuscript portion of the\r\nRoyal Society's moiety being transferred to the British Museum in 1831\r\nand forming the present Arundel Collection. The famous bust of Homer\r\nreached the British Museum after passing through various hands.\r\n\r\nLord Arundel married in 1606 Lady Alethea, daughter and heir of Gilbert\r\nTalbot, 7th earl of Shrewsbury, by whom, besides three sons who died\r\nyoung and one daughter, he had John, who predeceased him, Henry\r\nFrederick, who succeeded him as 3rd earl of Arundel and earl of Surrey\r\nand of Norfolk, and William, Viscount Stafford, executed in 1680. In\r\n1849 the Arundel Society for promoting artistic knowledge was founded in\r\nhis memory. Henry Frederick's grandson Thomas, by the reversal (1660) of\r\nthe attainder of 1572, succeeded to the dukedom of Norfolk, in which the\r\nearldom has since then been merged.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--See the article in the _Dict, of Nat.
