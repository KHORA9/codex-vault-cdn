He made use of all the best ideas of the Generals who preceded\r\nhim in the Aldershot Command, and he was, I think, instrumental in\r\ncausing the appointment of Horace Smith-Dorrien and Douglas Haig to\r\nsucceed in turn to that nursery of soldiers.\r\n\r\nHow sound his judgment has proved to be may be discovered from the\r\ndispatches--carefully worded--in which he describes how Smith-Dorrien\r\nconducted the most successful retreat since that of Sir John Moore to\r\nCorunna, 1808-9, and how Douglas Haig carried his Army across the\r\nAisne river in the face of the enemy's fire opposition.\r\n\r\nFrom 1884-5, when as a Squadron Officer he showed marked determination\r\nin the abortive expedition for the relief of Gordon, until 1899-1902\r\nin South Africa, he has been the foremost man to inculcate the\r\n\"Cavalry Spirit,\" and unlike many advocates of that spirit, he has\r\nnever become a slave to the idea. He has been at pains to teach the\r\nCavalry soldier that when he can no longer fight to the best advantage\r\nin the saddle, he is to get off his horse and fight on foot. This is a\r\nmarked feature of his military genius.\r\n\r\nHe is intensely practical; and he is possessed of great moral and\r\nphysical courage which never fail to assert themselves in the face of\r\nthe most difficult situations. They were conspicuously shown during\r\nthe Boer War when, with an extraordinary determination, he formed up\r\nhis men on their tired and exhausted horses and advanced in extended\r\norder, galloping through the Boers in position, and reaching Kimberley\r\nas the result of his heroic determination.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the earlier part of this War, things were not going well, I\r\nwas asked to give my opinion of our chances of success. I said that I\r\ndid not think that our prospects were then bright, but although many\r\nmen had gone \"Hands up\" before John French, he would never put up his\r\nown, whatever happened.\r\n\r\n        EVELYN WOOD, F.-M.\r\n  _November 10_,\r\n    1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing this biography of Field-Marshal Sir John French I have been\r\ndeeply indebted to many of his personal friends for helping me with\r\nfirst-hand impressions of our General in the Field.

The\r\nconversation had turned upon luck, a word that curiously enough was\r\nlater to be so intimately associated with French's name. One man had\r\nstoutly proclaimed that all promotion was a matter of luck, and French\r\nhad claimed that only work and ability really counted in the end. Yet\r\n\"French's luck\" has become almost a service proverb--for those who\r\nhave not closely studied his career. Luck is frequently a word used to\r\nexplain our own failure and another man's success.\r\n\r\nNot that success and John French could ever have been strangers. There\r\nare some happy natures whose destiny is never in doubt, Providence\r\nhaving apparently planned it half a century ahead. Sir John French is\r\na striking instance of this. Destiny never had any doubt about the\r\nman. He was born to be a fighter. On his father's side he comes of the\r\nfamous old Galway family of which Lord de Freyne, of French Park, Co.\r\nRoscommon, is now the head. By tradition the Frenches are a naval\r\nfamily, although there have been famous soldiers as well as famous\r\nsailors amongst its members. There was, for instance, the John French\r\nwho fought in the army of King William, leading a troop of the\r\nEnniskillen Dragoons at Aughrim in 1689.\r\n\r\nSir John French is himself the son of a sailor, Commander J.T.W.\r\nFrench, who on retiring from the Navy settled down on the beautiful\r\nlittle Kentish estate of Ripplevale, near Walmer. Here John Denton\r\nPinkstone French was born on September 28, 1852, in the same year as\r\nhis future colleague, General Joffre. His mother, a Miss Eccles, was\r\nthe daughter of a Scotch family resident near Glasgow.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: PLAYING WITH SOLDIERS]\r\n\r\nOf the boy's home life at Ripplevale very little is known. He was the\r\nsixth child and the only son of the family. Both his parents dying\r\nwhile he was quite young, he was brought up under the care of his\r\nsisters. But there is no reason to suppose that he was therefore\r\nspoilt; for one of these ladies shared in a remarkable degree the\r\nqualities of energy and determination which were to distinguish her\r\nbrother. Young French's earliest education was largely guided by this\r\ngifted sister, who is now so well known in another field of warfare as\r\nMrs. Despard.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to say what manner of boy the future\r\nField-Marshal was. Only one fact emerges clearly. He was high-spirited\r\nand full of mischief. Everything that he did was done with the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm, and already there were signs that he possessed an\r\nunusually strong will.\r\n\r\nInevitably games quickly took possession of his imagination. Very soon\r\nthe war game had first place in his affections. He was perpetually\r\nplaying with soldiers--a fascinating hobby which intrigued the curious\r\nmind of the rather silent child. French, in fact, was a very normal\r\nand healthy boy, with just a touch of thoughtfulness to mark him off\r\nfrom his fellows.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, to enjoy the freedom of home life for very long.\r\nAt an early age he was sent to a preparatory school at Harrow, which\r\nhe left for Eastman's Naval College at Portsmouth. After the necessary\r\n\"cramming\" he passed the entrance examination to the Navy at the age\r\nof thirteen. In the following year (1866) he joined the _Britannia_ as\r\na cadet. Four years of strenuous naval work followed. But like another\r\nField-Marshal-to-be, Sir Evelyn Wood, the boy was not apparently\r\nenamoured of the sea. As a result he decided to leave that branch of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nThat action is typical of the man. He is ruthless with himself as well\r\nas with others. If the Navy were not to give scope for his ambition,\r\nthen he must quit the Navy. Already, no doubt, his life-long hero,\r\nNapoleon, was kindling the young man's imagination. But the English\r\nNavy of those days gave little encouragement to the Napoleonic point\r\nof view. It was bound up with the sternest discipline and much red\r\ntape. If rumour speaks true young French was irritated by the almost\r\ndespotic powers then possessed by certain naval officers. So he boldly\r\ndecided at the age of eighteen to end one career and commence another.\r\n\r\nTo enter the sister service he had to stoop to what is dubbed the\r\n\"back-door,\" in other words a commission in the militia. It seems\r\nrather remarkable that one of our most brilliant officers should have\r\nhad this difficulty to face. Incidentally it is a curious sidelight on\r\nthe system of competitive examinations. But there are several facts to\r\nremember. Sir John French's genius developed slowly. One does not\r\nfigure him as ready, like Kitchener, at twenty-one, with a complete\r\nmap of his career. In these days he was probably more interested in\r\nhunting than in soldiering. The man who is now proverbial for his\r\ndevotion to the study of tactics was then very little of a book-worm.\r\nIndeed he seems to have shown no special intellectual or practical\r\nabilities until much later in life.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE \"DUMPIES\"]\r\n\r\nIn 1874 he was gazetted to the 8th Hussars, being transferred three\r\nweeks later to the 19th. At that time the 19th Hussars was scarcely a\r\ncrack regiment. With two other regiments raised after the Indian\r\nmutiny it was nicknamed the \"Dumpies,\" owing to the standard of height\r\nbeing lowered, and it had yet to earn the reputation which Barrow and\r\nFrench secured it. About John French the subaltern, as about John\r\nFrench the midshipman, history is silent. No fabulous legends have\r\naccumulated about him. Presumably the short, firmly-built young\r\nofficer was regarded as normal and entirely _de rigeur_ in his\r\nsporting propensities.\r\n\r\nThe subaltern of the 'eighties took himself much less seriously than\r\nhis successor of today. The eternal drill and the occasional\r\nmanoeuvres were conducted on well-worn and almost automatic\r\nprinciples. As a result, the younger officers found hunting and polo\r\ndecidedly better sport. Few or none of them were military enthusiasts;\r\nand study did not enter largely into their programme. It entered into\r\nFrench's--but only in stray hours, often snatched by early rising,\r\nbefore the day's work--or sport--began.\r\n\r\nDespite constant rumours to the contrary, there can be no question\r\nthat French was a most spirited young officer and a thorough\r\nsportsman. He at once earned for himself the sobriquet of \"Capt. X\r\nTrees,\" as a result of his being a \"retired naval man.\" To this day\r\namong the very few remaining brother officers of his youth, he is\r\nstill greeted as \"Trees.\"\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, French showed no desire to pose as \"the glass of\r\nfashion or the mould of form.\" He never attempted to cultivate the\r\ngraces of the _beau sabreur_. His short square figure did not look\r\nwell on horseback and probably never will. But he was admitted to be a\r\ncapable horseman and to have \"good hands.\" Although not keen on polo\r\nhe was very fond of steeplechasing. Of his love for that sport there\r\nis ample proof in the fact that he trained and rode his own\r\nsteeplechasers.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A DIFFICULT TEAM]\r\n\r\nOne of his best horses was a mare called \"Mrs. Gamp,\" which he lent on\r\none occasion to a brother subaltern--now Colonel Charles E. Warde,\r\nM.P. for Mid-Kent. Riding with his own spurs on French's mare, Colonel\r\nWarde was one of three out of a field of four hundred to live through\r\na Warde Union run which was responsible for the death of six hunters\r\nbefore the day was over.\r\n\r\nYoung French also became a very good whip. Along with Colonel H.M.A.\r\nWarde--now the Chief Constable of Kent--he had a thrilling adventure\r\nin coach driving. When the regiment first started a coach it was\r\nnecessary to bring it from Dublin to the Curragh. The two subalterns,\r\nneither of whom had ever driven four horses before, commandeered four\r\nchargers belonging to brother officers. One of the animals was a\r\nnotorious kicker. But they took them up to Dublin and drove the coach\r\ntwenty-eight miles down to the Curragh next day, arriving there alive\r\nand with no broken harness!\r\n\r\nAt that time French differed from his fellow officers probably rather\r\nin degree than in temperament. Although a very keen sportsman he did\r\nnot put sport first. Colonel C.E. Warde, one of his closest friends,\r\ngives the following description of the man. \"Although he never\r\nattempted to go to the Staff College he was continually studying\r\nmilitary works, and often, when his brother subalterns were at polo or\r\nother afternoon amusements, he would remain in his room reading Von\r\nSchmidt, Jomini, or other books on strategy. I recollect once\r\ntravelling by rail with him in our subaltern days, when after\r\nobserving the country for some time, he broke out: 'There is where I\r\nshould put my artillery.' 'There is where I should put my cavalry' and\r\nso on to the journey's end.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of these evidences of a soldier's eye for country, there is\r\nnothing to show that French had developed any abnormal devotion for\r\nhis work. He was interested but not absorbed. In 1880 a captaincy and\r\nhis marriage probably did something to make him take his career more\r\nseriously. His wife, Lady French, was a daughter of Mr. R.W.\r\nSelby-Lowndes, of Bletchley, Bucks. They have two sons and a daughter.\r\n\r\nA few months after his marriage he accepted an adjutancy in the\r\nNorthumberland Yeomanry. For four uneventful years he was stationed at\r\nNewcastle, where the work was monotonous and the opportunities almost\r\n_nil_.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE WAITING GAME]\r\n\r\nNaturally the young man fretted very much at being left behind with\r\nthe Yeomanry when his regiment was ordered to embark for Egypt in\r\n1882. And he never rested until he was allowed to follow it out in\r\n1884. It was in many ways a new 19th which the young officer re-joined\r\nin Egypt. The regiment hurried out in 1882 had at last come under a\r\ncommander of real genius in Colonel Percy Barrow, C.B., and in that\r\ncommander French was to find his first real military inspiration. It\r\nis difficult to judge what his future might have been but for this one\r\nman and the Nile Expedition, which proved the turning point in\r\nFrench's career as it did in that of his regiment.\r\n\r\nThen, as ever, French was a man who had to wait for his opportunities.\r\nHe was thirty-two years of age before he saw this, his first piece of\r\nactive service. Where Kitchener found, or made, opportunities for\r\nmilitary experience, French was content to wait the turn of events. So\r\nit has been all through his life. He has never forestalled Destiny; he\r\nhas simply accepted its call. But when an opportunity presented itself\r\nhe always seized it, and the Nile Expedition was no exception to the\r\nrule. Major French, without Staff College training, without the usual\r\ndiplomas, was to prove himself once and for all a master tactician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWITH THE NILE EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n    A Forlorn Hope--Scouting in the Desert--The Battle of Abu\r\n    Klea--Metammeh--The Death of Gordon--A Dangerous\r\n    Retreat--\"Major French and His Thirteen Troopers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John French's first experience of actual warfare was a bitter one.\r\nIf ever the British Government bungled one of their military\r\nenterprises more thoroughly than another, it was the Nile Expedition\r\nof 1884-5. What began as a forlorn hope ended in complete failure, and\r\nin three short months French experienced the miseries of retreat, of\r\nfailure, and of work under an invertebrate War Office.\r\n\r\nTo this day no one has ever justified the hidden processes of logic by\r\nwhich the Government responsible came to the conclusion that the\r\nSoudan must be evacuated. It is true that the Mahdi, Mohammed Ahmed,\r\nhad won considerable successes against our forces since his appearance\r\nin 1881. But no army of any dimensions had ever been opposed to his\r\n\"Divine powers.\" Why Gordon should have been entrusted with the\r\nevacuation is not so doubtful. W.T. Stead and other journalistic\r\npundits conceived him to be the man for the task, however much Egypt's\r\nruler, Lord Cromer, might differ from their verdict. So to Khartoum\r\nGordon was sent with an all too small band of followers. Presumably\r\nthe authorities imagined that the man who had worked miracles in China\r\nwith neither men nor money would settle the Soudan on equally\r\neconomical terms. But the Mahdi's black braves were other mettle than\r\nthe yellow men, as Gordon himself well knew from his past experience\r\nin the Soudan.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE SLEEPER WAKES]\r\n\r\nReaching Khartoum on February 18, 1884, he quickly discovered how\r\nperilous the defeat of Baker Pasha at El-Teb had made his position. He\r\nat once warned his superiors, but nothing was done. In April he found\r\nKhartoum besieged, but even that did not startle the Home authorities\r\nfrom their lethargy. At length, however, the Government realised that\r\nto allow their General to perish at the hands of the Dervishes might\r\nbe to forfeit their prestige in Egypt. Lord Wolseley was accordingly\r\ninstructed to relieve Khartoum at all costs.\r\n\r\nThose instructions were more easy to give than to obey. Wolseley\r\ndecided to send a flying column across the desert from Korti to\r\nMetammeh and thence to Khartoum; and a second up the Nile. With the\r\nluckless flying column went part of the 19th Hussars, under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Barrow. Major French was second in command.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, General Herbert Stewart's little force, with its\r\nthousand odd men and two thousand camels, was on parade for inspection\r\nnear Korti. At first there was some doubt as to how the camels would\r\nstand the attack of the Mahdi's wild warriors.\r\n\r\n\"In order to test the steadiness of our camels as regarded noise and\r\nfiring, the 19th Hussars one day at brigade drill charged on the\r\nunprotected mass of camels, cheering and yelling. Everybody expected\r\nto see them break their ropes and career wildly over the desert. The\r\nonly result was that one solitary camel struggled to his feet, looked\r\nround and knelt down again; the others never moved an eyelid.\r\n\r\n\"That was satisfactory: and as firing into them with blank cartridges\r\nand over them with ball had already been tried ... with no visible\r\nresult, the general opinion was that they would stand charging niggers\r\nor anything else in creation with equanimity. Sad to say we came to\r\nthe conclusion that it was want of brains _pur et simple_ that caused\r\nour steeds to behave thus docilely: any other animal with a vestige of\r\nbrain would have been scared to death, but, as it was, no one\r\nregretted their deficiency.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE KITCHENER WAY]\r\n\r\nBefore the corps set out from Korti, Sir Herbert Stewart sent for the\r\nchief men at Ambukol who knew the desert route. Showing them money he\r\nasked whether they would act as guides. This they refused to do. Said\r\nStewart, \"You will come anyway. If you like to ride to Metammeh tied\r\non your camels well and good; if you prefer not being lashed on, you\r\nwill get these nice presents.\" They agreed to go! So they were sent to\r\nride ahead of the column, guarded by some of the 19th, who had orders\r\nto shoot if they attempted to fly. But no such effort was made.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the 19th had more arduous work to do. During the whole\r\nweary march they were far ahead of the column scouting.\r\n\r\n\"On coming to a plain with hills in the distance, you'd see various\r\nspecks on the tops of the furthest hills, and with the help of your\r\nglasses discover them to be the 19th. Sir Herbert (Stewart) was\r\nimmensely pleased with them and pointed them out to me as being the\r\nvery acme of Light Cavalry.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe column itself was almost half-a-mile in length, even when by night\r\nit marched in close order. It was a strange sight to see the camels,\r\nwith long necks outstretched, swaying across the desert towards the\r\nhorizon, both the men and their ostrich-like steeds enveloped in a\r\nhuge cloud of dust. A wind storm arose more than once, flinging\r\nblinding clouds of sand in the men's faces. On New Year's Eve,\r\nhowever, the soldiers shouted themselves hoarse with \"Auld Lang Syne\"\r\nas they plodded wearily along the moonlit desert.\r\n\r\nVery soon the cavalry had an opportunity to distinguish themselves. On\r\nthe following day a halt was called \"to allow the indefatigable 19th\r\nto find out the reason of a faint light burning far off on the\r\nplain.... They returned with several natives, a string of camels and\r\nseveral loads of dates. They had found ... the natives bivouacked for\r\nthe night, surprised them, captured as much loot as possible and\r\nbolted the rest.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight's marching the column came in touch with the enemy\r\nat Abu Klea. At this time French's work was peculiarly dangerous. He\r\nspent night after night in the desert in solitary watching and waiting\r\nfor the Dervishes.\r\n\r\nOn January 16 the 19th Hussars were sent to reconnoitre. They\r\nreported that the Mahdi had mustered considerable force between the\r\nBritish camp and the wells. Stewart determined to fight his way\r\nthrough to the wells at any cost. Leaving a very small force to hold\r\nhis camp, he formed his main body into a square, in which form it\r\nadvanced. No sooner had the advance begun than the enemy opened a\r\nterrific fire. Yet the square pushed on, despite constant halts\r\nnecessary to assure its formation remaining intact, as the guns were\r\nhauled over the rutty and uneven surface of the desert.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the Dervishes rushed to the attack, and Stewart found\r\nhimself outnumbered by four to one. The attack was delivered with\r\nappalling force. The Arabs' shouts as they rushed forward have been\r\ndescribed by an eye-witness as like the thunder of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE BROKEN SQUARE]\r\n\r\nTheir onslaught was so sudden that the square was broken, the heavy\r\ncamel corps suffering specially severely. So did the naval brigade\r\nwhose solitary Gardner gun jammed at the critical moment. When Lord\r\nCharles Beresford was attempting to clear it his assistants were all\r\nspeared and he himself was knocked senseless under the gun. Somehow or\r\nother, with much difficulty, he managed to get back to the square.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, however, the Arabs' attack began to diminish in\r\nviolence. Here was the cavalry's opportunity. They charged the enemy\r\nwith great impetuosity. Gradually the Dervishes were driven off by the\r\naid of the artillery. But there were the wells still to capture, and\r\nthe detachment of the 19th Hussars was given that important mission.\r\nThey were able to accomplish it without resistance. That night the\r\nthirsty force was able to drink water again--albeit yellow in colour\r\nand weird of taste.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rest the advance on Metammeh was continued, with the\r\nHussars still in the van. On the following night there was a scene of\r\nwild disorder. It was very dark and camels began to stumble and lose\r\ntheir places in the long grass.\r\n\r\nThe men were so weary that many went to sleep and even fell from their\r\ncamels, which wandered along unguided and strayed far from the column.\r\nThe night was extraordinarily dark, and there was no moon to light the\r\nway for the exhausted column through the wild and pathless country,\r\nwhich would have been difficult to traverse even in broad daylight. At\r\ntimes it was discovered that the troops were going in a circle and the\r\nrear guard found itself in front of the force.\r\n\r\nWhen at last open ground was reached the enemy were found to be in\r\nstrength. Once again a fight was inevitable for the tired force. So\r\nStewart had a zeriba of camel saddles, boxes, etc., hastily flung up\r\nto protect his men. By this time the horses of the 19th Hussars were\r\nso done up as to render them useless. French's regiment, therefore,\r\nwas left with some artillery, under Colonel Barrow, in the zeriba,\r\nalong with the war correspondents, who had tried in vain to make a\r\ndash back to Abu Klea.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE GUARDS AT ABU KLEA]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the force once more formed into a square to meet the\r\nenemy's attack. It was like a tornado when it came.\r\n\r\nWith a headlong rush eight hundred spearmen, led by emirs on\r\nmagnificent horses, hurled themselves upon the British square. Without\r\na tremor the troops awaited their onslaught, cheering loudly as they\r\nsaw the fluttering banners of the enemy approach. The brunt of the\r\nattack was on the left angle of the front face, where the Guards and\r\nMounted Infantry received the charge, at a distance of three hundred\r\nyards, with a fire so deadly that the front ranks of the yelling\r\nDervishes were mown down. The battle was over within a few moments.\r\nThe enemy never got within thirty yards of the square, but with broken\r\nranks and wild confusion the spearmen fled, leaving two hundred and\r\nfifty of their dead upon the field.\r\n\r\nThis rapid victory was largely due to the garrison in the zeriba, who\r\nmade very effective use of their guns. The enemy left two hundred and\r\nfifty dead on the field. Yet not a single British soldier was either\r\nkilled or wounded in actually repelling the charge. Among those\r\nseriously wounded later in the day was General Stewart, who died of\r\nhis wounds a few days later. Almost his last words to Colonel Barrow\r\nwere, \"Take care of the 19th Hussars; they have done well.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this gallantry was vain. While the force was still near\r\nMetammeh, news came of the fall of Khartoum. An officer who was with\r\nhim when the blow fell has recorded that he never saw French so\r\nprofoundly moved as he was on the receipt of these black tidings. With\r\nKhartoum fallen the mission of the flying column was ended. Its\r\nposition indeed had become extremely precarious. The problem before\r\nthe authorities was now not how to relieve Khartoum, but how to\r\nrelieve the Relieving Expedition.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that they solved it very successfully. Buller was\r\nsent up to Gubat to take command. With him he brought only the Royal\r\nIrish and West Kent Regiments to reinforce the column. And his\r\ninstructions were to seize Metammeh and march on Berber!\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: HIS FIRST RETREAT]\r\n\r\nOnce on the scene, however, Buller soon saw the hopelessness of the\r\nsituation. Considering that the fall of Khartoum had released a host\r\nof the Mahdi's followers, the storming of Metammeh was now a doubly\r\ndifficult enterprise; an attack on Berber would have been simply\r\nsuicidal. Buller accordingly determined on a retreat.\r\n\r\nOn February 13 he evacuated Gubat. On March 1 his advance guard had\r\nreached Korti. In this retreat the 19th Hussars again did splendid\r\nwork. For days on end the column was submitted to that unceasing\r\npelting of bullets which Buller characterised in one of his laconic\r\ndispatches as \"annoying.\" But Barrow, the Hussars' chief, was a master\r\nof the art of reconnoitring. Time and again he and his men were able\r\nto deceive the enemy as to the direction of the column's march. It was\r\nthen that French had his first experience in \"masterly retreat.\"\r\n\r\nHow sorely the column was pressed may be shown from one incident.\r\nWhile he was preparing to evacuate Abu Klea, Buller received\r\ninformation to the effect that the enemy was advancing upon him with a\r\nforce of eight thousand men. He determined upon a desperate measure.\r\nHe left standing the forts which he had intended to demolish and\r\nfilled up the larger wells.\r\n\r\nA desert well, to the Oriental, is almost sacred, and never even in\r\nsavage warfare would such a course have been adopted. But Buller knew\r\nthat the absence of water was the only thing that could check the rush\r\nof the oncoming hordes, and this deed, terrible as it may have seemed\r\nto the Eastern mind, was his sole means of covering his retreat.\r\nOrders were therefore given to fill up all the principal wells with\r\nstones and rubbish. It was certainly an effectual measure, for the\r\nenemy would be delayed for many hours, perhaps days, before he could\r\nrestore the wells and obtain sufficient water to enable him to\r\ncontinue in pursuit of the British force which was so hopelessly\r\noutnumbered. In the circumstances Buller could not be blamed for\r\nsaving British lives at the price of Oriental tradition.\r\n\r\nSir Evelyn Wood was also sent with reinforcements from Korti to\r\nstrengthen the force at Gakdul Wells. There he met French for the\r\nfirst time. \"I saw him,\" Sir Evelyn relates, \"when our people were\r\ncoming back across the desert after our failure, the whole force\r\ndepressed by the death of Gordon. I came on him about a hundred miles\r\nfrom the river--the last man of the last section of the rear guard! We\r\nwere followed by bands of Arabs. They came into our bivouac on the\r\nnight of which I am speaking, and the night following they carried\r\noff some of our slaughter cattle.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: MENTIONED IN DISPATCHES]\r\n\r\nMajor French was quickly able to distinguish himself in the retreat.\r\nFor Buller was a believer in cavalry and used it wherever possible. In\r\nhis dispatch on the retreat he paid French the following handsome\r\ntribute:\r\n\r\n\"I wish expressly to remark on the excellent work that has been done\r\nby a small detachment of the 19th Hussars, both during our occupation\r\nof Abu Klea and during our retirement. Each man has done the work of\r\nten; and it is not too much to say that the force owes much to Major\r\nFrench and his thirteen troopers.\"\r\n\r\nThe flying column occupied just two months in its fruitless\r\nexpedition. But no more trying experience was ever packed into so\r\nshort a time. On that march across the Bayuda desert history has only\r\none verdict. It is that pronounced by Count von Moltke on the men who\r\naccomplished it:--\"They were not soldiers but heroes.\" None of the men\r\nearned the title more thoroughly than Major French and his troopers.\r\n\"During the whole march from Korti,\" says Colonel Biddulph, \"the\r\nentire scouting duty had been taken by the 19th Hussars, so that each\r\nday they covered far more ground than the rest of the force.\"[5] The\r\nenemy themselves came to respect the little force of cavalrymen. \"Even\r\nthe fierce Baggara horsemen appeared unwilling to cross swords with\r\nour Hussars,\" wrote one who accompanied the column. Major French and\r\nhis regiment had firmly established their reputation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _With the Camel Corps up the Nile_, by Count Gleichen, by\r\npermission of Messrs.

A few days after General Buller's tribute he was appointed\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of his regiment. So that he came back to England as\r\nsecond in command of the 19th Hussars.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward he became entirely absorbed in his profession.\r\nIt is true that he had always been interested in it; but there is no\r\nquestion that Barrow was the man who had shown him the fascination of\r\nscientific generalship. While making the reputation of the 19th,\r\nBarrow had unhappily lost his own life. He died as the result of\r\nre-opening an internal wound while tent-pegging in the following year.\r\nFrench determined to carry on his work, and at Norwich the training\r\nof the 19th Hussars rapidly became famous throughout the Army.\r\n\r\nOne young officer, now General Bewicke Copley,[6] was attached to the\r\n19th from another regiment in order to study their methods. He tells\r\nhow he was greatly struck by the brilliant work which French was\r\ndoing. His strict discipline and his terrific ideas of what training\r\nmeant, may have struck some of his young subalterns as scarcely\r\nyielding them the ideal existence of the _beau sabreur_. Probably they\r\nwere right; but they were being licked into a state of amazing\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 it fell to Sir Evelyn Wood's lot to inspect the regiment.\r\nPointing to French, he asked his Colonel, \"Of what value is that man?\"\r\nThe reply was, \"He is for ever reading military books.\" And he has\r\nbeen reading them ever since!\r\n\r\nA couple of years later he attained the rank of Colonel, with command\r\nof his regiment. Very soon Sir Evelyn was to discover the answer to\r\nhis question. For he was anxious at that time to introduce the\r\nsquadron system. French was the one commanding officer who carried it\r\nout. In spite of the very large amount of extra work it entailed, he\r\nwas willing to take any number of recruits and train them in the new\r\nmethod. That method was finally allowed to lapse, although it has been\r\nadopted in another form for infantry regiments. It is typical of\r\nFrench that he was willing to slave over the unpopular way of doing\r\nthings, while other men adhered to the traditional and official\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE AUTHORITIES ASTONISHED]\r\n\r\nWhile French was still busy elaborating new theories and testing them\r\nat manoeuvres, his regiment was ordered to India. There he met one of\r\nhis future colleagues in South Africa, Sir George White. He was also\r\nfortunate in working with one of the most brilliant of all British\r\ncavalry trainers, Sir George Luck.\r\n\r\nThe latter considered that the cavalry regiments in India required\r\ndrastic reorganisation. French was ready to carry it out. To increase\r\nthe efficiency of the cavalry extensive manoeuvres were organised.\r\nFrench acted as Chief of the Staff to General Luck, and astonished the\r\nauthorities by the way in which \"he conducted troops dispersed over a\r\nwide area of ground, allotting to each section its appointed work and\r\nbringing the complete movement to a brilliant conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Government's recognition of his brilliant work was by no means\r\nencouraging. In 1893 Colonel French was actually retired on half-pay!\r\nIt is an admirable system which allows the middle-aged officer to\r\nmake way for youth in the British army; but the spectacle of a French\r\ndespatched into civil obscurity at the ripe age of forty-one, has its\r\ntragic as well as its comic side. That it acutely depressed him we\r\nknow. For a time he was almost in despair as to his career.\r\n\r\nActually, however, these two years \"out of action\" were probably\r\ninvaluable to him--and to the army. For the first time he had the\r\nopportunity for unrestrained study; and much of that time was spent,\r\nno doubt, in thinking out the theories of cavalry action which were\r\nyet to bring him fame and our arms success.\r\n\r\nMuch of his most valuable work dates from this period of enforced\r\nretirement. He was present, for instance, during the cavalry\r\nmanoeuvres of 1894 in Berkshire. He took part in the manoeuvres as a\r\nbrigadier. His chief Staff Officer, by the way, was Major R.S.S. (now\r\nLieut.-General Sir Robert) Baden-Powell, while the aide-de-camp to the\r\nDirector-General of manoeuvres was Captain (now Lieut.-General Sir)\r\nDouglas Haig. Here French formulated what was to be one of the axioms\r\nof his future cavalry tactics. One of those present at headquarters\r\nhas recorded his remarks.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE FUNCTION OF CAVALRY]\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" said French, \"no subject upon which more misconception\r\nexists, even among service men, than as regards the real rôle of\r\ncavalry in warfare. My conception of the duties and functions of the\r\nmounted arm is not to cut and to hack and to thrust at your enemy\r\nwherever and however he may be found. The real business of cavalry is\r\nso to manoeuvre your enemy as to bring him within effective range of\r\nthe corps artillery of your own side for which a position suitable for\r\nbattle would previously have been selected.\"[7]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive a more clear and concise statement of the\r\nfunction of cavalry. It differs widely from the rather grim utterance\r\nof the late Sir Baker Russell, who stated that the duty of cavalry was\r\nto look pretty during time of peace, and get killed in war.\r\n\r\nHappily Colonel French's theorising was not without its effect. The\r\nBerkshire manoeuvres showed a number of flagrant shortcomings in our\r\ncavalry. Several military men, ably seconded by _The Morning Post_,\r\ninsisted on the reorganisation of that arm. After the customary\r\nprotest, officialdom bowed to the storm.\r\n\r\nFrench's old chief, Sir George Luck, was brought back from India to\r\ninstitute reforms. The first thing that the new Inspector-General of\r\nCavalry insisted upon was a revised Cavalry Drill Book. Who was to\r\nwrite it? The answer was not easy. But eventually Colonel French was\r\ncalled in from his retirement and installed in the Horse Guards for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe result was a masterpiece of lucid explanation and terse precision.\r\nThe book evolved into something much more than a mere manual of drill.\r\nFor it is also a treatise on cavalry tactics, a guide to modern\r\nstrategy, and a complete code of regulations for the organisation of\r\nmounted troops.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the book issued than another problem arose. Who was to\r\ncarry out all these drastic alterations? Once again, recourse was had\r\nto the half-pay Colonel in Kent! Who so fit to materialise reforms as\r\nthe man who had conceived them? So in 1895 Colonel French was\r\nensconced in the War Office as Assistant Adjutant-General of Cavalry.\r\nThere were great reforms instituted.\r\n\r\nBritish cavalry was placed on a brigade establishment at home\r\nstations. Which means that, for the first time, three regiments were\r\ngrouped into a brigade and placed under the command of a staff\r\ncolonel, who was entirely responsible for their training. In the\r\nsummer months the regiments were massed for combined training.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the revolution he was accomplishing, it is doubtful\r\nwhether French was at all happy at the War Office. He is essentially a\r\nman of action. Unlike Kitchener, he prefers execution to organisation,\r\nand he probably chafed horribly over the interminable disentangling of\r\nknots which is efficient organisation. His one consolation was the\r\nsolution every night before he left his desk of a refreshing problem\r\nin tactics.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: FROM STOOL TO SADDLE]\r\n\r\nThere are endless stories of his pacing up and down that back room in\r\nPall Mall like a caged lion. Like Mr. Galsworthy's Ferrand he hates to\r\ndo \"round business on an office stool.\" His temperament is entirely\r\ndynamic. Everything static and stay-at-home is utter boredom to him.\r\nProbably no soldier ever showed the qualities and the limitations of\r\nthe man of action in more vivid contrast.\r\n\r\nHis trials, however, were not of long duration. So soon as the brigade\r\nsystem had been fully organised he was given command of one of the\r\nunits which he had created--the Second Cavalry Brigade at Canterbury.\r\nHere he was able to achieve one of his most notable successes. It\r\nhappened during the 1898 manoeuvres. As commander of a brigade, French\r\nwas chosen to lead Buller's force in the mimic campaign. His opponent\r\nwas General Talbot, an older officer who worked on the stereo-typed\r\nmethods. The antiquity of his antagonist's ideas gave French his\r\nopportunity. He made such a feature of reconnaissance that the experts\r\ndeclared his tactics to be hopelessly rash. But by the mobility of his\r\nforce he continually checked and out-manoeuvred his opponent--appearing\r\nin the most unexpected places in the most unaccountable ways.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE CRITICS ROUTED]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the manoeuvres the fighting centred round Yarmbury\r\nCastle. All day French had been harassing General Talbot's forces. At\r\nlast, by a rapid movement, his cavalry surprised several batteries of\r\nthe enemy's horse artillery. He commanded them to dismount and made\r\nthe whole force his prisoners. When the umpires upheld his claim, the\r\nexperts aforesaid were given considerable food for thought.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion was that luck had contributed to his success,\r\nand that in actual warfare such recklessness might lead to disaster.\r\nConsequently, French's opponents were justified to some extent in\r\ntheir insistence that the old methods were best. Indeed, his success\r\nonly strengthened prejudice in certain quarters.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, the original mind won the day. And in 1899, French\r\nwas given command of the first cavalry brigade at Aldershot, with the\r\nrank of Major-General. This is the highest post open to a cavalry\r\nofficer in his own sphere during the time of peace. Thus French's\r\ncritics were finally routed, and he was free at last to train British\r\ncavalry according to his own brilliant and original ideas.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] To General Bewicke Copley the writer is indebted for much kind\r\nassistance in writing this chapter.\r\n\r\n[7] Quoted in _M.A.P._, March 3, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nELANDSLAAGTE AND RIETFONTEIN\r\n\r\n    The Unknown Commander of Cavalry--Who is General\r\n    French?--Advancing without Reinforcements--\"This is your\r\n    Show, French\"--The White Flag--The Chess-Player--The Victor\r\n    in Anecdote.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the South African War until the outbreak of the\r\nEuropean War the British nation had never taken its army seriously. At\r\nbest it had shown very tepid interest in its work. Some brief Indian\r\nskirmishing might momentarily flash the names of a few regiments or a\r\nstray general upon the public mind. But for the most part we were\r\ncontent to take the army very much for granted, forgetful of Mr.\r\nDooley's sage pronouncement that \"Standing armies are useful in time\r\nof war.\" Prior to the Boer War the public ignorance on the subject was\r\neven more appalling.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A NEW STAR]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the South African campaign there was a good deal of\r\nvague discussion as to who should have the cavalry command in Natal.\r\nBut General French was not one of the officers prominently mentioned.\r\nYet, he had already risen to a position analogous to that which\r\nGeneral von Bernhardi then occupied in the German army. In any other\r\nEuropean country his name would have been practically a household\r\nword. Even to the English newspaper writer it was a paradox and a\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\"Who is this General French?\" people asked one another, when news of\r\nhis first victories came to hand. Scarcely anyone was able to answer\r\nthe question. One finds curious corroboration of the prevailing\r\nignorance of French's career in a society journal of that date. In\r\nJanuary of 1900, a then most popular social medium was almost\r\npathetically confessing its perturbation on the point. After giving a\r\ndescription of General French, the writer goes on rather in wrath than\r\nin apology--\"Since I wrote the above paragraph, I have found a letter\r\nin an Irish paper, which declares that the French of whom I have just\r\nspoken is not the hero of Colesberg. The French of whom I have spoken\r\nis George Arthur (_sic_), while the Colesberg French is John Denton\r\nPinkstone French. Of John Denton Pinkstone French I have found no\r\ndetails in any of the ordinary books of reference. Probably some\r\ncorrespondent will supply me with the details.\" There was a lapse or\r\nsix weeks before any further information was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nBut there was one man who knew his French. General Sir Redvers Buller\r\nhad found his worth on the Nile Expedition, in repeated autumn\r\nmanoeuvres at home, and in many a long discussion on military topics.\r\nHis casting vote, therefore, made French Commander of Cavalry in\r\nNatal.\r\n\r\nMajor Arthur Griffiths has supplied an admirable little sketch of\r\nFrench's appearance at this time. \"He is short and thick, and of\r\nrather ungainly figure. Although he can stick on a horse as well as\r\nanyone, rides with a strong seat, and is indefatigable in the saddle,\r\nhe is not at all a pretty horseman. His mind is more set on\r\nessentials, on effective leadership with all it means, rather than\r\nwhat soldiers call 'Spit and polish': he is sound in judgment,\r\nclear-headed, patient, taking everything quietly, the rough with the\r\nsmooth; but he is always on the spot, willing to wait, and still more\r\nready to act, when the opportunity comes, with tremendous effect.\"\r\n\r\nThat description is true in general, if not in detail. For patience is\r\ncertainly not one of French's personal, if it be one of his military\r\nvirtues. A close friend of his agreed to the word \"tempestuous,\" as\r\nmost nicely describing his temperament. Like every good soldier, in\r\nfact, French has a temper, for which he is none the worse. If apt to\r\nflame out suddenly, it quickly burns itself out, leaving no touch of\r\nresentment in the scorched.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: RECALLED TO LADYSMITH]\r\n\r\nTen days after the Boer ultimatum had been delivered to the British\r\nagent at Pretoria, French was in Ladysmith. He arrived there, to be\r\npedantically accurate, on October 20, 1899, at 5 a.m. At 11 a.m. he\r\nwas in the saddle, leading a column out to recapture the railway\r\nstation at Elandslaagte, which, with a newly-arrived train of troops,\r\nthe Boers had seized overnight. No sooner had his men begun to locate\r\nthe enemy, than French was recalled to Ladysmith. Reluctantly the men\r\nturned back to reinforce Sir George White's small garrison, for what\r\nhe feared might prove a night attack. Soon afterwards, however, news\r\nof General Symons' victory at Talana came in to cheer the men after\r\ntheir fruitless sortie.\r\n\r\nAt once Sir George White saw his opportunity. It was the Boers, and\r\nnot the British, who now stood in peril of a sudden attack. There was\r\nlittle sleep for French's men that night. At 4 a.m. next morning they\r\nwere again on the march for Elandslaagte.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock on one of those perfect mist-steeped summer\r\nmornings that presage a day of burning heat, French's force came in\r\nsight of the Boer laagers. As the mist cleared the enemy could be\r\nspied in large numbers about the station and the colliery buildings\r\nand over the yellow veldt. French ordered the Natal Battery to turn\r\nits little seven-pounder on the station. One of the first shots told;\r\nand the Boers came tumbling out of their shelter, leaving the\r\ntrainload of British soldiers, captured the previous night, free to\r\njoin their comrades. Soon afterwards the station was in the hands of\r\nthe British, as the result of a dashing cavalry charge.\r\n\r\nBut the Boers were only temporarily dislodged. Their long range guns\r\nvery soon shelled the station from the neighbouring kopjes with deadly\r\neffect. French was compelled to withdraw. The stupidity of the enemy,\r\nin leaving the telegraph wires uncut, enabled him immediately to\r\nacquaint Sir George White with the peril of his situation. White's\r\norders were emphatic: \"The enemy must be beaten and driven off. Time\r\nof great importance.\" The necessary reinforcements were hurried to the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: IN HIS ELEMENT]\r\n\r\nFrench did not wait for their arrival before striking at the enemy.\r\nThe Light Horse, under Colonel Scott Chisholme, quickly took\r\npossession of a low ridge near the railway station, which fronted the\r\nmain line of the enemy's kopjes. While he held this ridge French had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing infantry, cavalry and artillery coming up\r\nthe railway line to his assistance. In the late afternoon his force\r\nnumbered something like three thousand five hundred men, outnumbering\r\nthe enemy by more than two to one.\r\n\r\nThose who ask why so many men were required, do not understand the\r\nposition in which the British force found itself. The enemy were\r\nentrenched on a series of high, boulder-strewn tablelands, which\r\noffered almost perfect cover. Between these tablelands and French's\r\nforce lay a wide and partly scrubless stretch of veldt. Over that\r\nterrible exposed slope his men must go, before they could come within\r\nuseful range of the enemy. French was faced with a most perilous and\r\ndifficult enterprise. However, that is precisely what French likes. He\r\nrose to the situation with ready resource. It was not easy to locate\r\nthe exact position of the enemy ensconced amid these covering hills.\r\nSo in the afternoon he ordered a simultaneous frontal and flank\r\nattack. Just which was front and which was flank it was for his\r\nlieutenants to discover. Sir Ian Hamilton's instructions to the\r\ninfantry were brief but decisive. \"The enemy are there,\" he said, \"and\r\nI hope you will shift them out before sunset--in fact, I know you\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the action had fairly commenced, Sir George White and his staff\r\ngalloped over from Ladysmith. French approached, saluted, and asked\r\nfor instructions. The chivalrous White's only reply was, \"Go on,\r\nFrench; this is your show.\" All the afternoon he stayed on the field,\r\nwatching the progress of events, and approving French's dispositions.\r\n\r\nThe battle proved to be, in many ways, one of the most spectacular in\r\nhistory. For as the infantry advanced, under a steady hail of shell\r\nand bullets, the sky began to darken. The Boer positions stood\r\nsilhouetted by stray puffs of white smoke against a lowering cumulus\r\nof clouds. While the artillery on both sides shook the ground with an\r\ninferno of sound, the storm burst. The thunder of the heavens became a\r\nspasmodic chorus to the roar of the guns. One correspondent has\r\ndescribed how he found himself mechanically humming the \"Ride of the\r\nValkyries\" that was being played on such a dread orchestra. Slipping\r\nand stumbling, cursing and cheering, the Devons crept forward across\r\nthe sodden grass. Many of the bravest, among them Chisholme, went down\r\non that plain of death. Far beyond the level veldt there were\r\nsomething like 800 feet to climb in the face of Mauser and shrapnel.\r\nAt length, however, the top of the ridge was reached. There stood the\r\nthree guns that had wrought such havoc, now silent among the corpses\r\nof the frock-coated burghers who had served them.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE WHITE FLAG TRICK]\r\n\r\nThe Boers still kept up the fight, however, on the further side of the\r\nplateau. The cheering Gordons, the Manchesters and the Devons now\r\nflung themselves at the remnant of the foe. Suddenly a white flag was\r\nseen to flutter defeat from a kopje beyond the laager. On the instant\r\nthe soldiers paused at the surprising notes of the \"Cease fire,\"\r\nfollowed by the \"Retire.\" For a moment they wavered between discipline\r\nand dismay. At that instant from a small kopje east of the nek came a\r\nviolent burst of firing as some fifty of the enemy made a last effort\r\nto regain their position.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary panic in the British lines. But a little bugler\r\nshouted \"Retire be damned,\" and sounded the \"Advance.\" Gradually the\r\ninfantry recovered, and the Gordons and Devons, rushing on the enemy,\r\ntook a fearful revenge for the dastardly trick.\r\n\r\nFrench had scored his first victory within a day of his arrival. What\r\nwonder if men called him \"French the lucky?\" From now onwards that\r\ntradition was to cling to his name. But a great deal more than luck\r\nwent to the winning of Elandslaagte. Had French not advanced his men\r\nthroughout in open formation, the day might never have been his. It\r\nhas been said that he was our only general to master the Boer methods.\r\nHe was certainly the first and the most able imitator of those\r\nmethods. But he was prepared to meet them before he ever stepped on\r\nSouth African soil. For his whole theory of cavalry tactics is based\r\non the realisation that massive formations are now hopelessly out of\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: LUCK OR BRAINS]\r\n\r\nOne of the newspaper correspondents[8] happened to run across French\r\ntwice during the battle. He tells how at the end of the engagement he\r\nmet the General, who had come along the ridge in the fighting line of\r\nthe Manchesters and Gordons, and offered him his congratulations on\r\nthe day. He adds: \"Last time I had met him was when the artillery on\r\nboth sides were hard at it; he appeared then more like a man playing a\r\ngame of chess than a game of war, and was not too busy to sympathise\r\nwith me on the badness of the light when he saw me trying to take\r\nsnap-shots of the Boer shells bursting amid the Imperial Light Horse\r\nnear us.\"\r\n\r\nFrench's luck lay in his ability to see his opportunities and grasp\r\nthem. But the soldier will never be convinced on that point, even if\r\nFrench himself attempt his conversion. For him the British leader has\r\nremained \"The luckiest man in the army\" ever since Elandslaagte. Yet\r\nin a letter to Lady French after the engagement he had written, \"I\r\nnever thought I would come out alive.\"\r\n\r\nAs frequently happened in the South African campaign, success could\r\nnot be followed up. Having cleared the railway line, French was unable\r\nto garrison his position, and returned next morning to Ladysmith. A\r\ncouple of days later he was again in action, and again he was\r\nsuccessful. It had become necessary to keep the way open for General\r\nYule and his jaded forces now in retreat from Dundee. White determined\r\nto sally out and distract the enemy. Once again the heavy share of the\r\nwork fell on French and his cavalry.\r\n\r\nMarching out from the town towards Modder Spruit they found the enemy\r\nholding a range of hills about seven miles from Ladysmith.\r\n\r\nFlanked by the artillery, and supported from the rear by rifle fire,\r\nthe infantry advanced to a convenient ridge from which the Boer\r\nposition might be shelled. There they were joined by the field and\r\nmountain batteries, whose well-directed fire played great havoc among\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nDuring the engagement one costly mistake was made. The Gloucesters on\r\nreaching the summit of the slope, attempted to descend on the other\r\nside. Their advancing lines were ploughed down by a deadly fire. \"In\r\nthe first three minutes,\" said an eye-witness, \"Colonel Wilford, who\r\nwas commanding the regiment, had fallen shot through the head, and a\r\nnumber of the men lay dead and dying about him. So fierce was the\r\nattack that no living thing could have remained upon the exposed\r\nslope, which boasted not even a shred of cover of any kind.\" Slowly\r\nand silently the Gloucesters retired.\r\n\r\nBy two o'clock the infantry fire had ceased, and White had received\r\nnews that Yule was nearing Ladysmith in safety. He therefore decided\r\nto withdraw his troops. This was no easy matter, for the Boers,\r\ninstead of relinquishing their position, had merely retired for a\r\nshort distance. The retreat, however, was safely carried out, thanks\r\nlargely to the masterly fashion in which French's cavalry covered the\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nFrom a military point of view the engagement would scarcely be called\r\nimportant. But from a strategic point of view it was invaluable. It\r\ncertainly saved General Yule's force, which the Boers would otherwise\r\nhave cut off on its way to Ladysmith. This would scarcely have been\r\ndifficult, for the column was in no condition to fight. That it\r\ncovered twenty-three miles without food, water, or rest before\r\nnightfall in its exhausted condition was in itself remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE ONLY GENERAL]\r\n\r\nThis was the last successful engagement that the British forces were\r\nto fight for many a day. But that was not French's fault. In the first\r\nweek after his arrival he had scored two distinct successes and won\r\nfor himself a reputation among the Boers. He was indeed the only\r\nBritish general for whom they at that time expressed the very\r\nslightest respect. In a week his name became a by-word among them. A\r\nsoldier[9] has recorded how, when towns or railway stations were\r\ncaptured, our men would find allusions to French chalked on the wall.\r\nThus: \"We are not fighting the English--they don't count--we are only\r\nfighting the 'French.'\" Quite early in the campaign this inscription\r\nwas found on the wall of a Boer farm house: \"Why are we bound to win?\r\nBecause although we have only 90,000 burghers, that means 90,000\r\ngenerals--but the English, though they have 200,000 soldiers, have\r\nonly one General--and he is French.\" That was in the days before\r\nRoberts and Kitchener were on the scene.\r\n\r\nBut the Boers were not alone in their appreciation of French. One of\r\nthe authorities of the German General Staff wrote of him \"His\r\n(French's) name was one of those most dreaded by the enemy,\" and \"he\r\nimpressed his personality on the troops.\" Perhaps the best description\r\nof the man ever penned, however, came from the brilliant American\r\njournalist, Julian Ralph. \"As to his personality, the phrase 'The\r\nsquare little General' would serve to describe him in army circles\r\nwithout a mention of his name.\r\n\r\n\"He is quiet, undemonstrative, easy, and gentle. When you are under\r\nhis command you don't notice him, you don't think about him--unless\r\nyou are a soldier, and then you are glad you are there.\"[10]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [8] The correspondent referred to is Mr. George Lynch.\r\n\r\n [9] \"A.D.C.\" _The Regiment_.\r\n\r\n[10] In the _Daily Mail_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE TIDE TURNS\r\n\r\n    White's Dash from Ladysmith--Nicholson's Nek--The Reverse at\r\n    Lombard's Kop--A Cavalry Exploit--French's Dramatic Escape\r\n    from Ladysmith.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far the tide of battle had flowed fairly equally between the two\r\narmies. Thanks to French, White had won the two engagements which he\r\nhad to undertake in order to save Yule's column. In Ladysmith he had\r\nnow an admirably proportioned force of 10,000 men, quite adequate for\r\nthe town's defence. Across the Atlantic an Army Corps was hastening to\r\nhis succour. He had only to sit still and wait in Ladysmith,\r\nfortifying it with all the ingenuity that time would permit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he was not content to sit still and wait behind his\r\nentrenchments. He determined not to be hemmed in without a struggle.\r\nBe it remembered that at that time the British commanders had not\r\nfully realised the numbers, the equipment and the intrepidity of\r\ntheir opponents. The traditional chastening of experience was still\r\nwanting. As Napier has it, \"In the beginning of each war England has\r\nto seek in blood the knowledge necessary to ensure success; and, like\r\nthe fiend's progress towards Eden, her conquering course is through\r\nchaos followed by death.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a very beautiful if a rather optimistic plan of attack that\r\nWhite arranged for the morning of October 30. He divided his forces\r\ninto three columns. During the night of the 29th Colonel Carleton,\r\nwith the Irish Fusiliers and the Gloucesters, was to advance upon and\r\nseize a long ridge called Nicholson's Nek, some six miles north of\r\nLadysmith. This would protect his left wing. On the right flank the\r\ninfantry were to advance under cover of French's cavalry and mounted\r\ninfantry, while the artillery was to advance in the centre.\r\n\r\nProvided that all went well the plan was of course superb. No sooner\r\nhad the main army won their action at Lombard's Cop than it would\r\nswing round to the right and wedge the Boers in between its artillery\r\nand the force on Nicholson's Nek. But suppose anything happened to\r\nCarleton? Or suppose that the main action was lost? In either case\r\ndisaster would be inevitable. In the event, French was alone able to\r\nstick to his time table. Misfortune befell both Carleton on the left,\r\nand Grimwood on the right.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE MULES BOLT]\r\n\r\nAt 10.0 p.m. Carleton was on the march; and two and a half hours later\r\nGrimwood's brigade had set out eastward. By some mistake two of his\r\nbattalions followed the artillery to the left instead of taking the\r\ninfantry route. Of that error Grimwood remained in ignorance until he\r\nreached his destination near the south eastern flank of Long Hill\r\ntowards dawn. Soon afterwards the Gordon Highlanders were amazed to\r\nfind an officer in their ranks from Carleton's column, jaded and\r\nspent. He reported that all the mules of his battery had bolted and\r\nhad not been recovered.\r\n\r\nThe day had begun with a double disaster. Grimwood's force was not all\r\nat White's disposal; Carleton's was not to appear at all. Never had a\r\ngeneral's plans gone more thoroughly agley.\r\n\r\nOf the unequal engagement which ensued little need be said here. A\r\nludicrously insufficient force was attempting to encircle a larger and\r\nbetter equipped one. The result was not long in doubt. Although\r\nWhite's forty-two guns pounded away bravely, they were no match for\r\nthe heavy artillery of the enemy. One huge Creusot gun had been\r\ndragged to the top of Pepworth Hill whence it threw a 96lb. shell a\r\ndistance of four miles. There were also several 40 lb. howitzers which\r\nhopelessly outranged the British guns.\r\n\r\nFrom a front over eight miles in extent there poured in a converging\r\nartillery fire against which our guns could do nothing. Gradually the\r\nright flank was pushed back along with the centre; and the left flank\r\nwas now non-existent. During the afternoon the inevitable retirement\r\ntook place, under the Creusot's shells. Had not Captain Hedworth\r\nLambton rapidly silenced the gun on Pepworth Hill with his naval\r\nbattery, opportunely arrived at the critical moment, the retreat might\r\nwell have been a rout. As it was the tired force which wandered back\r\nto Ladysmith had left 300 men on the field.\r\n\r\nIrretrievable disaster had overtaken Carleton's column. While\r\nbreasting Nicholson's Nek in the darkness the men were surprised at\r\nthe sudden clattering by of a Boer picquet. The transport mules,\r\npanic-stricken, fled _en masse_, wrecking the column as they stampeded\r\ndown the hillside, felling men as they went. It was a gunless,\r\nammunitionless and weary column which the Boers surprised in the early\r\nmorning. The end was the surrender of the force to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A BRILLIANT SUCCESS]\r\n\r\nThe British position was now serious. Nothing could prevent Sir George\r\nWhite and his forces from being cooped in either Colenso or Ladysmith.\r\nBut it is typical of French that he found a last opportunity of\r\nout-manoeuvring the Boers before leaving Ladysmith. In the battle of\r\nLombard's Cop his cavalry had taken but a small part. Had some of\r\nthem, however, been sent with Carlton's column to keep it in touch\r\nwith the base, the issue of its enterprise might possibly have been\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nA couple of days afterwards, on November 2, French found an\r\nopportunity to score. The Boers had moved round our lines and posted\r\ntheir guns in a very advantageous position. White therefore ordered a\r\nbombardment by the naval guns to which the Boers replied. Whilst they\r\nwere so engaged French crept round behind Bester's Hill, where the\r\nBoer commander had a large camp. Before Joubert realised what the\r\nmovement meant French was upon him. Field artillery, along with the\r\nnaval guns, supported his advance. While this double fire was\r\ndistracting the Boers, French stormed their laager. The enemy fled,\r\nleaving their camp and all its equipments to French. This brilliant\r\nlittle success was practically a cavalry exploit, and it was typical\r\nof much that was to follow.\r\n\r\nIt now became obvious that Ladysmith was becoming completely invested.\r\nThe Boer lines which had been three miles from the town were creeping\r\nnearer. Assuredly the belligerent town was no place for a cavalry\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE ESCAPE]\r\n\r\nFrench determined to leave Ladysmith. It would not be easy to break\r\nthrough the lines of the net that was closing round the city. Whether\r\nor no the railway was still open was uncertain. When French's\r\naide-de-camp, Lieutenant Milbanke, now Sir John Milbanke, V.C., asked\r\nthe station-master whether a special train could get through to\r\nPietermaritzburg, that worthy indignantly scorned the idea. With the\r\nBoers at Colenso it would certainly be madness--a fool's errand.\r\nMilbanke, however, used persuasions which resulted in an effort being\r\nmade to run the gauntlet. That evening an engine and a few carriages\r\nduly drew up at the station. Very soon French's staff was aboard. As\r\nthe train was about to start a short and agile elderly officer might\r\nhave been seen to dash across the platform into the last carriage,\r\nwhere he ensconced himself beneath a seat lest the train be stopped\r\nand searched. Very soon bullets were rattling through the carriage\r\nwindows, and it was an excessively uncomfortable journey that the\r\nBritish General and his staff endured. But they were at last free to\r\ncarry out fresh services for their country. Five months were to pass\r\nbefore another train crossed these metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN ROUND COLESBERG\r\n\r\n    The Fog of War--A Perilous Situation--Damming \"The Flowing\r\n    Tide\"--Shows His Genius as a Commander--A Campaign in\r\n    Miniature--Hoisting Guns on Hilltops--The Fifty-mile\r\n    Front--Saving the Situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far French had justified the tradition which called him lucky. Any\r\ncompetent and experienced general _might_, with luck, have won the\r\nbattle of Elandslaagte. That victory did not mark French out as a\r\ncommander of genius. But what followed in the campaign round Colesberg\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nIt is very much to be regretted that the circumstances of the case\r\nforced this campaign to be fought amid an unusually dense variety of\r\n\"the fog of war.\" Owing to the difficulty and danger of the operations\r\nand the extended front on which they were carried out, any newspaper\r\ncorrespondent present could hope to chronicle only a sub-section of\r\nthe action. The public, therefore, was without any complete record of\r\nwhat happened.[11] To the man in the street the British general and his\r\nforces seemed to spend three months in perpetual dodging in and about\r\nsome thirty square miles of kopjed veldt.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE \"INEFFICIENT\" GENERAL]\r\n\r\nYet French's column was the pivot on which the whole British plan\r\nturned. This campaign in miniature gave French his chance finally to\r\ndisprove the fallacies of the critics at home. Before his appointment\r\nin October, he had actually been described by some of his opponents as\r\n\"inefficient to command in the field.\" This is the tragedy of many a\r\nbrilliant cavalry leader--it is impossible for him to demonstrate his\r\nability save in actual warfare.\r\n\r\nWhen French went down to Cape Town to consult with General Buller, he\r\nfound his Chief oppressed by serious misgivings. Sir George White and\r\nhis force were surrounded in Ladysmith; Mafeking and Kimberley were\r\nboth invested by the enemy; and a great invasion was threatened along\r\nthe whole northern boundary of Cape Colony. To deal with all these\r\ndifficulties Buller had only one army corps. One column, under Lord\r\nMethuen, was advancing to the relief of Kimberley; another, under\r\nGeneral Gatacre, was attempting to stem the Boer invasion of Cape\r\nColony; while a third, to be led by Buller himself, was massing at\r\nChieveley, prior to advancing to the relief of Ladysmith. French was\r\ngiven command of a fourth column with which he was to harass the Boers\r\naround Colesberg. A Boer commando under Schoeman had seized a passage\r\non the Orange River at Norval's Pont on November 1. On the 14th the\r\nBoers entered Colesberg; and a proclamation was issued declaring the\r\ndistrict to be a Free State territory.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: WORRYING TACTICS]\r\n\r\nFrom the first no striking victories were anticipated for French's\r\nlittle force. It was to act as a dam, rather than as a weapon of\r\ndestruction. It was a rather flimsy dam at that. Buller's\r\ninstructions, which at first spoke of a \"flying column,\" soon declined\r\nto suggestions of \"a policy of worry without risking men.\" In\r\nparticular it was to stop raids on the railway line which might impede\r\nMethuen's advance on Kimberley.\r\n\r\nCollecting a part of his force at Cape Town, French left on November\r\n18. On the following night he reached De Aar, where Major-General\r\nWauchope gave him another couple of companies of Mounted Infantry.\r\nActing on Wauchope's advice, he determined to make Naauwpoort his\r\nbase. Buller had suggested Hanover Road. But French on arrival found\r\nthat Wauchope was right. The country round Naauwpoort proved to be\r\nmuch more level, was less closely laced with wire fences, and afforded\r\nbetter means of communication both by road and rail.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he arrived (on November 21) than he ordered a\r\nreconnaissance to be made on the following morning. His cavalry came\r\nwithin eight miles of Colesberg, without seeing the enemy. Accordingly\r\nFrench determined to attack the town, and asked for reinforcements of\r\ncavalry for that purpose. On November 23, however, further\r\nreconnaissance supported by a trainload of infantry showed that the\r\nsituation had developed. It was found impossible to approach Arundel,\r\nas the kopjes north of Arundel station were occupied by the Boers.\r\n\r\nReporting the state of affairs to headquarters, French said that, in\r\nhis opinion, the Boers should be pushed out of Colesberg immediately,\r\nas they were being reinforced daily, and were spreading disaffection\r\nthroughout the Colony. But he was not in a position to do more than\r\nworry the enemy for several days. However, his persistent\r\nnight-and-day fretting of Schoeman's forces achieved the desired\r\nresult. His ubiquitous patrols seriously alarmed the Boer general as\r\nto the safety of his outposts at Arundel. A squadron of Lancers\r\ndiscovered one day that the kopjes round Arundel had been evacuated.\r\n\r\nAfter that a dash on the town followed. Here again the policy of nag\r\nand bluster had frightened the Boers out of their position. There were\r\nonly a hundred men in it when the British force arrived; and they fled\r\nprecipitately at the mere sight of it. Next day, Colonel Porter struck\r\neven farther north with his cavalry and mounted infantry, occupying a\r\nkopje three miles north of the town.\r\n\r\nThere followed a brief lapse in active hostilities. The Boers heavily\r\nentrenched themselves on the neighbouring hills; and a prisoner taken\r\nby our men said that Schoeman had at least 3,000 men, with some useful\r\nguns, and was waiting for further reinforcements.\r\n\r\nFrench's position now became critical in more than one sense of the\r\nword. For in mid-December news of the triple British disaster came\r\nthrough to hearten Schoeman and his men. Cronje had inflicted a\r\ncrushing defeat on Methuen at Magersfontein; Botha had crippled Buller\r\nat Colenso; and Gatacre's force had met with a reverse at Stormberg.\r\nElated by his colleagues' successes, Schoeman was spoiling for the\r\nfray. Could he once gain a victory over French, the whole of Cape\r\nColony would probably join the rebellion. Both east and west the Dutch\r\npopulation were simply waiting a sign to rise.\r\n\r\nWith the whole of South Africa in revolt, our position of \"splendid\r\nisolation\" in Europe might well have induced Continental\r\ncomplications. The foreign Press, indeed, was almost unanimous in its\r\njubilations over this series of disasters. The German papers in\r\nparticular, filled their pages with the most atrocious insults and\r\njibes. Such was the situation in \"Black Week.\" There was much ominous\r\ntalk on the Continent about \"the flowing tide.\" Only one obstacle\r\nprevented these dire prophecies from coming true. French and his\r\nlittle force possibly stayed the tide of a world conflict, through\r\nchecking the rebel torrent between Naauwpoort and Colesberg.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A TIGHT CORNER]\r\n\r\nIt is typical of his perfect _sang froid_, that in this excessively\r\ntight corner, French found time to send a cheering Christmas greeting\r\nto friends at home. \"We shall drink your health on Christmas Day,\" he\r\nwired on behalf of himself and his staff, \"and we hope you are well,\r\nand having as good a time as we are.\"\r\n\r\nFrench's use of Arundel was masterly. For him to attack was\r\nimpossible; about this time he was outnumbered by something like five\r\nto one. His one aim, therefore, was to keep the Boers from the\r\nrailway line. The moment that his scouts discovered the Boers throwing\r\nout detachments to defend a kopje, French would have an elaborate\r\nattack, or a reconnaissance in force to drive the enemy in. At this\r\ntime scarcely a day passed without its \"affair\" of one sort or\r\nanother. If it was not a night attack, then it was a miniature siege,\r\nor a flanking movement--or a piece of bluff! His men were in the\r\nsaddle night and day. One of those present has related how he\r\npractically lived on his horse for two months.\r\n\r\nDid Schoeman attempt to force a pitched battle, then French, by a\r\nseries of simultaneous flank and rear movements, would harass him out\r\nof the possibility of a general action. It is doubtful, indeed,\r\nwhether during this lively period of his life the Boer commander ever\r\nreally had time to meet either his fellow commanders or his\r\nlieutenants and discuss a concerted plan of action. No sooner was a\r\ngeneral movement visible in the Boer camps, than French and his men\r\nswept out, or threatened to sweep out, on some dangerous design. Every\r\nmorning the General himself made a personal reconnaissance in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A BRILLIANT EXPLOIT]\r\n\r\nDuring his reconnaissance on December 31, French came to the\r\nconclusion that an offensive movement was at last possible. Colesberg\r\nlies in a little plateau, ringed round by a quadrangle of kopjes, all\r\nof which were strongly held by the enemy. Just beyond this quadrangle,\r\nhowever, one or two kopjes projected from its western face. French\r\ndetermined to seize one of these, from which he could push forward\r\nalong the enemy's flank, jeopardising his line of retreat.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the venture was brilliantly conceived and ably carried out.\r\nDuring the day a squadron of Hussars was sent forward to Maeder's\r\nFarm, some five miles on the line of march. There the men bivouacked\r\nunder arms, and at midnight set out on a silent march to the west.\r\nUnder the screen of darkness and perfect silence the advance was\r\nspeedy. Even the regimental carts were dispensed with, lest the\r\ncreaking of their wheels might betray the advance. Not until the\r\ncolumn was near its objective, McCracken's Hill, did the Boers suspect\r\nits approach. An amazed shouting and some wild rifle-fire from the\r\noutposts--and McCracken's Hill was in French's hands.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry now wound round the hill towards the road. But their\r\ncommander, Colonel Fisher, found it impossible to take the hills\r\ncommanding the road. As generally happened, a complicated engagement\r\nensued. The Boers attempted to retake McCracken's Hill next morning,\r\nadding a counter-attack to the north-east and an enveloping movement\r\non the right to the already complex situation. But French checkmated\r\nevery move, although he finally thought it wise that Colonel Fisher\r\nshould evacuate the hill he had so cleverly won. That night both\r\nFrench and Schoeman were wiring for reinforcements in the hope of\r\nclearing up the situation.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE FATE OF THE SUFFOLKS]\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards came the only reverse which French ever received\r\nat the hands of the Boers. There has been endless argument as to who\r\nwas directly responsible for the disaster to the Suffolks. It seems\r\nbest simply to record the fact that the order was given by French as\r\nthe result of pressure brought to bear on him by the enthusiastic\r\ncolonel of the Suffolks. The key to the Boer stronghold lay in the\r\nkopje of Grassy Hill. Lieutenant-Colonel A.J. Watson had frequently\r\nreconnoitred the Boer position in company with General French. As a\r\nresult, he was confident that his battalion could rush the position.\r\nOn January 5 he begged for permission to attempt the feat. On the\r\nfollowing day French authorised him to make the attack should he see a\r\nfavourable opportunity, on condition that he first informed the\r\nGeneral of his plans and probable time of attack. This he failed to\r\ndo, and that night, without further warning, Watson and his men crept\r\nnoiselessly out of camp, walking either in canvas shoes or in\r\nstocking-soles in order to deaden the noise of their footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe foremost ranks were scrambling breathlessly towards the summit,\r\nwhen a withering Boer fire fell upon their panting lines. It was clear\r\nthat they were not only discovered but expected. Watson ordered a\r\nwithdrawal. But withdrawal from that stark boulder-strewn hill-side\r\nwas almost an impossibility. The column fell into disorder, some\r\nadvancing and some retreating, under a fierce fire from the enemy.\r\nWatson himself gathered together the rear company and attempted, with\r\nreckless gallantry, to lead it to the summit. He was among the first\r\nto fall, riddled with bullets, and although his officers perished with\r\nhim almost to a man, the men beat a hasty retreat, in face of the\r\nenemy's destructive fire. The affair accounted in all for eleven\r\nofficers and 150 men. No doubt the gallant Watson was largely to\r\nblame. But the facts seemed to show that the enemy were in some way\r\napprised of his intentions. Against such a chance as this, strategy\r\nand generalship are helpless. Certainly French would be the last man\r\nin the world to deny any responsibility, had he been to blame for\r\nthat one mishap in a memorable campaign.\r\n\r\nOne fact was now clear beyond dispute. The enemy's right had been\r\nstrongly reinforced and was too alert to allow of much hope of\r\nsuccessful action against it. Nothing daunted, French therefore\r\ndirected his energies to the left. A few days later (January 11) he\r\naccomplished the _tour de force_ of the campaign. In the plain to the\r\nwest of Colesberg there arose an isolated kopje, some six hundred feet\r\nin height, called Coles Kop. This hill, which rises almost sheer from\r\nthe plain, taxes the wind of the unencumbered climber to the utmost.\r\nBeing higher than the surrounding kopjes, it commands both Colesberg\r\nand the enemy's laager. The Boers had left it ungarrisoned, thinking\r\nit useless either to themselves or to the enemy. They made a very\r\ngreat mistake. For the mere hint that a thing is impossible fires\r\nFrench to attempt it.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: PREPARING A SURPRISE]\r\n\r\nOne day Schoeman woke up to find shrapnel assailing him apparently\r\nfrom nowhere. It was coming from a 15-pounder which Major E.E.A.\r\nButcher, R.F.A., had coaxed up to the top of Coles Kop in three and a\r\nhalf hours by dint of much scientific haulage and more sinew. The\r\nBoers themselves never equalled this extraordinary feat.\r\n\r\nTo hoist the guns on to the hilltop was the least part of the\r\nundertaking. Guns without ammunition are useless. To get shells on to\r\nthe kopje without disaster was an infinitely more difficult\r\nundertaking. He solved it by installing a hill lift. The veldt is not\r\na very promising engineering shop; but Butcher was not easily beaten.\r\nUsing steel rails for standards and anything worthy the name for\r\ncable, he soon had the framework erected. To the uprights were fixed\r\nsnatchblocks over which he passed his carrying wires. On this mountain\r\nlift he was able to send weights up to 30 lbs., thanks to an ingenious\r\nsystem of pulleys. Nor was the lift altogether rustic, for a drum and\r\nratchet made it double-acting, so that as one load went up another was\r\nautomatically let down. It is only fair to say that the Boers\r\nthemselves were masters of the art of haulage. How they managed to get\r\ntheir guns to the top of kopjes remained for long a mystery to our\r\nmen. Butcher, however, quickly taught his men to beat the enemy at\r\ntheir own game, although nothing else quite so dramatic as the Coles\r\nKop incident is on record.\r\n\r\nDuring this proceeding French had been distracting the enemy by a\r\ndemonstration to the south-east of Colesburg. Consequently the shells\r\nfrom nowhere began to pour into their laager during breakfast\r\n(January 12) with devastating results. The laager was instantly\r\nabandoned, and a second, two thousand yards farther off, suffered the\r\nsame fate. When Butcher had finally been able to get a second\r\n15-pounder up the hill, the Boers were compelled to shift every camp\r\nthey possessed into sheltered positions.\r\n\r\nMost of these exploits show the resource and the daring which mark\r\nFrench's tactics. But his caution is no less remarkable. One instance\r\nof it will suffice. Shortly after the Coles Kop incident, it was\r\ndiscovered that the Boers had left open a portion of the road from\r\nColesberg, where it goes through a narrow pass known as Plessis Poort.\r\nImmediately French planned its capture. One detachment was sent to\r\noccupy Bastard's Nek, another defile to the west of Plessis Poort.\r\nCovered by a cross-fire from the artillery, the infantry were to move\r\nforward and seize the road. In order to divert the Boers' attention\r\nfrom these matters, a demonstration was ordered along the whole\r\nBritish line. Advancing carefully the infantry met with little\r\nopposition, a fact which made French suspicious. As the silence\r\ncontinued he abruptly ordered the \"Retire.\" The moment that his men\r\nobeyed, a fierce fire broke out from the enemy, who were present in\r\nforce. French's caution was justified.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: MASTERS OF TACTICS]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the rival fronts had been gradually stretching\r\nout, in the constant effort to parry outflanking movements, until they\r\nreached the extraordinary length of fifty miles. Yet at the utmost\r\nneither general could throw more than ten thousand men into the field!\r\nDuring the last days of French's command, the fighting had become more\r\na matter of outpost skirmishes than anything else. The Boer generals,\r\nwho now included De Wet and Delarey, were entirely taken up with the\r\neffort to out-manoeuvre the irrepressible French.\r\n\r\nIt was here that French first mastered the new problem of modern\r\nwarfare--the extended front. The ability of the rival generals\r\ngradually gave the campaign the resemblance of a Mukden or a Mons in\r\nminiature. That the British force was not entirely out-manoeuvred by\r\nsuch masters of tactics as Delarey and De Wet says something for\r\nFrench's extraordinary mastery of a new method of warfare in something\r\nlike six weeks' time.\r\n\r\nHerein lies French's peculiar genius. Although he knows all the\r\nmethods of all the schoolmen, he is capable as one soldier expressed\r\nit, \"of making his own tactics brand new on the spot.\" To that fact\r\none may attribute his consistent superiority to the Boer. Where even\r\nKitchener and Roberts doubted, French invariably did the right thing.\r\nDuring the following fortnight he had more brilliant opportunities of\r\ndemonstrating his unique abilities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] To those interested enough to pursue the subject further, I\r\ncommend _With French and his Cavalry in South Africa_, by C.S.\r\nGoldman. (Macmillan & Co.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DASH TO KIMBERLEY\r\n\r\n    French's Pledge--The Task--The First Shell--\"Hemmed in\"--\"We\r\n    must break through\"--The Lancers' Charge--In and Out of\r\n    Kimberley--The Surrender of Cronje.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year French had saved the situation in Cape Colony.\r\nRealizing this, Roberts summoned him to Cape Town on more important\r\nbusiness. Into French's hands he placed the task which Methuen had\r\nfailed to accomplish through adverse circumstances--the Relief of\r\nKimberley. When Lord Roberts, with customary precision, had stated\r\nexactly what he wanted, he was surprised to receive a dramatic pledge\r\nfrom his General. \"I promise faithfully,\" said French, \"to relieve\r\nKimberley at 6 o'clock on the evening of the 15th, if I am alive.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why the case of Kimberley was considered so urgent by\r\nLord Roberts. There are those who have suggested that the presence of\r\nthe millionaire, Cecil Rhodes, in the beleaguered city was\r\nresponsible for the authorities' energy in the matter. The mere\r\nsuggestion, however, refutes itself. For Rhodes was the one man who\r\ndid more than any other to have the defences of the city brought into\r\na state of some sort of efficiency. The fact is that there was\r\ndiscontent among the civil population and a constant peril of\r\nsurrender. For this the great hundred pound shells which hurtled\r\ndestruction across the town's streets from the neighbouring heights\r\nwere chiefly responsible.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, French's promise might then have been taken for a\r\npiece of reckless bravado. The camp on the Modder River in which he\r\ngathered his forces together was over a hundred miles from Kimberley.\r\nThe commander-in-chief had promised him a full cavalry division of\r\neight thousand five hundred men. But on February 11, French had barely\r\nfour thousand eight hundred men, with seven batteries of Horse\r\nArtillery at his disposal. Between his camp and the mining city lay\r\nCronje with a mobile force as large as French's own. Add to this that\r\nthe ground to be covered consisted largely of arid and well-less\r\nveldt, affording neither food nor drink for man or beast. The time too\r\nwas the African summer, with all the difficulties of handling partly\r\nraw English troops to be faced. The task before French and his men\r\nwas certainly such as might have appalled a less courageous leader.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: DECEIVING CRONJE]\r\n\r\nGuile as well as daring had much to do with the success of the\r\nenterprise. The vast concentration camp, with its flapping seas of\r\ncanvas, was in itself a huge blind. Through its bustle and publicity\r\nFrench meant Cronje to conclude that he was about to force the Pass of\r\nMagersfontein, and thence to relieve Ladysmith. For this Cronje\r\nprepared himself with customary care. Meantime, French proceeded, as\r\never, to belie the very justifiable expectations he had aroused.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious route for French would be over Koodoesberg's Drift\r\ntowards the west. Accordingly Macdonald's Highland Brigade spent a\r\nstrenuous day in threatening the Drift and returned to camp.\r\n\r\nAfter a day's rest Macdonald's horses were again ready for the field.\r\nOn Sunday morning therefore, February 11, the long column filed\r\nsilently out of camp. At 10 o'clock the main body had covered 22\r\nmiles, reaching the farmhouse of Ramdam. By that time Cronje's\r\noutposts had probably realised that the camp which French had\r\ncarefully left standing at the Modder River was simply a city of\r\ncanvas from which the inhabitants had departed.\r\n\r\nNext day the force was again on the march at 3.0 a.m. It now took an\r\neasterly course in order to force a crossing on the Riet River. Its\r\ngoal was Waterval Drift. But so intense was the darkness that after an\r\nhour of difficult movement the General ordered a halt, until dawn,\r\nwhen he ordered the division to make the feint on Waterval. He was not\r\ncertain whether the Drift was held in force by the enemy or not. But\r\nvery soon conviction came in a shell nicely aimed at the General in\r\nperson. It burst between French and his staff. \"There are too many of\r\nus riding together,\" was his only comment, as he moved forward to\r\nreconnoitre the ground from the top of the nearest kopje.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Horse Artillery had the gun silenced, and the whole\r\ndivision swerved to the right just as the Boers drew off down stream\r\nto wait for the English crossing. Immediately the whole division was\r\nmaking for De Kiel's Drift further up stream. The banks proved to be\r\nsteep and difficult, but a ford was discovered. As the cavalry neared\r\nthe bank a party of Boers saw the ruse, and a neck-to-neck race for\r\nthe Drift began. By a piece of daring horsemanship our cavalry got\r\nhome first, and the Boers arrived too late to dispute their passage.\r\nBy mid-day the division was able to cross and bivouac on the right\r\nbank, pending the arrival of the baggage train, left far behind.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: DELAYED TRANSPORT]\r\n\r\nThe Riet River is by no means a refreshing torrent; it winds its slow\r\nway in muddy melancholy to the cleanly water of the Vaal. But at least\r\nit contained water in which both men and horses could forget the heat\r\nof the veldt. All day the weary cavalrymen waited for the supplies,\r\nwhich did not come until they were attempting to snatch a few hours of\r\nsleep. The transport horses stumbled and strained their way up the\r\nbanks in the early hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nThere was pleasant excitement in camp, however, when both Roberts and\r\nKitchener rode over to congratulate French on his progress, and wished\r\nhim \"good luck\" for the rest of the journey. But the delay in\r\ntransport was annoying to French. Neither the men nor their horses\r\nreceived any supplies until the morning was well advanced. And the sun\r\nwas already scorching the veldt before the division was ready to\r\nadvance. That delay was to be paid for in sweat and suffering. On that\r\nday alone over one hundred horses died or fell out from exhaustion.\r\nTheir tired riders were forced to trudge across the veldt at what pace\r\nthey could, or to find ignominious relief in the ammunition carts.\r\nShortly after mid-day, however, a welcome well of water was reached.\r\nHere, thought the parched and foot-sore men, was relief at last. But\r\nonce again they were doomed to disappointment. It is one of French's\r\ncharacteristics that he practises an exquisitely perfect loyalty both\r\nto the army and to his superiors. That well of sparkling water was\r\ndestined for the infantry tramping on behind. Reluctantly the troopers\r\nturned aside on their tedious way. Not a drop of the water was\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nBy this time the men's sufferings from thirst and dust were intense.\r\nAt two o'clock they neared Klip Drift, where they were fiercely\r\nattacked by a large body of Boers. The guns of the first brigade,\r\nhowever, quickly put the enemy to flight, but the General thought it\r\nwell to make certain alterations in the order of his advance. These\r\nchanges were only accomplished with the greatest difficulty. So tired\r\nwere the horses that even the General's gallopers, who were\r\ncontinually traversing the column's half-mile front, were often unable\r\nto spur their horses to anything better than a walk. Very quickly the\r\nenemy returned to the attack, pestering French on the right. Realising\r\nhis peril, he changed his course suddenly and headed away from the\r\nKlip Kraal Drift. Naturally, the enemy rushed off to block his way.\r\nFor an hour and a half the Drift appeared to be the division's urgent\r\nobjective. Then, without warning, he as suddenly turned about and\r\nswung back to Klip Drift.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE BOERS FLEE]\r\n\r\nThese manoeuvres had reduced the horses almost to the last stage of\r\nexhaustion. Many of them fell dead by the way. But at last the river\r\nwas reached. Still the actual crossing was not yet. Once again French\r\nshowed his extraordinary mastery of finesse. He ordered preparation to\r\nbe made for the actual crossing at Klip Drift and Rondeval Drift.\r\nHaving thrown Gordon to the left to effect one crossing and Broadwood\r\nto the right to effect another, French advanced so rapidly that Cronje\r\nwas utterly nonplussed. Gordon opened a heavy shell fire which\r\ncompletely disconcerted him, although only a very few of the guns\r\ncould come into action. Soon afterwards Gordon was crossing the river\r\nin pursuit. The Boers fled, in spite of the natural strength of their\r\npositions and the utterly exhausted state of our men. But neither\r\nGordon on the left, nor Broadwood on the right, was satisfied with\r\nmerely effecting a crossing. Both went in pursuit of the enemy towards\r\nKimberley. The result was a complete rout. The Boers' camp, their\r\nammunition, their wagons, fell entirely into our hands.\r\n\r\nThe rout was not without spasmodic touches of humour, even for these\r\njaded men. \"One of the Staff plunged into the river and caught some\r\ngeese, but someone else ate them; a pig ran the gauntlet through the\r\ncamp--amidst roars of laughter, even from the serious General--of\r\nlances, bayonets, knives, sticks, boots, water-bottles, anything to\r\nhand, and at length was caught by a lucky trooper, who shared his\r\nfeast that night with his friends. A wagon of fresh fruit was taken,\r\nsufficient to make thirsty men's mouths water, but some thought the\r\ngrapes were sour.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe next day was perforce spent in camp, resting the tired troops and\r\nawaiting the arrival of supplies. The baggage was not on the scene\r\nuntil late in the afternoon, much to the discomfort of French's men.\r\nIt was midnight before Lord Kitchener and his Staff were near the\r\ncamp. One of French's aides-de-camp, Captain J. Laycock, rode out in\r\nsolitary peril, and although continually sniped at by the Boers, was\r\nable to lead Lord Kitchener and his Staff safely into camp. All day\r\nthe Boers had been making the men's lives a burden through unexpected\r\nsniping and feints. French is said to have admitted that had any of\r\ntheir attacks been driven home, his plans might have been seriously\r\ndisconcerted. \"Could the Boers learn to attack they would be a most\r\nformidable foe,\" was his verdict on the situation.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE ROAD BLOCKED]\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 on February 15 the column set out on the last stage of their\r\njourney. French, with the idea of putting the enemy off the track, led\r\nhis men towards Bloemfontein. His idea was eventually to dash straight\r\nfor Kimberley with his whole division, hemming the enemy's rear and\r\nflank in at Magersfontein, where Methuen's force could hold him in\r\nfront. Scarcely had the advance begun, however, when a murderous fire\r\nbroke out from the river on the south-west, followed almost\r\ninstantaneously by a cross fire from a line of kopjes on the\r\nnorth-west. The road to Bloemfontein was blocked; and the road to\r\nKimberley was exposed to a cross fire from the enemy's two positions.\r\nThis was checkmate with a vengeance. It was thought that some two\r\nthousand Boers held the kopjes ahead of French. At once he ordered the\r\nguns into position and boldly replied to the enemy's fire. The column\r\nwas now nearing a plain several miles in width, guarded on one side by\r\na ridge running from north to south, and on the other by a hill. The\r\nBoers held both hill and ridge in force. So that whatever the guns\r\nmight do, the position was difficult--if not impossible. By all\r\nmilitary rules French was \"hemmed in.\" To a lesser man retreat would\r\nhave seemed inevitable, though disastrous. Once again it was French\r\n_v._ The Impossible. A member of his staff relates how, sweeping the\r\nhorizon with his glass, while riderless horses from the guns galloped\r\npast, he muttered, squaring the pugnacious jaw, \"They are over here to\r\nstop us from Bloemfontein and they are there to stop us from\r\nKimberley--we have got to break through.\" In an instant his decision\r\nwas taken. He would attempt the impossible--a direct cavalry charge in\r\nthe teeth of the enemy's fire.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A TERRIFIC CHARGE]\r\n\r\nHe immediately ordered Gordon to charge the right front. The members\r\nof his Staff expected that the General would now take up a position of\r\nsecurity in the rear of the column, before the grim work began. But he\r\nkept his place in the van with his Staff. His officers were\r\npractically certain that not only the first, but several of the\r\nleading squadrons would be utterly wiped out. There appeared to be\r\nnothing in heaven or earth which could prevent huge losses. Gordon led\r\nhis men--the Ninth and Sixteenth Lancers--in superb style. Despite the\r\npitiable condition of the horses, it was a charge worthy of the\r\nBritish Army. A strong fire poured in from the Boer trenches and from\r\nthe kopjes above. But as the huge masses of armed men gained the\r\ninevitable momentum and pounded down upon the enemy in a cloud of\r\nsword-lit dust, the Boers fled before these clattering hoofs. Throwing\r\nup their guns they begged for mercy. But nothing could stop the\r\nterrific impetus of the charge. Nearly one hundred and fifty Boers\r\nfell as the Lancers ploughed through their trenches. Behind the\r\nLancers the whole division now swept on in perfect order, led by the\r\nGreys. \"So the whole division swung up the plain at the gallop. It was\r\na thrilling time never to be forgotten,\" wrote Boyle. So wild was the\r\nBoer fire that our casualties only amounted to four men wounded and\r\ntwo horses wounded.\r\n\r\nThe plain once cleared, a halt was made for the guns to come up, to\r\nhold the enemy on the left. When the Artillery had joined the main\r\nforce, the advance was again begun. The plain once crossed, the smoke\r\nstacks of Kimberley came into view. At sight of these dingy symbols of\r\nthe commerce they had risked all to save, the men raised a tired\r\ncheer. Kimberley was relieved--although the nervous operators to whom\r\nFrench attempted to heliograph the fact, persisted in pessimistically\r\nbelieving that he was the enemy.\r\n\r\nBy far the worst of the work was now over. Before French reached\r\nKimberley, however, the Boers made a last effort to stay his\r\nvictorious advance. But they were driven back with heavy loss. Only\r\nthe frightful condition of his horses prevented French from turning\r\nrout into annihilation. But his worn-out animals were quite beyond\r\npursuing even a beaten enemy.\r\n\r\nAt length, Kimberley, seeing the huge sand cloud on the horizon, came\r\nto the conclusion that it enveloped the horsemen, not of Cronje but of\r\nFrench. About six o'clock in the evening an officer rode out of the\r\nbesieged city to meet the soldier who had saved it. At 7--just one\r\nhour after the moment of French's historic promise, the General\r\nentered Kimberley with his Staff. He dined that night at De Beer's\r\nSanatorium.\r\n\r\nBut there was no rest for the conquerors. At 3.30 on the following\r\nmorning the cavalry was harrying the Boers to the north-east. At 5\r\no'clock they came upon a body of Boers on a well-fortified ridge, who\r\nwere covering the army's retreat. Unable to operate vigorously against\r\nthem owing to the condition of his forces, French forced them to draw\r\nin their outposts. But it was impossible to do more. His horses were\r\nhalf dead. And in the terrific heat \"the tongues of men and horses\r\nbecome black from thirst.\" Realising the hopelessness of the\r\nsituation, French returned to the town.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A MAGNIFICENT RESPONSE]\r\n\r\nRest was not yet, however. Scarcely had he retired than news came that\r\nCronje had decided to evacuate Magersfontein. No confirmation\r\nfollowed, however. The General, therefore, advised his Staff that at\r\nlast a night's rest was possible. A couple of hours later a telegram\r\narrived from Lord Kitchener, announcing that Cronje, with ten thousand\r\nmen, was in full retreat from Magersfontein, with \"all his wagons and\r\nequipment and four guns, along the north bank of the Modder River\r\ntowards Bloemfontein, that he had already fought a rearguard action\r\nwith him, and if French with all available horses and guns could head\r\nhim and prevent his crossing the river, the infantry from Klip Drift\r\nwould press on and annihilate or take the whole force prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral French responded magnificently to the call of this\r\nopportunity. Another man might have pleaded that his troops and horses\r\nwere utterly unfit for work, but with French the greater the\r\nobstacles, the stronger is his determination to win through! Of all\r\nhis five thousand men, only two thousand could be found whose horses\r\nwere fit to carry them in that wild dash to head off the Boer\r\nCommando.\r\n\r\nAt 3 a.m. on February 17, French left Kimberley, and by a marvellous\r\npiece of far-sighted calculation made straight for Koodoos Rand Drift,\r\nthe very crossing which Cronje himself had chosen. His horses died on\r\nthe way, but French reached the river first and seized the Drift,\r\nalmost under the enemy's eyes.\r\n\r\nCronje was completely surprised. The previous evening, French had been\r\nin pursuit of the Boers north of Kimberley; now he had suddenly\r\nappeared 35 miles to the south, and was facing the enemy, determined\r\nto cut off his retreat. Swiftly Cronje moved down the river and took\r\npossession of a long stretch between Gaardeberg Drift and Wolveskraal\r\nDrift.\r\n\r\nIt must have been an anxious night for General French, for had Cronje\r\nrealised how small was the force that thus held him at bay, and made a\r\ndesperate effort to break through, there would have been little chance\r\nof thwarting him. But Cronje lay still in the river bed, while the\r\nBritish forces closed swiftly in and the net was drawn closer round\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: CRONJE SURRENDERS]\r\n\r\nFor ten long days the Boer General held out, while the British\r\nartillery poured shells into his laager. Meanwhile the Boers flocked\r\nin from every side to endeavour to rescue Cronje from his hopeless\r\nposition. French undertook to check them and hold them back, leaving\r\nthe main army to deal with the surrounded enemy.\r\n\r\nGeneral French and his men were in continual action for the next few\r\ndays. But the soldiers gloried in their work, for they were cheered by\r\nthe message from Queen Victoria in appreciation of their excellent\r\nwork, particularly in the relief of Kimberley, which had earned for\r\nthem \"the gratitude of the whole nation.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, on February 27, Cronje surrendered, and four thousand men\r\nlaid down their arms. Thus closed the most brilliant exploit of the\r\nBritish Arms in South Africa--an exploit whose success can be largely\r\ntraced to the extraordinary mixture of dauntless courage, practical\r\nacumen and remorseless persistence which mark the genius of Sir John\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] _The Cavalry Rush to Kimberley._ By Captain Cecil Boyle,\r\n_Nineteenth Century_, June, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nROUNDING UP THE BOERS\r\n\r\n    French in the Modder--At Bloemfontein--French and the\r\n    Artist--An Ambush--Doing the Impossible Again--Short Shrift\r\n    with Barberton Snipers--Some French Stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have relieved Kimberley and partially effected the capture of the\r\nredoubtable Cronje in the course of a fortnight, was no mean\r\naccomplishment. The average commander would have been content to rest\r\nhis forces after such exertions. But French is never tired. The very\r\nday that Cronje surrendered news came through that a rescue party was\r\ncoming to Cronje's assistance, and already held a hill on the\r\nsouth-east of the Modder. Although the river was in flood, as the\r\nresult of torrential rains, French forthwith led out two brigades with\r\ntheir batteries to make a reconnaissance. In forcing the stream both\r\nFrench and his A.A.G. very nearly lost their lives. Losing its\r\nfoothold the General's horse took fright and fell, flinging him into\r\nthe raging torrent. As the animal strove to recover, it upset Colonel\r\n(now Sir Douglas) Haig, who was coming to the rescue, dashing rider\r\nand horse into an over-hanging willow tree. Both French and Haig\r\nluckily managed to get themselves free from their plunging animals and\r\nstruck out for the shore. Dripping but determined, they jumped on to\r\nfresh mounts, and advanced in two steamy haloes across the dusty\r\nveldt. Of course, not a solitary Boer was in sight for ten miles at\r\nleast!\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: AT POPLAR GROVE]\r\n\r\nIt very quickly transpired, however, that the Boers were strongly\r\nentrenched at Poplar Grove. At their head were French's most\r\nredoubtable opponents in the Colesberg campaign--De Wet and Delarey.\r\nFor once his old antagonists were able to get back at least a little\r\nof their own. Their position extended across the river and was\r\nprotected by a chain of hills, with kopjes between, not to mention the\r\nwired fences, ditches and other wiles in which they excelled.\r\n\r\nLord Roberts determined that an attack must be delivered before the\r\nenemy had time to recover from the shock of Cronje's surrender. French\r\nwas, therefore, ordered to circle round the Boer left flank, thus\r\ncutting off his retreat, while the infantry delivered a frontal\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe result was a compliment to the terrible French and his cavalry.\r\nNo sooner did the Boers realise that the horsemen were upon them, than\r\nthey beat a hasty retreat. Before the cavalry were in position, the\r\nBoers and their wagons could be seen scurrying off for the river.\r\nArm-chair critics at home have strongly criticised French for what\r\nfollowed. They claim that what should have been a rout, ended in an\r\norderly escape. But they forget several factors in the situation.\r\n\r\nWhile French's men were urging their spent horses forward to overtake\r\nthe enemy, it became obvious that De Wet had very cleverly covered his\r\nretreat. First from a farmhouse in the rear, and, when it was taken,\r\nfrom a low kopje, a small body of men poured forth a hail of bullets.\r\nIn manoeuvring to take the kopje, the tired cavalry allowed the astute\r\nDe Wet and Delarey to escape with their guns intact. Kruger and Steyn\r\nalso, who had come up to hearten their followers, got away.\r\n\r\nMaddening as it was to French to see his old enemy escape through his\r\nfingers like this, the condition of his men and of his horses had to\r\nbe taken into account; they were dead beat. For once the manoeuvring\r\nof De Wet proved as successful as when it was practised by French at\r\nColesberg. Finally the event of the day is attributable to two of\r\nFrench's best qualities--his caution and his extreme parsimony in the\r\nmatter of human life. A more ruthless leader might possibly have\r\ncaptured the Boer guns. But it is extremely doubtful whether he would\r\nhave taken De Wet, Delarey or any other of the well-mounted Boer\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nFrom Poplar Grove the enemy fell back on Driefontein. On March 10,\r\nFrench again drove them, although not without real difficulty, from\r\ntheir stronghold. This accomplished, the army pushed on towards\r\nBloemfontein, which surrendered on March 13. For six weeks the main\r\nbody halted there to rest, but chiefly to obtain remounts for the\r\ncavalry. During that time, however, French's men were not idle. They\r\ncontinually patrolled the surrounding country, keeping in constant\r\ntouch with the enemy and driving him back for many miles from the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A PAINFUL SITTING]\r\n\r\nOne unhappy afternoon the General spent in sitting for a painter in\r\nBloemfontein. It was probably the severest ordeal of the campaign for\r\nthat retiring soldier. \"General French,\" wrote the painter's youngest\r\ndaughter, \"is quite the shyest man in the British army, and looks less\r\nlike a cavalry officer than you could possibly imagine. He is a heavy\r\nman, always looks half-asleep--although who is there more wide\r\nawake?--has a very red complexion, grey moustache, thick-set figure,\r\nand the last personality in the world to help an artist as a sitter.\r\nHe promised to sit for the painter, although most characteristically\r\nhe could not for the life of him think what he had done to be of\r\nsufficient interest for anyone to want to sketch him. At last, after a\r\ngreat deal of trouble, the painter got him to sit one morning just\r\noutside the club at Bloemfontein. That sitting was the shortest and\r\nmost disjointed the painter has ever had. The General sat bolt upright\r\nin a chair, reading his paper upside down through sheer nervousness,\r\nand, if he left that chair once, on one excuse or another, he left it\r\na hundred times, coming back looking more thoroughly upset and nervous\r\neach time, until at last he never came back at all. And the painter's\r\nonly chance of sketching him was at the club during dinner!\"[13]\r\n\r\nAt last the main army was ready for work again, and on May 1 the\r\ntroops moved out of the fever-stricken town. French and his cavalry\r\nwere the last to leave, but they overtook Lord Roberts and the main\r\nbody, and led the way to Kroonstad, once again the seat of the Free\r\nState Government. Here by one of his famous turning movements, French\r\ncleverly forced the enemy to surrender and give up the keys of the\r\ntown. Keeping ahead of Lord Roberts and his forces, he crossed the\r\nVaal River and was first at the gates of Johannesburg, which the\r\nBritish entered on May 31.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE GUNS]\r\n\r\nAfter two days in the mining city, Lord Roberts' triumphant forces\r\nmoved on their way to Pretoria. French's next task was to cut the\r\nrailway communications to the north of Pretoria. In carrying this out\r\nhe made a wide detour to the west, where his cavalry found themselves\r\nin a treacherous country of kopjes, scrub and menacing gorges, a type\r\nof country most dangerous to mounted men. Anxiously he pushed forward\r\nto reach open country before nightfall (of June 2). But the Boers were\r\nbefore him. A sudden hail of Mauser bullets and shells announced an\r\nambush. But French was undismayed. \"Quietly, in complete mastery of\r\nthe situation, General French gave his orders. 'Make room for the\r\nguns,' passed down the line; and like a fire engine to the rescue, up\r\ndashed a section of horse artillery and a pom-pom.\"[14] Very quickly\r\nthe enemy was beaten off, in spite of the fatigue of a thirty-two\r\nmile march. No further resistance was met with as the men passed\r\nthrough the rich, orange-growing country round Pretoria. On June 4,\r\nFrench had completed his enveloping movement, and taken up his\r\nposition to the north of the town. In the afternoon the cavalrymen\r\nlearnt, with no little chagrin, that Lord Roberts had already entered\r\nPretoria.\r\n\r\nWhen the efforts to negotiate peace with Botha had failed, French was\r\ninstructed by Lord Roberts to push the Boers east by a turning\r\nmovement on their flank, which he would follow by the usual frontal\r\nattack on foot. So energetic were the Boers in harassing Lord Roberts'\r\nforce, that drastic action had become necessary. It proved to be one\r\nof the most difficult enterprises that the cavalry had undertaken.\r\n\r\nAs usually happened the Boers were securely ensconced on ridges, the\r\nchief of which was known as Diamond Hill, while our men were condemned\r\nto work round from a level plain open to the enemy's fire. In order\r\nnot to become a series of conspicuous targets, the cavalrymen were\r\nforced to dismount and fight their way up to the ridges on foot. For\r\ntwo days they fought gallantly against a steady fire, until the\r\ninfantry's attack on the enemy's other flank gave French his chance\r\nto drive them out. For a third time the plight of his horses finally\r\nforbade his taking full advantage of his success. The Boers were\r\ndriven back, but without being severely punished. The ubiquitous De\r\nWet, need one add, showed a clean pair of heels.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A DARING VENTURE]\r\n\r\nIn July, French was in command of the forces operating in Eastern\r\nTransvaal. There followed a long and arduous march towards the east\r\nwhich, after the capture of Middleburg, ended in the surrender of\r\nBarberton. It was in the beginning of September that French turned his\r\nattention to the enemy's forces collected round the latter town. He\r\ncommenced his operations by circulating reports of an intended action\r\nin the opposite direction. While the Boers prepared to meet this he\r\nwas able to reach Carolina with comparative ease. Here he remained for\r\nthree days in order to prepare for a flanking movement against\r\nBarberton. As he must cut himself off entirely from sources of supply,\r\nsuch preparation was very necessary. French was about to attempt one\r\nof the most daring achievements of his career. He was going to take\r\nmounted men over a miniature Alps. The Boers were prepared for his\r\nattacking Barberton from every direction save one. They never supposed\r\nfor a moment that the British troops would attempt to force the\r\nNelshoogte Pass. For what did it mean? The scaling of precipitous\r\nheights, and the passage along narrow ledges of men, horses and guns.\r\nIt would have been a difficult task for mountaineers, far less for\r\nheavily burdened cavalrymen.\r\n\r\nFrench, however, was determined to do the impossible \"once more.\" He\r\nwould repeat the miracle of Coles Kop on a titanic scale. Accordingly,\r\nafter a day's hard fighting, he rested his men for a night near the\r\nentrance to the pass. On the following morning, the enemy having\r\ndisappeared, the advance was sounded. Up a narrow path, whose gradient\r\nwas frequently one in four, the men crawled, often on hands and knees,\r\nwhile their horses stumbled on behind. Frequently they were scaling\r\ntowering crags several hundred feet in height, from which there was\r\nsometimes a sheer fall of over a thousand feet. In teams of sixteen\r\nthe oxen panted, struggled and frequently perished in the attempt to\r\ndrag the heavy guns up the fearful incline. Only a man of indomitable\r\ncourage would have attempted such a feat. But French lost not a single\r\nman in the process. Perhaps the division's perfect belief in his luck\r\ndid something towards nerving the men for the ordeal.\r\n\r\nThe top of the pass once reached, French determined to make a sudden\r\ndescent on Barberton. Taking a leaf out of the Boers' book, he left\r\nthe whole of his baggage behind to lighten the horses, and rushed his\r\nmen towards the town. On descending the other side of the pass the\r\nsoldiers had still to lead their horses, who were as often on their\r\nhaunches as their feet. Barberton and the Boers saw the oncoming of\r\nthe British force with blank amazement. It was the last thing in the\r\nworld they expected. The Boer Commando in possession, six hundred\r\nstrong, had just time to escape from one end of the town as French\r\nentered it at the other.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A WAY WITH SNIPERS]\r\n\r\nEnraged at the surprise that had been sprung on them, the Boers\r\ncommenced sniping the town from various vantage points in the\r\nvicinity. But French knew how to treat the sniper. The following\r\nnotice was immediately dashed off by the local printing press and\r\nposted all over the town.\r\n\r\n  TO THE INHABITANTS OF BARBERTON.\r\n\r\n  This is to give notice that if any Shooting into the Town or\r\n  Sniping in its vicinity takes place, the Lieutenant-General\r\n  Commanding will withdraw the Troops, and shell the Town without\r\n  further notice.\r\n\r\n        By order,\r\n\r\n          D. HAIG, Lt.-Col.\r\n    Chief Staff Officer to Lt.-General French.\r\n\r\n  _September 15, 1900._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sniping stopped forthwith.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that French did was to go and personally\r\nrescue his old enemy, Schoeman, from the local jail. That worthy,\r\nhaving surrendered, had come into bad odour with his fellow\r\ncountrymen. In consequence he had been incarcerated at Barberton. For\r\nonce the unfortunate Schoeman was glad to see the face of his old\r\nenemy again!\r\n\r\nFrench rested his forces in Barberton for three weeks, leaving the\r\ntown on October 3. The march back to Pretoria was, if anything, more\r\ntrying than the adventurous dash to Barberton had been. Apart from the\r\ntrying climb over the heights of the Kaapsche Hoop, and the eternal\r\nsniping of the Boers, the weather now brought new sufferings. The men\r\nwere exhausted by days of heat, and soaked by nights of torrential\r\nrain. It was a thoroughly tired and jaded force which finally reached\r\nPretoria on November 3.\r\n\r\nOne incident of that trying march shows how ably French dealt with\r\nBoer bluff. The enemy had made prisoner a captain of the R.A.M.C, and\r\nsent a message that they would shoot him unless General French pledged\r\nhis word that he would burn no Boer farms. French replied that unless\r\nthe captured medical officer were brought into the British camp next\r\nmorning, he would burn the town of Bethel to the ground; and, if he\r\nwere shot, ten Boer prisoners would be similarly put to death. The\r\ndoctor was brought into camp next morning.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: LORD ROBERTS' RETURN]\r\n\r\nIn inspecting the cavalry on their return, Lord Roberts expressed his\r\nhigh appreciation of French's work and informed him that, while\r\nretaining his cavalry command, he had been appointed to the command of\r\nJohannesburg and district.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the month Lord Roberts returned to England to take\r\ncommand of the Home Forces; and several months elapsed before French\r\nwas able actively to take up that long rounding-up of the Boers which\r\nKitchener was now planning in such elaborate detail. During the early\r\npart of 1901 he was able to clear the Boers out of the central\r\ndistrict of Cape Colony. On June 8 he took supreme command of the\r\noperations in that Colony, and by November he had confined the enemy\r\nto its north-eastern and south-western extremities.\r\n\r\nNot until Midsummer, 1902, was French able to return home. Before that\r\nhe had spent some time recruiting his health in Cape Town. Very eager\r\nwere the loyal citizens to fête the most successful of all the British\r\nGenerals. But French would have no banqueting on his account. The war,\r\nhe characteristically explained, was not yet ended, and so long as it\r\nwas in progress he was not inclined to accept any public hospitality.\r\n\r\nAnything like show or ostentation is foreign to French's whole nature.\r\nIf there are few stories of his exploits in South Africa, there lies\r\nthe reason. He is far too modest a man to prepare _bons mots_ or\r\npretty _jeux d'esprit_ for public consumption. Also he is by nature a\r\nsilent man. His silence is not the detached, Olympian and rather\r\nominous silence of Kitchener. It proceeds simply from a natural\r\nmodesty and reticence, which reinforce his habitual tendency to \"think\r\nthings over.\" He is the type of man whom hostesses have to \"draw out\";\r\nhe never talks either on himself, the army or any other subject. To\r\n\"do his job\" better than anybody else in the world could do it is\r\nenough for French; chatter about it he leaves to less busy people.\r\n\r\nHis habitual taciturnity, curiously enough, is one of the traits which\r\nendears him to the army. For French's silence has no trait of\r\nchurlishness. It is the silence of a man utterly absorbed in the task\r\nbefore him, the man whom Tommy Atkins admires. \"If the British soldier\r\nlikes one thing in a General more than another,\" wrote a soldier who\r\nserved with French in South Africa, \"it is the golden gift of silence,\r\nespecially when joined to straight action, just to distinguish him\r\nfrom the old women of both sexes. Whenever French penned a dispatch,\r\nor an order, or a proclamation, he wasted no ink and strained no pen\r\nnibs; but he never penned anything if there was a way of doing the\r\nthing himself.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A SHIRT-SLEEVED GENERAL]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa he earned the title of \"the shirt-sleeved General,\"--a\r\nsoubriquet that conveys a subtle compliment from Tommy's point of\r\nview. Actually French was often to be seen walking about in camp\r\nduring his heavy marches in shirt-sleeves. One afternoon a\r\ncorrespondent rode up to the lines, and seeing a soldier sitting on a\r\nbundle of hay, smoking a dilapidated looking old briar pipe, asked\r\nwhere the General was. \"The old man is somewhere about,\" coolly\r\nreplied the soldier. \"Well, just hold my horse while I go and search\r\nfor him.\" \"Certainly, sir,\" and the smoker rose obediently and took\r\nthe bridle. \"Can you tell me where the General is?\" inquired the\r\ncorrespondent of a staff officer further down the line. \"General\r\nFrench? oh, he's somewhere about. Why, there he is, holding that\r\nhorse's head!\" And the officer pointed directly to the smoker, still\r\ntranquilly pulling at his pipe, and holding the horse! Needless to say\r\n\"Uncle French\" and his men hugely enjoyed the correspondent's\r\nawakening.\r\n\r\nSuch a man is bound to be the idol of the ranks. \"What a good leader\r\nGeneral French is,\" wrote Driver Payne, of the Royal Horse Artillery,\r\nto a friend. \"He seems so cool at excitable moments; he does not lose\r\nhis head and rush his men into danger. In fact, he always looks before\r\nhe leaps, and when he does leap, he makes us move--and the Boers too.\"\r\nPerhaps French was best summed-up one day by a trooper whom, in a curt\r\nword, he had just sentenced to barracks for some offence. \"The General\r\ndon't bark much,\" he remarked, \"but, crikey, don't he know how to\r\nbite!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] _M.A.P._, August 25, 1900.\r\n\r\n[14] _With General French and his Cavalry in South Africa._ By C.S.\r\nGoldman.

Macmillan & Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\n[15] _The Regiment_, September 5, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWORK AT HOME AND RESIGNATION\r\n\r\n    At Aldershot--Driving Training at High Pressure--General\r\n    French is \"fairly\" well pleased--Strenuous Manoeuvres--Chief\r\n    of the Imperial General Staff--Ulster and Resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Lord Kitchener, General French had a wonderful welcome on his\r\nreturn from South Africa. The former had certainly added a few leaves\r\nto his laurel wreath, but French brought back a complete new crown of\r\nhis own. His return home in July was a triumphal progress. At\r\nSouthampton, in replying to congratulations, he paid a fine tribute to\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\nFrench's hatred of ostentation in any form prevented him from allowing\r\nSociety to fête him to its heart's content. He was the most retiring\r\nof lions; and, like Kitchener, he allowed London to idolise him only\r\nat a distance. A knighthood was one reward of his services; and after\r\na brief rest he was back at Aldershot as Lieutenant-General in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nFor the first time French found himself in command of all arms of the\r\nservice in time of peace. After his arrival, instruction was driven at\r\nhigh pressure. No sooner had he arrived than he turned out the whole\r\nof his command--\"just to see how they looked!\" Such a thing had\r\nscarcely ever happened before; and the order sent desolation to the\r\nhearts of some of the officers. For it meant that the whole force,\r\nevery man, horse and gun had to turn out forthwith, in full marching\r\norder, and ready for action. After the first feverish digging out of\r\naccoutrements and tents, however, the men became hardened to these\r\nsudden alarums and excursions. They became a part of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry especially was trained to an extraordinary degree of\r\nperfection. The most rigorous methods in use abroad were used and\r\nbettered. The result was the production of a body of men who, like\r\nWellington's heroes of Torres Vedras, \"were ready to go anywhere and\r\ndo anything.\"\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: \"FAIRLY\" WELL PLEASED]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1907, French was appointed Inspector-General of the\r\nForces. In this extremely exacting office, his qualities of\r\nthoroughness and grip had splendid scope. A glance at his comments\r\ndiscloses the high standard of excellence which he exacted from every\r\nbranch of the service. Only the other day timid folk were bewailing\r\nhis methods at manoeuvres. Four horses had succumbed to a gruelling\r\nday of fierce exertion. But French expressed himself as \"well\r\npleased.\" One does not remember his ever going farther up the giddy\r\nincline of the superlatives. Probably his exacting eye never yet met\r\nthe corps of his dream. He had a terrible word with which he was wont\r\nto emphasise the fact of disenchantment. How often did one read\r\n\"General French expressed himself as 'fairly' well pleased with what\r\nhe saw\"? A withering qualitative. French was determined to infuse the\r\nwhole army with his own professional love of efficiency. To that end\r\nhe phrased his judgments with extraordinary care. His remarks were as\r\nnicely aimed and as carefully timed as his cavalry charges. Nor did\r\nthey lack shattering force on occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter five years of \"tuning up\" the army, French took command of its\r\nadministration. In 1912 he was appointed Chief of the Imperial General\r\nStaff, a body formed on the lines of the efficient German General\r\nStaff. Of the nature and value of the reforms instituted under his\r\ndirection it is too early yet to speak. Suffice it to say that in the\r\nEuropean War they have met the almost intolerable strain with signal\r\nsuccess. For once we presented to the Continent the unparalleled\r\nspectacle of a War Office \"ready for action.\"\r\n\r\nIn particular Sir John French encouraged originality of thought among\r\nhis officers by frankly seeking critical contributions for a new\r\nservice journal, and by putting various opportunities for individual\r\nenterprise in their way.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these invaluable if slightly uncongenial\r\nadministrative activities, Sir John French was brought to a tragic\r\nstandstill. A political intrigue cut across his soldier's life, and\r\nended its usefulness for the time being. At this early date it is\r\nextremely difficult to disentangle the rights and wrongs of the Gough\r\nincident. But there is no need to enter into the political aspect of\r\nthe case here. Suffice it to deplore the sticky mess of party politics\r\nwhich threatened to gulf a great career.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE ULSTER CRISIS]\r\n\r\nIn the month of March the Government believed that they had serious\r\nreason to expect disturbance in Ireland. Accordingly, General Sir\r\nArthur Paget was summoned to the War Office to consult his military\r\nchiefs. Apparently, General Paget was instructed--so far as can be\r\ngathered in the absence of documentary evidence--to lay before his\r\nofficers a certain choice of action. He accordingly called a meeting\r\nof his officers, whom he informed that \"Active operations were to be\r\nbegun against Ulster; that he expected the country to be in a blaze by\r\nSaturday (March 21); and that he was instructed by the War Office to\r\nallow officers domiciled in Ulster to disappear, but as regards others\r\nthat any who resigned would be dismissed.\" The officers were given two\r\nhours to make their decision. Out of a total of 72 officers in the\r\nBrigade, 59 \"would, respectfully, and under protest,\" prefer to be\r\ndismissed, while five claimed exemption on the ground of being\r\ndomiciled in Ulster.\r\n\r\nA few days later it was explained on behalf of the Government that no\r\noperations were intended against Ulster, and that through \"an honest\r\nmisunderstanding\" General Paget had misinterpreted his instructions.\r\nBrigadier-General Gough was therefore asked to return to his command,\r\nfinally obtaining a written undertaking, signed by the Secretary of\r\nState for War, that the troops would not be used in Ulster. In\r\naddition to Colonel Seely's signature, that of the Chief of the\r\nImperial General Staff (Sir John French) and of the Adjutant-General\r\n(Sir J.S. Ewart) appeared on the memorandum.\r\n\r\nNow it transpired that two important paragraphs of the memorandum were\r\nwritten by Colonel Seely, but presumably they were not sanctioned by\r\nthe Cabinet. The paragraphs in question ran: \"His Majesty's Government\r\nmust retain their right to use all the forces of the Crown in Ireland,\r\nor elsewhere, to maintain law and order, and to support the Civil\r\nPower in the ordinary execution of its duty.\r\n\r\n\"But they had no intention whatever of taking advantage of this right\r\nto crush political opposition to the policy or principles of the Home\r\nRule Bill.\"\r\n\r\nAs they stand these two paragraphs are a trifle ambiguous. The fact\r\napparently occurred to General Gough. For he asked Sir John French\r\nexplicitly whether they could be taken to mean that he could not be\r\ncalled upon to order his brigade to take part in the coercion of\r\nUlster to the Home Rule Bill. Sir John French wrote across the note\r\nthat this was his belief. On the strength of this General Gough\r\nreturned to his command.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A QUESTION OF HONOUR]\r\n\r\nWhen the facts of the case were known, the Government were severely\r\ncriticised by the Labour and the Nationalist parties. In replying to\r\nthese criticisms, on Wednesday, this pledge was declared to be \"not\r\noperative.\" As the result, Colonel Seely, who had signed the\r\nassurance, threatened resignation. On Friday, March 26, it was known\r\nthat both Sir John French and Sir J.S. Ewart had resigned their\r\npositions. Every effort was made to induce these distinguished\r\nofficers to reconsider their decision, but without avail. To remain in\r\noffice would mean repudiating their pledged word. To this course no\r\npossible pressure could induce Sir John French to agree. He persisted\r\nin his resignation: and the Prime Minister solved a very dangerous\r\nsituation by himself taking up the office of Minister of War, which\r\nColonel Seely had now resigned.\r\n\r\nSo Sir John French went for a second time into retirement. Nothing\r\nless could be expected of one whose views on discipline are so\r\nextremely strict and whose ideals of loyalty are notoriously so high.\r\nTo have remained in office would have been to impair the authority of\r\nthe Imperial General Staff, quite apart from failing in loyalty to a\r\npledged word. For all these reasons Sir John French chose eclipse\r\nrather than dishonour.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably he viewed the _impasse_ purely from the military point\r\nof view. His dislike of anything like politics in the army is well\r\nknown. Mr. Asquith's famous dictum on taking up the office of\r\nSecretary for War is an echo of General French's invariable advice to\r\nhis officers--\"You will hear no politics from me, and I expect to\r\nhear none from you.\"\r\n\r\nWhat his attitude towards the officers at the Curragh was in the first\r\ninstance, is a matter of mere surmise. It has been said that he would\r\npersonally have dealt very sharply with those concerned. But such\r\nstatements obviously lack authority. Sir John French is much too\r\ndiscreet an officer to babble his views abroad on such a point. All we\r\nknow is that at the time he strongly deprecated politics in the army\r\nin several speeches of considerable force. A psychological problem in\r\narmy feeling was closely bound up with the issue. It is enough to\r\nemphasise the fact that Sir John French is himself no politician and\r\ndid what he did because his honour demanded nothing less.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A HOLIDAY]\r\n\r\nFor four months the most energetic man in the Army was able to\r\nrusticate. Actually nothing ever fell out more happily than this\r\nenforced holiday. His duties during the past few years had necessarily\r\nbeen extremely exhausting. He had rarely had time for the rest and\r\nrelaxation that make for physical and mental freshness. Now he gave\r\nhimself to the walking, the riding and the yachting he so keenly\r\nenjoys, and so rarely indulges in. For the General has, at least,\r\ntaken the love of the water from his otherwise tedious days in the\r\nNavy. He is an expert yachtsman and has explored a large part of the\r\nBritish coast at one time or another. Riding and hunting are, however,\r\nthe only sports he now takes very seriously. He rides a great deal\r\nduring his busiest days at home, running down from London to the Manor\r\nat Waltham Cross for the purpose when occasion permits.\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning of August, Sir John French was able to revel in\r\nhis new found freedom. When the call came, it found him feeling better\r\nand fitter than he had done for years. Perhaps even political intrigue\r\nserves a purpose in the game of the War Gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHIS BELIEF IN CAVALRY\r\n\r\n    The Lessons of the Boer War--Cavalry _v._ Mounted Infantry--A\r\n    Plea for the Lance--The Cavalry Spirit--Shock Tactics still\r\n    Useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not necessarily follow that because a man is a great cavalry\r\nleader, he therefore has ideas on the subject of cavalry. To the\r\npopular mind cavalry suggests clouds of dust and a clatter of hoofs,\r\nthe flashing of swords, followed by the crash and sound of an\r\nengagement. The man who would conduct this imagined spectacle\r\nsatisfactorily would therefore be dependent rather on the timely\r\nuprush of the spirit than on the mechanical certainty of the mind. He\r\nwould need to act by inspiration and impulse, rather than by cold\r\nthought. Quite obviously some other and less resplendent being would\r\nhave to time the rise of his curtain in the theatre of war. He would\r\nbe the last man whom one would figure, like Kipling's successful\r\nGeneral, \"worrying himself bald\" over a map and compasses.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THEORY AND PRACTICE]\r\n\r\nBut the popular version does less than justice to the modern cavalry\r\nleader in general and to French in particular. We have seen him as a\r\nsubaltern poring over his books before his colleagues were out of bed.\r\nWe have seen him varying the monotony of War Office administration by\r\nsolving problems in tactics. Indubitably he is a student: incidentally\r\nhe is an innovator. This fact of mental duality raises him in a moment\r\nout of the ruck of mere cavalry experts--of both sorts. On the one\r\nhand he is not a competent machine working out other people's ideas in\r\nthe field of battle: on the other he is no blundering theorist whose\r\nideas crumple into ineffectual dust under the stress of actual\r\nwarfare. He can carry out with the ardour of the soldier the schemes\r\nwhich he has formulated with the cold cunning of the strategist. It is\r\ndifficult indeed to say in which field of cavalry work he more greatly\r\nexcels--that of theory or practice. We shall see later that he\r\npossesses qualities altogether apart from those of the theoriser or\r\nthe man of action. Suffice it now to glance at the astonishingly\r\ncomplete theory of cavalry on which his marvellous execution is\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nOne reaches the bedrock of French's curiously sane conception of war\r\nwhen one asks him to define war. In dealing with those gentlemen who\r\ntell us that the Boer War was fought under such abnormal conditions\r\nthat it is useless as a ground-work for conclusions as to future wars,\r\nhe uttered a memorable retort. \"All wars are abnormal,\" he observed,\r\n\"because there is no such thing as normal war.\"[16] There we have one\r\nof the axioms both of his theory and of his practice. There can be no\r\nfixed conditions, and so there can be no final theories as to the\r\nconduct of warfare. Theory is simply a means to an end. And the\r\nsuccessful general is he who most ably adapts the general body of\r\ntheory suitable for all cases to the particular campaign on which he\r\nis engaged.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A VEXED QUESTION]\r\n\r\nBroadly, however, French has very clearly defined what he considers to\r\nbe the use and the abuse of cavalry. After the Boer War, as is well\r\nknown, opinion on the subject of the future of the mounted arm was\r\nbitterly divided. There were those who saw in French's success a\r\njustification for the cavalrymen of the old school, armed _cap à pie_.\r\nThere were others who, like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, saw the end of\r\ntheir day approaching. The author of _The Great Boer War_ says of the\r\ncharge before Kimberley: \"It appears to have been one of the very few\r\noccasions during the campaign when that obsolete and absurd weapon the\r\nsword was anything but a dead weight to its bearer.\" And again: \"The\r\nwar has been a cruel one for the cavalry.... It is difficult to say\r\nthat cavalry, as cavalry, have justified their existence. In the\r\nopinion of many the tendency of the future will be to convert the\r\nwhole forces into mounted infantry.... A little training in taking\r\ncover, leggings instead of boots, and a rifle instead of a carbine,\r\nwould give us a formidable force of 20,000 men who could do all that\r\nour cavalry does, and a great deal more besides.... The lesson both of\r\nthe South African and of the American Civil War is that the light\r\nhorseman who is trained to fight on foot is the type of the\r\nfuture.\"[17] This is the opinion of a very competent civilian who\r\ndeeply studied the South African campaign. But it is the opinion of a\r\ncivilian.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand many experts, most of them military men, insist that\r\nthe day of shock tactics is far from done. They instance the charge\r\nbefore Kimberley as a case in point. Obviously all the elements of\r\ndisaster were there. Only a brilliant use of the traditional cavalry\r\nattack saved the situation--and Kimberley. Situations of that sort\r\nare bound to arise again. How is the mounted infantryman, lacking the\r\n_elan_ and spirit of the cavalryman, to meet the situation?\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: TOO MUCH CAUTION]\r\n\r\nFrench takes an attitude somewhat midway between these two extremes.\r\nHe, of all men, has developed cavalry most successfully on what might\r\nbe called mounted infantry lines. That is to say, he has taught his\r\nmen to fight on foot, to take cover at every opportunity, and to\r\nmaster the whole art of reconnaissance. But at the same time, he\r\nobjects to extremist[18] views as to the abolition of the cavalry\r\nspirit. \"One or two distinguished foreign soldiers who have publicly\r\ncommented upon that campaign have said that what is termed the\r\n'Cavalry Spirit' is opposed to the idea of dismounted action. They\r\nhold that the cavalry disdain to dismount, and they see in riding the\r\nend instead of the means. They consider that events in the Far East\r\nteach us that we must render our cavalry less devoted to 'manoeuvres'\r\nand to 'tournaments,' in order to enable them to fit themselves to\r\ntake part in modern fighting; that the times have come when the\r\nmethods of warfare should be changed; and that the cavalry must\r\ndetermine to defeat the enemy by dismounted action entirely.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot speak with any certainty as to what has happened in European\r\nArmies, but as regards the British Cavalry, I am absolutely convinced\r\nthat the Cavalry Spirit is, and may be encouraged to the utmost,\r\nwithout in the least degree prejudicing either training in dismounted\r\nduties or the acquirement of such tactical knowledge on the part of\r\nleaders as will enable them to discern when and where to resort to\r\ndismounted methods.\r\n\r\n\"How, I ask, can the Cavalry perform its rôle in war until the enemy's\r\nCavalry is defeated and paralysed? I challenge any Cavalry officer,\r\nBritish or foreign, to deny the principle that Cavalry, acting as such\r\nagainst its own Arm, can never attain complete success unless it is\r\nproficient in shock tactics.\r\n\r\n\"Cavalry soldiers must, of course, learn to be expert rifle shots, but\r\nthe attainment of this desirable object will be brought no nearer by\r\nignoring the horse, the sword or the lance. On the contrary, the\r\n_elan_ and dash which perfection in Cavalry manoeuvres imparts to\r\nlarge bodies of horsemen will be of inestimable value in their\r\nemployment as mounted rifle-men when the field is laid open to their\r\nenterprise in this rôle by the defeat of the hostile Cavalry. That the\r\nCavalry on both sides in the recent war did not distinguish\r\nthemselves or their Arm, is an undoubted fact, but the reason is quite\r\napparent. On the Japanese side they were indifferently mounted, the\r\nriding was not good, and they were very inferior in numbers, and hence\r\nwere only enabled to fulfil generally the rôle of Divisional Cavalry,\r\nwhich they appear to have done very well. The cause of failure on the\r\nRussian side is to be found in the fact that for years they have been\r\ntrained on _exactly the same principles_ which these writers now\r\nadvocate. They were devoid of real Cavalry training, they thought of\r\nnothing but getting off their horses and shooting; hence they\r\nlamentably failed in enterprises which demanded, before all, a display\r\nof the highest form of Cavalry spirit.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Sir John French protests against the tendency to\r\n_ultra-caution_ in handling cavalry at manoeuvres. The cavalry charge\r\nis always a risk. The risk taken by the Field-Marshal, for instance,\r\nwhen he ordered the famous charge which won him the way to Kimberley,\r\nwould certainly have been regarded as fatal at official manoeuvres. It\r\nis absurd, he insists, that the umpires should call on cavalry to\r\nsurrender the moment that they come face to face with an infantry\r\nfire. Such a moment may be the cavalry's great opportunity.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: VIEWS ON CAVALRY]\r\n\r\nMany of the modern armies, he holds, are suffering from cavalry\r\nwithout confidence. And there is abundant evidence to justify the\r\ncharge. Bernhardi has pointed out that the phenomenal successes of the\r\nGerman cavalry in the war of 1870-1 were due not to its own\r\nextraordinary valour, but to the absence of opposition on the part of\r\nthe French. Von Moltke made a similar criticism (which Sir John French\r\napproves) on the Prussian cavalry after the war of 1866. \"Our cavalry\r\nfailed,\" he wrote, \"perhaps not so much in actual capacity as in\r\n_self-confidence_. All its initiative had been destroyed at\r\nmanoeuvres, where criticism and blame had been almost synonymous, and\r\nit therefore shirked independent bold action, and kept far in the\r\nrear, and as much as possible out of sight.\"\r\n\r\nFrench, in fact, is convinced that the \"cavalry battle\" is by no means\r\na thing of the past. Until the enemy's cavalry is overthrown, the work\r\nof the mounted infantryman cannot begin. So long as opposing countries\r\ntrain efficient cavalry, the clash of the rival horsemen is the\r\ninevitable preliminary of any campaign.\r\n\r\nAt the same time his views on the specialisation of training are far\r\nfrom extreme. The cavalry spirit must be encouraged: but it must not\r\nbe permitted to overshadow that wider _camaraderie_ which is the Army\r\nspirit. \"It is not only possible but necessary,\" he says, \"to preach\r\nthe Army spirit, or, in other words, the close comradeship of all arms\r\nin battle, and at the same time to develop the highest qualities and\r\nthe special attributes of each branch. The particular spirit which we\r\nseek to encourage is different for each arm. Were we to seek to endow\r\ncavalry with the tenacity and stiffness of infantry, or to take from\r\nthe mounted arm the mobility and the cult of the offensive which are\r\nthe breath of its life, we should ruin not only the cavalry, but the\r\nArmy besides. Those who scoff at the spirit, whether of cavalry, of\r\nartillery, or of infantry, are people who have had no practical\r\nexperience of the actual training of troops in peace, or of the\r\npersonal leadership in war. Such men are blind guides indeed.\"[19]\r\n\r\nFor cavalry, then, Sir John French sees a brilliant future. \"The\r\nopinion which I hold and have often expressed is that the _true rôle\r\nof cavalry on the battlefield is to reconnoitre, to deceive and to\r\nsupport_. If the enemy's cavalry has been overthrown, the rôle of\r\nreconnaissance will have been rendered easier. In the rôles of\r\ndeception and support, such an immense and fruitful field of\r\nusefulness and enterprise is laid open to a cavalry division which has\r\nthought out and practised these rôles in its peace training, and is\r\naccustomed to act in large bodies dismounted, that I cannot bring\r\nmyself to believe that any equivalent for such manifest advantages can\r\nbe found even in the most successful raid against the enemy's\r\ncommunications by mounted troops.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A HISTORIC PHRASE]\r\n\r\nHow brilliantly Sir John French trained his men to accomplish these\r\nmultiple activities, recent history has shown. We may note in passing,\r\nhowever, that mechanics have now divested the cavalry of one of their\r\nchief functions. The aeroplane is now the eye of the army and the\r\nstrategical rôle of the cavalry is no more. The mounted arm will\r\nalmost certainly now be confined to screening operations and to shock\r\ntactics, after the opposing armies have come into touch with one\r\nanother. History, therefore, has obviously justified Sir John French\r\nin his championship of the cavalry spirit. Without it his horsemen\r\nwould have been no match for the German cavalry. Thanks to their\r\ntraining, they \"went through the Uhlans like brown paper\" in General\r\nSir Philip Chetwode's historic phrase.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Sir John French's Preface to _Cavalry_ by General von Bernhardi.\r\nBy permission of Messrs.

Out of an assassination at\r\nSerajevo had sprung a European war. In demanding apologies for the\r\ndeath of its Archduke, Austria-Hungary, with the connivance of\r\nGermany, refused to be conciliated with the most adequate apologies\r\noffered by Servia. The result was a protest from Russia, which would\r\ndoubtless have allayed the situation, but for the aggressive attitude\r\ndictated to Vienna from Berlin. In the sequel Great Britain found\r\nherself arrayed with Russia and France against the Austro-Germanic\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe question arose as to who should lead the English expeditionary\r\nforce so sorely needed to stem the tide of the German legions as it\r\nrolled over an outraged Belgium and an unprepared France. There was\r\nnever any doubt as to whom the great task should be entrusted. Sir\r\nJohn French was obviously the man for the task.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A CAPABLE STAFF]\r\n\r\nFate pointed to him not only as the greatest active military leader in\r\nthis country, but as the one man possessing the peculiar qualities\r\ncalled for in this campaign. There may be more brilliant intellects in\r\nthe army, but there is no other such leader of men. This campaign was\r\nbound to be a long, a hazardous and a delicate enterprise. It called\r\nfor a man of extraordinary grip and pertinacity of purpose. These\r\nqualities French possesses to a marked degree. He has also the power\r\nof sensing ability in other men. In South Africa he was able to\r\nsurround himself with one of the ablest General Staffs in Europe.\r\nFrench's extraordinary rapidity of thought, his lightning decisions,\r\nand his masterly grip of the most complex situation, allied with\r\nlieutenants competent to undertake the most difficult operations which\r\nhe may suggest, provides a combination probably unequalled in history.\r\n\r\nIn another respect French is peculiarly suited to the onerous task\r\nimposed upon him. His innate sense of loyalty makes him a colleague of\r\nrare qualities. On the face of it the British commander's position\r\ncalled for very great tact. It was delicate almost to a distressing\r\ndegree. Allied commanders have always to struggle with the teasing\r\nelement of friction. Sir John French eliminated that at the outset.\r\nEven more difficult was the problem of seniority. General Joffre, who\r\nis French's superior, is his inferior in rank, not being a\r\nField-Marshal. Here was a situation teeming with difficulties. The\r\nslightest clumsiness on the British Commander's part would have caused\r\na crisis. There were no crises, because French is a diplomatist as\r\nwell as a soldier.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the British army fairly landed on French soil than it\r\nwas faced with the worst trial of war--a prolonged and perilous\r\nretreat before overwhelming odds. But Sir John French knew all that\r\nwas to be known of the scientific retreat. Had he not seen it thirty\r\nyears ago on an Egyptian desert, and practised its every form time and\r\nagain on the African veldt? In four days the British force covered 60\r\nmiles in orderly and aggressive retreat, without once giving way to\r\nconfusion or disorder. The men who had been with French in South\r\nAfrica, General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien and General Sir Douglas Haig,\r\nhad the situation in hand from the first. The retreat was a triumph\r\nfor the British army, and particularly for the cavalry which French\r\nhad trained. Nor was its route that desired by the German Headquarters\r\nStaff. Through the vigour of his cavalry charges, French was able to\r\ndictate his own line of retreat. He had held his position long enough\r\nto save the French left wing; and he had retreated in order before a\r\nforce five times that of his own.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: SPLENDID PRAISE]\r\n\r\nFrench's old South African commander, Lord Roberts, was particularly\r\nstruck by the retreat from Mons. He expressed his admiration in the\r\nfollowing remarkable letter to Lady French:\r\n\r\n    _12 Sept., 1914._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR LADY FRENCH,\r\n\r\n  I write these few lines to tell you how much I admire your\r\n  husband's Dispatch, and how proud I am of the splendid work done\r\n  by the troops under his command. When the whole story of the war\r\n  comes to be known, the masterly way in which the Retreat from\r\n  Mons--under vastly superior numbers--was carried out, will be\r\n  remembered as one of the finest military exploits ever\r\n  achieved....[21]\r\n\r\n  I trust you will continue to get good news of Sir John, and that\r\n  you are keeping well yourself. With kindest regards, in which\r\n  Lady Roberts and my daughters join,\r\n\r\n  Believe me,\r\n    Yours sincerely,\r\n      (_Signed_) ROBERTS,\r\n        (F.-M.).\r\n\r\nThat was only the first chapter in the story of his new achievements.\r\nThe authentic history of his latest successes remains to be written.\r\nThe French, however, were not wrong in dubbing the British\r\nField-Marshal \"the modern Marlborough.\" For French belongs to the same\r\ndogged, cautious school as Marlborough and Wellington. His genius is\r\none of those which include an infinite capacity for taking pains.\r\nIndeed his thoroughness is more than Teutonic. In this war, French\r\nhas, so far, found no Napoleon to fight. It is, indeed, questionable\r\nwhether the Germans have a commander of his excellence on the field.\r\nBut the preparations of the German Headquarters Staff may be admitted\r\nto be Napoleonic in their elaborate and far-seeing perfection. Yet\r\ntime and again, as in the Napoleonic wars, they have gone down before\r\na British General who unites the dash of von Roon with the caution and\r\nthe prescience of Moltke.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Published by courtesy of Lady French and Earl Roberts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFRENCH, THE MAN\r\n\r\n    A Typical Englishman--Fighting at School--Napoleon\r\n    Worship--\"A Great Reporter\"--Halting Speeches and Polished\r\n    Prose. A South African Coincidence--Mrs. Despard and the\r\n    Newsboy--The Happy Warrior.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, this book has necessarily been chiefly a record of events.\r\nThat was inevitable, for the man of action writes his story in deeds.\r\nNor was there ever a great soldier who made less clamour in the world\r\nof newspapers than General French. He has never adopted the studied\r\nreticence of Kitchener nor yet the chill aloofness of certain of his\r\ncolleagues. War correspondents are not anathema to him; neither does\r\nhe shudder at the sight of the reporter's pencil. Yet, somehow, few\r\nanecdotes cluster round his name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is because his modesty is not a pose, although it has\r\nbecome almost a tradition. It is simply a natural trait in a modest\r\nand rather retiring disposition. French simply will not be talked\r\nabout--and there is an end of the matter.\r\n\r\nIf one were asked to describe the man, one might best answer that he\r\nis the Englishman to the _n_th. degree. It is usual to find that the\r\nman of extraordinary merit is in some degree a contrast with and a\r\ncriticism of the mere average mortal of his set. The dour urbanity of\r\nKitchener, for instance, is Oriental rather than English, and\r\ncontrasts strangely with the choleric tradition of the army officer.\r\nSo the infinite alertness and constant good humour of Roberts has a\r\nquality of Latin _esprit_ very foreign to the English temperament. But\r\nthere are no such peculiarities about French. He is the very essence\r\nof healthy normality.\r\n\r\nYet, although of Celtic descent, he is essentially English. He has not\r\nhacked his way to fame in the manner of the Scot, nor has he leapt\r\nupon her pedestal with the boisterous humour of the Irishman. He has\r\ngot there in the dogged but sporting English way, taking Fortune's\r\ngifts when they came, but never pushing or scrambling for them when\r\nthey were out of reach.\r\n\r\nOne catches the spirit of the man in the schoolboy. When he first went\r\nto school at Harrow, the boys, knowing that sisters had been\r\nresponsible for his education, were prepared to take it out of him.\r\nBut as French was ready to fight at the slightest provocation, and\r\nequally ready to swear eternal friendship when the fight was done, he\r\nquickly won his way through respect to popularity.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: AN ADMIRER OF NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\nDespite this quality, the steadfast object of his admiration has been\r\none of the most abnormal and theatrical figures in history--Napoleon.\r\nIt is, however, Napoleon the soldier and not the personality that has\r\nattracted French, who, by the way, possesses a wonderful collection of\r\nNapoleonic relics. He sees Napoleon as the greatest strategist the\r\nworld has known. As such the Corsican claims his unstinted admiration:\r\nbut there his admiration stops. For French is altogether humane. There\r\nis nothing of the iron heel about either his methods or his manners.\r\nHis extreme parsimony of life we have seen as the cause of the only\r\ncriticism which has ever been levelled against him.\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence, however, his worship of Napoleon has proved\r\nitself invaluable in an unexpected way. In following Napoleon's\r\ncampaigns out in detail, French had traversed every inch of Waterloo,\r\nand much of the Belgian battle-ground in the European war. There can\r\nbe little doubt that the success of some of his work has been due to\r\nhis detailed knowledge of the scene of operations.\r\n\r\nInevitably, perhaps, French suggests Napoleon in certain subtle traits\r\nof character rather than in personality. His rapidity of thought, for\r\ninstance, has probably rarely been equalled, since Napoleon set Europe\r\nby the ears. An officer under his command in South Africa, has\r\nrecorded how, day after day, for weeks on end, French would answer the\r\nmost intricate questions on policy and tactics over the telephone with\r\nscarcely a moment's delay. Such inhuman speed and accuracy of decision\r\nlink French with the greatest commanders of history.\r\n\r\nThere is just a suggestion of Napoleon too, in his habitual attitudes.\r\nHe usually stands with legs wide apart and arms folded either across\r\nhis chest or clasped behind his back. But the perfect cheerfulness of\r\nhis smile banishes any fear of Corsican churlishness of manner. It is\r\nvery certain that French is not feared by his staff: he is worshipped\r\nby them. The reason for that is not far to seek. Although his temper\r\nis irascible, it is not enduring. Often it will flash out in wrathful\r\nwords, but the storm is quickly over. Men of this choleric temper are\r\nalways beloved, for good humour inevitably underlies the ebullitions\r\nof so light a rage. They never nurse hatreds nor brood over trifles.\r\nAlso they are healthily impervious to the wiles of flattery or the\r\nsnare of favouritism. There is nothing of the jealous and erratic\r\ngenius about French. To read his dispatches is to find praise lavishly\r\ngiven to subordinates but no mention of self. For he looks after his\r\nassistants and leaves his own record to fate. He has, indeed, mastered\r\nthe art of being great enough to allow others to be great. Hence the\r\nexcellence which always marks his General Staff.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: THE SOLDIERS' IDOL]\r\n\r\nSuch qualities must inevitably endear a General to his officers, to\r\nthe men who have to bear the brunt of their Chief's personality. But\r\ndo they appeal to the private? Both Napoleon and Wellington\r\nindubitably took immense pains to surround themselves with a shroud of\r\nmystery. Under their dark mantles, the ranks must feel, lay buried the\r\ntalisman of success. We know that his officers found \"the sight of\r\nWellington's long nose on a frosty morning worth another ten thousand\r\nmen\" to them. Sir John French has cultivated neither a nose, nor a\r\nfrown, nor even a chin. How does he manage to be the idol of his men?\r\nit may be asked. Simply and solely by being himself. Without any of\r\nthe meretricious arts of the personality-monger, he has impressed his\r\npersonality on the troops in a most memorable way. This is largely due\r\nto the impression of quiet confidence which he always gives. You feel\r\nyou are safe with French. Nothing, you know, will ever upset the cool\r\nsanity of his reasoning, the balanced decision of his judgments. This\r\nimpression of certainly is strengthened by the distinctly masterful\r\ncarriage of the man. His short, stocky figure, like General Grant's,\r\nsuggests that fatigue is unknown to him. This is indeed the case. The\r\nstory has often been told of how the General and his staff once\r\ndecided, after an exhausting day, to spend the night in a lonely farm\r\nin South Africa. The house only boasted one bed, which was of course,\r\nreserved for the General. But French insisted on a tired member of his\r\nstaff occupying the solitary mattress, and wrapping himself up in a\r\nrug, went contentedly to sleep on the floor.\r\n\r\nHis mind is as tireless as his body. The operations round Colesberg\r\ncould only have been undertaken in their complicated entirety by a\r\nGeneral who did not know what mental fatigue meant. This physical and\r\nmental fitness French has most carefully studied to preserve. At one\r\ntime, several years ago, he feared a tendency to avoirdupois, and\r\ninstantly undertook a stern but successful bulk-reducing regimen.\r\nApropos the regimen there is a story. Just before the present war, a\r\nbulky package was one day delivered to him at his club. French opened\r\nit negligently, expecting to discover the inevitable knick-knack of\r\ndoubtful utility. But this was not the usual gift. It was a package of\r\nweight-reducing preparations.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: AN INDEPENDENT THINKER]\r\n\r\nFrench's mind, however, is original as well as tireless. Just there\r\nlies the unique quality of his gifts. The art of war is necessarily\r\none of the most highly systematised and therefore the most hide-bound\r\nin the world. No man is more perilously in danger of having his mind\r\nswathed in red tape and numbed by discipline than the soldier. In\r\nmodern times the tendency to employ masses has not lessened the\r\ntendency to stereotype habits of thought. The danger of the mechanical\r\nsoldier is stressed by no one more forcibly than by General von\r\nBernhardi. He holds that a self-reliant personality is as essential as\r\na profound knowledge of generalship to the modern commander. French\r\npossesses both. Although profoundly versed in all the doctrines of the\r\nschoolmen, he is never afraid to jump over the traces where they would\r\nlead to a precipice. He has never been hampered, as so many soldiers\r\nare, by his studies. Knowledge he has always used as a means to an\r\nend, which is its proper vocation. To this independence of mind, as to\r\nnothing else, may be attributed his phenomenal success amid the\r\nabnormal conditions of Boer warfare. Where the books end, French's\r\nactive mind begins to construct its own \"way out\" of the corner.\r\n\r\nThe Boers were indeed the first to admit his superiority to the other\r\nEnglish officers, if not to themselves. De Wet was once asked in the\r\nearly stages of the war how long he expected to avoid capture. He\r\nreplied, with a smile, that it all depended on which General was\r\ndispatched to run him down. When a certain name was mentioned, the\r\nreply was \"Till eternity.\" General B---- was next mentioned. \"About\r\ntwo years,\" was the verdict. \"And General French?\" \"Two weeks,\"\r\nadmitted De Wet.\r\n\r\nFrench has, of course, never accepted social life in this country on\r\nits face value. The young officer who was studying when his friends\r\nwere at polo or tennis, was under no illusions as to the havoc which\r\nan over-accentuation of the sporting and social side of life was\r\nplaying with the officers' work. Nowadays, like Kitchener, he is bent\r\non producing the professional and weeding out the \"drawing-room\"\r\nsoldier. No wonder that his favourite authors are those acutest\r\ncritics of English social life and English foibles, Dickens and\r\nThackeray. The former's \"Bleak House\" and the latter's \"Book of\r\nSnobs\" are the two books he places first in his affections.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: A GREAT REPORTER]\r\n\r\nHe is himself a writer of parts. We are, ourselves, so close to the\r\nevent he describes, that we are perhaps unable to appreciate the\r\nliterary excellence of the despatches which French has sent us on the\r\noperations in France. A Chicago paper hails him, however, as \"a great\r\nreporter.\" \"No one can read his reports,\" the writer remarks, \"without\r\nbeing struck with his weighty lucidity, his calm mastery of the\r\nimportant facts, the total absence of any attempt at 'effect,' and the\r\nremarkably suggestive bits of pertinent description.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the Americans are right--provided that these dispatches\r\nwere actually penned by the General himself.\r\n\r\nHis speeches may be obvious and even trite; his letters may lack any\r\nflavour of personality; but these dispatches are literature. Like his\r\nhero Napoleon, like Cæsar and Wellington, Sir John French has forged a\r\nliterary style for himself. There is nothing amateurish or\r\njournalistic about his communications from the front. The dispatch\r\nfrom Mons, for instance, is a masterpiece of lucid and incisive\r\nEnglish. It might well be printed in our school-histories, not merely\r\nas a vivid historic document, but as a model of English prose.\r\n\r\nNot that Sir John French's style is an accident. Like most of the\r\nother successes of his career, it is the result of design. The man who\r\nlaboriously \"crammed\" tactics laboured equally hard over the art of\r\nwriting. The many prefaces which he has written to famous books on\r\nstrategy and war bear traces of the most careful preparation.\r\n\r\nApart from his dispatches, however, French has written some virile,\r\ntelling English in his prefaces to several books on cavalry and on\r\nmilitary history. The most interesting is that which he wrote for\r\nCaptain Frederick von Herbert's _The Defence of Plevna_. He prefaces\r\nit with a dramatic little coincidence of war capitally told. \"During\r\nthe last year of the South African War, while directing the operations\r\nin Cape Colony, I found myself, late one afternoon in February, 1902,\r\nat the north end of the railway bridge over the Orange River at\r\nBethulie, strangely attracted by the appearance of a well-constructed\r\nand cleverly hidden covered field work, which formed an important part\r\nof the 'Bridge head.' Being somewhat pressed for time I rode on and\r\ndirected my aide-de-camp to go down into the fort, look round it, and\r\nthen catch me up. He shortly overtook me with an urgent request to\r\nreturn and inspect it myself. I did so, and was very much struck, not\r\nonly with the construction of the work and its excellent siting, but\r\nalso with all the defence arrangements at that point of the river.\r\nWhilst I was in the fort the officer in charge arrived and reported\r\nhimself. Expressing my strong approval of all I had seen, I remarked\r\nthat it brought back to my mind a book I had read and re-read, and\r\nindeed studied with great care and assiduity--a book called _The\r\nDefence of Plevna_, by a certain Lieutenant von Herbert, whom, to my\r\nregret, I had never met. 'I am von Herbert, and I wrote the book you\r\nspeak of,' was the reply of the officer to whom I spoke.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: OSMAN PASHA]\r\n\r\nOsman Pasha was a soldier after French's own heart. Indeed, his\r\ntenacity was probably equal to that of his critic. Hence this fine\r\ntribute: \"The great soldier who defended Plevna refused to acknowledge\r\nsuch a word as defeat. When things were at their worst his outward\r\ndemeanour was calmest and most confident. There was no hysterical\r\nshrieking for supports or reinforcements. These might have reached\r\nhim, but through treacherous jealousy he was betrayed and left to his\r\nown resources. In spite of this no thought of capitulation or retreat\r\never entered the mind of Osman Pasha....\"[23] What a wonderful little\r\ncameo of courage!\r\n\r\nOne wonders whether the school-boy who sent French the following\r\nletter on his return from South Africa knew the quality of his\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR FRENCH,--You are a great British General. I want\r\n  your autograph, but, whatever you do, don't let your secretary\r\n  write it.\"\r\n\r\nI have said that Sir John French is the average Englishman in an\r\naccentuated degree. How then does he regard war? If the plain truth be\r\ntold, we are not at heart a martial nation. We have made war when we\r\nhave been compelled to it by the threat of an Armada or the menace of\r\na Napoleon. But we have not cultivated war, at least since our wode\r\ndays, as a pastime and a profession. Nor is French that abnormal\r\nbeing, an Englishman governed by the blood lust. Mrs. Despard has said\r\nthat in reality he regards war as a hideous outrage. He has no\r\ndelusions as to the glory of war. By no chance could he be ranked\r\namong the romanticist of the battlefield. That, perhaps, is why he\r\nnever is, never has been, ruthless or remorseless with the men whom he\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: FRENCH AND THE SUFFOLKS]\r\n\r\nIf ever French had cause for anger, it was over the unlucky incident\r\nof the Suffolks, the one failure unwarrantably attributed to his ever\r\nvictorious arms. Yet he was the one officer who softened the\r\nbitterness of that reverse to the men. He met the regiment in the\r\nTransvaal just eight months after the disaster. His speech to the\r\ntroops, as reported in at least one paper, is well worthy of\r\npreservation. After referring to his pleasure in meeting them all\r\nagain, he said: \"What you did at Colesberg is still fresh in my\r\nrecollection ... but what I wish especially to recall is the sad event\r\nof the night of January 5th and 6th, and to express my sympathy with\r\nyou on the loss of your gallant leader, Colonel Watson, who on that\r\nnight showed splendid qualities as a noble and able officer. Now, it\r\nhas come to my knowledge that there has been spread about an idea that\r\nthat event cast discredit of some sort upon this gallant regiment. I\r\nwant you all to banish any such thought from your minds as utterly\r\nuntrue. You took part ... in a night operation of extreme difficulty\r\non a pitch dark night, and did all in your power to make it a success.\r\nSo do not let any false idea get into your minds. Think rather that\r\nwhat took place brings honour to your regiment, and add this event to\r\nthe long list of honours it has won in the past. I want you all to\r\nbear in mind about such night operations, that they can never be a\r\ncertain success, and because they sometimes fail it does not,\r\ntherefore, bring discredit on those who attempted to carry them out.\r\nYou must remember that, if we always waited for an opportunity of\r\ncertain success, we should do nothing at all, and that in war,\r\nfighting a brave enemy, it is absolutely impossible to be always sure\r\nof success: all we can do is to try our very best to secure\r\nsuccess--and that you did on the occasion I am speaking of. I thank\r\nyou for that and all the good work you have done since, and remember\r\nabove all that no slur whatever attaches to your regiment for the\r\nresult of that occasion.\"\r\n\r\nWith these finely sympathetic words might be placed French's speech to\r\nhis troops before the battle of Elandslaagte. \"Men,\" he said, \"you are\r\ngoing to oppose two thousand or three thousand Dutch. We want to keep\r\nup our honour as we did in the olden time--as soldiers and men, we\r\nwant to take that position before sunset.\"\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: FRENCH AND HIS MEN]\r\n\r\nIn that single phrase, \"as soldiers and men,\" one has the key to\r\nFrench's popularity with the ranks. He treats the men as human beings\r\nand not as machines. In other words, he understands the British\r\nsoldier through and through. Mrs. Despard has told a touching little\r\nstory of the affection which he inspires in his men. She was returning\r\nhome one evening when she was surprised by a question as she stopped\r\nto buy the customary evening paper. \"Are you Mrs. Despard, General\r\nFrench's sister?\" asked the ragged wretch. She admitted that claim to\r\ndistinction. The man then told her, with much enthusiasm, how when\r\nworking with a battery in a very hot corner during the South African\r\nwar, he had seen the General ride over to cheer them up. \"Now, hi\r\ndon't care 'oo that man is, and I don't care 'oo I am, I love that\r\nman,\" he said rather huskily. Mrs. Despard has told how she forgot her\r\npaper that night in shaking the ex-soldier's hand.\r\n\r\nFor this tact in dealing with his men, Sir John French has largely to\r\nthank the vein of acute sensibility which runs through his character.\r\nThis sensibility can be traced in his mouth, which is remarkably\r\nfinely chiselled. We have seen it in his childhood, when he shrank\r\nfrom some of the usual noisiness of boyhood. And Mrs. Despard has\r\ncrystallised it in a phrase. Feeling depressed on one occasion before\r\naddressing a meeting on some reforms which she considered urgent, she\r\nconfessed to her brother that she was spiritually afraid. \"Why,\" he\r\nreplied, \"don't worry, I've never yet done anything worth doing\r\nwithout having to screw myself up to it.\" French, very obviously, is a\r\nman for whom spiritual doubt may have its terrors. One cannot figure\r\nhim as harbouring the narrow if sincere religion of a Kitchener or a\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\nOne might sum him up as the _beau-ideal_, not only of the cavalry\r\nspirit, but of the scientific soldier. He can lead a cavalry charge\r\nwith the dash of a Hotspur: and he can plan out a campaign with the\r\nmasterly logic of a Marlborough. Unlike some of his contemporaries, he\r\nhas attained extraordinary mastery over the science of war without\r\nhimself becoming a scientific machine. In many ways he bears, in\r\ncharacter and temperament, a striking resemblance to his colleague in\r\narms--General Joffre. Although Joffre is three inches taller than\r\nFrench--he is five foot nine--he is otherwise very similar in\r\nappearance. There is the same short, powerful physique, the narrow\r\nneck surmounted by a massive head and heavy jaw, and the same broad\r\nforehead, with masterful eyes peeping from beneath bushy eyebrows.\r\nNeither of these men on whom hangs Europe's destiny is in the least\r\ndegree strident or self-assertive. Indeed, both tend to be listeners\r\nrather than talkers. Both have the same trick of making instantaneous\r\ndecisions. Both scorn to be merely \"smart\" in outward appearance; both\r\nare devoted to efficiency in detail; and, most suggestive of all, each\r\nfinds himself eternally compared to General Grant! Probably the\r\nlatter's dogged personality forms the best possible common denominator\r\nfor these two remarkable men.\r\n\r\n[Page Heading: AN OPPORTUNITY]\r\n\r\nIt is said that when news of the war in South Africa reached French,\r\nmomentarily obeying a natural impulse, he waved his hand and cried,\r\n\"Hurrah for South Africa.\" If anyone had any right to thank Heaven for\r\nthat particular campaign, it was certainly French. But he would have\r\n\"hurrahed\" any campaign that gave opportunity for his powers. After\r\nall, the soldier's stage is the battlefield. Without wars he is\r\nwithout an active rôle, and must spend his years drudging in the\r\nrehearsal theatre of the Colonies. If he be so original and so\r\nthorough a soldier as French, his abilities will be at an even graver\r\ndiscount. For the rehearsal is not the play; and the best Generals,\r\nlike the ablest actors, are notoriously weak at rehearsal, which does\r\nnot pluck fully at their energies. Probably French would have hurrahed\r\nfor South Africa, however, had he had no special abilities at all.\r\nFor nowhere is he happier than on the battlefield. If the grisly game\r\nof war must be played, French plays it with all his heart. It is the\r\ngame which destiny put him on the stage to play; the game which he has\r\ndevoted his life to mastering; and the only game in which he has ever\r\nseriously interested himself.\r\n\r\nLuck invariably follows the man who is utterly absorbed in his\r\nprofession, for the simply reason that, being always engrossed in his\r\nwork, he is always alive to his opportunities. French's luck consists\r\nsolely in the fact that he happens to be a soldier. Men of Kitchener's\r\norganising genius may be many things; in nothing, not even in the\r\narts, are they likely to seriously fail. But French is a soldier in\r\nthe sense quite other than Kitchener. He is a man made for the\r\nendurance of hardship and for the facing of hard practical\r\ndifficulties in the field. It is as natural for him to conduct a\r\ncampaign as it was for Pope to \"lisp in numbers, for the numbers\r\ncame.\" He is the Happy Warrior in being.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] From Sir John French's Preface to _The Defence of Plevna_, by\r\nCapt.

Smith, Elder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE MONS DESPATCH\r\n\r\n_To the Secretary of State for War_\r\n\r\n      _September 7, 1914._\r\n\r\n  MY LORD,\r\n\r\n  I have the honour to report the proceedings of the Field Force\r\n  under my command up to the time of rendering this despatch.\r\n\r\n  1. The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by\r\n  rail was effected in the best order and without a check. Each unit\r\n  arrived at its destination in this country well within the\r\n  scheduled time.\r\n\r\n  The concentration was practically complete on the evening of\r\n  Friday, the 21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to\r\n  move the Force during Saturday, the 22nd, to positions I\r\n  considered most favourable from which to commence operations which\r\n  the French Commander-in-Chief, General Joffre, requested me to\r\n  undertake in pursuance of his plans in prosecution of the\r\n  campaign.\r\n\r\n  The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from Conde\r\n  on the west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line was\r\n  taken up as follows:--\r\n\r\n  From Conde to Mons inclusive was assigned to the 2nd Corps, and to\r\n  the right of the 2nd Corps from Mons the 1st Corps was posted. The\r\n  5th Cavalry Brigade was placed at Binche.\r\n\r\n  In the absence of my 3rd Army Corps I desired to keep the Cavalry\r\n  Division as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer\r\n  flank, or move in support of any threatened part of the line. The\r\n  forward reconnaissance was entrusted to Brigadier-General Sir\r\n  Philip Chetwode with the 5th Cavalry Brigade, but I directed\r\n  General Allenby to send forward a few squadrons to assist in this\r\n  work.\r\n\r\n  During August 22 and 23 these advanced squadrons did some\r\n  excellent work, some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and\r\n  several encounters took place in which our troops showed to great\r\n  advantage.\r\n\r\n  2. At 6 a.m. on August 23 I assembled the Commanders of the 1st\r\n  and 2nd Corps and Cavalry Division at a point close to the\r\n  position, and explained the general situation of the Allies, and\r\n  what I understood to be General Joffre's plan. I discussed with\r\n  them at some length the immediate situation in front of us.\r\n\r\n  From information I received from French Headquarters I understood\r\n  that little more than one, or at most two, of the enemy's Army\r\n  Corps, with perhaps one Cavalry Division, were in front of my\r\n  position; and I was aware of no attempted outflanking movement by\r\n  the enemy. I was confirmed in this opinion by the fact that my\r\n  patrols encountered no undue opposition in their reconnoitring\r\n  operations. The observation of my aeroplanes seemed also to bear\r\n  out this estimate.\r\n\r\n  About 3 p.m. on Sunday, the 23rd, reports began coming in to the\r\n  effect that the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line,\r\n  apparently in some strength, but that the right of the position\r\n  from Mons and Bray was being particularly threatened.\r\n\r\n  The Commander of the 1st Corps had pushed his flank back to some\r\n  high ground south of Bray, and the 5th Cavalry Brigade evacuated\r\n  Binche, moving slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied\r\n  Binche.\r\n\r\n  The right of the 3rd Division, under General Hamilton, was at\r\n  Mons, which formed a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed\r\n  the Commander of the 2nd Corps to be careful not to keep the\r\n  troops on this salient too long, but, if threatened seriously, to\r\n  draw back the centre behind Mons. This was done before dark. In\r\n  the meantime, about 5 p.m., I received a most unexpected message\r\n  from General Joffre by telegraph, telling me that at least three\r\n  German Corps, viz., a reserve corps, the 4th Corps and the 9th\r\n  Corps, were moving on my position in front, and that the 2nd Corps\r\n  was engaged in a turning movement from the direction of Tournay.\r\n  He also informed me that the two reserve French divisions and the\r\n  5th French Army on my right were retiring, the Germans having on\r\n  the previous day gained possession of the passages of the Sambre\r\n  between Charleroi and Namur.\r\n\r\n  3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons\r\n  position, I had previously ordered a position in rear to be\r\n  reconnoitred. This position rested on the fortress of Maubeuge on\r\n  the right and extended west to Jenlain, south-east of\r\n  Valenciennes, on the left. The position was reported difficult to\r\n  hold, because standing crops and buildings made the siting of\r\n  trenches very difficult and limited the field of fire in many\r\n  important localities. It nevertheless afforded a few good\r\n  artillery positions.\r\n\r\n  When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German\r\n  threatening on my front reached me, I endeavoured to confirm it by\r\n  aeroplane reconnaissance; and as a result of this I determined to\r\n  effect a retirement to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the\r\n  24th.\r\n\r\n  A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line\r\n  throughout the night, and at daybreak on the 24th the 2nd Division\r\n  from the neighbourhood of Harmignies made a powerful demonstration\r\n  as if to retake Binche. This was supported by the artillery of\r\n  both the 1st and 2nd Divisions, whilst the 1st Division took up a\r\n  supporting position in the neighbourhood of Peissant. Under cover\r\n  of this demonstration the 2nd Corps retired on the line\r\n  Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The 3rd Division on the right of the\r\n  Corps suffered considerable loss in this operation from the enemy,\r\n  who had retaken Mons.\r\n\r\n  The 2nd Corps halted on this line, where they partially entrenched\r\n  themselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the 1st Corps gradually\r\n  to withdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much\r\n  further loss, reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 p.m.\r\n  Towards midday the enemy appeared to be directing his principal\r\n  effort against our left.\r\n\r\n  I had previously ordered General Allenby with the Cavalry to act\r\n  vigorously in advance of my left front and endeavour to take the\r\n  pressure off.\r\n\r\n  About 7.30 a.m. General Allenby received a message from Sir\r\n  Charles Fergusson, commanding 5th Division, saying that he was\r\n  very hard pressed and in urgent need of support. On receipt of\r\n  this message General Allenby drew in the Cavalry and endeavoured\r\n  to bring direct support to the 5th Division.\r\n\r\n  During the course of this operation General De Lisle, of the 2nd\r\n  Cavalry Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyse the\r\n  further advance of the enemy's infantry by making a mounted attack\r\n  on his flank. He formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was\r\n  held up by wire about 500 yards from his objective, and the 9th\r\n  Lancers and 18th Hussars suffered severely in the retirement of\r\n  the Brigade.\r\n\r\n  The 19th Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the Line of\r\n  Communications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22nd\r\n  and 23rd. On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a\r\n  position south of Quarouble to support the left flank of the 2nd\r\n  Corps.\r\n\r\n  With the assistance of the Cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was\r\n  enabled to effect his retreat to a new position; although, having\r\n  two corps of the enemy on his front and one threatening his flank,\r\n  he suffered great losses in doing so.\r\n\r\n  At nightfall the position was occupied by the 2nd Corps to the\r\n  west of Bavai, the 1st Corps to the right. The right was protected\r\n  by the Fortress of Maubeuge, the left by the 19th Brigade in\r\n  position between Jenlain and Bry, and the Cavalry on the outer\r\n  flank.\r\n\r\n  4. The French were still retiring, and I had no support except\r\n  such as was afforded by the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the\r\n  determined attempts of the enemy to get round my left flank\r\n  assured me that it was his intention to hem me against that place\r\n  and surround me. I felt that not a moment must be lost in retiring\r\n  to another position.\r\n\r\n  I had every reason to believe that the enemy's forces were\r\n  somewhat exhausted, and I knew that they had suffered heavy\r\n  losses. I hoped, therefore, that his pursuit would not be too\r\n  vigorous to prevent me effecting my object.\r\n\r\n  The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not\r\n  only owing to the very superior force in my front, but also to the\r\n  exhaustion of the troops.\r\n\r\n  The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of the 25th to\r\n  a position in the neighbourhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were\r\n  ordered to be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eth Road by 5.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n  Two Cavalry Brigades, with the Divisional Cavalry of the 2nd\r\n  Corps, covered the movement of the 2nd Corps. The remainder of the\r\n  Cavalry Division, with the 19th Brigade, the whole under the\r\n  command of General Allenby, covered the west flank.\r\n\r\n  The 4th Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday,\r\n  the 23rd, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a\r\n  Brigade of Artillery with Divisional Staff were available for\r\n  service.\r\n\r\n  I ordered General Snow to move out to take up a position with his\r\n  right south of Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-Le Cateau\r\n  Road south of La Chaprie. In this position the Division rendered\r\n  great help to the effective retirement of the 2nd and 1st Corps to\r\n  the new position.\r\n\r\n  Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le\r\n  Cateau-Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th,\r\n  been partially prepared and entrenched, I had grave doubts--owing\r\n  to the information I received as to the accumulating strength of\r\n  the enemy against me--as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.\r\n\r\n  Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my\r\n  right, my exposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy's western\r\n  corps (II) to envelop me, and, more than all, the exhausted\r\n  condition of the troops, I determined to make a great effort to\r\n  continue the retreat till I could put some substantial obstacle,\r\n  such as the Somme or the Oise, between my troops and the enemy,\r\n  and afford the former some opportunity of rest and reorganisation.\r\n  Orders were, therefore, sent to the Corps Commanders to continue\r\n  their retreat as soon as they possibly could towards the general\r\n  line Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.\r\n\r\n  The Cavalry, under General Allenby, were ordered to cover the\r\n  retirement.\r\n\r\n  Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the 1st Corps\r\n  continued its march on Landrecies, following the road along the\r\n  eastern border of the Forêt De Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies\r\n  about 10 o'clock. I had intended that the Corps should come\r\n  further west so as to fill up the gap between Le Cateau and\r\n  Landrecies, but the men were exhausted and could not get further\r\n  in without rest.\r\n\r\n  The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9.30\r\n  p.m. a report was received that the 4th Guards Brigade in\r\n  Landrecies was heavily attacked by troops of the 9th German Army\r\n  Corps who were coming through the forest on the north of the town.\r\n  This brigade fought most gallantly and caused the enemy to suffer\r\n  tremendous loss in issuing from the forest into the narrow streets\r\n  of the town. This loss has been estimated from reliable sources at\r\n  from 700 to 1,000. At the same time information reached me from\r\n  Sir Douglas Haig that his 1st Division was also heavily engaged\r\n  south and east of Maroilles. I sent urgent messages to the\r\n  Commander of the two French Reserve Divisions on my right to come\r\n  up to the assistance of the 1st Corps, which they eventually did.\r\n  Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the skilful manner\r\n  in which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his Corps from an\r\n  exceptionally difficult position in the darkness of the night,\r\n  they were able at dawn to resume their march south towards\r\n  Wassigny on Guise.\r\n\r\n  By about 6 p.m. the 2nd Corps had got into position with their\r\n  right on Le Cateau, their left in the neighbourhood of Caudry, and\r\n  the line of defence was continued thence by the 4th Division\r\n  towards Seranvillers, the left being thrown back.\r\n\r\n  During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the Cavalry became a good\r\n  deal scattered, but by the early morning of the 26th General\r\n  Allenby had succeeded in concentrating two brigades to the south\r\n  of Cambrai.\r\n\r\n  The 4th Division was placed under the orders of the General\r\n  Officer Commanding the 2nd Army Corps.\r\n\r\n  On the 24th the French Cavalry Corps, consisting of three\r\n  divisions, under General Sordêt, had been in billets north of\r\n  Avesnes. On my way back from Bavai, which was my \"Poste de\r\n  Commandement\" during the fighting of the 23rd and 24th, I visited\r\n  General Sordêt, and earnestly requested his co-operation and\r\n  support. He promised to obtain sanction from his Army Commander to\r\n  act on my left flank, but said that his horses were too tired to\r\n  move before the next day. Although he rendered me valuable\r\n  assistance later on in the course of the retirement, he was unable\r\n  for the reasons given to afford me any support on the most\r\n  critical day of all, viz., the 26th.\r\n\r\n  At daybreak on August 26 it became apparent that the enemy was\r\n  throwing the bulk of his strength against the left of the position\r\n  occupied by the 2nd Corps and the 4th Division.\r\n\r\n  At this time the guns of four German Army Corps were in position\r\n  against them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he\r\n  judged it impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as\r\n  ordered) in face of such an attack.\r\n\r\n  I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavours to break off the\r\n  action and retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was\r\n  impossible for me to send him any support, the 1st Corps being at\r\n  the moment incapable of movement.\r\n\r\n  The French Cavalry Corps, under General Sordêt, was coming up on\r\n  our left rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message\r\n  to him to do his utmost to come up and support the retirement of\r\n  my left flank; but owing to the fatigue of his horses he found\r\n  himself unable to intervene in any way.\r\n\r\n  There had been no time to entrench the position properly, but the\r\n  troops showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which\r\n  confronted them.\r\n\r\n  The Artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made\r\n  a splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.\r\n\r\n  At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to\r\n  be avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was\r\n  given to commence it about 3.30 p.m. The movement was covered with\r\n  the most devoted intrepidity and determination by the Artillery,\r\n  which had itself suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the\r\n  Cavalry in the further retreat from the position assisted\r\n  materially in the final completion of this most difficult and\r\n  dangerous operation.\r\n\r\n  Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too heavily to engage\r\n  in an energetic pursuit.\r\n\r\n  I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand of the\r\n  British troops without putting on record my deep appreciation of\r\n  the valuable services rendered by General Sir Horace\r\n  Smith-Dorrien.\r\n\r\n  I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the\r\n  Army under my command on the morning of the 26th August could\r\n  never have been accomplished unless a commander of rare and\r\n  unusual coolness, intrepidity, and determination had been present\r\n  to personally conduct the operation.\r\n\r\n  The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and\r\n  through the 27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the\r\n  line Noyon-Chauny-La Fère, having then thrown off the weight of\r\n  the enemy's pursuit.\r\n\r\n  On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to General Sordêt and the\r\n  French Cavalry Division which he commands for materially assisting\r\n  my retirement and successfully driving back some of the enemy on\r\n  Cambrai.\r\n\r\n  General D'Amade also, with the 61st and 62nd French Reserve\r\n  Divisions, moved down from the neighbourhood of Arras on the\r\n  enemy's right flank and took much pressure off the rear of the\r\n  British Forces.\r\n\r\n  This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced\r\n  at Mons on Sunday afternoon, August 23, and which really\r\n  constituted a four days' battle.\r\n\r\n  At this point, therefore, I propose to close the present\r\n  despatch.\r\n\r\n  I deeply deplore the very serious losses which the British Forces\r\n  have suffered in this great battle; but they were inevitable in\r\n  view of the fact that the British Army--only two days after a\r\n  concentration by rail--was called upon to withstand a vigorous\r\n  attack of five German Army Corps.\r\n\r\n  It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced\r\n  by the two General Officers commanding Army Corps; the\r\n  self-sacrificing and devoted exertions of their Staffs; the\r\n  direction of the troops by Divisional Brigade and Regimental\r\n  Leaders; the command of the smaller units by their officers; and\r\n  the magnificent fighting spirit displayed by non-commissioned\r\n  officers and men.\r\n\r\n  I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's notice the\r\n  admirable work done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David\r\n  Henderson. Their skill, energy, and perseverance have been beyond\r\n  all praise. They have furnished me with the most complete and\r\n  accurate information, which has been of incalculable value in the\r\n  conduct of the operations. Fired at constantly both by friend and\r\n  foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of weather, they have\r\n  remained undaunted throughout.\r\n\r\n  Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in\r\n  destroying five of the enemy's machines.\r\n\r\n  I wish to acknowledge with deep gratitude the incalculable\r\n  assistance I received from the General and Personal Staffs at\r\n  Headquarters during this trying period.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Murray, Chief of the General\r\n  Staff; Major-General Wilson, Sub-Chief of the General Staff; and\r\n  all under them have worked day and night unceasingly with the\r\n  utmost skill, self-sacrifice and devotion; and the same\r\n  acknowledgment is due by me to Brigadier-General Hon. W. Lambton,\r\n  my Military Secretary, and the Personal Staff.\r\n\r\n  In such operations as I have described the work of the\r\n  Quartermaster-General is of an extremely onerous nature.\r\n  Major-General Sir William Robertson has met what appeared to be\r\n  almost insuperable difficulties with his characteristic energy,\r\n  skill and determination; and it is largely owing to his exertions\r\n  that the hardships and sufferings of the troops--inseparable from\r\n  such operations--were not much greater.\r\n\r\n  Major-General Sir Nevil Macready, the Adjutant-General, has also\r\n  been confronted with most onerous and difficult tasks in\r\n  connection with disciplinary arrangements and the preparation of\r\n  casualty lists. He has been indefatigable in his exertions to meet\r\n  the difficult situations which arose.\r\n\r\n  I have not yet been able to complete the list of officers whose\r\n  names I desire to bring to your Lordship's notice for services\r\n  rendered during the period under review; and, as I understand it\r\n  is of importance that this despatch should no longer be delayed, I\r\n  propose to forward this list, separately, as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n      I have the honour to be,\r\n  Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,\r\n    (Signed) J.D.P.
