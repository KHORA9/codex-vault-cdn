Hoppé_]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF BALLET\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nMARK E. PERUGINI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon: Martin Secker\r\nNumber Five John Street Adelphi\r\n\r\nFirst published 1915\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TO\r\n                               MY WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome may possibly wonder to find here no record of Ballet in Italy,\r\nor at the Opera Houses of Madrid, Lisbon, Vienna, Buda-Pest,\r\nBerlin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Warsaw, or Petrograd (formerly St.\r\nPetersburg), not to speak of the United States and South America.\r\nThis, however, would be to miss somewhat the author’s purpose, which\r\nis not to trace the growth of Ballet in every capital where it has\r\nbeen seen. To do so effectively were hardly possible in a single\r\nvolume. A whole book might well be devoted to the history of the art\r\nin Italy alone, herein only touched upon as it came to have vital\r\ninfluence on France and England in the nineteenth century. We have\r\nalready had numerous volumes dealing with Russian Ballet; and since\r\nthe ground has been extensively enough surveyed in that direction\r\nthere could be no particular advantage in devoting more space to\r\nthe subject than is already given to it in this work, the purpose\r\nof which only is to present--as far as possible from contemporary\r\nsources--some leading phases of the history of the modern Art of\r\nBallet as seen more particularly in France and England.\r\n\r\nA brief series of biographical essays “Cameos of the Dance,” by the\r\nsame writer, was published in _The Whitehall Review_ in 1909; various\r\narticles on the subject also being contributed to _The Evening News_,\r\n_Lady’s Pictorial_, _Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News_, _Pall\r\nMall Gazette_ and other London journals during 1910 and 1911; and\r\na series of “Sketches of the Dance and Ballet,” coming from the\r\nsame hand, appeared in _The Dancing Times_, 1912, 1913 and 1914.\r\nThey were based on portions of the manuscript of the present work\r\nwhich, begun some years ago by way of pastime, and written during\r\nthe scant leisure of a crowded business life, was completed at the\r\npublisher’s request, and was--save for a few brief insertions in the\r\nproofs--ready, and announced for publication before the Great War\r\nbegan in August 1914.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of this book has involved the marshalling of a\r\nvast array of facts and dates, the delving into and comparison of\r\nsome three hundred or more ancient and modern volumes on dancing\r\nand on theatrical and operatic history, the study of scores of old\r\nnewspaper-files and long-forgotten theatrical “repositories” and\r\nsouvenirs. Error is always possible in spite of care, and if it\r\nshould have happened here the writer will be grateful for correction.\r\nIn covering so wide a field a full bibliography becomes impossible\r\nfrom limits of space; but to those interested the following list\r\nof leading authorities--supplemented by those referred to in the\r\ntext--may be of service. “La Danse Grecque Antique,” by M. Emmanuel;\r\n“Roman Life and Manners under the Early Empire,” by L. Friedländer;\r\n“Dramatic Traditions of the Dark Ages,” by Joseph S.

The charm--as in the case of any other art--will probably\r\nalways remain rather a matter of individual opinion; the historic\r\ninterest is merely a matter of fact.\r\n\r\nNo man can hope for agreement with his fellows in all things. The\r\nworld were flat if it could be so. He may hector, and not convince;\r\nhe may cajole and not convert; he may tell the simple truth in simple\r\nspeech and still be misunderstood. So many of his partners in the\r\ndance of life speak in different tongues; or, speaking the same, use\r\nwords and phrases more familiar to them than to himself.\r\n\r\nIn going to a foreign land we change our currency; but it is hardly\r\nto be accounted spurious because it is not as ours. There may be\r\nsomething to be said for the variety; and, also, there may be some\r\ncommon basis of value which can be accepted readily by both. A\r\nworld-currency has not yet arrived. In opinion it is much the same.\r\n\r\nBut the sense of “fair play” is so admirable, and so truly British\r\na characteristic, that one may usually rely on it for a considerate\r\nhearing. Possible dissentients may be the more inclined to grant\r\nthis if they are informed at the outset that this book has no\r\nspecially persuasive purpose, and that I am content that it should be\r\nmainly accounted a record of fact.\r\n\r\nOne of the facts which it chronicles is that Ballet, whether an\r\n“art” or not, has existed, in some form or another, for about two\r\nthousand years. An interest which can show so long a record may yet\r\nnot be of such surpassing importance, let us say, as Statecraft or\r\nReligion; but one which has thus long and widely appealed to the\r\næsthetic sense of mankind can hardly be considered worthless. It\r\nwere a vast and complex matter to decide the relative values of the\r\nvarious “arts,” and, certainly this book is no endeavour to pronounce\r\nthereon, nor to persuade any that Ballet is the greatest, though it\r\nis unquestionably one of the oldest of the arts. But it will suffice\r\nto offer the opinion that, whether it has reached its highest level\r\nor not as yet Ballet _is_ an art in itself; one that in the past has\r\nhad so many judicious and sympathetic exponents, and has so long a\r\nrecord of existence, that there is really some justification for the\r\nexpenditure of casual leisure by any who cares to play the chronicler\r\nor to read such chronicle.\r\n\r\nThis much said, before setting out to travel the road of the past,\r\nlet us for a moment reconsider another fact, namely, that we have in\r\nLondon two theatres where for about a quarter of a century Ballet\r\n_was_ the main attraction. The fact is unique in the annals of the\r\nBritish stage.\r\n\r\nBallets have been produced elsewhere occasionally. We have seen\r\noperas, pantomimes, burlesques, of which they formed a part. At\r\nearlier periods--as in the ’forties of last century--they have also\r\nbeen seen as separate items in the programme of an operatic season;\r\nand there has been a quite remarkable revival of interest during the\r\npast few years. But in all the history of the stage there was never\r\nbefore a time when it could be said that for such a period not one\r\nbut two theatrical houses in London _continuously_ offered this kind\r\nof entertainment as their chief attraction.\r\n\r\nIt has to be remembered that this sustained existence of Ballet in\r\nEngland has been, as in the case of all “legitimate drama,” without\r\nState aid such as it has received in Milan, Rome, Naples, Paris,\r\nVienna, Petrograd, Copenhagen, and elsewhere on the Continent, where\r\nthe physical advantages of dancing and the artistic value of Ballet\r\nare fully appreciated. The arts must flourish haphazard here! We have\r\nno national conservatoire in which this art of Ballet is taught as it\r\nis abroad. Consequently it has been less generally understood; and,\r\nbeing so, has had to exist in face of considerable prejudice.\r\n\r\nSome critics profess to despise it because it ignores the spoken\r\nword. Some have decried it because of the presence of dancing. Some\r\nwill not admit that it is worthy to be called an art at all, and\r\nthere are possibly still some primly primitive people who pretend to\r\nview with moral pain the existence of any such entertainment. They\r\nmay patronise a theatre or tolerate an actor or actress--but a Ballet\r\nor a Ballet-Dancer!\r\n\r\nThe misunderstanding of the aims and possibilities of the Art of\r\nBallet, as seen at its best, is to be regretted.\r\n\r\nNot for such critics are the music of moving lines, the modulating\r\nharmonies of colour, the subtleties of mimic expression, nor all the\r\nwealth of historic associations and romantic charm which a knowledge\r\nof its past recalls.\r\n\r\nAustere critics would do well, when deprecating Ballet, to remember\r\nthat many others have found it, as Colley Cibber regretfully admitted\r\nit was found in his time: “a pleasing and rational entertainment.”\r\n\r\nThat it is “pleasing” many know from witnessing some of the best\r\nof modern examples. As to whether it can be considered “rational”\r\ndepends so much on the kind of meaning that may be given to that\r\nword. All rational people speak in prose; constantly to speak in\r\nverse might be considered quite irrational. But are we to banish\r\npoetry from the world because it is not the common form of speech?\r\n\r\nSome people might find it quite irrational to sit in a theatre and\r\nlaugh or weep at the imaginary joys or woes of imaginary characters\r\nimpersonated by people who are not seriously concerned therewith, and\r\nwith whom, personally, we are not at all concerned.\r\n\r\nIt might be well considered irrational to be moved by any “concord of\r\nsweet sounds,” at least in the shape of “opera”; or to be enspelled\r\nby the charm of a statue or a painting, or by the wizardry of any\r\nform of art; for once it is questioned whether it be “rational,”\r\nthere need be no end to dispute; and one remembers how poor Tolstoy\r\nfared in essaying to decide: “What is Art?”\r\n\r\nThat of Ballet surely is no less rational than Poetry, than Drama,\r\nthan Music, Sculpture, Painting--all of which exist by _their_\r\nconventions, all of which in principle it employs; to all of which it\r\nis akin. It is not less an art; and when looking at a modern ballet\r\nwe can hardly fail to consider the long train of reasoned thought and\r\nof artistic tradition that lie beyond the entertainment that we see\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that we see? An orchestra of dancers who are also mimes,\r\nwho represent--one should rather say, realise--the imaginative\r\ncreations of an author, or a number of authors working harmoniously\r\ntogether, in terms of rhythmic movement and dramatic expression, with\r\nthe aid also of colour and music and sound.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these dancers has had to undergo a special and arduous\r\ntraining, the traditions of which reach back through centuries till\r\nlost in time’s obscurity.\r\n\r\nEach has an allotted place at any given moment in the general scheme.\r\nEvery grouping and dispersal of a group--like the formation and\r\nmodulation of chords in music--is part of an ordered plan.\r\n\r\nEvery step of every dancer, every gesture, every phrase of music, is\r\ncomposed or selected to express particular ideas or series of ideas;\r\nevery colour and each change of tone in the whole symphony of hues\r\nhas been appraised. Not a thing that happens is haphazard.\r\n\r\nIt is probably by reason of the number of people that must be\r\nemployed, and the labour entailed before a successful result can be\r\nachieved, and on account of the difficulties and risks attendant\r\non its production, that we have had so few theatres devoted to an\r\nart so thoroughly appreciated abroad, not only as one of ancient\r\ninstitution, but as one that still offers wide scope for the creative\r\ngenius of poet, artist and musician, apart from the interpretative\r\nabilities of dancer and of mime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA DISTINCTION, AND SOME DIFFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief elements of Ballet as seen to-day are--dancing, miming,\r\nmusic and scenic effect, including of course in this last the\r\ncostumes and colour-schemes, as well as the actual “scenery” and\r\nlighting.\r\n\r\nIt is in the proper harmonising of these elements that the true\r\nart of Ballet-composition, or, as it is called, “choreography,”\r\nconsists. Each has its individual history, and all have been combined\r\nin varying proportions at various periods. But it is only in the\r\npast hundred and fifty years or so that they have been harmoniously\r\nblended in the increasing richness of their development to give us\r\nthis separate, protean and beautiful art--the Ballet of the Theatre.\r\n\r\nThese four elements are the material of which Ballet is composed, and\r\nthe result may be judged by their balance.\r\n\r\nWe are to think not of the worst examples that have been, but of the\r\nbest, and of those that yet might be.\r\n\r\nMost of the older writers on dancing speak of almost all concerted\r\ndances as ballets and refer to the “ballets” of the Egyptians, the\r\nGreeks and the Romans. The Abbé Menestrier, however, writing in the\r\nseventeenth century, wisely observed the distinction between dances\r\nthat are _only_ “dances,” and those that approximate to “ballet.”\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that it is possible to dance and not\r\nrepresent an idea save that of dancing, as when a child dances for\r\njoy, _not in order to represent the joy of another_. That is the\r\nprovince of the Mime. It is equally possible to mimic without dancing.\r\n\r\nThe best ballet-dancer is one who has intelligence and training to do\r\nboth, whose dancing and mimicry are interpretative.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of certain Egyptian and Greek figure-dances and the approach\r\nof some of them to the Ballet as he knew it towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, Menestrier wrote: “_J’appelle ces Danses Ballets\r\nparce qu’elles n’etoient pas de simples Danses comme les autres,\r\nmais des Representations ingenieuses, des mouvements du Ciel et des\r\nPlanétes, et des evolutions du labyrinthe dont Thésée sortit_.”\r\nThat is a distinction to be remembered by any who may look on the Art\r\nof Ballet as simply--dancing.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to-day to make another distinction, that between\r\n“ballet,” and “the ballet of the theatre.” In a sense the Hindus,\r\nthe Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, indeed all peoples in past\r\nages have had ballets; that is, dances which were “_representations\r\ningenieuses_,” which represented an idea or told a story.\r\n\r\nThere have been entertainments, too, of which dancing formed\r\na considerable part--such as our English “masques,” which,\r\ncontemporaneously, were often spoken of as “ballets.”\r\n\r\nBut though they may for convenience have been so called, they were\r\nnever more than partly akin with the ballet of the theatre as we\r\nsee it to-day. They never exhibited that balance of subordinated\r\nand _developed_ arts which the best examples of later times have\r\nshown; and were not seen in the public theatre, as a form of dramatic\r\nentertainment apart from others.\r\n\r\nOne has only to consider for an instant what were the musical and\r\nscenic resources of the Greek and Roman stage, and compare them with\r\nthe resources of modern orchestration and scenic effect to realise\r\nthe difference between antique “ballet” and that of to-day.\r\n\r\nSetting aside this difference, which arises from the development of\r\nthe several elements through the centuries, one may find many an\r\nancient definition of “ballet” that appears apt enough to-day, for\r\nthe difference is not so much one of principle as this of resources.\r\n\r\nAthenæus, a second-century Greek critic, declared: “Ballet is an\r\nimitation of things said and sung,” and Lucian, that--“It is by the\r\ngesture, movements and cadences that this imitation or representation\r\nis made up, as the song is made up by the inflections of the voice.”\r\nThis is a happy illustration. Inflections might well be described as\r\n“gestures” _of the voice_.\r\n\r\nMenestrier (who, besides writing an exceedingly entertaining history\r\nof Ballet, also wrote extensively on Heraldry, and was author\r\nof several solid historical works as well as numerous poems and\r\n_libretti_) has said: “Ballet is an imitation like the other arts,\r\nand that much has in common with them. The difference is, that while\r\nthe other arts only imitate certain things, as painting, which\r\nexpresses the shape, colour, arrangement and disposition of things,\r\nBallet expresses the _movement_ which Painting and Sculpture could\r\nnot express, and by these movements can represent the nature of\r\nthings, and those characteristics of the soul which only can find\r\nexpression by such movements. This imitation is achieved by the\r\nmovements of the body, which are the interpreters of the passions\r\nand of the inmost feelings. And even as the body has various\r\nparts composing a whole and making a beautiful harmony, one uses\r\ninstruments and their accord, to regulate those movements which\r\nexpress the effect of the passions of the soul.”\r\n\r\nThese definitions have decided value, but hardly quite meet the case\r\nof modern Ballet.\r\n\r\nNoverre, Blasis, Gardel, and other of the older _maîtres de ballet_,\r\nhave told us in several charming books, essays, letters, dialogues\r\nand _libretti_, much as to what Ballet can and should be, but yet\r\nleave something to seek in the matter of brief yet comprehensive\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nIt is with some hesitancy, therefore, that I venture, before talking\r\nof its history, to suggest as a simple definition that: “a ballet\r\nis _a series of solo and concerted dances with mimetic actions,\r\naccompanied by music and scenic accessories, telling a story_.”\r\n\r\nIt is by reason of this definition that I propose to pass somewhat\r\nlightly over the early dawn of Ballet, or rather of its earliest\r\nelements, the dance and miming; and that I propose to deal more fully\r\nwith the period _after_ the advent of Louis Quatorze--in France and\r\nin England--which saw the development of the _Ballet du Théâtre_.\r\n\r\nThere have, of course, been modern ballets that did not tell a story.\r\nBut the true Ballet of the theatre should.\r\n\r\nSuch have been the best of those of Noverre, of Blasis, of Perrot,\r\nNuittier, Théophile Gautier, and of later composers of ballet like\r\nTaglioni, Manzotti, Coppi, Mme. Lanner, Wilhelm, Curti, Fokine, and,\r\nindeed, all the best ballets of later years; and such will the best\r\nalways be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEGYPT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the drama is hardly to be reckoned among the historic\r\nmysteries. By serious triflers debate might be held as to what should\r\nbe considered the first dramatic representation and when it actually\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nSome five centuries before the Christian era the first plays of\r\nwhich scholarship has taken note were performed at Athens, those\r\nof Thespis, forerunner of the first great dramatists of the\r\nworld--Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.\r\n\r\nFor convenience the origin of Western drama may be dated from Thespis\r\nbecause it seems first to have assumed then a definite form. That is\r\nnot its actual origin any more than the origin of any human being is\r\nto be dated from its birth. As a possibility it may be said to have\r\nexisted always. Even Chronology has its limitations, and preceding\r\nany given event there must have existed principles or tendencies.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said, therefore, that the origin of the Drama is not an\r\nhistoric mystery it is because we are not very much in the dark as\r\nto when it began to assume a somewhat definite form; and, moreover,\r\nwe can be fairly clear as to what must have preceded it. There seems\r\nrather more than a probability that the Drama derived its existence\r\nfrom the Poet, in his capacity as a Narrator.\r\n\r\nFor some hundreds of years the Drama has been chiefly a\r\nrepresentation of character and events, whether real or fictitious.\r\nIn its earliest forms it was mainly descriptive. It would seem to be\r\nthe natural order of things that from mere description there should\r\narise in time--possibly from a half-conscious feeling of the need\r\nof _emphasis_, of a desire to _impress_ the hearers--the attempt\r\nto _illustrate_ or to _represent_ the scenes or actions described.\r\nThe mere repetition of any story seems to tend towards that. Have\r\nwe not observed that no “fish” story is ever quite complete--if not\r\nconvincing--without histrionic illustrations?\r\n\r\nThough in India and China, with their more ancient civilisation, the\r\nchronologic origin of the Drama might be more remotely placed, it is\r\nprobable that in the Homeric bard and the Homeric audience, should\r\nbe sought the true beginning of the Western theatre; while, all the\r\nworld over, the evolution of the dramatic form has probably been much\r\nthe same--namely, a gradual transition from poetic _narration_ to\r\nimitative representation. Thus at the back of the Drama is probably\r\nthe Poet. Beside the Poet, too, is often the Priest.\r\n\r\nGreek tragedy is usually said to have had a purely “religious”\r\norigin, and certainly it was from early times employed for the\r\npurposes of, or in the service of, Religion; but it would, one\r\nfeels, be rather truer to presume its actual origin to be purely\r\nsecular, and to be found in the Poet making his appeal to an ordinary\r\naudience, in a word, to the People, while sometimes under the\r\npatronage of priestly and ruling classes.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we come to consider the origin of the Dance--first and\r\nmost important of the “four elements” of Ballet--we are forced to\r\nthe conclusion that, even though we are on more uncertain ground, it\r\nmust, nevertheless, be far older than the Drama. Why this should be\r\nso, even though we have no approximate date to go upon as in the case\r\nof the Thespian theatre, is not difficult to see.\r\n\r\nThe Drama evolved from, and has always depended on, the faculty of\r\nspeech, and on the growth of a language. A copious vocabulary and\r\nflexibility of verbal expression are not exactly characteristics of\r\nthe primitive races; and, without both, the Drama, as we have known\r\nit for some centuries, could not have existed.\r\n\r\nBut the Dance (with mimicry, which has always followed close upon its\r\nheels) has no need of words, and is itself a kind of speech, in which\r\nthe whole body is used as a means of expression.\r\n\r\nWe are none of us old enough to remember, and there is consequently\r\nno need to be dogmatic and assert that the Dance actually _did_\r\nprecede speech; but it is far from improbable that it could\r\nhave done; and while one shudders to think of the ardent _danse\r\ntourbillon_ our Mother Earth must have danced from the moment of her\r\nbirth, it is perhaps more amusing--and yet not wholly frivolous--to\r\ncontemplate a possible origin of the Dance in the sport some Simian\r\nancestors may have found in rhythmically swaying on the flexile\r\nbranches of some primeval tree, before they had acquired a vocabulary\r\nsufficiently copious for the analysis of their sensations.\r\n\r\nSeriously, however, and just because it has a rhythmic basis, dancing\r\nin some form is among the earliest instincts of mankind, even as it\r\nis of children. In all climes, at all periods, men and women have\r\ndanced; and its origin is lost in the mists of prehistoric years.\r\nNon-civilised races still existent may offer evidence as to stages\r\nin its evolution; but even among the more primitive races, dancing\r\nseems to have some definiteness of form, marking a heritage of long\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nFrom some earliest, uncouth leapings and gestures of savage or half\r\nsavage tribes (the effect of mere exuberant physical energy) may have\r\ngrown the idea of thus expressing joy and thankfulness; for joy, not\r\nsorrow, one feels must surely have been always the first inspirer of\r\nthe Dance; and possibly a victory over an enemy, or gratitude for a\r\nfull harvest may have come to be first the inspiration, and then the\r\nexcuse for repeating such manifestations.\r\n\r\nRepetition of an act tends to create a habit, and what may be at\r\nfirst apparently a spontaneous experiment grows by repetition into a\r\ncult, with set form and ritual.\r\n\r\nThe ritual of the Dance seems to be as ancient as the stars, in\r\nrepresenting the movements of which, it is supposed by some to have\r\nhad its origin in Egypt over two thousand years ago. Nowhere is it\r\nfound without form. All must be done in a certain way, according\r\nto the traditions of the locality in which the dance is seen, or\r\naccording to some wider tradition. Always it has a ritual of its own,\r\nbut also with religious ritual the origin of the Dance--as also of\r\nthe Drama--appears in some mysterious manner to be upbound.\r\n\r\nOf all the records that we have of dancing, the earliest are,\r\napparently, those of Egypt. Its origin is not there; it must be\r\nolder; but we know at least that the Egyptians were among the first\r\npeople with a civilisation that encouraged dancing.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest among modern historians of the art, divides\r\ndancing, for convenience in tracing its evolution, into “sacred” and\r\n“profane”; that is, the Dance forming, as so often it did in ancient\r\ntimes, part of a religious ceremonial, and that which in any other\r\nof its forms was merely a pleasure of the people. For our purpose\r\nin tracing the growth of Ballet, however, it would seem advisable\r\nto divide the Dance yet further, into “sacred,” “secular,” and\r\n“theatrical.”\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians had no Ballet of the theatre, because they had no\r\ntheatre. They had dances which seem to have been “_representations\r\ningenieuses_,” and to that extent, as mimetic dances, partook of\r\nthe nature of Ballet; but they were not organised as theatrical\r\nspectacles for private or public entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had no Ballet of the theatre because, though they had the\r\ntheatre, they, like the Egyptians, had merely mimetic dances, not\r\nBallet.\r\n\r\nBut if Egypt had no popular theatre in which dancing was seen, it\r\nappears to have existed, nevertheless, in three distinct forms--as\r\na pleasure of “the man in the street”--just as we see children\r\ndance to a barrel-organ in the London streets to-day; again, as an\r\nentertainment for the wealthy, just as a popular singer, dancer\r\nor other entertainer of to-day is engaged for an “at home” or\r\ndinner-party; and, finally, as an element of the elaborate and\r\nsomewhat theatrical Egyptian religious ceremonial.\r\n\r\nMonuments from Thebes and Beni Hassan show pictures of Egyptian\r\ndancers performing steps very similar to some we can see to-day. They\r\nappear to be performing them for the pleasure of onlookers as well as\r\ntheir own. This acquiring of an audience has, after all, been always\r\nof first importance, and without it the Drama could hardly have come\r\ninto existence.\r\n\r\nMost people are interested in seeing others do something they are\r\nunable to do themselves, and when they can see it well done, in a\r\nmanner, that is, suggesting a difficult feat accomplished with ease,\r\nthey will even pay for the exhibition. That is the popular (with\r\nmanagers the extremely popular) side of the theatrical arts, of which\r\ndancing is one. When there arises the desire to see the exhibition\r\nrepeated frequently, then must follow the special place with special\r\nfacilities and accessories for the performance, and the theatre,\r\nor something like it, thus comes into existence as an institution\r\nsustained by popular support. There is first the thing done for\r\npleasure--which is art; then the exploitation of it for profit--which\r\nis commerce; that is the brief epitaph of any art as a fruit of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians did not reach the “theatre” stage. But dancing,\r\nessentially a popular art, received encouragement as an element in\r\nreligious festivals and as an entertainment of the wealthy classes.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difference of opinion exists as to the “religious”\r\ndances of Egypt. Enthusiastic historians of dancing seem rather too\r\nprone to expand the little store of fact we possess, and some go to\r\nthe length of speaking of the religious and popular “ballets” of the\r\nEgyptians. But it is certain that they had no regular theatrical\r\nspectacles in which dancing was of prime importance; and their\r\npopular dances, to any such extent as they could be described as\r\n“_representations ingenieuses_,” were primitive in comparison with\r\nany of later times.\r\n\r\nSolo-dances and _pas de deux_ were general enough, but the dancing\r\nof massed groups, and the dramatic representation of a story, appear\r\nto have been unknown, or have passed unrecorded if they were known.\r\nThe nearest approach to them, though not of course performed as\r\na theatrical spectacle, would seem to have been an “astronomical\r\ndance,” which was done by or under the direction of the priests\r\nof Apis, and is said to have been--appropriately enough!--a\r\nrepresentation of the movements of the stars. It is probable that it\r\nwas employed mainly as a means of education.\r\n\r\nHoly Church in mediæval times took advantage of the popular craving\r\nfor theatrical shows, and sought by the aid of “mystery plays,” and\r\n“moralities” to extend the knowledge of religious truths. It may be\r\nconjectured that the Egyptian hierarchy similarly had some such end\r\nin view, and that the priestly caste sought to utilise the popular\r\ntaste for dancing as a means of influence, and that the actual\r\nperformance of the dance served to fix more lastingly in the minds of\r\nnovices the religious and astronomical truths it embodied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Egyptian Male Dancer\r\n\r\n(_From a Theban Fresco_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egyptian Dancing Girls\r\n\r\n(_From a mural painting in the British Museum_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Greek Funeral Dance\r\n\r\n(_From a coloured plaque in the Louvre_).]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the star-dance, the Egyptians are said to have had a\r\n“funeral” dance, but it is doubtful if this, the “Maneros”--of which\r\nHerodotus speaks--was a solemn dance. The fact is, however, that\r\ninformation both as to the religious and ceremonial uses of dancing\r\namong the Egyptians is very scant, and what little record we have of\r\ntheir dancing is mainly on its popular side and is to be gleaned from\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\nOne of the frescoes in the British Museum shows two girls performing,\r\napparently before a select audience of women, one of whom is seen to\r\nbe applauding, or perhaps marking the time with syncopated clapping,\r\nas negroes do to-day.\r\n\r\nAnother representation of dancing is on a fresco from Thebes showing\r\nthree figures, the centre of whom is apparently performing an\r\n_entrechat_, as seen to-day, the step in which the dancer crosses\r\nfeet in mid-air; while a fourth acts as orchestra with a couple of\r\nthe curious curved maces which were beaten together to mark the\r\nrhythm in sonorous fashion.\r\n\r\nOther Egyptian monuments also show dancers, one from Beni Hassan\r\ndepicting several couples, apparently boys, performing a dance that\r\nobviously had certain set steps, and suggests that it was used\r\nmainly as a rhythmic athletic exercise, as were many of the Greek\r\ndances. And yet another monument shows men apparently in the act of\r\nperforming a pirouette. About them all there is the air of decision,\r\na suggestion of trained performance that in itself, remembering that\r\nthese monuments are some four thousand years old, and depict steps\r\nsimilar to some performed to-day, is testimony to the antiquity of\r\nthe art of dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGREECE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of testimony, pictorial and literary, to the ancient\r\nGreek love of the Dance.\r\n\r\nAmong the various arts of war and peace that Vulcan engraved upon\r\nthat wondrous shield which he fashioned at the entreaty of sad Thetis\r\nfor her son Achilles, the Dance was not forgotten; and the Homeric\r\nsinger must have been a lover of the art to limn as clear a picture\r\nas is given in the eighteenth book of the Iliad.\r\n\r\n        “There, too, the skilful artist’s hand had wrought\r\n         With curious workmanship, a mazy dance,\r\n         Like that which Dædalus in Knossos erst\r\n         At fair-haired Ariadne’s bidding framed.\r\n         There, laying each on other’s wrists their hand,\r\n         Bright youths and many-suitored maidens danced.”\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        “Now whirled they round with nimble practised feet,\r\n         Easy, as when a potter, seated, turns\r\n         A wheel, new-fashioned by his skilful hand\r\n         And spins it round, to prove if true it run:\r\n         Now featly moved in well-beseeming ranks.\r\n         A numerous crowd, around, the lovely dance\r\n         Surveyed, delighted; while an honoured Bard\r\n         Sang, as he struck the lyre, and to the strain\r\n         Two tumblers, in the midst, were whirling round.”\r\n\r\nThe “two tumblers” is an interesting detail, but it does not\r\nnecessarily refer to the sort of acrobatic “tumbling” we are\r\nfamiliar with to-day. There have always been two phases of the Dance\r\nwhich can best be understood by noting the distinction marked by the\r\nuse of two words in French--at least by their use among the masters\r\nand writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--namely,\r\n_danser_ and _sauter_. The former means to dance, “_terre-à-terre_,”\r\nthat is, always with the feet, or one foot at least, on or close to\r\nthe ground; _sauter_, means invariably to leap into the air, or even\r\nto perform steps while both feet are in the air.\r\n\r\nWe usually speak of “a somersault,” a “double somersault,” and so\r\nforth. The word is a corruption from the old French _soubresault_,\r\nfrom the Latin _supra_, over, and _saltus_, leap.\r\n\r\nEarly historians of the Dance frequently speak of “saltation,”\r\nwithout any reference to the “somersault” as we know it, but to what\r\nwe should call simply dancing.\r\n\r\nThe Homeric picture must have been repeated innumerable times since\r\nit was first limned, whenever and wherever there has been a gathering\r\nof men and maids on a village green, dancing in a circle, with a\r\ncouple of high-leaping lads in the centre inciting all to quicken the\r\nrhythm of the whirling dance. Many an Elizabethan village must have\r\nrealised such a scene; and for all the artifice of the stage, with\r\nits paint and footlights, does it not hold something of the antique\r\ntradition in the picture often seen, of a circle of dancing girls\r\nenclosing two wildly turning “stars”? Is it impossibly un-Hellenic to\r\npresume that the “Two tumblers, in the midst, were whirling round” in\r\n_pirouettes_? At least it may be considered--a presumption!\r\n\r\nFar later in Hellenic days we have a gracious picture of the Dance\r\nin Theocritus’ eighteenth Idyll, “The Bridal of Helen,” which reads\r\ndelightfully in Calverley’s translation:\r\n\r\n     “Whilom in Lacedæmon tripped many a maiden fair\r\n      To gold-pressed Menelaus’ halls with hyacinths in her hair,\r\n      Twelve to the painted chamber, the queenliest in the land,\r\n      The clustered loveliness of Greece came dancing hand-in-hand.\r\n      With woven steps they beat the ground in unison and sang\r\n      The bridal hymn of triumph till all the Palace rang.”\r\n\r\nThe Greek dance, it should be noted, was almost invariably\r\naccompanied by singing; and the poet probably was often indebted\r\nto the dance for the rhythm of his verse. The bridal dance was of\r\nvery ancient institution. Indeed, there were few occasions which\r\nwere not celebrated with dancing, and the Greeks even followed the\r\nEgyptian custom of having “dancers” at their funerals! It is not to\r\nbe thought, however, that the steps were exactly gay; nor need there\r\nhave been anything incongruous, for we can be sure the instinctive\r\ntaste of the people would not have admitted such a thing, and,\r\nmoreover, a dance and a dancer as they saw it, were rather different\r\nfrom the vision we have recalled by such words.\r\n\r\nTo the ancient Greeks the Dance was a cult, an element in the\r\nreligious and physical well-being of the individual and the State:\r\nand the dance that was taught to the child became an important and\r\nlasting factor in the physical growth and culture of the man.\r\n\r\nWe who, most of us, are only too apt to look on dancing as a mere\r\ntrivial pastime, may wonder that it _was_ so seriously considered\r\nby the Greeks, and that it should have so earnestly engaged the\r\nattentions of such philosophers as Plato and Lucian. But perhaps that\r\nis only because we have not considered it sufficiently ourselves and\r\nhave associated it too closely with theatrical display.\r\n\r\nIn any form in which it is at its best the theatre is one of\r\nthe noblest and most influential institutions of civilisation;\r\nas dancing, at its best, is one of the finest, because most\r\ncomprehensive, of the theatrical arts. But there is a vast difference\r\nbetween the dance which was a means of physical and mental\r\ndevelopment, pursued amid the health-giving surroundings of sunshine\r\nand fresh air, and, let us say, some such degradation of art as\r\nsome examples of the “classic” dance we have seen of recent years,\r\nperformed in the glare of footlights, amid the smoke-laden atmosphere\r\nof a music-hall.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is an obvious one, but the thing to consider is that we\r\nin England have allowed an art which held an important place in Greek\r\nnational life, and which should be of the greatest educational value\r\nto ourselves, to become mainly a spectacle of the theatre, where more\r\noften than not it is seen at its best, not necessarily because it is\r\nthe result of the best system, _but because it is the fruit of the\r\ngreatest practice_.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to deal very fully with the Hellenic\r\ndance in the space of a chapter in a volume which is not intended\r\nto trace the evolution of the Dance but of Ballet. An entire book\r\nwere needed to treat the subject adequately--and we have not such a\r\nbook in English, as yet. But Emmanuel’s masterly technical review of\r\nHellenic dancing in his volume _La Danse Grecque_, is invaluable, and\r\nis testimony to the sound and catholic scholarship which in France\r\nscorns no subject as “trivial” merely because those ignorant of its\r\nhistory dismiss it as such; and which finds sympathetic students in\r\na country where all the arts are treated with a respect that is at\r\nleast as great as that offered to commercialism.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks are said to have derived their earlier dances from Egypt.\r\nThis may be questionable, because it is equally likely that there\r\nwas a traditional, indigenous dance in Greece. But it was _through_\r\nthe Greeks, certainly, that dancing first assumed that variety and\r\nperfection of form and style which all the arts seemed destined to\r\nattain under their quickening, purifying, and inspiring influence;\r\nand it was the Greeks, too, who first began to develop the art of\r\nmimicry.\r\n\r\nFirst, as already suggested, there would probably have been some\r\noccasion for joy, tending to express itself by dancing; and a victory\r\nover an enemy, or gratitude for a full harvest (the more exalted when\r\nthe harvest was of the grape!) would have been such occasions. Later\r\nmust have come the idea of _representing_ the victory celebrated, or\r\nthe imagined characteristics of the being or beings who were supposed\r\nto be the cause of the earth’s fruition, and who, if propitiated by\r\nthis tumultuous acknowledgment of gratitude, perhaps might renew\r\ntheir favours.\r\n\r\nThus, in time, out of the ritual of the Dance would have grown the\r\nritual of representation--Mimicry, miming, or “acting,” as we call\r\nit; and little by little, from the wild exuberance of recurring\r\npoetic festivals, such as those in honour of Dionysus, would\r\nhave grown the ordered sense of Drama, the _representation_ of\r\nthanksgiving, of feelings, events and things by Mimicry, the actor’s\r\nart; either allied with, or separate from, dancing.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, improving on the Egyptians, invented and developed the\r\nidea of the Theatre. But though the Greeks in their Drama _utilised_\r\nthe arts of dancing and mimicry, it would seem that they were quite\r\nsubordinated to the literary and dramatic art of the all-inspiring\r\nPoet, and that words, with a meaning behind them, words representing,\r\nas far as words can, thoughts, passions, emotions, actions, things,\r\nwere the essential medium of Greek Drama, _not_ the art of the Dancer\r\nor the Mime.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the Greek _orcheisthai_ (ὀρχεῖσθαι),\r\nto dance, implied more than mere steps with the feet. It\r\nincluded much that goes to make a really good ballet-dancer of\r\nto-day--interpretative dancing and mimetic gesture. The Greeks in\r\nfact had some of the material, if they did not have as we know\r\nit--the Ballet.\r\n\r\nThe earliest dramatic poets, Thespis, Phrynichus, were called\r\n“dancers” because in addition to providing the drama as poets, their\r\nfunction was to train their choruses in the dances which, accompanied\r\nby singing, were introduced in the play.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated of the actors in the plays of Æschylus,\r\nTelestes, was said not merely to indicate feelings but to “describe”\r\nevents with his hands; and this, which was really miming, was\r\nconsidered as part of dancing, which Aristotle defined as “the\r\nrepresentation of actions, characters and passions by means of\r\npostures and rhythmic movements.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch analyses dancing as “Motions, Postures and Indications,” a\r\n“posture” being the attitude of the dancer at the moment of arrested\r\nmovement, and an “indication,” the gesture which indicated an\r\nexternal object referred to in a poet’s lines, such as the sky; or\r\nsuch as an orator would use when raising his hand heavenward invoking\r\nthe gods.\r\n\r\nThe chief dances used in the Greek drama were the _Emmeleia_, a\r\nstately measure; _Hyporchemata_, lively dances; the _Kordax_, a very\r\ncoarse and rough comic dance; and finally the _Sikinnis_, which was\r\nattached especially to satyric comedies and parodied as a rule the\r\nmeasure of the _Emmeleia_.\r\n\r\nThese were all a part, though a subordinate part, of the classic\r\ndrama, and, according to some authorities, had their foundation\r\nin the rhythm of the poet’s verse as it was sung by the chorus or\r\ndeclaimed by the chief actors.\r\n\r\nBut apart from these there were mimetic dances. One, in which we\r\nmay perhaps even see a hint of the origin of dancing itself, is\r\nfound in Longus’ novel, _Daphnis and Chloe_, in which Dryas performs\r\na vintage-dance, “pretending to gather grapes, to carry them in\r\npanniers, to tread them in a vat and pour the flowing juice into\r\njars, and then to drink of the wine thus newly made”; and all done so\r\ncleverly that the spectators were deceived for the time and thought\r\nthey really saw the grapes, the vats, and the wine the actor made\r\npretence of drinking. This, probably an incident drawn from life, was\r\nindeed a “_representation ingenieuse_,” and even suggests yet another\r\nof the many possibilities as to the origin of the Dance, namely--that\r\ndancing itself may have originated from the treading of grapes.\r\n\r\nThe famous Pyrrhic dance was of course mimetic and represented\r\na series of war-like incidents, all of which had an educational\r\npurpose, as by their means the youthful soldier was taught how to\r\nadvance and retreat, how to aim a blow or hurl a javelin and to dodge\r\nthem; and how to leap and vault, in event of meeting ditches and\r\nwalls. Apart from military dances in which physical culture and grace\r\nwere the chief aims, there were many dances of a purely festival\r\ncharacter taken part in by young men and girls, and by girls alone.\r\n\r\nThe close association between religion and the Dance in ancient\r\nHellenic days is seen in the number of festivals in honour of the\r\ngods, at which special dances were performed, apart from those which\r\nformed part of the classic drama and others which were merely by way\r\nof joyous pastime. Certain dances were performed annually in honour\r\nof Jupiter; others, such as the _Procharysteriæ_, were in honour of\r\nMinerva; then there was the _Pæonian_ dance in honour of Apollo;\r\nthe _Ionic_, and the _Kalabis_ and the famous Dance of Innocence,\r\ninstituted by Lycurgus, and executed to the glory of Diana, by young\r\nLacedæmonian girls before the altar of the goddess. The Delian\r\ndance, special to the isle of Delos, was much the same in character\r\nand closed with the offering of floral garlands on the altar of\r\nAphrodite. One of the most solemn incidents of the Eleusinian\r\nmysteries was the mystical dance-drama representing the search of\r\nCeres for her daughter Proserpine--practically a “ballet,” in the\r\nolder acceptance of the word.\r\n\r\nThe secular dance of the Greeks was essentially an individualistic\r\nform. Men and women only rarely danced together, and when they did,\r\nthe joining of hands, or anything like chain-dancing was exceptional.\r\nOne of these exceptions was the _Hormos_, or Collar-dance as it\r\nwas called, which Lucian describes as being danced by youths and\r\nmaidens advancing one by one in the form of a collar, made up of the\r\nalternating jewels of feminine grace and manly strength, the dance\r\nbeing led by a youth. Most of the Greek dances had a leader, and\r\nthe favour in which the art was held is shown by the fact that they\r\ntermed their Chief Magistrate _Pro-orchestris_, or Leader of the\r\nDance. As a rule, chain-dances were performed by one or the other sex.\r\n\r\nIn another sense also the Hellenic dance was individualistic. We are\r\naccustomed to see entire groups, eight, sixteen, or even thirty-two\r\nor more dancers all performing the same step simultaneously. It\r\nis one of the conventions of Ballet, like the chorus in “musical\r\ncomedy.” But the Greeks had not that convention.\r\n\r\nAlthough their dance was based on strict rhythm and was governed\r\nby rigid rules, they governed the dance of the individual, not of\r\ngroups. He, or she, was adjudged a good dancer by the grace of line\r\ndisplayed and rhythmic balance of movement, and many a vase painting\r\nexhibits groups of dancers who, though dancing in the mass, are\r\neach doing different steps; and equally the gestures and mimetic\r\nexpression of each differed.\r\n\r\nThe system unquestionably had its advantages, for while the rhythm\r\nof the song or poetic verse which accompanied the performers was the\r\ncommon basis of the dance for all, the individuality of expression\r\nundoubtedly gave a vitality to the group which accounts for the\r\nvividness and charm of their representation on many an antique vase.\r\n\r\nNumerous indeed were the various forms of the Hellenic dance,\r\nsacred, dramatic, secular--Meursius catalogues some two hundred--but\r\nfurther description would detain us too long _en route_ towards the\r\nculmination of all these earlier types of mimetic and other dances in\r\nthe Ballet of to-day, and we have next to trace the growth of Latin\r\nMime and Pantomime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMIME AND PANTOMIME: ROME, HIPPODROME--OBSCURITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf to Greece modern Ballet owes much for the encouragement of the\r\nDance, to Rome it is even more indebted for the development of the\r\nart of Pantomime.\r\n\r\nBy many the word Pantomime is associated solely with that\r\ntime-honoured entertainment which children, home for the Christmas\r\nholidays, are supposed to be too _blasé_ to care for, but which they\r\ngo to by way of obliging parents who feel it their duty to take them.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas pantomime has long been one of our cherished\r\ninstitutions, though, like the British Constitution, it has undergone\r\nmany changes. It is still given at Christmas. That much of tradition\r\nremains. But most of its original features have all but disappeared.\r\nTime was, two hundred years ago, when it was mainly “Harlequinade,”\r\nand Harlequin and his gay comrades of Italian comedy were the heroes\r\nof the play. Then classical plots and allusions, with an elaboration\r\nof scenic effect and “machines,” brought about a gradual change. In\r\nthe early nineteenth century a “topical” and “patriotic” element had\r\ncrept in; but the Harlequinade, although shortened, and, shall we\r\nsay, _broadened_, still remained.\r\n\r\nThen a craze for “transformation” scenes set in because the extreme\r\ngorgeousness of the tinsel productions of Kemble and Macready--the\r\narchæological and historic “accuracy” of which was always\r\nemphasised!--forced the pantomime producers in self-defence to go one\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAnd then came Grimaldi to give a new life to the whimsies of that\r\nClown whose prototype dates back to ancient Rome; and for half a\r\ncentury or more the Christmas pantomime continued much the same--a\r\nfamiliar nursery-story played out to the accompaniment of fairy-like\r\nand glittering scenic accessories, concluding with a rough-and-tumble\r\nHarlequinade, until in recent years the introduction of the\r\nMusic-hall performer gave us the entertainment we have to-day.\r\n\r\nNot thus, however, was the antique “pantomime,” which, evolving\r\nfrom the more ancient and spoken “Mimes,” became, because it took\r\nall nature for its province--pan-mimicry, or pantomime; the stage\r\nrepresentation, without the spoken word, of all that eye could see or\r\nmind of man conceive.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a far step from narrative to impersonation--marking an\r\nadvance in the technique of acting; and it was some time before the\r\nGreek Drama had achieved this. But it was not so much the impressive\r\nand noble side of the Greek Drama that taught the actors, not merely\r\nto _declaim_ situations but to _act_ them; it must have been the\r\npopular, the comic side; and it was probably the Doric farce, and\r\nlater the early Latin comedy derived therefrom, that really brought\r\nto perfection under the Roman Empire the art of _Miming_ apart from\r\nthe art of Dancing.\r\n\r\nThe comic is so much nearer to life as we see it every day than the\r\ntragic; and it was this ability to see the more familiar comic side\r\nof life, and the desire to travesty the serious--whether in Greece or\r\nRome--that first gave flexibility and variety to the art of miming,\r\nor “acting,” as we call it nowadays.\r\n\r\nIt is because of this nearness to the life of the time, because of\r\nthe travesty of contemporary types and public affairs, that the Latin\r\nactors made their wide appeal.\r\n\r\nFrom public encouragement would come the increasing endeavour of\r\npopular actors to outshine each other in technical _tours de force_;\r\nand from playing the familiar types of Latin Comedy, such as Maccus,\r\nwith his double hump, prototype of our Punch; Pappus, forerunner of\r\nPantaloon, and other characters (some from the early _Mimi_, some\r\nfrom the _Atellanæ_ and _Togatæ_ of tradition), the Latin Actors\r\nof the first and second centuries A.D. ultimately aspired to the\r\nwordless representation of the gods and heroes of myth and legend.\r\n\r\nAccording to one authority, “the Latin Pantomime grew out of the\r\ncustom at this period--the first century of the Christian era--of\r\nhaving lyrical solos, such as interludes to flute accompaniment,\r\nbetween the acts of the Latin comedies.” According to that\r\nadmirable historian of the stage, Mr. Charles Hastings, “this new\r\nmode (Pantomime) was a kind of mime, in which poses and gestures\r\nconstituted the fundamental portion of the play. Words occupied\r\na secondary place, and _eventually disappeared altogether_. Only\r\nthe music was preserved, and in order that the audience might\r\nunderstand the gestures of the actors, little books were distributed\r\nin Greek text, intelligible only to the learned and to the upper\r\nclasses. Later on the mask--rejected by the mime--was adopted, and\r\na chorus was employed to _accompany the comedian with their voices,\r\nand to explain the multiple gestures by which the actors created\r\nthe different characters in turn. Moreover, there was a company\r\nof mute players._ The libretti left almost unlimited liberty of\r\ndetail. Sometimes the music broke off to enable the actor to finish\r\nhis _fioritura_ and variations. Sometimes, on the other hand, the\r\ncomedian paused, or left the stage, while the story was taken up by\r\nthe recitative and the instruments.”\r\n\r\nAll this reads much like a description of a modern “mimodrame,” such\r\nas “L’Enfant Prodigue,” or “Sumurun.” Again it reads not unlike a\r\ndescription of a modern ballet, for with these do we not often have\r\nprinted synopses distributed, though _not_ in Greek text? But we have\r\nto remember that the music was primitive, the scenic effect, though\r\noften remarkable, was different from that of our modern stage, with\r\nits greater mechanical resources; and, finally, that all this was an\r\ninnovation of the Roman stage, for we are talking of the period that\r\nsaw the dawn of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nAmong the more famous of the Latin pantomimists were Pylades, who\r\nwas the inventor of tragic pantomimes; and Bathyllus, who was the\r\ncomposer of livelier episodes. For some time they joined forces and\r\nhad a theatre of their own, where they staged comedies and tragedies\r\ncomposed by themselves without words or any other aid in telling the\r\nstory of the play than dancing, pantomime and music.\r\n\r\nThe innovation struck the popular fancy, and all Rome flocked\r\nto support the new venture. The two actors were received at the\r\nEmperor’s Court, and became the spoilt darlings of the Roman “smart”\r\nset. The inevitable happened. They began to intrigue at Court,\r\nand were made the centre of intrigue; they became as jealous of\r\neach other as rival opera singers, and in time a financially happy\r\npartnership was dissolved, and there were two theatres devoted to\r\npantomimes instead of one.\r\n\r\nBut as this form of drama was a novelty, and pleased the\r\n“connoisseurs,” who were numerous and increasing in numbers, both\r\ntheatres were equally successful, perhaps the more so in that the\r\npublic is always specially interested in ventures that appear to be\r\nin rivalry. The taste for existing stage-productions slackened in\r\nfavour of those offered by Pylades and Bathyllus. Their “ballets”\r\nwhether tragic, comic or satiric were looked on as the very\r\nperfection of tragedy, comedy or satire.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer a matter of declamatory style to enjoy or to\r\ncriticise, it was a matter of steps, movements, gestures, attitudes,\r\nfigures or positions that were discussed by wise connoisseurs of\r\n“the new thing,” who in Rome, as elsewhere to-day, had much to say\r\non what they presumed to understand because--it was new! And such,\r\nit is said, was the genius of the “producers” of this novel form of\r\nentertainment; the effect was so natural, the stage-pictures were\r\nso convincing, the pathos was so moving or the gaiety so free and\r\ninfectious, that the audiences forgot they had ears while using\r\nenchanted eyes; and expressive gestures took the place of vocal\r\ninflections, of the power of words and the magic of poetic verse.\r\n\r\nPylades before long found a rival star arise in the person of Hylas,\r\nwhose greatest performance was said to be in _Œdipus_. If Pylades and\r\nBathyllus had quarrelled, there was evidently no love lost between\r\nPylades and Hylas.\r\n\r\nHylas on one occasion was giving a representation of Agamemnon and,\r\nat a particular line referring to that historic personage as “the\r\ngreat,” he rose up on tip-toe. “That,” said Pylades scornfully, “is\r\nbeing _tall_, not ‘great’”; a criticism not only just, but giving\r\nan excellent insight into the methods and ideas of the famous Latin\r\npantomimist.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat uncertain whether it was the Court intrigues of\r\nBathyllus or of Hylas or of both which ultimately secured from the\r\nEmperor the sentence of banishment for Pylades, or whether it was the\r\ndaring, not to say impudence of the actor in representing well-known\r\npeople, or whether again it may not have been the increasing danger\r\nof the constant brawls which were taking place daily in the streets\r\nof Rome between the rival factions--the Pyladians and the Bathyllians.\r\n\r\nBut whatsoever the reason, the probability is that the perpetual\r\nstrife between the parties supporting the adored actors (worse than\r\never was that between the Piccinists and Gluckists of the eighteenth\r\ncentury), with the constant blood-shed it involved, was made the\r\nexcuse for the convenient removal of one of the principal factors in\r\nthe disorder, and that the influence of Bathyllus, possibly backed up\r\nby that of Hylas, was able to secure the removal of the tragic actor.\r\n\r\nPylades, however, had his revenge, for such was the uproar in Rome on\r\nhis banishment that the Emperor was practically forced to recall him,\r\nand he returned in triumph.\r\n\r\nIt is time, however, to leave the affairs of popular actors of the\r\nancient world, since it is less the details of their personal history\r\nwe need to consider than their importance as the virtual inventors\r\nof the second element of Ballet, the art of the mime, or, to use for\r\na moment the more comprehensive word--pantomime. Thus we can see\r\nthat it is largely due to the perfecting by the Italians of that\r\nart which seems to have been even more natural to them than to the\r\nGreeks--miming, that we have the Ballet of to-day.\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of the Christian era, comedy gave place to a perfect\r\ncraze, first for the mime, and then for its offspring, pure\r\npantomime. But, finally, the mimetic art as a standing entertainment\r\nof the Roman public, came to suffer neglect in favour of circuses;\r\nthen, together with the circuses, it was opposed by the Churches.\r\nThere were spasmodic revivals in the fourth and fifth centuries, but\r\nfrom the fifth century mime and pantomime practically ceased to exist\r\nin Constantinople, to which the seat of the Roman Empire had by that\r\ntime been removed; and the arts both of the dancer and the mime fell\r\nupon a period of obscurity, though they went into retirement with all\r\nthe reluctance of a modern “star.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCHURCH THUNDER AND CHURCH COMPLAISANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a truism of history that opposition towards the amusements\r\nof a people only increases the desire for them, and that the undue\r\npressure of a law, or of a too rigid majority, only stimulates the\r\ninvention of evasions. In dramatic history there is ample proof of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIn England during the seventeenth century the force of Puritan\r\nopinion and of law did not crush the Drama, but led to unseemly\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the early eighteenth century, Paris was enlivened by the\r\nspectacle of the majestic Royal Opera, endeavouring by legal thunder\r\nto suppress the lively vaudeville performances of the too popular\r\nParis Fairs, and even going to the length of obtaining decrees\r\nforbidding the Fair theatres to perform musical plays in which words\r\nwere sung, were the managers of the little theatres downhearted?\r\n\r\nNo! they merely evaded the law and made a mockery of pompous\r\ninterference by having the music of their songs played, while the\r\nmeaning was acted in dumb-show, and--the actual words, printed very\r\nlarge, were displayed on a screen let down to the stage from above!\r\nTheir audiences, catching the spirit of the thing, enjoyed the wit of\r\nthe evasion and supported the performances all the more.\r\n\r\nThere are many people who can only relish that which they have been\r\ntold is wrong.\r\n\r\nMuch the same spirit was abroad about sixteen hundred years ago, when\r\nthe growing power of the Christian Church began to be a calculable\r\nfactor in “practical politics,” and the embarrassment of successive\r\nRoman emperors in trying to rule an unwieldy and decaying Empire was\r\nincreased by the moral warfare between the more rigid sects of the\r\nnew Church and the pleasures of the people.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be said in justice to the early Churchmen that\r\nmany of the pleasures of the people had become entirely scandalous,\r\nand detrimental to the manhood of the Empire, at least as seen in the\r\nEmpire’s capital. Over such let us draw a veil!\r\n\r\nWhile, in these “democratic” days, it may be doubted if there _are_\r\nany of the English-speaking race who “dearly love a lord” (though\r\nthere is really no reason why they should not!), there were certainly\r\nsome thousands of the Byzantine populace in the third and fourth\r\ncenturies to whom a successful circus-rider or gladiator, actor or\r\ndancer, was of far more interest than any peer of their period.\r\n\r\nThe histrionic favourites lacked, of course, the advantages of\r\npicture-postcard fame, and had to be content with immortality in\r\nverse. But as for the now hackneyed “stage romance” of the marriage\r\nof a youthful scion of a noble house with some resplendent star of\r\nthe theatrical firmament, did not a Byzantine Emperor, Justinian,\r\nmarry Theodora, once a popular dancer at the Hippodrome!\r\n\r\nYet he it was who made one of the more effective moves to suppress\r\nsome of his people’s excessive opportunities for amusement, by\r\nabolishing the laws under which the expense of the performances in\r\nthe Hippodrome, and some of the less important theatres had been\r\nmet by the Imperial treasury. This, however, was mainly due to his\r\nbeautiful wife, who had seen all the vilest side of theatrical life\r\nin a time when the older dramatic culture had given place to banal\r\nand vulgar entertainments involving a horrible servitude of those\r\nengaged in providing them.\r\n\r\nBefore this, however, the Church’s thunder had been launched at the\r\ngrosser theatrical spectacles, and the Theatre had retaliated by\r\nmocking the adherents of the then new religion. Where fulmination\r\nfailed, control by influence was essayed. But for all the attacks\r\nof the more advanced and severer leaders of the early Church, there\r\nmust have been something of confusion for at least the first five\r\ncenturies of the Christian era. Indeed, in the endeavour of the\r\nChurch to transmute the popular love of theatrical spectacles into\r\nsomething higher, and to awaken the public interest in the service of\r\nthe Church, what with the introduction of choral song, with strophe\r\nand antistrophe, and of solemn processionals, even it is said of\r\nceremonial dances performed by the choir--such as the Easter dances\r\nstill seen in Spain to-day--the Church itself must have come at\r\ntimes to seem perilously sympathetic towards the very things it was\r\nprofessing to condemn.\r\n\r\nDid not Gregory Nazianzen implore Julian, before he became “the\r\nApostate,” to be more discreet, saying in effect: “If you must dance,\r\nand if you must take part in these fêtes, for which you seem to\r\nhave such a passion, then dance, if you must; but _why_ revive the\r\ndissolute dances of the daughter of Herodias, and of the pagans?\r\nDance rather as King David did before the Ark; dance to the glory of\r\nGod. Such exercises of peace and of piety are worthy of an Emperor\r\nand a Christian.”\r\n\r\nIn short, wise cleric as he was, he found no fault with the healthy\r\nexercise of the dance itself, but only with such dance and other\r\nByzantine entertainment as had tended, or might tend, to become\r\nmerely an exhibition of depraved taste.\r\n\r\nIndeed, how could he have inveighed against the dance as an\r\nexpression of clean rejoicing when it had been recorded: “And\r\nMiriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her\r\nhand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels _and with\r\ndances_”?[1] Had not the servants of Achish said: “Is not this David\r\nthe king of the land? did not they _sing one to another of him in\r\ndances_, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten\r\nthousands?”[2] Had it not, too, been written: “And David danced\r\nbefore the Lord with all his might.”[3]\r\n\r\nNo, the Church thunder had been directed against the licence by which\r\nthe arts of dancing and miming had been corrupted, and against,\r\nnot wholesome athleticism and healthy sport, but the hysterical\r\nbrutalities and “professionalism” of the arena.\r\n\r\nAnd if further proof were required of ecclesiastical interest in\r\nand practice of the thing it only attacked when seen in degraded\r\nform, it is to be found in the fact that in 744, the Pope Zacharias\r\npromulgated a Bull suppressing all so-called “religious dances,” or\r\n“baladoires” as he called them, which were showing signs of becoming\r\n“degenerate.”\r\n\r\nThese were dances which were performed in, or within the precincts\r\nof cathedrals and churches at certain festivals such as Easter,\r\nMidsummer and Christmas; and of which the old English bonfire dances\r\nof St. John’s Eve, were (and the modern carnival, and the Eastertide\r\nceremonial seen in Seville to-day, _are_) probably survivals, though,\r\nto be sure, they should be accounted originally as survivals of\r\nearlier pagan dances in honour of the sun, and of the harvest, and\r\nnot as originating with the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a far cry from the date of Pope Zacharias’ edict of 744,\r\nto 1462, when the first of the _ballets ambulatoires_ is recorded,\r\nbut it must not be supposed that dancing, if not miming, is entirely\r\nlacking in history during those seven hundred odd years. Any history\r\nof dancing would aid us in at least partly bridging such a gap; but\r\nit will be convenient in a chapter dealing more especially with\r\nearly ecclesiastical influence on the evolution of Ballet, to deal\r\nnow with a form of entertainment or of religious festival which was\r\nessentially a creation of the earlier Church.\r\n\r\nThe famous procession of the Fête Dieu which King René d’Anjou,\r\nCount of Provence, established at Aix in 1462, was, as an old\r\nhistorian tells us, an “ambulatory” ballet, “composed of a number of\r\nallegorical scenes, called _entremets_.” This word _entremets_, which\r\nwas later replaced by “interludes,” designated a miming spectacle\r\nin which men and animals represented the action. Sometimes jugglers\r\nand mountebanks showed their tricks and danced to the sound of their\r\ninstruments. These entertainments were called _entremets_ because\r\nthey were instituted to occupy the guests agreeably at a great feast,\r\nduring the intervals between the courses. “The entre-actes of our\r\nfirst tragedies,” the writer adds, “were arranged in this manner,\r\nas one sees in the works of Baif, the interludes in the tragedy of\r\n_Sophonisbie_. More than five hundred mountebanks, Merry Andrews,\r\ncomedians and buffoons, exhibited their tricks and prowess at the\r\nfull Court which was held at Rimini to arm the knights and nobles of\r\nthe house of Malatesta and others.”\r\n\r\nAs the fêtes and tournaments, given on these occasions, were\r\naccompanied by acts of devotion, the festivals of the Church often\r\ndisplayed also something of the gallant pomp of the tournaments.\r\n\r\nThese _ballets ambulatoires_, however, with all their richer\r\npageantry, were yet to be outshone by the two secular entertainments\r\nto which we must devote our next chapter--the banquet-dance of\r\nBergonzio di Botta, of 1489, and the still more famous “Ballet\r\nComique de la Reine,” of 1581, the last of which, there can be little\r\ndoubt, had important effect in the development if not creation of\r\nour English masque, which, in turn, had an immense influence on the\r\nevolution of modern Ballet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BANQUET-BALL OF BERGONZIO DI BOTTA, 1489, AND THE FAMOUS “BALLET\r\nCOMIQUE DE LA REINE,” 1581\r\n\r\n\r\nA superb and ingenious festivity was that arranged by Bergonzio di\r\nBotta, a gentleman of Tortona, in honour of the wedding of Galeazzo,\r\nDuke of Milan, with Isabella of Aragon.\r\n\r\nThe good Bergonzio was a lover of all the best things of life, but\r\nespecially of dining and of dancing. That historic _gourmet_, Brillat\r\nSavarin, commends him for his taste in the former matter, as may\r\nwe for the bright idea of combining a dinner with a dance, one of\r\nsomewhat nobler plan than any modern example!\r\n\r\nThe dinner was of many courses and each was introduced by the servers\r\nand waiters with a dance in character, the whole constituting a\r\nsort of dinner-ballet. In the centre of a stately salon, which was\r\nsurrounded by a gallery where various musicians were distributed,\r\nthere was a large table.\r\n\r\nAs the Duke and his lady entered the salon by one door, from another\r\napproached Jason and the Argonauts who, stepping proudly forth to the\r\nsound of martial music and by dance and gestures expressing their\r\nadmiration of so handsome a bride and bridegroom, covered the table\r\nwith the Golden Fleece which they were carrying.\r\n\r\nThis group then gave place to Mercury who, in recitative, described\r\nthe cunning which he had used in stealing from Apollo, who guarded\r\nthe flocks of Admetus, a fat calf, with which he came to pay homage\r\nto the newly married pair. While he placed it on the table three\r\n“quadrilles” who followed him executed a graceful _entrée_.\r\n\r\nDiana and her nymphs then succeeded Mercury. The Goddess was followed\r\nby a kind of litter on which was a hart. This, she explained, was\r\nActæon, who, although no longer alive, was happy in that he was to be\r\noffered to so amiable and fair a nymph as Isabella of Aragon. At this\r\nmoment a melodious symphony attracted the attention of the guests.\r\nIt announced the singer of Thrace, who was seen playing on his lyre\r\nwhile chanting the praises of the young duchess.\r\n\r\n“I mourned,” he sang, “on Mount Apennine the death of tender\r\nEurydice. Now, hearing of the union of two lovers worthy to live for\r\none another, I have felt, for the first time since my sorrow, an\r\nimpulse of joy. My songs have changed with the feelings of my heart.\r\nA flock of birds has flown to hear my song. I offer them to the\r\nfairest princess on earth, since the charming Eurydice is no more.”\r\n\r\nA sudden clamour interrupted his song as Atalanta and Theseus,\r\nheading a nimble and brilliant troupe, represented by lively dances\r\nthe glories of the chase. The mimic hunt was terminated by the death\r\nof the wild boar of Calydon, which was offered to the young Duke,\r\nwith triumphal “ballets.”\r\n\r\nA magnificent spectacle then succeeded this picturesque entrance. On\r\none side was Iris, seated on a car drawn by peacocks and followed by\r\nseveral nymphs, covered in light gauze and carrying dishes of superb\r\nbirds. The youthful Hebe appeared on the other side, carrying the\r\nnectar which she poured for the gods. She was accompanied by Arcadian\r\nshepherds, laden with all kinds of food and by Vertumnus and Pomona\r\nwho offered all manner of fruits. At the same time the shade of that\r\nfamous _gourmet_ Apicius rose from the earth, presenting to this\r\nsuperb feast all the delicacies he had invented and which had given\r\nhim the reputation of the most voluptuous among ancient Romans. This\r\nspectacle disappeared and then there was a wondrous ballet of all\r\nthe gods of the sea and rivers of Lombardy; who carried the most\r\nexquisite fish and served them while executing dances of different\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary repast was followed by a yet more singular\r\nspectacle opened by Orpheus, who headed a procession of Hymen and a\r\ntroop of Loves, followed by the Graces who surrounded Conjugal Faith,\r\nwhom they presented to the Princess, while offering, themselves, to\r\nserve her.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Semiramis, Helen, Medea and Cleopatra interrupted\r\na recitative by Conjugal Faith to sing of the delights of Passion.\r\nThen a Vestal, indignant that the recital of pure and true marriages\r\nshould be sullied by such guilty songs, ordered the notorious queens\r\nto withdraw. At her voice, the Loves, who accompanied her, joined\r\nin a lively dance, pursuing the wicked queens with lighted torches\r\nand setting fire to the gauze veils of their headdress! Lucretia,\r\nPenelope, Thomiris, Porcia and Sulpicia replaced them and presented\r\nto the young Princess that palm for chastity which they had merited\r\nduring their lives. Their “modest and noble” dance, however, was\r\ninterrupted by Bacchus, with a troop of revellers who came to\r\ncelebrate so illustrious a bridal, and the festival terminated in a\r\nmanner as gay as it was ingenious.\r\n\r\nThe fête achieved a prodigious fame throughout Italy. It was the talk\r\nof every city and a full description of its glories was published,\r\nwhile crowds of “society hostesses” of the period endeavoured to\r\nemulate the ingenuity of its originators, and the vogue of the\r\ndinner-ballet “arrived.”\r\n\r\nOne effect of its fame was that for a century it set the fashion for\r\nthe Royal and Ducal Courts throughout Europe. Every Court had its\r\n“ballets,” in which lords and ladies of highest degree took part;\r\nand the movement was greatly fostered by Catherine de Medici, who\r\nsought to divert the attention of her son, Henry III, from political\r\naffairs towards the more congenial ways of social amusement, of which\r\nCourt-ballets formed considerable part.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of these sumptuous entertainments came, however, in\r\n1581, when in celebration of the betrothal of the Duc de Joyeuse and\r\nMarguerite of Lorraine, sister of the Queen of France, a spectacle\r\nwas arranged, the splendour of which had never been seen in the world\r\nbefore. This was Beaujoyeux’s famous “Ballet Comique de la Royne”--or\r\n_de la Reine_ in modern spelling--which set all cultured Europe\r\naglow with praise of its designer. A special account of it, with\r\nmany charming engravings, was printed by order of the King to send\r\nto foreign Courts. So much did it set a fashion that the elaborate\r\nmasked balls and the numerous Court-masques and entertainments which\r\nfollowed in the reigns of Henry VIII, Elizabeth and James were\r\ndirectly inspired by the success of Beaujoyeux’s ballet, even as they\r\nin turn influenced the subsequent productions of Louis XIV in France.\r\n\r\nThe author and designer was an Italian, by name Baltasarini, famous\r\nas a violinist. He was introduced by the Duc de Brissac to the notice\r\nof Catherine de Medici, who appointed him a _valet de chambre_, and\r\nsubsequently he became official organiser of the Court fêtes, ballets\r\nand concerts, assuming the name of Baltasar de Beaujoyeux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stage Effect in the 16th Century\r\n\r\n(_A Scene from the “Ballet Comique de la Royne,” by Baltasar de\r\nBeaujoyeux_, 1581).]\r\n\r\nThe account of the ballet was sumptuously published. The title-page\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BALET COMIQUE\r\n\r\n                         De la Royne, faict\r\n                         aux nopces de mon\r\n                         sieur le Duc de Ioyeuse &\r\n                         madamoyselle de Vau\r\n                         demont sa sœur.\r\n                                 par\r\n                         Baltasar de Beavioyevlx\r\n                           valet de chambre du\r\n                       Roy et de la Royne sa mère.\r\n                               à Paris\r\n                                 par\r\n          Adrian le Roy, Robert Ballard, et Mamert Patisson\r\n                         Imprimeurs du Roy.\r\n                              MDLXXXII\r\n                           Avec Privilege.\r\n\r\nAfter a courtly dedication “Au Roy de France, et de Pologne,” full of\r\npraise for his prowess in arms and his taste in art, full of graceful\r\ncompliment by classic implications, he follows with an address:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AU LECTEUR.\r\n\r\n  Povravtant, amy Lecteur, que le tiltre et inscription de ce livre\r\n  est sans example, et que lon n’a point veu par cy deuant aucun\r\n  Balet auoir esté imprimé, ny ce mot de Comique y estre adapté: ie\r\n  vous prieray ne trouver ny l’un ny l’autre estrange. Car quant au\r\n  Balet, encores que ci soit vne inuention moderne, ou pour le moins,\r\n  repétée si long de l’antiquité, que l’on la puisse nommer telle:\r\n  n’estant à la verité que des meslanges geometriques de plusieurs\r\n  personnes dansans ensemble sous vne diuerse harmonie de plusieurs\r\n  instruments: ie vous confesse que simplement representé par\r\n  l’impression, cela eust eu beaucoup de nouveauté, et peu de beauté,\r\n  de reciter vne simple Comedie: aussi cela n’eust pas esté ny bien\r\n  excellent, ny digne d’vne si grande Royne, qui vouloit faire\r\n  quelque chose de bien magnifique et triomphant. Sur ce ie me suis\r\n  advisé qu’il ne seroit point indecent de mesler l’un et l’autre\r\n  ensemblement, et diversifier la musique de poesie, et entrelacer\r\n  la poesie de musique et le plus souvent les côfrondre toutes deux\r\n  ensemble: ansi que l’antiquité ne recitoit point ses vers sans\r\n  musique, et Orphée ne sonnoit jamais sans vers, i’ay toutes fois\r\n  donné le premier tiltre et honneur à la danse, et le second à la\r\n  substâce, que i’ay inscrite Comique, plus pour la belle, tranquille\r\n  et heureuse conclusion, ou elle se termine, que pour la qualité\r\n  des personnages, qui sont presque tous dieux et déesses, ou autres\r\n  personnes heroiques. Ainsi i’ay animé et fait parler le Balet, et\r\n  chanter et resonner la Comedie: et y adjoustant plusieurs rares et\r\n  riches représentations et ornements, ie puis dise avoir contenté\r\n  en un corps bien proportionné, l’œil, l’oreille, et l’entendement.\r\n  Vous priant que la nouveauté, ou intitulation ne vous en face mal\r\n  juger; car estant l’invention principalement. Composée de ces deux\r\n  parties, ie ne pouvois tout attribuer au Balet, sans faite tout à\r\n  la Comedie, distinctement representée par ses scènes et actes: ny à\r\n  la Comedie sans prejudicier au Balet, qui honore, esgaye et rempli\r\n  d’harmonieux recits le beau sens de la Comedie. Ce que m’estant\r\n  bien advis vous avoir deu abondamment instruire de mon intention,\r\n  ie vous prie aussi ne vous effaroucher de ce nom et prendre le tout\r\n  en aussi bonne par, comme i’ay desire vous satisfaire pour mon\r\n  regard.\r\n\r\nAlthough the quaint spelling of the old French may offer a passing\r\ndifficulty to some readers, I have felt it advisable to give the\r\naddress as it stands, for it presents several points of extraordinary\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost is the fact that it claims Beaujoyeux’s ballet to\r\nbe the first ever printed!\r\n\r\nHis description of a ballet as “_meslanges geometriques de plusieurs\r\npersonnes dansans ensemble_” is extremely interesting. Pylades the\r\nLatin dancer-mime declared that no man could become a perfect\r\nmime who did not understand music, painting, sculpture _and_\r\ngeometry! And in recent years a well-known Italian _maître_ with\r\nwhom I was discussing Ballet remarked, as he held up a case of\r\ndrawing instruments, “Here is the whole art of choreography,” or\r\nballet-composition. This may seem a somewhat exaggerated assertion,\r\nbut it is a fact that without some knowledge of geometry it would\r\nbe difficult for a composer of Ballet to tell the effect that would\r\nbe produced by lines and groups of dancers in the sight of a huge\r\naudience all looking at the stage from different angles.\r\n\r\nBeaujoyeux’s claim to appeal to and satisfy “_l’œil, l’oreille, et\r\nl’entendement_” is also interesting, and quite in accord with modern\r\nideas of the Ballet.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment itself must have been a remarkable affair. It began\r\nwith a fine water display by a fountain with twelve sides, on each of\r\nwhich were two naiads, with musical instruments, for the “concert,”\r\nwhich accompanied the singers. Above the fountain-basin, which was\r\nfull of fish, rose another on pillars, where twelve niches made seats\r\nfor so many nymphs. In the middle, dolphins carried a crown and\r\nformed a throne for the Queen. Two other basins rose again above,\r\nformed of other dolphins grouped, which spouted great jets of water,\r\nand the whole was topped by a golden ball five feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nIt was from this “machine,” drawn by sea-horses and accompanied by\r\ntwelve tritons and as many sirens with their instruments, that there\r\ndescended the Queen, the Princesse de Lorraine, the Duchesses de\r\nMercueil, de Guise, de Nevers, d’Aumale and de Joyeuse, Marechal de\r\nRaiz, and de l’Archant and the Demoiselles de Pons, de Bourdeille\r\nand de Cypierre--who had all been seated in golden cars, and who\r\nwere dressed in silver cloth and crêpe encrusted with gold bullion\r\nand precious stones. Thus they made the first entrance, arranging\r\nthemselves in twelve different figures. At the first entrance they\r\nwere six abreast and three in front in a triangle, of which the Queen\r\nformed the first point.\r\n\r\nAfter this impressive opening the ballet meandered through the story\r\nof Circe, with musical interludes, songs and dances, and elaborate\r\nallegory. But as the first act began at ten in the evening and the\r\nlast did not finish till after five in the morning, it will be seen\r\nthat the production was as lengthy as it was magnificent. Some idea\r\nof the splendour of the fête, indeed, may be gathered from the\r\nfact that it cost something over three and a half million francs.\r\nThe conclusion was graceful. The Queen and the Princesses, who\r\nhad represented naiads and nereids, presented gold medals to the\r\nprinces and seigneurs who, in the guise of tritons, had danced with\r\nthem--presumably as a reward for their patience! This presentation of\r\ngifts became quite a custom at these courtly ballets, and doubtless\r\nthe modern _cotillon_ is a survival.\r\n\r\nThe “Ballet Comique” set a fashion throughout Europe, and various\r\nCourts vied with each other in similar entertainments. The English\r\nCourt had, of course, already had its ceremonial balls, masked balls\r\nand “masques,” but their splendour had been nothing to this, and the\r\nsubsequent fêtes at the Courts of Elizabeth and James were directly\r\ninfluenced by the example of the French in this direction, as we\r\nshall see when we come to deal with the English masque as a form of\r\nBallet.\r\n\r\nLet us first, however, consider the dances of the period, for which\r\nwe have an excellent authority in the work of Thoinot Arbeau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHOINOT ARBEAU’S “ORCHÉSOGRAPHIE,” 1588\r\n\r\n\r\n“In Spring,” we know, “the young man’s fancy lightly turns to\r\nthoughts of love.” In the winter of life it would seem that an\r\nold man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of the dances that his\r\ntime-stiffened limbs can no more achieve with their earlier agility\r\nand grace, and he takes to--writing about them. For it is strange\r\nbut true that some of the most entertaining volumes on the subject\r\nare those written on the history of the dance by “grave and reverend\r\nseigneurs”; who, one would imagine, had long foregone all thought of\r\nyouthful pastimes and turned their minds to solemner affairs. Three\r\nsuch, at least, I can recall--Thoinot Arbeau, Bonnet, and Baron.\r\n\r\nOver three centuries ago--nay, nearly four, we come upon a somewhat\r\nsage and elderly gentleman, Thoinot Arbeau, whose book with its\r\nstrange title, _Orchésographie_, was published in 1588.\r\n\r\nWas it shyness, or sheer fraud that made him write it under a false\r\nname, a _nom de théâtre_ it would almost seem. For Thoinot Arbeau\r\nwas _not_ his name, but a sort of anagram on his real one, which was\r\nJehan Tabourot. Moreover, he was sixty-seven when he wrote it, and\r\nwas a Canon of the Church! He was born at Dijon in 1519, and was the\r\nson of one Estienne Tabourot, a King’s Counsellor! Think of it--born\r\nfour hundred years ago, yet he speaks to our time, telling us, albeit\r\nin somewhat stiff and difficult French, of the dances that were in\r\nvogue in _his_ dancing days.\r\n\r\nAs to the strange title of his work, its meaning will of course be\r\napparent to all who know anything of the history of the subject,\r\nfor they will remember that the Greek word for the dance was\r\n_Orcheisthai_ (the _Orchestra_ being the floor-space where the\r\ndancers performed); and so Orchéso_graphie_ is merely a treatise on\r\nthe writing of dances; that is, the setting of them down in such form\r\nthat subsequent readers could study the dances therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe recording of the actual steps of dances has always been a\r\nproblem, and other leading masters in France (such as Beauchamps,\r\nPécourt, Feuillet) and in England (such as Weaver) had several more\r\nor less successful shots during the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies at inventing a sort of dance-shorthand.\r\n\r\nThe very first author to attempt such a thing with any real success\r\nwas apparently our friend Arbeau; for earlier works, such as that of\r\nCaroso, are very poor. Into the full details of his system, however,\r\nI do not propose to enter now, for the matter is somewhat technical.\r\nThe interest of Arbeau’s work, however, is by no means mainly\r\ntechnical.\r\n\r\nThe book, which was published at Lengres in 1588, is written in the\r\nform of a dialogue “by which everyone can easily learn and practise\r\nthe honest exercise of the dances,” to give the quaint phraseology of\r\nthe original, the two speakers being Arbeau the author, and Capriol,\r\na youth who some few years earlier had left Lengres to go to Paris\r\nand Orleans and now, on his return, has sought out Arbeau to learn\r\nfrom him all that he can of dancing. Thoinot at first does not\r\nrecognise him because, as he says, “You have grown so, and I believe\r\nthat you have also enlarged your spirit by virtue and knowledge.” He\r\nasks the young man’s opinion of the study of Law, remarking that he\r\nwas also once a law-student.\r\n\r\nCapriol expresses his admiration for the law as a necessary\r\ninstitution, but complains that his neglect of the polite arts, while\r\nin the company of the Orleans law-students, has made him dull and\r\nwooden. He says that his knowledge of fencing and tennis makes him an\r\nacceptable companion with other youths, but he fails as a dancer to\r\nplease the _demoiselles_, a point on which, it seems to him, depends\r\nthe whole reputation of a young man who contemplates marriage. Then\r\nfollows some sound advice, with curious details, from Arbeau, on the\r\nadvantages of dancing as a matrimonial agent, and he acclaims the art\r\nas one necessary to social welfare.\r\n\r\nCapriol agrees and expresses his disgust that the dance should have\r\nbeen so subject to bitter attacks, of which he quotes historic\r\ninstances. Arbeau neatly responds that, “For one who has blamed, an\r\ninfinity have esteemed and praised the art,” also following with\r\nquoted examples, saying, indeed, that “_Le S. prophete royal dauid\r\ndāça au deuāt de l’arche de Dieu_,” or, in other words, that “the\r\nholy prophet, King David, danced before the Ark of God.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of their conversation, Arbeau makes learned references\r\nto the derivation of the word “Dance,” mentioning others then in use\r\nthat were allied to it, such as _saulter_ (from the Latin _saltare_),\r\n_caroler_ (hence our “carols,” or songs which, originally,\r\naccompanied certain religious dances), _baler_, and _trepiner_,\r\nCapriol remembers that the ancients had three kinds of dances: the\r\nsedate _Emmeleia_, the gay _Kordax_, and the mixed _Sikinnis_, the\r\nfirst of which Arbeau likens (quite unhistorically) to the _pavanes_\r\nand _basse-dance_ of his own period; the second, to the _gaillardes_,\r\n_voltas_, _corantos_, _gavottes_ (note that--a reference to the\r\n_gavotte_ in 1588!) and _branles_ (or, as Elizabethan Englishmen\r\ncalled them, “brawls”); while the third, he declares, must have been\r\nsimilar to the _branles doubles_ and to “the dance which we call\r\n_bouffons_ or _matachins_.”\r\n\r\nThen, very wisely, he points out that most objections to dancing\r\nhave been provoked not by decent but by--objectionable dancing!\r\nAnd as Capriol hastily assures his austere but kindly teacher that\r\nhe wants none of _that_ sort, but that he is anxious to teach his\r\ntwelve-year-old sister what Arbeau is good enough to teach him, the\r\nold man proceeds on most polite and methodical lines.\r\n\r\nArbeau, truly remarking that rhythm is the basis of the dance, as it\r\nwas always of all military marching and evolutions, then goes on to\r\ngive a wonderful disquisition on that glorious instrument, the drum,\r\nand a masterly analysis of its rhythmic possibilities, both as an\r\ninspirer of soldiers on the march and as a stimulus to the dance.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s enthusiasm for an instrument that has never really\r\nreceived its due homage is truly fine, and he gives no less than\r\nseventy-six examples of drum-beat on a common-time basis. He follows\r\nthis with an exposition of fife-playing (with musical examples); his\r\nearnest plea for this study of drum (_tambour_) and fife being only\r\npreparatory to a study of the _basse-dances_, which were properly\r\naccompanied by both instruments.\r\n\r\nAs several of these dances of three centuries agone have been revived\r\nin our time, it is of interest to consider them in some detail, more\r\nespecially as they formed the choregraphic basis of all the ballets\r\nsubsequently for some two centuries. Arbeau informs us that most of\r\nwhat he calls the “recreative” dances (or as we might say “social,”\r\nas opposed to the more ceremonial affairs necessitating an orchestra)\r\nwere performed in his forebears’ time to the music of the flute and\r\nlittle drum.\r\n\r\nCapriol asks: “Tell me, what are these dances and how are they done?”\r\n\r\nTo which Arbeau replies that they danced, in his father’s days,\r\n“_pavanes_, _basse-dances_, _branles_ and _courantes_, which have\r\nbeen in use some forty or fifty years.”\r\n\r\nCapriol asks: “How did our fathers dance the _basse-dance_?”\r\n\r\nArbeau replied that they had two sorts, the one common and regular,\r\nthe other irregular, the former being danced to “_chansons\r\nrégulieres_,” and the latter to “_chansons irrégulieres_,” and\r\nproceeds to explain that, for the former songs, there were sixteen\r\nbars which were repeated, making thirty-two to commence with; then a\r\nmiddle part of sixteen bars; and a close of sixteen, repeated; making\r\neighty bars in all. If the air of the song was longer than this, the\r\n_basse-dance_ played on it was termed “irregular.” He then explains\r\nthat the _basse-dance_ proper was in three parts, the term being\r\nreally only applied to the first; the second being called “_retour de\r\nla basse-dance_,” and the third and last being termed “_tordion_.”\r\n\r\nThen comes the following:\r\n\r\n           “_Memoire des mouvements pour la basse-dance._\r\n\r\n                     R b ss d r d r b ss ddd r d\r\n                     r b ss d r b c.”\r\n\r\nNot unnaturally Capriol, who is for ever asking quite intelligent\r\nquestions, wants a translation of this cryptic-looking array of\r\nletters. It is better understood when one hears that “R” stands\r\nfor _reverence_, “b” for a _branle_, “ss” for _deux simples_, “d”\r\nfor a _double_ (or three “ddd” for three “doubles”); the small “r”\r\nstands for a _réprise_, and “c” for _congé_; all of which are terms\r\nunderstood by dancers of to-day.\r\n\r\nHe gives very careful directions not only for performing the\r\n“_reverence_,” the “_simple_,” the “_double_,” the “_réprise_,”\r\nand the “_congé_,” but for performing the various movements of the\r\n_basse-dance_, the _retour_, and the _tordion_; as, for instance,\r\nwhen he remarks that “You begin the dance of the _tordion_, which is\r\nin triple time, just like the _basse-dance_: but it is (to give his\r\nown words) _plus legiere and concitée_.”\r\n\r\nHe describes the _Pavane_ as “easy” to dance, and gives details of\r\nits performance, together with the music of that famous and lovely\r\nexample, “_Belle qui tiens ma vie captive_,” the words being given in\r\nfull, for four voices and _tambour_ accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe _Gaillarde_, he says, is so-called “_parce qu’il fault estre\r\ngaillard and dispos pour la dancer_,” and with much detail as to its\r\nperformance explains that while danced somewhat like the tordion the\r\nlatter is done “_plus doulcement and avec actions and gestes moings\r\nviolents_.”\r\n\r\nHe gives nearly a dozen musical examples for the _gaillarde_, one\r\ncalled “_La traditors my fa morire_”; another “_Anthoinette_”;\r\nanother, with the charming title “_Baisons nous belle_”; another,\r\n“_Si j’ayme ou non_.”\r\n\r\nCapriol, by the way, remarks _apropos_ after the second-named, that\r\n“At Orleans when we give _Aubades_ we always play on our lutes and\r\n_guiternes_ a _gaillarde_ called ‘_La Romanesque_,’” but that it\r\nseemed so hackneyed and trivial that he and his companions took to\r\n“_Anthoinette_” as being livelier and having a better rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe _Gaillarde_ was in triple time, and was made up of five steps\r\n(or four steps and a leap) and one “position”; the term _cinq pas_\r\nalso being alternatively applied to it, hence the Shakespearean\r\n“cinque-pace” and “sink-a-pace.”\r\n\r\nThe _Volte_, from which is derived the modern valse, was described\r\nby Arbeau as “a species of _gaillarde_ familiar to the Provençals,”\r\ndanced, like the _tordion_, in triple time, and consisting of two\r\nsteps and a leap. The _Volte_, or _Volta_, as it was as often called,\r\nwas popular in England, as was the _Gaillarde_, and references to\r\nit are found in Shakespeare (_Troilus and Cressida_) and in the one\r\nreally great work on the Dance in English literature, namely, Sir\r\nJohn Davies’ richly imaginative and finely musical poem, _Orchestra,\r\nor a Poeme on Daunciny_, which was published in 1596, only eight\r\nyears after Arbeau’s _Orchésographie_.\r\n\r\nThe _Courante_, Arbeau describes as very different from the _Volte_.\r\nIt is also (in contrast to the _Pavanes_ and _Basse-dances_) a _danse\r\nsautée_, but in twelve time, with running steps, requiring from time\r\nto time not the quick, light leaping of a _volte_, but the sort of\r\nslow soaring for which Vestris was famous in the eighteenth century\r\nand Volinin and Bohn can perform so superbly to-day.\r\n\r\nArbeau says that in his youth the dance was given as a kind of\r\n“ballet,” by three young men and three girls, with grace and dignity\r\nand he bewails its subsequent decadence. The old English term was\r\n“current traverse.” In Sir John Davies’ _Orchestra_ one finds the\r\nfollowing reference:\r\n\r\n             “What shall I name those currant travases\r\n              That on a triple _dactyl_ foot do run\r\n              Close by the ground in sliding passages?”\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare’s _Henry the Fifth_, too, is the following:\r\n\r\n      “_Bourbon_: They bid us to the English dancing-schools\r\n                  And teach _lavoltas_ high and swift _corantos_;”\r\n\r\nand Sir Toby Belch, it will be recalled, asks: “Why dost thou go to\r\nchurch in a _galliard_ and come home in a _coranto_? My very walk\r\nshould be a jig ... sink-a-pace.”\r\n\r\nThere seems, however, considerable ground for question as to what the\r\n_courante_, or _coranto_, really was, whether a slow or quick dance.\r\nArbeau’s directions are, for once, not quite clear. He speaks of it\r\nbeing a more graceful affair in his younger days; and he was an old\r\nman at the time his _Orchésographie_ was published. In England it\r\ncertainly seems to have become a fairly lively dance, of which the\r\nmain feature was its “running” steps.\r\n\r\nIn France that characteristic seems to have been the same though the\r\n_tempo_ may have been slower. Certainly it became slower there, for\r\nthe _courante_ under Louis Quatorze was considered a dull dance,\r\ndisappearing in favour of newer types requiring a more developed and\r\nquicker technique.\r\n\r\nHowever, dances alter in character, like everything else, in the\r\ncourse of time. The _waltz_ or _valse_ has considerably altered since\r\nit was first introduced into London drawing-rooms--and considered\r\nshocking!--in the first decade of the nineteenth century; and even\r\nto-day there is considerable difference between the _valse_ as danced\r\nby Swiss or German peasants, and as seen in the London ball-room.\r\nIt is probable that the _courante_ of Arbeau’s day was as varied in\r\nperformance as the tango of our later time.\r\n\r\nLet us return, however, to his description of other dances of the\r\nperiod. The _Allemande_, he explains, “_est une dance plaine de\r\nmediocre gravité, familiere aux Allemâds, et croy qu’elle soit de noz\r\nplus anciennes car nous sommes desendus des Allemandes_.” But his\r\nauthority for the latter statement he does _not_ give! It was danced\r\nby two or more people, in twelve time, and later was a very popular\r\ndance with Louis the Thirteenth.\r\n\r\nA lengthy description follows of the _Branle_, which is also\r\nsometimes spelt _Bransle_, and from which comes our English word\r\nBrawl, the meaning of which has sadly degenerated from its original\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nSaying that, “since you know how to dance the _Pavane_ and the\r\n_Basse-dance_, it will be easy for you to dance the _branles_,” he\r\nthen proceeds to give account of over a score, including two which\r\nseem later to have assumed a right to be considered as separate\r\ndances, namely, the _Triory de Bretagne_ (or simply, the Triory) and\r\nthe _Branle de la Haye_, sometimes called merely the Haye, Hay, or\r\nHey, which was an interlacing chain-dance.\r\n\r\nAmong the examples he gives is a _Branle d’Escosse_, of which he\r\nsays: “_Les branles d’Escosse estoient en vogue y a environ vingt\r\nans_,” and it is much like the customary Scotch reel. The _Branles\r\ndes Lavandières_, he explains, is so-called because the dancers\r\nmake a noise by clapping their hands to represent that made by\r\nthe washerwomen who wash their clothes on the banks of the Seine.\r\nAnother, the _Branle du Chandelier_, was danced with lighted candles.\r\n\r\nA description of the _Gavotte_ follows, and it is interesting to note\r\nthat this dance which is still seen on the stage sometimes to-day,\r\nwas an established favourite as far back as 1588. Then comes an\r\naccount of the “Morisque” dance, the origin of which Arbeau places\r\nin the Saturnalia of the ancient world, not without reason, one\r\nfancies; and then he gives account of the _Canaries_, which, he says,\r\n_some_ say takes its name from the Canary Isles, while others derive\r\nit “from a ballet composed for a masquerade in which the dancers\r\nwere dressed as kings and queens of Mauretania, or even as savages\r\ntherefrom, with headdress of varied plumage.” The last chapter is\r\ndevoted to the dance of Bouffons, a dance with sword and buckler\r\nsupposedly derived from ancient Rome and a never-failing source of\r\ndelight to French playgoers and opera-lovers of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nBefore the “Dialogue” actually closes, young Capriol politely\r\nthanks Monsieur Arbeau for the trouble he has taken to teach him\r\ndancing, and Arbeau responds by promising a second volume (alas!\r\nnever written) dealing with the ballets of the masquerades “made”\r\nat Lengres. He urges him meanwhile to practise “_les dances\r\nhonnestement_,” and so become a worthy comrade of the planets “_qui\r\ndancent naturellement_”: and he closes his discourse very prettily\r\nwith the words, “_Je prie Dieu vous en donne la grace_.”\r\n\r\nWe have lingered somewhat over this old manual of dancing, but there\r\nare some half-dozen points in the history of ballet that it is of\r\nvital importance to emphasise, and Arbeau’s book is one of them.\r\n\r\nDancing itself of course had continued to exist through all time.\r\nBut from the decadence of Rome until fairly late in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, ballet had only a precarious sporadic existence; and the\r\nproduction of Beaujoyeux’s volume of the _Ballet Comique de la Royne_\r\nin 1582, and Arbeau’s _Orchésographie_ in 1588, made a turning-point\r\nin the history of ballet--the _point where a popular amusement was\r\nonce again taken up by men of intellect and given a new form and\r\na new spirit_. Beaujoyeux created an interest in ballet, Arbeau\r\nassisted an advance in the technique of one of the chief elements of\r\nthe art, namely, dancing; and there can be little doubt that both men\r\nwere largely instrumental in forwarding that movement towards popular\r\ndelight in the theatrical masque and ballet which were to become an\r\noutstanding feature of the next two centuries, the seventeenth and\r\nthe eighteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSCENIC EFFECT: THE ENGLISH MASQUE AS BALLET\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering di Botta’s elaborate feast, and Beaujoyeux’s “ballet,”\r\none is struck by their similarity to the English “disguisings” and\r\nmasques, which, first introduced to the Court of Henry the Eighth in\r\n1512 as a novelty from Italy, only began to assume definite literary\r\nform about a century later. That century contributed towards the\r\ndevelopment of scenic effect.\r\n\r\nIn studying Arbeau’s manual of contemporary dance and music, one is\r\nstruck by another thing: he is dealing with a social amusement of\r\nthe upper classes. The dances he describes were mainly the proper\r\naccomplishment of the well born, or were such of lower origin as\r\nmight with adaptation become worthy of performance by more courtly\r\ndancers. It is certain he does not describe all the types of dance\r\nknown to his period. The old Provençal “_Rigaudon_” which was later\r\nto come into such favour owing to Camargo, is not referred to by\r\nArbeau; nor the languorous “_Sarabande_,” which was probably of\r\nMoorish origin derived through Spain--or possibly earlier through\r\nAugustan Rome; the lively “_Chaconne_” is another omission; the\r\n“_Tresca_” yet another. These, and perhaps others, must have existed\r\nin Arbeau’s time and long before; but would be among the traditional\r\namusements of the people, and were not yet elected to the company of\r\ncourtly dances.\r\n\r\nIt is needful to linger over these points here, for they account for\r\nmuch that we find in the subsequent development of theatrical ballets\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Beaujoyeux’s “_Ballet Comique_,” Castil Blaze, the\r\nscholarly historian of the Paris opera, remarks that it “became the\r\nmodel on which were composed a number of _ballets_, sung and danced,\r\na kind of piece which held the place of Opera among the French\r\nand English for about a century.” That century was, roughly, from\r\nabout 1500 to 1600. And he adds: “The English gave them the name of\r\n_masque_.”\r\n\r\nIn the few years after Henry VIII came to be crowned the young\r\nmonarch spent considerable time and spared no expense in entertaining\r\nhimself and his Queen with “disguisings,” “revels” and masqued balls.\r\n\r\nOn Twelfth Night, 1511, before the banquet in the Hall at Richmond,\r\nso records the contemporary chronicler, Edward Hall, there “was\r\na pageant devised like a mountain, glistering by night as though\r\nit had been all of gold and set with stones; on the top of which\r\nmountain was a tree of gold, the branches and boughs frysed with\r\ngold, spreading on every side over the mountain with roses and\r\npomegranates; the which mountain was with (de) vices brought up\r\ntowards the King, and out of the same came a lady apparelled in cloth\r\nof gold, and the children of honour, called the henchmen, which were\r\nfreshly disguised and danced a Morris before the King, and that done\r\nre-entered the mountain: and then was the wassail brought in and so\r\nbrake up Christmas.”\r\n\r\nThe next year the King himself took part in a similar pageant; and\r\nin the next, _i.e._ in 1513, so Hall tells us, “the King with eleven\r\nothers were disguised after the manner of Italy, called a Mask, a\r\n_thing not seen before in England_. They were apparelled in garments\r\nlong and broad, wrought with gold, with visors and caps of gold; and\r\nafter the banquet these masquers came in with six gentlemen disguised\r\nin silk, bearing staff-torches, and desired the ladies to dance.”\r\n\r\nA little later came the introduction of singing, and dialogue as well\r\nas dancing, some allegorical story forming the basis of the masque.\r\nIn Beaujoyeux’s “ballet” of 1582, we have all this. Up to then in\r\nEngland the masque made no great advance beyond those of Henry VIII’s\r\nearly years. In Beaujoyeux’s “ballet,” however, we have all that\r\n_had_ been, and more. We have dancing, singing, dialogue, elaborate\r\nscenic effect, all in illustration of a mythic and allegorical\r\nstory; and achieving a definiteness and grandeur of form hitherto\r\nunequalled, as well as publicity which made it famous throughout\r\nEurope. In some ways it was as much masque as “ballet,” and as much\r\nopera as masque. Actually it did stimulate the development of the\r\nMasque in England; and Opera in France.\r\n\r\nAt the English Courts of Henry VIII and Elizabeth, the masque\r\ndeveloped in the direction of scenic elaboration and splendour (with\r\n_music_) that made up for its literary shortcomings, at least in its\r\nearlier period.\r\n\r\nAt the French Courts of Henry IV and Louis XIII, what were known as\r\nOpera-ballets (later to be separated as opera and ballet) developed\r\na musical richness (_with_ scenic effect) that made up for similar\r\nliterary shortcomings. Yet again came another form in the _Comedie\r\nBallet_ of Molière.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of James I of England came the real efflorescence\r\nof the English masque, which under the hands of Ben Jonson was to\r\nbecome a fairly balanced harmony of the three arts--the poet’s, the\r\nmusician’s, and the painter-designer’s.\r\n\r\nIt must of course be understood that in both the masque and ballet\r\nthere was dancing; but at the period with which we are now dealing,\r\nnamely the last decade of the sixteenth and first few decades of\r\nthe seventeenth centuries, the technique of that art was--for\r\nstage purposes--comparatively so primitive as to make it almost a\r\nnegligible quantity. There was dancing of course--that of “henchmen”\r\nand men and boys who performed a Morris, or _bouffon-dances_;\r\nand that of courtier, Court-lady, or even, it might be, a Royal\r\npersonage, who would take part in the stately _Pavane_ or _Almain_,\r\nnow and then unbending sufficiently to dance a _Trenchmore_ (once\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s favourite) or _Canary_.\r\n\r\nBut it was all either an intrusion, alien to the general purport of\r\nthe production, or else vastly overshadowed by the chief design,\r\nwhich was to present, with the aid of “disguisings” and elaborate\r\n“machines,” a sort of living picture or series of living pictures,\r\nexpressing some mythological, allegorical episodes or complimentary\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim was splendid pageantry; something mainly to please\r\nthe eye; and secondarily to charm the ear; without making too great\r\nclaims upon the intellect.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading English masque writers during the period we are\r\nconsidering were George Gascoigne, Campion, Samuel Daniel, Dekker,\r\nChapman, William Browne, Beaumont and Fletcher and Jonson.\r\n\r\nIn France, at the Court of Henri Quatre, and under the direction of\r\nhis famous minister, the great and grave Sully--who himself took part\r\nin them--some eighty ballets were given between 1589 and 1610, apart\r\nfrom state balls and _bals masqués_.\r\n\r\nIn England among the more notable masques produced during about the\r\nsame period were the following:--\r\n\r\n  1585. The Masque of “Lovely London,” performed before the Lord\r\n        Mayor.\r\n\r\n  1589. A Masque planned by order of Queen Elizabeth in honour of\r\n        the wedding of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of\r\n        Denmark.\r\n\r\n  1594. A Masque before Queen Elizabeth at Whitehall.\r\n\r\n  1604. A Masque by Samuel Daniel, “The Twelve Goddesses,” arranged\r\n        by Queen Anne, Consort of James I, in honour of the Spanish\r\n        Ambassador, at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n  1605. “The Masque of Blackness,” by Ben Jonson (his first real\r\n        masque) given on Twelfth Night at Whitehall.\r\n\r\n  1606. Ben Jonson’s “Masque of Hymen,” for the marriage of Robert\r\n        Devereux, third Earl of Essex, with the Earl of Suffolk’s\r\n        younger daughter, Frances Howard.\r\n\r\n  1608. Ben Jonson’s “Masque of Beauty”--a sequel to the “Masque\r\n        of Blackness” at the request of the Queen Consort, who, with\r\n        the Ladies of the Court, took part in the performance. This\r\n        was followed in the same year by his “Hue and Cry after\r\n        Cupid,” given at Court on Shrove Tuesday, in celebration of\r\n        Lord Viscount Haddington’s marriage.\r\n\r\n  1609. Ben Jonson’s “Masque of Queens” at Whitehall on Twelfth\r\n        Night.\r\n\r\nAll these were elaborate productions; those of Jonson being indeed\r\nbeautiful. Their literary value has long been realised, and one sees\r\nin them some of his finest work. The introductory descriptions and\r\nthe stage-directions are singularly minute and careful, and, in their\r\nway, are quite as well worth study as the beauties of his strong and\r\nnoble verse.\r\n\r\nHe writes of scenes and costumes as if he loved them: as when, in\r\n“The Masque of Blackness,” he describes the Moon, “triumphant in a\r\nsilver throne.... Her garments white and silver, the dressing of her\r\nhead antique, and crowned with a luminary or sphere of light; which,\r\nstriking on the clouds, and brightened with silver, reflected, as\r\nnatural clouds do, the splendour of the moon. The heaven about her\r\nwas vaulted with blue silk, and set with stars of silver, which had\r\nin them their several lights burning.”\r\n\r\nAnd again: “The attire of the masquers was alike in all, without\r\ndifference: the colours azure and silver; but returned on the\r\ntop with a scroll and antique dressings of feathers, and jewels\r\ninterlaced with ropes of pearl. And for the front, ear, neck, and\r\nwrists the ornament was of the most choice and Orient pearl: best\r\nsetting off from the Black.”\r\n\r\nFor the scenery and mechanical effects or “machines” as they were\r\ncalled--there was Inigo Jones, the travelled artist-architect who\r\nhad seen many a masking in Italy; for the music there was Alfonso\r\nFerrabosco, son of the Italian composer, appointed music-master at\r\nthe Court of James I; and for _Maître de danse_, there were Thomas\r\nGiles and Hieronimus Herne.\r\n\r\nIt was a noble company who took part in the performances. In “The\r\nMasque of Blackness,” though there were only three speaking parts,\r\nOceanus, Niger and Æthiopia--the impersonators of which are not\r\nrecorded--there was no less a personage than Queen Anne herself,\r\nConsort of King James, who appeared as Euphoris, supported by the\r\nCountess of Bedford (Aglaia), Lady Herbert (Diaphane), the Countess\r\nof Derby (Eucampse), Lady Rich (Ocyte), Countess of Suffolk (Kathare)\r\nand other fair ladies of title.\r\n\r\nThe “Masque of Beauty,” a superb spectacle given at the Court some\r\nthree years later by express command of Her Majesty, had for speaking\r\nparts only three, namely those of Boreas--“_in a robe of russet and\r\nwhite mixed, full and bagged; his hair and beard rough and horrid;\r\nhis wings grey, and full of snow and icicles; his mantle borne from\r\nhim with wires and in several puffs_”; Januarius--“_in a throne of\r\nsilver; his robe of ash colour, long, fringed with silver; a white\r\nmantle; his wings white and his buskins_”; and Vulturnus--“_in a blue\r\ncoloured robe and mantle, puft as the former, but somewhat sweeter;\r\nhis face black, and on his head a red sun, showing he came from the\r\nEast_.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the entrance of Vulturnus, bringing--in reference to the\r\nformer “Masque of Blackness”--the good news of his discovery of a\r\nlost isle whereon the black but lovely daughters of Niger had been\r\nlanguishing in obscurity, there came a fine pageant.\r\n\r\n“Here,” as Jonson’s stage directions describe it, “a curtain was\r\ndrawn in which the night was painted, and the scene was discovered\r\nwhich (because the former was marine, and these, yet of necessity, to\r\ncome from the sea) I devised should be an island floating on a calm\r\nwater. In the midst thereof was a Seat of State, called the Throne\r\nof Beauty, erected; divided into eight squares, and distinguished\r\nby so many Ionic pilasters. In these squares, the sixteen masquers\r\nwere placed by couples; behind them in the centre of the throne\r\nwas a tralucent pillar, shining with several coloured lights, that\r\nreflected on their backs. From the top of which pillar went several\r\narches to the pilasters, in front, little Cupids in flying posture,\r\nwaving of wreaths and lights, bore up the cornice; over which were\r\neight figures, representing the elements of Beauty, which advanced\r\nupon the Ionic, and, being females, had the Corinthian order.”\r\n\r\nThey were: Splendour, Serenitas, Germinatio, Lætitia, Temperies,\r\nVenustas, Dignitas, and Perfectio. Minute description is given of\r\ntheir garments, but is too lengthy for inclusion here. The stage\r\ndirections then proceed:\r\n\r\n  “On the top of all the throne (as being made out of all these)\r\n  stood HARMONIA, a personage whose dressing had something of all\r\n  the others, and had her robe painted full of figures. Her head was\r\n  compassed with a crown of gold, having in it seven jewels equally\r\n  set. In her hand a lyra, whereon she rested.\r\n\r\n  “This was the ornament of the throne. The ascent to which,\r\n  consisting of six steps, was covered with a multitude of Cupids\r\n  (chosen out of the best and most ingenious youth in the kingdom,\r\n  noble and others) that were torch-bearers; and all armed with bows,\r\n  quivers, wings, and other ensigns of love. On the sides of the\r\n  throne were curious and elegant arbours appointed; and behind, in\r\n  the back part of the isle, a grove of grown trees laden with golden\r\n  fruit, which other little Cupids plucked, and threw at each other,\r\n  whilst on the ground, leverets picked up the bruised apples and\r\n  left them half eaten. The ground-plat of the whole was a subtle\r\n  indented maze; and in the two foremost angles were two fountains\r\n  that ran continually, the one Hebe’s and the other Hedone’s; in the\r\n  arbours were placed the musicians, who represented the shades of\r\n  the old poets, and were attired in a priest-like habit of crimson\r\n  and purple, with laurel garlands.\r\n\r\n  “The colours of the masques were varied; the one half in orange\r\n  tawny and silver; the other in sea-green and silver. The bodies of\r\n  short skirts on white and gold to both.\r\n\r\n  “The habit and dressing for the fashion was most curious, and so\r\n  exceeding in riches, as the throne whereon they lay seemed to be a\r\n  mine of light, struck from their jewels and their garments.\r\n\r\n  “This throne, as the whole island moved forward on the water,\r\n  had a circular motion of its own, imitating that which we call\r\n  _motum mundi_, from the east to the west, or the right to the left\r\n  side.... The steps whereon the Cupids sat had a motion contrary,\r\n  with analogy _ad motum planetarum_, from the west to the east;\r\n  both which turned with their several lights. And with these three\r\n  varied motions, at once, the whole scene shot itself to the land.”\r\n\r\nAfter a chorus with echoing refrain, “Vulturnus the wind spake to the\r\nriver Thamesis, that lay along between the shores, leaning upon his\r\nurn, that flowed with water, and crowned with flowers; with a blue\r\ncloth of silver robe about him; and was personated by Master Thomas\r\nGiles, who made the dances.\r\n\r\n      “_Vul._ Rise, Aged Thames, and by the hand\r\n              Receive the nymphs, within the land,\r\n              And in those curious squares and rounds\r\n              Wherewith thou flow’st betwixt the grounds\r\n              Of fruitful Kent and Essex fair\r\n              That lends the garlands for thy hair;\r\n              Instruct their silver feet to tread,\r\n              Whilst we, again, to sea are fled.\r\n\r\n  “With which the Winds departed; and the river received them into\r\n  the land, by couples and fours, their Cupids coming before them.\r\n\r\n  “These dancing forth a most curious dance, full of excellent device\r\n  and change, ended it in the figure of a diamond, and so, standing\r\n  still, were by the musicians with a second SONG, sung by a loud\r\n  tenor, celebrated.\r\n\r\n            “So Beauty on the waters stood,\r\n             When Love had severed earth from flood!\r\n             So when he parted air from fire,\r\n             He did with concord all inspire!\r\n             And then a motion he them taught,\r\n             The elder than himself was thought.\r\n             Which thought was, yet, the child of earth,\r\n             For Love is elder than his birth.\r\n\r\n  “_The song ended; they danced forth their second dance, more subtle\r\n  and full of change than the former; and so exquisitely performed,\r\n  as the king’s majesty (incited first by his own liking to that\r\n  which all others there present wished) required them both again\r\n  after some time of dancing with the lords. Which time, to give them\r\n  respite, was intermitted with a song._\r\n\r\n  “This song was followed by others.\r\n\r\n  “_After which songs they danced galliards and corantos; and with\r\n  those excellent graces, that the music appointed to celebrate them,\r\n  showed it could be silent no longer; but, by the first tenor,\r\n  admired them thus_:\r\n\r\n                               “SONG.\r\n\r\n             “Had those that dwelt in error foul,\r\n              And held that women have no soul,\r\n              But seen these move; they would have then\r\n              Said, women were the souls of men;\r\n              So they do move each heart and eye\r\n              With the world’s soul, true harmony.\r\n\r\n  “_Here they danced a third most elegant and curious dance, and not\r\n  to be described again by any art but that of their own footing,\r\n  which ending in the figure that was to produce the fourth_, JANUARY\r\n  _from his state saluted them thus_:\r\n\r\n      “_Janu._ Your Grace is great, as is your Beauty, dames;\r\n            Enough my feasts have proved your thankful flames\r\n            Now use your seat; that seat which was, before,\r\n            Though straying, uncertain, floating to each shore,\r\n            And to whose having every clime laid claim,\r\n            Each land and nation urgéd as the aim\r\n            Of their ambition, Beauty’s perfect throne,\r\n            Now made peculiar to this place alone;\r\n            And that by impulsion of your destinies,\r\n            And his attractive beams that lights these skies;\r\n            Who, though with ocean compassed, never wets\r\n            His hair therein, nor wears a beam that sets.\r\n                Long may his light adorn these happy rites,\r\n            As I renew them; and your gracious sights\r\n            Enjoy that happiness, even to envy, as when\r\n            Beauty, at large, brake forth and conquered men!\r\n\r\n  “_At which they danced their last dance into their throne again._”\r\n\r\nThese quotations, though necessarily brief, illustrate the\r\ncharacteristic elements in the construction of the masque--dancing,\r\nmusic, song, spoken verse and _elaborate scenic effect_.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Thomas Giles, “who made the dances,” to the dances\r\nthemselves, “_galliards and corantos_,” and that charming admission\r\nas to “a third most elegant and curious dance” not to be described\r\nagain “by any art but that of their own footing”; the reference to\r\nthe arbours in which “were placed the musicians, who represented\r\nthe shades of the old poets, and were attired in a priest-like\r\nhabit of crimson and purple, with laurel garlands”; the song of\r\nthe “first tenor”--“Had those that dwelt ...” and January’s speech\r\napostrophising women’s beauty; above all the loving descriptions of\r\nthe scenery and mechanical effects, must all be of uncommon interest\r\nto those who know anything of the history of the French ballet,\r\nbecause it is so closely paralleled in the descriptions given some\r\nseventy years later by the Abbé Menestrier of the entertainments\r\nat the Court of Louis XIV. The English “masques” of the early\r\nseventeenth were, in effect, the French “ballets” of the early\r\neighteenth century. To return, however, to the English Court of James\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe Queen and Ladies of her Court once again took part in the\r\nentertainment of His Majesty as representatives of the various types\r\nof Beauty introduced in the course of the masque, and yet again were\r\nthey found in the noble “Masque of Queens,” celebrated from the House\r\nof Fame, by the Queen of Great Britain with her Ladies, at Whitehall,\r\nFebruary 2nd, 1609, which was dedicated to the young Prince Henry, as\r\nto the origin of which Ben gives the following interesting note: “It\r\nincreasing,” he says, “to the third time of my being used in these\r\nservices to Her Majesty’s personal presentations, with the ladies\r\nwhom she pleaseth to honour; it was my first and special regard, to\r\nsee to the dignity of their persons. For which reason I chose the\r\nargument to be _A celebration of honourable and true Fame bred out of\r\nVirtue_.”\r\n\r\nAll of which in a sense foreshadowed the various symbolic ballets\r\nlater at the Court of France, such as _La Verité, ennemie des\r\napparences_, which we shall come to consider in due course. The thing\r\nto realise now is that these masques of Ben Jonson and of other men\r\nof his period were the finest flowering of a form of entertainment\r\nwhich had been struggling for definite shape throughout the previous\r\ncentury, indeed from the days of di Botta’s fête in 1489, and had\r\nreceived its most recent and most effective stimulus from France\r\nin the production of Beaujoyeux’s wondrous symbolic and mythologic\r\n“ballet” some twenty odd years before Ben Jonson’s first “masque”\r\nwas produced. The English masque--partly dramatic “interlude” with\r\nsong, music and dance introduced, was in effect a ballet, and was a\r\ndirect influence in the formation of the “opera-ballets” which were\r\nsubsequently to be the delight of the French Court for a century or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBALLET ON THE MOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the masque was a kind of ballet that did not move from its\r\nappointed place within sight of the Royal and Courtly audience, by\r\nwhom it was commanded as a spectacle for private entertainment, there\r\nwas a “ballet” which did, and became, like the “carrousels” and\r\n“triumphs,” a very public spectacle, namely the _ballet-ambulatoire_,\r\nor peripatetic “ballet,” said to have originated among the\r\nPortuguese, and much encouraged by the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Beatification of Ignatius Loyola in 1609 is an instance of\r\nperipatetic “ballet” famous in the history of the dance.\r\n\r\nInteresting account of it is given by the invaluable Menestrier, who\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n“As the Jesuits had a war-like character, they chose the Siege of\r\nTroy for the subject of their ballet. The first act took place\r\nbefore the church of Notre Dame de Lorette. It was there they stood\r\nthe wooden horse. Full of Jesuits, the machine began to move, while\r\nnumerous dancers acted the most remarkable feats of arms of Achilles,\r\nAjax, Hector and Æneas. The monstrous horse and its retinue advanced,\r\npreceded by a brilliant orchestra. They arrived at the Place St.\r\nRoch, where the Jesuits had their church. The city of Troy, or\r\nat least a part of its towers and ramparts, constructed of wood,\r\noccupied a third of this place. A piece of wall was broken down, to\r\ngive entrance to the horse, the Greeks descended from the machine and\r\nthe Trojans attacked them with guns. The enemy defended with the\r\nsame arms, and the two sides fought--while dancing! Eighteen great\r\nstaves filled with fireworks caused the burning and the ruin of Troy!”\r\n\r\nOne might be puzzled to know how the author of such a drama would\r\nintroduce Saint Ignatius Loyola on the scene. The maker of the\r\n“book,” however, had no qualms, and, leaving the Greeks and Trojans\r\nburied beneath the ruins of Ilium, on the following day, he led\r\nthe spectators to the seashore. “Four brigantines,” the chronicler\r\nproceeds, “richly decorated and fenced, painted and gilded, covered\r\nwith dancers and ‘choirs of music,’ present themselves at the Port.\r\nThey bring four ambassadors, who, in the name of the four quarters\r\nof the globe, come to swear homage and fidelity, to offer presents\r\nto the newly beatified, to thank him for his benefits and to beg his\r\nprotection for the future. All the artillery of the Forts and of the\r\nvessels salute the brigantines on their entrance. The ambassadors\r\nthen mount the cars in waiting and advance towards the College of\r\nthe reverend fathers, with an escort of three hundred Jesuits on\r\nhorseback, dressed as Greeks! Four troops of inhabitants of the four\r\nquarters of the world, dressed in national costumes, dance round\r\nthe cars. The realms, the provinces, represented by their _genii\r\nloci_, march before their ambassador. The troop from America is the\r\nfirst, and among the dancers are many children disguised as monkeys\r\nand parrots, and twelve dwarfs, mounted on little nags. The car of\r\nAsia is drawn by two elephants. Six superb horses form the team of\r\nthe others.” The diversity, the richness of the costumes was not the\r\nleast ornament of this singular ballet, for it is said that several\r\nof the actors had on their garments precious stones of great value.\r\n\r\nIt is the Portuguese who claim to have invented the true ambulatory\r\nballets, which--designed in imitation of the Thyrennian “pomp”\r\ndescribed by Appius Alexander--were danced in the streets of a town\r\nproceeding from place to place, with movable stages and properties.\r\nThe performances were given on saints’ days and with the greatest\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1610 Pope Paul V. canonised Cardinal St. Charles\r\nBorromée, who, under the pontificate of Pius IV., his uncle, was\r\npatron of the kingdom of Portugal, and that grateful nation wished to\r\nhonour him publicly.\r\n\r\nIn order that it should be done with the greater solemnity, they put\r\nhis image on board a ship, as if he were coming back once more to\r\nassume the protection of the kingdom of Portugal.\r\n\r\n“A richly decorated vessel with flying sails of divers colours and\r\nsilk cordage of magnificent hues, carried the image of the saint\r\nunder a canopy of gold brocade. On its appearance in the roads all\r\nthe vessels in port, superbly arrayed, advanced to meet it, and\r\nrendering military honours, brought it back with great pomp, and\r\na salute from the guns of Lisbon and all the vessels in Port. The\r\nreliquaries of the patron Saints of Portugal, carried by the nobles\r\nof state and followed by the religious, civil and military bodies,\r\nreceived the new Saint on disembarcation.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the image was landed, it was received by all the monks\r\nand the whole of the ecclesiastical body, who went to meet it in\r\nprocession with four large chariots containing different tableaux.\r\nThe first car represented Fame, the second the town of Milan, the\r\nthird Portugal, and the fourth the Church. Besides the chariots, each\r\ncompany of monks and each Brotherhood carried its own particular\r\nSaint on rich litters, called by the Portuguese “andarillas.” The\r\nimage of St. Charles was ornamented with precious stones to the value\r\nof twenty-six to twenty-seven thousand crowns; several others to the\r\nvalue of sixty, seventy and eighty thousand crowns, and the jewels\r\nthat were displayed at this fête were estimated at more than four\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nBetween each chariot were troops of dancers, who represented,\r\nin dancing, the more notable of the acts of the Saints. Octavio\r\nAccoromboni, Bishop of Fossombrone, who obtained these honours\r\nfor St. Charles, was at this time in the town of Lisbon, where he\r\nhad gone to collect certain monies that Portugal was giving to\r\nthe Pope. He has left us a description of this fête, in which he\r\nremarks that “the Italians and more especially the Romans, should\r\nnot be surprised to read that dances and ballets formed a part of so\r\nsacred a ceremony, because in Portugal processions and fêtes would\r\nnot seem elevated nor serious enough unless accompanied by these\r\nmanifestations of joy.”\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare for these fêtes, dances, ballets and processions,\r\nthe Lisbon folk had decorated, several days beforehand, big masts\r\nerected at the doors of the churches where the service was to be\r\nheld, and at different places on the roads where the processions and\r\nperformances would pass. “These masts were of pine, gilded and decked\r\nwith crowns, streamers and banners of different colours, similar to\r\nthe masts put up in France at the doors of the magistrates’ houses on\r\nthe first of May in several towns of the kingdom, a custom which has\r\ngiven to these masts the name of ‘Maypole.’ The Spaniards call them\r\n‘Mayos,’ or ‘_Arboles de Enamorados_’ (Lovers’ trees) because young\r\nmen plant them on the first of May at the door of their mistresses’\r\nhouses.” The procession passed through triumphant arches, and the\r\nstreets were hung with tapestries and strewn with flowers.\r\n\r\nThree masts were planted at the places of the actual performance, one\r\nat the spot at the port where the procession was to start after the\r\nlanding of the image of St. Charles, another in the middle of the\r\nroute, and the third at the door of the church where the procession\r\nwas to end, and where the image of the saint was to be placed. These\r\nmasts marked the places for the performances, for it was there the\r\nprocession stopped, and the dancers made their chief entrances in the\r\n“ballet.” Needless to say immense sums were spent on the fête.\r\n\r\nThese are but two instances of the _ballet-ambulatoire_. More might\r\nbe given, but these will suffice to afford some idea of a type of\r\nspectacle which the older historians speak of as a “ballet,” but\r\nwhich is of special interest to us by reason of the contrast it forms\r\nto the masque, which was the reverse of “ambulatory,” and from the\r\nfact that though in direct contrast on another score, namely, that it\r\nwas not a private but a public spectacle, it was under the “immediate\r\npatronage” of the Church!\r\n\r\nNeither the masque nor the _ballet-ambulatoire_, was yet a theatrical\r\nentertainment; but it is curious, is it not, to note that they had\r\na certain kinship with theatrical tradition, for these magnificent\r\nperipatetic “ballets” of the ecclesiastics had had a primitive\r\nforerunner in the performance of Thespis with his travelling car in\r\nGrecian towns and villages some six centuries before the Christian\r\nera! Even as, later, we in fourteenth-century England had our Mystery\r\nand Miracle plays travelling from “station” to “station” in similar\r\nfashion, and our “mummers” or mimers; while, on the other hand, the\r\nmasque itself, as a private entertainment of the English Court, with\r\nits stage, and “machines,” scenery, dancing, music and song, not to\r\nmention its Royal and Courtly audience, was forerunner of similar\r\nentertainments which a century later were to become the features of\r\nthe Courts of Louis XIV and XV, and from that to develop under Royal\r\nPatronage into the Ballet of the Theatre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCOURT BALLETS ABROAD: 1609-1650\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the English Court was enjoying its masques, during the reigns\r\nof Henry VIII, Elizabeth and James, and the French were labouring\r\nforth their heroic ballets under Henri Quatre--more than eighty\r\nhaving been given from 1589 to 1610, without counting insignificant\r\nballs and masquerades--Italy was similarly keeping up in the movement\r\nwhich her example had originally inspired.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom there to celebrate the birthday of the Princess by\r\nan annual public fête. As one old historian records, the more usual\r\nspectacles of these celebrations were in the form of “Carrousels,\r\nTournois, des Comedies, des Actions en Musique, des Festins, des Feux\r\nd’Artifice, des Mascarades quand ces Fêtes se trouvent au temps du\r\nCarnaval, des Presens, des Illuminations, des Chasses, des Courses\r\nsur la Neige et sur la Glace suivant la saison, des Promenades et des\r\nJeux sur les Eaux.”\r\n\r\nThe Court of Savoy was particularly devoted to such entertainments.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 there was a _ballet d’armes_, entitled, “_Il Sol nascente\r\nnell’ oscurità dell Tile_,” danced by the “Serene” Princes of Savoy,\r\nthe occasion being the anniversary of the birth of their Royal\r\nfather, the Duke Charles Emannuel.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1611, the Prince of Piedmont gave a fête in honour to his\r\nfather’s birthday, representing “The Taking of the Isle of Cyprus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stage Effect in the 17th Century\r\n\r\n(_From a coloured engraving of a scene from “Circe_,” 1694).]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1615 was produced a mounted ballet at this same Court\r\n(Savoy) for the arrival of the Prince d’Urbin. This was an attack\r\nand a combat to music against three hundred men on foot, who formed\r\ndifferent companies of various shapes, lunated, oval, square and\r\ntriangular. They had drilled their horses so well that they were\r\nnever out of step with the rhythm of the music. There were numerous\r\ncars drawn by lions, stags, elephants, rhinoceroses, etc., and as\r\nthey represented the triumph of Love over War, the Four Quarters\r\nof the World followed the cars of the victors mounted in as many\r\nchariots. The Car of Europe was drawn by horses, that of Africa by\r\nelephants, that of Asia by camels, that of America by “unicorns”! The\r\ncars of this festival had engraved work on them by Callot.\r\n\r\nIn 1618, “The Elements,” a grand ballet and tourney was represented\r\nby the Duke of Savoy and his son, the Prince of Piedmont, on the\r\nformer’s birthday.\r\n\r\n“The Temples of Peace and War on Mount Parnassus,” a ballet and\r\ntourney “avec un Festin à la Chinoise,” formed the entertainment of\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\n“The Judgment of Flora on the Dispute of the Nymphs over the Crown of\r\nFlowers presented to Mme. Royale on her Birthday,” is the long and\r\nstately title of a fête given at Turin in 1620.\r\n\r\n“The Tribute of the Divinities of the Sky, Air, Sea and Infernal\r\nregions,” was a grand ballet and tourney of 1621. “The Ballet of the\r\nSeven Kings of China” was another.\r\n\r\n“The Joy of Heaven and Earth,” a fête in honour of the Duke’s\r\nbirthday in 1624, was followed by “Bacchus triomphant des Indes, avec\r\nune Action en Musique et une Chasse Pastorale,” in the same year.\r\nThis was a fête in honour of the Duke Charles Emmanuel’s birthday,\r\nand was performed by the pages of the Prince Cardinal Maurice of\r\nSavoy, at Rome on January 22nd, 1624.\r\n\r\n“Mount Parnassus and the Muses,” “The Quarrel of the Defenders and\r\nthe Enemies of the Muses,” took place in February, 1624. “Cadmus,\r\nvictorieux du Serpent,” and “Prometheus” were notable ballets in 1627.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable, and, according to contemporaries,\r\nbeautiful mounted ballets ever composed was that of “Æolus, King\r\nof the Winds,” which Alfonso Ruggieri Sansoverino presented at the\r\nwedding of the Prince of Tuscany in the year 1628 in the St. Croix\r\nSquare, in Florence. On one of the sides of this square was a large\r\nreef with a cave hollowed out of its rock and closed by a great door\r\nsecured with padlocks.\r\n\r\nDon Anthony de Medici, who took the part of master of the combat,\r\nhaving reconnoitred the course, Æolus, King of the Winds, entered,\r\naccompanied by twelve watermen to whom he “had taught the use of\r\nsails and the nature of the winds.” Twelve Tritons walked before him\r\nblowing their trumpets. Eight Sirens replied on other instruments,\r\naccompanied by Hoar-frost. Eight pages represented the many effects\r\nof the Winds, causing cold, hot, damp, dry, clear, dull, serene or\r\ncloudy weather.\r\n\r\nThe two sponsors walked behind their pages. The chariot of the Ocean\r\nfollowed, drawn by two big whales. It represented a rock covered\r\nwith seaweed, coral and different kinds of shells. Nymphs of the\r\nsea, rivers and springs were seated on this rock, and gave a musical\r\nconcert with wind instruments presided over by Dolopea, wife of\r\nÆolus. Æolus, having passed in his chariot and arrived in front of\r\nthe Prince’s box, saluted the bride, and after offering her his\r\nkingdom and all his troops, took a lance in his hand; then, suddenly\r\ndeparting, went and thrust against the door of the Cave of the Winds.\r\nThe padlocks broke, and the door being opened, thirty-two mounted men\r\nand a hundred and twenty-eight on foot were set at liberty. The men,\r\nrushing like the winds they represented, ran to the other side of\r\nthe square. Here Æolus stopped them and gave them orders to arrange\r\nthemselves into a triangular figure. He led them in this order to\r\nsalute the Princess for whom the fête was arranged. After having\r\ntaken their places, they began to manœuvre their horses in a ring on\r\nthe right; they went in single file to make a chain, and sixteen of\r\nthem having broken it, they formed a smaller one, from which eight\r\nmore detached themselves, making a still smaller one. The first\r\nhorsemen, curveting, manœuvred their horses to perform voltes and\r\nhalf-voltes, joining again without a halt, and, forming twos, fours\r\nand eights, “they mingled capers at the galop, with caracolling in\r\nfigures, performing a marvellous labyrinth with their intertwinings\r\nand evolutions.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1628, the students of the College at Rheims danced a\r\nballet in joyful commemoration of the taking of La Rochelle, the\r\ndesign of which, after ancient Roman models, was “The Conquest of the\r\nCar of Glory by the great Theander.”\r\n\r\nUnlike modern musical comedy, or “revue,” there purported to be a\r\nplot. The Giants of the Black Tower, trusting in the might of their\r\nmagic, published a challenge “full of empty pride,” by which they\r\nsummoned all Knights-errant to the conquest of the Car of Glory.\r\n\r\nLindamor, wishing to chastise the insolence of these fiends, arranges\r\nwith three of his friends to go and fight them. The Black Tower is\r\nfull of sorceries, and there was no means of opening it, except by\r\nthe sounding of an enchanted horn which the Giants had fastened to\r\nthe Gate. Lindamor sounds it; the Giants issue forth upon him and his\r\ncomrades, and the contest being unequal, Lindamor is compelled to\r\nwithdraw and to leave his comrades in the hands of the Giants, who\r\nload them with chains, and fasten them to the Castle Gate to serve as\r\na trophy to their vanity.\r\n\r\nSome country shepherds who had seen the adventure of Lindamor and\r\nthe Giants, persuade Caspis to take a part in favour of these\r\nunhappy knights. This shepherd, who was above the power of all\r\nmagic, presents himself before the captives, and first of all breaks\r\ntheir chains and sets them at liberty. Lindamor, well pleased at the\r\ncourtesy of Caspis, discusses with him the means of avenging himself\r\non the Giants of the Black Tower. He learns from this shepherd that\r\nthe sword of Cloridan is necessary for this enterprise, and that, in\r\norder to get it, it is necessary to put to sleep the Dragon to whom\r\nthe Giants have given the charge of it. The shepherd offers, himself,\r\nto do this and succeeds. But to get the sword of Cloridan something\r\nmore was wanted than to put the Dragon to sleep. The shepherd evokes\r\nthe shade of Cloridan to find out from him what must be done to make\r\nuse of this sword successfully.\r\n\r\nThe shade when called forth, informs him that Theander alone is\r\ncapable of using it. The rumour of this oracular response having got\r\nabroad, Vulcan with his Cyclops prepares arms for Theander, who being\r\npreceded by Renown and followed by Lindamor, reaches the place where\r\nthe sword of Cloridan is guarded, seizes the sword, after having\r\nchained the Dragon, presents himself with it at the gate of the Black\r\nTower, causes the gate to open at the sound of the horn, defeats the\r\nGiants, draws from the Tower the Car of Glory, harnesses the Giants\r\nto it and triumphs finally over the arms and the enchantments of his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe story, which smacks of some mediæval romance of Chivalry, was\r\nreally allegorical of the capture of La Rochelle. The late king was\r\nTheander; the shepherd Caspis was the Cardinal Richelieu, his prime\r\nminister; Lindamor, the King, Henry III, who, being as yet only Duc\r\nd’Anjou, had attempted this siege in vain. The sword of Cloridan was\r\nthat of Clovis; the Black Tower was La Rochelle; and the magic charms\r\nwere Heresy and Rebellion.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the year 1628, a ballet of “The Court of the Sun,” by an\r\nAbbé Scotto, was danced at the Court of Savoy. Night played the\r\noverture, and at her command spirits and goblins made a “pleasing”\r\nentrance, coming on from different directions. Night, however,\r\nwarning them to be careful that Day did not surprise them, they\r\nretired into their caves, when the Morning Star introduced visions\r\nof the Morning, bright Dreams issuing from the ivory gate. The Star\r\nof Venus rose from the sea to announce the arrival of the loveliest\r\nAurora ever seen, and ordered the Zephyrs to rise and to strew\r\nflowers, the Dew to sprinkle perfumed water and the sweetest and most\r\nhealthful influences.\r\n\r\nAurora followed them, and having descended from Heaven, suddenly\r\ncaused the Palace of the Sun (in Ionic architecture) to appear; the\r\nseven Planets and the twelve Hours were seen in niches, from which\r\nthey emerged to dance; the Muses in other niches performed concerted\r\nmovements, Time, the Year, the Seasons, the Months and the Weeks\r\nproviding the music in the boxes of this palace.\r\n\r\nFrom the last examples, it is seen that philosophic, poetical and\r\nclassic allegories were often used as the basis of ballets. The\r\nphilosophic were “those in which causes and effects, peculiar\r\nqualities and the origin of things, were expressed in a suitable\r\nstory by the devices of the ballet.” Several ballets of this kind\r\nwere seen at the theatre of the College of Clermont, principally,\r\nthose of “Curiosity,” “Dreams,” “Comets,” “Illusion,” “The Empire of\r\nthe Sun,” “Fashion.” In that of “Curiosity” it was desired to show\r\nthat the good or bad use made of it contributes to the perfecting or\r\nspoiling of the mind. Curiosity was represented by four characters,\r\neach forming a part of the ballet. The first of these was Useless\r\nCuriosity, which occupies itself only with trifles; the second,\r\nDangerous Curiosity, which seeks forbidden and harmful things, and it\r\nwas shown that these are the two kinds of curiosity to be avoided!\r\n\r\nAmong Useless Curiosities, was seen Idleness, with a troop of\r\nloiterers who ran about hunting for gossip and false rumours, merely\r\nto pass the time and “to find out what was going on in the world”;\r\nothers who consulted almanacks to discover what the weather would be;\r\nand also sleepers, who, awakening, entertained each other with their\r\ndreams, from which they foretold what was about to happen! Mistakes,\r\nNew Opinions, Alchemy, Sorcery, Magic and Superstition were some of\r\nthe “characters” in the scene showing Dangerous Curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth parts showed Useful and Necessary Curiosity,\r\nrespectively. Useful Curiosity was represented by travellers whose\r\ndesire to learn all about the manners and customs of different\r\nnations drove them into foreign countries; also “by physicians who\r\nwork to gain experience.” In Necessary Curiosity was introduced the\r\nart of navigation, instanced by sailors, who, under the guidance of\r\nTiphys, helmsman of the _Argo_, set out “to discover new worlds”;\r\nanother example of “necessary curiosity” being the fire brought\r\nfrom Heaven by Prometheus for people eager to discover its use. The\r\npoetical allegories were not less ingenious than the philosophic,\r\nalthough “they did not pretend,” as one old chronicler informs us,\r\n“to so much precision.”\r\n\r\nIn the same year at the Savoy Court, “_Alcée_,” a ballet of\r\nfishermen, with _intermezzi_ and some superb presents brought to Mme.\r\nRoyale for her birthday by the Prince of Piedmont and his Cavaliers,\r\nwas a grand water entertainment in which appeared, to quote an old\r\nhistorian, “Le Vaisseau de la Felicité accompagné de toutes les\r\nDeitez (sic) avec les Concerts de Musique, des quatres Elemens avec\r\nleur machines; de la Representation en Music (sic), d’Arion, du\r\nTemps avec les années heureuses, des quatres parties du monde avec\r\ndes Entrées de Ballets, des quatres Saisons avec le tribut de toutes\r\nleurs douceurs pour le Festin.” This was given by the Duke in honour\r\nof Mme. Royale on her birthday, and it was declared that a fête “plus\r\ncomplette, plus magnifique et plus agréable” had never been seen.\r\n\r\n“Eternity” was the title of a ballet given in 1629; “Le Temps\r\nEternel” following next year; “La Felicité Publique” the next; and in\r\n1632, “La Chasse Theatrale, representée en Ballet,” by the Cardinal\r\nof Savoy at his country mansion was given in honour of his brother,\r\nthe Duke’s birthday.\r\n\r\nAmong the “moral” ballets, there is hardly one more pleasing than\r\nthat composed to commemorate the birthday of the Cardinal of Savoy in\r\n1634. The subject of this ballet was “Truth, the Enemy of Appearance,\r\nas proved by Time”--_La Verita Nemica della Apparenza sollevata dal\r\nTempo_.\r\n\r\nThis ballet opened with a chorus of False Rumours and Suspicions,\r\nfollowed by Appearance and Lies! They were curiously represented by\r\ncharacters dressed as cocks and hens, who sang a dialogue half in\r\nItalian and half in French, mingled with the cluckings of cocks and\r\nhens. The chorus by the latter ran as follows:\r\n\r\n            “Su gli albori matutini\r\n             Cot, cot, cot, cot, cot cantando\r\n             Col cucurrii s’inchini\r\n             E bisbigli mormorando\r\n             Fra i sospetti, e fra i Rumori\r\n             Cu, cu, cu, cu, cu, cu, cu,\r\n             Salutiam del novo sol gli almi splendori.”\r\n\r\nThe cocks replied:\r\n\r\n            “Faisant la guerre au silence\r\n             Cot, cot, cot, avec nos chants,\r\n             Cette douce violence\r\n             Ravit les Cieux et les Champs.\r\n             Et notre inconstant hospice\r\n             Cot, cot, cot, cot, cot, coné\r\n             Couvre d’apparence un subtil artifice.”\r\n\r\nAfter this quaint song, the scene opened, and a large Cloud was seen,\r\naccompanied by the Winds. “Appearance” also made her entrance at this\r\nmoment. She had wings and a long peacock’s tail and her dress was\r\nhung with a number of mirrors. She was brooding over some eggs, from\r\nwhich hatched out--Pernicious Lies, Deceits and Frauds, White-Lies,\r\nFlatteries, Intrigues, Mockeries, Ridiculous Lies and Idle Tales! An\r\neternal crew!\r\n\r\nThe Deceits were dressed in dark colours with serpents concealed\r\namong flowers; the Frauds, clothed in hunters’ nets, struck bladders\r\nas they danced; the Flatteries were dressed as monkeys, Intrigues as\r\nlobster-catchers with lanterns in their hands and on their heads;\r\nRidiculous Lies were represented by beggars who pretended to be\r\ncripples with wooden legs.\r\n\r\nTime, having driven away Appearance with all her Lies, opened the\r\nnest on which she had been sitting and there appeared a great\r\nhour-glass from which Time ordered Truth to come forth; the latter\r\nthen calling back all the Hours, danced with them the finale of the\r\n“grand ballet.”\r\n\r\nSurely, the time is ripe for a revival of such a production!\r\n\r\n“Pâris” (1635), “Le Théâtre de la Gloire” (1637) and “La Bataille des\r\nVents” (1640) were notable productions at the Court of Savoy; but one\r\nof the most interesting of these seventeenth-century entertainments\r\nwas that on February 19th, 1640, when at the same Court was given a\r\n“Ballet of Alchemists” in which, under a charming allegory, they made\r\nfun of those seekers of the philosopher’s stone who pretend to make\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nHermes Trismegistus, dressed as a philosopher, with the master’s\r\nring, introduces some of the most celebrated chemists of different\r\nnations: Morieno, an Italian; Bauzan, a Greek; Körner, a German;\r\nUntser, a Swede; Calid, a Turk; Sandivoge, a Pole; Raymond Lulli\r\nand Hortulaus, Spaniards; Dolcon and Beguin, Frenchmen; Pierre, a\r\nLorrainer; Rasis, a Jew; and Geber, an Arab.\r\n\r\nThe Italian and the Greek brought in a furnace of five storeys and\r\noctagonal in shape. The German and the Swede brought in the alembics;\r\nthe Turk and the Pole came with flowers for distilling, which they\r\ncarried in baskets; the two Spaniards brought charcoal; the French\r\ncame with bellows to blow up the fire; the Lorrainer carried sieves\r\nfor sifting; the Jew and the Arab had in front of them leathern\r\naprons with various pockets, where they carried alum, vitriol,\r\nsulphur and ingots of metal.\r\n\r\nFor the grand ballet they all worked together around the furnace,\r\nwhence they drew a thousand pretty novelties to give to the ladies\r\nin the audience--essences, liqueurs, glass jewellery, mirrors,\r\nbracelets, Cyprus powder, paint and other treasures, very much as\r\npresents are given at Cotillons and big fancy dress balls to-day.\r\n\r\nYet another delightful production of this period must be chronicled,\r\nnamely, the “Ballet of Tobacco,” danced at Turin, the last day of\r\nCarnival, 1650. The scene represented the Isle of Tobago, “_from\r\nwhich tobacco took its name, and gave happiness to the nations to\r\nwhom the gods had given this plant_. First entered four High Priests\r\nof that country, who drew forth snuff from certain golden boxes\r\nwhich they carried, and threw this powder in the air to appease\r\nthe Winds and Tempests. Then with long pipes they smoked around an\r\naltar, making of their smoking tobacco a sort of sacrifice to their\r\nfavourite Deities. For the second entry two Indians were twisting\r\ninto a rope tobacco leaves. Two others were pounding it in mortars\r\nto reduce it to powder, and made the third entrance scene. The\r\nfourth was of snuff-takers, who sneezed and presented the snuff to\r\neach other, taking it in pinches with amusing ceremony; while the\r\nfifth was a band of smokers gathered together in an Academy or place\r\nset apart for smoking, wherein Turks, Spaniards, Poles and other\r\nnationalities received the tobacco from the Indians and proceeded to\r\ntake it in their different ways.”\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, were some of the continental ballets of the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century, a period, it must be admitted, not\r\nlacking in ingenuity, or resource in means of entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TURNING POINT: LE ROI SOLEIL AND HIS ACADEMY OF DANCING, 1651-1675\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some two centuries Italy had amused herself with Ballet as a\r\ncourtly entertainment; and so, during one, had England and France.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1651, it was France who was to give the lead to Europe, for\r\nin February of that year Louis-Quatorze, then a lad of thirteen,\r\nappeared in a ballet by Benserade, entitled “Cassandra,” and this was\r\nthe first of many in which he took part until, at the age of thirty,\r\nhe withdrew from the stage and gave his farewell performance in the\r\nballet of “Flora” in 1669. Strange, is it not, to think of a king as\r\na ballet-dancer? Yet, had not our own King Henry VIII been among the\r\njoyous masquers?\r\n\r\nBut Louis XIV was to become more than a mere participant in\r\nBallet--he was to become the virtual founder of modern Ballet as seen\r\non the stage; for it was he--universal patron of the arts--who was\r\nto found a Royal Academy of Dance and Music, to the existence and\r\nencouragement of which the modern development of both arts is largely\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nAll these ballets had been either the principal object or the\r\nsupplement of superb fêtes given at Versailles or in the other royal\r\npalaces. Historians have described the fêtes which Fouquet, the\r\nComptroller of Finances, offered to Louis XIV. As a sidelight on the\r\nComptroller’s magnificence and extravagance, the following is of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe king left Fontainebleau one evening in September, 1660,\r\nwith his entire Court, in order to have supper at the castle of\r\nVaux-le-Vicomte. The route, five leagues long, was illuminated with\r\nwaxen torches; and booths, put up at intervals, were laden with all\r\nkinds of refreshment for the travellers. The castle, blazing with\r\nlight, seemed to Louis like some palace of faerie. A magnificently\r\nfurnished suite was set apart for His Majesty, and the Court was put\r\nup in the minister’s house. An immense sideboard, laden with gold\r\nand silver plate, was a feature of the room in which the king was\r\nto have supper, with a fountain playing in the middle. A splendid\r\nbanquet was served, and a band placed in a gallery discoursed sweet\r\nmusic. Numerous other tables were set out for the Court; and the\r\nwhole of the king’s guard, even to the famous livery servants, were\r\nentertained most sumptuously during the two days that the fête lasted.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the king took a walk by a lake the shores of which were\r\ndecorated with orange trees, lemon trees, and pomegranates, planted\r\nin gilded tubs, the fruit being available to all who wanted any.\r\nThousands of torches diffused a brilliant light. A theatre, built\r\nin the middle of the lake, offered yet further entertainment with a\r\nrepresentation of “The Triumph of Venus,” a ballet of a new kind, in\r\nwhich Tritons and Nereids, having swum about in the waves, afterwards\r\nproceeded to sing eulogies of King Louis. All the best musicians of\r\nParis had been added to the king’s orchestra, and they were hidden\r\nbehind the scenery of the theatre, and in the neighbouring thickets.\r\nOn the following day there was a royal hunt, with tables served at\r\nall the meeting-places. There was fishing in the lake, from which\r\nthe net brought in enormous fish; there was a play, then a ball, and\r\nfinally fireworks; not to mention the sumptuous and delicate fare;\r\nthe exquisite wines and delicious liqueurs which were provided on\r\nthe same scale of unlimited extravagance.\r\n\r\nOn the first day Louis, whilst admiring the gardens and park from his\r\nwindow, had remarked on its beauty, but said that the view would be\r\nstill more lovely if it were not shut in by a wood of tall trees that\r\nhe pointed out. Next morning Fouquet drew the king to the same window\r\nand led the conversation in such a way that Louis might repeat the\r\nremark he had made the evening before.\r\n\r\n“Sire, since that wood has the misfortune to displease you, it shall\r\nfall immediately.”\r\n\r\nThen at a given signal the forest disappeared with a crash as if\r\nby magic, and the royal eye could see to the horizon. Sawn through\r\nduring the night and attached to ropes that a hidden army of peasants\r\npulled all at the same time, the trees fell at the voice of command.\r\n\r\nAll this magnificence and extravagance astonished the courtiers, but\r\nserved also to arouse considerable suspicion. The king’s brother\r\nremarked that the name of the castle should rather be _Vol-le-Roi_\r\nthan _Vaux-le-Vicomte_. This fête, an act of homage, as imprudent as\r\nit was ambitious, hastened the downfall of its author, and from that\r\nvery day his doom was assured.\r\n\r\nAmong the many ballets in which Louis XIV himself took part, the more\r\nnotable were “Le Triomphe de Bacchus,” “Le Temps,” “Les Plaisirs,”\r\n“L’Amour Malade,” “Alcibiade,” “La Raillerie,” “L’Impatience,”\r\n“Vincennes,” and “Les Amours Déguisés,” as well as some of the\r\ncomédie-ballets of Molière.\r\n\r\nLouis represented only the more exalted characters, such as Jupiter,\r\nNeptune, Apollo; though on occasion, to display the variety of his\r\ntalent, he essayed an experiment in _genre bouffonesque_. Among the\r\n_entrées_ in the “Triomphe de Bacchus,” for instance, there was one\r\nfor some _filous, traîneurs d’épée, sortant du palais de Silène,\r\néchauffés par le vin_, and the King playing the _rôle_ of one of the\r\n“filous,” sang the following stanza:\r\n\r\n               “Dans le metier qui nous occupe\r\n                Nos sentiments sont assez beaux,\r\n                Car nous prisons plus une jupe\r\n                Que nous ne ferions vingt manteaux.”\r\n\r\nThe Duc Mercour, the Marquis de Montglas, the Messieurs Sanguin and\r\nLachesnaye, garbed as attendants on Bacchus, addressed the following\r\nverses to the ladies of the Court, and the author had carefully\r\nindicated that they were to be spoken to the “demoiselles”:\r\n\r\n        “Il n’est pas mal aisé d’acquérir nos offices,\r\n         Et pour y parvenir le chemin en est doux;\r\n         Mais vous ne sauriez mieux vous adresser qu’à nous,\r\n         Si vous voulez apprendre à devenir nourrices.”\r\n\r\nCopies of the “book” of the ballet are, I believe, extant; and the\r\ndesigns for the costumes of the actors are still more curious.\r\n\r\nThe members of His Majesty’s ballet, if they were not expert ballet\r\ndancers, could at least give ample proof of their nobility. Louis\r\nXIV counted marquises and marchionesses, dukes and duchesses, even\r\nprinces and princesses and queens among his subjects, that is, his\r\ndancing subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1661 that the king founded the Dancing Academy. A room in\r\nthe Louvre was assigned to this learned society, which, however,\r\npreferred to gilded ceilings the smoky walls of an inn having for\r\nits sign “L’Epée de Bois.” It was in this favourite retreat that\r\nthe members of the new Academy met together. It was here that the\r\ninterests of the kingdom of the _rigaudon_ and the _minuet_ were\r\nregulated, where elections were held, and, without breaking up the\r\nsession, without even leaving their academic chairs, dinner was\r\nserved to the members on the table where each had just cast his\r\nvote. A tablecloth covered the green cloth; the bottle followed the\r\ninkhorn; supper replaced the ballot-box; and the assembly drank long\r\ndraughts to the health of the new member.\r\n\r\nThe letters patent for the foundation of the Dancing Academy read\r\ncuriously. In the preamble, for instance, the king thus expressed\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n“Although the art of dancing has always been recognised as one of\r\nthe most honourable, and the most necessary for the training of the\r\nbody, to give it the first and most natural foundations for all\r\nkinds of exercises and amongst others to those of arms; and as it\r\nis, consequently, one of the most useful to our nobility and others\r\nwho have the honour of approaching us, not only in times of war in\r\nour armies, but also in times of peace, in the performance of our\r\nballets, nevertheless, during the disorder of the last wars, there\r\nhave been introduced into the said art, as in all others, a great\r\nnumber of abuses likely to bring them to irretrievable ruin.\r\n\r\n“Many ignorant people have tried to disfigure the dance and to spoil\r\nit, as exhibited in the personal appearance of the majority of people\r\nof quality: so that we see few among those of our Court and suite who\r\nwould be able to take part in our ballets, whatever scheme we drew up\r\nto attract them thereto. It being necessary, therefore, to provide\r\nfor this, and wishing to re-establish the said art in its perfection,\r\nand to increase it as much as possible, we deemed it opportune to\r\nestablish in our good town of Paris a Royal Academy of Dancing,\r\ncomprising thirteen of the most experienced men in the said art, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\n    MM. Galant du Désert, dancing-master to the Queen;\r\n    Prévôt, dancing-master to the King;\r\n    Jean Renaud, dancing-master to His Majesty’s brother;\r\n    Guillaume Raynal, dancing-master to the Dauphin;\r\n    Nicolas de Lorges;\r\n    Guillaume Renaud;\r\n    Jean Picquet;\r\n    Florent Galant du Désert;\r\n    Jean de Grigny.”\r\n\r\nThese, let us note, are the names of the patriarchs of the French\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nIn 1669 the Abbé Perrin, who was official introducer of Ambassadors\r\nto Gaston, Duc d’Orléans?, having obtained exclusive rights from the\r\nking, went into theatrical management, taking as his colleagues the\r\nMarquis de Sourdeac to direct the scenic and mechanical effects, and\r\nCambert to supply the music. A certain Champeron advanced the money,\r\nand on March 28th, 1671, “Pomone,” a pastoral in five acts, words by\r\nPerrin, music by Cambert, dances by Beauchamps, was produced at the\r\ntheatre of the Rue Mazarine.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was poor, but this did not prevent the house being\r\ncrowded for eight months, so that at the end of this time Perrin drew\r\nout thirty thousand francs as his share: but the various members of\r\nthe little syndicate disagreed when it came to sharing out. Lulli\r\nprofited by their disputes, cleared out Perrin and his partners,\r\nand started again in a disused tennis-court known as the _Bel Air_,\r\nsituated in the Rue de Vaugirard, near the Luxembourg. He had as\r\ncolleagues Quinault for the poetic libretti, and an Italian named\r\nVigarani for the mechanical effects, one of the cleverest stage\r\nmanagers in Europe at the time. They produced there in 1672 the\r\n“Fêtes de Bacchus et de l’Amour.” When Molière died in the following\r\nyear, the hall of the Palais-Royal, which he had occupied, was given\r\nto Lulli.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV, by letters patent, dated 1672, concerning the\r\nnon-forfeiture of nobility of ladies and nobles who were prepared\r\nto figure in the scene at the opera, authorises his “faithful and\r\nwell-beloved Jean-Baptiste Lulli to add to the Royal Academy of Music\r\nand Dancing, instituted by these presents, a school suitable to\r\neducate pupils as much for dancing as for singing and also to train\r\nbands of violins and other instruments.”\r\n\r\nThe Sun-King, in fact, exerted his care to such a point that he\r\nhimself superintended and wrote with his own hand the budget of the\r\n_corps de ballet_ at the Opera.\r\n\r\n    The order is dated January 11th, 1713.\r\n    The male dancers were twelve in number.\r\n    Their united salaries amounted to 8400 francs.\r\n    Two of them had 1000 francs.\r\n    Four, 800 francs.\r\n    Four, 600 francs.\r\n    Two others, 400 francs.\r\n    The ten female dancers earned together 5400 francs.\r\n    The two principals had 900 francs.\r\n    The four seconds had 500 francs.\r\n    The four last 400 francs.\r\n\r\nThere were besides:\r\n\r\n    A master of the dancing-room, at 500 francs.\r\n    A composer of ballets, at 1500 francs.\r\n    A designer, at 1200 francs.\r\n    And a master-tailor, at 800 francs.\r\n\r\nThe king busied himself even with the author’s royalties, and it must\r\nbe confessed that he showed himself more generous proportionately\r\ntowards the authors than towards the artists. According to a rate\r\nfixed by him, a hundred and twenty francs were paid for a ballet\r\nfor each of the first ten performances and sixty francs for each\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nLa Bruyère, author of “Les Caractères,” has spoken of the virtuosi of\r\nthe dance who shone in his time, and in criticising their methods,\r\nhe sheds light on the difficulties which had already been surmounted\r\nin 1675. “Would the dancer Cobus please you, who, throwing up his\r\nfeet in front, turns once in the air, before regaining the floor?”\r\nAgain, “Do you ignore the fact that he is no longer young?” says La\r\nBruyère, when speaking to the susceptible ladies of the Court. It was\r\nBeauchamps or Le Basque, dancers at the Opera, that he meant. The\r\nfamous Pécourt is also described under the name of Bathyle. “Where\r\nwill you find, I do not say in the order of knights which you look\r\ndown upon, but among the players in a farce, a young man, who leaps\r\nhigher into the air whilst dancing, or who cuts better capers? As for\r\nhim, the crowd is too great, he refuses more women than he accepts.”\r\n\r\nPécourt, the adored of the beauties of the time, was the favoured\r\nlover of Ninon de l’Enclos. One day, the Maréchal de Choiseul, his\r\nrival, met, at the house of their common mistress, the popular\r\ndancer, who was dressed in what was apparently a uniform.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said he ironically, “since when have you turned soldier, M.\r\nPécourt? And in what corps are you serving?”\r\n\r\n“Marshal,” was the reply, “I _command_ a _corps_ in which you have\r\nlong _served_.”\r\n\r\nBlondi, Beauchamps’ nephew; Feuillet, Desaix, Ballon, Baudiery-Laval,\r\nand his son Michel-Jean, a good dancer and an excellent mechanical\r\ncontriver; Mesdemoiselles Subligny, Prévôt, Carville, and Le Breton,\r\nwere also stars of the period, of some of whom there will be more to\r\nsay presently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BOOK II: THE SECOND ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSOME EARLY STARS AND BALLETS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time after the founding of the King’s Dancing Academy the\r\nFrench Opera stage was ungraced by the feminine form, though women\r\ntook part in the performance at some of the minor theatres, such as\r\nthe famous Theatres of the Fair in Paris.\r\n\r\nFor the entertainment of the more exalted sections of Society the\r\nmore exalted ladies themselves performed; at Court, however, _not_ on\r\nthe public stage, where, as in our own theatre in Elizabethan times,\r\nyouths played the women’s _rôles_.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case in the production of a ballet by Lulli and\r\nDesbrosses in 1672, “Les Fêtes de l’amour et de Bacchus,” in which M.\r\nle Duc de Monmouth, M. le Duc de Villeroy, M. le Marquis de Rassen,\r\nand M. Legrand, executed various dances “supported” by Beauchamps, M.\r\nAndré, Favier and Lapierre, professional male dancers at the Opera.\r\n\r\nOf these the leader was Beauchamps, director of the Royal Academy\r\nof Dancing, composer of, and superintendent of, the Court Ballets\r\nof Louis XIV in 1661, and made _maître des ballets_ to the Academy\r\nin 1671. He danced with the king in the entertainment at Court,\r\nand though La Bruyère says of him, “_qu’il jetait les jambes en\r\navant, et faisait un tour en l’air avant que de retomber à terre_,”\r\nshowing that even in those days the public loved “sensation,” he\r\nwas ordinarily a grave and dignified executant. He was one of the\r\nfirst experimentalists in the direction of inventing a system of\r\nChoreography, or the writing down of dances in a kind of shorthand,\r\nso that a dance once designed should never be lost, but could be\r\nread and repeated as easily as a piece of music. In this he was only\r\nfollowing on the track of old Arbeau, but his system was different,\r\nand, if not ideal, at least it paved the way to a better. Beauchamps\r\ndied in 1705.\r\n\r\nPécourt, who was “_premier danseur et maître des ballets de\r\nl’Opéra_,” made his _début_ only in 1672. His style was what is known\r\nas “_demi-caractère_,” and he is said to have had notable effect on\r\nthe ladies of his day, his amazing lightness fairly turning their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nBlondi, a nephew of Beauchamps; Ballon, who became _maître à danser_\r\nto Louis XV; Baudiery-Laval, a nephew of Ballon, who succeeded his\r\nuncle as dancing-master to the Royal Family and _maître des ballets_\r\nat Court; Michel-Jean Baudiery-Laval, son of the last-named, who\r\nwas not only a _maître à danser_, but is said to have been the\r\nfirst stage manager to have used lycopodium powder, which used to\r\nbe the chief means of producing stage lightning; these were some\r\nof the lesser stars of the end of the seventeenth and beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth centuries in France, and they were to be followed by\r\nLouis-Pierre Dupré, who came to be known as _Le Grand Dupré_, and\r\nwho surpassed all his forerunners by the grace and the dignity of\r\nhis dancing, and the _noblesse_ of his poses. He made his _début_ in\r\n1720, was long the _premier danseur_ at the Opera, and did not retire\r\ntill 1754.\r\n\r\nTo hark back, however, to 1672, when there were only men to play\r\nthe women’s parts. The reason for the dearth of feminine stars was\r\nquite simple. The Academy was in its infancy. There were no properly\r\nqualified professional _danseuses_, and the courtly amateurs were too\r\ncourtly--and too much amateurs--to appear to advantage on the stage.\r\nThe Academy came to alter all that.\r\n\r\nIt revived a genuine interest in dancing as an art worthy of\r\nserious consideration; and Lulli, that inspired monkey of a\r\ndancing-musician, did the rest; for it was his opera-ballet, “Le\r\nTriomphe de L’Amour,” produced on May 16th, 1681, which brought the\r\npresence of women dancers to the boards.\r\n\r\nVarious high ladies of the Court, the Dauphine, la Princesse de\r\nConti, Mlle. de Nantes, and others, formed a useful background, but\r\nthe entire feminine _personnel_ of the dancing school numbered only\r\nfour--Mlle. Lafontaine, Mlle. Le Peintre, Mlle. Fernon, and Mlle.\r\nRoland, the first-named being the leader, the _première des premières\r\ndanseuses_, and accorded the title so often granted to successive\r\n_premières_ since then, of _Reine de la Danse_.\r\n\r\nThat admirable historian of French opera, Castil-Blaze, has given\r\nexcellent account of the state of affairs towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n“The lack of good dancers,” he says, “was doubtless an obstacle in\r\nthe way of the introduction of grand ballet at the Royal Academy.\r\n‘Les Fêtes de L’Amour et de Bacchus,’ ‘Le Triomphe de L’Amour,’\r\nand all productions of the same kind commonly called at that time\r\nBallets, were really nothing less than Operas treated in such a way\r\nas to give a little more freedom for the introduction of dances,\r\nthe singing being nevertheless still the main object. Pécourt, who\r\nmade his _début_ in ‘Cadmus,’ shared the honours of the dance with\r\nBeauchamps, with Dolivet, a capital mime, and another good dancer\r\nnamed L’Etang. The company of singers also included some notable\r\npersonalities, and though the functions of singer and dancer were\r\nusually kept pretty well apart, one actress, Mlle. Desmatins,\r\nmanaged, in the opera of ‘Perseus,’ to score a double success as\r\nsinger and dancer, a very unusual combination, as it is seldom indeed\r\nthat a dancer is good for much as a vocalist. Vigarani, an Italian\r\ntheatrical _machiniste_, of great talent, had charge of the theatres\r\nof the Court; and another Italian, Rivani, and Francis Berein,\r\nfulfilled a similar function with regard to the Opera.”\r\n\r\nItalian ballets, executed by Italian dancers, were among the\r\nfavourite diversions of the French Court towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries, which accounts\r\nfor the frequency with which they appear in the paintings of Watteau,\r\nLancret, and other artists of the period. That of “L’Impatience”\r\nhad been partly translated into the French in order that Louis XIV\r\nmight take part in it, and was, like all the comedy-ballets of the\r\ntime, a series of detached scenes quite independent of each other,\r\nmerely depicting the various amusing examples of impatience which one\r\nusually finds--in other people!\r\n\r\nThe taste, however, for the Italian ballet, by no means interfered\r\nwith the development of the native type, which received not only the\r\nsupport of the nobility, but increasing support on the professional\r\nand technical side, for authors, musicians, and dancers were\r\nbeginning to realise that ballet was a form of art which had long\r\nbeen too neglected, and that it was worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n“Le Temps de la Paix,” represented at Fontainebleau, was given by the\r\n_corps de ballet_ of the newly founded _Académie Royale_, illustrious\r\ndancers and scions of the nobility all taking their share in the\r\nproduction. The women dancers from the theatre, who mingled with the\r\nprincesses and ladies of the Court, were termed _femmes pantomimes_,\r\nin order to distinguish them from the titled _dilettanti_. Among\r\nthe amateurs one finds the name of the Princesse de Conti; Duchesse\r\nde Bourbon; such good old names as Mlle. de Blois, D’Armagnac, de\r\nBrienne, D’Uzès, D’Estrées; on the theatrical side such artists as\r\nHardouin, Thévenard, and the amazing Mlle. de Maupin--heroine of\r\na hundred wild and questionable adventures--were among the more\r\nillustrious of the singers; while Ballon, whom we have already named,\r\nwon applause for the energy and vivacity of his dance, and Mlle.\r\nSubligny was equally admired for the grace and dignity of hers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPANTOMIME AT SCEAUX: AND MLLE. PRÉVÔT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mention of Subligny recalls the interesting fact that during the\r\nreigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV of France there was a considerable\r\nimportation of French and Italian actors, singers, dancers, and\r\nmusicians into England.\r\n\r\nWe all know the complaints in _The Spectator_ and other journals of\r\nthe period against the craze for Italian opera.\r\n\r\nA little earlier than that Cambert, who had been Director of the\r\nKing’s Music to the Court of Louis-Quatorze and organist at the\r\nChurch of St. Honoré in Paris, and who, after breaking fresh ground\r\nin French opera, was also one of the first to experiment with Ballet,\r\nbecame attached to the Court of our own Charles II in 1677. He died\r\nin London, whence he had withdrawn out of jealousy towards his\r\npushing young rival Lulli.\r\n\r\nDesmarets, Campra, Destouches, Rebel, Bourgeois, Mouret and\r\nMonteclair are also names of French composers of opera and ballet,\r\nfrom about 1693 to 1716, well known to students of musical history,\r\nperhaps their only successor worthy of mention being Quinault, until\r\nall, from Lulli onwards, were to be eclipsed by the greater Rameau,\r\nwho was composer of nearly a score of notable ballets, and who\r\nmade his appearance on the musical horizon in the ’thirties of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the dancers. Nivelon was one of the more\r\nfamous French dancers who visited London towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, and had considerable success; as did another\r\nof the early _danseuses_, Mlle. Subligny, who came to London with\r\ninfluential introductions to John Locke, of all people in the\r\nworld, author of the famous but soporific _Essay on the Human\r\nUnderstanding_, which, however, omits any reference to that of the\r\ncharming dancer.\r\n\r\nIt can readily be imagined that the introduction of women to the\r\nFrench stage made for improvement in many directions besides access\r\nof grace. The little rivalries and successes of women dancers induced\r\na general spirit of emulation that had its effect on technique.\r\n\r\nNow, following on the introduction of women dancers to the stage,\r\nwe come to another interesting point in the history of the dance\r\nand ballet; for, once again, it was due to a woman that we had the\r\ninvention--or rather the revival--for it had not been seen since the\r\ndays of Bathyllus and Pylades in Augustan Rome--of ballet-pantomime,\r\na ballet acted entirely pantomimically, or in dumb-show.\r\n\r\nIt was the happy idea of the learned and extravagant Duchesse\r\ndu Maine, whose _Nuits de Sceaux_ have been chronicled by that\r\nfascinating bluestocking, Mlle. Delaunay, who was later to become\r\nfamous as Madame de Staël.\r\n\r\nAmong the endless round of fêtes and entertainments at Sceaux,\r\nat the little theatre in which she took such prominent part, the\r\never-restless Duchess never presented her guests with a greater\r\nnovelty. Day and night--and especially night--they had all been\r\nrequisitioned to invent ingenious amusements. Sleep had been banished\r\nfrom the exigent little Court. Dialogues, “proverbs,” “literary\r\nlotteries,” songs and comedies had been turned out without cessation\r\nas from a literary factory. Always it had been “words, words, words,”\r\nand play on words. Now, for the first time for centuries--as it\r\n_was_, in fact, and must certainly have _seemed_ to the Duchess’s\r\nhouse-parties!--there was to be silence on the stage at Sceaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Duchesse du Maine]\r\n\r\nHaving chosen the last scene of the fourth act of Corneille’s\r\n“Horace,” the Duchess commanded the composer Mouret to set it to\r\nmusic as if it were to be sung. The words were then ignored, the\r\nmusic was played by an orchestra, and the two well-known dancers,\r\nM. Ballon and Mlle. Prévôt, of the Royal Academy, mutely mimed the\r\nactions and emotions of the leading characters, so dramatically and\r\nwith such intensity of feeling that, it is said, both they and their\r\naudience were moved at times to tears!\r\n\r\nFrançoise Prévôt, or Prévost, was born about 1680, made her _début_\r\nat the age of eighteen, and when Subligny retired in 1705, took her\r\nplace as _première danseuse_. For some twenty odd years she was the\r\njoy of all frequenters of the Opera, for her grace and lightness\r\nof style. She retired in 1730, and died eleven years after. Among\r\nthe more famous of her pupils were Marie Sallé and Marie-Anne de\r\nCupis de Camargo, of both of whom there will be more to say in due\r\ncourse. Meanwhile, among the dances mainly in vogue during Prévôt’s\r\nearlier period were the _Courantes_, _Allemandes_, _Gigues_,\r\n_Contredanses_; and in her later years, _Chaconnes_, _Passacailles_,\r\nand _Passepieds_. For the dancing of the last Prévôt was especially\r\nfamed.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his “_Maître à Danser_,” published four years\r\nafter the dancer’s retirement, Rameau describes her in the following\r\nterms: “_Dans une seule de ses danses sont renfermées toutes les\r\nrègles qu’après de longues méditations nous pouvons donner sur\r\nnotre art, et elle les met en pratique, avec tant de grâce, tant\r\nde justesse, tant de légèreté, tant de précision qu’elle peut être\r\nregardée comme un prodige dans ce genre._”\r\n\r\nAgain, Noverre, in his _Lettres sur la Danse_, published later, makes\r\ngraceful reference to Prévôt in recalling his impressions of famous\r\ndancers whom he had seen in earlier years, and gives us, too, an\r\ninteresting criticism of the methods of the composers of ballet in\r\nthe mid-eighteenth century. “_La plupart des compositeurs_,” he says,\r\n“_suivent les vieilles rubriques de l’opéra. Ils font des passe-pieds\r\nparceque Mdlle. Prévôt les courait avec elegance; des musettes\r\nparceque Mdlle. Sallé et M. Dumoulin les dansaient avec autant de\r\ngrace que de volupté; des tambourins parceque c’était le genre où\r\nMdlle. de Camargo excellait; des chaconnes et des passacailles\r\nparceque le célèbre Dupré s’était comme fixé à ces mouvements; qu’ils\r\ns’ajoustaient à son goût, à son genre et à la noblesse de sa taille.\r\nMais tous ces excellents Sujets n’y sont plus; ils ont été remplacés\r\net au-delà, dans des parties et ne le seront peut être jamais dans\r\nles autres...._”\r\n\r\nThough Noverre was writing this about 1760, we have to remember\r\nthat he cannot actually have seen Prévôt, since he was only born\r\n1727, and _she_ retired in 1730. But he records an interesting\r\ntradition in complaining that the greater number of the composers of\r\nhis time still followed the older canon of the opera, and composed\r\n_passepieds_ because “Mdlle. Prévôt _les courait_”; for it shows\r\nthat the technique of the dance had already begun to outgrow that\r\nof the composer. Musicians were following in their forerunner’s\r\ntracks; dancers were advancing on the road of invention. Indeed, we\r\nshall see that this was so when we come to consider the differences\r\nbetween the styles of Prévôt and her later successors. For the moment\r\nit suffices to record that Prévôt, star of the French opera from\r\nabout 1700 to 1730, was famous for her elegance, for her “grace,”\r\n“lightness,” “precision,” as revealed in the comparatively slow\r\ndances of her period, when the technique was obviously not immature\r\n(or Rameau could not have noted such qualities in her dancing), but\r\nevidently had not yet developed in the direction of speed, or of\r\n_tours de force_ such as some of the later dancers were to exhibit.\r\nThe _passepied_, of which an old French dancer-poet wrote:\r\n\r\n          “_Le léger passe-pied doit voler terre à terre_,”\r\n\r\nwas a dance in three-four time, a species of minuet, performed, as\r\nthe poet records, “_terre à terre_,” hence Noverre’s description:\r\n\r\n    “Mdlle. Prévôt les _courait_ avec elegance.”\r\n\r\nA modern versifier has--perhaps presumptuously--put the following\r\nlines into the dancer’s mouth:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PRÉVÔT SPEAKS\r\n\r\n              “Though others by Courante may swear\r\n               Or some the grave Allemande prefer,\r\n               Or vow for Gigues alone they care,\r\n               Or Contredanse’s vulgar stir:\r\n               For me--who am no villager!--\r\n               I love not dances rough and free,\r\n               Nor yet too slow! Without demur\r\n               The Passepied’s the dance for me.\r\n\r\n              “Hark to its gentle, plaintive air!\r\n               Was music ever mellower,\r\n               More full of grace, more sweetly fair?\r\n               No dancer, sure, could wish to err\r\n               From the staid rhythms that recur--\r\n               As softly as a breath may be--\r\n               With base like a pleased kitten’s purr:\r\n               The Passepied’s the dance for me!\r\n\r\n              “No other music now may share,\r\n               With this my favour, or could spur\r\n               My feet new measures now to dare.\r\n               What of Camargo? As for her--\r\n              (Of passing fancies harbinger!)\r\n               Quickness, but naught of grace has she.\r\n              _She_ dance? That plain, fast foreigner?\r\n               The Passepied’s the dance for _me_!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ENVOI\r\n\r\n              “_Lovers of dance, let naught deter_\r\n               _Your love from graces all can see_\r\n               _In Passepied! And all aver_\r\n               _The Passepied’s the dance for me!_”\r\n\r\nOf the jealousy which might have impelled Mlle. Prévôt to speak thus\r\nof her young rival Camargo and her quicker style there will be more\r\nto say presently. It is necessary for a while to turn aside (even\r\nto hark back a little, perhaps, since in dealing with a period of\r\ntransition there must be several threads to trace back and gather\r\nup), and to glance at another phase of theatrical history than that\r\nof the _première danseuse_ and the august Royal Opera, namely, the\r\nless exalted--and more popular--theatre; one which proved often\r\nthe antechamber to the greater stage and Royal favour, to wit--the\r\nItalian Comedy and the Theatres of the Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nITALIAN COMEDY AND THE THEATRES OF THE FAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nHumanity, like history, repeats itself in its recurring moods.\r\nSome years ago London playgoers went rather mad over what was\r\na comparatively new thing to that period, the production of a\r\ndelightful play without words, namely, MM. Carré and Wormser’s\r\n“L’Enfant Prodigue,” acted to perfection by a cast headed by Mlle.\r\nJane May, as Pierrot, with Mlle. Zanfretta as Pierrette.\r\n\r\nAbout two thousand years ago the playgoers of ancient Rome began\r\nto go mad about what was _then_ thought to be a really new\r\nthing--pantomime acting without words.\r\n\r\nThe two pantomimists, Bathyllus and Pylades, then set a standard in\r\nmimetic representation never achieved before. The two Roman actors\r\nwere “dancers,” but it was because they were panto-mimes of such\r\nbrilliant quality that they became famous. Had they been merely\r\ndancers they would hardly have made the impression they did.\r\n\r\nThe modern ballet-dancer--as we understand the word--knows, or should\r\nknow, that dancing without the ability to mime is not enough to win\r\nthe fame of a Taglioni, a Grisi, Génée or Karsavina, in ballet.\r\n\r\nIn opera a voice of the loveliest tone, together with an acquired\r\ntechnical excellence in the use of it, has not the power to move the\r\nhearers if _expression_ is lacking. _It is the art of the mime which\r\ngives expression and significance to the art of the dancer_; and it\r\nwas as dancer-mimes that Pylades and Bathyllus moved their audience\r\nto something like worship.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a pretence, this doing without words. I say\r\n“pretence” because you cannot do away with words. You may have a\r\n“wordless” play, but behind the dumb-show there are still the words.\r\nIt is so in life. Behind all things is--the Word. Things are only\r\nrepresentative of thoughts; and thoughts are inconceivable without\r\nwords. We may not always speak with tongue and voice; but, if we have\r\nthe impulse to speak, the instrument matters not, and we may “speak”\r\nwith our hands. So doing, a look or gesture becomes a word, a series\r\nof gestures a sentence.\r\n\r\nNow, in ancient Roman days when the ordinary spoken comedy merged\r\nfirst into a sort of musical comedy, and then, at the dawn of the\r\nChristian era, into unspoken comedy or pantomime; and when, in\r\naddition, all the Greek plays and stories of the Greek and Latin\r\nmyths were drawn upon for pantomime, some of the original characters\r\nstayed and others were incorporated in the general make-up of the\r\npurely wordless play as this form of entertainment grew increasingly\r\npopular; and among the new-comers was probably Mercury, who became a\r\nsort of Harlequin, with gift of invisibility and magic wand.\r\n\r\nThe _spoken_ comedy of ancient Rome becoming superseded, first by\r\nthe pantomimes and secondly by the craze for the circus, finally\r\ndied down with the fall of the Empire itself, and did not revive\r\nfor some hundreds of years, until the world’s great reawakening, in\r\nthe Middle Ages, to the wonders of the classic past. But it is more\r\nthan probable that this dumb comedy, or _panto-mime_, any more than\r\ndancing, _did not die_.\r\n\r\nIn Sicily and Southern Italy more especially it would have survived;\r\nfor expressive pantomime was always as much a means of speech among\r\nthe Southern Latins as verbal language itself.\r\n\r\nIn the old Latin Comedy the same set of characters were often made\r\nto appear in other guises, and in different comic situations. Maccus,\r\nfor instance, though still called so, would appear at one time as an\r\nold maid, at another as a raw soldier: Pappus would be a doting old\r\nhusband, or father whose daughter was abducted: and he was usually\r\noutwitted whatever the situation he was in. These and various other\r\ntypes, and this custom of making them each a kind of “quick-change”\r\nartist, survived, or at least revived.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, as time went by, various local types were added to the\r\noriginal cast of the pantomime. The old man would be a Venetian; the\r\nDoctor, from Bologna, famous for its University and--poisons; the\r\nClown would be a peasant-servant from Bergamo; the braggart soldier,\r\na “Capitan,” would be from Spain; sometimes they would each speak\r\nin their own particular dialect, and fun would be made thereof.\r\nThroughout the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries the\r\nfame of the Italian comedians spread throughout the world.\r\n\r\nTroupes found their way to Paris and London, and no slight traces\r\nof their influence are to be found in Shakespeare and Molière.\r\nPre-Shakespearean comedy in England was often impromptu and\r\npantomimic; and the actors worked much as the Italian players had\r\nalways done.\r\n\r\nIn 1611 a well-known Italian comedian, Flaminio Scala, printed a book\r\nof plays performed by his company. _There was no dialogue!_ They were\r\nsimply something like what we know as “plots,” though the French\r\nword “_canevas_” expresses it better. It was merely the outline of\r\nthe play, entrances, exits, “business” written on canvas and hung\r\nup in the wings as a reminder to the actors, who “gagged” the play\r\nthroughout, each usually introducing his own stock tricks or business\r\n(_lazzi_ was the Italian word) as the play proceeded. In one of the\r\nFlaminio Scala’s plots we find a Pantalon, a Dottore or Doctor, a\r\nCaptain (a braggart such as Pistol), a Pedrolino, later to become\r\nbetter known to us after various changes of spirit as Pierrot.\r\n\r\nIn seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Paris the Italian players had\r\na sensational success, being honoured by Louis XIV and his successor;\r\nand were regularly introduced into the lighter operas, were copied by\r\nthe players in the Paris Fair Theatres, and were often the subject of\r\nthe brush of Watteau and other artists.\r\n\r\nIn a little volume I have, _Le Théâtre Italien_ (published 1695), by\r\nthe famous actor, Evariste Gherardi, the author explains that “the\r\nreader must not expect to find in this book entire comedies, because\r\nthe Italian plays could not be printed, for the simple reason that\r\nthe players learn nothing by rote, and it suffices for them merely\r\nto have seen the subject of the comedy a moment before stepping on\r\nthe stage.” He says that “the charm of the pieces is inseparable from\r\nthe action, and their success depends wholly on the actors, who _play\r\nfrom imagination rather than from memory, and compose their comedy\r\nwhile playing_.”\r\n\r\nAmong the titles of the plays we find: “Arlequin, Emperor in the\r\nMoon”; “Colombine, Advocate”; “Arlequin Proteus”; “Arlequin Jason”;\r\n“The Cause of Woman”; “Divorce”; and “Arlequin, Man of Fortune.”\r\nIn most we find Arlequin assuming various disguises--“_Arlequin\r\nen More_,” “_Arlequin deguisé en Baron_,” “_Arlequin deguisé en\r\nComtesse_” being among stage directions, for instance, to “The Cause\r\nof Woman.”\r\n\r\nBy the early eighteenth century the leading characters had\r\nbecome Arlequin, Pantalon, Punchinello, the Doctor, the Captain,\r\nScaramouche, Scapin, Leandre, and Mezzetin; and women had become\r\nincorporated in the generally enlarged cast, the chief being\r\nIsabelle, Octavie and Colombine.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the Duchesse du Maine, who in\r\n1708 revived the art of pure pantomime by producing an act of\r\nCorneille’s “Horace,” which was performed entirely in dumb show by\r\nthe dancer-mimes, Mdlle. Prévôt and Monsieur Ballon, to music by\r\nMouret.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Nivelon, and other dancers who were also mimes, such as\r\nSallé, began to come to London; and in the early eighteenth century\r\nwas seen the birth of the first real English _pantomime_, which bore\r\nsome resemblance to that of ancient Rome, owed something to the\r\nItalian comedy and to the more recent French theatre, with certain\r\nnew ideas of its own--especially in the way of costume and elaborate\r\nstaging. This was due to the enterprise of John Rich.\r\n\r\nBy Rich’s time Arlequin had become the all-important character of\r\nthe French comedy-stage, and he followed a then recent custom (also\r\nthe ancient Latin custom) of placing one character in various sets\r\nof circumstances. His first production at the Lincoln’s Inn Fields\r\nTheatre in 1717 was “Harlequin Sorcerer,” which was followed by\r\nseveral others with Harlequin as the hero. Their form was always\r\nmuch the same. A serious, classic or fabulous story, such as one\r\nfrom Ovid, was the basis of the work; while between the serious\r\nscenes, and partly woven into them, ran a lighter story, consisting\r\nmainly of Harlequin’s courtship of Columbine, with interference from\r\nother characters, on whom in turn Harlequin played tricks with his\r\nmagic wand. Rich played Harlequin, and made him dumb, for the simple\r\nreason that, though a clever actor, he could not speak well enough\r\nfor the stage. Thus he gave us once again the ancient classic art of\r\npantomime, which now became the true wordless English Harlequinade;\r\nand he taught his players of the other parts, Pantaloon, Pierrot,\r\nClown, Columbine, an art of wordless acting equal to his own. He\r\nrealised the value of fine mounting, and his productions were\r\ngorgeously staged and almost invariably successful.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, of course, to trace with some detail the\r\nhistory of Italian comedy and its influence on the French and English\r\nstage; indeed, to go fully into the vexed question of its origin.\r\nCertain modern scholars, such as Miss Winifred Smith in her extremely\r\nable and interesting volume on the _Commedia dell’ Arte_, issued by\r\nthe Columbia University of America, holds the view that it was _not_\r\nderived from the classic stage at all, but was a spontaneous growth\r\nof fifteenth-century Italy.\r\n\r\nAnother view is that there was an unbroken thread of tradition from\r\nGreece, through Sicily and the Greek settlements in south-eastern\r\nItaly, and that when the _Commedia_ attained its great vogue in\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, spreading through Italy\r\nand thence through western Europe, the charm and complexity of its\r\ntexture was due to the numerous strands that had been gathered up\r\nfrom various localities in the progress of years.\r\n\r\nYet another possibility is, that this central idea of pantomime, or\r\ndumb acting, may merely have occurred again and again through the\r\ncenturies, as a “new” idea, without direct impulse from tradition.\r\n\r\nPersonally I feel that acting _without_ words implies a greater\r\ntechnical advance in the art of representation than acting _with_\r\nthem, for it makes the actor more than merely repeater, or even\r\ninterpreter, of an author; _it makes him partly creator, or author_.\r\nIt is impossible, however, to go fully now into the question of the\r\norigin of the art of pantomime. Whatsoever diverse theories students\r\nmay hold, the fact remains that it _was_ known in classic days, and\r\nthat the form of it which we know under the Italian title of the\r\n_Commedia dell’ Arte_ flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, and certainly had its influence on the French and English\r\nstage, literature and art, and also on Ballet.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse du Maine in her pantomime production of Corneille’s\r\n“Horace” was deliberately harking back to a form of entertainment\r\nwhich she believed had held the classic stage; and the production\r\nwas not without effect on the history of Ballet. The appearance of\r\nItalian pantomime actors in Paris had additional influence.\r\n\r\nLook at some of the pictures of Watteau, Lancret and Fragonard. You\r\nwill see there the types of the Italian Comedy; turn to the scores\r\nof the opera-ballets of the early eighteenth century and you will\r\nnote that, more often than not, the Italian players were introduced;\r\njust as we to-day, in our _revues_, have introduced Russian dancers,\r\nor English players impersonating, or parodying, the Russians--simply\r\nbecause the Russians have in recent years attained a vogue similar\r\nto that attained by Italian singers in the ’forties of last century,\r\nand to that attained by the Italian comedy troupes of two centuries\r\nago. These things are introduced into current dramatic productions\r\njust because they have their vogue, just because they are “topical.”\r\nEqually they influence art and literature.\r\n\r\nEven the French critics seem hardly to have realised the extent to\r\nwhich French art of the early eighteenth century was influenced\r\nby the contemporary stage. All can see, of course, that it _was_\r\ninfluenced, to the extent of introducing the types of Italian comedy.\r\nOne has only to glance at Watteau’s “L’Amour au Théâtre Italien” to\r\nsee that patent fact. But the fact also that, except for his earlier\r\nlandscapes and camp scenes, several of Watteau’s pictures were, in\r\nall probability, _derived from ballets actually seen_ on the French\r\nstage seem to have been overlooked.\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier works attributed to Watteau is a picture\r\nrepresenting the “Departure of the Italian Comedians.” The engraving\r\nof it by L. Jacob in the wonderful Jullienne collection of engravings\r\nfrom Watteau’s works plainly gives the date of the incident as 1697.\r\nWatteau, however, did not arrive from Valenciennes to take up his\r\nabode in Paris until after 1702, when he came to reside and work\r\nwith Claude Gillot, the engraver.\r\n\r\nSo either this seems a mistake on Jullienne’s part, or the picture is\r\nnot by Watteau, but is worked up from sketches and descriptions by\r\nGillot or some other person who was an eyewitness of the incident;\r\nfor it is quite obvious that Watteau cannot have seen what took place\r\nin Paris before he arrived there, and when he was only thirteen years\r\nold, as he would have been in 1697.\r\n\r\nLet us turn aside for a while from this minor problem and consider\r\nwho, exactly, were these Italian comedians. From the sixteenth\r\ncentury, in 1570 as a fact, when Catherine de Medici invited a\r\ncompany of Italian players to Paris, there had been several troupes\r\narriving from time to time, under Court patronage. One of the\r\nearliest of importance came in 1576, and were known as _Gli Gelosi_,\r\n_Les Jaloux_, that is, according to one authority, folk jealous of\r\npleasing; though they may also have been so called from the fact that\r\nthey achieved their success first in a comedy of that name, _Gli\r\nGelosi_, or _Les Jaloux_.\r\n\r\nNearer the dates which are our concern was Fiorelli’s troupe, which\r\nin 1660 was properly established at the Palais Royal, where they\r\nplayed alternately with Molière’s company, and received the title of\r\n“_Comédiens du Roi de la troupe Italienne_.”\r\n\r\nIn 1684 it was established by order of the Dauphin that the troupe\r\nshould always be composed of twelve members, four women and eight\r\nmen, made up as follows: two women for “serious _rôles_,” two for\r\ncomic, two men for lovers, two for comic parts, two “_pour conduire\r\nl’intrigue_,” and two to play fathers and old men generally. These\r\nkept the traditional names respectively of: Isabelle, Eularia;\r\nColumbine, Marinette; Octave, Cinthio; Scaramouche, Arlequin;\r\nMezzetin, Pascariel; Pantalon, and the Doctor.\r\n\r\nIn 1697, however, the Italian comedians, who by now had begun to\r\ndevelop, from the _Commedia dell’ Arte_, or purely improvised dumb\r\nshow play of an earlier period into a more or less written “literary”\r\ncomedy, had the audacity to produce under the title of “La Fausse\r\nPrude,” a play, the title of which seemed to suggest foundation on a\r\nnovel (published in Holland) which had attacked the King’s mistress,\r\nMadame de Maintenon. For this they were banished, and were not\r\nrecalled to Royal favour until 1716.\r\n\r\nHence the problem of deciding Watteau’s connection with the painting\r\nof an incident that occurred in 1697, five years before he _can_\r\nhave reached Paris; and also of “placing” the rest of his avowedly\r\ntheatrical pictures, when apparently the Italian comedians were\r\nnot to be seen, or if seen, _not until 1716_; thus giving Watteau\r\nonly five years before his death in 1721 to account for the fairly\r\nextensive collection of works dealing expressly with these stage\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the period shortly after Watteau arrived in Paris, one\r\ncritic has declared (though it in no way lessens the value of his\r\ndecisions concerning Watteau’s art): “Indeed, during these early\r\nyears Watteau could have had no opportunity of studying the Italian\r\ncomedy, otherwise than through the works of his new preceptor and\r\nfriend”: this “preceptor and friend” being, of course, Gillot, by\r\nwhose enthusiasm for the stage Antoine’s own was unquestionably\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\nThe same writer goes on to say: “It can hardly be doubted that from\r\nhim--and not, as legend has it, from the stage itself--Watteau\r\nobtained his first peep into the strange realms of the _Commedia\r\ndell’ Arte_.”\r\n\r\nBut the plain fact is that there was every opportunity, despite this\r\nearlier banishment of the Royal troupe of Italian comedians, for\r\nWatteau to have obtained not only his first peep into the realms of\r\nthe _Commedia dell’ Arte_ and to have been influenced throughout his\r\nParis life, especially by Ballet.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Antoine reached the city in 1702 until his death in\r\n1721 there were four marked opportunities for stage influence,\r\nnamely, the legitimate and royally patronised French comedians; the\r\nOpera, still flushed with Lulli’s magic, and not despicably illumined\r\nby Campra; the Ballet, then finding wings to soar; and finally,\r\nthe Theatres of the Fair, which, with their gay quarrel against\r\nauthority, with their reckless parodies and splendid spectacles, have\r\nbeen strangely neglected by Watteau’s biographers as a contributory\r\ninfluence on his choice of subject.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the Theatres of the Fairs. The fairs\r\nthemselves, of St. Germain and St. Laurent, were of ancient\r\ninstitution, and from early times they had their side-shows of\r\ntumblers, rope-dancers, trained animals, such as performing bears,\r\nmonkeys, and white mice, as well as balladists and marionettes, which\r\nwere the chief attraction by the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the century each Fair had one or more troupes\r\nof actors, especially Italian, who played improvised pieces in\r\ndumb-show, as well as written farces, vaudevilles and parodies in\r\nItalian, French, and sometimes a mixture of both languages. These\r\ntroupes were quite apart from those which from time to time had been\r\nbrought from Italy by special invitation from the French Court.\r\n\r\nIt was the Royal Troupe _only_ that was expelled in 1697, for its\r\nperformance of “La Fausse Prude”; and it was really their expulsion\r\nwhich aroused the Theatres of the Fair to a new and more vigorous\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Departure of the Italian Comedians, 1697\r\n\r\n(_From an engraving by L. Jacob of Watteau’s picture_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pierrot and Arlequin in the early 18th Century\r\n\r\n(_From Riccoboni’s “Histoire du Théâtre Italien”_).]\r\n\r\nThe Fair of St. Germain was open from February 3rd to Easter Sunday;\r\nthe Fair of St. Laurent began at the end of June and closed in\r\nOctober, so that for the greater part of the year both offered\r\nopportunities for amusement of a less expensive and more popular sort\r\nthan did the aristocratic Comédie Française and Comédie Italienne;\r\nin fact, so popular were they that, on suppression of the Comédie\r\nItalienne, the aristocracy themselves patronised the foreign troupes\r\nof the Theatres of the Fair.\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of the eighteenth century, however, this very\r\npopularity became a source of worry to the managers of the troupes\r\nat the Fairs, for it involved the jealousy of the Comédie Française\r\nand the still youthful Opera; and the attempts of grandiose Authority\r\nto smother these minor theatres (which had public sympathy wholly\r\non their side) and the amazing resource shown by their managers in\r\nmeeting each fresh legal thunderbolt by some new and more hilarious\r\nevasion, is a veritable comedy in itself, but must not detain us\r\nnow. All we need to consider at the moment is that, despite attempts\r\nto suppress them there _were_ these troupes, at the Theatres of the\r\nFair, from before 1702, when Watteau came to Paris, until after 1721,\r\nthe date of his death.\r\n\r\nThere was the troupe of Madame Jeanne Godefroy, widow of Maurice Von\r\nder Beck, from 1694 to 1709; that of Christopher Selles, from 1701\r\nto 1709; that of Louis Nivelon (who, by the way, was a theatrical\r\nvisitor to London), from 1707 to 1771; that of Saint-Edmé from 1711\r\nto 1718; and, most important of all, that of Constantini, known as\r\nOctave, from 1712 to 1716.\r\n\r\nThus from the time he arrived in Paris Watteau could, for a few\r\npence, have seen any of these companies, and in view of the fact\r\nthat the first thing any young man up from the country usually does\r\nis to see the “sights” of the town, and more especially in view of\r\nthe fact that soon after his arrival Watteau was in the studio of\r\nGillot--popular engraver of such popular subjects, and himself a\r\nlover of the stage--what was more probable than that Antoine _did_\r\ninclude the Theatres of the Fair among the sights he saw, and so was\r\ninfluenced to choose, as some of the earlier subjects of his brush,\r\nthe Italian players he _could_ see there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWATTEAU’S DEBT TO THE STAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stage has from time to time been indebted to Watteau for costume\r\nand _décor_. But Watteau’s debt to the stage of his period, to the\r\nOpera, to the Italian Comedy, and to the Theatres of the Fair, has\r\nhardly been considered sufficiently. Here is not the place to bring\r\nforward all the evidence that could be produced. Only an indication\r\nof some of the leading possibilities can be given. But while the\r\nsubject has an interest of its own, on the purely critical side, it\r\nis also of interest to students of the ballet, for they may trace in\r\nsome of the famous French pictures of the early eighteenth century\r\nthe influence of ballet on contemporary art. Again, history “repeats\r\nitself” to-day, for have not many artists of our own time found\r\ninspiration in many of the productions of the Russian ballet?\r\n\r\nIt is interesting first to compare Watteau’s picture of “L’Amour au\r\nThéâtre Italien” with the reproductions given here from an old volume\r\nin my possession, Riccoboni’s _Histoire du Théâtre Italien_, which\r\nwas not published until six years after Watteau’s death, but which\r\nmay be regarded as a contemporary work since it describes the stage\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nThese prints represent the various types of the Italian comedy as\r\nthey were actually costumed, and comparing these with the figures in\r\nWatteau’s group, one sees in their close resemblance proof that the\r\nmaster was painting from things seen, from life itself (albeit stage\r\nlife), not some graceful creations of his own imagination, as some\r\nof us to-day have been too apt to think.\r\n\r\nIn “L’Amour au Théâtre Italien” we have a faithful record of\r\ncostumes actually worn; but the whole attitude of the group of\r\nfigures suggests something vastly more than merely an artist’s study\r\nof costume. The figures are alert, the moment dramatic. Something\r\nis happening, or rather has happened, and there is a suggestion\r\nof culmination, as if the interruption of a song by the entry of\r\na character had called forth, or was about to call forth, some\r\nwhimsical comment from Pierrot, the singer. It seems a captured\r\nmoment in a comedy.\r\n\r\nComparing it with the obviously companion picture, “L’Amour au\r\nThéâtre Français,” one might well be somewhat puzzled by the title,\r\nsince in neither is there any apparent love-scene taking place. The\r\none suggests an interruption in a comedy, the other--a dance in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nBeneath the engravings of these two by C. N. Cochin in the Jullienne\r\ncollection, however, are inscribed a couple of six-line stanzas, one\r\nbeneath each, in which the treatment of love themes in Italian and\r\nFrench comedies respectively is contrasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     L’AMOUR AU THÉÂTRE FRANÇAIS\r\n\r\n        “L’amour badine en France; il se montre un grand jour\r\n         Il ne prend point de masque, il se parle sans detour;\r\n         Il vit dans les festins, aux plaisir il s’allie,\r\n         C’est une liberté que le noeud qui nous lie\r\n         Nous servons sans constrainte e Bacchus e l’Amour.\r\n         Et nos tristes voisins nous taxent de folie.\r\n\r\n                                                             M. ROY.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     L’AMOUR AU THÉÂTRE ITALIEN\r\n\r\n      “La jalouse Italie effrayante les amours,\r\n       Les fait marcher de nuit, les constraint au mistère\r\n       Mais une Serenade y supplie aux discours;\r\n       Un geste, un sel regard conclud on rompt d’Affaire,\r\n       L’impatient Francois en intrigue préfere,\r\n       Des chemins moins couverts, les croyée--vous plus courts?\r\n\r\n                                                             M. ROY.”\r\n\r\nThese stanzas are by Roy, a contemporary poet who was a librettist\r\nfor the Opera, two of whose operas were produced in 1712.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, that Watteau’s own eyes must have noted the\r\ncontrast between the Italian and French comedy to have painted such\r\npictures. He could not have painted them without being an observant\r\ntheatre-goer. What, then, did he see, and when could he have seen\r\nsuch productions as might suggest such works? While acknowledging\r\nthat positive evidence is still to be sought, I cannot help feeling\r\nthat these two pictures, and one or two others, could fairly safely\r\nbe placed as work done about 1711-1712.\r\n\r\nIn 1709 Antoine, still with Audran at the Luxembourg, competed for\r\nentry, and was admitted with four other students, for the Academy.\r\nThen he left Paris for Valenciennes, defraying expenses by selling a\r\nmilitary picture, “Départ des Troupes,” to the dealer, Sirois, who\r\nurged him to paint a similar picture, which he did at Valenciennes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’Amour au Théâtre Italien]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’Amour au Théâtre Français\r\n\r\n(_From the Jullienne engravings from Watteau, British Museum_).]\r\n\r\nThere is no direct evidence that Watteau painted any stage-pictures\r\n_before_ this period; and it would seem that his work in the country\r\nwas mainly on military and naturalistic subjects. We _do_ know that\r\nhe was again in Paris at a date uncertain in 1712, and went to live\r\nwith a Monsieur Crozat, by whom he was engaged to paint a series of\r\npanels of The Seasons. It is extremely likely that he would have\r\nreturned to Paris refreshed by his country sojourn and with a new\r\nzest for work, _and_ for theatre-going, which was then beginning to\r\nbe particularly interesting, a crisis in the Fair Theatre troubles\r\nbeing over by 1710, and some new productions there as well as at\r\nthe opera being well worth seeing.\r\n\r\nAs I would trace his movements, still admitting that positive\r\nevidence is required, Watteau returned to Paris early in 1711, took\r\nup his quarters for a time with Sirois the dealer, who would have the\r\ndisposing of work done at Valenciennes. One of his first pictures\r\nof this period was probably “Gilles and his Family,” in the Wallace\r\ncollection, which is supposed to be a portrait of Sirois dressed as\r\na Pierrot or Gilles (the names being synonymous at the period) in a\r\ncostume supplied by Watteau’s own wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThen would come visits to the Fairs of St. Germain and St. Laurent,\r\nwhence he would return reinspired with a love for the gay, reckless,\r\nsatiric Italian comedy.\r\n\r\nOne has only to compare the Hertford House “Gilles” with the central\r\nfigure of Pierrot in the “L’Amour au Théâtre Italien” to see that one\r\nis an earlier work and is the figure of a man somewhat self-conscious\r\nand not quite used to the clothes he is wearing; the other a maturer\r\nwork, representing a vivid impression of a born comedian, momentarily\r\nmaster of the scene. Doubtless at this time, too, would be done some,\r\nbut only some, of the remaining works dealing with the Italian stage\r\ntypes, such as “Les Jaloux,” “Arlequin Jaloux,” “Comédiens Italiens,”\r\nand “Pierrot Content.” A little after, I think, would come such works\r\nas “Arlequin et Colombine,” (in the Wallace collection), “Mezzetin,”\r\nand the maturer “Gilles,” in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nIn 1712 there were at the Theatres of the Fair in Paris two famous\r\nplayers of Gilles or Pierrot, namely, Hamoche, who made his _début_\r\nin that year with the St. Edmé troupe; and Belloni, who was also a\r\nlemonade-seller, quite a popular character, notable, as one chronicle\r\ntells us, “for the grand simplicity of his acting and for his naïve\r\nand truthful speech.”\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the players of Arlequin was Pierre-François\r\n(otherwise Domenique) Biancolelli, who was also of the St. Edmé\r\ntroupe, somewhere between 1710-1712.\r\n\r\nThus it was not unlikely that Watteau saw these actors, as he may\r\nhave seen another, Delaplace, as Scaramouche, and Desgranges, who\r\ncame to Paris from Lyons, in 1712, as “the Doctor”; though the\r\nMezzetin offers a minor problem in that Angelo Constantini, the most\r\nfamous impersonator of the character, after suffering banishment with\r\nthe Italian comedians in 1697, went to Poland, where an intrigue\r\nwith the Queen resulted in his imprisonment for twenty years, by\r\nwhich time Watteau was no more. Him, therefore, Watteau cannot have\r\nseen. But the character was a familiar one on the stage at the time,\r\n1710-1712, and must have been played by other popular actors, even if\r\nnot of sufficient note to be chronicled.\r\n\r\nTo turn from the Italian actors to other theatrical characters which\r\nform the subjects of some of Watteau’s pictures, it is of interest\r\nto note that one of the engravings in the Jullienne collection\r\nrepresents “Poisson en habit de paysan.” Poisson was a familiar\r\nname in the annals of the French stage, for it was borne by three\r\ngenerations of Parisian actors, Raymond Poisson, who died in\r\n1690, Paul, his son, and François, grandson. Watteau’s picture is\r\npresumably that of the second, Paul.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point to note is that a portrait of Raymond\r\nPoisson, painted by Netscher, was engraved by Edelinck (who was\r\nemployed by Watteau’s employer--Audran) and represents the actor\r\nin the character of Crispin, one of his most famous parts (that of\r\na sort of black-dressed Pierrot, a messenger distinguished by his\r\nlong boots, worn by Raymond Poisson to increase his stature), which\r\nwas successively played by his son Paul, and grandson François, and\r\nbecame a traditional type.\r\n\r\nWatteau cannot have seen Raymond, who died twelve years before the\r\nartist came to Paris, but he may well have seen Paul, and it is\r\nsignificant that he should have drawn a figure representing _not_\r\n“_Poisson en habit de Crispin_” (whose costume was now a tradition)\r\nbut “_en habit de Paysan_” as if it was the very fact that the part\r\nwas one different from that especially associated with the Poisson\r\nfamily which made it of interest to Watteau.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the same portrait there is one point that is\r\nparticularly noteworthy, namely, _that it is exactly like the central\r\nfigure in “Le Concert,” or “Les Charmes de la Vie” in the Wallace\r\ncollection_; and close consideration of the latter inclines me to the\r\nbelief that the picture represents--as certain others not unusually\r\nso considered may well do--a scene from an opera.\r\n\r\nAnother of the engravings in the Jullienne collection of “Mdlle.\r\nDesmares en habit de Pelerine.” Mlle. Desmares was a well-known\r\nDanish actress; and “pelerines” appear in Watteau’s “L’Embarquement\r\npour l’Ile de Cythère.”\r\n\r\nOne has only to pass in review a succession of Watteau’s works, or\r\nreproductions thereof, to notice how very frequently he repeats\r\nhimself in matters of detail. In a general way, for instance, it is\r\ncurious to note how frequently dancing and music are repeated in\r\nthe course of his life’s work. In “L’Amour au Théâtre Français” is\r\na couple dancing; in the “Bal sous une Colonnade” another; in “Le\r\nContrat de Mariage” and its variants--another, and very similar; in\r\n“Le Menuet” (at the Hermitage, Petrograd) another; in “Amusements\r\nChampêtres” (Chantilly), and in the “Fêtes Vénitiennes” (Edinburgh)\r\nare more such couples; while there is, of course, the dainty single\r\nfigure of the child in “La Danse,” in the Royal Palace, Potsdam; and\r\nthe famous “L’Indifférent,” in the Louvre, also represents a young\r\nman dancing. Dancers and musicians are thus a constant theme for\r\nWatteau’s brush.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, more distinctive and more curious repetitions\r\nto note than these obvious evidences of a general taste for music\r\nand the dance; the repetitions of figures or groups in particular\r\npositions, and of details in _mise en scène_.\r\n\r\nThe well-known “Joueur de Guitare,” in the Musée Condé, reappears\r\n_in almost exact facsimile_ in “La Surprise” (in Buckingham Palace)\r\nand also in the “Fête Galante,” or “Fête Champêtre,” in the Royal\r\nGallery, Dresden.\r\n\r\nThe couple in “La Gamme d’Amour” is simply a detail from the centre\r\nof the “Assemblée dans un Parc,” in the Royal Gallery at Berlin. The\r\nmusician in “La Leçon de Musique” (Wallace collection) is repeated in\r\n“Le Concert,” also in the Wallace collection.\r\n\r\nTo turn now to details of _mise en scène_, it is curious to note that\r\nthe pillars seen in the last-named picture also occur in the “Bal\r\nsous une Colonnade,” in the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe reclining statue to the right of the picture, known as “Les\r\nChamps Elysées,” in the Wallace collection, is another, presumably an\r\nearlier version of the “Jupiter and Antiope,” in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe statuette and amorini in the “Fête d’Amour” at the Dresden Royal\r\nGallery are variants of those in the “Embarquement pour l’Ile de\r\nCythère”; while the terminal statue of Pan seen in the “Arlequin et\r\nColombine,” in the Wallace collection, reappears again and again in\r\nthe Italian Comedy series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Le Concert\r\n\r\n(_From the painting by Watteau, Wallace Collection_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La Leçon de Musique\r\n\r\n(_From the painting by Watteau, Wallace Collection_).]\r\n\r\nTo some, unaware, perhaps, of the influence which the stage of\r\nWatteau’s time was exerting in other directions, these comparisons\r\nmay possibly seem unnecessary. But in considering the extent to which\r\nthat influence may have expressed itself in the painter’s work, it\r\nis just these details which, taken in conjunction with the trend of\r\ntheatrical taste at that time, are likely to be of importance. There\r\nwas never an artist yet--whether in colour, sound, or spoken or\r\nwritten word--who created a new world out of nothing. The spirit\r\nof art can only find its expression in the manipulation of existing\r\nmaterial. Every work of art must surely be the culmination of a long\r\nseries of impulses due to external stimuli the connection of which,\r\nperhaps over a lengthy period, consciousness has failed to analyse\r\nand memory to record.\r\n\r\nNow Watteau’s work as a whole exhibits the frequent repetition of\r\ncertain _motifs_, but they were never of something he can never\r\nhave seen in reality. It was not automatic reiteration of some\r\npictured or imagined type, group or material object. His earliest\r\nimpressions of stage-life, it is true, may well have been those\r\nconveyed by the prints or paintings of his master Gillot. But there\r\nwas _no necessity_ for him to subsist for the rest of his life for\r\ninspiration on second-hand impressions.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we find in works _other_ than those avowedly\r\ntheatrical, a repetition of certain details which _are_ found in\r\nthose dealings obviously with the theatre, it may be conceded,\r\nperhaps, that the direct influence of stage scenes and stage effects\r\nupon his art was somewhat more extensive than might be thought\r\nmerely from a study of those pictures which are ostensibly studies\r\nof dramatic types and subjects; and for an instance we may take the\r\nintroduction of a group of Italian comedians among the bystanders in\r\nthe “Bal sous une Colonnade,” already referred to. They need a little\r\nlooking for amid so many figures, but when discovered one might\r\nquestion what Pierrot, Arlequin and their fellows are doing “dans\r\ncette galère.”\r\n\r\nWhen we come, again, to consider the picture called “Le Concert” (in\r\nthe Wallace Collection) and find, in the central figure, a striking\r\nlikeness to another picture by Watteau of “Poisson” in the costume\r\nof a peasant: and observe also a repetition of a scenic detail such\r\nas the terrace-columns, which are similar to those of the Colonnade:\r\nfurther noting that the treatment of the distance between these\r\nsame columns is strangely suggestive of the flatness of a stage\r\n“back-cloth,” it begins to seem not improbable that we have here a\r\npretty faithful translation of actual stage scenes.\r\n\r\nIn one of these, the “Fêtes Champêtres,” also known as “Les Fêtes\r\nVénitiennes” (in the National Gallery, Edinburgh), it is possible\r\nthat we have a clue.\r\n\r\nCan it be mere coincidence that from 1710--the year after Watteau had\r\nbecome a student at the Academy--one of the most popular and most\r\nfrequently revived ballets at the Opera was Campra and Danchet’s “Les\r\nFêtes Vénitiennes?”\r\n\r\nTrue, Watteau must be presumed to have been at Valenciennes from\r\nabout the end of 1709 until shortly before 1712, when he took up his\r\nabode with Crozat, but the ballet was revived again _in_ 1712; not to\r\nmention a _pastiche_ called “Fragments de Lulli,” which included an\r\n_entrée_ entitled “La Vénitienne,” produced in January, 1711, which,\r\nas has already been suggested, was the more likely time than 1712 for\r\nWatteau’s return to town after his stay at Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nAt this time, in any case, there were several productions at the\r\nOpera which may have easily proved an influence in the thoughts of\r\nan impressionable young artist. It was in 1712 that two operas were\r\nproduced, namely, “Créüse l’Athénienne” and “Callirhoé,” the libretti\r\nof which were by Roy, whose stanzas form the inscriptions already\r\nreferred to as appearing under the engravings of “L’Amour au Théâtre\r\nFrançais” and “L’Amour au Théâtre Italien.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the few of Watteau’s letters quoted by the Goncourts is\r\none to Gersaint in which Antoine accepts an invitation to go “avec\r\nAntoine de la Roque,” and dine next day. It is not insignificant that\r\nthe first opera of which De la Roque was librettist was produced in\r\nApril, 1713, and entitled “Médée et Jason.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Les Plaisirs du Bal\r\n\r\n(_From the Jullienne engravings from Watteau, British Museum_).]\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to “Les Fêtes Vénitiennes.” The score of this\r\nballet, or rather “opera-ballet,” was published by the great French\r\nprinter Ballard in 1714, and an examination of it reveals further\r\npossibilities of its having influenced not only the picture of\r\nthe same name, but the “Bal sous une Colonnade,” “Le Concert,”\r\nand possibly others of Watteau’s composition, just as yet others\r\nmight have been partly inspired by Monteclair’s ballet “Les Fêtes\r\nde l’Eté,” published in 1716, and Bertin’s “Les Plaisirs de la\r\nCampagne,” published in 1719.\r\n\r\n“Les Fêtes Vénitiennes” was in four acts or _entrées_, with a\r\nprologue. The third act was entitled “De l’Opéra,” and opens with a\r\nmusic-lesson, practically the rehearsal of a duet between Léontine,\r\nthe prima-donna, and her music master, just before the production\r\nof a miniature opera; and the fourth is headed “Du Bal.” The stage\r\ndirections for this are: “_Le Théâtre représente un lieu préparé pour\r\nun Bal_”; and in a bragging duel between the music-master and the\r\ndancing-master the latter boasts:\r\n\r\n               “Je scais l’art de tracer aux yeux\r\n                Les sons qui frappent les oreilles,”\r\n\r\nwhich the other counters by saying that he can raise a storm\r\nmusically, which he proceeds to do, giving a musical representation\r\nof the rising wind, of thunder, and so on. This, however, is by\r\nthe way. The one thing important is that there _are_ these two\r\nacts devoted to illustrating the charms of music and the dance,\r\nthat the opera contains an “air pour les Arlequins,” an “air des\r\nPolichinelles,” an “air Champêtre,” and closes, as several other\r\nballets of the period also did, with a sort of _divertissement_,\r\nintroducing the Italian players, and a general gathering of all\r\nthe _dramatis personæ_ on the stage while the dances of this\r\n_divertissement final_ are in progress; all of which suggests the\r\n“Bal sous une Colonnade” of Watteau.\r\n\r\nMonteclair’s “Les Fêtes de l’Eté” is of special interest in that\r\nit was produced in 1716. In 1717 Watteau, after requests from the\r\nAcademy authorities, painted his diploma picture, the immortal\r\n“Embarquement pour Cythère.” It would seem that Monteclair’s ballet\r\ncontains the first suggestions which culminated in that picture.\r\n\r\nIt is in three acts, with a prologue, and the stage directions for\r\nthis are: “_Le Théâtre représente une Campagne dont les beautés\r\ncommencent à fletrir: Le Printemps y paroit environné d’Amants et\r\nAmantes qui lui font la cour._” In the course of the act one of the\r\nlovers, expatiating on this charm of their surroundings, sings: “_Et\r\nla mère du Dieu des Amants a quitté Cythère pour ces lieux charmés._”\r\n\r\nThe second act has the following stage directions at the start: “_Le\r\nThéâtre représente un relais de chasse, on y voit un char doré,\r\nune Meute et une partie de l’equipage des Chasseurs._” One of the\r\ncharacters introduced is a young man, Lisidor, who is remarkable for\r\nhis indifference to feminine charms, and might well be the origin\r\nof Watteau’s exquisite “L’Indifférent.” Another of the characters,\r\nDorante, is counselled to imitate him; and in a discussion between\r\nAgatine and Cephise, the former is advised by the latter “_pour\r\ns’assurer de ce qu’on aime, la feinte indifférence est d’un puissant\r\nsecours_.”\r\n\r\nIn 1730, by the way, a play was produced at the theatre of the St.\r\nLaurent Fair called “L’Indifférence,” in which the hero preaches the\r\ndoctrine of indifference to love! Watteau, of course, cannot have\r\nseen this play, but it is significant that both in 1716 and 1730, the\r\nstage should be found dealing with what was evidently a current type\r\nof character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mlle. Desmares en habit de Pèlerine\r\n\r\n(_From the Jullienne engravings from Watteau, British Museum_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’Embarquement pour l’Ile de Cythère\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph, by E. Alinari, of Watteau’s painting in the\r\nLouvre_).]\r\n\r\nIn the third act of Monteclair’s ballet, the opening directions are:\r\n“_Le Théâtre représente les Rives de la Seine. On voit le soleil prêt\r\nà se coucher_” (which might possibly account for the soft, warm tone\r\nof Watteau’s Embarquement) and one of the characters comes to warn\r\nsome lovers with a song: “_Tendres amants, la Barque est prête_”;\r\nand the ballet concludes with a _dance divertissement_, as was usual\r\nat the period.\r\n\r\nOne cannot dogmatically assert that these operas _did_ directly\r\ninspire the pictures named, but that Watteau caught his first\r\nsuggestion of some from such performances as his own taste and his\r\nassociation with a theatrical and musical set would have led him to\r\nfrequent, must seem, at the least, probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_THE SPECTATOR_ AND MR. WEAVER\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Anne had long been dead, but she can never have been very\r\nlively when alive, for her period was one when political intrigue,\r\ntheological controversy, and the War of Spanish Succession were\r\nthe chief subjects that occupied everybody’s attention, especially\r\nher own, and--could anything be duller? Moreover, she was of\r\nsomewhat portly proportions, had a solemn husband, and--unlike Queen\r\nElizabeth--was really no dancer.\r\n\r\nWith such a queen on the throne, at such a time of stress, can it\r\nbe wondered at that theatrical dancing was at a comparatively low\r\nebb? Why, there were only two theatres, Drury Lane and Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields! and they were striving hard to outdo each other--in dullness.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was not until practically the close of Queen Anne’s reign\r\nthat stage-dancing began to come to its own; for though the craze for\r\npantomimes (and his importation of French dancers) started by John\r\nRich in Anne’s last year, were mainly responsible for this, I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that Steele and Addison’s ever lively _Spectator_,\r\ntogether with the works of Mr. John Weaver, had considerable effect\r\nin rousing the attention of playgoers as to the possibilities of\r\ndancing on the stage; for while there are four papers in _The\r\nSpectator_ in which dancing as a _social_ accomplishment is\r\ndiscussed, Steele, in one of them, makes the interesting suggestion\r\nthat “It would be a great improvement, as well as embellishment to\r\nthe theatre, if dancing were more regarded, and taught to all the\r\nactors”; and another calls special attention to _An Essay towards\r\nan History of Dancing_, by John Weaver (a 12mo. volume published\r\nin 1712), who was also author of a very interesting _History of\r\nPantomimes_. These literary efforts cannot have been without their\r\ninfluence on current taste in things theatrical.\r\n\r\nBefore the appearance of _The Spectator_, however, Addison had made\r\namusing reference to a dancing-master in one of his papers for _The\r\nTatler_. The date is 1709. He heads it as written “From my own\r\nApartment, October 31,” and goes on: “I was this morning awakened by\r\na sudden shake of the house; and as soon as I had got a little out of\r\nmy consternation, I felt another, which was followed by two or three\r\nrepetitions of the same convulsion. I got up as fast as possible,\r\ngirt on my rapier, and snatched up my hat, when my landlady came up\r\nto me and told me that the gentlewoman of the next house begged me to\r\nstep thither, for that a lodger she had taken in was run mad; and she\r\ndesired my advice; as indeed everybody in the whole lane does upon\r\nimportant occasions,” he slyly adds.\r\n\r\nWith much detail and delightful humour Addison goes on to describe\r\nhis adventure, at greater length than can be given here. Suffice it\r\nto say that he went in next door and upstairs, “with my hand upon the\r\nhilt of my rapier and approached this new lodger’s door. I looked\r\nin at the keyhole and there I saw a well-made man look with great\r\nattention at a book and, on a sudden, jump into the air so high that\r\nhis head almost touched the ceiling. He came down safe on his right\r\nfoot, and again flew up, alighting on his left; then looked again at\r\nhis book and, holding out his right leg, put it into such a quivering\r\nmotion that I thought he would have shaken it off.”\r\n\r\nEventually, of course, he discovers the lodger is a dancing-master,\r\nand on asking to see the book he is studying Addison “could not make\r\nanything of it.” Whereupon the _maître_ explains that he had been\r\nreading a dance or two ... “which had been written by one who taught\r\nat an academy in France,” adding the interesting comment “that now\r\narticulate motions, as well as sounds, were expressed by proper\r\ncharacters; and that there is nothing so common as to communicate\r\na dance by a letter.” Ultimately Addison begs him to practise in a\r\nground-room, and returns to his own residence “meditating on the\r\nvarious occupations of rational creatures.”\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the later publication, _The Spectator_, in\r\nwhich Addison was also assisted by Steele and other writers of such\r\nvaried character as Motteaux (debauchee, tea-merchant and translator\r\nof _Don Quixote_), Ambrose Philips (whom Swift nicknamed “Namby\r\nPamby”), and Isaac Watts--the famous hymn-writer. In a comparatively\r\nearly number a short note introduces in very learned fashion a\r\nquaint letter purporting to be from “some substantial tradesman\r\nabout ‘Change,’” in which the writer grows querulous over the way in\r\nwhich his daughter (who “has for some time been under the tuition of\r\nMonsieur Rigadoon, a dancing-master in the city”), has been taught to\r\nbehave at a ball he takes her to.\r\n\r\nWith some of the dancing the old man is delighted, as he is with the\r\nart generally, but presently he has to complain: “But as the best\r\ninstitutions are liable to corruptions, so, sir, I must acquaint\r\nyou that very great abuses are crept into this entertainment. I was\r\namazed to see my girl handed by and handing young fellows with so\r\nmuch familiarity,” and he finds that fault especially with “a most\r\nimpudent step called ‘Setting.’”\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that the good citizen was shocked\r\nby a dance that was probably quite innocuous, and only seemed to\r\nsuggest a familiarity of behaviour unusual to his prim eyes, viewing\r\na ball-room for the first time.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of one issue of _The Spectator_ is taken up with a\r\nletter from John Weaver, to whom Steele gives a fine advertisement by\r\nnot only printing the letter _in extenso_, but introducing it with\r\nsapient comments from himself. One point he makes somewhat recalls to\r\nmind the complaint of Arbeau’s young friend, the law-student Capriol,\r\nwho had grown dusty over his studies.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of dancing, Steele says: “I know a gentleman of great\r\nabilities, who bewailed the want of this part of his education to\r\nthe end of a very honourable life. He observed that there was not\r\noccasion for the common use of _great_ talents; that they are but\r\nseldom in demand; and that these very great talents were often\r\nrendered useless to a man for want of small attainments.” One can\r\nhardly perhaps consider dancing to-day as a “small attainment,”\r\nhowever it may have been considered in the reign of Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nWeaver’s own letter is too long to quote in its entirety, but I\r\ncannot refrain from giving at least the following, since, while\r\nspeaking of his own work, he offers incidentally several peculiarly\r\ninteresting glimpses as to the state of the art in 1712.\r\n\r\n  “MR. SPECTATOR,\r\n\r\n      “Since there are scarce any of the arts or sciences that have\r\n  not been recommended to the world by the pens of some of the\r\n  professors, masters, or lovers of them, whereby the usefulness,\r\n  excellence, and benefit arising from them, both as to the\r\n  speculative and practical part, have been made public, to the great\r\n  advantage and improvement of such arts and sciences; _why should\r\n  dancing, an art celebrated by the ancients in so extraordinary a\r\n  manner, be totally neglected by the moderns, and left destitute of\r\n  any pen to recommend its various excellencies and substantial merit\r\n  to mankind?_\r\n\r\n  “_The low ebb to which dancing is now fallen_ is altogether owing\r\n  to this silence. _The art is esteemed only as an amusing trifle_;\r\n  it lies altogether uncultivated, and is unhappily fallen under the\r\n  imputation of being illiterate and ‘mechanic.’ And as Terence, in\r\n  one of his prologues, complains of the rope-dancers drawing all the\r\n  spectators from his play; so may we well say, that capering and\r\n  tumbling is now preferred to, and _supplies the place of, just and\r\n  regular dancing in our theatres_. It is, therefore, in my opinion,\r\n  high time that someone should come to its assistance and relieve it\r\n  from the many gross and growing errors that have crept into it, and\r\n  overcast its real beauties; and to set dancing in its true light,\r\n  would show the usefulness and elegance of it, with the pleasure and\r\n  instruction produced from it; and also lay down some fundamental\r\n  rules, that might so tend to the improvement of its professors, and\r\n  information of the spectators, that the first might be the better\r\n  enabled to perform, and the latter rendered more capable of judging\r\n  what is (if there be anything) valuable in this art.\r\n\r\n  “To encourage, therefore, some ingenious pen capable of so generous\r\n  an undertaking, and in some measure to relieve dancing from the\r\n  disadvantages it at present lies under, I, who teach to dance,\r\n  have attempted a small treatise as an _Essay towards an History of\r\n  Dancing_; in which I have enquired into its antiquity, origin and\r\n  use, and shown what esteem the ancients had for it. I have likewise\r\n  considered the nature and perfection of all its several parts, and\r\n  how beneficial and delightful it is, both as a qualification and\r\n  an exercise; and endeavoured to answer all objections that have\r\n  been maliciously raised against it. I have proceeded to give an\r\n  account of the particular dances of the Greeks and Romans, whether\r\n  religious, war-like or civil; and taken particular notice of\r\n  that part of dancing relating to the ancient stage in which the\r\n  pantomimes had so great a share. Nor have I been wanting in giving\r\n  an historical account of some particular masters excellent in that\r\n  surprising art; after which I have advanced some observations on\r\n  the modern dancing, both as to the stage, and that part of it\r\n  so absolutely necessary for the qualification of gentlemen and\r\n  ladies; and have concluded with some short remarks on the origin\r\n  and progress of the character by which dances are writ down, and\r\n  communicated to one master from another. _If some great genius\r\n  after this would arise, and advance this art to that perfection it\r\n  seems capable of receiving, what might not be expected from it._”\r\n\r\nAll modern students of dancing will be interested especially in the\r\npassages I have italicised in the foregoing excerpt, for one gets\r\na significant glimpse as to the state of theatrical dancing (they\r\nhad no native _ballet_) in London during the reign of Anne; such a\r\ncontrast to Paris, where Louis XIV’s _Académie Royale de la Danse_\r\nwas beginning to bring forth “rare and refreshing” fruit and the\r\nBallet was beginning to be understood as a genuine work of art.\r\n\r\n“The art is esteemed only as an amusing trifle!” In an earlier paper\r\nhad not “Mr. Spectator” introduced the subject with a little apology\r\nfor dealing at all with a reputedly trivial theme, and had he not\r\nbacked himself up with scholarly reference to classic writers on the\r\nDance, such as Lucian?\r\n\r\nOh! Anne! That the art should have been, in your reign, “esteemed\r\nonly as an amusing trifle!” And when you might have followed a royal\r\nexample and, emulating your contemporary Louis, ennobled the art by\r\nfounding an English “Royal Academy of Dancing.”\r\n\r\nWell, Weaver, at any rate, knew that the art was something more than\r\nan “amusing trifle” when he wrote almost prophetically: “If some\r\ngreat genius after this would arise and advance this art to that\r\nperfection it seems capable of receiving, what might not be expected\r\nfrom it.” What would he have said had he lived to see the triumphs of\r\nNoverre, of Blasis, and of the British, French or the Russian Ballet\r\nof modern times?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA FRENCH DANCER IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the state of dancing in England was nothing to\r\nboast of in the early eighteenth century. We have seen that London\r\nhad not yet what Paris had had some fifty years--State-aided Opera\r\nand Ballet.\r\n\r\nBut the public appreciation of art was there all the same, and an\r\nastute manager of that day was as capable of realising, quite as\r\nwell as any modern, that where there was no home supply it might be\r\nprofitable to import foreign talent.\r\n\r\nStrange, is it not, that there was not then, any more than to-day,\r\nanyone clever enough, apparently, to realise that since foreign\r\ntalent would prove attractive to a dance and spectacle-loving\r\npublic (had not the English proved their innate love of spectacle\r\nin Elizabethan times?) it _might be less expensive and still more\r\nprofitable, to encourage native talent_. Still that is our way.\r\nWe let the foreign artist discover England, and then discover the\r\nforeign artist. We never seem to discover ourselves. We shirk the\r\nhorrible revelation that the English really are an artistic, an\r\nart-loving nation. But whatsoever the foreigner may have or have\r\nhad against us, he can never accuse us of lack of enthusiasm, of\r\nindifference to his efforts to please.\r\n\r\nIn the early eighteenth century--French actors, dancers, and\r\nacrobats; in the later eighteenth and mid-nineteenth--Italian\r\nopera singers and ballet; in the later nineteenth--light French\r\nOpera (at the Criterion, Gaiety and Opera Comique); and in the\r\ntwentieth--Russian Opera and Ballet; these London has had, and more,\r\nand always greeted with generous praise and enthusiastic approval.\r\nWhatsoever may be said of the English as a nation of “shopkeepers”\r\nslow to adopt new ideas, there is nothing small or hesitating about\r\ntheir adoption and praise of foreign art and artists; and so it was\r\nthat the delectable French dancer Mlle. Marie Sallé, one of the two\r\nchief pupils of the famous Prévôt, found a warm welcome when she\r\nvisited London in the reign of George I.\r\n\r\nMlle. Sallé, born in 1707, was the daughter of one minor theatrical\r\nmanager, niece of another, and made her first appearance at the age\r\nof eleven in an opera-comique by Le Sage--author of the lively “Gil\r\nBlas”--entitled “La Princesse de Carisme,” at the St. Laurent Fair,\r\nin Paris, in 1718. She spent the next few years in touring, or, when\r\nnot on tour, in playing at the Fair theatres in Paris. It is just\r\npossible that Watteau may have seen her as a young girl at the Fair\r\ntheatres before he died in 1721. That, however, though pleasant\r\nto contemplate as a possibility, is less our concern than the\r\ncircumstances of her _début_, and her subsequent appearance in London.\r\n\r\n“La Princesse de Carisme,” a romantic-satirical, three-act musical\r\ncomedy, dealt with the love-affairs and adventures of a Persian\r\nPrince and his boon companion and “confident”--Arlequin. There was\r\nsome charming music in it, and so great was its success at the\r\ntheatre of the St. Laurent Fair that it was put on at the Opera in\r\nParis by Royal command.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1718, it will be remembered, old Christopher Rich had\r\ndied, leaving his theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields in London to his\r\nson John Rich, who made himself famous and increased his wealth\r\nby producing the first pantomimes ever seen in the great metropolis,\r\nwhich were mounted on the stage with all the attractions of gorgeous\r\nscenery and dresses, grand “mechanical effects,” appropriate music,\r\nand striking ballets; the various acts of the spectacle being\r\ninterspersed with a comic or serio-comic element, supplied by the\r\neternal love-affairs of Arlequin and Columbine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marie Sallé\r\n\r\n(_From an engraving by Petit after a picture by Fenouil_).]\r\n\r\nThis form of entertainment became so popular as to rival seriously\r\nthe power of London’s two chief theatres, Drury Lane and Haymarket,\r\nmainly through Rich’s enterprise in securing all the best\r\nopera-singers, dancers, acrobats and other performers from the\r\nContinent. In fact, he may fairly be described as London’s earliest\r\nmusic-hall manager, for the entertainment provided at the Lincoln’s\r\nInn Fields theatre was much like that of a modern variety house. It\r\nwas thus he came to engage Mlle. Sallé and her brother, who made\r\ntheir first appearance here as dancers in an English comedy, “Love’s\r\nLast Shift,” in October, 1725.\r\n\r\nNext year also they appeared in London, and in April, 1727, Mlle.\r\nSallé was given a complimentary benefit, in which she and her brother\r\nintroduced some of their youthful pupils. In that same year she made\r\nher _début_ at the Paris Opera, where she remained till, for some\r\nobscure reason, she broke therefrom, and in October returned to\r\nLondon, once more under John Rich’s management.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the break may have been that professional jealousy did\r\nnot give her the place which her talents should have justified; or\r\nmay have been over the question of costume-reform, which was a matter\r\nof burning interest to some of the younger spirits in those days.\r\nOr it may have been merely as the result of managerial changes at\r\nthe Opera in 1728. But whatsoever the reason, what Paris lost London\r\ngained, and her greatest triumph here came at the end of 1733, when\r\nshe made her first appearance at Covent Garden, following it up with\r\nstill greater success in the spring of the following year, when she\r\nachieved a striking success in a classic ballet, “Pygmalion,” in\r\nmore or less correct costume, instead of in the absurdly befrilled\r\ngarb, with laced cuirasse, powdered hair and plumed helmets, which\r\nwere considered _de rigueur_ on the stage at that absurdly artificial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nMarie Sallé was not only a dancer of exquisite lightness and grace,\r\nshe was a woman of taste and sense, and, forestalling Noverre’s fight\r\non the same ground, had tried to bring about costume-reform at the\r\n_Académie Royale_ in Paris, only to find that those in authority were\r\nstrong in--authority, _and_ convention! She rejoiced, therefore, in a\r\nreturn to London, that gave her more scope for the expression of her\r\nartistic ideas, and two ballets of her own composition, “Pygmalion”\r\n(February, 1734) and “Bacchus et Ariane” (March, 1734), were mounted\r\nwith more regard for classic feeling. Her appearance in both caused\r\na furore. Royalty came to Covent Garden on the nights she danced.\r\nThe whole town flocked to see her, and numerous duels were fought by\r\nardent young gentlemen who trod on each other’s toes when jammed in\r\nthe crowds that endeavoured to enter the theatre.\r\n\r\nMlle. Sallé must have been a woman of character. In a loose era she\r\nwas cordially detested by her stage colleagues in Paris for her\r\nvirtue! It was such a reflection on them that one should not be as\r\nthey!\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of her is revealed in a significant little anecdote.\r\nThe great Handel, having admired her in Paris, had offered her three\r\nthousand francs to appear at Covent Garden, and specially composed\r\nfor her a ballet, “Terpsichore.” Hearing of this, Porpora, Handel’s\r\ngreat rival and manager of the King’s Theatre, Haymarket, promptly\r\noffered her three thousand guineas, and had the tact to suggest that\r\nshe might accept it as she had not yet signed a contract with Handel.\r\nTo which proposal Sallé replied with quiet scorn: “And does my word\r\nthen count for nothing?”\r\n\r\nLondon was delighted with the novelty of Mlle. Sallé’s ideas in the\r\nproduction of Ballet, and with the personal grace of the young dancer\r\nherself. One of the older historians of the dance has described her\r\nin the following glowing terms: “_Une figure noble, une belle taille,\r\nune grâce parfaite, une danse expressive et voluptueuse, tels étaient\r\nles avantages de Mademoiselle Sallé, la Taglioni de 1730._”\r\n\r\nAs an influence in the revolution of the Dance and Ballet she might\r\nperhaps not incorrectly be described as the Isadora Duncan of her\r\nperiod. True, she did not dance barefoot, but she came to loosen the\r\nbonds of tradition, and to free the spirit of the Dance from the\r\nstiffening conventionalities which had grown up around Ballet as seen\r\nat the Paris Opera. In London she had greater freedom, and--greater\r\nsuccess; indeed, so triumphant was her final season that when she\r\ndid return to Paris she was welcomed by Voltaire with the following\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n               “Les Amours, pleurant votre absence,\r\n                Loin de vous s’étaient envolés;\r\n                Enfin les voilà rappelés\r\n                Dans le séjour de leur naissance.”\r\n\r\nIn yet another poem he pays tribute to her virtue in describing her\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n            “De tous les cœurs et du sien la maîtresse,\r\n             Elle alluma des feux qui lui sont inconnus.\r\n             De Diane c’est la prêtresse\r\n             Dansant sous les traits de Vénus.”\r\n\r\nLater there was to come a change and the idealistic young dancer was\r\nto be attacked for the very virtues her adoring poets--for Voltaire\r\nwas not the only one--had celebrated. Her austerity got on the\r\nParisian nerves! A more modern scribe has pictured her thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SALLÉ\r\n\r\n           “The perfect dance needs music sweet\r\n            As dreams; seductive, so the feet\r\n            Are led to move as by some spell;\r\n            Or music as of murmuring shell.\r\n            True dance shows naught of haste or heat,\r\n            Nor trick, nor any kind of cheat.\r\n            Beauty and Joy, twin souls, should meet\r\n            To make that lovely miracle,\r\n                The perfect dance.\r\n\r\n           “A field of wind-kissed waving wheat;\r\n            A swaying sea, scarce waked to greet\r\n            The dawn; clouds drifting; these things tell\r\n            What dance may be--if it excel.\r\n            Men said they saw in hers complete,\r\n                The perfect dance!”\r\n\r\nBut if the Parisians did not quite appreciate her as they should have\r\ndone at first, her return to Paris after her London successes was\r\ntriumphant. Her portrait was painted by Lancret; her every appearance\r\nwas greeted with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nShe remained at the Opera for some years, retired therefrom in\r\n1740, but made frequent appearances after, at Versailles and at\r\nFontainebleau, until a few years before her death in 1756.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to think that her personal dignity had won her\r\nthe respect, and her beauteous art the homage of London before her\r\nqualities came to be recognised in Paris. It is possibly just the\r\nsuggestion of austerity about her performance that appealed to the\r\nLondon audience. She had a poetic distinction above the average.\r\nShe was an expressive _mime_, and her dancing was marked by supreme\r\nrefinement, a magnetic reserve, a strange suggestion of pictured\r\nstillness, an exquisite simplicity and grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLA BELLE CAMARGO\r\n\r\n\r\nSome say that Camargo had no right to be described “La Belle.”\r\nContemporary accounts of her appearance differ. It was a time when\r\npeople took sides, and duelled for their opinions.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that several famous dancers have been of\r\nquestionable beauty--at least, as to face, and when in repose; for\r\nit is another curious thing that no dancer ever did or possibly ever\r\ncould, look plain when dancing, that is, if dancing really well. The\r\nanimation or gentle grace of the dance, whether quick or slow, seems\r\ninevitably to confer a beauty that otherwise might not be apparent.\r\nThis fact in itself would appear to suggest that in dancing, as in\r\nother arts, and in life itself, it is the “spirit which quickeneth”;\r\nand, where that sufficiently illumines the body, what the body itself\r\nmay otherwise be profits little.\r\n\r\nBut if some of her more jealous colleagues may have found Camargo too\r\ndark for their taste--“swarthy,” said some--you may in turn criticise\r\nher critics and see for yourself what she was like if you go to view\r\nher portrait by Lancret, in the Wallace collection in Hertford House.\r\n\r\nMarie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo was born at Brussels early in April,\r\nand baptised in the parish of St. Nicholas--it is well to be exact in\r\nmatters of such importance!--on the 15th of that month, in 1710.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter, and first child, of a gentleman who had “seen\r\nbetter days”--and, through his daughter, was to see them again. At\r\nthe time of her birth he was a teacher of music and dancing, and was\r\nemployed by, or dependent on, the Prince de Ligne. Through her father\r\nthe little dancer claimed descent from an exalted Roman family, which\r\nfrom time to time had given a bishop, an archbishop, and a cardinal\r\nto Holy Church; while on her mother’s side she was descended from a\r\nfamous and ancient Spanish house.\r\n\r\nRomance was ever ready to find in the earliest years of a popular\r\nstar predictions of future fame, and it is probably only romance that\r\ntells how Camargo danced, on hearing a violin played, when she was\r\nbut six months old!\r\n\r\nIt is rather more certain, though, that her first lessons were from\r\nher father, and that under his tuition she did well enough, by the\r\ntime she was nearly ten, to deserve the patronage of the Princesse\r\nde Ligne, when that lady paid the expenses of some few months’ study\r\nunder the then famous Mlle. Prévôt.\r\n\r\nEven so she must have been remarkably precocious, for before she\r\nwas eleven she had returned to Brussels finished enough to achieve\r\na remarkable success on her first appearance. An auspicious _début_\r\nwas followed by an engagement at Rouen, but, through no fault of\r\nMarie-Anne be it said, the manager failed.\r\n\r\nAs the Camargo luck would have it, however, there was a new director\r\nat the _Académie Royale_ in Paris, by name Francine, and from him the\r\nlittle dancer received the welcome chance of appearing at the Opera,\r\nwhere she made her Paris _début_ on May 5th, 1726, in “Les Caractères\r\nde la Danse,” and achieved an instant and emphatic success.\r\n\r\nOver the new-comer the impressionable capital fairly lost its head,\r\nand soon every fashion--shoes, hats, fans, coiffures, everything--was\r\n“_à la Camargo_,” of which craze relics survive, for even to-day we\r\nhave Camargo shoes. Such a threatened eclipse of her own popularity\r\nnot unnaturally made poor Prévôt--now about forty-six, and having\r\nbeen before the public over twenty years--furiously jealous, and\r\nfor the next year or so Marie-Anne’s progress was made difficult\r\nby intrigue, and ere Paris set its seal of favour on her art by\r\nimitating her fashions, the young dancer had to find herself more\r\nthan once occupying the comparative obscurity of the “back row.”\r\n\r\nHer chance came, though, when one of the famous male dancers,\r\nDumoulin, for some reason failed to make his entry, and Camargo, in\r\na sudden devil-may-care mood, taking up his cue, leapt forward and\r\nwent through his dance with such dazzling brilliance and won such\r\nuniversal acclaim that henceforth any intrigue for the suppression\r\nof the youthful artist was impossible, and it was Prévôt, not\r\nMarie-Anne, who eventually had to go.\r\n\r\nWhile Sallé--also a pupil of Prévôt--was making a bid for fame in\r\nLondon, Camargo was taking Paris by storm, and creating another of\r\nwhich she was temporarily the unhappy centre. Furious at this second\r\nobtrusion on the public notice Mlle. Prévôt bitterly upbraided her\r\npushing young pupil, refused to give her any more lessons, and even\r\nto dance with her in an _entrée_ in which the Duchesse de Berri had\r\nasked her to appear.\r\n\r\nA well-known male dancer of the Opera, seeing Camargo in tears, said\r\nto her: “Leave this severe and jealous mistress, who seeks only to\r\nmortify you. I will give you lessons, and will compose the _entrée_\r\nwhich the Duchesse requires and you shall dance in it.” Under the\r\ncareful direction of Blondi the young dancer--then only sixteen--made\r\nrapid progress. She combined _noblesse_ and brilliance of execution,\r\nwith grace, lightness, and a gaiety which was natural to her--on\r\nthe stage. One who had seen her described her in the following\r\nterms: “_C’était une femme d’esprit; fort gaie sur la scène et fort\r\ntriste à la ville; qui n’était ni jolie ni bien faite, mais légère,\r\net la légèreté était alors un mérite fort rare. Elle exécutait\r\navec une extrême facilité la ‘royale’ et ‘l’entrechat’ coupé sans\r\nfrottement...._”\r\n\r\nThere was for a little time considerable rivalry between Sallé,\r\nCamargo and a third young dancer named Roland, of whose record\r\nhistory has been neglectful. But the rivalry was testified by an\r\nanonymous scribe whose verses may be translated as follow:\r\n\r\n             “Of Camargo, Roland, Sallé\r\n              The connoisseurs have much to say!\r\n              One holds ’tis Sallé’s grace that tells,\r\n              And one--Roland in joy excels.\r\n              But each is struck by the display\r\n              Of nimble steps and daring way\r\n                            Of Camargo.\r\n\r\n             “Equal the balance ’twixt the three\r\n              But were I Paris, forced to choose,\r\n              Only I know I could not use\r\n              But crown the dance, sublime and free,\r\n                            Of Camargo.”\r\n\r\nThere was of course the inevitable tribute from Voltaire, whose poem,\r\napart from the ingenuity with which he divides his favours between\r\nthe rival stars, is of unusual interest, since it gives a useful\r\nimpression of their contrasted styles in apostrophising the dancers\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n       “Ah! Camargo, que vous êtes brillante!\r\n        Mais que Sallé, grand dieux! est ravissante!\r\n        Que vos pas sont légers, et que les siens sont doux!\r\n        Elle est inimitable, et vous êtes nouvelle;\r\n            Les nymphes sautent comme vous\r\n            Et les Grâces dansent comme elle.”\r\n\r\nIt is all safe praise of course, but when we separate the qualities\r\none finds that he is only versifying the current opinion--Camargo\r\nis “brillante,” her steps are “légers,” and the “nouvelle” refers\r\nless to _her_ than to the novelty of her steps, with the clever\r\ninvention of which she delighted her audience; and the nymphs, you\r\nobserve, “_sautent_ comme vous,” an appropriate phrase for one whose\r\n_entrechats_ amazed a generation to which such things were new. On\r\nthe other hand, Sallé was “ravissante,” her steps were “doux”; she\r\nwas “inimitable,” and “les Grâces _dansent_ comme elle,” a point of\r\nspecial significance when we recall the historic distinction between\r\nthe words _sauter_ and _danser_.\r\n\r\nVoltaire’s admiration was not exactly fevered--could the icy\r\n“intellectual” ever have been that? Not so the rest of Paris.\r\nRumour soon gave her countless lovers--as it will a pretty actress\r\nto-day?--but history does not record that she succumbed to their\r\nprotestations. Certainly duels were fought on her behalf; but\r\nprobably she was unaware that she was the cause; and certainly she\r\ndid not provoke them. _Was_ she a pretty actress? Setting aside the\r\nopinion of her feminine contemporaries, unbiased colleagues thought\r\nnot. Yet painters such as Lancret, Vanloo, and Pater sought for the\r\nhonour of depicting her graceful figure and--was it her face? Well,\r\nas to actual features perhaps she was not faultlessly beautiful,\r\nbut with that mingled Italian and Spanish blood, even if she were\r\nswarthy as some said, she must have been striking, temperamental,\r\nfull of fire and “interesting” as we might say to-day. Much of her\r\nfascination must have been in expression, and one feels that she had\r\nthat quality which often makes a dancer--sheer joy in dancing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. Ballon and Mlle. Prévôt\r\n\r\n(_After an engraving [reversed] in the Bibliothèque de l’Opéra_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camargo\r\n\r\n(_From the painting by Lancret in the Wallace Collection_).]\r\n\r\nHer style was noted by contemporaries as combining quickness with\r\ngrace to a degree not previously achieved, and she won special credit\r\nfor her invention of new steps. Her improvisation of new dances\r\nwas remarkable, and it is important to note that she was the first to\r\nperform an _entrechat_, which, only for the benefit of non-dancing\r\nreaders, may be described as the step in which a dancer actually\r\ncrosses her feet rapidly while in mid-air. This historic innovation\r\ntook place in 1730, and she could make four crossings; while eight\r\nare said to be as many as any dancer has since performed.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point to note is that until the advent of Camargo\r\nthe ballet skirts reached nearly, or quite, to the ankles. She was\r\nthe first to shorten it, not, of course, to the brevity one can only\r\nregret has been too often seen since, but to such degree as to enable\r\nthe steps to be better seen and the dancer to have greater freedom of\r\nmovement. Her favourite dances were the _Tambourin_, _Gavotte_, and\r\n_Rigaudon_, or _Rigadoon_, as it is known in English. But for all the\r\nshortening of the skirt and the rapidity of her steps, Marie-Anne was\r\nnever accused from departing from modesty, grace, and refinement of\r\ndeportment.\r\n\r\nA curious personal characteristic was, that while on the stage\r\nshe was the incarnation of gaiety, yet in private life she was\r\nfor the most part strangely grave, and even sad; though, with all\r\nthe advantages of talent, position, and wealth of which she was\r\npossessed, it might have been expected she should be quite otherwise.\r\nNo one ever discovered the reason. One imagines it to have been that\r\nmodern disease, “the artistic temperament,” and a steady perception\r\nof the pitiful fact that all stage triumphs are but transient; and\r\nthat, popular as she might be, and was, on her retirement in 1751,\r\nher fame would not long endure after her death, which actually\r\noccurred in 1770. Yet to-day she lives for us in Lancret’s exquisite\r\npicture, for all to see who visit Hertford House.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CAMARGO SPEAKS\r\n\r\n           “Talk to me not of poor Prévôt,\r\n            With all her peevish airs and graces;\r\n            Her day is past! ’Tis sad, I know,\r\n            But then--we cannot _all_ be aces!\r\n            ’Tis time she learned her proper place is\r\n            A little lower in the pack;\r\n            For all in favour now _my_ pace is:\r\n            Of Rigaudons I have the knack.\r\n\r\n           “Though some still like a vogue that’s slow,\r\n            Formal, and stiff, the present craze is\r\n            All for the dance that has some ‘go;’\r\n            And Minuet enjoys all praises.\r\n            But yet my dance the more amazes,\r\n            And none can follow on my ‘track,’\r\n            As step with swift step interlaces.\r\n            Of Rigaudons I _have_ the knack.\r\n\r\n            “When in my aerial flight I go,\r\n            High leaping, see the people’s faces!\r\n            How round their eyes begin to grow,\r\n            And what a shout each one upraises!\r\n            Perchance some jealous girl grimaces.\r\n            But what of that! when, smiling back,\r\n            I see the one thing _she_ betrays is--\r\n            Of Rigaudons _I_ have the knack!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ENVOI\r\n\r\n           “_But oh! one fear my soul abases._\r\n            _Time will some day my fair limbs rack!_\r\n            _Who then will reck that now the phrase is--_\r\n            _‘Of Rigaudons I have the knack’?_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF VESTRIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that during one of the many revolts indulged in by\r\nthe dancers of the Paris Opera against managerial control, which\r\nincidentally meant, of course, State and Royal control, some of the\r\nleaders were sent to Fort l’Evêque--including Auguste Vestris.\r\n\r\nSo melodramatically pathetic was the farewell scene with his father,\r\nGaetan, that even his colleagues laughed! “Go my son,” said _le Diou\r\nde la Danse_. “This is the most glorious moment of your career. Take\r\nmy carriage, and ask for the cell which was occupied by my friend the\r\nKing of Poland. I will meet every expense.”\r\n\r\nAnd the great Gaetan is said to have added, with an air of injured\r\ndignity, that this was the first time in history that there had been\r\n“any difference of opinion between the House of Bourbon and the House\r\nof Vestris!”\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ the--“House of Vestris?” Well, it was a fairly numerous\r\none, of which, so far as our interest is concerned, Gaetan was\r\nvirtually the founder. He had a father it is true, who, being\r\nemployed, it is believed, in a Florentine pawnbroker’s, got into some\r\ntrouble and with his young family “cleared” to Naples. There being no\r\ntrains, “wireless” or Scotland Yard in those days, they stayed there\r\nin safety for a while; the children, who had been taught music and\r\ndancing, being made to exercise their talents in that direction for\r\ntheir general support.\r\n\r\nPalermo was the next move, where two of the girls, Marie-Therese and\r\nViolante, with one of the sons, Gaetan, entered the Opera. After\r\nthat they seem to have scattered and travelled over most of cultured\r\nEurope, appearing now in one opera house, now in another, and always\r\ndeeply engaged in love affairs. It is with their arrival in Paris,\r\nand with Gaetan more especially that we now have to do.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the eight children of Thomas Vestris and his wife,\r\n_née_ Violante-Beatrix de Dominique Bruscagli, but only of three of\r\nthe family have we much record, namely, Gaetan and the two sisters\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nGaetan-Appolino Balthazar Vestris was born at Florence in April,\r\n1729, and in importance--though far from it in physique--was the\r\nMordkin of his era. There, however, the resemblance ceases.\r\n\r\nHe was a little man, with the biggest ideas of his own talents.\r\nBut his size did not detract from his merits, his sheer style as\r\na dancer; and from all accounts he is to be ranked as one of the\r\nfinest male dancers the world has ever known. Indeed, it is hardly an\r\nexaggeration to say that he is one of the most important factors in\r\nthe history of the modern dance and that his influence as a teacher\r\nis seen to-day in the real classic school, that is, the school\r\nwhich is based on ages of tradition. For Gaetan was in his time the\r\nsupreme leader of the Dance, and undoubtedly gave a new standard and\r\ntradition to Paris, the influence of which spread to every Opera\r\nHouse on the Continent.\r\n\r\nHe is a link in a chain. One of the first dancing masters to assist\r\nLouis XIV in establishing his Royal Academy of Music and Dance--and\r\nmodern theatrical dancing dates from that event--was Beauchamps,\r\nwhose pupil was “the great” Dupré. _He_ taught Gaetan Vestris. Gaetan\r\nin turn taught his son Auguste, of whom, in his later years, Carlotta\r\nGrisi was a pupil, and there may be some to-day who have studied\r\nunder pupils of Carlotta Grisi, who herself died comparatively\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nAccording to a contemporary biographer Gaetan made his _début_ at\r\nthe Royal Academy of Music and Dance “_sans retribution_,” in 1748;\r\nentered there for study in 1749, became a solo dancer in 1751, a\r\nMember of the Académie Royale de Danse in 1753; _maître de ballet_\r\nin 1761 until 1770, and composer and master of Ballet from that year\r\nuntil 1776.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time he visited Stuttgart--as the Russian dancers to-day\r\nhave visited London--in vacation, and in the theatre there under the\r\ndirection of that master of ballet-composition and stage reformer,\r\nJean Georges Noverre, found greater scope for his artistic abilities\r\nthan in the more conventional work of the Paris Opera.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that by her invention of new and rapid steps, Camargo\r\ninfused new life into the technique of theatrical dancing some years\r\nbefore the rise of Gaetan Vestris to supremacy. He, in turn, came to\r\nbring a new influence mainly in the direction of a certain _largeur_\r\nof movement and gesture, a certain grandiosity, as well as setting a\r\nnew standard in perfection of execution.\r\n\r\nA contemporary critic declared: “When Vestris appeared at the Opera\r\none really believed it was Apollo who had come to earth to give\r\nlessons in grace. He perfected the art of the Dance, gave more\r\nfreedom to the ‘positions’ already known, and created new ones.”\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly he learnt much from Noverre, even as the latter had\r\nlearnt much from David Garrick. Noverre conceived the idea of\r\ncreating the dance with action, in short, the ballet-pantomime; at\r\nleast its creation was claimed, and by some of his contemporaries,\r\nattributed to him; though we have seen that he had forerunners\r\nin the Duchesse du Maine, and, too, in Sallé, who was an ardent\r\nstage-reformer and seems to have influenced Noverre. But it was the\r\nlatter who took practical steps towards instituting the real ballet\r\nin action, the true ballet-pantomime as we have seen it to-day.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, opera-ballet had had a somewhat rigid form: there\r\nwere music, singing and dancing; but the dances were detached items\r\nin the general effect. The regulation form was: _passe-pieds_ in the\r\nprologue; _musettes_ in the first act; _tambourins_ in the second;\r\n_chaconnes_ and _passacailles_ in the third and fourth.\r\n\r\nIn all this it was not the plot of the opera which decided the\r\nintroduction of the dances, but quite other considerations, such as\r\nthe particular excellence of particular dancers in their special\r\ndances--the best performers usually appearing last. It was routine,\r\nnot the action of the story by which these things were ordered; and\r\nthe poet who had provided the plot, the musician who had composed\r\nthe music, the costumier and scenic artist, and even the ballet\r\nmaster, each worked detachedly, without regard to consultation and\r\ncooperation towards an artistic unity of effect.\r\n\r\nThe lines had been set, the routine laid down for all time; any\r\ndeviation therefrom seemed impossible, a thing vainly imagined only\r\nby a heretic, who could not hope to win in a fight against the\r\nestablished form and authority of the Opera. Yet the reformation\r\ncame. Noverre, the reformer, found in Gaetan Vestris a technical\r\nexponent who responded to his influence; and in Dauberval, another;\r\nand at Stuttgart the time and place for artistic experiment. It is\r\nto this triumvirate that credit was given in their own time for\r\nthe reform of the _scène chorégraphique_, a reform which had to\r\nstruggle against and overcome tradition, prejudice, ignorance and the\r\nobstinacy of authority. Slow progress was made at first. Stuttgart\r\nhad its effect, but the Paris Opera still clung to the bizarre\r\naccessories which were then regarded as inherent to the dignity of\r\nthe theatre--the masks, under which the faces were hidden, the\r\ntowering wigs by which the heads were bowed; the absurd panniers; the\r\npuffed skirts; the great breastplates, all forming the heroic panoply\r\nby which the leading histrions were known for hero and heroine, and\r\ntraces of which may be found in those spangled figures beloved of our\r\ngrandfathers and grandmothers in their childhood, during the first\r\nhalf of last century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gaetan Vestris\r\n\r\n(_From an old print_).]\r\n\r\nGaetan Vestris was the first dancer who dared to discard that\r\nabsurd convention--the mask, and so reveal that expressive play of\r\nfeature which made _acted_ ballet possible. This was in 1770, when\r\nhe appeared in a ballet-pantomime on the story of _Medea and Jason_.\r\nHe astonished the audience by the dramatic force of his miming and\r\nby the nobility of his physiognomical expression. One critic wrote:\r\n“_Le mérite particulier de Vestris, c’était la grâce, l’élégance et la\r\ndélicatesse. Tous ses pas avaient une pureté, un fini dont on ne peut\r\nse faire une idée aujourd’hui et ce n’est pas sans quelque raison\r\nqu’on compare son talent à celui de Racine._”\r\n\r\nFor all his artistic talent as dancer and mime, however, Gaetan was\r\npractically illiterate; ignorant of all save the art in which he\r\nexcelled; and his conceit was colossal.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he was coming from a rehearsal at the Opera, a somewhat\r\nample lady happened, in passing, to tread rather heavily on one of\r\nhis feet. In deep concern she apologised profusely, and expressed an\r\nearnest hope that she had not seriously hurt him.\r\n\r\n“Hurt me, Madam!” he answered. “Me? You have merely put all Paris\r\ninto mourning for a fortnight!”\r\n\r\nHis pride in his son was stupendous, and he once declared that, “If\r\nAuguste occasionally descends to touch the earth it is merely out\r\nof consideration for the feelings of less talented colleagues.” As\r\nto himself, on one occasion he volunteered the assertion that his\r\ncentury had produced but three really great men--Frederick the Great,\r\nVoltaire and himself!\r\n\r\nOf the many susceptible ladies who succumbed to the questionable\r\nfascination of this “_Diou de la Danse_”--as in his Italianate-French\r\nhe called himself--the most notable--apart from his legitimate wife,\r\nthe beautiful _danseuse_ Heinel, whom he married in 1752--was Mlle.\r\nAllard.\r\n\r\nBorn of poor and none too honest parents, Marie Allard first drew\r\nbreath on August 14th, 1742, at Marseilles, where at an early age she\r\nentered the local theatre. On the death of her mother, she decided\r\nto leave a disreputable father and made her way to Lyons, where she\r\nfound another not very brilliant theatrical engagement. At the age of\r\nfourteen, tiring of Lyons, she set out to win fame in Paris, where\r\nshe entered the Comédie Française. In the course of time, she came to\r\nknow Gaetan Vestris, and with him she studied dancing.\r\n\r\nShe made her _début_ at the Opera in June, 1761, and delighted the\r\naudience with the verve, grace and gaiety of her dancing. Though she\r\nshone especially in comedy, she was noted as a clever actress in\r\ntragedy; and while “Sylvie,” in the comedy-ballet of that name, was\r\none of her most successful parts, she is said to have moved beholders\r\nto tears by her performance in Noverre’s “Medea.”\r\n\r\nIn the lighter _rôles_, however, she was especially popular, and from\r\nthe moment of her _entrée_ (she was the only dancer at the Opera who\r\nwas allowed to compose her own _entrées_, not edible!) her gaiety of\r\nmanner was such as almost to eclipse the real talent displayed in her\r\ndancing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her public career came to a close all too soon for\r\nher admirers, from a cause which even she with all her agility\r\nand incessant exercise, was unable to control--a tendency to\r\n_embonpoint_! She retired in 1781, and died in 1802; not before she\r\nhad seen the success of her and Gaetan Vestris’ son, Auguste, who,\r\nknown as Vestr’-Allard, seemed to combine within him the respective\r\nchoreographic perfections of mother and father.\r\n\r\nGaetan Vestris, having retired in 1782, lived until 1808, and\r\nrejoiced to see his son acknowledged as supreme. On him he graciously\r\nconferred the title of _Le Diou de la Danse_; and he declared that\r\nit was, after all, only natural that Auguste should excel, since the\r\nyoung man possessed one advantage over himself--he “had Gaetan for\r\nhis father!”\r\n\r\nAuguste, or Marie-Auguste, to give his full name, was born at\r\nParis in 1760. He made his _début_ at the age of twelve in a\r\n_divertissement_ entitled “Cinquantaine” with a _chaconne_, which he\r\ndanced in a manner such as had never been seen. In 1773 he made a\r\nstrikingly successful appearance as Eros in the ballet of “Endymion;”\r\nand though already recognised as a master he entered the Academy\r\nschool in 1775 and the Opera in the following year. For some time he\r\naccepted subordinate _rôles_, but gradually his consummate ability in\r\nall he undertook brought him forward, and as he became more and more\r\nthe pet of the ladies of the Opera and the admiration of its patrons\r\nhe began to develop his father’s traits, especially conceit.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the Director, de Vismes, annoyed at some impertinence\r\nof the young man, said, “Monsieur Vestris, do you know to whom you\r\nspeak?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Auguste replied, “to the farmer of my talent.”\r\n\r\nIt says much for that talent that his appearance at the Opera during\r\nsome thirty-five years, under Louis-Seize, the Republic and the\r\nEmpire, largely accounted for its prosperity in those amazing times.\r\n\r\nHe had his father’s grace, precision, suppleness, and style, but\r\nmore spirit and vivacity; a greater gift of mime; and was as good in\r\n_genre_ as in the nobler _rôles_. He paid several visits to London,\r\nalways with success.\r\n\r\nHe married in 1795, a young dancer, Anne-Catherine Augier, who had\r\nmade her _début_ at the Opera two years before under the _nom de\r\nthéâtre_ of _Aimée_, but his infatuation for her modesty and charm\r\nand many good qualities did not last any longer than had his other\r\ninfatuations for worse qualities in less desirable ladies, and his\r\ninfidelities led her to attempt suicide, with results that left\r\nher more or less an invalid until death put an end to her unhappy\r\nexistence in 1809. Auguste Vestris himself died in 1842, and left\r\none son Auguste-Armand. He made his _début_ at the Opera, as did a\r\ncousin, Charles Vestris, both being pupils of Auguste; and both went\r\nabroad; but neither added greater brilliance to the family name than\r\nhad been achieved for it by first Gaetan, and then Auguste, the first\r\nand most distinguished upholders of the House of Vestris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nJEAN GEORGES NOVERRE\r\n\r\n\r\nSupreme above all other writers on the dance and ballet is Jean\r\nGeorges Noverre, whose genius has been praised by Diderot, Voltaire,\r\nby D’Alembert, Dorat, and by David Garrick, the last of whom\r\ndescribed him as “the Shakespeare” of the dance.\r\n\r\nBorn at Paris in April, 1727, he was the son of a distinguished Swiss\r\nsoldier, who had served as an adjutant in the army of Charles XII,\r\nand intended his son for a military career.\r\n\r\nJean, however, early developed a passion for the stage, and\r\nespecially for dancing, so was apprenticed by his father to the\r\nfamous Parisian dancer and _maître de ballet_, Dupré.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1743, young Noverre made his _début_ at the Court of\r\nLouis-Quinze in a fête at Fontainebleau, but with only moderate\r\nsuccess. Not discouraged, however, he went a little later to the\r\nCourt of Berlin, where he became a favourite with Frederick the Great\r\nand his brother, Prince Henry of Prussia.\r\n\r\nHe returned to France in 1747, and two years later obtained the\r\npost of _maître de ballet_ at the Opéra Comique, where the success\r\nof his “Ballet Chinois” aroused considerable jealousy among his\r\ncolleagues and brought him some distinction in the art world. But\r\nthe success was not great enough for his ambitious spirit, and he\r\nagain travelled, and did not return to Paris for nearly twenty\r\nyears. Noverre and such are seldom recognised as prophets in their\r\nown country, until their genius has received recognition abroad. As\r\nCastil-Blaze, the historian of opera in France, has neatly expressed\r\nit: “Noverre and the two Gardels effected in the dance the same\r\nrevolution that Gluck and Sacchini achieved some years later in\r\nFrench music.” But Noverre was unable to do this as a young man\r\nin Paris fighting against the sheer dead weight of convention and\r\nhide-bound authority. He was unable to do it until he had won his\r\nlaurels abroad.\r\n\r\nSallé, one of the most exquisite and “intellectual” of _danseuses_,\r\nhad left Paris for a more appreciative audience in London because\r\nthe Paris Opera disliked her attempts to discard the ridiculous\r\nconventions of stage costumes then ruling and to “reform it\r\naltogether” in favour of something more congruous.\r\n\r\nNoverre visioned to himself a theatre devoted to a kind of ballet as\r\ndifferent from that he saw in Paris, as the Russian ballet we have\r\nseen to-day differs from that which London had seen in the ’thirties\r\nof last century; a ballet that should be informed by a technique\r\nso perfect as to be unobtrusive, and combining the arts of dance,\r\npantomime, music and poesy into a new, subtle, resourceful and\r\ncomprehensive means of artistic expression.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to see swept away all the mechanical rules of ballet\r\ncomposition, the stereotyped and unimaginative story, the\r\nconventional arrangement of stage groups, the stilted “heroic” style\r\nof the dancers, the formal sequence of their _entrées_, and above\r\nall, the _bizarrerie_ of their masks, their panniers and helmets with\r\nwaving, funereal plumes. He wanted to infuse a new spirit of art and\r\nefficiency into what he found about him and--he had to go elsewhere!\r\nAn invitation from the Duke of Würtemberg to become _maître de\r\nballet_ at the luxurious Court of Stuttgart gave him his chance, and\r\nhe founded here the school which was to influence European Ballet in\r\nthat and the successive generation, as the school of Petrograd seemed\r\nlike to do to-day.\r\n\r\nThe publication of his _Lettres sur la Danse et sur les Ballets_, in\r\n1760, dedicated by permission to this same Duke of Würtemberg and\r\nTeck, caused a sensation among dancers in Paris and other capitals,\r\nand having produced ballets in Berlin, London (1755), Lyons (1758),\r\nand Stuttgart, he was reintroduced to Paris by Vestris (who had been\r\nin the habit of visiting Stuttgart every year to dance during his\r\nvacations) in 1765, when he achieved a success with his tragic ballet\r\nof “Medea.”\r\n\r\nLater he was to visit Vienna, to superintend the fêtes on the\r\noccasion of the marriage of the Archduchess Caroline (Queen of\r\nNaples), produce there a dozen ballets, and become appointed Director\r\nof Court fêtes and _Maître de Danse_ to the Empress Maria Theresa and\r\nImperial Family, the Empress heaping favours upon him and granting a\r\nlieutenancy to his son.\r\n\r\nFrom Vienna he went to the Court of Milan, where he was created\r\nChevalier of the Order of the Cross; then to the Courts of Naples and\r\nLisbon; then to London, and finally again to Paris, in 1775, on the\r\ninvitation of his old pupil, Marie Antoinette, who made him _Maître\r\ndes Ballets en Chef_ at the Imperial Academy of Music, and Director\r\nof the fêtes at the Petit Trianon; finally retiring at the outbreak\r\nof the French Revolution, to London, where it is possible--or, at any\r\nrate, in England--some of his descendants may yet be living.\r\n\r\nA translation of these wonderful _Lettres sur la Danse et sur les\r\nBallets_ was published in London in 1780, and was dedicated to the\r\nthen Prince of Wales, later George IV. In the preface the anonymous\r\ntranslator says: “The works of Monsieur Noverre, especially the\r\nfollowing letters, have been translated into most of the European\r\nlanguages and thought worthy of a distinguished place in the\r\nlibraries of the literati.” To which, let me add, they should be so\r\nthought to-day, at least in their original French form, for they are\r\nof uncommon interest and literary charm.\r\n\r\nIn the somewhat stiff manner of the English of the late Georgian\r\nperiod, his translator remarks of Noverre’s work in the original:\r\n“His manner of writing is chaste, correct and elegant; perfectly\r\nmaster of his subjects, he treats of them with the utmost\r\nperspicuity; and by the connection which he proves to exist between\r\nthe other arts, and that of dancing, the author lays down rules and\r\nprecepts for them all; so that the poet, the painter and the musician\r\nmay be greatly benefited by the perusal of his works.”\r\n\r\nThe translator follows with a short history of dancing, and three\r\nextremely interesting epistles to Noverre from the great Voltaire, in\r\nthe first of which, apropos the publication of Noverre’s _Lettres_,\r\nhe says: “I have read, sir, your work of genius: my gratitude equals\r\nmy esteem. You promise only to treat of dancing, and you shed a\r\nlight on all the arts. Your style is as eloquent as your ballet is\r\nimaginative.” In another he remarks: “I have for admiring you, a\r\nreason personal to myself; it is that your works abound with poetical\r\nimages. Poets and painters shall vie with each other to have you\r\nranked with them.” Again he says: “I am surprised that you have not\r\nbeen offered such advantages as might have kept you in France; but\r\nthat time is no more when France sets the example to all Europe”; but\r\nelsewhere remarks, curiously enough: “I believe that your merit will\r\nbe fully recognised in England, for there they love Nature.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jean Georges Noverre]\r\n\r\nIt was just this love of Nature and “natural” acting which brought\r\nNoverre and Garrick together in mutual admiration and friendship, to\r\nthe latter of whom, by the way, the French _maître_ pays the highest\r\ntribute in his tenth letter. To turn, however, to the first:\r\n“Poetry, painting and dancing are, or ought to be, the faithful copy\r\nof Nature ... a ballet is a piece of painting, the scene is the\r\ncanvas; in the mechanical motions of the figures we find the colours\r\n... the composer himself is the painter.\r\n\r\n“Ballets have hitherto been the faint sketch only of what they might\r\none day be. An art entirely subservient, as this is, to taste and\r\ngenius, may receive daily variations and improvements. History,\r\npainting, mythology, poetry, all join to raise it from that obscurity\r\nin which it lies buried; and it is truly surprising that composers\r\nhave hitherto disdained so many valuable resources.... If ballets\r\nare for the most part uninteresting and uniformly dull, if they fail\r\nin their characteristic _expression_ which constitutes their very\r\nessence, the defect does not originate from the art itself, but\r\nshould be ascribed to the artists. Are then the latter to be told\r\nthat dancing is an imitative art? I am indeed inclined to think that\r\nthey know it not, since we daily see the generality of composers\r\nsacrifice the beauties of the dance and forego the graceful _naïveté_\r\nof sentiment, to become servile copyists of a certain number of\r\nfigures known and hackneyed for a century or more.... It is uncommon\r\nand next to impossible now to find invention in ballets, elegance in\r\nthe forms, neatness in the groups, or the requisite precision in the\r\nmeans of introducing the various figures.”\r\n\r\n“Ballet masters should consult the productions of the most eminent\r\npainters. This would bring them nearer to Nature and induce them\r\nto avoid as often as possible that symmetry of figures which, by\r\nrepeating the object, presents two separate pictures on one and the\r\nsame canvas. A ballet, perfect in all its parts, is a picture drawn\r\nfrom life, of the manners, dresses, ceremonies and customs of the\r\nvarious nations. It must be a complete _panto-mime_ and through\r\nthe eyes speak, as it were, to the very soul of the spectator. If\r\nit wants expression, if it be deficient in point of situation and\r\nscenery, it degenerates into a mere _spectacle_, flat and monotonous.\r\n\r\n“This kind of composition will not admit of mediocrity; like the art\r\nof painting it requires a degree of perfection the more difficult\r\nto attain in that it is subordinate to a true imitation of Nature,\r\nand that it is next to an impossibility to achieve that all-subduing\r\ntruth which conceals the illusion from the spectator, carries him, as\r\nit were, to the very spot where the scene lies; and inspires him with\r\nthe same sentiments as he must experience, were he present at the\r\nevents which the artist only represents.\r\n\r\n“Ballets, being regular representations, ought to unite the various\r\nparts of the drama. Most of the subjects, adapted to the dancer,\r\nare devoid of sense, and exhibit only a confused jumble of scenes,\r\nequally unmeaning and unconnected; yet it is in general absolutely\r\nnecessary to confine oneself within certain rules. The historical\r\npart of a ballet must have its exposition, its incidents, its\r\n_dénouement_. The success of this kind of entertainment chiefly\r\ndepends on choosing good subjects, and dealing with them in a proper\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\nThe above brief quotations are all of interest as bearing on\r\nparticular points in dancing and ballet-composition, but I cannot\r\nrefrain from giving one more and a lengthier excerpt, the sound\r\ncommon sense of which applies to-day and will appeal to all modern\r\ndancers who realise that the finest opportunities of displaying their\r\nskill are, and can only be, found in ballets worthy of their art.\r\n\r\n“Every ballet,” he says, “complicated and extensive in its subject,\r\nwhich does not point out, with clearness and perspicuity, the action\r\nit is intended to represent, the intrigue of which is unintelligible,\r\nwithout a program or printed explanation: a ballet, in fine, whose\r\nplan is not felt, and appears deficient in point of exposition,\r\nincident and _dénouement_; such a ballet, I say, will never rise, in\r\nmy opinion, above a mere _divertissement_ of dancing, more or less\r\ncommendable from the manner in which it is performed. But it cannot\r\naffect me much, since it bears no particular character, and is devoid\r\nof expression.\r\n\r\n“It may be objected that dancing is now in so improved a state\r\nthat it may please, nay, enchant without the accessory ornaments\r\nof expression and sentiment.... I readily acknowledge that, as to\r\nmechanical execution, the art has attained the highest degree of\r\nperfection: I shall even confess that it sometimes is graceful: but\r\ngracefulness is but a small portion of the qualities it requires.\r\n\r\n“What I call the mechanical parts of dancing are the steps linked\r\nto each other with ease and brilliancy, the aplomb, steadiness,\r\nactivity, liveliness, and a well-directed opposition between the\r\narms and legs. When all these parts are managed without genius, when\r\nthe latter does not direct these different motions, and animate them\r\nby the fire of sentiment and expression; I feel neither emotion nor\r\nconcern. The dexterity of the dancer obtains my applause; I admire\r\nthe automaton, but I experience no further sensation. It has upon\r\nme the same effect as the most beautiful line, whose words are\r\nuncouthly set asunder, producing sound, not sense. As for instance,\r\nwhat would a reader feel at hearing the following detached words:\r\n_Fame-lives-in-dies-he-cause-who-in-virtue’s?_ Yet these very words\r\naptly joined by the man of genius, by Shakespeare, express the\r\nnoblest sentiment:\r\n\r\n           ‘He lives in Fame who dies in Virtue’s cause.’\r\n\r\n“From the above comparison we may fairly conclude that the art\r\nof Dancing has in itself all that is necessary to speak the best\r\nlanguage, but that it is not enough to be acquainted only with its\r\nalphabet. Let the man of genius put the letters together, form\r\nthe words, and from these produce regular sentences; the art shall\r\nno longer be mute, but speak with true energy, and the ballets\r\nwill share with the best dramatic pieces the peculiar advantage of\r\nexciting the tenderest feelings; nay, of receiving the tribute of a\r\ntear; while, in a less serious style, this art will please, entertain\r\nand charm the spectators. Dancing thus ennobled by the expression of\r\nsentiment, and under the direction of a man of true genius, will,\r\nin time, obtain the praises which the enlightened world bestows on\r\npoetry and painting, and become entitled to the rewards with which\r\nthe latter are daily honoured.”\r\n\r\nThe closing lines of the above are so curiously prophetic one\r\nquestions whether we have not already reached the period when an\r\n“enlightened world” bestows on dancing--at any rate on dancers--the\r\n“rewards” with which poetry and painting have been (or ought to have\r\nbeen) hitherto honoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nGUIMARD THE GRAND: 1743-1816\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some thirty of Madeleine Guimard’s seventy-three years of life\r\nshe was the idol of Paris, having risen from obscurity to power, and\r\nreturned again from a joyous life set in high places to a lonely\r\ndeath in obscurity.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ, as authorities so often do over the advent of new\r\nstars in the firmament of life, as to the date of Guimard’s birth.\r\nOne says the 2nd, and another the 10th, and yet a third the 20th of\r\nOctober. Edmond de Goncourt--not infallible on other points--gives\r\nthe date of her baptism correctly as December 27th, 1743.\r\n\r\nShe made her _début_ before the Parisian public when she was about\r\nsixteen, at the Comédie Française. She was received into the Academy\r\nin 1762, at the age of nineteen, and at a salary of six hundred\r\nlivres.\r\n\r\nIn face she was not beautiful; some have described her even as ugly.\r\nShe certainly had not Sophie Arnould’s shrewish wit, though she had\r\nhumour; but her gestures, her face, above all her expressive eyes\r\nspoke eloquently, her dancing seemed ever the true and spirited\r\nexpression of sentiments really felt, and in whatsoever _rôle_ she\r\nwas always brilliant, entrancing. She had that glamour which makes\r\nup for lack of looks, and had, too, caprice of mood and a commanding\r\nmanner, both qualities which susceptible men find adorable.\r\n\r\nHer historians have not always been kind. A contemporary wrote: “_La\r\nGuimard a des caprices entre nous. On ne peut compter sur elle....\r\nSon arrogance n’a pas de nom.... Ce que la Guimard veut, bon gré,\r\nmal gré, il faut qu’on le veuille._” And there you have it! “What\r\nGuimard wishes, willy-nilly one must wish.” That is a touch that\r\ntells; the words ring true. Intriguing, capricious--masterful! What\r\nwonder, then, that she came to rise by her own buoyancy, of manner\r\nand morals, and sought the rarefied, but, in the days of Louis XV,\r\nfar from inaccessible atmosphere of Court circles.\r\n\r\nGuimard made her _début_ at the Opera in May, 1762, as Terpsichore in\r\na ballet called “Les Caractères de la Danse,” and achieved a triumph.\r\nFrom that time until she retired from the stage she was practically\r\nwithout a rival in the affections of the Parisian audiences. One\r\ntestimony to her popularity is found in the promptitude with\r\nwhich she was nicknamed. Guimard, if not beautiful in face, had,\r\nnevertheless, a beautiful figure, was quite unusually graceful,\r\ncarried herself nobly, was altogether a commanding and magnetic\r\npersonage, but for all her beauty of figure Guimard was amazingly\r\nslim.\r\n\r\nSeeing her in a classical ballet dancing as a nymph between two\r\nfauns--impersonated by the celebrated male-dancers Vestris _père_ and\r\nDauberval--Sophie Arnould said it reminded her of “two dogs fighting\r\nfor a bone.” Another of her footnotes on Guimard was her description\r\nof her as “Le Squelette des Grâces,” which also had the saving grace\r\nof being partly a compliment, and it was by this nickname that\r\nMadeleine was generally known throughout Paris.\r\n\r\nTo judge from this insistence on Madeleine’s thinness one might\r\nimagine that she could not be as attractive, certainly hardly as\r\ngraceful as has been said. But such nicknames are, though emphasising\r\nsome special characteristic, usually only marks of popularity, and\r\nthat Guimard really was graceful can be gathered from the summing-up\r\nof Noverre who had seen her dance for years and knew, as only a great\r\nballet-master could, what he was talking about when he said that “...\r\nfrom her _début_ to her retirement she was always graceful, naturally\r\nso. She never ran after difficulties. A lovable and noble simplicity\r\nreigned in her dance; she designed it with perfect taste, and put\r\nexpression and sentiment into all her movements.”\r\n\r\nOf her performance in Gardel’s ballet, “La Chercheuse d’Esprit,” in\r\nwhich she played the title-_rôle_, a contemporary wrote that “her\r\neloquent silences surpassed the vivid, easy and seductive diction\r\nof Mme. Favart;” and he mentions one point that is of interest when\r\nhe remembers that the struggle that Noverre had had to achieve\r\nsome reform of costume on the opera-stage, namely, that Guimard,\r\n“following the example of Mme. Favart, discarded the panniers and the\r\ncuirasse of conventional costume.”\r\n\r\nIn the ballet of “Les Fêtes de l’Hymen et de l’Amour,” in 1766,\r\nGuimard had the misfortune to have one of her arms broken by a piece\r\nof falling scenery. Such was her place in public regard even at this\r\ntime, that a Mass was said at Notre-Dame for her recovery.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after success came to her that Guimard accepted the\r\nprotection of the notorious Prince de Soubise. One of her first\r\nacquisitions, in 1768, was a superb residence at Pantin, just outside\r\nParis, which was decorated by Fragonard. It was visited by everybody\r\nwho _was_ anybody, for, apart from the charms of its mistress, there\r\nwas a theatre in the mansion, where entertainments of a very special\r\nkind were staged, little poetic trifles or risky comedies, which\r\nwhile delighting a circle of appreciative connoisseurs would not have\r\nbeen staged in the ordinary way, as being caviare to the general.\r\n\r\nThe place at Pantin, however, did not suffice the exigent Madeleine,\r\nand a town-house was taken also in the Chaussée d’Antin,--next to\r\nthat of Sophie Arnould by the way--where another theatre was built\r\nand where even more festive entertainments were provided, a theatre\r\nwhich could seat five hundred persons (only present by invitation)\r\nwhich received the name of The Temple of Terpsichore. It was designed\r\nby the architect Ledoux, decorated by Fragonard, who did numerous\r\nlovely panels in which Guimard appeared; and by David, then a\r\nyouthful assistant, whom Madeleine’s generous aid is said to have\r\nsent to Rome for the furtherance of his art education.\r\n\r\nHere in the course of time all Paris came. Here Guimard held her\r\nfamous receptions--three a week, to the first of which were invited\r\nmembers of the Court circles, the aristocracy of the aristocracy;\r\nto the second--artists, actors, actresses, musicians, poets, the\r\naristocracy of the world of intellect; to the third--all the polished\r\nrakes and roués, with their attendant Phrynes, the aristocracy of\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nThere seem to have been wild times in the Chaussée d’Antin Hôtel, and\r\nsome of Madeleine’s private theatrical productions must have been\r\nworthy of tottering Rome. Well might discreet Abbés, and reputedly\r\nvirtuous ladies of the Court hide behind the curtains of the darkened\r\nand mysterious boxes with which her theatre was provided. Not be seen\r\nwhile seeing was their only chance to retain a virtuous reputation!\r\nIt was now doubtless that after having long danced _le genre\r\nsérieux_, Guimard abandoned it as one record says for the _genre\r\nmixte_, and was “inimitable” in “les ballets Anacréontiques!”\r\n\r\nOne example of the sort of dramatic fare Madeleine was giving her\r\nguests on occasion at Pantin, or at the Chaussée d’Antin residence,\r\nwill suffice. In 1721 at the Château of St. Cloud, in the presence\r\nof the Duc d’Orléans as Regent, there had been given a ballet called\r\n“Les Fêtes d’Adam.” Some of her friends suggested that Madeleine\r\nshould go one better and produce a ballet on a classic subject with\r\nherself as Venus rising from the sea. But the Archbishop of Paris\r\ngot news of the affair and managed to nip the suggestion in the bud.\r\nPerhaps it was never seriously intended; it may have been “merely a\r\nsuggestion--nothing more.”\r\n\r\nOne of her first lovers was Delaborde the financier, poor only as\r\nan amateur musician, who directed her theatre at Pantin till it\r\nwas closed in 1770; and only of greater importance in her life,\r\nfinancially, was Soubise. But Madeleine had a particular _penchant_\r\nfor bishops it seems, and incidentally some of her later and most\r\ndevoted friends were De Jarente, Bishop of Orleans, De Choiseul, the\r\nArchbishop of Cambrai, and Desnos, Bishop of Verdun.\r\n\r\nThe first-named of these clerical worthies had the disposal of a\r\nwhole sheaf of livings, that is to say, he was supposed to have, but\r\nit was really Madeleine who allotted them--abbeys, priories, chapels\r\nand so forth. She did not forget her friends, and De Jarente found\r\nhimself unable to resist. “What Guimard wishes one must wish!” It was\r\nthis allotment of the bishops’ _feuille des bénéfices_ which drew\r\nfrom Sophie Arnould the whimsical remark that “_Ce petit ver à soie_\r\n(Guimard) _devrait être plus gras. Elle ronge une si bonne feuille._”\r\n\r\nAnother favour which, through the Prince de Soubise, Madeleine was\r\nable to dispense among her friends was permission to hunt in the\r\nRoyal forests, and it led to trouble on more than one occasion--her\r\nfriends were so much of a _genre mixte_.\r\n\r\nBut if men were weak where Guimard was concerned, there is no need\r\nto consider her as infamous. There is so often a tendency among\r\nchroniclers to consider that because a pretty woman, with every\r\ninducement to succumb to temptation, had a “protector,” all her men\r\nfriends found her equally ready to receive their attentions. Nothing\r\ncould be more unjust. There may have been reasons why Madeleine did\r\nnot marry sooner than she did, and she may not have been quite that\r\nparagon of virtue our present time prefers, but in an age notorious\r\nfor its callousness and cruelty as well as for its moral laxity she\r\nwas distinguished as a woman not merely of fascination but of good\r\nheart and generous impulses.\r\n\r\nDid not one writer say of her that “_En quittant le théâtre, cette\r\nvirtuose emporta le genre agréable avec elle_?” Did not Marmontel,\r\nreferring to her well-known acts of charity, write of her the poem\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n             “Est-il bien vrai, jeune et belle damnée\r\n              Que, du théâtre embelli par tes pas,\r\n              Tu vas chercher dans le froid galetas,\r\n              L’humanité plaintive abandonnée?”\r\n\r\nDid not a preacher speak of her in the pulpit as “Magdalen not yet\r\nrepentant, but already charitable?” and add, too, that “The hand\r\nwhich gives so well will not be refused when knocking at the gates\r\nof Paradise?” And why? Because all who were in trouble had but to\r\nturn to Guimard for help--poor players, artists, poets, all. Because,\r\nthough every year she received a handsome present from Soubise, one\r\nyear, in 1768, when the winter had dealt cruelly with the Paris poor,\r\nshe begged that instead of sending her jewellery, the Prince would\r\nsend her the equivalent in money, and when she received it she added\r\nmore, and herself went to all the poor folk in her neighbourhood and\r\nfed the starving; went unostentatiously, from simple good-heartedness\r\nand sympathy; and it was the populace who spoke of it, not she.\r\n\r\nShe had her foibles, her little vanities perhaps, as when at\r\nLongchamps one summer she appeared in an equipage most gorgeously\r\nembellished with somewhat startling arms--mistletoe growing out of a\r\ngold mark, which glowed in the middle of a shield, the Graces serving\r\nas supports, with a group of Cupids as a crown.\r\n\r\nGuimard could be jealous on occasion. A Mlle. Dervieux, appearing\r\nas a singer at the Academy without success, had the audacity to\r\nreappear as a dancer and triumph. This Madeleine would possibly not\r\nhave minded, but her own pet poet Dorat celebrated Mlle. Dervieux’s\r\nsuccess in verse, and this poetic infidelity was more than Madeleine\r\ncould stand, with the consequence that all the pamphleteers of Paris\r\nwere forthwith ranged on sides and a paper war took place between the\r\nrival supporters of the two fair dancers, characters were torn to\r\nrags, and in the course of time the battle burnt itself out, as such\r\nusually do, without anyone being seriously the worse.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough it was just at this time that Guimard herself\r\nelected to make an appearance as a singer. When there was a revival\r\nof some of the old pieces in the repertoire of the Royal Academy,\r\nincluding “Les Fêtes d’Hébé ou les Talents Lyriques,” for which\r\nRameau had written the music, Guimard appeared in this as Aglaia, one\r\nof the three Graces--“with song and dance,” as one might say to-day.\r\nBut it was, as so often the case in modern days, only the charm of\r\nthe dance that made it possible to forgive the disillusion of the\r\nsong, for Madeleine’s voice was thin and hard.\r\n\r\nIt was as a dancer and always as a dancer that Guimard excelled.\r\nIt was as a dancer she won her chief successes in the ballets “La\r\nChercheuse d’Esprit” (1778), “Ninette à la Cour” (1778), “Mirza”\r\n(1779), “La Rosière” (1784) and “Le Premier Navigateur” (1785), all\r\nof which, by the way, were by Maximilien Gardel. Of her work in these\r\none historian has written: “Her dance was always noble, full of life,\r\nlight, expressive and voluptuous; her acting naïve, gay, piquante,\r\ntender and pathetic.” Connoisseurs reproached her at times for having\r\ngrown a little “mannered,” but she always preserved in her dance that\r\nfinish, even preciosity, and those delicate _nuances_ of style of\r\nwhich later times have proved the rarity.\r\n\r\nIt was as a dancer she had the good fortune to please the King who,\r\nalways a generous patron of the arts--with the nation’s money!--gave\r\nher for one dance she performed before him and the Queen, a pension\r\nof six thousand livres a year, giving at the same time a pension of\r\none thousand a year to the man who danced with her, Despréaux, who\r\nlater became her husband. This pension came to her the year following\r\nher appearance in “Le Premier Navigateur,” in 1786, apparently\r\njust at a time she was much in need of money. One may believe that\r\nMadeleine’s impulsive generosity had helped to bring about that need,\r\nas well as her known extravagance. For one thing, apart from her\r\nbeing ready to assist less fortunate artists, she had been the prime\r\nmover in an act of wholesale renunciation.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Soubise, in the manner of his King, a generous patron\r\nof the arts, had been allowing a handsome annual pension to a number\r\nof dancers at the Opera, as well as treating them all to periodical\r\nsupper-parties of most sumptuous kind. Suddenly the supper-parties\r\nceased, the Prince was no longer seen among the audiences at the\r\nOpera and it came to be known that his son-in-law, the Prince de\r\nGueméné, had become bankrupt, disastrously so, and that the entire\r\nfamily were doing their best to meet the creditors honourably. When\r\nthis was known all the dancers foregathered in Madeleine’s _loge_\r\nat the Opera and a stately, kindly, tactful letter was drawn up and\r\nsigned by all the _pensionnaires_, some thirty or more, headed by\r\nGuimard. The length of it precludes entire quotation in a chapter\r\nall too short to cover Madeleine’s crowded seventy-three years,\r\nbut after referring to their regret at the Prince’s absence, to a\r\ndelay in approaching him due to fear lest they be thought wanting\r\nin consideration, and to the urgent motive which had overcome such\r\ndelicate scruples on hearing the news of the bankruptcy confirmed on\r\nall sides, the writers of the letter proceed that, finding there can\r\nbe no prospect of the position improving, they feel they would be\r\nguilty of ingratitude were they not to imitate the Prince’s exemplary\r\nrenunciations on behalf of his relative, and restore the pensions\r\nwith which his generosity had provided them. “Apply,” the letter\r\ncontinues, “these revenues, Monseigneur, to the relief of so many\r\nold soldiers, poor men of letters, and such unhappy retainers as the\r\nPrince de Gueméné draws with him in his downfall. As for us, other\r\nresources remain. We shall have lost nothing, Monseigneur, if we\r\nretain your esteem. We shall even have gained if in refusing to-day\r\nyour kindly gifts we force our detractors to acknowledge that we were\r\nnot unworthy of them. We are, with deep respect, Monseigneur, your\r\nSerene Highness’s very humble servants, Guimard, Heinel, Peslin,\r\nDorival, etc., etc.” The letter is dated 6th December, 1782.\r\n\r\nIt was now that Guimard was paying periodical summer visits to London\r\nfor the Opera seasons. Edmond de Goncourt in his monograph on the\r\ndancer gives two very interesting letters written by Guimard apropos\r\nto these London sojourns, one to Perregaux the Banker, dated 20th\r\nJune, 1784, the other to M. de la Ferté, Director of the Académie,\r\ndated 26th May, (1786) and both addressed from No. 10, Pall Mall.\r\n\r\nIn the former she gives a spirited and amusing account of the way in\r\nwhich Gallini and Ravelli, then directing the Opera in London, had\r\nsought to take advantage of a fire at the old Opera House in order to\r\nbreak through the contract with Guimard by which she was to receive\r\nsix hundred and fifty guineas for the season. The fire seemed at\r\nfirst likely to put a closure on the season, but Covent Garden was\r\nplaced at the disposal of the Opera. Gallini, making alleged losses\r\nthe excuse, tried to persuade Madeleine to lower her terms for the\r\nrest of the season. Finding she would only agree to providing her\r\nown costumes--no light consideration--he pretended satisfaction and\r\ndeparted. Ravelli, however, followed and, evidently by arrangement,\r\ninformed her that Gallini was several kinds of idiot, and that he had\r\nbeen deposed in favour of Ravelli who, as the new stage-manager, came\r\nto offer her fresh terms--twenty-five louis a performance, on behalf\r\nof Gallini.\r\n\r\nGuimard smiled and expressed astonishment that Ravelli should make\r\nsuch propositions from Gallini since the latter was no longer in\r\npower, and added that she held them to her contract. When she turned\r\nup at rehearsal with a couple of witnesses and having consulted\r\nsolicitors, Ravelli “looked green” and Gallini “stupefied.” They\r\noffered fresh proposals and tried hard to wriggle out of their\r\ncontract but Guimard won, of course, and the more so in that though\r\nher chief friends among the English aristocracy, notably the Duchess\r\nof Devonshire, were out of town, enough were left to make things\r\nuncomfortable for Gallini, who found his conduct the talk of the town.\r\n\r\nThe second letter, to M. la Ferté, is mainly good advice on the\r\ndirection of the Opera and encouragement of rising talent, and for\r\nthis giving of counsel she begs that he will excuse her since it\r\nis out of friendship for him and also on account of her desire, in\r\nher own words, “_ne pas voir détruire entièrement la belle danse,\r\nque j’ai vu exister à l’Opéra_.” In both letters she sends--in\r\nthe inevitable postscript!--charming messages to the wives of her\r\ncorrespondents and mentions some little commissions with which they\r\nhad entrusted her.\r\n\r\nThat she did not have a bad time in London may be gathered from the\r\nfact that she excuses herself for not having written sooner because\r\nsince she arrived in town she had not been left a minute to herself\r\nby “_les plus grandes dames_,” and principally by the Duchess of\r\nDevonshire with whom she spent most of the time that she had away\r\nfrom the theatre; and of the London audiences generally she remarks:\r\n“_Ils m’aiment à la folie, ces bons Anglais!_” Not the first time a\r\ncharming foreign dancer has been beloved of “_ces bons Anglais!_”\r\n\r\nBut with all the friendship of the great and the love of the populace\r\nand her six hundred and fifty guineas for the London season,\r\nGuimard’s financial position was not what it had been. The Soubise\r\npension had been relinquished; that she received from the King in\r\nview of twenty years’ service at the Opera hardly sufficed her rather\r\nmagnificent requirements, and the time came, in 1786, when she found\r\nit convenient to dispose of her mansion in the Chaussée d’Antin.\r\nThis she did by arranging, without police sanction, a lottery, the\r\ntickets for which numbered two thousand five hundred, at a hundred\r\nand twenty livres each, a total sum of three hundred thousand livres.\r\nThere was a fierce demand for the tickets, and twice the number could\r\nhave been sold. The drawing took place in a salon of the Hôtel des\r\nMenus-Plaisirs, Rue Bergère, on the 1st of May, 1786, and Madeleine’s\r\nmansion with all its furniture went to the Comtesse du Lau, who, by\r\nthe way, had only taken one ticket!\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting now that Madeleine had reached the age of\r\nforty-three, that she had never been pretty and that she was marked\r\nwith smallpox, with which--a current danger at those times--she had\r\nbeen attacked in 1783. To a clever and magnetic personality age\r\nmatters not, nor do looks mean everything since in any case they are\r\nbound to alter in the course of a few decades; and even smallpox is\r\nnot fatal to fascination. But these things, nevertheless, have to be\r\nadmitted when one comes to years of discretion, and forty-three may\r\nbe accounted such. One wonders whether Madeleine, who was eminently\r\na woman of sense, began about now to face facts and the future, and\r\nwhether the doing so, or else mere circumstances, political and\r\nsocial, impelled her to the next step in her career.\r\n\r\nPeople had wondered how Guimard had managed to keep exactly the\r\nsame appearance for so many years. This was the secret! When she\r\nwas twenty she had a portrait painted that was true to life and\r\nafterwards, for some twenty years or so, every morning she would\r\nstudy this and make herself up to resemble it exactly; and neither\r\nlover nor friend was ever admitted to this toilette.\r\n\r\nThis was an ingenious idea, but it could not last for ever. It is\r\nall the more interesting then to note the next important incident in\r\nGuimard’s career. Ninon de l’Enclos, acting on the principle that\r\nit’s never too late to have a lover, flirted when she was ninety.\r\nGuimard gave up lovers when she was past forty and took a husband, a\r\nman, moreover, whom she had known for years.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, Guimard retired from the Opera; in 1789 she married Jean\r\nDespréaux, dancer and poet; and in 1789 the gathering storms of\r\nRevolution broke and Paris, smitten first by famine, became for the\r\nnext few years a hell, in which strangely enough, there was still a\r\ndemand for entertainment lighter and less fervid than massacre.\r\n\r\nWhen Guimard and Despréaux--comrades for at least twenty-five\r\nyears--married, they settled down, on a fairly comfortable income,\r\nderived from their pensions and acquired property, at Montmartre\r\nand one of Jean’s poems gives a charming picture of their retreat\r\nin those troubled times. But during the Revolution, State finances\r\nwere in disorder, and pensions were curtailed or discontinued and\r\nall the old favourites of the Opera were more or less involved in\r\ndifficulties. In 1792, the city of Paris having confided the care\r\nof the Opera to Francoeur and Celerier, they nominated Despréaux\r\ndirector of the theatre and a member of the administrative committee,\r\nbut this did not last. The following year Francoeur and Celerier\r\nwere imprisoned, the actors were authorised to manage the theatre\r\nthemselves and Despréaux--whose father, by the way, who had been\r\nleader of the orchestra at the Opera, killed himself the same year\r\nfrom despair at the general ruin around him--was allotted some part\r\nin the management of the public fêtes.\r\n\r\nIn 1796--the year of the establishment of the Directory--Madeleine\r\nmade a reappearance at a benefit given on January 23rd for the\r\nveteran performers at the Opera who had all suffered grievous\r\nlosses in the Revolution. In 1807, three years after the crowning\r\nof Napoleon, by which time the national ferment had begun to\r\nsettle down a little and the languished arts to take hope again,\r\nan Imperial decree dated July 29th, reduced the number of theatres\r\nin Paris to eight, and the Académie Impériale de Musique--as it\r\nwas now called--had for Director, Picard, the comic poet, and for\r\n“inspecteur”--Despréaux.\r\n\r\nBut these casual and precarious employments were not enough to remedy\r\nthe losses that husband and wife sustained in the lean and fevered\r\nyears from 1789, when they settled down in their high-perched nest\r\noverlooking all Paris in Montmartre until 1807, when Despréaux became\r\nagain attached to the Opera, and that this employment too did not\r\nlast we know from a letter which Madeleine wrote to a friend in 1814\r\nimploring him to use his influence with people at Court to obtain\r\nfrom Louis XVIII some position for her husband, a letter in which she\r\nmentions the loss of their entire fortune owing to the Revolution\r\nand pleads that “_nos besoins sont bien urgents_.”\r\n\r\nThere is then every probability that their needs really were urgent.\r\nGuimard had never been charged with thrift; and Despréaux was a poet.\r\nBoth started married life with a fair capital--all things henceforth\r\nheld in common of course, according to the law--but fortune was\r\nagainst them, and though they might perhaps have weathered the storm\r\nhad they been twenty years younger, it was almost inevitable that,\r\ntheir pensions gone, their capital diminishing, they should find the\r\nstruggle growing yearly harder and their chances of replenishing\r\ntheir coffers less and less. De Goncourt gives what one cannot but\r\nfeel is a too idyllic picture of the last years of the old couple,\r\nmainly on the basis of Jean’s poems (and _he_ was ever an optimist!)\r\nbut he also gives us one true, interesting, and poignant glimpse of\r\nMadeleine as an old lady who, with her toy theatre, would, for the\r\namusement of friends who chanced to drop in, go through the scenes of\r\nformer splendour and with her frail fingers perform the steps that\r\nhad made her famous in many a ballet of the past.\r\n\r\nApparently Madeleine’s appeal to friends at Court must have had some\r\nsuccess for Despréaux. In the following year, 1815, he was appointed\r\ninspector-general of the Court entertainments, and professor “_de\r\ndanse et de grâces_” at the Conservatoire. But it is probable that\r\nonly the last three or four years of their married life brought them\r\nany return of fortune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Madeleine Guimard\r\n\r\n(_From the painting by Fragonard_).]\r\n\r\nMadeleine died on May 4th, 1816, and, for years out of sight of\r\na public which had long had other and less gracious objects for\r\nthought, her death passed almost unnoticed by the populace for whose\r\namusement she had worked so loyally in her prime. Four years later,\r\non March 26th, 1820, Despréaux followed her who had been his adored\r\ncomrade for the greater portion of their lives. He had seen her,\r\nas little more than a child, win her earliest triumphs at the Opera,\r\nhad seen her growing splendour as a woman of fashion, watched her\r\nthrough many years, danced with her, written for her and about her,\r\nseen her worst and best, and loved her well enough all through to\r\nwait till she would consent to marry him and with him retire from the\r\nstage they had so long adorned; and through the years, troublous for\r\nno fault of theirs, which followed their marriage, he cheered and\r\nconsoled her for all she had relinquished, for the public worship all\r\nforegone, and for the neglect of the rising generation.\r\n\r\nHe it was who, though their means can hardly have permitted it,\r\ninstituted the little _déjeuners_ and supper-parties of kindred\r\nspirits, where songs were written and ballads sung in praise of love\r\nand wine and “la Gloire”--the one cry of the French Romanticists;\r\nall, one may well think, to cheer his beloved whose charm and\r\ngoodness, poet himself, he never ceased to sing.\r\n\r\nAll this could not have been had not Guimard, with all her faults had\r\nmore reserves of goodness than her earlier circumstances can have\r\ngiven opportunity for developing. Guimard had been grand; Guimard had\r\nbeen gay; but through it all Guimard must have been good in heart,\r\nfull of sympathy and courage and generous charities of mind and soul;\r\nand Despréaux, gentle, wise, humorous, idealistic, honest, must have\r\nfound her so, to speak and write of her as he always did, with ardour\r\nand a kind of boyish awe, even after she had passed away. No note of\r\ndiscord marred their married years, and when Guimard came to make\r\nher exit from the stage of life, silently, with nothing but ghostly\r\nmemories of applause, her comrade, well we may be sure, waited only\r\nwith impatience for his cue to follow her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GUIMARD SPEAKS\r\n\r\n                             (Ætat. 70)\r\n\r\n             “Yes, ye may laugh at Mère Guimard,\r\n              Laugh well, my girls, while laugh ye may!\r\n              But none of ye will fare as far\r\n              As I, who long have had my day.\r\n              Time was when Paris all did pray\r\n              Because I broke my arm!

Sans-graces! A mere ‘Squelette!’\r\n           But grace I _had_, and have, to-day\r\n           O’er those whom Death did not forget.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nDESPRÉAUX, POET AND--HUSBAND OF GUIMARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be nothing more irksome to a man than to be known merely as\r\nthe husband of his more famous wife.\r\n\r\nIn speaking, however, of Despréaux as “husband of Guimard,” it\r\nis not my intention to cast any slight on an estimable and, in\r\nhis own time, well-known personality; but I do so merely that the\r\nreader will thereby be able to “place” her genial and accomplished\r\nhusband, M. Despréaux to whom reference has already been made. He\r\nwas born in 1748, five years after Mlle. Guimard, and was the son\r\nof a musician at the Paris Opera, where he himself was entered as a\r\nsupernumerary-dancer in 1764. He made rapid progress in the art of\r\nhis choice and won increasing reputation until, unhappily a wound in\r\nthe foot completely closed his career as a “star,” and being a man\r\nof much theatrical experience and general culture, he then became a\r\n_maître de ballet_ and also gave dancing lessons. In 1789 he married\r\nMadeleine Guimard, whom he had long worshipped, and the two retired,\r\nas we know, at the opening of the Revolution to a cosy nest on the\r\nheights of Montmartre. So high, indeed, were they and so steep was\r\nthe roadway approaching their dwelling, that the patrols refrained\r\nfrom troubling them, and save for financial losses, and rumours of\r\nrevolution and distant guns, the couple remained untroubled by the\r\nred and raging Anarchy in the city stretched at their feet.\r\n\r\nEdmond de Goncourt makes out--on what authority I cannot fathom--that\r\nDespréaux was born in 1758, and _not_ 1748, thus making him out to\r\nbe fifteen years the junior of Guimard when they married in 1789. As\r\non other points he writes with such accuracy and copious wealth of\r\ndetail one might suppose him to be correct, but seeing that Despréaux\r\nwas undoubtedly entered a supernumerary-dancer in the Opera in 1764,\r\nand could hardly have been so at the age of six, one can only infer\r\na slip of the pen, and that Goncourt really meant 1748, which would\r\nmake the young male dancer’s age the likelier one of sixteen on\r\nappearing at Opera as a super, although he would, of course, have\r\nbeen training earlier.\r\n\r\nThe question of age, however, is comparatively small. The thing that\r\nmatters for us is that Despréaux, following modestly in the footsteps\r\nof his far greater predecessor Boileau-Despréaux (not an ancestor, by\r\nthe way) had cultivated a taste for poetry, and during his retirement\r\nat Montmartre, divided his time between amusing his wife and friends\r\nwith cutting silhouettes--at which he was an expert--and singing\r\nsongs and parodies which he wrote himself.\r\n\r\nIt seems an odd thing, does it not? that a man should be thus amusing\r\nhimself and his friends--should be sufficiently undistracted to do\r\nso--while the greatest revolution then known to history should be in\r\nprogress. But what could he do? He was a dancer, a singer, an artist;\r\nand could have had little weight had he meddled in the risky game of\r\npolitics. As it was, perhaps, he chose the saner course, and when\r\nmost were losing their heads he kept his own, and, as Richard Cœur de\r\nLion had when in prison, wiled away the hours in song.\r\n\r\nHis poems were collected and published in two volumes under the\r\ntitle: “_Mes Passe-Temps: Chansons, suivies de l’Art de la Danse,\r\npoème en quatre chants, calqué sur l’Art Poétique de Boileau\r\nDespréaux._” They were “adorned” with engravings after the design of\r\nMoreau Junior, and the music of the songs appears at the end of the\r\nsecond volume.\r\n\r\nThe work was published after the Revolution fever had subsided,\r\nin 1806, and perhaps the very strangest comment on the Revolution\r\nis implied in Despréaux’s preface, which calmly opens with the\r\nfollowing: “In 1794 I suggested to a number of friends that we should\r\nmeet once or twice a month to dine together, under the condition that\r\npolitics should never be mentioned, and that each should bring a song\r\ncomposed upon a given word. My proposition was taken up; we decided\r\nthat the words should be drawn by lot, after being submitted to the\r\njudgment of the gathering, in order to eliminate subjects which might\r\nonly present needless difficulties.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the year 1794, being one of the worst of all those red years\r\nof Revolution, this little centre went placidly through it, dining\r\nand wining and rhyming, as if there were nothing worse than a sham\r\nfight raging round the distant horizon. It positively makes one\r\nwonder if there _was_ a French Revolution after all. But no, there\r\nevidently was, for our author had a nice little library, and in the\r\nfollowing year, owing to monetary losses occasioned by the general\r\n_débâcle_, had to sell many of his beloved volumes. Of course he\r\nmade song about it--“Ma Bibliothèque, ou Le Cauchemar”--in which he\r\npictures the spectre of want asking him what he will do, and urging\r\nhim to sell his books for food. “Que feras-tu, Despréaux?” the\r\nnightmare questions:\r\n\r\n                  “Ni bois ni vin dans ta cave\r\n                   De chandelle pas un bout:\r\n                   Faussement on fait le brave\r\n                   Lorsque l’on manque de tout!\r\n\r\n                        *       *       *\r\n\r\n                   Une tartine de beurre\r\n                   Vaut plus que jadis un bœuf\r\n                   Dans un mois, à pareille heure\r\n                   Quel sera le prix d’un œuf?\r\n                   Par décade mille livres\r\n                   Ne peuvent payer ton pain\r\n                   Mon ami, _mange tes livres_\r\n                   _Pour ne pas mourir de faim_.”\r\n\r\nThe spectre points out that the prospect of having to do so is\r\nno mere dream and urges him to sell “_tous tes auteurs fameux_,”\r\npointing out that he could live on the “divine” Homer for at least\r\na day or two, while on the “pensif” Rousseau he could exist a long\r\ntime. He could count on his precious Virgil for the rent, while the\r\ntranslation “de Delille” should yield his old gardener’s wages. Among\r\nthe many works mentioned in indiscriminate order are Plutarch, La\r\nFontaine, Don Quichotte, Anacreon, Newton, Milton, Cicero, Horace,\r\nJuvenal, Boccaccio, Erasmus, Montesquieu, Boileau, Corneille,\r\nVoltaire, Racine, Favart, Molière, Plato, Dorat, Seneca, and a set of\r\nthe British Drama!\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, by the way, that Despréaux had some knowledge of\r\nEnglish and had paid occasional visits to London with his wife, who\r\nwas rather a favourite of the then Duchess of Devonshire, and in one\r\nof his poems he gives an amusingly bitter “Tableau de Londres,” in\r\nwhich he complains of--\r\n\r\n                    “Cette atmosphère de cendre\r\n                     Qui ne cesse de descendre,”\r\n\r\nspeaks of the lower classes as “insolent” and chaffs the English\r\ntaste for beer and the eternal “roast-biff” (_sic_); while as to the\r\nEnglish Sunday, the stanza must really be given in full:\r\n\r\n                  “Deux cents dimanches anglais,\r\n                   N’en valent pas un français,\r\n                   Ce jour, si joyeux en France,\r\n                   Est le jour de pénitence;\r\n                   Et lorsqu’un Anglais se pend\r\n                       Se pend, se pend,\r\n                   C’est un dimanche qu’il prend;\r\n                   A Paris, le dimanche on danse.\r\n                       Vive la France!”\r\n\r\nOur poet’s range of subject was remarkable--high philosophy,\r\ndiscussed with smiling raillery; curious life-contrasts, like that\r\nof his wife being a popular dancer and his sister a nun; charades,\r\ndialogues, charming and pathetic little word-pictures like “La\r\nNeige,” a “Bacchic” song on “The End of the World,” and so forth,\r\nnothing seemed to come amiss that could be turned into song.\r\nThroughout his varied work there runs a consistent strain of Gallic\r\ngaiety--itself a form of bravery; and if his Muse has not the hard,\r\nbiting intensity of a Villon, nor the lofty rhetoric of a Victor\r\nHugo, it manages to keep a middle course of sanity and pleasantry\r\nwith invariable success and an infallible though limited appeal.\r\n\r\nAmong his many ingenious poems are two of special interest to\r\nstage-folk of all time, one “Le Langage des Mains,” _Chanson\r\nPantomime_, the other “Le Langage des Yeux”; both of which require to\r\nbe illustrated by the actor who sings them and emphasise the need of\r\nfacial and manual expression. As he truly says:\r\n\r\n              “Le comédien ou l’orateur,\r\n               Sans mains, serait un corps sans âme.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the poems appears the phrase, “La Walse (_sic_) aux\r\nmille tours,” while among the notes at the end of the volume is a\r\ndefinition which may be translated as follows: Walse--a Swiss dance\r\nthe music of which is in 3-4 time; but it has only the value of two\r\nsteps. It is done by a couple pirouetting while circling round the\r\nsalon. It has nothing in it of complexity; it is the art in its\r\ninfancy. When its rhythm is in 2 time it is called “_sauteuse_.” The\r\nword “_sauteuse_” suggests the ordinary polka in 2-4 time, in the\r\ncustomary manner, for any dance described as “sauteuse” means one\r\nin which the feet are raised from the ground, or in which leaping\r\nis indulged in, _not_ when the feet glide on the ground, as in\r\nthe modern waltz. The old _volta_, from which the modern waltz is\r\nderived, was, it will be remembered, a _leaping_ dance.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the second volume is mainly devoted to his\r\nlengthy paraphrase of the great Boileau’s “L’Art Poétique,” under the\r\ntitle of “L’Art de la Danse,” which is full of sound instruction to\r\ndancers and interesting criticism of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA CENTURY’S CLOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have lingered somewhat over these sketches of the eighteenth\r\ncentury; let us hasten over that century’s close, for was it not\r\nsteeped in blood?\r\n\r\n“Revolution,” did they not call the madness which seized France?\r\nHeralded by fair promises of universal brotherhood, what did all the\r\nfine talk of her “intellectuals” and “philosophs” end in? A state of\r\nanarchy, national madness; in which no man’s life was safe, and no\r\nwoman’s honour.\r\n\r\nWar is horrible enough between nations. What, then, is universal war\r\nbetween individuals, “men, _brother_ men?”\r\n\r\nStrange, is it not, that while the dying century was performing\r\nits dance of death, theatres should be open; operas, comedies, and\r\nballets be performed.\r\n\r\nBefore Guimard and her literary husband had begun to find their\r\nfortunes affected by the advent of the popular madness called\r\nRevolution, there were few theatres in Paris. Indeed, there were only\r\nfive of any importance giving daily performances in 1775 and of these\r\nthe Opera was of course the leading house as of old--the work of\r\nGluck, Grétry, Piccinni and Sacchini holding the bill in Opera, for\r\na period of some thirty years onward, the work of ballet composition\r\nbeing mainly in the hands of Noverre and the brothers Maximillian and\r\nPierre Gardel.\r\n\r\nIt was from the end of that year, too, when Noverre’s “Médée et\r\nJason” was produced that the novelty of ballet-pantomime, having\r\ncome to replace the earlier opera-ballet, now became generally known\r\nsimply as ballet.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 the Paris Opera was the scene of a tremendous conflagration,\r\nin which, owing to the presence of mind of Dauberval, one of\r\nthe leading dancers, in quickly lowering the curtain, during a\r\nperformance of the ballet, the audience were able to escape, but\r\nseveral of the dancers were burnt, and Guimard herself, discovered\r\ncowering in one of the boxes clad only in her underwear, was rescued\r\nby one of the stage hands. The famous house was ruined, and the\r\ncompany removed to a provisional house erected by the architect\r\nLenoir by the Porte St. Martin.\r\n\r\nTen years later, in 1791, a Royal decree establishing the freedom\r\nof the drama did away with the former paucity of Paris in regard to\r\nplaces of amusement, and in that year alone eighteen new theatres\r\nwere added to those already in existence, and old ones sometimes\r\nchanged their names.\r\n\r\nThe Opera was known as _L’Académie Royale de Musique_. Then the\r\nKing having displeased his people and fled to Varennes, it became\r\nsimply the _Opera_. Then the King having pleased his subjects they\r\ngraciously permitted a return to _L’Académie Royale_. Then, a month\r\nlater, in October, 1791, it became the _Opera-National_; and later\r\nthe _Théâtre des Arts_, all of which changes foreshadowed in a way\r\nthe advent of blind Revolution; and the next change of title to\r\n_Théâtre de la République et des arts_; which yet was not its final\r\ntitle. Meanwhile, what of the dancers?\r\n\r\nGuimard had left the stage in 1790. Two years later the leaders\r\nof the ballet were Mlle. Miller (later to become Madame Pierre de\r\nGardel), Mlle. Saulnier, Mlle. Roze, Madame Pérignon, Mlle. Chevigny.\r\n\r\nPierre Gardel, born in 1758 at Nancy, had been _maître de ballet_\r\nat the Opera from 1787, and had produced “Télémaque,” “Psyché,” and\r\nother ballets out of which he made a fortune. “Psyché” alone was\r\ngiven nearly a thousand times! In most of them Madame Gardel appeared\r\nand with remarkable success. At fifty, as at twenty, she was still\r\nadmired. She was an excellent mime, a graceful dancer in all styles,\r\nseemed in each new _rôle_ to surpass herself, and Noverre, describing\r\nher feet, said “they glittered like diamonds.”\r\n\r\nThen there were the brothers Malter, the one known as “the bird,” the\r\nother as “the Devil,” because he usually played the _rôles_ of demons.\r\n\r\nMadame Pérignon, who succeeded Madame Dauberval (_née_ Mlle.\r\nTheodore), was a dancer of talent, but was considerably surpassed\r\nby Mlle. Chevigny of whom an eyewitness of her dancing remarked:\r\n“_Quelle verve! quelle gaîté dans le comique! dans les rôles sérieux,\r\nquelle chaleur! quel pathétique! Tout le feu d’une véritable actrice\r\nbrillait dans ses beaux yeux._”\r\n\r\nThen there were Miles. Allard, Peslin, Coulon, Clotilde, Beaupré,\r\nBrancher, Chameroy; Gosselin, who was, despite _embonpoint_, so\r\nsupple as to win the nickname “the Boneless”; Fanny Bias, and\r\nBigottini; and M. Laborie, who in 1790 had “created” the title-_rôle_\r\nin “Zephyre;” Messieurs Lany, Dauberval; Deshayes, a marvel of\r\nsoaring agility; Henry, whose mobile figure recalled “le grand\r\nDupré”; Didelot, Duport; Auguste Vestris, with whom we have already\r\ndealt; and Lepicq, known as the Apollo of the Dance.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Revolution the theatres had been open, and had been\r\nfull. The people had gone mad with lust of blood and lust of power;\r\nbut the dancers continued to maintain their aplomb in difficult\r\n_poses_, and pick their steps, more carefully amid the lit and\r\nflowered splendours of the theatre, than statesmen could theirs upon\r\nthe blood-stained slippery mire of current “politics.”\r\n\r\nFrance might hold its fantastic State ballet, the Fête of the\r\nSupreme, indeed might go stark mad, and all Law and Order and Reason\r\nbe overthrown, but one man, the greatest world-man known to history,\r\nwas gathering strength to bring order out of chaos, to remake a\r\nnation and a nation’s laws; to set the world a-wondering if he should\r\nmaster it.\r\n\r\nStrangest of all, perhaps, that he, the great Napoleon, should have\r\nfound time to flirt with a ballet-dancer--the famous Bigottini, of\r\nwhom the Countess Nesselrode in her letters said that the effect she\r\nproduced with her dancing and miming was so moving as to make even\r\nthe most hardened man weep.\r\n\r\nBut she seemed rather to have amused Napoleon, more especially when,\r\nhaving told the President of the Legislative Chamber, Fontanes, to\r\nsend her a present, she received a collection of French classics;\r\nand on being asked later by Napoleon--unaware of the nature of the\r\ngift--if she was content with Fontanes’ choice, she exclaimed that\r\nshe was not entirely.\r\n\r\n“How so?” asked Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBigottini’s reply must be given in the original.\r\n\r\n“Il m’a payée en _livres_; j’aurais mieux aimé en _francs_.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the library, Mlle. Bigottini became a millionaire--in\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BOOK III: THE MODERN ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it had not died during the Revolutionary period, either in\r\nParis or London, the art of Ballet, from the death of Louis XV was\r\nreally of little artistic interest, and was to remain so until the\r\nfamous ’Forties of last century.\r\n\r\nThe dancers were mostly mechanical; the ballets uninspired; the\r\nmounting meretricious; and it was not till the ’forties of last\r\ncentury that a new and all-surpassing _danseuse_, Marie Taglioni,\r\ncame to infuse a new spirit into the art and found a tradition that\r\nholds to-day.\r\n\r\nIn London Ballet was in almost the same state as in Paris, but not\r\nquite, possibly because having been always imported at its best, it\r\nhad had less opportunity of becoming hide-bound by tradition at its\r\nworst, as in the case of an old-established continental school. For\r\nthe continued production of soundly artistic ballet the existence of\r\na good school is a necessity, a school founded and sustained on right\r\nprinciples. But in its continued existence there is inevitably danger\r\nof ultimate stultification from the “setting” of the very tradition\r\nit has created, unless there is a perpetual infusion of new ideas.\r\n\r\nIn Paris the new idea was not then encouraged, if it came counter to\r\nthe traditional technique of which the Vestris, father and son, were\r\nthe supreme exponents.\r\n\r\nIn London there was more freedom, because there was less of\r\ntradition; and while we had to wait until the mid-’forties for the\r\nproductions which were to the Londoners of the early Victorian period\r\nwhat the Russian ballet has been to Londoners in recent years, there\r\nwas some fairly sound work being done here from 1795 to 1840.\r\n\r\nI have, among my books, a volume of libretti of ballets composed\r\nby Didelot and produced at the King’s Theatre, Haymarket, from\r\n1796 to 1800. It contains “Sappho and Phaon,” _grand ballet\r\nérotique, en quatre actes_; “L’Amour Vengé,” _ballet épisodique,\r\nen deux actes, dans le genre anacréontique_; “Flore et Zephire,”\r\n_ballet-divertissement_, in one act; “The Happy Shipwreck, or\r\nThe Scotch Witches,” a dramatic ballet in three acts; “Acis and\r\nGalatea,” a pastoral ballet in one act; and “Laura et Lenza, or The\r\nTroubadour,” a grand ballet in two acts, “performed for the first\r\ntime for the benefit of Madame Hilligsberg,” who played Laura.\r\n\r\n“Laura and Lenza,” is of particular interest to us to-day, for among\r\nthe performers, in addition to M. Didelot, who played the troubadour\r\nhero, Lenza, was a M. Deshayes--a capable dancer and producer of\r\nballet in London and Paris--and a Mr. d’Egville, bearer of a name\r\nwhich is well-known in both cities at the present day.\r\n\r\n“Flora et Zephire,” was the most popular, and was frequently revived\r\neven as late as the ’thirties, when Marie Taglioni made her _début_\r\nin it at King’s Theatre, for Laporte’s benefit, on June 3rd, 1830.\r\n\r\nBoth in Paris and London, however, during the first two decades of\r\nthe nineteenth century Ballet was comparatively undistinguished\r\nand it was not really until the ’thirties that it began to assume\r\nnew interest. True, there were in Paris, some remarkable exponents\r\nof advanced technique as regards dancing, but in the glamour of\r\ntechnical achievement the greater idea of the art of Ballet was\r\nsomewhat obscured.\r\n\r\nAt the Paris Opera the _dieux de la danse_ were MM. Albert Paul\r\nand Ferdinand, all of whom visited London from time to time and\r\nthe second of whom was known as _l’aérien_, a descriptive nickname\r\nemphasised by the quaint criticism of a contemporary who wrote: “Paul\r\nused to spring and bound upwards, and was continually in the clouds;\r\nhis foot scarcely touched the earth or rather the stage; he darted up\r\nfrom the ground and came down perpendicularly, after _travelling a\r\nquarter of an hour in the air_!”\r\n\r\nM. Paul, by the way, later became a celebrated dancing-master at\r\nBrighton, in good Queen Victoria’s early days.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there was Paul’s sister who became Madame Montessu, hardly\r\nless celebrated than her brilliant brother. Then, too, Mlle. Brocard,\r\nwho so won Queen Victoria’s girlish admiration that some of her dolls\r\nwere dressed to represent the pretty dancer in character. Brocard,\r\nhowever, was more remarkable for her beauty than for her dancing.\r\n\r\nAnother famous artist of the period was M. Coulon, to whose careful\r\ntuition the graceful, and _élégante_ Pauline Duvernay owed much of\r\nher success, as did also the sisters Noblet--Lise and Alexandrine,\r\nthe latter of whom forsook the dance to become an actress.\r\n\r\nOf Lise Noblet a contemporary chronicler wrote in 1821: “_Encore un\r\nphénix! Une danseuse qui ne fait jamais de faux pas, qui préfère le\r\ncercle d’amis à la foule des amants, qui vient au théâtre à pied, et\r\nqui retourne de même!_” In 1828, she created, with immense success,\r\nthe _rôle_ of Fenella, in _La Muette de Portici_, and was described\r\nas “_le dernier produit de l’école française aux poses géométriques\r\net aux écarts à angle droit_”; the same critic drawing an interesting\r\ncomparison between the old school and the rising new one, in adding:\r\n“_Déjà, Marie Taglioni s’avancait sur la pointe du pied--blanche\r\nvapeur baignée de mousselines transparentes--poétique, nébuleuse,\r\nimmatérielle comme ces fées dont parle Walter Scott, qui errent la\r\nnuit près des fontaines et portent en guise de ceinture un collier\r\nde perles de rosée!... Lise Noblet se résolut non sans combat--à\r\nprouver qu’il y a au monde quelque chose de plus agréable qu’une\r\nfemme qui tourne sur l’ongle de l’orteil avec une jambe parallèle\r\nà l’horizon, dans l’attitude d’un compas farée. Elle céda, à Fanny\r\nElssler, ‘Fenella’ de La Muette qu’elle avait créée, et lui prit en\r\néchange--‘El Jales de Jérès.’ ‘Las Boleros de Cadiz’ ‘La Madrileña,’\r\net toutes sortes d’autres cachuchas et fandangos. Grâce à ces\r\nconcessions, Mdlle. Noblet resta jusqu’en 1840, attachée à l’ Opéra._”\r\n\r\nThese references to contrast of styles, to Scott, and to Spanish\r\ndances are particularly interesting as illuminating the change which\r\nwas coming over the Ballet about 1820-1830. Mere technique as the\r\nchief aim of Ballet was beginning to fail. It had become too academic\r\nand needed the infusion of a new spirit of grace and freedom. It came\r\nin a sudden craze for national dances, particularly Slav and Spanish,\r\nand in the craze for Scott and all his works, which undoubtedly\r\nbecame an influence on Opera and Ballet, as they did on the forces\r\nwhich led to the growth of the great Romantic movement, of which\r\nHugo was to be hailed as leader and of which the effects passing\r\non through the Art and Literature of the ’fifties, ’sixties, and\r\n’seventies, can still perhaps be traced to-day.\r\n\r\nMuch of the popularity of the Spanish and Slav dances during the\r\nearly part of the nineteenth century was due to their frequent\r\nperformance by Pauline Duvernay, Pauline Leroux and the Elsslers.\r\nThere were two Elsslers, sisters, the elder of whom, Thérèse, was\r\nborn in 1808, and Fanny in 1810, both at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThérèse was less brilliant a dancer than her sister--whom she\r\n“mothered” always--but had a charming personality. She eventually\r\ngave up the stage to marry, morganatically, Prince Adalbert of\r\nPrussia, and was afterwards ennobled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fanny Elssler\r\n\r\n(_From an old engraving_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carlotta Grisi\r\n\r\n(_From a lithograph_).]\r\n\r\nAt the outset of her career Fanny achieved distinction, or had it\r\nthrust upon her, by becoming an object of the “grande passion,” on\r\nthe part of l’Aiglon, the Duc de Reichstadt, Napoleon’s ill-fated\r\nson. But it was said that the rumour was only put about by her astute\r\nmanager, in order to get the young dancer talked about, and as an\r\nadvertisement the manœuvre succeeded admirably.\r\n\r\nBoth sisters, after acquiring a favourable reputation in Germany,\r\ncame to London, and it was here, in 1834, that Véron, the manager of\r\nthe Paris Opera, came over to tempt them to appear in Paris with a\r\nsalary of forty thousand francs, twenty thousand each. Thinking to\r\nimpress the young Viennese with an example of Parisian magnificence,\r\nVéron gave a dinner-party in their honour at the Clarendon, in Bond\r\nStreet, to which the best available society was invited, and the\r\nmenu, the wine and the equipage were of unparalleled quality. At\r\ndessert an attendant brought a silver salver piled high with costly\r\npresents for the ladies of the company--pearls, rubies, diamonds,\r\nsuperbly set--a miniature Golconda. But somehow it all fell a trifle\r\nflat. The Elssler girls, true to their simple German training, drank\r\nonly water with their dinner, and with dessert merely accepted, the\r\none a hatpin, and the other a little handbag; and they would not\r\nagree to sign their contract until the day of Véron’s departure!\r\n\r\nBoth in Paris and London the sisters were triumphantly successful,\r\nand when in 1841 they toured through America they met with a\r\nreception that was sensational. It was “roses, roses all the\r\nway”; and in some of the towns triumphal arches were erected. At\r\nPhiladelphia their horses were unharnessed and their carriage drawn\r\nby the admiring populace, headed by the Mayor!\r\n\r\nFanny was an especial favourite, and when the sisters left New\r\nOrleans, some niggers, who were hoisting freight from the hold of an\r\nadjacent steamboat--and niggers are notoriously apt at catching up\r\ntopical subjects--thus chanted, as the vessel bearing the dancers\r\nleft the wharf:\r\n\r\n             “Fanny, is you going up de ribber?\r\n                      Grog time o’ day.\r\n              When all dese here’s got Elssler fever?\r\n                      Oh, hoist away!\r\n              De Lor’ knows what we’ll do widout you,\r\n                      Grog time o’ day.\r\n              De toe an’ heel won’t dance widout you.\r\n                      Oh, hoist away!\r\n              Day say you dances like a fedder,\r\n                      Grog time o’ day.\r\n              Wid t’ree t’ousand dollars all togedder.\r\n                      Oh, hoist away!”\r\n\r\nFanny Elssler was at her best in the ballet of “Le Diable Boiteux,” the\r\nplot of which is founded on Le Sage’s famous romance. An enthusiastic\r\ncontemporary described her in the following quaint terms: “_La_ Fanny\r\nis tall, beautifully formed, with limbs that strongly resemble the\r\nhunting Diana, combining strength with the most delicate and graceful\r\nstyle. Her small and classically shaped head is placed on her shoulders\r\nin a singularly elegant manner; the pure fairness of her skin requires\r\nno artificial whiteness; while her eyes beam with a species of playful\r\nmalice, well-suited to the half-ironical expression at times visible in\r\nthe corners of her finely curved lips. Her rich, glossy hair, of bright\r\nchestnut hue, is usually braided over a forehead formed to wear, with\r\nequal grace and dignity, the diadem of a queen, or the floral wreath of\r\na nymph; and though strictly feminine in her appearance, none can so\r\nwell or so advantageously assume the costume of the opposite sex.”\r\n\r\nAs a dancer she excelled in all spirited dances, such as the\r\n_Fandango_, and the _Mazurka_, while in the _Cachucha_ and the\r\n_Cracovienne_, she stirred her audience to a frenzy of admiration.\r\nThérèse Elssler retired from the stage in 1850. Fanny, a year later,\r\nmarried a rich banker, withdrew, and died in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nCARLO BLASIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dance and Ballet had made progress during the past two centuries\r\nand had reached the point when, unable to attain to greater\r\nperfection of technique, it needed some fresh artistic inspiration.\r\nItaly, however, had long been degenerate as regards the Dance, her\r\nwhole artistic ambition having expressed itself in Opera and an\r\nunrivalled excellence in vocal technique. So that towards the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century and for half the nineteenth, her singers were\r\nunmatched throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of French dancers and the production of some of\r\nthe ballets of French composers turned the attention of the lovers\r\nof _bel Canto_ to the possibilities of the sister art. Noverre\r\nhad produced some of his ballets at Milan, and his methods and\r\nartistic taste gradually spread through Italy, his influence being\r\nfurther extended by several of his Italian pupils, such as Rossi and\r\nAngiolini.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until Carlo Blasis came to preside over the\r\nImperial Academy of Dancing and Pantomime at Milan, 1837, that the\r\nItalian ballet began to assume any importance, and the Milan Academy,\r\nbecoming recognised as the first in Europe, came in turn to influence\r\nParis, London and other capitals of the world. Indeed, it is hardly\r\ntoo much to say that probably every opera house which has been\r\nestablished a century owes something directly or indirectly to the\r\ngenius of Carlo Blasis, who in his enthusiasm for, and appreciation\r\nof, the Dance and Ballet, and in his ability to write thereon\r\nwas another Noverre, but with an even wider range of talent and\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\nIn the history of art there can be few records of such amazing power\r\nof assimilation, combined with a high standard of achievement. We\r\nhave but to glance at a list of his works, to realise this. While\r\nthe theory and practice of dancing were his leading theme, one to\r\nwhich he returned again and again, few things failed to stimulate his\r\ninterest and his pen.\r\n\r\n“_Observations sur le Chant et sur l’Expression de la Musique\r\nDramatique_” were a series of essays contributed to a London paper.\r\nHe wrote considerably on the art of Pantomime. He contributed\r\nbiographies of Garrick and of Fuseli to a Milan periodical; and\r\nanother of Pergolesi to a German paper. A dissertation on “Italian\r\nDramatic Music in France,” was another of his subjects. He left\r\nin manuscript works on François Premier; on Lucan and his poem of\r\nPharsalia; on Alexander the Great; on the Influence of the Italian\r\nGenius upon the World; on the then Modern Greek Dances; on “_La\r\nGrande Epoque de Louis XV en France, en Italie, et en Angleterre_”;\r\na “Lexicon of Universal Erudition”; while perhaps the greatest of\r\nhis works--according to contemporary criticism--was “_L’Uomo Fisico,\r\nIntellettuale e Morale_,” a book of some thousand pages.\r\n\r\nHis education had been of a kind that should incline him to take,\r\nas Bacon did, “all knowledge,” for his province. Madrolle, the\r\nfamous French publicist of his period, described Blasis as “a man\r\nof the most comprehensive mind that he had ever known,” and further\r\ndeclared him “a universal genius.” Indeed, though he achieved fame\r\nas a _maître de ballet_, he seems really to have been a sort of\r\nsuper-maître of all the arts.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Naples on November 4th, 1803, the son of Francesco\r\nBlasis and Vincenza Coluzzi Zurla Blasis, both, it is said, of noble\r\ndescent. The family claimed an ancestry reaching back beyond the\r\nreigns of Tiberius and Augustus, when there were patricians known\r\nas the Blasii. Machiavelli mentions the same family, and various\r\nmonuments in Italy and Sicily bear the name of De Blasis.\r\n\r\nWhen Carlo was two years old, his father, who had forsaken the\r\nancestral profession of the sea for literature and music, took\r\nhis family from Naples to Marseilles, where the _De_ was dropped,\r\nfor political reasons, and the name became simply Blasis. Having\r\nstudied the tastes and tendencies of his children somewhat carefully\r\nFrancesco determined to give his son Carlo a thorough grounding\r\nin the classics and the fine arts. His daughter Teresa was taught\r\nsinging and the pianoforte; and his younger daughter Virginia, who\r\nwas born at Marseilles, was destined to Opera. It must be set to the\r\ncredit of the fond father’s discernment and influence that each of\r\nhis children achieved distinction in their own sphere and day.\r\n\r\nThe education of Carlo, we are told in a contemporary biography,\r\n“was at once literary and artistic and theatrical.” He showed such\r\nenthusiasm and ability in his studies that it was said that he might\r\neasily have become a painter, a composer of music, or a dancer and\r\nballet-master. He finally chose the last as his profession owing\r\nto the fact that it offered more lucrative prospects as well as\r\ncombining all the varied opportunities for artistic expression which\r\nhis young soul craved. In other directions, however, his general\r\neducation was not neglected, and the subjects he studied all came to\r\nbe employed in the profession he had chosen, rendering him valuable\r\nassistance in dancing, pantomime and the composition of ballets. In\r\nlater life when asked how he came to get through such masses of work\r\nas he did he used to declare: “_Le temps ne manque jamais à qui sait\r\nl’employer_,” and to add Tissot’s saying: “_Dormons, dormons, très\r\npeu; vivons toute notre vie, et pendant trois semaines que nous avons\r\nà vivre, ne dormons pas, ne soyons pas morts, pendant quinze jours._”\r\nIndeed, he _lived_ every minute of his incessantly active life, and\r\nin his later years seldom worked less than fifteen hours a day.\r\n\r\nAs a lad he studied music, in all its branches, with his father.\r\nDrawing, painting, modelling, architecture, geometry, mathematics,\r\nanatomy, literature and dancing he studied with some of the best\r\navailable masters of his period, at Marseilles, Rome, Florence,\r\nBordeaux, Bologna and Pavia; and when he came to practise his\r\nprofession as ballet-master and composer, he was able not only to\r\nevolve the plot of the ballet, and explain every situation, teach\r\nevery step and gesture and expression, but to furnish designs for the\r\ncostumes, scenery, and mechanical effects.\r\n\r\nHe was avid of learning, and absorbed something of value from all\r\nwith whom he came in contact. He haunted the artists’ studios and\r\nmade a special point of visiting all he could in any town in which\r\nhe happened to stay, Thorwaldsen, Longhi and Canova being among the\r\nmore prominent of the sculptors and artists whom he came to know. He\r\nbecame a connoisseur and collector of paintings, sculpture carvings,\r\ncameos, jewellery, old instruments; had a remarkable library, not\r\nonly of books in Greek, Latin, Italian, French, English, German and\r\nSpanish, but an interesting collection of music, from Palestrina to\r\nhis own time, his library and gallery being valued at somewhere about\r\nten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nHe started his professional career and travels at the age of twelve,\r\nwhen he appeared as a dancer in the leading theatre at Marseilles,\r\nthen at Aix, Avignon, Lyons, Toulouse; finally settling with his\r\nfamily for some time at Bordeaux, where he had a very successful\r\n_début_ and where--under the able direction of Dauberval, of whom\r\nwe have already heard--most of the best dancers in France appeared\r\npreparatory to an engagement in Paris.\r\n\r\nBlasis then received an invitation to the capital, where his _début_\r\nwas so extraordinarily successful that he was promptly placed in\r\nthe front rank, and for a time studied under the famous Gardel, who\r\nthought so highly of him that he selected for him as partner in\r\nseveral ballets, Mlle. Gosselin, one of the leading dancers at the\r\nOpera, followed by Mlle. Legallois, a dancer of the classic school.\r\n\r\nOn account of intrigues and cabals--which are not, alas, unusual in\r\nthe theatrical profession, or in any other perhaps--Blasis left the\r\nOpera and was next engaged at Milan, first going on a successful\r\ntour, during which he composed various ballets, notably “Iphigénie en\r\nAulide,” “La Vestale,” “Fernando Cortez,” “Castor and Pollux,” “Don\r\nJuan” and “Les Mystères d’Isis.”\r\n\r\nHis appearance at La Scala, Milan, was triumphant, and he remained\r\nthere for fourteen seasons, as dancer and ballet-composer. Then\r\nfollowed a successful Italian tour. Painters, sculptors and engravers\r\nas well as various poets celebrated his progress, and one Venetian\r\npainter, having seen him dancing some _pas de deux_ with his\r\nfamous partner Virginia Leon, in which they entwined and enveloped\r\nthemselves in rose-coloured veils--presumably very much as Mordkin\r\nand Pavlova did in the “L’Automne Bacchanale,” made sketches of the\r\nvarious graceful groupings and afterwards introduced them into the\r\ndecorations of an apartment in the house of a rich Venetian nobleman.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the appeal of Blasis’ work to artists was\r\ngreatly due not merely to his technical excellence as a dancer but to\r\nthe fact that--steeped as he was in the study of music, sculpture and\r\npainting--his work was a living expression of a classic art-spirit.\r\nAgain and again in his writings he emphasises the necessity the young\r\ndancer is under of studying not only music, but drawing, painting\r\nand sculpture. In one interesting passage, especially, he remarks:\r\n“It is in the best productions of painting and sculpture that the\r\ndancer may study with profit how to display his figure with taste\r\nand elegance. They are a fountain of beauties, to which all those\r\nshould repair who wish to distinguish themselves for the correctness\r\nand purity of their performances. In the Bacchanalian groups which\r\nI have composed, I have successfully introduced various attitudes,\r\narabesques and groupings, the original idea of which was suggested\r\nto me, during my journey to Naples and through _Magna Grecia_, on\r\nviewing the paintings, bronzes and sculptures rescued from the ruins\r\nof Herculaneum.”\r\n\r\nThe publication at Milan, of his first work, in French, _A\r\nTheoretical, Practical and Elementary Treatise on the Art of\r\nDancing_, brought Blasis into prominent notice throughout the\r\nContinent and in London, owing to press notices and demands for\r\ntranslations of a work that was unrivalled of its kind and is\r\nvaluable to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Blasis came to London, where, at the King’s Theatre,\r\nHaymarket, he was triumphantly received as dancer, actor and\r\nballet-composer. He remained here for some time, and in 1829-1830\r\npublished his still more important work, in English, namely, _The\r\nCode of Terpsichore_ in which the whole subject of dancing is\r\ndealt with exhaustively. The book was “embellished” with numerous\r\nline-engravings, accompanied by music, composed by his sisters,\r\nVirginia and Teresa Blasis, and was dedicated to Virginia, then Prima\r\nDonna of the Italian Opera at Paris. The work was an instant success\r\nand did much to further the aim which Blasis had in all his writings,\r\nnamely, the raising of the art of the Dance and Ballet nearer to a\r\nlevel with the other imitative arts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carlo Blasis\r\n\r\n(_From a lithograph_).]\r\n\r\nThe _maître_ now divided his time between England and Italy,\r\nsometimes appearing as a dancer, sometimes producing ballets of his\r\nown composition; or yet again as journalist and author, contributing\r\narticles to leading reviews, or seeing some fresh volume through the\r\npress, always occupied in propagating his school and principles,\r\ndemonstrating his method, and putting into practice wherever he went\r\nevery new improvement or suggestion which could advance the cause\r\nhe had at heart; always encouraging and inspiring all those of his\r\nprofession with whom he came in touch, with a newer and higher idea\r\nof the possibilities of theatrical dance and ballet. It was now said,\r\nindeed, that “all who followed the same profession became either his\r\ndisciples or imitators.”\r\n\r\nHis triumphs as a dancer, however, were unhappily cut short during an\r\nengagement at the San Carlo, Naples, by an accident which occurred\r\nduring rehearsal, some unaccountable injury to the left leg, for\r\nwhich every remedy was tried without avail. Though he was not unable\r\nhenceforth to perform the simpler and more natural movements he found\r\nhimself handicapped by a certain stiffness that made anything like a\r\n_cabriole_ or _entrechat_ impossible, and wisely decided to retire\r\nrather than diminish the fame he had already acquired as a dancer.\r\nHereafter it was as a composer of ballets and as a widely informed\r\nwriter on the arts that he elected to occupy himself, and in Italy,\r\nFrance and England--notably at Drury Lane--his productions both\r\non the stage and in the Press, won him increasing recognition and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Blasis was appointed by the Italian Government Director of\r\nthe Imperial Academy of Dancing and Pantomime at Milan, where the\r\nreforms he introduced and the new artistic ideal he created shortly\r\nraised it to the position of the leading Academy of the world.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the eighteenth century dancing and ballet at the Paris\r\nOpera, had grown, as we have seen, a stiff, formal, dull affair.\r\nCarlo Blasis’ rule at the Milan Academy, which put new life into the\r\nart, had a tremendous influence throughout the Continent, so much so\r\nindeed that Russia, Austria, France, and even England _all_ to-day\r\nowe something to the traditions of style and efficiency his genius\r\nlaid down at that time.\r\n\r\nThe system of training he instituted then is still much the same in\r\npresent-day opera-houses, from which most of the famous dancers are\r\ndrawn. Pupils entered the Milan Academy at an early age. No one was\r\nadmitted before the age of eight years, nor after twelve, if a girl,\r\nor fourteen, if a boy. They were to be medically examined, and be\r\nproved to have a robust constitution and to be in good health. They\r\nhad to be children of respectable parents; and, when admitted, were\r\nto remain in the school, devoted to its service and to the service of\r\nthe theatre for eight years. For the first three years they were to\r\nbe considered as apprentices and receive no salary; those who were\r\nqualified for performance in the theatre came to receive progressive\r\nsalaries. Their daily practice in the school was for three hours in\r\nthe morning, from nine to twelve, at dancing; after which they were\r\nto be exercised in the art of pantomime for one hour.\r\n\r\nTo-day the training is just as severe and much the same. For the\r\nRussian ballet pupils enter the Academy at Petrograd at the age\r\nof nine and remain till eighteen. Madame Karsavina, one of the\r\nmost finished dancers in the world, has told us how, even now, she\r\ncontinues to practise a couple of hours or more every day.\r\n\r\nA well-known Italian _maître de ballet_ at a famous West End theatre\r\nonce told me that he always practised dancing from two to three hours\r\na day, and “pantomime” or “mime,” as it is usually called, from one\r\nto two hours. Mlle. Génée, too, has stated that she practises from\r\ntwo to three hours daily. Such practice is necessary, not merely to\r\na pupil, but to a finished and successful dancer to keep the limbs\r\nabsolutely supple and enable the artist to give that impression of\r\nconsummate ease in performing the most difficult steps, which is the\r\ntrue test of the really great dancer; while the study of “miming”\r\nis equally necessary, since it is the art which gives life and\r\nexpression to the dance.\r\n\r\nBefore a dancer has achieved the distinction of becoming a “star,” it\r\nmay be safely reckoned that she has had from eight to ten years daily\r\ndrudgery, and that her earlier years have been without financial\r\nreward, and may even have involved her parents or relatives in\r\nconsiderable expense for her training or apprenticeship. Given the\r\nphysique, the instinct for dancing, and the intelligence, what then\r\nmust the prospective “star” expect before she can become a _première\r\ndanseuse_, or even a “seconde”?\r\n\r\nGo into any large school where “toe-dancing” is taught and what will\r\nyou see? A large, barely furnished room, on one or two, or perhaps on\r\nall sides of which is fixed a bar or pole, some four feet from the\r\nground. Here, having already been thoroughly grounded in the “five\r\npositions,” which every dancer learns, the pupils, perhaps a dozen or\r\nmore in number, ranging from eight upwards, will be found at “side\r\npractice,” as it is called, going through the various “positions”\r\nand steps, while one hand rests on the bar. Here she goes through\r\nthe fatiguing and endless training known as practice “on the bar,”\r\nlearning “_battements_,” which consist in moving one leg in the air,\r\nnow forward, now back, while the other, on tip-toe, supports the\r\nbody; learning the even more difficult _ronds de jambes_, or circles\r\nmade by one leg while resting on the other; learning all the while\r\nto get the legs free and supple, to keep the shoulders down and the\r\nelbows loose, before proceeding to the more complex steps and poses.\r\n\r\nAfter incessant drilling at the bar comes the “centre practice,” in\r\nwhich many of the same positions and steps are repeated with new and\r\nmore difficult ones, away from the bar; until little by little after\r\nmonths, indeed, it may be years, of incessant practice, the young\r\ndancer becomes qualified to take a place in the minor ranks of the\r\nballet where, in watching the more finished work of the _première\r\ndanseuse_, she is further inspired to yet more arduous practice\r\nin the school or at home, in the hope of achieving a perfection\r\nthat shall bring her similar rewards--a princely income, unlimited\r\nbouquets, and the clamorous applause of an adoring audience.\r\n\r\nAll this is severe enough training; but the dancer’s training always\r\nhas been severe. The hard thing, from the ballet composer’s point of\r\nview is--that the individuality and artistic spirit of the dancer is,\r\nonly too often, crushed by the training or at least subordinated to\r\nan exaltation of mere technique. Technique is a necessity, of course.\r\nBut it was in the power of such men as Noverre and Blasis to inspire\r\nin their disciples something more than an emulation for technical\r\nefficiency, and to give them an artistic ideal which made the\r\ndrudgery of their training seem worth while as a means of attaining\r\nto greater ease of artistic expression. Blasis’ influence undoubtedly\r\nran like a quickening spirit through the capitals of Europe and led\r\nthe way to that great revival of romantic ballet which marked the era\r\nof the ’forties and found its fullest and most poetic expression in\r\nthe idealism of Taglioni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nMARIE TAGLIONI (“SYLPHIDE”)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great theatrical sensation of the mid-’forties was the famous\r\n_Pas de Quatre_, composed of Lucile Grahn, Fanny Cerito, Carlotta\r\nGrisi, and Marie Taglioni, the last-named making a welcome return\r\nto the stage after an absence of some years. This was in 1845.\r\nTaglioni’s reappearance and a dispute between the dancers as to the\r\norder of their _entrée_ gave the event a handsome advertisement.\r\n\r\nIn the end the difficulty was settled by Lumley, the manager of the\r\nOpera, deciding that, as Mlle. Taglioni herself was indifferent as to\r\nwhen she made her entrance, they should appear according to age, the\r\nyoungest first; and in consequence Lucile Grahn led the quartette,\r\na crescendo of applause finishing in a terrific climax as Taglioni,\r\ngreatest of them all, appeared, and, as one witness declared, “the\r\nwhole house went clean mad.”\r\n\r\nMarie Taglioni, greatest of the four, was the first to give the\r\nimpulse towards the creation of that new school which the others\r\nrepresented. The technique of all four was virtually the same, that\r\nwhich had always been traditional. In the foundations of their art\r\nall were of the old school. All had been thoroughly drilled in the\r\neternal “five positions.” But in the spirit of this art all were as\r\nnew for their period, and by contrast with the eighteenth-century\r\nschool, as Camargo had been when she first quickened that school\r\nby the introduction of a fresher inspiration and new miracles of\r\nexecution; and as Sallé had been when she had striven to replace the\r\nconvention of pannier and cuirasse for classic hero and heroine, with\r\na costume nearer to Hellenic truth and beauty. And of the four who\r\nmade theatrical dancing in the ’forties of last century what it was,\r\nTaglioni was the pioneer.\r\n\r\nShe was one of a family of Taglionis. There was Louise, who had won\r\ndistinction at the Opera under the Empire, and who had a sister so\r\nbeautiful that when she left the stage to marry an Italian gentleman\r\nand settle down at Venice, it came to be a proverb, “To see Venice\r\nand the beautiful Contarini.” Marie was the niece of these two.\r\n\r\nBorn at Stockholm in 1804, she was the daughter of Philip Taglioni\r\n(1777-1871), a ballet-master from Milan, and a Swedish mother, _née_\r\nAnna Karsten, whose grandfather had been a famous actor and singer\r\nat the Swedish Court. In these two strains probably we have one of\r\nthe secrets of Marie Taglioni’s art, for, while from the Italian side\r\nshe would have inherited that passion for technique which is innate\r\nin the Latin races, from the maternal she would have received the\r\nimpulse towards a poetic and dreamy idealism which is characteristic\r\nof the North.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the fact that her father was not only a really\r\naccomplished teacher of dancing but was steeped in the romantic\r\nlegends and poetry of Scandinavia, and we are better able to\r\nunderstand how it was the stiff formalism and poetic conventionalities\r\nof Ballet in the pre-Taglioni period had to succumb to the new breath\r\nof inspiration which was to set all London and Paris raving of its\r\nbeauty in the ’forties, and fire even so temperate and cynical an\r\nobserver as Thackeray to enthusiastic expressions of admiration of\r\nMarie Taglioni in “Sylphide.”\r\n\r\nAs a child she was unprepossessing to look at and had physical\r\ndefects. It is said that when the famous dancing master, Coulon, was\r\nconsulted as to the teaching of the child, he exclaimed: “What _can_\r\nI do with that little hunch-back?”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, her father intended that she should become a dancer,\r\nand, taking her in hand himself, a dancer she became; with the result\r\nthat--to adapt the expression of an ingenious French critic--between\r\nthem they ultimately _taglionised_ the Ballet.\r\n\r\nMarie made her first appearance at Vienna in 1822, in a ballet\r\nbearing the lengthy title, “Réception d’une jeune nymphe à la cour de\r\nTerpsichore.” Her father had arranged a _pas_ for her _début_, but in\r\nher confusion, it is said, she forgot it, and substituted another of\r\nher own invention, which proved a triumphant success.\r\n\r\nFrom Vienna she went to Stuttgart, where the Queen of Würtemberg\r\nbecame so attached to her that she treated her like a sister, and was\r\nseen to shed tears on the occasion of Taglioni’s last appearance at\r\nthe Stuttgart Opera House. She next proceeded to Munich, where she\r\nwas equally well received by the royal family, finally making her\r\n_début_ at Paris on July 23rd, 1827, in a ballet called “Le Sicilien.”\r\n\r\nHer appearance was an immediate success, and was followed by fresh\r\ntriumphs in “La Vestale,” “Fernando Cortez,” “Les Bayadères” and\r\n“Le Carnaval de Venise,” this first engagement terminating on\r\nAugust 10th. One critic of her time writes enthusiastically of the\r\neffect she created with: “_sa grâce naïve, ses poses décentes et\r\nvoluptueuses, son extrême légèreté, la nouveauté de sa danse, dont\r\nles effets semblaient appartenir aux inspirations de la nature au\r\nlieu d’être les résultats des combinaisons de l’art et du travail\r\nde l’école, produisirent une sensation très vive sur le public.\r\nLe talent d’une virtuose qui s’éloigne de la route battue par ses\r\ndevanciers, trouve des opposants que la continuité des succès ne\r\ndésarme pas toujours: il n’y eut qu’une voix sur Mlle. Taglioni: tout\r\nle monde fut enchanté, ravi._”\r\n\r\nThe Ballet had grown formalised, stale. Taglioni came as spirit from\r\nanother sphere to infuse new vitality and idealism into its wearied\r\nsplendour, and she provided jaded opera lovers with a new thrill.\r\nAfter her Parisian _début_, she was re-engaged for the following year\r\nand returned in the April of 1828 to win further admiration in “Les\r\nBayadères,” and “Lydie” and “Psyché”; then, the year after, in “La\r\nBelle au Bois dormant,” a fifteen years’ engagement being finally\r\noffered to her at the Opera, with intervals of absence sufficient to\r\nenable her to pay visits to Germany, Russia, Italy and England, when,\r\nin every country, she achieved fresh triumphs.\r\n\r\nHer London _début_ at the benefit of Laporte, manager at Her\r\nMajesty’s Theatre, took place on June 3rd, 1830, in Didelot’s ballet\r\nof “Flore et Zephire.”\r\n\r\nA contemporary account of her dancing says: “Taglioni unquestionably\r\ncombines the finest requisites for eminence in her art. The union\r\nshe displays of muscular ability with the most feminine delicacy of\r\nframe and figure is truly extraordinary. A charming simplicity, the\r\nprincipal characteristic of her demeanour on the stage--an utter\r\nabsence of that false consequence and _bombast_ of carriage and\r\nmanner which have so peculiarly marked too many artistes of our time;\r\nand a native grace and matchless precision in her movements, even\r\nthose in which the most astonishing difficulties are conquered, and\r\nwhich yet appear to demand of _her_ no effort, leave us delighted\r\nwith the _fairyism_ of the lovely being before us ... and enchant\r\nus into forgetfulness of the unwearied perseverance and application\r\nby which, in aid of the lavish gifts of Nature, such unrivalled\r\nexcellence has been attained.”\r\n\r\nEvery contemporary account of Taglioni insists always on that one\r\nnote, the _idealism_ of her art. The late Mme. Katti-Lanner, who saw\r\nher dance, told me once that she appeared like some fairy being\r\nalways about to soar away from the earth to which she seemed so\r\nlittle to belong.\r\n\r\nWas it not Victor Hugo who inscribed a volume which he sent to her:\r\n“_à vos pieds--à vos ailes_”?\r\n\r\nIt was but natural then that she should be the ideal exponent of the\r\ntitle-_rôle_ in that graceful Ballet “Sylphide,” which was produced\r\nat Paris on March 14th, 1832.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the new influence brought to bear on the art\r\nof Ballet by the advent of Taglioni and the contrast between the\r\nolder and the newer schools was well defined by Théophile Gautier\r\nwho, writing of “Sylphide” said: “_Ce ballet commença pour la\r\nchorégraphie une ère toute nouvelle et ce fut par lui que le\r\nromantisme s’introduisit dans le domaine de Terpsichore. A dater\r\nde la ‘Sylphide,’ les ‘Filets de Vulcain,’ ‘Flore et Zephire’ ne\r\nfurent plus possibles: l’Opéra fut livré aux gnomes, aux ondins, aux\r\nsalamandres, aux elfes, aux nixes, aux willis, aux péris et à tout\r\nce peuple étrange et mystérieux qui se prête si merveilleusement aux\r\nfantaisies du maître de ballet. Les douze maisons de marbre et d’or\r\ndes Olympies furent reléguées dans la poussière des magasins, et l’on\r\nne commanda plus aux décorateurs que des forêts romantiques, que des\r\nvallées éclairées par le joli clair de lune allemand des ballades de\r\nHenri Heine...._”\r\n\r\nThe poet Méry remarked of the new dancer: “_Avec Mlle. Taglioni la\r\ndanse s’est élevée à la sainteté d’un art._” That is just what she\r\nachieved. Dancing, which had become a mechanical display of technical\r\n_tours de force_, was restored to the dignity--or sanctity--of an art.\r\n\r\nBut her influence extended further. She enlarged the perspective of\r\nthe stage effects. The stiff formalism of “classic” scenes, of neat\r\ntemples and trim vistas gave place to mysterious lakes and umbrageous\r\nforests, vast spaces that stirred the imagination and prepared the\r\nmind for the _entrée_ of visionary dancers.\r\n\r\nThe story of “Sylphide” is of the love of a sylph for a handsome\r\nyoung Highland peasant, who is haunted by visions of her in his\r\ndreams and memories of the vision on awaking, so much so that the\r\nheart of his own betrothed is broken and his brain is turned by the\r\nmanifestation of his aerial love, who herself becomes the victim\r\nof an unhappier fate by a terrible spell cast on her by infernal\r\npowers and woven during a witches’ sabbath, which forms one of the\r\nmore impressive scenes of the ballet. The plot was adapted from\r\nCharles Nodier’s story, _Trilby_, by Adolphe Nourrit, and the music\r\nby Schneitzhöffer was pronounced “excellent” by Castil-Blaze, who\r\nremarked that it was an “_Œuvre infiniment remarquable dans un genre\r\nqui peut devenir important lorsqu’un homme de talent et d’esprit\r\nveut bien l’adopter_.” He also reports of the first production of\r\n“Sylphide” in Paris, that it had a _succès merveilleux_.\r\n\r\nElsewhere Taglioni’s success was no less remarkable. Indeed,\r\nwheresoever she went she achieved a triumph. At Petrograd such\r\ntempting offers were made by the Emperor and Empress that she\r\nprolonged her stay for three years, and left laden with gifts from\r\ntheir Imperial Majesties. At Vienna, on one occasion, having been\r\ncalled before the curtain twenty-two times, when she finally got\r\naway from the Opera House her carriage was drawn to her hotel by\r\nforty young men of the leading Austrian families. In London she was\r\nworshipped by the public, and was one of the special admirations of\r\nthe youthful Queen Victoria, some of whose dolls (as in the case of\r\nBrocard, Pauline Leroux, and other dancers) were dressed to represent\r\nthe characters Taglioni played, and may be seen to-day in the London\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marie Taglioni\r\n\r\n(_From a lithograph dated 1833_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pas de Quatre of 1845\r\n\r\n(_Lucille Grahn, Fanny Cerito, Carlotta Grisi, and in the centre\r\nMarie Taglioni_).]\r\n\r\nTaglioni was married to Gilbert, Comte de Voisins, in 1835, but the\r\nmarriage was not a happy one and was dissolved in 1844. She retired\r\nfor a little time, but returned to the stage again and appeared in\r\nLondon, with triumphant success, in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe climax of a great season came in July of that year, when, at\r\nthe request of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, the _Pas de Quatre_, to\r\nwhich reference has already been made, was arranged for the four\r\ngreat dancers, Taglioni, Cerito, Carlotta Grisi and Lucile Grahn. One\r\ncritic remarked that the appearance of four such stars on the same\r\nboards and in the same _pas_ was “truly what our Gallic neighbours\r\ncall _une solennité théâtrale_, and such a one as none of those who\r\nbeheld it are likely to witness again.”\r\n\r\nIt was, he declared rightly, “an event unparalleled in theatrical\r\nannals, and one which, some two score years hence, may be handed down\r\nto a new generation by garrulous septuagenarians as one of the most\r\nbrilliant reminiscences of days gone by.”\r\n\r\nWithout being a septuagenarian, or being in a position to remember an\r\nevent about which to grow garrulous, all who have studied theatrical\r\nhistory at all can freely endorse the remark. Probably never in any\r\ntheatre was seen such excitement as there was on this occasion.\r\nContemporary testimony, when authoritative, is always valuable in\r\nsuch cases, and as there is no better account of the famous “Pas de\r\nQuatre” than that given by the _Illustrated London News_ of that day,\r\nJuly 19th, 1845, it may be quoted at length with advantage.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the curiosity which so unusual an event must necessarily\r\nexcite, and which led him to “hurry” to the theatre, the writer\r\ndeclared that:\r\n\r\n  “curiosity and every other feeling was merged in admiration\r\n  when the four great dancers commenced the series of picturesque\r\n  groupings with which this performance opens. We can safely say we\r\n  have never witnessed a scene more perfect in all its details. The\r\n  greatest of painters, in his loftiest flights, could hardly have\r\n  conceived, and certainly never executed, a group more faultless\r\n  and more replete with grace and poetry than that formed by these\r\n  four _danseuses_: Taglioni in the midst, her head thrown backwards,\r\n  apparently reclining in the arms of her sister nymphs. Could such\r\n  a combination have taken place in the ancient palmy days of art,\r\n  the pencil of the painter and the song of the poet would alike have\r\n  been employed to perpetuate its remembrance. No description can\r\n  render the exquisite, and almost ethereal grace of movement and\r\n  attitude of these great dancers, and those who have witnessed the\r\n  scene, may boast of having once, at least, seen the perfection of\r\n  the art of dancing so little understood. There was no affectation,\r\n  no apparent exertion or struggle for effect on the part of these\r\n  gifted artistes; and though they displayed their utmost resources,\r\n  there was a simplicity and ease, the absence of which would have\r\n  completely broken the spell they threw around the scene. Of the\r\n  details of this performance it is difficult to speak. In the\r\n  _solo_ steps executed by each _danseuse_, each in turn seemed to\r\n  claim pre-eminence. Where every one in her own style is perfect,\r\n  peculiar individual taste alone may balance in favour of one or the\r\n  other, but the award of public applause must be equally bestowed;\r\n  and, for our own part, we confess that our _penchant_ for the\r\n  peculiar style, and our admiration for the dignity, the repose, and\r\n  exquisite grace which characterise Taglioni, and the dancer who\r\n  has so brilliantly followed the same track (Lucile Grahn), did not\r\n  prevent our warmly appreciating the charming archness and twinkling\r\n  steps of Carlotta Grisi, or the wonderful flying leaps and\r\n  revolving bounds of Cerito. Though, as we have said, each displayed\r\n  her utmost powers, the emulation of the fair dancers was, if we may\r\n  trust appearances, unaccompanied by envy.\r\n\r\n  “Every time a shower of bouquets descended, on the conclusion of\r\n  a _solo pas_ of one or other of the fair _ballerines_, her sister\r\n  dancers came forward to assist her in collecting them; and both\r\n  on Saturday and Tuesday did Cerito offer to crown Taglioni with a\r\n  wreath which had been thrown in homage to the queen of the dance.\r\n  We were also glad to see on the part of the audience far less of\r\n  partisanship than had been displayed two or three years since, on\r\n  the performance of a _pas de deux_ between Elssler and Cerito. The\r\n  applause was universal, and equally distributed. This, however,\r\n  did not take from the excitement of the scene. The house, crowded\r\n  to the roof, presented a concourse of the most eager faces, never\r\n  diverted for a moment from the performance; and the extraordinary\r\n  tumult of enthusiastic applause, joined to the delightful effect of\r\n  the spectacle presented, imparted to the whole scene an interest\r\n  and excitement that can hardly be imagined.”\r\n\r\nYet another triumph for Ballet was scored in the following season,\r\nJuly, 1846, when Taglioni’s appearance in “La Gitana” having been\r\nhailed with quite extraordinary enthusiasm, there came a piece of\r\nmanagerial enterprise equalling that of the famous _Pas de Quatre_.\r\n\r\nA new ballet by Perrot, “Les Tribulations d’un Maître de Ballet,” was\r\narranged for production and during the performance a _pas_ was to\r\nhave been introduced, combining the matchless three--Grahn, Cerito\r\nand Taglioni, supported also by the niece of the last named, Louise\r\nTaglioni; and St. Leon, husband of Cerito; and Perrot, husband of\r\nCarlotta Grisi.\r\n\r\nThis _pas_ for the leading dancers was intended to form part of\r\na _divertissement_ entitled “Le Jugement de Pâris,” which the\r\naforesaid _maître de ballet_ was supposed to be arranging and to be\r\nhaving “tribulations” about. But on putting the _divertissement_\r\ninto rehearsal the idea was found to be so attractive and to assume\r\nsuch importance as to overshadow the rest of the production and the\r\n“Jugement de Pâris” was therefore detached and staged as a separate\r\nballet in itself with the happiest result.\r\n\r\nThe _pas_ so isolated was of course the famous _Pas des Déesses_, the\r\ngoddesses naturally being the fair rivals Juno, Minerva and Venus,\r\nimpersonated by the three great _ballerines_, who contended for the\r\napple thrown by the Goddess of Discord, and awarded by Paris to the\r\nmost beautiful of the three.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, with such dancers, the production found favour with\r\naudiences and critics, one of whom wrote:\r\n\r\n  “The idea of this _pas_ is an excellent one; for it is an important\r\n  qualification in choregraphic compositions, that the dancing should\r\n  appear to be a necessary result of the action--that an intelligible\r\n  idea should be conveyed by it, and a story kept up throughout.\r\n  Without this, dancing, however beautiful in itself, loses half\r\n  its charm to those who look for something more in it than mere\r\n  power and grace of motion. Here there is a purpose in the varied\r\n  attitudes and graceful evolutions of each _danseuse_, as she is\r\n  supposed to be endeavouring to outstrip her rivals, and vindicate\r\n  her right to the disputed apple; and the effect is a charming one,\r\n  independently of the interest and excitement that must inevitably\r\n  attach to the combined performance of such unequalled artists\r\n  as these. The _Graces_, enacted by Louise Taglioni, Demississe,\r\n  and Cassan; _Cupid_, by that graceful child, Mdlle. Lamoureux;\r\n  _Mercure_, by Perrot, etc., etc., are all numbered amongst the\r\n  _dramatis personæ_ of the _ballet_, and a more charming combination\r\n  could hardly be met with.\r\n\r\n  “Taglioni is, however, the principal ‘star’ at the present moment.\r\n  Those who have visited Her Majesty’s Theatre predetermined to find\r\n  her marvellous talent diminished, and to ‘regret’ her reappearance\r\n  on the English stage, have come away enchanted, despite themselves,\r\n  at that marvellous union of unrivalled agility, with the most\r\n  perfect grace and elegance, in which no dancer has as yet equalled\r\n  her. If there is any change perceptible, she seems to have advanced\r\n  in her art--in person, an increase of _embonpoint_ has proved\r\n  decidedly favourable to her appearance. It is, no doubt, in the\r\n  _danse noble_ that she excels; but in every style of dancing the\r\n  _je ne sais quoi_ of peculiar refinement and grace, for which she\r\n  is remarkable in her style, distinguishes her. As long as Taglioni\r\n  continues to dance, she will continue to excite an enthusiasm of\r\n  applause, as the famous Guimard, styled in 1770, ‘La Reine de la\r\n  Danse,’ had done before her. A peculiar gentleness and amiability\r\n  of look, and a dignity of manner which never abandons Taglioni, is\r\n  in admirable keeping with the style of her dancing; and, if we may\r\n  believe report, these do not belie her real character.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the appearances and “report” did _not_ belie her\r\ncharacter, for Taglioni always won the respect and love of all she\r\nmet. She had done so abroad, where crowned heads and royal families\r\nhad made a friend of her, enchanted with her sweetness and modesty,\r\nand won to equal respect by her innate dignity of character.\r\n\r\nIt was the same in London, where, it is said, she received not\r\nonly the generous homage of her stage colleagues and was offered a\r\nsuperb testimonial at the close of the season of 1846, but also met\r\nwith special favour from Queen Victoria herself, who was as much a\r\nconnoisseur of good dancing as she was of virtuous conduct.\r\n\r\nIt may have been by reason of this that Taglioni was appointed\r\nteacher of dancing and deportment to some of the younger members\r\nof the English Royal Family; and later undertook the tuition of a\r\nfew favoured young dancers. Yet Fortune did not favour her always,\r\nand she died at Marseilles on April 25th, 1884; like Guimard, also\r\nneglected and in poverty. But while there is one to read the records\r\nof the stage her name will survive as one of the founders and supreme\r\nexponents of the idealistic school of Ballet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TAGLIONI (“SYLPHIDE”)\r\n\r\n       “Slim, virginal, upon the stage she springs:\r\n        And joy forthwith relumines weary eyes\r\n        That, looking ever on dull mundane things,\r\n        Long had forgot youth’s heritage of joy:\r\n        Slim, virginal, clad in resplendent white\r\n        With floral coronal and fluttering wings\r\n        She stands serenely poised; then, swift to rise,\r\n        Gleams like a sunlit dove in sudden flight:\r\n        So, once again, return to our dulled sight\r\n        Dreams of a golden age without alloy.\r\n\r\n        “How many sages sought in ancient time\r\n        Some magic stone transmuting all to gold;\r\n        Elixirs rare have many yearned to find,\r\n        Recalling refluent youth ere life depart;\r\n        How many strove to conjure from the air,\r\n        From water, earth or fire with subtle art\r\n        The elemental beings therein divined!\r\n\r\n        “But thou, with art more potent and sublime,\r\n        Transmutest all! None seeing thee is old!\r\n        All hearts forlorn, from dross of woe are freed!\r\n        And in the magic glamour of thy grace,\r\n        Hope’s listless wings win strength once more to fare\r\n        Towards that Ideal whose lineaments we trace\r\n        Importally incarnate in--‘Sylphide!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nCARLOTTA GRISI (GISELLE)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeldom is a good dancer also a born singer; and still more rarely do\r\nboth talents develop simultaneously to such a point that there can be\r\nany serious doubt as to which to relinquish in favour of the other.\r\nYet such was the happy fate of Carlotta Grisi, the cousin of the two\r\nfamous singing sisters, Giuditta and Giulia Grisi.\r\n\r\nCarlotta at one time showed such promise of becoming a vocalist\r\nthat no less a person than the great Malibran advised her to devote\r\nher life to singing. But when Perrot, the famous ballet-master, who\r\nhad received his _congé_ from the Paris Opera, saw her, when she\r\nwas earning her living as a dancer at Naples, he was clever enough\r\nto suggest that she should develop _both_ talents, fully intending\r\nthat under his encouragement and tuition she should become at least\r\na finished _danseuse_, for he saw in the future of such a pupil\r\nan opportunity of securing his own return to the Opera. Moreover,\r\nalthough--as a famous _maîtresse de ballet_ of our time once\r\ndescribed him to me--“ogly as sin,” he managed to become her husband!\r\n\r\nCarlotta Grisi was born in 1821 at Visnida, in Upper Istria, in\r\na palace built for the Emperor Francis II. When a mere child of\r\nfive years old she was dancing, with other children, at the Scala,\r\nMilan, where she danced with such grace that she was nicknamed _La\r\npetite Heberlé_, a Mlle. Heberlé then being a very popular star.\r\nSubsequently she toured with a company through Italy appearing at\r\nFlorence, Rome, Naples, and it was here she met and became the pupil\r\nand then wife of Perrot.\r\n\r\nBrief visits to London, Vienna, Milan, Naples followed, the young\r\ndancer gathering fresh triumphs at each, until finally she made her\r\nParisian _début_ at the Renaissance on February 28th, 1840. Here\r\nshe appeared both as singer and dancer in “Le Zingaro,” but on the\r\nclosing of the theatre she went in February, 1841, to the Opera, and\r\nachieved an instant success in “La Favorita.” From that moment her\r\ncareer was one of continued triumph.\r\n\r\nIn June of that year she appeared in “_Giselle, ou les Willis, ballet\r\nen deux actes, de MM. de Saint Georges, Th. Gautier et Coralli,\r\nmusique de M. Adam, décors de M. Ciceri_,” as it is described on my\r\ncopy of the original libretto. Carlotta’s appearance in it was _the_\r\nartistic sensation of the Continent.\r\n\r\n“Giselle” is founded on one of those romantic legendary themes in\r\nwhich Germany was once so rich, and tells of the fate of a village\r\ngirl who falls a victim to the mysterious _Willis_, or spirits of\r\nbetrothed girls who in life were passionately fond of dancing, who\r\nhave died ere marriage, and are doomed after death to dance every\r\nnight from midnight to dawn, luring whom they may to the same fate.\r\nThis, and the story of shattered hope and love forlorn, which bring\r\nabout poor little Giselle’s destruction, are the two leading themes\r\nof a ballet which, touching both the heights of gaiety and depths\r\nof tragedy, is rich in every element that can interest or charm,\r\nand presents many dramatic situations that demand from a supremely\r\naccomplished dancer a power of mimic expression, intensity and poetic\r\nsympathy that are rare. Carlotta Grisi was ideally equipped, and she\r\nwas _par excellence_--Giselle. A revival of the second act, under the\r\ntitle of “les Sylphides,” was given by the Russian dancers at the\r\nColiseum a few seasons ago.\r\n\r\nGautier’s admiration for Grisi was enthusiastic. “_Qu’est-ce que\r\nGiselle?_” he asked the day after the first performance, thus\r\nanswering his own question: “_Giselle, c’est Carlotta Grisi, une\r\ncharmante fille aux yeux bleus, au sourire fin et naïf, à la démarche\r\nalerte, une Italienne qui a l’air d’une Allemande à s’y tromper,\r\ncomme l’Allemande Fanny avait l’air d’une Andalouse de Séville....\r\nPour la pantomime, elle a dépassé toutes les espérances. Pas un geste\r\nde convention. Pas un mouvement faux. C’est la nature prise sur le\r\nfait._”\r\n\r\nAnother of her admirers described Carlotta in the following quaint\r\nterms: “... a blonde beauty; her eyes are of a soft and lovely\r\nblue, her mouth is small, and her complexion is of a rare freshness\r\nand delicacy.... Her figure is symmetrical, for, though slight,\r\nshe has not that anatomical thinness, which is so common among the\r\n_danseuses_ of the Académie Royale. Her grace is not more surprising\r\nthan her aplomb. She never appears to exert herself, but can execute\r\nthe most incredible _tours de force_ with a perfect tranquillity.”\r\n\r\nGrisi’s success in London was stupendous. She appeared here at Drury\r\nLane, and later at Her Majesty’s, for the Opera seasons. On her\r\nfarewell appearance in “The Peri” (by Théophile Gautier, Coralli\r\nand Burgmüller) at the end of the season in November, 1843, the\r\n_Illustrated London News_ gave the following note:\r\n\r\n  “Carlotta Grisi took her farewell of an English audience on\r\n  Saturday night (i.e. November 18th, 1843) in the popular ballet of\r\n  ‘The Peri,’ when a brilliant company was present to bid adieu to\r\n  their favourite dancer. On the entrance of Mdlle. Grisi, there was\r\n  one unanimous burst of applause, and each movement of her graceful\r\n  figure was the signal for renewed approbation. When the famous\r\n  leap was given, cries of _encore_ re-echoed from every part of the\r\n  house, and once again the favourite, with a spirit undaunted,\r\n  leaped into the arms of the lover in the ballet. The applause\r\n  continued undiminished until the fall of the curtain--then the\r\n  enthusiasm became a _furore_, and the name of ‘Grisi’ was uttered\r\n  by a thousand voices. She soon appeared, led on by Petipa, and in\r\n  looks more expressive than words, spoke her thanks for the kindness\r\n  which she has received and merited. Wreaths and bouquets were\r\n  plenteously showered on the dancer, and our artist has attempted a\r\n  representation of the enthusiastic scene.\r\n\r\n  “After the performances, Mr. Bunn gave an elegant supper in the\r\n  grand saloon of the theatre to about seventy of his friends\r\n  and patrons. The entertainment was intended as a complimentary\r\n  leave-taking to Carlotta Grisi, on her quitting London to fulfil\r\n  her engagements in Paris. After proposing the health of Carlotta\r\n  Grisi, Mr. Bunn presented that lady with a superb bracelet of black\r\n  enamel, richly ornamented with diamonds, as a slight _souvenir_ of\r\n  her highly successful career at Drury Lane Theatre. Attached to the\r\n  bracelet was the following inscription: ‘_Présenté à Mlle. Carlotta\r\n  Grisi, la danseuse la plus poétique de l’univers, avec les hommages\r\n  respectueux de son directeur A. Bunn, Théâtre Royal, Drury Lane,\r\n  18th November, 1843._’”\r\n\r\nA contemporary enthusiast, writing of her in 1846, said: “Her\r\nname is henceforth inseparably connected with the charming and\r\npoetic creations which her own grace and beauty have immortalised:\r\n‘Giselle,’ ‘Beatrix,’ ‘La Péri,’ have attained a celebrity equal\r\nto that of ‘La Sylphide’ and ‘La Fille du Danube,’ and the most\r\ndevoted admirer of Taglioni can scarcely refuse a tribute of homage\r\nto the bewitching elegance of Carlotta Grisi. Wherever she goes,\r\nher reception is the same; if she is idolised in Paris, she is\r\nadored in London. The impression produced by her performance of ‘La\r\nPéri,’ at Drury Lane, in 1843, will not be easily forgotten, and her\r\nmore recent triumph in the ‘Pas de Quatre’ is still fresh in the\r\nrecollection of the _habitués_ of the Opera. Nor must we omit her\r\nlast creations of Mazourka in the ‘Diable à Quatre’ and ‘Paquita.’ It\r\nis impossible to describe the fascinating _naïveté_ of her manner,\r\nthe arch and lively humour of her pantomime, and the extraordinary\r\nprecision and grace of her dancing!” High praise, certainly! But,\r\nevidently not exaggerated, for all contemporary accounts of Grisi are\r\nequally enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nCarlotta’s married life was not entirely happy. She had many\r\nadmirers, and her husband had a temper, and though she always kept\r\nthe former at a discreet distance, the latter was not so easily\r\nmanaged, and after a few years of marriage, which had apparently\r\nbeen entered upon more as a matter of mutual interest than mutual\r\naffection, she and her husband agreed to separate. Grisi left the\r\nstage in 1857 at the climax of her success, and retired to live\r\nquietly in Switzerland, where she died only a few years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nFANNY CERITO (“ONDINE”)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the great quartette, Cerito was the especial pet of London\r\naudiences, among whom she was always known as the “divine” Fanny.\r\n\r\nThis but echoed the pretty worship of her good old father to whom\r\nshe was always “La Divinita,” and who in the heyday of her success\r\nused to go about with his pockets stuffed with her old shoes, and\r\nfragments of the floral crowns which had been thrown to her on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of her birth at Naples, in 1821, he had guarded her,\r\nand his pride in her talent and her triumphs was but natural, seeing\r\nhow young she was, how early she won fame, and how great was her\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\nShe made her _début_ at the San Carlo, Naples, in 1835, in a ballet\r\ncalled “The Horoscope.” She then toured, appearing at most of the\r\nItalian cities. Even before she had left Italy she had earned, on her\r\n_début_ at Milan, the complimentary title of “the fourth Grace,” one\r\nof the many “fourth” Graces the world has seen since ancient classic\r\ndays!\r\n\r\nAfter Italy there followed a couple of years at Vienna and then,\r\nstrangely enough, reversing the customary order of things, her London\r\n_début_ was made some years before she appeared in Paris. She was\r\nseen regularly in London for some seasons from 1840 onwards.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1841, she appeared at Her Majesty’s, in the “Lac des Fées,”\r\nwith great success; in June “Sylphide” was revived for her, and on\r\nAugust 12th she took her benefit, to which people flocked from all\r\nparts of London and, notwithstanding the usual deserted state of\r\ntown at such a time, the audience was one of the biggest and most\r\nfashionable on record. Then she went on a brief visit to Liverpool,\r\nand then returned for a time to Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt was in the two ballets, “Alma” and “Ondine,” that the beauteous\r\nFanny achieved her greatest triumphs, in the former representing\r\na fire-spirit, in the latter, a water-nymph given, as was Hans\r\nAndersen’s little Mermaid, mortal life and form.\r\n\r\nShe appeared in “Alma,” a ballet by Deshayes, on its first production\r\nin London during July, 1842, on the night when the famous “Persiani”\r\nrow took place, and which was said to be worse than several similar\r\nriots in the previous year at the Opera. Mme. Persiani had been “too\r\nill to sing,” and the audience had been incredulous. Comparative\r\nquiet was at length secured by the respected manager, Lumley,\r\nand, as a journal of the time quaintly records: “A beautiful,\r\nsylph-like Cerito, danced in the splendid ballet of ‘Alma,’ and by\r\nher inspiration hushed the stormy elements with a repose that ought\r\nalways to reign when genius and talent are supreme.”\r\n\r\nAnother chronicler speaks of the “new and glittering ballet of\r\n‘Alma,’ which reflects the greatest credit on the inventor, M.\r\nDeshayes,” and adds: “We have no hesitation in saying that this is\r\nthe ballet of all ballets, and carries our memory back to our young,\r\ninnocent and merry days of juvenility, when care was not care,\r\nand tears not tears of woe, to the days of bright sunny smiles,\r\nwhen fairies in our eyes _were_ fairies, and when the brilliant\r\nrealisations of the doings of ‘Cherry and Fair Star’ were real,\r\nexisting things of creation, and part and parcelling of our then\r\ndreamy nature and being. Such is the new ballet of ‘Alma.’ It is one\r\nof the best ever put on the opera boards.” That this impression was\r\ncreated was due certainly to the talent, both as actress and dancer,\r\nof Cerito, for whom the ballet had been specially composed.\r\n\r\nApropos of her great popularity in London a contemporary record\r\nmentions an interesting “fact which will bear testimony at once to\r\nher perfect embodiment of the poetry of motion and her excellent\r\nprivate character,” namely, that “The Queen Dowager of England was\r\nlately graciously pleased to bestow on her a splendid enamel brooch,\r\nset with diamonds, and accompanied by a most flattering message.”\r\n\r\n“Alma” was succeeded in the following year by “Ondine,” also composed\r\nspecially for her, by Perrot, with admirable music by Pugni, and\r\nproduced at Her Majesty’s on June 22nd, 1843. The plot is somewhat\r\nlike that of Hans Andersen’s story, “The Little Mermaid,” and the\r\nproduction gave Cerito fine opportunities for expressive miming\r\nas well as dancing, one of the great moments of the ballet being\r\nthe scene in which the little Naiad realises at last the mortal\r\nlife which has been given her, when, for the first time she sees\r\nher shadow cast by the moonlight; and then came one of the chief\r\nsensations of the ballet--Cerito’s dancing of the famous _pas de\r\nl’ombre_, a thing of such beauty that the audience wished it a joy\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nCerito made her Parisian _début_ with success in 1847, in a ballet\r\ncalled “La Fille de Marbre,” composed by St. Leon.\r\n\r\nA French critic, speaking of her personal attractions, described her\r\nas “_petite et dodue ... les bras ronds et d’un contour moelleux, les\r\nyeux bleus, le sourire facile, la jambe forte, le pied petit, mais\r\népais, la chevelure blonde, mais rebelle_.” A charming little picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fanny Cerito and St. Leon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucille Grahn and Perrot]\r\n\r\nAnother critic wrote: “Short in stature and round in frame, Cerito\r\nis one example of how grace will overcome the lack of personal\r\nelegance, how mental animation will convey vivacity and attraction to\r\nfeatures which, in repose, are heavy and inexpressive. With a figure\r\nwhich would be too redundant, were it not for its extreme flexibility\r\nand abandon, Cerito is yet a charming _artiste_, who has honourably\r\nearned a high popularity and deservedly retained it.”\r\n\r\nSome idea of her style as a dancer, as well as of her personal\r\nappearance, is afforded by another contemporary who described her as\r\n“bondante and abondante.”\r\n\r\nAmong her other successes were “La Vivandière” and “Le Diable au\r\nViolon.” For the last-named the violin was played by St. Leon, the\r\nviolinist and ballet-master, whom she married. She separated from\r\nhim in 1850. In April, 1854, she won a striking success in a ballet,\r\n“Gemma,” which she had composed in collaboration with Théophile\r\nGautier--a great admirer of her--and she retired later in the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nLUCILE GRAHN (“EOLINE”)\r\n\r\n\r\nLucile Grahn was born at Copenhagen, June 30th, 1821, and is said to\r\nhave been so delighted with a ballet to which she was taken when only\r\nfour years old, that she forthwith insisted on learning to dance, and\r\nmade her regular theatrical _début_ as Cupid when she was seven!\r\n\r\nFor a time she left the stage in order to pursue her studies as a\r\ndancer. After seven years of the usual and always taxing training she\r\nreappeared, at the age of fourteen, first in “La Muette de Portici,”\r\nfollowing with success in a ballet of her own composition, “Le Cinq\r\nSeul,” then creating the _rôle_ of the Princess Astride, in a ballet\r\nentitled “Waldemar,” and followed with the title-_rôle_ in “Hertha,”\r\nboth Scandinavian in subject.\r\n\r\nThen she proceeded to Paris, and after studying a while under Barrez,\r\nwas recalled suddenly to Copenhagen to take part in a fête arranged\r\nin honour of the Queen of Denmark, and so did not make her Parisian\r\n_début_ until she appeared at the Opera in “Le Carnaval de Venise,”\r\nin 1838, in which she achieved an immediate success, only excelled\r\nin the following year when she captured all Parisians’ hearts in the\r\nballet which Taglioni had already made famous--“Sylphide.”\r\n\r\nUnhappily, in the spring of 1840, her career was interrupted by an\r\naccident while rehearsing a _variation_ which she was to perform at\r\nthe benefit of Madame Falcon, the singer; and in consequence of\r\ninflammation of the knee she was laid up for some time in spite of\r\nthe most careful attention. She never appeared at the Paris Opera\r\nagain; but in the next few years her recovery was sufficient to allow\r\nof her achieving many successes in London, as well as taking part in\r\nthe famous Quartette.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 she appeared in “Lady Henriette” at Drury Lane, and in the\r\nfollowing Spring was engaged for the entire season of the Italian\r\nOpera at Her Majesty’s, where she won the most dazzling of her\r\nsuccesses in a ballet entitled “Eoline,” produced in April, 1845.\r\n\r\nA contemporary critic records the production in the following\r\namusingly naïve terms: “The ballet ‘Eoline,’ with its poetic story,\r\nand its lovely feminine features (_sic_), was the great hit of the\r\nfirst night, spite the difficulties of complicated scenery and\r\nmechanical effects. The ballet worked wonders, and Lucile Grahn\r\nexhibits nightly the most delightful grace and modesty of deportment,\r\nin addition to certainty and aplomb of position, reminding one of\r\nCanova’s masterpieces of sculpture.”\r\n\r\nGrahn made a great success as Catarina in “La Fille du Bandit,”\r\nduring May, 1848. According to one critic it “exhibited her talents\r\nin a higher degree than anything she has previously appeared in. As\r\nthe bandit’s daughter she assumes a dignified bearing, like that of\r\none born to command, and supports it throughout whether in dancing or\r\naction ... and the grace of her solos commands numerous encores.”\r\n\r\nYet greater success followed in “Le Jugement de Pâris,” the honours\r\ntherein, however, being shared with Cerito and Taglioni. This\r\nappearance was in connection with one of the most striking sensations\r\nof the theatrical season of 1848 (certainly the most remarkable in\r\nthe history of ballet, save for the famous _Pas de Quatre_ of three\r\nyears before), namely, the _Pas des Déesses_, which was performed in\r\nthe presence of Her Majesty Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nEven the Russians of our day never evoked greater excitement or\r\nenthusiasm than that which greeted the appearance of these three\r\ngreat dancers of the ’forties in one ballet. A contemporary critic,\r\ncontrasting the production with that of the former _Pas de Quatre_\r\nremarked that “for poetry of idea and execution the _Pas des Déesses_\r\nhas decidedly the advantage,” and goes on to say: “Besides this,\r\nthough the attention is principally directed to the three great\r\n_danseuses_, yet the grouping is rendered far more effective by the\r\naddition of other actors.\r\n\r\n“The _Pas des Déesses_ has another recommendation; it is longer, and\r\nthe intervals while the three ‘stars’ are resting themselves, are\r\nfilled up by the charming butterfly steps of Louise Taglioni, and the\r\nmost incredible feats on the part of St. Leon and Perrot. In fact,\r\nall here surpass themselves--of Taglioni, Grahn, Cerito, each in turn\r\nseems to obtain the advantage--though, of course, the palm is finally\r\nadjudged by each spectator accordingly as his taste is originally\r\ninclined. For ourselves, as critics, obliged to put away all previous\r\npredilections, we are compelled to confess that each in her peculiar\r\nstyle, in this _pas_, reaches the _ne plus ultra_ of her art, and\r\neach is different.\r\n\r\n“Though the styles of Taglioni and Lucille Grahn at first sight\r\nwould seem to be identical, yet they have both their own peculiar\r\ncharacteristics. The buoyant energy of Grahn contrasts with that\r\npeculiar quietness that marks Taglioni’s most daring feats, while\r\nCerito, who by her very smallness of stature, seems fitted by nature\r\nfor another style of dancing, bounds to and fro, as though in the\r\nplenitude of enjoyment. We have never seen either of these great\r\n_danseuses_ achieve such wonders as in this _pas_. The improvement\r\nof Lucile Grahn is, above all, marvellous; she introduces a step\r\nentirely new and exquisitely graceful; and, though it must be of most\r\ndifficult achievement, she executes it with an ease and lightness\r\nwhich gives her the appearance of flying. It is a species of _valse\r\nrenversée_ on a grand scale. One of the most effective moments with\r\nCerito is that in which she comes on with St. Leon, executing a\r\n_jetés battus_ in the air, and, at the same moment, turning her head\r\nsuddenly to catch a sight of the much-desired apple. This never fails\r\nto elicit thunders of applause, and an encore.\r\n\r\n“As for Taglioni, after taking the most daring leaps in her own easy\r\nand exquisitely graceful manner, she flits across the stage with a\r\nsuccession of steps, which, though perfectly simple, are executed\r\nwith such inconceivable lightness and such enchanting grace, as\r\ninvariably to call forth one of the most enthusiastic encores we\r\never remember to have witnessed; in fact, from beginning to end\r\nof the _divertissement_, all the spectators are kept in a state\r\nof excitement, which finds vent in clappings, in shoutings, and\r\n_bravas_, occasionally quite deafening.”\r\n\r\nThe reference to the styles of Taglioni and Lucile Grahn as being\r\nalmost “identical” is made additionally interesting by the discerning\r\nmanner in which the critic contrasts the “buoyant energy of Grahn”\r\nwith that “peculiar quietness” that marked Taglioni’s most daring\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nBoth had studied in the traditional school and to that extent were\r\nbound to be somewhat similar. Their differences were due to physique\r\nand temperament, Grahn, the fair Dane, was somewhat heavier in build,\r\nhad always been stronger and was also younger than Taglioni, who,\r\nweakly in childhood, had always been of more _raffinée_ build and\r\ntemperament, and was now perhaps a shade less energetic than in the\r\ndays when she had delighted London with her earliest appearances some\r\nfifteen years before. Still, that “peculiar quietness” had always\r\ndistinguished her and was that very quality which had made her so\r\nideal an exponent of “Sylphide.”\r\n\r\nLucile Grahn, who was tall, slim, with blue eyes and blonde hair, was\r\nsaid, as regards her dancing, to possess “less strength than Elssler,\r\nless flexibility than Taglioni, but more of both than anyone else.”\r\n\r\nShe appeared in London each season until 1848, when the arrival of\r\nJenny Lind created such a craze for Opera--and for Jenny Lind--that\r\nBallet temporarily lost its attraction for London audiences. She\r\ncomes close to our own times, for she died at Munich in the spring of\r\n1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE AND REVIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing what may be called “the Taglioni era” came a period of\r\ncomparative dullness. There _were_ successors who charmed their\r\naudiences in London, in Paris, in Rome, Vienna and America. There was\r\nthe brilliant Caroline Rosati; the stately Amalia Ferraris; dashing\r\nRita Sangalli--who married a Baron; dainty Rosita Mauri; Petipa,\r\nFabbri, and others whose name and fame were brilliant but transient.\r\nBut these, you will say, were all foreigners. Had we no English\r\nballet dancers? Well, it may safely be said that Ballet in England\r\nwas never more thoroughly English, or more thoroughly banal, than for\r\nsome twenty years before and after the Taglioni period.\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 onwards it was the period of the Great Utilities, of which\r\nBallet was not one! Save for a few good examples later at the old\r\nCanterbury Music Hall, with Miss Phyllis Broughton as _première\r\ndanseuse_, at Weston’s Music Hall, Holborn, and at the Alhambra under\r\nStrange’s management, and some good productions at the Crystal Palace\r\narranged by M. Leon Espinosa, it was practically a close time for\r\nartistic dance and ballet for something like a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe state of public disfavour into which the art had fallen is\r\nwell seen from the interesting extract from the _Era Almanack_ of\r\n1872, in which one reads: “Judging from Mr. Mapleson’s extensive\r\nproductions the ballet was another sheet anchor on which he relied.\r\nMadame Katti Lanner, a Viennese _danseuse_ of great repute, was, with\r\nother foreign artists, engaged for the _express purpose of reviving\r\nan interest in the old-fashioned, elaborate ballet of action_. The\r\nexperiment was boldly made, but failed; and it is clear that all\r\nmodern audiences care for is an incidental _divertissement_ which\r\nmay mean something or nothing. As for a story worked out by clever\r\npantomime, people refuse to stay and see it, and the deserted\r\nappearance of the theatre while ‘Giselle’ and other ballets were\r\nin progress was a significant hint that incidental dances only are\r\nappreciated by opera-goers of the present day. The ballets invented\r\nby Madame Katti Lanner were ‘La Rose de Séville,’ ‘Hvika’ and one or\r\ntwo nameless _divertissements_. She danced in them all, and in the\r\nfirst act of ‘Giselle.’”\r\n\r\nThus, London audiences from, roughly, 1850 to 1870, had not that\r\nburning interest in the art of ballet which they had displayed for\r\nthe twenty years or so preceding 1850; indeed, they had little or\r\nno interest in it. In Paris conditions were much the same. There\r\nwere dancers of some ability and transient popularity, as we have\r\nnoted, but no ballet and no dancer appeared of outstanding merit\r\nsuch as those of the great periods of the eighteenth century, the\r\nmid-nineteenth, or such as we have seen to-day. Even dancing, apart\r\nfrom ballet, was of comparatively little interest.\r\n\r\nIn London, with the ’eighties came the dear old Gaiety and another\r\n_pas de quatre_, that in “Faust Up-to-Date,” a very different one\r\nfrom that of the ’forties, not the toe-dancing of classic ballet, but\r\nstep-dancing of the characteristic and admirable English school; and\r\nit was a very bright and inspiring dance done with tremendous _verve_\r\nby the Misses Florence Levey, Lillian Price, Maud Wilmot, and Eva\r\nGreville.\r\n\r\nSupreme, however, as an exponent of the English school of dancing\r\nwas, unquestionably, Kate Vaughan, who, with Sylvia Grey, Alice\r\nLethbridge, Letty Lind, and others of that period, and for well into\r\nthe ’nineties, were the delight of London.\r\n\r\nKate Vaughan herself was one of the most distinguished dancers\r\nEngland has ever had--distinguished for incomparable grace, finish,\r\nand characteristically English refinement of manner. There were\r\nno ragged edges to her work. Her art was--as all good art must\r\nbe--deliberate; her every pose and movement beautiful, and always\r\ninstinct with the quintessence of a special and personal charm that\r\nnever failed her to the end. I saw her dance, shortly before her\r\ndeath, at a concert given on behalf of one of the various charities\r\nwhich arose out of the Boer War; and all the art and all the charm\r\nwhich had made Kate Vaughan a stage influence in her time were as\r\namply evident as when she had first delighted us some twenty years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWith the ’eighties came the rise of the Ballet as a regular London\r\ninstitution, on the founding of those two veteran Vaudeville houses,\r\nthe Empire and the Alhambra, where for about a quarter of a century,\r\npractically without interruption, Ballet was the chief item on their\r\nalways varied and attractive programmes. Of course, there was in\r\n1884 the famous production of Manzotti’s great ballet “Excelsior” at\r\nHer Majesty’s Theatre; but it was not really until the opening of\r\nthe two aforenamed houses that we had a real revival of Ballet in\r\nLondon apart from the Opera, and without that State-aid which the art\r\nreceives on the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE ALHAMBRA: 1854-1903\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the Alhambra and the Empire were alike in having had a somewhat\r\nvaried career before they became the rival “homes of English ballet.”\r\n\r\nThere was something like a craze for music-halls in the early\r\n’sixties of last century, and it was probably partly due to this that\r\nthe Alhambra, which had been opened in 1854 as a Panopticon of the\r\nArts and Sciences (with a Royal Charter granted by Queen Victoria in\r\n1850) failing of its more ambitious purpose, ceased (unsuccessfully)\r\nto instruct, and sought (with better success) only to amuse.\r\n\r\nFirst it was given over to more or less unorthodox religious services\r\non the Sundays and to boxing contests and wrestling on the week days!\r\nThen for a time it came under the direction of a then well-known\r\ntheatrical manager and speculator, the late Mr. E. T. Smith, who\r\ncalled it the Alhambra, and in 1870 secured a regular music-hall\r\nlicence. The place was still not very successful. It became a circus\r\nfor a short time.\r\n\r\nThen it was taken over by a Mr. William Wilde, of Nottingham, who\r\nintroduced Leotard, the famous gymnast, about whose wonderful grace\r\nand daring London went mad, so much so that on his return visit in\r\n1866, under the late John Hollingshead’s management, he received a\r\nsalary of £180 a week.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Frederick Strange, who had been connected with the Crystal\r\nPalace, became manager and introduced ballet, his most notable\r\nproduction being one called “L’Enfant Prodigue,” which was adapted\r\nfrom Auber’s opera. Mr. Jules Riviere was the conductor of the\r\norchestra; and among those who became responsible for the arranging\r\nof the ballets were the brothers Imré and Bolossy Kiralfy, assisted\r\nby their sister Aniola, one of their most successful productions\r\nbeing one entitled “Hungary.”\r\n\r\nAt this period the old quarrel between the young “music-halls”\r\nand the “legitimate” theatres was growing serious. A ballet might\r\nbe produced so long as it was called and was, in effect, a mere\r\n_divertissement_. Anything else, a musical sketch, or opera--in which\r\nwords were said or sung--was held an infringement of the rights of a\r\nregular theatre, and when John Hollingshead, as stage director during\r\n1865-1867, produced in 1866 a pantomime called “Where’s the Police?”\r\nthe management were fined by a magistrate some two hundred and forty\r\npounds. Apart from ballet and such a production as this pantomime,\r\nthere was, of course, plenty of the “variety” element, contributed by\r\nsuch performers as Leotard, the Farinis, and the Foucarts, gymnasts;\r\nand various vocalists known to their period.\r\n\r\nWith the dawn of the ’seventies came a new taste for ballet and “Les\r\nNations” was staged at the Alhambra with a Mlle. Colonna and other\r\ndancers, including Esther Austin (a sister of Emily Soldene) in the\r\ncast; and a “Parisian Quadrille” became a feature of the production.\r\n\r\nThen came a season of “Promenade” Concerts, and during the\r\nFranco-Prussian war the conductor, Mr. Jules Riviere, gave the “War\r\nSongs of Europe,” those of the French and Prussian nations evoking\r\nsuch passion that free fights occurred, and the theatre lost its\r\nmusic-hall licence; and the Directors of the Alhambra Company\r\npromptly secured a regular theatre licence from the Lord Chamberlain!\r\n\r\nSo on April 24th, 1871, the place was opened as the Alhambra\r\nTheatre, with an evening’s entertainment including a farce, “Oh,\r\nMy Head!”; a comic opera, “The Crimson Scarf”; and two ballets,\r\n“The Beauties of the Harem” and “Puella.” Then followed another\r\nballet “The Sylph of the Glen”; and then “A Romantic Tale,” by J. B.\r\nJohnston, and an extravaganza, “All About the Battle of Dorking.”\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year the Vokes, a famous family of dancers,\r\nmade their appearance, the programme including “The Two Gregorys,”\r\na comic ballet, and “The Mountain Sylph,” and “The Beauties of the\r\nHarem,” in which a Mlle. Sismondi appeared with much success. The\r\nChristmas pantomime which followed, with the title “Harlequin Prince\r\nHappy-go-Lucky, or Princess Beauty” (a title quite in the good old\r\npantomime style), included a ballet, with such performers as Mlles.\r\nPitteri, Sismondi, and another well-known dancing family, the Elliots.\r\n\r\nThere was a change of management in March, 1872, when John Baum,\r\nfrom Cremorne Gardens, took up the reins and produced Offenbach’s\r\n“Le Roi Carotte,” with M. Jacobi as musical director, and ballets\r\nas a feature of the production. Then followed “The Black Crook,”\r\nand Offenbach’s beautiful opera, “La Belle Hélène,” and then, in\r\nDecember, 1873, “Don Juan,” in each of the last two Miss Kate Santley\r\nplaying “lead.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of next year came “La Jolie Parfumeuse,” followed in\r\nthe autumn with a ballet, “The Demon’s Bride,” and “Whittington,” an\r\n_opéra bouffe_, in which the honours were shared by Miss Kate Santley\r\nand Miss Julia Mathews.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1875, with Mr. Joseph A. Cave as Manager and\r\nproducer, came “Spectresheim,” and a comic ballet, “Cupid in\r\nArcadia,” in which the Lauri family and “The Majiltons” appeared.\r\nA succession of farces, pantomimes, extravaganzas, light opera and\r\nballets followed, the more noteworthy productions being Strauss’s\r\n“Die Fledermaus,” produced at the Alhambra on January 9th, 1877.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the lavish manner in which the audiences of those\r\ndays were catered for, the programme for that evening is interesting.\r\nThere was none of the “9 to 11” business about the theatres then. The\r\n“gallery boy” paid his sixpence, or the “pittite” his two shillings\r\nexpecting a run for his money--and got it! The majority of theatres\r\nbegan their performance at 7.15 p.m.; and those that did not, started\r\neven earlier, sometimes as early as six o’clock, and often with four\r\nor five productions. On January 9th, 1877, the programme at the\r\nAlhambra was as follows:\r\n\r\n   7.15.  “A Warning to Parents.”   A Farce.\r\n    8.0.  “Die Fledermaus.”         Opera Comique by Johann Strauss.\r\n   10.0.  The Celebrated Girards.   Eccentric Dancers.\r\n  10.15.  “The Fairies’ Home.”      A New Grand Ballet.\r\n\r\n“Die Fledermaus” had an excellent cast, including Miss Emma\r\nChambers--a very popular soubrette of the time--and Mr. Harry\r\nPaulton; while in the ballet were a Mlle. Pertoldi, a very handsome\r\n_danseuse_ of statuesque proportions, a Mlle. T. de Gillert, a clever\r\nmime, and among lesser lights Mlles. Sismondi, Melville, Rosa and\r\nRichards, who were for several years to be more or less prominently\r\nassociated with the Alhambra ballet.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year was staged Offenbach’s _opéra bouffe_,\r\n“Orphée aux Enfers,” with handsome, golden-tressed Cornélie d’Anka\r\nas the chief attraction; the same programme including the ballet of\r\n“Yolande,” “invented and designed” by Alfred Thompson, with music\r\nby Mons. G. Jacobi, and dances by Mons. A. Bertrand, from the Paris\r\nOpera, who was later to become more closely associated with Alhambra\r\nproductions. The principal _danseuses_ were Mlles. Passani, Pertoldi,\r\nde Gillert and M. A. Josset.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that it was “towards the end of 1877” that the\r\nlate Mr. Charles Morton--one of the ablest theatrical managers London\r\nhas known--took charge of the Alhambra, and that he started his\r\nconnection therewith by reviving one of his former great successes,\r\nnamely, “La Fille de Madame Angot.” He may have become connected with\r\nthe theatre towards the end of 1877, but apparently the first time\r\nhis name appeared on the programme as Manager was early in January,\r\n1878; and not with “Madame Angot” as his first production, but with\r\n“Wildfire,” a “Grand, Spectacular, Fairy, Musical and Pantomimic\r\nExtravaganza” (as it was described) by the then very popular\r\n_collaborateurs_, H. B. Farnie and R. Reece--an extra extravagant\r\nextravaganza in three acts and fourteen tableaux!\r\n\r\nThis remarkable production had a strong cast, including Harry\r\nPaulton, J. H. Ryley, two charming singers, Miss Lennox Grey\r\nand Miss Pattie Laverne; and among the _danseuses_ in the\r\n_divertissement_--Mlles. Pertoldi, de Gillert and Sismondi.\r\n\r\nNext month came a triple bill, starting at 7.20 with a farce,\r\n“Crowded Houses”; then, at 8, “La Fille de Madame Angot,” with\r\nMlles. Cornélie d’Anka, Selina Dolaro and Lennox Grey as the bright\r\nparticular stars; followed, at 10.30, with “Les Gardes Françaises,” a\r\ngrand military ballet; with Mlles. E. Pertoldi and T. de Gillert as\r\nthe leading artists, the dances being arranged by Mons. A. Bertrand,\r\nthe whole production proving very successful.\r\n\r\nMuch of its success--as in the case of the two or three preceding\r\nspectacles--was attributable largely to the beauty of the staging and\r\nthe splendour of the costumes, apropos to which it should be noted\r\nhere that it was first in 1877 that M. and Mme. Charles Alias first\r\nbegan to make costumes for the Alhambra, and were associated with it\r\nin several subsequent productions until the end of 1883.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until 1884, when the Magistrate’s licence for\r\nmusic and dancing was again recovered, that M. Alias (to whom I am\r\nindebted for several details of the theatre’s history) regularly took\r\nup the position of Costumier to the Alhambra, in which capacity he\r\nhad entire control of the costume department--a very important factor\r\nin spectacular production--and supplied every dress worn on the stage\r\nfor a period of about thirty years. Considering that there were some\r\nnine or ten complete changes of management during that time it speaks\r\nvolumes for his ability and the excellence of the work done by M.\r\nAlias that his services should have been retained through so lengthy\r\na period.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the days when the Alhambra was not a\r\n“music-hall” but a theatre, with the Lord Chamberlain’s licence, and\r\nwas giving _opéra comique_ and _opéra bouffe_ as well as ballet.\r\nCharles Morton’s next production, in April, 1878, was another\r\nOffenbach revival, namely, “The Grand Duchess,” with Mlle. Cornélie\r\nd’Anka, Miss Rose Lee and J. D. Stoyle (“Jimmy” Stoyle), Pertoldi and\r\nT. de Gillert in the cast, M. Bertrand (by now engaged as “resident”\r\nballet-master) introducing two ballets, one Hungarian and the other\r\nBohemian.\r\n\r\nIn the following June came the production of Von Suppé’s comic opera,\r\n“Fatinitza,” adapted by Henry S. Leigh, with the late Aynsley Cook,\r\nMiss Rose Lee, John J. Dallas and other popular stars in the cast. It\r\nwas preceded by a farce, “Which is Which,” and followed by a “grand\r\nIndian” _ballet d’action_ by the late J. Albery, entitled “The Golden\r\nWreath,” arranged by Bertrand, with music by Jacobi, and with Mlles.\r\nG. David, E. Pertoldi and T. de Gillert as dancers. It was, from\r\nall accounts, a very gorgeous production. Indeed, so successful was\r\nit that when Offenbach’s “Geneviève de Brabant” was staged in the\r\nautumn, this ballet was “still running.”\r\n\r\nThe sensation of the following spring was the production of “La Poule\r\naux Œufs d’Or,” a “new grand Spectacular and Musical _féerie_,” by\r\nMM. Denhery and Clairville, adapted to the English stage by Frank\r\nHall, with a very strong cast including such well-known favourites\r\nas Constance Loseby, Emily Soldene, Clara Vesey, Violet Granville,\r\nthe celebrated French duettists Bruet and Rivière, Aynsley Cook, E.\r\nRighton (“Teddy” Righton), with Pertoldi and de Gillert as leading\r\n_danseuses_.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn came a revival of Offenbach’s “The Princess of\r\nTrebizonde,” with Miss Alice May, Miss Constance Loseby, Miss Emma\r\nChambers, Mr. Charles Collette, Mr. Furneaux Cook, in the cast, the\r\nopera being followed by “Le Carnaval de Venise,” a ballet in which\r\nthat fine, statuesque dancer and expressive mime, Mme. Malvina\r\nCavallazi--later to become so great a favourite with the Empire’s\r\naudiences--was supported by Mlle. de Gillert and other Alhambra\r\nfavourites, and for which, as in the case of many ballets at this\r\nperiod--the gorgeous costumes were from designs by Faustin.\r\n\r\nThis was succeeded by Lecocq’s comic opera “La Petite Mademoiselle,”\r\nof which the English libretto was by Reece and Henry S. Leigh, a\r\nvery brilliant cast including the late Fred Leslie, Harry Paulton,\r\nConstance Loseby, Emma Chambers and Alice May, the opera being\r\npreceded by a farce and followed by a ballet, “Carmen,” dances by\r\nBertrand and music by Jacobi.\r\n\r\nOn December 22nd, 1879, came the production of “Rothomago,” a “Grand,\r\nNew, Christmas Fairy Spectacle,” arranged by H. B. Farnie from the\r\nFrench, in four acts and _seventeen tableaux_! It was the day of big\r\nadjectives and big productions.\r\n\r\nThis apparently started the modern fashion of requiring a positive\r\nsyndicate of musical collaborators, for the late Edward Solomon was\r\nresponsible for the music of the First Act, P. Bucalossi for the\r\nSecond, Gaston Serpette (composer of “Les Cloches de Corneville”) for\r\nthe Third, no less than three ballets being contributed by Jacobi.\r\nThe cast included Constance Loseby, Mlle. Julie, Emma Chambers, Harry\r\nPaulton, Pertoldi, de Gillert, Rosselli; the costumes were designed\r\nby Mr. C. Wilhelm, and executed, as were so many of the costumes for\r\nthese earlier productions, by Madame Alias, Miss Fisher and Mrs. May.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1880 was marked by the successful production of\r\nOffenbach’s “La Fille du Tambour-Major,” with an excellent cast\r\nincluding Constance Loseby, Edith Blande, Fanny Edwards, the\r\nfascinating Fanny Leslie--who later became so popular a “variety\r\nartiste”--Fred Leslie, and Fred Marvin. It was followed by a gorgeous\r\nEgyptian ballet “Memnon,” in which Mlle. Pertoldi, Miss Matthews--a\r\nvery handsome English dancer--and Mlles. Rosa and Marie Muller\r\n(pupils of Mme. Katti Lanner) were the chief attractions, not to\r\nmention Ænea, known as the “Flying Wonder.”\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Morton left the Alhambra in 1881, and a striking success\r\nwas achieved by the new manager, Mr. William Holland, with “Babil and\r\nBijou,” the cast including Miss Rosa Berend, Miss Constance Loseby,\r\nHarry Paulton, and Harry Monkhouse; while in the two grand ballets\r\narranged by Bertrand and for which the dresses were designed by\r\nMr. Wilhelm, were to be seen Mlle. Pertoldi, and Mme. Palladino, a\r\n_petite_ and fascinating dancer who later was to become one of the\r\nleading favourites at the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1882, the theatre was burnt down, and on rebuilding\r\nvarious successful productions were staged. The house, however, did\r\nnot really enter upon its most triumphant phase until October, 1884,\r\nwhen it became the Alhambra Theatre of Varieties, with ballet now as\r\nits main attraction.\r\n\r\nThe first of the productions was “A Village Festival,” a new grand\r\nballet of Olden Times, with Mlle. Palladino as the _première\r\ndanseuse_. It was followed in the December with another, a very\r\nsuccessful ballet, “The Swans,” with Mlle. Palladino and a Miss\r\nMathews, a very popular dancer in her day. On the Christmas Eve\r\nyet another was staged, “Melusine,” a new fantastic ballet, in\r\nwhich a Mlle. Sampietro was supported by Miss Mathews. “Nina the\r\nEnchantress”; “Le Bivouac”--a military spectacle; “Cupid;” “The\r\nSeasons”; “Nadia”; “Algeria”; “Dresdina”; “Enchantment”; “Antiope”;\r\n“Ideala,” a “pastoral divertissement”; “Irene”--a fantastic\r\nballet; “Our Army and Navy”--patriotic spectacle; “Astrea,” were\r\nprogressively successful productions.\r\n\r\n“Asmodeus”; “Zanetta” followed, bringing us to June, 1890, and these\r\ntoo, were notable for some gorgeous stage effects which drew “all\r\nLondon,” and for the dancing of principals such as the two already\r\nmentioned, and of Mme. Cormani, Signorina Legnani, Signorina Bessone,\r\nMme. Roffey and Signor de Vicenti, the last named being for many\r\nyears associated with the Alhambra productions.\r\n\r\n“Salandra,” given for the first time on June 23rd, 1890, was a\r\nremarkably fine production, and with the late Charles Morton as\r\nActing Manager, Vernon Dowsett as Stage Manager, Mr. T. E. Ryan for\r\nScenic Artist, Signor Casati as _maître de ballet_, M. and Mme.\r\nAlias responsible for the costumes; and a superb orchestra of fifty\r\ninstrumentalists under Mons. G. Jacobi, the Alhambra’s new era of\r\ngrowing prosperity was now assured.\r\n\r\nThe ballet was in five tableaux, and involved some striking changes\r\nof scene. The heroine, Salandra (Signorina Legnani) was a Gipsy\r\nQueen, and the opening scene introduced various Tzigane dances.\r\nThere was an exciting wrestling match, and a lively hunting dance in\r\nthe third tableau; a charming fair scene in the last, and the whole\r\nproduction exhibited to the full those characteristics of brightness,\r\nefficiency of performance, and splendour of stage effect, which were\r\nlong to mark the Alhambra as a house of distinction and one high in\r\npopular favour.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas of that year “The Sleeping Beauty” proved attractive,\r\nand was followed in 1891, by “On the Roofs,” a “pantomime\r\nballet” by the famous Lauri troupe. “Oriella,” a new fantastic\r\nballet--described as “the most beautiful of all” then produced at\r\nthe Alhambra--followed; then a musical pantomime by Charles Lauri,\r\n“The Sculptor and the Poodle”; then a comic ballet, “The Sioux,” by\r\nCharles Lauri and his troupe, with music by Mr. Walter Slaughter; and\r\nin September, 1892, came “Up the River,” a very popular production\r\ninvented by the late John Hollingshead (who was now Manager) in which\r\nthe rural and riverside scenery by Mr. T. E. Ryan was very much\r\nadmired; the scenic effects--including a remarkable storm--being\r\nadmirably managed; the ballet capitally performed; and M. Jacobi’s\r\nflowing and richly orchestrated music proving better than ever.\r\n\r\n“Temptation,” a “new, grand fantastic ballet, in three tableaux,”\r\ninvented and arranged by Signor Carlo Coppi, with scenery by Ryan,\r\nand music by M. Jacobi, was a big and very successful production, in\r\nwhich a Signorina Elia, as _première_, made a hit.\r\n\r\nThe production of “Aladdin” by John Hollingshead on December\r\n19th, 1892, called forth tributes of praise for the enterprising\r\nand ingenious Manager. The familiar story was well kept to, the\r\nsituations were telling, and the four changes of scene were effected\r\nwithout once lowering the curtain, while the last, “The Veil of\r\nDiamonds,” was amazing. A tableau curtain of glass was introduced,\r\ncomposed of some 75,000 glass facets held together by _twenty-four\r\nmiles_ of wire, and illuminated by various electric and other lights\r\nof different colours, the whole achieving one of the most wonderful\r\neffects ever seen on the stage, one not easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe cast was a strong one, Signorina Legnani--a finished dancer of\r\nthe typical Italian school--as the Princess; Mlle. Marie, a charming\r\nlittle dancer and clever mime, as Aladdin; Signorina Pollini, as the\r\nSpirit of the Lamp; that fine actor and dancer, Mr. Fred Storey, as\r\nthe Magician; with good support from Mme. Roffey, Miss Hooten, the\r\nAlmonti Brothers, and, of course, a wondrous array of beauty among\r\nthe Alhambra _corps de ballet_. Mr. Bruce Smith had provided artistic\r\nscenery; Mr. Howard Russell was the designer of the costumes--as for\r\nseveral of the Alhambra ballets--which were admirably turned out as\r\nusual by M. and Mme. Alias; and M. Jacobi had once again surpassed\r\nhimself in the music, that for the beautiful “chrysanthemum” scene\r\nand a waltz in A, in the finale, proving especially popular.\r\n\r\nAnother great success was achieved in the production of “Chicago,” in\r\nMarch, 1893, a lively, up-to-date production, which later ran into a\r\nsecond edition. “Fidelia,” adapted from “Le Violon du Diable,” was a\r\nromantic ballet that also went into a second edition. The Alhambra\r\nby now had as Business Manager, Mr. Albert A. Gilmer, with Mr. A. G.\r\nFord as Stage Manager, though Signor Casati, as _maître de ballet_,\r\nM. G. Jacobi, as conductor and composer of the music, were still\r\ncontinuing in their accustomed spheres.\r\n\r\nYet another success achieved under the same able direction was\r\n“Don Quixote,” with Mr. Fred Storey as a brilliant exponent of the\r\ntitle-_rôle_, and Signorina Porro as the Dulcinea, La Salmoiraghi as\r\nthe niece, and Mr. Fred Yarnold, as the Sancho Panza, other parts\r\nbeing well filled by Miss Julia Seale (a handsome and clever dancer\r\nand mime long associated with the Alhambra), Mme. Roffey, Miss Hooten\r\nand the Almontis.\r\n\r\nThe ballet was a great success with the public, and a happy comment\r\nby a leading critic was as follows: “Within the charming framework\r\nof the four admirably painted scenes by Ryan there is a continuous\r\nprocession of ballet incident, the costumes quaint, picturesque,\r\npoetic, splendid, and nevertheless suggestive always of old Spain.\r\nMr. Howard Russell, the designer, deserves great praise for the\r\nfancy and versatility which he has been able to show without proving\r\nunfaithful to his theme. While his beautiful dresses give rare\r\nvariety and character to the dances of maidservants, pages, millers,\r\ngrape-gatherers, brigands, wood-nymphs, in the earlier portions of\r\nthe piece, they are seen to really magnificent effect in the grand\r\ngathering of all the Terpsichorean forces of the theatre in the final\r\ntableau. The stage organisation of the Alhambra is always good.\r\nNowhere do we see better mass dancing; and nowhere either do the\r\ndancers receive more assistance from the musician. M. Jacobi’s ballet\r\nmusic is as sympathetic as its tunefulness is inexhaustible. This is\r\nM. Jacobi’s eighty-ninth ballet here.” That last remark may come as a\r\nrevelation to those who do not realise how much of ballet we have had\r\nat two London theatres in the past thirty years. “Don Quixote” was M.\r\nJacobi’s “eighty-ninth ballet” at the Alhambra, and--there were other\r\nJacobian productions to follow!\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Moul in 1894 became the General Manager of the Alhambra\r\nand the evidences of his long associations with the dramatic and\r\nlyric stage were quickly apparent in the series of brilliant\r\nsuccesses with Ballet which now were placed to the credit of the\r\nhistoric house of which he had assumed control.\r\n\r\nA marked success in the summer of the same year was “Sita,” the story\r\nof which dealt with an Indian girl’s hopeless love for the accepted\r\nlover of her master’s daughter.\r\n\r\nA grand spectacular ballet, on the familiar theme of “Ali Baba and\r\nthe Forty Thieves,” was the sensation of the close of 1894, more\r\nparticularly owing to the introduction of an “aerial ballet” by\r\nthe well-known Grigolati troupe. The treatment of the story was on\r\nconventional lines, naturally, but the ballet was gorgeously staged,\r\nand introduced an especially attractive dancer, Signorina Cecilia\r\nCerri, while Mlle. Louise Agoust, as Morgiana, added to the laurels\r\nshe had already won in other productions as a first-rate mime of\r\ndramatic character. “Bluebeard” was another popular success on\r\nfamiliar lines; and “Rip Van Winkle”--with Mr. Fred Storey, masterly\r\nas Rip--yet another, towards the end of 1896.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Moul then staged “Victoria and Merrie England,” a “grand\r\nnational ballet in eight tableaux,” the scenario being arranged\r\nand the ballet “invented” by Signor Carlo Coppi, the music being\r\nby no less a personage than Sir Arthur Sullivan, M. Jacobi still\r\nconducting, while the scenery was by Mr. T. E. Ryan, the costumes\r\nby M. and Mme. Alias from designs by Mr. Howard Russell, the cast\r\nincluding Signorina Legnani, Miss Ethel Hawthorne, Miss Julia Seale\r\nand Miss Josephine Casaboni. The ballet was a huge success. It was\r\ncertainly one of the finest spectacular and “patriotic” productions\r\never seen on the London stage, and it is one of the proudest records\r\nof the Alhambra that the performances were honoured with nearly a\r\nscore of Royal visits.\r\n\r\nOne of the great successes of the spring of 1898 was a grand ballet\r\non the old theme of “Beauty and the Beast,” invented and produced by\r\nSignor Carlo Coppi, with music by M. Jacobi, the interest being kept\r\nup throughout in a _crescendo_ of pageantry. The sensation of the\r\nproduction was, perhaps, the second tableau, “The Garden of Roses,”\r\nin which the popular Signorina Cerri, supported by the _corps de\r\nballet_, appeared in a grand valse representing every known kind of\r\nrose, each dancer being almost hidden by gigantic presentments of\r\nthe flowers--red, tea, moss roses and every other type--a luxurious\r\nmass of living blossoms, weaving itself into ever fresh and endless\r\nharmonies of colour and enchantment. Yet another gorgeous effect was\r\nattained by a Butterfly ballet, and the whole thing was one more\r\ntriumph for Mr. T. E. Ryan as scenic artist, Mr. Howard Russell and\r\nM. Alias, responsible for the wonderful costumes; a triumph indeed\r\nfor all associated with the production.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of Mr. Moul, which took place in 1898, Mr. C.\r\nDundas Slater became General Manager, with Mr. James Howell as\r\nBusiness Manager, Mr. Charles Wilson as Stage Manager, Mr. H.\r\nWoodford as Secretary and Treasurer; and Mr. G. W. Byng as Musical\r\nDirector--the last two named gentlemen holding their appointments for\r\nmany years following.\r\n\r\nA very popular production of this year was “Jack Ashore,” modestly\r\ndescribed as “an unpretentious Sketchy _Divertissement_ in One\r\nTableau” which was invented and produced by Mr. Charles Wilson, with\r\ndances arranged by Signor Pratesi, and music by Mr. George Byng. It\r\nhad a delightful early nineteenth-century setting for its dramatic\r\nlittle story and was capitally done by a cast including Miss Julia\r\nSeale, Miss Casaboni, the Misses Grace and Sybil Arundale, Mr. Albert\r\nLe Fre, and the Brothers Almonti.\r\n\r\nAn attractive production of the following year was “A Day Off,”\r\nwhich, however, was somewhat outshone by the beauty of “The Red\r\nShoes,” a fine spectacular ballet based on Hans Andersen’s famous\r\nstory, with a good cast including Mlle. Emilienne D’Alençon, Miss\r\nJulia Seale, and Miss J. Casaboni--a very vivacious and attractive\r\ndancer.\r\n\r\nTwo noteworthy ballets of 1900 were “Napoli,” in one scene, written\r\nby Signor Giovanni Pratesi, produced by Mr. Charles Wilson, with\r\nmusic by Mr. George W. Byng; and a patriotic military display,\r\n“Soldiers of the Queen,” produced by Mr. Charles Wilson, under the\r\ndirection of Mr. C. Dundas Slater, the scene representing Queen’s\r\nParade, Aldershot, from sunrise to sunset, concluding with an\r\nInspection and Grand March by the combined bands of Infantry, Drums\r\nand Fifes, _corps de ballet_, chorus and auxiliaries, numbering\r\nover two hundred and fifty, and representing some thirty leading\r\nregiments. Needless to say, produced as it was when patriotic feeling\r\nwas at its height on account of the Boer War, it was as successful as\r\nit was magnificent.\r\n\r\nA “romantic nautical ballet,” in three scenes, entitled “The Handy\r\nMan,” followed in January, 1901. It was written and produced by\r\nMr. Charles Wilson, with music by Mr. George W. Byng, and dances\r\narranged by Signor Rossi. In the same programme was a vocal _ballet\r\ndivertissement_, “The Gay City,” by the same author and musician,\r\nthe dances arranged by Mme. Cormani. Later this was retained, and\r\nwas followed by a “fanciful” grand ballet, entitled “Inspiration,”\r\ninvented and written by Mr. Malcolm Watson, the music being by Mr.\r\nGeorge W. Byng, and the dances by Signor Carlo Coppi, the cast\r\nincluding Miss Audrey Stafford, as the Goddess of Inspiration, Miss\r\nJudith Espinosa, as the Genius of Inspiration, Miss Edith Slack, as\r\na Greek Dancer, Mr. Fred Farren, as Caliban, and other well-known\r\npeople. The year closed with a charming _divertissement_, “Gretna\r\nGreen,” and a revised edition of “Soldiers of the King.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mlle. Palladino in “Nina” at the Alhambra]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Dover St. Studios_\r\n\r\nMlle. Britta]\r\n\r\n“In Japan,” a delightful ballet, adapted by Mr. S. L. Bensusan, from\r\nhis story, _Dede_, with music specially composed by M. Louis Ganne,\r\nproved particularly attractive. There was a good story, the acting\r\nand dancing were unusually good, and the mounting and stage effects,\r\nunder the direction of Mr. C. Dundas Slater and Mr. Charles Wilson,\r\nwere fresh and beautiful, especially the “Ballet of Blossoms.”\r\n\r\nThe theatre at this period was now again to come under the influence\r\nof Mr. Alfred Moul. At an Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders\r\nat the commencement of the year 1902, when the fortunes of the\r\ntheatre seemed once more uncertain, Mr. Moul was invited again by\r\nboth Shareholders and Directors to assume control. He responded, and\r\nwithin a few weeks was installed as Chairman of the Company, once\r\nmore throwing his energies into a congenial task. One of his first\r\nachievements was to secure the services of an old _protégé_ and a now\r\neminent musician, Mr. Landon Ronald.\r\n\r\nFrom the pen of that accomplished artist came the music for a\r\nspectacular Patriotic Ballet entitled “Britannia’s Realm,” in a\r\nprologue and four scenes, invented and produced by Mr. Charles\r\nWilson, with dances by Signor Carlo Coppi. It was one of the best\r\nplanned and most extraordinarily sumptuous productions ever seen\r\nat the Alhambra, long famous for the splendour of its effects, and\r\nwhile there were several charming novelties, such as the _Pas des\r\nPatineurs_, in the Canadian Skating Carnival scene (the music of\r\nwhich must still haunt those who heard it), for sheer magnificence\r\nprobably nothing finer has ever been produced on the Alhambra stage\r\nthan the Indian jewel scene, and the grand _finale_ representing\r\n“Homage to Britannia,” and the formation of the Union Jack. It was a\r\nremarkable achievement, and well deserved the enthusiasm with which,\r\nnight after night for some months, it was received.\r\n\r\nAn excellent ballet of 1903 was “The Devil’s Forge,” invented by\r\nMr. Charles Wilson and Mme. Cormani, with music by Mr. George Byng.\r\nThis also ran for some months, and was a charming and dramatic work,\r\nbeautifully staged, and uncommonly well acted, particularly good\r\nwork being done by Miss Edith Slack (a clever mime) as the hero,\r\nKarl, and Miss Marjorie Skelley, a sound and graceful dancer, as the\r\nFairy of the Mountain.\r\n\r\nBefore this was withdrawn a delightful adaptation of “Carmen” had\r\nbeen staged, with much of Bizet’s music, ingeniously handled by Mr.\r\nGeorge Byng, who had composed some admirable extra numbers. It was\r\nfinely staged, notable for the strength of the cast and vitality of\r\nthe entire _corps de ballet_, but above all for the superb acting of\r\nGuerrero as Carmen and M. Volbert as Don José.\r\n\r\nApart from Guerrero’s fine presence, her magnificent dancing, the\r\nbreadth, realism and intensity of her acting throughout, all of which\r\none could never forget, there were two particularly memorable moments\r\nof that production; one was the fortune-telling scene, the other--the\r\nscene in which Carmen flirts with the Lieutenant of Gendarmes in\r\norder to lure him away from the gipsy camp, and is dividing her\r\nattention between her flirtation and the knowledge that Don José has\r\nonly just been frustrated from stabbing her while so engaged, by the\r\nsudden intervention of her comrades, who are endeavouring to drag him\r\naway silently so that the Lieutenant who is just in front shall not\r\nhear and so discover the presence of the gipsy band.\r\n\r\nIn the card scene, Guerrero gave in all its fullness the sense of a\r\ntragic, overhanging doom. In the other, all the combined cunning and\r\nfighting instinct of a savage animal at bay with circumstance, and\r\ntrying by sheer cunning and audacity, to master it, came out, and it\r\nwas not acting but reality, the real Carmen of Mérimée extricating\r\nherself and her comrades from discovery and disaster by superb daring\r\nin the use of her dazzling, unconscionable charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE ALHAMBRA 1904-1914\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of novelty and ample charm in “All the Year Round,”\r\na ballet in seven scenes, written and produced by Mr. Charles\r\nWilson, with bright and appropriate music by the well-known _chef\r\nd’orchestre_ of Drury Lane, Mr. James Glover, on January 21st, 1904,\r\nby which time the late Mr. George Scott was Manager.\r\n\r\nIt was one that should always be worth revival, with topical\r\nmodifications, and though a genuine ballet with a central idea\r\nconnecting its varied scenes, it seemed in form somewhat to herald\r\nthe _revue_ which has since become such a craze. It was what one\r\nmight call a ballet in free form.\r\n\r\nThe chief theme was the whim of a young French Marquis, who, having\r\ninvited friends to a dinner-party and engaged a Hungarian band for\r\ntheir entertainment, himself turns up late to find that his _chef_\r\nis about to resign because the dinner is spoilt, and the servants\r\nare on the verge of striking, while the guests are dancing. Annoyed\r\nat a clock which reminds him of his unpunctuality, he orders its\r\ndestruction. The band now “strikes” and as everything is topsy-turvy,\r\nthe young host--not too blasé to enjoy any new freak--suggests that\r\nservants and guests shall change places. This done, they welcome in\r\nthe New Year, and on the departure of the last guest, the butler\r\nbrings his master a large Calendar which the young man is mockingly\r\nabout to destroy also, when the Spirit of Happiness descends from\r\nit, and as he pursues her, she asks him to learn how he may obtain\r\nHappiness throughout the dawning year--thus paving the way for a\r\nsort of _revue_ of the Months.\r\n\r\nThe scheme gave scope for a number of charming and novel effects and\r\ntopical reference to various old festivals, such as St. Valentine’s\r\nDay, St. Patrick’s Day; various sports and pastimes; a river scene, a\r\nseaside bathing scene, an August Bank Holiday Revel. But the greatest\r\ncharm of the production was in scenes where a more poetic fancy had\r\nhad free play, as in the May scene, with the approach of Spring, a\r\nglory of white and pink may, lilac and laburnum, and heralding the\r\nblossoms of early summer, finishing with a ballet of swallows and May\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe Autumnal scene, with its ballet of wheat, cornflowers, poppies\r\nand autumn leaves, was a charming incident and provided an excellent\r\ncontrast to the earlier scene in the warmth of its colouring. The\r\nNovember scene was, rightly enough, placed in London, on the Thames\r\nEmbankment by Cleopatra’s Needle, amid a typical London Fog; while\r\nthat of December closed with a grand Christmas ballet of holly and\r\nmistletoe and icicles, with snow-clad tree and hedgerow in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a capital production and was still in the programme\r\nwhen a new and topical ballet, “The Entente Cordiale,” was staged on\r\nAugust 29th following. This also was invented and produced by Mr.\r\nCharles Wilson, with excellent music by Mr. Landon Ronald, and dances\r\narranged and composed by Signor Alfredo Curti, who was for the next\r\nfew years to be closely associated, in the capacity of _maître de\r\nballet_, with the Alhambra Theatre.\r\n\r\nThe opening prologue took place in the “Grove of Concordia,” where\r\nthe five Great Powers of Europe assemble to pay homage to the Goddess\r\nof Progress. But, later, the Demon of War enters upon the world-stage\r\nand stirs up strife among the Nations, so that all the horrors of\r\nWar are felt throughout the world, until finally Peace prevails\r\nand summons the Ambassadors to enter and the Nations to assemble in\r\nthe Temple of Peace, where the Representatives of all the Nations,\r\nassisted by the Orders of the Legion of Honour of France and the\r\nGarter of England, at last form a grand alliance of all the Powers\r\nand ensure the peace of the world in one _Grande Entente Cordiale_, a\r\nscene of splendour strangely annulled in the face of present history\r\nbut, let us hope, prophetic of the future.\r\n\r\n“Parisiana,” a grand ballet in six scenes, invented and produced by\r\nMr. Charles Wilson, with music by Mr. James W. Glover, and dances\r\narranged by Signor Alfredo Curti, and some gorgeous costumes by\r\nAlias, from designs by Comelli, gave us in 1905 fascinating glimpses\r\nof Paris at various periods--1790, 1830, 1906. Among noteworthy\r\nmembers of the cast were Mlle. Jane May, heroine of the earlier\r\nproduction of “L’Enfant Prodigue,” and one of the finest modern\r\nmimes; and also Miss Edith Slack, Miss Cormani, Signor Santini, and,\r\nfor a time, Signorina Maria la Bella.\r\n\r\nBetween October, 1906, and May 14th, 1907, the Alhambra underwent\r\npartial reconstruction, with complete and elaborate redecoration,\r\nunder the supervision of Mr. W. M. Brutton, the Alhambra Company’s\r\narchitect; and big as the task was it was carried through with entire\r\nsuccess and with additional triumph in that it was done without\r\nclosing the theatre for a single night!\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Moul had now assumed the dual task of Chairman and\r\nManaging Director, with the result that under the influence of a\r\ngentleman of extensive theatrical experience, and wide musical\r\nculture, the Alhambra entered upon a new and even yet more brilliant\r\nphase of artistic success in 1907, when “The Queen of Spades,” a\r\nstriking ballet of which the action and dances were composed and\r\narranged by Signor Alfredo Curti, was staged and proved so successful\r\nas to run into a second “edition” and continue in the programme for\r\nsome months.\r\n\r\nSignor Alfredo Curti hailed from the Scala, Milan, where he had\r\nstudied the difficult art of Ballet composition on the historic lines\r\nlaid down by the virtual founder of the Milan school, Carlo Blasis,\r\nof whom, as of Noverre, he was a great admirer, and about whom I had\r\nmany an interesting conversation. Signor Curti, whose scholarship in\r\nthe history of the dance was remarkable, was an enthusiastic follower\r\nof the traditional school, and as an accomplished dancer and mime, an\r\nartist, trained geometrician, and devotee of literature and music,\r\nhe brought to bear on his work as composer of Ballet, a theatrical\r\nexperience and artistic sympathy, somewhat akin to that of Blasis\r\nhimself; and while the action of his ballet was always coherent and\r\ndramatic his appreciation of stage effect and handling of massed\r\ngroups of dancers in motion, were uncommonly fine.\r\n\r\nIn the production of “Queen of Spades,” a dramatic ballet, the\r\nstory of which dealt with the allure of gambling, he was supported\r\non the musical side by that distinguished Italian composer, Signor\r\nMario Costa, some additional numbers being contributed by Mr. George\r\nW. Byng, the costumes, of course, being by Alias, from designs by\r\nComelli, and scenery by Mr. T. E. Ryan.\r\n\r\nWith Signorina Maria Bordin, a finished dancer of the typical Italian\r\nschool, as _prima ballerina assoluta_, seconded by that admirable\r\nmime, Miss Julia Seale, Signorina Morino, Signor Santini, and an\r\nexcellent _corps de ballet_, the production achieved instant success,\r\nand enthusiastically appreciative audiences found special reason for\r\napproval in the novelty of the stage effects, such as the “Dream\r\nVisions” in the third scene, with its “Valse des Liqueurs,” the\r\n“Grand March of Playing Cards and Roulettes,” the novel “Bridge”\r\nminuet; the “Conflict between Evil and Good,” not to mention the\r\ndramatic effect of the “Temptation” scene which followed, and the\r\ngorgeous finale in the “Nymphs’ Grotto of La Source.”\r\n\r\nAmbitious and successful as was this production, it was followed, in\r\nOctober, 1907, by one even more striking, namely, “Les Cloches de\r\nCorneville,” adapted from Planquette’s world-famous _opéra comique_.\r\nThe _ballet d’action_ was invented and presented by Signor Alfredo\r\nCurti to the original music, as ingeniously selected, arranged and\r\nsupplemented by Mr. George W. Byng. Some wonderful costumes were\r\nsupplied by Alias from designs by Comelli, and the entire spectacle\r\nwas produced under the personal direction of Mr. Alfred Moul. Signor\r\nG. Rosi gave an uncommonly fine study of the miserly Gaspard,\r\nSignor Santini making a “dashing” Marquis de Corneville, Miss Daisy\r\nTaylor an attractive Germaine, Miss Julia Seale playing cleverly as\r\nGrenicheux, Signorina Morino as Serpolette, while Signorina Maria\r\nBordin won fresh laurels as the Spirit of the Bells, a part naturally\r\ncalling less for dramatic ability than for the music of motion.\r\n\r\nThe production was beautifully staged. No prettier scene has ever\r\nbeen set on the Alhambra stage than that of the Hiring Fair and Apple\r\nHarvest, with its dance of apple-gatherers and sabot dance; nor one\r\nmore gorgeous than the last, in the Baronial Hall of the Corneville\r\nChâteau, with its striking Grand March of Knights. The ballet ran\r\ncontinuously _for over seven months_, and was revived with no less\r\nsuccess two years later.\r\n\r\nOnce more a “topical” ballet held the place of honour in the\r\nprogramme on May 25th, 1908. “The Two Flags,” a Franco-British\r\n_divertissement_, arranged and produced by Signor Curti, with some\r\ncapital music by Mr. George W. Byng, was presented under the personal\r\ndirection of Mr. Alfred Moul, the chief _rôle_ of “La Gaieté de\r\nParis” being taken by Mlle. Pomponette--the very personification of\r\nFrench _enfantine_ gaiety--well supported by Miss Julia Seale, Signor\r\nRosi, Signorina Morino, and other Alhambra favourites.\r\n\r\nIn the same programme was given, under the title of “Sal! Oh My!” an\r\namusing satire on what we may term the Salome School of Dancing, then\r\nrecently instituted by Miss Maud Allan. The Alhambra skit, described\r\nas “a musical etcetera” (the delightful music of which, by the way,\r\nwas by Mr. George W. Byng), served to introduce to a London audience\r\nfor the first time La Belle Leonora, a very handsome _danseuse_ of, I\r\nbelieve, Spanish origin, who was, for several seasons, to become the\r\n“bright, particular star” of the Alhambra.\r\n\r\nThese two productions held sway for some months, but gave place in\r\nOctober, 1908, to “Paquita,” a charming romantic ballet arranged\r\nand produced by Signor Alfredo Curti, with music by Mr. George W.\r\nByng, who once more proved his talent for composition of the kind\r\nessential for ballet, music rich in expressive melody, dramatic in\r\norchestration, and always appropriate to the action and mood of the\r\nsituation. The production introduced to London audiences for the\r\nfirst time, Mlle. Britta, a young Danish dancer, with an interesting\r\npersonality and a marked gift for acting.\r\n\r\nIn the same programme was included “On the Square,” a\r\n_divertissement_ arranged and produced by Miss Elise Clerc, the scene\r\nof which was laid in Herald Square, New York, and formed a background\r\nfor dances by newsboys, flower-girls, equestriennes, cake-walks,\r\n“apache” dances, a dance of “Fluffy Ruffles and Rough Riders,” a\r\nclever eccentric _pas de deux_, by Miss Elise Clerc herself and the\r\nlate Mr. Frank Lawton (the whistler, who first came into prominence\r\nin London in the original production of “The Belle of New York”),\r\nthe most attractive item in the whole production perhaps being a\r\nmarionette _pas de deux_ by Mlle. Britta and Miss Carlotta Mossetti,\r\na clever dancer and mime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Hana_\r\n\r\nMme. Guerrero]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Dover St. Studios_\r\n\r\nMlle. Leonora]\r\n\r\nThe _divertissement_ held its place in the programme for a\r\nconsiderable time, but was in general character hardly up to the\r\nartistic tone of the Alhambra’s past; and the production of “Psyche,”\r\na classic idyll in three scenes, of which the dramatic action and\r\ndances were by Signor Alfredo Curti, and the melodious, and always\r\nexpressive music was by Mr. Alfred Moul, came as a welcome relief to\r\nthe banalities of ragtime, the more so in that it provided a fine\r\nopportunity for another striking success by Mlle. Leonora, whose\r\nstatuesque grace was particularly well displayed by the classic\r\nbeauty of the setting provided for her.\r\n\r\n“Femina,” another fine production by Signor Curti, gave Mlle. Leonora\r\nopportunities, of which she fully availed herself, more especially in\r\nher own national dance, and Mlle. Britta achieved a marked success\r\nboth as dancer and actress. Since then the more recent influx of\r\nRussian dancers to the Alhambra, in “The Dance Dream,” invented and\r\nproduced by Alexander A. Gorsky, and notable for superb mounting and\r\nthe fine dancing of Mme. Catrina Geltzer and M. Tichomiroff; then the\r\nexquisite “1830,” and since then again, another superb production of\r\na new version of “Carmen,” produced by Mr. Dion Clayton Calthrop,\r\nand with some especially fine dancing by La Malaguenita and other\r\nSpanish artists, all offered us fresh and delightful examples of the\r\nenterprise of the management responsible for them.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, leave any further consideration of the many\r\nnotable examples of Ballet at the Alhambra, which during the past\r\ntwo or three years has been mainly given up to the _Revue_; and\r\nmust now turn to the Empire where an extensive series of always\r\nartistic productions have provided those who witnessed them with many\r\ninteresting and happy memories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE 1884-1906\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore it opened its doors as a regular theatre, with the late H. J.\r\nHitchins as Manager, on April 17th, 1884, the Empire had “played many\r\nparts.” The site had been occupied by a royal residence which became\r\nin time a picture, or exhibition gallery and a café chantant, before\r\nbeing burnt down in 1865. Then the late John Hollingshead and some\r\nfriends proposed erecting a theatre on the site, but the scheme fell\r\nthrough and the ruin remained ruinous for some years, until it became\r\nfor a time a panorama of Balaclava. Then a theatre was started, to\r\nbe called the Pandora, but did not get finished under that title.\r\nFinally it opened as the Empire in 1884, with “Chilperic,” a musical\r\nspectacle in three acts and seven tableaux, founded on the opera\r\nadapted by H. Hersee and H. B. Farnie, with music by Hervé. The\r\nproduction included three grand ballets invented and arranged by\r\nMonsieur Bertrand.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of the third act was a “midnight review and electric\r\nballet of fifty Amazons, as invented by Trouvé, of Paris (being the\r\nfirst time where three electric lamps are carried and manipulated by\r\none person, with the most startling and gorgeous effect).”\r\n\r\nThe dancers included Mlle. Sismondi, Mlle. Aguzzi and Fräulein\r\nHofschuller; and the costumes by Mons. and Mme. Alias were after\r\ndesigns by Bianchini, Faustin and Wilhelm, the last name being famous\r\nin association, from the opening in 1884, with the many brilliant\r\nproductions at the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to be commonly known that while still counted as\r\na “theatre,” the Empire was already foreshadowing its destiny as a\r\nhome of English Ballet. The production of “Polly” was followed by\r\na real ballet, a version of Coppélia--_not_ that of Delibes--but\r\none founded on Hoffman’s famous story, with music by Léo; Delibes’\r\n“Sylvia” also being produced at about the same period. Probably few\r\npeople of to-day are aware that the famous ballet “Giselle” was also\r\ngiven in these early days at the Empire, in December, 1884. And\r\nagain, on December 21st, 1885, was produced “Hurly Burly,” a military\r\npantomime ballet. Yet again, on June 12th, 1886, came “The Palace of\r\nPearl,” in which there were a Moorish ballet, with a Mlle. Luna as\r\n_première_, and a lace ballet, in which Mlle. Pertoldi was the bright\r\nparticular star. The Empire was afterwards occupied for a time by the\r\nGaiety Company in burlesque, while a French company was occupying the\r\nGaiety, and, later, by the musical extravaganza, “The Lady of the\r\nLocket,” in which Miss Florence St. John played the lead, and Mr.\r\nHayden Coffin, I believe, made his first appearance as “Cosmo.” Mr.\r\nEdward Solomon’s opera, “Billee Taylor,” was also mounted for a short\r\nrun, as well as--on March 3rd, 1886--a version of “Round the World in\r\nEighty Days,” in which Miss Kate Vaughan and Mons. Marius appeared.\r\n\r\nIts career as a regular theatre not being as successful as had\r\nbeen hoped, a fresh licence was obtained, and on December 22nd,\r\n1887, under the joint direction of Mr. George Edwardes and the\r\nlate Sir Augustus Harris--with Mr. H. J. Hitchins as Manager--it\r\nstarted afresh as a theatre of varieties, with Ballet as its chief\r\nattraction, and it at once assumed an important place as one of the\r\nleading variety houses of the world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Empire’s prosperous career a wise choice was\r\nmade in the selection of the late Madame Katti Lanner as _maîtresse\r\nde ballet_.\r\n\r\nDaughter of the famous Viennese waltz composer, Joseph Lanner--who,\r\nwhen he died, was followed to the grave by some ten thousand\r\npeople--and herself a keen lover of music, Mme. Katti Lanner had been\r\nin her earlier years a famous _danseuse_, who had appeared as a child\r\nat the Vienna Opera-House, and later made her world-tour, as great\r\ndancers did then and do to-day.\r\n\r\nShe told me, in the first of many pleasant interviews I had with her\r\nin her retirement, how, as a young girl, she had danced with Cerito,\r\nand with Fanny Elssler, and how the latter had prophesied for her a\r\nsuccessful career; and she spoke with deep enthusiasm of the personal\r\nfascination, the brilliant art, and the noble bearing of the great\r\ndancer who was known to London of the ’forties as the “divine” Fanny.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time Mme. Lanner came to settle in London, and\r\nhad produced ballets at Her Majesty’s--at which she had also\r\nappeared--and at Drury Lane, before her invaluable services were\r\nsecured by the far-seeing management of the Empire in 1887.\r\n\r\nShe had already, some ten years before, established her National\r\nSchool of Dancing; and with this to draw upon, it was only natural\r\nthat, from the first, her productions at the Empire should be\r\nmarked by a uniformly high standard of technique. At no theatre or\r\nopera-house can a high standard be maintained unless it can draw upon\r\nsome such school, either on the premises or off, where young talent\r\nis fostered and developed, where consistent practice is kept up under\r\ncritical eyes, and where a uniform degree of technical efficiency and\r\na high sense of style are cultivated. So it has been with Milan and\r\nParis, Vienna and Petrograd; and so it became when Mme. Lanner began\r\nher association with that series of productions at the Empire of\r\nwhich it may be truthfully said that each achieved both artistic and\r\nfinancial success.\r\n\r\nThe programme on the opening night, Thursday, December 22nd,\r\n1887, included two ballets, “Sports of England” and “Dilara.”\r\nThe former--the costumes for which were designed by Mr. Percy\r\nAnderson--was, as its title betokens, a representation of the various\r\nBritish sports and pastimes, and was naturally very popular with the\r\n_habitués_ of the Empire. The second--the costumes of which were\r\ndesigned by Mr. C. Wilhelm--was a brilliant spectacle, of Eastern\r\ncharacter; and both ballets, arranged by Mme. Lanner, with music by\r\nHervé, had a run of some months.\r\n\r\nThey were succeeded by “Rose d’Amour” in May, 1888, which those who\r\nremember it speak of to-day as one of Mme. Katti Lanner’s greatest\r\ntriumphs. It was notable, too, for the appearance of such dancers\r\nas Mlle. Adèle Rossi--who, I believe, had come from the Paris\r\nOpera--Mlle. Santori, Mlle. de Sortis; Ænea, the flying dancer, and\r\nthe wondrous Mons. Cecchetti, who, gifted with amazing youth, was\r\nappearing recently with the Russians at the Royal Opera, Covent\r\nGarden. “Rose d’Amour,” like Darwin’s poem of a century earlier,\r\ndealt with “the loves of the plants,” or at any rate of the flowers,\r\nand the quarrels in flowerland. It was a long and rather elaborate\r\nproduction, with a prodigal array of lovely costumes designed by\r\nMr. Wilhelm; and it rather opened the eyes of Londoners as to the\r\npossibilities of the art of Ballet. “Diana,” a graceful idyll on\r\nclassic lines--the scenario of which was suggested by Mr. Wilhelm,\r\nand arranged by Mme. Lanner--followed on October 31st of the\r\nsame year, with that graceful dancer, Mme. Palladino, and Signor\r\nAlbertieri in the cast, and, later, Mme. Malvina Cavallazzi, who\r\nappeared for the first time in ballet skirts at the Empire, and\r\nfor the last time in the same typical costume; her subsequent\r\nappearances being usually in male character, of which she was a truly\r\nfine exponent. “Diana” was followed by “Robert Macaire.”\r\n\r\nEarly next year came the first London production of Paul Martinetti\r\nand Hervé’s “A Duel in the Snow,” which was less in the nature of a\r\nregular ballet than of pure pantomime, was a finely dramatic effort\r\nwell staged and acted. In the spring of ’eighty-nine was produced\r\nanother superb ballet, “Cleopatra” (inspired by Sir Rider Haggard’s\r\nnovel, then appearing in serial form in the pages of the _Illustrated\r\nLondon News_), which ran for some four months and was immensely\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn it gave place to a popular production, dealing with\r\nthe diversions, and bearing the title of “The Paris Exhibition”; and\r\nin December of the same year, on the eve of Christmas Eve, came a\r\nwonderful production, “The Dream of Wealth,” by Mme. Katti Lanner,\r\nwith music by that fine composer--so long afterwards associated\r\nwith the Empire--Mons. L. Wenzel, and with costumes and accessories\r\ndesigned “as before” by Mr. Wilhelm. The cast included that superb\r\nmime, Signora Malvina Cavallazzi, as a Miser; Signor Luigi Albertieri\r\nas the Demon of Avarice; and dainty little Mlle. Bettina de Sortis as\r\n_première_, representing “The Key of the Jewel Casket.”\r\n\r\nThe same admirable trio were included in the new ballet, “Cécile”\r\n(by Lanner, Wenzel, and Wilhelm, again), which followed on May\r\n20th, 1890, the _première danseuse_ being Mlle. Giuri, a dancer of\r\nexquisite finish and singularly _élégante_ style, as well as a most\r\nadmirable mime. The period of the _divertissement_ was Louis-Seize,\r\nand the production was very charmingly staged, one of the chief\r\npoints being a wonderful colour scheme of almost one tone, composed\r\nof white and silver and mother-of-pearl. This was in the second\r\ntableau, depicting a court in the palace of a Rajah who had very\r\nwrongly abducted a pupil from a French school! In this ballet that\r\ndelightful English dancer Miss Topsy Sinden first made her London\r\n_début_ as a tiny child, with her brother, Bert Sinden.\r\n\r\nThe spring of next year was marked by the production of “Orfeo,”\r\nthe scenario of which was by Mr. Wilhelm, the scenery by Telbin. It\r\nwas an impressive example of classic ballet. Mme. Cavallazzi was a\r\nsuperb exponent of the title-_rôle_, Miss Ada Vincent was excellent\r\nas Eurydice, and good support was given by Mlle. Adèle Rossi and\r\nSignor Cecchetti. The autumn of the same year saw the advent of “By\r\nthe Sea,” perhaps the earliest of the “up-to-date” ballets; and on\r\nDecember 22nd that of “Nisita,” the latter a romantic ballet with an\r\nAlbanian setting, a very pretty second tableau showing a “Revel of\r\nthe Fairies,” and with Mlle. Emma Palladino as the handsome heroine\r\nNita, and Mme. Cavallazzi as the hero, Delvinos. The first night this\r\nwas produced, December 22nd, 1891, by the way, there was one of the\r\nvery worst fogs London has ever seen, so thick that you could not see\r\nthe drop curtain from the third row of the stalls! But the innate\r\nbrightness of the production overcame its gloomy environment at birth\r\nand it ran for months.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1892, came “Versailles,” another superb production for the\r\nscenario of which, as well as of course the costumes, Mr. Wilhelm\r\nwas mainly responsible, though it was as usual “choregraphically”\r\narranged by Mme. Katti Lanner, with delightful music by Mons. Leopold\r\nWenzel. This ran until September, when “Round the Town” (a ballet\r\nthe scenario of which was by Mr. George Edwardes and Mme. Lanner)\r\nwas staged, and proved so popular as a topical _divertissement_ (not\r\nunlike our present day _Revues_) that it held the bill for some\r\nmonths. An interesting point in connection with this ballet was\r\nthat the late Miss Katie Seymour, one of the very neatest English\r\ndancers that ever trod the London boards, joined the cast after\r\nthe production had run a little time, and as a Salvation Lassie\r\nperformed an eccentric dance with Mr. Willie Warde, also an extremely\r\nable English dancer, that was one of the successes of the theatrical\r\nseason. In 1893, the theatre was closed from October 27th to November\r\n2nd, owing to intervention by the County Council.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest productions yet seen at a theatre which by now had\r\nbecome famous for its ballets, was “Faust,” first produced on May\r\n6th, 1895. The scenario of this, as well as the costume designs,\r\nwere by Mr. Wilhelm, and it was an ingenious variation of the Gounod\r\nversion, the music not by Gounod, but by Mr. Meyer Lutz and Mr.\r\nErnest Ford, the ballet being arranged as usual by Mme. Lanner. Mme.\r\nCavallazzi was superb as Faust; Miss Ada Vincent was the Gretchen,\r\nMlle. Zanfretta was a striking exponent of Mephistopheles, and among\r\nthe cast was Mr. Will Bishop, a clever eccentric dancer, who was\r\nassociated with the Empire for several seasons. This was followed,\r\nin the January of 1896, by a charming ballet entitled “La Danse,” in\r\nwhich the history of dancing was illustrated and various dancers of\r\nthe older schools, such as Sallé, Taglioni and others, as well as the\r\nmodern, were typified. In October came “Monte Cristo”--another superb\r\nproduction staged and designed by Mr. Wilhelm, to whom I am indebted\r\nfor many interesting details of the Empire’s history. This brings to\r\na close the record of success from the opening of the Empire in 1887\r\nto the close of 1896. This first phase was one of increasing triumph;\r\na second, more splendid still, was to come. We had seen Ballet\r\nperfect of its kind. But yet, perfection was to be crowned by the\r\nsupremacy of terpsichorean and mimetic art--the art of Adeline Génée.\r\n\r\n“Under One Flag,” a topical ballet in celebration of Queen Victoria’s\r\nDiamond Jubilee, in 1897, ran for some months. Before the close of\r\nthe year the Treasure Island tableau in “Monte Cristo” was staged,\r\nand in this, on November 22nd, 1897, a certain historic event took\r\nplace--Mlle. Adeline Génée made her London _début_ at the Empire\r\nTheatre.\r\n\r\nOne of her critics at the time wrote that: “Her _pas seuls_ commanded\r\nencores which were thoroughly deserved. The dancer is lissom to a\r\ndegree and thoroughly mistress of her art. With her terpsichorean\r\nability she has the advantage of a prepossessing personality,\r\nwhich will assist in endearing her to the public.” So much did\r\nher personality endear her to the public that Mlle. Génée’s first\r\nengagement at the Empire _for six weeks extended to over ten years_,\r\nwith return visits after that!\r\n\r\nLooking back at the great dancers of the past, we see that all\r\nillustrate the incalculable value of personality in art. The\r\ntechnique of a Camargo or Sallé, Taglioni or Grahn, Karsavina or\r\nGénée, has the same foundation--the traditional “five positions,”\r\nwhich are to the Dance what the octave is to the sister art of Music.\r\nBefore a dancer can hope to appear with success on any stage she\r\nmust have acquired a knowledge of those “five positions,” and their\r\npossibilities of choregraphic combination. The ease and rapidity with\r\nwhich she illustrates them, the fluidity of the phrases and melodies\r\nof movement which she evolves from them, and the qualities of\r\n“finish” and “style” are finally achieved only by incessant practice.\r\nShe must attain as complete a mastery of the mechanism of her body as\r\ncan be attained. No technique in any art is acquired without labour;\r\nand no success is won without technique. That much therefore can be\r\ntaken for granted in any great artist. But persistent practice and\r\nthe acquisition of a fine technique may still leave a dancer merely\r\nan exquisite automaton if she has not “personality”; a quality\r\nnot readily defined, but which undeniably marks her as different\r\nfrom others. Perhaps that is, after all, the truest definition--a\r\ndifferentiation from others.\r\n\r\nEndowed with the royal gift of personality, Mlle. Génée had worked\r\nincessantly before she made her first appearance in London at about\r\nthe age of seventeen. Born in Copenhagen of Danish parents, the\r\nfamous dancer began her training when only eight years old, under\r\nthe tuition of her uncle and aunt, Mons. and Mme. Alexander Génée,\r\nboth of whom (the latter as Mlle. Zimmermann) had won considerable\r\nreputation as dancers, and producers of ballet, at various\r\ncontinental opera-houses and theatres in the ’sixties and ’seventies.\r\nThey had appeared at Copenhagen, Vienna, Dresden, Munich, Budapest,\r\nand at Stettin, where Mons. Alexander Génée had a theatre for some\r\nyears, and where Mlle. Adeline made some of her earliest appearances\r\nas a child. Subsequently she went to Berlin and to Munich, and it was\r\nwhile dancing in the latter city that she was called to London by Mr.\r\nGeorge Edwardes on behalf of the Empire management.\r\n\r\nHer first appearance here was emphatically a success. But it was her\r\nperformance as the Spirit of the “Liberty of the Press” in the famous\r\nEmpire ballet, “The Press” (invented and designed by Mr. Wilhelm with\r\nthe choregraphic support of Mme. Lanner and music by Mons. Wenzel),\r\non February 14th, 1898, that first marked her--and for many years\r\nto come--as a London “star.” The ballet gave her scope for some\r\nwonderful _pas_, and proved immensely popular. It was a novel idea,\r\nartistically carried out, and illustrated the history and power of\r\nthe Fourth Estate. A number of charming coryphées were ingeniously\r\nattired as representatives of the various newspapers, boys’ costumes\r\nindicating the morning and girls’ the evening journals. The venerable\r\n_Times_ was typified by a man in the guise of Father Time, with\r\nhour-glass and other symbols of his ancient office, and accompanied\r\nby a retinue. Mme. Cavallazzi represented Caxton, Father of the\r\nPrinting Press; Mlle. Zanfretta, the Spirit of Fashion; and there\r\nwere typical costumes for _The Standard_, _The Daily Telegraph_, _The\r\nGlobe_, _The Daily Mail_ (then two years old!), _The Illustrated\r\nLondon News_ (who announced that she was “Established 1842”), _The\r\nIllustrated Sporting and Dramatic News_, _The Lady’s Pictorial_, _The\r\nSketch_, _The Referee_, and others too numerous to name. So popular\r\ndid the ballet prove that this also ran for months, and it was not\r\nuntil October of the same year that a new production, “Alaska,” was\r\nstaged, the scenario of which was by Mr. Wilhelm, the choregraphy by\r\nMme. Lanner, and music by Mons. Wenzel.\r\n\r\nThe production which a contemporary critic described as “one of\r\nthe most gorgeous ballets ever produced at the Empire,” is another\r\nexample of the influence of topical events on the history of the\r\nBallet, for it was due to the discovery of the Klondyke goldfields,\r\nthe first news of which had come to us the year before, that is,\r\nin Jubilee year, but the real wonders of which only began fully to\r\nreveal themselves in the summer of 1898, when everyone talked and\r\ndreamed of little else than “Klondyke”! The ballet opened with a\r\nblinding snowstorm, and the scene, laid in the snow-bound regions\r\nof the North-West, glowed, as the storm ceased, with the grandeur\r\nof the Aurora Borealis. The story dealt with the adventures of one\r\nAlec Wylie (Mme. Cavallazzi), leader of an expedition to Klondyke,\r\nwho, tempted by the Demon Avarice, quarrels with and leaves for\r\ndead his partner, Frank Courage, whose life is saved by the ice\r\nfairies and who is vouchsafed a vision of golden realms by the Fairy\r\nGood Fortune. The production was rich in striking scenes and stage\r\neffects, and once again Mlle. Génée further confirmed her growing\r\ncapacity to “endear” herself to London audiences by her performance\r\nas the Fairy Good Fortune.\r\n\r\nOn May 8th of the following year, 1899, “Round the Town Again,” by\r\nMme. Lanner, Mr. Wilhelm and Mons. Wenzel, was produced. This was\r\nentirely different from the original “Round the Town,” and with a\r\nsecond edition, also further altered, in January, 1900, ran until the\r\nend of August, 1900, that is, for fifteen months! Mlle. Génée, Mlle.\r\nZanfretta and Mr. Will Bishop were the leading dancers, with a change\r\nof cast for a time when Mlle. Edvige Gantenberg took up Mlle. Génée’s\r\npart of Lisette, a French maid, during the latter’s absence on a\r\nbrief holiday. A revised edition of “By the Sea,” under the title\r\nof “Seaside,” came on in September, 1900, the cast including Mlle.\r\nGénée, Signor Santini, Mr. Will Bishop and also Mr. Frank Lawton,\r\nwhose whistling had so long been one of the attractions, elsewhere,\r\nof the “Belle of New York.”\r\n\r\nNext came a fascinating ballet “Les Papillons,” the scenario and\r\nstaging of which were by Mr. Wilhelm. Of this an enthusiastic critic\r\ndeclared: “It is, indeed, a beautiful butterfly ballet that the\r\nEmpire Theatre is just now able to boast. With it the management\r\ndraws crowded houses, and sends them away delighted--delighted with\r\nthe colour, exhilarated by the movement, charmed by the fancy, and\r\nready to sing the praises of all concerned in a truly marvellous\r\nproduction, and particularly of Mr. Wilhelm, whose designs have given\r\nfurther proof of the taste which governs his fertile imagination\r\nand invention, and of Mme. Katti Lanner, for whom the dances and\r\nevolutions mean another veritable triumph.” Mlle. Adeline Génée,\r\nas lead, played “Vanessa Imperialis,” the Butterfly Queen, who\r\nwas “discovered” at the opening of the ballet fast asleep in the\r\nlovely realm over which she reigned. A glow-worm patrol guarded her\r\nslumbers, which ended with the coming of dawn, when she joined her\r\nsubjects and the flower-fays in dances, and the revels of a fairy\r\nmidsummer’s day dream.\r\n\r\nOn November 6th of the same year followed “Old China,” a delightful\r\nballet, invented and designed by Mr. C. Wilhelm, associated, as\r\nusual, with Mme. Lanner and Mons. Wenzel, and with Mlle. Génée\r\nas _première danseuse_. The opening scene showed a mantelpiece,\r\nbacked by a great mirror, in which the actions of a little Dresden\r\nChina Shepherdess (Mlle. Génée) and her two troublesome lovers,\r\nwere exactly repeated in the looking-glass, through which finally\r\nthe indignant damsel stepped--to the chagrin of her disconsolate\r\nlovers--right into Willow Pattern Land, which formed the second\r\nscene, and into which some particularly rich and beautiful effects\r\nwere introduced. “Old China” ran for some months, and on May 28th of\r\nthe following year was succeeded by another “topical” ballet, “Our\r\nCrown,” again the work of the accomplished trio, who had so long\r\ncontributed to the success of the Empire productions, and were now\r\nreceiving the brilliant assistance of the Danish _première_, who had\r\nthoroughly established herself in popular favour. It was, of course\r\nin celebration of that crowning of the late King Edward which had\r\nbeen so unhappily postponed, through his late Majesty’s illness on\r\nthe very eve of what should have been his Coronation. This, again,\r\nwas a most brilliant production, and the final tableau, practically\r\na “Staircase” scene, in which the great stage was built up with\r\ngroups representative of the jewelled products of the various British\r\ncolonies, rubies, emeralds, diamonds, pearls, was magnificent. As in\r\nthe case of the Victorian Jubilee ballet of five years before, this\r\nwas a conspicuous triumph in the particularly difficult sphere of\r\n_ballets d’occasion_.\r\n\r\nThe first production of 1903 was also the first of what may be\r\ncalled essentially the Génée ballets--ballets, that is, which seemed\r\nmore particularly than before, infused with the personality of this\r\naccomplished dancer. Since her London _début_ in 1897 she had played\r\nthe leading part, certainly, but now it seemed almost as if her\r\npersonality coloured the whole ballet itself, even as unquestionably\r\nher supreme technique set an example and had its influence in raising\r\nthe already high standard of technique throughout the _corps de\r\nballet_. The scenario and staging of “The Milliner Duchess” were by\r\nMr. Wilhelm, and the story was specially designed to give Mlle. Génée\r\nan opportunity of further exhibiting her gifts as an actress. Into\r\na fashionable throng frequenting the establishment of an up-to-date\r\nduchess who was running a milliner’s business was introduced her\r\ndemure little niece, impersonated, of course, by Mlle. Génée; and her\r\nfirst entrance, in a gown of primitively early-Victorian simplicity,\r\nwas charming in its hesitancy, and one realised that she was\r\nsomething more even than a finished dancer, namely, a born mime with\r\na fine artistic appreciation of the _nuances_ of comedy.\r\n\r\nIn her dance descriptive of the charms of country life, so clever\r\nand so perfect was the combination of mime and dance that a positive\r\nillusion was created; and only at the close did one realise,\r\nsuddenly, that it was veritably a song without words. A step, a\r\ngesture, a little glance, and one could have sworn one heard a poet’s\r\nlines! Popular as the dancer had already made herself, her work in\r\nthis particularly charming ballet confirmed the growing opinion that\r\nhere was a dancer who was supreme in her art as a dancer-mime; one to\r\nbe reckoned among any gallery of the great artists of the past.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year was staged a ballet by the same\r\nexperienced trio, Wilhelm, Lanner and Wenzel, entitled “Vineland,”\r\nwhich introduced to us some novel and sumptuous colour schemes\r\nand gave us the sensation of Mlle. Génée’s “champagne” dance, a\r\npiece of terpsichorean music as sparkling as the most glittering\r\nof Offenbach’s operatic melodies. Early next year there followed\r\nthe lively, up-to-date _divertissement_, “High Jinks,” in which\r\nthe leading parts were played by Mlle. Génée, Mlle. Zanfretta, Miss\r\nDorothy Craske, and Mr. Fred Farren.\r\n\r\nAn adaptation by Mr. Wilhelm from the popular Viennese ballet, “Die\r\nPuppenfee,” under the English title of “The Dancing Doll,” was\r\nproduced on January 3rd, 1905, and was notable, among other things,\r\nfor Mlle. Génée’s impersonation of an automaton in situations not\r\nvery dissimilar from those of “La Poupée,” and a notable point in the\r\nproduction was a delightful eccentric dance by Miss Elise Clerc and\r\nMr. W. Vokes, as a pair of Dutch dolls. This very successful ballet\r\nwent into a second edition on April 3rd, and on June 30th the theatre\r\nwas closed for redecoration.\r\n\r\nWhen it reopened on October 9th of that year the _habitués_ found\r\nconsiderable alterations had taken place under the direction of Mr.\r\nFrank Verity, F.R.I.B.A., all designed for their increased comfort,\r\nwhile the decorative style, representative of the true Empire period,\r\nhad a note of distinction hitherto lacking in some of the London\r\nvaudeville houses, a note more in keeping with the demands of modern\r\ntimes. The opening ballet, by Mr. C. Wilhelm and Mr. Sidney Jones,\r\nwas “The Bugle Call,” which had a well defined plot, and in which\r\nMlle. Génée played the part of a French bugler boy of the late\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of January 6th (1906) a version of “Cinderella,”\r\none of the most charming of Mr. Wilhelm’s creations, was staged,\r\noriginally with a view only to _matinée_ performances, but it\r\nproved so successful that it went into the evening bill on February\r\n5th. The creator of the ballet had treated the age-long legend of\r\nCinderella with that respect for its mingled poetry and pathos which\r\nan artist of sympathy must always feel for one of childhood’s most\r\nappealing legends; and he provided Mlle. Génée once more with an\r\nopportunity for proving her remarkable gifts as an actress, fully in\r\nsympathy with the character and sufferings of the little heroine she\r\nimpersonated.\r\n\r\nOn May 14th, Delibes’ classic example of Ballet in its ideal form,\r\nnamely, “Coppélia,” was produced specially for Mlle. Génée, and\r\ngave her, as the heroine, Swanilda, fresh opportunity for further\r\nrevelations of her amazing accomplishments as a dancer and for her\r\nexpressive acting; in which, by the way, she was admirably supported\r\nby Mr. Fred Farren in the character of the old doll-maker, Coppélia;\r\nand by Miss Dorothy Craske as Coppélia’s somewhat wavering lover. The\r\nproduction was a great success. How should it have been otherwise?\r\nPerfectly staged and perfectly performed, it is, with its haunting\r\nSlav rhythms and flowing _valse_ melodies, one of the most charming,\r\nand musically, one of the most expressive ballets in the world’s\r\n_répertoire_.\r\n\r\nThis was followed on August 6th by one of the most exquisite\r\nproductions the Empire had yet seen, a ballet by Mr. C. Wilhelm,\r\nentitled “Fête Galante,” which had been expanded from the opening\r\nscene of “Cinderella.”\r\n\r\nTo see the “Fête Galante” was itself a liberal education in the art\r\nof stage effect. It was an ideal realisation of the art of Watteau,\r\nLancret, and Fragonard. The very spirit of the period was caught, and\r\nit was as if all that one had learnt at secondhand of the people, the\r\ndress, the manners, dances, arts and music of the “Grand Century” in\r\nFrance had suddenly awakened into life, and become a living reality\r\nof which one was a living part. Yet, paradoxically, it was strangely\r\ndream-like still, even as are Watteau’s pictures.\r\n\r\nThe scene represented a garden such as you see in so many of his\r\npaintings, and those of his school, primarily reminiscent of Pater’s\r\n“Conversation Galante” and Watteau’s “Fête Galante,” “L’amour au\r\nThéâtre Français,” and the “Terrace Party.” One of the young Court\r\nladies reminded one of the central figure in the “Bal sous une\r\nColonnade.” A minuet was in progress. All was stately and dream-like,\r\nmade the more so by the music.\r\n\r\nFor all the gaiety of the huntsmen’s entrance it was gaiety demure,\r\nas if restrained by an inherent sense of fitness with stately\r\nsurroundings; and so with the troupe of dancers, introduced for the\r\ndiversion of the Marquise Belle Etoile, and the Court ladies and\r\ncourtiers grouped about her. The mood of all, demurely gay, or gaily\r\ndemure, was suffused with a stately languor, a dream-like grace that\r\nfound an echo in the subtle colour-harmonies of the old-world garden\r\nin which the people moved.\r\n\r\nAnd when the opera-dancer, L’Hirondelle, and Passepied the master\r\nof the revels, began their _pas de deux_, the climax of exquisite\r\nillusion was reached, and Camargo was before us--the Camargo\r\nof Lancret’s famous picture, with the soft, full white skirts,\r\ntrimmed with garlands of small pink roses and falling almost to the\r\nankle; Camargo with the red-heeled, red-rosetted shoes; with blue\r\nshoulder-knot and powdered hair adorned with pale blue ribbons.\r\n\r\nAs the fête drew to a close the picture mellowed in the amber light\r\nof a waning day; and, amid fallen leaf and chestnut bloom, slowly\r\nmarquise and prince, Court lady and courtier, dancer and page, began\r\nin stately fashion to dance, their shadows lengthening in the failing\r\nlight, the music growing slower and dreamier as, little by little,\r\nthe picture was re-formed into the likeness of the opening scene, and\r\nthe falling curtain brought one back into the world of living things\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAnother brilliant reconstruction of the Past was achieved by Mr.\r\nWilhelm in his creation of “The Débutante” (November 15th, 1906),\r\nwhich revivified the men and maids and _modes_, the dance of life,\r\nand the life of the dance, of that strangely interesting period of\r\nthe ’thirties and ’forties, the days of Pauline Duverney, Leroux,\r\nFanny Elssler, and Taglioni’s earlier years. The scene represented\r\nthe _Salon de Danse_ attached to an opera-house, the story dealing\r\nwith the refusal of a star to take up her part in a ballet which is\r\non the eve of production, her place being taken at the eleventh hour\r\nby a _débutante_ (Mlle. Génée) with almost miraculous abilities.\r\nFor this production, and in order that the style of the earlier\r\ndances should be represented on the stage with regard for accuracy\r\nand tradition, Mme. Katti Lanner, who had left the Empire in 1905,\r\nwas induced to withdraw from her retirement temporarily at the\r\nrequest of the Directors, and out of personal friendship towards Mr.\r\nWilhelm, with whose artistic aims she had so constantly shown her\r\nsympathy. Her reappearance to take another “call” proved another\r\npersonal triumph. The ballet was indeed a charming work, fascinating\r\nto students of the dance and mime; and it proved so successful that\r\na new one was not required until “Sir Roger de Coverley,” by Adrian\r\nRoss and Dr. Osmond Carr, staged by Mr. Wilhelm, came into the bill\r\non May 7th in the following year. As its title betokens, it dealt\r\nwith the period of Queen Anne and showed a charming representation\r\nof the life of old Vauxhall. This, too, ran for some months and\r\nwas succeeded on September 30th by “The Belle of the Ball,” which\r\ndelighted many old frequenters of the Empire with its recollection of\r\nscenes from many of the earlier operatic favourites of the ’sixties\r\nand ’seventies, such as “Madame Angot,” “The Grand Duchess,” and\r\nother light operas, coming up to more recent productions, such as\r\n“The Belle of New York,” “The Geisha,” and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mlle. Adeline Génée]\r\n\r\nThe production marked the _début_ of that brilliant young English\r\ndancer, Miss Phyllis Bedells, and also the end of Mlle. Génée’s\r\nunbroken ten years’ reign at the Empire Theatre, the tenth\r\nanniversary of her first appearance being celebrated on November\r\n22nd, when the house was packed from floor to ceiling with a crowd\r\nwhose growing enthusiasm culminated in a perfect tornado of\r\napplause on the falling of the curtain and something like a score of\r\n“calls”; the dancer having achieved by her personality and technique\r\nsuch a triumph as had not been known in London since the great days\r\nof Taglioni and the famous _Pas de Quatre_ of the ’forties. She left\r\nto carry her influence to America, but there were of course return\r\nvisits which concern us not at present in dealing only with what may\r\nbe styled her ten years’ reign.\r\n\r\nBut in watching that decade closely with all its procession of\r\nsuccesses, one thing there is that strikes one very forcibly. It\r\nwas only the natural corollary of the previous decade before the\r\nadvent of Mlle. Génée. For some twenty years the artistic influence\r\nof one mind had been, never obtrusive, but invariably evident; never\r\nobtrusive, that is, to the detriment of that balance of the arts\r\nwhich makes a perfect ballet; I mean the artistic influence of Mr.\r\nC. Wilhelm. Before the coming of Mlle. Génée they had had some good\r\ndancers and some great artistic successes; but there had hardly been,\r\nperhaps, quite that unity and perfection of _ensemble_ which the\r\ncoming of a dancer of superb technique made possible, and which, it\r\nmay be, enabled a designer of ballet, already of great experience\r\nand inspired always by high artistic motives--not only to aim at,\r\nbut to _count on_, achieving just the effect at which he aimed.\r\nTheatrical art must always be a somewhat composite art, but its best\r\nachievements come from a perfect blending of artistic sympathies,\r\nforming a source of mutual inspiration. So, while the personality and\r\ntechnical accomplishment of Mlle. Génée must have proved a stimulus\r\nto the poetic imagination of an artist like Mr. Wilhelm, so, too,\r\nthe famous Danish _danseuse_ could well afford to admit a debt of\r\ninspiration to the refined, sensitive and poetic art of Mr. Wilhelm,\r\nwho has provided so invariably a worthy and gracious medium for her\r\nsupreme art as dancer-mime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE 1907-1914\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the news was first announced that an end was to come to Mlle.\r\nAdeline Génée’s ten years’ reign at the Empire and that the famous\r\ndancer was seeking, if not new worlds to conquer, at least to conquer\r\nwhat was once always spoken of as “The ‘New’ World,” many who had\r\nfollowed the progress of Ballet in London must have wondered where\r\nanyone could hope to find a successor to her throne, and who would\r\nhave the courage to accept an offer thereof.\r\n\r\nBut London theatrical managers are not lacking in resource, or\r\nEnglish girls in courage; and it was with real pleasure that we\r\nheard that so worthy a successor had been found as that graceful and\r\nessentially English dancer, Miss Topsy Sinden, who had already been\r\nassociated with the Empire as a child some years before.\r\n\r\nOf Mlle. Génée’s triumph in “The Belle of the Ball,” I have already\r\nspoken. Shortly after, the production underwent a change, and the\r\nfact that the new version was still in the bill on the following June\r\n1st, proves the popularity of the production and of the Empire’s\r\nchoice of Miss Sinden as _première danseuse_. Her success was the\r\nmore interesting in that in temperament and in methods she was\r\nentirely different from the famous Danish dancer. A typical English\r\ngirl, with all the charm of looks and manner implied thereby, she\r\nhad studied not so much the purely traditional French or Italian\r\nschool of ballet-dancing--though she had, of course, acquired that\r\ntoo--but the English school; of which the late Miss Kate Vaughan was,\r\nin her time, the finest exponent, and of which Miss Sylvia Grey, Miss\r\nPhyllis Broughton, the late Miss Katie Seymour, Miss Letty Lind,\r\nMiss Alice Lethbridge, and Miss Mabel Love, may be taken as leading\r\nrepresentatives during the past twenty years.\r\n\r\nMiss Sinden had had long and invaluable stage experience before\r\nbecoming _première danseuse_ at the Empire; had appeared in pantomime\r\nat Covent Garden, Drury Lane, at the old “Brit,” and at Liverpool\r\nand elsewhere; had “done” the Halls; had appeared at the Haymarket\r\nunder Sir H. Beerbohm Tree’s management; had appeared at the Gaiety\r\nin “Cinderella Up-to-Date,” “In Town,” “Don Juan,” “The Gaiety Girl,”\r\nand “The Shop Girl”; at Daly’s in “The Greek Slave,” in “The Country\r\nGirl,” and other productions; and always she won fresh distinction as\r\none of the most vivacious, _piquante_, graceful and finished English\r\ndancers the London stage has ever known.\r\n\r\nHer appearance in “The Belle of the Ball” was marked by the most\r\ncordial welcome from the Press and the public, and one of the first\r\ngreetings she received on her return to the Empire was a telegram\r\nfrom Brighton which ran as follows: “My good wishes, and I hope\r\nyou will do yourself justice. You are one of the best dancers I\r\nknow.--Adeline Génée.” That Miss Sinden _did_ do herself justice\r\nwas seen in the enthusiastic cheers and demands for _encores_ which\r\ngreeted her at the close of her scenes on that “big night” of her\r\nreturn to the Empire stage.\r\n\r\n“The Belle of the Ball” gave place to a revival of “Coppélia”\r\nand--the return of Mlle. Adeline Génée. Many as her triumphs had been\r\nduring her ten years’ unbroken reign, that Wednesday night, June\r\n10th, 1908, must be recorded in Mlle. Génée’s memory in letters\r\nof gold, for even she can never have seen such a house, so crammed\r\nfrom floor to ceiling with a distinguished audience, including King\r\nGeorge (then Prince of Wales), and been welcomed with such thunderous\r\ncheering and applause as greeted her on her first appearance through\r\nthe little brown door of Swanilda’s balconied house, when she floated\r\ndown the stairs to the centre of the stage, so lightly indeed that\r\nshe seemed almost to flutter before the storm of enthusiasm which\r\nwelcomed her return. And how she danced! Only her peer among poets\r\ncould describe it, and then he would probably feel as Thackeray felt\r\nwhen endeavouring to do justice to Taglioni in “Sylphide!”\r\n\r\nFor some seasons past we have had the Russian ballet as a standing\r\ndish, over which various epicures have gloated as if no other fare\r\nhad ever been. But it is interesting to note that the first of “all\r\nthe Russias” was Mlle. Lydia Kyasht, who made her London _début_ at\r\nthe Empire, in some dances with M. Adolph Bolm, on August 17th, 1908.\r\nFor the present, and to preserve historical order, let the fact be\r\nmerely recorded, leaving further reference thereto until the time it\r\nbecomes necessary to chronicle the handsome Russian dancer’s later\r\nsuccesses.\r\n\r\nOn September 7th of that same year came the production of one of the\r\nmost perfect gems yet seen in the historic gallery of Ballet, namely,\r\n“The Dryad,” a pastoral fantasy in two tableaux, by that brilliant\r\ncomposer, Miss Dora Bright. From time to time, in such productions\r\nas “The Milliner Duchess,” “Coppélia,” and “The Débutante,” we had\r\nhad an opportunity of realising something of Mlle. Génée’s gifts as\r\nan actress apart from her supremacy as a dancer, but it was mainly\r\nas a dancer, surrounded by dancers, that we have seen her. Now,\r\nhowever, we were to have a conclusive revelation of the fact that\r\nhad Mlle. Génée not elected to become a great dancer she could have\r\nachieved distinction as an actress. The story, of which she was the\r\nheroine, gave her an opportunity of proving that; and with herself\r\nin the title-_rôle_, that artistic singer, Mr. Gordon Cleather,\r\nas a shepherd, and with the support of wonderfully expressive and\r\nbeautifully orchestrated _mimodrame_ music, the sister arts of dance,\r\nsong, mime, and music, were brought together to give us a balanced\r\nharmony of lovely and memorable impressions.\r\n\r\nThe fantasy told how a certain Dryad, fairest of the Wood Nymphs,\r\nsubdued all mortals to her by her loveliness and the magic of her\r\ndancing, whom the implacable Aphrodite caused to be imprisoned\r\nin an oak tree, only granting her freedom to come forth once in\r\nevery ten years between sunrise and sunset until she should find\r\na mortal faithful to her during the allotted period. A shepherd,\r\npassing through the wood on the night of her freedom, sees her\r\ndancing beneath the moon, and is lured to love her and vows eternal\r\nconstancy. When the dawn breaks she bids him farewell and re-enters\r\nthe tree, which closes around her. After ten years have passed away,\r\nthe Dryad comes forth again seeking to allay the longing she has\r\nkindled, but her lover had not been constant, and the wood is empty.\r\nShe dances through the night, deluding herself with hope until the\r\nhour of her doom returns and she is compelled to re-enter the tree.\r\n\r\nThe Dryad, afire with joy at being released from the imprisoning\r\ntree, and discovering the beauty of the sunlit, flower-strewn\r\nforest glade; joyous in her love of the handsome shepherd and his\r\nlove returned; her sorrow at parting to return to the tree; her\r\ndeeper joy on her renewed release; her alternating hope and fear\r\nas the concluding moment of the ten-year tryst draws nigh; her\r\neager search for her lover; the shuddering tremors of doubt as she\r\nfinds him not; her triumphant happiness as she hears his voice; the\r\nheart-wringing suspense, and then the overwhelming despair, as she\r\nfinds he has forgotten her for another love and passes on his way,\r\nleaving her solitary and doomed to be imprisoned yet again within\r\nthe tree, desolate amid autumnal desolation; these, and a thousand\r\nmore _nuances_, expressive of poetic emotion, were conveyed with a\r\nsureness, a sensitiveness, a depth of instinctive dramatic genius\r\nthat astonished, delighted and enthralled.\r\n\r\nSo great was the success of “The Dryad” that Mlle. Génée’s engagement\r\nwas extended, but the strain of appearing in both “Coppélia” and\r\nMiss Bright’s exquisite fantasy proving too considerable, the\r\nfamous dancer reserved her strength for her final appearance in the\r\nlatter, while Mlle. Lydia Kyasht, then comparatively a new-comer to\r\nthe Empire audiences, took up the part of “Swanilda,” in Delibes’\r\nmasterpiece with considerable success.\r\n\r\nEre departing for a forty weeks’ tour of America, Mlle. Génée gave a\r\nfarewell “professional” _matinée_ at the Empire, at which everyone\r\nof note in “_the_ profession” was present, and gave her the same\r\nenthusiastic appreciation as had always been accorded by the lay\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mlle. Génée’s departure for America, and Mlle. Kyasht’s\r\nappearance in “Coppélia,” came the production on October 19th, 1908,\r\nof a ballet in five scenes by Lieut.-Col. Newnham-Davis, entitled\r\n“A Day in Paris,” produced by Mr. Fred Farren, with music by Mr.\r\nCuthbert Clarke, the entire production being designed and supervised\r\nby Mr. C. Wilhelm, who was at his happiest in invention and control\r\nof colour in the prismatic beauty of the final tableau of the\r\nArtists’ Ball.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of her previous appearance Mlle. Kyasht’s name had\r\nbeen printed in the programme as Mlle. Lydia Kyaksht, and I remember\r\nwell the humorous dismay the late Mr. H. J. Hitchins expressed to me\r\nas he asked: “How _can_ one pronounce a name like that?” and the\r\neagerness with which he welcomed the suggestion that it would be\r\neasier if the second “k” were omitted. Kyasht it became, and it is as\r\nMlle. Kyasht that we shall always remember the handsome dancer who\r\nwas first of the Russians to win a following in London. She had, of\r\ncourse, received her training at the Imperial Theatre, Petrograd, to\r\nwhich she had been attached some time, appearing there for some eight\r\nmonths each year, and at Monte Carlo and other fashionable centres\r\nfor the remaining months, before she made her London _début_. She has\r\nlittle of that vehemence and abandon which characterises so many of\r\nthe modern Russian school, but she has _au fond_ the same technique,\r\na finely formed and balanced figure, and personal beauty, and her\r\nfirst appearances with that fine dancer, M. Adolf Bolm, in national\r\ndances and _pas de ballet_ evoked very cordial admiration.\r\n\r\n“A Day in Paris” was notable not only for the appearance of the\r\nnew Russian _première_ in a couple of _pas seuls_ and an extremely\r\ncharming _Danse Russe_, but for the brilliant acting and step-dancing\r\nof Mr. Fred Farren, who as a Montmartre student freakishly\r\nofficiating as “a man from Cook’s” to a party of tourists, proved\r\nhimself a born comedian; while in association with that lithe and\r\ngraceful dancer, Miss Beatrice Collier, his _Danse des Apaches_--a\r\ndance without the charm of beauty but undeniably clever--was one\r\nof the “sensations” of the production, so much so that the dancers\r\nbecame in much request for entertaining at social functions that\r\nseason, as Tango performers have been since. Another member of the\r\ncompany, who, though but a child, achieved a marked success, was\r\nMiss Phyllis Bedells, who did some wonderful toe-dancing with,\r\nand without, a skipping rope. The ballet was one of the liveliest\r\nand “jolliest” of many such topical and essentially “modern”\r\nentertainments at the Empire, and it ran from October 1908, well into\r\nthe next summer.\r\n\r\nYet once again Mlle. Adeline Génée returned to the scene of her\r\nformer triumphs to achieve one more, this time in the famous\r\n_ballet-divertissement_ from the third act of Meyerbeer’s opera,\r\n“Roberto il Diavolo,” which was produced by her uncle, M. Alexandre\r\nGénée, on July 3rd, 1909, the _mise en scène_ and costumes being\r\ndesigned and supervised by Mr. C. Wilhelm. Once more we had an\r\nopportunity of enjoying a perfect representation of one of the\r\nclassics of Ballet, in which Mlle. Adeline Génée appeared as the\r\nSpirit of Elena the wicked abbess, who, with the spectres of the dead\r\nand buried nuns, haunts a ruined Sicilian Convent. It was a fine and\r\n_spirituelle_ performance, and a fitting crown to what we may perhaps\r\nbe allowed to call Mlle. Génée’s Imperial career.\r\n\r\nThis was followed on October 9th, 1909, by “Round the World,” a new\r\ndramatic ballet in six scenes, by Lieut.-Col. Newnham-Davis and Mr.\r\nC. Wilhelm, the entire production being designed and supervised by\r\nthe latter, and the dances arranged by Mr. Fred Farren, who himself\r\nplayed the part of a resourceful chauffeur, while Mlle. Lydia Kyasht\r\nimpersonated the lovely heroine, Natalia, a Russian gipsy girl, and\r\nMiss Phyllis Bedells her younger brother, Dmitri. The story concerned\r\nthe winning of a wager by the hero, a Captain Jack Beresford, (Mr.\r\nNoel Fleming), who has to circle the world in a month; and the course\r\nof his adventures took us from the grounds of the Monaco Club to the\r\nPlace Krasnaia, Moscow, on the occasion of a wonderfully realised\r\nnational fête, where he rescues Natalia and her brother from Tzabor,\r\na brutal proprietor of a troupe of gipsy dancers. The third scene\r\nwas on the Siberian railway; the fourth a lovely scene at Tokio, in\r\nthe Garden of Ten Thousand Joys, where the hero is nearly poisoned;\r\nthe fifth, ’Frisco, in “One-eyed Jack’s” saloon, with a capital\r\n_Duo Mexicain_ for Mr. Fred Farren and pretty Miss Unity More; the\r\nsixth and last scene being laid in the foyer of the Empire Theatre.\r\nThe production was a sort of cinema-ballet in the variety of its\r\nscenes and the excitement of its story, and gave scope for a number\r\nof attractive and characteristic dances from Mlle. Kyasht, Mr. Fred\r\nFarren and Miss Phyllis Bedells. It proved so popular that it ran on\r\ninto 1910, when, on March 21st of that year, it went into a second\r\nedition called “East and West.”\r\n\r\nMlle. Kyasht and M. Adolf Bolm, who, early in May, 1910, appeared\r\nin a “Fantaisie Chorégraphique,” a series of charming dance-idylls,\r\nproduced by M. Bolm, are remarkable for that high-voltage\r\ndancing, that volcanic energy and rapidity yet grace of movement,\r\ncharacteristic of the Russian school, some notable exponents of which\r\nwere appearing just about the same time elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe chief dance of the suite at the Empire was one in which Mlle.\r\nKyasht appeared as a beautiful Princess, and M. Bolm as her enamoured\r\nslave--Mlle. Kyasht all charm and poetic ecstasy, M. Bolm all fiery\r\nenergy and terpsichorean miracles, now whirling madly as the wildest\r\nof Dervishes, now suddenly stopping, poised and posed like some\r\nperfect example of classic statuary. The dancers received excellent\r\nsupport from Miss Phyllis Bedells and Mr. Bert Ford; the mounting\r\nand costumes were novel and admirably designed; and the production\r\ngenerally was voted a great success.\r\n\r\nIn the following July came a delightful _ballet-divertissement_, “The\r\nDancing Master,” by Mr. C. Wilhelm, adapted from the first scene\r\nof his earlier success, “The Débutante,” the period chosen--that\r\nof 1835--affording a delightful opportunity for a quaint and\r\npicturesque _ensemble_ of “early-Victorian” or slightly pre-Victorian\r\ncharacter and costume. Mr. Fred Farren repeated his excellent\r\ncharacter-study of M. Pirouette, the excitable _maître de ballet_\r\nat the Opera-House; Mlle. Kyasht made a handsome impersonation of\r\nMimi the _débutante_; and Miss Phyllis Bedells added to her laurels\r\nas Mlle. Lutine, the clever head pupil. On August 8th of the same\r\nyear Miss Bedells took up Mlle. Kyasht’s part of Mimi during the\r\nlatter’s absence on a holiday, and made a great hit as a bewitching\r\nrepresentative of the _débutante_.\r\n\r\nOn October 10th following Mlle. Kyasht and Mr. Fred Farren appeared\r\nin another of Miss Dora Bright’s ideal little fantasies, “The\r\nFaun,” in which the former played Ginestra, a little flower-girl,\r\nand the latter appeared in the title-_rôle_ as a marble faun who\r\ncomes to life when sprinkled with water from a magic fountain. The\r\nproduction, designed and supervised by Mr. C. Wilhelm, was enchanting\r\nin its blending of legend and mystery, with a sunny naturalism in\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nIt was a charming idyll, and provided an excellent opportunity for\r\nclever acting by Mr. Fred Farren, who fully realised the classic\r\nand poetic idea in his representation of the Faun, while Mlle.\r\nKyasht quite surpassed her former work in her appealing and dramatic\r\nimpersonation of the bewitched Ginestra.\r\n\r\nA considerable contrast to the classic grace of this Tuscan idyll\r\nwas seen in the following month when “Ship Ahoy!” a nautical\r\none-scene _divertissement_ by Mr. C. Wilhelm, with music by Mr.\r\nCuthbert Clarke, was staged by Mr. Fred Farren, who also arranged\r\nthe dances. It was a lively and attractive production, with plenty\r\nof fun and a dash of melodrama, the fun being contributed mainly by\r\nMr. Fred Farren as a dandy young officer on leave, and for all his\r\n“dudism” wide-awake enough to frustrate the horrid machinations of a\r\ntreacherous Ayah (originally and admirably played by Miss Beatrice\r\nCollier and later by Miss Carlotta Mossetti) and her accomplice.\r\nThe young officer’s lighter moments were happily given up to\r\nentertaining the Anglo-Indian passengers on H.M.S. _Empire_ with\r\nstep-dancing, the nimbleness and neatness of which only Mr. Farren\r\ncan excel. Bright and charming dances were also contributed by\r\nMiss Phyllis Bedells and Miss Unity More, while Mlle. Lydia Kyasht\r\ndistinguished herself as Léontine L’Etoile, a French _danseuse_; and\r\na special word of commendation is due to the freshness of invention\r\nand novelty of effect achieved by the designer in dealing with the\r\nsomewhat hackneyed stage subject of life aboard ship. The final\r\n_ensemble_, when the lady passengers improvised fancy ball costumes\r\nfrom the ship’s flag-lockers and danced beneath the soft glow of the\r\nswinging lanterns was a particularly novel, pretty and inspiriting\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nOnce more we had a classic ballet when, on May 18th, 1911, Delibes’\r\n“Sylvia,” which, originally in five tableaux, was compressed by Mr.\r\nC. Wilhelm into one for production at the Empire. With its poetic\r\nmythological story and charming sylvan setting, “Sylvia”--first\r\nproduced at the Paris Opera on June 14th, 1876--has always been\r\npopular on the Continent; and it is curious that London should have\r\nhad to wait some twenty-five years before again seeing a ballet,\r\nselections from which had long been familiar as _entr’acte_-music\r\nfor theatre orchestras. Still, it was worth waiting to see it so\r\nadmirably staged.\r\n\r\nAnother contrast followed in the extremely modern and somewhat\r\nformless production, “New York,” an original ballet in two scenes,\r\nby Lieut.-Col. Newnham-Davis, in which seemingly every form of\r\nAmerican eccentricity in dancing--including the “Yankee Tangle!”--was\r\nintroduced. There was a dance of Bowery boys and girls; a “Temptation\r\nRag,” by Mr. Fred Farren; a Buck Dance, an “Octette Eccentric”; a\r\n“Bill-poster’s Dance”; the aforesaid “Yankee Tangle,” and other not\r\nparticularly beautiful or edifying examples, though the staging of\r\nthe “Roof Garden” scene gave one a very agreeable scheme of warm\r\ncrimson and rosy colour, and a picturesquely conceived and dressed\r\nepisode of Pilgrim Fathers and Red Indians.\r\n\r\nEarly in the next year, a brief but graceful “Dance Episode” was\r\nstaged, “The Water Nymph,” arranged by Mlle. Kyasht, who followed\r\non September 24th with another, entitled “First Love,” in which\r\nshe was supported by Mons. Alexander Volinin. This was followed on\r\nFebruary 11th, 1913, by another fanciful ballet-idyll, “The Reaper’s\r\nDream,” in which Mlle. Lydia Kyasht appeared as the “Spirit of the\r\nWheatsheaf,” seen and pursued in his dream by the reaper (Miss F.\r\nMartell); while Miss Phyllis Bedells made a dazzling personage as\r\n“Sun-Ray,” flitting in and out the autumn cornfield, which formed\r\nthe setting for some very pretty dances by the three ladies and the\r\nEmpire _corps de ballet_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most artistic productions at the Empire in quite recent\r\nyears was certainly the choral ballet, in three tableaux: “Titania,”\r\nwhich, adapted of course from Shakespeare’s “Midsummer Night’s\r\nDream,” was arranged and produced by Mlle. Lydia Kyasht and by Mr.\r\nC. Wilhelm, the latter of whom was, as usual, entirely responsible\r\nfor the pictorial side of the ballet. It is interesting to note\r\nthat this was not the first time a Shakespeare play had been so\r\ntreated. No less a person than the great Dryden had adapted “The\r\nTempest” at a time, shortly before the Great Fire of London, when\r\nSir William Davenant was producing “dramatic operas” at a theatre\r\ndesigned by Wren, the Duke’s Theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, which\r\nhe held under a patent granted in 1662 by Charles II. These, as an\r\nearlier historian records, were “all set off with the most expensive\r\ndecorations of scenes and habits, with the best voices and dancers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Dover St. Studios_\r\n\r\nMme. Lydia Kyasht]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Hugh Cecil_\r\n\r\nMiss Phyllis Bedells]\r\n\r\nThen, too, it was but a return to early history to give us\r\nvocal-ballet, for all the earliest ballets on the French stage\r\nwere always described as “opera-ballets,” long declamatory and\r\nchoral scenes being interspersed with dances. Lulli, Rameau, Mouret,\r\nCampra and Monteverde were among the composers of such ballets, many\r\nof which, musically at least, seem wonderfully fresh to-day. This,\r\nhowever, is but a digression. “Titania” at the Empire was a very\r\ngraceful and poetic production, quite fairy-like enough, one feels,\r\nto have delighted even Shakespeare himself, with Mlle. Lydia Kyasht\r\nas a truly regal-looking Titania, Mr. Leonid Joukoff as a dignified\r\nOberon, Miss Unity More as a nimble Puck (a part later played by Miss\r\nIvy St. Helier), and Miss Phyllis Bedells as an enchanting “first\r\nfairy,” Philomel. On Mlle. Kyasht’s departure for America the part of\r\nTitania was taken up by Miss Phyllis Bedells, who added yet another\r\nto her growing list of artistic successes. The ballet, which was\r\nbeautifully staged, gave us some enchanting pictures, one of which,\r\nthe apotheosis of the Fairy Realm seen through a tangled hawthorn\r\nbrake, lingers hauntingly in one’s memory.\r\n\r\nA new edition of “The Dancing Master” was subsequently staged and\r\nwas notable for some brilliant dancing by Miss Phyllis Bedells,\r\nand by Mr. Edouard Espinosa in the title-_rôle_, by whom it was\r\nproduced. Mr. Espinosa, by the way, forms an interesting link with\r\nthe historic past. As the son of Mons. Leon Espinosa (1825-1903),\r\nan Officier D’Académie, Mr. Edouard is heir of a great tradition,\r\nand sustains the heritage most worthily. His father was a pupil of\r\nseven of the great masters of the early nineteenth, namely, Coulon\r\n(1820), Henri (1821), Albert (1829), Perrot (1831), Coralli (1831),\r\nTaglioni (1834), and Petipa (1839), to most of whom reference has\r\nalready been made, and who were themselves, variously, pupils of the\r\nprevious generation--which included Vestris, Noverre, Gardel, and\r\nDauberval--who, in turn, were tutored by Pécourt and Beauchamps in\r\nthe reign of Louis-Quatorze. Mr. Edouard Espinosa himself is a fine\r\ndancer and teacher of the classic and traditional school, and is also\r\none of the best informed on the history of the dance.\r\n\r\n“Europe,” a topical and patriotic _divertissement_, invented,\r\ndesigned and produced by Mr. C. Wilhelm (who, despite his _nom de\r\nthéâtre_, has an English name and is essentially English born and\r\nbred), achieved, on its first performance on September 7th, 1914, an\r\ninstant success. It was worthy of the best traditions of the Empire\r\nTheatre. The choice of such a theme as the condition of Europe,\r\njust before and during the greatest war in history, might have\r\nbeen called into question on the score of taste, and in the hands\r\nof any but a fine artist might have easily been trivialised. The\r\nsubject was treated with marked dramatic ability and poetic dignity,\r\nand the production, passing from the comparative lightness of the\r\nfirst scene, into the more serious note of the second, attained\r\nto a high level of art in the patriotic symbolism of the third,\r\nand offered a tableau worthy the brush of any English painter of\r\nhistorical subjects. Since then we have seen “The Vine,” an Arcadian\r\ndance-idyll, invented, designed and supervised by Mr. C. Wilhelm,\r\nwhile it was produced, and the dances were arranged, by Mr. Fred\r\nFarren. It was superbly staged and proved one of the most original,\r\npicturesque and dramatic productions ever seen at the Empire. Miss\r\nPhyllis Bedell’s impersonation of the Spirit of the Vine seemed to\r\nhave in it something of Dionysiac fire and revealed her not only as\r\nan exquisite dancer, but a sensitive and temperamental actress. Miss\r\nCarlotta Mossetti, another singularly expressive and sympathetic\r\nmime, exhibited a sense of classic inspiration in her study of the\r\nyoung Shepherd tempted by the Vine-Spirit; excellent work also being\r\ndone by Miss Connie Walter as the Shepherd’s unhappy wife, and\r\n“Little June,” a lithe and clever little dancer, as the Spirit of\r\nthe Mountain Stream. The scenery, painted by Mr. R. C. McCleery;\r\nthe costumes, executed by Miss Hastings, were well in keeping with\r\nthe poetic character of the story, and the entire stage effect\r\nachieved formed an exquisite setting for the dancer-mimes who were to\r\ninterpret the dramatic little idyll.\r\n\r\nSo runs, in brief, the chronicle of ballet at the Empire, one which,\r\nif it is somewhat attenuated in later years by the increasing\r\nemphasis of that somewhat casual type of entertainment, the “Revue,”\r\nis nevertheless quite remarkable when one remembers that of the\r\nsixty or more ballets produced at the famous house in twenty-seven\r\nyears all were commercially as well as artistically successful, and\r\nthat the theatre has not received State-aid, as have the continental\r\nopera-houses where Ballet has been a staple attraction.\r\n\r\nThoughtless folk, who know little or nothing of the hard, unremitting\r\ntoil which goes to make a dancer, or of the artistic training,\r\nthought and feeling which go to make a designer or producer of\r\nballet, often speak lightly and slightingly of a type of theatrical\r\nproduction in which are blended colour, form, movement and music\r\ninto a balanced harmony of varied arts under the term the art of\r\nBallet. They rank it, usually, somewhere lower than Drama or Opera.\r\nBut the placing of a colour in a colour scheme requires quite as\r\ndelicate a taste as the placing of a word in a sentence, or a chord\r\nin a phrase of music; the introduction of a dancer or a group needs\r\njust as critical a care as the introduction of a character in a play\r\nor opera; and the telling of the story, albeit mutely mimed, may be\r\njust as dramatic in effect as in any verbal drama. The art of Ballet\r\nis a complex and beautiful art, at its best a very beautiful; and\r\nthose who are prone to dismiss it lightly as a thing that more or\r\nless occurs of itself, and is of slight account as a vehicle for the\r\ndeliberate expression of beauty, should rather feel proud to think\r\nthat at the Empire in London we have seen, in the course of a quarter\r\nof a century, Ballet of such artistic value as to place it among the\r\nfew real art influences of nineteenth and early twentieth-century\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nFINALE: THE RUSSIANS AND--THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is curious to recall the fact that a taste for dancing has always\r\nbeen a characteristic of the Londoners, who have supported really\r\nartistic ballet as often as they have had an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Elizabethan masques; the ballet dancers imported by Rich in the\r\nreign of Anne; and by Garrick, later; by Lumley at Her Majesty’s in\r\nthe ’forties; the native productions of Ballet at the Empire and\r\nAlhambra for over a quarter of a century; and, since, the importation\r\nof Russian ballet, first at various “vaudeville” theatres and then\r\nat Covent Garden and at Drury Lane, have all met with enthusiastic\r\nsupport, and the support has been as catholic as it has been cordial.\r\n\r\nDancers, of various schools, whether of the traditional ballet\r\n“school,” or otherwise, have quickly found their way into popular\r\nfavour. Looking back over theatrical memories of the past twenty\r\nyears or so, dance lovers will recall with pleasure seeing at the\r\nPalace Theatre that statuesque and extremely graceful dancer,\r\nMiss Mimi St. Cyr, in a delightful little miniature ballet, “La\r\nBaigneuse,” a dance-_scena_ invented by Mr. George R. Sims, in which\r\nshe lured to life the fountain-statue of a piping faun. Some will\r\nrecall also a dancer of very different school, Miss Lottie Collins,\r\nwhose “Tarrara-boom-de-ay” was a sensation in its way. Then, too, who\r\nthat saw her could ever forget that electric dancer hailing from\r\nAustralia, Mlle. Saharet, who entered as on the wings of a whirlwind\r\nand, seeming all compact of\r\n\r\n“Passion and power and pride incarnate in laughter,” held us all\r\nspellbound and breathless with sympathetic joy in her abounding\r\nvitality, stimulating and tonic as champagne.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times the sensational success of Miss Maud Allan--who\r\npresented us with the somewhat mystical definition of dancing as “the\r\nspontaneous expression of a spiritual state”; and, subsequently,\r\nof Mme. Pavlova and M. Mordkin; is too recent to need recalling,\r\nand too evident to call for specific praise from me when so many\r\nand abler pens have already exhausted their ink in regretting they\r\ncould not write in fire. Admirers, particularly feminine devotees,\r\nflocked in hundreds to see Miss Maud Allan dance in a manner which\r\nmany doubtless thought wholly new to London, though some might\r\nhave recalled that it was somewhat of the same school--though\r\ntemperamentally very different--as that of Miss Isadora Duncan, who\r\nhad given us dances of a rather similar order some ten years before,\r\nand that they were akin to the mimetic dances of ancient days.\r\n\r\nMiss Allan achieved a remarkable flexibility of movement that\r\nwas seen to advantage in her dances to the music of Chopin and\r\nother classic masters. Her interpretation of the “Spring Song” of\r\nMendelssohn was not wholly new to those who had seen Miss Isadora\r\nDuncan’s exposition of the same music some ten years before. Her\r\n“Salome,” a melodrama in dancing, created a sensation, though\r\nsomewhat morbid in effect, and hardly of the same artistic interest\r\nas some of her other achievements. Of her popularity there was no\r\ndoubt, and a photograph of one of the queues which awaited any\r\none of her performances, especially the _matinées_, would--if one\r\nexist--always be valuable to future historians of our time as a mute\r\nbut eloquent record.\r\n\r\nMme. Pavlova, who also first appeared at the Palace Theatre, is an\r\nextremely accomplished _danseuse_ who probably has not troubled, and\r\ncertainly has not _needed_ to trouble herself, about definitions of\r\nthe dance, for she belongs to a “school,” the basis of which was\r\ndefined a century or more ago, and she herself is one of its most\r\nrecent and perfect blossomings. Mons. Mordkin, nurtured by the same\r\nschool, is superb, and it was no wonder that the first appearance\r\nof these two artistes in their wonderful _pas de deux_, “L’Automne\r\nBacchanale,” should have fired some of our finest dramatic critics to\r\nexpressions of almost frenzied admiration and doubtless driven shoals\r\nof lesser men to the neighbourhood of Hanwell in despair at the\r\nimpossibility of finding suitable adjectives for the new wonder that\r\nhad come amongst us. One can only deplore the fact that the harmony\r\nwhich made possible the _pas de deux_ of the first season should\r\nhave been, even temporarily, broken, and permitted us only to enjoy\r\nthe work of both dancers subsequently in _pas seuls_, or in _pas de\r\ndeux_--with other partners.\r\n\r\nOne could hardly close a reference to the popular Palace--a reference\r\nnecessarily brief, as must be any concerning the various “vaudeville”\r\nhouses in a review covering so wide a field--without a passing word\r\nof grateful praise to that bevy of bright young dancers, the “Palace\r\nGirls.” As people of catholic enough taste to enjoy _all_ dancing\r\nthat is good in itself--from the vigorous cellar-flap of the street\r\nurchin to the aerial _pas_ of a Pavlova--we may agree that, in a\r\nsense, the Palace has been all the more attractive for the “Palace\r\nGirls.” Somehow the modern comedic spirit appears to express itself\r\nbest in short skirts, shapely legs and a jolly smile; and in their\r\ninsouciante charm, their neatness, agility, precision and _enfantine_\r\ngaiety, the “Palace Girls” always seemed to focalise the requirements\r\nof “vaudeville,” and symbolise the attractions of music-hall\r\nmodernity.\r\n\r\nThen, at the London Hippodrome, in many a Christmas entertainment,\r\ningeniously arranged and gorgeously staged, half pantomime, half\r\nballet, we have seen regular feasts of dancing and always with\r\nenjoyment. But apart from the spectacular productions for which the\r\nHippodrome early became famous, many a delightful solo dancer and\r\ndance-_scena_ have been viewed there. To have seen those exquisitely\r\ndainty artists, the Wiesenthal Sisters, is to have ineffaceable\r\nmemories of a stage-art that seems strangely enough to link up the\r\nclassic simplicity of ancient Greece with the Watteauesque artifice\r\nof the eighteenth century, and yet again the clear-seeing artistry,\r\nthe supreme and joyous colour-sense of latter day decorative art.\r\nThe tone and hue of their chosen background, the simple yet daring\r\ncolour-scheme of their dress, the thoughtful, almost dreamy, grace\r\nof their every pose and movement, the purely picture-like effect of\r\ntheir whole performance, summed up the modern spirit in art that\r\nis striving--perhaps as yet half-consciously--for a revolt from\r\nold methods and stereotyped traditions and for something simpler,\r\nclearer, more direct and, be it said, more beautiful and vital than\r\nwe have yet had; the art, in fact, of the men to come rather than the\r\nmen who have been, albeit it has drawn inspiration from the eternal\r\npast. The Wiesenthal Sisters were not mere “performers”; they were\r\npoems.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, at various houses, what other dancers have we seen of\r\nindividual distinction? Long remembered must be the sensation caused\r\nby Miss Loie Fuller on her first appearance in London some years\r\nago, as the introducer of a curious form of dance in which the stage\r\neffects she achieved were the paramount attraction. And what effects\r\nthey were--kaleidoscopic, magic, wonderful! Just a woman, with a\r\nbrain and shapely form, a mass of filmy draperies floated here and\r\nthere, on which were shed the splendour of changing coloured lights,\r\nso that she seemed now some wondrous butterfly, now like a mass of\r\ncloud suffused with the gold of dawn, now like a fountain of living\r\nflame! Yes, Loie Fuller should have been an artist! Should have? _Is_\r\nan artist, who has not painted pictures but has lived them.\r\n\r\nThen there was Miss Ruth St. Denis at the Scala--a vision of all\r\nthe poetry and the mystery of the East. Ruth St. Denis in an Indian\r\nmarket-place representing a snake-dance, making cobras of her\r\nflexible arms and hands! Ruth St. Denis as a Buddhist acolyte in the\r\njungle! Ruth St. Denis in a “Dance of the Senses,” so significantly\r\npoetic and full of strange allure. Always the glamour of the East,\r\nbut without its menace and without its vice; the East exalted and\r\naustere. Moreau himself might have envied her those dreams of form\r\nand colour she made manifest, and all who saw her surely must have\r\nrealised that Ruth St. Denis danced her lovely pictures as an artist\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nYet another artist of marked individuality and intellectual\r\ndistinction, Miss Isadora Duncan, was really the first to appear\r\nin London who showed any marked ability to break away from the\r\ntraditional schools of ballet and step-dancing, and, casting back\r\nto the days of ancient Greece, began deliberately to use posture\r\nand movement as a means of expressing poetic ideas. I first saw her\r\nat her London _début_, when she appeared in a performance of “A\r\nMidsummer Night’s Dream,” one of a series of Shakespearian revivals\r\nwhich Mr. F. R. Benson was giving--on February 22nd, 1900--at the old\r\nLyceum.\r\n\r\nShe had but lately arrived from America, and was fired with an\r\nenthusiasm for the graceful dance of classic days, an enthusiasm\r\nwhich found ample expression in her dance as a wood-nymph in a\r\nShakespearian production which I still remember as one of the most\r\nbeautiful I have seen. Shortly after Miss Duncan gave a special\r\n_matinée_ at the old St. George’s Hall entitled, “The Happier Age\r\nof Gold,” at which idylls of Theocritus, poems by Swinburne and\r\nother poets of classic inspiration, were recited to music and were\r\neither accompanied or followed by an appropriate dance designed\r\nand performed by Miss Duncan, who also set herself the task of\r\ninterpreting well-known musical _morceaux_ by means of a dance.\r\n\r\nOne of the items on her programme was Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song,”\r\nwhich received a thoroughly graceful and sympathetic interpretation.\r\nMiss Duncan has, of course, appeared in London frequently since then,\r\nand all dance-lovers will remember the extraordinary charm of the\r\nseries of _matinées_ which she gave at the Duke of York’s Theatre at\r\nwhich she introduced a number of child pupils. There has never been\r\nanything meretricious or pretentious about the work of Miss Isadora\r\nDuncan. It has always been marked by a sense of deep-rooted culture,\r\nclassic dignity and poetic charm, and to her, certainly, so far as\r\nLondon is concerned, belongs the credit of having first introduced a\r\nform of dancing which has only too often since been parodied under\r\nthe term of “classic dancing”; and even as she was the first, so, in\r\nmy humble judgment, she is the best and truest exponent of a school\r\nwhich is justified by the beauty of its results, and which is having,\r\nand is likely yet to have, far-reaching influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Dover St. Studios_\r\n\r\nMiss Isadora Duncan]\r\n\r\nThen again, the Coliseum, young as it is, has already created dance\r\ntraditions for itself, and of the best sort. Was it not there first\r\nof all that we were enchanted with the Russian ballet? They were not\r\nthe first Russian dancers seen in London, for Mlle. Kyasht and Mme.\r\nPavlova had preceded them; but they were the first collective example\r\nof Russian ballet from the Moscow and Petrograd Opera-Houses, and\r\nit was here we first saw Mme. Karsavina, one of the most supremely\r\nfinished and _élégante_ dancers it has been London’s good fortune\r\nto see. What lightness, what purity and dignity of style, what\r\nperfect execution and perfect ease, and what poetic charm!\r\n\r\nHer _variation_ in the “Sylphide” was a revelation of classic art of\r\nthe Taglioni school, and howsoever some may prefer one “school” to\r\nanother there must always be much to be said for a training which\r\nassists the evolution of such artists, for at least it is a sure\r\ntraining with sure and gracious results.\r\n\r\nThere is something in tradition when all it said and done, and one\r\nhas to remember that while even an iconoclastic “Futurist” cannot\r\nhelp creating tradition in attempting to do away with it, and while\r\npure ballet-dancing may not be the one and only kind which can\r\ngive delight, it must command the respect that is due to any art\r\nwhich respects its own traditions, and can produce such dancers as\r\nMme. Karsavina and those who were first associated with her at the\r\nColiseum.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we were to see at the same house, “Sumurun!” It was\r\nstrange indeed to think that a London audience could be held by some\r\nseven scenes of a play in which not a word was spoken; it was a _tour\r\nde force_ of the art of miming, but then also it was a revelation of\r\nthe art of stage effect. The decorative scheme, with its simple lines\r\nand ample space, was unlike anything that we had had before--unless\r\nperhaps in the nobler art of Mr. Gordon Craig--and the colour\r\nschemes, mostly of a curiously dry, cool note, were a pleasant change\r\nfrom the traditional attempts at a stage realism that is only too\r\noften too unreal.\r\n\r\nSince then too there was, of course, the appearance of that dainty\r\nDresden-china dancer, Mme. Karina in a graceful little dance-_scena_,\r\n“The Colour of Life,” the expressive music of which was by Miss\r\nDora Bright. Mme. Karina, another dancer who hails from Denmark,\r\nwon instant appreciation for the beauty of her work, and is indeed\r\nnotable for her precision, grace and distinction.\r\n\r\nYet again has Mlle. Adeline Génée made welcome reappearances at\r\nthe Coliseum, especially in “La Danse”--first produced, I believe,\r\nat the Metropolitan Opera House, New York--which formed a series\r\nof representations of the dances and dancers of the historic\r\npast--forming practically a collection of little cameos of the dance,\r\nhaving a distinct educational value and presenting a veritable\r\nre-creation of all the great stars of Ballet in the past, from Prévôt\r\nto Taglioni; in all of which the world-famous dancer exhibited the\r\nsame high qualities of artistry that she had ever done.\r\n\r\nBut among the many dance productions seen at this handsome house\r\nprobably the two most satisfactory judged as ballet were the\r\nproduction of Mr. Wilhelm’s “Camargo,” with Mlle. Génée in the\r\ntitle-_rôle_; and M. Kosloff’s production of “Scheherazade,” the two\r\nforming an outstanding contrast in one’s memory. The former, with\r\nthe quiet dignity, soft light and sumptuous stage embellishments\r\nof furniture and _décors_, and the dream-like quality assumed by\r\nthe characters in this rich and harmonious setting. One found in it\r\nsomething of that visionary quality which gave the peculiar charm\r\nto the “Versailles” production which I spoke of in referring to the\r\nEmpire. The music and the acting were so expressive that one did not\r\nmiss the words, and yet half-consciously one knew they were not there\r\njust because of the dream-like atmosphere which the music itself so\r\nhelped to create.\r\n\r\nThe royal grace and dignity of Louis-Quinze, the butterfly vivacity\r\nof Camargo herself, and the more vital and quieter actions of her\r\nyoung soldier friend for whose misdeeds she pleads for pardon from\r\nthe King, were all but dream figures in a dream, and it was as if\r\nthe veil of the past had been suddenly drawn aside and one had a\r\nglimpse of a century seen through the half light of early dawn. Once\r\nmore Mlle. Génée excelled herself in doing apparently impossible\r\nthings with consummate ease, and once more one was glad to welcome\r\nthe sensitive, expressive and scholarly work of so accomplished a\r\nmusician as Miss Dora Bright.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of the cool and dream-like quality, however,\r\nabout Mons. Kosloff’s “Scheherazade.” Exotic, bizarre, palpitant\r\nwith warmth and colour, the production stormed the imagination with\r\nits extravagance of hue and tone, even as the tangled rhythms and\r\nseductive melodies of the music captured the hearing and through it\r\nsubdued the mind to a sort of dazzled wonder. It was a stupendous\r\nachievement, the more so in that it was brief.\r\n\r\nAt various times and at various places we have seen in London during\r\nthe past ten years or so every form of dance and ballet it would\r\nseem could possibly exist. “Sand” dances; “Buck” dances; “Hypnotic”\r\ndances; “Salome” dances; “Vampire” dances; “Apache,” “Classic,”\r\n“Viennese,” Turkish, Egyptian, Russian, “Inspirational” dancers, and\r\neven English ballet-dancers in an all-British ballet once at the\r\nhandsome Palladium; and also at the Court and Savoy, where Stedman\r\nstaged some delightful ballets performed, under the direction of Miss\r\nLilian Leoffeler and Mr. Marshall Moore, by English dancers. Not only\r\nat the regular vaudeville houses and theatres, however, is to be\r\nfound genuine appreciation of the British dance and dancer. Elsewhere\r\nan English school of dance has been founded, and that in a form for\r\nwhich the English nation was famous in Shakespeare’s time.\r\n\r\nHenley made his plea for “Gigues, Gavottes and Minuets,” but there\r\nare many other lovely, or lovelier, examples of old-world dance to\r\nold-world music, which scholarship has revived and good taste has\r\nbeen eagerly accepting wherever they were seen--_Pavane_, _Chaconne_,\r\n_Coranto_, _Galliard_, _Bourrée_, _Rigaudon_, _Passepied_, and\r\n_Sarabande_. These, and other ancient dances, were, as we know, the\r\ndelight of the Courts of Queen Elizabeth, of Charles II, of Anne,\r\nof Louis-Quatorze--_le Grand Monarque_, of Louis-Seize and Marie\r\nAntoinette. Many have been revived and performed to the music of\r\nthe harpsichord, violin, viola, viole-d’amour, and ’cello; and the\r\ncurious thing--or, rather, interesting thing, for it really is not\r\nstrange--is that both to scholars and to those unlearned in their\r\nhistory, to cultured townsman or woman, and to country lad and lass,\r\nto bored frequenters of the West End drawing-room, and to those who\r\nfind only in their dreams relief from the sordidness of an East End\r\nenvironment, this old-world dance and music make an instant appeal.\r\n\r\nI saw this put to the test once when, at a hall in the somewhat dingy\r\nneighbourhood of Bethnal Green, a performance of the “Ancient Music\r\nand Dances,” arranged by Miss Nellie Chaplin, was received by an\r\naudience of East End work-people with such whole-hearted enthusiasm\r\nthat practically every item in a programme often performed in West\r\nEnd drawing-rooms and at Queen’s and Albert Halls, as well as at\r\nLiverpool and Manchester, Guildford, Oxford and elsewhere, was\r\nencored, and several were doubly and trebly so.\r\n\r\nA Galliard of the seventeenth century, an Allemande by an English\r\ncomposer, Robert Johnson (1540-1626), Handel’s Oboe Concerto (1734),\r\na Sarabande by Destouches (1672), “Lady Elizabeth Spencer’s Minuet”\r\nperformed at Blenheim in 1788--all these and other historically\r\ninteresting items were encored by the audience, not because of\r\ntheir historic interest, but simply because of their joyousness and\r\ncharm; while a _bourrée_ by Mouret (1742), and the fascinating Old\r\nEnglish dance, “Once I loved a maiden fair” (one of a group including\r\n“Althea,” “Lord of Carnarvon’s Jig,” and Stanes’ Morris-dance) had\r\nto be given three times. This was all complimentary, of course, to\r\nthe beautiful way in which the dances and music were performed; but\r\nit was an interesting revelation of the eternal appeal to humanity,\r\nwhatsoever the degree of caste or wealth, of the really good thing in\r\nart, and certainly the centuries are bridged with ease by the charm\r\nand joyousness of these old-time dances to their appropriate music,\r\nseen and heard more recently and to such advantage amid congenial\r\nenvironment in “Shakespeare’s England” at Earl’s Court.\r\n\r\nVeritably we seem to have seen every known form of dance and type of\r\ndancer in London during the past twenty years or so, and latterly we\r\nhave had at the Royal Opera-House, and, since, at Drury Lane, such a\r\nfestival of ballet as has not been seen in England since the ’forties\r\nof last century, for here we have seen a galaxy of dancers from the\r\ntwo great opera-houses of Russia, that of the Mariensky at Petrograd,\r\nand that of the great theatre in Moscow, where the traditional\r\ntraining for ballet has been kept up and infused with a new artistic\r\nspirit such as is hardly to be found in any other continental\r\nopera-house.\r\n\r\nEarly in last century Carlo Blasis brought the Milan school to\r\nperfection, and thence went teachers to Paris, Vienna, Dresden,\r\nMoscow, Petrograd, wherever they went carrying something of the\r\nartistic spirit and culture of their master, one of the most\r\nversatile _maîtres de ballet_ there has ever been, for there seems to\r\nhave been scarcely an art of which he did not know something, and of\r\nwhich he could not say something worth hearing.\r\n\r\nBut since those days probably nowhere quite as in Russia has the\r\nballet moved with the times and been so imbued with the new artistic\r\nspirit which has been at work within the past generation.\r\n\r\nPainter, musician, poet, dramatist, and _maître de ballet_, are\r\ncalled upon to produce the homogeneous and individual spectacle which\r\nwe call the Russian ballet.\r\n\r\nOne has to recall but a few examples from the Russian _répertoire_ to\r\nnote with what serious artistic purpose the art of Ballet is studied\r\nby the representatives of the best school. Glazounov’s “Cleopatra,” a\r\n“mimodrame” in one act; “Les Sylphides,” a _rêverie romantique_, the\r\nmusic by Chopin; Schumann’s exquisitely whimsical “Le Carnaval,” made\r\ninto a pantomime-ballet in one act; “Le Dieu Bleu,” by that curiously\r\ninteresting and _rêveur_ composer Reynaldo Hahn. These are among\r\nthe productions which, ranging over classic, poetic and romantic\r\nsubjects, would veritably have appealed to such artists of the\r\nBallet as Rameau, Noverre, Gardel and Blasis, not to mention other\r\n_maîtres_ of more recent times. And what dancers to interpret them!\r\nM. Nijinsky, perhaps the best male dancer of our time, so good that\r\none’s usual objection to the male dancer melted into admiration: Mme.\r\nKarsavina, Mlles. Sophie Fedorova and Ludmilla Schollar were among\r\nthe _danseuses_ who had been seen in London previously, and were\r\neach in their degree remarkable not only as dancers but as brilliant\r\nmimes. There was not one among the extensive and interesting cast who\r\nwas not of Russia’s best, the best that is that can come from the\r\nschool where the traditional art of Ballet is understood not to be\r\nthe result of a mere few lessons in “dancing,” but the result of a\r\nstudy also of all that is best in the traditions of art and music and\r\nliterature, from all of which the art of Ballet draws its inspiration.\r\n\r\nYet again, one must pay tribute to the Russian artists on their\r\nmasterly sense of stage effect, and for that supreme sense of what\r\nthe ballet should be, namely, a harmony of the arts. One has but to\r\ncontrast three such productions as “Les Sylphides,” “Cleopatra,” and\r\nSchumann’s “Carnaval,” to see a revelation of stage artistry which\r\nput to shame the conventionality which, save in rare instances--and\r\nin English ballet--had characterised the London stage so long.\r\n\r\nIn “Les Sylphides” we had the very essence of that spirit of\r\nromanticism in which cultured Europe was revelling during the\r\n’twenties and the ’thirties of last century, a spirit which found\r\nexpression in depicting the wildness and grandeur of mountain\r\nscenery, in the cloud-like fantasies of Shelley, in the poignant\r\nintensity of Byronic passion, and the romantic glamour of Spanish and\r\nGerman legend.\r\n\r\nIn “Cleopatra” we had a glimpse of the pride and passion of an\r\nimperious Queen, ruling over a nation whose own passions were but\r\nsubdued by tyranny, in a land where earth itself seemed satiated\r\nwith the fructifying influence of water and a burning sun. From the\r\nfirst moment to the last the stage was in a glow, and a red thread of\r\ntragedy deepened to a climax of despair.\r\n\r\nWhat a change to turn from such a production to the whimsies, romance\r\nand fantasy of such a thing as Schumann’s “Carnaval!” Here was the\r\nobverse of the romanticism of “Les Sylphides”; the undercurrent of\r\nmockery and poetic cynicism so characteristic of Schumann’s own music\r\nin its lighter moods, characteristic of Heine and of de Musset. Here\r\nagain one found a masterly idea in the audacious simplicity of the\r\nstage setting. To see the great stage of Covent Garden decorated\r\nwith long curtains and two sofas of the truly early-Victorian\r\npattern--stiff, prim, unyielding, and covered with striped repp--was\r\na thing to take one’s breath away, until, as the music began, little\r\nfigure after little figure slipped, like figures in a dream, between\r\nthe curtains: Pierrot, Pierrette, Harlequin--little men and women of\r\nthe ’thirties mingling with these eternal characters of drama, to\r\nmake a series of pictures of wooings and repulses, of meetings and\r\npartings, of provocations and denials, revealing the comedy of life,\r\nseen as it were in a glass “not darkly,” but as a dream far off and\r\nmistily; eminently unreal; yet, in some other world far, far away,\r\nin some mysterious land of dreams, one felt such things perchance\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\n“Le Sacre du Printemps” was an ambitious attempt at primitivism--if\r\none may use the word--but while disliking its suggestion of\r\nmegalomania and the formlessness of its decoration, one could not\r\nbut admire so audacious an endeavour to break wholly with tradition;\r\nand it was redeemed by the virility and fantastic, mocking humour\r\nand scenic splendour of Rimsky-Korsakov and Michel Fokine’s “Le Coq\r\nd’Or,” and still more by the beauty of Leon Bakst and Tcherepinin’s\r\n“Narcisse,” and the poetic charm of “Le Spectre de la Rose.”\r\n\r\nThese, however, are but brief impressions of recent pleasures, shared\r\nby many others who may have been differently impressed. We have had\r\nmany books and articles on the Russian ballet--some perhaps a little\r\nover-enthusiastic--and it is not my purpose to deal extensively with\r\nhistory so recent that most readers can as readily give account\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, the significant fact remaining is--that at this\r\nend of the history of an art some two thousand years old we find\r\nmost recently in popular favour not English ballet as it was in the\r\nsixteenth-century days of the essentially English Masque; not French\r\nas it was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; not Italian,\r\nas it was in the ’forties of last century; nor English as we have\r\nseen it, at its best, at the Empire and Alhambra in the past quarter\r\nof a century; but the Russian ballet! the balance of the arts;\r\nwhich the Russians have only been able to do _by sheer technical\r\nefficiency_--quite apart from ideas or ideals expressed--in _all_\r\nthe arts of which ballet is composed, and which has enabled them to\r\ndo exactly that which they have set out to do. That, perhaps, is the\r\none thing that Russian ballet has shown us, which is of the greatest\r\nvalue and significance for any lovers of the art in any capital of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _E. O. Hoppé_\r\n\r\nMme. Karsavina and M. Adolf Bolm in “L’Oiseau de Feu”]\r\n\r\nOne may ask, however, what is the position of England in regard not\r\nonly to ballet, but to the other arts? We have State, and County\r\nCouncil Art and Craft schools; we have the Royal Academy of Music,\r\nthe Royal College, the Guildhall School, and numerous private schools\r\nand “academies” where music and the dramatic arts are taught; all\r\nadmirable as far as they go. We have, as yet, no State-aided theatre\r\nand no State-aided opera-house, to which, as on the Continent, an\r\nacademy for the study of the dance and ballet is attached. Is it not\r\nstrange that the richest city in the world should be deficient in\r\nthese things?\r\n\r\nIt may be that there is greater vitality in the arts when they are\r\npursued only under the conditions of competitive, private enterprise;\r\nbut it is curious that in practically every other country the\r\ndramatic arts have been fostered by the State, and that we in this\r\ncountry seem ever to show a greater welcome to foreign singers and\r\ndancers than we do to our own.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, always a great danger that an institution,\r\nsecure in the support it receives from the State, may become\r\nconventional; the spirit of its art may grow arid and unprofitable,\r\nbut at least it ensures a standard of technical efficiency, and, if\r\nthere be a vital spirit in the nation, that spirit will show itself\r\nin the work of such an institution. Russia has proved all this.\r\n\r\nGiven a National Opera-House, to which were attached a Royal Academy\r\nof Dancing, what might the future of Ballet be in this country?\r\n\r\nThe answer depends mainly, one feels, on the extent of the\r\npossibilities to which the art of Ballet could be realised by those\r\nwho lead in the artistic expression of the national spirit. The poet,\r\nthe artist, the musician, the Master of Dance, and the dancers--men\r\nand women--realising the possibilities of the composite art of\r\nBallet, might foreshadow possibilities greater than any we have\r\nseen. Yet greater possibilities might be foreshadowed of one who was\r\nall these things; and could combine (as Mr. Gordon Craig would have\r\nthe master of the Art of the Theatre combine) _all_ the arts of the\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that now and then, through lack of technical efficiency\r\nin one or other of the arts which go to the making of ballet, that\r\nballet itself has not always attained its highest possible level in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut without that basic technical efficiency in the living material\r\nwhich he manipulates, how can the creator of the ballet express\r\nhimself? A standard of technique at least should exist. That given,\r\nwhat might not yet be done with this art, which history shows\r\nhas always been so plastic in the hands of the master-artist, so\r\nresponsive to the artistic or national moods of the people among whom\r\nit has been found.\r\n\r\nIt has the value and significance of painting, together with the\r\nvital and impressive effect of drama. It is not the art of depicting\r\nreality; but the art of pictorial suggestion, giving life and form to\r\npoetic ideas.\r\n\r\nAt the Royal or Ducal Courts of earlier days the compliment to\r\nmonarch or to minister would be conveyed by means of a courtly\r\nballet, the story of which dealt outwardly perhaps only with the\r\ndoings of some mythic hero of the classic past. But the art of Ballet\r\nalways had greater possibilities than courtly compliment, in that it\r\nis always a plastic vehicle for the expression of all ideas; and,\r\ngiven the standard of efficiency which makes production possible\r\nat all, it only becomes a question of what theme shall be treated\r\nby this means rather than by the arts of painting, or of music, or\r\ndrama, or of literature.\r\n\r\nOn these two points--the standard of technical efficiency attained\r\nby those associated in the production of ballet, and on the choice\r\nof theme and manner of treatment by the artist-mind ultimately\r\nresponsible for the production, depends the whole future of the art\r\nof Ballet. The spirit of the artist and his means of expression;\r\nthere lies the future.\r\n\r\nWhat shall be the technique of ballet, and to what extent shall it be\r\ninfluenced by that of the dance?\r\n\r\nTo-day, the forms of dancing are various, but there are three main\r\ndivisions: first, all popular forms of “step,” or, to adopt an old\r\nand useful term, “toe-and-heel” dancing; secondly, the traditional\r\n“toe”-dancing of classic ballet, capable of every _nuance_ of\r\nexpression; and thirdly, the various forms of rhythmic movement\r\nand effects of poise, which seem to approach nearly to the ancient\r\nHellenic ideal of the Dance, and of which Miss Isadora Duncan was\r\nperhaps the first exponent in England, as Mrs. Roger Watts is the\r\nlatest; while yet another phase of the same ideal is seen in the\r\nEurhythmic system of Jacques Dalcroze, which has had, and will have,\r\ngreat influence in many directions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen on the London stage ballets in which the dancing was\r\nalmost wholly “step”-dancing, toe-and-heel--such as “On the Heath,”\r\nat the Alhambra; we have seen numberless ballets in which the\r\ntraditional “toe”-dancing was paramount, from “Coppélia” to “Roberto\r\nil Diavolo,” or the later productions of the Russians; we have not\r\nyet seen a ballet composed entirely, or even mainly on the lines of\r\nthe Hellenic revival, though we have had hints of it in concerted\r\ndances by pupils of Miss Duncan and others, and the complete thing\r\nmay yet come, though, personally, I question the advisability. We\r\nhave already had some curious, interesting, and not quite illogical\r\nattempts to suggest scenic effect by means of living people\r\nperforming appropriate and rhythmic movements, as in the production\r\nof Mr. Reginald Buckley’s poetic drama “King Arthur.”\r\n\r\nIn one or other of these three divisions of the dance and the\r\nrespective technical advance in each, lie the chief means of artistic\r\nexpression for the master of ballet in the future, and it may be that\r\nthe traditional “ballet”-dancing, with its marvellous flexibility\r\nof expression, will, so long as the present standard of technique\r\nis sustained, always maintain its supremacy over the purely popular\r\nforms of dancing, and the newer modes of rhythmic movement and\r\ngesture. It has at least stood the test of time, as a definite and\r\nlogical medium of artistic expression.\r\n\r\nAs to the master-mind that is to select one or other of these forms\r\nof the Dance, and combine it with miming, music and scenic effect to\r\nachieve a ballet that shall be the medium of ideas, worthy to range\r\nas a work of art alongside the tried masterpieces of painting, music,\r\ndrama or literature, it may be questioned if we shall see anything\r\nworthier than the past has given us at its best. Some new Noverre or\r\nBlasis, Wilhelm or Fokine may yet arise, of course; but until such\r\na one come forth we may be well content with the standard which the\r\nPast has managed to achieve.\r\n\r\nTo that standard this volume is a willing tribute; a faithful\r\nrecord, which may have novelty for some, unaware of days before\r\ntheir time; while for others, whose memory of more recent--but yet\r\nreceding!--events, grows dim, it may come as a friendly reminder of\r\npleasant hours spent, by writer and by reader, in contemplating from\r\nthe auditorium the varied examples seen at London theatres of the\r\nprotean Art of Ballet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adam, Adolphe, composer, 236, 277\r\n\r\n  Addison, Joseph, 142-147\r\n\r\n  Ænea, dancer, 259, 279\r\n\r\n  Æschylus, 25, 37\r\n\r\n  Agoust, Louise, dancer, 264\r\n\r\n  Aguzzi, Mlle., dancer, 276\r\n\r\n  Albert, Ferdinand, dancer, 209\r\n\r\n  Albert, Paul, dancer, 209\r\n\r\n  Albertieri, Luigi, dancer, 279, 280\r\n\r\n  Albery, James, dramatist, 257\r\n\r\n  Alembert, Jean le Rond d’, 171\r\n\r\n  Alençon, Emilienne d’, dancer, 266\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Appius, 85\r\n\r\n  Alhambra, 249, 252-275, 308\r\n\r\n  Alias, M. et Mme., costumiers, 257, 259, 260, 264, 265, 271-273, 276\r\n\r\n  Allan, Maud, dancer, 274, 310\r\n\r\n  Allard, Marie, actress and dancer, 168, 203\r\n\r\n  Allemande (Almain) dance, 68, 74, 115;\r\n    by Robert Johnson, 317\r\n\r\n  Almonti, brothers, dancers, 262, 263, 265\r\n\r\n  Anderson, Percy, designer of costumes, 279\r\n\r\n  André, dancer, 109\r\n\r\n  Angiolini, pupil of Noverre, 213\r\n\r\n  Anka, Cornélie d’, singer, 255, 257\r\n\r\n  Arbeau, Thoinot, author of _Orchésographie_, 1588, 60-70, 110,\r\n        145\r\n\r\n  Arlequin. _See_ Harlequin\r\n\r\n  Arnould, Sophie, dancer, 179, 180\r\n\r\n  Arundale, Grace, dancer, 265\r\n\r\n  Arundale, Sybil, dancer, 265\r\n\r\n  _Atellanæ_, 43\r\n\r\n  Athenæus, quoted, 23\r\n\r\n  Auber, D.
