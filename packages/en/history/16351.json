GILSON COMPANY\r\nBOSTON, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present work places before the public a phase of the\r\nprofessional activity of Edward MacDowell quite different from\r\nthat through which his name became a household word in musical\r\ncircles, that is, his work as a composer. In the chapters\r\nthat follow we become acquainted with him in the capacity of\r\na writer on phases of the history and aesthetics of music.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1896 that the authorities of Columbia University\r\noffered to him the newly created Chair of Music, for which he\r\nhad been strongly recommended as one of the leading composers\r\nof America. After much thought he accepted the position, and\r\nentered upon his duties with the hope of accomplishing much for\r\nhis art in the favorable environment which he fully expected\r\nto find. The aim of the instruction, as he planned it, was:\r\n\"First, to teach music scientifically and technically, with a\r\nview to training musicians who shall be competent to teach and\r\ncompose. Second, to treat music historically and aesthetically\r\nas an element of liberal culture.\" In carrying out his plans he\r\nconducted a course, which, while \"outlining the purely technical\r\nside of music,\" was intended to give a \"general idea of music\r\nfrom its historical and aesthetic side.\" Supplementing this,\r\nas an advanced course, he also gave one which took up the\r\ndevelopment of musical forms, piano music, modern orchestration\r\nand symphonic forms, impressionism, the relationship of music\r\nto the other arts, with much other material necessary to form\r\nan adequate basis for music criticism.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for sincere regret that Mr. MacDowell put in\r\npermanent form only a portion of the lectures prepared for\r\nthe two courses just mentioned. While some were read from\r\nmanuscript, others were given from notes and illustrated with\r\nmusical quotations. This was the case, very largely, with\r\nthe lectures prepared for the advanced course, which included\r\nextremely valuable and individual treatment of the subject of\r\nthe piano, its literature and composers, modern music, etc.\r\n\r\nA point of view which the lecturer brought to bear upon his\r\nsubject was that of a composer to whom there were no secrets\r\nas to the processes by which music is made. It was possible\r\nfor him to enter into the spirit in which the composers both\r\nof the earlier and later periods conceived their works, and\r\nto value the completed compositions according to the way in\r\nwhich he found that they had followed the canons of the best\r\nand purest art. It is this unique attitude which makes the\r\nlectures so valuable to the musician as well as to the student.\r\n\r\nThe Editor would also call attention to the intellectual\r\nqualities of Mr. MacDowell, which determined his attitude\r\ntoward any subject. He was a poet who chose to express himself\r\nthrough the medium of music rather than in some other way. For\r\nexample, he had great natural facility in the use of the\r\npencil and the brush, and was strongly advised to take up\r\npainting as a career. The volume of his poetical writings,\r\nissued several years ago, is proof of his power of expression\r\nin verse and lyric forms. Above these and animating them\r\nwere what Mr. Lawrence Gilman terms \"his uncommon faculties\r\nof vision and imagination.\" What he thought, what he said,\r\nwhat he wrote, was determined by the poet's point of view,\r\nand this is evident on nearly every page of these lectures.\r\n\r\nHe was a wide reader, one who, from natural bent, dipped into\r\nthe curious and out-of-the-way corners of literature, as will\r\nbe noticed in his references to other works in the course\r\nof the lectures, particularly to Rowbotham's picturesque and\r\nfascinating story of the formative period of music. Withal he\r\nwas always in touch with contemporary affairs. With the true\r\noutlook of the poet he was fearless, individual, and even\r\nradical in his views. This spirit, as indicated before, he\r\ncarried into his lectures, for he demanded of his pupils that\r\nabove all they should be prepared to do their own thinking and\r\nreach their own conclusions. He was accustomed to say that we\r\nneed in the United States, a public that shall be independent\r\nin its judgment on art and art products, that shall not be tied\r\ndown to verdicts based on tradition and convention, but shall be\r\nprepared to reach conclusions through knowledge and sincerity.\r\n\r\nThat these lectures may aid in this splendid educational\r\npurpose is the wish of those who are responsible for placing\r\nthem before the public.\r\n\r\n                                                   W.J.

A much more plausible explanation, it seems to me, is\r\nto be found in the theory of Theophrastus, in which the origin\r\nof music is attributed to the whole range of human emotion.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal utters a cry of joy or pain it expresses its\r\nemotions in more or less definite tones; and at some remote\r\nperiod of the earth's history all primeval mankind must have\r\nexpressed its emotions in much the same manner. When this\r\ninarticulate speech developed into the use of certain sounds as\r\nsymbols for emotions--emotions that otherwise would have been\r\nexpressed by the natural sounds occasioned by them--then we have\r\nthe beginnings of speech as distinguished from music, which\r\nis still the universal language. In other words, intellectual\r\ndevelopment begins with articulate speech, leaving music for\r\nthe expression of the emotions.\r\n\r\nTo symbolize the sounds used to express emotion, if I may so\r\nput it, is to weaken that expression, and it would naturally\r\nbe the strongest emotion that would first feel the inadequacy\r\nof the new-found speech. Now what is mankind's strongest\r\nemotion? Even in the nineteenth century Goethe could say, \"'Tis\r\nfear that constitutes the god-like in man.\" Certainly before\r\nthe Christian era the soul of mankind had its roots in fear.\r\nIn our superstition we were like children beneath a great tree\r\nof which the upper part was as a vague and fascinating mystery,\r\nbut the roots holding it firmly to the ground were tangible,\r\npalpable facts. We feared--we knew not what. Love was human,\r\nall the other emotions were human; fear alone was indefinable.\r\n\r\nThe primeval savage, looking at the world subjectively, was\r\nmerely part of it. He might love, hate, threaten, kill, if he\r\nwilled; every other creature could do the same. But the wind\r\nwas a great spirit to him; lightning and thunder threatened him\r\nas they did the rest of the world; the flood would destroy him\r\nas ruthlessly as it tore the trees asunder. The elements were\r\nanimate powers that had nothing in common with him; for what\r\nthe intellect cannot explain the imagination magnifies.\r\n\r\nFear, then, was the strongest emotion. Therefore auxiliary aids\r\nto express and cause fear were necessary when the speech symbols\r\nfor fear, drifting further and further away from expressing the\r\nactual thing, became words, and words were inadequate to express\r\nand cause fear. In that vague groping for sound symbols which\r\nwould cause and express fear far better than mere words, we\r\nhave the beginning of what is gradually to develop into music.\r\n\r\nWe all know that savage nations accompany their dances by\r\nstriking one object with another, sometimes by a clanking of\r\nstones, the pounding of wood, or perhaps the clashing of stone\r\nspearheads against wooden shields (a custom which extended until\r\nthe time when shields and spears were discarded), meaning thus\r\nto express something that words cannot. This meaning changed\r\nnaturally from its original one of being the simple expression\r\nof fear to that of welcoming a chieftain; and, if one wishes\r\nto push the theory to excess, we may still see a shadowy\r\nreminiscence of it in the manner in which the violinists of\r\nan orchestra applaud an honoured guest--perchance some famous\r\nvirtuoso--at one of our symphony concerts by striking the\r\nbacks of their violins with their bows.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the savages. While this clashing of one object\r\nagainst another could not be called the beginning of music, and\r\nwhile it could not be said to originate a musical instrument,\r\nit did, nevertheless, bring into existence music's greatest\r\nprop, rhythm, an ally without which music would seem to be\r\nimpossible. It is hardly necessary to go into this point in\r\ndetail. Suffice it to say that the sense of rhythm is highly\r\ndeveloped even among those savage tribes which stand the\r\nlowest in the scale of civilization to-day, for instance,\r\nthe Andaman Islanders, of whom I shall speak later; the same\r\nmay be said of the Tierra del Fuegians and the now extinct\r\naborigines of Tasmania; it is the same with the Semangs of\r\nthe Malay Peninsula, the Ajitas of the Philippines, and the\r\nsavages inhabiting the interior of Borneo.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, this more or less rhythmic clanking of stones\r\ntogether, the striking of wooden paddles against the side of\r\na canoe, or the clashing of stone spearheads against wooden\r\nshields, could not constitute the first musical instrument. But\r\nwhen some savage first struck a hollow tree and found that\r\nit gave forth a sound peculiar to itself, when he found a\r\nhollow log and filled up the open ends, first with wood,\r\nand then--possibly getting the idea from his hide-covered\r\nshield--stretched skins across the two open ends, then he had\r\ncompleted the first musical instrument known to man, namely,\r\nthe drum. And such as it was then, so is it now, with but\r\nfew modifications.\r\n\r\nUp to this point it is reasonable to assume that primeval man\r\nlooked upon the world purely subjectively. He considered himself\r\nmerely a unit in the world, and felt on a plane with the other\r\ncreatures inhabiting it. But from the moment he had invented the\r\nfirst musical instrument, the drum, he had created something\r\noutside of nature, a voice that to himself and to all other\r\nliving creatures was intangible, an idol that spoke when it\r\nwas touched, something that he could call into life, something\r\nthat shared the supernatural in common with the elements. A\r\nGod had come to live with man, and thus was unfolded the\r\nfirst leaf in that noble tree of life which we call religion.\r\nMan now began to feel himself something apart from the world,\r\nand to look at it objectively instead of subjectively.\r\n\r\nTo treat primitive mankind as a type, to put it under one head,\r\nto make one theorem cover all mankind, as it were, seems almost\r\nan unwarranted boldness. But I think it is warranted when we\r\nconsider that, aside from language, music is the very first\r\nsign of the dawn of civilization. There is even the most\r\nconvincingly direct testimony in its favour. For instance:\r\n\r\nIn the Bay of Bengal, about six hundred miles from the Hoogly\r\nmouth of the Ganges, lie the Andaman Islands. The savages\r\ninhabiting these islands have the unenviable reputation\r\nof being, in common with several other tribes, the nearest\r\napproach to primeval man in existence. These islands and their\r\ninhabitants have been known and feared since time immemorial;\r\nour old friend Sinbad the Sailor, of \"Arabian Nights\" fame,\r\nundoubtedly touched there on one of his voyages. These savages\r\nhave no religion whatever, except the vaguest superstition,\r\nin other words, fear, and they have no musical instruments\r\nof any kind. They have reached only the _rhythm_ stage, and\r\naccompany such dances as they have by clapping their hands\r\nor by stamping on the ground. Let us now look to Patagonia,\r\nsome thousands of miles distant. The Tierra del Fuegians have\r\nprecisely the same characteristics, no religion, and no musical\r\ninstruments of any kind. Retracing our steps to the Antipodes\r\nwe find among the Weddahs or \"wild hunters\" of Ceylon exactly\r\nthe same state of things. The same description applies without\r\ndistinction equally well to the natives in the interior of\r\nBorneo, to the Semangs of the Malay Peninsula, and to the now\r\nextinct aborigines of Tasmania. According to Virchow their\r\ndance is demon worship of a purely anthropomorphic character;\r\nno musical instrument of any kind was known to them. Even\r\nthe simple expression of emotions by the voice, which we have\r\nseen is its most primitive medium, has not been replaced to\r\nany extent among these races since their discovery of speech,\r\nfor the Tierra del Fuegians, Andamans, and Weddahs have but\r\none sound to represent emotion, namely, a cry to express joy;\r\nhaving no other means for the expression of sorrow, they paint\r\nthemselves when mourning.\r\n\r\nIt is granted that all this, in itself, is not conclusive;\r\nbut it will be found that no matter in what wilderness one\r\nmay hear of a savage beating a drum, there also will be a\r\nwell-defined religion.\r\n\r\nProofs of the theory that the drum antedates all other musical\r\ninstruments are to be found on every hand. For wherever in the\r\nanthropological history of the world we hear of the trumpet,\r\nhorn, flute, or other instrument of the pipe species, it will\r\nbe found that the drum and its derivatives were already well\r\nknown. The same may be said of the lyre species of instrument,\r\nthe forerunner of our guitar (_kithara_), _tebuni_ or Egyptian\r\nharp, and generally all stringed instruments, with this\r\ndifference, namely, that wherever the lyre species was known,\r\nboth pipe and drum had preceded it. We never find the lyre\r\nwithout the drum, or the pipe without the drum; neither do we\r\nfind the lyre and the drum without the pipe. On the other hand,\r\nwe often find the drum alone, or the drum and pipe without\r\nthe lyre. This certainly proves the antiquity of the drum and\r\nits derivatives.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the purely rhythmical nature of the pre-drum\r\nperiod, and pointed out, in contrast, the musical quality of\r\nthe drum. This may seem somewhat strange, accustomed as we are\r\nto think of the drum as a purely rhythmical instrument. The\r\nsounds given out by it seem at best vague in tone and more\r\nor less uniform in quality. We forget that all instruments\r\nof percussion, as they are called, are direct descendants of\r\nthe drum. The bells that hang in our church towers are but\r\nmodifications of the drum; for what is a bell but a metal drum\r\nwith one end left open and the drum stick hung inside?\r\n\r\nStrange to say, as showing the marvellous potency of primeval\r\ninstincts, bells placed in church towers were supposed to\r\nhave much of the supernatural power that the savage in his\r\nwilderness ascribed to the drum. We all know something of the\r\nbell legends of the Middle Ages, how the tolling of a bell was\r\nsupposed to clear the air of the plague, to calm the storm, and\r\nto shed a blessing on all who heard it. And this superstition\r\nwas to a certain extent ratified by the religious ceremonies\r\nattending the casting of church bells and the inscriptions\r\nmoulded in them. For instance, the mid-day bell of Strasburg,\r\ntaken down during the French Revolution, bore the motto\r\n\r\n   \"I am the voice of life.\"\r\n\r\nAnother one in Strasburg:\r\n\r\n   \"I ring out the bad, ring in the good.\"\r\n\r\nOthers read\r\n\r\n   \"My voice on high dispels the storm.\"\r\n\r\n   \"I am called Ave Maria\r\n    I drive away storms.\"\r\n\r\n   \"I who call to thee am the Rose of the World and am called\r\n          Ave Maria.\"\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian _sistrum_, which in Roman times played an\r\nimportant role in the worship of Isis, was shaped somewhat\r\nlike a tennis racquet, with four wire strings on which rattles\r\nwere strung. The sound of it must have been akin to that of our\r\nmodern tambourine, and it served much the same purpose as the\r\nprimitive drum, namely, to drive away Typhon or Set, the god\r\nof evil. Dead kings were called \"Osiris\" when placed in their\r\ntombs, and _sistri_ put with them in order to drive away Set.\r\n\r\nBeside bells and rattles we must include all instruments of the\r\ntambourine and gong species in the drum category. While there\r\nare many different forms of the same instrument, there are\r\nevidences of their all having at some time served the same\r\npurpose, even down to that strange instrument about which\r\nDu Chaillu tells us in his \"Equatorial Africa\", a bell of\r\nleopard skin, with a clapper of fur, which was rung by the\r\nwizard doctor when entering a hut where someone was ill or\r\ndying. The leopard skin and fur clapper seem to have been\r\ndevised to make no noise, so as not to anger the demon that\r\nwas to be cast out. This reminds us strangely of the custom of\r\nringing a bell as the priest goes to administer the last rites.\r\n\r\nIt is said that first impressions are the strongest and most\r\nlasting; certain it is that humanity, through all its social and\r\nracial evolutions, has retained remnants of certain primitive\r\nideas to the present day. The army death reveille, the minute\r\ngun, the tolling of bells for the dead, the tocsin, etc., all\r\nhave their roots in the attributes assigned to the primitive\r\ndrum; for, as I have already pointed out, the more civilized\r\na people becomes, the more the word-symbols degenerate. It\r\nis this continual drifting away of the word-symbols from the\r\nnatural sounds which are occasioned by emotions that creates\r\nthe necessity for auxiliary means of expression, and thus\r\ngives us instrumental music.\r\n\r\nSince the advent of the drum a great stride toward civilization\r\nhad been made. Mankind no longer lived in caves but built huts\r\nand even temples, and the conditions under which he lived\r\nmust have been similar to those of the natives of Central\r\nAfrica before travellers opened up the Dark Continent to the\r\ncaravan of the European trader. If we look up the subject in\r\nthe narratives of Livingstone or Stanley we find that these\r\npeople lived in groups of coarsely-thatched huts, the village\r\nbeing almost invariably surrounded by a kind of stockade. Now\r\nthis manner of living is identically the same as that of all\r\nsavage tribes which have not passed beyond the drum state\r\nof civilization, namely, a few huts huddled together and\r\nsurrounded by a palisade of bamboo or cane. Since the pith\r\nwould decompose in a short time, we should probably find that\r\nthe wind, whirling across such a palisade of pipes--for that is\r\nwhat our bamboos would have turned to--would produce musical\r\nsounds, in fact, exactly the sounds that a large set of Pan's\r\npipes would produce. For after all what we call Pan's pipes\r\nare simply pieces of bamboo or cane of different lengths tied\r\ntogether and made to sound by blowing across the open tops.\r\n\r\nThe theory may be objected to on the ground that it scarcely\r\nproves the antiquity of the pipe to be less than that of the\r\ndrum; but the objection is hardly of importance when we consider\r\nthat the drum was known long before mankind had reached the\r\n\"hut\" stage of civilization. Under the head of pipe, the\r\ntrumpet and all its derivatives must be accepted. On this point\r\nthere has been much controversy. But it seems reasonable to\r\nbelieve that once it was found that sound could be produced\r\nby blowing across the top of a hollow pipe, the most natural\r\nthing to do would be to try the same effect on all hollow\r\nthings differing in shape and material from the original\r\nbamboo. This would account for the conch shells of the Amazons\r\nwhich, according to travellers' tales, were used to proclaim\r\nan attack in war; in Africa the tusks of elephants were used;\r\nin North America the instrument did not rise above the whistle\r\nmade from the small bones of a deer or of a turkey's leg.\r\n\r\nThat the Pan's pipes are the originals of all these species\r\nseems hardly open to doubt. Even among the Greeks and Romans\r\nwe see traces of them in the double trumpet and the double\r\npipe. These trumpets became larger and larger in form, and\r\nthe force required to play them was such that the player\r\nhad to adopt a kind of leather harness to strengthen his\r\ncheeks. Before this development had been reached, however,\r\nI have no doubt that all wind instruments were of the Pan's\r\npipes variety; that is to say, the instruments consisted of a\r\nhollow tube shut at one end, the sound being produced by the\r\nbreath catching on the open edge of the tube.\r\n\r\nDirect blowing into the tube doubtless came later. In\r\nthis case the tube was open at both ends, and the sound\r\nwas determined by its length and by the force given to the\r\nbreath in playing. There is good reason for admitting this new\r\ninstrument to be a descendant of the Pan's pipes, for it was\r\nevidently played by the nose at first. This would preclude\r\nits being considered as an originally forcible instrument,\r\nsuch as the trumpet.\r\n\r\nNow that we have traced the history of the pipe and considered\r\nthe different types of the instrument, we can see immediately\r\nthat it brought no great new truth home to man as did the drum.\r\n\r\nThe savage who first climbed secretly to the top of the\r\nstockade around his village to investigate the cause of the\r\nmysterious sounds would naturally say that the Great Spirit\r\nhad revealed a mystery to him; and he would also claim to be\r\na wonder worker. But while his pipe would be accepted to a\r\ncertain degree, it was nevertheless second in the field and\r\ncould hardly replace the drum. Besides, mankind had already\r\ncommenced to think on a higher plane, and the pipe was reduced\r\nto filling what gaps it could in the language of the emotions.\r\n\r\nThe second strongest emotion of the race is love. All over the\r\nworld, wherever we find the pipe in its softer, earlier form, we\r\nfind it connected with love songs. In time it degenerated into\r\na synonym for something contemptibly slothful and worthless,\r\nso much so that Plato wished to banish it from his \"Republic,\"\r\nsaying that the Lydian pipe should not have a place in a\r\ndecent community.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the trumpet branch of the family developed\r\ninto something quite different. At the very beginning it was\r\nused for war, and as its object was to frighten, it became\r\nlarger and larger in form, and more formidable in sound. In\r\nthis respect it only kept pace with the drum, for we read\r\nof Assyrian and Thibetan trumpets two or three yards long,\r\nand of the Aztec war drum which reached the enormous height\r\nof ten feet, and could be heard for miles.\r\n\r\nNow this, the trumpet species of pipe, we find also used as an\r\nauxiliary \"spiritual\" help to the drum. We are told by M. Huc,\r\nin his \"Travels in Thibet,\" that the llamas of Thibet have\r\na custom of assembling on the roofs of Lhassa at a stated\r\nperiod and blowing enormous trumpets, making the most hideous\r\nmidnight din imaginable. The reason given for this was that\r\nin former days the city was terrorized by demons who rose from\r\na deep ravine and crept through all the houses, working evil\r\neverywhere. After the priests had exorcised them by blowing\r\nthese trumpets, the town was troubled no more. In Africa the\r\nsame demonstration of trumpet blowing occurs at an eclipse\r\nof the moon; and, to draw the theory out to a thin thread,\r\nanyone who has lived in a small German Protestant town will\r\nremember the chorals which are so often played before sunrise\r\nby a band of trumpets, horns, and trombones from the belfry of\r\nsome church tower. Almost up to the end of the last century\r\ntrombones were intimately connected with the church service;\r\nand if we look back to Zoroaster we find the sacerdotal\r\ncharacter of this species of instrument very plainly indicated.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn back to the Pan's pipes and its direct\r\ndescendants, the flute, the clarinet, and the oboe. We shall\r\nfind that they had no connection whatever with religious\r\nobservances. Even in the nineteenth century novel we are\r\nfamiliar with the kind of hero who played the flute--a very\r\nsentimental gentleman always in love. If he had played the\r\nclarinet he would have been very sorrowful and discouraged; and\r\nif it had been the oboe (which, to the best of my knowledge,\r\nhas never been attempted in fiction) he would have needed to\r\nbe a very ill man indeed.\r\n\r\nNow we never hear of these latter kinds of pipes being\r\nconsidered fit for anything but the dance, love songs, or love\r\ncharms. In the beginning of the seventeenth century Garcilaso\r\nde la Vega, the historian of Peru, tells of the astonishing\r\npower of a love song played on a flute. We find so-called\r\n\"courting\" flutes in Formosa and Peru, and Catlin tells of the\r\nWinnebago courting flute. The same instrument was known in Java,\r\nas the old Dutch settlers have told us. But we never hear of it\r\nas creating awe, or as being thought a fit instrument to use\r\nwith the drum or trumpet in connection with religious rites.\r\nLeonardo da Vinci had a flute player make music while he\r\npainted his picture of Mona Lisa, thinking that it gave her the\r\nexpression he wished to catch--that strange smile reproduced\r\nin the Louvre painting. The flute member of the pipe species,\r\ntherefore, was more or less an emblem of eroticism, and, as I\r\nhave already said, has never been even remotely identified with\r\nreligious mysticism, with perhaps the one exception of Indra's\r\nflute, which, however, never seems to have been able to retain a\r\nplace among religious symbols. The trumpet, on the other hand,\r\nhas retained something of a mystical character even to our\r\nday. The most powerful illustration of this known to me is\r\nin the \"Requiem\" by Berlioz. The effect of those tremendous\r\ntrumpet calls from the four corners of the orchestra is an\r\noverwhelming one, of crushing power and majesty, much of which\r\nis due to the rhythm.\r\n\r\nTo sum up. We may regard rhythm as the intellectual side\r\nof music, melody as its sensuous side. The pipe is the one\r\ninstrument that seems to affect animals--hooded cobras,\r\nlizards, fish, etc. Animals' natures are purely sensuous,\r\ntherefore the pipe, or to put it more broadly, melody, affects\r\nthem. To rhythm, on the other hand, they are indifferent;\r\nit appeals to the intellect, and therefore only to man.\r\n\r\nThis theory would certainly account for much of the\r\npotency of what we moderns call music. All that aims to be\r\ndramatic, tragic, supernatural in our modern music, derives\r\nits impressiveness directly from rhythm.[01] What would\r\nthat shudder of horror in Weber's \"Freischuetz\" be without\r\nthat throb of the basses? Merely a diminished chord of the\r\nseventh. Add the pizzicato in the basses and the chord sinks\r\ninto something fearsome; one has a sudden choking sensation,\r\nas if one were listening in fear, or as if the heart had\r\nalmost stopped beating. All through Wagner's music dramas\r\nthis powerful effect is employed, from \"The Flying Dutchman\"\r\nto \"Parsifal.\" Every composer from Beethoven to Nicode has\r\nused the same means to express the same emotions; it is the\r\nmedium that pre-historic man first knew; it produced the same\r\nsensation of fear in him that it does in us at the present day.\r\n\r\nRhythm denotes a thought; it is the expression of a\r\npurpose. There is will behind it; its vital part is intention,\r\npower; it is an act. Melody, on the other hand, is an almost\r\nunconscious expression of the senses; it translates feeling\r\ninto sound. It is the natural outlet for sensation. In anger\r\nwe raise the voice; in sadness we lower it. In talking we\r\ngive expression to the emotions in sound. In a sentence in\r\nwhich fury alternates with sorrow, we have the limits of the\r\nmelody of speech. Add to this rhythm, and the very height of\r\nexpression is reached; for by it the intellect will dominate\r\nthe sensuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[01] The strength of the \"Fate\" motive in Beethoven's fifth\r\n     symphony undoubtedly lies in the succession of the four\r\n     notes at equal intervals of time. Beethoven himself\r\n     marked it _So pocht das Schicksal an die Pforte_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF SONG vs. ORIGIN OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nEmerson characterized language as \"fossil poetry,\" but \"fossil\r\nmusic\" would have described it even better; for as Darwin says,\r\nman _sang_ before he became human.\r\n\r\nGerber, in his \"Sprache als Kunst,\" describing the degeneration\r\nof sound symbols, says \"the saving point of language is\r\nthat the original material meanings of words have become\r\nforgotten or lost in their acquired ideal meaning.\" This\r\napplies with special force to the languages of China, Egypt,\r\nand India. Up to the last two centuries our written music\r\nwas held in bondage, was \"fossil music,\" so to speak. Only\r\ncertain progressions of sounds were allowed, for religion\r\ncontrolled music. In the Middle Ages folk song was used by\r\nthe Church, and a certain amount of control was exercised\r\nover it; even up to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\nthe use of sharps and flats was frowned upon in church music.\r\nBut gradually music began to break loose from its old chains,\r\nand in our own century we see Beethoven snap the last thread\r\nof that powerful restraint which had held it so long.\r\n\r\nThe vital germ of music, as we know it, lay in the fact that\r\nit had always found a home in the hearts of the common people\r\nof all nations. While from time immemorial theory, mostly in\r\nthe form of mathematical problems, was being fought over, and\r\nwhile laws were being laid down by religions and governments\r\nof all nations as to what music must be and what music was\r\nforbidden to be, the vital spark of the divine art was being\r\nkept alive deep beneath the ashes of life in the hearts of the\r\noppressed common folk. They still sang as they felt; when the\r\nmood was sad the song mirrored the sorrow; if it were gay the\r\nsong echoed it, despite the disputes of philosophers and the\r\ncommands of governments and religion. Montaigne, in speaking\r\nof language, said with truth, \"'Tis folly to attempt to fight\r\ncustom with theories.\" This folk song, to use a Germanism,\r\nwe can hardly take into account at the present moment, though\r\nlater we shall see that spark fanned into fire by Beethoven,\r\nand carried by Richard Wagner as a flaming torch through the\r\nvery home of the gods, \"Walhalla.\"\r\n\r\nLet us go back to our dust heap. Words have been called\r\n\"decayed sentences,\" that is to say, every word was once a\r\nsmall sentence complete in itself. This theory seems true\r\nenough when we remember that mankind has three languages,\r\neach complementing the other. For even now we say many words\r\nin one, when that word is reinforced and completed by our\r\nvocabulary of sounds and expression, which, in turn, has its\r\nshadow, gesture. These shadow languages, which accompany\r\nall our words, give to the latter vitality and raise them\r\nfrom mere abstract symbols to living representatives of\r\nthe idea. Indeed, in certain languages, this auxiliary\r\nexpression even overshadows the spoken word. For instance,\r\nin Chinese, the _theng_ or intonation of words is much more\r\nimportant than the actual words themselves. Thus the third\r\nintonation or _theng_, as it is called in the Pekin dialect,\r\nis an upward inflection of the voice. A word with this upward\r\ninflection would be unintelligible if given the fourth _theng_\r\nor downward inflection. For instance, the word \"kwai\" with a\r\ndownward inflection means \"honourable,\" but give it an upward\r\ninflection \"kwai\" and it means \"devil.\"\r\n\r\nJust as a word was originally a sentence, so was a tone in\r\nmusic something of a melody. One of the first things that\r\nimpresses us in studying examples of savage music is the\r\nmonotonic nature of the melodies; indeed some of the music\r\nconsists almost entirely of one oft-repeated sound. Those\r\nwho have heard this music say that the actual effect is not\r\none of a steady repetition of a single tone, but rather that\r\nthere seems to be an almost imperceptible rising and falling\r\nof the voice. The primitive savage is unable to sing a tone\r\nclearly and cleanly, the pitch invariably wavering. From\r\nthis almost imperceptible rising and falling of the voice\r\nabove and below one tone we are able to gauge more or less the\r\nstate of civilization of the nation to which the song belongs.\r\nThis phrase-tone corresponds, therefore, to the sentence-word,\r\nand like it, gradually loses its meaning as a phrase and fades\r\ninto a tone which, in turn, will be used in new phrases as\r\nmankind mounts the ladder of civilization.\r\n\r\nAt last then we have a single tone clearly uttered, and\r\nrecognizable as a musical tone. We can even make a plausible\r\nguess as to what that tone was. Gardiner, in his \"Music of\r\nNature,\" tells of experiments he made in order to determine the\r\nnormal pitch of the human voice. By going often to the gallery\r\nof the London Stock Exchange he found that the roar of voices\r\ninvariably amalgamated into one long note, which was always\r\nF. If we look over the various examples of monotonic savage\r\nmusic quoted by Fletcher, Fillmore, Baker, Wilkes, Catlin,\r\nand others, we find additional corroboration of the statement;\r\nsong after song, it will be noticed, is composed entirely of\r\nF, G, and even F alone or G alone. Such songs are generally\r\nancient ones, and have been crystallized and held intact by\r\nreligion, in much the same way that the chanting heard in the\r\nRoman Catholic service has been preserved.\r\n\r\nLet us assume then that the normal tone of the human voice\r\nin speaking is F or G [F: f g] for men, and for women the\r\noctave higher. This tone does very well for our everyday life;\r\nperhaps a pleasant impression may raise it somewhat, _ennui_ may\r\ndepress it slightly; but the average tone of our \"commonplace\"\r\ntalk, if I may call it that, will be about F. But let some\r\nsudden emotion come, and we find monotone speech abandoned for\r\nimpassioned speech, as it has been called. Instead of keeping\r\nthe voice evenly on one or two notes, we speak much higher or\r\nlower than our normal pitch.\r\n\r\nAnd these sounds may be measured and classified to a certain\r\nextent according to the emotions which cause them, although\r\nit must be borne in mind that we are looking at the matter\r\ncollectively; that is to say, without reckoning on individual\r\nidiosyncrasies of expression in speech. Of course we know that\r\njoy is apt to make us raise the voice and sadness to lower\r\nit. For instance, we have all heard gruesome stories, and\r\nhave noticed how naturally the voice sinks in the telling. A\r\nghost story told with an upward inflection might easily\r\nbecome humourous, so instinctively do we associate the upward\r\ninflection with a non-pessimistic trend of thought. Under stress\r\nof emotion we emphasize words strongly, and with this emphasis\r\nwe almost invariably raise the voice a fifth or depress it a\r\nfifth; with yet stronger emotion the interval of change will\r\nbe an octave. We raise the voice almost to a scream or drop it\r\nto a whisper. Strangely enough these primitive notes of music\r\ncorrespond to the first two of those harmonics which are part\r\nand parcel of every musical sound. Generally speaking, we may\r\nsay that the ascending inflection carries something of joy\r\nor hope with it, while the downward inflection has something\r\nof the sinister and fearful. To be sure, we raise our voices\r\nin anger and in pain, but even then the inflection is almost\r\nalways downward; in other words, we pitch our voices higher and\r\nlet them fall slightly. For instance, if we heard a person cry\r\n\"Ah/\" we might doubt its being a cry of pain, but if it were\r\n\"Ah\\\" we should at once know that it was caused by pain,\r\neither mental or physical.\r\n\r\nThe declamation at the end of Schubert's \"Erlking\" would have\r\nbeen absolutely false if the penultimate note had ascended to\r\nthe tonic instead of descending a fifth. \"The child lay dead.\"\r\n\r\nHow fatally hopeless would be the opening measures of \"Tristan\r\nand Isolde\" without that upward inflection which comes like a\r\nsunbeam through a rift in the cloud; with a downward inflection\r\nthe effect would be that of unrelieved gloom. In the Prelude to\r\n\"Lohengrin,\" Wagner pictures his angels in dazzling white. He\r\nuses the highest vibrating sounds at his command. But for\r\nthe dwarfs who live in the gloom of Niebelheim he chooses\r\ndeep shades of red, the lowest vibrating colour of the solar\r\nspectrum. For it is in the nature of the spiritual part\r\nof mankind to shrink from the earth, to aspire to something\r\nhigher; a bird soaring in the blue above us has something of\r\nthe ethereal; we give wings to our angels. On the other hand,\r\na serpent impresses us as something sinister. Trees, with\r\ntheir strange fight against all the laws of gravity, striving\r\nupward unceasingly, bring us something of hope and faith; the\r\nsight of them cheers us. A land without trees is depressing and\r\ngloomy. As Ruskin says, \"The sea wave, with all its beneficence,\r\nis yet devouring and terrible; but the silent wave of the blue\r\nmountain is lifted towards Heaven in a stillness of perpetual\r\nmercy; and while the one surges unfathomable in its darkness,\r\nthe other is unshaken in its faithfulness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet so strange is human nature that that which we\r\ncall civilization strives unceasingly to nullify emotion.\r\nThe almost childlike faith which made our church spires\r\npoint heavenward also gave us Gothic architecture, that\r\nemblem of frail humanity striving towards the ideal. It is\r\na long leap from that childlike faith to the present day of\r\nskyscrapers. For so is the world constituted. A great truth\r\ntoo often becomes gradually a truism, then a merely tolerated\r\nand uninteresting theory; gradually it becomes obsolete\r\nand sometimes even degenerates into a symbol of sarcasm or a\r\nservant of utilitarianism. This we are illustrating every day\r\nof our lives. We speak of a person's being \"silly,\" and yet\r\nthe word comes from \"saelig,\" old English for \"blessed\"; to act\r\n\"sheepishly\" once had reference to divine resignation, \"even\r\nas a sheep led to the slaughter,\" and so on _ad infinitum_.\r\nWe build but few great cathedrals now. Our tall buildings\r\ngenerally point to utilitarianism and the almighty dollar.\r\n\r\nBut in the new art, music, we have found a new domain in which\r\nimpulses have retained their freshness and warmth, in which,\r\nto quote Goethe, \"first comes the act, then the word\"; first\r\nthe expression of emotion, then the theory that classifies it;\r\na domain in which words cannot lose their original meanings\r\nentirely, as in speech. For in spite of the strange twistings\r\nof ultra modern music, a simple melody still embodies the\r\nsame pathos for us that it did for our grandparents. To be\r\nsure the poignancy of harmony in our day has been heightened\r\nto an incredible degree. We deal in gorgeous colouring and\r\nmighty sound masses which would have been amazing in the last\r\ncentury; but still through it all we find in Haendel, Beethoven,\r\nand Schubert, up to Wagner, the same great truths of declamation\r\nthat I have tried to explain to you.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer, in an essay on \"The Origin and Functions of\r\nMusic,\" speaks of speech as the parent of music. He says,\r\n\"utterance, which when languaged is speech, gave rise to\r\nmusic.\" The definition is incomplete, for \"languaged utterance,\"\r\nas he calls it, which is speech, is a duality, is either an\r\nexpression of emotion or a mere symbol of emotion, and as such\r\nhas gradually sunk to the level of the commonplace. As Rowbotham\r\npoints out, impassioned speech is the parent of music, while\r\nunimpassioned speech has remained the vehicle for the smaller\r\nemotions of life, the everyday expression of everyday emotions.\r\n\r\nIn studying the music of different nations we are confronted\r\nby one fact which seems to be part and parcel of almost every\r\nnationality, namely, the constant recurrence of what is called\r\nthe five tone (pentatonic) scale. We find it in primitive\r\nforms of music all the world over, in China and in Scotland,\r\namong the Burmese, and again in North America. Why it is so\r\nseems almost doomed to remain a mystery. The following theory\r\nmay nevertheless be advanced as being at least plausible:\r\n\r\nVocal music, as we understand it, and as I have already\r\nexplained, began when the first tone could be given clearly;\r\nthat is to say, when the sound sentence had amalgamated into the\r\nsingle musical tone. The pitch being sometimes F, sometimes G,\r\nsudden emotion gives us the fifth, C or D, and the strongest\r\nemotion the octave, F or G. Thus we have already the following\r\nsounds in our first musical scale.\r\n\r\n    [G: f' g' c'' d'' f'']\r\n\r\nWe know how singers slur from one tone to another. It is a\r\nfault that caused the fathers of harmony to prohibit what\r\nare called hidden fifths in vocal music. The jump from G to\r\nC in the above scale fragment would be slurred, for we must\r\nremember that the intoning of clear individual sounds was\r\nstill a novelty to the savage. Now the distance from G to\r\nC is too small to admit two tones such as the savage knew;\r\nconsequently, for the sake of uniformity, he would try to\r\nput but one tone between, singing a mixture of A and B[flat],\r\nwhich sound in time fell definitely to A, leaving the mystery\r\nof the half-tone unsolved. This addition of the third would\r\nthus fall in with the law of harmonics again. First we have the\r\nkeynote; next in importance comes the fifth; and last of all\r\nthe third. Thus again is the absence of the major seventh in\r\nour primitive scale perfectly logical; we may search in vain\r\nin our list of harmonics for the tone which forms that interval.\r\n\r\nNow that we have traced the influence of passionate utterance\r\non music, it still remains for us to consider the influence\r\nof something very different. The dance played an important\r\nrole in the shaping of the art of music; for to it music owes\r\nperiodicity, form, the shaping of phrases into measures,\r\neven its rests. And in this music is not the only debtor,\r\nfor poetry owes its very \"feet\" to the dance.\r\n\r\nNow the dance was, and is, an irresponsible thing. It had no\r\n_raison d'etre_ except purely physical enjoyment. This rhythmic\r\nswaying of the body and light tapping of the feet have always\r\nhad a mysterious attraction and fascination for mankind,\r\nand music and poetry were caught in its swaying measures\r\nearly in the dawn of art. When a man walks, he takes either\r\nlong steps or short steps, he walks fast or slow. But when\r\nhe takes one long step and one short one, when one step is\r\nslow and the other fast, he no longer walks, he dances. Thus\r\nwe may say with reasonable certainty that triple time arose\r\ndirectly from the dance, for triple time is simply one strong,\r\nlong beat followed by a short, light one, viz.: [2 4] or\r\n[- '], the \"trochee\" in our poetry. [4 2] [' -], Iambic.\r\nThe spondee [2 2] or [- -], which is the rhythm of prose,\r\nwe already possessed; for when we walk it is in spondees,\r\nnamely, in groups of two equal steps. Now imagine dancing\r\nto spondees! At first the steps will be equal, but the body\r\nrests on the first beat; little by little the second beat,\r\nbeing thus relegated to a position of relative unimportance,\r\nbecomes shorter and shorter, and we rest longer on the first\r\nbeat. The result is the trochaic rhythm. We can see that this\r\nresult is inevitable, even if only the question of physical\r\nfatigue is considered. And, to carry on our theory, this very\r\nquestion of fatigue still further develops rhythm. The strong\r\nbeat always coming on one foot, and the light beat on the other,\r\nwould soon tire the dancer; therefore some way must be found\r\nto make the strong beat alternate from one foot to the other.\r\nThe simplest, and in fact almost the only way to do this,\r\nis to insert an additional short beat before the light beat.\r\nThis gives us [- ' -] or [4. 8 4], the dactyl in poetry.\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, here discovered the beginning of form, and\r\nhave begun to group our musical tones in measures and phrases;\r\nfor our second dactyl is slightly different from the first,\r\nbecause the right foot begins the first and the left foot the\r\nsecond. We have two measures [(4. 8 4 | 4. 8 4)]\r\n                             [(-  ' - | -  ' -)]\r\nand one phrase, for after the second measure the right foot\r\nwill again have the beat and will begin another phrase of two\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nCarry this theory still further, and we shall make new\r\ndiscoveries. If we dance in the open air, unless we would dance\r\nover the horizon, we must turn somewhere; and if we have but a\r\nsmall space in which to dance, the turns must come sooner and\r\noftener. Even if we danced in a circle we should need to reverse\r\nthe motion occasionally, in order to avoid giddiness; and this\r\nwould measure off our phrases into periods and sections.\r\n\r\nThus we see music dividing into two classes, one purely\r\nemotional, the other sensuous; the one arising from the language\r\nof heroes, the other from the swaying of the body and the patter\r\nof feet. To both of these elements, if we may call them so,\r\nmetre and melody brought their power; to declamation, metre\r\nbrought its potent vitality; to the dance, melody added its soft\r\ncharm and lulling rhyme. The intellectual in music, namely,\r\nrhythm and declamation, thus joined forces, as did the purely\r\nsensuous elements, melody and metre (dance). At the first glance\r\nit would seem as if the dance with its rhythms contradicted the\r\ntheory of rhythm as being one of the two vital factors in music;\r\nbut when we consider the fact that dance-rhythms are merely\r\nregular pulsations (once commenced they pulsate regularly to\r\nthe end, without break or change), and when we consider that\r\njust this unbroken regularity is the very antithesis of what\r\nwe mean by rhythm, the purely sensuous nature of the dance is\r\nmanifest. Strauss was the first to recognize this defect in\r\nthe waltz, and he remedied it, so far as it lay within human\r\nskill, by a marvellous use of counter-rhythms, thus infusing\r\ninto the dance a simulation of intellectuality.\r\n\r\nThe weaving together of these elements into one art-fabric has\r\nbeen the ideal of all poets from Homer to Wagner. The Greeks\r\nidealized their dances; that is to say, they made their dances\r\nfit their declamation. In the last two centuries, and especially\r\nin the middle of the nineteenth, we have danced our highest\r\nflights of impassioned speech. For what is the symphony, sonata,\r\netc., but a remnant of the dance form? The choric dances of\r\nStesichorus and Pindar came strangely near our modern forms,\r\nbut it was because the form fitted the poem. In our modern\r\ndays, we too often, Procrustes-like, make our ideas to fit the\r\nforms. We put our guest, the poetic thought, that comes to us\r\nlike a homing bird from out the mystery of the blue sky--we\r\nput this confiding stranger straightway into that iron bed,\r\nthe \"sonata form,\" or perhaps even the third rondo form,\r\nfor we have quite an assortment. Should the idea survive\r\nand grow too large for the bed, and if we have learned to\r\nlove it too much to cut off its feet and thus _make_ it fit\r\n(as did that old robber of Attica), why we run the risk of\r\nhaving some critic wise in his theoretical knowledge, say,\r\nas was and is said of Chopin, \"He is weak in sonata form!\"\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of looking at music: first, as impassioned\r\nspeech, the nearest psychologically-complete utterance of\r\nemotion known to man; second, as the dance, comprising as it\r\ndoes all that appeals to our nature. And there is much that is\r\nlovely in this idea of nature--for do not the seasons dance,\r\nand is it not in that ancient measure we have already spoken of,\r\nthe trochaic? Long Winter comes with heavy foot, and Spring is\r\nthe light-footed. Again, Summer is long, and Autumn short and\r\ncheery; and so our phrase begins again and again. We all know\r\nwith what periodicity everything in nature dances, and how the\r\nsmallest flower is a marvel of recurring rhymes and rhythms,\r\nwith perfume for a melody. How Shakespeare's Beatrice charms us\r\nwhen she says, \"There a star danced, and under that was I born.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet man is not part of Nature. Even in the depths of the\r\nprimeval forest, that poor savage, whom we found listening\r\nfearfully to the sound of his drum, knew better. Mankind lives\r\nin isolation, and Nature is a thing for him to conquer. For\r\nNature is a thing that exists, while man _thinks_. Nature is\r\nthat which passively lives while man actively wills. It is the\r\nstrain of Nature in man that gave him the dance, and it is his\r\ngodlike fight against Nature that gave him impassioned speech;\r\nbeauty of form and motion on one side, all that is divine in man\r\non the other; on one side materialism, on the other idealism.\r\n\r\nWe have traced the origin of the drum, pipe, and the voice in\r\nmusic. It still remains for us to speak of the lyre and the\r\nlute, the ancestors of our modern stringed instruments. The\r\nrelative antiquity of the lyre and the lute as compared with\r\nthe harp has been much discussed, the main contention against\r\nthe lyre being that it is a more artificial instrument than\r\nthe harp; the harp was played with the fingers alone, while the\r\nlyre was played with a plectrum (a small piece of metal, wood,\r\nor ivory). Perhaps it would be safer to take the lute as the\r\nearliest form of the stringed instrument, for, from the very\r\nfirst, we find two species of instruments with strings, one\r\nplayed with the fingers, the prototype of our modern harps,\r\nbanjos, guitars, etc., the other played with the plectrum,\r\nthe ancestor of all our modern stringed instruments played by\r\nmeans of bows and hammers, such as violins, pianos, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, one thing is certain, the possession of\r\nthese instruments implies already a considerable measure of\r\nculture, for they were not haphazard things. They were made for\r\na purpose, were invented to fill a gap in the ever-increasing\r\nneeds of expression. In Homer we find a description of the\r\nmaking of a lyre by Hermes, how this making of a lyre from the\r\nshell of a tortoise that happened to pass before the entrance to\r\nthe grotto of his mother, Maia, was his first exploit; and that\r\nhe made it to accompany his song in praise of his father Zeus.\r\nWe must accept this explanation of the origin of the lyre,\r\nnamely, that it was deliberately invented to accompany the\r\nvoice. For the lyre in its primitive state was never a solo\r\ninstrument; the tone was weak and its powers of expression\r\nwere exceedingly limited. On the other hand, it furnished an\r\nexcellent background for the voice and, which was still more\r\nto the point, the singer could accompany himself. The drum\r\nhad too vague a pitch, and the flute or pipe necessitated\r\nanother performer, besides having too much similarity of tone\r\nto the voice to give sufficient contrast. Granted then that the\r\nlyre was invented to accompany the voice, and without wasting\r\ntime with surmises as to whether the first idea of stringed\r\ninstruments was received from the twanging of a bowstring\r\nor the finding of a tortoise shell with the half-dessicated\r\ntendons of the animal still stretching across it, let us find\r\nwhen the instrument was seemingly first used.\r\n\r\nThat the lyre and lute are of Asiatic origin is generally\r\nconceded, and even in comparatively modern times, Asia seems to\r\nbe the home of its descendants. The Tartars have been called\r\nthe troubadours of Asia--and of Asia in the widest sense of\r\nthe word--penetrating into the heart of the Caucasus on the\r\nwest and reaching through the country eastward to the shores of\r\nthe Yellow Sea. Marco Polo, the celebrated Venetian traveller,\r\nand M. Huc, a French missionary to China and Thibet, as well\r\nas Spencer, Atkinson, and many others, speak of the wandering\r\nbards of Asia. Marco Polo's account of how Jenghiz Kahn, the\r\ngreat Mongol conqueror, sent an expedition composed entirely of\r\nminstrels against Mien, a city of 30,000 inhabitants, has often\r\nbeen quoted to show what an abundance--or perhaps superfluity\r\nwould be the better word--of musicians he had at his court.\r\n\r\nThat the lyre could not be of Greek origin is proved by the fact\r\nthat no root has been discovered in the language for _lyra_,\r\nalthough there are many special names for varieties of the\r\ninstrument. Leaving aside the question of the geographical\r\norigin of the instrument, we may say, broadly, that wherever\r\nwe find a nation with even the smallest approach to a history,\r\nthere we shall find bards singing of the exploits of heroes,\r\nand always to the accompaniment of the lyre or the lute. For at\r\nlast, by means of these instruments, impassioned speech was able\r\nto lift itself permanently above the level of everyday life,\r\nand its lofty song could dispense with the soft, sensuous\r\nlull of the flute. And we shall see later how these bards\r\nbecame seers, and how even our very angels received harps,\r\nso closely did the instrument become associated with what I\r\nhave called impassioned speech, which, in other words, is the\r\nhighest expression of what we consider godlike in man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE HEBREWS AND THE HINDUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music of the Hebrews presents one of the most interesting\r\nsubjects in musical history, although it has an unfortunate\r\ndefect in common with so many kindred subjects, namely,\r\nthat the most learned dissertation must invariably end with\r\na question mark. When we read in Josephus that Solomon had\r\n200,000 singers, 40,000 harpers, 40,000 sistrum players, and\r\n200,000 trumpeters, we simply do not believe it. Then too\r\nthere is lack of unanimity in the matter of the essential\r\nfacts. One authority, describing the _machol_, says it is\r\na stringed instrument resembling a modern viola; another\r\ndescribes it as a wind instrument somewhat like a bagpipe;\r\nstill another says it is a metal ring with a bell attachment\r\nlike an Egyptian sistrum; and finally an equally respected\r\nauthority claims that the _machol_ was not an instrument at\r\nall, but a dance. Similarly the _maanim_ has been described\r\nas a trumpet, a kind of rattle box with metal clappers, and\r\nwe even have a full account in which it figures as a violin.\r\n\r\nThe temple songs which we know have evidently been much\r\nchanged by surrounding influences, just as in modern synagogues\r\nthe architecture has not held fast to ancient Hebrew models\r\nbut has been greatly influenced by different countries and\r\npeoples. David may be considered the founder of Hebrew music,\r\nand his reign has been well called an \"idyllic episode in the\r\notherwise rather grim history of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nOf the instruments named in the Scriptures, that called the\r\nharp in our English translation was probably the _kinnor_,\r\na kind of lyre played by means of a plectrum, which was a\r\nsmall piece of metal, wood, or bone. The psaltery or _nebel_\r\n(which was of course derived from the Egyptian _nabla_, just\r\nas the _kinnor_ probably was in some mysterious manner derived\r\nfrom the Chinese _kin_) was a kind of dulcimer or zither, an\r\noblong box with strings which were struck by small hammers. The\r\ntimbrel corresponds to our modern tambourine. The _schofar_\r\nand _keren_ were horns. The former was the well-known ram's horn\r\nwhich is still blown on the occasion of the Jewish New Year.\r\n\r\nIn the Talmud mention is made of an organ consisting of ten\r\npipes which could give one hundred different sounds, each pipe\r\nbeing able to produce ten tones. This mysterious instrument was\r\ncalled _magrepha_, and although but one Levite (the Levites were\r\nthe professional musicians among the Hebrews) was required to\r\nplay it, and although it was only about three feet in length,\r\nits sound was so tremendous that it could be heard ten miles\r\naway. Hieronymus speaks of having heard it on the Mount of\r\nOlives when it was played in the Temple at Jerusalem. To add\r\nto the mystery surrounding this instrument, it has been proved\r\nby several learned authorities that it was merely a large drum;\r\nand, to cap the climax, other equally respected writers have\r\ndeclared that this instrument was simply a large shovel which,\r\nafter being used for the sacrificial fire in the temple, was\r\nthrown to the ground with a great noise, to inform the people\r\nthat the sacrifice was consummated.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonably certain that the seemingly incongruous titles\r\nto the Psalms were merely given to denote the tune to which\r\nthey were to be sung, just as in our modern hymns we use the\r\nwords _Canterbury_, _Old Hundredth_, _China_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe word _selah_ has never been satisfactorily explained, some\r\nreadings giving as its meaning \"forever,\" \"hallelujah,\" etc.,\r\nwhile others say that it means repeat, an inflection of the\r\nvoice, a modulation to another key, an instrumental interlude,\r\na rest, and so on without end.\r\n\r\nOf one thing we may be certain regarding the ancient Hebrews,\r\nnamely, that their religion brought something into the world\r\nthat can never again be lost. It fostered idealism, and gave\r\nmankind something pure and noble to live for, a religion\r\nover which Christianity shed the sunshine of divine mercy\r\nand hope. That the change which was to be wrought in life was\r\nsharply defined may be seen by comparing the great songs of the\r\ndifferent nations. For up to that time a song of praise meant\r\npraise of a _King_. He was the sun that warmed men's hearts,\r\nthe being from whom all wisdom came, and to whom men looked\r\nfor mercy. If we compare the Egyptian hymns with those of the\r\nHebrews, the difference is very striking. On the walls of the\r\ngreat temples of Luxor and the Ramesseum at Thebes, as well as\r\non the wall of the temple of Abydos and in the main hall of the\r\ngreat rock-hewn temple of Abu-Simbel, in Nubia, is carved the\r\n\"Epic of Pentaur,\" the royal Egyptian scribe of Rameses II:\r\n\r\n    My king, his arms are mighty, his heart is firm. He\r\n    bends his bow and none can resist him. Mightier\r\n    than a hundred thousand men he marches forward. His\r\n    counsel is wise and when he wears the royal crown,\r\n    Alef, and declares his will, he is the protector of\r\n    his people. His heart is like a mountain of iron. Such\r\n    is King Rameses.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the Hebrew prophets, this is their song:\r\n\r\n    The mountains melted from before the Lord and before\r\n    Him went the pestilence; burning coals went forth at\r\n    His feet. Hell is naked before Him and destruction\r\n    hath no covering. He hangeth the earth upon nothing\r\n    and the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished\r\n    at His reproof. Though He slay me, yet will I trust\r\n    in Him. For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and at\r\n    the last day He shall stand upon the earth.\r\n\r\nAs with the Hebrews, music among the Hindus was closely\r\nbound to religion. When, 3000 years before the Christian era,\r\nthat wonderful, tall, white Aryan race of men descended upon\r\nIndia from the north, its poets already sang of the gods,\r\nand the Aryan gods were of a different order from those known\r\nto that part of the world; for they were beautiful in shape,\r\nand friendly to man, in great contrast to the gods of the\r\nDavidians, the pre-Aryan race and stock of the Deccan. These\r\nsongs formed the _Rig-Veda_, and are the nucleus from which\r\nall Hindu religion and art emanate.\r\n\r\nWe already know that when the auxiliary speech which we call\r\nmusic was first discovered, or, to use the language of all\r\nprimitive nations, when it was first bestowed on man by the\r\ngods, it retained much of the supernatural potency that its\r\norigin would suggest. In India, music was invested with divine\r\npower, and certain hymns--especially the prayer or chant of\r\nVashishtha--were, according to the _Rig-Veda_, all powerful in\r\nbattle. Such a magic song, or chant, was called a _brahma_,\r\nand he who sang it a _brahmin_. Thus the very foundation of\r\nBrahminism, from which rose Buddhism in the sixth century\r\nB.C., can be traced back to the music of the sacred songs of\r\nthe _Rig-Veda_ of India. The priestly or Brahmin caste grew\r\ntherefore from the singers of the Vedic hymns. The Brahmins\r\nwere not merely the keepers of the sacred books, or Vedas, the\r\nphilosophy, science, and laws of the ancient Hindus (for that is\r\nhow the power of the caste developed), but they were also the\r\ncreators and custodians of its secular literature and art. Two\r\nand a half thousand years later Prince Gautama or Buddha died,\r\nafter a life of self-sacrifice and sanctity. On his death five\r\nhundred of his disciples met in a cave near Rajagriha to gather\r\ntogether his sayings, and chanted the lessons of their great\r\nmaster. These songs became the bible of Buddhism, just as the\r\n_Vedas_ are the bible of Brahminism, for the Hindu word for\r\na Buddhist council means literally \"a singing together.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the sacred songs of the Brahmins and Buddhists, the\r\nHindus had many others, some of which partook of the occult\r\npowers of the hymns, occult powers that were as strongly marked\r\nas those of Hebrew music. For while the latter are revealed in\r\nthe playing of David before Saul, in the influence of music on\r\nprophecy, the falling of the walls of Jericho at the sound of\r\nthe trumpets of Joshua, etc., in India the same supernatural\r\npower was ascribed to certain songs. For instance, there were\r\nsongs that could be sung only by the gods, and one of them, so\r\nthe legend runs, if sung by a mortal, would envelop the singer\r\nin flames. The last instance of the singing of this song was\r\nduring the reign of Akbar, the great Mogul emperor (about 1575\r\nA.D.). At his command the singer sang it standing up to his\r\nneck in the river Djaumna, which, however, did not save him,\r\nfor, according to the account, the water around him boiled,\r\nand he was finally consumed by a flame of fire. Another of\r\nAkbar's singers caused the palace to be wrapped in darkness\r\nby means of one of these magic songs, and another averted a\r\nfamine by causing rain to fall when the country was threatened\r\nby drought. Animals were also tamed by means of certain songs,\r\nthe only relic of which is found in the serpent charmers'\r\nmelodies, which, played on a kind of pipe, seem to possess the\r\npower of controlling cobras and the other snakes exhibited by\r\nthe Indian fakirs.\r\n\r\nMany years before Gautama's time, the brahmas or singers of\r\nsacred songs of ancient India formed themselves into a caste or\r\npriesthood; and the word \"Brahma,\" from meaning a sacred singer,\r\nbecame the name of the supreme deity; in time, as the nation\r\ngrew, other gods were taken into the religion. Thus we find in\r\npre-Buddha times the trinity of gods: Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva,\r\nwith their wives, Sarasvati or learning, Lakshmi or beauty,\r\nand Paravati, who was also called Kali, Durga, and Mahadevi,\r\nand was practically the goddess of evil. Of these gods Brahma's\r\nconsort, Sarasvati, the goddess of speech and learning, brought\r\nto earth the art of music, and gave to mankind the _Vina_.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is still in use and may be called the national\r\ninstrument of India. It is composed of a cylindrical pipe,\r\noften bamboo, about three and a half feet long, at each end\r\nof which is fixed a hollow gourd to increase the tone. It is\r\nstrung lengthwise with seven metal wires held up by nineteen\r\nwooden bridges, just as the violin strings are supported by a\r\nbridge. The scale of the instrument proceeds in half tones from\r\n[F: a,] to [G: b''] The tones are produced by plucking the\r\nstrings with the fingers (which are covered with a kind of\r\nmetal thimble), and the instrument is held so that one of\r\nthe gourds hangs over the left shoulder, just as one would\r\nhold a very long-necked banjo.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Krishna incarnation of Vishnu that the Hindu scale\r\nis ascribed. According to the legend, Krishna or Vishnu came to\r\nearth and took the form of a shepherd, and the nymphs sang to\r\nhim in many thousand different keys, of which from twenty-four\r\nto thirty-six are known and form the basis of Hindu music. To\r\nbe sure these keys, being formed by different successions of\r\nquarter-tones, are practically inexhaustible, and the 16,000\r\nkeys of Krishna are quite practicable. The differences in tone,\r\nhowever, were so very slight that only a few, of them have\r\nbeen retained to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Hindus get their flute from the god Indra, who, from being\r\noriginally the all-powerful deity, was relegated by Brahminism\r\nto the chief place among the minor gods--from being the god\r\nof light and air he came to be the god of music. His retinue\r\nconsisted of the _gandharvas_, and _apsaras_, or celestial\r\nmusicians and nymphs, who sang magic songs. After the rise and\r\ndownfall of Buddhism in India the term _raga_ degenerated to\r\na name for a merely improvised chant to which no occult power\r\nwas ascribed.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics in modern Hindu music are a\r\nseemingly instinctive sense of harmony; and although the actual\r\nchords are absent, the melodic formation of the songs plainly\r\nindicates a feeling for modern harmony, and even form. The\r\nactual scale resembles our European scale of twelve semitones\r\n(twenty-two _s'rutis_, quarter-tones), but the modal development\r\nof these sounds has been extraordinary. Now a \"mode\" is the\r\nmanner in which the notes of a scale are arranged. For instance,\r\nin our major mode the scale is arranged as follows: tone,\r\ntone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone. In India there\r\nare at present seventy-two modes in use which are produced by\r\nmaking seventy-two different arrangements of the scale by means\r\nof sharps and flats, the only rule being that each degree of\r\nthe scale must be represented; for instance, one of the modes\r\n_Dehrasan-Karabharna_ corresponds to our major scale. Our minor\r\n(harmonic) scale figures as _Kyravani_. _Tanarupi_ corresponds\r\nto the following succession of notes,\r\n\r\n    [G: c' d-' e--' f' g' a+' b' c'']\r\n\r\n_Gavambodi_, to [G: c' d-' e-' f+' g' a-' b--' c'']\r\n\r\n_Maya-Malavagaula_, to [G: c' d' e-' f' g-' a' b-' c'']\r\n\r\nIt can thus easily be seen how the seventy-two modes are\r\npossible and practicable. Observe that the seven degrees of\r\nthe scale are all represented in these modes, the difference\r\nbetween them being in the placing of half-tones by means of\r\nsharps or flats. Not content with the complexity that this modal\r\nsystem brought into their music, the Hindus have increased it\r\nstill more by inventing a number of formulae called _ragas_\r\n(not to be confounded with those rhapsodical songs, the modern\r\ndescendant of the magic chants, previously mentioned).\r\n\r\nIn making a Hindu melody (which of course must be in one of\r\nthe seventy-two modes, just as in English we should say that a\r\nmelody must be in one of our two modes, either major or minor)\r\none would have to conform to one of the _ragas_, that is to\r\nsay, the melodic outline would have to conform to certain\r\nrules, both in ascending and descending. These rules consist\r\nof omitting notes of the modes, in one manner when the melody\r\nascends, and in another when it descends. Thus, in the _raga_\r\ncalled _Mohanna_, in ascending the notes must be arranged in\r\nthe following order: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8; in descending it is 8,\r\n7, 5, 4, 2, 1. Thus if we wished to write a melody in the mode\r\n_Tanarupi_--_raga Mohanna_--we could never use the fourth,\r\nF, or the seventh, B, if our melody ascended; if our melody\r\ndescended we should have to avoid the sixth, A[sharp], and the\r\nthird, E[double-flat]. As one can easily perceive, many strange\r\nmelodic effects are produced by these means. For instance,\r\nin the _raga Mohanna_, in which the fourth and seventh degrees\r\nof the scale are avoided in ascending, if it were employed in\r\nthe mode _Dehrasin-Karabharna_, which corresponds to our own\r\nmajor scale, it would have a pronounced Scotch tinge so long\r\nas the melody ascended; but let it _descend_ and the Scotch\r\nelement is deserted for a decided North American Indian,\r\nnotably Sioux tinge. The Hindus are an imaginative race, and\r\ninvest all these _ragas_ and modes with mysterious attributes,\r\nsuch as anger, love, fear, and so on. They were even personified\r\nas supernatural beings; each had his or her special name and\r\nhistory. It was proper to use some of them only at midday,\r\nsome in the morning, and some at night. If the mode or _raga_\r\nis changed during a piece, it is expressed in words, by saying,\r\nfor instance, that \"_Mohanna_\" (the new \"_raga_\") is here\r\nintroduced to the family of _Tanarupi_. The melodies formed\r\nfrom these modes and _ragas_ are divided into four classes,\r\n_Rektah_, _Teranah_, _Tuppah_, and _Ragni_. The _Rektah_ is in\r\ncharacter light and flowing. It falls naturally into regular\r\nperiods, and resembles the _Teranah_, with the exception that\r\nthe latter is only sung by men. The character of the _Tuppah_\r\nis not very clear, but the _Ragni_ is a direct descendant\r\nof the old magic songs and incantations; in character it is\r\nrhapsodical and spasmodic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE EGYPTIANS, ASSYRIANS, AND CHINESE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the music of antiquity we are seriously hampered\r\nby the fact that there is practically no actual music in\r\nexistence which dates back farther than the eighth or tenth\r\ncentury of the present era. Even those well-known specimens of\r\nGreek music, as they are claimed to be, the hymns to Apollo,\r\nNemesis, and Calliope, do not date farther back than the third\r\nor fourth century, and even these are by no means generally\r\nconsidered authentic. Therefore, so far as actual sounds go,\r\nall music of which we have any practical knowledge dates from\r\nabout the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, we have the most minute knowledge of the\r\nscientific aspect of music, dating from more than five hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era. This knowledge, however, is\r\nworse than valueless, for it is misleading. For instance,\r\nit would be a very difficult thing for posterity to form any\r\nidea as to what our music was like if all the actual music in\r\nthe world at the present time were destroyed, and only certain\r\nscientific works such as that of Helmholtz on acoustics and a\r\nfew theoretical treatises on harmony, form, counterpoint and\r\nfugue were saved.\r\n\r\nFrom Helmholtz's analysis of sounds one would get the idea\r\nthat the so-called tempered scale of our pianos caused thirds\r\nand sixths to sound discordantly.\r\n\r\nFrom the books on harmony one would gather that consecutive\r\nfifths and octaves and a number of other things were never\r\nindulged in by composers, and to cap the climax one would\r\nnaturally accept the harmony exercises contained in the books\r\nas being the very acme of what we loved best in music. Thus\r\nwe see that any investigation into the music of antiquity must\r\nbe more or less conjectural.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the music of the Egyptians. The oldest\r\nexisting musical instrument of which we have any knowledge is\r\nan Egyptian lyre to be found in the Berlin Royal Museum. It\r\nis about four thousand years old, dating from the period just\r\nbefore the expulsion of the Hyksos or \"Shepherd\" kings.\r\n\r\nAt that time (the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty, 1500-2000\r\nB.C.) Egypt was just recovering from her five hundred years of\r\nbondage, and music must already have reached a wonderful state\r\nof development. In wall paintings of the eighteenth dynasty\r\nwe see flutes, double flutes, and harps of all sizes, from\r\nthe small one carried in the hand, to the great harps, almost\r\nseven feet high, with twenty-one strings; the never-failing\r\nsistrum (a kind of rattle); kitharas, the ancestors of our\r\nmodern guitars; lutes and lyres, the very first in the line\r\nof instruments culminating in the modern piano.\r\n\r\nOne hesitates to class the trumpets of the Egyptians in the\r\nsame category, for they were war instruments, the tone of\r\nwhich was probably always forced, for Herodotus says that\r\nthey sounded like the braying of a donkey. The fact that the\r\ncheeks of the trumpeter were reinforced with leather straps\r\nwould further indicate that the instruments were used only\r\nfor loud signalling.\r\n\r\nAccording to the mural paintings and sculptures in the tombs\r\nof the Egyptians, all these instruments were played together,\r\nand accompanied the voice. It has long been maintained that\r\nharmony was unknown to the ancients because of the mathematical\r\nmeasurement of sounds. This might be plausible for strings,\r\nbut pipes could be cut to any size. The positions of the hands\r\nof the executants on the harps and lyres, as well as the use\r\nof short and long pipes, make it appear probable that something\r\nof what we call harmony was known to the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nWe must also consider that their paintings and sculptures were\r\neminently symbolic. When one carves an explanation in hard\r\ngranite it is apt to be done in shorthand, as it were. Thus, a\r\ntree meant a forest, a prisoner meant a whole army; therefore,\r\ntwo sculptured harpists or flute players may stand for twenty\r\nor two hundred. Athenaeus, who lived at the end of the second\r\nand beginning of the third century, A.D., speaks of orchestras\r\nof six hundred in Ptolemy Philadelphus's time (300 B.C.),\r\nand says that three hundred of the players were harpers, in\r\nwhich number he probably includes players on other stringed\r\ninstruments, such as lutes and lyres. It is therefore to be\r\ninferred that the other three hundred played wind and percussion\r\ninstruments. This is an additional reason for conjecturing\r\nthat they used chords in their music; for six hundred players,\r\nnot to count the singers, would hardly play entirely in unison\r\nor in octaves. The very nature of the harp is chordal, and\r\nthe sculptures always depict the performer playing with both\r\nhands, the fingers being more or less outstretched. That the\r\nmusic must have been of a deep, sonorous character, we may\r\ngather from the great size of the harps and the thickness of\r\ntheir strings. As for the flutes, they also are pictured as\r\nbeing very long; therefore they must have been low in pitch.\r\nThe reed pipes, judging from the pictures and sculptures,\r\nwere no higher in pitch than our oboes, of which the highest\r\nnote is D and E above the treble staff.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that so far as the harps were concerned,\r\nthe music must have been strictly diatonic in character.\r\nTo quote Rowbotham, \"the harp, which was the foundation of the\r\nEgyptian orchestra, is an essentially non-chromatic instrument,\r\nand could therefore only play a straight up and down diatonic\r\nscale.\" Continuing he says, \"It is plain therefore that the\r\nEgyptian harmony was purely diatonic; such a thing as modern\r\nmodulation was unknown, and every piece from beginning to end\r\nwas played in the same key.\" That this position is utterly\r\nuntenable is very evident, for there was nothing to prevent\r\nthe Egyptians from tuning their harps in the same order of\r\ntones and half tones as is used for our modern pianos. That\r\nthis is even probable may be assumed from the scale of a flute\r\ndating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth century B.C. (1700\r\nor 1600 B.C.), which was found in the royal tombs at Thebes,\r\nand which is now in the Florence Museum.\r\n\r\nIts scale was\r\n\r\n    [G: (a a+ b c' c+' d') (a' a+' b' c'' c+'' d'') (e'')\r\n        f'' f+'' g'' g+'' (a'' a+'' b'' c''' c+''' d''')]\r\n\r\nThe only thing about which we may be reasonably certain in\r\nregard to Egyptian music is that, like Egyptian architecture,\r\nit must have been very massive, on account of the preponderance\r\nin the orchestra of the low tones of the stringed instruments.\r\n\r\nThe sistrum was, properly speaking, not considered a musical\r\ninstrument at all. It was used only in religious ceremonies, and\r\nmay be considered as the ancestor of the bell that is rung at\r\nthe elevation of the Host in Roman Catholic churches. Herodotus\r\n(born 485 B.C.) tells us much about Egyptian music, how the\r\ngreat festival at Bubastis in honour of the Egyptian Diana\r\n(_Bast_ or _Pascht_), to whom the cat was sacred, was attended\r\nyearly by 700,000 people who came by water, the boats resounding\r\nwith the clatter of castanets, the clapping of hands, and the\r\nsoft tones of thousands of flutes. Again he tells us of music\r\nplayed during banquets, and speaks of a mournful song called\r\n_Maneros_. This, the oldest song of the Egyptians (dating back\r\nto the first dynasty), was symbolical of the passing away of\r\nlife, and was sung in connection with that gruesome custom\r\nof bringing in, towards the end of a banquet, an effigy of a\r\ncorpse to remind the guests that death is the birthright of\r\nall mankind, a custom which was adopted later by the Romans.\r\n\r\nHerodotus also gives us a vague but very suggestive glimpse\r\nof what may have been the genesis of Greek tragedy, for he was\r\npermitted to see a kind of nocturnal Egyptian passion play, in\r\nwhich evidently the tragedy of Osiris was enacted with ghastly\r\nrealism. Osiris, who represents the light, is hunted by Set or\r\nTyphon, the god of darkness, and finally torn to pieces by the\r\nfollowers of Set, and buried beneath the waters of the lake;\r\nHorus, the son of Osiris, avenges his death by subduing Set, and\r\nOsiris appears again as the ruler of the shadowland of death.\r\n\r\nThis strange tragedy took place at night, on the shore of\r\nthe lake behind the great temple at Sais. Osiris was dressed\r\nroyally, in white, and after the horrible pursuit and his\r\nmurder by Set and his sinister band, Horus, the rising sun,\r\ndispels the gloom, and a glorious new god of light appears. Set\r\nand his followers are driven back to the gloomy temple where,\r\nperhaps, there was another scene showing the shade of Osiris,\r\nenthroned and ruling the dead. We have no means of knowing the\r\ncharacter of the music which accompanied this mystery play;\r\nbut certainly the deep tones of the harps and the flutes,\r\ntogether with the chanting of men's voices, must have been\r\nappropriate. Add to these the almost silent rattle of the\r\nsistrum, which, for the Egyptians, possessed something of the\r\nsupernatural, and we have an orchestral colouring which is\r\nsuggestive, to say the least.\r\n\r\nWith this we will leave Egyptian music, simply calling attention\r\nto the works of Resellini, Lepsius, Wilkinson, and Petri,\r\nwhich contain copies of mural paintings and temple and tomb\r\nsculptures relating to music. For instance, pages 103, 106, and\r\n111 of Lepsius's third book, \"Die Denkmaeler aus Aegypten und\r\nAethiopen,\" will be found very interesting, particularly page\r\n106, which shows some of the rooms of the palace of Amenotep\r\nIV, of the eighteenth dynasty (about 1500 or 1600 B.C.),\r\nin which dancing and music is being taught. In the same work,\r\nsecond book, on pages 52 and 53, are pictures taken from a tomb\r\nnear Gizeh, showing harp and flute players and singers. The\r\nposition of the hands of the singers--they hold them behind\r\ntheir ears--is a manner of illustrating the act of hearing,\r\nand arises from the hieroglyphic _double_ way of putting things;\r\nfor instance, in writing hieroglyphics the word is often first\r\nspelled out, then comes another sign for the pronunciation,\r\nthen sometimes even two other signs to emphasize its meaning.\r\n\r\nThe music of the Assyrians may be summed up very briefly. All\r\nthat can be gathered from the bas-relief sculptures is that\r\nshrill tones and acute pitch must have characterized their\r\nmusic. As Rowbotham says, alluding to the Sardanapalus wall\r\nsculpture now in the British Museum in London, \"What can one\r\nthink of the musical delicacy of a nation the King of which,\r\ndining alone with his queen, chooses to be regaled with the\r\nsounds of a lyre and a big drum close at his elbow?\" The\r\ninstruments represented in these bas-reliefs, aside from the\r\ndrum, are high-pitched: flutes, pipes, trumpets, cymbals, and\r\nthe smaller stringed instruments. These were all portable,\r\nand some, such as drums and dulcimers, were strapped to the\r\nbody, all of which points to the eminently warlike character\r\nof the people. Instead of clapping the hands to mark the time\r\nas did the Egyptians, they stamped their feet. The dulcimer\r\nwas somewhat like a modern zither, and may be said to contain\r\nthe germ of our piano; for it was in the form of a flat case,\r\nstrapped to the body and held horizontally in front of the\r\nplayer. The strings were struck with a kind of plectrum,\r\nheld in the right hand, and were touched with the left hand\r\nimmediately afterwards to stop the vibration, just as the\r\ndampers in the pianoforte fall on the string the moment the\r\nkey is released. There existed among the Chaldeans a science\r\nof music, which, of course, is a very different thing from\r\npractical music, but it was so imbued with astronomical\r\nsymbolism that it seems hardly worth while to consider\r\nit here. The art of Babylonia and Assyria culminated in\r\narchitecture and bas-relief sculpture, and it is chiefly\r\nvaluable as being the germ from which Greek art was developed.\r\n\r\nIn considering Chinese music one has somewhat the same feeling\r\nas one would have in looking across a flat plain. There are no\r\nmountains in Chinese music, and there is nothing in its history\r\nto make us think that it was ever anything but a more or less\r\npuerile playing with sound; therefore there is no separating\r\nmodern Chinese music from that of antiquity. To be sure,\r\nConfucius (about 500 B.C.) said that to be well governed\r\na nation must possess good music. Pythagoras, Aristotle,\r\nand Plato, in Greece, said the same thing, and their maxims\r\nproved a very important factor in the music of ancient times,\r\nfor the simple reason that an art controlled by government can\r\nhave nothing very vital about it. Hebrew music was utterly\r\nannihilated by laws, and the poetic imagination thus pent\r\nup found its vent in poetry, the result being some of the\r\nmost wonderful works the world has ever known. In Egypt, this\r\ncurrent of inspiration from the very beginning was turned toward\r\narchitecture. In Greece, music became a mere stage accessory\r\nor a subject for the dissecting table of mathematics; in China,\r\nwe have the dead level of an obstinate adherence to tradition,\r\nthus proving Sir Thomas Browne's saying, \"The mortallest enemy\r\nunto knowledge, and that which hath done the greatest execution\r\nupon truth, hath been a peremptory adhesion unto tradition,\r\nand more especially the establishing of our own belief upon\r\nthe dictates of antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chinese theory is that there are eight different musical\r\nsounds in nature, namely:\r\n\r\n    1. The sound of skin.\r\n    2. The sound of stone.\r\n    3. The sound of metal.\r\n    4. The sound of clay.\r\n    5. The sound of silk.\r\n    6. The sound of wood.\r\n    7. The sound of bamboo.\r\n    8. The sound of gourd.\r\n\r\nThe sound of skin has a number of varieties, all different\r\nkinds of drums.\r\n\r\nThe sound of stone is held by the Chinese to be the most\r\nbeautiful among sounds, one between that of metal and of\r\nwood. The principal instrument in this category is the _king_,\r\nand in mythology it is the chosen instrument of Kouei, the\r\nChinese Orpheus. This instrument has a large framework on which\r\nare hung sixteen stones of different sizes, which are struck,\r\nlike drums, with a kind of hammer. According to Amiot, only\r\na certain kind of stone found near the banks of the river\r\nTee will serve for the making of these instruments, and in\r\nthe year 2200 B.C. the Emperor Yu assessed the different\r\nprovinces so many stones each for the palace instruments,\r\nin place of tribute.\r\n\r\nThe sound of metal is embodied in the various kinds of bells,\r\nwhich are arranged in many different series, sometimes after\r\nthe patterns of the _king_, while sometimes they are played\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe sound of clay, or baked earth, is given by a kind of round\r\negg made of porcelain--for that is what it amounts to--pierced\r\nwith five holes and a mouthpiece, upon blowing through which\r\nthe sound is produced--an instrument somewhat suggestive of\r\nour ocarina.\r\n\r\nThe sound of silk is given by two instruments: one a kind of\r\nflat harp with seven strings, called _che_, the other with\r\ntwenty-five strings, called _kin_, in size from seven to nine\r\nfeet long. The ancient form of this instrument is said to have\r\nhad fifty strings.\r\n\r\nThe sound of wood is a strange element in a Chinese orchestra,\r\nfor it is produced in three different ways: first, by an\r\ninstrument in the form of a square wooden box with a hole in one\r\nof its sides through which the hand, holding a small mallet,\r\nis inserted, the sound of wood being produced by hammering\r\nwith the mallet on the inside walls of the box, just as the\r\nclapper strikes a bell. This box is placed at the northeast\r\ncorner of the orchestra, and begins every piece. Second, by a\r\nset of strips of wood strung on a strap or cord, the sound of\r\nwhich is obtained by beating the palm of the hand with them.\r\nThe third is the strangest of all, for the instrument consists\r\nof a life-size wooden tiger. It has a number of teeth or pegs\r\nalong the ridge of its back, and it is \"played\" by stroking\r\nthese pegs rapidly with a wooden staff, and then striking the\r\ntiger on the head. This is the prescribed end of every Chinese\r\norchestral composition, and is supposed to be a symbol of man's\r\nsupremacy over brute creation. The tiger has its place in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the orchestra.\r\n\r\nThe sound of bamboo is represented in the familiar form of\r\nPan's pipes, and various forms of flutes which hardly need\r\nfurther description.\r\n\r\nAnd finally the sound of the gourd. The gourd is a kind of\r\nsquash, hollowed out, in which from thirteen to twenty-four\r\npipes of bamboo or metal are inserted; each one of these\r\npipes contains a metal reed, the vibration of which causes\r\nthe sound. Below the reed are cut small holes in the pipes,\r\nand there is a pipe with a mouthpiece to keep the gourd,\r\nwhich is practically an air reservoir, full of air. The air\r\nrushing out through the bamboo pipes will naturally escape\r\nthrough the holes cut below the reeds, making no sound, but\r\nif the finger stops one or more of these holes, the air is\r\nforced up through the reeds, thus giving a musical sound,\r\nthe pitch of which will be dependent on the length of the\r\npipes and the force with which the air passes through the reed.\r\n\r\nOther instruments of the Chinese are gongs of all sizes,\r\ntrumpets, and several stringed instruments somewhat akin to our\r\nguitars and mandolins. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese\r\nhave ever seemed to consider the voice as partaking of the\r\nnature of music. This is strange, for the language of the\r\nChinese depends on flexibility of the voice to make it even\r\nintelligible. As a matter of fact, singing, in our sense of\r\nthe word, is unknown to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE CHINESE (Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving described the musical instruments in use in China\r\nwe still have for consideration the music itself, and the\r\nconditions which led up to it.\r\n\r\nAmong the Chinese instruments mentioned in the preceding\r\nchapter, the preponderance of instruments of percussion, such\r\nas drums, gongs, bells, etc., has probably been noticed. In\r\nconnection with the last named we meet with one of the two cases\r\nin Chinese art in which we see the same undercurrent of feeling,\r\nor rather superstition, as that found among western nations. We\r\nread in the writings of Mencius, the Chinese philosopher (350\r\nB.C.), the following bit of gossip about the king Senen of Tse.\r\n\r\n  \"The king,\" said he, \"was sitting aloft in the hall, when\r\n  a man appeared, leading an ox past the lower part of it.\r\n  The king saw him, and asked, 'Where is the ox going?'\r\n\r\n  \"The man replied, 'We are going to consecrate a bell with\r\n  its blood.'\r\n\r\n  \"The king said, 'Let it go. I cannot bear its frightened\r\n  appearance as if it were an innocent person going to the\r\n  place of death.'\r\n\r\n  \"The man answered, 'Shall we then omit the consecration\r\n  of the bell?'\r\n\r\n  \"The king said, 'How can that be omitted? Change the ox\r\n  for a sheep.'\"\r\n\r\nAs stated before, this is one of the few cases in which Chinese\r\nsuperstition coincides with that of the West; for our own church\r\nbells were once consecrated in very much the same manner, a\r\nsurvival of that ancient universal custom of sacrifice. With\r\nthe exception of this resemblance, which, however, has nothing\r\nto do with actual music, everything in Chinese art is exactly\r\nthe opposite of our western ideas on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese orchestra is composed of about sixteen different\r\ntypes of percussion instruments and four kinds of wind and\r\nstringed instruments, whereas in our European orchestras the\r\nratio is exactly reversed. Their orchestras are placed at\r\nthe back of the stage, ours in front of it. The human voice\r\nis not even mentioned in their list of musical sounds (sound\r\nof metal, baked clay, wood, skin, bamboo, etc)., whereas we\r\nconsider it the most nearly perfect instrument existing. This\r\nstrange perversity once caused much discussion in days when\r\nwe knew less of China than we do at present, as to whether\r\nthe Chinese organs of hearing were not entirely different from\r\nthose of western nations. We now know that this contradiction\r\nruns through all their habits of life. With them white is the\r\ncolour indicative of mourning; the place of honour is on the\r\nleft hand; the seat of intellect is in the stomach; to take off\r\none's hat is considered an insolent gesture; the magnetic needle\r\nof the Chinese compass is reckoned as pointing south, instead of\r\nnorth; even up to the middle of the nineteenth century the chief\r\nweapon in war was the bow and arrow, although they were long\r\nbefore acquainted with gunpowder--and so on, _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that the drum is the most primitive instrument\r\nknown to man. If all our knowledge of the Chinese were included\r\nin a simple list of their orchestral instruments, we should\r\nrecognize at once that the possession of the gourd, mouth-organ,\r\nand lute indicates a nation which has reached a high state of\r\ncivilization; on the other hand, the great preponderance of\r\nbells, gongs, drums, etc., points unmistakably to the fact\r\nthat veneration of the laws and traditions of the past (a\r\npast of savage barbarism), and a blind acquiescence in them,\r\nmust constitute the principal factor in that civilization. The\r\nwritings of Chinese philosophers are full of wise sayings\r\nabout music, but in practice the music itself becomes almost\r\nunbearable. For instance, in the Confucian _Analects_ we read,\r\n\"The Master (Confucius)[02] said: 'How to play music may be\r\nknown. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should\r\nsound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony,\r\nseverally distinct, and flowing without a break, and thus on\r\nto the conclusion.'\" The definition is certainly remarkable\r\nwhen one considers that it was given about five hundred\r\nyears before our era. In practice, however, the Chinese do\r\nnot distinguish between musical _combinations_ of sound and\r\n_noise_; therefore the above definition must be taken in a very\r\ndifferent sense from that which ordinarily would be the case. By\r\nharmony, Confucius evidently means similarity of noises, and by\r\n\"melody flowing without a break\" he means absolute monotony of\r\nrhythm. We know this from the hymns to the ancestors which,\r\nwith the hymns to the Deity, are the sacred songs of China,\r\nsongs which have come down from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nAccording to Amiot one of the great court functions is the\r\nsinging of the \"Hymn to the Ancestors,\" which is conducted\r\nby the Emperor. Outside the hall where this ceremony takes\r\nplace are stationed a number of bell and gong players who\r\nmay not enter, but who, from time to time, according to fixed\r\nlaws, join in the music played and sung inside. In the hall\r\nthe orchestra is arranged in the order prescribed by law:\r\nthe _ou_, or wooden tiger, which ends every piece, is placed\r\nat the northwest end of the orchestra, and the _tschou_, or\r\nwooden box-drum, which begins the music, at the northeast;\r\nin the middle are placed the singers who accompany the hymn\r\nby posturing as well as by chanting. At the back of the hall\r\nare pictures of the ancestors, or merely tablets inscribed\r\nwith their names, before which is a kind of altar, bearing\r\nflowers and offerings. The first verse of the hymn consists of\r\neight lines in praise of the godlike virtues of the ancestors,\r\nwhose spirits are supposed to descend from Heaven and enter\r\nthe hall during the singing of this verse by the chorus. Then\r\nthe Emperor prostrates himself three times before the altar,\r\ntouching his head to the earth each time. As he offers the\r\nlibations and burns the perfumes on the altar, the chorus\r\nsings the second verse of eight lines, in which the spirits\r\nare thanked for answering the prayer and entreated to accept\r\nthe offerings. The Emperor then prostrates himself nine times,\r\nafter which he resumes his position before the altar, while\r\nthe last verse of eight lines, eulogistic of the ancestors,\r\nis being chanted; during this the spirits are supposed to\r\nascend again to Heaven. The hymn ends with the scraping of\r\nthe tiger's back and striking it on the head.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the partial gloom of this species of chapel,\r\nlighted by many burning, smoky joss-sticks, with its glint\r\nof many-coloured silks, and gold embroidery; the whining,\r\nnasal, half-spoken, monotonous drone of the singers with their\r\nwrithing figures bespangled with gold and vivid colour; the\r\nincessant stream of shrill tones from the wind instruments;\r\nthe wavering, light clatter of the musical stones broken\r\nby the steady crash of gongs and the deep booming of large\r\ndrums; while from outside, the most monstrous bell-like noises\r\nvaguely penetrate the smoke-laden atmosphere. The ceremony\r\nmust be barbarously impressive; the strange magnificence of it\r\nall, together with the belief in the actual presence of the\r\nspirits, which the vague white wreaths of joss-stick smoke\r\nhelp to suggest, seem to lend it dignity. From the point of\r\nview of what we call music, the hymn is childish enough; but\r\nwe must keep in mind the definition of Confucius. According\r\nto the Chinese, music includes that phase of sound which we\r\ncall mere noise, and the harmonizing of this noise is Chinese\r\nart. We must admit, therefore, that from this point of view\r\ntheir orchestra is well balanced, for what will rhyme better\r\nwith noise than more noise? The gong is best answered by the\r\ndrum, and the tomtom by the great bell.\r\n\r\nChina also has its folk song, which seems to be an irrepressible\r\nflower of the field in all countries. This also follows the\r\nprecepts of the sages in using only the five-note or pentatonic\r\nscale found among so many other nationalities. It differs,\r\nhowever, from the official or religious music, inasmuch as\r\nthat unrhythmic perfection of monotony, so loved by Confucius,\r\nMencius, and their followers, is discarded in favour of a style\r\nmore naturally in touch with human emotion. These folk songs\r\nhave a strong similarity to Scotch and Irish songs, owing to\r\nthe absence of the fourth and seventh degrees of the scale.\r\nIf they were really sung to the accompaniment of chords, the\r\nresemblance would be very striking. The Chinese singing voice,\r\nhowever, is not sonorous, the quality commonly used being a\r\nkind of high, nasal whine, very far removed from what we call\r\nmusic. The accompaniment of the songs is of a character most\r\ndiscordant to European ears, consisting as it does mainly of\r\nconstant drum or gong beats interspersed with the shrill notes\r\nof the _kin_, the principal Chinese stringed instrument. Ambros,\r\nthe historian, quotes a number of these melodies, but falls\r\ninto a strange mistake, for his version of a folk song called\r\n\"_Tsin-fa_\" is as follows:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 01]\r\n\r\nNow this is exactly as if a Chinaman, wishing to give his\r\ncountrymen an idea of a Beethoven sonata, were to eliminate\r\nall the harmony and leave only the bare melody accompanied by\r\nindiscriminate beats on the gong and a steady banging on two or\r\nthree drums of different sizes. This is certainly the manner\r\nin which the little melody just quoted would be accompanied,\r\nand not by European chords and rhythms.\r\n\r\nIf we could eliminate from our minds all thoughts of music and\r\nbring ourselves to listen only to the _texture_ of sounds, we\r\ncould better understand the Chinese ideal of musical art. For\r\ninstance, if in listening to the deep, slow vibrations of a\r\nlarge gong we ignore completely all thought of pitch, fixing\r\nour attention only upon the roundness and fullness of the sound\r\nand the way it gradually diminishes in volume without losing\r\nany of its pulsating colour, we should then realize what the\r\nChinese call music. Confucius said, \"When the music master Che\r\nfirst entered on his office, the finish with the _Kwan-Ts'eu_\r\n(Pan's-pipes) was magnificent--how it filled the ears!\" And\r\nthat is just what Chinese music aims to do, it \"fills the ears\"\r\nand therefore is \"magnificent.\"[03]\r\n\r\nWith their views as to what constitutes the beautiful in music\r\nit is not strange that the Chinese find our music detestable. It\r\ngoes too fast for them. They ask, \"Why play another entirely\r\ndifferent kind of sound until one has already enjoyed to\r\nthe full what has gone before?\" As they told Pere Amiot\r\nmany years ago: \"Our music penetrates through the ear to the\r\nheart, and from the heart to the soul; that your music cannot\r\ndo.\" Amiot had played on a harpsichord some pieces by Rameau\r\n(\"_Les Cyclopes_,\" \"_Les Charmes_,\" etc.) and much flute music,\r\nbut they could make nothing of it.\r\n\r\nAccording to their conception of music, sounds must follow one\r\nanother slowly, in order to pass through the ears to the heart\r\nand thence to the soul; therefore they went back with renewed\r\nsatisfaction to their long, monotonous chant accompanied by\r\na pulsating fog of clangour.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, at the time of that sudden desire of China,\r\nor more particularly of Li Hung Chang, to know more of\r\noccidental civilization, some Chinese students were sent\r\nby their government to Berlin to study music. After about a\r\nmonth's residence in Berlin these students wrote to the Chinese\r\ngovernment asking to be recalled, as they said it would be\r\nfolly to remain in a barbarous country where even the most\r\nelementary principles of music had not yet been grasped.\r\n\r\nTo go deeply into the more technical side of Chinese music\r\nwould be a thankless task, for in the Chinese character\r\nthe practical is entirely overshadowed by the speculative.\r\nAll kinds of fanciful names are given to the different tones,\r\nand many strange ideas associated with them. Although our modern\r\nchromatic scale (all but the last half-tone) is familiar to\r\nthem, they have never risen to a practical use of it even to\r\nthis day. The Chinese scale is now, as it always has been,\r\none of five notes to the octave, that is to say, our modern\r\nmajor scale with the fourth and seventh omitted.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view, the instruments of bamboo attain\r\nan importance above all other Chinese instruments. According\r\nto the legend, the Pan's-pipes of bamboo regulated the tuning\r\nof all other instruments, and as a matter of fact the pipe\r\ngiving the note F, the universal tonic, is the origin of\r\nall measures also. For this pipe, which in China is called\r\nthe \"musical foot,\" is at the same time a standard measure,\r\nholding exactly twelve hundred millet seeds, and long enough\r\nfor one hundred millet seeds to stand end on end within it.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this consideration of the music of the\r\nChinese, I would draw attention to the unceasing repetition\r\nwhich constitutes a prominent feature in all barbarous or\r\nsemi-barbarous music. In the \"Hymn of the Ancestors\" this\r\nendless play on three or four notes is very marked.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 02]\r\n\r\nIn other songs it is equally apparent.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 03] etc.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 04]\r\n\r\n    [Figure 05] etc.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic is met with in the music of the American\r\nIndians, also in American street songs, in fact in all music of\r\na primitive nature, just as our school children draw caricatures\r\nsimilar to those made by great chiefs and medicine men in the\r\nheart of Africa, and, similarly, the celebrated \"graffiti\"\r\nof the Roman soldiers were precisely of the same nature as\r\nthe beginnings of Egyptian art. In art, the child is always\r\na barbarian more or less, and all strong emotion acting on\r\na naturally weak organism or a primitive nature brings the\r\nsame result, namely, that of stubborn repetition of one idea.\r\nAn example of this is Macbeth, who, in the very height of his\r\npassion, stops to juggle with the word \"sleep,\" and in spite\r\nof the efforts of his wife, who is by far the more civilized\r\nof the two, again and again recurs to it, even though he\r\nis in mortal danger. When Lady Macbeth at last breaks down,\r\nshe also shows the same trait in regard to her bloodstained\r\nhands. It is not so far from Scotland to the Polar regions,\r\nand there we find that when Kane captured a young Eskimo and\r\nkept him on his ship, the only sign of life the prisoner gave\r\nwas to sing over and over to himself the following:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 06]\r\n\r\nComing back again to civilization, we find Tennyson's Elaine, in\r\nher grief, repeating, incessantly the words, \"Must I then die.\"\r\n\r\nThe music of the Siamese, Burmese, Javanese, and Japanese has\r\nmuch in common with that of the Chinese, the difference between\r\nthe first two and the last named being mainly in the absence\r\nof the _king_, or musical stones, or rather the substitution\r\nof sets of drums in place of it. For instance, the Burmese\r\ndrum-organ, as it is called, consists of twenty-one drums\r\nof various sizes hung inside a great hoop. Their gong-organ\r\nconsists of fifteen or more gongs of different sizes strung\r\ninside a hoop in the same manner. The player takes his place\r\nin the middle of the hoop and strikes the drums or gongs\r\nwith a kind of stick. These instruments are largely used in\r\nprocessions, being carried by two men, just as a sedan chair is\r\nborne; the player, in order to strike all the gongs and bells,\r\nmust often walk backwards, or strike them behind his back.\r\n\r\nIn Javanese and Burmese music these sets of gongs and drums are\r\nused incessantly, and form a kind of high-pitched, sustained\r\ntone beneath which the music is played or sung.\r\n\r\nIn Siamese music the wind instruments have a prominent\r\nplace. After having heard the Siamese Royal Orchestra a number\r\nof times in London, I came to the conclusion that the players\r\non the different instruments _improvise_ their parts, the only\r\nrule being the general character of the melodies to be played,\r\nand the finishing together. The effect of the music was that\r\nof a contrapuntal nightmare, hideous to a degree which one who\r\nhas not heard it cannot conceive. Berlioz, in his \"Soirees de\r\nl'orchestre,\" well described its effect when he said:\r\n\r\n    \"After the first sensation of horror which one cannot\r\n    repress, one feels impelled to laugh, and this hilarity\r\n    can only be controlled by leaving the hall. So long\r\n    as these impossible sounds continue, the fact of their\r\n    being gravely produced, and in all sincerity _admired_\r\n    by the players, makes the 'concert' appear inexpressibly\r\n    'comic.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had the same Buddhistic disregard for euphony,\r\nbut they have adopted European ideas in music and are rapidly\r\nbecoming occidentalized from a musical point of view. Their\r\nprincipal instruments are the _koto_ and the _samisen_. The\r\nformer is similar to the Chinese _che_, and is a kind of large\r\nzither with thirteen strings, each having a movable bridge by\r\nmeans of which the pitch of the string may be raised or lowered.\r\nThe _samisen_ is a kind of small banjo, and probably originated\r\nin the Chinese _kin_.\r\n\r\nFrom Buddhism to sun worship, from China to Peru and Mexico,\r\nis a marked change, but we find strange resemblances in the\r\nmusic of these peoples, seeming almost to corroborate the\r\ntheory that the southern American races may be traced back to\r\nthe extreme Orient. We remember that in the Chinese sacred\r\nchants--\"official\" music as one may call it--all the notes\r\nwere of exactly the same length. Now Garcilaso de la Vega\r\n(1550), in his \"Commentarios Reales,\" tells us that unequal\r\ntime was unknown in Peru, that all the notes in a song were\r\nof exactly the same length. He further tells us that in his\r\ntime the voice was but seldom heard in singing, and that\r\nall the songs were played on the flute, the words being so\r\nwell known that the melody of the flute immediately suggested\r\nthem. The Peruvians were essentially a pipe race, while, on the\r\nother hand, the instruments of the Mexicans were of the other\r\nextreme, all kinds of drums, copper gongs, rattles, musical\r\nstones, cymbals, bells, etc., thus completing the resemblance\r\nto Chinese art. In Prescott's \"Conquest of Peru\" we may read\r\nof the beautiful festival of Raymi, or adoration of the sun,\r\nheld at the period of the summer solstice. It describes how the\r\nInca and his court, followed by the whole population of the\r\ncity, assembled at early dawn in the great square of Cuzco,\r\nand how, at the appearance of the first rays of the sun,\r\na great shout would go up, and thousands of wind instruments\r\nwould break forth into a majestic song of adoration. That the\r\nPeruvians were a gentler nation than the Mexicans can be seen\r\nfrom their principal instrument, the pipe.\r\n\r\nWhile it has been strenuously denied that on such occasions\r\nhuman sacrifices were offered in Peru, the Mexicans, that race\r\nwhose principal instruments were drums and brass trumpets,\r\nnot only held such sacrifices, but, strange to say, held\r\nthem in honour of a kind of god of music, Tezcatlipoca. This\r\nfestival was the most important in Mexico, and took place\r\nat the temple or \"teocalli,\" a gigantic, pyramid-like mass\r\nof stone, rising in terraces to a height of eighty-six feet\r\nabove the city, and culminating in a small summit platform\r\nupon which the long procession of priests and victims could\r\nbe seen from all parts of the city. Once a year the sacrifice\r\nwas given additional importance, for then the most beautiful\r\nyouth in Mexico was chosen to represent the god himself. For\r\na year before the sacrifice he was dressed as Tezcatlipoca,\r\nin royal robes and white linen, with a helmet-like crown of\r\nsea shells with white cocks' plumes, and with an anklet hung\r\nwith twenty gold bells as a symbol of his power, and he was\r\nmarried to the most beautiful maiden in Mexico. The priests\r\ntaught him to play the flute, and whenever the people heard\r\nthe sound of it they fell down and worshipped him.\r\n\r\nThe account may be found in Bancroft's great work on the\r\n\"Native Races of the Pacific,\" also Sahagun's \"Nueva Espana\r\nand Bernal Diaz,\" but perhaps the most dramatic description\r\nis that by Rowbotham:\r\n\r\n    And when the morning of the day of sacrifice arrived,\r\n    he was taken by water to the Pyramid Temple where he\r\n    was to be sacrificed, and crowds lined the banks of the\r\n    river to see him in the barge, sitting in the midst of\r\n    his beautiful companions. When the barge touched the\r\n    shore, he was taken away from those companions of his\r\n    forever, and was delivered over to a band of priests,\r\n    exchanging the company of beautiful women for men\r\n    clothed in black mantles, with long hair matted with\r\n    blood--their ears also were mangled. These conducted\r\n    him to the steps of the pyramid, and he was driven\r\n    up amidst a crowd of priests, with drums beating and\r\n    trumpets blowing. As he went up he broke an earthen\r\n    flute on every step to show that his love, and his\r\n    delights were over. And when he reached the top, he was\r\n    sacrificed on an altar of jasper, and the signal that\r\n    the sacrifice was completed was given to the multitudes\r\n    below by the rolling of the great sacrificial drum.[04]\r\n\r\n\r\n[02] _Kong_. His disciples called him _Fu Tsee_, or \"the\r\n     master\"; Jesuit missionaries Latinized this to Confucius.\r\n\r\n[03] The Chinese theatre has been called an unconscious\r\n     parody of our old-fashioned Italian opera, and there\r\n     are certainly many resemblances. In a Chinese play,\r\n     when the situation becomes tragic, or when one of the\r\n     characters is seized with some strong emotion, it finds\r\n     vent in a kind of aria. The dialogue is generally given\r\n     in the most monotonous manner possible--using only\r\n     high throat and head tones, occasionally lowering or\r\n     raising the voice on a word, to express emotion. This\r\n     monotonous, and to European ears, strangely nonchalant,\r\n     nasal recitative, is being continually interrupted by\r\n     gong pounding and the shrill, high sound of discordant\r\n     reed instruments. When one or more of the characters\r\n     commits suicide (which as we know is an honoured custom\r\n     in China) he sings--or rather whines--a long chant before\r\n     he dies, just as his western operatic colleagues do, as,\r\n     for instance, Edgar in \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" and even,\r\n     to come nearer home, Siegfried in \"Goetterdaemmerung.\"\r\n\r\n[04] This drum was made of serpents' skins, and the sound of\r\n     it was so loud that it could be heard eight miles away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF GREECE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first name of significance in Greek music is that of\r\nHomer. The hexameters of \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\" were\r\nquite probably chanted, but the four-stringed lyre which we\r\nassociate with the ancient Greek singers was only used for\r\na few preluding notes--possibly to pitch the voice of the\r\nbard--and not during the chant itself. For whatever melody\r\nthis chant possessed, it depended entirely upon the raising\r\nand lowering of the voice according to the accent of the words\r\nand the dramatic feeling of the narrative. For its rhythm\r\nit depended upon that of the hexameter, which consists of\r\na line of six dactyls and spondees, the line always ending\r\nwith a spondee. Really the line should end with a dactyl\r\n([- ' ']) and a spondee ([- -]). If a line ends with two\r\nspondees it is a spondaic hexameter.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would seem that while the pitch of the chant would\r\nbe very difficult to gauge, owing to the diversity of opinion as\r\nto how to measure in actual sounds the effect of emotions upon\r\nthe human voice, at least the _rhythm_ of the chants would be\r\nwell defined, owing to the hexameter in which the latter were\r\nwritten. Here again, however, we are cast adrift by theory,\r\nfor in practice nothing could be more misleading than such a\r\ndeduction. For instance, the following lines from Longfellow's\r\n\"Evangeline\" are both in this metre, although the rhythm of\r\none differs greatly from that of the other.\r\n\r\n    Wearing her Norman cap, and her kirtle of blue, and the earrings\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    Shielding the house from storms, on the north were the barns\r\n          and the farm-yard.\r\n\r\nNow if we think that these lines can be sung to the same\r\nmusical rhythm we are very far from the truth, although both\r\nare hexameters, namely,\r\n\r\n    [- ' ' - ' - ' ' - ' ' - ' ' - -]\r\n\r\n    [- ' ' - ' - ' ' - ' ' - ' ' - -]\r\n\r\ndactyls, ending with spondee.\r\n\r\nThus we see that metre in verse and rhythm in music are two\r\ndifferent things, although of course they both had the same\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nAfter all has been said, it is perhaps best to admit that, so\r\nfar as Greek music is concerned, its better part certainly lay\r\nin poetry. In ancient times all poetry was sung or chanted; it\r\nwas what I have called impassioned speech. The declamation of\r\n\"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\" constituted what was really the\r\n\"vocal\" music of the poems. With the Greeks the word \"music\"\r\n(_mousike_) included all the aesthetic culture that formed part\r\nof the education of youth; in the same general way a poet was\r\ncalled a singer, and even in Roman times we find Terence, in\r\nhis \"Phormio,\" alluding to poets as musicians. That Aeschylus\r\nand Sophocles were not musicians, as we understand the term,\r\nis very evident in spite of the controversies on the subject.\r\n\r\nImpassioned speech, then, was all that existed of vocal music,\r\nand as such was in every way merely the audible expression of\r\npoetry. I have no doubt that this is the explanation of the\r\nstatement that Aeschylus and Sophocles wrote what has been\r\ntermed the _music_ to their tragedies. What they really did\r\nwas to teach the chorus the proper declamation and stage\r\naction. It is well known that at the Dionysian Festival\r\nit was to the poet as \"chorus master\" that the prize was\r\nawarded, so entirely were the arts identified one with the\r\nother. That declamation may often reach the power of music,\r\nit is hardly necessary to say. Among modern poets, let any\r\none, for instance, look at Tennyson's \"Passing of Arthur\" for\r\nan example of this kind of music; the mere sound of the words\r\ncompletes the picture. For instance, when Arthur is dying and\r\ngives his sword, Excalibur, to Sir Bedivere with the command\r\nto throw it into the mere, the latter twice fails to do so,\r\nand returns to Arthur telling him that all he saw was\r\n\r\n   \"The water lapping on the crag\r\n    And the long ripple washing in the reeds.\"\r\n\r\nBut when at last he throws it, the magic sword\r\n\r\n   \"Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon\r\n    And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch\r\n    Shot like a streamer of the northern morn.\r\n    So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, when Sir Bedivere, carrying the dying king, stumbles\r\nup over the icy rocks to the shore, his armour clashing\r\nand clanking, the verse uses all the clangour of cr--ck, the\r\nslipping s's too, and the vowel _a_ is used in all its changes;\r\nwhen the shore is finally reached, the verse suddenly turns\r\ninto smoothness, the long _o_'s giving the same feeling of\r\nbreadth and calm that modern music would attempt if it treated\r\nthe same subject.\r\n\r\nHere are the lines:\r\n\r\n    Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves\r\n    And barren chasms, and all to left and right\r\n    The bare, black cliff clang'd round him as he based\r\n    His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang\r\n    Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels.\r\n    And on a sudden, lo! the level lake\r\n    And the long glories of the winter moon.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the earlier Greek plays, we must imagine\r\nthe music of the words themselves, the cadenced voices of\r\nthe protagonist or solitary performer, and the chorus, the\r\nlatter keeping up a rhythmic motion with the words. This,\r\nI am convinced, was the extent of Greek music, so far as that\r\nwhich was ascribed to the older poets is concerned.\r\n\r\nInstrumental music was another thing, and although we possess\r\nno authentic examples of it, we know what its scales consisted\r\nof and what instruments were in use. It would be interesting\r\nto pass in review the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles,\r\nthe odes of Sappho and Pindar, those of the latter having a\r\nnovel periodicity of form which gives force to the suggestion\r\nthat these choric dances were the forerunners of our modern\r\ninstrumental forms.\r\n\r\nSuch matters, however, take us from our actual subject, and we\r\nwill therefore turn to Pythagoras, at Crotona, in Italy (about\r\n500 B.C.), whom we find already laying down the rules forming\r\na mathematical and scientific basis for the Greek musical scale.\r\n\r\nMore than three centuries had passed since Homer had chanted\r\nhis \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey,\" and in the course of the succeeding\r\nfifty years some of the master spirits of the world were to\r\nappear. When we think of Pythagoras, Gautama, Buddha, Confucius,\r\nAeschylus, Sophocles, Sappho, Pindar, Phidias, and Herodotus as\r\ncontemporaries--and this list might be vastly extended--it seems\r\nas if some strange wave of ideality had poured over mankind.\r\nIn Greece, however, Pythagoras's theory of metempsychosis\r\n(doctrine of the supposed transmigration of the soul from\r\none body to another) was not strong enough to make permanent\r\nheadway, and his scientific theories unhappily turned music\r\nfrom its natural course into the workshop of science, from\r\nwhich Aristoxenus in vain attempted to rescue it.\r\n\r\nAt that time Homer's hexameter had begun to experience many\r\nchanges, and from the art of rhythm developed that of rhyme and\r\nform. The old lyre, from having four strings, was developed by\r\nTerpander, victor in the first musical contest at the feast\r\nof Apollo Carneius, into an instrument of seven strings, to\r\nwhich Pythagoras[05] added an eighth, Theophrastus a ninth,\r\nand so on until the number of eighteen was reached.\r\n\r\nFlute and lyre playing had attained a high state of excellence,\r\nfor we hear that Lasus, the teacher of the poet Pindar\r\n(himself the son of a Theban flute player), introduced into\r\nlyre playing the runs and light passages which, until that time,\r\nit had been thought possible to produce only on the flute.\r\n\r\nThe dance also had undergone a wonderful development\r\nrhythmically; for even in Homer's time we read in \"The Odyssey\"\r\nof the court of Alcinoues at Phocaea, how two princes danced\r\nbefore Ulysses and played with a scarlet ball, one throwing\r\nit high in the air, the other always catching it with his\r\nfeet off the ground; and then changing, they flung the ball\r\nfrom one to the other with such rapidity that it made the\r\nonlookers dizzy. During the play, Demidocus chanted a song,\r\nand accompanied the dance with his lyre, the players never\r\nlosing a step. As Aristides (died 468 B.C.), speaking of\r\nGreek music many centuries later said: \"Metre is not a thing\r\nwhich concerns the ear alone, for in the dance it is to be\r\n_seen_.\" Even a statue was said to have silent rhythm, and\r\npictures were spoken of as being musical or unmusical.\r\n\r\nAlready in Homer's time, the Cretans had six varieties of\r\n[5/4] time to which they danced:\r\n\r\n  [4 8 4 | 4 8 8 8 | 8 4 8 8 | 8 8 4 8 | 8 8 8 4 | 8 8 8 8 8]\r\n  [- ' - | - ' ' ' | ' - ' ' | ' ' - ' | ' ' ' - | ' ' ' ' ']\r\n\r\nThe first was known as the Cretic foot, being in a way the model\r\nor type from which the others were made; but the others were\r\ncalled paeons. The \"Hymn to Apollo\" was called a paeon or paean,\r\nfor the singers danced in Cretic rhythms as they chanted it.\r\n\r\nThere were many other dances in Greece, each having its\r\ncharacteristic rhythm. For instance, the Molossian dance\r\nconsisted of three long steps, [- - -] ([3/2]); that of the\r\nLaconians was the dactyl, [- ' '] ([4/4]), which was sometimes\r\nreversed [' ' -] ([4/4]). In the latter form it was also the\r\nchief dance of the Locrians, the step being called anapaest.\r\nFrom Ionia came the two long and two short steps, [- - ' '],\r\n([3/4: 4 4 8 8]), or [' ' - -] ([3/4: 8 8 4 4]), which were\r\ncalled Ionic feet. The Doric steps consisted primarily of a\r\ntrochee and a spondee, [- ' - -] or [7/8] time. These values,\r\nhowever, were arranged in three other different orders, namely,\r\n[' - - - | - - ' - | - - - '] and were called the first,\r\nsecond, third, or fourth epitrite, according to the positions\r\nof the short step. The second epitrite was considered the most\r\ndistinctly Doric.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Dionysian[06] festivals in Greece threatened\r\nto destroy art, for those wild Bacchic dances, which are to\r\nbe traced back to that frenzied worship of Bel and Astarte\r\nin Babylon, wild dances amenable only to the impulse of the\r\nmoment, seemed to carry everything before them. Instead of that,\r\nhowever, the hymns to Bacchus, who was called in Phoenicia\r\nthe flute god, from which the characteristics of his worship\r\nare indicated, were the germs from which tragedy and comedy\r\ndeveloped, and the mad bacchanalian dances were tamed into\r\ndithyrambs. For the Corybantes, priests of the goddess Cybele,\r\nbrought from Phrygia, in Asia Minor, the darker form of this\r\nworship; they mourned for the death of Bacchus, who was supposed\r\nto die in winter and to come to life again in the spring. When\r\nthese mournful hymns were sung, a goat was sacrificed on the\r\naltar; thus the origin of the word \"tragedy\" or \"goat song\"\r\n(_tragos_, goat, and _odos_, singer). As the rite developed,\r\nthe leader of the chorus would chant the praises of Dionysus,\r\nand sing of his adventures, to which the chorus would make\r\nresponse. In time it became the custom for the leader,\r\nor coryphaeus, to be answered by one single member of the\r\nchorus, the latter being thus used merely for the chanting\r\nof commentaries on the narrative. The answerer was called\r\n\"hypocrite,\" afterward the term for actor.\r\n\r\nThis was the material from which Aeschylus created the\r\nfirst tragedy, as we understand the term. Sophocles (495-406\r\nB.C.) followed, increasing the number of actors, as did also\r\nEuripides (480-406 B.C.).\r\n\r\nComedy (_komos_, revel, and _odos_, singer) arose from the\r\nspring and summer worship of Bacchus, when everything was a\r\njest and Nature smiled again.\r\n\r\nThe dithyramb (_dithyrambos_ or Bacchic step, [- ' ' -])\r\nbrought a new step to the dance and therefore a new element\r\ninto poetry, for all dances were choric, that is to say they\r\nwere sung as well as danced.\r\n\r\nArion was the first to attempt to bring the dithyramb into\r\npoetry, by teaching the dancers to use a slower movement and to\r\nobserve greater regularity in their various steps. The Lydian\r\nflute, as may be supposed, was the instrument which accompanied\r\nthe dithyramb, associated with all kinds of harsh, clashing\r\ninstruments, such as cymbals, tambourines, castanets. These\r\nArion tried to replace by the more dignified Grecian lyre;\r\nbut it was long before this mad dance sobered down to regular\r\nrhythm and form. From Corinth, where Arion first laboured,\r\nwe pass to Sicyon, where the taming of the dithyramb into an\r\nart form was accomplished by Praxilla, a poetess who added a\r\nnew charm to the lilt of this Bacchic metre, namely, rhyme.\r\n\r\nAnd this newly acquired poetic wealth was in keeping with\r\nthe increasing luxury and magnificence of the cities, for\r\nwe read in Athenaeus and Diodorus that Agrigentum sent to\r\nthe Olympic games three hundred chariots, drawn by white\r\nhorses. The citizens wore garments of cloth of gold, and even\r\ntheir household ornaments were of gold and silver; in their\r\nhouses they had wine cellars which contained three hundred\r\nvats, each holding a hundred hogsheads of wine. In Sybaris\r\nthis luxury reached its height, for the Sybarites would not\r\nallow any trade which caused a disagreeable sound, such as\r\nthat of the blacksmith, carpenter, or mason, to be carried on\r\nin their city limits. They dressed in garments of deep purple,\r\ntied their hair in gold threads, and the city was famed for\r\nits incessant banqueting and merrymaking. It was such luxury\r\nas this that Pindar found at the court of Hiero, at Syracuse,\r\nwhither Aeschylus had retired after his defeat by Sophocles\r\nat the Dionysian Festival at Athens.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Bacchus being at its height at that time, it may\r\nbe imagined that wine formed the principal element of their\r\nfeasts. And even as the dithyramb had been pressed into the\r\nservice of poetry, so was drinking made rhythmic by music. For\r\neven the wine was mixed with water according to musical ratios;\r\nfor instance, the paeonic or 3 to 2, [' ' ' -] = [8 8 8 4];\r\nthe iambic or 2 to 1, [- '] = [4 8]; dactylic or 2 to 2,\r\n[- ' '] = [4. 8 8]. The master of the feast decided the ratio,\r\nand a flute girl played a prescribed melody while the toast\r\nto good fortune, which commenced every banquet, was being\r\ndrunk. By the time the last note had sounded, the great cup\r\nshould have gone round the table and been returned to the\r\nmaster. And then they had the game of the cottabos, which\r\nconsisted of throwing the contents of a wine cup high in the\r\nair in such a manner that the wine would fall in a solid mass\r\ninto a metal basin. The winner was the one who produced the\r\nclearest musical sound from the basin.\r\n\r\nWe see from all this that music was considered rather\r\na beautiful plaything or a mere colour. By itself it was\r\nconsidered effeminate; therefore the early Greeks always had the\r\nflute player accompanied by a singer, and the voice was always\r\nused with the lyre to prevent the latter appealing directly\r\nto the senses. The dance was corrected in the same manner;\r\nfor when we speak of Greek dances, we always mean _choric_\r\ndances. Perhaps the nearest approach to the effect of what\r\nwe call music was made by Aeschylus, in the last scene of his\r\n\"Persians,\" when Xerxes and the chorus end the play with one\r\ncontinued wail of sorrow. In this instance the words take\r\nsecond place, and the actual sound is depended upon for the\r\ndramatic effect.\r\n\r\nThe rise and fall of actual instrumental music in Greece may\r\nbe placed between 500 and 400 B.C. After the close of the\r\nPeloponnesian War (404 B.C.), when Sparta supplanted Athens as\r\nthe leader of Greece, art declined rapidly, and at the time\r\nof Philip of Macedon (328 B.C.) may be said to have been\r\npractically extinct. Then, in place of the dead ashes of art,\r\nthe cold fire of science arose; for we have such men as Euclid\r\n(300 B.C.) and his school applying mathematics to musical\r\nsounds, and a system of cold calculation to an art that had\r\nneeded all the warmth of emotional enthusiasm to keep it alive.\r\nThus music became a science. Had it not been for the little\r\nweeds of folk song which managed with difficulty to survive at\r\nthe foot of this arid dust heap, and which were destined to be\r\ntransformed and finally to bloom into such lovely flowers in\r\nour times, we might yet have been using the art to illustrate\r\nmathematical calculations.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Pythagoras was the first step in this\r\nclassification of sounds; and he went further than this, for\r\nhe also classified the _emotions_ affected by music. It was\r\ntherefore a natural consequence that in his teaching he should\r\nforbid music of an emotional character as injurious. When he\r\ncame to Crotona, it was to a city that vied with Agrigentum,\r\nSybaris, and Tarentum in luxury; its chief magistrate wore\r\npurple garments, a golden crown upon his head, and white\r\nshoes on his feet. It was said of Pythagoras that he had\r\nstudied twelve years with the Magi in the temples of Babylon;\r\nhad lived among the Druids of Gaul and the Indian Brahmins; had\r\ngone among the priests of Egypt and witnessed their most secret\r\ntemple rites. So free from care or passion was his face that\r\nhe was thought by the people to be Apollo; he was of majestic\r\npresence, and the most beautiful man they had ever seen. So\r\nthe people accepted him as a superior being, and his influence\r\nbecame supreme over science and art, as well as manners.\r\n\r\nHe gave the Greeks their first scientific analysis of sound.\r\nThe legend runs that, passing a blacksmith's shop and\r\nhearing the different sounds of the hammering, he conceived\r\nthe idea that sounds could be measured by some such means\r\nas weight is measured by scales, or distance by the foot\r\nrule. By weighing the different hammers, so the story goes,\r\nhe obtained the knowledge of harmonics or overtones, namely,\r\nthe fundamental, octave, fifth, third, etc. This legend, which\r\nis stated seriously in many histories of music, is absurd, for,\r\nas we know, the hammers would not have vibrated. The anvils\r\nwould have given the sound, but in order to produce the octave,\r\nfifth, etc., they would have had to be of enormous proportions.\r\nOn the other hand, the monochord, with which students in physics\r\nare familiar, was his invention; and the first mathematical\r\ndemonstrations of the effect on musical pitch of length of\r\ncord and tension, as well as the length of pipes and force of\r\nbreath, were his.\r\n\r\nThese mathematical divisions of the monochord, however,\r\neventually did more to stifle music for a full thousand years\r\nthan can easily be imagined. This division of the string\r\nmade what we call harmony impossible; for by it the major\r\nthird became a larger interval than our modern one, and the\r\nminor third smaller. Thus thirds did not sound well together,\r\nin fact were dissonances, the only intervals which _did_\r\nharmonize being the fourth, fifth, and octave. This system\r\nof mathematically dividing tones into equal parts held good\r\nup to the middle of the sixteenth century, when Zarlino, who\r\ndied in 1590, invented the system in use at the present time,\r\ncalled the _tempered scale_, which, however, did not come into\r\ngeneral use until one hundred years later.\r\n\r\nAristoxenus, a pupil of Aristotle, who lived more than a\r\ncentury after Pythagoras, rejected the monochord as a means for\r\ngauging musical sounds, believing that the ear, not mathematical\r\ncalculation, should be the judge as to which interval sounds\r\n\"perfect.\" But he was unable to formulate a system that\r\nwould bring the third (and naturally its inversion the sixth)\r\namong the harmonizing intervals or consonants. Didymus (about\r\n30 B.C.) first discovered that two different-sized whole\r\ntones were necessary in order to make the third consonant;\r\nand Ptolemy (120 A.D.) improved on this system somewhat. But\r\nthe new theory remained without any practical effect until\r\nnearly the seventeenth century, when the long respected theory\r\nof the perfection of mathematical calculation on the basis of\r\nnatural phenomena was overthrown in favour of actual effect. If\r\nAristoxenus had had followers able to combat the crushing\r\ninfluence of Euclid and his school, music might have grown up\r\nwith the other arts. As it is, music is still in its infancy,\r\nand has hardly left its experimental stage.\r\n\r\nThus Pythagoras brought order into the music as well as\r\ninto the lives of people. But whereas it ennobled the\r\npeople, it killed the music, the one vent in life through\r\nwhich unbounded utterance is possible; its essence is so\r\ninterwoven with spirituality that to tear it away and fetter\r\nit with human mathematics is to lower it to the level of mere\r\nutilitarianism. And so it was with Greek music, which was held\r\nsubordinate to metre, to poetry, to acting, and finally became\r\na term of contempt. Pythagoras wished to banish the flute,\r\nas Plato also did later, and the name of flute player was used\r\nas a reproach. I fancy this was because the flute, on account\r\nof its construction, could ignore the mathematical divisions\r\nprescribed for the stringed instruments, and therefore could\r\nindulge in purely emotional music. Besides, the flute was\r\nthe chosen instrument of the orgiastic Bacchic cult, and its\r\nassociations were those of unbridled license. To be sure, the\r\nvoice was held by no mathematical restrictions as to pitch;\r\nbut its music was held in check by the words, and its metre\r\nby dancing feet.\r\n\r\nHaving measured the musical intervals, there still remained\r\nthe task of classifying the different manners of singing which\r\nexisted in Greece, and using all their different notes to form\r\na general system. For just as in different parts of Greece\r\nthere existed different dances, the steps of which were known\r\nas Lydian, Ionian, Locrian, and Dorian feet, and so on, so the\r\nmelodies to which they were danced were known as being in the\r\nLydian, Ionian, Locrian, or Dorian scale or mode. In speaking\r\nof Hindu music, I explained that what we call a mode consists\r\nof a scale, and that one mode differs from another _only_ in\r\nthe position of the semitones in this scale. Now in ancient\r\nGreece there were in use over fifteen different modes, each one\r\ncommon to the part of the country in which it originated. At the\r\ntime of Pythagoras there were seven in general use: the Dorian,\r\nLydian, Aeolian or Locrian, Hypo- (or low) Lydian, Phrygian,\r\nHypo- (or low) Phrygian, and Mixolydian or mixed Lydian. The\r\ninvention of the latter is attributed to Sappho by Plutarch,\r\nquoting Aristoxenus.\r\n\r\nThese modes were all invested with individual characters\r\nby the Greeks, just as in the present day we say our major\r\nmode is happy, the minor sad. The Dorian mode was considered\r\nthe greatest, and, according to Plato, the only one worthy of\r\nmen. It was supposed to have a dignified, martial character. The\r\nLydian, on the other hand, was all softness, and love songs\r\nwere written in it. The Phrygian was of a violent, ecstatic\r\nnature, and was considered as being especially appropriate for\r\ndithyrambs, the metre for the wild bacchanalian dances. For\r\ninstance, Aristotle tells how Philoxenus attempted to set\r\ndithyrambic verse to the Dorian mode, and, failing, had to\r\nreturn to the Phrygian. The Mixolydian, which was Sappho's mode,\r\nwas the mode for sentiment and passion. The Dorian, Phrygian,\r\nand Lydian were the oldest modes.\r\n\r\nEach mode or scale was composed of two sets of four notes,\r\ncalled tetrachords, probably derived from the ancient form\r\nof the lyre, which in Homer's time is known to have had four\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\nLeaving the matter of actual pitch out of the question (for\r\nthese modes might be pitched high or low, just as our major\r\nor minor scale may be pitched in different keys), these three\r\nmodes were constructed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Greek      Dorian    (E F) G A   (B C) D E,\r\n                         that is, semitone, tone, tone.\r\n\r\n           /\r\n          |  Phrygian  D (E F) G   A (B C) D,\r\n          |              or F[#] (G[#] A) B   C[#] (D[#] E) F[#],\r\n  Asiatic |              that is, tone, semitone, tone.\r\n          |\r\n          |  Lydian    C D (E F)   G A (B C),\r\n           \\              that is, tone, tone, semitone.\r\n\r\nThus we see that a tetrachord commencing with a half-tone and\r\nfollowed by two whole tones was called a Dorian tetrachord;\r\none commencing with a tone, followed by a half-tone, and again\r\na tone, constituted a Phrygian tetrachord. The other modes\r\nwere as follows: In the Aeolian or Locrian the semitones occur\r\nbetween the second and third notes, and the fifth and sixth:\r\n[F: b, (c+ d) e (f+ g) a b]\r\nTheraclides Ponticus identifies the Hypodorian with the Aeolian,\r\nbut says that the name \"hypo-\" merely denoted a likeness to\r\nDoric, not to pitch. Aristoxenus denies the identity, and\r\nsays that the Hypodorian was a semitone below the Dorian or\r\nHypolydian. In the Hypophrygian, the semitones occur between\r\nthe third and fourth, and sixth and seventh degrees:\r\n[F: c+ d+ (e+ f+) g+ (a+ b) c+']\r\nIn the Hypolydian, the semitones occur between the fourth and\r\nfifth, and seventh and eighth: [F: e- f g (a b-) c' (d' e-')]\r\nThe Dorian (E), Phrygian (commencing on F[sharp] with the fourth\r\nsharped), and the Lydian (A[flat] major scale) modes we have\r\nalready explained. In the Mixolydian, the semitones occur\r\nbetween the first and second, and fourth and fifth degrees:\r\n[G: (a b-) c' (d' e-') f' g' a']\r\n\r\nAccording to the best evidence (in the works of Ptolemy,\r\n\"Harmonics,\" second book, and Aristides), these were\r\napproximately the actual pitch of the modes as compared one\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nAnd now the difficulty was to weld all these modes together\r\ninto one scale, so that all should be represented and yet not\r\nbe complicated by what we should call accidentals. This was\r\naccomplished in the following manner, by simple mathematical\r\nmeans:\r\n\r\nWe remember that the Dorian, which was the most greatly\r\nfavoured mode in Greece, was divided into two tetrachords of\r\nexactly the same proportions, namely, semitone, tone, tone. By\r\ntaking the lowest note of the Mixolydian, B, and forming a\r\nDorian tetrachord on it, B C D E were acquired. Adding to this\r\nanother Dorian tetrachord, E F G A (commencing on the last note\r\nof the first), and repeating the same series of tetrachords\r\nan octave higher, we have in all four Dorian tetrachords,\r\ntwo of which overlap the others. The two middle tetrachords,\r\nconstituting the original Dorian mode, were called _disjunct_,\r\nthe two outer ones which overlap the middle ones were called\r\n_conjunct_ or _synemmenon_ tetrachords.\r\n\r\nIf we consider this new scale from octave to octave, commencing\r\nwith the lowest note, that is to say from B to B, we find that\r\nit coincides exactly with the Mixolydian mode; therefore this\r\nwas called the Mixolydian octave. The octave in this scale\r\nfrom the second note, C to C, coincides exactly with the Lydian\r\nmode, and was called the Lydian octave; from the third note, D,\r\nup to its octave gives the Phrygian; from the fourth note, E,\r\nthe Dorian; from the fifth, F, the Hypolydian; from the sixth,\r\nG, the Hypophrygian; and from the seventh, A, the Aeolian\r\nor Hypodorian octave. Add one note to the lower end of this\r\nuniversal Greek scale, as it was called, and we see that the\r\nwhole tonal system was included within two octaves. To each of\r\nthe notes comprising it was given a name partly derived from\r\nits position in the tetrachords, and partly from the fingering\r\nemployed in lyre playing, as shown in the diagram on page 87.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen strings of the _kithara_ were tuned according to\r\nthis scale, and the A, recurring three times in it, acquired\r\nsomething of the importance of a tonic or key note. As yet,\r\nhowever, this scale allowed of no transposition of a mode to\r\nanother pitch; in order to accomplish this the second tetrachord\r\nwas used as the first of another similar system. Thus,\r\nconsidering the second tetrachord, E F G A, as first of the\r\nnew scale, it would be followed by A B[flat] C D, and the\r\ntwo disjunct tetrachords would be formed. Followed by the two\r\nupper conjunct tetrachords, and the _proslambanomenos_ added,\r\nour system on a new pitch would be complete. This procedure\r\nhas come down almost unchanged to our times; for we have but\r\ntwo modes, major and minor, which are used on every pitch,\r\nconstituting various keys. These Greek modes are the basis\r\non which all our modern ideas of tonality rest; for our major\r\nmode is simply the Greek Lydian, and our minor mode the Aeolian.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF NOTES IN THE GREEK SCALE\r\n\r\n                                                        disjunct\r\nAeolian.

Proslambanomenos, added tone.\r\n\r\nTo go into detailed explanation of the Greek enharmonic\r\nand chromatic pitch will scarcely be worth while, and I will\r\ntherefore merely add that the instruments were sometimes tuned\r\ndifferently, either to relieve the inevitable monotony of this\r\npurely diatonic scale or for purposes of modulation. A Dorian\r\ntetrachord is composed of semitone, tone, tone; to make it\r\nchromatic, it was changed as follows: [G: e' f' g-' a'] the\r\n_lichanos_, or index finger string, being lowered a semitone.\r\n\r\nThe enharmonic pitch consisted of tuning the _lichanos_ down\r\nstill further, almost a quarter-tone below the second string,\r\nor _parhypate_, thus making the tetrachord run quarter-tone,\r\nquarter-tone, two tones. Besides this, even in the diatonic,\r\nthe Greeks used what they called soft intervals; for example,\r\nwhen the tetrachord, instead of proceeding by semitone, tone,\r\ntone (which system was called the hard diatonic), was tuned\r\nto semitone, three-quarter-tone, and tone and a quarter. The\r\nchromatic pitch also had several forms, necessitating the use\r\nof small fractional tones as well as semitones.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the musical notation of the Greeks rests\r\nentirely on the authority of Alypius, and dates from about the\r\nfourth century A.D. That we could not be absolutely sure of\r\nthe readings of ancient Greek melodies, even if we possessed\r\nany, is evident from the fact that these note characters,\r\nwhich at first were derived from the signs of the zodiac,\r\nand later from the letters of the alphabet, indicate only the\r\nrelative pitch of the sounds; the rhythm is left entirely to\r\nthe metrical value of the words in the lines to be sung. Two\r\nsets of signs were used for musical notation, the vocal system\r\nconsisting of writing the letters of the alphabet in different\r\npositions, upside down, sideways, etc.\r\n\r\nOf the instrumental system but little is known, and that\r\nnot trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[05] The fundamental doctrine of the Pythagorean philosophy\r\n     was that the essence of all things rests upon musical\r\n     relations, that numbers are the principle of all that\r\n     exists, and that the world subsists by the rhythmical\r\n     order of its elements. The doctrine of the \"Harmony of\r\n     the spheres\" was based on the idea that the celestial\r\n     spheres were separated from each other by intervals\r\n     corresponding with the relative length of strings\r\n     arranged so as to produce harmonious tones.\r\n\r\n[06] Dionysus, the same as the Roman Bacchus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE ROMANS--THE EARLY CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art history of the world makes it clear to us that when\r\nthe art of a country turns to over-elaboration of detail\r\nand mechanical dexterity, when there is a general tendency\r\ntoward vividness of _impression_ rather than poignancy and\r\nvitality of _expression_, then we have the invariable sign\r\nof that decadence which inevitably drifts into revolution\r\nof one kind or another. Lasus (500 B.C.), who, as previously\r\nmentioned, was a great flute and lyre player as well as poet,\r\nbetrays this tendency, which reached its culmination under the\r\nRomans. Lasus was more of a virtuoso than a poet; he introduced\r\ninto Greece a new and florid style of lyre and harp playing;\r\nand it was he who, disliking the guttural Dorian pronunciation\r\nof the letter S, wrote many of his choric poems without using\r\nthis letter once in them. Pindar, his pupil, followed in his\r\nfootsteps. In many of his odes we find intricate metrical\r\ndevices; for instance, the first line of most of the odes\r\nis so arranged metrically that the same order of accents is\r\nmaintained whether the line be read backward or forward, the\r\nshort and long syllables falling into exactly the same places in\r\neither case. The line \"Hercules, the patron deity of Thebes,\"\r\nmay be taken as an example, [(- ' ' ' - )'( - ' ' ' -)]. Such\r\ndevices occur all through his poems. We find in them also that\r\nmagnificence of diction which is the forerunner of \"virtuosity\";\r\nfor he speaks of his song as \"a temple with pillars of gold,\r\ngold that glitters like blazing fire in the night time.\"\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Aristophanes (450-380 B.C.), the technique\r\nof poetry continued to advance. In \"The Frogs,\" \"The\r\nWasps,\" and \"The Birds\" are to be found marvels of skill in\r\nonomatopoetic[07] verse. His comedies called for many more\r\nactors than the tragedies had required, and the chorus was\r\nincreased from fifteen to twenty-four. Purple skins were\r\nspread across the stage, and the _parabasis_ (or topical song)\r\nand satire vied with the noble lines of Aeschylus and Sophocles\r\nfor favour with the public.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as might have been expected, instrumental music\r\nbecame more and more independent, and musicians, especially\r\nthe flute players, prospered; for we read in Suidas that they\r\nwere much more proficient and sought after than the lyre and\r\nkithara players. When they played, they stood in a conspicuous\r\nplace in the centre of the audience. Dressed in long, feminine,\r\nsaffron-coloured robes, with veiled faces, and straps round\r\ntheir cheeks to support the muscles of the mouth, they exhibited\r\nthe most startling feats of technical skill. Even women became\r\nflute players, although this was considered disgraceful.\r\nThe Athenians even went so far that they built a temple to the\r\nflute player Lamia, and worshipped her as Venus. The prices\r\npaid to these flute players surpassed even those given to\r\nvirtuosi in modern times, sometimes amounting to more than\r\none thousand dollars a day, and the luxury in which they lived\r\nbecame proverbial.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, Aristophanes of Alexandria (350 B.C.),\r\ncalled \"the grammarian,\" devised a means for indicating the\r\ninflection of the voice in speaking, by which the cadences\r\nwhich orators found necessary in impassioned speech could be\r\nclassified, at least to some extent. When the voice was to fall,\r\na downward stroke [\\] was placed above the syllable; when the\r\nvoice was to be raised, an upward stroke [/] indicated it;\r\nand when the voice was to rise and fall, the sign was [/\\],\r\nwhich has become our accent in music. These three signs are\r\nfound in the French language, in the accent _aigu_, or high\r\naccent, as in _passe_; the accent _grave_, or low accent,\r\nas in _sincere_; or _circonflexe_, as in _Phaon_. The use of\r\ndots[08] for punctuation is also ascribed to Aristophanes;\r\nand our dots in musical notation, as well as the use of commas\r\nto indicate breathings, may be traced to this system.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, all this tended toward technical skill and\r\nanalysis; what was lacking in inventive power it was sought\r\nto cover by wonderful execution. The mania for flute playing,\r\nfor instance, seemed to spread all over the world; later we\r\neven hear that the king of Egypt, Ptolemy Auletes (80-51 B.C.),\r\nCleopatra's father, was nicknamed \"the flute player.\"\r\n\r\nIn Rome, this lack of poetic vitality seemed evident from the\r\nbeginning; for while Greece was represented by the tragedy\r\nand comedy, the Romans' preference was for mere pantomime,\r\na species of farce of which they possessed three kinds:\r\n(1) The simple pantomime without chorus, in which the actors\r\nmade the plot clear to the audience by means of gestures and\r\ndancing. (2) Another which called for a band of instrumental\r\nmusicians on the stage to furnish an accompaniment to the\r\nacting of the pantomimist. (3) The chorus pantomime, in\r\nwhich the chorus and the orchestra were placed on the stage,\r\nsupplementing the gestures of the actors by singing a narrative\r\nof the plot of the pantomime, and playing on their instruments.\r\nThe latter also were expressive of the non-ideal character of\r\nthe pantomime, as is indicated by the fact that the orchestra\r\nwas composed of cymbals, gongs, castanets, foot castanets,\r\nrattles, flutes, bagpipes, gigantic lyres, and a kind of shell\r\nor crockery cymbals, which were clashed together.\r\n\r\nThe Roman theatre itself was not a place connected with the\r\nworship of the gods, as it was with the Greeks. The altar\r\nto Dionysus had disappeared from the centre of the orchestra,\r\nand the chorus, or rather the band, was placed upon the stage\r\nwith the actors. The bagpipe now appears for the first time in\r\nmusical history, although there is some question as to whether\r\nit was not known to the Assyrians. It represents, perhaps, the\r\nonly remnant of Roman music that has survived, for the modern\r\nItalian peasants probably play in much the same way as did their\r\nforefathers. The Roman pipes were bound with brass, and had\r\nabout the same power of tone as was obtained from the trumpet.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that an orchestra thus constituted would\r\nbe better adapted for making a great noise than for music,\r\nwhile the pantomime itself was of such a brutal nature that\r\nthe degradation of art may be said to have been complete. As\r\nthe decay of art in Egypt culminated under Ptolemy Auletes,\r\nso in Rome it culminated in the time of Caligula (12-41 A.D.),\r\nand Nero (37-68 A.D.).\r\n\r\nThe latter, as we learn from Suetonius, competed for prizes\r\nin the public musical contests, and was never without a slave\r\nat his elbow to warn him against straining his voice. In\r\nhis love of magnificence he resembled a Greek flute player,\r\nwith unbounded means to gratify it. His palace, the \"Golden\r\nHouse,\" had triple porticos a mile in length, and enclosed\r\na lake surrounded by buildings which had the appearance of a\r\ncity. Within its area were corn fields, vineyards, pastures,\r\nand woods containing many animals, both wild and tame. In\r\nother parts it was entirely overlaid with gold, and adorned\r\nwith jewels and mother-of-pearl. The porch was so high that\r\na colossal statue of himself, one hundred and twenty feet\r\nin height, stood in it. The supper rooms were vaulted, and\r\ncompartments of the ceiling, inlaid with ivory, were made to\r\nrevolve and scatter flowers; they also contained pipes which\r\nshed perfumes upon the guests.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolt under Vindex broke out (68 A.D.), a new\r\ninstrument had just been brought to Rome. Tertullian, Suetonius,\r\nand Vitruvius agree in calling it an organ. This instrument,\r\nwhich was the invention of Ctesibus of Alexandria, consisted\r\nof a set of pipes through which the air was made to vibrate\r\nby means of a kind of water pump operated by iron keys. It\r\nwas undoubtedly the direct ancestor of our modern organ. Nero\r\nintended to introduce these instruments into the Roman theatre.\r\nIn planning for his expedition against Vindex, his first\r\ncare was to provide carriages for his musical instruments;\r\nfor his intention was to sing songs of triumph after having\r\nquelled the revolt. He publicly vowed that if his power in the\r\nstate were reestablished, he would include a performance upon\r\norgans as well as upon flutes and bagpipes, in the exhibitions\r\nhe intended to institute in honour of his success.\r\n\r\nFrom a musical point of view, Suetonius's biography of Nero\r\nis interesting chiefly on account of its giving us glimpses\r\nof the life of a professional musician of those days. We read,\r\ntogether with many other details, that it was the custom for a\r\nsinger to lie on his back, with a sheet of lead upon his breast,\r\nto correct unsteadiness in breathing, and to abstain from food\r\nfor two days together to clear his voice, often denying himself\r\nfruit and sweet pastry. The degraded state of the theatre may\r\nwell be imagined from the fact that under Nero the custom of\r\nhiring professional applause was instituted. After his death,\r\nwhich is so dramatically told by Suetonius, music never revived\r\nin Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, however, a new kind of music had begun;\r\nin the catacombs and underground vaults, the early Christians\r\nwere chanting their first hymns. Like all that we call \"new,\"\r\nthis music had its roots in the old. The hymns sung by the\r\nChristians were mainly Hebrew temple songs, strangely changed\r\ninto an uncouth imitation of the ancient Greek drama or worship\r\nof Dionysus; for example, Philo of Alexandria, as well as Pliny\r\nthe Younger, speaks of the Christians as accompanying their\r\nsongs with gestures, and with steps forward and backward. This\r\nGreek influence is still further implied by the order of one\r\nof the earliest of the Church fathers, Clement of Alexandria\r\n(about 300 A.D.), who forbade the use of the chromatic style in\r\nthe hymns, as tending too much toward paganism. Some writers\r\neven go so far as to identify many of the Christian myths and\r\nsymbols with those of Greece. For instance, they see, in the\r\nstory of Daniel in the lions' den, another form of the legend of\r\nOrpheus taming the wild beasts; in Jonah, they recognize Arion\r\nand the dolphin; and the symbol of the Good Shepherd, carrying\r\nhome the stray lamb on his shoulders, is considered another\r\nform of the familiar Greek figure of Hermes carrying the goat.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it is certain that this crude beginning\r\nof Christian music arose from a vital necessity, and was\r\naccompanied by an indomitable faith. If we look back, we note\r\nthat until now music had either been the servant of ignoble\r\nmasters, looked upon as a mathematical problem to be solved\r\nscientifically, or used according to methods prescribed by\r\nthe state. It had been dragged down to the lowest depths of\r\nsensuality by the dance, and its divine origin forgotten in\r\nlilting rhythms and soft, lulling rhymes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mathematicians, in their cold\r\ncalculation, reduced music to the utilitarianism of algebra,\r\nand even viewed it as a kind of medicine for the nerves and\r\nmind. When we think of the music of Pythagoras and his school,\r\nwe seem to be in a kind of laboratory in which all the tones\r\nare labelled and have their special directions for use. For\r\nthe legend runs that he composed melodies in the diatonic,\r\nchromatic, and enharmonic styles as antidotes for moods such\r\nas anger, fear, sorrow, etc., and invented new rhythms which\r\nhe used to steady and strengthen the mind, and to produce\r\nsimplicity of character in his disciples. He recommended that\r\nevery morning, after rising, they should play on the lyre and\r\nsing, in order to clear the mind. It was inevitable that this\r\nhalf mathematical, half psychologically medicinal manner of\r\ntreating music would, in falling into the hands of Euclid\r\n(300 B.C.) and his school, degenerate into a mere peg on\r\nwhich to hang mathematical theorems. On the other hand, when\r\nwe think of Greek dances, we seem to pass into the bright,\r\nwarm sunshine. We see graceful figures holding one another by\r\nthe wrist, dancing in a circle around some altar to Dionysus,\r\nand singing to the strange lilt of those unequal measures. We\r\ncan imagine the scheme of colour to be white and gold, framed\r\nby the deep-blue arch of the sky, the amethyst sea flecked\r\nwith glittering silver foam, and the dark, sombre rocks of the\r\nCretan coast bringing a suggestion of fate into this dancing,\r\nsoulless vision. Turning now to Rome, we see that this same\r\nmusic has fallen to a wretched slave's estate, cowering in some\r\ncorner until the screams of Nero's living torches need to be\r\ndrowned; and then, with brazen clangour and unabashed rhythms,\r\nthis brutal music flaunts forth with swarms of dancing slaves,\r\nshrilling out the praises of Nero; and the time for successful\r\nrevolution is at hand.\r\n\r\nThe first steps toward actually defining the new music took\r\nplace in the second century, when the Christians were free to\r\nworship more openly, and, having wealthy converts among them,\r\nheld their meetings in public places and basilicas which were\r\nused by magistrates and other officials during the day. These\r\nbasilicas or public halls had a raised platform at one end, on\r\nwhich the magistrate sat when in office. There were steps up to\r\nit, and on these steps the clergy stood. The rest of the hall\r\nwas called the \"nave\" (ship), for the simile of \"storm-tossed\r\nmariners\" was always dear to the early Christian church. In the\r\ncentre of the nave stood the reader of the Scriptures, and on\r\neach side of him, ranged along the wall, were the singers. The\r\nPsalms were sung antiphonally, that is, first one side would\r\nsing and the other side would answer. The congregations\r\nwere sometimes immense, for according to St. Jerome (340-420\r\nA.D.) and St. Ambrose (340-397 A.D.) \"the roofs reechoed with\r\ntheir cries of 'Alleluia,' which in sound were like the great\r\nwaves of the surging sea.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless this was, as yet, only sound, and not music. Not\r\nuntil many centuries later did music become distinct from\r\nchanting, which is merely intoned _speech_. The disputes\r\nof the Arians and the Athanasians also affected the music of\r\nthe church, for as early as 306 A.D., Arius introduced many\r\nsecular melodies, and had them sung by women.\r\n\r\nPassing over this, we find that the first actual arrangement\r\nof Christian music into a regular system was attempted by Pope\r\nSylvester, in 314 A.D., when he instituted singing schools,\r\nand when the heresy of Arius was formally condemned.\r\n\r\nNow this chanting or singing of hymns was more or less a\r\ndeclamation, thus following the Greek tradition of using one\r\ncentral note, somewhat in the nature of a keynote.\r\n\r\nRhythm, distinct melody, and even metre were avoided as\r\nretaining something of the unclean, brutal heathenism against\r\nwhich the Christians had revolted. It was the effort to keep\r\nthe music of the church pure and undefiled that caused the\r\nCouncil of Laodicea (367 A.D.) to exclude from the church all\r\nsinging not authorized from the pulpit.\r\n\r\nA few years later (about 370 A.D.) Ambrose, the Archbishop\r\nof Milan, strove to define this music more clearly, by fixing\r\nupon the modes that were to be allowed for these chants; for\r\nwe must remember that all music was still based upon the Greek\r\nmodes, the modern major and minor being as yet unknown. In the\r\ncourse of time the ancient modes had become corrupted, and the\r\nmodes that Ambrose took for his hymns were therefore different\r\nfrom those known in Greece under the same names. His Dorian\r\nis what the ancients called Phrygian, [G: d' d''] dominant,\r\nA; his Phrygian was the ancient Dorian, [G: e' e''] dominant,\r\nC; his Lydian corresponded to the old Hypolydian, [G: f' f'']\r\ndominant, C; and his Mixolydian to the old Hypophrygian,\r\n[G: g' g''] dominant, D. These modes were accepted by the\r\nchurch and were called the Authentic modes.\r\n\r\nAlmost two centuries later, Gregory the Great added four\r\nmore modes, which were called Plagal or side modes (from\r\n_plagios_--oblique). These were as follows:\r\n\r\n                          (Keynote)\r\n\r\n    Hypodorian,      [G: a  (d')  a' ] dominant, F.\r\n    Hypophrygian,    [G: c  (e')  b' ] dominant, A.\r\n    Hypolydian,      [G: c' (f')  c''] dominant, A.\r\n    Hypo-mixolydian, [G: d' (g')  d''] dominant, C.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that these so-called new modes are simply\r\nnew versions of the first four; although they are lowered a\r\nfourth beneath the authentic modes (hence the _hypo_), the\r\n_keynote remains the same_ in each instance. Still later two\r\nmore modes were added to this list, the Ionic, [G: c' c'']\r\ndominant, G, which corresponded to the ancient Greek Lydian;\r\nand the Aeolian, [G: a' a''] dominant, E, which, strange to say,\r\nwas the only one of these newer modes which corresponded to\r\nits Greek namesake. Naturally these two newly admitted modes\r\nwere also accompanied by their lower pitched attendant modes,\r\nthe Hypoionic, [G: g (c') g'] dominant, E, and the Hypoaeolian,\r\n[G: e' (a') e''] dominant, C.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n    Mode.            Key.  Dominant.\r\n\r\n    Dorian.           D        A\r\n    Hypodorian.       D        F\r\n    Phrygian.         E        C\r\n    Hypophrygian.     E        A\r\n    Lydian.           F        C\r\n    Hypolydian.       F        A\r\n    Mixolydian.       G        D\r\n    Hypo-mixolydian.  G        C\r\n    Aeolian.          A        E\r\n    Hypoaeolian.

They differed from the\r\nauthentic modes, inasmuch as in the latter a melody might end\r\neither on the upper or lower tonic or keynote. Thus the melody\r\nitself was said to be either authentic or plagal, according\r\nto whether it had one or two tonics. The theme of Schumann's\r\n\"Etudes symphoniques\" is authentic, and the first variation\r\nis plagal.\r\n\r\nBetween the sixth and tenth centuries there was much confusion\r\nas to the placing of these modes, but they finally stood as\r\ngiven above. The Greek names were definitely accepted in the\r\neleventh century, or thereabouts; previously, they were known\r\nalso as the first, second, third, etc., up to the twelfth,\r\nchurch tones or Gregorian modes.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is necessary to refer again to Ambrose.\r\nApart from having brought the first four authentic modes\r\ninto church music, he composed many hymns which had this\r\npeculiarity, namely, that they were modelled more on the actual\r\ndeclamation of the words to be sung than had hitherto been\r\nthe case. We are told that his chants--to use the phrase of\r\nhis contemporary, Francis of Cologne--were \"all for sweetness\r\nand melodious sound\"; and St. Augustine (354-430 A.D.),\r\nspeaks of them with ecstasy. The words in these hymns were\r\nused in connection with small groups of notes; consequently\r\nthey could be understood as they were sung, thus returning\r\nin a measure to the character of the music of the ancients,\r\nin which the word and declamation were of greater importance\r\nthan the actual sounds which accompanied them. But now a\r\nstrange thing was to happen that was to give us a new art.\r\nNow, at last, music was to be separated from language and dance\r\nrhythms, and stand alone for the first time in the history of\r\ncivilization as _pure music_.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the change made by Gregory (540-604 A.D.), it is\r\nnecessary to bear in mind the state of the church just before\r\nhis time. As the Ambrosian chant had brought something of the\r\nold declamation and sweetness back into the church ceremonial,\r\nso also in the church itself there was a tendency to sink\r\nback into the golden shimmer that had surrounded the ancient\r\npagan rites. Already Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch (260\r\nA.D.), had striven to bring a certain Oriental magnificence\r\ninto the church ceremonials. He had a canopied throne erected\r\nfor himself, from which he would address his congregation;\r\nhe introduced applause into the church, after the fashion of\r\nthe Roman theatres; he also had a chorus of women singers, who,\r\nas Eusebius tells us, sang not the Christian hymns, but pagan\r\ntunes. Later, in Constantinople, even this luxury and pomp\r\nincreased; the churches had domes of burnished gold, and had\r\nbecome gigantic palaces, lit by thousands of lamps. The choir,\r\ndressed in glittering robes, was placed in the middle of the\r\nchurch, and these singers began to show the same fatal sign\r\nof decadence that we saw before in Rome and Greece. According\r\nto St. Chrysostom (347-407 A.D.), they used unguents on their\r\nthroats in order to make the voice flexible, for by this time\r\nthe singing had become a mere vehicle for virtuosity; when\r\nthey sang their _tours de force_, the people applauded and\r\nwaved their handkerchiefs, as they did also when the preaching\r\npleased them. The pagans pointed the finger of scorn at the\r\nChristians, as being mere renegades from the old religion,\r\nand said, plausibly enough, that their worship was merely\r\nanother form of the Dionysus tragedy. There was the same altar,\r\nthe same chorus, the priest who sang and was answered by the\r\nchorus; and the resemblance had grown to such an extent that\r\nSt. Chrysostom (350 A.D.) complained that the church chorus\r\naccompanied its singing with theatrical gestures, which,\r\nas we know, is simply the first step towards the dance.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things when Gregory became Pope in\r\n590 A.D. His additions to the modes already in use have been\r\nexplained. His great reform lay in severing the connection\r\nbetween the music of the church and that of the pagan world\r\nbefore it. Casting aside the declamation and rhythm, which\r\nup to now had always dominated pure sound, he abolished the\r\nstyle of church singing in vogue, and substituted for it a\r\nsystem of chanting in which every tie between the words and\r\nmusic was severed.\r\n\r\nThe music was certainly primitive enough, for it consisted\r\nmerely of a rising and falling of the voice for the space of\r\nmany notes on one single syllable, as, for instance,\r\n\r\n    [F: (f g f g a a) a (a a a g a g g f a)]\r\n    [W: Gloria]\r\n\r\nThe difference between this and the Ambrosian chant is evident\r\nif we look at the following; and we must also bear in mind\r\nthat the Ambrosian chants were very simple in comparison with\r\nthe florid _tours de force_ of the Byzantine church:\r\n\r\n    [F: d  (d f) (d e) f | (g f) (g a) a | (a g) a  c' d']\r\n    [W: Al me    pater   | Ambrosi,      | nostras, preces,]\r\n    [F: (a b) a | a    g   a f e d]\r\n    [W: audi    | Christe, exaudinos]\r\n\r\nNow this reform could not be carried out at once; it was\r\nonly through the medium of Charlemagne (742-814 A.D.),\r\na hundred years later, that the Gregorian chant was firmly\r\nestablished. Authorized by a synod of bishops, called together\r\nfrom all parts of Europe by Pope Adrian I, Charlemagne, in\r\n774, caused all the chant and hymn books of the Ambrosian\r\nsystem throughout Italy to be burned. So completely was\r\nthis accomplished that only one Ambrosian missal was found\r\n(by St. Eugenius at Milan), and from this work alone can we\r\nform any idea as to the character of the music used by the\r\nfollowers of Ambrose, who were much retarded by the lack of\r\na musical notation, which was the next factor needed to bring\r\nmusic to an equality with the other arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[07] Imitating the sound of the thing signified. Poe's\r\n     \"Raven\" has much of this character.\r\n\r\n[08] [over-dot]c, perfect pause;  c[mid-dot], short;  c., shortest;\r\n     breathings: [reverse-apostrophe] hard;  ' soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE SCALE--NOTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparing the Ambrosian chant with that of Gregory, it\r\nmay be said that we have touched upon the vital principle of\r\nmodern music. The novelty in the Gregorian chant consisted in\r\nits absolute emancipation from the tyranny of actual words\r\nand declamation; while the idea, the poetic principle, or\r\nreligious ecstasy still remained the ideal to be expressed in\r\nthe music. Before this, as already explained, music was either\r\na mathematical problem, a rhythm to mark the time in dancing,\r\nor a vehicle serving for the display of clever _tours de force_,\r\nthe music of the tragedies being merely a kind of melodious\r\ndeclamation. To quote Goethe, \"having recognized the fact,\r\nit still remains for us to see how it developed.\" Let us now\r\nconsider this point.\r\n\r\nThree things were necessary before these Gregorian chants\r\ncould develop at all: (1) A simple, clean-cut musical scale\r\nor systematized table of musical sounds. (2) Some definite\r\nmanner of symbolizing sounds, so that they could be accurately\r\nexpressed in writing. (3) A cultivation of the sense of\r\nhearing, in order that mankind might learn to distinguish\r\nbetween sounds that are discordant and those that sound well\r\ntogether; in other words, harmony.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the scale, and review what we know of the\r\nGreek modes in order to show how they were amalgamated into\r\nour present octave system of scales.\r\n\r\n  [Tetrachords         /------|-----\\    /-------|--------\\ ]\r\n  [                 F: b, c d e f g a G: b c' d' e' f' g' a']\r\n  [Mixolydian          \\--+-+-+-+-+-+----/ |  |  |  |  |  | ]\r\n  [Lydian                 \\-+-+-+-+-+------/  |  |  |  |  | ]\r\n  [Phrygian                 \\-+-+-+-+---------/  |  |  |  | ]\r\n  [Dorian                     \\-+-+-+------------/  |  |  | ]\r\n  [Hypolydian                   \\-+-+---------------/  |  | ]\r\n  [Hypophrygian                   \\-+------------------/  | ]\r\n  [Aeolian or Locrian or Hypodorian \\---------------------/ ]\r\n  [Notes labelled from highest to lowest: Nete, Paranete, Trite,\r\n   Nete, Paranete, Trite, Paramese, Mese, Lichanos, Parhypate,\r\n   Hypate, Lichanos, Parhypate, Hypate, [F: a,] Proslambanomenos.]\r\n\r\nUnder Ambrose and Pope Gregory, these modes had taken a\r\ndifferent form. The chromatic and enharmonic styles had been\r\nabandoned in theory, the portamento which the singers introduced\r\ninto their chants being the only principle retained. The new\r\nsystem was as follows:\r\n\r\n    [F8: g, a, b,  G8: c d e f g a b c' d' e' f' g' a']\r\n    [First nine notes labelled:\r\n     Hypoion., Hypodor., Hypophryg., Hypolyd./Ionian,\r\n     Hypo-mixolyd./Dorian, Hypoaeol./Phryg., Lyd., Mixolyd., Aeol.]\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the story of the evolution of scales and\r\nclefs, we must add that the Flemish monk, Hucbald (900 A.D.),\r\ndivided this scale into regular tetrachords, beginning at\r\nG, with the succession, tone, semitone, tone, forming four\r\ndisjunct tetrachords,\r\n\r\n    [F: (g, a, b-, c) (d e f g) (a b c' d') G: (e' f+' g' a')]\r\n\r\nThis division remained without influence on the development\r\nof the scale.\r\n\r\nThe first change in the _tetrachord_ system of reckoning\r\ntones and dividing the scale was made by Guido d'Arezzo (first\r\nhalf of eleventh century), who divided it into hexachords or\r\ngroups of six notes each. Up to that time, each note of the\r\nscale had had a letter of the alphabet for its symbol. It was\r\nGuido who conceived the idea of using syllables for these\r\nnotes. The story of how it occurred to him is well known:\r\nOn one occasion, hearing his brethren in the monastery choir\r\nof Arezzo, in Tuscany, sing a hymn to St. John the Baptist, he\r\nnoticed that the first syllable of each line came on regularly\r\nascending notes of the scale, the first syllable coming on C,\r\nthe first of the next line on D, the first of the third on E,\r\netc., up to A on the sixth line. As all these syllables happened\r\nto differ one from the other, and, moreover, were very easy\r\nto sing, he hit upon the idea of using them to distinguish\r\nthe notes on which they fell in the hymn.\r\n\r\n    [F:  c   d  f   (d e) d |  d  d c d  e  e   ]\r\n    [W: _Ut_ queant laxis   | _Re_sonare fibris ]\r\n    [F: (e f g) e (d e) c d |  f  g a  (g f) d d]\r\n    [W: _Mi_ra    gestorum  | _Fa_muli tuorum   ]\r\n    [F: (g a g) e f  g d  |  a  g a f (g a) a | (g f) d c e d  ]\r\n    [W: _Sol_ve   polluti | _La_bii reatum    | Sancte  Joannes]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as there were six of these syllables, he arranged\r\nthe musical scale in groups of six notes instead of four,\r\nhexachords instead of tetrachords. Commencing with G, which\r\nwas the lowest note of the system in Hucbald's time, the first\r\nhexachord was formed of G A B C D E; the second, following the\r\nexample of the Greeks, he made to overlap the first, namely,\r\nC D E F G A; the third, likewise overlapping the second,\r\ncommenced on F. In order to make this hexachord identical\r\nin structure with, the first and second, he flatted the B,\r\nthus making the succession of notes, F G A B[flat] C D. The\r\nnext three hexachords were repetitions of the first three,\r\nnamely, G A B C D E, C D E F G A, F G A B[flat] C D; the last\r\nwas again a repetition of the first, G A B C D E.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAMUT.\r\n\r\n[F:  g,     a, b, c  d   e    c  d  e  f  g   a    f  g  a  b- c'  d' ]\r\n[W: [Gamma] A  B  C  D   E    C  D  E  F  G   a    F  G  a  b  c   d  ]\r\n[W: (Ut     re mi fa sol la) (Ut re mi fa sol la) (Ut re mi fa sol la)]\r\n[Hexachords:      (Hard Low)        (Natural Low)           (Soft Low)]\r\n\r\n[G:  g  a  b= c' d'  e'   c' d' e' f' g'  a' ]\r\n[W:  G  a  b  c  d   e    c  d  e  f  g   aa ]\r\n[W: (Ut re mi fa sol la) (Ut re mi fa sol la)]\r\n[Hexachords: (Hard High)       (Natural High)]\r\n\r\n[G:  f' g' a' b-' c'' d''  g' a' b=' c'' d'' e'']\r\n[W:  f  g  aa bb  cc  dd   g  aa bb  cc  dd  ee ]\r\n[W: (Ut re mi fa  sol la) (Ut re mi  fa  sol la)]\r\n[Hexachords:  (Soft High)     (Hard Super Acute)]\r\n\r\nTo the lowest note of this scale, which was foreign to the\r\nGreek system, he gave a special name, _gamma_, after the\r\nGreek letter G. From this we get our word for the scale,\r\nthe gamut. The other notes remained the same as before, only\r\nthat for the lowest octave capital letters were used; in the\r\nnext octave, the notes were designated by small letters, and\r\nin the last octave by double letters, aa, bb, etc., as in the\r\nfollowing example.\r\n\r\n  [F: g,  g     G: a  g'         | a'  g''                     ]\r\n  [W: Capitals.  : Small letters | Double or very small letters]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT SCALE.\r\n\r\n    [F: c,,    | c,    | c    G: c'  | c'' | c''' | c'''']\r\n    [W: C_     | C     | c     : c'  | c'' | c''' | c'''']\r\n    [W: Contra | Great | Small : 1st | 2nd | 3rd  | 4th  ]\r\n\r\nFollowing out his system, he applied the newly acquired\r\nsyllables to each of the hexachords--for instance, the lowest\r\nhexachord, G A B C D E, which was called hard, became _ut re\r\nmi fa sol la_; the second, which was called natural, C D E F\r\nG A, also became _ut re mi fa sol la_; and the third, which\r\nwas called soft, F G A B[flat] C D, became likewise _ut re mi\r\nfa sol la_. The next three hexachords were treated in the same\r\nmanner; the last or seventh hexachord was merely a repetition\r\nof the first and the fourth.\r\n\r\nNow in the hymns, and also in the sequences, as they were called\r\n(which were simply a series of notes forming a little melody\r\nsung to two or three words), the voice was rarely called upon\r\nto progress more than the interval of a sixth, and so this\r\nsolmization, as the new system was called, was very valuable;\r\nfor one had only to give the pitch, and _ut_ always meant the\r\nkeynote, _re_ the second, _mi_ the third, etc., etc. In time\r\n_ut_ was found to be a difficult syllable to sing, and _do_\r\nwas substituted. This change, however, was made after the scale\r\nwas divided into a system of octaves instead of hexachords. The\r\nimprovement in singing soon made the limits of the hexachords\r\ntoo small to be practical; therefore another syllable was added\r\nto the hexachordal system, _si_, and with this seventh note\r\nwe have our modern scale. From this we see that the scale in\r\npresent use is composed of octaves, just as the older scales\r\nwere composed of hexachords, and before that tetrachords. Just\r\nas in mediaeval times each hexachord commenced with _ut_,\r\nso now every octave of our tonal system commences with _do_.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the hexachordal system, it may be as well to\r\nexplain the mode of procedure when the voice had to go beyond\r\nthe interval of the sixth. We know that the first of every set\r\nof six notes was called _ut_, the second, _re_, the third,\r\n_mi_, etc. When the voice had to go beyond _la_, the sixth\r\nnote, to B[natural], that sixth note was always called _re_,\r\nand was considered the second note of a new hexachord. If,\r\non the other hand, the voice had to go beyond _a_, to B[flat],\r\nthe fifth note was called _re_, since the syllables _mi fa_\r\nmust always come on the half-tone.\r\n\r\nIn a study of our system of writing music, it may be as well to\r\nbegin with the derivation of our sharps and flats. Observing\r\nthe third hexachord on our list we see that in order to make\r\nit identical in structure with the first and second, the B had\r\nto be lowered a semitone. Now the third hexachord was called\r\nsoft. The B[flat] in it was accordingly called a soft B or\r\nB _molle_, which is still the name in France for a flat, and\r\n_moll_ in German still means minor, or \"soft\" or \"lowered.\" For\r\nthe fourth hexachord, which was called hard, this B was again\r\nraised a semitone. But the flatted B was already indicated\r\nby the letter _b_ or round _b_, as it was called; hence this\r\nB natural was given a _square_ shape and called B _carre_,\r\n[illustration]. The present French word for natural (when it\r\nis specially marked) is _becarre_; the German word for major\r\nalso comes indirectly from this, for _dur_ means \"hard.\"\r\n\r\nAn explanation of the modern German names for notes will be\r\neasily understood in this connection. In the German nomenclature\r\nthe letters of the alphabet stand for the notes of the scale\r\nas in the English, with the exception of B. This B, or \"round\"\r\nB, in the German system stands for B[flat], which is more\r\nlogical than our English usage, since our flat is merely a\r\nslightly modified form of _b_. The German B natural is our\r\nletter _h_, which is merely a corruption of the square _b_,\r\n[illustration], which by the addition of a line in time\r\nbecame our [natural]. The Germans have carried the flatting\r\nand sharping of tones to a logical conclusion in their present\r\nnomenclature, for by \"sharping\" the sound of a single letter it\r\nis raised a semitone from its normal diapason, thus F becomes\r\n_Fis_, G _Gis_. On the other hand, in order to lower a tone,\r\nthe letter representing it is \"flatted,\" and F is called _Fes_,\r\nG _Ges_, the only exception to these rules being the B which\r\nwe have already considered.\r\n\r\nIn France the Guidonian system was adhered to closely, and\r\nto this day the _becarre_ is used only as an accidental, to\r\nindicate that the note to which it refers has been flatted\r\nbefore. The _naturel_ (which has the same shape) is used\r\nto designate a note that is natural to the key; thus the\r\ndistinction is made between an accidental and a note that is\r\ncommon to the key. In F major, for instance, B[natural] is\r\n_si becarre_, A[natural] would be _la naturel_. Our modern\r\nsharp is merely another form of the natural or square B\r\n([natural]) which gradually came to be used before _any_ note,\r\nsignifying that it was raised or sharped a half-tone; the flat\r\nlowered it a semitone, and after a while the natural received\r\nits present place between the sharp and flat. The first instance\r\nwe have of the sharp being used is in the thirteenth century,\r\nwhen (in the Rondels of Adam de la Hale) it takes the form\r\nof a cross [x] (the German word for the sharp still remains\r\n_kreuz_). The French word _diese_ (sharp) comes from the Greek\r\n_diesis_, a term used to indicate the raising of the voice in\r\nthe chromatic scale.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have to speak of notation and its development.\r\nThus far we have found only two ways in which musical sounds\r\nwere indicated by the ancients. First, we remember the invention\r\nof Aristophanes of Alexandria, his accents, high, low, and\r\ncircumflex. Then we know from Ptolemy, Boethius, and Alypius\r\nthat letters were used to designate the different tones; but as\r\nthere is no music extant in this notation to prove the theory,\r\nwe need not trouble ourselves with it.\r\n\r\nThe system of Aristophanes, however, was destined to become the\r\nnucleus from which our modern notation sprang. We know that\r\nan elementary idea, clearly expressed, has more chances of\r\nliving than has a more complicated system, however ingenious\r\nthe latter may be. Now this system is so plain that we will\r\nfind it is common to many aboriginal peoples, for instance\r\nthe American Indians have a system very similar.\r\n\r\nIn the period now under consideration (from the third to the\r\ntenth century), music was noted in this way: an upstroke of\r\nthe pen meant a raising of the voice, a downstroke lowered it,\r\na flat stroke meant a repetition of the same note, thus [/ \\ -]\r\n[G: c' g' c' c']. Gradually it became necessary to indicate\r\nthe contour of the melodies with more accuracy; therefore the\r\ncircumflex was added [Over-slur] [G: g' c'' g'] and reversed\r\n[Under-slur] [G: g' e' g']. Still later a sign for two steps was\r\ninvented [Step] [G: e' g' b'] and when the progression was to\r\nbe diatonically stepwise the strokes were thicker [Thick Step]\r\n[G: g' a' b']. So this notation developed, and by combining\r\nthe many signs together, simple non-rhythmic melodies could be\r\nindicated with comparative clearness and simplicity. The flat\r\nstroke for a single note [-], indicating [G: b'], eventually\r\nbecame smaller and thicker, thus [Thick -]. By combining these\r\ndifferent signs, a skip of a third and back came to be noted\r\n[Crenellation], and if the note came down on a second instead\r\nof the original note it became [Podium] [G: g' b' a']. The\r\n_quilisma_ ([Upper Mordent]) indicated a repetition of two\r\nnotes, one above the other, and we still use much the same\r\nsign for our trill. Also the two forms of the circumflex,\r\n[Over-slur] [Under-slur], were joined ([Turn]) and thus we\r\nhave the modern turn, so much used by Wagner.\r\n\r\nNow while this notation was ingenious, it still left much\r\nto be desired as to pitch. To remedy this a red line was\r\ndrawn before writing these signs or _neumes_, as they were\r\ncalled. This line represented a given pitch, generally E;\r\nabove and below it were then written the signs for the notes,\r\ntheir pitch being determined by the relative position they held\r\nin regard to the _line_. Thus [Podium, Turn, Upper Mordent] was\r\nthe equivalent of [G: c' e'  d' e' d' c' d'  e' d' e' d' e' d'],\r\nconsidering the line as being middle C pitch, a fourth higher F.\r\nThis was the condition of musical notation in 1000 A.D.\r\n\r\nTo Guido d'Arezzo is ascribed its development up to some\r\nsemblance of our present system, although the claim has often\r\nbeen denied. It is certain, however, that the innovations\r\nwere made at this period. In the first place Guido made the\r\nred line _always_ stand for the pitch of F, and at a little\r\ndistance above it he added another line, this time yellow,\r\nwhich was to indicate the pitch of C. Thus the signs began to\r\ntake very definite meaning as regards pitch; for, given a sign\r\nextending from one line to the other, the reader could see\r\nat a glance that the music progressed a fifth, from F to C,\r\nor _vice-versa_. And now the copyists, seeing the value of\r\nthese lines in determining the pitch of the different signs,\r\nof their own account added two more in black ink, one of which\r\nthey drew between the F and the C line, and the other above\r\nthe C line, thus [illustration]. By doing this they accurately\r\ndecided the pitch of every note, for the lowest line, being F,\r\nthe line between that and the C line must stand for A, and the\r\ntwo spaces for G and B; the top line would stand for E, and the\r\nspace between it and the yellow line for D. Little by little\r\nthese copyists grew careless about making the lines in yellow,\r\nred, and black, and sometimes drew them all in black or red,\r\nthereby losing the distinguishing mark of the F and C lines. In\r\norder to remedy this, Guido placed the letters F and C before\r\nthe lines representing these notes, thus [illustration]. In\r\nthis way our modern _clefs_ (_clavis_ or key) originated, for\r\nthe C clef, as it is called, gradually changed its shape to\r\n[illustration] and [illustration], and the F clef changed to\r\n[illustration], which is our bass clef in a rudimentary form.\r\n\r\nLater, still another line was added to the set, thus giving\r\nus our modern staff, and another clef, [illustration], was\r\nadded on the next to the lowest line. This, in turn, became\r\nour present treble clef, [G:]. In the course of time the signs\r\nthemselves underwent many changes, until at last from [Podium],\r\netc., they became our modern signs.\r\n\r\nBefore this, however, a grave defect in the notation had to\r\nbe remedied. There was as yet no way of designating the length\r\nof time a note was to be sustained; something definite in the\r\nway of noting _rhythm_ was necessary. This was accomplished\r\nby Franco of Cologne, in the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. By disconnecting the parts of the sign [Podium] one\r\nfrom another, the following individual signs were acquired\r\n[illustration of Podium broken into three pieces]. In order\r\nto have two distinct values of length, these signs were\r\ncalled longs and shorts, _longa_ [illustration], and _brevis_\r\n[illustration], to which was added the _brevis_ in another\r\nposition [illustration], called _semibrevis_. The _longa_\r\nwas twice the value of the _brevis_, and the _semibrevis_\r\nwas half the length of the _brevis_ ([L = B B   B = S S]).\r\nWhen notes of equal length were slurred, they were written\r\n[illustration]. When two or more notes were to be sung to\r\none syllable in quicker time, the _brevi_ were joined one to\r\nthe other [illustration], as for instance in the songs of the\r\nthirteenth century,\r\n\r\n\r\n    DIRGE FOR KING RICHARD'S DEATH\r\n\r\n    GAUCELM FAIDIT.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n    [W: Fortz chose est que tot le maur major dam]\r\n\r\n\r\n    ROI THIBAUT DE NAVARRE (1250).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n    [W: Si li dis sans de laies | Belle diex vous doint bon jour]\r\n\r\nor, in modern style,\r\n\r\n    [G: g' a' b' c'' (d'' c'') (b' a' g') |\r\n        a' b' (c'' b') (b' a' g') (a' b') g']\r\n\r\nIn this example we find the first indication of the measuring\r\noff of phrases into bars. As we see, it consisted of a little\r\nstroke, which served to show the beginning of a new line,\r\nand was not restricted to regularity of any kind except that\r\nnecessitated by the verse.\r\n\r\nThe use of the _semibrevis_ is shown in the following chanson\r\nof Raoul de Coucy (1192):\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n    [W: Quant li rossignol jolis | chante\r\n        Seur la flor d'este | que n'est la rose et le lis]\r\n\r\n    [G: d'' (c'' a') b-' (a' (g' f')) g' (a' b-' a' f') f' | f' g'\r\n        a' (b-' a') (c'' d'' c'' b-') (a' g') a' |\r\n        d'' (c'' a') b-' a' (g' f') g' (a' (b-' a') f') f']\r\n\r\nThe French troubadours and the German minnesingers of the\r\nthirteenth century used these forms of notes only, and even\r\nthen restricted themselves to two kinds, either the _longa_\r\nand _brevis_, or _brevis_ and _semibrevis_.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for rests very soon manifested itself, and the\r\nfollowing signs were invented to correspond to the _longa_,\r\n_brevis_, and _semibrevis_ [illustration]. Also the number of\r\nnote symbols was increased by the _maxima_ or double _longa_\r\n[illustration], and the _minima_ [illustration], which\r\nrepresented half the value of the _semibrevis_.\r\n\r\nNow that music began taking a more definite rhythmic form\r\nthan before, a more regular dividing off of the phrases\r\nbecame necessary. This was accomplished by the use of a\r\ndot, and another form, the perpendicular line, which we\r\nhave noticed in the song of the King of Navarre (1250). At\r\nfirst a means to indicate triple time was invented, and the\r\nmeasure corresponding to our [9/8] was indicated by placing\r\nthe sign [O.] at the beginning of the line. This was called\r\nperfect. Then, for plain triple time the dot was omitted [O];\r\nfor [6/8] time the sign [C.] was adopted, and for ordinary\r\ncommon time [C] was taken. Consequently, when these signs\r\nwere placed at the beginning of the line they changed the\r\nvalue of the notes to correspond to the time marked. Thus in\r\n[O.] (_tempus perfectum_, _prolatio major_) or [9/8], the\r\n_brevis_ was reckoned worth three _semibrevi_ [B = S S S]\r\n([1. = 4. 4. 4.]); the _semibrevis_ three _minimi_ [S = M M M]\r\n([4. = 8 8 8]). In [O] or [3/4] time [B = S S S] ([2. = 4 4 4]);\r\nbut the _semibrevis_ was only as long as two _minimi_ [S = M M]\r\n([4 = 8 8]). In [C.] or [6/8] time [B = S S] ([2. = 4. 4.]),\r\nbut [S = M M M] ([4. = 8 8 8]). In [C] or [2/2] time [B = S S]\r\n([1 = 2 2]), and [S = M M] ([2 = 4 4]).\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the fifteenth century the notes began to\r\nbe written in an open form\r\n\r\n    [Illustration] _Maxima_.\r\n    [Illustration] _Longa_.\r\n    [Illustration] _Brevis_.\r\n    [Illustration] _Semibrevis_.\r\n    [Illustration] _Minima_.\r\n    [Illustration] _Semiminima_, which was added later.\r\n\r\nAs still smaller units of value were added, the _semiminima_\r\nwas replaced by [filled minima], and the half _semiminima_\r\nthus became [minima with tail], and the next smaller values,\r\n[two tails] and [three tails]. The rest to correspond to\r\nthe _semiminima_ was [illustration]; for the _semibrevis_\r\n[illustration], and _minima_ [illustration].\r\n\r\nThus we have the following values and their corresponding rests:\r\n\r\n    _Maxima_                   [Illustration]\r\n    _Longa_                    [Illustration]\r\n    _Brevis_                   [Illustration]\r\n    _Semibrevis_               [Illustration]\r\n    _Minima_                   [Illustration]\r\n    _Semiminima_ or _crocheta_ [Illustration]\r\n    _Fusa_ or _crocheta_       [Illustration]\r\n    _Semifusa_                 [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe rests for the _fusa_ and _semifusa_ were turned to the left\r\nin order to avoid the confusion that would ensue if the rest\r\n[illustration] stood for [fusa]. Besides, the sign would have\r\neasily become confused with the C clef [illustration].\r\n\r\nSigns for the changes of _tempo_, that is to say changes\r\nfrom quick to slow, etc., were introduced in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The oldest of them consists of drawing a line through\r\nthe _tempus_ sign [O|]. This meant that the notes were to be\r\nplayed or sung twice as rapidly as would usually be the case,\r\nwithout, however, affecting the relative value of the notes\r\nto one another. Now we remember that the sign [C] stood for\r\nour modern [4/4] time; when a line was drawn through it,\r\n[C|] it indicated that two _brevi_ were counted as one, and\r\nthe movement was said to be _alla breve_. This is the one\r\ninstance of time signatures that has come down to us unaltered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE SYSTEMS OF HUCBALD AND GUIDO D'AREZZO--THE BEGINNING\r\nOF COUNTERPOINT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that by order of Charlemagne, Ambrosian chant was\r\nsuperseded by that of Gregory, and from any history of music\r\nwe may learn how he caused the Gregorian chant to be taught\r\nto the exclusion of all other music. Although Notker, in the\r\nmonastery of St. Gall, in Switzerland, and others developed the\r\nGregorian chant, until the time of Hucbald this music remained\r\nmere wandering melody, without harmonic support of any kind.\r\n\r\nHucbald (840-930) was a monk of the monastery of St. Armand in\r\nFlanders. As we know from our studies in notation, he was the\r\nfirst to improve the notation by introducing a system of lines\r\nand spaces, of which, however, the spaces only were utilized\r\nfor indicating the notes, viz.:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis attempt to reconstruct the musical scale was afterwards\r\novershadowed by the system invented by Guido d'Arezzo, and it\r\nis therefore unnecessary to describe it in detail. His great\r\ncontribution to progress was the discovery that more than one\r\nsound could be played or sung simultaneously, thus creating a\r\ncomposite sound, the effect which we call a chord. However,\r\nin deciding which sounds should be allowed to be played or\r\nsung together, he was influenced partly by the mysticism of\r\nhis age, and partly by a blind adherence to the remnants of\r\nmusical theory which had been handed down from the Greeks. As\r\nFranco of Cologne, later (1200), in systematizing rhythm into\r\nmeasure, was influenced by the idea of the Trinity in making\r\nhis [3/8] or [9/8] time _tempus perfectum_, and adopting for\r\nits symbol the Pythagorean circle [O.] or [O], so Hucbald,\r\nin choosing his series of concords or sounds that harmonize\r\nwell together, took the first three notes of the overtones of\r\nevery sonorous fundamental, or, to express it differently, of\r\nthe series of natural harmonics, that is to say, he admitted\r\nthe octave and fifth: [F: g, d g]. But from the fifth to the\r\noctave gives the interval of the fourth, therefore he permitted\r\nthis combination also.\r\n\r\nFrom the works of Boethius (_circa_ 400) and others, he had\r\nderived and accepted the Pythagorean division of the scale,\r\nmaking thirds and sixths dissonant intervals; and so his perfect\r\nchord (from which our later triad gets its name of _perfect_)\r\nwas composed of a root, fifth or fourth, and octave.\r\n\r\nHucbald, as I have already explained, changed the Greek tone\r\nsystem somewhat by arranging it in four regular disjunct\r\ntetrachords, namely:\r\n\r\n    [F: (g, a, b-, c) (d e f g) G: (a b c' d') (e' f+' g' a')]\r\n\r\nThis system permitted the addition of a fifth to each note\r\nindiscriminately, and the fifths would always be _perfect_; but\r\nin regard to the octaves it was faulty, for obvious reasons. As\r\nhis system of notation consisted of merely writing T for tone\r\nand S for semitone between the lines of his staff, it was only\r\nnecessary to change the order of these letters for the octave\r\nat the beginning of each line. With the fourth, however,\r\nthis device was impossible, and therefore he laid down the\r\nrule that when the voices proceeded in fourths, and a discord\r\n(or augmented fourth) was unavoidable, the lower voice was to\r\nremain on the same note until it could jump to another fourth\r\nforming a perfect interval:\r\n\r\n  [F: {g b} {g b} {g a} {g b} {d a} {d g} {c f} {c e} {a, d} {g, c}]\r\n\r\nThis at least brought into the harmony an occasional third,\r\nwhich gradually became a recognized factor in music.\r\n\r\nWe probably know that the year 1000 was generally accepted\r\nas the time when the world was to come to an end. In the\r\n_Bibliotheque Nationale_ in Paris there is a manuscript\r\ncontaining the prophecy which had been handed down for many\r\ncenturies; also the signs for the notes to which it was to be\r\nsung, viz.:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 07]\r\n\r\nThe text is:\r\n\r\n    The Judge will speak and the earth shall tremble\r\n    with awe. The stars shall be destroyed and the glory\r\n    of the moon shall die, the mountains shall be crushed\r\n    and the world with all in it shall utterly perish.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the eleventh century, such was the relief\r\nfrom this fear which had been oppressing Christendom, that even\r\nthe church reflected it in such strange rites as the _Feast\r\nof Asses_ (January 14th), which was a burlesque of the Mass.\r\n\r\nIn this travesty of the Mass a young girl, dressed to\r\nrepresent the Virgin, riding on an ass and carrying a child\r\nin her arms, was conducted to the church door. Upon being\r\nadmitted and riding up the aisle to the altar, the girl\r\ntethered the ass to the railing and sat on the steps until\r\nthe service was finished. The _Credo_, _Gloria_, etc., all\r\nended with a \"hee-haw,\" and at the conclusion of the service\r\nthe officiating priest brayed three times, and was answered by\r\nthe congregation. The mixing of the vernacular with Latin in\r\nthis service is the first instance of the use of any language\r\nbut Latin in church music.\r\n\r\nThis quasi-symbolical pantomime gave rise in time to the\r\nmediaeval Passion Plays, or Mysteries, as they were called. That\r\nthese travesties of the Mass took different forms in various\r\ncountries is very evident when we remember the description\r\nof the \"Abbot of Unreason,\" in Scott's \"Abbot.\" In England,\r\namong other absurdities such as the \"Pope of Fools,\" the \"Ball\r\nDance,\" etc., they also had the festival of the \"Boy Bishop,\"\r\nin which, between the sixth and twenty-eighth of December,\r\na boy was made to perform all the functions of a bishop.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that all this has but little bearing upon\r\nthe development of music. As a matter of fact it was a most\r\npotent factor in it, for music was essentially and exclusively\r\na church property. By permitting the people to secularize\r\nthe church rites at certain seasons, it was inevitable that\r\nchurch music would also become common property for a time,\r\nwith this difference, however, that the common people could\r\ncarry the tunes away with them, and the music would be the only\r\nthing remaining as a recollection of the carnival. Indeed, the\r\nprevalence of popular songs soon became such that writers of\r\nchurch music began to use them instead of their being derived\r\nfrom church music, as was originally the case. This continued to\r\nsuch an extent that almost up to 1550 a mass was known by the\r\nname of the popular song it was based upon, as, for instance,\r\nthe mass of the \"Man in Armour,\" by Josquin des Pres, and those\r\nentitled \"_Je prends conge_\" and \"_Je veult cent mille ecus_.\"\r\n\r\nNow we know that the _tempus perfectum_ was _par excellence_\r\n[9/8] and [3/4] time. It was natural therefore that these first\r\nchurch tunes should have been changed to dances in the hands\r\nof the common people. Even in these dances it is interesting to\r\nnote that the same symbolic significance appears to be present,\r\nfor the earliest form of these dances was the \"round song,\"\r\nor roundelay, and it was danced in a circle.\r\n\r\nDuple time did not come into general use until the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century. About the same time, the organum (as it\r\nwas called) or system of harmonization of Hucbald was discarded,\r\nand Johannes de Muris and Philippe de Vitry championed the\r\nconsonant quality of the third and sixth, both major and minor.\r\nThe fifth was retained as a consonant, but the fourth was\r\npassed over in silence by the French school of writers, or\r\nclassed with the dissonants. Successive fifths were prohibited\r\nas being too harshly dissonant, but successive fourths were\r\nnecessarily permitted, as it would be an impossibility to do\r\nwithout them. Nevertheless, the fourth was still considered\r\na dissonance, and was permitted only between the upper parts\r\nof the music. Thus the harsh consecutive passages in fifths\r\nand fourths of the organum of Hucbald disappeared in favour\r\nof the softer progressions of thirds and sixths.\r\n\r\nIn order to make clear how the new science of counterpoint\r\ncame into existence, I must again revert to Hucbald.[09]\r\n\r\nBefore his time, all \"recognized\" music was a more or less\r\nmelodious succession of tones, generally of the same length,\r\none syllable being sometimes used for many notes. He discovered\r\nthat a melody might be sung by several singers, each commencing\r\nat a different pitch instead of all singing the same notes at\r\nthe same time. He also laid down rules as to how this was to\r\nbe done to produce the best effect. We remember why he chose\r\nthe fourth, fifth, and octave in preference to the third and\r\nsixth. He called his system an \"organum\" or \"diaphony,\" and\r\nto sing according to his rules was called to \"organize\" or\r\n\"organate.\" We must remember that at that time fourths and\r\nfifths were not always indicated in the written music; only\r\nthe melody, which was called the principal or subject. By\r\nstudying the rules prescribed for the organum, the singers\r\ncould add the proper intervals to the melody. We must keep\r\nin mind, however, that later fourths were preferred to fifths\r\n(being considered less harsh), and that the musical scale of\r\nthe period compelled the different voices to vary slightly,\r\nthat is to say, two voices could not sing exactly the same\r\nmelody at the interval of a fourth without the use of sharps\r\nor flats; therefore one voice continued on the same note until\r\nthe awkward place was passed, and then proceeded in fourths\r\nagain with the other voice as before:\r\n\r\n    [G: {e' a'} {d' g'} {d' f+'} {d' e'}]\r\n\r\nOn account of the augmented fourth that would occur by a strict\r\nadherence to the melodic structure of the subject, the following\r\nwould have been impossible: [G: {e' a'} {d' g'} ({c' f+'})]\r\nThus we find the first instance of the use of thirds, and also\r\nof oblique motion as opposed to the earlier inevitable parallel\r\nmotion of the voices. This necessary freedom in singing the\r\norganum or diaphony led to the attempt to sing two _different_\r\nmelodies, one against the other--\"note against note,\" or\r\n\"point counter point,\"[10] point or _punct_ being the name\r\nfor the written note. There being now two distinct melodies,\r\nboth had to be _noted_ instead of leaving it to the singers\r\nto add their parts extemporaneously, according to the rules of\r\nthe organum, as they had done previously. Already earlier than\r\nthis (in 1100), owing to the tendency to discard consecutive\r\nfourths and fifths, the intermovement of the voices, from\r\nbeing parallel and oblique, became _contrary_, thus avoiding\r\nthe parallel succession of intervals. The name \"organum\" was\r\ndropped and the new system became known as tenor and descant,\r\nthe tenor being the principal or foundation melody, and the\r\ndescant or descants (for there could be as many as there\r\nwere parts or voices to the music) taking the place of the\r\norganum. The difference between _discantus_ and _diaphony_\r\nwas that the latter consisted of several parts or voices,\r\nwhich, however, were more or less exact reproductions, at\r\ndifferent pitch, of the principal or given melody, while the\r\nformer was composed of entirely different melodic and rhythmic\r\nmaterial. This gave rise to the science of counterpoint, which,\r\nas I have said, consists of the trick of making a number\r\nof voices sing different melodies at the same time without\r\nviolating certain given rules. The given melody or \"principal\"\r\nsoon acquired the name of _cantus firmus_, and the other parts\r\nwere each called _contrapunctus_,[11] as before they had been\r\ncalled tenor and descant. These names were first used by Gerson,\r\nChancellor of Notre Dame, Paris, about 1400.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (about 1300-1375), the occasional use of thirds\r\nand sixths in the diaphonies previously explained led to an\r\nentirely different kind of singing, called _falso bordone_\r\nor _faux bourdon_ (_bordonizare_, \"to drone,\" comes from a\r\nkind of pedal in organum that first brought the third into\r\nuse). This system, contrary to the old organum, consisted of\r\nusing only thirds and sixths together, excluding the fourth\r\nand fifth entirely, except in the first and last bars. This\r\ninnovation has been ascribed to the Flemish singers attached\r\nto the Papal Choir (about 1377), when Pope Gregory XI returned\r\nfrom Avignon to Rome. In the British Museum, however, there\r\nare manuscripts dating from the previous century, showing\r\nthat the _faux bourdon_ had already commenced to make its way\r\nagainst the old systems of Hucbald and Guido. The combination\r\nof the _faux bourdon_ and the remnant of the organum gives us\r\nthe foundation for our modern tone system. The old rules,\r\nmaking plagal motion of the different voices preferable to\r\nparallel motion, and contrary motion preferable to either,\r\nstill hold good in our works on theory; so also in regard to\r\nthe rules forbidding consecutive fifths and octaves, leaving\r\nthe question of the fourth in doubt.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we may say, therefore, that up to the sixteenth\r\ncentury, all music was composed of the slender material of\r\nthirds, sixths, fifths, and octaves, fourths being permitted\r\nonly _between_ the voices; consecutive successions of fourths,\r\nhowever, were permitted, a license not allowed in the use of\r\nfifths or octaves. This leads us directly to a consideration\r\nof the laws of counterpoint and fugue, laws that have remained\r\npractically unchanged up to the present, with the one difference\r\nthat, instead of being restricted to the meagre material of\r\nthe so-called consonants, the growing use of what were once\r\ncalled dissonant chords, such as the dominant seventh, ninth,\r\ndiminished seventh, and latterly the so-called altered chords,\r\nhas brought new riches to the art.\r\n\r\nInstead of going at once into a consideration of the laws\r\nof counterpoint, it will be well to take up the development\r\nof the instrumental resources of the time. There were three\r\ndistinct types of music: the ecclesiastical type (which of\r\ncourse predominated) found its expression in melodies sung\r\nby church choirs, four or more melodies being sometimes sung\r\nsimultaneously, in accordance with certain fixed rules,\r\nas I have already explained. These melodies or chants\r\nwere often accompanied by the organ, of which we will speak\r\nlater. The second type was purely instrumental, and served as\r\nan accompaniment for the dance, or consisted of _fanfares_\r\n(ceremonial horn signals), or hunting signals. The third\r\ntype was that of the so-called _trouveres_ or _troubadours_,\r\nwith their _jongleurs_, and the minnesingers, and, later, the\r\nmastersingers. All these \"minstrels,\" as we may call them,\r\naccompanied their singing by some instrument, generally one\r\nof the lute type or the psaltery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[09] There is much question as to Hucbald's organum. That\r\n     actually these dissonances were used even up to 1500 is\r\n     proved by Franco Gafurius of Milan, who mentions a Litany\r\n     for the Dead (_De Profundis_) much used at that time:\r\n\r\n     [G: {f' g'} {f' g'} {g' a'} {g' a'} {g' c''} {e' a'} {f' g'}]\r\n     [W: De profundis, etc.]\r\n\r\n[10] Counterpoint is first mentioned by Muris (1300).\r\n\r\n[11] Only principal (tenor or cantus firmus) was sung to words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMUSICAL INSTRUMENTS--THEIR HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn church music, the organ is perhaps the first instrument to\r\nbe considered. In 951, Elfeg, the Bishop of Winchester had\r\nbuilt in his cathedral a great organ which had four hundred\r\npipes and twenty-six pairs of bellows, to manage which seventy\r\nstrong men were necessary. Wolstan, in his life of St. Swithin,\r\nthe Benedictine monk, gives an account of the exhausting work\r\nrequired to keep the bellows in action.\r\n\r\nTwo performers were necessary to play this organ, just as\r\nnowadays we play four-hand music on the piano. The keys went\r\ndown with such difficulty that the players had to use their\r\nelbows or fists on each key; therefore it is easy to see that,\r\nat the most, only four keys could be pressed down at the same\r\ntime. On the other hand, each key when pressed down or pushed\r\nback (for in the early organs the keyboard was perpendicular)\r\ngave the wind from the bellows access to ten pipes each, which\r\nwere probably tuned in octaves or, possibly, according to the\r\norganum of Hucbald, in fifths or fourths. This particular organ\r\nhad two sets of keys (called manuals), one for each player;\r\nthere were twenty keys to each manual, and every key caused\r\nten pipes to sound. The compass of this organ was restricted\r\nto ten notes, repeated at the distance of an octave, and,\r\nthere being four hundred pipes, forty pipes were available for\r\neach note. On each key was inscribed the name of the note. As\r\nmay be imagined, the tone of this instrument was such that it\r\ncould be heard at a great distance.\r\n\r\nThere were many smaller organs, as, for instance, the one in the\r\nmonastery of Ramsey, which had copper pipes. Pictures of others\r\nfrom the twelfth century show that even where there were only\r\nten pipes, the organ had two manuals, needed two players, and at\r\nleast four men for the bellows. The great exertion required to\r\nplay these instruments led to the invention of what is called\r\n\"mixtures.\" From the moment fifths and fourths were considered\r\nto sound better together than the simple notes, the pipes were\r\nso arranged that the player did not need to press two of the\r\nponderous organ keys for this combination of sounds. One key\r\nwas made to open the valves of the two sets of pipes, so that\r\neach key, instead of sounding one note, would, at will, sound\r\nthe open fifth, fourth, or octave. With the addition of the\r\nthird, thus constituting a perfect major triad, this barbarous\r\nhabit has come down to our present day almost unchanged, for by\r\nusing what is called the \"mixture stop\" of our modern organs,\r\neach key of the manual gives not only the original note,\r\nbut also its perfect major triad, several octaves higher.\r\n\r\nOriginally the organ was used only to give the right intonation\r\nfor the chanting of the priests. From the twelfth century, small\r\nportable organs of limited compass were much used; although the\r\ntone of these instruments was necessarily slight, and, owing to\r\nthe shortness of the pipes, high in pitch, the principle of the\r\nmechanism was similar to that of the larger instruments. They\r\nwere hung by means of a strap passed over the shoulders;\r\none hand pressed the keys in front of the pipes (which were\r\narranged perpendicularly), and the other hand operated the\r\nsmall bellows behind the pipes. These small instruments rarely\r\nhad more than eight pipes, consequently they possessed only\r\nthe compass of an octave. With slight variations, they were\r\nquite universally used up to the seventeenth century. Organ\r\npedals were invented in Germany about 1325. Bernhard, organist\r\nof St. Mark's, Venice (1445-1459), has been credited with the\r\ninvention of organ pedals, but it is probable that he merely\r\nintroduced them into Italy.\r\n\r\nAs the Greek modes formed the basis for the musical system of\r\nthe church, so the Greek monochord is the type from which the\r\nmonks evolved what they called the clavichord. The monochord\r\nhas a movable bridge, therefore some time is lost in adjusting\r\nit in order to get the different tones. To obviate this\r\ninconvenience, a number of strings were placed side by side,\r\nand a mechanism inserted which, by pressing a key (_clavis_),\r\nwould move the bridge to the point at which the string must\r\ndivide to give the note indicated by the key. This made it\r\npossible to use one string for several different notes, and\r\nexplains why the clavichord or clavicembalo needed comparatively\r\nfew strings. This instrument became obsolete toward the end\r\nof the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe other species of instrument, the harpsichord, which was\r\ninvented about 1400, and which may be considered as having\r\nsprung from the clavichord, consisted of a separate string for\r\neach sound; the key, instead of setting in action a device\r\nfor striking and at the same time _dividing_ the strings,\r\ncaused the strings to be plucked by quills. Thus, in these\r\ninstruments, not only was an entirely different quality of tone\r\nproduced, but the pitch of a string remained unaltered. These\r\ninstruments were called _bundfrei_, \"unbound,\" in opposition to\r\nthe _clavicembalo_, which was called _gebunden_, or \"bound.\" The\r\nharpsichord was much more complicated than the clavichord,\r\nin that the latter ceased to sound when the key which moved\r\nthe bridge was released, whereas the harpsichord required what\r\nis called a \"damper\" to stop the sound when the key came up;\r\nonce the string was touched by the quill, all command of the\r\ntone by the key was lost. To regulate this, a device was added\r\nto the instrument by means of which a damper fell on the string\r\nwhen the key was released, thereby stopping the sound.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the instrumental development of the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\nAn instrument of the harpsichord family which has significance\r\nin the development of the instruments of the Middle Ages is\r\nthe spinet (from _spina_, \"thorn\"; it had leather points up\r\nto 1500), first made by Johannes Spinctus, Venice, 1500. It\r\nwas a harpsichord with a _square_ case, the strings running\r\ndiagonally instead of lengthwise. When the spinet was of\r\nvery small dimensions it was called a virginal; when it was\r\nin the shape of our modern grand piano, it was, of course,\r\na harpsichord; and when the strings and sounding board\r\nwere arranged perpendicularly, the instrument was called\r\na clavicitherium. As early as 1500, then, four different\r\ninstruments were in general use, the larger ones having a\r\ncompass of about four octaves. The connecting link between the\r\nharpsichord, the clavichord, and the piano, was the dulcimer or\r\nhackbrett, which was a tavern instrument. Pantaleon Hebenstreit,\r\na dancing master and inventor of Leipzig, in 1705 added an\r\nimproved hammer action, which was first applied to keyboard\r\ninstruments by Cristofori, an instrument maker at Florence\r\n(1711). His instrument was called _forte-piano_ or _pianoforte_,\r\nbecause it would strike loud or soft.\r\n\r\nThese instruments all descended from the ancient lyre, the\r\nonly difference being that instead of causing the strings to\r\nvibrate by means of a plectrum held in the hand, the plectrum\r\nwas set in motion by the mechanism of the _claves_ or keys. The\r\nsystem of fingering employed in playing the harpsichord, up to\r\n1700, did not make use of the thumb. J.S. Bach, F. Couperin,\r\nand J.P. Rameau were the pioneers in this matter. The first\r\npublished work on piano technique and fingering was that by\r\nC.P.E. Bach (1753).\r\n\r\nWith the advent of bowed instruments the foundation was laid for\r\nthe modern orchestra, of which they are the natural basis. The\r\nquestion of the antiquity of the bowed instrument has often been\r\ndiscussed, with the result that the latter has been definitely\r\nclassed as essentially modern, for the reason that it did not\r\nbecome known in Europe until about the tenth to the twelfth\r\ncenturies. As a matter of fact, the instrument is doubtless\r\nof Person or Hindu origin, and was brought to the West by\r\nthe Arabs, who were in Spain from the eighth to the fifteenth\r\ncenturies; in fact, most of our stringed instruments, both the\r\nbowed and those of the lyre type, we owe to the Arabs--the very\r\nname of the lute, _el oud_ (\"shell\" in Arabic) became _liuto_ in\r\nItalian, in German _laute_, and in English lute. There were many\r\nvarieties of these bowed instruments, and it is thought that the\r\nprinciple arose from rubbing one instrument with another. The\r\nonly other known examples of bowed instruments of primitive\r\ntype are (1) the _ravanastron_, an instrument of the monochord\r\ntype, native to India, made to vibrate by a kind of bow with\r\na string stretched from end to end; (2) the Welsh _chrotta_\r\n(609 A.D.), a primitive lyre-shaped instrument, with which,\r\nhowever, the use of the bow seems to have been a much later\r\ninvention. Mention should also be made of the marine trumpet,\r\nmuch in vogue from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries;\r\nit consisted of a long, narrow, resonant box, composed of\r\nthree boards, over which was stretched a single string;\r\nother unchangeable strings, struck with the bow, served as\r\ndrones. Only the harmonics were played on the marine trumpet.\r\n\r\nThe principle of procuring the vibrations in stringed\r\ninstruments by means of a bow was, of course, applied to the\r\nmonochord class of keyed instruments, and was thus the origin\r\nof the hurdy-gurdy, which consisted of a wheel covered with\r\nresined leather and turned by a crank.\r\n\r\nThe bowed instruments were originally of two types, the first\r\nin the form of the lute or mandolin; the second probably\r\nderived from the Welsh _crwth_, consisting of a flat, long box\r\nstrung with strings (called fidel from _fides_, \"string\"). The\r\ncombination of these types, which were subjected to the most\r\nfantastic changes of shape, led eventually to the modern\r\nviolin family.\r\n\r\nWe know that the highest plane of perfection in the violin\r\nwas reached in Italy about 1600. The Cremona makers, Amati,\r\nGuarnerius, and Stradivarius, made their most celebrated\r\ninstruments between 1600 and 1750.\r\n\r\nThe violin bow, in its earliest form, was nothing more than an\r\nordinary bow with a stretched string; Corelli and Tartini used a\r\nbow of the kind. The present shape of the bow is due to Tourte,\r\na Paris maker, who experimented in conjunction with Viotti,\r\nthe celebrated violinist.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the original lute and the Arabian _rebeck_\r\nor Welsh _crwth_ (originally Latin _chorus_), we can see how\r\nthe modern violin received its generally rounded shape from\r\nthe lute, its flatness from the _rebeck_, the sides of the\r\ninstrument being cut out in order to give the bow free access\r\nto the side strings. The name too, _fidula_ or _vidula_,\r\nfrom mediaeval Latin _fides_, \"string,\" became fiddle and\r\nviola, the smaller viola being called violino, the larger,\r\nvioloncello and viola da gamba.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, the different species of bowed instrument\r\nnumbered from fifteen to twenty, and it was not until between\r\n1600 and 1700 that the modern forms of these instruments\r\nobtained the ascendancy.\r\n\r\nOf the wind instruments it was naturally the flute that\r\nretained its antique form; the only difference between the\r\nmodern instrument and the ancient one being that the former\r\nis blown crosswise, instead of perpendicularly. Quantz,\r\nthe celebrated court flute player to Frederick the Great\r\nof Prussia, was the first to publish, in 1750, a so-called\r\n\"method\" of playing the traversal (crosswise) flute.\r\n\r\nWith the reed instruments the change in modern times is more\r\nstriking. The original form of the reed instruments was of the\r\ndouble-reed variety. The oldest known mention of them dates from\r\n650 A.D., when the name applied is _calamus_ (reed); later the\r\nnames _shalmei_ (_chalumeau_, \"straw,\" from German _halm_) and\r\n_shawm_ were used. These instruments were played by means of a\r\nbell-shaped mouthpiece, the double reed being fixed inside the\r\ntube. It was not until toward the end of the sixteenth century\r\nthat the bell-shaped mouthpiece was dispensed with and the reed\r\nbrought directly to the lips, thus giving the player greater\r\npower of expression. The oboe is a representative type of the\r\nhigher pitched double-reed instruments. In its present shape it\r\nis about two hundred years old. As the deeper toned instruments\r\nwere necessarily very long, six to eight and even ten feet,\r\nan assistant had to walk before the performer, holding the\r\ntube on his shoulder. This inconvenience led to bending the\r\ntube back on itself, making it look somewhat like a bundle of\r\nsticks, hence the word _faggot_; although it is commonly known\r\nin this country by the French name, _bassoon_. This manner of\r\narranging the instrument dates from about the year 1550. The\r\nclarinet is an essentially modern instrument, the single\r\nbeating reed and cylindrical tube coming into use about 1700,\r\nthe invention of a German named Denner, who lived at Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nAll the brass instruments of the Middle Ages seem to have\r\nbeen very short, therefore high in pitch. We remember that\r\nthe Romans had trumpets (chiefly used in signalling) called\r\n_buccina_, and we may assume that the whole modern family of\r\nbrass instruments has descended from this primitive type. As\r\nlate as 1500, the hunting horn consisted of but one loop which\r\npassed over the shoulder and around the body of the player.\r\nA horn of from six to seven feet in length was first used\r\nabout 1650; and we know that, owing to the smallness of the\r\ninstruments and their consequent high pitch in those days, many\r\nof Bach's scores contain parts absolutely impracticable for our\r\nmodern brass instruments. The division of these instruments\r\ninto classes, such as trumpets, horns, trombones, etc., is\r\ndue to the differences in shape, which in turn produce tones\r\nof different quality. The large bore of the trombone gives\r\ngreat volume to the tone, the small bore of the trumpet great\r\nbrilliancy, the medium bore of the horn veils the brilliancy\r\non one hand and lightens the thickness of tone on the other.\r\n\r\nThe horn, called _cor de chasse_, was first used in the\r\norchestra in 1664, in one of Lully's operas, but its technique\r\n(stopped tones and crooks) was only properly understood about\r\n1750; the present-day valve horn did not come into general\r\nuse until within the last half century. Fifty years before\r\nthe principle had been applied to the horn the trumpet had\r\ncrooks and slides, a mechanism which, in the trumpet, is still\r\nretained in England, pointing to the fact that the trombone is,\r\nafter all, nothing but a very large kind of trumpet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nFOLK SONG AND ITS RELATION TO NATIONALISM IN MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand as well as to feel music, we must reduce\r\nit to its primary elements, and these are to be found in folk\r\nsong, or, to go further back, in its predecessor, the chant\r\nof the savages.\r\n\r\nFolk music may be likened to a twig which has fallen into a\r\nsalt mine, to borrow an expression from Taine; every year adds\r\nfresh jewels to the crystals that form on it until at last the\r\nonly resemblance to the original is in the general contour. We\r\nknow that the nucleus of melody lies in one note, just as the\r\norigin of language is to be sought for in the word. Therefore\r\nfolk music proper must be separated from what may be called\r\nbarbaric music, the most primitive type of the latter being\r\nthe \"one-note\" strain from which spring the melodies of the\r\npeople. This one-note form passes through many rhythmical\r\nchanges before song becomes developed to the extent of adding\r\nseveral notes to its means of expression. The next development\r\nof savage chanting (which is the precursor of folk song) may\r\nbe traced back to its two elements, one of which was a mere\r\nsavage howl, and the other, that raising of the voice under\r\nstress of strong emotion which still constitutes one of our\r\nprincipal means of expression.\r\n\r\nThus, in this barbaric music we invariably find three\r\nprinciples: 1, rhythm; 2, the howl or descending scale of\r\nundefined intervals; and 3, the emotional raising of the\r\nvoice. The rhythm, which characterizes the most primitive\r\nform of song or chant, consists of the incessant repetition\r\nof a very small group of rhythmic sounds. This incessant\r\nrecurrence of one idea is characteristic of primitive, weak,\r\nor insane natures. The second principle, which invariably\r\nincludes the first (pointing to a slightly more advanced state\r\nof development), is met with in many folk songs of even modern\r\ntimes. The third principle is one which indicates the transition\r\nstage from primitive or barbaric music to folk music.\r\n\r\nTo the primitive savage mind, the smallest rhythmic phrase is a\r\nwonderful invention, therefore it is repeated incessantly. Add\r\nto that a certain joy in mere sound, and we have the howl,\r\nwhich certainly follows the sequence of nature, for a thunder\r\nclap, or the phenomenon of echo, is its prototype, being a loud\r\nexplosion followed by a more or less regular sequence of minor\r\nreverberations. When the accent of passion is added to these\r\ntwo principles--will and nature--we have laid the aesthetic\r\nfoundation for all that we call music.[12] The example of a\r\nloud tone with gradually ascending inflections has only been\r\nfound in the most perverted types of humanity; for instance, an\r\nEnglish writer quaintly alludes to the songs of the Polynesian\r\ncannibals as consisting of \"gruesomely suggestive passages\r\nof rising quarter-tones sung gloatingly before their living\r\ncaptives who are soon to be devoured.\"\r\n\r\nNow traces of these three elements are to be found in every\r\nfolk song known, and we may even trace their influence in\r\nmodern music, the lowest or most primitive being, as I have\r\nsaid, the \"one-note\" type, the next what I have called the\r\n\"howl\" type, the third the highest or \"emotional\" type.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the first type, chants such as these [Figure 08],\r\nare to be heard in every part of the globe, the rhythmic figure\r\nbeing necessarily short and repeated incessantly.\r\n\r\nThe next step was a tremendous advance, and we find its\r\ninfluence permeating all music. The most primitive specimens of\r\nthis type we find among the Jute Indians [Figure 09], a mixture\r\nof one and two. The same is to be found in Australia, slightly\r\nmodified: [Figure 10] The Caribs have the same song\r\n[G: g'' \\ Chromatic g']. We find it again in Hungary, although\r\nin a still more modified form, thus:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 11]\r\n\r\nAnd last of all we meet with it in its primitive state in the\r\nfolk song used by Bizet in \"Carmen.\" We can even see traces of\r\nit in the quasi-folk song of the present century:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 12] etc.\r\n\r\nThe third element of folk song shows again a great advance,\r\nfor instead of the mere howl of pleasure or pain, we have a\r\nmore or less exactly graded expression of feeling. In speaking\r\nof impassioned speech I explained the relative values of the\r\ninflections of the voice, how the upward skip of the fourth,\r\nfifth, and octave indicates the intensity of the emotion\r\ncausing the cry. When this element is brought into music, it\r\ngives a vitality not before possessed, for by this it becomes\r\nspeech. When in such music this inflection rhymes with the\r\nwords, that is to say, when the speech finds its emotional\r\nreflection in the music, we have reached the highest development\r\nof folk song. In its best state, this is immeasurably superior\r\nto much of our \"made\" music, only too often false in rhythm,\r\nfeeling, and declamation.\r\n\r\nAmong the different nations, these three characteristics often\r\nbecome obscured by national idiosyncracies. Much of the Chinese\r\nmusic, the \"Hymn to the Ancestors,\" for instance, seemingly\r\ncovers a number of notes, whereas, in fact, it belongs to the\r\none-note type. We find that their melodies almost invariably\r\nreturn to the same note, the intervening sounds being more\r\nor less merely variations above and below the pitch of the\r\nprincipal sound. For example:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 13]\r\n\r\nHungarian folk music has been much distorted by the oriental\r\nelement, as represented by the _zingari_ or gypsies.\r\nThe Hungarian type of folk music is one of the highest, and\r\nis extremely severe in its contours, as shown in the following:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 14]\r\n\r\nThe gypsy element as copied by Liszt has obscured the folk\r\nmelodies by innumerable arabesques and ornaments of all sorts,\r\noften covering even a \"one-note\" type of melody until it seems\r\nlike a complicated design.\r\n\r\nThis elaboration of detail and the addition of passing and\r\nornamental notes to every melody is distinctly an oriental\r\ntrait, which finds vent not only in music but also in\r\narchitecture, designing, carving, etc. It is considered by many\r\nan element of weakness, seeking to cover a poverty of thought\r\nby rich vestments. And yet, to my mind, nothing can be more\r\nmisleading. In spite of Sir Hubert Parry and other writers,\r\nI cannot think that the Moors in Spain, for instance, covered\r\npoverty of thought beneath superficial ingenuity of design. The\r\nAlhambra outdoes in \"passage work,\" in virtuoso arabesques,\r\nall that an army of Liszts could do in piano literature;\r\nand yet the Arabs were the saviours of science, and promoted\r\nthe greatest learning and depth of thought known in Europe in\r\ntheir time. As for Liszt, there is such an astounding wealth\r\nof poetry and deep feeling beneath the somewhat \"flashy,\"\r\nbombastic trick of speech he inherited, that the true lover\r\nof music can no more allow his feelings to be led astray by\r\nsuch externals than one would judge a man's mind by the cut\r\nof his coat or the hat he wears.\r\n\r\nThus we see the essence of folk song is comprised in the three\r\nelements mentioned, and its aesthetic value may be determined\r\nby the manner in which these elements are combined and their\r\nrelative preponderance.\r\n\r\nOne point must be very distinctly understood, namely, that what\r\nwe call harmonization of a melody cannot be admitted as forming\r\nany part of folk song. Folk melodies are, without exception,\r\nhomophonous. This being the case, perhaps my statement that the\r\nvital principle of folk music in its best state has nothing in\r\ncommon with nationalism (considered in the usual sense of the\r\nword), will be better understood. And this will be the proof\r\nthat nationalism, so-called, is merely an extraneous thing\r\nthat has no part in pure art. For if we take any melody, even\r\nof the most pronounced national type, and merely eliminate the\r\ncharacteristic turns, affectations, or mannerisms, the theme\r\nbecomes simply music, and retains no touch of nationality. We\r\nmay even go further; for if we retain the characteristic\r\nmannerisms of dress, we may harmonize a folk song in such a\r\nmanner that it will belie its origin; and by means of this\r\npowerful factor (an essentially modern invention) we may even\r\ntransform a Scotch song, with all its \"snap\" and character,\r\ninto a Chinese song, or give it an Arabian flavour. This,\r\nto be sure, is possible only to a limited degree; enough,\r\nhowever, to prove to us the power of harmony; and harmony,\r\nas I have said, has no part in folk song.\r\n\r\nTo define the _role_ of harmony in music is no easy matter.\r\nJust as speech has its shadow languages, gesture and expression;\r\njust as man is a duality of idealism and materialism; just as\r\nmusic itself is a union of the emotional and the intellectual,\r\nso harmony is the shadow language of melody; and just as in\r\nspeech this shadow language overwhelms the spoken word, so\r\nin music harmony controls the melody. For example: Imagine\r\nthe words \"I will kill you\" being said in a jesting tone of\r\nvoice and with a pleasant expression of the face; the import\r\nof the words would be lost in their expression; the mere words\r\nwould mean nothing to us in comparison with the expression\r\nthat accompanied them.\r\n\r\nTake away the harmonic structure upon which Wagner built his\r\noperas and it would be difficult to form a conception of the\r\nmarvellous potency of his music. Melody, therefore, may be\r\nclassed as the gift of folk song to music; and harmony is its\r\nshadow language. When these two powers, melody and harmony,\r\nsupplement each other, when one completes the thought of the\r\nother, then, provided the thought be a noble one, the effect\r\nwill be overwhelmingly convincing, and we have great music. The\r\ncontrary results when one contradicts the other, and that\r\nis only too often the case; for we hear the mildest waltzes\r\ndressed up in tragic and dramatic chords, which, like Bottom,\r\n\"roar as gently as any sucking dove.\"\r\n\r\nIn discussing the origin of speech, mention was made of those\r\nshadow languages which accompany all our spoken words, namely,\r\nthe languages of expression and gesture. These were surely\r\nthe very first auxiliaries of uttered speech, and in the same\r\nway we find that they constitute the first sign of advance\r\nin primitive melody. Savages utter the same thought over and\r\nover again, evidently groping after that semblance of Nirvana\r\n(or perhaps it may be better described as \"hypnotic exaltation\")\r\nwhich the incessant repetition of that one thought, accompanied\r\nby its vibrating shadow, sound, would naturally occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was also stated that the relative antiquity or primitivity\r\nof a melody is invariably to be discovered by its degree\r\nof relationship to the original type, one note, one rhythm,\r\nthe emotional, the savage howl, or, in other words, the high\r\nnote followed by a gradual descent. To confirm this theory of\r\nthe origin of folk song, we need only look at the aboriginal\r\nchants of widely separated peoples to find that the oldest\r\nsongs all resemble one another, despite the fact that they\r\noriginated in widely separated localities.\r\n\r\nNow the difference between this primitive music and that\r\nwhich we call folk song is that the latter is characterized\r\nby a feeling for design, in the broadest sense of the word,\r\nentirely lacking in the former. For we find that although\r\nfolk song is composed of the same material as savage music,\r\nthe material is arranged coherently into sentences instead of\r\nremaining the mere exclamation of passion or a nerve exciting\r\nreiteration of unchanging rhythms and vibrations, as is the\r\ncase in the music of the savage.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, I wish to draw the line which\r\nseparates savage from folk music very plainly.\r\n\r\nWe know that the first stage in savage music is that of one\r\nnote. Gradually a tone above the original is added on account\r\nof the savage being unable to intone correctly; through\r\nstress of emotion the fifth and octave come into the chant;\r\nthe sixth, being the note above the fifth, is added later,\r\nas is the third, the note above the second. Thus is formed\r\nthe pentatonic scale as it is found all over the world, and\r\nit is clear, therefore, that the development of the scale is\r\ndue to emotional influences.\r\n\r\nThe development of rhythm may be traced to the words sung\r\nor declaimed, and the development of design or form to the\r\ndance. In the following, from Brazil, we find a savage chant\r\nin almost its primitive state:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 15] etc.\r\n\r\nThe next example, also from Brazil, is somewhat better, but\r\nstill formless and unemotional.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 16] etc.\r\n\r\nLet this be danced to, however, and the change is very marked,\r\nfor immediately form, regularity, and design are noticeable:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 17] etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the emotional element marks another very\r\ndecided change, namely, by placing more sounds at the command\r\nof the singer, and also by introducing words, which necessarily\r\ninvest the song with the rhythm of language.\r\n\r\nThus the emotional and declamatory elements heighten the\r\npowers of expression by the greater range given to the voice,\r\nand add the poignancy and rhythm of speech to song. On the\r\nother hand, the dance gives regularity to the rhythmic and\r\nemotional sequences.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples we can see more clearly the elements\r\nof folk song as they exist in savage music:\r\n\r\n  Three or four note (simple)\r\n\r\n    South America [Figure 18]\r\n    Nubia [Figure 19]\r\n\r\n  Emotional (simple)\r\n\r\n    Samoa [Figure 20]\r\n\r\n  Emotional and Composite\r\n\r\n    Hudson's Bay [Figure 21]\r\n    Soudan [Figure 22]\r\n\r\n  Howl and Emotion\r\n\r\n    [Figure 23]\r\n\r\n    Dance. Brazil\r\n    [Figure 24]\r\n    Simple [Figure 25] or\r\n    Dance [Figure 26]\r\n\r\nThe fact that so many nations have the pentatonic or five-note\r\nscale (the Chinese, Basque, Scotch, Hindu, etc.), would seem to\r\npoint to a necessary similarity of their music. This, however,\r\nis not the case. In tracing the differences we shall find\r\nthat true folk song has but few marked national traits, it is\r\nsomething which comes from the heart; whereas nationalism in\r\nmusic is an outward garment which is a result of certain habits\r\nof thought, a _mannerism_ of language so to speak. If we look at\r\nthe music of different nations we find certain characteristics;\r\ndivest the music of these same characteristics and we find\r\nthat the figure upon which this garment of nationalism has\r\nbeen placed is much the same the world over, and that its\r\nrelationship to the universal language of savage music is very\r\nmarked. Carmen's song, divested of the mixture of triplets\r\nand dual rhythms (Spanish or Moorish) is akin to the \"howl.\"\r\n\r\nNationalism may be divided into six different classes:\r\n\r\nFirst we have what may be broadly termed \"orientalism,\"\r\nwhich includes the Hindu, Moorish, Siamese, and Gypsy, the\r\nlatter embracing most of southeastern European (Roumania,\r\netc.) types. Liszt's \"Second Rhapsody,\" opening section,\r\ndivested of orientalism or gypsy characteristics, is merely\r\nof the savage three-note type.\r\n\r\nOur second division may be termed the style of reiteration,\r\nand is to be found in Russia and northern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe third consists of the mannerism known as the \"Scotch snap,\"\r\nand is a rhythmic device which probably originated in that\r\ntrick of jumping from one register of the voice to another,\r\nwhich has always had a fascination for people of simple\r\nnatures. The Swiss _jodel_ is the best illustration of this\r\nin a very exaggerated form.\r\n\r\nThe fourth consists of a seemingly capricious intermixture\r\nof dual and triple rhythm, and is especially noticeable in\r\nSpanish and Portuguese music as well as in that of their South\r\nAmerican descendants. This distinction, however, may be traced\r\ndirectly back to the Moors. For in their wonderful designs we\r\ncontinually see the curved line woven in with the straight, the\r\ncircle with the square, the _tempus perfectum_ with the spondee.\r\nThis would bring this characteristic directly under the head\r\nof orientalism or ornamental development. Yet the peculiarity\r\nis so marked that it seems to call for separate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe fifth type, like the fourth, is open to the objection that\r\nit is merely a phase of the oriental type. It consists of the\r\nincessant use of the augmented second and diminished third,\r\na distinctively Arabian characteristic, and is to be found\r\nin Egypt, also, strange to say, occasionally among our own\r\nNorth American Indians. This, however, is not to be wondered\r\nat, considering that we know nothing of their ancestry. Only\r\nnow and then on that broad sea of mystery do we see a half\r\nsubmerged rock, which gives rise to all sorts of conjectures;\r\nfor example, the custom of the Jutes to wear green robes and\r\nuse fans in certain dances, the finding in the heart of America\r\nof such an Arab tune as this:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 27]\r\n\r\nor such a Russian tune as this:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 28]\r\n\r\nThe last type of nationalism in folk song is almost a negative\r\nquality, its distinguishing mark being mere simplicity,\r\na simplicity which is affected, or possibly assimilated, by\r\nthe writer of such a song; for German folk song proper is a\r\nmade thing, springing not from the people, but from the many\r\ncomposers, both ancient and modern, who have tried their hands\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nWhile this of course takes nationalism out of the composition\r\nof German folk song so-called, the latter has undoubtedly gained\r\nimmensely by it; for by thus divesting music of all its national\r\nmannerisms, it has left the thought itself untroubled by quirks\r\nand turns and a restricted musical scale; it has allowed this\r\nthought to shine out in all its own essential beauty, and thus,\r\nin this so-called German folk song, the greatest effects of\r\npoignancy are often reached through absolute simplicity and\r\ndirectness.\r\n\r\nNow let us take six folk songs and trace first their national\r\ncharacteristics, and after that their scheme of design, for\r\nit is by the latter that the vital principle, so to speak, of\r\na melody is to be recognized, all else being merely external,\r\ncostumes of the different countries in which they were born. And\r\nwe shall see that a melody or thought born among one people\r\nwill change its costume when it migrates to another country.\r\n\r\n  Arab Song\r\n\r\n    [Figure 29]\r\n\r\n    Scheme [Figure 29a]\r\n\r\n  Russia--Reiteration\r\n\r\n    [Figure 30]\r\n\r\n    [Figure 31]\r\n\r\n  Red Sarafan\r\n\r\n    [Figure 32]\r\n\r\n  Scotch\r\n\r\n    [Figure 33]\r\n\r\n    [Figure 34]\r\n\r\n  Irish--Emotional in character, with greater perfection in design\r\n\r\n    [Figure 35]\r\n\r\n  Spanish\r\n\r\n    [Figure 36]\r\n\r\n  Egyptian\r\n\r\n    [Figure 37] (Note augmented intervals)\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of German and English folk songs may be\r\nobserved in the familiar airs of these nations.\r\n\r\nThe epitome of folk song, divested of nationalism, is shown\r\nin the following:\r\n\r\n    [Figure 38]\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] The antiquity of any melody (or its primitiveness) may\r\n     be established according to its rhythmic and melodic\r\n     or human attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE TROUBADOURS, MINNESINGERS AND MASTERSINGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough wandering minstrels or bards have existed since the\r\nworld began, and although the poetry they have left is often\r\nsuggestive, the music to which the words were sung is but\r\nlittle known.\r\n\r\nAbout 700-800 A.D., when all Europe was in a state of dense\r\nignorance and mental degradation, the Arabs were the embodiment\r\nof culture and science, and the Arab empire extended at that\r\ntime over India, Persia, Arabia, Egypt (including Algeria and\r\nBarbary), Portugal, and the Spanish caliphates, Andalusia,\r\nGranada, etc. The descriptions of the splendour at the courts\r\nof the Eastern caliphs at Bagdad seem almost incredible.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Caliph Mahdi is said to have expended\r\nsix millions of dinars of gold in a single pilgrimage to\r\nMecca. His grandson, Almamon, gave in alms, on one single\r\noccasion, two and a half millions of gold pieces, and the\r\nrooms in his palace at Bagdad were hung with thirty-eight\r\nthousand pieces of tapestry, over twelve thousand of which\r\nwere of silk embroidered with gold. The floor carpets were\r\nmore than twenty thousand in number, and the Greek ambassador\r\nwas shown a hundred lions, each with his keeper, as a sign\r\nof the king's royalty, as well as a wonderful tree of gold\r\nand silver, spreading into eighteen large, leafy branches,\r\non which were many birds made of the same precious metals. By\r\nsome mechanical means, the birds sang and the leaves trembled.\r\nNaturally such a court, particularly under the reign of\r\nHaroun-al Raschid (the Just), who succeeded Almamon, would\r\nattract the most celebrated of those Arabian minstrels, such as\r\nZobeir, Ibrahim of Mossoul, and many others who figure in the\r\n\"Arabian Nights,\" real persons and celebrated singers of their\r\ntimes. We read of one of them, Serjab, who, by court jealousy\r\nand intrigues, was forced to leave Bagdad, and found his way\r\nto the Western caliphates, finally reaching Cordova in Spain,\r\nwhere the Caliph Abdalrahman's court vied with that of Bagdad\r\nin luxury. Concerning this we read in Gibbon that in his palace\r\nof Zehra the audience hall was incrusted with gold and pearls,\r\nand that the caliph was attended by twelve thousand horsemen\r\nwhose belts and scimiters were studded with gold.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Arabian influence on the European arts came\r\nto us by the way of Spain, and although we can see traces of\r\nit very plainly in the Spanish music of to-day, the interim of\r\na thousand years has softened its characteristics very much. On\r\nthe other hand, the much more pronounced Arabian characteristics\r\nof Hungarian music are better understood when we recall that the\r\nSaracens were at the gates of Budapesth as late as 1400. That\r\nthe European troubadours should have adopted the Moorish _el\r\noud_ and called it \"lute\" is therefore but natural. And in\r\nall the earlier songs of the troubadours we shall find many\r\ntraces of the same influence; for their _albas_ or _aubades_\r\n(morning songs) came from the Arabic, as did their _serenas_ or\r\nserenades (evening songs), _planhs_ (complaints), and _coblas_\r\n(couplets). The troubadours themselves were so called from\r\n_trobar_, meaning to invent.\r\n\r\nIn the works of Fauriel and St. Polaye, and many others, may\r\nbe found accounts of the origin of the Provencal literature,\r\nincluding, of course, a description of the troubadours.\r\nIt is generally admitted that Provencal poetry has no\r\nconnection with Latin, the origin of this new poetry being very\r\nplausibly ascribed to a gypsy-like class of people mentioned\r\nby the Latin chroniclers of the Middle Ages as _joculares_\r\nor _joculatores_. They were called _joglars_ in Provencal,\r\n_jouglers_ or _jougleors_ in French, and our word \"juggler\"\r\ncomes from the same source. What that source originally was\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that they brought many of the\r\nArab forms of dance and poetry into Christian Europe. For\r\ninstance, two forms of Provencal poetry are the counterpart\r\nof the Arabian _cosidas_ or long poem, all on one rhyme; and\r\nthe _maouchahs_ or short poem, also rhymed. The _saraband_,\r\nor Saracen dance, and later the morris dance (_Moresco_\r\nor _Fandango_) or Moorish dance, seem to point to the same\r\norigin. In order to make it clearer I will quote an Arabian\r\nsong from a manuscript in the British Museum, and place beside\r\nit one by the troubadour Capdeuil.\r\n\r\n    Arabian Melody [Figure 39]\r\n\r\n    Pons de Capdeuil [Figure 40]\r\n\r\nThe troubadours must not be confounded with the _jougleurs_\r\n(more commonly written _jongleurs_). The latter, wandering,\r\nmendicant musicians, ready to play the lute, sing, dance, or\r\n\"juggle,\" were welcomed as merry-makers at all rich houses,\r\nand it soon became a custom for rich nobles to have a number\r\nof them at their courts. The troubadour was a very different\r\nperson, generally a noble who wrote poems, set them to music,\r\nand employed _jongleurs_ to sing and play them. In the South\r\nthese songs were generally of an amorous nature, while in the\r\nNorth they took the form of _chansons de geste_, long poems\r\nrecounting the feats in the life and battles of some hero,\r\nsuch as Roland (whose song was chanted by the troops of William\r\nthe Conqueror), or Charles Martel.\r\n\r\nAnd so the foundations for many forms of modern music were\r\nlaid by the troubadours, for the _chanson_ or song was always\r\na narrative. If it were an evening song it was a _sera_ or\r\nserenade, or if it were a night song, _nocturne_; a dance,\r\na _ballada_; a round dance, a _rounde_ or _rondo_; a country\r\nlove song, a _pastorella_. Even the words descant and treble\r\ngo back to their time; for the _jongleurs_, singing their\r\nmasters' songs, would not all follow the same melody; one\r\nof them would seek to embellish it and sing something quite\r\ndifferent that still would fit well with the original melody,\r\njust as nowadays, in small amateur bands we often hear a\r\nflute player adding embellishing notes to his part. Soon,\r\nmore than one singer added to his part, and the new voice was\r\ncalled the triple, third, or treble voice. This extemporizing\r\non the part of the _jongleurs_ soon had to be regulated, and\r\nthe actual notes written down to avoid confusion. Thus this\r\nhabit of singing merged into _faux bourdon_, which has been\r\ndiscussed in a former chapter. Apart from these forms of song,\r\nthere were some called _sirventes_--that is \"songs of service,\"\r\nwhich were very partisan, and were accompanied by drums, bells,\r\nand pipes, and sometimes by trumpets. The more warlike of these\r\nsongs were sung at tournaments by the _jongleurs_ outside the\r\nlists, while their masters, the troubadours, were doing battle,\r\nof which custom a good description is to be found in Hagen's\r\nbook on the minnesingers.\r\n\r\nIn France the Provencal poetry lasted only until the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century, after the troubadours had received\r\na crushing blow at the time the Albigenses were extirpated in\r\nthe thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn one city alone (that of Beziers), between 30,000 and 40,000\r\npeople were killed for heresy against the Pope. The motto\r\nof the Pope's representatives was \"God will know His Own,\"\r\nand Catholics as well as Albigenses (as the sect was called)\r\nwere massacred indiscriminately. That this heresy against\r\nthe Pope was vastly aided by the troubadours, is hardly open\r\nto doubt. Such was their power that the rebellious, antipapal\r\n_sirventes_ of the troubadours (which were sung by their troops\r\nof _jongleurs_ in every market place) could be suppressed only\r\nafter the cities of Provence were almost entirely annihilated\r\nand the population destroyed by the massacre, burning alive,\r\nand the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nA review of the poems of Bertran de Born, Bernart de Ventadour,\r\nThibaut, or others is hardly in place here. Therefore we\r\nwill pass to Germany, where the spirit of the troubadours was\r\nassimilated in a peculiarly Germanic fashion by the minnesingers\r\nand the mastersingers.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the troubadours became minnesingers, or singers of\r\nlove songs, and as early as the middle of the twelfth century\r\nthe minnesingers were already a powerful factor in the life\r\nof the epoch, counting among their number many great nobles\r\nand kings. The German minnesingers differed from the French\r\ntroubadours in that they themselves accompanied their songs on\r\nthe viol, instead of employing _jongleurs_. Their poems, written\r\nin the Swabian dialect, then the court language of Germany,\r\nwere characterized by greater pathos and purity than those of\r\nthe troubadours, and their longer poems, corresponding to the\r\n_chansons de geste_ of the north of France, were also superior\r\nto the latter in point of dignity and strength. From the French\r\nwe have the \"Song of Roland\" (which William the Conqueror's\r\ntroops sang in their invasion of England); from the Germans the\r\n\"Nibelungen Song,\" besides Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\"\r\nand Gottfried von Strasburg's \"Tristan.\" In contradistinction\r\nto the poetry of the troubadours, that of the minnesingers\r\nwas characterized by an undercurrent of sadness which seems\r\nto be peculiar to the Germanic race. The songs are full of\r\nnature and the eternal strife between Winter and Summer and\r\ntheir prototypes Death and Life (recalling the ancient myths\r\nof Maneros, Bacchus, Astoreth, Bel, etc.).\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Konrad IV, the last Swabian emperor of the\r\nHouse of Hohenstaufen, minnesinging in Germany declined, and\r\nwas succeeded by the movement represented by the _meister_ or\r\nmastersingers. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\r\nwhen Germany was broken up into countless small duchies and\r\nkingdoms, many of the German nobles became mere robbers and took\r\npart in the innumerable little wars which kept the nation in\r\na state of ferment. Thus they had neither time nor inclination\r\nto occupy themselves with such pursuits as poetry or music. In\r\nthe meanwhile, however, the incessant warfare and brigandage\r\nthat prevailed in the country tended to drive the population\r\nto the cities for protection. The latter grew in size, and\r\nlittle by little the tradespeople began to take up the arts\r\nof poetry and music which had been discarded by the nobles.\r\n\r\nFollowing their custom in respect to their trades, they formed\r\nthe art companies into guilds, the rules for admittance to which\r\nwere very strict. The rank of each member was determined by\r\nhis skill in applying the rules of the \"Tabulatur,\" as it was\r\ncalled. There were five grades of membership: the lowest was\r\nthat of mere admittance to the guild; the next carried with\r\nit the title of scholar; the third the friend of the school;\r\nafter that came the singer, the poet; and last of all the\r\nmastersinger, to attain which distinction the aspirant must\r\nhave invented a new style of melody or rhyme. The details of\r\nthe contest we all know from Wagner's comedy; in a number of\r\ncases Wagner even made use of the sentences and words found\r\nin the rules of the mastersingers. Although the mastersingers\r\nretained their guild privileges in different parts of Germany\r\nalmost up to the middle of the present century, the movement\r\nwas strongest in Bavaria, with Nuremberg as its centre.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the mastersingers and the minnesingers were\r\ntwo very different classes of men. The mastersingers are\r\nmainly valuable for having given Wagner a pretext for his\r\nwonderful music. Hans Sachs was perhaps the only one of the\r\nmastersingers whose melodies show anything but the flattest\r\nmediocrity. The minnesingers and their immediate predecessors\r\nand successors, on the other hand, furnished thought for a great\r\npart of our modern art. To put it in a broad manner, it may be\r\nsaid that much of our modern poetry owes more than is generally\r\nconceded to the German mediaeval romance as represented in the\r\nworks of Wolfram von Eschenbach, Gottfried of Strasburg, and\r\nthe unknown compilers of the \"Nibelungenlied\" and \"Gutrune.\"\r\nMusic owes more to the troubadours, for, from what we know\r\nof the melodies of the minnesingers, they cannot compare in\r\nexpressiveness with those of their French _confreres_.\r\n\r\nIn closing this consideration of the minnesingers, I will quote\r\nsome of their verses and melodies, giving short accounts of\r\nthe authors.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the minnesingers were Walther von der\r\nVogelweide, Heinrich Frauenlob, Tannhaeuser, Nithart, Toggenburg,\r\netc. We first hear of Walther von der Vogelweide in 1200,\r\nas a poet attached to the court of Philip of Hohenstaufen,\r\nthe German Kaiser, and shortly after to that of his successors\r\nOtto and Friedrich. He accompanied Kaiser Friedrich to the\r\nCrusade of 1228, and saw him crowned in Jerusalem. He died\r\nin Wuerzburg, Bavaria. In accordance with his dying request,\r\nfood and drink for the birds were placed on his tomb every day;\r\nthe four holes carved for that purpose being still visible. The\r\npictures in Hagen's work on the mastersingers were collected in\r\nthe fifteenth century by Manasses of Zorich, and have served\r\nas the basis for all subsequent works on the subject. The\r\npicture of Von der Vogelweide (page 21) shows him sitting in\r\nan attitude of meditation, on a green hillock, beside him his\r\nsword and his coat of arms (a caged bird on one side and his\r\nhelmet on the other), and in his hand a roll of manuscript.\r\nOne of his shorter poems begins:\r\n\r\n    Neath the lindens\r\n    In the meadow\r\n    Seek I flowers sweet;\r\n    Clover fragrant,\r\n    Tender grasses,\r\n    Bend beneath my feet.\r\n\r\n    See, the gloaming,\r\n    Softly sinking,\r\n    Covers hill and dale.\r\n    Hush! my lover--\r\n    Tandaradei!\r\n    Sweet sings the nightingale.\r\n\r\nWe all are familiar with Tannhaeuser (plate 35), through Wagner's\r\nopera; therefore it is unnecessary to say more than that he was\r\na real person, a minnesinger, and that the singing tournament\r\nat the Wartburg (the castle of the Thueringen family) really took\r\nplace in 1206-07. This tournament, which Wagner introduces into\r\nhis \"Tannhaeuser,\" was a trial of knightly strength, poetry,\r\nand music, between the courts of Babenhausen and Thueringen,\r\nand was held in Erfurt. Among the knights who competed were\r\nKlingsor of Hungary, a descendant of the Klingsor who figures\r\nin the \"Parzival\" legend, Tannhaeuser, Walther von Eschenbach,\r\nWalther von der Vogelweide, and many others. Tannhaeuser was\r\na follower, or perhaps better, the successor of Walther von\r\nder Vogelweide, like him, a crusader, and lived in the first\r\nhalf of the thirteenth century. Toggenburg and Frauenlob were\r\nboth celebrated minnesingers, the former (plate 7) being the\r\nsubject of many strange legends. The simplicity and melodious\r\ncharm of his verses seem to contradict the savage brutality\r\nascribed to him in the stories of his life.\r\n\r\nFrauenlob (plate 44), as Heinrich von Meissen was\r\ncalled, represents the minnesingers at the height of their\r\ndevelopment. He died about 1320, and his works, as his nickname\r\nsuggests, were imbued with _das ewig weibliche_ in its best\r\nsense. He was called the Magister of the seven free arts, and\r\nwas given the position of Canon of the Cathedral of Mayence,\r\nwith the title of Doctor of Divinity. He also wrote a paraphrase\r\non the \"Song of Solomon,\" turning it into a rhapsodical eulogy\r\nof the Virgin Mary, carrying versification to what seemed then\r\nits utmost limits. The picture shows him playing and singing\r\nto some prince, the carpet on which he stands being lifted\r\nby the attendants. It makes plain the difference between the\r\nminnesingers and the troubadours. In this picture the singer\r\nis seen to be accompanying himself before the king, whereas in\r\nplate 28 we see two troubadours in the lists, their _jongleurs_\r\nplaying or singing the songs of their masters, while the latter\r\nengage each other in battle. In order to give one more example\r\nwe will take the pictures of Conrad, the son of Conrad IV,\r\nand the last of the Hohenstaufens (plate 11). He was born\r\nabout 1250, and was beheaded in the market place at Naples in\r\n1268. The story of Konradin, as he was called, is familiar;\r\nhow he lived with his mother at the castle of her brother,\r\nLudwig of Bavaria, how he was induced to join in a rebellion\r\nof the two Sicilies (to the crown of which he was heir) against\r\nFrance, his defeat and execution by the Duke of Anjou, himself\r\na well-known troubadour. The text accompanying his picture\r\nin Hagen's work describes him as having black eyes and blonde\r\nhair, and wearing a long green dress with a golden collar.\r\nHis gray hunting horse is covered with a crimson mantle, has a\r\ngolden saddle and bit, and scarlet reins. Konradin wears white\r\nhunting gloves and a three-cornered king's crown. Above the\r\npicture are the arms of the kingdom of Jerusalem (a golden\r\ncrown in silver ground), to which he was heir through his\r\ngrandmother, Iolanthe. One of his songs runs as follows, and\r\nit may be accepted as a fair specimen of the style of lyric\r\nwritten by the minnesingers:\r\n\r\n    The lovely flowers and verdure sweet\r\n    That gentle May doth slip\r\n    Have been imprisoned cruelly\r\n    In Winter's iron grip;\r\n    But May smiles o'er the green clad fields\r\n    That seemed anon so sad,\r\n    And all the world is glad.\r\n\r\n    No joy to me the Summer brings\r\n    With all its bright long days.\r\n    My thoughts are of a maiden fair\r\n    Who mocks my pleading gaze;\r\n    She passes me in haughty mood,\r\n    Denies me aught but scorn,\r\n    And makes my life forlorn.\r\n\r\n    Yet should I turn my love from her,\r\n    For aye my love were gone.\r\n    I'd gladly die could I forget\r\n    The love that haunts my song.\r\n    So, lonely, joyless, live I on,\r\n    For love my prayer denies,\r\n    And, childlike, mocks my sighs.\r\n\r\nThe music of these minnesingers existing in manuscript has been\r\nbut little heeded, and only lately has an attempt been made to\r\nclassify and translate it into modern notation. The result so\r\nfar attained has been unsatisfactory, for the rhythms are all\r\ngiven as spondaic. This seems a very improbable solution of\r\nthe mystery that must inevitably enshroud the musical notation\r\nof the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nNithart (plate 36), by whom a number of melodies or \"tones\"\r\nare given in Hagen's book (page 845), has been dubbed the\r\nsecond \"Till Eulenspiegel.\" He was a Bavarian, and lived about\r\n1230, at the court of Frederick of Austria. He was eminently\r\nthe poet and singer of the peasants, with whom, after the\r\nmanner of Eulenspiegel, he had many quarrels, one of which is\r\nevidently the subject of the picture. His music, or melodies,\r\nand the verses which went with them, form the most complete\r\nauthentic collection of mediaeval music known. In considering\r\nthe _minnelieder_ of the Germans it is very interesting to\r\ncompare them with the songs of the troubadours, and to note\r\nhow in the latter the Arab influence has increased the number\r\nof curved lines, or arabesques, whereas the German songs may\r\nbe likened to straight lines, a characteristic which we know\r\nis a peculiarity of their folk song.\r\n\r\n  PASTORELLA BY THIBAUT II, KING OF NAVARRE, 1254.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 41]\r\n    [W: L'Autrier par la matinee Entre sen bos et un Vergier\r\n        Une pastore ai trounee chantant pour soi en voisier.]\r\n\r\n  Example from NITHART\r\n\r\n    [Figure 42]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the straight lines of the melodies of\r\nthe minnesingers and in comparing them with the tinge of\r\norientalism to be found in those of the troubadours, it was\r\nsaid that music owes more to the latter than to the former,\r\nand this is true. If we admit that the straight line of Grecian\r\narchitecture is perfect, so must we also admit that mankind is\r\nimperfect. We are living beings, and as such are swayed to a\r\ngreat extent by our emotions. To the straight line of purity\r\nin art the tinge of orientalism, the curved line of emotion,\r\nbrings the flush of life, and the result is something which we\r\ncan _feel_ as well as worship from afar. Music is a language,\r\nand to mankind it serves as a medium for saying something which\r\ncannot be put into mere words. Therefore, it must contain the\r\nhuman element of mere sensuousness in order to be intelligible.\r\nThis is why the music of the troubadours, although not so pure\r\nin style as that of the minnesingers, has been of the greatest\r\nvalue in the development of our art. This orientalism, however,\r\nmust not mask the straight line; it must be the means of lending\r\nmore force, tenderness, or what not, to the figure. It must\r\nbe what the poem is to the picture, the perfume to the flower;\r\nit must help to illustrate the thing itself. The moment we find\r\nthis orientalism (and I am using the word in its broadest sense)\r\ncovering, and thus distorting the straight line of pure music,\r\nthen we have national music so-called, a music which derives\r\nits name and fame from the clothes it wears and not from that\r\nstrange language of the soul, the \"why\" of which no man has\r\never discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nEARLY INSTRUMENTAL FORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to some newspaper reports which he knew to be\r\nwithout foundation, Bismarck once said, \"Newspapers are simply\r\na union of printer's ink and paper.\" Omitting the implied slur\r\nwe might say the same of printed music and printed criticism;\r\ntherefore, in considering printed music we must, first of all,\r\nremember that it is the letter of the law which kills. We must\r\nlook deeper, and be able to translate sounds back into the\r\nemotions which caused them. There is no right or wrong way\r\nto give utterance to music. There is but _one_ way, namely,\r\nthrough the living, vital expression of the content of the\r\nmusic; all else is not music but mere pleasure for the ear,\r\na thing of the senses. For the time being we must see through\r\nthe composer's eyes and hear through his ears. In other words,\r\nwe must think in his language. The process of creating music is\r\noften, to a great extent, beyond the control of the composer,\r\njust as is the case with the novelist and his characters. The\r\nlanguage through which musical thought is expressed, however, is\r\na different thing, and it is this process of developing musical\r\nspeech until it has become capable of saying for us that which,\r\nin our spoken language, must ever remain unsaid, that I shall\r\ntry to make clear in our consideration of form in music.\r\n\r\nUntil the very end of the fifteenth century, music, so far\r\nas we know, had no language of its own, that is to say,\r\nit was not recognized as a medium for expressing thought or\r\nemotion. Josquin des Pres (born at Conde in the north of France\r\nin 1450, died 1521) was the first to attempt the expression\r\nof thought in sound. Luther, in rebelling against Rome, also\r\noverturned the music of the church in Germany. He incorporated\r\nmany folk songs into the music of the Protestant church and\r\ndiscarded the old Gregorian chant (which was vague in rhythm,\r\nor, rather, wholly without rhythm), calling it asinine braying.\r\n\r\nWhile Luther was paving the way for Bach by encouraging\r\nchurch music to be something more than merely the singing\r\nof certain melodies according to prescribed rules, in Italy\r\n(at the time of his death in 1546) the Council of Trent was\r\nalready trying to decide upon a style of music proper for the\r\nchurch. The matter was definitely settled in 1562 or 1563 by\r\nthe adoption of Palestrina's style.[13] Thus, while in Germany\r\necclesiastical music was being broadened and an opening offered\r\nfor the development of the dramatic and emotional side of music,\r\nin Italy, on the contrary, the emotional style of music was\r\nbeing neglected and an absolutely serene style of what may be\r\ncalled \"impersonal\" music encouraged. Italy, however, soon had\r\nopera on which to fall back, and thus music in both countries\r\ndeveloped rapidly, although on different lines.\r\n\r\nIn England, the budding school of English art, as exemplified\r\nby Purcell, was soon overwhelmed by the influence of Haendel\r\nand the all-pervading school of Italian opera, which he brought\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nIn France, up to 1655, when Cardinal Mazarin sent to Italy for\r\nan opera troupe with the purpose of entertaining Anne of Austria\r\n(the widow of Louis XIII), there was practically no recognized\r\nmusic except that imported from other countries. Under Louis\r\nXI (d. 1483) Ockeghem, the Netherland contrapuntist, was the\r\nchief musician of the land.\r\n\r\nThe French pantomimes or masques, as they were sometimes called,\r\ncan hardly be said to have represented a valuable gain to art,\r\nalthough their prevalence in France points directly to their\r\nhaving been the direct descendants of the old pantomime on\r\none hand, and on the other, the direct ancestor of the French\r\nopera. For we read that already in 1581 (twenty years before\r\nCaccini's \"Euridice\" at Florence), a ballet entitled \"Circe\" was\r\ngiven on the occasion of the marriage of Margaret of Lorraine,\r\nthe stepsister of Henry III. The music to it was written by\r\nBeaulieu and Salmon, two court musicians. There were ten bands\r\nof music in the cupola of the ballroom where the ballet was\r\ngiven. These bands included hautbois, cornets, trombones, violas\r\nde gamba, flutes, harps, lutes, flageolets. Besides all this,\r\nten violin players in costume entered the scene in the first\r\nact, five from each side. Then a troupe of Tritons came swimming\r\nin, playing lutes, harps, flutes, one even having a kind of\r\n'cello. When Jupiter makes his appearance, he is accompanied by\r\nforty musicians. The festivities on this occasion are said to\r\nhave cost over five million francs. Musically, the ballet was no\r\nadvance towards expressiveness in art. An air which accompanied\r\n\"Circe's\" entrance, may be cited as being the original of the\r\nwell-known \"Amaryllis,\" which is generally called _Air Louis\r\nXV_. Baltazarini calls it _un son fort gai, nomme la clochette_.\r\n\r\nMusic remained inert in France until 1650, when the Italians\r\ngained an ascendancy, which they retained until 1732,\r\nwhen Rameau's first opera \"Hyppolyte et Aricie\" was given in\r\nParis. Rameau had already commenced his career by gaining great\r\nsuccess as a harpsichord player and instrumental composer,\r\nmostly for the harpsichord. By his time, however, music,\r\nthat is to say, secular music, was already becoming a new art,\r\nand the French merely improved upon what already existed.\r\n\r\nNow this new art was first particularly evident in the dances of\r\nthese different peoples. These dances gave the music _form_, and\r\nheld it down to certain prescribed rhythms and duration. Little\r\nby little the emotions, the natural expression of which is\r\nmusic, could no longer be restricted to these dance forms\r\nand rhythms; and gradually the latter were modified by each\r\ndaring innovator in turn. This \"daring\" of human beings, in\r\nbreaking through the trammels of the dance in order to express\r\nwhat lay within their souls in the language that properly\r\nbelonged to it, would seem almost ludicrous to us, were we\r\nnot even to-day trying to get up courage to do the same thing.\r\nThe modifications of dance forms led up to our sonata, symphony,\r\nand symphonic poem, as I hope to show. Opera was a thing apart,\r\nand, being untrammelled either by dance rhythms or church laws,\r\ndeveloped gradually and normally. It cannot, however, be said to\r\nhave developed side by side with purely instrumental music, for\r\nthe latter is only just beginning to emancipate itself from its\r\ndance clothes and to come forth as a language for the expression\r\nof all that is divine in man. First we will consider the forms\r\nand rhythms of these dances, then the awakening of the idea of\r\ndesign in music, and its effect in modifying these forms and\r\nlaying the foundation for the sonata of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe following shows the structure of the different dance forms\r\nup to about 1750.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD DANCE FORMS (1650-1750).\r\n\r\n  [   :Motive-|-Motive--|-Motive-----|--|-Motive---|--|-Motive----|---]\r\n  [2/4: 4 8 8 | 8. 16 4 | 8 8 8 8 | 4 4 | 4 8 8 | 4 4 | 8. 16 8 8 | 2 ]\r\n  [   :------Phrase-----|----Phrase-----|---Phrase----|----Phrase-----]\r\n  [A phrase may be three or four measures, and sections may be unequal]\r\n  [   :-------------Section-------------|-----------Section-----------]\r\n  [   :------------------------------Period---------------------------]\r\n\r\n  This period might be repeated or extended to sixteen measures\r\n  and still remain a period.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. |--I P.-|--II P.-|       (II is generally longer than I)\r\n  2. |---I---|---II---|--I--|\r\n  3. |---I---|---II---|-III-| (generally III resembles I)\r\n  4. |---I---|---II---|-III-|--I--|--II-| or |--I--|--II--|-III-|--I--|\r\n  5. |---I---|---II---|-III-|--IV-|\r\n  6. |---I---|---II---|-III-|--IV-|--I--|--II-|\r\n  7. |---I---|---II---|--I--|-III-|--IV-|-III-|--I--|--II--|--I--|\r\n\r\nIn all these forms each period may be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nOften the first, third, and fourth periods are repeated,\r\nleaving the second period as it is. This happens especially\r\nwhen the second period is longer than the first. In Nos. 2,\r\n4, 6, 7, a few bars are often added at _Fine_ as a coda.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF OLD DANCES\r\n\r\n1. SARABANDE.--[3/2] [3/4] lento. Rhythm [3/2: 2 ^2. 4 | 2 2].\r\nForm 1, sometimes Form 2. This is of Spanish origin (_Saracen_\r\ndance), and is generally accompanied by variations called\r\n_partita_ or doubles.\r\n\r\n2. MUSETTE (_cornemusa_ or bagpipe).--[3/4] [2/4] allegretto.\r\nForm 1. Always written over or under a pedal note, which is\r\ngenerally sustained to the end. It generally forms the second\r\npart (not period) to the gavotte.\r\n\r\n3. GAVOTTE.--[4/4] allegro moderato.\r\nRhythm [4/4: 4 4 | 4 8 8 4 4] or [4 8 8 | 4 4 4 4].\r\nAlways commences on the third beat. Form 3 or 5.\r\nWhen accompanied by a musette, the gavotte is always repeated.\r\n\r\n4. BOURREE.--[C/2] allegro. Rhythm [C/2: 8 8 | 4 4 4 8 8].\r\nForm 3 or 5. Generally faster than the gavotte, and commences\r\non the fourth beat.\r\n\r\n5. RIGAUDON.--Similar to the bourree, but slower.\r\n\r\n6. LOURE.--Similar to the bourree, but slower. (In French\r\nthe verb _lourer_ means \"to hold,\" which may have been a\r\ncharacteristic of the _loure_ bass).\r\n\r\n7. TAMBOURIN.--[C/2] allegro. In form and rhythm like the\r\ngavotte, but faster. Usually founded on a rhythmic pedal\r\nnote imitating a tambourine.\r\n\r\n8. CORRENTE, COURANTE.--[3/4] allegretto.\r\nRhythm [3/4: 8 8 8 | 8 8 8 8 8 8] or [3/4: 8 | 8 8 8 8 8 8]\r\n(does not usually commence on the beat). Form 1, sometimes\r\nForm 2. The rhythm is usually uniform, a kind of perpetual\r\nmotion, though not in one voice.\r\n\r\n9. MINUET.--[3/4] generally a little slower than moderato,\r\nalthough in later minuets the tempo became allegretto.\r\nRhythm, generally, [3/4: >(4 | 4) 4 4 | 4 8 8 8 8] etc.\r\nOld minuets often began on the first beat. Form 4; the third\r\nand fourth periods being generally in a different mode from\r\nthe first and second periods, and called Trio or Minuet 2.\r\nMinuets exist also without the Trio, and are in Form 1 or 2.\r\n\r\n10. CHACONNE.--[3/4] moderato. Form undecided; has sometimes\r\neven only one period, sometimes three or two. It is generally\r\naccompanied by doubles or variations, and is invariably\r\nwritten on a ground bass or _basso ostinato_. The rhythm is\r\noften syncopated.\r\n\r\nPASSACAILLE, [3/4], resembles a chaconne but is more stately.\r\n\r\n11. WALTZ (old German).--[3/4] andante moderato. Generally\r\nForm 6. Rhythm [3/4: 4. 8 8. 16 | 8 8 4 8 8] approximately.\r\n\r\n12. MARCH.--[4/4] allegro moderato.\r\nRhythm [4/4: 8. 16 | 4 . 16 4 4 | 2. 3(8 8 8)] etc., or\r\n[4 | 4 8. 16 4 4] etc. Form 6. Generally all the periods\r\nare repeated and consist of eight measures each; third and\r\nfourth periods change the key and rhythm.\r\n\r\n13. ALLEMANDE.--[4/4] moderato. Rhythm generally uniform\r\nsixteenth notes. Form 1.\r\n\r\n14. PASSEPIED.--Quick minuet.\r\n\r\n15. PAVANE, PADVANA, or PAVO (peacock).--[4/4] andante\r\nmoderato. Rhythm [4/4: 4 8. 16 4. 8 | 8 8 8 8 2]. Form 2 or 6.\r\nSometimes [2/4]; third and fourth periods in different keys.\r\n\r\n16. GIGUE.--[2/4] [6/8] [3/4] [3/8] [9/8] [12/8] presto.\r\nRhythm generally uniform eighth notes. Forms 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n17. POLONAISE.--[3/4]. Rhythm [3/4: 8 16 16 8 16 16 4] or\r\n[16 16 8 16 16 8 4] allegro. Form 1, generally with short coda.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN FORMS (1800).\r\n\r\n1. MAZURKA.--[3/4] allegretto. Form 6.\r\nRhythm [3/4: 4 | 8. 16 4 4].\r\n\r\n2. POLONAISE (also POLACCA).--[3/4] allegro maestoso.\r\nRhythm [3/4: 8. 16 8. 16 16 16 16 16] or [8 4 16 16 8 8].\r\nThe bass is generally [8 16 16 8 8 8 8]. Form 7.\r\n\r\n3. BOLERO (CACHUCHA) (Spanish).--Like the polonaise but\r\nlivelier, and generally containing counter-rhythms in triplets.\r\n\r\n4. HABANERA.--[2/4].\r\nRhythm [2/4: 8 8 16 8 16 | 8 8 16 8 16 | 8 8 3(8 8 8) | 8 8 4].\r\nThe characteristic element is the mixture of triplets and eighth\r\nnotes. Time, andante. Form undecided, generally No. 1. Very often\r\nrepeated with slight changes.\r\n\r\n5. CZARDAS (Hungarian).--First part [C/2] (_lassan_, _lento_);\r\nsecond part [2/4] (_friska_, _presto_ and _prestissimo_).\r\nFor form and rhythm see Liszt's rhapsodies, Nos. 2, 4, and 6.\r\n\r\n6. TARANTELLA.--Rhythm [6/8: 8 8 8 8 8 8 | 8 8 8 8 8 8] or\r\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 | 4 8 4 8]. Time, molto allegro to prestissimo.\r\nForms 4 and 6, sometimes 7. In the Trio the movement is often\r\nquieter although not necessarily slower. It almost invariably\r\nhas a Coda. The Finale is usually prestissimo.\r\n\r\n7. SALTARELLO.--Similar to the tarantella, with the exception\r\nof having more jumps (_salti_).\r\n\r\n8. POLKA (about 1840).--[2/4] allegretto.\r\nRhythm [2/4: 8 8 4 | 8 16 16 4]. Form 6. Accent is on the\r\nsecond beat. Cuban dances (sometimes called habaneros) are\r\noften in polka form and rhythm, with the one exception of\r\nthe triplets peculiar to almost all Spanish music\r\n[2/4: 8 8 >4 | 8 8 >4 | 16 8 16 >8 8 | 16 8 16 3(16 16 16) 8]\r\n\r\n9. WALTZ.--[3/4]. Rhythm (bass) [3/4: >4 4 4 | >4 4 4].\r\nFaster than the old waltz. Form 2 with a coda. Modern waltzes are\r\noften written in sets, or many different waltzes joined together\r\nby short modulations or codas, preceded by an introduction,\r\ngenerally in one period, _lento_, and ending with a brilliant\r\ncoda containing reminiscences of the principal themes.\r\n\r\n10. GALOP.--[2/4]. Rhythm [2/4: 16 16 16 16 8 8 | 8 8 8 8] or\r\n[16 16 8 8 8 | 16 16 8 16 16 8]. Form 6. Time, presto.\r\n\r\n11. MARCH.--Same as the old march, but modified in character\r\nand movement according to its title--funeral march, military\r\nmarch, cortege, festival march, etc. In funeral marches,\r\nthe third and fourth periods are generally in major.\r\n\r\nThe modernizing of dance forms has been undertaken by\r\nalmost every writer from Scarlatti (d. 1757) down to our\r\nday. Scarlatti joined sections together with isolated measures,\r\nrepeated sections and phrases before completing the period,\r\nand added short codas to periods indiscriminately. Since his\r\ntime, everyone has added to or curtailed the accepted forms\r\nby putting two forms together; hence the fantaisie-mazurka,\r\netc. Wagner represents the culminating point of the modern\r\ntendency to disregard forms which were interpreted differently\r\nby every composer, and which had their origin in dances.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to emancipate music from the dance commenced very\r\nearly; in fact, most of the earliest secular music we know\r\nalready shows the tendency towards programme music, for,\r\nfrom an emotional standpoint, secular music began at the\r\nvery bottom of the ladder. It was made to express _things_\r\nat first, just as in learning any new language we naturally\r\nfirst acquire a vocabulary of nouns to express things we see,\r\nsuch as table, chair, etc., in the same way that in _written_\r\nlanguage the symbols first take the shape of animals or other\r\nthings they are meant to represent. This same characteristic\r\nnaturally showed itself in music before the words for _emotion_\r\ncame, the common, everyday nouns were sought for in this new\r\nlanguage. The madrigals of Weelkes and their word painting show\r\nthis, and the same occur in instrumental music, as in Byrd's\r\n\"Carman's Whistle,\" one of the earliest English instrumental\r\nworks contemporaneous to the madrigals of Morley and others.\r\nIn France, many of the earliest clavichord pieces were of\r\nthe programme type, and even in Germany, where instrumental\r\nmusic ran practically in the same groove with church music,\r\nthe same tendency showed itself.\r\n\r\nI have given the forms of most of the old dances, and also the\r\nelements of melodic structure (motive, phrase, etc.). I must,\r\nhowever, add the caution that this material is to be accepted\r\nin a general way, and as representing the rhythms and forms\r\nmost frequently used. A French courante differed from the\r\nItalian, and certain dances were taken at different _tempi_ in\r\ndifferent countries. Poor, or at least careless construction,\r\nis often the cause of much confusion. Scarlatti, for instance,\r\nis especially loose in melodic structure.\r\n\r\nIt was only with Beethoven that the art of musical design showed\r\nanything like complete comprehension by the composer. Until\r\nthen, with occasional almost haphazard successes, the art\r\nof pushing a thought to its logical conclusion was seemingly\r\nunknown. An emotional passage now and then would often betray\r\ndeep feeling, but the thought would almost invariably be lost in\r\nthe telling, for the simple reason that the musical sentences\r\nwere put together almost at random, mere stress of momentary\r\nemotion being seemingly the only guiding influence. Bach stands\r\nalone; his sense of design was inherent, but, owing to the\r\ncontrapuntal tendency of his time, his feeling for _melodic_\r\ndesign is often overshadowed, and even rendered impossible\r\nby the complex web of his music. With a number of melodies\r\nsounding together, their individual emotional development\r\nbecomes necessarily difficult to emphasize.\r\n\r\nBach's art has something akin to that of Palestrina. They both\r\nstand alone in the history of the world, but the latter belongs\r\nto the Middle Ages. He is the direct descendant of Ambrose,\r\nGregory, Notker, Tutilo, etc., the crowning monument of the\r\nRoman Church in music, and represents what may be termed\r\nunemotional music. His art was untouched by the strange,\r\nsuggestive colours of modern harmony; it was pure, unemotional,\r\nand serene. One instinctively thinks of Bach, on the other\r\nhand, as a kind of musical reflection of Protestantism. His\r\nwas not a secluded art which lifted its head high above the\r\nmultitude; it was rather the palpable outpouring of a great\r\nheart. Bach also represents all the pent-up feeling which\r\nuntil then had longed in vain for utterance, and had there\r\nbeen any canvas for him to paint on (to use a poor simile),\r\nthe result would have been still more marvellous. As it was,\r\nthe material at his disposal was a poor set of dance forms,\r\nwith the one exception of the fugue, the involved utterance\r\nof which precluded spontaneity and confined emotional design\r\nto very restricted limits. It is exactly as if Wagner had\r\nbeen obliged to put his thoughts in quadrille form with the\r\npossible alternative of some mathematical device of musical\r\ndouble bookkeeping. As it is, Bach's innovations were very\r\nconsiderable. In the first place, owing to the lack of the\r\nsystem of equal temperament, composers had been limited to\r\nthe use of only two or three sharps and flats; in all the\r\nharpsichord music of the pre-Bach period we rarely find\r\ncompositions in sharp keys beyond G, or flat keys beyond\r\nA[flat]. To be sure, Rameau, in France, began at the same time\r\nto see the necessity for equal temperament, but it was Bach\r\nwho, by his forty-eight \"Preludes and Fugues,\" written in all\r\nthe keys, first settled the matter definitely.\r\n\r\nIn the fugue form itself, he made many innovations consisting\r\nmainly of the casting aside of formalism. With Bach a fugue\r\nconsists of what is called the \"exposition,\" that is to say,\r\nthe enunciation of the theme (subject), its answer by another\r\nvoice or part, recurrence of the subject in another part which,\r\nin turn, is again answered, and so on according to the number\r\nof voices or parts. After the exposition the fugue consists\r\nof a kind of free contrapuntal fantasy on the subject and its\r\nanswer. By throwing aside the restraint of form Bach often\r\ngave his fugues an emotional significance in spite of the\r\ncomplexity of the material he worked with.\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] Pier Luigi, born in Palestrina, near Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE MERGING OF THE SUITE INTO THE SONATA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter it was stated that the various dances,\r\nsuch as the minuet, sarabande, allemande, etc., led up to\r\nour modern sonata form, or, perhaps, to put it more clearly,\r\nthey led up to what we call sonata form. As a matter of fact,\r\nalready in the seventeenth century, we find the word _sonata_\r\napplied to musical compositions; generally to pieces for the\r\nviolin, but rarely for the harpsichord. The word sonata\r\nwas derived originally from the Italian word _suonare_,\r\n\"to sound,\" and the term was used to distinguish instrumental\r\nfrom vocal music. The latter was sung (_cantata_), the former\r\nwas sounded (_suonata_) by instruments. Thus many pieces were\r\ncalled _suonatas_; the distinguishing point being that they were\r\n_played_ and not sung. Organ sonatas existed as far back as 1600\r\nand even earlier, but the earliest application of the word seems\r\nto have been made in connection with pieces for the violin.\r\n\r\nDances were often grouped together, especially when they had\r\nsome slight intrinsic musical value. Probably the term _sonata_\r\nfirst designated a composition in one of these dance forms\r\nnot intended for dancing. Gradually groups of dances were\r\ncalled _suites_; then, little by little, the dance titles of\r\nthe separate numbers were dropped, and the _suite_ was called\r\n_sonata_. These different numbers, however, retained their\r\ndance characteristics, as we shall see later. The arrangement\r\nof the pieces composing the _suites_ differed in various\r\ncountries. There were French, Italian, German, and English\r\nsuites, generally, however, retaining the same grouping of\r\nthe different movements. The first movement consisted of an\r\n_allemande_; then came a _courante_; then a _minuet_; then\r\na _sarabande_; and last of all a _gigue_; all in the same\r\nkey. Sometimes the _minuet_ and _sarabande_ changed places,\r\njust as in modern times do the _andante_ and _scherzo_.\r\n\r\nAlready in 1685, when Corelli's sonatas for strings appeared,\r\nthe custom of decreasing the number of movements to three began\r\nto obtain, and a century later this custom was universal. The\r\n_allemande_, _overture_, or _preludio_ formed the first\r\nmovement; the second consisted of the _sarabande_, the ancestor\r\nof our _adagio_; and the last part was generally a _gigue_. Even\r\nwhen the dance titles were no more used (the music having long\r\noutgrown its original purpose), the distinctive characteristics\r\nof these different movements were retained; the _sarabande_\r\nrhythm was still adhered to for the _adagio_ (even by Haydn)\r\nand the triple time and rhythm of the _gigue_ were given to\r\nthe last part. In addition to this, these three movements\r\nwere often kept in one key. In his first sonatas Beethoven\r\nadded a movement, generally a _minuet_, to this scheme; but\r\nreturned to the three-movement structure later. His Op. 111\r\nhas only two movements, in a way returning to a still earlier\r\ngeneral form of the sonata. Now, as has already been said,\r\nsome of the earliest examples of instrumental music were\r\nmainly descriptive in character, that is to say, consisting\r\nof imitations of _things_, thus marking the most elementary\r\nstage of programme music. Little by little composers became\r\nmore ambitious and began to attempt to give expression to\r\nthe emotions by means of music; and at last, with Beethoven,\r\n\"programme music\" may be said, in one sense, to have reached\r\nits climax. For although it is not generally realized, he\r\nwrote every one of his sonatas with definite subjects, and,\r\nat one time, was on the point of publishing mottoes to them,\r\nin order to give the public a hint of what was in his mind\r\nwhen he wrote them.\r\n\r\nAnalysis may be considered as the reducing of a musical\r\ncomposition to its various elements--harmony, rhythm,\r\nmelody--and power of expression. Just as melody may be analyzed\r\ndown to the motives and phrases of which it consists, so may\r\nthe expressiveness of music be analyzed; and this latter study\r\nis most valuable, for it brings us to a closer understanding\r\nof the power of music as a language.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness we will group music as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Dance forms.\r\n    2. Programme music. (Things. Feelings.)\r\n    3. The gathering together of dances in suites.\r\n    4. The beginnings of design.\r\n    5. The merging of the suite into the sonata.\r\n\r\nThe dance tunes I need hardly quote; they consist of a mere play\r\nof sound to keep the dancers in step, for which purpose any more\r\nor less agreeable rhythmical succession of sounds will serve.\r\n\r\nIf we take the next step in advance of instrumental music\r\nwe come to the giving of meanings to these dances, and, as I\r\nhave explained, these meanings will at first have reference\r\nto things; for instance, Couperin imitates an alarm clock;\r\nRameau tries to make the music sound as if three hands were\r\nplaying instead of two (_Les trois mains_); he imitates sighing\r\n(_Les soupirs_); the scolding voice; he even tries to express a\r\nmood musically (_L'indifferente_). In Germany, these attempts\r\nto make instrumental music expressive of something beyond\r\nrhythmic time-keeping continued, and we find Carl Philip\r\nEmanuel Bach attempting to express light-hearted amiability (_La\r\ncomplaisance_) and even languor (_Les tendres langueurs_). The\r\nsuite, while it combined several dances in one general form,\r\nshows only a trace of _design_. There was more design in one\r\nof the small programme pieces already quoted than in most of\r\nthe suites of this period (see, for example, Loeilly's \"Suite\").\r\n\r\nBach possessed instinctively the feeling for musical speech\r\nwhich seemed denied to his contemporaries whenever they had no\r\nactual story to guide their expression; and even in his dance\r\nmusic we find coherent musical sentences as, for instance,\r\nin the _Courante_ in A.\r\n\r\nIn art our opinions must, in all cases, rest directly on the\r\nthing under consideration and not on what is written about\r\nit. In my beliefs I am no respecter of the written word,\r\nthat is to say, the mere fact that a statement is made by\r\na well-known man, is printed in a well-known work, or is\r\nendorsed by many prominent names, means nothing to me if the\r\nthing itself is available for examination. Without a thorough\r\nknowledge of music, including its history and development,\r\nand, above all, musical \"sympathy,\" individual criticism is,\r\nof course, valueless; at the same time the acquirement of this\r\nknowledge and sympathy is not difficult, and I hope that we may\r\nyet have a public in America that shall be capable of forming\r\nits own ideas, and not be influenced by tradition, criticism,\r\nor fashion.\r\n\r\nWe need to open our eyes and see for ourselves instead\r\nof trusting the direction of our steps to the guidance of\r\nothers. Even an opinion based on ignorance, frankly given,\r\nis of more value to art than a platitude gathered from some\r\noutside source. If it is not a platitude but the echo of some\r\nfine thought, it only makes it worse, for it is not sincere,\r\nunless of course it is quoted understandingly. We need\r\nfreshness and sincerity in forming our judgments in art, for\r\nit is upon these that art lives. All over the world we find\r\naudiences listening suavely to long concerts, and yet we do\r\nnot see one person with the frankness of the little boy in\r\nAndersen's story of the \"New Clothes of the Emperor.\" It is\r\nthe same with the other arts. I have never heard anyone say\r\nthat part of the foreground of Millet's \"Angelus\" is \"muddy\"\r\nor that the Fornarina's mysterious smile is anything but\r\n\"hauntingly beautiful.\" People do not dare admire the London\r\nLaw Courts; all things must be measured by the straight lines\r\nof Grecian architecture. Frankness! Let us have frankness,\r\nand if we have no feelings on a subject, let us remain silent\r\nrather than echo that drone in the hive of modern thought,\r\nthe \"_authority_ in art.\"\r\n\r\nEvery person with even the very smallest love and sympathy for\r\nart possesses ideas which are valuable to that art. From the\r\ntiniest seeds sometimes the greatest trees are grown. Why,\r\ntherefore, allow these tender germs of individualism to\r\nbe smothered by that flourishing, arrogant bay tree of\r\ntradition--fashion, authority, convention, etc.\r\n\r\nMy reason for insisting on the importance of all lovers of\r\nart being able to form their own opinions is obvious, when we\r\nconsider that our musical public is obliged to take everything\r\non trust. For instance, if we read on one page of some history\r\n(every history of music has such a page) that Mozart's sonatas\r\nare sublime, that they do not contain one note of mere filigree\r\nwork, and that they far transcend anything written for the\r\nharpsichord or clavichord by Haydn or his contemporaries, we\r\necho the saying, and, if necessary, quote the \"authorities.\" Now\r\nif one had occasion to read over some of the clavichord music\r\nof the period, possibly it might seem strange that Mozart's\r\nsonatas did not impress with their magnificence. One might\r\neven harbour a lurking doubt as to the value of the many\r\nseemingly bare runs and unmeaning passages. Then one would\r\nprobably turn back to the authorities for an explanation and\r\nfind perhaps the following: \"The inexpressible charm of Mozart's\r\nmusic leads us to forget the marvellous learning bestowed upon\r\nits construction. Later composers have sought to conceal the\r\nconstructional points of the sonata which Mozart never cared to\r\ndisguise, so that incautious students have sometimes failed to\r\ndiscern in them the veritable 'pillars of the house,' and have\r\naccused Mozart of poverty of style because he left them boldly\r\nexposed to view, as a great architect delights to expose the\r\npiers upon which the tower of his cathedral depends for its\r\nsupport.\" (Rockstro, \"History of Music,\" p. 269.) Now this\r\nis all very fine, but it is nonsense, for Mozart's sonatas\r\nare anything but cathedrals. It is time to cast aside this\r\nshibboleth of printer's ink and paper and look the thing itself\r\nstraight in the face. It is a fact that Mozart's sonatas are\r\ncompositions entirely unworthy of the author of the \"Magic\r\nFlute,\" or of any composer with pretensions to anything beyond\r\nmediocrity. They are written in a style of flashy harpsichord\r\nvirtuosity such as Liszt never descended to, even in those of\r\nhis works at which so many persons are accustomed to sneer.\r\n\r\nSuch a statement as I have just made may be cried down as\r\nrank heresy, first by the book readers and then by the general\r\npublic; but I doubt if anyone among that public would or could\r\nactually turn to the music itself and analyze it intelligently,\r\nfrom both an aesthetic and technical standpoint, in order to\r\nverify or disprove the assertion.\r\n\r\nOnce a statement is made it seems to be exceedingly difficult\r\nto keep it from obtaining the universal acceptance which it\r\ngains by unthinking reiteration in other works. One of the\r\nstrangest cases of this repetition of a careless statement may\r\nbe found in the majority of histories of music, where we are\r\ntold that musical expression (that is to say, the increasing\r\nand diminishing of a tone, crescendo and diminuendo) was\r\nfirst _discovered_ at Mannheim, in Germany, about 1760. This\r\nstatement may be found in the works of Burney, Schubart,\r\nReichardt, Sittard, Wasielewski, and even in Jahn's celebrated\r\n\"Life of Mozart.\" The story is that Jommelli, an Italian,\r\nfirst \"invented\" the crescendo and diminuendo, and that when\r\nthey were first used, the people in the audience gradually\r\nrose from their seats at the crescendo, and as the music\r\n\"diminuendoed\" they sat down again. The story is absurd,\r\nfor the simple reason that even in 1705, Sperling, in his\r\n\"Principae Musicae,\" describes crescendos from _ppp_ to _fff_,\r\nand we read in Plutarch of the same thing.\r\n\r\nShedlock, in his work \"The Pianoforte Sonata,\" quotes as the\r\nfirst sonatas for the clavier those of Kuhnau, and cites\r\nespecially the six _Bible_ sonatas. Now Kuhnau, although\r\nhe was Bach's predecessor at St. Thomas' Church in Leipzig,\r\nwas certainly a composer of the very lowest rank. The _Bible_\r\nsonatas, which Shedlock paints to us in such glowing colours,\r\nare the merest trash, and not to be compared with the works of\r\nhis contemporaries. I do not think that they have any place\r\nwhatsoever in the history or development either of music or\r\nof that form called the sonata.\r\n\r\nThe development of the suite from dance forms has already\r\nbeen shown, and we will now trace the development of the\r\nsonata from the suite in Italy, Germany, and France. As an\r\nexample of this development in Italy, a so-called sonata by\r\nG.B. Pescetti will serve (the sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti\r\nwere not originally so named, and the sonatas before that were\r\nsimply short pieces, so designated to distinguish them from\r\ndance music). This sonata was published about 1730, and was one\r\nof nine. The first movement is practically of the _allemande_\r\ntype, and its first period ends in the dominant key. There\r\nis but the slightest trace of a second theme in the first\r\npart; yet the improvement in contrapuntal design over the\r\nsuites is evident. The second movement is in the same key,\r\nand retains the characteristic rhythm of the _sarabande_;\r\nat the end, the improvement, so far as design is concerned,\r\nis very noticeable. The last movement, still in the same key,\r\nis a _gigue_, thus keeping well in the shadow of the suite.\r\n\r\nA sonata by the German Rolle (1718-1785) is valuable in that\r\nit shows a very decided second theme in the first period,\r\nthus tending toward the development of the original simple\r\ndance form into the more complex sonata form. The _adagio_,\r\nhowever, still has the _sarabande_ characteristics, and\r\nforeshadows many things. It contains many _words_ that later\r\nwere shaped into great poems by others. \"The Erlking\" of\r\nSchubert is especially hinted at, just as the first movement\r\nwas prophetic of Beethoven. In the last movement we have the\r\n_gigue_ rhythm again.\r\n\r\nIn France, music had become merely a court appendage, as was\r\nthe case with the other arts, and had long served as a means\r\nfor showing the divine grace with which Louis XIV or XV could\r\nturn out his toes in the minuet. In addition to this, the\r\narranging of a scientific system of harmonization by Rameau\r\n(1683-1764) (which, by the way, is the basis of most of the\r\ntreatises of harmony of the present century), caused the few\r\nFrench composers who could make headway against the prevailing\r\nItalian opera after Lully to turn their attention away from\r\npolyphonic writing; and having, after all, but little to\r\nexpress in other than the long-accustomed dance rhythms and\r\ntunes, their music cannot be said to have made any mark in\r\nthe world. In order to show the poverty of this style, let\r\nus take a sonata by Mehul (1763-1817). The first movement\r\nhas already a well-defined second theme, but otherwise is\r\na mere collection of more or less commonplace progressions.\r\nThe second part is a dance tune, pure and simple; indeed the\r\nfirst part had all the characteristics of the _farandole_\r\n(see Bizet's \"l'Arlesienne\"). The last part is entitled rondo,\r\n\"a round dance,\" and is evidently one in the literal sense of\r\nthe word. In all these sonatas the increasing use of what is\r\ncalled the Alberti bass is noticeable.\r\n\r\nTo show the last link between the suite and the sonata,\r\nreference may be made to the well-known sonata in D major by\r\nHaydn. In this, as in those analyzed above, all the movements\r\nare in the same key. The adagio is a _sarabande_, and the\r\nlast movement has the characteristics of the _gigue_. This,\r\nhowever, is only the starting point with Haydn; later we will\r\nconsider the development of this form into what is practically\r\nour modern sonata, which, of course, includes the symphony,\r\nquartet, quintet, concerto, etc.\r\n\r\nOur path of study in tracing the development of the sonata from\r\nthe suite leads us through a sterile tract of seemingly bare\r\ndesert. The compositions referred to are full of fragments,\r\nsometimes fine in themselves, but lying wherever they happened\r\nto fall, their sculptors having no perception of their value\r\none with another. Disconnected phrases, ideas never completed;\r\nto quote Hamlet, \"Words, words!\" Later we find Beethoven\r\nand Schubert constructing wonderful temples out of these\r\nsame fragments, and shaping these same words into marvellous\r\ntone poems.\r\n\r\nThe music of the period we have been considering is well\r\ndescribed by Browning in \"A Toccata of Galuppi's\":\r\n\r\n    Yes you, like a ghostly cricket,\r\n      Creaking where a house was burned:\r\n    Dust and ashes, dead and done with,\r\n      Venice spent what Venice earned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF PIANOFORTE MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Beethoven, music for the pianoforte consisted\r\nmainly of programme music of the purely descriptive order, that\r\nis to say, it was generally imitative of natural or artificial\r\nexternals. To be sure, if we go back to the old clavecinists,\r\nand examine the sonatas of Kuhnau, sundry pieces by Couperin,\r\nRameau, and the Germans, Froberger, C.P.E. Bach and others,\r\nwe find the beginnings of that higher order of programme music\r\nwhich deals directly with the emotions; and not only that,\r\nbut which aims at causing the hearer to go beyond the actual\r\nsounds heard, in pursuance of a train of thought primarily\r\nsuggested by this music.\r\n\r\nTo find this art of programme music, as we may call it, brought\r\nto a full flower, we must seek in the mystic utterances\r\nof Robert Schumann. It is wise to keep in mind, however,\r\nthat although Schumann's piano music certainly answers to\r\nour definition of the higher programme music, it also marks\r\nthe dividing line between emotional programme music without a\r\nwell-defined object and that dramatically emotional art which\r\nwe have every reason to believe was aimed at by Beethoven in\r\nmany of his sonatas, and which, in its logical development\r\nand broadened out by orchestral colours and other resources,\r\nis championed by Richard Strauss at the present day.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned that C.P.E. Bach had entirely broken\r\nwith the contrapuntal style of his father and his age in\r\norder to gain freer utterance, and that the word \"colour\"\r\nbegan to be used in his time in connection with music for\r\neven one instrument. It is, perhaps, needless to say that the\r\nvastly enlarged possibilities, both technical and tonal, of\r\nthe newly invented _forte-piano_ were largely the outcome of\r\nthis seeking for colour in music. In addition to this, the new\r\nart of harmonic dissonances was already beginning to stretch\r\nout in the direction of new and strange tonal combinations,\r\nthus giving to the music written for the instrument many new\r\npossibilities in the way of causing and depicting emotions. That\r\nthe first experiments were puerile, we know, as, for example,\r\nHaydn's attempts, in one of his pianoforte sonatas, to suggest\r\nthe conversion of an obdurate sinner.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider Mozart, it is impossible to forget the\r\nfact that in his piano works he was first and foremost\r\na piano virtuoso, a child prodigy, of whom filigree work\r\nwas expected by the public for which he wrote his sonatas.\r\n(We cannot call this orientalism, for it was more or less of\r\nGerman pattern, traced from the fioriture of the Italian opera\r\nsinger.) Therefore, emotional utterance or even new or poetic\r\ncolouring was not to be expected of him.\r\n\r\nAs has been said before, it remained for Beethoven to\r\nweld these new words and strange colours into poems, which,\r\nnotwithstanding the many barnacles hanging to them (remnants of\r\na past of timid adhesion to forms and fashions), are, in truth,\r\nthe first lofty and dignified musical utterances with an object\r\nwhich we possess. I mean by this statement that his art was the\r\nfirst to cast aside the iron fetters of what then formed the\r\ncanons of art. The latter may be described (even in reference\r\nto modern days) as constituting the shadow of a great man. And,\r\nalthough this is a digression, I may add that all students of\r\npiano music no doubt realize the weighty shadow that Beethoven\r\ncast over the first half of the nineteenth century, just as\r\nWagner is doing at the present time.\r\n\r\nOur purists are unable to realize that the shadows are the\r\nleast vital part of the great men who cast them. We remember\r\nthat the only wish expressed by Diogenes when Alexander came\r\nto see him was that the king should stand aside so that he\r\ncould enjoy the light of the sun.\r\n\r\nTo return: We find that Beethoven was the first exponent of\r\nour modern art. Every revolution is bound to bring with it a\r\nreaction which seeks to consolidate and put in safe keeping,\r\nas it were, results attained by it. Certainly Beethoven alone\r\ncan hardly be said to have furthered this end; for his revolt\r\nled him into still more remote and involved trains of thought,\r\nas in his later sonatas and quartets. Even the Ninth Symphony,\r\nhampered as it is by actual words for which declamation and a\r\nmore or less well-defined form of musical speech are necessary,\r\nsuffers from the same involved utterance that characterizes\r\nhis last period.\r\n\r\nSchubert, in his instrumental work, was too ardent a seeker\r\nand lover of the purely beautiful to build upon the forms of\r\npast generations, and thus his piano music, neither restrained\r\nnor supported by poetic declamation, was never held within\r\nthe bounds of formalism.\r\n\r\nIt was Mendelssohn who first invested old and seemingly worn-out\r\nforms of instrumental music (especially for the pianoforte)\r\nwith the new poetic license of speech, which was essentially\r\nthe spirit of the age of revolution in which he lived.\r\n\r\nIn holding up Mendelssohn as a formalist against Beethoven,\r\nand at the same time presenting him as the composer directly\r\nresponsible for our modern symphonic poem, there is a\r\nseeming contradiction, which, however, is more apparent than\r\nreal. While Beethoven never hesitated to overturn form (harmonic\r\nor otherwise) to suit the exigencies of his inspiration,\r\nMendelssohn cast all his pictures into well-defined and orthodox\r\nforms. Thus his symphonic poems, for example, the overtures to\r\n\"The Lovely Melusina,\" \"Fingal's Cave,\" \"Ruy Blas,\" etc., are\r\nreally overtures in form; whereas, the so-called \"Moonlight\"\r\nsonata of Beethoven, as well as many others, are sonatas only\r\nin name. The emotional and problematic significance given by\r\nMendelssohn to many of his shorter piano pieces, including even\r\nsuch works as preludes and fugues, is familiar to us all. These\r\nworks, however, but rarely departed from the orthodox forms\r\nrepresented by their names. His \"Songs without Words\" have\r\nbeen so often quoted as constituting a new art form that it\r\nis well to remember that they are practically all cast in\r\nthe same mould, that of the most simple song form, with one,\r\nand sometimes two more or less similar verses, preceded by a\r\nshort introduction and ending with a coda.\r\n\r\nWe may say then, broadly, that Beethoven invested instrumental\r\nmusic with a wonderful poignancy and power of expression,\r\nelevating it to the point of being the medium of expressing\r\nsome of the greatest thoughts we possess. In so doing, however,\r\nhe shattered many of the great idols of formalism by the sheer\r\nviolence of his expression.\r\n\r\nSchubert, let me say again, seemed indifferent to symmetry, or\r\nnever thought of it in his piano music. Mendelssohn, possibly\r\ninfluenced by his early severe training with Zelter, accepted\r\nsymmetry of form as the cornerstone of his musical edifice;\r\nalthough he was one of the first in the realms of avowed\r\nprogramme music, he never carried it beyond the boundary of\r\ngood form. And, as in speaking a moment ago of the so-called\r\ncanons of musical art, we compared them with the shadows that\r\ngreat men have cast upon their times, it may be as well to\r\nremember that just this formalism of Mendelssohn overshadowed\r\nand still overshadows England to the present day. On the other\r\nhand, Beethoven's last style still shows itself in Brahms,\r\nand even in Richard Strauss. Schumann was different from\r\nthese three. His music is not avowed programme music; neither\r\nis it, as is much of Schubert's, pure delight in beautiful\r\nmelodies and sounds. It did not break through formalism by\r\nsheer violence of emotion, as did Beethoven's; least of all\r\nhas it Mendelssohn's orthodox dress. It represents, as well as\r\nI can put it, the rhapsodical reverie of a great poet to whom\r\nnothing seems strange, and who has the faculty of relating\r\nhis visions, never attempting to give them coherence, until,\r\nperhaps, when awakened from his dream, he naively wonders what\r\nthey may have meant. It will be remembered that Schumann added\r\ntitles to his music after it was composed.\r\n\r\nTo all of this new, strange music, Liszt and Chopin added the\r\nwonderful tracery of orientalism. As I have said before, the\r\ndifference between these two is that with Chopin this tracery\r\nenveloped poetic thought as with a thin gauze; whereas with\r\nLiszt, the embellishment itself made the starting point for\r\nalmost a new art in tonal combination, the effects of which are\r\nseen on every hand to-day. To realize its influence, one need\r\nonly compare the graceful arabesques of the most simple piano\r\npiece of to-day with the awkward and gargoyle-like figuration\r\nof Beethoven and his predecessors. We may justly attribute this\r\nto Liszt rather than to Chopin, whose nocturne embellishments\r\nare but first cousins to those of the Englishman, John Field,\r\nthough naturally Chopin's Polish temperament gave his work that\r\ngrace and profusion of design which we have called orientalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY AND MIRACLE PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to recall the origin of our words \"treble\"\r\nand \"discant.\" The latter was derived from the first attempts to\r\nbreak away from the monotony of several persons singing the same\r\nmelody in unison, octaves, fifths, or fourths. In such cases\r\nthe original melody was called _cantus firmus_ (a term still\r\ngenerally used in counterpoint to designate the given melody\r\nof an exercise to which the student is to write other parts),\r\nthe new melody that was sung with it was called the _discant_,\r\nand when a third part was added, it received the name _triplum_\r\nor _treble_. As Ambros remarks, this forcible welding together\r\nof different melodies, often well-known old tunes, secular\r\nor derived from the church chants, was on a direct line with\r\nthe contemporary condition of the other arts. For instance,\r\non the portal to the left of the Cathedral of Saint Mark,\r\nat Venice, is a relief, representing some Biblical scene,\r\nwhich is entirely made up of fragments of some older sculptured\r\nfigures, placed together without regard to anatomy in much the\r\nsame brutal fashion that the melodies of the time were sung\r\ntogether. The traces of this clumsy music-making extended down\r\nto Palestrina's time, and became the germ of counterpoint,\r\ncanon, and fugue, constituting (apart from the folk song)\r\nthe only music known at that time.\r\n\r\nThis music, however, very soon developed into two styles, one\r\nadopted by the church, the other, a secular style, furnishing\r\nthe musical texture both of opera and other secular music. The\r\nopera, or rather the art form we know under that name (for the\r\nname itself conveys nothing, for which reason Wagner coined the\r\nterm \"music drama\") broke away from the church in the guise of\r\nMysteries, as they were called in mediaeval times. A Mystery\r\n(of which our modern oratorio is the direct descendant) was\r\na kind of drama illustrating some sacred subject, and the\r\nearliest specimens laid the foundation for the Greek tragedy\r\nand comedy. We still see a relic of this primitive art form\r\nin the Oberammergau Passion Play.\r\n\r\nWe read of the efforts made, as early as the fifth century,\r\nto hold the people to the church; among other devices employed\r\nwas that of illustrating the subjects of the services by the\r\npriests performing the offices being dressed in an appropriate\r\ncostume. Little by little the popular songs of the people\r\ncrept into the church service among the regular ecclesiastical\r\nchants, thus foreshadowing the beginnings of modern opera;\r\nfor after a while, special Latin texts were substituted for\r\nthe regular service, the mimetic part of which degenerated\r\ninto the most extraordinary license as, for instance, in the\r\n\"Feast of Asses\" (January 14) which may be called a burlesque\r\nof the mass, and which has been described in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nWith this mixture of the vernacular and the official Latin,[14]\r\nthese Miracle and Passion Plays, as well as the Mysteries and\r\nMoralities (as different forms of this ecclesiastical mumming\r\nwere called) began to be given in other places besides the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this combination of singing and acting, the\r\n_tenson_ or poetic debate (which was one form of the troubadour\r\nsongs, and one very often _acted_ by the jongleurs) probably\r\nalso did its part towards giving stability to this new art\r\nform. The earliest specimen of it, in its purely secular aspect,\r\nis a small work entitled \"Robin et Marian,\" by Adam de la Hale,\r\na well-known troubadour (called \"the humpback,\" born at Arras\r\nin the south of France in 1240), who followed in the train of\r\nthat ferocious Duke Charles of Anjou, who beheaded Konradin,\r\nthe last of the Hohenstaufens, in 1268, and Manfred, both of\r\nthem minnesingers.\r\n\r\nAs the Mystery was the direct ancestor of our oratorio, so was\r\nthe little pastoral of Adam de la Hale the germ of the modern\r\nFrench vaudeville. One of its melodies is said to be sung to\r\nthis day in some parts of southern France.\r\n\r\nThe entire object in this little play being that both words and\r\naction should be perfectly understood, it is obvious that as\r\nlittle as possible should be going on during the singing. Thus,\r\nsuch melodies as we find in these old pastoral plays would be\r\naccompanied by short notes, serving merely to give the pitch\r\nand tonality, which would gradually develop into chords,\r\nthus laying the foundation for harmony.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we look at the \"church play\" of the\r\nsame period, the Mystery, and remember that it was sung by\r\nmen accustomed to singing the _organum_ of Hucbald, we have\r\na clue as to what it was and what it led up to. For while\r\none part or voice of the music would give a melody (copied\r\nfrom or at any rate resembling the Gregorian chant or the\r\nsequences of Notker of Tubilo), the other voices would sing\r\nsongs in the vernacular, and, strangest of all, one voice\r\nwould repeat some Latin word, or even a \"nonsense word\"\r\n(to use Edward Lear's term) but much more slowly than the\r\nother voices. Thus the needs of the Mystery were as well met\r\nby incipient counterpoint on the one hand, as, on the other,\r\nthe secular song-play engendered the sense of harmony.\r\n\r\nThat the early secular forerunner of opera, as represented by\r\n\"Robin et Marian,\" was still, to a certain degree, controlled\r\nby the church is clear if we remember that at that time the\r\nonly methods of noting music were entirely in the hands of the\r\nclergy. The notation for the lute, for instance, was invented\r\nabout 1460 to 1500. Thus, we can say that the recording of\r\nsecular music was not free from church influence until some\r\ntime after the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis primitive \"opera\" music was thus fettered by difficulty of\r\nnotation and the influence of the ecclesiastical rules until\r\nperhaps about 1600, when the first real opera began to find a\r\nplace in Italy. Jacopo Peri and Caccini were among the first\r\nworkers in the comparatively new form, and they both took\r\nthe same subject, _Eurydice_. Of the former the following\r\ntwo short excerpts will suffice; the first is where Orpheus\r\nbewails his fate; in the second he expresses his joy at bringing\r\nEurydice back to earth. Caccini's opera was perhaps the first\r\nto introduce the many useless ornaments that, up to the middle\r\nof this century, were characteristic of Italian opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EURYDICE--PERI.\r\n\r\n    Orpheus bewailing his fate.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 43]\r\n    [W: I weep not, I am not sighing, tho' thou art from me taken.\r\n        What use to sigh]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Orpheus' joy in bringing back Eurydice.\r\n\r\n    [Figure 44]\r\n    [W: Gioi-te al canto mio serve frondo di che in su l'au rora]\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] It is interesting to note as to the prevalence of Latin,\r\n     that Dante's \"Divina Commedia\" was the first important\r\n     poem in Italian. Latin was used on the stage in Italy\r\n     up to the sixteenth century; the stationary chorus\r\n     stationed on the stage remained until the seventeenth\r\n     century and was not entirely discontinued until the\r\n     first half of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nOPERA\r\n\r\n\r\nNo art form is so fleeting and so subject to the dictates of\r\nfashion as opera. It has always been the plaything of fashion,\r\nand suffers from its changes. To-day the stilted figures of\r\nHasse, Pergolesi, Rameau, and even Gluck, seem as grotesque\r\nto us as the wigs and buckles of their contemporaries. To\r\nPalestrina's masses and madrigals, Rameau's and Couperin's\r\nclavecin pieces, and all of Bach, we can still listen without\r\nthis sense of incongruity. On the other hand, operas of\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti, Matheson, and Porpora would bore us\r\nunmitigatedly. They have gone out of fashion. Even the modern\r\nsuccessors of these men, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi, in his\r\nearlier years, have become dead letters musically, although only\r\nas late as 1845, Donizetti was at the very zenith of his fame.\r\n\r\nOf all the operas of the past century, our present public has\r\nnot seen or even heard of one, with the exception of \"The Magic\r\nFlute,\" and less probably \"Don Juan.\" This is bad enough;\r\nbut if we look at works belonging to the first part of the\r\nnineteenth century, we find the same state of affairs. The\r\noperas of Spontini, Rossini, most of Meyerbeer's, even Weber's\r\n\"Freischuetz,\" have passed away, seemingly never to return. Even\r\n\"Cavalleria Rusticana,\" of recent creation, is falling rapidly\r\ninto oblivion. Thus the opera comique early disappeared in\r\nfavour of the romantic opera and the operetta. The former has\r\nalready nearly ended its career, and the latter has descended\r\nto the level of mere farce. In the course of time, these opera\r\nforms become more and more evanescent; for the one-act opera of\r\nminiature tragedy, which is practically only a few years old,\r\nis already almost extinct.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this art form has vastly more hold on the public than\r\nother music destined to outlive it. The fact is, that music\r\nwhich is tied down to the conventionalities and moods of its\r\ntime and place can never appeal but to the particular time and\r\nmood which gave it birth. (Incidentally, I may say the same of\r\nmusic having its roots in the other peculiarities of folk song.)\r\n\r\nNow the writers of these operas were great men who put their\r\nbest into their work; the cause of the failure of these operas\r\nwas not on account of the music, but the ideas and thoughts\r\nwith which this music was saddled. What were the books which\r\npeople read and loved in those days (1750-1800), that is,\r\nbooks upon which operas might be built? In England we find \"The\r\nCastle of Otranto,\" \"The Mysterious Mother,\" etc., by Horace\r\nWalpole. Now Macaulay says that Horace Walpole's works rank\r\nas high among the delicacies of intellectual epicures as the\r\nStrasburg pie among the dishes described in the _Almanach des\r\nGourmands_. None but an unhealthy and disorganized mind could\r\nhave produced such literary luxuries as the works of Walpole.\r\n\r\nFrance had not yet recovered from the empty formalism of\r\nthe preceding century, Bernardin de St. Pierre was a kind\r\nof colonial Mlle. Scudery, and Jean Jacques Rousseau, one\r\nof the sparks which were to ignite the French Revolution,\r\nwrites his popular opera to the silly story of \"The Village\r\nSoothsayer.\" Had not Gluck written to the classics he would\r\nhave had to write \"a la Watteau.\"\r\n\r\nIn Germany, conditions were better; for the so-called Romantic\r\nschool had just begun to make headway. In opera, however, this\r\nschool of Romanticism only commenced to make itself felt later,\r\nwhen we have a crop of operas on Fouque's \"Undine\" as well as\r\n\"Hofmann's Tales.\"\r\n\r\nIt is as though opera had to dress according to the prevailing\r\nfashion of the day. The very large sleeves of one year look\r\nstrange to us a little later. Just so is it with opera; for\r\nthose old operas by Mehul, Spontini, Salieri, and others all\r\nwear enormous crinolines, while the contemporary instrumental\r\nworks of the same period, unfettered by fashion, still possess\r\nall the freedom which their limited speech permitted them to\r\nhave. Thus we see that opera is necessarily a child of the times\r\nin which it is written, in contrast to other music which echoes\r\nbut the thought of the composer, thought that is not necessarily\r\nbound down to any time, place, or peculiarity of diction.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Italian opera was never accepted by the people as\r\nit was in France. In the latter country, opera had to be in the\r\nvernacular and practically to become _French_. Lully's operas\r\nwere written to libretti by Quinault and Corneille; and while,\r\nas early as 1645, Paris imported its opera from Italy, this\r\nart form was rapidly modified to suit the public for which\r\nit was secured. Even with Piccini and Gluck, and down to\r\nRossini and Meyerbeer, this nationalism was infused into the\r\nforeign product. In Germany the case was entirely different,\r\nfor up to the very last, Italian opera was a thing apart.\r\nAlthough German composers, such as Mozart and Paer, wrote\r\nItalian opera, the \"Singspiel\" (a kind of opera comique),\r\nfound its culminating point in Weber's \"Freischuetz,\" which\r\nfought against Rossini's operas for supremacy in Germany.\r\n\r\nGluck's victory over the Piccinists gave to the French form\r\nof Italian opera an impetus that caused Cherubini to proceed\r\non almost the same lines in his operas, the \"Water Carrier,\"\r\netc. Cherubini was a pupil of Andreas Sarti, a celebrated\r\ncontrapuntist and a disciple of the last of the Italian church\r\ncomposers who looked back to Palestrina for inspiration. Thus\r\nthe infusion of a certain soberness of diction, which we call\r\nGerman, fitted in with the man's training and predilections.\r\n\r\nThe first names we meet with in French opera after Cherubini\r\nare those of Gretry, Mehul, and Spontini. The former was a\r\nFrenchman whose works are now obsolete, although Macfarren, in\r\nthe \"Encyclopedia Brittanica,\" says that he is the only French\r\ncomposer of symphonies that are known and enjoy popularity\r\nin France.\r\n\r\nGretry was born in Liege, about 1740. He walked to Italy,\r\nstudied in Rome, and returned to France about 1770. None of\r\nhis works have come down to us, but his name is interesting\r\nby reason of a certain contradiction in his operas. This\r\ncontradiction consists in his being one of the first to revive\r\nthe idea of the hidden orchestra; it is interesting also to\r\nnote that in his \"Richard Coeur de Lion,\" he anticipated\r\nWagner's use of the _leitmotiv_. His words on the hidden\r\norchestra sound strangely modern:\r\n\r\n    PLAN FOR A NEW THEATRE.--I should like the auditorium\r\n    of my theatre to be small, holding at the most one\r\n    thousand persons and consisting of a sort of open\r\n    space, without boxes, small or great; for these nooks\r\n    only encourage talking and scandal. I would like\r\n    the orchestra to be concealed, so that neither the\r\n    musicians nor the lights on their music stands could\r\n    be visible to the spectators.\r\n\r\nMehul was born about 1763 in the south of France, and is\r\ncelebrated, among other things, as being a pupil of Gluck,\r\nin Paris. He was also noted for having, at the request of\r\nNapoleon, brought out an opera based on Macpherson's \"Ossian,\"\r\nin which no violins were used in the orchestra. \"Joseph,\"\r\nanother opera of his, is occasionally given in small German\r\ntowns. Mehul died in 1817.\r\n\r\nSpontini, the next representative of opera in France, was an\r\nItalian, born in 1774. He went to Paris in 1803, where, through\r\nthe influence of the Empress Josephine, he was enabled to have\r\nseveral small operas performed; finally in 1807 his \"Vestal,\"\r\nwritten to a French text, was given with great success. In this,\r\nhis greatest work, he followed Gluck's footsteps, not only in\r\nthe music, but also in the choice of a classic subject. In 1809,\r\nhe branched out into a more romantic vein with the opera of\r\n\"Fernando Cortez.\" His other works never attained popularity.\r\nAfter the Restoration in France, he was named director of the\r\ncourt music in Berlin by the King of Prussia, at an annual\r\nsalary of ten thousand thalers (about $7,500), a position he\r\nheld from 1820 to 1840. He died in Italy in 1851. Spontini may\r\nbe said to have been the last representative of the Gluck opera;\r\nbut he also brought into it all the magnificence in scenery,\r\netc., that would naturally be expected by the fashion of the\r\nFirst Empire. He made no innovations, and merely served to\r\nkeep alive the traditions of Grand Opera in France.\r\n\r\nThe next powerful influence in France, and indeed in all\r\nEurope, was that of Rossini. He may be said to have built on\r\nGluck's ideas in many ways. Born in 1792, at Pesaro, in Italy,\r\nhe wrote many operas of the flimsy Italian style while still\r\na boy. At twenty-one he had already written his \"Tancredi\"\r\nand the opera buffa, \"The Italians in Algiers.\" His best work\r\n(besides \"William Tell\") was \"The Barber of Seville.\" Other\r\nworks are \"Cinderella\" (_La Cenerentola_), \"The Thieving\r\nBlackbird\" (_La Gazza Ladra_), \"Moses,\" and \"The Lady of the\r\nLake.\" These operas were mostly made up of parts of others\r\nthat were failures, a la Hasse. An engagement being offered\r\nhim in London, he went there with his wife, and in one season\r\nthey earned about two hundred thousand francs, which laid the\r\nfoundation for his future prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe next year he went to Paris, where, after a few unimportant\r\nworks, he, produced \"William Tell\" with tremendous success\r\n(1829). Although he lived until 1868, he never wrote for\r\nthe operatic stage again, his other works being mainly the\r\nwell-known \"Stabat Mater\" and some choruses. He was essentially\r\na writer of light opera, although \"William Tell\" has many\r\nelevated moments. His style was so entirely warped by his love\r\nfor show and the virtuoso side of singing that the many real\r\nbeauties of his music are hardly recognizable. His music is\r\nso overladen with _fioriture_ that often its very considerable\r\nvalue is obscured. He had absolutely no influence upon German\r\nmusic, for the Germans, from Beethoven down, despised the\r\nflimsy style and aims of this man, who, by appealing to the\r\nmost unmusical side of the fashionable audiences of Europe,\r\ndid so much to discourage the production of operas with a\r\nlofty aim. In France, however, his influence was unchallenged,\r\nand we may almost say that, with few exceptions, the overture\r\nto \"William Tell\" served as a model for all other operatic\r\novertures which have been written there up to the present\r\nday. We have only to look at the many overtures by Herold,\r\nBoieldieu, Auber, and others, to see the influence exerted by\r\nthis style of overture, which consisted of a slow introduction,\r\nfollowed by a more or less sentimental melody, followed in\r\nturn by a galop as a coda.\r\n\r\nSo fashionable had this kind of thing become that even Weber was\r\nslightly touched by it. In the meanwhile, the French composers\r\nwere producing operas of a smaller kind, but, in many ways, of\r\na better character than the larger works of Rossini, Spontini,\r\nand their followers. Had this flimsy Italian influence been\r\nlacking, doubtless French opera to-day would be a different\r\nthing from what it actually is. For these smaller operas by\r\nHerold, Auber, and Boieldieu had many points in common with\r\nthe German _Singspiel_, which may be said to have saved German\r\nmusical art for Wagner.\r\n\r\nWhat might have developed under better conditions is shown\r\nin a work by Halevy entitled, \"La juive,\" in which is to be\r\nfound promise of a great school of opera, a promise unhappily\r\nstifled by the advent of an eclectic, the German Meyerbeer,\r\nwho blinded the public with unheard of magnificence of staging,\r\njust as Rossini before him had blinded it by novel technical\r\nfeats. Meyerbeer thus drew the art into a new channel, and,\r\nunluckily, this new tendency was not so much in the direction\r\nof elevation of style as in sensationalism.\r\n\r\nTo return to the French composers. Herold was born in 1791,\r\nin Paris, and his principal works were \"Zampa\" and the \"Pre\r\naux clercs.\" The first was produced in 1831, the latter in\r\n1832. He died in 1833. Boieldieu was born in 1775, in Rouen;\r\ndied 1834. His principal works were \"La dame blanche\" and\r\n\"Jean de Paris.\"\r\n\r\nHalevy (Levy) was born in 1799, in Paris, and died in 1862;\r\nhis father was a Bavarian and his mother from Lorraine. He\r\nwrote innumerable operas. His most famous work, \"La juive,\"\r\nwritten in 1835, was killed by Meyerbeer's \"Huguenots,\" and\r\nproduced a year later. He was professor of counterpoint at\r\nthe Conservatoire from 1831, among his pupils being Gounod,\r\nMasse, Bazin, and Bizet.\r\n\r\nAuber was born in 1782, and died in May, 1871. He was\r\npractically the last of the essentially French composers.\r\nHis operas may be summed up as being the perfect translation\r\ninto music of the witty plays of Scribe, with whom he was\r\nassociated all his life. To read a comedy by Scribe is to\r\nimagine Auber's music to it. No one has excelled Auber in\r\nthe expression of all the finesse of wit and lightness of\r\ntouch. What the union between the two men was may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that Scribe wrote many of his librettos to\r\nAuber's music, the latter being written first, Scribe then\r\nadding the words. His principal works are \"Masaniello\" or\r\n\"The Mute,\" and \"Fra Diavolo.\" He was appointed director of\r\nthe Paris Conservatoire, in 1842, in succession to Cherubini.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Gretry, I quoted his opinion (given in one of\r\nhis essays on music) as to what opera should be and cited his\r\nuse of the _leitmotiv_ in his \"Richard Coeur de Lion\" (which\r\ncontains the air, _une fievre brulante_). If with this we\r\nquote his reasons for writing opera comique rather than grand\r\nopera, we have one of the reasons why French opera has, as yet,\r\nnever developed beyond Massenet's \"Roi de Lahore\" on one side,\r\nand Delibes' \"Lakme\" on the other.\r\n\r\nGretry writes that he introduced lyric comedy on the stage\r\nbecause the public was tired of tragedy, and because he had\r\nheard so many lovers of dancing complain that their favourite\r\nart played only a subordinate role in grand opera. Also the\r\npublic loved to hear short songs; therefore he introduced many\r\nsuch into his operas.\r\n\r\nEven nowadays, this seeming contradiction between theory and\r\npractice is to be found, I think, in the French successors of\r\nMeyerbeer. The public needed dancing, and all theories must\r\nbend to that wish. Even Wagner succumbed to this influence in\r\nParis; and when Weber's \"Freischuetz\" was first given at the\r\ngrand opera, Berlioz was commissioned to arrange ballet music\r\nfrom Weber's piano works to supply the deficiency.\r\n\r\nIn France, even to-day, everything gives way to the public,\r\na public whose intelligence from a poetic standpoint is, in\r\nmy opinion, lower than that of any other country. The French\r\ncomposer is dependent on his country (Paris) as is no musician\r\nof other nationality. Berlioz' life was embittered by the want\r\nof recognition in Paris. Although he had been acclaimed as\r\na great musician all over Europe, yet he returned again and\r\nagain to Paris, preferring (as he admits) the approbation of\r\nits musically worthless public to his otherwise world-wide fame.\r\n\r\nWe remember that Auber never stirred out of Paris throughout\r\nhis long life. It was an article in the _Gazette Musicale_ of\r\nParis which was instrumental in calling Gounod back into the\r\nworld from his intended priestly vocation. And this influence\r\nof the admittedly ignorant and superficial French public is\r\nthe more remarkable when one considers the fact that it was\r\nalways the last to admit the value of the best work of its\r\ncomposers. Thus Berlioz' fame was gained in Russia and Germany\r\nwhile he was still derided and comparatively unknown in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Bizet's \"Carmen\" is said to have hastened the\r\ncomposer's death, which took place within three months after\r\nthe first performance of the opera. As Saint-Saens wrote at\r\nthe time, in his disgust at the French public: \"The fat, ugly\r\nbourgeois ruminates in his padded stall, regretting separation\r\nfrom his kind. He half opens a glassy eye, munches a bonbon,\r\nthen sleeps again, thinking that the orchestra is a-tuning.\" And\r\nyet, even Saint-Saens, whose name became known chiefly through\r\nLiszt's help, and whose operas and symphonies were given\r\nin Germany before they were known in France, even he is one\r\nof the most ardent adherents to the \"anti-foreigner\" cry in\r\nFrance. In my opinion, this respect for and attempt to please\r\nthis grossly ignorant French public is and has been one of the\r\ngreat devitalizing influences which hamper the French composer.\r\n\r\nCharles Gounod was born in 1818, in Paris. His father was\r\nan engraver and died when Gounod was very young. The boy\r\nreceived his first music lessons from his mother. He was\r\nadmitted to the Conservatoire at sixteen, and studied with\r\nHalevy and Lesueur. In 1839 he gained _the Prix de Rome_,\r\nand spent three years in Rome, studying ecclesiastical\r\nmusic. In 1846 he contemplated becoming a priest, and wrote\r\na number of religious vocal works, published under the name\r\nAbbe C. Gounod. In 1851 the article I referred to appeared,\r\nand such was its effect on Gounod, that within four months his\r\nfirst opera \"Sapho\" was given (April, 1851). A year later this\r\nwas followed by some music for a tragedy (Poussard's \"Ulysse\"\r\nat the Comedie Francaise), and in 1854 by the five-act opera \"La\r\nnonne sanglante.\" These were only very moderately successful;\r\nand so Gounod turned to the opera comique, and wrote music to\r\nan adaptation of Moliere's \"Medecin malgre lui.\" This became\r\nvery popular, and paved the way for his \"Faust,\" which was\r\nproduced at the Opera Comique in 1859. In the opera comique,\r\nas we know, the singing was always interspersed with spoken\r\ndialogue. Thus, this opera, as we know it, dates from its\r\npreparation for the Grand Opera ten years later, 1869. Ten\r\nmonths after \"Faust\" was given he used a fable of Lafontaine\r\nfor a short light opera, \"Philemon and Baucis.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, \"Faust\" began to bring him encouragement,\r\nand his next opera was on the subject of the \"Queen of Sheba\"\r\n(1862). This being unsuccessful, he wrote two more light operas,\r\n\"Mireille\" and \"La colombe\" (1866). The next was \"Romeo et\r\nJuliette\" (1867). This was very successful, and marks the\r\nculmination of Gounod's success as an opera composer. In\r\n1870 he went to London, where he made his home for a number\r\nof years. His later operas, \"Cinq-Mars\" (1877), \"Polyeucte\"\r\n(1878), and \"Le tribut de Zamora\" (1881), met with small\r\nsuccess, and have rarely been given.\r\n\r\nIn his later years, as we know, he showed his early predilection\r\nfor religious music; and his oratorios \"The Redemption,\"\r\n\"Mors et Vita,\" and several masses have been given with\r\nvarying success. Perhaps one of the greatest points ever made\r\nin Gounod's favour by a critic was that by Pougin, who asks what\r\nother composer could have written two such operas as \"Faust\" and\r\n\"Romeo et Juliette\" and still have them essentially different\r\nmusically. The \"Garden Scene\" in the one and the \"Balcony Scene\"\r\nin the other are identical, so far as the feeling of the play\r\nis concerned; also the duel of Faust and Valentine and Romeo\r\nand Tybalt.\r\n\r\nAmbroise Thomas's better works, \"Mignon\" and \"Hamlet,\" may\r\nbe said to be more or less echoes of Gounod; and while his\r\n\"Francesca da Rimini,\" which was brought out in 1882, was by\r\nfar his most ambitious work, it never became known outside of\r\nParis. Ambroise Thomas was born in 1811, and died within a year\r\nof Gounod. His chief merit was in his successful direction\r\nof the Conservatoire, to which he succeeded Auber in 1871.\r\n\r\nGeorges Bizet (his name was Alexander Cesar Leopold) was born in\r\n1838, in Paris. His father was a poor singing teacher, and his\r\nmother a sister-in-law of Delsarte; she was a first-prize piano\r\npupil of the Conservatoire. As a boy, Bizet was very precocious,\r\nand entered the Conservatoire as a pupil of Marmontel when he\r\nwas ten. He took successively the first prizes for solfege,\r\npiano, organ, and fugue, and finally the _Prix de Rome_ in\r\n1857, when he was nineteen years old. The latter kept him\r\nin Rome until 1861, when he returned to Paris and gave piano\r\nand harmony lessons and arranged dance music for brass bands,\r\na _metier_ not unknown to either Wagner or Raff.\r\n\r\nUntil 1872, Bizet wrote but small and unimportant works, such\r\nas \"The Pearl Fisher,\" \"The Fair Maid of Perth,\" and several\r\nvaudeville operettas, some of which he wrote to order and\r\nanonymously. He married a daughter of Halevy, the composer,\r\nand in 1871-72 served in the National Guard. His first\r\nimportant work was the incidental music to Alphonse Daudet's\r\n\"L'Arlesienne\" and finally his \"Carmen\" was given (but without\r\nsuccess), at the Opera Comique, in March, 1875. He died June 3,\r\n1875.\r\n\r\nCamille Saint-Saens was born in Paris, in 1835; he commenced\r\nstudying piano when only three years old. I believe it is\r\nmostly through his piano concertos and his symphonic poems\r\nthat his name will live; for his operas have never attained\r\npopularity, with perhaps the one exception of \"Samson and\r\nDelilah.\" His other operas are: \"The Yellow Princess,\"\r\n\"Proserpina,\" \"Etienne Marcel,\" \"Henry VIII,\" \"Ascanio.\"\r\n\r\nJules Massenet was born in 1842, and at the age of twelve\r\nbecame a pupil of Bezit at the Conservatoire, was rejected by\r\nBezit for want of talent, and afterward studied with Reber and\r\nThomas, and won the _Prix de Rome_ in 1863. Upon his return,\r\nin 1866, he wrote a number of small orchestral works, including\r\ntwo suites and several sacred dramas, \"Marie Magdalen\" and\r\n\"Eve and the Virgin,\" in which the general Meyerbeerian style\r\nmilitated against any suggestion of religious feeling. His\r\nfirst grand opera, \"Le roi de Lahore,\" was given in 1881.\r\nThe second was \"Herodiade,\" which was followed by \"Manon,\"\r\n\"The Cid,\" \"Esclarmonde,\" \"Le mage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nOPERA (Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most disputed questions in modern music is that of\r\nopera. Although we have many controversies as to what purely\r\ninstrumental or vocal music may do, the operatic art, if we\r\nmay call it so, always remains the same. In creating the music\r\ndrama, Wagner put forth a composite art, something which many\r\ndeclare impossible, and as many others advocate as being the\r\nmost complete art form yet conceived. We are still in the\r\nmidst of the discussion, and a final verdict is therefore\r\nas yet impossible. On one hand we have Wagner, and against\r\nhim we have the absolutists such as Brahms, the orthodox\r\nthinkers represented by Anton Rubinstein and many others,\r\nthe new Russian school represented by Cui, Rimsky-Korsakov,\r\nTchaikovsky, and the successors of the French school of\r\nMeyerbeer, namely, Saint-Saens, Massenet, etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a clear idea of the present state of the\r\nmatter we must review the question from the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. For many reasons this is not an easy task,\r\nfirst of all because very little of the music of the operas\r\nof this period actually exists. We know the names of Hasse,\r\nPergolesi, Matheson, Graun, Alessandro Scarlatti (who was a much\r\ngreater man than his son the harpsichord player and composer,\r\nDomenico), to name only a few. To be sure, a number of the\r\nFrench operas of the period are preserved, owing to the custom\r\nin France of engraving music. In Germany and Italy, however,\r\nsuch operas were never printed, and one may safely say that\r\nit was almost the rule for only one manuscript copy to be\r\navailable. Naturally this copy belonged to the composer, who\r\ngenerally led the opera himself, improvising much of it on the\r\nharpsichord, as we shall see later. As an instance of the danger\r\nwhich operas, under such conditions, ran of being destroyed\r\nand thus lost to the world, we may cite the total destruction\r\nof over sixty of Hasse's operas in his extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThe second point which makes it difficult for us to get an\r\nabsolutely clear insight into the conditions of opera at the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century lies in the fact that\r\ncontemporary historians never brought their histories up\r\nto their own times. Thus Marpurg, in his history, divides\r\nmusic into four periods; first, that of Adam and Eve to\r\nthe flood; second, from the flood to the Argonauts; third,\r\nto the beginning of the Olympiads; fourth, from thence to\r\nPythagoras. The same may be said of the celebrated histories\r\nof Gerbert and Padre Martini.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are certain that much of the modern\r\nspeculation was anticipated by these men. For instance, Matheson\r\ncalls pantomime \"dumb music,\" freed from melodic and harmonic\r\nforms. The idea was advanced that music owes its rhythmic\r\nregularity and form to dancing, and architecture was called\r\nfrozen music, a metaphor which, in later days, was considered\r\nsuch an original conception of Goethe and Schlegel. This same\r\ninability of historians to bring their accounts up to the\r\ncontemporary times may be noticed in the later works of Forkel\r\n(d. 1818) and Ambros (d. 1876).\r\n\r\nYet a third reason remains which tends to confuse the student\r\nas to what really constituted opera. This is owing to the fact\r\nthat there existed the very important element of improvisation,\r\nof which I shall speak later.\r\n\r\nIn order to see what Gluck, Weber, and Wagner had to break away\r\nfrom, let us look at the condition of opera at the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century. We remember that opera, having\r\nbecome emancipated from the Church long before any other music,\r\ndeveloped apace, while instrumental (secular) music was still in\r\nits infancy. In Germany, even the drama was neglected for its\r\nkindred form of opera; therefore, in studying its development,\r\nwe may well understand why the dramatic stage considered the\r\nopera its deadly enemy.\r\n\r\nThe life of the German dramatist and actor of the first half\r\nof the eighteenth century was one of the direst hardship and\r\npoverty. Eckhof, one of the greatest actors of his time, made\r\nhis entry into Brunswick in a kind of miserable hay cart, in\r\nwhich, accompanied by his sick wife and several dogs, he had\r\ntravelled over the rough roads. To keep warm they had filled\r\npart of the wagon with straw. The German actor and dramatist\r\nof that time often died in the hospital, despised by the richer\r\nclasses; even the village priests and ministers refused to allow\r\nthem to eat at their tables. Their scenery rarely consisted\r\nof more than three rough pieces: a landscape, a large room,\r\nand a peasant's hut interior. Many even had only two large\r\ncloths which were hung about the stage, one green, which was\r\nto be used when the scene was in the open air, and the other\r\nyellow, which was used to represent an interior. Shakespeare's\r\n\"Poor Players\" were certainly a stern reality in Germany. In\r\norder to attract the public the plays had to consist for the\r\nmost part of the grossest subjects imaginable, it being barely\r\npossible to smuggle some small portion of serious drama into\r\nthe entertainment.\r\n\r\nWith opera, however, it was vastly different; opera troupes\r\nwere met at the city gates by the royal or ducal carriages,\r\nand the singers were feted everywhere. The prices paid them\r\ncan only be compared with the salaries paid nowadays. They\r\nwere often ennobled, and the different courts quarrelled for\r\nthe honour of their presence. The accounts of the cost of\r\nthe scenery used are incredible, amounting to many thousands\r\nof dollars for a single performance.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest German kapellmeisters and opera composers\r\nwas Johann Adolf Hasse, who was born in Dresden about 1700. To\r\nshow the foundation upon which Gluck built, we will look at\r\nopera as it existed in Hasse's time. In 1727 Hasse married at\r\nVenice, Faustina Bordoni, the foremost singer of the time. He\r\nwrote over one hundred operas for her, and had a salary of\r\nthirty-six thousand marks, or nine thousand dollars, yearly. Now\r\nthese operas were very different from those we know. The arias\r\nin them (and, of course, the whole opera was practically but a\r\nsuccession of arias) were only sketched in an extremely vague\r\nmanner. Much was left to the singer, and the accompaniment\r\nwas sparsely indicated by figures written above a bass. The\r\nrecitative which separated one aria from another was improvised\r\nby the singer, and was accompanied on the harpsichord by the\r\nkapellmeister, who was naturally obliged to improvise his\r\npart on the spur of the moment, following the caprice of the\r\nsinger. There was no creating an atmosphere for a tragic or\r\ndramatic situation by means of the accompaniment; as soon as\r\nthe situation arrived, an aria was sung explaining it. Now,\r\nas the singer was given much latitude in regard to the melody,\r\nand _absolute_ liberty in regard to the recitative, it is easy\r\nto see that, with the astounding technical perfection possessed\r\nby the singers of the time, this latitude would be used to\r\nastonish the hearers by wonderful vocal feats intermingled\r\nwith more or less passionate declamation.\r\n\r\nThe composer was merely the excuse for the opera; but he\r\nneeded to be a consummate musician to conduct and accompany\r\nthis improvised music, of which his written score was but the\r\nnucleus. The wretched acting of opera singers in general has\r\nbeen rather humourously traced back to this epoch. Nowadays,\r\nin an opera, when, by way of example, a murder is to be\r\ncommitted, the orchestra paints the situation, and the act is\r\naccomplished without delay. In those olden days a singer would\r\nhave indignantly refused to submit to such a usurpation of\r\nhis rights; he would have raised his dagger, and then, before\r\nstriking, would have sung an aria in the regular three parts,\r\nafter which he would have stabbed his man. The necessity for\r\ndoing something during this interim is said to be responsible\r\nfor those idiotic gestures which used to be such a seemingly\r\nnecessary part of the equipment of the opera singer.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary opera of the time there was the custom of\r\nusually having about from twenty to thirty such arias (Hasse's\r\none hundred operas contain about three thousand arias). Now\r\nthese arias, although they were intended to paint a situation,\r\nrapidly became simply a means to display the singer's skill. The\r\nsecond part was a melody with plenty of vocal effects, and\r\nthe third part a bravura piece, pure and simple. So there\r\nonly remained the recitative in which true dramatic art could\r\nfind place. As this, however, was invariably improvised by the\r\nsinger, one can see that the composer of music had his cross\r\nas well as his brother the dramatist. The music having no vital\r\nconnection with the text, it is easy to see how one opera could\r\nbe set to several texts or _vice-versa_, as was often done.\r\n\r\nAnother factor also contributed to retard the artistic\r\ndevelopment of opera. All these arias had to be constructed\r\nand sung according to certain customs. Thus, the fiery, minor\r\naria was always sung by the villain, the so-called colorature\r\narias by the tall, majestic heroine, etc.\r\n\r\nAll this seems childish to us, but it was certainly a powerful\r\nfactor in making fame for a composer. For, as has been said,\r\nwhile a modern composer writes two or three different operas,\r\nHasse wrote one hundred versions of one. This also had its\r\neffect on instrumental music, and, in a way, is also the direct\r\ncause of that monstrosity known as \"variations\" (Haendel wrote\r\nsixty-six on one theme.) In our days we often hear the bitter\r\ncomplaint that opera singers are no longer what they used\r\nto be, and that the great art of singing has been lost. If\r\nwe look back to the period under consideration, we cannot\r\nbut admit that there is much truth in the contention. In the\r\nfirst place, an opera singer of those days was necessarily\r\nan actor of great resource, a thorough musician, a composer,\r\nand a marvellous technician. In addition to this, operas were\r\nalways written for individuals. Thus, all of Hasse's were\r\ndesigned for Faustina's voice; and by examining the music,\r\nwe can tell exactly what the good and bad points of her voice\r\nwere, such was the care with which it was written.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the subject of Hasse and his operas, I wish\r\nto refer briefly to a statement found in all histories and\r\nbooks on music. We find it stated that all this music was sung\r\nand played either loud or soft; with no gradual transitions\r\nfrom one to the other. The existence of that gradual swelling\r\nor diminishing of the tone in music which we call crescendo\r\nand diminuendo, is invariably denied, and its first use is\r\nattributed to Jommelli, director of the opera at Mannheim, in\r\n1760. Thus we are asked to believe that Faustina sang either\r\n_piano_ or _forte_, and still was an intensely dramatic singer.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me to require no comment; especially as, already\r\nin 1676, Matthew Locke, an English writer, uses the [<] sign\r\nfor the gradual transition from soft to loud. For obvious\r\nreasons there could be no such transition in harpsichord music,\r\nand this is why, when the same instrument was provided with\r\nhammers instead of quills, the name was changed to _pianoforte_,\r\nto indicate its power to modify the tone from soft to loud.\r\n\r\nNaturally Haendel, who was a man of despotic tendencies,\r\ncould not long submit to the caprices of opera singers.\r\nAfter innumerable conflicts with them, we find him turning\r\nback to one of the older forms of opera, the oratorio.\r\n\r\nBach never troubled himself about an art from which he was so\r\nwidely separated both by training and inclination. Thus the\r\nreformation of opera (I mean the old opera of which I have been\r\nspeaking) devolved upon Gluck. His early operas were entirely\r\non the lines of those of Hasse and Porpora. He wrote operas for\r\narchduchesses (\"Il Parnasso\" was played by four archduchesses\r\nand accompanied on harpsichord by the Archduke Leopold), and\r\nwas music master to Marie Antoinette at Vienna. It was owing\r\nto these powerful influences that his art principles had an\r\nopportunity to be so widely exploited. For these principles\r\nwere not new; they formed the basis of Peri's first attempt\r\nat opera in 1600, and had been recalled in vain by Marcello in\r\n1720. They were so simple that it seems almost childish to quote\r\nthem. They demanded merely that the music should always assist,\r\nbut never interfere with either the declamation or dramatic\r\naction of the story. Thus by Gluck's powerful influence with\r\nwhat may be termed the fashion of his day, he did much to\r\nrelegate to a place of minor importance the singer, who until\r\nthen had held undisputed sway. This being the case, the great\r\nart of singing, which had allowed the artist the full control\r\nand responsibility of opera, thus centering all upon the one\r\nindividuality, degenerated into the more subordinate role of\r\nfollowing the composer's directions.\r\n\r\nIt now became the duty of the composer to foresee every\r\ncontingency of his work, and it lay with him to give directions\r\nfor every detail of it. As a result, the singers, having\r\nno longer absolute control but still anxious to display\r\ntheir technical acquirements, gradually changed into that\r\nnow almost obsolete abomination, the \"Italian opera singer,\"\r\nan artist, who, shirking all responsibility for the music and\r\ndramatic action, neglected the composer so far as possible,\r\nand introduced vocal pyrotechnics wherever he or she dared--and\r\ntheir daring was great.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as Gluck was bringing in his reforms, songs\r\nwere gradually introduced into the _Schauspiel_ or drama, the\r\nill-fated brother of opera in Germany; and just as the grand\r\nopera reached its highest point with Gluck, so this species of\r\nmelodrama grew apace, until we see its culmination in Weber's\r\n\"Freischuetz.\"\r\n\r\nThe good results of Gluck's innovations and also, to a certain\r\ndegree, its discrepancies, may be plainly seen in Mozart's\r\noperas; for only too often in his operas Mozart was obliged to\r\nintroduce _fioriture_ of the poorest possible description in\r\nsituations where they were utterly out of place. This, however,\r\nmay not be entirely laid at the door of the exacting singer, for\r\nwe find these same _fioriture_ throughout his harpsichord music.\r\n\r\nWe may almost say that the union of drama and music was first\r\ndefinitely given status by Mozart; for a number of his operas,\r\nsuch as the \"Schauspieldirektor,\" etc., were merely a form of\r\nthe German _Singspiel_, which, as I have said, culminated in\r\n\"Freischuetz.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at the beginning of our century we find two art forms:\r\nFirst, grand opera of a strange nationality, and second, the\r\nsmall but rapidly developing form of comedy or drama with music.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how Wagner evolved his art theories from\r\nthis material, we must consider to some degree the general\r\nconditions of this period.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1853, Riehl wrote that Mendelssohn was the only\r\ncomposer who had the German public, whereas others had only\r\na small section of it. For example, Schumann, whose music he\r\ndid not like, was accepted as a new Messiah in the Elbe River\r\ndistrict; \"but who,\" he asks, \"knows anything about him in the\r\nsouth or west of Germany?\" And as for Richard Wagner, who, he\r\nsays, is a man of extravagant ideas and a kind of phenomenon\r\nof no consequence artistically, he asks, \"who really knows\r\nanything about him outside of the little party of fanatics\r\nwho profess to like his music (so-called)?\" Its only chance of\r\nbecoming known, he says, is in the public's curiosity to hear\r\nworks which are rarely given. This curiosity, he continues,\r\nwill be a much more potent factor in his chance of becoming\r\nknown than all his newspaper articles and the propaganda of\r\nhis friend, Franz Liszt.\r\n\r\nFor the German opera there were half a dozen\r\n_Boersenplaetze_--Berlin for the northwest, Hamburg for\r\nthe northeast, Frankfort for the southwest, Munich for the\r\nsoutheast. As Riehl says, a success in Frankfort meant a\r\nsuccess in all the Frankfort clay deposit and sandstone systems,\r\nbut in the chalk formation of Munich it stood no chance. Thus\r\nGermany had no musical centre. But after Meyerbeer found such\r\na centre in Paris, all other Germans, including Wagner, looked\r\nto Paris for fame.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, Vienna was the art centre;\r\nnevertheless Gluck had to go to Paris for recognition.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn only succeeded by his _Salonfaehigkeit_. Always\r\nrespectable in his forms, no one else could have made music\r\npopular among the cultured classes as could Mendelssohn. This\r\nalso had its danger; for if Mendelssohn had written an opera\r\n(the lack of which was so bewailed by the Philistines),\r\nit would have taken root all over Germany, and put Wagner\r\nback many years. At the death of Mendelssohn, the Philistines\r\nheralded the coming of a new German national school, founded on\r\nhis principles (formalism), one that would clarify the artistic\r\natmosphere of the turgid and anarchistic excesses of Wagner and\r\nBerlioz and their followers. These critics found already that\r\nBeethoven's melodies were too long and his instrumentation too\r\ninvolved. They declared that the further music departed from\r\nits natural simplicity the more involved its utterance became,\r\nthe less clear, and consequently the poorer it was. Music was\r\ncompared to architecture, and thus the more Greek it was, the\r\nbetter; forgetting that architecture was tied to utilitarianism\r\nand poetry to word-symbols, and that painting is primarily an\r\nart of externals.\r\n\r\nRiehl says that art is always in danger of ruin when its simple\r\nfoundation forms are too much elaborated, overlooking the fact\r\nthat music is not an art, but psychological utterance.\r\n\r\nIt needed all Wagner's gigantic personality to rise above this\r\nwave of formalism that looked to the past for its salvation,\r\na past which was one of childish experimenting rather than of\r\naesthetic accomplishment. The tendency was to return to the\r\ndark cave where tangible walls were to be touched by the hands,\r\nrather than to emerge into a sunlight that seemed blinding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nON THE LIVES AND ART PRINCIPLES OF SOME SEVENTEENTH AND\r\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY COMPOSERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is much of value to the student to be derived from a\r\nstudy of the lives and art principles of the composers of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. To go back to an earlier\r\nperiod would hardly be worth while, as the music composed in\r\nthose days is too much obscured by the uncertainty of tradition\r\nand the inevitable awkwardness of expression that goes with\r\nall primitiveness in art.\r\n\r\nThe first whom I would mention are Don Carlo Gesualdo, Prince\r\nof Venosa, and Ludovico Viadana.\r\n\r\nThe former was a nephew of the Archbishop of Naples, was born\r\nin 1550, and died in 1613. His name is important from the fact\r\nthat he went boldly beyond Monteverde, his contemporary, in the\r\nuse of the new dissonant chords (sevenths and ninths) which\r\nwere just beginning to be employed, and adopted a chromatic\r\nstyle of writing which strangely foreshadowed the chromatic\r\npolyphonic style of the present century. He wrote innumerable\r\nmadrigals for a number of voices, but his innovations remained\r\nsterile so far as the development of music is concerned, for\r\nthe reason that while his music often acquired a wonderful\r\npoignancy for his time by the use of chromatics, just as often\r\nit led him into the merest bramble bush of sound, real music\r\nbeing entirely absent.\r\n\r\nViadana (1566-1645) has been placed by many historians of\r\nmusic in the same category as Guido d'Arezzo (who is credited\r\nwith having invented solmization, musical notation, etc.),\r\nPalestrina, Monteverde and Peri, who are famed, the one for\r\nhaving discovered the dominant ninth chord, and the other\r\nfor the invention of opera. Viadana is said to have been the\r\nfirst to use what is called a _basso continuo_, and even the\r\nfigured bass. The former was the uninterrupted repetition of\r\na short melody or phrase in the bass through the entire course\r\nof a piece of music. This was done very often to give a sense\r\nof unity that nowadays would be obtained by a repetition of\r\nthe first thought at certain intervals through the piece. The\r\nfigured (or better, ciphered) bass was an entirely different\r\nthing. This device, which is still employed, consisted of\r\nthe use of figures to indicate the different chords in music.\r\nThese figures or ciphers were written over or under the bass\r\nnote on which the chord represented by the figures was to be\r\nplayed or sung. A 5 over or under a bass note meant that with\r\nthat note a perfect major triad was to be sounded, considering\r\nthe note written as the root of the chord; a 3 was taken to\r\nstand for a perfect minor triad; a 6 for the chord of the sixth\r\n(first inversion of a triad), and 6/4 for the second inversion;\r\na line through a 5 or 7 meant that the triad was a diminished\r\nfifth or a diminished seventh chord; a cross indicated a leading\r\ntone; a 4 stood for the third inversion of the dominant seventh\r\nchord. This system of shorthand, as it may be called, was and\r\nis still of tremendous value to composers. In the olden days,\r\nparticularly, when many of the composers engraved their own\r\nmusic for publication, it saved a great deal of labour. It is\r\nprobably not generally known that the engraving of music by\r\nthe composer was so common; but such was the case with Bach,\r\nRameau, and Couperin.\r\n\r\nAnd this reminds me that the embellishments, as they were\r\ncalled, which are so common in all harpsichord and clavichord\r\nmusic, were also noted in a kind of shorthand, and for precisely\r\nthe same reason. The embellishments themselves originated\r\nfrom the necessity for sustaining in some way the tone of\r\nthe instrument, which gave out little, dry, clicklike sounds;\r\nif the melody were played in simple notes, these sounds would\r\nmingle with the accompaniment and be lost in it. Therefore,\r\nthe embellishments served to sustain the tones of the melody,\r\nand thus cause them to stand out from the accompaniment. Their\r\nnotation by means of symbols copied from the primitive _neumes_\r\nvastly facilitated the work of engraving. Much confusion arose\r\nin the notation of embellishments, owing to the fact that each\r\ncomposer had his own system of symbols.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti and his son Domenico, both celebrated in\r\ntheir day, are the next to demand attention. The former was\r\nborn about 1650 and died about 1725. He wrote many operas of\r\nwhich we know practically nothing. His son was born about 1685\r\nand died in 1757. He was the most celebrated harpsichord player\r\nof his time; and although his style, which was essentially one\r\nof virtuosity, was not productive of direct results, it did\r\nnevertheless foreshadow the wonderful technical achievements\r\nof Liszt in our own times. It is indeed a great pity that\r\nDomenico Scarlatti's work did not bear more direct fruit in his\r\nday, for it would have turned Mozart, as well as many others,\r\nfrom the loose, clumsy mannerisms of the later virtuoso style,\r\nwhich ran to the Alberti bass and other degrading platitudes,\r\nparalleled in our comparatively modern days by the Thalberg\r\narpeggios, repeating notes, Doehler trill, etc.\r\n\r\nTwo masters in music, Haendel and J.S. Bach, were born the\r\nsame year, 1685; their great French contemporary, Rameau,\r\nwas born two years earlier and died in 1764; while Haendel\r\ndied in 1759, and Bach in 1750. Bach was destined to give\r\nto the world its first glimpse of the tremendous power of\r\nmusic, while Rameau organized the elements of music into a\r\nscientific harmonic structure, laying the foundation for our\r\nmodern harmony. Haendel's great achievement (besides being a\r\nfine composer) was to crush all life out of the then promising\r\nschool of English music, the foundation for which had been so\r\nwell laid by Purcell, Byrd, Morley, etc.\r\n\r\nJean Philippe Rameau was born in Dijon, and after travels in\r\nItaly and a short period of service as organist at Clermont,\r\nin Auvergne, went to Paris. There he wrote a number of small\r\nvaudevilles or musical comedies, which were successful; and\r\nhis music for the harpsichord, consisting almost exclusively\r\nof small pieces with descriptive titles, soon began to be\r\nwidely played in France. Much later in life he succeeded\r\nin obtaining a hearing for his operas, the first of which,\r\n\"Hippolyte et Aricie,\" was given in 1732, when he was fifty\r\nyears old. For thirty-two years his operas continued to hold\r\nthe French stage against those of all foreigners.\r\n\r\nHis style marked a great advance over that of Lully, the\r\nItalian, of the century before. Rameau aimed at clearness\r\nof diction and was one of the first to attempt to give\r\nindividuality to the different orchestral instruments. By\r\nsome strange coincidence, his first opera had much the same\r\ndramatic situation that all the early operas seemed to have,\r\nnamely, a scene in the infernal regions. Rameau's operas\r\nnever became the foundation for a distinctly French opera,\r\nfor at the time of his death (1764), Italian opera troupes had\r\nalready introduced a kind of comedy with music, which rapidly\r\ndeveloped into opera comique; it was reserved for Gluck,\r\nthe German, to revive grand opera in France.\r\n\r\nAs a theoretician, Rameau exerted tremendous influence upon\r\nmusic. He discovered that the chord which we call the perfect\r\nmajor triad was not merely the result of an artificial training\r\nof the ear to like certain combinations of sounds, but that\r\nthis chord was inherent in every musical sound, constituting,\r\nas it does, the first four harmonics or overtones. All chords,\r\ntherefore, that were not composed of thirds placed one above\r\nthe other, were inversions of fundamental chords. This theory\r\nholds good in the general harmonic system of to-day. But\r\nalthough the major triad and even the dominant seventh chord\r\ncould be traced back to the harmonics, the minor triad proved\r\na different matter; after many experiments Rameau gave it up,\r\nleaving it unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nRameau was also largely instrumental in gaining recognition for\r\nthe desirability of dividing the octave into twelve equal parts,\r\nmaking all the so-called half-tones recur at mathematically\r\nequal distances from each other in the chromatic scale. In\r\n1737 his work on the generation of chords through overtones\r\ncaused the equal temperament system of tuning to be generally\r\naccepted, and the old modes, with the exception of the Ionian\r\nand Aeolian, to be dropped out of use. The former became known\r\nas major and the latter as minor, from the third, which was\r\nlarge in the Ionian and small in the Aeolian.\r\n\r\nHaendel, as before stated, was born in 1685 (February 23), in\r\nHalle, in the same year as J.S. Bach, who was a month younger\r\n(born March 21). His father was a barber, who, as was common\r\nin those days, combined the trade of surgery, cupping, etc.,\r\nwith that of hairdressing. He naturally opposed his son's\r\nbent toward music, but with no effect. At fifteen years of\r\nage, Haendel was beginning to be well known as a clavichord\r\nand organ player, in the latter capacity becoming specially\r\ncelebrated for his wonderful improvisations. In spite of an\r\nattempt to make a lawyer of him, he persisted in taking music\r\nas his vocation, after the death of his father.\r\n\r\nIn Hamburg, whither he went in 1703, he obtained a place among\r\nthe second violins in the opera orchestra.[15] Realizing that\r\nin Germany opera was but a reflection of Italian art, he left\r\nHamburg in 1707 and went to Italy, where he soon began to make\r\na name for himself, both as performer and composer. One of his\r\noperas, \"Agrippa,\" was performed at Venice during the Carnival\r\nseason of 1710.\r\n\r\nThe Hanoverian kapellmeister, Staffani, was present and invited\r\nhim to Hanover, whither he went, becoming Staffani's successor\r\nin the service of the Elector of Hanover. Several trips to\r\nEngland, where he was warmly welcomed, resulted in his accepting\r\nfrom Queen Anne, in 1713, a salary of two hundred pounds yearly,\r\nthus entering her service, notwithstanding his contract with\r\nthe Elector. In 1714 the Queen died, and the Elector of\r\nHanover was called to the English throne under the title of\r\nGeorge I. Haendel, in order to escape the impending disgrace\r\noccasioned by having broken faith with his former employer,\r\nwrote some music intended to be particularly persuasive, and\r\nhad it played on a barge that followed a royal procession up\r\nthe Thames. This \"Water Music,\" as it was called, procured\r\nfor him the King's pardon.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he lived in England, practically monopolizing\r\nall that was done in music. In 1720 a company for the giving\r\nof Italian opera was formed, and Haendel placed at its head. In\r\n1727, on the occasion of the accession of George II, Haendel\r\nwrote four anthems, one of which \"Zadok the Priest,\" ends\r\nwith the words \"God save the King,\" from which it has been\r\nerroneously stated that he wrote the English national hymn.\r\n\r\nIn 1737 Haendel gave up the writing of operas, after sinking\r\nmost of his own savings in the undertaking, and began to write\r\noratorios, the germs of which are found in the old Mysteries and\r\nPassion plays performed on a platform erected in the chapel or\r\noratory of a church. Much has been written about Haendel's habit\r\nof taking themes from other composers, and he was even dubbed\r\nthe \"grand old robber.\" It must not be overlooked, however,\r\nthat although he made use of ideas from other composers, he\r\nturned them to the best account. By 1742 Haendel was again in\r\nprosperous circumstances, his \"Messiah\" having been a tremendous\r\nsuccess. From that time until his death he held undisputed sway,\r\nalthough his last years were clouded by a trouble with his eyes,\r\nwhich were operated upon unsuccessfully by an English oculist,\r\nnamed Taylor, who had also operated on Bach's eyes with the\r\nsame disastrous result. Haendel became completely blind in\r\n1752. Up to the last year of his life he continued to give\r\noratorio concerts and played organ concertos, of which only\r\nthe _tutti_ were noted, he improvising his part.\r\n\r\nHaendel's strength lay in his great ability to produce\r\noverwhelming effects by comparatively simple means. This is\r\nespecially the case in his great choruses which are massive\r\nin effect and yet simple to the verge of barrenness. This,\r\nof course, has no reference to the absurd _fioriture_ and\r\nlong passage work given to the voices,--an Italian fashion of\r\nthe times,--but to the contrapuntal texture of the work. Of\r\nhis oratorios, \"The Messiah\" is the best known. Two of his\r\n\"Concerti Grossi,\" the third and sixth, are sometimes played\r\nby string orchestras. Of his harpsichord music we have the\r\neight \"Suites\" of 1720 (among which the one in E is known as\r\nhaving the variations called \"The Harmonious Blacksmith\"),\r\nand a number of \"Harpsichord Lessons,\" among which are six\r\nfugues. All these may be said to have little value.\r\n\r\nJ.S. Bach differed in almost every respect from Haendel,\r\nexcept that he was born in the same year and was killed by\r\nthe same doctor. While Haendel left no pupils, with perhaps\r\nthe exception of his assistant organist, Bach aided and taught\r\nhis own celebrated sons, Krebs, Agricola, Kittel, Kirnberger,\r\nMarpurg, and many other distinguished musicians. Bach twice made\r\nan effort to see Haendel at Halle, but without success. On the\r\nother hand, there are reasons for believing that Haendel never\r\ntook the trouble to examine any of Bach's clavichord music. He\r\nlived like a conqueror in a foreign land, writing operas,\r\noratorios, and concertos to order, and stealing ideas right and\r\nleft without compunction; whereas Bach wrote from conviction,\r\nand no charge of plagiarism was ever laid at his door. Haendel\r\nleft a great fortune of twenty thousand pounds. Bach's small\r\nsalary at the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig made it necessary\r\nfor him to do much of his own engraving; and at his death,\r\nthough he had helped many young struggling artists, his\r\nwidow was left so poor that she had to be supported by public\r\nbenevolence. Bach's works were neglected by his contemporaries,\r\nand it was only in the nineteenth century that he began to be\r\nappreciated in a way commensurate with his worth.\r\n\r\nBach was born in Eisenach, in Thuringia, and it is of\r\ninterest to know that as far back as his great grandfather,\r\nVeit Bach (born about 1550), music had been the profession\r\nof the family. Bach's parents died when he was a boy of ten,\r\nand his education was continued by his elder brother, Johann\r\nChristoph, at a town near Gotha, where he held a position as\r\norganist. The boy soon outstripped his brother in learning,\r\nand continued his studies wholly by himself.\r\n\r\nAfter filling a position as organist at Weimar, in 1703 he\r\naccepted one at a small town, Arnstadt, at a salary of about\r\nfifty-seven dollars yearly. He had already begun to compose,\r\nand possibly in imitation of Kuhnau, whose so-called \"Bible\"\r\nsonatas were at the time being talked about, he wrote an\r\nelaborate clavichord piece to illustrate the departure of his\r\nbrother, Johann Jakob, who had entered the service of Charles\r\nXII of Sweden as oboist. This composition is divided into five\r\nparts, each bearing an appropriate superscription and ending\r\nwith an elaborate fugue to illustrate the postillion's horn. I\r\nbelieve this is the only instance of his having written actual\r\nprogramme music. After leaving Arnstadt he filled positions as\r\norganist at Muehlhausen, Weimar, Coethen, etc. It was before\r\n1720 that he paid his two visits to Halle in the hope of\r\nseeing Haendel. At this time he had already written the first\r\npart of the \"Wohltemperierte Clavier,\" the violin sonatas,\r\nand many other great works. Ten years later, when Haendel again\r\ncame to Germany, Bach was too ill to go to see him personally,\r\nbut sent his eldest son to invite Haendel to come and see him,\r\nalthough without success.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 he obtained the position of Cantor at the St.\r\nThomas School, in Leipzig, left vacant by the death of Kuhnau;\r\nhere he remained until his death. In 1749 the English oculist,\r\nTaylor, happened to be in Leipzig. On the advice of friends,\r\nBach submitted to an operation on his eyes, which had always\r\ntroubled him. The failure of this operation rendered him\r\ntotally blind and the accompanying medical treatment completely\r\nbroke him down. On the eighteenth of July, 1750, he suddenly\r\nregained his sight, but it was accompanied by a stroke of\r\nparalysis from which he died ten days later.\r\n\r\nSo far as his church music is concerned, Bach may be considered\r\nas the Protestant compeer of the Roman Catholic, Palestrina,\r\nwith the difference that his music was based on the tonalities\r\nof major and minor and that his harmonic structure was founded\r\non a scientific basis. What is mere wandering in Palestrina,\r\nwith Bach is moving steadily forward with a well-defined object\r\nin view. With Bach, music is cast in the definite mould of\r\ntonality, while with Palestrina the vagueness of the modes lends\r\nto his music something of mystery and a certain supernatural\r\nfreedom from _human will_, so prominent a characteristic\r\nof Bach's compositions. In considering Bach's music we must\r\nforget the technique, which was merely the outside dress of\r\nhis compositions. His style was the one of the period, just as\r\nhe wore a wig, and buckles on his shoes. His music must not be\r\nconfounded with the contrapuntal style of his utterance, and\r\nalthough he has never been surpassed as a scientific writer\r\nof counterpoint, it would be unjust to look there for his\r\nchief glory. As a matter of fact, when his scientific speech\r\nthreatened to clash with the musical idea in his composition,\r\nhe never hesitated to sacrifice the former to the latter. Thus\r\nBach may be considered the greatest musical scientist of his\r\ntime as well as the greatest breaker of mere rules.\r\n\r\nOf his sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel is the most celebrated,\r\nand did much to prepare the way for Haydn in the development\r\nof the sonata. J.S. Bach wrote many sonatas, but none for the\r\nclavichord; his sonatas were for the violin and the 'cello\r\nalone, a great innovation. The violin sonatas bring into\r\nplay all the resources of the instrument; indeed it is barely\r\npossible to do them justice from the technical standpoint. His\r\n\"Wohltemperierte Clavier\" naturally was a tremendous help to\r\nclavichord technique, and even now the \"Chromatic Fantaisie\"\r\nand other works require fine pianists to perform them properly.\r\n\r\nIn considering the development of music, it must always be\r\nremembered that Haydn, Mozart, and their contemporaries knew\r\nlittle or nothing of Bach's works, thus accounting for what\r\notherwise would seem a retrograde movement in art. C.P.E. Bach\r\n(born 1714) was much better known than his father; even Mozart\r\nsaid of him, \"He is the father, and we are mere children.\" He\r\nwas renowned as a harpsichord player, and wrote many sonatas\r\nwhich form the connecting link between the suite and the\r\nsonata. He threw aside the polyphonic style of his father\r\nand strove to give his music new colour and warmth by means\r\nof harmony and modulation. He died in 1788 in Hamburg, where\r\nhe was conductor of the opera. It should be mentioned that he\r\nwrote a method of clavichord playing on which, in later days,\r\nCzerny said that Beethoven based his piano teaching.\r\n\r\nUp to the period now under consideration, music for the\r\norchestra occupied a very small part in the composer's work. To\r\nbe sure, J.S. Bach wrote some suites, and separate movements\r\nwere written in the different dance forms for violins, with\r\nsometimes the addition of a few reed instruments, and possibly\r\nflutes and small horns or trumpets. It is in the works of\r\nC.P.E. Bach, however, that we find the germ of symphonic\r\norchestral writing that was to be developed by Haydn, Mozart,\r\nand Beethoven. The so-called \"symphonies\" by Emanuel Bach are\r\nmerely rudimentary sonatas written for strings, with flutes,\r\noboes, bassoons, trumpets, etc., and have practically no\r\nartistic significance except as showing the inevitable trend of\r\nmusical thought toward greater power of expression. In Germany\r\n(and indeed everywhere else) the Italian element had full sway\r\nover opera, and non-Italian musicians were forced into writing\r\nfor the concert room instead of the stage. Even Beethoven had\r\nmany disappointments in connection with his one opera \"Fidelio,\"\r\nand so strong was the Italian influence, that here in America\r\nwe are only just now (1897) recovering from the effects of it.\r\n\r\nFranz Joseph Haydn was born near Vienna, in 1732, of humble\r\nparents, his mother a cook in a count's family, and his father\r\na wheelwright and sexton of the parish church. When a young boy\r\nHaydn had a fine voice, on account of which he was admitted as a\r\nmember of the choir at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. This\r\nentitled him to admission to St. Stephen's School, connected\r\nwith the cathedral, in which the city paid for the board and\r\nlodging as well as the instruction of the singers. When the\r\nboys' voices changed or \"broke,\" however, they were turned\r\nadrift. On leaving the cathedral, Haydn suffered the direst\r\npoverty, engaging himself at one time as valet to the Italian\r\nsinging teacher, Porpora, in order to secure some lessons.\r\n\r\nHe gradually managed to make himself known, and was engaged\r\nby Count Morzin, a rich nobleman, to organize an orchestra of\r\nabout eighteen, which the count retained in his service with\r\nHaydn as leader. Here he wrote his first symphony (for strings,\r\ntwo oboes and two horns, in three movements) and a number of\r\nsmaller works. When he was twenty-nine, Count Morzin gave up\r\nhis establishment and Haydn entered the service of Prince Paul\r\nEsterhazy, in Eisenstadt, Hungary, in the same capacity. Here\r\nhe had an orchestra of sixteen, composed of good musicians, whom\r\nhe could call up at any hour of the night to play if he wished,\r\nand over whom he had complete control. Although the contract\r\nby which he was engaged names the most degrading conditions,\r\nand places Haydn on a par with all the other servants, the pay,\r\nthough small (two hundred dollars yearly), was certain and\r\nregular. From this time Haydn was free from the hardships of\r\npoverty. His salary was soon increased to five hundred dollars,\r\nand he made as much more from his compositions. He wrote over\r\none hundred and twenty-five symphonies, sixty-eight trios,\r\nseventy-seven quartets, fifty-seven concertos, fifty-seven\r\nsonatas, eight oratorios and cantatas, and nineteen operas,\r\nbesides innumerable smaller things, for instance, between five\r\nhundred and six hundred vocal pieces. His operas, of course,\r\nare mere trifles compared with our more modern ones.\r\n\r\nHis friendship for Mozart is well known. As for his relations\r\nwith Beethoven, it is probable that their disagreement was\r\nmerely the effect of pride, and perhaps a certain amount\r\nof laziness on one side and youthful bumptiousness on the\r\nother. Haydn was returning to Vienna _via_ Bonn, from England,\r\nwhere he had been welcomed by the wildest enthusiasm, when\r\nBeethoven called on him to ask for his opinion as to his talent\r\nas a composer. It resulted in Beethoven's going to Vienna.\r\nAfter taking a few lessons of Haydn he went to another teacher\r\nand made all manner of contemptuous remarks about Haydn,\r\ndeclaring he had not learned anything from him.\r\n\r\nAfter two highly successful visits to England, in 1792 and 1794,\r\nHaydn returned to Vienna and wrote his two celebrated cantatas,\r\n\"The Creation\" and \"The Seasons.\" His last appearance in public\r\nwas when he attended a performance of \"The Creation\" in 1808,\r\nat the age of seventy-six. He was received with a fanfare of\r\ntrumpets and cheers from the audience. After the first part he\r\nwas obliged to leave, and as he was being carried out by his\r\nfriends, he turned at the door and lifted his hands towards the\r\norchestra, as if in benediction; Beethoven kissed his hand,\r\nand everyone paid him homage. He died during the bombardment\r\nof Vienna by the French, May 31, 1809.\r\n\r\nHaydn's later symphonies have been very cleverly compared\r\nwith those of Beethoven by the statement that the latter wrote\r\ntragedies and great dramas, whereas Haydn wrote comedies and\r\ncharming farces. As a matter of fact, Haydn is the bridge\r\nbetween the idealized dance and independent music. Although\r\nBeethoven still retained the form of the dance, he wrote great\r\npoems, whereas the music of Haydn always preserves a tinge of\r\nthe actual dance. With Haydn, music was still an art consisting\r\nof the weaving together of pretty sounds, and although _design_,\r\nthat is to say, the development of the emotional character\r\nof a musical thought, was by no means unknown to him, that\r\ndevelopment was never permitted to transcend the limits of a\r\ncertain graceful euphony which was a marked characteristic\r\nof his style. His use of orchestral instruments represents\r\na marked advance on that of C.P.E. Bach, and certainly very\r\nmaterially helped Mozart.\r\n\r\nOf Mozart we probably all know something. Born at Salzburg,\r\nin 1756, his was a short life, for he died in 1791. We know\r\nof his great precocity; his first compositions were published\r\nwhen he was six years old, at which age he was already playing\r\nin concerts with his eleven-year old sister, and was made much\r\nof by the titled people before whom he played. The rest of\r\nhis life is one continual chronicle of concerts given all over\r\nEurope, interrupted at intervals by scarlet fever, smallpox,\r\nand other illnesses, until the last one, typhoid fever, caused\r\nhis death. During his stay in Italy he wrote many operas in\r\nthe flowery Italian style which, luckily, have never been\r\nrevived to tarnish his name.\r\n\r\nHis first works worthy of mention are the clavier concertos and\r\nseveral symphonies and quartets, which date from about 1777. His\r\nfirst important opera is \"Idomeneo, King of Crete,\" written for\r\nthe Munich opera. In this he adopts the principles of Gluck,\r\nthus breaking away from the wretched style of the Italian\r\nopera of the period, although the work itself was written in\r\nItalian. His next opera was in German, \"Die Entfuehrung aus\r\ndem Serail,\" and was given with great success at Vienna, in\r\n1782. It was followed by \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" \"Don Juan,\"\r\nand the \"Magic Flute.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of his death is well known. A stranger, who turned\r\nout to be the steward of Count Walsegg, came to him and\r\nordered a requiem, which was played in 1793 as Walsegg's own\r\ncomposition. Mozart thought the man a messenger from the other\r\nworld. He died before he completed the work. So great was his\r\npoverty that it was difficult to get a priest to attend him,\r\nand a physician who was summoned would come only after the play\r\nhe was attending was ended. He had a \"third class\" funeral,\r\nand as a fierce storm was raging, no one accompanied the body\r\nto the grave. His widow gave a concert, and with the help of the\r\nEmperor money enough was raised to pay the outstanding debts.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give an adequate idea of Mozart's works. He\r\npossessed a certain simple charm of expression which,\r\nin its directness, has an element of pathos lacking in the\r\ncomparatively jolly light-heartedness of Haydn. German opera\r\nprofited much from his practically adopting the art principles\r\nof Gluck, although it must be confessed that this change in\r\nstyle may have been simply a phase of his own individual art\r\ndevelopment. His later symphonies and operas show us the man\r\nat his best. His piano works and early operas show the effect\r\nof the \"virtuoso\" style, with all its empty concessions to\r\ntechnical display and commonplace, ear-catching melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] At that time the harpsichord player was a very important\r\n     member of an orchestra, as he accompanied the recitative\r\n     from figured bass and was practically the conductor. On\r\n     one occasion when the harpsichordist was absent Haendel\r\n     took his place with so much success that it paved the\r\n     way for a hearing of his operas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nDECLAMATION IN MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one side of music which I am convinced has never\r\nbeen fully studied, namely, the relation between it and\r\ndeclamation. As we know, music is a language which may delineate\r\nactual occurrences by means of onomatopoetic sounds. By the\r\nuse of more or less suggestive sounds, it may bring before\r\nour minds a quasi-visual image of things which we more or less\r\ndefinitely feel.\r\n\r\nNow to do all this, there must be rules; or, to put it more\r\nbroadly, there must be some innate quality that enables\r\nthis art of sounds to move in sympathy with our feelings.\r\nI have no wish to go into detailed analysis of the subject;\r\nbut a superficial survey of it may clear up certain points with\r\nregard to the potency of music that we are too often willing\r\nto refer back to the mere pleasing physical sensations of sound.\r\n\r\nSome consideration of this subject may enable us to understand\r\nthe much discussed question of programme music. It may also help\r\nus to recognize the astonishing advance we have made in the art;\r\nan advance, which, strange to say, consists in successively\r\nthrowing off all the trammels and conventionalities of what is\r\ngenerally considered artificial, and the striking development\r\nof an art which, with all its astounding wealth of exterior\r\nmeans, aims at the expression of elemental sensations.\r\n\r\nMusic may be divided into four classes, each class marking\r\nan advance in receptive power on the part of the listener and\r\npoetic subtlety on that of the composer. We may liken the first\r\nstage to that of the savage Indians who depict their exploits\r\nin war and peace on the rocks, fragments of bone, etc. If the\r\npainter has in mind, say, an elephant, he carves it so that its\r\nprincipal characteristics are vastly exaggerated. A god in such\r\ndelineation is twice the size of the ordinary man, and so it is\r\nin descriptive music. For instance, in Beethoven's \"Pastoral\"\r\nsymphony, the cuckoo is not a bird which mysteriously hides\r\nitself far away in a thicket, the sound of whose voice comes to\r\none like a strange, abrupt call from the darkness of the forest;\r\nno, it is unmistakably a cuckoo, reminding one strangely of\r\nthose equally advanced and extremely cheap art products of\r\nNuremberg, made of pine wood, and furnished with a movable tail.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is still a question of delineation; but\r\nof delineation that leads us into strange countries, and\r\nthe sounds we hear are but the small door through which we\r\npass. This music _suggests_; by way of example, the opening of\r\nthe last movement of the \"Pastoral\" symphony, the march from\r\nTchaikovsky's \"Symphonie Pathetique,\" the opening of Raff's\r\n\"Im Walde,\" and Goldmark's \"Sakuntala.\" Such music hints,\r\nand there is a certain potency in its suggestion which makes\r\nus see things. These two divisions of music have been termed\r\n\"programme\" or \"objective\" music.\r\n\r\nThe other two classes of music have been termed subjective.\r\nThe first is declamation, pure and simple; the singer may be\r\ntelling a lie, or his sentiment may be insincere or false; what\r\nthese sounds stand for, we know from the words, their grade of\r\npassion, etc. The last phase of our art is much more subtle,\r\nand is not amenable to such accurate analysis. If we may liken\r\nmusic to painting, we may, I think, compare the latter to the\r\nfirst three stages of this new language of music; but it can\r\ngo no further. For that art must touch its audience through\r\na palpable delineation of something more or less material;\r\nwhereas music is of the stuff dreams are made of. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say, however, that our dreams are often much more\r\npoignant than the actual sensations caused by real occurrences\r\nwould be. And it is because of this strange quality, I think,\r\nthat dreams and music affect us in much the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe vital principle of Wagner's art was that he not only made\r\nstartlingly vivid pictures in his music, but that he made the\r\npeople in these pictures actually walk out of the frame and\r\ndirectly address the audience. In other words, his orchestra\r\nforms a kind of pictorial and psychological background from\r\nwhich his characters detach themselves and actually speak. If\r\nthey speak falsely, the ever present orchestra, forming as it\r\nwere a halo, unmercifully tears away the mask, like the mirror\r\nin old fairy tales.\r\n\r\nIn Wagner's operas, however, the intrusion of gross palpable\r\nmachinery of the stage, as well as that of the actor's art,\r\ntoo often clouds the perfect working of this wonderful art\r\nconception. It is just this intrusion of materialism in Wagner's\r\nmusic dramas which constitutes their only weakness.\r\n\r\nAt this point I wish to insist upon the fact that in music it\r\nis always through declamation that the public is addressed most\r\ndirectly; not only that, but declamation is not necessarily tied\r\nby any of the fetters of the spoken word; nor is it subservient\r\nto any of the laws of articulate speech as we meet with them in\r\nlanguage. This being admitted, I have no hesitation in giving\r\nmy opinion that opera, or rather the music drama, is not the\r\nhighest or the most perfect form of our art. The music drama\r\nas represented by Wagner (and he alone represents it) is the\r\nmost perfect union of painting, poetry, and music imaginable to\r\nour nineteenth-century minds. But as regards representing the\r\nhighest development of music, I find it too much hampered by\r\nthe externals of art, necessary materialism in the production\r\nof palpable acts, and its enforced subjection to the laws that\r\ngovern the spoken word.\r\n\r\nMusic is universal; Wagner's operas, by the inherent necessities\r\nof speech, are necessarily and irrevocably Germanic. \"Les\r\nMaitres Chanteurs,\" \"The Dwarfs of Niebelheim,\" \"Elizabeta,\"\r\nare impossibilities, whereas, for instance, Beethoven's \"Eroica\"\r\nlabours under no such disadvantage. \"Goodbye, My Dearest Swan,\"\r\ninvests part of \"Lohengrin\" with a certain grotesque colour\r\nthat no one would ever dream of if there were no necessity for\r\nthe singer to be tied down to the exigencies of palpable and\r\ncertainly most materialistic language. The thought in itself\r\nis beautiful, but the necessity for the words drags it into\r\nthe mud.\r\n\r\nThis certainly shows the difference between the language of\r\nmusic and what is called articulate speech, the purely symbolic\r\nand artificial character of the latter, and the direct,\r\nunhampered utterance of the former. Music can invariably\r\nheighten the poignancy of mere spoken words (which mean\r\nnothing in themselves), but words can but rarely, in fact I\r\ndoubt whether they can ever, heighten the effect of musical\r\ndeclamation. To my mind, listening to Wagner's operas may be\r\nlikened to watching a circus with three rings. That containing\r\nthe music should have our closest attention, for it offers\r\nthe most wonderful sounds ever imagined by any man. At the\r\nsame time it is impossible for any human being not to have his\r\nattention often lured away to the other rings, in one of which\r\nFricke's rams vie with the bird and the dragon; or where the\r\nphantom ship seems as firmly fixed as the practical rainbow,\r\nwhich so closely betrays the carpenter. In the other ring you\r\ncan actually hear the dull jokes of Mimi and the Wanderer,\r\nor hear Walther explain that he has passed a comfortable night\r\nand slept well.\r\n\r\nThe music to these remarkable scenes, however, does not deign\r\nto stoop so low, but soars in wonderful poetry by itself, thus\r\nrejecting a union which, to speak in the jargon of our day, is\r\none of the convincing symptoms of decadence; in other words,\r\nit springs from the same impulse as that which has produced\r\nthe circus with three rings.\r\n\r\nSumming up, I wish to state what I consider the four elements\r\nof music, namely, music that paints, music that suggests, music\r\nthat actually speaks, and music that almost defies analysis,\r\nand is composed of the other three elements.\r\n\r\nWhen we were considering the early works for harpsichord, I said\r\nthat music could define certain things with quite reasonable\r\nexactitude. Just as in the Egyptian hieroglyphics a wavy line\r\nstands for water, so it can in music, with the latitude that\r\nit can mean anything in nature that we might consider of the\r\nsame genre. Thus, the figure in Wagner's \"Waldweben\" means in\r\nthat instance waves of air, and we know it by the context.\r\nHis swaying figure of the \"Prelude to Rheingold\" is as\r\nplainly water as is the same figure used by Mendelssohn in his\r\n\"Lovely Melusina.\" Not that Wagner plagiarized, but that he and\r\nMendelssohn recognized the definiteness of musical suggestions;\r\nwhich is more than proved by their adopting the same musical\r\nideas to indicate the same things.\r\n\r\nMore indefinite is the analysis of our second type or element\r\nof music. The successful recognition of this depends not only\r\nupon the susceptibility of the hearer to delicate shades of\r\nsensation, but also upon the receptivity of the hearer and his\r\npower to accept freely and unrestrictedly the mood shadowed\r\nforth by the composer. Such music cannot be looked upon\r\nobjectively. To those who would analyze it in such a manner it\r\nmust remain an unknown language; its potency depends entirely\r\nupon a state of willing subjectivity on the part of the hearer.\r\n\r\nThe third element, as we know, consists of the spoken word or\r\nphrase; in other words, declamation. In this, however, the\r\ncomposer cuts loose entirely from what we call language. It\r\nis the medium of expression of emotion of every kind. It is\r\nnot restricted to the voice or to any instrument, or even to\r\nour sharps, flats, and naturals. Through stress of emotion the\r\nsharps become sharper, with depression the flats become flatter,\r\nthus adding poignancy to the declamation. Being unfettered by\r\nwords, this emotion has free rein. The last element, as I have\r\nsaid, is extremely difficult to define. It is declamation that\r\nsuggests and paints at the same time. We find hardly a bar\r\nof Wagner's music in which this complex form of music is not\r\npresent. Thus, the music dramas of Wagner, shorn of the fetters\r\nof the actual spoken word, emancipated from the materialism\r\nof acting, painting, and furniture, may be considered as the\r\ngreatest achievement in our art, an art that does not include\r\nthe spoken word called poetry, or painting, or sculpture,\r\nand most decidedly not architecture (form), but the essence\r\nof all these. What these aim to do through passive exterior\r\ninfluences, music accomplishes by actual living vibration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION IN MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the power of suggestion in music I wish at\r\nthe outset to make certain reservations. In the first place\r\nI speak for myself, and what I have to present is merely an\r\nexpression of my personal opinion; if in any way these should\r\nincite to further investigation or discussion, my object will\r\nin part have been attained.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, in speaking of this art, one is\r\nseriously hampered by a certain difficulty in making oneself\r\nunderstood. To hear and to enjoy music seems sufficient to\r\nmany persons, and an investigation as to the causes of this\r\nenjoyment seems to them superfluous. And yet, unless the\r\npublic comes into closer touch with the tone poet than that\r\nobjective state Which accepts with the ears what is intended\r\nfor the spirit, which hears the sounds and is deaf to their\r\nimport, unless the public can separate the physical pleasure\r\nof music from its ideal significance, our art, in my opinion,\r\ncannot stand on a sound basis.\r\n\r\nThe first step toward an appreciation of music should be\r\ntaken in our preparatory schools. Were young people taught\r\nto distinguish between tones as between colours, to recognize\r\nrhythmic values, and were they taught so to use their voices as\r\nto temper the nasal tones of speech, in after life they would\r\nbe better able to appreciate and cherish an art of which mere\r\npleasure-giving sounds are but a very small part.\r\n\r\nMuch of the lack of independence of opinion about music arises\r\nfrom want of familiarity with its material. Thus, after dinner,\r\nour forefathers were accustomed to sing catches which were\r\nentirely destitute of anything approaching music.\r\n\r\nMusic contains certain elements which affect the nerves of\r\nthe mind and body, and thus possesses the power of direct\r\nappeal to the public,--a power to a great extent denied to the\r\nother arts. This sensuous influence over the hearer is often\r\nmistaken for the aim and end of all music. With this in mind,\r\none may forgive the rather puzzling remarks so often met with;\r\nfor instance, those of a certain English bishop that \"Music\r\ndid not affect him either intellectually or emotionally,\r\nonly pleasurably,\" adding, \"Every art should keep within\r\nits own realm; and that of music was concerned with pleasing\r\ncombinations of sound.\" In declaring that the sensation of\r\nhearing music was pleasant to him, and that to produce that\r\nsensation was the entire mission of music, the Bishop placed\r\nour art on a level with good things to eat and drink. Many\r\ncolleges and universities of this land consider music as a\r\nkind of _boutonniere_.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of music is, I believe, unfortunately a very\r\ngeneral one, and yet, low as it is, there is a possibility\r\nof building on such a foundation. Could such persons be made\r\nto recognize the existence of decidedly unpleasant music,\r\nit would be the first step toward a proper appreciation of\r\nthe art and its various phases.\r\n\r\nMere beauty of sound is, in itself, purely sensuous. It is\r\nthe Chinese conception of music that the texture of a sound\r\nis to be valued; the long, trembling tone-tint of a bronze\r\ngong, or the high, thin streams of sound from the pipes are\r\nenjoyed for their ear-filling qualities. In the _Analects_ of\r\nConfucius and the writings of Mencius there is much mention\r\nof music, and \"harmony of sound that shall fill the ears\"\r\nis insisted upon. The Master said, \"When the music maker Che\r\nfirst entered on his office, the finish with the Kwan Ts'eu\r\nwas magnificent. How it filled the ears!\" Pere Amiot says,\r\n\"Music must fill the ears to penetrate the soul.\" Referring to\r\nthe playing of some pieces by Couperin on a spinet, he says that\r\nChinese hearers thought these pieces barbarous; the movement\r\nwas too rapid, and did not allow sufficient time for them to\r\nenjoy each tone by itself. Now this is colour without form,\r\nor sound without music. For it to become music, it must possess\r\nsome quality which will remove it from the purely sensuous. To\r\nmy mind, it is in the power of suggestion that the vital spark\r\nof music lies.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of this, however, I wish to touch upon two\r\nthings: first, on what is called the science of music; and\r\nsecondly, on one of the sensuous elements of music which enters\r\ninto and encroaches upon all suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf one were called upon to define what is called the\r\nintellectual side of music, he would probably speak of \"form,\"\r\ncontrapuntal design, and the like. Let us take up the matter\r\nof form. If by the word \"form\" our theorists meant the most\r\npoignant expression of poetic thought in music, if they meant\r\nby this word the art of arranging musical sounds into the most\r\ntelling presentation of a musical idea, I should have nothing\r\nto say: for if this were admitted instead of the recognized\r\nforms of modern theorists for the proper utterance, we should\r\npossess a study of the power of musical sounds which might\r\ntruly justify the title of musical intellectuality. As it is,\r\nthe word \"form\" stands for what have been called \"stoutly\r\nbuilt periods,\" \"subsidiary themes,\" and the like, a happy\r\ncombination of which in certain prescribed keys was supposed\r\nto constitute good form. Such a device, originally based upon\r\nthe necessities and fashions of the dance, and changing from\r\ntime to time, is surely not worthy of the strange worship\r\nit has received. A form of so doubtful an identity that the\r\nfirst movement of a certain Beethoven sonata can be dubbed by\r\none authority \"sonata-form,\" and by another \"free fantasia,\"\r\ncertainly cannot lay claim to serious intellectual value.\r\n\r\nForm should be a synonym for _coherence_. No idea, whether\r\ngreat or small, can find utterance without form, but that form\r\nwill be inherent to the idea, and there will be as many forms\r\nas there are adequately expressed ideas. In the musical idea,\r\n_per se_, analysis will reveal form.\r\n\r\nThe term \"contrapuntal development\" is to most tone poets of the\r\npresent day a synonym for the device of giving expression to\r\na musically poetic idea. _Per se_, counterpoint is a puerile\r\njuggling with themes, which may be likened to high-school\r\nmathematics. Certainly the entire web and woof of this\r\n\"science,\" as it is called, never sprang from the necessities of\r\npoetic musical utterance. The entire pre-Palestrina literature\r\nof music is a conclusive testimony as to the non-poetic and\r\neven uneuphonious character of the invention.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the world's\r\nmightiest tone poets, accomplished his mission, not by means\r\nof the contrapuntal fashion of his age, but in spite of it. The\r\nlaws of canon and fugue are based upon as prosaic a foundation\r\nas those of the rondo and sonata form; I find it impossible to\r\nimagine their ever having been a spur, or an incentive to poetic\r\nmusical speech. Neither, pure tonal beauty, so-called \"form,\"\r\nnor what is termed the intellectual side of music (the art\r\nof counterpoint, canon, and fugue), constitutes a really vital\r\nfactor in music. This narrows our analysis down to two things,\r\nnamely, the physical effect of musical sound, and suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe simplest manifestations of the purely sensuous effect of\r\nsound are to be found in the savage's delight in noise. In\r\nthe more civilized state, this becomes the sensation of mere\r\npleasure in hearing pleasing sounds. It enters into folk song\r\nin the form of the \"Scotch snap,\" which is first cousin to the\r\nSwiss _jodel_, and is undoubtedly the origin of the skips of\r\nthe augmented and (to a lesser degree) diminished intervals to\r\nbe found in the music of many nations. It consists of the trick\r\nof alternating chest tones with falsetto. It is a kind of quirk\r\nin the voice which pleases children and primitive folk alike,\r\na simple thing which has puzzled folklorists the world over.\r\n\r\nThe other sensuous influence of sound is one of the most\r\npowerful elements of music, and all musical utterance\r\nis involved with and inseparable from it. It consists of\r\nrepetition, recurrence, periodicity.\r\n\r\nNow this repetition may be one of rhythm, tone tint, texture,\r\nor colour, a repetition of figure or of pitch. We know that\r\nsavages, in their incantation ceremonies, keep up a continuous\r\ndrum beating or chant which, gradually increasing in violence,\r\ndrives the hearers into such a state of frenzy that physical\r\npain seems no longer to exist for them.\r\n\r\nThe value of the recurring rhythms and phrases of the march is\r\nwell recognized in the army. A body of men will instinctively\r\nmove in cadence with such music. The ever recurring lilt of a\r\nwaltz rhythm will set the feet moving unconsciously, and as the\r\nenergy of the repetition increases and decreases, so will the\r\ninvoluntary accompanying physical sympathy increase or decrease.\r\n\r\nBerlioz jokingly tells a story of a ballet dancer who objected\r\nto the high pitch in which the orchestra played, and insisted\r\nthat the music be transposed to a lower key. Cradle songs are\r\nfashioned on the same principle.\r\n\r\nThis sensuous sympathy with recurring sounds, rhythm, and pitch\r\nhas something in common with hypnotism, and leads up to what\r\nI have called suggestion in music.\r\n\r\nThis same element in a modified form is made use of in poetry,\r\nfor instance, in Poe's \"Raven,\"\r\n\r\n    Quoth the raven, nevermore,\r\n\r\nand the repetition of colour in the same author's \"Scarlet\r\nDeath.\" It is the mainspring (I will not call it the vital\r\nspark) of many so-called popular songs, the recipe for which\r\nis exceedingly simple. A strongly marked rhythmic figure is\r\nselected, and incessantly repeated until the hearer's body\r\nbeats time to it. The well-known tunes \"There'll Be a Hot\r\nTime,\" etc., and \"Ta-ra-ra, Boom-de-ay\" are good examples of\r\nthis kind of music.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of suggestion in music: one has been called\r\ntone-painting, the other almost evades analysis.\r\n\r\nThe term tone-painting is somewhat unsatisfactory, and reminds\r\none of the French critic who spoke of a poem as \"beautiful\r\npainted music.\" I believe that music can suggest forcibly\r\ncertain things and ideas as well as vague emotions encased in\r\nthe so-called \"form\" and \"science\" of music.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to begin with the most primitive form of suggestion\r\nin music, we shall find it in the direct imitation of sounds\r\nin nature. We remember that Helmholtz, Hanslick, and their\r\nfollowers denied to music the power to suggest things in\r\nnature; but it was somewhat grudgingly admitted that music\r\nmight express the emotions caused by them. In the face of this,\r\nto quote a well-known instance, we have the \"Pastoral\" symphony\r\nof Beethoven, with the thrush, cuckoo, and thunderstorm. The\r\nbirds and the storm are very plainly indicated; but it is not\r\npossible for the music to be an expression of the emotions\r\ncaused by them, for the very simple reason that no emotions\r\nare caused by the cuckoo and thrush, and those caused by\r\nthunderstorms range all the way from depression and fear to\r\nexhilaration, according to the personality of individuals.\r\n\r\nThat music may imitate any rhythmic sounds or melodic figure\r\noccurring in nature, hardly needs affirmation. Such devices may\r\nbe accepted almost as quotations, and not be further considered\r\nhere. The songs of birds, the sound made by galloping horses'\r\nfeet, the moaning of the wind, etc., are all things which\r\nare part and parcel of the musical vocabulary, intelligible\r\nalike to people of every nationality. I need hardly say that\r\nincreasing intensity of sound will suggest vehemence, approach,\r\nand its visual synonym, growth, as well as that decreasing\r\nintensity will suggest withdrawal, dwindling, and placidity.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion brought about by pattern is very familiar.\r\nIt was one of the first signs of the breaking away from\r\nthe conventional trammels of the contrapuntal style of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The first madrigal of\r\nThomas Weelkes (1590) begins with the words, \"Sit down,\" and\r\nthe musical pattern falls a fifth. The suggestion was crude,\r\nbut it was caused by the same impulse as that which supplied\r\nthe material for Wagner's \"Waldweben,\" Mendelssohn's \"Lovely\r\nMelusina,\" and a host of other works.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the pattern of a musical phrase can suggest kinds\r\nof motion may seem strange; but could we, for example, imagine\r\na spinning song with broken arpeggios? Should we see a spear\r\nthrown or an arrow shot on the stage and hear the orchestra\r\nplaying a phrase of an undulating pattern, we should at once\r\nrealize the contradiction. Mendelssohn, Schumann, Wagner,\r\nLiszt, and practically everyone who has written a spinning\r\nsong, has used the same pattern to suggest the turning of a\r\nwheel. That such widely different men as Wagner and Mendelssohn\r\nshould both have adopted the same pattern to suggest undulating\r\nwaves is not a mere chance, but clearly shows the potency of\r\nthe suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion conveyed by means of pitch is one of the\r\nstrongest in music. Vibrations increasing beyond two hundred\r\nand fifty trillions a second become luminous. It is a curious\r\ncoincidence that our highest vibrating musical sounds bring\r\nwith them a well-defined suggestion of light, and that as\r\nthe pitch is lowered we get the impression of ever increasing\r\nobscurity. To illustrate this, I have but to refer you to the\r\nPrelude to \"Lohengrin.\" Had we no inkling as to its meaning,\r\nwe should still receive the suggestion of glittering shapes\r\nin the blue ether.\r\n\r\nLet us take the opening of the \"Im Walde\" symphony by Raff as\r\nan example; deep shadow is unmistakably suggested. Herbert\r\nSpencer's theory of the influence of emotion on pitch is well\r\nknown and needs no confirmation. This properly comes under\r\nthe subject of musical speech, a matter not to be considered\r\nhere. Suffice it to say that the upward tendency of a musical\r\nphrase can suggest exaltation, and that a downward trend may\r\nsuggest depression, the intensity of which will depend upon\r\nthe intervals used. As an instance we may quote the \"Faust\"\r\noverture of Wagner, in which the pitch is used emotionally\r\nas well as descriptively. If the meaning I have found in this\r\nphrase seems to you far-fetched, we have but to give a higher\r\npitch to the motive to render the idea absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion offered by movement is very obvious, for music\r\nadmittedly may be stately, deliberate, hasty, or furious,\r\nit may march or dance, it may be grave or flippant.\r\n\r\nLast of all I wish to speak of the suggestion conveyed by\r\nmeans of tone-tint, the blending of timbre and pitch. It is\r\nessentially a modern element in music, and in our delight in\r\nthis marvellous and potent aid to expression we have carried\r\nit to a point of development at which it threatens to dethrone\r\nwhat has hitherto been our musical speech, melody, in favour\r\nof what corresponds to the shadow languages of speech, namely,\r\ngesture and facial expression. Just as these shadow languages\r\nof speech may distort or even absolutely reverse the meaning\r\nof the spoken word, so can tone colour and harmony change the\r\nmeaning of a musical phrase. This is at once the glory and\r\nthe danger of our modern music. Overwhelmed by the new-found\r\npowers of suggestion in tonal tint and the riot of hitherto\r\nundreamed of orchestral combinations, we are forgetting that\r\npermanence in music depends upon melodic speech.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it is the line, not the colour, that will last.\r\nThat harmony is a potent factor in suggestion may be seen\r\nfrom the fact that Cornelius was able to write an entire song\r\npitched upon one tone, the accompaniment being so varied in\r\nits harmonies that the listener is deceived into attributing\r\nto that one tone many shades of emotion.\r\n\r\nIn all modern music this element is one of the most important.\r\nIf we refer again to the \"Faust\" overture of Wagner, we will\r\nperceive that although the melodic trend and the pitch of\r\nthe phrase carry their suggestion, the roll of the drum which\r\naccompanies it throws a sinister veil over the phrase, making\r\nit impressive in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThe seed from which our modern wealth of harmony and tone\r\ncolour sprang was the perfect major triad. The _raison d'etre_\r\nand development of this combination of tones belong to the\r\nhistory of music. Suffice it to say, that for some psychological\r\nreason this chord (with also its minor form) has still the same\r\nsignificance that it had for the monks of the Middle Ages. It is\r\nperfect. Every complete phrase, must end with it. The attempts\r\nmade to emancipate music from the tyranny of this combination\r\nof sounds have been in vain, showing that the suggestion of\r\nfinality and repose contained in it is irrefutable.\r\n\r\nNow if we depart from this chord a sensation of unrest is\r\noccasioned which can only subside by a progression to another\r\ntriad or a return to the first. With the development of our\r\nmodern system of tonality we have come to think tonally; and a\r\nchord lying outside of the key in which a musical thought is\r\nconceived will carry with it a sense of confusion or mystery\r\nthat our modern art of harmony and tone colour has made its\r\nown. Thus, while any simple low chords accompanying the first\r\nnotes of Raff's \"Im Walde\" symphony, given by the horns and\r\nviolins, would suggest gloom pierced by the gleams of light,\r\nthe remoteness of the chords to the tonality of C major gives\r\na suggestion of mystery; but as the harmony approaches the\r\ntriad the mystery dissolves, letting in the gleam of sunlight\r\nsuggested by the horn.\r\n\r\nGoldmark's overture to \"Sakuntala\" owes its subtle suggestion to\r\nmuch the same cause. Weber made use of it in his \"Freischuetz,\"\r\nWagner in his \"Tarnhelm\" motive, Mendelssohn in his \"Midsummer\r\nNight's Dream,\" Tchaikovsky in the opening of one of his\r\nsymphonies.\r\n\r\nIn becoming common property, so to speak, this important\r\nelement of musical utterance has been dragged through the mud;\r\nand modern composers, in their efforts to raise it above the\r\ncommonplace, have gone to the very edge of what is physically\r\nbearable in the use of tone colour and combination. While this\r\nis but natural, owing to the appropriation of some of the most\r\npoetic and suggestive tone colours for ignoble dance tunes and\r\ndoggerel, it is to my mind a pity, for it is elevating what\r\nshould be a means of adding power and intensity to musical\r\nspeech to the importance of musical speech itself. Possibly\r\nStrauss's \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" may be considered the\r\napotheosis of this power of suggestion in tonal colour, and\r\nin it I believe we can see the tendency I allude to. This\r\nwork stuns by its glorious magnificence of tonal texture; the\r\nsuggestion, in the opening measures, of the rising sun is a\r\nmighty example of the overwhelming power of tone colour. The\r\nupward sweep of the music to the highest regions of light has\r\nmuch of splendour about it; and yet I remember once hearing\r\nin London, sung in the street at night, a song that seemed to\r\nme to contain a truer germ of music.\r\n\r\nFor want of a better word I will call it ideal suggestion.\r\nIt has to do with actual musical speech, and is difficult to\r\ndefine. The possession of it makes a man a poet. If we look\r\nfor analogy, I may quote from Browning and Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n    Dearest, three months ago\r\n    When the mesmerizer, Snow,\r\n    With his hand's first sweep\r\n    Put the earth to sleep.\r\n\r\n                            BROWNING, _A Lovers' Quarrel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      Daffodils,\r\n    That come before the swallow dares, and takes\r\n    The winds of March with beauty; Violets dim,\r\n    But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes.\r\n\r\n                            SHAKESPEARE, _Winter's Tale_.\r\n\r\nFor me this defies analysis, and so it is with some things\r\nin music, the charm of which cannot be ascribed to physical\r\nor mental suggestion, and certainly not to any device of\r\ncounterpoint or form, in the musical acceptance of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n  Accents, 92.\r\n  Adagio, 189.\r\n  Aeolian mode, 83.\r\n  Aeschylus, 70, 76.\r\n  Alberti bass, 197.\r\n  Allemande, 182, 189, 195.\r\n  Amati,
