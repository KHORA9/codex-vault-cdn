Colonist\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome excuse seems to be needed for venturing at this time to publish\r\nbiographical sketches of the men of the Victorian era. Several have been\r\nwritten by men, like Lord Morley and Lord Bryce, having first-hand\r\nknowledge of their subjects, others by the best critics of the next\r\ngeneration, such as Mr. Chesterton and Mr. Clutton-Brock. With their\r\ncritical ability I am not able to compete; but they often postulate a\r\nknowledge of facts which the average reader has forgotten or has never\r\nknown. Having written these sketches primarily for boys at school I am\r\nnot ashamed to state well-known facts, nor have I wished to avoid the\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\nNor do these sketches aim at obtaining a sensation by the shattering of\r\nidols. I have been content to accept the verdicts passed by their\r\ncontemporaries on these great servants of the public, verdicts which, in\r\ngeneral, seem likely to stand the test of time. Boys will come soon\r\nenough on books where criticism has fuller play, and revise the\r\njudgements of the past. Such a revision is salutary, when it is not\r\nunfair or bitter in tone.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the subject called 'civics' is being more widely\r\nintroduced into schools, it seems useful to present the facts of\r\nindividual lives, instances chosen from different professions, as a\r\nsupplement to the study of principles and institutions. There is a\r\nspirit of public service which is best interpreted through concrete\r\nexamples. If teachers will, from their own knowledge, fill in these\r\noutlines and give life to these portraits, the younger generation may\r\nfind it not uninteresting to 'praise famous men and our fathers that\r\nbegat us'.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly necessary in a book of this kind to give an imposing\r\nlist of authorities consulted. In some cases I should find it difficult\r\nto trace the essay or memoir from which a statement is drawn; but in the\r\nmain I have depended on the standard Lives of the various men portrayed,\r\nfrom Froude's _Carlyle_ and Forster's _Dickens_ to Mackail's _Morris_\r\nand Michell's _Rhodes_. And, needless to say, I have found the\r\n_Dictionary of National Biography_ most valuable. If boys were not\r\nfrightened from the shelves by its bulk, it would render my work\r\nsuperfluous; but, though I often recommend it to them, I find few signs\r\nthat they consult it as often as they should. It may seem that no due\r\nproportion has been observed in the length of the different sketches;\r\nbut it must be remembered that, while short Lives of Napier and Lawrence\r\nhave been written by well-known authors, it is more difficult for a boy\r\nto satisfy his curiosity about Lister, Patteson, or Green; and of Morier\r\nno complete life has yet been published.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Emery Walker for assistance in the selection of the\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nThree of my friends have been kind enough to read parts of the book and\r\nto give me advice: the Rev. A. T. P. Williams and Mr. C. E. Robinson, my\r\ncolleagues here, and Mr. Nowell Smith, Head Master of Sherborne. I owe\r\nmuch also to the good judgement of Mr. Milford's reader. If I venture to\r\nthank them for their help, they are in no way responsible for my\r\nmistakes. Writing in the intervals of school-mastering I have no doubt\r\nbeen guilty of many, and I shall be grateful if any reader will take the\r\ntrouble to inform me of those which he detects.\r\n\r\nG.H.B.\r\n\r\nWINCHESTER,\r\n\r\n_April 1920._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF PORTRAITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Carlyle\r\n  From the painting by G.

The sixteenth\r\ncentury speaks to us of change and adventure in every form, of ships and\r\nstatecraft, of discovery and desecration, of masterful sovereigns and\r\nunscrupulous ministers. We evoke the memory of Henry VIII and Elizabeth,\r\nof Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell, of Drake and Raleigh, while the gentler\r\nvirtues of Thomas More and Philip Sidney seem but rare flowers by the\r\nwayside.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the seventeenth century shines out amid the clash of arms,\r\nin battles fought for noble principles, in the lives and deaths of\r\nFalkland and Hampden, of Blake, Montrose, and Cromwell. If its nobility\r\nis dimmed as we pass from the world of Shakespeare and Milton to that of\r\nDryden and Defoe, yet there is sufficient unity in its central theme to\r\njustify the enthusiasm of those who praise it as the heroic age of\r\nEnglish history.\r\n\r\nLess justice, perhaps, is done when we characterize the eighteenth\r\ncentury as that of elegance and wit; when, heedless of the great names\r\nof Chatham, Wolfe, and Clive, we fill the forefront of our picture with\r\nclubs and coffee-houses, with the graces of Chesterfield and Horace\r\nWalpole, the beauties of Gainsborough and Romney, or the masterpieces of\r\nSheraton and Adam. But each generalization, as we make it, seems more\r\nimperfect and unfair; and partly because Carlyle abused it so\r\nunmercifully, this century has in the last fifty years received ample\r\njustice from many of our ablest writers.\r\n\r\nDifficult indeed then it must seem to give adequate expression to the\r\nlife of a century like the nineteenth, so swift, so restless, so\r\nmany-sided, so full of familiar personages, and of conflicts which have\r\nhardly yet receded to a distance where the historian can judge them\r\naright. The rich luxuriance of movements and of individual characters\r\nchokes our path; it is a labyrinth in which one may well lose one's way\r\nand fail to see the wood for the trees.\r\n\r\nThe scientist would be protesting (all this time) that this is a very\r\nsuperficial aspect of the matter. He would recast our framework for us\r\nand teach us to follow out the course of our history through the\r\ndevelopment of mathematics, physics, and biology, to pass from Newton to\r\nHarvey, and from Watt to Darwin, and in the relation of these sciences\r\nto one another to find the clue to man's steady progress.\r\n\r\nThe tale thus told is indeed wonderful to read and worthy of the\r\ntelling; but, to appreciate it fully, it needs a wider and deeper\r\nknowledge than many possess. And it tends to leave out one side of our\r\nhuman nature. There are many whose sympathies will always be drawn\r\nrather to the influence of man upon man than to the extension of man's\r\npower over nature, to the development of character rather than of\r\nknowledge. To-day literature must approach science, her all-powerful\r\nsister, with humility, and crave indulgence for those who still wish to\r\nfollow in the track where Plutarch led the way, to read of human\r\ninfirmity as well as of human power, not to scorn anecdotes or even\r\ncomparisons which illustrate the qualities by which service can be\r\nrendered to the State.\r\n\r\nTo return to the nineteenth century, some would find a guiding thread in\r\nthe progress of the Utilitarian School, which based its teaching on the\r\nidea of pursuing the greatest happiness of the greatest number, the\r\nschool which produced philosophers like Bentham and J. S. Mill, and\r\npoliticians like Cobden and Morley. It was congenial to the English\r\nmind to follow a line which seemed to lead with certainty to practical\r\nresults; and the industrial revolutions caused men at this time to look,\r\nperhaps too much, to the material conditions of well-being. Along with\r\nthe discoveries that revolutionized industry, the eighteenth century had\r\nbequeathed something more precious than material wealth. John Wesley,\r\nthe strongest personal influence of its latter half, had stirred the\r\nspirit of conscious philanthropy and the desire to apply Christian\r\nprinciples to the service of all mankind. Howard, Wilberforce, and\r\nothers directed this spirit into definite channels, and many of their\r\nfollowers tinged with a warm religious glow the principles which, even\r\nin agnostics like Mill, lent consistent nobility to a life of service.\r\nThe efforts which these men made, alone or banded into societies, to\r\nenlarge the liberties of Englishmen and to distribute more fairly the\r\ngood things of life among them, were productive of much benefit to the\r\nage.\r\n\r\nUnder such leadership indeed as that of Bentham and Wilberforce, the\r\nVictorian Age might have been expected to follow a steady course of\r\nbeneficence which would have drawn all the nobler spirits of the new\r\ngeneration into its main current. Clear, logical, and persuasive, the\r\nUtilitarians seemed likely to command success in Parliament, in the\r\npulpit, and in the press. But the criterion of happiness, however widely\r\ndiffused (and that it had not gone far in 1837 Disraeli's _Sybil_ will\r\nattest), was not enough to satisfy the ardent idealism that blazed in\r\nthe breasts of men stirred by revolutions and the new birth of Christian\r\nzeal. In contrast to the ordered pursuit of reform, the spirit of which\r\nthe Utilitarians hoped to embody in societies and Acts of Parliament,\r\nwere the rebellious impulses of men filled with a prophetic spirit,\r\nwalking in obedience to an inward voice, eager to cry aloud their\r\nmessage to a generation wrapped in prosperity and self-contentment. They\r\nformed no single school and followed no single line. In a few cases we\r\nmay observe the relation of master and pupil, as between Carlyle and\r\nRuskin; in more we can see a small band of friends like the\r\nPre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the leaders of the Oxford Movement, or the\r\nscientific circle of Darwin and Hooker, working in fellowship for a\r\ncommon end. But individuality is their note. They sprang often from\r\nsurroundings most alien to their genius; they wandered far from the\r\ncourses which their birth seemed to prescribe; the spirit caught them\r\nand they went forth to the fray.\r\n\r\nThe time in which they grew up was calculated to mould characters of\r\nstrength. Self-control and self-denial had been needed in the protracted\r\nwars with France. Self-reliance had been learnt in the hard school of\r\nadversity. Imagination was quickened by the heroism of the struggle\r\nwhich had ended in the final victory of our arms. And to the generations\r\nborn in the early days of the nineteenth century lay open fields wider\r\nthan were offered to human activity in any other age of the world's\r\nhistory. Now at last the full fruits of sixteenth-century discovery were\r\nto be reaped. It was possible for Gordon, by the personal ascendancy\r\nwhich he owed to his single-minded faith, to create legends and to work\r\nmiracles in Asia and in Africa; for Richard Burton to gain an intimate\r\nknowledge of Islam in its holiest shrines; for Livingstone, Hannington,\r\nand other martyrs to the Faith to breathe their last in the tropics; for\r\nFranklin, dying, as Scott died nearly seventy years later, in the cause\r\nof Science, to hallow the polar regions for the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\nDarkest Africa was to remain impenetrable yet awhile. Only towards the\r\nend of the century, when Stanley's work was finished, could Rhodes and\r\nKitchener conspire to clasp hands across its deserts and its swamps: but\r\non the other side of the globe a new island-empire had been already\r\ncreated by the energy of Wakefield, and developed by the wisdom of\r\nParkes and Grey. In distant lands, on stricken fields less famous but no\r\nless perilous, Wellington's men were applying the lessons which they had\r\nlearnt in the Peninsula. On distant seas Nelson's ships were carrying\r\nexplorers equipped for the more peaceful task of scientific observation.\r\nIn this century the highest mountains, the deepest seas, the widest\r\nstretches of desert were to reveal their secrets to the adventurers who\r\nheld the whole world for their playground or field of conquest.\r\n\r\nAnd not only in the great expansion of empire abroad but in the growth\r\nof knowledge at home and the application of it to civil life, there was\r\na field to employ all the vigour of a race capable of rising to its\r\nopportunities. There is no need to remind this generation of such names\r\nas Stephenson and Herschel, Darwin and Huxley, Faraday and Kelvin; they\r\nare in no danger of being forgotten to-day. The men of letters take\r\nrelatively a less conspicuous place in the evolution of the Age; but the\r\nforce which they put into their writings, the wealth of their material,\r\nthe variety of their lives, and the contrasts of their work, endow the\r\nannals of the nineteenth century with an absorbing interest. While\r\nTennyson for the most part stayed in his English homes, singing the\r\nbeauties of his native land, Browning was a sojourner in Italian palaces\r\nand villas, studying men of many races and many times, exploring the\r\nsubtleties of the human heart. The pen of Dickens portrayed all classes\r\nof society except, perhaps, that which Thackeray made his peculiar\r\nfield. The historians, too, furnish singular contrasts: the vehement\r\npugnacity of Freeman is a foil to the serene studiousness of Acton; the\r\nerratic career of Froude to the concentration of Stubbs. The influence\r\nexercised on their contemporaries by recluses such as Newman or Darwin\r\nmay be compared with the more worldly activities of Huxley and Samuel\r\nWilberforce. Often we see equally diverse elements in following the\r\ncourse of a single life. In Matthew Arnold we wonder at the poet of\r\n'The Strayed Reveller' coexisting with the zealous inspector of schools;\r\nin William Morris we find it hard to reconcile the creative craftsman\r\nwith the fervent apostle of social discontent. Perhaps the most notable\r\ncase of this diversity is the long pilgrimage of Gladstone which led him\r\nfrom the camp of the 'stern, unbending Tories' to the leadership of\r\nRadicals and Home Rulers. There is an interest in tracing through these\r\nmetamorphoses the essential unity of a man's character. On the other\r\nhand, one cannot but admire the steadfastness with which Darwin and\r\nLister, Tennyson and Watts, pursued the even tenor of their way.\r\n\r\nAgain we may notice the strange irony of fortune which drew Carlyle from\r\nhis native moorlands to spend fifty years in a London suburb, while his\r\ndisciple Ruskin, born and bred in London, and finding fit audience in\r\nthe universities of the South, closed his long life in seclusion amid\r\nthe Cumbrian fells. So two statesmen, who were at one time very closely\r\nallied, present a similarly striking contrast in the manner of their\r\nlives. Till the age of forty Joseph Chamberlain limited himself to\r\nmunicipal work in Birmingham, and yet he rose in later life to imperial\r\nviews wider than any statesman's of his day. Charles Dilke, on the other\r\nhand, could be an expert on 'Greater Britain' at thirty and yet devote\r\nhis old age to elaborating the details of Local Government and framing\r\nprogrammes of social reform for the working classes of our towns.\r\nAccidents these may be, but they lend to Victorian biography the charm\r\nof a fanciful arabesque or mosaic of varied pattern and hue.\r\n\r\nEccentrics, too, there were in fact among the literary men of the day,\r\neven as there are in the fiction of Dickens, of Peacock, of George\r\nMeredith. There was Borrow, who, as an old man, was tramping solitarily\r\nin the fields of Norfolk, as earlier he wandered alone in wild Wales or\r\nwilder Spain. There was FitzGerald, who remained all his life constant\r\nto one corner of East Anglia, and who yet, by the precious thread of his\r\ncorrespondence, maintained contact with the great world of Victorian\r\nletters to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nSome wandered as far afield as Asia or the South Seas; some buried\r\nthemselves in the secluded courts of Oxford and Cambridge and became\r\nmythical figures in academic lore. Not many were to be found within hail\r\nof London or Edinburgh in these forceful days. Brougham, the most\r\nomniscient of reviewers, with the most ill-balanced of minds, belongs\r\nmore properly to the preceding age, though he lived to 1868; and it is\r\nfrom this age that the novelists probably drew their eccentric types.\r\nBut between eccentricity and vigorous originality who shall draw the\r\ndividing line?\r\n\r\nMen like these it is hard to label and to classify. Their individuality\r\nis so patent that any general statement is at once open to attack. The\r\nmost that we can do is to indicate one or two points in which the true\r\nVictorians had a certain resemblance to one another, and were unlike\r\ntheir successors of our own day. They were more evidently in earnest,\r\nless conscious of themselves, more indifferent to ridicule, more\r\nabsorbed in their work. To many of them full work and the cares of\r\noffice seemed a necessity of life. It was a typical Victorian who, after\r\nsixteen years of public service, writing a family letter, says, 'I feel\r\nthat the interest of business and the excitement of responsibility are\r\nindispensable to me, and I believe that I am never happier than when I\r\nhave more to think of and to do than I can manage in a given period'.\r\nIdleness and insouciance had few temptations for them, cynicism was\r\nabhorrent to them. Even Thackeray was perpetually 'caught out' when he\r\nassumed the cynic's pose. Charlotte Brontë, most loyal of his admirers\r\nand critics, speaks of the 'deep feelings for his kind' which he\r\ncherished in his large heart, and again of the 'sentiment, jealously\r\nhidden but genuine, which extracts the venom from that formidable\r\nThackeray'. Large-hearted and generous to one another, they were ready\r\nto face adventure, eager to fight for an ideal, however impracticable it\r\nseemed. This was as true of Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold, and all\r\nthe _genus irritabile vatum_, as of the politicians and the men of\r\naction. They made many mistakes; they were combative, often difficult to\r\ndeal with. Some of them were deficient in judgement, others in the\r\nsaving gift of humour; but they were rarely petty or ungenerous, or\r\nfailed from faint-heartedness or indecision. Vehemence and impatience\r\ncan do harm to the best causes, and the lives of men like the Napiers\r\nand the Lawrences, like Thomas Arnold and Charles Kingsley, like John\r\nBright and Robert Lowe, are marred by conflicts which might have been\r\navoided by more studied gentleness or more philosophic calm. But the\r\ntime seemed short in which they could redress the evils which offended\r\nthem. They saw around them a world which seemed to be lapped in comfort\r\nor swathed in the dead wrappings of the past, and would not listen to\r\nreasoned appeals; and it would be futile to deny that, by lifting their\r\nvoices to a pitch which offends fastidious critics, Carlyle and Ruskin\r\ndid sometimes obtain a hearing and kindle a passion which Matthew Arnold\r\ncould never stir by his scholarly exhortations to 'sweetness and light'.\r\n\r\nBut it would be a mistake to infer from such clamour and contention that\r\nthe Victorians did not enjoy their fair share of happiness in this\r\nworld. The opposite would be nearer the truth: happiness was given to\r\nthem in good, even in overflowing measure. Any one familiar with\r\nTrevelyan's biography of Macaulay will remember with what fullness and\r\nintensity he enjoyed his life; and the same fact is noted by Dr. Mozley\r\nin his Essay on that most representative Victorian, Thomas Arnold. The\r\nlives of Delane, the famous editor of _The Times_, of the statesman\r\nPalmerston, of the painter Millais, and of many other men in many\r\nprofessions, might be quoted to support this view. In some cases this\r\nwas due to their strong family affections, in others to their genius for\r\nfriendship. A good conscience, a good temper, a good digestion, are all\r\nfactors of importance. But perhaps the best insurance against moodiness\r\nand melancholy was that strenuous activity which made them forget\r\nthemselves, that energetic will-power which was the driving force in so\r\nmany movements of the day.\r\n\r\nHow many of the changes of last century were due to general tendencies,\r\nhow far the single will of this man or that has seriously affected its\r\nhistory, it is impossible to estimate. To many it seems that the rôle of\r\nthe individual is played out. The spirit of the coming era is that of\r\norganized fellowship and associated effort. The State is to prescribe\r\nfor all, and the units are, somehow, to be marshalled into their places\r\nby a higher collective will. Under the shadow of socialism the more\r\nambitious may be tempted to quit the field of public service at home and\r\nto look to enterprises abroad--to resign poor England to a mechanical\r\nbureaucracy, a soulless uniformity where one man is as good as another.\r\nBut it is difficult to believe that society can dispense with leaders,\r\nor afford to forget the lessons which may be learnt from the study of\r\nsuch noble lives. The Victorians had a robuster faith. Their faith and\r\ntheir achievements may help to banish such doubts to-day. As one of the\r\nfew survivors of that Victorian era has lately said: 'Only those whose\r\nminds are numbed by the suspicion that all times are tolerably alike,\r\nand men and women much of a muchness, will deny that it was a generation\r\nof intrepid efforts forward.' Some fell in mid-combat: some survived to\r\nwitness the eventual victory of their cause. For all might be claimed\r\nthe funeral honours which Browning claimed for his Grammarian. They\r\naimed high; they 'threw themselves on God': the mountain-tops are their\r\nappropriate resting-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CARLYLE\r\n\r\n1795-1881\r\n\r\n1795.

At the foot of these hills\r\nis the village of Ecclefechan, some eight miles inland. Here in the wide\r\nirregular street, down the side of which flows a little beck, stands the\r\ngrey cottage, built by the stonemason James Carlyle, where he lived with\r\nhis second wife, Margaret Aitken; and here on December 4, 1795, the\r\neldest of nine children, their son Thomas was born. There is little to\r\nredeem the place from insignificance; the houses are mostly mean, the\r\nposition of the village is tame and commonplace. But if a visitor will\r\nmount the hills that lie to the north, turn southward and look over the\r\nwide expanse of land and water to the Cumbrian mountains, then, should\r\nhe be fortunate enough to see the landscape in stormy and unsettled\r\nweather, he may realize why the land was so dear to its most famous son\r\nthat he could return to it from year to year throughout his life and\r\ncould there at all times soothe his most unquiet moods. Through all his\r\nyears in London he remained a lowland Scot and was most at home in\r\nAnnandale. With this district his fame is still bound up, as that of\r\nWalter Scott with the Tweed, or that of Wordsworth with the Lakes.\r\n\r\nIn this humble household Thomas Carlyle first learnt what is meant by\r\nwork, by truthfulness, and by reverence, lessons which he never forgot.\r\nHe learnt to revere authority, to revere worth, and to revere something\r\nyet higher and more mysterious--the Unseen. In _Sartor Resartus_ he\r\ndescribes how his hero was impressed by his parents' observance of\r\nreligious duties. 'The highest whom I knew on earth I here saw bowed\r\ndown with awe unspeakable before a Higher in Heaven; such things\r\nespecially in infancy, reach inwards to the very core of your being.'\r\nHis father was a man of unusual force of character and gifted with a\r\nwonderful power of speech, flashing out in picturesque metaphor, in\r\nbiting satire, in humorous comment upon life. He had, too, the Scotch\r\ngenius for valuing education; and it was he who decided that Tom, whose\r\ncharacter he had observed, should have every chance that schooling could\r\ngive him. His mother was a most affectionate, single-hearted, and\r\nreligious woman; labouring for her family, content with her lot, her\r\ntrust for her son unfailing, her only fear for him lest in his new\r\nlearning he might fall away from the old Biblical faith which she held\r\nso firmly herself.\r\n\r\nReading with his father or mother, lending a hand at housework when\r\nneeded, nourishing himself on the simple oatmeal and milk which\r\nthroughout life remained his favourite food, submitting himself\r\ninstinctively to the stern discipline of the home, he passed, happily on\r\nthe whole, through his childhood and soon outstripped his comrades in\r\nthe village school. His success there led to his going in his tenth year\r\nto the grammar school at Annan; and before he reached his fourteenth\r\nyear he trudged off on foot to Edinburgh to begin his studies at the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nInstead of young men caught up by express trains and deposited, by the\r\naid of cabmen and porters, in a few hours in the sheltered courts of\r\nOxford and Cambridge, we must imagine a party of boys, of fourteen or\r\nfifteen years old, trudging on foot twenty miles a day for five days\r\nacross bleak country, sleeping at rough inns, and on their arrival\r\nsearching for an attic in some bleak tenement in a noisy street. Here\r\nthey were to live almost entirely on the baskets of home produce sent\r\nthrough the carriers at intervals by their thrifty parents. It was and\r\nis a Spartan discipline, and it turns out men who have shown their grit\r\nand independence in all lands where the British flag is flown.\r\n\r\nThe earliest successes which Carlyle won, both at Annan and at\r\nEdinburgh, were in mathematics. His classical studies received little\r\nhelp from his professors, and his literary gifts were developed mostly\r\nby his own reading, and stimulated from time to time by talks with\r\nfellow students. Perhaps it was for his ultimate good that he was not\r\nbrought under influences which might have guided him into more\r\nmethodical courses and tamed his rugged originality. The universities\r\ncannot often be proved to have fostered kindly their poets and original\r\nmen of letters; at least we may say that Edinburgh was a more kindly\r\nAlma Mater to Carlyle than Oxford and Cambridge proved to Shelley and\r\nByron. His native genius, and the qualities which he inherited from his\r\nparents, were not starved in alien soil, but put out vigorous growth.\r\nFrom such letters to his friends as have survived, we can see what a\r\npower Carlyle had already developed of forcibly expressing his ideas and\r\nestablishing an influence over others.\r\n\r\nHe left the university at the age of nineteen, and the next twelve years\r\nof his life were of a most unsettled character. He made nearly as many\r\nfalse starts in life as Goldsmith or Coleridge, though he redeemed them\r\nnobly by his persistence in after years. In 1814 his family still\r\nregarded the ministry as his vocation, and Carlyle was himself quite\r\nundecided about it. To promote this idea the profession of schoolmaster\r\nwas taken up for the time. He continued in it for more than six years,\r\nfirst at Annan and then at Kirkcaldy; but he was soon finding it\r\nuncongenial and rebelling against it. A few years later he tried reading\r\nlaw with no greater contentment; and in order to support himself he was\r\nreduced to teaching private pupils. The chief friend of this period was\r\nEdward Irving, the gifted preacher who afterwards, in London, came to\r\ntragic shipwreck. He was a native of Annan, five years older than\r\nCarlyle, and he had spent some time in preaching and preparing for the\r\nministry. He was one of the few people who profoundly influenced\r\nCarlyle's life. At Kirkcaldy he was his constant companion, shared his\r\ntastes, lent him books, and kindled his powers of insight and judgement\r\nin many a country walk. Carlyle has left us records of this time in his\r\n_Reminiscences_, how he read the twelve volumes of Irving's _Gibbon_ in\r\ntwelve days, how he tramped through the Trossachs on foot, how in summer\r\ntwilights he paced the long stretches of sand at Irving's side.\r\n\r\nIt was Irving who in 1822 commended him to the Buller family, with whom\r\nhe continued as tutor for two years. Charles Buller, the eldest son, was\r\na boy of rare gifts and promise, worthy of such a teacher; and but for\r\nhis untimely death in 1848 he might have won a foremost place in\r\npolitics. The family proved valuable friends to Carlyle in after-life,\r\nbesides enabling him at this time to live in comfort, with leisure for\r\nhis own studies and some spare money to help his family. But for this\r\naid, his brother Alexander would have fared ill with the farming, and\r\nJohn could never have afforded the training for the medical profession.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was Irving who first took him to Haddington in 1821 and\r\nintroduced him to Jane Baillie Welsh, his future wife. Irving's\r\nsincerity and sympathy, his earnest enthusiasm joined with the power of\r\ngenuine laughter (always to Carlyle a mark of a true rich nature), made\r\nhim through all these years a thoroughly congenial companion. He really\r\nunderstood Carlyle as few outside his family did, and he never grew\r\nimpatient at Carlyle's difficulty in settling to a profession. 'Your\r\nmind,' he wrote, 'unfortunately for its present peace, has taken in so\r\nwide a range of study as to be almost incapable of professional\r\ntrammels; and it has nourished so uncommon and so unyielding a\r\ncharacter, as first unfits you for, and then disgusts you with, any\r\naccommodations which for so cultivated and so fertile a mind would\r\neasily procure favour and patronage.' Well might Carlyle in later days\r\nfind a hero in tough old Samuel Johnson, whose sufferings were due to\r\nsimilar causes. The other source which kept the fire in him aglow\r\nthrough these difficult years was the confidence and affection of his\r\nwhole family, and the welcome which he always found at home.\r\nDisappointed though they were at his failure, as yet, to settle to a\r\nprofession and to earn a steady income, for all that 'Tom' was to be a\r\ngreat man; and when he could find time to spend some months at Mainhill,\r\nor later at Scotsbrig,[1] a room could always be found for him, hours of\r\npeace and solitude could be enjoyed, the most wholesome food, and the\r\nmost cordial affection, were there rendered as loyal ungrudging tribute.\r\nBut new ties were soon to be knit and a new chapter to be opened in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Farms near Ecclefechan to which his parents moved in 1814\r\nand 1826.]\r\n\r\nJohn Welsh of Haddington, who died before Carlyle met his future wife,\r\nwas a surgeon and a man of remarkable gifts; and his daughter could\r\ntrace her descent to such famous Scotsmen as Wallace and John Knox. Her\r\nown mental powers were great, and her vivacity and charming manners\r\ncaused her to shine in society wherever she was. She had an unquestioned\r\nsupremacy among the ladies of Haddington and many had been the suitors\r\nfor her hand. When Irving had given her lessons there, love had sprung\r\nup between tutor and pupil, but this budding romance ended tragically in\r\n1822. Before meeting her he had been engaged to another lady; and when a\r\nnew appointment gave him a sure income, he was held to his bond and was\r\nforced to crush down his passion and to take farewell of Miss Welsh. At\r\nwhat date Carlyle conceived the hope of making her his wife it is\r\ndifficult to say. Her beauty and wit seem to have done their work\r\nquickly in his case; but she was not one to give her affections readily,\r\nfor all the intellectual sympathy which united them. In 1823 she was\r\ncontemplating marriage, but had made no promise; in 1824 she had\r\naccepted the idea of marrying him, but in 1825 she still scouted the\r\nconditions in which he proposed to live. His position was precarious,\r\nhis projects visionary, and his immediate desire was to settle on a\r\nlonely farm, where he could devote himself to study, if she would do the\r\nhousehold drudgery. Because his mother whom he loved and honoured was\r\ncontent to lead this life, he seemed to think that his wife could do the\r\nsame; but her nature and her rearing were not those of the Carlyles and\r\ntheir Annandale neighbours. It involved a complete renunciation of the\r\ncomforts of life and the social position which she enjoyed; and much\r\nthough she admired his talents and enjoyed his company, she was not in\r\nthat passion of love which could lift her to such heights of\r\nself-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nBy this time we can begin to discern in his letters the outline of his\r\ncharacter--his passionate absorption in study, his moodiness, his fits\r\nof despondency, his intense irritability; his incapacity to master his\r\nown tongue and temper. In happy moments he shows great tenderness of\r\nfeeling for those whom he loves or pities; but this alternates with\r\ninconsiderate clamour and loud complaints deafening the ears of all\r\nabout him, provoked often by slight and even imaginary grievances. It is\r\nthe artistic nature run riot, and that in one who preached silence and\r\nstoicism as the chief virtues--an inconsistency which has amused and\r\ndisgusted generations of readers. It was impossible for him to do his\r\nwork with the regular method, the equable temper, of a Southey or a\r\nScott. In dealing with history he must image the past to himself most\r\nvividly before he could expound his subject; and that effort and strain\r\ncost him sleepless nights and days of concentrated thought. Nor was he\r\nan easier companion when his work was finished and he could take his\r\nease. Then life seemed empty and profitless; and in its emptiness his\r\nvoice echoed all the louder. The ill was within him, and outward\r\ncircumstances were powerless to affect his nature.\r\n\r\nAt this time he was chiefly occupied in reading German literature and\r\nspreading the knowledge of it among his countrymen. After Coleridge he\r\nwas the first of our literary men to appreciate the poets and mystics of\r\nGermany, and he did more even than Coleridge to make Englishmen familiar\r\nwith them. He acquired at this time a knowledge of French and Italian\r\nliterature too; but the philosophy of Kant and the writings of Goethe\r\nand Schiller roused him to greater enthusiasm. From Kant he learnt that\r\nthe guiding principle of conduct was not happiness, but the 'categorical\r\nimperative' of duty; from Goethe he drew such hopefulness as gleams\r\noccasionally through his despondent utterances on the progress of the\r\nhuman race. He translated Goethe's novel, _Wilhelm Meister_, in 1823,\r\nand followed it up with the _Life of Schiller_. There was no\r\nconsiderable sale for either of these books till his lectures in London\r\nand his established fame roused a demand for all he had written. In\r\nthese days he was practising for the profession of a man of letters, and\r\nwas largely influenced by personal ambition and the desire to earn an\r\nincome which would make him independent; he was not yet fired with a\r\nmission, or kindled to white heat.\r\n\r\nHis long courtship was rewarded in October 1826. When the marriage took\r\nplace the bride was twenty-five years old and the bridegroom thirty. Men\r\nof letters have not the reputation of making ideal husbands, and the\r\nqualities to which this is due were possessed by Carlyle in exaggerated\r\nmeasure. It was a perilous enterprise for any one to live with him, most\r\nof all for such a woman, delicately bred, nervous, and highly strung.\r\nShe was aware of this, and was prepared for a large measure of\r\nself-denial; but she could not have foreseen how severe she would find\r\nthe trial. The morbid sensitiveness of Carlyle to his own pains and\r\ntroubles, so often imaginary, joined with his inconsiderate blindness to\r\nhis wife's real sufferings, led to many heart-burnings. If she\r\ncontributed to them, in some degree, by her wilfulness, jealous temper,\r\nand sharpness of tongue, ill-health and solitude may well excuse her.\r\n\r\nHis own confessions, made after her death, are coloured by sorrow and\r\ndeep affection: no doubt he paints his own conduct in hues darker than\r\nthe truth demands. Shallow critics have sneered at the picture of the\r\nphilosopher whose life was so much at variance with his creed, and too\r\nmuch has, perhaps, been written about the subject. If reference must be\r\nmade to such a well-worn tale, it is best to let Carlyle's own account\r\nstand as he wished it to stand. His moral worth has been vindicated in a\r\nhundred ways, not least by his humility and honesty about himself, and\r\ncan bear the test of time.\r\n\r\nFor the first two years of married life Carlyle's scheme of living on a\r\nfarm was kept at bay by his wife, and their home was at Edinburgh.\r\nCarlyle refers to this as the happiest period of his life, though he did\r\nnot refrain from loud laments upon occasions. The good genius of the\r\nhousehold was Jeffrey, the famous editor of the _Edinburgh Review_, who\r\nwas distantly related to Mrs. Carlyle. He made friends with the\r\nnewly-married pair, opened a path for them into the society of the\r\ncapital, and enabled Carlyle to spread the knowledge of German authors\r\nin the _Review_ and to make his bow before a wider public. The prospects\r\nof the little household seemed brighter, but, by generously making over\r\nall her money to her mother, his wife had crippled its resources; and\r\nCarlyle was of so difficult a humour that neither Jeffrey nor any one\r\nelse could guide his steps for long. Living was precarious; society made\r\ndemands even on a modest household, and in 1828 he at length had his way\r\nand persuaded his wife to remove to Craigenputtock. It was in the\r\nloneliness of the moors that Carlyle was to come to his full stature and\r\nto develop his astonishing genius.\r\n\r\nCraigenputtock was a farm belonging to his wife's family, lying seventy\r\nfeet above the sea, sixteen miles from Dumfries, among desolate moors\r\nand bogs, and fully six miles from the nearest village. 'The house is\r\ngaunt and hungry-looking. It stands with the scanty fields attached as\r\nan island in a sea of morass. The landscape is unredeemed either by\r\ngrace or grandeur, mere undulating hills of grass and heather with peat\r\nbogs in the hollows between them.' So Froude describes the home where\r\nthe Carlyles were to spend six years, the wife in domestic labours, in\r\nsolitude, in growing ill-health, the husband in omnivorous reading, in\r\ndigesting the knowledge that he gathered, in transmuting it and marking\r\nit with the peculiar stamp of his genius. There was no true\r\ncompanionship over the work. As the moorland gave the fresh air and\r\nstillness required, so the wife might nourish the physical frame with\r\nwholesome digestible food and save him from external cares; the rest\r\nmust be done by lonely communing with himself. He needed no Fleet Street\r\ntaverns or literary salons to encourage him. Goethe, with whom he\r\nexchanged letters and compliments at times, said with rare insight that\r\nhe 'had in himself an originating principle of conviction, out of which\r\nhe could develop the force that lay in him unassisted by other men'.\r\n\r\nFew were the interruptions from without. His fame was not yet\r\nestablished. In any case pilgrims would have to undertake a very rough\r\njourney, and the fashion of such pilgrimages had hardly begun. But in\r\n1833 from distant America came one disciple, afterwards to be known as\r\nthe famous author Ralph Waldo Emerson; and he has left us in his\r\n_English Traits_ a vivid record of his impression of two or three famous\r\nmen of letters whom he saw. He describes Carlyle as 'tall and gaunt,\r\nwith a cliff-like brow, self-possessed, and holding his extraordinary\r\npowers of conversation in easy command; clinging to his northern accent\r\nwith evident relish; full of lively anecdote, and with a streaming\r\nhumour, which floated everything he looked upon'.[2]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Emerson, _English Traits_, 'World's Classics' edition, p.\r\n8.]\r\n\r\nMuch of his time was given to reading about the French Revolution, which\r\nwas to be the subject of his greatest literary triumph. But the\r\ncharacteristic work of this period is _Sartor Resartus_ ('The tailor\r\npatched anew'), in which Carlyle, under a thin German disguise, reveals\r\nhimself to the world, with his views on the customs and ways of society\r\nand his contempt for all the pretensions and absurdities which they\r\ninvolved. In many places it is extravagant and fantastic, as when 'the\r\nmost remarkable incident in modern history' proves to be George Fox the\r\nQuaker making a suit of leather to render himself independent of\r\ntailors; in others it rises to the highest pitch of poetry, as in the\r\nsympathetic lament over the hardships of manual labour. 'Venerable to me\r\nis the hard Hand; crooked, coarse; wherein notwithstanding lies a\r\ncunning virtue, indefeasibly royal, as of the Sceptre of this Planet.\r\nVenerable, too, is the rugged face, all weather-tanned, besoiled, with\r\nits rude intelligence; for it is the face of a Man living manlike. O,\r\nbut the more venerable for thy rudeness, and even because we must pity\r\nas well as love thee! Hardly-entreated Brother! For us was thy back so\r\nbent, for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed; thou wert\r\nour Conscript on whom the lot fell, and fighting our battles wert so\r\nmarred.' It is through such passages that Carlyle has won his way to the\r\nhearts of many who care little for history, or for German literature.\r\n\r\nThe book evidently contains much that is autobiographical, and helps us\r\nto understand Carlyle's childhood and youth; but it is so mixed up with\r\nfantasy and humour that it is difficult to separate fiction from fact.\r\nIts chief aim seems to be the overthrow of cant, the ridiculing of\r\nempty conventions, and the preaching of sincerity and independence. But\r\nnot yet was Carlyle's generation prepared to listen to such sermons.\r\nJeffrey was bewildered by the tone and offended at the style; publisher\r\nafter publisher refused it; and when at length it was launched upon the\r\nworld piecemeal in _Fraser's Magazine_, the reading public either\r\nignored it or abused it in the roundest terms. During all this time\r\nCarlyle was anxiously looking for some surer means of livelihood, and\r\nhad not yet decided that literature was to be his profession. He had\r\nhopes at different times of professorships in Edinburgh and St. Andrews,\r\nand of the editorship of various reviews; but these all came to nothing.\r\nFor some posts he was not suited; for others his application could find\r\nno support. He even thought of going to America, where Emerson and other\r\nadmirers would have welcomed him. But the disappointments in Scotland\r\ndecided him to make one more effort in London before accepting defeat,\r\nand in 1834 he found a house at Chelsea and prepared to quit his\r\nhermitage among the moors.\r\n\r\nCheyne Row, Chelsea, was to be his new home, a quiet street running\r\nnorthward from the riverside in a quarter of London not then invaded by\r\nindustrialism. The house, No. 24, with its little garden, has been made\r\ninto a Carlyle museum, and may still be seen on the east side of the\r\nstreet facing a few survivors of the sturdy old pollarded lime-trees\r\nstanding there 'like giants in Tawtie wigs'. His bust, by Boehm, is in\r\nthe garden on the Embankment not a hundred yards away. With this\r\ndistrict are connected other names famous in literature and art, but its\r\npresiding genius is the 'Sage of Chelsea', who spent the last\r\nforty-seven years of his life in it; and there, in a double-walled room,\r\nin spite of trivial disturbances from without, in spite of far more\r\nserious fits of dejection and discontent within, he composed his three\r\ngreatest historical books. At the outset his prospects were not bright,\r\nand at the end of 1834 he confessed 'it is now twenty-three months\r\nsince I earned a penny by the craft of literature'. There was need of\r\nmuch faith; and it was fortunate for him that he had at his side one who\r\nbelieved in his genius and who was well qualified to judge. He must have\r\nbeen thinking of this when he wrote of Mahomet in _Heroes_ and of the\r\nprophet's gratitude to his first wife Kadijah: 'She believed in me when\r\nnone else would believe. In the whole world I had but one friend and she\r\nwas that!' In the same place he quoted the German writer Novalis: 'It is\r\ncertain my conviction gains infinitely, the moment another soul will\r\nbelieve in it.'\r\n\r\nSo fortified, he worked through the days of poverty and gloom, with\r\ngroans and outbursts of fury, kindling to white heat as he imaged to\r\nhimself the men and events of the French Revolution, and throwing them\r\non to paper in lurid pictures of flame. One terrible misadventure\r\nchilled his spirit in 1835, when the manuscript of the first volume was\r\nlent to J. S. Mill, and was accidentally burnt; but, after a short fit\r\nof despair, he set manfully to work to repair the loss, and the new\r\nversion was finished in January, 1837. This book marked an epoch in the\r\nwriting of history. Hitherto few had realized what potent force there\r\nwas in the original documents lying stored in libraries and record\r\noffices. They were 'live shells' buried in the dust of a neglected\r\nmagazine; and in the hands of Carlyle they came to life again and worked\r\nhavoc among the traditional judgements of history. This book was also\r\nthe turning point in his career. Dickens, Thackeray, and others hailed\r\nit with enthusiasm; gradually it made its way with the public at large;\r\nand as in the following years Carlyle, prompted by some friends, gave\r\nsuccessful courses of lectures,[3] his position among men of letters\r\nbecame assured, and he had no more need to worry over money. Living in\r\nLondon he became known to a wider circle, and his marvellous powers of\r\nconversation brought visitors and invitations in larger measure than he\r\ndesired. The new friends whom he valued most were Mr. and Lady Harriet\r\nBaring,[4] and he was often their guest in London, in Surrey, in\r\nScotland, and later at The Grange in Hampshire. But he remained faithful\r\nto his older and more humble friends, while he also made himself\r\naccessible to young men of letters who seemed anxious to learn, and who\r\ndid not offend one or other of his many prejudices. Such were Sterling,\r\nRuskin, Tennyson, and James Anthony Froude.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The most famous course, on Hero-Worship, was delivered in\r\nMay, 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Afterwards Lord and Lady Ashburton.]\r\n\r\nDespite these successes Carlyle's letters at this time are full of the\r\nusual discontents. London life and society stimulated him for the time,\r\nbut he paid dearly for it. Late dinners and prolonged bouts of talk, in\r\nwhich he put forth all his powers, were followed by dyspepsia and\r\nlassitude next day; and the neighbours, who kept dogs or cocks which\r\nwere accused of disturbing his slumbers, were the mark for many plaints\r\nand lamentations. He could not in any circumstances be entirely happy.\r\nWork was so exciting with the imagination on fire, that it kept him\r\nawake at night; idleness was still more fatal in its effects. And so,\r\nafter a few years of relative calm, in 1839 we find his active brain\r\nstruggling to create a true picture of Oliver Cromwell and to expound\r\nthe meaning of the Great Civil War.\r\n\r\nIt was to be no easy task. For nearly five years he was to wrestle with\r\nthe subject, trying in vain to give it adequate shape and form, and then\r\nto scrap the labours of years and to start again on a new plan; but in\r\nthe end he was to win another signal victory. While the _French\r\nRevolution_ may be the higher artistic triumph, _Cromwell_ is more\r\nimportant for one who wishes to understand the life-work of Carlyle and\r\nall for which he stood. The emptiness of political theories and\r\ninstitutions, the enduring value of character, are lessons which no one\r\nhas preached more forcibly. In his opinion the success of the English\r\nrevolution, the blow to tyranny and misgovernment in Church and State,\r\nwas not due to eloquent members of the Long Parliament, but to plain\r\nGod-fearing men, who, if they quoted scripture, did so not from\r\nhypocrisy but because it was the language in which they habitually\r\nthought. Nor could they build up a new England till they had found a\r\nleader. It was the ages which had faith to recognize their worthiest man\r\nand to accept his guidance which had achieved great things in the world,\r\nnot those which prated of democracy and progress. To make his\r\ncountrymen, in this age of fluent political talk, see the true moral\r\nquality of the men of the seventeenth century--this it was which\r\noccupied seven years of Carlyle's life and filled his thoughts. It was\r\nindeed a labour of Hercules. Much of the material was lost beyond\r\nrepair, much buried in voluminous folios and State papers, much obscured\r\nby the cant and prejudice of eighteenth-century authors. To recall the\r\npast, Carlyle needed such help as geography would give him, and he spent\r\nmany days in visiting Dunbar, Worcester, and other sites. To Naseby he\r\nwent in 1842, in company with Dr. Arnold, and 'plucked two gowans and a\r\ncowslip from the burial heaps of the slain'. A more important task was\r\nto recover authentic utterances of Cromwell and his fellow workers, and\r\nto put these in the place of the second-hand judgements of political\r\npartisans; and this involved laborious researches in libraries. Above\r\nall, he had to interpret these records in a new spirit, exercising true\r\ninsight and sympathy, to put life into the dry bones and to present his\r\nreaders with the living image of a man. He combined in unique fashion\r\nthe laborious research of a student with the moral fervour of a prophet.\r\n\r\nDespite the strain of these labours Carlyle showed few signs of his\r\nfifty years. The family were of tough stock; and the years which he had\r\nspent in moorland air had increased the capital of health on which he\r\ncould draw. The flight of time was chiefly marked by his growing\r\nantipathy to the political movements of the day, and by a growing\r\ndespondency about the future. People might buy his books; but he looked\r\nin vain for evidence that they paid heed to the lessons which he\r\npreached. The year of revolutions, 1848, followed by the setting up of\r\nthe French Empire and the collapse of the Roman Republic, produced\r\nnothing but disappointment, and he became louder and more bitter in his\r\njudgements on democracy. 1849 saw the birth of the _Latter-Day\r\nPamphlets_ in which he outraged Mill and the Radicals by his scornful\r\nwords about Negro Emancipation, and by the savage delight with which he\r\nshattered their idols. He loved to expose what seemed to him the\r\nsophistries involved in the conventional praise of liberty. Of old the\r\nmediaeval serf or the negro slave had some one who was responsible for\r\nhim, some one interested in his physical well-being. The new conditions\r\ntoo often meant nothing but liberty to starve, liberty to be idle,\r\nliberty to slip back into the worst indulgences, while those who might\r\nhave governed stood by regardless and lent no help. Such from an extreme\r\npoint of view appeared the policy of _laisser-faire_; and he was neither\r\nmoderate nor impartial in stating his case. 'An idle white gentleman is\r\nnot pleasant to me;... but what say you to an idle black gentleman, with\r\nhis rum bottle in his hand,... no breeches on his body, pumpkin at\r\ndiscretion, and the fruitfullest region of the earth going back to\r\njungle round him?' In a similar vein he dealt with stump oratory, prison\r\nreform, and other subjects, tilting in reckless fashion at the shields\r\nof the reforming Radicals of the day; nor was he less outspoken when he\r\nmet in person the champions of these views. A letter to his wife in 1847\r\ntells of a visit to the Brights at Rochdale; how 'John and I discorded\r\nin our views not a little', and how 'I shook peaceable Brightdom as with\r\na passing earthquake'. From books he could learn: to human teachers he\r\nproved refractory. Had he been more willing to listen to others, his\r\njudgements on contemporary events might have been more valuable. All his\r\nlife he was, as George Meredith says, 'Titanic rather than Olympian, a\r\nheaver of rocks, not a shaper'; and this fever of denunciation grew with\r\nadvancing years. But with these spurts of volcanic energy alternate\r\nmoods of the deepest depression. His journal for 1850 says, 'This seems\r\nreally the Nadir of my fortunes; and in hope, desire, or outlook, so far\r\nas common mortals reckon such, I never was more bankrupt. Lonely, shut\r\nup within my contemptible and yet _not_ deliberately ignoble self,\r\nperhaps there never was, in modern literary or other history, a more\r\nsolitary soul, _capable_ of any friendship or honest relation to\r\nothers.' By this time he was feeling the need of another task, and in\r\n1851 he chose Frederick the Great of Prussia for the subject of his next\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nTo this generation apology seems to be needed for an English author who\r\nlavishes so much admiration on Prussian men and institutions. But\r\nCarlyle, whose chief heroes had been men of intense religious\r\nconvictions, like Luther, Knox, and Cromwell, could find no hero after\r\nhis heart in English history subsequent to the Civil War. Eloquent Pitts\r\nand Burkes, jobbing Walpoles and Pelhams, were to him types of\r\npoliticians who had brought England to her present plight. German\r\nliterature had always kept its influence over him and had directed his\r\nattention to German history; Frederick, without religion as he was,\r\nseemed at any rate sincere, recognized facts, and showed practical\r\ncapacity for ruling (essential elements in the Carlylean hero), and the\r\nsubject would be new to his readers. The labour involved was stupendous;\r\nit was to fill his life and the lives of his helpers for thirteen\r\nyears. Of these helpers the chief credit is due to Joseph Neuberg, who\r\npiloted him over German railways, libraries, and battle-fields in the\r\nsearch for picturesque detail, and to Henry Larkin, who toiled in London\r\nto trace references in scores of authors, and who finally crowned the\r\nwork by laborious indexing, which made Carlyle's labyrinth accessible to\r\nhis readers. There were masses of material hidden away and unsifted;\r\nand, as in the case of Cromwell, only a man of original genius could\r\npenetrate this inert mass with shafts of light and make the past live\r\nagain. The task grew as he continued his researches. He groped his way\r\nback to the beginning of the Hohenzollerns, and sketched the portraits\r\nof the old Electors in a style unequalled for vividness and humour. He\r\ndrew a full-length portrait of Frederick William, most famous of\r\ndrill-sergeants, and he studied the campaigns of his son with a\r\nthoroughness which has been a model to soldiers and civilians ever\r\nsince. We have the record of two tours which he made in Germany to view\r\nthe scene of operations;[5] and it is amazing how exact a picture he\r\ncould bring away from a short visit to each separate battle-field. His\r\ndiligence, accuracy, and wide grasp of the subject satisfied the\r\nseverest judges; and the book won him a success as complete and enduring\r\nin Germany as in England and America.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Froude, _Carlyle, Life in London_, vol. ii, pp. 100 and\r\n217.]\r\n\r\nWhen this was finished, Carlyle was on the verge of seventy and his work\r\nwas done; though the evening of his life was long, his strength was\r\nexhausted. His wife lived just long enough to see the seal set upon his\r\nfame, and to hear of his election to be Lord Rector of Edinburgh\r\nUniversity. But in April 1866, while he was in Scotland for his\r\ninstallation, which she was too weak to attend, he heard the news of her\r\nsudden death from heart failure in London; and after this he was a\r\nbroken man. By reading her journal he learnt, too late, how much his\r\nown inconsiderate temper had added to her trials, and his remorse was\r\nbitter and lasting. He shut himself off from all his friends except\r\nFroude, who was to be his literary executor, and gave himself to\r\ncollecting and annotating the memorials which she had left. Each letter\r\nis followed by some words of tender recollection or some cry of\r\nself-reproach. He has erected to her the most singular of literary\r\nmonuments, morbid perhaps, but inspired by a feeling which was in his\r\ncase natural and sincere.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870 he began to lose the use of his right hand and he found it\r\nimpossible to compose by dictation. Of the last years of his life there\r\nis little to narrate. The offer of a baronetcy or the G.C.B. from Mr.\r\nDisraeli in 1874 pleased him for the moment, but he resolutely refused\r\nexternal honours. He took daily walks with Froude, daily drives when he\r\nbecame too weak to go on foot. Towards the end the Bible and Shakespeare\r\nwere his most habitual reading. He had long ceased to be a member of any\r\nchurch, but his belief in God and in God's working in history was the\r\nvery foundation of his being, and the lessons of the Bible were to him\r\ninexhaustible and ever new. Death came to him peacefully in February,\r\n1881; and as he had expressed a definite wish, he was buried at\r\nEcclefechan, though a public funeral in the Abbey was offered and its\r\nacceptance would have met with the approval of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe very wealth of records makes it difficult to judge his character\r\nfairly. Few men have so laid bare the thoughts and feelings of their\r\nhearts. It is easy to blame the unmanly laments which he utters over his\r\nhealth, his solitude, and his sufferings, real or imaginary; few\r\nimaginative writers have the every-day virtues. His egotism, too, is\r\ndifficult to defend. If, as he himself admits, he invariably took an\r\nundue share of talk, often in fact monopolizing it, wherever he was, we\r\nmust remember that the brilliance of his gifts was admitted by all;\r\nless pardonable is his habit of disparaging other men, and especially\r\nother men of letters. His pen-pictures of Mill, Wordsworth, Coleridge,\r\nand others, are wonderfully vivid but too often sour in flavour; his\r\nsketch of Charles Lamb is an outrage on that generous and kindly soul.\r\nToo often he was unconscious of the pain given by such random words.\r\nWhen he was brought to book, he was honourable enough to recant. Fearing\r\non one occasion to have offended even the serene loyalty of Emerson, he\r\ncries out protestingly, 'Has not the man Emerson, from old years, been a\r\nHuman Friend to me? Can I ever forget, or think otherwise than lovingly\r\nof the man Emerson?'\r\n\r\nBut whatever offence Carlyle committed with his ungovernable tongue or\r\npen, he had rare virtues in conduct. His generosity was as unassuming as\r\nit was persistent; and it began at home. Long before he was free from\r\nanxieties about money for himself, he was helping two of his brothers to\r\nmake a career, one in agriculture, and the other in medicine. In his\r\nlatter days he regularly gave away large sums in such a way that no one\r\nknew the source from which they came. His letters show a deep tenderness\r\nof affection for his mother, his wife, and others of the family; and the\r\nhumble Annandale home was always in his thoughts. His charity embraced\r\neven those whose claim on him was but indirect. When his wife was dead,\r\nhe could remember to celebrate her birthday by sending a present to her\r\nold nurse. He was scrupulous in money-dealing and frugal in all matters\r\nof personal comfort; in his innermost thoughts he was always\r\npure-hearted and sincere; for nothing on earth would he traffic in his\r\nindependence or in adherence to the truth.\r\n\r\nHis style has not largely influenced other historians; and this is as\r\nwell, since imitations of it easily fall into mere obscurity and\r\nextravagance. But his historical method has been of great value, the\r\npatient study of original authorities, the copious references quoted,\r\nthe careful indexing, all being proof how anxious he was that the\r\nsubject should be presented clearly and veraciously, rather than that\r\nthe books should shine as literary performances. How far the principles\r\nwhich he valued and taught have spread it is difficult to say. Party\r\npoliticians still appeal to the sacred name of liberty without inquiring\r\nwhat true liberty means; publicists still speak as if the material gains\r\nof modern life, cheap food and machine-made products, meant nothing but\r\nadvance in the history of the human race; but there are others who look\r\nto the spiritual factors and wish to enlarge the bounds of political\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Carlyle, and of Ruskin, on whom fell the prophet's\r\nmantle, certainly made their influence felt in later books devoted to\r\nthat once 'dismal' science. Few can be quite indifferent to the man or\r\nto his message. Those who demand moderation, clearness, and Attic\r\nsimplicity, will be repelled by his extravagances or by his mysticism.\r\nOthers will be attracted by his glowing imagination and by his fiery\r\neloquence, and will reserve for him a foremost place in their\r\naffections. These will echo the words which Emerson was heard to say on\r\nhis death-bed, when his eyes fell on a portrait of the familiar rugged\r\nfeatures, '_That_ is the man, my man'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ROBERT PEEL\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by J.

In the nineteenth century\r\nthere were many gifted statesmen who held the position of first\r\nminister of the Crown. Disraeli and Palmerston by shrewdness and force\r\nof character, Canning and Derby by brilliant oratorical gifts, Russell\r\nand Aberdeen by earnest devotion to public service, were all commanding\r\nfigures in their day, whose claims to the chieftainship of a party and\r\nof a government were generally admitted. Gladstone, the most versatile\r\ngenius of them all, had abilities second to none; but his place in\r\nhistory will for long be a subject of acute controversy. He stands too\r\nclose to our own time to be fairly judged. Of the others no one had the\r\nsame combination of gifts as Sir Robert Peel, no one had in the same\r\nmeasure that particular knowledge, judgement, and ability which\r\ncharacterize the _statesman_. His career was the most fruitful, his work\r\nthe most enduring: he has left his mark in English history to a degree\r\nwhich no one of his rivals can equal.\r\n\r\nThe Peel family can be traced back to the misty days of Danish inroads.\r\nIts original home in England is disputed between Yorkshire and\r\nLancashire; but as early as the days of Elizabeth the branch from which\r\nour statesman was descended is certainly to be found at Blackburn, and\r\nits members lived for generations as sturdy yeomen of that district. The\r\nfirst of them known to strike out an independent line was his\r\ngrandfather, Robert Peel, who with his brother-in-law, Mr. Haworth,\r\nstarted the first firm for calico-printing in Lancashire about the year\r\n1760, ceasing the practice of sending the material to be printed in\r\nFrance. This grandfather was a type of the men who were making the new\r\nEngland, leading the way in the creation of industries that were to\r\ntransform the North and Midlands. The business prospered and he moved\r\nfrom Blackburn to Burton-on-Trent, where he built three new mills. His\r\nthird son, named Robert, was also gifted with resource. Beginning as a\r\nmember of the family firm, he soon came to be its chief director, and\r\nadded another branch at Tamworth, where later he built the house of\r\nDrayton Manor, the family seat in the nineteenth century. He was a Tory\r\nand a staunch follower of the younger Pitt, who rewarded his services\r\nwith a baronetcy in 1800. He too was a typical man of his age and class,\r\nan age of material progress and expansion, a class full of\r\nself-confidence and animated by a spirit of stubborn resistance to\r\nso-called un-English ideas. His eldest son, the third Robert and the\r\nsecond baronet, is our subject. It is impossible to grasp the springs of\r\nhis conduct unless we know what traditions he inherited from his\r\nforbears.\r\n\r\nPeel's education was begun at home with a specific purpose. Though his\r\nfather had every reason to be satisfied with his own success, for his\r\nson he cherished a yet higher ambition and one which he did not conceal.\r\nHe said openly that he intended him to be Prime Minister of his country.\r\nThe knowledge of this provoked many jests among the boy's friends and\r\ncaused him no slight embarrassment. It conspired with the shyness and\r\nreserve, which were innate in him, to win him from the outset a\r\nreputation for pride and aloofness. If he had not been forced to mix\r\nwith those of his own age, and if he had not resolutely set himself to\r\novercome this feeling, he might have grown into a student and a recluse.\r\nBoth at school and college he did 'attend to his book': at Harrow he\r\nroused the greatest hopes. His brilliant schoolfellow, Lord Byron, while\r\nclaiming to excel him in general information and history, admits that\r\nPeel was greatly his superior as a scholar. The working of their minds,\r\nnow and afterwards, was curiously different. Bagehot[6] illustrates the\r\ncontrast by a striking metaphor: Byron's mind, he says, worked by\r\nmomentary eruptions of volcanic force from within and then relapsed into\r\ninactivity. Peel on the other hand steadily accumulated knowledge and\r\nopinions, his mind receiving impressions from outward experience like\r\nthe alluvial soil deposited by a river in its course. But this is to\r\nanticipate. At Oxford Peel was the first man to win a 'Double First'\r\n(i.e. a first class both in classics and mathematics), in which\r\ndistinction Gladstone alone, among our Prime Ministers, equalled him.\r\nBut he also found time during the term to indulge in cricket, in rowing,\r\nand in riding, while in the vacation he developed a more marked taste\r\nfor shooting, and thus freed himself from the charge of being a mere\r\nbookworm. He was good-looking, rather a dandy in his dress, stiff in his\r\nmanner, regular in his habits, conforming to the Oxford standards of\r\nexcellence and as yet showing few signs of independence of character.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Walter Bagehot, _Biographical Studies_, p. 17 (Longmans,\r\n1907).]\r\n\r\nPeel went into Parliament early, after the fashion of the day. He was\r\ntwenty-one when, in 1809, a seat was offered him at Cashel in Ireland.\r\nThe system of 'rotten boroughs' had many faults--our text-books of\r\nhistory do not spare it--but it may claim to have offered an easy way\r\ninto Parliament for some men of brilliant talents. Peel's family\r\nconnexions and his own training marked out the path for him. It was\r\ndifficult for the young Oxford prizeman not to follow Lord Chancellor\r\nEldon, that stout survival of the high old Tories: it was impossible for\r\nhis father's son not to sit behind the successors of Pitt. We shall see\r\nhow far his own reasoning powers and clear vision led him from this\r\npath; but the early influences were never quite effaced. His first\r\npatron was Lord Liverpool, to whom he became private secretary in the\r\nfollowing year. This nobleman, described by Disraeli in a famous passage\r\nas an 'arch-mediocrity' was Prime Minister for fifteen years. He owed\r\nhis long tenure of office largely to the tolerance with which he allowed\r\nhis abler lieutenants to usurp his power: perhaps he owed it still more\r\nto the victories which Wellington was then winning abroad and which\r\nsecured the confidence of the country; but at least he seems to have\r\nbeen a good judge of men. In 1811 he promoted Peel to be\r\nUnder-Secretary for the Colonies, and in 1812 to be Chief Secretary for\r\nIreland. His abilities must have made a great impression to win him such\r\npromotion: he must have had plenty of self-confidence to undertake such\r\nduties, for he was only twenty-four years old. We are accustomed to-day\r\nto under-secretaries of forty or forty-five; but we must remember that\r\nthe younger Pitt led the House of Commons at twenty-four and was Prime\r\nMinister at twenty-five.\r\n\r\nAt Dublin Castle Peel was not expected to deal with the great political\r\nquestions which convulsed Parliament at different periods of the\r\ncentury. He had to administer the law. It was routine work of a tedious\r\nand difficult kind; it involved the close study of facts--not in order\r\nto make a showy speech or to win a case for the moment, but in order to\r\nframe practical measures which would stand the test of time. Peel\r\neschewed the usual recreations of Dublin society, and flung himself into\r\nhis work whole-heartedly. In Roman history we see how Caesar was trained\r\nin the details of administration as quaestor, aedile, praetor, consul,\r\nwhile Pompeius passed in a lordly progress from one high command to\r\nanother; how Caesar voluntarily exiled himself from Rome for ten years\r\nto conquer and develop Gaul, while Cicero bewailed himself over a few\r\nmonths' absence from the Forum. Of these three famous men only one\r\nproved himself able to guide the ship of state in stormy waters. Analogy\r\nmust not be too closely pressed; but we see that, while Canning for all\r\nhis ability established no durable influence, and his oratory burnt\r\nitself out after a brief blaze, while Wellington's fame paled year after\r\nyear from his inability to control the course of civil strife, Peel's\r\nlight burnt brighter every decade, as he rose from office to office and\r\nfaced one difficult situation after another with coolness and success.\r\nHe stayed at his post in Dublin for six years: he worked at the details\r\nof his office--education, agriculture, and police--and brought in many\r\npractical reforms. His beneficial activity is still better seen in the\r\nyears 1821 to 1827 when he was Home Secretary. To-day he is chiefly\r\nremembered as the eponymous hero of our police; but in many other ways\r\nhis tenure of the latter office is a landmark in departmental work. It\r\nmay be that he originated little himself: that Romilly was the pioneer\r\nin the humanizing of law, that Horner taught him the doctrines of sound\r\nfinance, that Huskisson led the way in freeing trade from the shackles\r\nwith which it had been bound. But Peel in all these cases lent generous\r\nsupport and made their cause his own. He had a cool head and a warm\r\nheart, a knowledge of Parliament and an influence in Parliament already\r\nunrivalled. He saw what could be done, and how it could be done, and so\r\nhe was able to push through successfully the reforms which his\r\ncolleagues initiated. The value of his work in this sphere has never\r\nbeen seriously contested.\r\n\r\nThe point on which Peel's enemies fastened in judging his career was the\r\nnumber of times that he changed his convictions, abandoned his party,\r\nand carried through a measure which he himself had formerly opposed. To\r\nunderstand his claim to be called a great statesman it is particularly\r\nnecessary to study these changes.\r\n\r\nThe first instance was the Reform of the Currency. Early in the French\r\nwars the London banks had been in difficulties. The Government was\r\nforced to borrow large sums from the Bank of England in order to give\r\nsubsidies to our allies, and was unable to pay its debts. The Bank could\r\nnot at the same time meet the demands of the Government and the claims\r\nof its private customers. Since a panic might at any moment cause an\r\nunprecedented run on its reserves, Pitt suspended cash payments till six\r\nmonths after the conclusion of peace. The Bank was thus allowed to\r\ncirculate notes without being obliged to pay full cash value for them\r\nimmediately on demand, and the purchasing power of these notes tended to\r\nvary far more than that of a metal currency. Also foreigners refused to\r\naccept a pound note in the place of a pound sterling; foreign payments\r\nhad to be made in specie, and the gold was rapidly drained abroad. When\r\nthe war was over, Horner and other economists began to draw attention to\r\nthe bad effect of this on foreign trade and to the varying price of\r\ncommodities at home, due to the want of a fixed currency. As Pitt had\r\nallowed the system of inconvertible paper, the Tories generally\r\napplauded and were ready to perpetuate it. The elder Sir Robert Peel had\r\nbeen always a firm supporter of these views and his son began by\r\naccepting them. He continued to acquiesce in them till his attention was\r\ndefinitely turned to the subject. In 1819 he was asked to be a member of\r\na committee of very eminent men, including Canning and Mackintosh, which\r\nwas to investigate the question, and he was elected chairman of it. But,\r\nthough his verdict was taken for granted by his party, his mind was so\r\nconstituted that he could not shut it against evidence. He listened to\r\narguments, and judged them fairly; and, being by nature unable to palter\r\nwith the truth, once he was convinced of it, he threw in all his weight\r\nwith the reformers and reported in favour of a return to cash payments.\r\nHistory has vindicated his judgement, and he himself crowned his\r\nfinancial work by the famous Bank Act of 1844, passed when he was Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nThe second question on which Peel's conduct surprised his colleagues was\r\nthat of Catholic Emancipation. Since 1793 Roman Catholic electors had\r\nthe parliamentary vote; but, since no Roman Catholic could sit in\r\nParliament, they had hitherto been content to cast their votes for the\r\nmore tolerant of the Protestant candidates. Pitt had failed to induce\r\nGeorge III to grant the Catholics civil equality, and George IV, despite\r\nhis liberal professions, took up the same attitude as his father on\r\nsucceeding to the throne. But the majority of the Whigs, and some even\r\nof the Tories, such as Castlereagh and Canning, were prepared to make\r\nconcessions; and since 1820 the Irish agitation led by O'Connell had\r\nbeen gaining in strength. Peel had several reasons for being on the\r\nother side. His early training by his father, his friendship with Eldon\r\nand Wellington, his attachment to the Established Church, all had\r\ninfluence upon him. He saw clearly that Disestablishment would follow\r\nclosely in Ireland on the granting of the Catholic demands; and since\r\n1817, when he became Member for Oxford University, he felt bound to\r\nresist this. In taking this line he was no better and no worse than any\r\nother Tory member of the day; and in later times many politicians have\r\nallowed their traditions and prejudices to blind them to the existence\r\nof an Irish problem.\r\n\r\nFor all that, Peel ought earlier to have recognized the facts, to have\r\nlooked ahead and formed a policy. As Chief Secretary for Ireland he had\r\nunrivalled opportunities for studying the whole question; but he did not\r\nlet it penetrate beneath the surface of his mind. He had continued to\r\nbring up the same arguments on the few occasions when he spoke at\r\nWestminster, and had buried himself in administrative work. He seems to\r\nhave hoped that he could evade it. If the Whigs got a majority and\r\nintroduced an Emancipation Bill, he would have satisfied his\r\nconstituents by formally opposing the measure and would not have gone\r\nbeyond this. As he saw it gradually coming, he satisfied his own\r\nconscience by retiring from Lord Liverpool's Government and by refusing\r\nto join Canning, when he became Prime Minister in 1827. As a private\r\nmember he would only be responsible for his own vote, and would not feel\r\nthat he was settling the question for others. But Canning died after\r\nholding office only a month, and a Government was formed by Wellington\r\nin which Peel returned to office as Home Secretary and became leader of\r\nthe House of Commons. Now he had to pay the penalty for his lack of\r\nforesight, and to deal with the tide of feeling which had been rising\r\nfor some years on both sides of the Irish Channel. At least he could see\r\nfacts which were before his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, before he had been twelve months in office, his decision was\r\naided by a definite event. A by-election had to be fought in Clare, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald seeking re-election on joining the Government. Against him\r\ncame forward no less a person than Daniel O'Connell himself, the most\r\neloquent and most popular of the Catholic leaders; and, although under\r\nthe existing laws his candidature was void, he received an overwhelming\r\nmajority. The bewilderment of the Tories was ludicrous. Fitzgerald\r\nhimself wrote, 'The proceedings of yesterday were those of madmen; but\r\nthe country is mad.' Peel took a careful view of the situation and\r\ndecided on his course. He certainly laid himself open to the charge of\r\ngiving way before a breach of the law, and the charge was pressed by the\r\nangry Tories. But his judgement was clearly based on a complete survey\r\nof all the facts. A single event was the candle which lit up the scene,\r\nbut by the light of it he surveyed the whole room. He still held to his\r\nview about the dangers of Disestablishment ahead, but he maintained that\r\na crisis had arisen involving graver dangers at the moment, and that the\r\nstatesman must choose the lesser of two evils. There is no doubt that\r\nthe situation was critical. The Duke of Wellington and Lord Anglesey (a\r\nWaterloo veteran, who was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland) both had fears of\r\nmutiny in the army; and civil war was to be expected, if O'Connell was\r\nnot admitted to the House of Commons. Peel's personal consistency was\r\none matter; the public welfare was another and a weightier. His first\r\nidea was to retire from office and to lend unofficial support to a\r\nmeasure which he could not advocate in principle. But the only hope of\r\nbreaking down the old Tory opposition lay in the influence of the Tory\r\nministers; no Whig Government could prevail in the temper of that time;\r\nand Wellington appealed in the strongest terms to Peel to remain in\r\noffice and to lead the House. Peel yielded from motives of public policy\r\nand made himself responsible for a measure of Catholic Emancipation,\r\nwhich he had been pledged to resist.\r\n\r\nIt was a surrender--an undisguised surrender--and Peel did not, as on\r\nthe Bullion Committee, profess to have changed his mind. But it was an\r\nhonest surrender carried out in the light of day; and, before Parliament\r\nmet, Peel announced his decision to resign his seat at Oxford and to\r\ngive his constituents the chance of expressing their opinion of his\r\nconduct. The verdict was not long in doubt: the University, which in\r\n1865 rejected another of its brilliant sons, gave a majority of one\r\nhundred and forty-six against him, and his political connexion with\r\nOxford was severed. The verdict of posterity has been more liberal. The\r\nchief fault laid to Peel's charge is that he should for so many years\r\nhave ignored all signs of the danger which was approaching, and not have\r\nmade up his mind in time. He could see the crisis clearly, when it came,\r\nand could put the national interest above everything else: he could not\r\nlook far enough ahead.\r\n\r\nIt was a similar want of foresight that led to the fall of the Tory\r\nGovernment in 1830. The Reform movement, so long delayed by the great\r\nwars, had been gathering force again. Events in France, where Charles X\r\nwas driven from the throne and Louis Philippe proclaimed as\r\nCitizen-king, gave it additional impetus. The famous lawyer Brougham was\r\nthundering against the Government in Parliament, while throughout the\r\ncountry the platforms from which Radical orators declaimed were\r\nsurrounded by eager throngs. The history of the movement cannot be told\r\nhere. Its chief actors were the Whigs, who on Wellington's resignation\r\nformed a Government under Earl Grey at the end of 1830. Peel was\r\nfighting a losing fight and he did not show his usual judgement or cool\r\ntemper. He opposed the Reform Bill to the last: he was haranguing\r\nviolently against it when Black Rod arrived to summon the Commons to the\r\npresence of the King. William IV came down in person, at the instance of\r\nthe Whig ministers, to dissolve Parliament and so to stay all\r\nproceedings by which, in the as yet unreformed Parliament, the Bill\r\nmight have been defeated. In the General Election of 1831 the Whigs\r\ncarried all before them, and in July, when Lord Grey carried the second\r\nreading, he could command a majority of 136. Even then it took three\r\nmonths of stubborn fighting to vanquish the Tory opposition in the House\r\nof Commons. When the Peers rejected the Bill, the question was raised\r\nwhether a Tory Government could be formed; but Peel, however he might\r\ndislike the Bill, could recognize facts, and his refusal to co-operate\r\nin defying public opinion was decisive. Lord Grey returned to office\r\nfortified by the King's promise to make any number of new peers, if\r\nrequired; and the influence of Wellington was effective in dissuading\r\nthe Upper House from further futile resistance. Again Peel had shown his\r\ngood sense in accepting the situation. So far as he was concerned, there\r\nwas no talk of repeal. He explicitly said that he regarded the question\r\nas 'finally and irrevocably disposed of', and he set to work to adapt\r\nhis policy to the new situation.\r\n\r\nIt might well seem a desperate one for the Tories. Here were three\r\nhundred new members, most of whom had just received their seats from the\r\nWhigs against the direct opposition of their rivals. Gratitude and\r\nself-interest impelled them to support the Whig party; and its leaders,\r\nwho had for nearly fifty years been out in the cold shade of opposition,\r\nmight count on a long spell of power, especially as the Canningites,\r\nstronger in talents than in numbers, joined them at this juncture.\r\nBrougham had gone to the House of Lords, but three future Prime\r\nMinisters--Stanley (afterwards Lord Derby), Lord John Russell, and\r\nPalmerston--were in the House of Commons serving under Lord Althorp,\r\nwho, though gifted with no oratorical talent, by his good sense and\r\nstill more by his high character, commanded general respect. On the\r\nother side there was only one figure of the first rank, and that was\r\nPeel. Till 1832 he had not grown to his full stature: the Reformed\r\nParliament gave him his chance and drew forth all his powers. It\r\nrepresented a new force in politics. No longer were the members sent to\r\nWestminster by a few great land-holders, by the small market towns, and\r\nby the agricultural labourers. The great industrial districts,\r\nLancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands, were there in the persons of\r\nwell-to-do citizens, experienced in business and serious in temper; and\r\nPeel, who was himself sprung from a notable family of this kind, was\r\neminently the man to lead these classes and to win their confidence. It\r\nwas also a gain to him to stand alone. His judgement was ripened, his\r\nconfidence firm; and he could dominate his party, while the able and\r\nambitious leaders on the other side too often clashed with one another.\r\nAbove all, in the years 1832 to 1834, he showed that he had patience.\r\nInstead of snatching at occasions to ally himself with O'Connell, who\r\nwas in opposition to every Government, and to embarrass the Whigs in a\r\nfactious party-spirit, he showed a marked respect for principle. He\r\nsupported or opposed the Whig bills purely on their merits, and\r\ngradually trained his party to be ready for the inevitable reaction when\r\nit should come.\r\n\r\nBy 1834 the tendencies to disruption in the victorious party were\r\nclearly showing themselves. First Stanley, on grounds of policy, and\r\nthen Lord Grey, for personal reasons never quite cleared up, resigned\r\noffice. Soon after, Lord Althorp left the House of Commons on\r\nsucceeding to his father's earldom, and a little later Melbourne, the\r\nnew Premier, was unexpectedly dismissed by the King. At the time Peel,\r\nexpecting no immediate crisis, was abroad, in Rome; and we have\r\ninteresting details of his slow journey home to meet the urgent call of\r\nWellington, who was carrying on the administration provisionally. The\r\nchanges of the last few years were shown by the fact that the Tories\r\nfelt bound to choose their Premier from the Lower House. It was\r\nWellington who recommended Peel for the place which, under the old\r\nconditions, he might have been expected to take himself. On his return,\r\nPeel accepted the task of forming a ministry, and, conscious of the\r\nnumerical weakness of his own party, he made overtures to some of the\r\nWhigs. But Stanley and Graham[7] refused to join him, and he had to fall\r\nback on the Tories of Wellington's last Government. Before going to the\r\ncountry he laid down his principles in the famous Tamworth Manifesto.[8]\r\nThis manifesto is important for its acceptance of the changes\r\npermanently made by the Reform Bill, and for the clear exposition of his\r\nattitude towards the important Church questions which were imminent. It\r\nis an excellent document for any one to study who wishes to understand\r\nthe evolution of the old Tories into the modern Conservative party.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Sir James Graham, afterwards Home Secretary under Peel in\r\n1841.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Since his father's death, in 1830, Peel had been member for\r\nTamworth.]\r\n\r\nPeel's first administration was not destined to last long. The Liberal\r\nwave was not spent, and the Tories had little to hope for, at this\r\nmoment, from a General Election. As so often happened afterwards, when\r\nthe two English parties were evenly balanced, the Irish votes turned the\r\nscale. Peel had been forced into this position by the King: his own\r\njudgement would have led him to wait some years. He fought dexterously\r\nfor four months, helped in some measure by Stanley, who had left the\r\nWhigs when they threatened the Established Church in Ireland; but it was\r\nthis question which in the end upset him. Lord John Russell, in alliance\r\nwith O'Connell, proposed the disendowment of that Church and defeated\r\nPeel by thirty-three votes. It was a question of principle, though it\r\nwas raised in a factious way, and subsequent history showed that the\r\nmover, after his tactical victory of the moment, could not effect any\r\npractical solution. Peel was driven to resign. But in this short period,\r\nso far from losing credit, he had won the confidence of his party and\r\nthe respect of his opponents; he had put some useful measures on the\r\nStatute Book; and he had shown the country that a new spirit, practical\r\nand enlightened, was growing up in the Tory party, and that there was a\r\nminister capable of utilizing it for the general good.\r\n\r\nIn the Greville papers and other literature of the time we get many\r\nreferences to the predominant place which he held in the esteem of the\r\nHouse of Commons. An entry in Greville's journal for February 1834 shows\r\nPeel's unique power. 'No matter how unruly the House, how impatient or\r\nfatigued, the moment he rises, all is silence, and he is sure of being\r\nheard with profound attention and respect.' Lady Lyttelton,[9] who met\r\nhim later at Windsor, shows us another aspect. His readiness and\r\npresence of mind come out in the most trivial matters. When Queen\r\nVictoria suddenly, one evening, issued her command that all who could\r\ndance were to dance, the more elderly guests were much embarrassed. Such\r\nan order was not to Peel's taste. 'He was, in fact, to a close observer,\r\nevidently both shy and cross'; but he was 'much the best figure of all,\r\nso mincing with his legs and feet, his countenance full of the funniest\r\nattempt to look unconcerned and \"matter of course\".' Another time when\r\ngames were improvised in the royal circle, Lady Lyttelton was 'much\r\nstruck with the quickness and watchful cautious characteristic sagacity\r\nwhich Sir Robert showed in learning and playing a new round game'. And\r\nto the ladies-in-waiting he commended himself by his quiet courtesy.\r\n'Sir Robert Peel', we read, 'was in his most conversable mood and so\r\nvery agreeable. I never enjoyed an evening more.'\r\n\r\n[Note 9: _Correspondence of Sarah, Lady Lyttelton_, by Maud Wyndham\r\n(Murray, 1912).]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best description to show how personally he impressed his\r\ncontemporaries at this time is given by Lord Dalling and Bulwer in his\r\nmemoir. Sir Robert Peel, he tells us, was 'tall and powerfully built,\r\nhis body somewhat bulky for his limbs, his head small and well-formed,\r\nhis features regular. His countenance was not what would be generally\r\ncalled expressive, but it was capable of taking the expression he wished\r\nto give it, humour, sarcasm, persuasion, and command, being its\r\nalternate characteristics. The character of the man was seen more... in\r\nthe whole person than in the face. He did not stoop, but he bent rather\r\nforwards; his mode of walking was peculiar, and rather like that of a\r\ncat, but of a cat that was well acquainted with the ground it was moving\r\nover; the step showed no doubt or apprehension, it could hardly be\r\ncalled stealthy, but it glided on firmly and cautiously, without haste,\r\nor swagger, or unevenness.... The oftener you heard him speak, the more\r\nhis speaking gained upon you.... He never seemed occupied with himself.\r\nHis effort was evidently directed to convince you, not that he was\r\n_eloquent_, but that he was _right_.... He seemed rather to aim at\r\ngaining the doubtful, than mortifying or crushing the hostile.' These\r\nqualities appealed especially to the practical men of business whom the\r\nReform Bill had brought into politics. They were suited to the temper of\r\nthe day, and his speaking won the favour of the best judges in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Though he disappointed ardent crusaders like Lord\r\nShaftesbury by his apparent coldness and calculating caution, he\r\nimpressed his fellow members as pre-eminently honest and as anxious to\r\nadvance in the most effective manner those causes which his judgement\r\napproved. He was not the man to lead a forlorn hope, but rather the\r\nsagacious commander who directed his troops through a practicable\r\nbreach.\r\n\r\nHe was to be in opposition for another six years; but during these years\r\nthe Whigs were in constant difficulties, and, as Greville notes, it was\r\noften obvious that Peel was leading the House from the front Opposition\r\nbench. Had he imitated Russell's conduct in 1834 and devoted his chief\r\nenergies to overthrowing the Whigs, he could have found many an\r\noccasion. Sedition in Canada and Jamaica, rivalry with France in the\r\nLevant and with Russia in the Farther East, financial troubles and\r\ndeficits, the spread of Chartist doctrine, all combined to embarrass a\r\nGovernment which had no single will and no concentrated resolution. The\r\naccession of Queen Victoria, in 1837, made no change for the moment. But\r\nWellington's famous remark that the Tories would have no chance with a\r\nQueen because Peel had no manners and he had no small talk, is only\r\nquoted now because of the falsity of the prediction; both politicians\r\nsoon came to form a better estimate of her judgement and public spirit.\r\nIt was some years before this could be fairly tested. The Tories, while\r\nimproving their position, failed to gain an absolute majority in the\r\nelections, and Peel's want of tact in insisting on the Queen changing\r\nall the ladies of her household delayed his triumph from 1839 to 1841.\r\nMeanwhile he spent his energies in training his party and organizing\r\ntheir resources. He studied measures and he studied men, and he\r\ngradually gathered round him a body of loyal followers who believed in\r\ntheir chief and were ready to help him in administrative reform when\r\nthe time should come. Among his most devoted adherents was Mr.\r\nGladstone, at this time more famous as a churchman than as a financier;\r\nand even Mr. Disraeli, for all his eccentricities, accepted Peel's\r\nleadership without question. Few could then foresee the very different\r\ncareers that lay before his two brilliant lieutenants.\r\n\r\nBy 1841 the power of the Whigs was spent. A vote of want of confidence\r\nwas carried by Peel, the King dissolved Parliament, and the Tories came\r\nback with a majority of ninety in the new House of Commons. Now begins\r\nthe most famous part of Peel's career, that associated with the Repeal\r\nof the Corn Laws, the third of his so-called 'betrayals' of his party.\r\nNo action of his has been so variously criticized, none caused such\r\nbitterness in political circles. There is no space here to discuss the\r\nvalue of Protection or the wisdom of the Anti-Corn-Law League, still\r\nless the merits or demerits of a fixed duty as opposed to a\r\n'sliding-scale'. We are concerned with Peel's conduct and must try to\r\nanswer the questions--What were Peel's earlier views on the subject?\r\nWhat caused him to change these views? Was this change effected\r\nhonestly, or was he guilty of abandoning his party in order to retain\r\noffice himself?\r\n\r\nThe Corn Laws, introduced in 1670, re-enacted in 1815, forbade any one\r\nto import corn into England till the price of home-grown corn had\r\nreached eighty shillings a quarter. It is easy to attack a system based\r\non rigid figures applied to conditions varying widely in every century;\r\nbut the idea was that the English farmer should be given a decisive\r\nadvantage over his foreign rivals, and only when the price rose to a\r\nprohibitive point might the interest of the consumer be allowed to\r\noutweigh that of the producer. The revival of the old law in 1815 met\r\nwith strong opposition. England had greatly changed; the agricultural\r\narea had not been widely increased, but there were many more millions of\r\nmouths to feed, thanks to the growth of population in the industrial\r\ndistricts. But while in 1815 the House of Commons represented almost\r\nexclusively the land-owning and corn-growing classes, between 1815 and\r\n1840 opposition to their policy had lately been growing and had been\r\norganized, outside Parliament, by the famous league of which Richard\r\nCobden was the leading spirit. Peel, though he had been brought up by\r\nhis father a strong Protectionist and Tory, had been largely influenced\r\nby Huskisson, the most remarkable President of the Board of Trade that\r\nthis country has ever seen, and had shown on many occasions that he\r\ngrasped the principle of Free Trade as well as any statesman of the day.\r\nThe Whigs had left the finances of the country in a very bad state, and\r\nPeel had to take sweeping measures to restore credit. From 1842 to 1845\r\nhe brought in Budgets of a Free Trade character, designed to encourage\r\ncommerce by remitting taxation, especially on raw material; and he made\r\nup the loss thus incurred by the Treasury, by imposing an income-tax. To\r\nthis policy there were two exceptions, the Corn Laws and the Sugar\r\nDuties. On the latter he felt that England, since she had abolished\r\nslave-owning, had a duty to her colonies to see that they did not suffer\r\nby the competition of sugar produced by slave labour elsewhere. On the\r\nformer he held that England ought, so far as possible, to produce its\r\nown food and to be self-sufficing; and as a practical man he recognized\r\nthat it was too much to expect of the agricultural interest, so strongly\r\nrepresented in both Houses of Parliament, to pronounce what seemed to be\r\nits death-warrant. But through these years he came more and more to see\r\nthat the interest of a class must give way to the interest of the\r\nnation; and his clear intellect was from time to time shaken by the\r\narguments of the Anti-Corn-Law League and its orators. In 1845 he was\r\nprobably expecting that he would tide over this Parliament, thanks to\r\nhis Budgets and to good harvests, and that at a general election he\r\nwould be able to declare for a change of fiscal policy without going\r\nback on his pledges to the party. Meanwhile his general attitude had\r\nbeen noted by shrewd observers. Cobden himself in a speech delivered at\r\nBirmingham said, 'There can be no doubt that Sir Robert Peel is at heart\r\nas good a Free Trader as I am. He has told us so in the House of Commons\r\nagain and again.'\r\n\r\nAmong the causes which influenced Peel at the moment two are specially\r\nnoteworthy as reminding us of the way in which his opinion was changed\r\nover Catholic Emancipation. Severe critics say that, to retain office,\r\nhe surrendered to the agitation of Cobden, as he had surrendered to that\r\nof O'Connell. Undoubtedly the increasing size and success of Cobden's\r\nmeetings, which were on a scale unknown before in political agitation,\r\ndid cause Peel to consider fully what he had only half considered\r\nbefore: it did help to force open a door in his mind, and to break down\r\na water-tight compartment. But Peel's mind, once opened, saw far more\r\nthan an agitation and a transfer of votes: it looked at the merits of\r\nthe question and surveyed the interest of the whole country. He had seen\r\nthat the fall of a Protestant Church was less serious than the loss of\r\nIreland: he now saw that a shock to the agricultural interest was less\r\nserious than general starvation in the country. And as with the Clare\r\nelection, so with the Irish potato famine in 1845: a definite event\r\narrested his attention and clamoured for instant decision. Peel was as\r\nhumane a man as has ever presided over the destinies of this country,\r\nand the picture of Ireland's sufferings was brought forcibly before his\r\nimagination by the reports presented to him and by his own knowledge of\r\nthe country. His personal consistency could not be put in the balance\r\nagainst national distress.\r\n\r\nThat the manner in which he made the change did give great offence to\r\nhis followers, there is no room to doubt. Peel was naturally reserved in\r\nmanner and in his Cabinet he occupied a position of such unquestioned\r\nsuperiority that he had no need of advice to make up his mind, and was\r\napt to keep matters in his own hand. Whether he was preparing to consult\r\nhis colleagues or not, the Irish potato famine forced his hand before he\r\nhad done so. When in November 1845 he made suddenly in the Cabinet a\r\ndefinite proposal to suspend the duties on corn, only three members\r\nsupported him. Year after year Peel had opposed the motion brought in by\r\nMr. Villiers[10] for repeal: only those who had been studying the\r\nsituation as closely as Peel and with as clear a vision--and they were\r\nfew--could understand this sudden declaration of a change of policy.\r\nAfter holding four Cabinet councils in one week, winning over some\r\nwaverers, but still failing to get a unanimous vote, he expressed a wish\r\nto resign. But the Whigs, owing to personal disagreements, could not\r\nform a ministry and Queen Victoria asked Peel to retain office: it was\r\nevident that he alone could carry through the measure which he believed\r\nto be so urgent, and he steeled himself to face the breach with his own\r\nparty. As Lord John Russell had already pledged the Whigs to repeal, the\r\nissue was no longer in doubt; but Peel was not to win the victory\r\nwithout heavy cost. Disraeli, who had been offended at not being given a\r\nplace in the ministry in 1841, came forward, rallied the agricultural\r\ninterest, and attacked his leader in a series of bitter speeches,\r\nopening old sores, and charging him with having for the second time\r\nbroken his pledges and betrayed his party. The Protectionists could not\r\ndefeat the Government. In the Commons the Whig votes ensured a\r\nmajority: in the Lords the influence of Wellington triumphed over the\r\nresistance of the more obstinate landowners. The Bill passed its third\r\nreading by ninety-eight votes.\r\n\r\n[Note 10: The Right Hon. C. P. Villiers, M.P. for Wolverhampton,\r\nbegan to advocate repeal in 1837, four years before Cobden entered\r\nParliament.]\r\n\r\nBut Peel knew how uncertain was his position in view of the hostility\r\naroused. At this very time the Irish question was acute, as a Coercion\r\nBill was under consideration, and this gave his enemies their chance.\r\nThe Protectionist Tories made an unprincipled alliance for the moment\r\nwith the Irish members; and on the very day when the Repeal of the Corn\r\nLaws passed the House of Lords, the ministry was defeated in the\r\nCommons. The moment of his fall, when Disraeli and the Protectionists\r\nwere loudest in their exultation, was the moment of his triumph. It is\r\nthe climax of his career. In the long debate on Repeal he had refused to\r\nnotice personal attacks: he now rose superior to all personal rancour.\r\nIn defeat he bore himself with dignity, and in his last speech as\r\nminister he praised Cobden in very generous terms, giving him the chief\r\ncredit for the benefits which the Bill conferred upon his\r\nfellow-countrymen. This speech gave offence to his late colleagues,\r\nAberdeen, Sidney Herbert, and Gladstone, and was interpreted as being\r\ndesigned to mark clearly Peel's breach with the Conservative party. The\r\nwhole episode is illustrated in an interesting way in the _Life of\r\nGladstone_. Lord Morley[11] reports a long conversation between the two\r\nfriends and colleagues, where Peel declares his intention to act in\r\nfuture as a private member and to abstain from party politics.\r\nGladstone, while fully allowing that Peel had earned the right to retire\r\nafter such labours ('you have been Prime Minister in a sense in which no\r\nother man has been since Mr. Pitt's time'), pointed out how impossible\r\nit would be for him to carry out his intentions. His personal\r\nascendancy in Parliament was too great: men must look to him as a\r\nleader. But Peel evidently was at the end of his strength, and had been\r\nsuffering acutely from pains in the head, due to an old shooting\r\naccident but intensified by recent hard work. For the moment repose was\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n[Note 11: Morley's _Life of Gladstone_, vol. i, pp. 297-300 (cf.\r\nGladstone's own retirement in 1874).]\r\n\r\nIt was Gladstone, Peel's disciple and true successor, who seven years\r\nlater paid the following tribute to his memory: 'It is easy', he said,\r\n'to enumerate many characteristics of the greatness of Sir Robert Peel.\r\nIt is easy to speak of his ability, of his sagacity, of his\r\nindefatigable industry. But there was something yet more admirable...\r\nand that was his sense of public virtue;... when he had to choose\r\nbetween personal ease and enjoyment, or again, on the other hand,\r\nbetween political power and distinction, and what he knew to be the\r\nwelfare of the nation, his choice was made at once. When his choice was\r\nmade, no man ever saw him hesitate, no man ever saw him hold back from\r\nthat which was necessary to give it effect.' Though his own political\r\nviews changed, Gladstone always paid tribute to the moral influence\r\nwhich Peel had exercised in political life, purifying its practices and\r\nennobling its traditions.\r\n\r\nFor the last four years of his life he was in opposition, but he held a\r\nplace of dignity and independence which few fallen ministers have ever\r\nenjoyed. He was the trusted friend and adviser of Queen Victoria and the\r\nPrince Consort; he was often consulted in grave matters by the chiefs of\r\nthe Government; his speeches both in the House and in the country\r\ncarried greater weight than those of any minister. Despite the\r\nbitterness of the Protectionists he seemed still to have a great future\r\nbefore him, and in any national emergency the country would unfailingly\r\nhave called him to the helm. But on July 29, 1850, when he was just\r\nreaching the age of sixty-two, he had a fall from his horse which\r\ncaused very grave injuries, and he only survived three days.\r\n\r\nThe interest of Peel's life is almost absorbed by public questions. He\r\nwas not picturesque like Disraeli; he did not, like Gladstone, live long\r\nenough to be in his lifetime a mythical figure; the public did not\r\ncherish anecdotes about his sayings or doings, nor did he lend himself\r\nto the art of the caricaturist. He was an English gentleman to the\r\nbackbone, in his tastes, in his conduct, in his nature. His married life\r\nwas entirely happy, he had a few devoted friends, he avoided general\r\nsociety; he had a genuine fondness for shooting and country life, he was\r\na judicious patron of art, and his collection of Dutch pictures form\r\nto-day a very precious part of our National Gallery. Just because of his\r\naloofness, his gravity, the concentration of his energies, he is the\r\nbest example that we can study if we want to know how an English\r\nstatesman should train himself to do work of lasting value and how he\r\nshould bear himself in the hour of trial. Within little more than half a\r\ncentury three famous politicians, Peel, Gladstone, and Chamberlain, have\r\nsplit their parties in two by an abrupt change of policy, and their\r\nconduct has been bitterly criticized by those to whom the traditions of\r\nparty are dear. It is the glory of British politics that these\r\ntraditions remained honourable so long, and no one of these statesmen\r\nbroke with them lightly or without regret. For all that, let us be\r\nthankful that from time to time statesmen do arise who are capable of\r\nresponding to a still higher call, of following their own individual\r\nconsciences and of looking only to what, so far as they can judge, is\r\nthe highest interest of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES JAMES NAPIER\r\n\r\n1782-1853\r\n\r\n1782.

Died at Oaklands, near Portsmouth, August 29.\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES NAPIER, G.C.B.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous Napier brothers, Charles, George, and William, came of no\r\nmean parentage. Their father, Colonel the Hon. George Napier, of a\r\ndistinguished Scotch family, was remarkable alike for physical strength\r\nand mental ability. In the fervour of his admiration his son Charles\r\nrelates how he could 'take a pewter quart and squeeze it flat in his\r\nhand like a bit of paper'. In height 6 feet 3 inches, in person very\r\nhandsome, he won the admiration of others besides his sons. He had\r\nserved in the American war, but his later years were passed in\r\norganizing work, and he showed conspicuous honesty and ability in\r\ndealing with Irish military accounts. One of his reforms was the\r\nabolition of all fees in his office, by which he reduced his own salary\r\nfrom £20,000 to £600 per annum, emulating the more famous act of the\r\nelder Pitt as Paymaster-general half a century before. Their mother,\r\nLady Sarah Lennox, daughter of the Duke of Richmond, had been a reigning\r\ntoast in 1760. She had even been courted by George III, and might have\r\nbeen handed down to history as the mother of princes. In her old age she\r\nwas more proud to be the mother of heroes; and her letters still exist,\r\nwritten in the period of the great wars, to show how a British mother\r\ncould combine the Spartan ideal with the tenderest personal affection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR CHARLES NAPIER\r\n\r\nFrom the drawing by Edwin Williams in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nTheir father's appointment involved residence in Ireland from 1785\r\nonwards, and the boys passed their early years at Celbridge in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dublin. Here they were far from the usual amusements\r\nand society of the time, but they were fortunate in their home circle\r\nand in the character of their servants, and they learnt to cherish the\r\nancient legends of Ireland and to pick up everything that could feed\r\ntheir innate love of adventure and romance. Close to their doors lived\r\nan old woman named Molly Dunne, who claimed to be one hundred and\r\nthirty-five years of age, and who was ready to fill the children's ears\r\nwith tales of past tragedies whenever they came to see her. Sir William\r\nNapier tells us how she was 'tall, gaunt, and with high sharp\r\nlineaments, her eyes fixed in their huge orbs, and her tongue\r\ndiscoursing of bloody times: she was wondrous for the young and fearful\r\nfor the aged'.\r\n\r\nInstead of class feeling and narrow interests the boys developed early a\r\ngreat sympathy for the poor, and a capacity for judging people\r\nindependently of rank. Charles Napier himself, born in Whitehall, was\r\nthree years old when they moved to Ireland. He was a sickly child, the\r\none short member of a tall family, but equal to any of them in courage\r\nand resolution. His heroism in endurance of pain was put to a severe\r\ntest when he broke his leg at the age of seventeen. It was twice badly\r\nset. He was threatened first by the entire loss of it, next with the\r\nprospect of a crooked leg, but he bore cheerfully the most excruciating\r\ntorture in having it straightened by a series of painful experiments,\r\nand in no long time he recovered his activity. In the army he showed his\r\nstrength of will by rigid abstinence from drinking and gambling, no easy\r\nfeat in those days; and he learned by his father's example to control\r\nall extravagance and to live contentedly on a small allowance. His\r\nearliest enthusiasm among books was for Plutarch's _Lives_, the\r\nfavourite reading of so many great commanders. He had many outdoor\r\ntastes: riding, fishing, and shooting, and he was soon familiar with the\r\ncountry-side. There was no need of classes or prizes to stimulate his\r\nreading, no need of organized games to provide an outlet for his\r\nenergies or to fill his leisure time.\r\n\r\nThe confidence that his father had in the training of his sons is best\r\nshown by the early age at which he put them in responsible positions.\r\nCharles actually received a commission in the 33rd Regiment at the age\r\nof twelve, but he did not see service till he was seventeen. Meanwhile\r\nthe young ensign continued his schooling from his father's house at\r\nCelbridge, to which he and his brother returned every evening, sometimes\r\nin the most unconventional manner. Celbridge, like other Irish villages,\r\nhad its pigs. The Irish pig is longer in the leg and more active than\r\nhis English cousin, and the Napier boys would be seen careering along at\r\na headlong pace on these strange mounts, with a cheering company of\r\nvillage boys behind them. They were Protestants among older Roman\r\nCatholic comrades, but they soon became the leaders in the school, and\r\nCharles, despite his youth and small stature, was chosen to command a\r\nschool volunteer corps at the age of fourteen. At seventeen he joined\r\nhis regiment at Limerick, and for six or seven years he led the life of\r\na soldier in various garrison towns of southern England, fretting at\r\ninaction, learning what he could, and welcoming any chance of increased\r\nwork and danger. At this time his enthusiasm for soldiering was very\r\nvariable. In a letter written in 1803 he makes fun of the routine of his\r\nprofession, as he was set to practise it, and ends up, 'Such is the\r\ndifference between a hero of the present time and the idea of one formed\r\nfrom reading Plutarch! Yet people wonder I don't like the army!'\r\n\r\nBut this was a passing mood. When stirring events were taking place, no\r\none was more full of ardour, and when he came under such a general as\r\nSir John Moore he expressed himself in a very different tone. In 1805\r\nMoore was commanding at Hythe, and Charles Napier's letters are aglow\r\nwith enthusiasm for the great qualities which he showed as an\r\nadministrator and army reformer. Like Wolseley seventy or eighty years\r\nlater, Moore had the gift of finding the best among his subalterns and\r\ntraining them in his own excellences. After his own father there was no\r\none who had so much influence as Moore in the making of Charles Napier.\r\nIn 1808 he sailed for the Peninsula with the rank of major, commanding\r\nthe 50th Regiment in the colonel's absence; he took an active part in\r\nMoore's famous retreat at Coruña, and in the battle was taken prisoner\r\nafter conduct of the greatest gallantry in leading his regiment under\r\nfire. Two months later he was released and again went to the front. In\r\n1810 and 1811 he and his brothers George and William were fighting under\r\nWellington, and were all so frequently wounded that the family fortunes\r\nbecame a subject of common talk. On more than one occasion Wellington\r\nhimself wrote to Lady Sarah to inform her of the gallantry and\r\nmisfortunes of her sons. At Busaco Charles had his jaw broken and was\r\nforced to retire into hospital at Lisbon. In his haste to rejoin the\r\narmy, which he did when only half convalescent, he accomplished the feat\r\nof riding ninety miles on one horse in a single day; and in the course\r\nof his ride met two of his brothers being carried down, wounded, to the\r\nbase. But in 1811 promotion withdrew Charles Napier from the Peninsula.\r\nA short command in Guernsey was followed by another in Bermuda, which\r\ninvolved him in the American war. He had little taste for warfare with\r\nmen of the same race as himself, and was heartily glad to exchange back\r\nto the 50th in 1813, and to return to England. He started out as a\r\nvolunteer to share in the campaign of Waterloo, but all was over before\r\nhe could join the army in Flanders, and this part of his soldiering\r\ncareer ended quietly. He had received far more wounds than honours, and\r\nmight well have been discouraged in the pursuit of his profession.\r\n\r\nBut here we can put to the test how far Napier's expressions of distaste\r\nfor the service affected his conduct. He chafed at the inactivity of\r\npeace; but instead of abandoning the army for some more profitable\r\ncareer, he used his enforced leisure to prepare for further service and\r\nto extend his knowledge of political and military history. He spent the\r\ngreater part of three years at the Military College, then established at\r\nFarnham, varying his professional studies with sallies into the domain\r\nof politics, and as a result he developed marked Radical views which he\r\nheld through life. His note-books show a splendid grasp of principles\r\nand a close attention to facts; they range from the enforcing of the\r\ndeath penalty for marauding to the details of cavalry-kit. His Spartan\r\nregime became famous in later years; even now he prescribed a strict\r\nrule, 'a cloak, a pair of shoes, two flannel shirts, and a piece of\r\nsoap--these, wrapped up in an oil-skin, must go in the right holster,\r\nand a pistol in the left.' He took no opinions at second hand, but\r\nstudied the best authorities and thought for himself; he was as thorough\r\nin self-education as the famous Confederate general 'Stonewall' Jackson,\r\nwho every evening sat for an hour, facing a blank wall and reviewing in\r\nhis mind the subjects which he had read during the day.\r\n\r\nNo opportunity for reaping the fruit of these studies and exercising his\r\ngreat gifts was given him till May 1819. Then he was appointed to the\r\npost of inspecting-officer in the Ionian Islands;[12] and in 1822 he was\r\nappointed Military Resident in Cephalonia, the largest of these islands,\r\na pile of rugged limestone hills, scantily supplied with water, and\r\nruined by years of neglect and the oppression of Turkish pashas. So\r\nbegan what was certainly the happiest, and perhaps the most fruitful,\r\nperiod in Charles Napier's life. It was not strictly military work, but,\r\nwithout the authority which his military rank gave him and without the\r\ndespotic methods of martial law, little could have been achieved in the\r\ndisordered state of the country. The whole episode is a good example of\r\nhow a well-trained soldier of original mind can, when left to himself,\r\nimpress his character on a semi-civilized people, and may be compared\r\nwith the work of Sir Harry Smith in South Africa, or Sir Henry Lawrence\r\nin the Punjab. The practical reforms which he initiated in law, in\r\ncommerce, in agriculture, are too numerous to mention. 'Expect no\r\nletters from me', he writes to his mother, 'save about roads. No going\r\nhome for me: it would be wrong to leave a place where so much good is\r\nbeing done.... My market-place is roofed. My pedestal is a tremendous\r\njob, but two months more will finish that also. My roads will not be\r\nfinished by me.' And again, 'I take no rest myself and give nobody else\r\nany.' To his superiors he showed himself somewhat impracticable in\r\ntemper, and he was certainly exacting to his subordinates, though\r\ngenerous in his praise of those who helped him. He was compassionate to\r\nthe poor and vigorous in his dealings with the privileged classes; and\r\nhe gave the islanders an entirely new conception of justice. When he\r\nquitted the island after six years of office he left behind him two new\r\nmarket-places, one and a half miles of pier, one hundred miles of road\r\nlargely blasted out of solid rock, spacious streets, a girls' school,\r\nand many other improvements; and he put into the natives a spirit of\r\nendeavour which outlived his term of office. One sign of the latter was\r\nthat, after his departure, some peasants yearly transmitted to him the\r\nprofits of a small piece of land which he had left uncared for, without\r\ndisclosing the names of those whose labours had earned it.\r\n\r\n[Note 12: Ceded to Great Britain in 1815 and given by her in 1864 to\r\nGreece.]\r\n\r\nDuring this period, in visits to Corinth and the Morea, he worked out\r\nstrategic plans for keeping the Turks out of Greece. He also made\r\nfriends with Lord Byron, who came out in 1823 to help the Greek patriots\r\nand to meet his death in the swamps of Missolonghi. Byron conceived the\r\ngreatest admiration for Napier's talents and believed him to be capable\r\nof liberating Greece, if he were given a free hand. But this was not to\r\nbe. Reasons of State and petty rivalries barred the way to the\r\nappointment of a British general, though it might have set the name of\r\nNapier in history beside those of Bolivar and Garibaldi; for he would\r\nhave identified himself heart and soul with such a cause, and, in the\r\nopinion of many good judges, would have triumphed over the difficulties\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nFrom 1830 to 1839 there is little to narrate. The gifts which might have\r\nbeen devoted to commanding a regiment, to training young officers, or to\r\nruling a distant province, were too lightly rated by the Government, and\r\nhe spent his time quietly in England and France educating his two\r\ndaughters,[13] interesting himself in politics, and continuing to learn.\r\nIt was the political crisis in England which called him back to active\r\nlife. The readjustment of the labour market to meet the use of\r\nmachinery, and the occurrence of a series of bad harvests had caused\r\nwidespread discontent, and the Chartist movement was at its height in\r\n1839. Labourers and factory owners were alarmed; the Government was\r\nbesieged with petitions for military protection at a hundred points, and\r\nall the elements of a dangerous explosion were gathered together. At\r\nthis critical time Charles Napier was offered the command of the troops\r\nin the northern district, and amply did he vindicate the choice. By the\r\nmost careful preparation beforehand, by the most consummate coolness in\r\nthe moment of danger, he rode the storm. He saw the danger of billeting\r\nsmall detachments of troops in isolated positions; he concentrated them\r\nat the important points. He interviewed alarmed magistrates, and he\r\nattended, in person and unarmed, a large gathering of Chartists. To all\r\nhe spoke calmly but resolutely. He made it clear to the rich that he\r\nwould not order a shot to be fired while peaceful measures were\r\npossible; he made it equally clear to the Chartists that he would\r\nsuppress disorder, if it arose, promptly and mercilessly. With only four\r\nthousand troops under his command to control all the industrial\r\ndistricts of the north, Newcastle and Manchester, Sheffield and\r\nNottingham, he did his work effectually without a shot being fired. 'Ars\r\nest celare artem': and just because of his success, few observers\r\nrealized from how great a danger the community had been preserved.\r\n\r\n[Note 13: His first wife, whom he married in 1827, died in 1832. He\r\nmarried again in 1835.]\r\n\r\nThus he had proved his versatile talents in regimental service in the\r\nPeninsula, in the reclamation of an eastern island from barbarism, and\r\nin the control of disorder at home. It was not till he had reached the\r\nage of sixty that he was to prove these gifts in the highest sphere, in\r\nthe handling of an army in the field and in the direction of a campaign.\r\nBut the offer of a command in India roused his indomitable spirit, the\r\nmore so as trouble was threatening on the north-west frontier. An\r\nill-judged interference in Afgh[=a]nist[=a]n had in 1841 caused the\r\nmassacre near K[=a]bul of one British force: other contingents were\r\nbesieged in Jal[=a]l[=a]b[=a]d and Ghazni, and were in danger of a\r\nsimilar fate, and the prestige of British arms was at its lowest in the\r\nvalley of the Indus. Lord Ellenborough, the new Viceroy, turned to\r\nCharles Napier for advice, and in April 1842 he was given the command in\r\nUpper and Lower Sind, the districts comprising the lower Indus valley.\r\nIt was his first experience of India and his first command in war. He\r\nwas sixty years old and he had not faced an enemy's army in the field\r\nsince the age of twenty-five. As he said, 'I go to command in Sind with\r\nno orders, no instructions, no precise line of policy given! How many\r\nmen are in Sind? How many soldiers to command? No one knows!... They\r\ntell me I must form and model the staff of the army altogether! Feeling\r\nmyself but an apprentice in Indian matters, I yet look in vain for a\r\nmaster.' But the years of study and preparation had not been in vain,\r\nand responsibility never failed to call out his best qualities. It was\r\nnot many months before British officers and soldiers, Baluch chiefs and\r\nSindian peasants owned him as a master--such a master of the arts of war\r\nand peace as had not been seen on the Indus since the days of Alexander\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\nFirst, like a true pupil of Sir John Moore, he set to work thoroughly to\r\ndrill his army. He experimented in person with British muskets and\r\nMar[=a]th[=a] matchlocks, and reassured his soldiers on the superiority\r\nof the former. He experimented with rockets to test their efficiency;\r\nand, with his usual luck in the matter of wounds, he had the calf of\r\nhis leg badly torn by one that burst. He would put his hand to any\r\nlabour and his life to any risk, if so he might stir the activity of\r\nothers and promote the cause. He convinced himself, by studying the\r\nquestion at first hand, that the Baluch Am[=i]rs, who ruled the country,\r\nwere not only aliens but oppressors of the native peasantry, not only\r\nill-disposed to British policy, but actively plotting with the\r\nhill-tribes beyond the Indus, and at the right moment he struck.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the situation lay in the great extent of the country, in\r\nthe difficulty of marching in such heat amid the sand, and in the\r\npossibility of the Am[=i]rs escaping from his grasp and taking refuge in\r\nfortresses in the heart of the desert, believed to be inaccessible. His\r\nfirst notable exploit was a march northwards one hundred miles into the\r\ndesert to capture Im[=a]mghar; his last, crowning a memorable sixteen\r\ndays, was a similar descent upon Omarkot, which lay one hundred miles\r\neastward beyond M[=i]rpur. These raids involved the organization of a\r\ncamel corps, the carrying of water across the desert, and the greatest\r\nhardships for the troops, all of which Charles Napier shared\r\nuncomplainingly in person. Under his leadership British regiments and\r\nBombay sepoys alike did wonders. Who could complain for himself when he\r\nsaw the spare frame of the old general, his health undermined by fever\r\nand watches, his hooked nose and flashing eye turned this way and that,\r\nriding daily at their head, prepared to stint himself of all but the\r\nbarest necessaries and to share every peril? He had begun the campaign\r\nin January; the crowning success was won on April 6. Between these dates\r\nhe fought two pitched battles at Mi[=a]ni and Dabo, and completely broke\r\nthe power of the Am[=i]rs.\r\n\r\nMi[=a]ni (February 17, 1843) was the most glorious day in his life. With\r\n2,400 troops, of whom barely 500 were Europeans, he attacked an army\r\nvariously estimated between 20,000 and 40,000. Drawn up in a position,\r\nwhich they had themselves chosen, on the raised bank of a dry river bed,\r\nthe Baluch[=i] seemed to have every advantage on their side. But the\r\nBritish troops, advancing in echelon from the right, led by the 22nd\r\nRegiment, and developing an effective musketry fire, fought their way up\r\nto the outer slope of the steep bank and held it for three hours. Here\r\nthe 22nd, with the two regiments of Bombay sepoys on their left,\r\ntrusting chiefly to the bayonet, but firing occasional volleys, resisted\r\nthe onslaught of Baluch[=i] swordsmen in overwhelming numbers. During\r\nnearly all this time the two lines were less than twenty yards apart,\r\nand Napier was conspicuous on horseback riding coolly along the front of\r\nthe British line. The matchlocks, with which many of the Baluch[=i] were\r\narmed, seem to have been ineffective; their national weapon was the\r\nsword. The tribesmen were grand fighters but badly led. They attacked in\r\ndetachments with no concerted action. For all that, the British line\r\nfrequently staggered under the weight of their courageous rushes, and\r\nirregular firing went on across the narrow gap. Napier says, 'I expected\r\ndeath as much from our own men as from the enemy, and I was much singed\r\nby our fire--my whiskers twice or thrice so, and my face peppered by\r\nfellows who, in their fear, fired over all heads but mine, and nearly\r\nscattered my brains'. Not even Scarlett at Balaclava had a more\r\nmiraculous escape. This exposure of his own person to risk was not due\r\nto mere recklessness. In his days at the Royal Military College he had\r\ncarefully considered the occasions when a commander must expose himself\r\nto get the best out of his men; and from Coruña to Dabo he acted\r\nconsistently on his principles. Early in the battle he had cleverly\r\ndisposed his troops so as to neutralize in some measure the vast\r\nnumerical superiority of the enemy; his few guns were well placed and\r\nwell served. At a critical moment he ordered a charge of cavalry which\r\nbroke the right of their position and threatened their camp; but the\r\nissue had to be decided by hard fighting, and all depended on the morale\r\nwhich was to carry the troops through such a punishing day.\r\n\r\nThe second battle was fought a month later at Dabo, near\r\nHyder[=a]b[=a]d. The most redoubtable of the Am[=i]rs, Sher Muhammad,\r\nknown as 'the Lion of M[=i]rpur', had been gathering a force of his own\r\nand was only a few miles distant from Mi[=a]ni when that battle was\r\nfought. Napier could have attacked him at once; but, to avoid bloodshed,\r\nhe was ready to negotiate. 'The Lion' only used the respite to collect\r\nmore troops, and was soon defying the British with a force of 25,000\r\nmen, full of ardour despite their recent defeat. Indeed Napier\r\nencouraged their confidence by spreading rumours of the terror\r\nprevailing in his own camp. He did not wish to exhaust his men\r\nneedlessly by long marches in tropical heat; so he played a waiting\r\ngame, gathering reinforcements and trusting that the enemy would soon\r\ngive him a chance of fighting. This chance came on March 24, and with a\r\nforce of 5,000 men and 19 guns Napier took another three hours to win\r\nhis second battle and to drive Sher Muhammad from his position with the\r\nloss of 5,000 killed. The British losses were relatively trifling,\r\namounting to 270, of whom 147 belonged to the sorely tried 22nd\r\nRegiment. They were all full of confidence and fought splendidly under\r\nthe general's eye. 'The Lion' himself escaped northwards, and two months\r\nof hard marching and clever strategy were needed to prevent him stirring\r\nup trouble among the tribesmen. The climate took toll of the British\r\ntroops and even the general was for a time prostrated by sunstroke; but\r\nthe operations were successful and the last nucleus of an army was\r\nbroken up by Colonel Jacob on June 15. Sher Muhammad ended his days\r\nignominiously at Lahore, then the capital of the Sikhs, having outlived\r\nhis fame and sunk into idleness and debauchery.\r\n\r\nThus in June 1843 the general could write in his diary: 'We have taught\r\nthe Baluch that neither his sun nor his desert nor his jungles nor his\r\nnullahs can stop us. He will never face us more.' But Charles Napier's\r\nown work was far from being finished. He had to bind together the\r\ndifferent elements in the province, to reconcile chieftain and peasant\r\nBaluch, Hindu, and Sindian, to living together in amity and submitting\r\nto British rule; and he had to set up a framework of military and\r\ncivilian officers to carry on the work. He held firmly the principle\r\nthat military rule must be temporary. For the moment it was more\r\neffective; but it was his business to prepare the new province for\r\nregular civil government as soon as was feasible. He showed his\r\ningenuity in the personal interviews which he had with the chieftains;\r\nand the ascendancy which he won by his character was marked. Perhaps his\r\nqualities were such as could be more easily appreciated by orientals\r\nthan by his own countrymen, for he was impetuous, self-reliant, and\r\nautocratic in no common degree. He was only one of a number of great\r\nEnglishmen of this century whose direct personal contact with Eastern\r\nprinces was worth scores of diplomatic letters and paper constitutions.\r\nSuch men were Henry Lawrence, John Nicholson, and Charles Gordon; in\r\nthem the power of Great Britain was incarnate in such a form as to\r\nstrike the imagination and leave an ineffaceable impression. Many of the\r\nAm[=i]rs wished to swear allegiance to a governor present in the flesh\r\nrather than to the distant queen beyond the sea, so strongly were they\r\nimpressed by Napier's personal character.\r\n\r\nHe did not forget his own countrymen, least of all that valued friend\r\n'Thomas Atkins' and his comrade the sepoy. By the erection of spacious\r\nbarracks he made the soldier's life more pleasant and his health more\r\nsecure; and in a hundred other ways he showed his care and affection for\r\nthem. In return few British generals have been so loved by the rank and\r\nfile. He also gave much thought to material progress, to strengthening\r\nthe fortress of Hyder[=a]b[=a]d, to developing the harbour at\r\nKar[=a]chi, and, above all, to enriching the peasants by irrigation\r\nschemes. It was the story of Cephalonia on a bigger scale; but Napier\r\nwas now twenty years older, overwhelmed with work, and he could give\r\nless attention to details. He did his best to find subordinates after\r\nhis own heart, men who would 'scorn delights and live laborious days'.\r\n'Does he wear varnished boots?' was a typical question that he put to a\r\nfriend in Bombay, when a new engineer was commended to him. His own\r\nrewards were meagre. The Grand Cross of the Bath and the colonelcy of\r\nhis favourite regiment, the 22nd, were all the recognition given for a\r\ncampaign whose difficulties were minimized at home because he had\r\nmastered them so triumphantly.\r\n\r\nTwo other achievements belong to the period of his government of Sind.\r\nThe campaign against the tribes of the Kachhi Hills, to the north-west\r\nof his province, rendered necessary by continued marauding, shows all\r\nhis old mastery of organization. Any one who has glanced into Indian\r\nhistory knows the danger of these raids and the bitter experience which\r\nour Indian army has gained in them. In less than two months\r\n(January-March 1845) Napier had led five thousand men safely over\r\nburning deserts and through most difficult mountain country, had by\r\ncareful strategy driven the marauders into a corner, forcing them to\r\nsurrender with trifling loss, and had made an impression on the hill\r\nchieftains which lasted for many a year. This work, though slighted by\r\nthe directors of the Company, received enthusiastic praise from such\r\ngood judges of war as Lord Hardinge and the Duke of Wellington. The\r\nsecond emergency arose when the first Sikh war broke out in the Punjab.\r\nNapier felt so confident in the loyalty of his newly-pacified province\r\nthat within six weeks he drew together an army of 15,000 men, and took\r\npost at Rohri, ready to co-operate against the Sikhs from the south,\r\nwhile Lord Hardinge advanced from the east. Before he could arrive, the\r\ndecisive battle had been fought, and all he was asked to do was to\r\nassist in a council of war at Lahore. The mistakes made in the campaign\r\nhad been numerous. No one saw them more clearly than Napier, and no one\r\nforetold more accurately the troubles which were to follow. For all\r\nthat, he wrote in generous admiration of Lord Hardinge the Viceroy and\r\nLord Gough the Commander-in-Chief at a time when criticism and personal\r\nbitterness were prevalent in many quarters.\r\n\r\nAfter this he returned to Sind with health shattered and a longing for\r\nrest. He continued to work with vigour, but his mind was set on\r\nresignation; and the bad relations which had for years existed between\r\nhim and the directors embittered his last months. No doubt he was\r\nimpatient and self-willed, inclined to take short cuts through the\r\nsystem of dual control[14] and to justify them by his own single-hearted\r\nzeal for the good of the country. But the directors had eyes for all the\r\nslight irregularities, which are inevitable in the work of an original\r\nman, and failed entirely to estimate the priceless services that he\r\nrendered to British rule. In July 1847 he resigned and returned to\r\nEurope; but even now the end was not come. 'The tragedy must be re-acted\r\na year or two hence,' he had written in March 1846, seeing clearly that\r\nthe Sikhs had not been reconciled to British rule. In February 1849 the\r\ndirectors were forced by the national voice to send him out to take\r\nsupreme military command and to retrieve the disasters with which the\r\nsecond Sikh war began. They were very reluctant to do so, and Napier\r\nhimself had little wish for further exertions in so thankless a service.\r\nBut the Duke of Wellington himself appealed to him, the nation spoke\r\nthrough all its organs, and he could not put his own wishes in the scale\r\nagainst the demands of public service.\r\n\r\n[Note 14: The dual control of British India by the Crown and the\r\nEast India Company lasted from 1778 to 1858.]\r\n\r\nHe made all speed and reached Calcutta early in May, but he found no\r\nenemy to fight. The issue had been decided by Lord Gough and the hard\r\nfighting of Chili[=a]nw[=a]la. He had been cheated by fortune, as in\r\n1815, and he never knew the joy of battle again. He was accustomed to\r\nsettle everything as a dictator; he found it difficult to act as part of\r\nan administrative machine. He was unfamiliar with the routine of Indian\r\nofficial life, and he was now growing old; he was impatient of forms,\r\nimpetuous in his likes and dislikes, outspoken in praise and\r\ncondemnation. His relations with the masterful Viceroy, Lord Dalhousie,\r\nwere soon clouded; and though he delighted in the friendship of Colin\r\nCampbell and many other able soldiers, he was too old to adapt himself\r\nto new men and new measures. In 1850 the rumblings of the storm, which\r\nwas to break seven years later, could already be heard, and Napier had\r\nmuch anxiety over the mutinous spirit rising in the sepoy regiments. He\r\ndid his best to go to the bottom of the trouble and to establish\r\nconfidence and friendly relations between British and natives, but he\r\nhad not time enough to achieve permanent results, and he was often\r\nfettered by the regulations of the political service. His predictions\r\nwere as striking now as in the first Sikh war; but he was not content to\r\npredict and to sit idle. He was unwearied in working for the reform of\r\nbarracks, though his plans were often spoiled by the careless execution\r\nof others. He was urgent for a better tone among regimental officers\r\nand for more consideration on their part towards their soldiers. If more\r\nmen in high position had similarly exerted themselves, the mutiny would\r\nhave been less widespread and less fatal. His resignation was due to a\r\ndispute with Lord Dalhousie about the sepoys' pay. Napier acted _ultra\r\nvires_ in suspending on his own responsibility an order of the\r\nGovernment, because he believed the situation to be critical, while the\r\nViceroy refused to regard this as justified. His departure, in December\r\n1850, was the signal for an outburst of feeling among officers,\r\nsoldiers, and all who knew him. His return by way of Sind was a\r\ntriumphal progress.\r\n\r\nHe had two years to live when he set foot again in England, and most of\r\nthis was spent at Oaklands near Portsmouth. His health had been ruined\r\nin the public service; but he continued to take a keen interest in\r\npassing events and to write on military subjects to Colin Campbell and\r\nother friends. At the same time he devoted much of his time to his\r\nneighbours and his farm. In 1852 he attended as pall-bearer at the Duke\r\nof Wellington's funeral; his own was not far distant. His brother, Sir\r\nWilliam, describes the last scene thus: 'On the morning of August 29th\r\n1853, at 5 o'clock, he expired like a soldier on a naked camp bedstead,\r\nthe windows of the room open and the fresh air of Heaven blowing on his\r\nmanly face--as the last breath escaped, Montagu McMurdo (his\r\nson-in-law), with a sudden inspiration, snatched the old colours of the\r\n22nd Regiment, the colour that had been borne at Mi[=a]ni and\r\nHyder[=a]b[=a]d, and waved them over the dying hero. Thus Charles Napier\r\npassed from the world.'\r\n\r\nHe was a man who roused enthusiastic devotion and provoked strong\r\nresentment. Like Gordon, he was a man who could rule others, but could\r\nnot be ruled; and his official career left many heart-burnings behind.\r\nHis equally passionate brother, Sir William, who wrote his life, took\r\nup the feud as a legacy and pursued it in print for many years. It is\r\nregrettable that such men cannot work without friction; but in all\r\nthings it was devotion to the public service, and not personal ambition,\r\nthat carried Charles Napier to such extremes. From his youth he had\r\ntrained himself to such a pitch of self-denial and ascetic rigour that\r\nhe could not make allowance for the frailties of the average man. His\r\nkeen eye and swift brain made him too impatient of the shortcomings of\r\nconscientious officials. He was ready to work fifteen hours a day when\r\nthe need came; he was able to pierce into the heart of a matter while\r\nothers would be puzzling round the fringes of it. Rarely in his long and\r\nlaborious career did an emergency arise capable of bringing out all his\r\ngifts; and his greatest exploits were performed on scenes unfamiliar to\r\nthe mass of his fellow countrymen. But a few opinions can be given to\r\nshow that he was rated at his full value by the foremost men of the day.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking testimony comes from one who never saw him; it\r\nwas written three years after his death, when his brother's biography\r\nappeared. It was Carlyle, the biographer of Cromwell and Frederick the\r\nGreat, the most famous man of letters of the day, who wrote in 1856:\r\n'The fine and noble qualities of the man are very recognizable to me;\r\nhis piercing, subtle intellect turned all to the practical, giving him\r\njust insight into men and into things; his inexhaustible, adroit\r\ncontrivances; his fiery valour; sharp promptitude to seize the good\r\nmoment that will not return. A lynx-eyed, fiery man, with the spirit of\r\nan old knight in him; more of a hero than any modern I have seen for a\r\nlong time.' A second tribute comes from one who had known him as an\r\nofficer and was a supreme judge of military genius. Wellington was not\r\ngiven to extravagant words, but on many occasions he expressed himself\r\nin the warmest terms about Napier's talents and services. In 1844,\r\nspeaking of the Sind campaign in the House of Lords, he said: 'My Lords,\r\nI must say that, after giving the fullest consideration to these\r\noperations, I have never known any instance of an officer who has shown\r\nin a higher degree that he possesses all the qualities and\r\nqualifications necessary to enable him to conduct great operations.' In\r\nthe House of Commons at the same time Sir Robert Peel--the ablest\r\nadministrative statesman of that generation, who had read for himself\r\nsome of Napier's masterly dispatches--said: 'No one ever doubted Sir\r\nCharles Napier's military powers; but in his other character he does\r\nsurprise me--he is possessed of extraordinary talent for civil\r\nadministration.' Again, he speaks of him as 'one of three brothers who\r\nhave engrafted on the stem of an ancient and honourable lineage that\r\npersonal nobility which is derived from unblemished private character,\r\nfrom the highest sense of personal honour, and from repeated proofs of\r\nvalour in the field, which have made their name conspicuous in the\r\nrecords of their country'.\r\n\r\nIndifferent as Charles Napier was to ordinary praise or blame, he would\r\nhave appreciated the words of such men, especially when they associated\r\nhim with his brothers; but perhaps he would have been more pleased to\r\nknow how many thousands of his humble fellow countrymen walked to his\r\ninformal funeral at Portsmouth, and to know that the majority of those\r\nwho subscribed to his statue in Trafalgar Square were private soldiers\r\nin the army that he had served and loved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD SHAFTESBURY\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by G.

It has become hackneyed and corrupted; it has taken a\r\nprofessional taint; it has almost become a byword. We are apt to think\r\nof the philanthropist as an excitable, contentious creature, at the\r\nmercy of every fad, an ultra-radical in politics, craving for notoriety,\r\nfilled with self-confidence, and meddling with other people's business.\r\nAnthony Ashley Cooper, the greatest philanthropist of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, was of a different type. By temper he was strongly\r\nconservative. He always loved best to be among his own family; he was\r\nfond of his home, fond of the old associations of his house. To come out\r\ninto public life, to take his place in Parliament or on the platform, to\r\nbe mixed up in the wrangling of politics was naturally distasteful to\r\nhim. It continually needed a strong effort for him to overcome this\r\ndistaste and to act up to his sense of duty. It is only when we remember\r\nthis that we can do justice to his lifelong activity, and to the high\r\nprinciples which bore him up through so many efforts and so many\r\ndisappointments. For himself he would submit to injustice and be still:\r\nfor his fellow countrymen and for his religion he would renew the battle\r\nto the last day of his life.\r\n\r\nHis childhood was not happy. His parents had little sympathy with\r\nchildren, his father being absorbed in the cares of public life, his\r\nmother given up to society pleasures. He had three sisters older than\r\nhimself, but no brother or companion, and he was left largely to\r\nhimself. At the age of seven he went to a preparatory school, where he\r\nwas made miserable by the many abuses which flourished there; and it was\r\nnot till he went to Harrow at the age of twelve that he began to enjoy\r\nlife. He had few of the indulgences which we associate with the early\r\ndays of those who are born heirs to high position. But, thus thrown back\r\non himself, the boy nurtured strong attachments, for the old housekeeper\r\nwho first showed him tenderness at home, for the school where he had\r\nlearnt to be happy, and for the Dorset home, which was to be throughout\r\nhis life the pole-star of his affections. The village of Wimborne St.\r\nGiles lies some eight miles north of Wimborne, in Dorset, on the edge of\r\nCranborne Forest, one of the most beautiful and unspoiled regions in the\r\nsouth of England, which 'as late as 1818 contained twelve thousand deer\r\nand as many as six lodges, each of which had its walk and its ranger'.\r\nHere he wandered freely in his holidays for many years, giving as yet\r\nlittle promise of an exceptional career; here you may find in outlying\r\ncottages those who still treasure his memory and keep his biography\r\namong the few books that adorn their shelves.\r\n\r\nFrom Harrow, Lord Ashley went at the age of sixteen to read for two\r\nyears with a clergyman in Derbyshire; in 1819 he went to Christ Church,\r\nOxford, and three years later succeeded in taking a first class in\r\nclassics. He had good abilities and a great power of concentration.\r\nThese were to bear fruit one day in the gathering of statistics, in the\r\nmarshalling of evidence, and in the presentation of a case which needed\r\nthe most lucid and most laborious advocacy.\r\n\r\nHe came down from Oxford in 1822, but did not go into Parliament till\r\n1826, and for the intervening years there is little to chronicle. In\r\nthose days it was usual enough for a young nobleman to take up politics\r\nwhen he was barely of age, but Lord Ashley needed some other motive than\r\nthe custom of the day. It is characteristic of his whole life that he\r\nresponded to a call when there was a need, but was never in a hurry to\r\nput himself forward or to aim at high position. We have a few of his own\r\nnotes from this time which show the extent of his reading, and still\r\nmore, the depth of his reflections. As with Milton, who spent over five\r\nyears at Cambridge and then five more in study and retirement at Horton,\r\nthe long years of self-education were profitable and left their mark on\r\nhis life. His first strong religious impulse he himself dates back to\r\nhis school-days at Harrow, when (as is now recorded in a mural tablet\r\non the spot) in walking up the street one day he was shocked by the\r\nindignities of a pauper funeral. The drunken bearers, staggering up the\r\nhill and swearing over the coffin, so appalled him that the sight\r\nremained branded on his memory and he determined to devote his life to\r\nthe service of the poor. But one such shock would have achieved little,\r\nif the decision had not been strengthened by years of thought and\r\nresolution. His tendency to self-criticism is seen in the entry in his\r\ndiary for April, 1826 (his twenty-fifth birthday). He blames himself for\r\nindulging in dreams and for having performed so little; but he himself\r\nadmits that the visions were all of a noble character, and we know what\r\nabundant fruit they produced in the sixty years of active effort which\r\nwere to follow. The man who a year later could write sincerely in his\r\ndiary, 'Immortality has ceased to be a longing with me. I desire to be\r\nuseful in my generation,' had been little harmed by a few years of\r\ndreaming dreams, and had little need to be afraid of having made a false\r\nstart in life.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the House of Commons as member for Woodstock in 1826,\r\nLord Ashley had strong Conservative instincts, a fervid belief in the\r\nBritish constitution, and an unbounded admiration for the Duke of\r\nWellington, whose Peninsula victories had fired his enthusiasm at\r\nHarrow. It was to his wing of the Conservative party that Ashley\r\nattached himself; and it was the duke who, succeeding to the premiership\r\non the premature death of Canning, gave him his first office, a post on\r\nthe India Board of Control. The East India Company with its board of\r\ndirectors (abolished in 1858) still ruled India, but was since 1778\r\nsubject in many ways to the control of the British Parliament, and the\r\nboard to which Lord Ashley now belonged exercised some of the functions\r\nsince committed to the Secretary of State for India. He set himself\r\nconscientiously to study the interests of India, but over the work of\r\nhis department he had little chance of winning distinction. In fact his\r\nfirst prominent speech was on the Reform of Lunatic Asylums, not an easy\r\nsubject for a new member to handle. He was diffident in manner and\r\nalmost inaudible. Without the kindly encouragement of friends he might\r\nhave despaired of future success; but his sincerity in the cause was\r\nworth more than many a brilliant speech. The Bill was carried, a new\r\nboard was constituted, and of this Lord Ashley became chairman in 1829,\r\nand continued to hold the office till his death fifty-six years later.\r\nThis was the first of the burdens that he took upon himself without\r\nthought of reward, and so is worthy of special mention, though it never\r\nwon the fame of his factory legislation. But it shows the character of\r\nthe man, how ready he was to step into a post which meant work without\r\nremuneration, drudgery without fame, prejudice and opposition from all\r\nwhose interests were concerned in maintaining the abuses of the past.\r\n\r\nIt was this spirit which led him in 1836 to take up the Church Pastoral\r\nAid Society,[15] in 1839 to found the Indigent Blind Visiting Society,\r\nin 1840 to champion the cause of chimney-sweeps, and in all these cases\r\nto continue his support for fifty years or more. We are accustomed\r\nto-day to 'presidents' and 'patrons' and a whole broadsheet of\r\ncomplimentary titles, to which noblemen give their names and often give\r\nlittle else. Lord Ashley understood such an office differently. He was\r\nregular in attendance at meetings, generous in giving money, unflinching\r\nin his advocacy of the cause. We shall see this more fully in dealing\r\nwith the two most famous crusades associated with his name.\r\n\r\n[Note 15: To help church work by adding to the number of clergy.]\r\n\r\nThough these growing labours began early to occupy his time, we find the\r\nrecord of his life diversified by other claims and other interests. In\r\n1830 he married Emily, daughter of Lord Cowper, who bore him several\r\nchildren, and who shared all his interests with the fullest sympathy;\r\nand henceforth his greatest joys and his deepest sorrows were always\r\nassociated with his family life. At home his first hobby was astronomy.\r\nAt the age of twenty-eight he was ardently devoted to it and would spend\r\nall his leisure on it for weeks together, till graver duties absorbed\r\nhis time. But he was no recluse, and all through his life he found\r\npleasure in the society of his friends and in paying them visits in\r\ntheir homes. Many of his early visits were paid to the Iron Duke at\r\nStrathfieldsaye; in later life no one entertained him more often than\r\nLord Palmerston, with whom he was connected by marriage. He was the\r\nfriend and often the guest of Queen Victoria, and in his twenty-eighth\r\nyear he is even found as a guest at the festive board of George IV.\r\n'Such a round of laughing and pleasure I never enjoyed: if there be a\r\nhospitable gentleman on earth it is His Majesty.' And at all times he\r\nwas ready to mix freely and on terms of social equality with all who\r\nshared his sympathies, dukes and dustmen, Cabinet ministers and\r\ncostermongers.\r\n\r\nIn the holiday season he delighted to travel. In his journals he sets\r\ndown the impressions which he felt among the pictures and churches of\r\nItaly, and in the mountains of Germany and Switzerland; he loves to\r\nrecord the friendliness of the greetings which he met among the\r\npeasantry of various lands. When he talked to them no one could fail to\r\nsee that he was genuinely interested in them, that he wanted to know\r\ntheir joys and their sorrows, and to enrich his own knowledge by\r\nanything that the humblest could tell him. Still more did he delight in\r\nScotland, where he had many friends. He was of the generation\r\nimmediately under the spell of the 'Wizard of the North', and the whole\r\ncountry was seen through a veil of romantic and historical association.\r\nThere he went nearly every year, to Edinburgh, to Roslin, to Inveraray,\r\nto the Trossachs, and to a hundred other places--and if his heart was\r\nstirred with the glories of the past, his eye was quick to 'catch the\r\nmanners living as they rise'. As he commented caustically at Rome on\r\n'the church lighted up and decorated like a ball-room--the bishop with a\r\nstout train of canons, listening to the music precisely like an opera',\r\nso at Newbattle he criticizes the coldness of the kirk, 'all is silent\r\nsave the minister, who discharges the whole ceremony and labours under\r\nthe weight of his own tautologies'. His bringing up had been in the\r\nAnglican church; he was devoted to her liturgy, her congregational\r\nworship, her moderation and simplicity combined with reverence and\r\nwarmth. Although these travels were but interludes in his busy life,\r\nthey show that it was not for want of other tastes and interests of his\r\nown that his life was dedicated to laborious service. He was very human\r\nhimself, and there were few aspects of humanity which did not attract\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith his father relations were very difficult. As his interest in social\r\nquestions grew, his attention was naturally turned on the poor nearest\r\nto his own doors, the agricultural labourers of Dorset. Even in those\r\ndays of low wages Dorset was a notorious example quoted on many a\r\nRadical platform: the wages of the farm labourers were frequently as low\r\nas seven shillings a week, and the conditions in which they had often to\r\nbring up a large family of children were deplorable. If Lord Ashley had\r\nnot himself felt the shame of their poverty, their bad housing and their\r\nother hardships, there were plenty of opponents ready to force them on\r\nhis notice in revenge for his having exposed their own sores. He was\r\nmade responsible for abuses which he could not remedy. While his father,\r\na resolute Tory of the old type, still lived, the son was unable to\r\nstir. He sedulously tried to avoid all bitterness; but he could not,\r\nwhen publicly challenged, avoid stating his own views about fair wages\r\nand fair conditions of living, and his father took offence. For years it\r\nwas impossible for the son to come under his father's roof. When the old\r\nearl died in 1851, his son lost no time in proving his sincerity as a\r\nreformer; but meanwhile he had to go into the fray against the\r\nmanufacturers with his arms tied behind his back and submit to taunts\r\nwhich he little deserved. That he could carry on this struggle for so\r\nmany years, without embittering the issues, and without open exposure of\r\nthe family quarrel, shows the strength of character which he had gained\r\nby years of religious discipline and self-control.\r\n\r\nPolitics proper played but a small part in his career. The politicians\r\nfound early that he was not of the 'available' type--that he would not\r\nlend himself to party policy or compromise on any matter which seemed to\r\nhim of national interest. Such political posts as were offered to him\r\nwere largely held out as a bait to silence him, and to prevent his\r\nbringing forward embarrassing measures which might split the party.\r\nAshley himself found how much easier it was for him to follow a single\r\ncourse when he was an independent member. Reluctantly in 1834 he\r\naccepted a post at the Board of Admiralty and worked earnestly in his\r\ndepartment; but this ministry only lasted for one year, and he never\r\nheld office again, though he was often pressed to do so. He was attached\r\nto Wellington; but for Peel, now become the Tory leader, he had little\r\nlove. The two men were very dissimilar in character; and though at times\r\nAshley had friendly communications with Peel, yet in his diary Ashley\r\noften complains bitterly of his want of enthusiasm, of what he regarded\r\nas Peel's opportunism and subservience to party policy. The one had an\r\ninstinct for what was practical and knew exactly how far he could\r\ncombine interests to carry a measure; the other was all on fire for the\r\ncause and ready to push it forward against all obstacles, at all costs.\r\nAshley, it is true, had to work through Parliament to attain his chief\r\nends, and many a bitter moment he had to endure in striving towards the\r\ngoal. But if he was not an adroit or successful politician, he\r\ngradually, as the struggle went on, by earnestness and force of\r\ncharacter, made for himself in the House a place apart, a place of rare\r\ndignity and influence; and with the force of public opinion behind him\r\nhe was able to triumph over ministers and parties.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1832 that he first had his attention drawn to the conditions\r\nof labour in factories. He never claimed to be the pioneer of the\r\nmovement, but he was early in the field. The inventions of the latter\r\npart of the eighteenth century had transformed the north of England. The\r\ndemand for labour had given rise to appalling abuses, especially in the\r\nmatter of child labour. From London workhouses and elsewhere children\r\nwere poured into the labour market, and by the 'Apprentice System' were\r\nbound to serve their masters for long periods and for long hours\r\ntogether. A pretence of voluntary contract was kept up, but fraud and\r\ndeception were rife in the system and its results were tragic. Mrs.\r\nBrowning's famous poem, 'The Cry of the Children,' gives a more vivid\r\npicture of the children's sufferings than many pages of prose. At the\r\nsame time we have plenty of first-hand evidence from the great towns of\r\nthe misery which went along with the wonderful development of national\r\nwealth. Speaking in 1873 Lord Shaftesbury said, 'Well can I recollect in\r\nthe earlier periods of the Factory movement waiting at the factory gates\r\nto see the children come out, and a set of dejected cadaverous creatures\r\nthey were. In Bradford especially the proofs of long and cruel toil were\r\nmost remarkable. The cripples and distorted forms might be numbered by\r\nhundreds perhaps by thousands. A friend of mine collected together a\r\nvast number for me; the sight was most piteous, the deformities\r\nincredible.' And an eye-witness in Bolton reports in 1792: 'Anything\r\nlike the squalid misery, the slow, mouldering, putrefying death by which\r\nthe weak and feeble are perishing here, it never befell my eyes to\r\nbehold, nor my imagination to conceive.' Some measures of relief were\r\ncarried by the elder Sir Robert Peel, himself a cotton-spinner; but\r\npublic opinion was slow to move and was not roused till 1830, when Mr.\r\nSadler,[16] member for Newark, led the first fight for a 'Ten Hours\r\nBill'. When Sadler was unseated in 1832, Lord Ashley offered his help,\r\nand so embarked on the greatest of his works performed in the public\r\nservice. He had the support of a few of the noblest men in England,\r\nincluding Robert Southey and Charles Dickens; but he had against him the\r\nvast body of well-to-do people in the country, and inside Parliament\r\nmany of the most progressive and influential politicians. The factory\r\nowners were inspired at once by interest and conviction; the political\r\neconomy of the day taught them that all restrictions on labour were\r\nharmful to the progress of industry and to the prosperity of the\r\ncountry, while the figures in their ledgers taught them what was the\r\nmost economical method of running their own mills.\r\n\r\n[Note 16: See articles in _D.N.B._ on Michael Thomas Sadler\r\n(1780-1835) and on Richard Oastler (1789-1861).]\r\n\r\nAlready it was clear that Lord Ashley was no mere sentimentalist out for\r\na momentary sensation. At all times he gave the credit for starting the\r\nwork to Sadler and his associates; and from the outset he urged his\r\nfollowers to fix on a limited measure first, to concentrate attention on\r\nthe work of children and young persons, and to avoid general questions\r\ninvolving conflicts between capital and labour. Also he took endless\r\npains to acquaint himself at first hand with the facts. 'In factories,'\r\nhe said afterwards, 'I examined the mills, the machinery, the homes, and\r\nsaw the workers and their work in all its details. In collieries I went\r\ndown into the pits. In London I went into lodging-houses and thieves'\r\nhaunts, and every filthy place. It gave me a power I could not otherwise\r\nhave had.' And this was years before 'slumming' became fashionable and\r\nfigured in the pages of _Punch_; it was no distraction caught up for a\r\nweek or a month, but a labour of fifty years! We have an account of him\r\nas he appeared at this period of his life: 'above the medium height,\r\nabout 5 feet 6 inches, with a slender and extremely graceful figure...\r\ncurling dark hair in thick masses, fine brow, features delicately cut,\r\nthe nose perhaps a trifle too prominent,... light blue eyes deeply set\r\nwith projecting eyelids, his mouth small and compressed.' His whole face\r\nand appearance seems to have had a sculpturesque effect and to have\r\nsuggested the calm and composure of marble. But under this marble\r\nexterior there was burning a flame of sympathy for the poor, a fire of\r\nindignation against the system which oppressed them.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 some progress was made. Lord Althorp, the Whig leader in the\r\nCommons, under pressure from Lord Ashley, carried a bill dealing indeed\r\nwith some of the worst abuses in factories, but applying only to some of\r\nthe great textile industries. That it still left much to be done can be\r\nseen from studying the details of the measure. Children under eleven\r\nyears of age were not to work more than nine hours a day, and young\r\npersons under nineteen not more than twelve hours a day. Adults might\r\nstill work all day and half the night if the temptation of misery at\r\nhome and extra wages to be earned was too strong for them. It seems\r\ndifficult now to believe that this was a great step forward, yet for the\r\nmoment Ashley found that he could do no more and must accept what the\r\npoliticians gave him. In 1840, however, he started a fresh campaign on\r\nbehalf of children not employed in these factories, who were not\r\nincluded in the Act of 1833, and who, not being concentrated in the\r\ngreat centres of industry, escaped the attention of the general public.\r\nHe obtained a Royal Commission to investigate mines and other works, and\r\nto report upon their condition. The Blue Book was published in 1842 and\r\ncreated a sensation unparalleled of its kind. Men read with horror the\r\nstories of the mines, of children employed underground for twelve or\r\nfourteen hours a day, crouching in low passages, monotonously opening\r\nand shutting the trap-doors as the trollies passed to and fro. Alone\r\neach child sat in pitchy darkness, unable to stir for more than a few\r\npaces, unable to sleep for fear of punishment with the strap in case of\r\nneglect, and often surrounded with vermin. Women were employed crawling\r\non hands and knees along these passages, stripped to the waist, stooping\r\nunder the low roofs, and even so chafing and wounding their backs, as\r\nthey hauled the coal along the underground rails, or carrying in baskets\r\non their backs, up steps and ladders, loads which varied in weight from\r\na half to one and a half hundredweights. The physical health, the mental\r\neducation, and the moral character of these poor creatures suffered\r\nequally under such a system; and well might those responsible for the\r\nexistence of such abuses fear to let the Report be published. But copies\r\nof it first reached members of Parliament, then the public at large\r\nlearnt the burden of the tale, and Lord Ashley might now hope for enough\r\nsupport from outside to break down the opposition in the House of\r\nCommons and the delays of parliamentary procedure.\r\n\r\n'The Mines and Collieries Bill' was brought in before the impression\r\ncould fade, and on June 7, 1842, Ashley made one of the greatest of his\r\nspeeches and drove home powerfully the effect of the Report. His mastery\r\nof facts was clear enough to satisfy the most dispassionate politician;\r\nhis sincerity disarmed Richard Cobden, the champion of the Lancashire\r\nmanufacturers and brought about a reconciliation between them; his\r\neloquence stirred the hearts of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort,\r\nand drew from the latter words of glowing admiration and promises of\r\nsupport. In August the bill finally passed the House of Lords, and a\r\nsecond great blow had been struck. Practices which were poisoning at the\r\nsource the lives of the younger generation were forbidden by law; above\r\nall, it was expressly laid down that, after a few years, no woman or\r\ngirl should be employed in mines at all. The influence which such a law\r\nhad on the family life in the mining districts was incalculable; the\r\nwomen were rescued from servitude in the mines and restored to their\r\nnatural place at home.\r\n\r\nThere was still much to do. In 1844 the factory question was again\r\nbrought to the front by the demands of the working classes, and again\r\nAshley was ready to champion their cause, and to propose that the\r\nworking day should now be limited to eight hours for children, and to\r\nten hours for grown men. In Parliament there was long and weary fighting\r\nover the details. The Tory Government did not wish to oppose the bill\r\ndirectly. Neither party had really faced the question or made up its\r\nmind. Expediency rather than justice was in the minds of the official\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nSuch a straightforward champion as Lord Ashley was a source of\r\nembarrassment to these gentlemen, to be met by evasion rather than\r\ndirect opposition. The radical John Bright, a strong opponent of State\r\ninterference and equally straightforward in his methods, made a personal\r\nattack on Lord Ashley. He referred to the Dorset labourers, as if Ashley\r\nwas indifferent to abuses nearer home, and left no one in doubt of his\r\nopinions. At the same time, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary, did\r\nall in his power to defeat Ashley's bill by bringing forward alternative\r\nproposals, which he knew would be unacceptable to the workers. In face\r\nof such opposition most men would have given way. Ashley, who had been a\r\nconsistent Tory all his life, was bitterly aggrieved at the treatment\r\nwhich his bill met with from his official leaders. He persevered in his\r\nefforts, relying on support from outside; but in Parliament the\r\nGovernment triumphed to the extent of defeating the Ten Hours Bill in\r\nMarch 1844 and again in April 1846. Still, the small majority (ten) by\r\nwhich this last division was decided showed in which direction the\r\ncurrent was flowing, and when a few months later the Tories were ousted\r\nfrom office, the Whigs took up the bill officially, and in June 1847\r\nLord Ashley, though himself out of Parliament for the moment, had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the bill become the law of the land.\r\n\r\nThere was great rejoicing in the manufacturing districts, and Lord\r\nAshley was the hero of the day. The working classes had no direct\r\nrepresentative in Parliament in those days: without his constant efforts\r\nneither party would have given a fair hearing to their cause. He had\r\nargued with politicians without giving away principles; he had stirred\r\nthe industrial districts without rousing class hatred; he had been\r\ndefeated time after time without giving up the struggle. Much has been\r\nadded since then to the laws restricting the conditions of labour till,\r\nin the often quoted words of Lord Morley, the biographer of Cobden, we\r\nhave 'a complete, minute, and voluminous code for the protection of\r\nlabour... an immense host of inspectors, certifying surgeons and other\r\nauthorities whose business it is to \"speed and post o'er land and ocean\"\r\nin restless guardianship of every kind of labour'. But these were the\r\nheroic days of the struggle for factory legislation, and also of the\r\nstruggle for cheap food for the people. Reviewing these great events\r\nmany years later the Duke of Argyll said, 'During that period two great\r\ndiscoveries have been made in the science of Government: the one is the\r\nimmense advantage of abolishing restrictions on trade, the other is the\r\nabsolute necessity of imposing restrictions on labour'. While Sir Robert\r\nPeel might with some justice contest with Cobden the honour of\r\nestablishing the first principle, few will challenge Lord Ashley's right\r\nto the honour of securing the second.\r\n\r\nOf the many religious and political causes which he undertook during and\r\nafter this time, of the Zionist movement to repatriate the Jews, of the\r\nestablishing of a Protestant bishopric at Jerusalem, of his attacks on\r\nthe war with Sind and the opium trade with China, of his championship of\r\nthe Nestorian Christians against the Turk, of his leadership of the\r\ngreat Bible Society, there is not space to speak. The mere list gives an\r\nidea of the width of his interests and the warmth of his sympathy.\r\n\r\nSome of these questions were highly contentious; and Lord Ashley, who\r\nwas a fervent Evangelical, was less than fair to churchmen of other\r\nschools. To Dr. Pusey himself he could write a kindly and courteous\r\nletter; but on the platform, or in correspondence with friends, he could\r\ndenounce 'Puseyites' in the roundest terms. One cannot expect that a man\r\nof his character will avoid all mistakes. It was a time when feeling ran\r\nhigh on religious questions, and he was a declared partisan; but at\r\nleast we may say that the public good, judged from the highest point,\r\nwas his objective; there was no room for self-seeking in his heart. Nor\r\ndid this wide extension of his activity mean neglect of his earlier\r\ncrusades. On the contrary, he continued to work for the good of the\r\nclasses to whom his Factory Bills had been so beneficial. Not content\r\nwith prohibiting what was harmful, he went on to positive measures of\r\ngood; restriction of hours was followed by sanitation, and this again by\r\neducation, and by this he was led to what was perhaps the second most\r\nfamous work of his life.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 his attention had already been drawn to the question of\r\neducating the neglected children, and he was making acquaintance at\r\nfirst hand with the work of the Ragged Schools, at that time few in\r\nnumber and poorly supported. He visited repeatedly the Field Lane\r\nSchool, in a district near Holborn notoriously frequented by the\r\ncriminal classes, and soon the cause, at which he was to work\r\nunsparingly for forty years, began to move forward. He went among the\r\npoor with no thought of condescension. Simple as he was by nature, he\r\npossessed in perfection the art of speaking to children, and he was soon\r\nfull of practical schemes for helping them. Sanitary reform was not\r\nneglected in his zeal for religion, and emigration was to be promoted as\r\nwell as better housing at home; for, till the material conditions of\r\nlife were improved, he knew that it was idle to hope for much moral\r\nreform. 'Plain living and high thinking' is an excellent ideal for those\r\nwhose circumstances put them out of reach of anxiety over daily bread;\r\nit is a difficult gospel to preach to those who are living in\r\ndestitution and misery.\r\n\r\nThe character of his work soon won confidence even in the most unlikely\r\nquarters. In June 1848 he received a round-robin signed by forty of the\r\nmost notorious thieves in London, asking him to come and meet them in\r\nperson at a place appointed; and on his going there he found a mob of\r\nnearly four hundred men, all living by dishonesty and crime, who\r\nlistened readily and even eagerly to his brotherly words.\r\n\r\nSeveral of them came forward in turn and made candid avowal of their\r\nrespective difficulties and vices, and of the conditions of their lives.\r\nHe found that they were tired of their own way of life, and were ready\r\nto make a fresh start; and in the course of the next few months he was\r\nable, thanks to the generosity of a rich friend, to arrange for the\r\nmajority of them to emigrate to another country or to find new openings\r\naway from their old haunts.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from such special occasions, the work of the schools went\r\nsteadily forward. In seven years, more than a hundred such schools were\r\nopened, and Lord Shaftesbury was unfailing in his attendance whenever he\r\ncould help forward the cause. His advice to the managers to 'keep the\r\nschools in the mire and the gutter' sounds curious; but he was afraid\r\nthat, as they throve, boys of more prosperous classes would come in and\r\ndrive out those for whom they were specially founded. 'So long', he\r\nsaid, 'as the mire and gutter exist, so long as this class exists, you\r\nmust keep the school adapted to their wants, their feelings, their\r\ntastes and their level.' And any of us familiar with the novels of\r\nCharles Dickens and Walter Besant will know that such boys still existed\r\nunprovided for in large numbers in 1850 and for many years after.\r\n\r\nThus the years went by. He succeeded to the earldom on his father's\r\ndeath in 1851. His heart was wrung by the early deaths of two of his\r\nchildren and by the loss of his wife in 1872. In his home he had his\r\nfull share of the joys and sorrows of life, but his interest in his work\r\nnever failed. If new tasks were taken up, it was not at the expense of\r\nthe old; the fresh demand on his unwearied energies was met with the\r\nsame spirit. At an advanced age he opened a new and attractive chapter\r\nin his life by his friendly meetings with the London costermongers. He\r\ngave prizes for the best-kept donkey, he attended the judging in person,\r\nhe received in return a present of a donkey which was long cherished at\r\nWimborne St. Giles. It is impossible to deal fully with his life in each\r\ndecade; one page from his journal for 1882 shows what he could still do\r\nat the age of eighty-one, and will be the best proof of his persistence\r\nin well-doing. He began the day with a visit to Greenhithe to inspect\r\nthe training ships for poor boys, at midday he came back to Grosvenor\r\nSquare to attend a committee meeting of the Bible Society at his home,\r\nhe then went to a public banquet in honour of his godson, and he\r\nfinished with a concert at Buckingham Palace, thus keeping up his\r\nfriendly relations with all classes in the realm. To the very last, in\r\nhis eighty-fifth year, he continued to attend a few meetings and to\r\nvisit the scenes of his former labours; and on October 1, 1885, full of\r\nyears and full of honours, he died quietly at Folkestone, where he had\r\ngone for the sake of his health.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch attention has been drawn to his labours rather than to\r\nhis honours. He might have had plenty of the latter if he had wished. He\r\nreceived the Freedom of the City of London and of other great towns.\r\nTwice he was offered the Garter, and he only accepted the second offer\r\non Lord Palmerston's urgent request that he should treat it as a tribute\r\nto the importance of social work. Three times he was offered a seat in\r\nthe Cabinet, but he refused each time, because official position would\r\nfetter his special work. He kept aloof from party politics, and was only\r\nroused when great principles were at stake. Few of the leading\r\npoliticians satisfied him. Peel seemed too cautious, Gladstone too\r\nsubtle, Disraeli too insincere. It was the simplicity and kindliness of\r\nhis relative Palmerston that won his heart, rather than confidence in\r\nhis policy at home or abroad. The House of Commons suited him better\r\nthan the colder atmosphere of the House of Lords; but in neither did he\r\nrise to speak without diffidence and fear. It is a great testimony to\r\nthe force of his conviction that he won as many successes in Parliament\r\nas he did. But the means through which he effected his chief work were\r\ncommittees, platform meetings, and above all personal visits to scenes\r\nof distress.\r\n\r\nThe nation would gladly have given him the last tribute of burial in\r\nWestminster Abbey, but he had expressed a clear wish to be laid among\r\nhis own people at Wimborne St. Giles, and the funeral was as simple as\r\nhe had wished it to be. His name in London is rather incongruously\r\nassociated with a fountain in Piccadilly Circus, and with a street full\r\nof theatres, made by the clearing of the slums where he had worked: the\r\nintention was good, the result is unfortunate. More truly than in any\r\nsculpture or buildings his memorial is to be found in the altered lives\r\nof thousands of his fellow citizens, in the happy looks of the children,\r\nand in the pleasant homes and healthy workshops which have transformed\r\nthe face of industrial England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN LAWRENCE\r\n\r\n1811-79\r\n\r\n1811.

Death in London, June 27.\r\n\r\nJOHN LAWRENCE\r\n\r\nINDIAN ADMINISTRATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe north of Ireland and its Scoto-Irish stock has given birth to some\r\nof the toughest human material that our British Isles have produced. Of\r\nthis stock was John Wesley, who at the age of eighty-five attributed his\r\ngood health to rising every day at four and preaching every day at\r\nfive. Of this was Arthur Wellesley, who never knew defeat and 'never\r\nlost a British gun'. Of this was Alexander Lawrence, sole survivor among\r\nthe officers of the storming party at Seringapatam, who lived to rear\r\nseven stout sons, five of whom went out to service in India, two at\r\nleast to win imperishable fame. His wife, a Miss Knox, came also from\r\nacross the sea; and, if the evidence fails to prove Mr. Bosworth Smith's\r\nstatement that she was akin to the great Reformer, she herself was a\r\nwoman of strong character and great administrative talent. When we\r\nremember John Lawrence's parentage, we need not be surprised at the\r\ncharacter which he bore, nor at the evidence of it to be seen in the\r\ngrand rugged features portrayed by Watts in the picture in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LAWRENCE\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by G. F. Watts in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nOf these parents John Laird Mair Lawrence was the fourth surviving son,\r\none boy, the eldest, having died in infancy. He owed the accident of his\r\nbirth in an English town to his father's regiment being quartered at the\r\ntime in Yorkshire, his first schooling at Bristol to his father's\r\nresidence at Clifton; but when he was twelve years old, he followed his\r\nelder brothers to Londonderry, where his maternal uncle, the Rev. James\r\nKnox, was Headmaster of the Free Grammar School, situated within the\r\nwalls of that famous Protestant fortress. It was a rough school, of\r\nwhich the Lawrence brothers cherished few kindly recollections. It is\r\ndifficult to ascertain what they learnt there: perhaps the grim\r\nsurvivals of the past, town-walls, bastions, and guns, made the deepest\r\nimpression upon them. John's chief friend at school was Robert\r\nMontgomery, whom, many years later, he welcomed as a sympathetic\r\nfellow-worker in India; and the two boys continued their education\r\ntogether at Wraxall in Wiltshire, to which they were transferred in\r\n1825. Here John spent two years, working at his books by fits and\r\nstarts, and finding an outlet for his energy in climbing, kite-flying,\r\nand other unconventional amusements, and then his turn came to profit by\r\nthe goodwill of a family friend, who was an influential man and a\r\ndirector of the East India Company. To this man, John Huddlestone by\r\nname, his brothers Alexander and George owed their commissions in the\r\nIndian cavalry, while Henry had elected for the artillery. John hoped\r\nfor a similar favour, but was offered, in its place, a post in the\r\nIndian Civil Service. This was a cruel disappointment to him as he had\r\nset his heart on the army. In fact he was only reconciled to the\r\nprospect by the influence of his eldest sister Letitia, who held a\r\nunique place as the family counsellor now and throughout her life.\r\n\r\nWhen he sailed first for India at the age of eighteen, John Lawrence had\r\ndone little to give promise of future distinction. He had strong\r\nattachments to his mother and sister; outside the family circle he was\r\nnot eager to make new friends. In his work and in his escapades he\r\nshowed an independent spirit, and seemed to care little what others\r\nthought of him; even at Haileybury, at that time a training-school for\r\nthe service of the East India Company, he was most irregular in his\r\nstudies, though he carried off several prizes; and he seems to have\r\nimpressed his fellows rather as an uncouth person who preferred mooning\r\nabout the college, or rambling alone through the country-side, to\r\nspending his days in the pursuits which they esteemed.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for John Lawrence to take up his work, his brother\r\nHenry, his senior by five years, was also going out to India to rejoin\r\nhis company of artillery, and the brothers sailed together. John had to\r\nspend ten weary months in Calcutta learning languages, and was very\r\nunhappy there. Ill-health was one cause; another was his distaste for\r\nstrangers' society and his longing for home; it was only the definite\r\nprospect of work which rescued him from despondency. He applied for a\r\npost at Delhi; and, as soon as this was granted, he was all eagerness to\r\nleave Calcutta. But he had used the time well in one respect: he had\r\nacquired the power of speaking Persian with ease and fluency, and this\r\nstood him in good stead in his dealings with the princes and the\r\npeasants of the northern races, whose history he was to influence in the\r\ncoming years.\r\n\r\nDelhi has been to many Englishmen besides John Lawrence a city of\r\nabsorbing interest. It had even then a long history behind it, and its\r\nhistory, as we in the twentieth century know, is by no means finished\r\nyet. It stands on the Jumna, the greatest tributary of the Ganges, at a\r\npoint where the roads from the north-west reach the vast fertile basin\r\nof these rivers, full in the path of an invader. Many races had swept\r\ndown on it from the mountain passes before the English soldiery appeared\r\nfrom the south-east; its mosques, its palaces, its gates, recall the\r\nmemory of many princes and conquerors. At the time of Lawrence's arrival\r\nit was still the home of the heir of Akbar and Aurangzeb, the last of\r\nthe great Mughals. The dynasty had been left in 1804, after the wars of\r\nLord Wellesley, shorn of its power, but not robbed of its dignity or\r\nriches. As a result it had degenerated into an abuse of the first order,\r\nsince all the scoundrels of the district infested the palace and preyed\r\nupon its owner, who had no work to occupy him, no call of duty to rouse\r\nhim from sloth and sensuality. The town was filled with a turbulent\r\npopulation of many different tribes, and the work of the European\r\nofficials was exacting and difficult. But at the same time it gave\r\nunique opportunities for an able man to learn the complexity of the\r\nIndian problem; and the knowledge which John Lawrence acquired there\r\nproved of incalculable value to him when he was called to higher posts.\r\n\r\nAt Delhi he was working as an assistant to the Resident, one of a staff\r\nof four or five, with no independent authority. But in 1834 he was given\r\ntemporary charge of the district of P[=a]n[=i]pat, fifty miles to the\r\nnorth, and it is here that we begin to get some measure of the man and\r\nhis abilities. The place was the scene of more than one famous battle in\r\nthe past; armies of Mughals and Persians and Mar[=a]th[=i]s had swept\r\nacross its plains. Its present inhabitants were J[=a]ts, a race widely\r\nextended through the eastern Punjab and the western part of the province\r\nof Agra. Originally invaders from the north, they espoused the religions\r\nof those around them, some Brahman, some Muhammadan, some Sikh, and\r\nsettled down as thrifty industrious peasants; though inclined to\r\npeaceful pursuits, they still preserved some strength of character and\r\nwere the kind of people among whom Lawrence might hope to enjoy his\r\nwork. The duties of the magistrate are generally divided into judicial\r\nand financial. But, as an old Indian official more exhaustively stated\r\nit: 'Everything which is done by the executive government is done by the\r\nCollector in one or another of his capacities--publican, auctioneer,\r\nsheriff, road-maker, timber-dealer, recruiting sergeant, slayer of wild\r\nbeasts, bookseller, cattle-breeder, postmaster, vaccinator, discounter\r\nof bills, and registrar.' It is difficult to see how one can bring all\r\nthese departments under two headings; it is still more difficult to see\r\nhow such diverse demands can possibly be met by a single official,\r\nespecially by one little over twenty years of age coming from a distant\r\ncountry. No stay-at-home fitting himself snugly into a niche in the\r\nwell-manned offices of Whitehall can expect to see his powers develop so\r\nrapidly or so rapidly collapse (whichever be his fate) as these solitary\r\noutposts of our empire, bearing, Atlas-like, a whole world on their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nWith John Lawrence, fortunately, there was no question of collapse till\r\nmany years of overwork broke down his physical strength. He grappled\r\nwith the task like a giant, passing long days in his office or in the\r\nsaddle, looking into everything for himself, laying up stores of\r\nknowledge about land tenure and agriculture, training his judgement to\r\ndeal with the still more difficult problem of the workings of the\r\nOriental mind. He had no friends or colleagues of his own at hand; and\r\nwhen the day's work was done he would spend his evenings holding an\r\ninformal durbar outside his tent, chatting with all and sundry of the\r\nnatives who happened to be there. The peoples of India are familiar with\r\npomp and outward show such as we do not see in the more prosaic west;\r\nbut they also know a man when they see one. And this young man with the\r\nstrongly-marked features, curt speech, and masterful manner, sitting\r\nthere alone in shirt-sleeves and old trousers as he listened to their\r\ntales, was an embodiment of the British rule which they learnt to\r\nrespect--if not to love--for the solid benefits which it conferred upon\r\nthem. He had an element of hardness in him; by many he was thought to be\r\nunduly harsh at different periods of his life; but he spared no trouble\r\nto learn the truth, he was inflexibly just in his decisions, and his\r\nreputation spread rapidly throughout the district. In cases of genuine\r\nneed he could be extremely kind and generous; but he did not lavish\r\nthese qualities on the first comer, nor did he wear his heart upon his\r\nsleeve. His informal ways and unconventional dress were a bugbear to\r\nsome critics; his old waywardness and love of adventure was still alive\r\nin him, and he thoroughly enjoyed the more irregular sides of his work.\r\nMr. Bosworth Smith has preserved some capital stories of the crimes with\r\nwhich he had to deal, and how the young collector took an active part in\r\narresting the criminals--stories which some years later the future\r\nViceroy dictated to his wife.\r\n\r\nBut, after two years thus spent in constant activity and ever-growing\r\nmastery of his work, he had to come down in rank; the post was filled by\r\na permanent official, and John Lawrence returned to the Delhi staff as\r\nan assistant.\r\n\r\nHe soon received other 'acting appointments' in the neighbourhood of\r\nDelhi, one of which at Et[=a]wa gave him valuable experience in dealing\r\nwith the difficult revenue question. The Government was in the habit of\r\ncollecting the land tax from the 'ryot' or peasant through a class of\r\nmiddle-men called 'talukd[=a]rs',[17] who had existed under the native\r\nprinces for a long time. Borrowing perhaps from western ideas, the\r\nEnglish had regarded the latter as landowners and the peasants as mere\r\ntenants; this had often caused grave injustice to the latter, and the\r\nofficials now desired to revise the settlement in order to put all\r\nclasses on a fair footing. In this department Robert Bird was supreme,\r\nand under his direction John Lawrence and others set themselves to\r\nmeasure out areas, to record the nature of the various soils, and to\r\nassess rents at a moderate rate. Still this was dull work compared to\r\nthe planning of practical improvements and the conviction of dangerous\r\ncriminals; and as, towards the end of 1839, Lawrence was struck down by\r\na bad attack of fever, he was not sorry to be ordered home on long leave\r\nand to revisit his native land. He had been strenuously at work for ten\r\nyears on end and he had well earned a holiday.\r\n\r\n[Note 17: 'Talukd[=a]r' in the north-west, 'zam[=i]nd[=a]r' in\r\nBengal.]\r\n\r\nHis father was now dead, and his favourite sister married, but of his\r\nmother he was for many years the chief support, contributing liberally\r\nof his own funds and giving his time and judgement to managing what the\r\nbrothers put together for that purpose. In 1840 he was travelling both\r\nin Scotland and Ireland; and it was near Londonderry that he met his\r\nfuture wife, daughter of the Rev. Richard Hamilton, who, besides being\r\nrector of his parish, was an active justice of the peace. He met her\r\nagain in the following summer, and they were married on August 26, 1841.\r\nTheir life together was a tale of unbroken happiness, which was only\r\nended by his death. A long tour on the Continent was followed by a\r\nsevere illness, which threatened to forbid all prospect of work in\r\nIndia. However, by the end of that summer he had recovered his health\r\nenough to contemplate returning, and in October, 1842, he set sail to\r\nspend another sixteen years in labouring in India.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 he resumed work at Delhi, holding temporary posts till the end\r\nof 1844, when he became in his own right Collector and Magistrate of\r\nDelhi and P[=a]n[=i]pat. This time his position, besides involving much\r\nfamiliar work, threw him in the way of events of wider interest. Lord\r\nHardinge, the Governor-General, on his way to the first Sikh war, came\r\nto Delhi, and was much impressed with Lawrence's ability; and when he\r\nannexed the Do[=a]b[18] of J[=a]landhar and wanted a governor for it, he\r\ncould find no one more suitable than the young magistrate, who had so\r\nswiftly collected 4,000 carts and sent them up laden with supplies on\r\nthe eve of the battle of Sobraon.\r\n\r\n[Note 18: 'Do[=a]b' = land between two rivers.]\r\n\r\nThis was a great step in advance and carried John Lawrence ahead of many\r\nof his seniors; but it was promotion that was fully justified by events.\r\nHe was not wanting in self-confidence, and the tone of some of his\r\nletters to the Secretary at head-quarters might seem boastful, had not\r\nhis whole career shown that he could more than make good his promise.\r\n'So far as I am concerned as supervisor,' he says, 'I could easily\r\nmanage double the extent of country'; and then, comparing his district\r\nwith another, he continues: 'I only ask you to wait six months, and then\r\ncontrast the civil management of the two charges.' As a fact, during the\r\nthree years that he held this post, he was often acting as deputy for\r\nhis brother Henry at Lahore, during his illness or absence, and this\r\nalone clears him of the charge of idle boasting. J[=a]landhar was\r\ncomparatively a simple job for him, whatever it might be for others; he\r\nwas able to apply his knowledge of assessment and taxation gained at\r\nEt[=a]wa, and need only satisfy himself. At Lahore, on the other hand,\r\nhe had to consider the very strong views held by his brother about the\r\nrespect due to the vested rights of the chiefs; and he studiously set\r\nhimself to deal with matters in the way in which his brother would have\r\ndone. The Sirdars or Sikh chieftains had inherited traditions of corrupt\r\nand oppressive rule; but the chivalrous Henry Lawrence always looked at\r\nthe noble side of native character; and, as by his personal gifts he was\r\nable to inspire devotion, so he could draw out what was good in those\r\nwho came under his influence. The cooler and more practical John looked\r\nat both sides, at the traditions, good and evil, which came to them from\r\ntheir forefathers, and he considered carefully how these chiefs would\r\nact when not under his immediate influence. Above all, he looked to the\r\nprosperity and happiness of the millions of peasants out of sight, who\r\ntoiled laboriously to get a living from the land.\r\n\r\nThe second Sikh war, which broke out in 1848, can only be treated here\r\nso far as it affected the fortunes of the Lawrences. Lord Gough's\r\nstrategical blunders, redeemed by splendid courage, give it great\r\nmilitary interest; but it was the new Viceroy, Lord Dalhousie, who\r\ndecided the fate of the Punjab. He was a very able, hard-working Scotch\r\nnobleman, who devoted himself to his work in India for eight years with\r\nsuch self-sacrifice that he returned home in 1856 already doomed to an\r\nearly death. But he was masterful and self-confident to a degree; and\r\nagainst his imperious will the impulsive forces of Charles Napier and\r\nHenry Lawrence broke like waves on a granite coast. He was not blind to\r\ntheir exceptional gifts, but to him the wide knowledge, coolness, and\r\njudgement of John Lawrence made a greater appeal; and when, after the\r\nvictory of Chili[=a]nw[=a]la and the submission of the Sikh army in\r\n1849, he annexed the Punjab, he decided to rule it by a Board and not by\r\na single governor, and to direct the diverse talents of the brothers to\r\na common end. He could not dispense with Henry's influence among the\r\nSikh chieftains, and John's knowledge of civil government was of equal\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nEach would to a certain extent have his department, but a vast number of\r\nquestions would have to be decided jointly by the Board, of which the\r\nthird member, from 1850, was their old schoolfellow and friend Robert\r\nMontgomery. The friction which resulted was often intolerable. Without\r\nthe least personal animosity, the brothers were forced into frequent\r\nconflicts of opinion; each was convinced of the justice of his attitude\r\nand most unwilling to sacrifice the interests of those in whom he was\r\nespecially interested. After three years of the strain, Lord Dalhousie\r\ndecided that it was time to put the country under a single ruler. For\r\nthe honour of being first Chief Commissioner of the Punjab he chose the\r\nyounger brother; and Sir Henry was given the post of Agent in\r\nR[=a]jput[=a]na, from which he was promoted in 1857 to be the first\r\nGovernor of Oudh.\r\n\r\nIt was a tragic parting. The ablest men in the Punjab, like John\r\nNicholson and Herbert Edwardes, regarded Sir Henry as a father, and many\r\nfelt that it would be impossible to continue their work without him. No\r\nEnglishman in India made such an impression by personal influence on\r\nboth Europeans and Asiatics. As a well-known English statesman said:\r\n'His character was far above his career, distinguished as that career\r\nwas.' But there is little doubt, now, that for the development of the\r\nnew province Lord Dalhousie made the right choice. And there is no\r\nhigher proof of the magnanimity of John Lawrence than the way in which\r\nhe won the respect, and retained the services, of the most ardent\r\nsupporters of his brother. His dealings with Nicholson alone would fill\r\na chapter; few lessons are more instructive than the way in which he\r\ncontrolled the waywardness of this heroic but self-willed officer, while\r\ngiving full scope to his singular abilities.\r\n\r\nThe tale of John Lawrence's government of the Punjab is in some measure\r\na repetition of his work at P[=a]n[=i]pat and Delhi. It had the same\r\nvariety, it was carried out with the same thoroughness; but on this vast\r\nfield it was impossible for him to see everything for himself. While\r\ndirecting the policy, he had to work largely through others and to leave\r\nmany important decisions to his subordinates. The quality of the Punjab\r\nofficials--of men who owed their inspiration to Henry Lawrence, or to\r\nJohn, or to both of them--was proved in many fields of government during\r\nthe next thirty years. Soldiers on the frontier passes, judges and\r\nrevenue officers on the plains, all worked with a will and contributed\r\nof their best. The Punjab is from many points of view the most\r\ninteresting province in India. Its motley population, chiefly\r\nMusalm[=a]ns, but including Sikhs and other Hindus; its extremes of heat\r\nand cold, of rich alluvial soil and barren deserts; its vast\r\nwater-supplies, largely running to waste; its great frontier ramparts\r\nwith the historic passes--each of these gave rise to its own special\r\nproblems. It is impossible to deal with so complex a subject here; all\r\nthat we can do is to indicate a few sides of the work by which John\r\nLawrence had so developed the provinces within the short period of eight\r\nyears that it was able to bear the strain of the Mutiny, and to prove a\r\nsource of strength and not of weakness. He put the right men in the\r\nright places and supported them with all his power. He broke up the old\r\nSikh army, and reorganized the forces in such a way as to weaken tribal\r\nfeeling and make it less easy for them to combine against us. He so\r\nadministered justice that the natives came to know that an English\r\nofficial's word was as good as his bond. And, with the aid of Robert\r\nNapier and others, he so helped forward irrigation as to redeem the\r\nwaste places and develop the latent wealth of the country. In all these\r\nyears he had little recognition or reward. His chief, Lord Dalhousie,\r\nvalued his work and induced the Government to make him K.C.B. in 1856;\r\nbut to the general public at home he was still unknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the crisis came. The greased cartridges were an immediate cause;\r\nthere were others in the background. The sepoy regiments were too\r\nlargely recruited from one race, the Poorbeas of the North-west\r\nProvince, and they were too numerous in proportion to the Europeans;\r\nvanity, greed, superstition, fear, all influenced their minds.\r\nFortunately, they produced no leader of ability; and, where the British\r\nofficials were prompt and firm, the sparks of rebellion were swiftly\r\nstamped out; Montgomery at Lahore, Edwardes at Pesh[=a]war, and many\r\nothers, did their part nobly and disarmed whole regiments without\r\nbloodshed. But at Meerut and Cawnpore there was hesitation; rebellion\r\nraised its head, encouragement was given to a hundred local discontents,\r\nlittle rills flowed together from all directions, and finally two great\r\nstreams of rebellion surged round Delhi and Lucknow. The latter, where\r\nHenry Lawrence met a hero's death in July, does not here concern us; but\r\nthe reduction of Delhi was chiefly the work of John Lawrence, and its\r\neffect on the history of the Mutiny was profound.\r\n\r\nHe might well have been afraid for the Punjab, won by conquest from the\r\nmost military race in India only eight years before, lying on the\r\nborders of our old enemy Afgh[=a]nist[=a]n, garrisoned by 11,000\r\nEuropeans and about 50,000 native troops. It might seem a sufficient\r\nachievement to preserve his province to British rule, with rebellion\r\nraging all around and making inroads far within its borders. But as soon\r\nas he had secured the vital points in his own province (Mult[=a]n,\r\nPesh[=a]war, Lahore), John Lawrence devoted himself to a single task, to\r\nrecover Delhi, directing against it every man and gun, and all the\r\nstores that the Punjab could spare. Many of his subordinates, brave men\r\nthough they were, were alarmed to see the Punjab so denuded and exposed\r\nto risks; but we now see the strength of character and determination of\r\nthe man who swayed the fortunes of the north. He knew the importance of\r\nDelhi, of its geographical position and its imperial traditions; and he\r\nfelt sure that no more vital blow could be struck at the Mutiny than to\r\nwin back the city. The effort might seem hopeless; the military\r\ncommanders might hesitate; the small force encamped on the historic\r\nridge to the west of the town might seem to be besieged rather than\r\nbesiegers. But continuous waves of energy from the Punjab reinforced\r\nthem. One day it was 'the Guides', marching 580 miles in twenty-two\r\ndays, or some other European regiment hastening from some hotbed of\r\nfanaticism where it could ill be spared; another day it was a train of\r\nsiege artillery, skilfully piloted across rivers and past ambushes;\r\nlastly, it was the famous moving column led by John Nicholson in person\r\nwhich restored the fortunes of the day. Through June, July, August, and\r\nhalf of September, the operations dragged wearily on; but thanks to the\r\nexertions of Baird Smith and Alexander Taylor, the chief engineers, an\r\nassault was at last judged to be feasible. After days of street\r\nfighting, the British secured control of the whole city on September\r\n20th, and Nicholson, who was fatally wounded in the assault, lived long\r\nenough to hear the tale of victory. Without aid from England this great\r\ntriumph had been won by the resources of the Punjab; and great was the\r\nmoral effect of the news, as it spread through the bazaars.\r\n\r\nThis success did not exhaust Lawrence's energy. For months after, he\r\ncontinued to help Sir Colin Campbell in his operations against Lucknow,\r\nand to correspond with the Viceroy, Lord Canning, and others about the\r\nneeds of the time. More perhaps than any one else, he laboured to check\r\nsavage reprisals and needless brutality, and thereby incurred much odium\r\nwith the more reckless and ignorant officers, who, coming out after the\r\nmost critical hour, talked loudly about punishment and revenge. He was\r\nas cool in victory as he had been firm in the hour of disaster, and\r\nnever ceased to look ahead to rebuilding the shaken edifice on sounder\r\nfoundations when the danger should be past. It was only in the autumn of\r\n1858, when the ship of State was again in smooth water, that he began to\r\nthink of a holiday for himself. He had worked continuously for sixteen\r\nyears; his health was not so strong as of old, and he could not safely\r\ncontinue at his post. He received a Baronetcy and the Grand Cross of the\r\nBath from the Crown, while the Company recognized his great services by\r\nconferring on him a pension of £2,000 a year.\r\n\r\nFrom these heroic scenes it is difficult to pass to the humdrum life in\r\nEngland, the receptions at Windsor, the parties in London, and the\r\ndiscussions on the Indian Council. He himself (though not indifferent to\r\nhonourable recognition of his work) found far more pleasure in the quiet\r\ndays passed in the home circle, the games of croquet on his lawn, and\r\nthe occasional travels in Scotland and Ireland. Four years of repose\r\nwere none too long, for other demands were soon to be made upon him.\r\nWhen Lord Elgin died suddenly in 1863, John Lawrence received the offer\r\nof the highest post under the Crown, and, before the end of the year, he\r\nwas sailing for Calcutta as Governor-General of India.\r\n\r\nIn some ways he was able to fill the place without great effort. He had\r\nnever been a respecter of persons; he had been quite indifferent\r\nwhether his decisions were approved by those about him, and had always\r\nlearnt to walk alone with a single eye to the public good. Also, he had\r\nsuch vast store of knowledge of the land and its inhabitants as no\r\nViceroy before him for many decades. But the ceremonial fatigued him;\r\nand the tradition of working 'in Council', as the Viceroy must, was\r\nembarrassing to one who could always form a decision alone and had\r\nlearnt to trust his own judgement.\r\n\r\nMany of Lawrence's best friends and most trusted colleagues had left\r\nIndia, and he had, seated at his Council board, others who did not share\r\nhis views, and who opposed the measures that he advocated. Especially\r\nwas this true of the distinguished soldier Sir Hugh Rose; and Lawrence\r\nhad to endure the same strain as in 1850, in the days of the Punjab\r\nboard. But he was able to do great service to the country in many ways,\r\nand especially to the agricultural classes by pushing forward large\r\nschemes of irrigation. Finance was one of his strong points, and any\r\nexpenditure which would be reproductive was sure of his support owing to\r\nhis care for the peasants and his love of a sound budget. The period of\r\nhis Viceroyalty was what is generally called uneventful--that is, it was\r\nchiefly given up to such schemes as promoted peace and prosperity, and\r\ndid not witness any extension of our dominions. Even when Robert\r\nNapier's[19] expedition went to Abyssinia, few people in England\r\nrealized that it was organized in India and paid for by India; and the\r\ncredit for its success was given elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Note 19: Created Lord Napier of Magdala after storming King\r\nTheodore's fortress in 1868.]\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary to refer to one great subject of controversy, which\r\nwas prominent all through Lawrence's career and with which his name is\r\nassociated. This is the 'Frontier Policy' and the treatment of\r\nAfgh[=a]nist[=a]n, on which two distinct schools of thought emerged.\r\nOne school, ever jealous of the Russian advance, maintained that our\r\nIndian Government should establish agencies in Afgh[=a]nist[=a]n with or\r\nwithout the consent of the Am[=i]r; that it should interfere, if need\r\nbe, to secure the throne for a prince who was attached to us; that\r\nBritish troops should be stationed beyond the Indus, where they could\r\nmake their influence felt beyond our borders. The other maintained that\r\nour best policy was to keep within our natural boundaries, and in this\r\nrespect the Indus with its fringe of desert was second only to the high\r\nmountain chains; that we should recognize the wild love of independence\r\nwhich the Afgh[=a]ns felt, that we should undertake no obligations\r\ntowards the Am[=i]r except to observe the boundaries between him and us.\r\nIf the Russians threatened our territories through Afgh[=a]nist[=a]n,\r\nthe natives would help us from hatred of the invaders; but if we began\r\nto establish agents and troops in their towns, we should ourselves\r\nbecome to them the hated enemy.\r\n\r\nOne school said that the Afgh[=a]ns respected strength and would support\r\nus, if we seemed capable of a vigorous policy. The other replied that\r\nthey resented foreign intrusion and would oppose Great Britain or\r\nRussia, if either attempted it. One said that we ought to have a\r\nresident in K[=a]bul and Kandah[=a]r, the other said that it was a pity\r\nthat we had ever occupied Pesh[=a]war, in its exposed valley at the foot\r\nof the Khyber Pass, and that Attock, where the Indus was bridged, was\r\nthe ideal frontier post.\r\n\r\nNo one doubted that Lawrence would be found on the side of the less\r\nshowy and less costly policy; and he kept unswervingly true to his\r\nideal. The verdict of history must not be claimed too confidently in a\r\nland which has seen so many races come and go. At least it may be said\r\nthat the men who advocated advance were unable to make it good. Few\r\nchapters in our history are more tragic than the Afgh[=a]n Wars of\r\n1838-42 and 1878-80, though the last was redeemed by General Roberts's\r\ngreat achievements. Our present policy is in accord with this verdict.\r\nThere is to-day no British agency at K[=a]bul or Kandah[=a]r; and the\r\nloyalty of the Am[=i]rs, during some forty years of faithful adherence\r\non our part to this policy, have been sufficiently firm to justify\r\nLawrence's opposition to the Forward Policy. To-day it seems easy to\r\nvindicate his wisdom; but in 1878, when the Conservative Government\r\nkindled the war fever and allowed Lord Lytton to initiate a new\r\nadventure, it was not easy to stem the tide, and Lawrence came in for\r\nmuch abuse and unpopularity in maintaining the other view.\r\n\r\nBut long before this happened he had returned to England. His term of\r\noffice was over early in 1869, and his work in India was finished. His\r\nlast years at home were quiet, but not inactive. In 1870 he was invited\r\nto become the first chairman of the new School Board for London, and he\r\nheld this office three years. Board work was always uncongenial to him,\r\nand the subject was, of course, unfamiliar; but he gave his best efforts\r\nto the cause and did other voluntary work in London. This came to an end\r\nin 1876, when his eyesight failed, and for nearly two years he had much\r\nsuffering and was in danger of total blindness for a time. A second\r\noperation saved him from this, and in 1878 he put forth his strength in\r\nwriting and speaking vigorously, but without success, against Lord\r\nLytton's Afgh[=a]n War. In June, 1879, he was stricken with sudden\r\nillness, and died a week later in his seventieth year. It was hardly to\r\nbe expected that one who had spent himself so freely, amid such stirring\r\nevents, should live beyond the Psalmist's span of life.\r\n\r\nHe had started at the bottom of the official ladder; by his own efforts\r\nhe had won his way to the top; and his career will always be a notable\r\nexample to those young Englishmen who cross the sea to serve the Empire\r\nin our great Dependency with its 300 million inhabitants. How the\r\nrelations between India and Great Britain will develop--how long the\r\nconnexion will last may be debated by politicians and authors; it is in\r\ncareers like that of John Lawrence (and there were many such in the\r\nnineteenth century) that the noblest fruit of the connexion may be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BRIGHT\r\n\r\n1811-89\r\n\r\n\r\n1811.

Dies at Rochdale, March 29.\r\n\r\nJOHN BRIGHT\r\n\r\nTRIBUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word 'tribune' comes to us from the early days of the Roman\r\nRepublic; and even in Rome the tribunate was unlike all other\r\nmagistracies. The holder had no outward signs of office, no satellites\r\nto execute his commands, no definite department to administer like the\r\nconsul or the praetor. It was his first function to protest on behalf of\r\nthe poorer citizens against the violent exercise of authority, and, on\r\ncertain occasions, to thwart the action of other magistrates. He was to\r\nbe the champion of the weak and helpless against the privileged orders;\r\nand his power depended on his courage, his eloquence, and the\r\nprestige of his office. England has no office of the sort in her\r\nconstitutional armoury; but the word 'tribune' expresses, better than\r\nany other title, the position occupied in our political life by many of\r\nthe men who have been the conspicuous champions of liberty, and few\r\nwould contest the claim of John Bright to a foremost place among them.\r\nHe, too, stood forth to vindicate the rights of the _plebs_; he, too,\r\nresisted the will of governments; and in no common measure did he give\r\nevidence, through forty years of public life, of the possession of the\r\nhighest eloquence and the highest courage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by W. W. Ouless in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nHis early life gave little promise of a great career. He was born in\r\n1811, the son of Jacob Bright, of Rochdale, who had risen by his own\r\nefforts to the ownership of a small cotton-mill in Lancashire, a man of\r\nsimple benevolence and genuine piety, and a member of the Society of\r\nFriends--a society more familiar to us under the name of Quakers, though\r\nthis name is not employed by them in speaking of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe boy left home early, and between the ages of eight and fifteen he\r\nwas successively a pupil at five Quaker schools in the north of England.\r\nHere he enjoyed little comfort, and none of the aristocratic seclusion\r\nin which most statesmen have been reared at Eton and Harrow. He rubbed\r\nshoulders with boys of various degrees of rank and wealth, and learnt to\r\nbe simple, true, and serious-minded; but he was in no way remarkable at\r\nthis age. We hear little of his recreations, and still less of his\r\nreading; the school which pleased him most and did him most good was the\r\none which he attended last, lying among the moors on the borders of\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire. In the river Hodder he learnt to swim; still\r\nmore he learnt to fish, and it was fishing which remained his favourite\r\noutdoor pastime throughout his life.\r\n\r\nWhen school-days were over--at the age of fifteen--there was no question\r\nof the University: a rigorous life awaited him and he began at once to\r\nwork in his father's business. The mill stood close beside his father's\r\nhouse at Greenbank near Rochdale, some ten miles northward from\r\nManchester, and had been built in 1809 by Jacob Bright, out of a capital\r\nlent to him by two members of the Society of Friends. Here he received\r\nbales of new cotton by canal or from carriers, span it in his mill, and\r\ngave out the warp and weft thus manufactured to handloom weavers, whom\r\nhe paid by the piece to weave it in the weaving chamber at the top of\r\ntheir own houses. He then sold the fully manufactured article in\r\nManchester or elsewhere. In such surroundings, many a clever boy has\r\ndeveloped into a hard-headed prosperous business man; material interests\r\nhave cased in his soul, and he has been content to limit his thoughts to\r\nbuying and selling, to the affairs of his factory and his town, and he\r\nhas heard no call to other fields of work. But John Bright's education\r\nin books and in life was only just beginning, and though it may be\r\nregrettable that he missed the leisured freedom of university life, we\r\nmust own that he really made good the loss by his own effort (and that\r\nwithout neglecting the work of the mill), and thereby did much to\r\nstrengthen the independence of his character.\r\n\r\nIn the mill he was the earliest riser, and often spent hours before\r\nbreakfast at his books. History and poetry were his favourite reading,\r\nand periodicals dealing with social and political questions; his taste\r\nwas severe and had the happiest effect in chastening his oratorical\r\nstyle. To him, as to the earnest Puritans of the seventeenth century,\r\nthe Bible and Milton were a peculiar joy; no other stories were so\r\nmoving, no other music so thrilling to the ear. In his family there was\r\nno want of good talk. His mother, who died in 1830, was a woman of great\r\ngifts, who helped largely in developing the minds of her children.\r\nAfter her death John continued to live with his sisters, who were clever\r\nand original in mind, becoming the leader in the home circle, where\r\nviews were freely exchanged on the questions of the day.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Friends was adverse to political discussion, as\r\ninterfering with the religious life. But the Brights could not be kept\r\nfrom such a field of interest; and during these years theirs, like many\r\nother quiet homes, was stirred by the excitement roused by the fortunes\r\nof the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nThe mill, too, did much to educate him. In the Rochdale factory there\r\nwas no marked separation as at Manchester between rich and poor. Master\r\nand men lived side by side, knew one another's family history and\r\nfortunes, and fraternized over their joys and sorrows. Even in those\r\ndays of backward education 'Old Jacob' made himself responsible for the\r\nschooling of his workmen's children; his son, too, made personal friends\r\namong those working under him and kept them throughout his life. Outside\r\nthe mill Rochdale offered opportunities which he readily took. In 1833\r\nhe became one of the founders and first president of a debating society,\r\nand he began early to address Bible meetings and to lecture on\r\ntemperance in his native town, moved by no conscious idea of learning to\r\nspeak in public, but by the simple desire to be useful in good work. In\r\nsuch holidays as he took he was eager to travel abroad and to learn more\r\nof the outside world, and before he started at the age of twenty-four on\r\nhis longest travels (a nine months' journey to Palestine and the eastern\r\nMediterranean) he had, by individual effort, fitted himself to hold his\r\nown with the best students of the universities in width of outlook and\r\ncapacity for mastering a subject. Like them, he had his limitations and\r\nhis prejudices; but however we may admire wide toleration in itself,\r\ndepth and intensity of feeling are often of more value to a man in\r\nenabling him to influence his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe year of Queen Victoria's accession may be counted a landmark in the\r\nlife of this great Victorian. Then for the first time he met Richard\r\nCobden, who was destined to extend his labours and to share his glory;\r\nand in the following year he began to co-operate actively in the Free\r\nTrade cause, attending meetings in the Rochdale district and gradually\r\ndeveloping his power of speaking. It was about this time that he came to\r\nknow his first wife, Elizabeth Priestman, of the Society of Friends, in\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, a woman of refined nature and rare gifts, whom he was\r\nto marry in 1839 and to lose in 1841. Then it was that he built the\r\nhouse 'One Ash', facing the same common as the house in which he was\r\nborn. Here he lived many years, and here he died in the fullness of\r\ntime, a Lancashire man, content to dwell among his own people, in his\r\nnative town, and to forgo the grandeur of a country house. It was from\r\nhere that he was called in the decisive hour of his life to take part in\r\na national work with which his name will ever be associated. At the\r\nmoment when Bright was prostrated with grief at his wife's death Cobden\r\nappeared on the scene and made his historic appeal. He urged his friend\r\nto put aside his private grief, to remember the miseries of so many\r\nother homes, miseries due directly to the Corn Laws, to put his shoulder\r\nto the wheel, and never to rest till they were repealed.\r\n\r\nCobden had been less happy than Bright in his schooling. His father's\r\nmisfortune led to his spending five years at a Yorkshire school of the\r\nworst type, and seven more as clerk in the warehouse of an unsympathetic\r\nuncle. Like Bright, he had early to take the lead in his own family;\r\nalso, like Bright, he had to educate himself; but he had a far harder\r\nstruggle, and the enterprise which he showed in commerce in early\r\nmanhood would have left him the possessor of a vast fortune, had he not\r\npreferred to devote his energies to public causes. The two men were by\r\nnature well suited to complement one another. If Cobden was the more\r\ningenious in explaining an argument, Bright was more forcible in\r\nasserting a principle. If Cobden could, above all other men, convince\r\nthe intellects of his hearers, Bright could, as few other speakers,\r\nkindle their spirits for a fray. His figure on a platform was striking.\r\nHis manly expressive face, with broad brow, straight nose, and square\r\nchin, was essentially English in type. Though in the course of his\r\npolitical career he discarded the distinctive Quaker dress, he never\r\ndiscarded the Quaker simplicity. His costume was plain, his style of\r\nspeaking severe, his bearing dignified and restrained. Only when his\r\nindignation was kindled at injustice was he swept far away from the\r\ncalmness of Quaker tradition.\r\n\r\nThe Corn Laws were a sequel to the Napoleonic wars and to the insecurity\r\nof foreign trade which these caused. While war lasted it had inflated\r\nprices, and brought to English growers of corn a period of extraordinary\r\nprosperity. When peace came, to escape from a sudden fall in prices, the\r\nlanded proprietors, who formed a majority of the House of Commons, had\r\nfixed by Act of Parliament the conditions under which corn might be\r\nimported from abroad. This measure was to perpetuate by law, in time of\r\npeace, the artificial conditions from which the people had unavoidably\r\nsuffered by the accident of war. The legislators paid no heed to the\r\ngrowth of population, which was enormous, or to the distress of the\r\nworking classes, who needed time to adjust themselves to the rapid\r\nchanges in industry. Even the middle classes suffered, and the poor\r\ncould only meet such trouble by 'clemming' or self-starvation. A noble\r\nduke, speaking in all good faith, advised them to 'try a pinch of curry\r\npowder in hot water', as making the pangs of hunger less intolerable.\r\nHe met with little thanks for his advice from the sufferers, who\r\ndemanded a radical cure. Parliament as a whole showed few signs of\r\nwishing to probe the question more deeply, and shut its eyes to the\r\nevidence of distress, whether shown in peaceful petitions or in\r\ndisorderly riots. Many of the members were personally humane men and\r\ngood landlords; but there were no powerful newspapers to enlighten them,\r\nand they knew little of the state of the manufacturing districts.\r\n\r\nThe cause had now found its appropriate champions. We in this day are\r\nfamiliar with appeals to the great mass of the people: we know the story\r\nof Midlothian campaigns and Belfast reviews; we hear the distant thunder\r\nfrom Liverpool, Manchester, or Birmingham, when the great men of\r\nParliament go down from London to thrill vast audiences in the\r\nprovincial towns. But the agitation of the Anti-Corn-Law League was a\r\nnew thing. It was initiated by men unknown outside the Manchester\r\ndistrict; few of the thousands to whom it was directed possessed the\r\nvote; and yet it wrought one of the greatest changes of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, a change of which the influence is perhaps not yet spent. In\r\nthis campaign, Cobden and Bright were, without doubt, the leading\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nThe movement filled five years of Bright's life. His hopes and fears\r\nmight alternate--at one moment he was stirred to exultation over\r\nsuccess, at another to regrets at the break-up of his home life, at\r\nanother to bitter complaints and hatred of the landed interest--but his\r\nexertions never relaxed. As he was so often absent, the business at\r\nRochdale had to be entrusted to his brother. Whenever he could be there,\r\nBright was at his home with his little motherless daughter; but his\r\nefforts on the platform were more and more appreciated each year, and\r\nthe campaign made heavy demands upon him.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, on the site of the\r\n'Peterloo' riots, he won a signal triumph. The vast audience was\r\nenthusiastic: several of them also were discriminating in their praise.\r\nOne lady said that the chief charm of Mr. Bright was in the simplicity\r\nof his manner, the total absence of anything like showing off; another\r\nthat she should never attend another meeting if he were announced to\r\nspeak, as she could not bear the excitement. Simplicity and profound\r\nemotion were the secrets of his influence. The London Opera House saw\r\nsimilar scenes once a month, from 1843 till the end of the struggle.\r\nVillages and towns, and all classes of society, were instructed in the\r\nprinciples of the League and induced to help forward the cause. Not only\r\ndid the wealthy factory owner, conscious as he was of the loss which the\r\nhigh price of food inflicted on the manufacturing interest, contribute\r\nhis thousands; the factory hand too contributed his mite to further the\r\nwelfare of his class. Even farmers were led to take a new view of the\r\nneeds of agriculture, and the country labourer was made to see that his\r\nadvantage lay in the success of the League. It was a farm-hand who put\r\nthe matter in a nutshell at one of the meetings: 'I be protected,' he\r\nsaid, 'and I be starving.'\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Bright joined his leader in Parliament as member for Durham\r\ncity, though his Quaker relatives disapproved of the idea that one of\r\ntheir society should so far enter the world and take part in its\r\nconflicts. In the House of Commons he met with scant popularity but with\r\ngeneral respect. He was no mob orator of the conventional type. The\r\nsimplicity and good taste of his speeches satisfied the best judges. He\r\nexpressed sentiments hateful to his hearers in such a way that they\r\nmight dislike the speech, but could not despise the speaker. Even when\r\nhe boldly attacked the Game Laws in an assembly of landowners, the House\r\nlistened to him respectfully, and the spokesman of the Government\r\nthanked him for the tone and temper of his speech, admitting that he had\r\nmade out a strong case. But it was in the country and on the platform\r\nthat the chief efforts of Cobden and Bright were made, and their chief\r\nsuccesses won.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 they had an unexpected but most influential ally. Nature herself\r\ntook a hand in the game. From 1842 to 1844 the bad effects of the Corn\r\nLaws were mitigated by good harvests and by the wise measures of Peel in\r\nfreeing trade from various restrictions. But in 1845 first the corn, and\r\nthen the potato crop, failed calamitously. Peel's conscience had been\r\nuneasy for years: he had been studying economics, and his conclusions\r\ndid not square with the orthodox Tory creed. So when the Whig leader,\r\nLord John Russell, ventured to express himself openly for Free Trade in\r\nhis famous Edinburgh letter of November 28, Peel at last saw some chance\r\nof converting his party. It has already been told in this book how at\r\nlength he succeeded in his aims, how he broke up his party but saved the\r\ncountry, and how in the hour of mingled triumph and defeat he generously\r\ngave to Cobden the chief credit for success. Whigs and Tories might\r\ntaunt one another with desertion of principles, or might claim that\r\ntheir respective leaders collaborated at the end; certainly the question\r\nwould never have been put before the Cabinet or the House of Commons as\r\na Government measure but for the untiring efforts of the two Tribunes.\r\nHistory can show few greater triumphs of Government by moral suasion and\r\nthe art of speech. Throughout, violence had been eschewed, even though\r\nmen were starving, and appeals had been made solely to the justice and\r\nexpediency of their case. Nothing illustrates better the sincerity and\r\ndisinterestedness of John Bright than his conduct in these last decisive\r\nmonths. The tide was flowing with him; the opposition was reduced to a\r\nshadow. He might have enjoyed the luxury of applause from Radicals,\r\nWhigs, and the more advanced Tories, and won easy victories over a\r\nhostile minority. But the cause was now in the safe hands of Peel, whose\r\nhonesty they respected and whose generalship they trusted; so Cobden and\r\nBright were content to stand aside and watch. Instead of carping at his\r\ntardy conversion, Bright wrote in generous praise of Peel's speech: 'I\r\nnever listened', he said, 'to any human being speaking in public with so\r\nmuch delight.' His heart was in the cause and not in his own\r\nadvancement. When he did rise to speak, it was to vindicate Peel's\r\nhonour and his statesmanship.\r\n\r\nA few months later this honourable alliance came to an abrupt end.\r\nBright was forced, by the same incorruptible sense of right and by the\r\nabsence of all respect of persons, to oppose Peel in the crisis of his\r\nfate. The Government brought in an Irish Coercion Bill, which was\r\nnaturally opposed by the Whigs. The Protectionist Tories saw their\r\nchance of taking revenge on Peel for repealing the Corn Laws and made\r\ncommon cause with their enemies; and from very different motives, Bright\r\nwent into the same lobby. His conscience forbade him to support any\r\ncoercive measure. No Prime Minister could please him as much as Peel;\r\nbut no surrender, no mere evasion of responsibilities was possible in\r\nthe case of a measure of which he disapproved. So firm was the bed-rock\r\nof principle on which Bright's political conduct was based; and it was\r\nto this uncompromising sincerity above all that he owed the triumphs of\r\nhis oratory.\r\n\r\nHis method as an orator is full of interest.[20] In his youth he had\r\nbegun by writing out and learning his speeches in full; but, before he\r\nquitted Rochdale for a wider theatre, he had discarded this rather\r\nmechanical method, and trusted more freely to his growing powers. He\r\nstill made careful preparation for his speeches. He tells us how he\r\noften composed them in bed, as Carlyle's 'rugged Brindley' wrestled in\r\nbed with the difficulties of his canal-schemes, the silence and the dim\r\nlight favouring the birth of ideas. He prepared words as well as ideas;\r\nbut he only committed to memory enough to be a guide to him in marking\r\nthe order and development of his thoughts, and filled up the original\r\noutline according to the inspiration of the moment. A few sentences,\r\nwhere the balance of words was carefully studied; a few figures of\r\nspeech, where his imagination had taken flight into the realm of poetry;\r\na few notable illustrations from history or contemporary politics, with\r\ndetails of names and figures,--these would be found among the notes\r\nwhich he wrote on detached slips of paper and dropped successively into\r\nhis hat as each milestone was attained. As compared with his illustrious\r\nrival Gladstone, he was very sparing of gesture, depending partly on\r\nfacial expression, still more on the modulations of his voice, to give\r\nlife to the words which he uttered. His reading had formed his diction,\r\nhis constant speaking had taught him readiness, and his study of great\r\nquestions at close quarters and his meditation on them supplied him with\r\nthe facts and the conclusions which he wished to put forward; but the\r\nfire which kindled this material to white heat was the passion for great\r\nprinciples which glowed in his heart. He himself in 1868, in returning\r\nthanks for the gift of the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh, quoted with\r\nobvious sincerity a sentence from his favourite Milton: 'True eloquence\r\nI find to be none but the serious and hearty love of Truth.'\r\n\r\n[Note 20: See G. M. Trevelyan, _Life of John Bright_, pp. 384-5.]\r\n\r\nBright's public life was in the main a tale of devotion to two great\r\ncauses, the Repeal of the Corn Laws, consummated in 1846, and the\r\nextension of the Franchise, which was not realized till twenty years\r\nlater. But he found time to examine other questions and to utter shrewd\r\nopinions on the government of India and of Ireland, and to influence\r\nEnglish sentiment on the Crimean War and the War of Secession in the\r\nUnited States. In advance of his time, he wished to develop\r\ncotton-growing in India and so to prevent the great industry of his own\r\ndistrict being dependent on America alone. He attacked the existing\r\nboard of directors and preferred immediate control by the Crown; and,\r\nwhile wishing to preserve the Viceroy's supremacy over the whole, he\r\nspoke in favour of admitting Indians to a larger share in the government\r\nof the various provinces. Many of the best judges of to-day are now\r\nworking towards the same end, but at the time he met with little\r\nsupport. It is interesting to find that both on India and on Ireland\r\nsimilar views were put forward by men so different as John Bright and\r\nBenjamin Disraeli. Mr. Trevelyan has preserved the memory of several\r\nepisodes in which they were connected with one another and of attempts\r\nwhich Disraeli made to win Bright's support and co-operation. Bright\r\ncould cultivate friendships with politicians of very different schools\r\nwithout being induced to deviate by a hair's breadth from the cause\r\nwhich his principles dictated, and he could treat his friends, at times,\r\nwith refreshing frankness. When Disraeli warmly admired one of his\r\ngreatest speeches and expressed the wish that he himself could emulate\r\nit, the outspoken Quaker replied: 'Well, you might have made it, if you\r\nhad been honest.'\r\n\r\nIt was the young Disraeli who, as early as 1846, had attributed the\r\nIrish troubles to 'a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and\r\nan alien church'. It was Bright who never hesitated, when opportunity\r\narose, to work for the Disestablishment of the Church in Ireland and for\r\nthe security of Irish tenants in their holdings. A succession of\r\nmeasures, carried by Liberals and Conservatives from Gladstone to\r\nGeorge Wyndham, have made us familiar with the idea of land purchase in\r\nIreland; but Bright had been there as early as 1849 and had learnt for\r\nhimself. Though at the end of his life he was a stubborn opponent of\r\nGladstone's Home Rule Bill, he had long ago won the gratitude of Ireland\r\nas no other Englishman of his day, and his name has been preserved there\r\nin affectionate remembrance.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, the year of the Crimean War, Bright reached the zenith of his\r\noratorical power, and at the same time touched the nadir of his\r\npopularity. Public opinion was setting strongly against Russia. In\r\nstemming the tide of war the so-called 'Manchester school' had a\r\ndifficult task, and was severely criticized. The idea of the 'balance of\r\npower' made little appeal to Bright; and as a Quaker he was reluctant to\r\nsee England interfering in a quarrel which did not seem to concern her.\r\nThe satirists indeed scoffed unfairly at the doctrine of 'Peace at any\r\nprice'; for Bright was content to put aside the principle and to argue\r\nthe case on pure political expediency. But his attacks on the wars of\r\nthe last century were too often couched in an offensive tone with\r\npersonal references to the peerages won in them, and he spoke at times\r\ntoo bitterly of the diplomatic profession and especially of our\r\nambassador at Constantinople. Nothing shows so clearly the danger of the\r\nimperfect education which was forced on Bright by necessity, and which\r\nhe had done so much to remedy, as his attitude to foreign and imperial\r\npolitics. In his home he had too readily imbibed the crude notion that\r\nour Empire existed to provide careers for the needy cadets of\r\naristocratic families, and that our foreign policy was inspired by\r\nself-seeking officials who cared little for moral principles or for the\r\nlives of their fellow countrymen. A few months spent with Lord Canning\r\nat Calcutta, or with the Lawrences at Lahore, frequent intercourse with\r\nmen of the calibre of Lord Lyons or Lord Cromer, would have enlightened\r\nhim on the subject and prevented him from uttering the unwarranted\r\nimputations which he did. Yet in his great parliamentary speeches of\r\n1854 he rose high above all pettiness and made a deep impression on a\r\nhostile house. Damaging though his speech of December 22 was to the\r\nGovernment, no minister attempted to reply. Palmerston, Russell, and\r\nGladstone, with all their power, were unequal to the task. Disraeli told\r\nBright that a few more such speeches 'would break up the Government';\r\nand Delane, the famous editor of _The Times_, wrote that 'Cobden and\r\nBright would be our ministers but for their principle of peace at any\r\nprice'.\r\n\r\nBut Bright was not thinking of office or of breaking up Governments: he\r\nwas thinking of the practical end in view. His next great speech was on\r\nFebruary 23, 1855, when a faint hope of peace appeared. It was most\r\nconciliatory in tone, and was a solemn appeal to Palmerston to use his\r\ninfluence in ending the war. This was known as 'the Angel of Death'\r\nspeech, from a famous passage which occurs in it. At the end he was\r\n'overloaded with compliments', but the minister, who was hampered by\r\nRussian intrigues with Napoleon, seemed deaf to all appeals, and Bright\r\nagain returned to the attack. Till the last days of the war, he\r\ncontinued to raise his voice on behalf of peace; but his exertions had\r\ntold on his strength, and for the greater part of two years he had to\r\nabandon public life and devote himself to recovering his health.\r\n\r\nSix years later he was to prove that 'peace at any price' was no fair\r\ndescription of his attitude. The Southern States of America seceded on\r\nthe question of State rights and the institution of slavery, and the\r\nFederal Government declared war on them as rebels. This time it was not\r\na war for the balance of power, but one fought to vindicate a moral\r\nprinciple, and Bright was strongly in favour of fighting it to a\r\nfinish. For different reasons most of our countrymen favoured the South,\r\nbut he appealed for British sympathy for the other side, on the ground\r\nthat no true Briton could abet slavery. He was the most prominent\r\nsupporter of the North, for long the only prominent one, but he\r\ngradually made converts and did much to wipe away the reproach which\r\nattached to the name of Englishmen in America, when the North triumphed\r\nin the end. The war ended in 1865 with the surrender of General Lee at\r\nAppomattox, and Bright wrote in his journal, 'This great triumph of the\r\nRepublic is the event of our age'.\r\n\r\nBut long before 1865 the question of Reform and of the extension of the\r\nfranchise had been revived. Gladstone might speak in favour of the\r\nprinciple in 1864; Russell might introduce a Reform Bill in 1866; a year\r\nlater Disraeli might 'dish the Whigs'; and Whig and Tory might wrangle\r\nover the question who were the friends of the 'working man', but Bright\r\nhad made his position clear to his friends in 1846. He began a popular\r\nmovement in 1849 and for the next fifteen years of his life it was the\r\nobject dearest to his heart. He was not afraid to walk alone. When his\r\nold fellow worker, Cobden, refused his aid, on the ground that he was\r\nnot convinced of the need for extending the franchise, Bright himself\r\nassumed the lead and bore the brunt of the battle. Till 1865 his main\r\nobstacle was Palmerston, who since he took the helm in the worst days of\r\nthe Crimean War and conducted the ship of State into harbour, occupied\r\nan impregnable position. Palmerston was dear to 'the man in the street',\r\nshared his prejudices and understood his humours; and nothing could make\r\nhim into a serious Democrat or reformer. Even after Palmerston's death,\r\nBright's chief opponent was to be found in the Whig ranks, in Robert\r\nLowe, who was a master of parliamentary eloquence and who managed, in\r\n1866, to wreck Lord John Russell's Reform Bill in the House. But Bright\r\nhad his revenge in the country. Such meetings as ensued in the great\r\nprovincial towns had not been seen for twenty years: the middle class\r\nand the artisans were fused as in the great Repeal struggle of 1846. At\r\nGlasgow as many as 150,000 men paraded outside the town, and no hall\r\ncould contain the thousands who wished to hear the great Tribune. He\r\nclaimed that eighty-four per cent. of his countrymen were still excluded\r\nfrom the vote, and he bluntly asserted that the existing House of\r\nCommons did not represent 'the intelligence and the justice of the\r\nnation, but the prejudices, the privileges, and the selfishness, of a\r\nclass'.\r\n\r\nBut however blind many of this class might still be to the signs of the\r\ntimes, they found an astute leader in Disraeli, who had few principles\r\nand could trim his sails to any wind. The Tory Reform Bill, which he put\r\nforward in February 1867, came out a very different Bill in July, after\r\ndiscussion in the Cabinet, which led to the resignation of three\r\nministers, and after debates in the House of Commons, where it was\r\nroughly handled. The principle of household suffrage was conceded, and\r\nanother million voters were added to the electorate. Disraeli had made a\r\ngreater change of front than any which he could attribute to Peel, and\r\nthat without conviction, for reasons of party expediency. The real\r\ntriumph belonged to Bright. 'The Bill adopted', he writes, 'is the\r\nprecise franchise I recommended in 1858.' He had not only roused the\r\ncountry by his platform speeches, he had carefully watched the Bill in\r\nall its stages through the House, and gradually transformed it till it\r\nsatisfied the aspirations of the people. He had been content to work\r\nwith Disraeli so long as he could further the cause of Reform; and he\r\nonly quarrelled with that statesman finally when, in 1878, he revived\r\nthe anti-Russian policy of Palmerston.\r\n\r\nDuring this strenuous time his domestic life was happy and tranquil.\r\nAfter the death of his first wife he had remained a widower for six\r\nyears, and in 1847 he had married Margaret Leatham, who bore him seven\r\nchildren and shared his joys and sorrows in no ordinary measure for\r\nthirty years. Whenever politics took him away from his Rochdale home, he\r\nwrote constantly to her, and his letters throw most valuable light on\r\nhis inmost feelings. She died in 1878, and after this his life was\r\npitched in a different key. The outer world might suppose that high\r\npolitical office was crowning his career, but his enthusiasm and his\r\npower were ebbing and his physical health failed him more than once. He\r\nwas as affectionate to his children, as friendly to his neighbours, as\r\ntrue to his principles; but the old fire was gone.\r\n\r\nThe outward events of his life from 1867 to 1889 must be passed over\r\nlightly. Against his own wishes he was persuaded by Gladstone to join\r\nthe Cabinet in 1868 and again in 1880. His name was a tower of strength\r\nto the Government with the newly-enfranchised electors, but he himself\r\nhad little taste for the routine of office. At Birmingham, for which he\r\nhad sat since 1857, he compared himself to the Shunammite woman who\r\nrefused the offer of advancement at court, and replied to the prophet,\r\n'I dwell among mine own people'. But events were too strong for him: he\r\nwas drawn first to Westminster to share in the government of the\r\ncountry, and then to Osborne to visit the Queen. Both the Queen and he\r\nwere nervous at the prospect, but the interview passed off happily.[21]\r\nFamily affections and sorrows were a bond between them, and he talked to\r\nher with his usual frankness and simplicity. Even the difficult question\r\nof costume was settled by a compromise, and the usual gold-braided\r\nlivery was replaced by a sober suit of black. Ministerial work in\r\nLondon might have proved irksome to him; but his colleagues in the\r\nCabinet were indulgent, and no excessive demands were made upon his\r\nstrength. It was recognized that Bright was no longer in the fighting\r\nline. In 1870 he was incapacitated by a second long illness, and he had\r\nlittle share in the measures carried through Parliament for Irish land\r\npurchase and national education.\r\n\r\n[Note 21: See Fitzmaurice, _Life of Lord Granville_, vol. i, p.\r\n540.]\r\n\r\nHis official career was finally closed in 1882, when the bombardment of\r\nAlexandria seemed to open a new and aggressive chapter in our Eastern\r\npolicy. Bright was true to his old principles and resigned office.\r\n\r\nHe severed himself still more from the official Liberals in 1886, when\r\nhe refused to follow Gladstone into the Home Rule camp. He disliked the\r\nmethods of Parnell, the obstruction in Parliament, and the campaign of\r\nlawlessness in Ireland. His own victories had not been won so, and he\r\nhad a great respect for the traditions of the House. He also believed\r\nthat the Home Rule Bill would vitally weaken the unity of the realm. But\r\nno personal bitterness entered into his relations with his old\r\ncolleagues: he did not attack Gladstone, as he had attacked Palmerston\r\nin 1855. From his death-bed he sent a cordial message to his old chief,\r\nand received an answer full of high courtesy and affection.\r\n\r\nHis illness lasted several months. From the autumn of 1888 he lay at One\r\nAsh, weak but not suffering acutely; and on March 27, 1889, he quietly\r\npassed away. His old friend Cobden had preceded him more than twenty\r\nyears, having died in 1865, and had been buried at his birthplace in\r\nSussex, where he had made himself a peaceful home in later life. Bright\r\nproved himself equally faithful to the home of his earliest years. He\r\nwas laid to rest in the small burying-ground in front of the Friends'\r\nmeeting-house where he had worshipped as a child. In his long career he\r\nhad served noble causes, and scaled the heights of fame, and the crowds\r\nat his funeral testified to the love which his neighbours bore him. He\r\nhad never willingly been absent for long from his native town. His life,\r\ncompared with that of Disraeli or Gladstone, seems almost bleak in its\r\nsimplicity, varied as it was by so few excursions into other fields. But\r\ntwo strong passions enriched it with warmth and glow, his family\r\naffections and his zeal for the common good. These filled his heart, and\r\nhe was content that it should be so.\r\n\r\n    Type of the wise who soar but never roam,\r\n    True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Daniel Maclise in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\n1812-1870\r\n\r\n1812.

And indeed, all would admit that the creator of Sam Weller and\r\nSarah Gamp will live when the crusade against 'Bumbledom' and its\r\nabuses is forgotten and the need for such a crusade seems incredible.\r\nBut when so many recent critics have done justice to his gifts as a\r\ncreative artist, this aspect of his work runs no danger of being\r\nforgotten. Moreover, when we are considering Dickens as a Victorian\r\nworthy and as a representative man of his age, it is desirable to bring\r\nout those qualities which he shared with so many of his great\r\ncontemporaries. Above all, we must remember that Dickens himself would\r\nbe the last man to be ashamed of having written 'with a purpose', or to\r\nthink that the fact should be concealed as a blemish in his art. There\r\nwas nothing in which he felt more genuine pride than in the thought that\r\nhis talents thus employed had brought public opinion to realize the need\r\nfor many practical reforms in our social condition. If these old abuses\r\nhave mostly passed away, we may be thankful indeed; but we cannot feel\r\nsure that in the future fresh abuses will not arise with which the\r\nexample of Dickens may inspire others to wage war. His was a strenuous\r\nlife; he never spared himself nor stinted his efforts in any cause for\r\nwhich he was fighting; and if he did not win complete victory in his\r\nlifetime, he created the spirit in which victory was to be won.\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens was born in 1812, the second child of a large family,\r\nhis father being at the time a Navy clerk employed at Portsmouth. Of his\r\nbirthplace in Commercial Road Portsmouth is justifiably proud; but we\r\nmust think of him rather as a Kentishman and a Londoner, since he never\r\nlived in Hampshire after his fourth year. The earliest years which left\r\na distinct impress on his mind were those passed at Chatham, to which\r\nhis father moved in 1816. This town and its neighbouring cathedral city\r\nof Rochester, with their narrow old streets, their riverside and\r\ndockyard, took firm hold of his memory and imagination. To-day no places\r\nspeak more intimately of him to the readers of his books. Here he passed\r\nfive years of happy childhood till his father's work took the family to\r\nLondon and his father's improvidence plunged them into misfortune.\r\n\r\nFor those who know Wilkins Micawber it is needless to describe the\r\nfailings of Mr. Dickens; for others we may be content to say that he was\r\nkindhearted, sanguine and improvident, quite incapable of the steady\r\nindustry needed to support a growing family. When his debts overwhelmed\r\nhim and he was carried off to the Marshalsea prison, Charles was only\r\nten years old, but already he took the lead in the house. On him fell\r\nthe duty of pacifying creditors at the door, and of making visits to the\r\npawn-broker to meet the daily needs of the household. His initiation\r\ninto life was a hard one and it began cruelly soon. If he was active and\r\nenterprising beyond his years, with his nervous high-strung temperament\r\nhe was capable of suffering acutely; and this capacity was now to be\r\nsorely tried. For a year or more of his life this proud sensitive child\r\nhad to spend long hours in the cellars of a warehouse, with rough\r\nuneducated companions, occupied in pasting labels on pots of\r\nboot-blacking. This situation was all that the influence of his family\r\ncould procure for him; and into this he was thrust at the age of ten\r\nwith no ray of hope, no expectation of release. His shiftless parents\r\nseemed to acquiesce in this drudgery as an opening for their cleverest\r\nson; and instead of their helping and comforting him in his sorrow, it\r\nwas he who gave his Sundays to visiting them in prison and to offering\r\nthem such consolation as he could. The iron burnt deep into his soul.\r\nLong after, in fact till the day when the district was rebuilt and\r\nchanged out of knowledge, he owned that he could not bear to revisit the\r\nscene; so painful were his recollections, so vivid his sense of\r\ndegradation. Twenty-five years later he narrated the facts to his friend\r\nand biographer John Forster in a private conversation; and he only\r\nrecurred to the subject once more when under the disguise of a novel he\r\ntold the story of the childhood of David Copperfield. By shifting the\r\nhorror from the realm of fact to that of fiction, perhaps he lifted the\r\nweight of it from the secret recesses of his heart.\r\n\r\nWhen his father's debts were relieved, the child regained his freedom\r\nfrom servitude, but even then his schooling was desultory and\r\nineffective. Well might the elder Dickens, in a burst of candour, say to\r\na stranger who asked him about his son's education, 'Why indeed, sir,\r\nha! ha! he may be said to have educated himself.'\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen Charles embarked again on his career as a\r\nwage-earner. At first he was taken into a lawyer's office, where he\r\nfilled a position somewhat between that of office-boy and clerk, and two\r\nyears later he was qualifying himself by the study of shorthand for the\r\nprofession of a parliamentary reporter, which his father was then\r\nfollowing. He entered 'the Gallery' in 1831, first representing the\r\n_True Sun_ and later the well-known _Morning Chronicle_; and at\r\nintervals he enlarged his experiences by journeys into the provinces to\r\nreport political meetings. Thus it was that he familiarized himself with\r\nthe mail coaches, the wayside hostelries, and the rich variety of types\r\nthat were to be found there; with London in most of its phases he was\r\nalready at home. So, when in 1834 he made his first attempts at writing\r\nin periodical literature, although he was only twenty-two years old, he\r\nhad a wealth of first-hand experiences quite outside the range of the\r\nman who is just finishing his leisurely passage through a public school\r\nand university: of schools and offices, of parliaments and prisons, of\r\nthe street and of the high road, he had been a diligent and observant\r\ncritic; for many years he had practised the maxim of Pope: 'The proper\r\nstudy of mankind is Man.'\r\n\r\nFriends sprang up wherever he went. His open face, his sparkling eye,\r\nhis humorous tongue, his ready sympathy, were a passport to the\r\ngoodwill of those whom he met; few could resist the appeal. Many readers\r\nwill be familiar with the early portrait by Maclise; but his friends\r\ntell us how little that did justice to the lively play of feature, 'the\r\nspirited air and carriage' which were indescribable. On the top of a\r\nmail coach, on a fresh morning, they must have won the favour of his\r\nfellow travellers more easily than Alfred Jingle won the hearts of the\r\nPickwickians. And beneath the radiant cheerfulness of his manner, the\r\nquick flash of observation and of speech, there was in him an element of\r\nhard persistence and determination which would carry him far. If the\r\nyears of poverty and neglect had failed to chill his hopes and break his\r\nspirit, there was no fear that he would tire in the pursuit of his\r\nambition when fortune began to smile upon him. He had touched life on\r\nmany sides. He had kept his warmth of sympathy, his buoyancy, his\r\ncapacity for rising superior to ill-fortune; and the years of adversity\r\nhad only deepened his feeling for all that were oppressed. He had much\r\nto learn about the craft of letters; but he already had the first\r\nessential of an author--he had something to say.\r\n\r\nThe year 1836 is a definite landmark in the life of Dickens. In this\r\nyear he married; in this year he gave up the practice of parliamentary\r\nreporting, published the _Sketches by Boz_, and began the writing of\r\n_The Pickwick Papers_. This immortal work achieved wide popularity at\r\nonce. Criticism cannot hope to do justice to the greatness of Sam\r\nWeller, to the humours of Dingley Dell and Eatanswill, to the adventures\r\nof the hero in back gardens or in prison, on coaches or in wheelbarrows.\r\nEvery one must read them in the original for himself. In this book\r\nDickens reached at once the height of his success in making his fellow\r\ncountrymen laugh with him at their own foibles. If in the art of\r\nconstructing a story, in the depiction of character, in deepening the\r\ninterest by the alternation of happiness and misfortune, he was to go\r\nfar beyond his initial triumph,--still with many Dickensians, who love\r\nhim chiefly for his liveliness of observation and broad humour, Pickwick\r\nremains the prime favourite.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this success on the fortunes of the author was immediate\r\nand lasting. Henceforth he could live in a comfortable house and look\r\nforward to a family life in which his children should be free from all\r\nrisk of repeating his own experience. He could afford himself the\r\npleasures and the society which he needed, and he became the centre of a\r\ncircle of friends who appreciated his talents and encouraged him in his\r\ncareer. His relations with his publishers, though not without incident,\r\nwere generally of the most cordial kind. If Dickens had the\r\nself-confidence to estimate his own powers highly, and the shrewd\r\ninstinct to know when he was getting less than his fair share in a\r\nbargain, yet in a difference of opinion he was capable of seeing the\r\nother side, and he was loyal in the observance of all agreements.\r\n\r\nThe five years which followed were so crowded with various activities\r\nthat it is difficult to date the events exactly, especially when he was\r\nproducing novels in monthly or weekly numbers. Generally he had more\r\nthan one story on the stocks. Thus in 1837, before _Pickwick_ was\r\nfinished, _Oliver Twist_ was begun, and it was not itself complete\r\nbefore the earlier numbers of _Nicholas Nickleby_ were appearing. In the\r\nsame way _The Old Curiosity Shop_ and _Barnaby Rudge_, which may be\r\ndated 1840 and 1841, overlapped one another in the planning of the\r\nstories, if not in the execution of the weekly parts. There is no period\r\nof Dickens's life which enables us better to observe his intense mental\r\nactivity, and at the same time the variety of his creations. Here we\r\nhave the luxuriant humour of Mrs. Nickleby and the Crummles family side\r\nby side with the tragedy of Bill Sikes and the pathos of Little Nell.\r\nHere also we can see the gradual development of constructive power in\r\nthe handling of the story. But for our purpose it is more significant to\r\nnotice that we here find Dickens's pen enlisted in the service of the\r\nnoblest cause for which he fought, the redemption from misery and\r\nslavery of the children of his native land. Lord Shaftesbury's life has\r\ntold us what their sufferings were and how the machinery of Government\r\nwas slowly forced to do its part; and Dickens would be the last to\r\ndetract from the fame of that great philanthropist, whose efforts on\r\nmany occasions he supported and praised. But there were wide circles\r\nwhich no philanthropist could reach, hearts which no arguments or\r\nstatistics could rouse; men and women who attended no meetings and read\r\nno pamphlets but who eagerly devoured anything that was written by the\r\nauthor of _The Pickwick Papers_. To them Smike and Little Nell made a\r\npersonal and irresistible appeal; they could not remain insensible to\r\nthe cruelty of Dotheboys Hall and to the depravity of Fagin's school;\r\nand if these books did not themselves recruit active workers to improve\r\nthe conditions of child life, at least society became permeated with a\r\ntemper which was favourable to the efforts of the reformers.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the days of his childhood at Rochester Dickens had been\r\nindignant at what he had casually heard of the Yorkshire schools; and\r\nhis year of drudgery in London had made him realize, in other cases\r\nbeside his own, the degradation that followed from the neglect of\r\nchildren. On undertaking to handle this subject in _Nicholas Nickleby_,\r\nhe journeyed to Yorkshire to gather evidence at first hand for his\r\npicture of Dotheboys Hall. And for many years afterwards he continued to\r\ncorrespond with active workers on the subject of Ragged Schools and on\r\nthe means of uplifting children out of the conditions which were so\r\nfruitful a source of crime. He discovered for himself how easily\r\nmiscreants like Fagin could find recruits in the slums of London, and\r\nhow impossible it was to bring up aright boys who were bred in these\r\nneglected homes. Even where efforts had been begun, the machinery was\r\nquite inadequate, the teachers few, the schoolrooms cheerless and\r\nill-equipped. Mr. Crotch[22] has preserved a letter of 1843 in which\r\nDickens makes the practical offer of providing funds for a washing-place\r\nin one school where the children seemed to be suffering from inattention\r\nto the elementary needs. His heart warmed towards individual cases and\r\nhe faced them in practical fashion; he was not one of those reformers\r\nwho utter benevolent sentiments on the platform and go no further.\r\n\r\n[Note 22: _Charles Dickens, Social Reformer_, by W. W. Crotch\r\n(Chapman & Hall, 1913), p. 53.]\r\n\r\nCritics have had much to say about Dickens's treatment of child\r\ncharacters in his novels; the words 'sentimental' and 'mawkish' have\r\nbeen hurled at scenes like the death of Paul Dombey and Little Nell and\r\nat the more lurid episodes in _Oliver Twist_. But Dickens was a pioneer\r\nin his treatment of children in fiction; and if he did smite resounding\r\nblows which jar upon critical ears, at least he opened a rich vein of\r\nliterature where many have followed him. He wrote not for the critics\r\nbut for the great popular audience whom he had created, comprising all\r\nages and classes, and world-wide in extent. The best answer to such\r\ncriticism is to be found in the poem which Bret Harte dedicated to his\r\nmemory in 1870, which beautifully describes how the pathos of his\r\nchild-heroine could move the hearts of rough working men far away in the\r\nSierras of the West. Nor did this same character of Little Nell fail to\r\nwin special praise from literary critics so fastidious as Landor and\r\nFrancis Jeffrey.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 he embarked on his first voyage to America. Till then he had\r\ntravelled little outside his native land, and this expedition was\r\ndefinitely intended to bear fruit. Before starting he made a bargain\r\nwith his publishers to produce a book on his return. The _American\r\nNotes_ thus published, dealing largely with institutions and with the\r\nnotable 'sights' of the country, have not retained a prominent place\r\namong his works; with _Martin Chuzzlewit_ and its picture of American\r\nmanners it is different. This stands alone among his writings in having\r\nleft a permanent heritage of ill-will. Reasons in abundance can be found\r\nfor the bitterness caused. He portrayed the conceit, the self-interest,\r\nthe disregard for the feelings of others which the less-educated\r\nAmerican showed to foreigners in a visible and often offensive guise;\r\nand the portraits were so life-like that no arrow fails to hit the mark.\r\nThe American people were young; they had made great strides in material\r\nprosperity, they had not been taught to submit to the lash by satirists\r\nlike Swift or more kindly mentors like Addison. Their own Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes had not yet begun to chastise them with gentle irony. So they\r\nwere aghast at Dickens's audacity, and indignant at what seemed an\r\noutrage on their hospitality, and few stopped to ask what elements of\r\ntruth were to be found in the offending book. No doubt it was one-sided\r\nand unfair; Dickens, like most tourists, had been confronted by the\r\nlouder and more aggressive members of the community and had not time to\r\njudge the whole. In large measure he recanted in subsequent writings;\r\nand on his second visit the more generous Americans showed how little\r\nrancour they bore. But the portraits of Jefferson Brick and Elijah\r\nPogram will live; with Pecksniff, 'Sairey' Gamp, and other immortals\r\nthey bear the hall-mark of Dickens's creative genius.\r\n\r\nTo America he did not go again for twenty-five years; but, as he grew\r\nolder, he seemed to feel increasing need for change and variety in his\r\nmode of life. In 1844 he went for nearly twelve months to Italy, making\r\nhis head-quarters at Genoa; and in 1846 he repeated the experiment at\r\nLausanne on the lake of Geneva. Later, between 1853 and 1856, he spent a\r\nlarge part of three summers in a villa near Boulogne. Though he desired\r\nthe change for reasons connected with his work, and though in each case\r\nhe formed friendly connexions with his neighbours, it cannot be said\r\nthat his books show the influence of either country. His genius was\r\nBritish to the core and he remained an Englishman wherever he went. He\r\ncomplained when abroad that he missed the stimulus of London, where the\r\nlighted streets, through which he walked at night, caused his\r\nimagination to work with intensified force. But even in Genoa he proved\r\ncapable of writing _The Chimes_, which is as markedly English in temper\r\nas anything which he wrote.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of restlessness comes out in his ventures into other\r\nfields of activity at home. At one time he assumed the editorship of a\r\nLondon newspaper; but a few weeks showed that he was incapable of\r\neditorial drudgery and he resigned. His taste for acting played a larger\r\npart in his life; and in 1851 and other years he put an enormous amount\r\nof energy into organizing public theatrical performances with his\r\nfriends in London. He always loved the theatre. Macready was one of his\r\ninnermost circle, and he had other friends on the stage. Indeed there\r\nwere moments in his life when it seemed that the genius of the novelist\r\nmight be lost to the world, which would have found but a sorry\r\nequivalent in one more actor of talent on the stage, however brilliant\r\nthat talent was. But the main current of his life went on in London with\r\ndiligent application to the book or books in hand; or at Broadstairs,\r\nwhere Dickens made holiday in true English fashion with his children by\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nIn the years following the American voyage the chief landmarks were the\r\nproduction of _Dombey and Son_ (begun in 1846) and _David Copperfield_\r\n(begun in 1849). From many points of view they may be regarded as his\r\nmasterpieces, where his art is best seen in depicting character and\r\nconstructing a story, though the infectious gaiety of the earlier novels\r\nmay at times be missed. Dickens's insight into human nature had ripened,\r\nand he had learnt to group his lesser figures and episodes more\r\nskilfully round the central plot. And _David Copperfield_ has the\r\npeculiar interest which attaches to those works where we seem to read\r\nthe story of the author's own life. Evidently we have memories here of\r\nhis childhood, of his school-days and his apprenticeship to work, and of\r\nthe first gleams of success which met him in life. It is generally\r\nassumed that the book throws light on his own family relations; but it\r\nwould be rash to argue confidently about this, as the inventive impulse\r\nwas so strong in him. At least we may say that it is the book most\r\nnecessary for a student who wishes to understand Dickens himself and his\r\noutlook on the world.\r\n\r\nAlso _David Copperfield_ may be regarded as the central point and the\r\nculmination of Dickens's career as a novelist. Before it, and again\r\nafter it, he had a spell of about fifteen years' steady work at novel\r\nwriting, and no one would question that the first spell was productive\r\nof the better work. _Bleak House_, _Hard Times_, _Little Dorrit_, _Our\r\nMutual Friend_ all show evidence of greater effort and are less happy in\r\ntheir effect. No man could live the life that Dickens had lived for\r\nfifteen years and not show some signs of exhaustion; the wonder is that\r\nhis creative power continued at all. He was capable of brilliant\r\nsuccesses yet. _The Tale of Two Cities_ is among the most thrilling of\r\nhis stories, while _Edwin Drood_ and parts of _Great Expectations_ show\r\nas fine imagination and character drawing as anything which he wrote\r\nbefore 1850; but there is no injustice in drawing a broad distinction\r\nbetween the two parts of his career.\r\n\r\nHis home during the most fertile period of his activity was in\r\nDevonshire Terrace, near Regent's Park, a house with a garden of\r\nconsiderable size. Here he was within reach of his best friends, who\r\nwere drawn from all the liberal professions represented in London. First\r\namong them stands John Forster, lawyer, journalist, and author, his\r\nadviser and subsequently his biographer, the friend of Robert Browning,\r\na man with a genius for friendship, unselfish, loyal, discreet and wise\r\nin counsel. Next came the artists Maclise and Clarkson Stanfield, the\r\nactor Macready, Talfourd, lawyer and poet, Douglas Jerrold and Mark\r\nLemon, the two famous contributors to _Punch_, and some fellow\r\nnovelists, of whom Harrison Ainsworth was conspicuous in the earlier\r\ngroup and Wilkie Collins in later years. Less frequent visitors were\r\nCarlyle, Thackeray, and Bulwer Lytton, but they too were proud to\r\nwelcome Dickens among their friends. With some of these he would walk,\r\nride, or dine, go to the theatre or travel in the provinces and in\r\nforeign countries. His biographer loves to recall the Dickens Dinners,\r\norganized to celebrate the issue of a new book, when songs and speeches\r\nwere added to good cheer and when 'we all in the greatest good-humour\r\nglorified each other'. Dickens always retained the English taste for a\r\ngood dinner and was frankly fond of applause, and there was no element\r\nof exclusive priggishness about the cordial admiration which these\r\nfriends felt for one another and their peculiar enthusiasm for Dickens\r\nand his books. Around him the enthusiasm gathered, and few men have\r\nbetter deserved it.\r\n\r\nWhen he was writing he needed quiet and worked with complete\r\nconcentration; and when he had earned some leisure he loved to spend it\r\nin violent physical exercise. He would suddenly call on Forster to come\r\nout for a long ride on horseback to occupy the middle of the day; and\r\nhis diligent friend, unable to resist the lure of such company, would\r\nthrow his own work to the winds and come. Till near the end of his life\r\nDickens clung to these habits, thinking nothing of a walk of from twenty\r\nto thirty miles; and there seems reason to believe that by constant\r\nover-exertion he sapped his strength and shortened his life. But\r\nlameness in one foot, the result of an illness early in 1865,\r\nhandicapped him severely at times; and in the same year he sustained a\r\nrude shock in a railway accident where his nerves were upset by what he\r\nwitnessed in helping the injured. He ought to have acquired the wisdom\r\nof the middle-aged man, and to have taken things more easily, but with\r\nhim it was impossible to be doing nothing; physical and mental activity\r\nsucceeded one another and often went together with a high state of\r\nnervous tension.\r\n\r\nThis love of excitement sometimes took forms which modern taste would\r\ncall excessive and unwholesome. His attendance at the public execution\r\nof the Mannings in 1849, his going so often to the Morgue in Paris, his\r\nvisit to America to 'the exact site where Professor Webster did that\r\namazing murder', may seem legitimate for one who had to study crime\r\namong the other departments of life; but at times he revels in gruesome\r\ndetails in a way which jars on our feeling, and betrays too theatrical a\r\nlove of sensation. However, no one could say that Dickens is generally\r\nmorbid, in view of the sound and hearty appreciation which he had for\r\nall that is wholesome and genial in life.\r\n\r\nIn many ways the latter part of his life shows a less even tenor, a less\r\nsteady development. Though he was so domestic in his tastes and devoted\r\nto his children, his relations with his wife became more and more\r\ndifficult owing to incompatibility of temperament; and from 1858 they\r\nfound it desirable to live apart. This no doubt added to his\r\nrestlessness and the craving for excitement, which showed itself in the\r\nardour with which he took up the idea of public readings. These readings\r\nare only less famous than his writings, so prodigious was their success.\r\nHis great dramatic gifts, enlisted in the service of his own creations,\r\nmade an irresistible appeal to the public, and till the day of his\r\ncollapse, ten years later, their popularity showed no sign of waning.\r\nThe amount of money which he earned thereby was amazing; the American\r\ntour alone gave him a net profit of £20,000; and he expected to make as\r\nmuch more in two seasons in England. But he paid dearly for these\r\ntriumphs, being often in trouble with his voice, suffering from fits of\r\nsleeplessness, aggravating the pain in his foot, and affecting his\r\nheart. In spite, then, of the success of the readings, his faithful\r\nfriends like Forster would gladly have seen him abandon a practice which\r\ncould add little to his future fame, while it threatened to shorten his\r\nlife. But, however arduous the task which he set himself, when the\r\nmoment came Dickens could brace himself to meet the demands and satisfy\r\nthe high expectations of his audience. His nerves seemed to harden, his\r\nvoice to gain strength; his spirit flashed out undimmed, and he won\r\ntriumph after triumph, in quiet cathedral cities, in great industrial\r\ntowns, in the more fatiguing climate of America and before the huge\r\naudiences of Philadelphia and New York. He began his programme with a\r\nfew chosen pieces from _Pickwick_ and the Christmas Books, and with\r\nselected characters like Paul Dombey and Mrs. Gamp; he added Dotheboys\r\nHall and the story of David Copperfield in brief; in his last series,\r\nagainst the advice of Forster, he worked up the more sensational\r\npassages from _Oliver Twist_. His object, he says, was 'to leave behind\r\nme the recollection of something very passionate and dramatic, done with\r\nsimple means, if the act would justify the theme'. It was because the\r\nart of reading was unduly strained that Forster protested, and his\r\njudgement is confirmed by Dickens's boast (perhaps humorously\r\nexaggerated) that 'at Clifton we had a contagion of fainting, and yet\r\nthe place was not hot--a dozen to twenty ladies taken out stiff and\r\nrigid at various times'. The physical effects of this fresh strain soon\r\nappeared. After a month his doctor ordered him to cease reading; and,\r\nthough he resumed it after a few days' rest, in April 1869 he had a\r\nworse attack of giddiness and was obliged to abandon it permanently. The\r\nhistory of these readings illustrates the character of Dickens perhaps\r\nbetter than any other episode in his later life.\r\n\r\nBut the same restless energy is visible even in his life at Gadshill,\r\nwhich was his home from 1860 to 1870. The house lies on the London road\r\na few miles west of Rochester, and can easily be seen to-day, almost\r\nunaltered, by the passer-by. It had caught his fancy in his childhood\r\nbefore the age of ten when he was walking with his father, and his\r\nfather had promised that, if he would only work hard enough, he might\r\none day live in it. The associations of the place with the Falstaff\r\nscenes in _Henry IV_ had also endeared it to him; and so, when in 1855\r\nhe heard that it was for sale, he jumped at the opportunity. For some\r\nyears after purchasing it he let it to tenants, but from 1860 he made it\r\nhis permanent abode. It has no architectural features to charm the eye;\r\nwith its many changes and additions made for comfort, its bow-windows\r\nand the plantations in the garden, it is a typical Victorian home. Here\r\nDickens could live at ease, surrounded by his children, his dogs, his\r\nbooks, his souvenirs of his friends, and the Kentish scenery which he\r\nloved. To the north lay the flat marshlands of the lower Thames, to the\r\nsouth and west lay rolling hills crowned with woodlands, with hop\r\ngardens on the lower slopes; to the east lay the valley of the Medway\r\nwith the quaint old streets of Rochester and the bustling dockyard of\r\nChatham. All that makes the familiar beauty and richness of English\r\nlandscape was here, above all the charm of associations. So many names\r\npreserved memories of his books. To Rochester the Pickwickians had\r\ndriven on their first search for knowledge; to Cobham Mr. Winkle had\r\nfled, and at the 'Leather Bottle' his friends had found him; in the\r\nmarshlands Joe Gargery and Pip had watched for the escaped convict; in\r\nthe old gateway by the cathedral Jasper had entertained Edwin Drood on\r\nthe eve of his disappearance; along that very high-road over which\r\nDickens's windows looked the child David Copperfield had tramped in his\r\njourney from London to Dover.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though his creative vein may have been less fertile than of\r\nold, his efforts for the good of his fellow men were no less continuous\r\nand sincere. His first books had aimed at killing by ridicule certain\r\nsocial institutions which had sunk into abuses. The pictures of\r\nparliamentary elections, of schools, of workhouses, had not only created\r\na hearty laugh, but they had disposed the public to listen to the\r\nreformers and to realize the need for reform. As he grew older he went\r\ndeeper into the evil, and he also blended his reforming purpose better\r\nwith his story. The characters of Mr. Dombey and the Chuzzlewits are not\r\nmere incidents in the tale, nor are they monstrosities which call forth\r\nimmediate astonishment and horror. But in each case the ingrained\r\nselfishness which spreads misery through a family is the very mainspring\r\nof the story; and the dramatic power by which Dickens makes it reveal\r\nitself in action has something Shakespearian in it. Here there is still\r\na balance between the different elements, the human interest and the\r\nmoral lesson, and as works of art they are on a higher plane than _Hard\r\nTimes_, where the purpose is too clearly shown. Still if we wish to\r\nunderstand this side of Dickens's work, it is just such a book as _Hard\r\nTimes_ that we must study.\r\n\r\nIt deals with the relation of classes to one another in an industrial\r\ndistrict, and especially with the faults of the class that rose to power\r\nwith the development of manufacturing. Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby,\r\nthe well-meaning pedant and the offensive parvenu, preach the same\r\ngospel. Political economy, as they understand it, is to rule life, and\r\nthis dismal science is not concerned with human well-being and\r\nhappiness, but only with the profit and loss on commercial undertakings.\r\nHard facts then are to be the staple of education; memory and accurate\r\ncalculation are to be cultivated; the imagination is to be driven out.\r\nIn depicting the manner of this education Dickens rather overshoots the\r\nmark. The visit of Mr. Gradgrind to Mr. M'Choakumchild's school (when\r\nthe sharp-witted Bitzer defines the horse according to the scientific\r\nhandbook, while poor Cissy, who has only an affection for horses,\r\nindulges in fancies and collapses in disgrace) is too evident a\r\ncaricature. But the effects of this kind of teaching are painted with a\r\npowerful hand, and we see the faculty for joy blighted almost in the\r\ncradle. And the lesson is enforced not only by the working man and his\r\nfamily but by Gradgrind's own daughter, who pitilessly convicts her\r\nfather of having stifled every generous impulse in her and of having\r\nsacrificed her on the altar of fancied self-interest.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the dismal Mr. Gradgrind is the poor master of the\r\nstrolling circus, Mr. Sleary, with his truer philosophy of life. He can\r\nsee the real need that men have for amusement and for brightness in\r\ntheir lives; and, though he lives under the shadow of bankruptcy, he can\r\nhold his head up and preach the gospel of happiness. This was a cause\r\nwhich never failed to win the enthusiastic advocacy of Dickens. He\r\nfought, as men still have to fight to-day, against those Pharisees who\r\nprescribe for the working classes how they should spend their weekly day\r\nof freedom; he supported the opening on Sunday of parks, museums, and\r\ngalleries; whole-heartedly he loved the theatre and the circus, and he\r\nwished as many as possible to share those delights. In defiance of 'Mrs.\r\nGrundy' he ventured to maintain that the words 'music-hall' and\r\n'public-house', rightly understood, should be held in honour. It is one\r\nthing to hate drunkenness and indecency; it is quite another to assume\r\nthat these must be found in the poor man's place of recreation, and this\r\nroused him to anger. To him 'public-house' meant a place of fellowship,\r\nand 'music-hall' a place of song and mirth; and if some critics complain\r\nof an excess of material good-cheer in his picture of life, Dickens is\r\ncertainly here in sympathy with the bulk of his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nAnother cause in which Dickens was always ready to lead a crusade was\r\nthe amendment of the Poor Law. This will remind us of the early days of\r\nOliver Twist, of such a friendless outcast as Jo in _Bleak House_, of\r\nthe struggle of Betty Higden in _Our Mutual Friend_ and her\r\ndetermination never to be given up to 'the Parish'. But, even more than\r\nthe famous novels, the casual writings of Dickens in his own magazines\r\nand elsewhere throw light on his activities in this cause and on the\r\nresearches which he made into the working of the system. Mr. Crotch\r\ndescribes visits which he paid to the workhouses in Wapping and\r\nWhitechapel, quoting his comments on the 'Foul Ward' in one, on the old\r\nmen's ward in the other, and on the torpor of despair which settled down\r\non these poor wrecks of humanity. Could such a system, he asked himself,\r\nbe wise which robbed men not of liberty alone but of all hope for the\r\nfuture, which left them no single point of interest except the\r\nstatistics of their fellows who had gone before them and who had been\r\nfinally liberated by death? A still more striking passage, just because\r\nDickens here shows unusual restraint and moderation in his language,\r\ntells us of the five women whom he saw sleeping all night outside the\r\nworkhouse through no fault of any official, but simply because there was\r\nno room for them inside and because society had nothing to offer, no\r\nform of 'relief' which could touch these unfortunates. Many will be\r\nfamiliar with passages in Ruskin, where he denounces similar tragedies\r\ndue to our inhuman disregard of what is happening at our doors.\r\n\r\nThough the most valuable part of his work was the effective appeal to\r\nthe hearts of his brother men, Dickens had the practical wisdom to\r\nsuggest definite remedies in some cases. He saw that the districts in\r\nthe East End of London, even with a heavy poor rate, failed to supply\r\nadequate relief for their waifs and strays, while the wealthy\r\ninhabitants of the West End, having few paupers, paid on their riches a\r\nrate that was negligible, and he boldly suggested the equalization of\r\nrates. All London should jointly share the burden of maintaining those\r\nfor whose welfare they were responsible and should pay shares\r\nproportioned to their wealth. This wise reform was not carried into\r\neffect till some thirty or forty years later; but the principle is now\r\ngenerally accepted. Though in this case, as in his famous attack on the\r\nCourt of Chancery in _Bleak House_, Dickens failed in obtaining any\r\nimmediate effect, it is unquestionable that he influenced the minds of\r\nthousands and changed the temper in which they looked at the problem of\r\nthe poor. In this nothing that he wrote was more powerful than the\r\nseries of Christmas Books, in which his imagination, with the power of a\r\nRembrandt, threw on to a smaller canvas the lights and shades of London\r\nlife, the grim background of mean streets, and the cheerful virtues\r\nwhich throw a glamour over their humble homes. His advocacy of these\r\nsocial causes came to be known far and wide and contributed a second\r\nelement to the popularity won by his novels; long before his death\r\nDickens stood on a pinnacle alone, loved by the vast reading public\r\namong those who toil in our towns and villages, and wherever English is\r\nread and understood. He was not only their entertainer, but their friend\r\nand brother; he had been through his days of sorrow and suffering and he\r\nhad kept that vast fund of cheerfulness which overflowed into his books\r\nand gladdened the lives of so many thousands. When he died in 1870 after\r\na year of intermittent illness, following on his breakdown over the\r\npublic readings, there was naturally a widespread desire that he should\r\nbe buried in Westminster Abbey, as a great Englishman and a true\r\nrepresentative of his age. During life he had expressed his desire for a\r\nprivate funeral, unheralded in the press, and he had thought of two or\r\nthree quiet churches in the neighbourhood of Rochester and Gadshill.\r\nThese particular graveyards were found to be already closed, and the\r\nfamily consented to a compromise by which their father should be buried\r\nin the Abbey at an early hour when no strangers would be aware of it.\r\nAfter his body was laid to rest, the people were admitted to pay their\r\nhomage; the universality and the sincerity of their feelings was shown\r\nin a wonderful way. Among men of letters he had reigned in the hearts of\r\nthe people, as Queen Victoria reigned among our sovereigns. In the\r\nannals of her reign his name will outlive those of soldiers, of\r\nprelates, and of politicians.\r\n\r\nThe causes for which he fought have not all been won yet. Officialdom\r\nstill dawdles over the work of the State, hearts are still broken by the\r\nlaw's delays, the path of crime still lies too easily open to the young.\r\nVast progress has been made; a humane spirit is to be found in the\r\nworking of our Government, and a truer knowledge of social problems is\r\nspreading among all classes. But the world cannot afford to relegate\r\nCharles Dickens to oblivion, and shows no desire to do so; his books are\r\nand will be a wellspring of cheerfulness, of faith in human nature, and\r\nof true Christian charity from which all will do well to drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED TENNYSON\r\n\r\n1809-92\r\n\r\n1809.

They battled\r\nagainst Nature's forces, subduing floods and mountain barriers,\r\npestilence and the worst extremes of heat and cold; they also went forth\r\ninto the market-place and battled with their fellow men for laws, for\r\ntariffs, for empire. Their triumphs, like those of the Romans, are\r\nmostly to be seen in the practical sphere. But there were others of that\r\nday who chose the contemplative life of the recluse, and who yet, by\r\nhigh imaginings, contributed in no less degree to enrich the fame of\r\ntheir age; and among these the first name is that of Alfred Tennyson,\r\nthe most representative of Victorian poets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by G. F. Watts in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nHis early environment may be said to have marked him out for such a\r\nlife. He was born in one of the remotest districts of a rural county.\r\nThe village of Somersby lies in a hollow among the Lincolnshire wolds,\r\ntwenty miles east of Lincoln, midway between the small towns of Spilsby,\r\nHorncastle, and Louth. There are no railways to disturb its peace; no\r\nhigh roads or broad rivers to bring trade to its doors. The 'cold\r\nrivulet' that rises just above the village flows down some twenty miles\r\nto lose itself in the sea near Skegness; in the valley the alders sigh\r\nand the aspens quiver, while around are rolling hills covered by long\r\nfields of corn broken by occasional spinneys. It is not a country to\r\ndraw tourists for its own sake; but Tennyson knew, as few other poets\r\nknow, the charm that human association lends to the simplest English\r\nlandscape, and he cherished the memory of these scenes long after he had\r\ngone to live among the richer beauties of the south. From the garners of\r\nmemory he drew the familiar features of this homely land showing that he\r\nhad forgotten\r\n\r\n    No grey old grange, or lonely fold,\r\n        Or low morass and whispering reed,\r\n        Or simple stile from mead to mead,\r\n    Or sheepwalk up the winding wold.[23]\r\n\r\n[Note 23: _In Memoriam_, c.]\r\n\r\nThere are days when the wolds seem dreary and monotonous; but if change\r\nis wanted, a long walk or an easy drive will take us from Somersby, as\r\nit often took the Tennyson brothers, to the coast at Mablethorpe, where\r\nthe long rollers of the North Sea beat upon the sandhills that guard\r\nthe flat stretches of the marshland. Here the poet as a child used to\r\nlie upon the beach, his imagination conjuring up Homeric pictures of the\r\nGrecian fleet besieging Troy; and if, on his last visit before leaving\r\nLincolnshire, he found the spell broken, he could still describe vividly\r\nwhat he saw with the less fanciful vision of manhood.\r\n\r\n    Grey sandbanks, and pale sunsets, dreary wind,\r\n      Dim shores, dense rains, and heavy-clouded sea![24]\r\n\r\n[Note 24: Lines written in 1837 and published in the _Manchester\r\nAthenæum Album_, 1850.]\r\n\r\nThese wide expanses of sea, sand, and sky figure many times in his\r\npoetry and furnish a background for the more tragic scenes in the\r\n_Idylls of the King_.\r\n\r\nNor does the vicarage spoil the harmony of the scene, an old-fashioned\r\nlow rambling house, to which a loftier hall adjoining, with its Gothic\r\nwindows, lends a touch of distinction. The garden with one towering\r\nsycamore and the wych-elms, that threw long shadows on the lawn, opened\r\non to the parson's field, where on summer mornings could be heard the\r\nsweep of the scythe in the dewy grass. Here Tennyson's father had been\r\nrector for some years when his fourth child Alfred was born in August\r\n1809, the year which also saw the birth of Darwin and Gladstone. The\r\nfamily was a large one; there were eight sons and four daughters, the\r\nlast of whom was still alive in 1916. Alfred's education was as\r\nirregular as a poet's could need to be, consisting of a few years'\r\nattendance at Louth Grammar School, where he suffered from the rod and\r\nother abuses of the past, and of a larger number spent in studying\r\nliterature at home under his father's guidance. These left him a liberal\r\namount of leisure which he devoted to reading at large and roaming the\r\ncountry-side. His father was a man of mental cultivation far beyond the\r\naverage, well fitted to expand the mind of a boy of literary tastes and\r\nto lead him on at a pace suited to his abilities. He had suffered from\r\ndisappointments which had thrown a shadow over his life, having been\r\ndisinherited capriciously by his father, who was a wealthy man and a\r\nmember of Parliament. The inheritance passed to the second brother, who\r\ntook the name of Tennyson d'Eyncourt; and though the Rector resented the\r\ninjustice of the act, he did not allow it to embitter the relations\r\nbetween his own children and their cousins. His character was of the\r\nstern, dominating order, and both his parishioners and his children\r\nstood in awe of him; but the gentle nature of their mother made amends.\r\nShe is described by Edward FitzGerald, the poet's friend, as 'one of the\r\nmost innocent and tender-hearted ladies I ever met, devoted to husband\r\nand children'. In her youth she had been a noted beauty, and in her old\r\nage was not too unworldly to remember that she had received twenty-five\r\nproposals of marriage. It was from her that the family derived their\r\nbeauty of feature, while in their strength of intellect they resembled\r\nrather their father. One of Alfred's earliest literary passions was a\r\nlove of Byron, and he remembered in after life how as a child he had\r\ncarved on a rock the woful tidings that his hero was dead. In this\r\nperiod he was already writing poetry himself, though he did not publish\r\nhis first volume till after he had gone up to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFrom this home life, filled with leisurely reading, rambling, and\r\ndreaming, he was sent in 1828 to join his brother Frederick at Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, and he came into residence in February of that year.\r\nCambridge has been called the poets' University. Here in early days came\r\nSpenser and Milton, Dryden and Gray; and--in the generation preceding\r\nTennyson--Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Byron had followed in their steps.\r\nHowever little we can trace directly the development of the poetic gift\r\nto local influence, at least we can say that Tennyson gained greatly by\r\nthe time he spent within its walls. He came up an unknown man without\r\nfamily connexions to help him, and without the hall-mark of any famous\r\nschool upon him. Shy and retiring by nature as he was, he might easily\r\nhave failed to win his way to notice. But there was something in his\r\nappearance, in his manner, and in the personality that lay behind, which\r\nnever failed to impress observers, and gradually he attached to himself\r\nthe most brilliant undergraduates of his time and became a leader among\r\nthem. Thackeray and FitzGerald were in residence; but it was not till\r\nlater that he came to know them well, and we hear more of Spedding (the\r\neditor of Bacon), of Alford and Merivale (deans of Canterbury and Ely),\r\nof Trench (Archbishop of Dublin), of Lushington, who married one of his\r\nsisters, and of Arthur Hallam, who was engaged to another sister at the\r\ntime of his early death. Hallam came from Eton, where his greatest\r\nfriend had been W. E. Gladstone, and he had not been long at Cambridge\r\nbefore he was led by kindred tastes and kindred nature into close\r\nfriendship with Tennyson. In the judgement of all who knew him, a career\r\nof the highest usefulness and distinction was assured to him. His\r\nintellectual force and his high aspirations would have shone in the\r\npublic service; and at least they won him thus early the affection of\r\nthe noblest among his compeers, and a fame that is almost unique in\r\nEnglish literature.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the society which these young men formed and\r\nwhich they called 'the Apostles'. The name has been thought to suggest a\r\ncertain complacency and mutual admiration. But enough letters and\r\npersonal recollections of their talk have been preserved to show how\r\nsimple and unaffected the members were in their intercourse with one\r\nanother. They had their enthusiasms, but they had also their jests.\r\nTheir humour was not perhaps the boisterous fun of William Morris and\r\nRossetti, but it was lively and buoyant enough to banish all suspicion\r\nof priggishness. Just because their enthusiasm was for the best in\r\nliterature and art, Tennyson was quickly at home among them. Already he\r\nhad learnt at home to love Shakespeare and Milton, Coleridge and Keats,\r\nand no effort was required, in this circle of friends, to keep his\r\nreading upon this high level. _Lycidas_ was always a special favourite\r\nof Tennyson's, and appreciation of it seemed to him a sure 'touchstone\r\nof poetic taste'. In conversation he did not tend to declaim or\r\nmonopolize the talk. He was noted rather for short sayings and for\r\ncriticisms tersely expressed. He had his moods, contemplative, genial or\r\ngay; but all his utterances were marked by independence of thought, and\r\nhis silence could be richer than the speech of other men. But for\r\ndisplay he had no liking. In fact, so reluctant was he to face an\r\naudience of strangers, that when in 1829 it was his duty to recite his\r\nprize poem in the senate-house, he obtained leave for Merivale to read\r\nit on his behalf. On the other hand, he was ready enough to impart to\r\nhis real friends the poems that he wrote from time to time, and he would\r\npass pleasant hours with them reciting old ballads and reading aloud the\r\nplays of Shakespeare. His sonorous voice, his imagination, and his\r\nfeeling for all the niceties of rhythm made his reading unusually\r\nimpressive, as we know from the testimony of many who heard him.\r\n\r\nThe course of his education is, in fact, more truly to be found in this\r\nfree companionship than in the lecture room or the examination hall. His\r\nopinion of the teaching which he received from the Dons was formed and\r\nexpressed in a sonnet of 1830, though he refrained from publishing it\r\nfor half a century. He addresses them as 'you that do profess to teach\r\nand teach us nothing, feeding not the heart'--and complains of their\r\nindifference to the movements of their own age and to the needs of their\r\npupils. For, despite the ferment which was spreading in the realms of\r\ntheology, of politics, and of natural science, the Dons still taught\r\ntheir classics in the dry pedantic manner of the past, and refused to\r\nface the problems of the nineteenth century. For Tennyson, whose mind\r\nwas already capacious and deep, these problems had a constant\r\nattraction, and he had to fall back upon solitary musings and on talks\r\nwith Hallam and other friends. Partly perhaps because he missed the more\r\nrigorous training of the schools, we have to wait another ten years\r\nbefore we see marks of his deeper thinking in his work. He was but\r\ngroping and feeling his way. In the 'Poems, chiefly Lyrical' which he\r\nproduced in 1830, rich images abound, play of fancy and beauty of\r\nexpression; but there are few signs of the power of thought which he was\r\nto show in later volumes.\r\n\r\nAfter three years thus spent, by no means unfruitfully, though it was\r\nonly by his prize poem of 'Timbuctoo' that he won public honours, he was\r\ncalled away from Cambridge by family troubles and returned to Somersby\r\nin February 1831. His father had broken down in health, and a month\r\nlater he died, suddenly and peacefully, in his arm-chair. After the\r\nrector's death an arrangement was made that the family should continue\r\nto inhabit the Rectory; and Tennyson, who was now his mother's chief\r\nhelp and stay, settled down to a studious life at home, varied by\r\noccasional visits to London. The habit of seclusion was already forming.\r\nHe was much given to solitary walking and to spending his evening in an\r\nattic reading by himself. But this was not due to moroseness or\r\nselfishness, as we can see from his intercourse with family and friends.\r\nHe would willingly give hours to reading aloud to his mother, or sit\r\nlistening happily while his sisters played music. From this time indeed\r\nhe seems to have taken his father's place in the home; and with Hallam\r\nand other friends he continued on the same affectionate terms. He had\r\nnot Dickens's buoyant temper and love of company, nor did he indulge in\r\nthe splenetic outbursts of Carlyle. He could, when it was needed, find\r\ntime to fulfil the humblest duties and then return with contentment to\r\nhis solitude. But his thoughts seemed naturally to lift him above the\r\nlevel of others, and he was most truly himself when he was alone. Apart\r\nfrom his eyesight, which began to trouble him at this time, he was\r\nenjoying good health, which he maintained by a steady regime of physical\r\nexercise. His strength and his good looks were alike remarkable.[25] As\r\nhis friend Brookfield laughingly said, 'It was not fair that he should\r\nbe Hercules as well as Apollo'.\r\n\r\nAnother volume of verse appeared in 1832; and its appearance seems to\r\nhave been due rather to the urgent persuasion of his friends than to his\r\nown eagerness to appear in print. Though J. S. Mill and a few other\r\ncritics wrote with good judgement and praised the book, it met with a\r\ncold reception in most places, and the _Quarterly Review_, regardless of\r\nits blunder over Keats, spoke of it in most contemptuous terms. All can\r\nrecognize to-day how unfair this was to the merits of a volume which\r\ncontained the 'Lotos-Eaters', 'Oenone', and the 'Lady of Shalott'; but\r\nthe effect of the harsh verdict on the poet, always sensitive about the\r\nreception of his work, was unfortunate to a degree. For a time it seemed\r\nlikely to chill his ardour and stifle his poetic gifts at the very age\r\nwhen they ought to be bearing fruit. He writes of himself at this time\r\nas 'moping like an owl in an ivy bush, or as that one sparrow which the\r\nHebrew mentioneth as sitting on the house-top'; and, despite his\r\nfriendship with Hallam, which was closer than ever since the latter's\r\nengagement to his sister Emily, he had thoughts of settling abroad in\r\nFrance or Italy, since he found, or fancied that he found, in England\r\ntoo unsympathetic an atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Note 25: The portrait of 1838 by Samuel Laurence, of which the\r\noriginal is at Aldworth, speaks for itself.]\r\n\r\nSuch a decision would have been disastrous. Residence abroad might suit\r\nthe robust, many-sided genius of Robert Browning with his gift for\r\ninterpreting the thoughts of other nations and other times; it would\r\nhave been fatal to Tennyson, whose affections were rooted in his native\r\nsoil, and who had a special call to speak to Englishmen of English\r\nscenes and English life.\r\n\r\nThe following year brought him a still severer shock in the loss of his\r\nbeloved friend, Arthur Hallam, who was taken ill at Vienna and died\r\nthere a few days later, to the deep sorrow of all who knew him. Many\r\nbesides Tennyson have borne witness to his character and gifts; thanks\r\nto their tribute, and above all to the verses of _In Memoriam_, though\r\nhis life was all too short to realize the promise of his youth, his name\r\nwill be preserved. The gradual growth of Tennyson's elegy can be\r\ndiscerned from the letters of his friends, to whom from time to time he\r\nread some of the stanzas which he had completed. Even in the first\r\nwinter after Hallam's death, he wrote a few lines in the manuscript book\r\nwhich he kept by him for the purpose during the next fifteen years, and\r\nwhich he was within an ace of losing in 1850, just when the poem was\r\ncompleted and ready for publication. As a statesman turns from his\r\nprivate sorrow to devote himself to a public cause, so the poet's\r\ninstinct was to find comfort in the practice of his art. Under the\r\nstress of feelings aroused by this event and under the influence of a\r\nwider reading, his mind was maturing. We hear of a steady discipline of\r\nmental work, of hours given methodically to Italian and German, to\r\ntheology and history, to chemistry, botany, and other branches of\r\nscience. Above all, he pondered now, as he did later so constantly, on\r\nthe mystery of death and life after death. Outwardly this seems the most\r\nuneventful period of his career; but, in their effect on his mind and\r\nwork, these years were very far from being wasted. When next, in 1842,\r\nhe emerges from seclusion to offer his verses to the public, he had\r\nenlarged the range of his subjects and deepened his powers of thought.\r\nWe see less richness in the images, less freedom in the play of fancy,\r\nbut there is a firmer grip of character, a surer handling of the\r\nproblems affecting the life of man. Underground was flowing the hidden\r\nstream of _In Memoriam_, unknown save to the few; only in part were the\r\nfruits of this period to be seen in the two volumes containing 'English\r\nIdyls' and other new poems, along with a selection of earlier lyrics now\r\nrevised and reprinted.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive quality of the book is given by the word Idyl, which was\r\nto be so closely connected with Tennyson's fame. Here he is working in a\r\nsmall compass, but he breaks fresh ground in describing scenes of\r\nEnglish village life, and shows that he has used his gifts of\r\nobservation to good purpose. Better than the slight sketches of\r\ncharacter, of girls and their lovers, of farmers and their children, are\r\nthe landscapes in which they are set; and many will remember the\r\ncharming passages in which he describes the morning songs of birds in a\r\ngarden, or the twinkling of evening lights in the still waters of a\r\nharbour. More original and more full of lyrical fervour was 'Locksley\r\nHall', where he expresses many thoughts that were stirring the younger\r\nspirits of his day. Perhaps the most perfect workmanship, in a volume\r\nwhere much calls for admiration, is to be found in 'Ulysses', which the\r\npoet's friend Monckton Milnes gave to Sir Robert Peel to read, in order\r\nto convince him that Tennyson's work merited official recognition. His\r\ntreatment of the hero is as far from the classical spirit as anything\r\nwhich William Morris wrote. He preserves little of the directness or\r\nfierce temper of the early epic. Rather does his Ulysses think and speak\r\nlike some bold adventurer of the Renaissance, with the combination of\r\nardent curiosity and reflective thought which was the mark of that age.\r\nEven so Tennyson himself, as he passed from youth to middle life, and\r\nfrom that to old age, was ever trying to achieve one more 'work of noble\r\nnote', and yearning\r\n\r\n    To follow knowledge like a sinking star\r\n    Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.\r\n\r\nBut between this and the production of his next volume comes the most\r\nunhappy period in the poet's career, when his friends for a time\r\ndespaired of his future and even of his life. At the marriage of his\r\nbrother Charles in 1836, Tennyson had fallen in love with the bride's\r\nsister, Emily Sellwood; and in the course of the next three or four\r\nyears they became informally engaged to one another. But his prospects\r\nof earning enough money to support a wife seemed so remote that in 1840\r\nher family insisted on breaking off the engagement, and the lovers\r\nceased to write to one another. Even the volumes of 1842, while winning\r\nhigh favour with cultivated readers, and stirring enthusiasm at the\r\nUniversities, failed to attract the larger public and to make a success\r\nin the market. So when he sustained a further blow in the loss of his\r\nsmall fortune owing to an unwise investment, his health gave way and he\r\nfell into a dark mood of hypochondria. His star seemed to be sinking,\r\njust as he was winning his way to fame. Thanks to medical attention,\r\naided by his own natural strength and the affections of his friends, he\r\nwas already rallying in 1845, when Peel conferred on him the timely\r\nhonour of a pension; and he was able not only to continue working at _In\r\nMemoriam_, but also to produce in 1847 _The Princess_, which gives clear\r\nevidence of renewed cheerfulness and vigour. Dealing as it does, half\r\nhumorously, with the question of woman's education and her claim to a\r\nhigher place in the scheme of life, it illustrates the interest which\r\nTennyson, despite his seclusion, felt in social questions of the day.\r\nFrom this point of view it may be linked with _Locksley Hall_ and\r\n_Maud_; but in _The Princess_ the treatment is half humorous and the\r\nsetting is more artificial. Tennyson's lyrical power is seen at its best\r\nin the magical songs which occur in the course of the story or\r\ninterposed between the different scenes. They have deservedly won a\r\nplace in all anthologies. His facility in the handling of blank verse is\r\nalso remarkable. Lovers of Milton may regret the massive grandeur of an\r\nearlier style; but, as in every art, so in poetry, we pay for advance in\r\ntechnical accomplishment, in suppleness and melodious phrasing, by the\r\nloss of other qualities which are difficult to recapture.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile _In Memoriam_ was approaching completion; and this the most\r\ncentral and characteristic of his poems illustrates, more truly than a\r\nnarrative of outward events, the phases through which Tennyson had been\r\npassing. Desultory though the method of its production be, and loose\r\n'the texture of its fabric', there is a certain sequence of thought\r\nrunning through the cantos. We see how from the first poignancy of\r\ngrief, when he can only brood passively over his friend's death, he was\r\nled to questioning the basis of his faith, shaken as it was by the\r\nclaims of physical science--how from those doubts of his own, he was led\r\nto think of the universal trouble of the world--how at length by\r\nthrowing himself into the hopes and aspiration of humanity he attained\r\nto victory and was able to put away his personal grief, believing that\r\nhis friend's soul was still working with him in the universe for the\r\ngood of all. At intervals, during the three years mirrored in the poem,\r\nwe get definite notes of time. We see how the poet is affected each year\r\nas the winter and the spring come round, and how the succeeding\r\nanniversaries of Hallam's death stir the old pain in varying degree. But\r\nwe must not suppose that each section was composed at the time\r\nrepresented in this scheme. Seventeen years went to the perfecting of\r\nthe work; it is impossible to tell when each canto was first outlined\r\nand how often it was re-written; and we must be content with general\r\nnotions of its development. The poet's memory was fully charged. As he\r\ncould recall so vividly the Lincolnshire landscape when he was living in\r\nthe south, so he could portray the emotions of the past though he had\r\nentered on a new period of life fraught with a different spirit.\r\n\r\nThus many elements go to make up the whole, and readers of _In Memoriam_\r\ncan choose what suits their mood. To some, who wish to compare the\r\nproblems of different ages, chief interest will attach to that section\r\nwhere the active mind wakes up to the conflict between science and\r\nfaith. It was a difficult age for poets and believers. The preceding\r\ngeneration had for a time been swept far from their bearings by the\r\ntornado of the French Revolution. Some of them found an early grave\r\nwhile still upholding the flag; others had won back to harbour when\r\ntheir youth was past and ended their days in calm--if not\r\nstagnant--waters. But the advance of scientific discoveries and the\r\nscientific spirit sapped the defences of faith in more methodical\r\nfashion, and Tennyson's mind was only too open to all the evidence of\r\nnatural law and the stern lessons of the struggle for life. To\r\nunderstand the influence of Tennyson on his age it is necessary to\r\ninquire how he reconciled religion with science; but this is too large a\r\nsubject for a biographical sketch, and valuable studies have been\r\nwritten which deal with it more or less fully, by Stopford Brooke[26]\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\n[Note 26: _Tennyson_, by Stopford Brooke (Isbister, 1894).]\r\n\r\nTo Queen Victoria, and to others who had been stricken in their home\r\naffections, the human interest outweighed all others; the sorrow of\r\nthose who gave little thought to systems of philosophy or religion was\r\ninstinctively comforted by the note of faith in a future life and by\r\nthe haunting melodies in which it found expression.\r\n\r\nMany were content to return again and again to those passages where the\r\nbeauty of nature is depicted in stanzas of wonderful felicity. No such\r\ngift of observation had yet ministered to their delight. Readers of Mrs.\r\nGaskell will be reminded of the old farmer in _Cranford_ revelling in\r\nthe new knowledge which he has gained of the colour of ash-buds in\r\nMarch. So too we are taught to look afresh at larch woods in spring and\r\nbeech woods in autumn, at the cedar in the garden and the yew tree in\r\nthe churchyard. We are vividly conscious of the summer's breeze which\r\ntumbles the pears in the orchard, and the winter's storm when the\r\nleafless ribs of the wood clang and gride. As the perfect stanza lingers\r\nin our memory, our eyes are opened and we are taught to observe the\r\nmarvels of nature for ourselves. Here, more than anywhere else, is he\r\nthe true successor of Wordsworth, the Wordsworth of the daisy, the\r\ndaffodil, and the lesser celandine, though following a method of his\r\nown--at once a disciple and a master.\r\n\r\nBut other influences than those of nature were coming into his life. In\r\n1837 the Tennyson family had been compelled to leave Somersby; and the\r\npoet, recluse though he was, showed that he could rouse himself to meet\r\na practical emergency with good sense. He took charge of all\r\narrangements and transplanted his mother successively to new homes in\r\nEssex and Kent. This brought him nearer to London and enlarged\r\nconsiderably his circle of friends. The list of men of letters who\r\nwelcomed him there is a long one, from Samuel Rogers to the Rossettis,\r\nand includes poets, novelists, historians, scholars, and scientists. The\r\nmost interesting, to him and to us, was Carlyle, then living at Chelsea,\r\nwho had published his _French Revolution_ in 1837, and had thereby\r\nbecome notable among literary men. Carlyle's judgements on the poet and\r\nhis poems have often been quoted. At first he was more than contemptuous\r\nover the latter, and exhorted Tennyson to leave verse and rhyme and\r\napply himself to prose. But familiar converse, in which both men spoke\r\ntheir opinions without reserve, soon enlightened 'the sage', and he\r\ndelighted in his new friend. Long after, in 1879, he confessed that\r\n'Alfred always from the beginning took a grip at the right side of every\r\nquestion'. He could not fail to appreciate the man when he saw him in\r\nthe flesh, and it is he who has left us the most striking picture of\r\nTennyson's appearance in middle life. In 1842 he wrote to Emerson:\r\n'Alfred is one of the few... figures who are and remain beautiful to\r\nme;--a true human soul... one of the finest-looking men in the world. A\r\ngreat shock of rough dusty-dark hair, bright-laughing hazel eyes,\r\nmassive aquiline face, most massive yet most delicate, of sallow-brown\r\ncomplexion, almost Indian-looking; clothes cynically loose,\r\nfree-and-easy;--smokes infinite tobacco. His voice is musical\r\nmetallic,--fit for loud laughter and piercing wail, and all that may lie\r\nbetween; speech and speculation free and plenteous: I do not meet, in\r\nthese late decades, such company over a pipe!' Not only were pipes\r\nsmoked at home, but walks were taken in the London streets at night,\r\nwith much free converse, in which art both were masters, but of which\r\nCarlyle, no doubt, had the larger share. Tennyson was a master of the\r\nart of silence, which Carlyle could praise but never practice; but when\r\nhe spoke his remarks rarely failed to strike the bell.\r\n\r\nAnother comrade worthy of special notice was FitzGerald, famous to-day\r\nas the translator of Omar Khayyam, and also as the man whom two great\r\nauthors, Tennyson and Thackeray, named as their most cherished friend.\r\nHe was living a hermit's life in Suffolk, dividing his day between his\r\nyacht, his garden, and his books; and writing, when he was in the\r\nhumour, those gossipy letters which have placed him as a classic with\r\nCowper and Lamb. From time to time he would come to London for a visit\r\nto a picture gallery or an evening with his friends; and for many years\r\nhe never failed to write once a year for news of the poet, whose books\r\nhe might criticize capriciously, but whose image was always fresh in his\r\naffectionate heart. Of his old Cambridge circle Tennyson honoured, above\r\nall others, 'his domeship' James Spedding, of the massive rounded head,\r\nof the rare judgement in literature, of the unselfish and faithful\r\ndischarge of all the duties which he could take upon himself. Great as\r\nwas his edition of Bacon, he was by the common consent of his friends\r\nfar greater than anything which he achieved, and his memory is most\r\nworthily preserved in the letters of Tennyson, and of others who knew\r\nhim. In London he was present at gatherings where Landor and Leigh Hunt\r\nrepresented the elder generation of poets; but he was more familiar with\r\nhis contemporaries Henry Taylor and Aubrey de Vere. It is the latter who\r\ngives us an interesting account of two meetings between Wordsworth and\r\nhis successor in the Laureateship.[27] The occasions when Tennyson and\r\nBrowning met one another and read their poetry aloud were also cherished\r\nin the memory of those friends who were fortunate enough to be\r\npresent.[28] Differing as they did in temperament and in tastes, they\r\nwere rivals in generosity to one another and indeed to all their\r\nbrethren who wielded the pen of the writer. To meet such choice spirits\r\nTennyson would leave for a while his precious solitude and his books.\r\nLondon could not be his home, but it became a place of pleasant meetings\r\nand of friendships in which he found inspiration and help.\r\n\r\n[Note 27: _Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir_, by his son, vol. i, p.\r\n209 (Macmillan & Co.).]\r\n\r\n[Note 28: _Robert Browning_, by Edward Dowden, p. 173 (J. M. Dent &\r\nCo.).]\r\n\r\nThus it was that Tennyson spent the quiet years of meditation and study\r\nbefore he achieved his full renown. This was no such sensational event\r\nas Byron's meteoric appearance in 1812; but one year, 1850, is a clear\r\nlandmark in his career. This was the date of the publication of _In\r\nMemoriam_ and of his appointment, on the death of Wordsworth, to the\r\noffice of Poet Laureate. This year saw the end of his struggle with\r\nill-fortune and the end of his long courtship. In June he was married,\r\nat Shiplake on the Thames, to Emily Sellwood. Henceforth his happiness\r\nwas assured and he knew no more the restlessness and melancholy which\r\nhad clouded his enjoyment of life. His course was clear, and for forty\r\nyears his position was hardly questioned in all lands where the English\r\ntongue was spoken. Noble companies of worshippers might worthily swear\r\nallegiance to Thackeray and Browning; but by the voice of the people\r\nDickens and Tennyson were enthroned supreme.\r\n\r\nTo deal with all the volumes of poetry that Tennyson published between\r\n1850 and his death would be impossible within the limits of these pages.\r\nIn some cases he reverted to themes which he had treated before and he\r\npreserved for many years the same skill in craftsmanship. But in _Maud_,\r\nin _The Idylls of the King_, and in the historical dramas,\r\nunquestionably, he broke new ground.\r\n\r\nPartly on account of the scheme of the poem, partly for the views\r\nexpressed on questions of the day, _Maud_ provoked more hostile\r\ncriticism than anything which he wrote; yet it seems to have been the\r\npoet's favourite work. The story of its composition is curious. It was\r\nsuggested by a short lyric which Tennyson had printed privately in 1837\r\nbeginning with the words 'Oh, that 'twere possible after long grief'.\r\nHis friend, Sir John Simeon, urged him to write a poem which would lead\r\nup to and explain it; and the poet, adopting the idea, used _Maud_ as a\r\nvehicle for much which he was feeling in the disillusionment of middle\r\nlife. The form of a monodrama was unfamiliar to the public and has\r\ndifficulties of its own. Tennyson has combined action, proceeding\r\nsomewhat spasmodically, with a skilful study of character, showing us\r\nthe exaggerated sensibility of a nature which under the successive\r\ninfluence of misanthropy, hope, love, and tragic disappointment, may\r\neasily pass beyond the border-land of insanity. In the scene where love\r\nis triumphant, Tennyson touches the highest point of lyrical passion;\r\nbut there are jarring notes introduced in the satirical descriptions of\r\nMaud's brother and of the rival who aspires to her hand. And in the\r\nlater cantos where, after the fatal quarrel, the hero is driven to moody\r\nthoughts and dark presages of woe, there are passages which seem to be\r\ncharged with the doctrine that England was being corrupted by long peace\r\nand needed the purifying discipline of war. For this the poet was taken\r\nto task by his critics; and, though it is unfair in dramatic work to\r\nattribute to an author the words of his characters, Tennyson found it\r\ndifficult to clear himself of suspicion, the more so that the Crimean\r\nWar inspired at this time some of his most popular martial ballads and\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\n_The Idylls of the King_ had a different fate and achieved instant\r\npopularity. The first four were published in 1859 and within a few\r\nmonths 10,000 copies were sold. Tennyson's original design, formed early\r\nin life, had been to build a single epic on the Arthurian theme, which\r\nseemed to him to give scope, like Virgil's _Aeneid_, for patriotic\r\ntreatment. 'The greatest of all poetical subjects' he called it, and it\r\nhaunted his mind perpetually. But if Virgil found such a task difficult\r\nnineteen hundred years before, it was doubly difficult for Tennyson to\r\nsatisfy his generation, with scientific historians raking the ash heaps\r\nof the past, and pedants demanding local colour. In shaping his poem to\r\nmeet the requirements of history he was in danger of losing that breadth\r\nof treatment which is essential for epic poetry. He fell back on the\r\ndevice of selecting episodes, each a complete picture in itself, and\r\ngrouping them round a single hero. The story is placed in the twilight\r\nbetween the Roman withdrawal and the conquests of the Saxons, when the\r\nlamp of history was glimmering most faintly. In these troublous times a\r\nking is miraculously sent to be a bulwark to the people against the\r\ninroads of their foes. He founds an order of Knighthood bound by vows to\r\nfight for all just and noble causes, and upholds for a time victoriously\r\nthe standard of chivalry within his realm, till through the entrance of\r\nsin and treachery the spell is broken and the heathen overrun the land.\r\nAfter his last battle, in the far west of our island, the king passes\r\naway to the supernatural world from which he came. This last episode had\r\nbeen handled many years before, and the 'Morte d'Arthur', which had\r\nappeared in the volume of 1842, was incorporated into the 'Passing of\r\nArthur' to close the series of Idylls.\r\n\r\nWith what admixture of allegory this story was set out it is hard to\r\nsay--Tennyson himself could not in later years be induced to define his\r\npurpose--but it seems certain that many of the characters are intended\r\nto symbolize higher and lower qualities. According to some\r\ninterpretations King Arthur stands for the power of conscience and Queen\r\nGuinevere for the heart. Galahad represents purity, Bors rough honesty,\r\nPercivale humility, and Merlin the power of the intellect, which is too\r\neasily beguiled by treachery. So the whole story is moralized by the\r\nentrance, through Guinevere and Lancelot, of sin; by the gradual fading,\r\nthrough the lightness of one or the treachery of another, of the\r\nbrightness of chivalry; and by the final ruin which shatters the fair\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need to darken counsel by questions about history or\r\nallegory, if we wish, first and last, to enjoy poetry, for its own sake.\r\nHere, as in Spenser's _Faerie Queene_, forth go noble knights with\r\ngentle maidens through the enchanted scenes of fairyland; for their\r\norder and its vows they are ready to dare all. Lawlessness is tamed and\r\ncruelty is punished, and no perilous quest presents itself but there is\r\na champion ready to follow it to the end. And if severe critics tell us\r\nthat they find no true gift of story-telling here, let us go for a\r\nverdict to the young. They may not be good judges of style, or safe\r\ninterpreters of shades of thought, but they know when a story carries\r\nthem away; and the _Idylls of the King_, like the Waverley Novels, have\r\ncaptured the heart of many a lover of literature who has not yet learnt\r\nto question his instinct or to weigh his treasures in the scales of\r\ncriticism. And older readers may find themselves kindled to enthusiasm\r\nby reflective passages rich in high aspiration, or charmed by\r\ndescriptions of nature as beautiful as anything which Tennyson wrote.\r\n\r\nIn the historical plays, which occupied a large part of his attention\r\nbetween 1874 and 1879, Tennyson undertook a yet harder task. He chose\r\nperiods when national issues of high importance were at stake, such as\r\nthe conflict between the Church and the Crown, between the domination of\r\nthe priest and the claim of the individual to freedom of belief. He put\r\naside all exuberance of fancy and diction as unsuited to tragedy; he\r\nhandled his theme with dignity and at times with force, and attained a\r\nliterary success to which Browning and other good judges bore testimony.\r\nOf Becket in particular he made a sympathetic figure, which, in the\r\nskilful hands of Henry Irving, won considerable favour upon the stage.\r\nBut the times were out of joint for the poetic drama, and he had not the\r\nrich imagination of Shakespeare, nor the power to create living men and\r\nwomen who compel our hearts to pity, to horror, or to delight. For the\r\nabsence of this no studious reading of history, no fine sentiment, no\r\nnoble cadences, can make amends, and it seems doubtful whether future\r\nages will regard the plays as anything but a literary curiosity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, nothing which he wrote has touched the human heart\r\nmore genuinely than the poems of peasant life, some of them written in\r\nthe broadest Lincolnshire dialect, which Tennyson produced during the\r\nyears in which he was engaged on the Idylls and the plays. 'The\r\nGrandmother', 'The Northern Cobbler', and the two poems on the\r\nLincolnshire farmers of following generations, were as popular as\r\nanything which the Victorian Age produced, and seem likely to keep their\r\npre-eminence. The two latter illustrate, by their origin, Tennyson's\r\npower of seizing on a single impression, and building on it a work of\r\ncreative genius. It was enough for him to hear the anecdote of the dying\r\nfarmer's words, 'God A'mighty little knows what he's about in taking me!\r\nAnd Squire will be mad'; and he conceived the character of the man, and\r\nhis absorption in the farm where he had lived and worked and around\r\nwhich he grouped his conceptions of religion and duty. The later type of\r\nfarmer was evoked similarly by a quotation in the dialect of his county:\r\n'When I canters my herse along the ramper, I 'ears \"proputty, proputty,\r\nproputty\"'; and again Tennyson achieved a triumph of characterization.\r\nIt is here perhaps that he comes nearest to the achievements of his\r\ngreat rival Browning in the field of dramatic lyrics.\r\n\r\nApart from the writing and publication of his poems, we cannot divide\r\nTennyson's later life into definite sections. By 1850 his habits had\r\nbeen formed, his friendships established, his fame assured; such\r\nlandmarks as are furnished by the birth of his children, by his\r\njourneyings abroad, by the homes in which he settled, point to no\r\nessential change in the current of his life. Of the perfect happiness\r\nwhich marriage brought to him, of the charm and dignity which enabled\r\nMrs. Tennyson to hold her place worthily at his side, many witnesses\r\nhave spoken. Two sons were born to him, one of whom died in 1886, while\r\nthe other, named after his lost friend, lived to write the Memoir which\r\nwill always be the chief authority for our knowledge of the man. His\r\nhomes soon became household words--so great was the spell which Tennyson\r\ncast over the hearts of his readers. Farringford, at the western end of\r\nthe Isle of Wight, was first tenanted by him in 1853, and was bought in\r\n1856. Here the poet enjoyed perfect quiet, a genial climate and the\r\nproximity of the sea, for which his love never failed. It was a very\r\ndifferent coast to the bleak sandhills and wide flats of Mablethorpe.\r\nAbove Freshwater the noble line of the Downs rises and falls as it runs\r\nwestward to the Needles, where it plunges abruptly into the sea; and\r\nhere on the springy turf, a tall romantic figure in wide-brimmed hat and\r\nflowing cloak, the poet would often walk. But Farringford, lying low in\r\nthe shelter of the hills, proved too hot in summer; Freshwater was\r\ndiscovered by tourists too often inquisitive about the great; and so,\r\nafter ten or twelve years, he was searching for another home, some\r\nremoter fastness set on higher ground. This he discovered on the borders\r\nof Surrey and Sussex near Haslemere, where Black Down rises to a height\r\nof 900 feet above the sea and commands a wide prospect over the blue\r\nexpanse of the weald. Here he found copses and commons haunted by the\r\nsong of birds, here he raised plantations close at hand to shelter him\r\nfrom the rude northern winds, and here he built the stately house of\r\nAldworth where, some thirty years later, he was to die.\r\n\r\nTo both houses came frequent guests. For, shy as he was of paying\r\nvisits, he loved to see in his own house men and women who could talk to\r\nhim as equals--nor was he always averse to those of reverent temper, so\r\nthey were careful not to jar on his fastidious tastes. In some ways it\r\nwas a pity that he did not come to closer quarters with the rougher\r\nforces that were fermenting in the industrial districts. It might have\r\nhelped him to a better understanding of the classes that were pushing to\r\nthe front, who were to influence so profoundly the England of the\r\nmorrow. But the strain of kindly sympathy in Tennyson's nature can be\r\nseen at its best in his intercourse with cottagers, sailors, and other\r\nhumble folk who lived near his doors. The stories which his son tells us\r\nshow how the poet was able to obtain an insight into their minds and to\r\nwrite poems like 'The Grandmother' with artistic truth. And no visitor\r\nreceived a heartier welcome at Farringford than Garibaldi, who was at\r\nonce peasant and sailor, and who remained so none the less when he had\r\nbecome a hero of European fame. To Englishmen of nearly every cultured\r\nprofession Tennyson's hospitality was freely extended--we need only\r\ninstance Professor Tyndall, Dean Bradley, James Anthony Froude, Aubrey\r\nde Vere, G. F. Watts, Henry Irving, Hubert Parry, Lord Dufferin, and\r\nthat most constant of friends, Benjamin Jowett, pre-eminent among the\r\nOxford celebrities of the day. Among his immediate neighbours he\r\nconceived a peculiar affection for Sir John Simeon, whose death in 1870\r\ncalled forth the stanzas 'In the Garden at Swainston'; and no one was\r\nmore at home at Farringford than Julia Cameron, famous among early\r\nphotographers, who has left us some of the best likenesses of the poet\r\nin middle and later life.\r\n\r\nTennyson was not familiar with foreign countries to the same degree as\r\nBrowning, nor was he ever a great traveller. When he went abroad he\r\nneeded the help of some loyal friend, like Francis Palgrave or Frederick\r\nLocker, to safeguard him against pitfalls, and to shield him from\r\nannoyance. When he was too old to stand the fatigue of railway\r\njourneys, he was willing to be taken for a cruise on a friend's yacht;\r\nand thus he visited many parts of Scotland and the harbours of\r\nScandinavia. Amid new surroundings he was not always easy to please; bad\r\nfood or smelly streets would call forth loud protests and upset him for\r\na day; but his friends found it worth their while to risk some anxiety\r\nin order to enjoy his keen observation and the originality of his talk.\r\nWherever he went he took with him his stored wisdom on Homer, Dante, and\r\nthe 'Di maiores' of literature; and when Gladstone, too, happened to be\r\none of the party on board ship, the talk must have been well worth\r\nhearing. As in his youth, so now, Tennyson's mind moved most naturally\r\non a lofty plane and he was most at home with the great poets of the\r\npast; and with the exception of a few poems like 'All along the valley',\r\nwhere the torrents at Cauteretz reminded him of an early visit with\r\nHallam to the Pyrenees, we can trace little evidence in his poetry of\r\nthe journeys which he made. But we can see from his letters that he was\r\nkindled by the beauty of Italian cities and their treasures. In every\r\npicture-gallery which he visited he showed his preference for Titian and\r\nthe rich colour of the Venetian painters. He refused to be bound by the\r\nconventional English taste for Alpine scenery, and broke out into abuse\r\nof the discoloured water in the Grindelwald glacier--'a filthy thing,\r\nand looking as if a thousand London seasons had passed over it'. In all\r\nplaces, among all people, he said what he thought and felt, with\r\nindependence and conviction.\r\n\r\nOne incident connecting him with Italy is worthy of mention as showing\r\nthat the poet, who 'from out the northern island' came at times to visit\r\nthem, was known and esteemed by the people of Italy. When the Mantuans\r\ncelebrated in 1885 the nineteenth centenary of the death of Virgil, the\r\nclassic poet to whom Tennyson owed most, they asked him to write an\r\node, and nobly he rose to the occasion, attaining a felicity of phrase\r\nwhich is hardly excelled in the choicest lines of Virgil himself. But it\r\nis as the laureate of his own country that he is of primary interest,\r\nand it is time to inquire how he fulfilled the functions of his office,\r\nand how he rendered that office of value to the State.\r\n\r\nWhen he was first appointed, Queen Victoria had let him know that he was\r\nto be excused from the obligation of writing complimentary verse to\r\ncelebrate the doings of the court. Of his own accord he composed\r\noccasional odes for the marriages of her sons, and showed some of his\r\npractised skill in dignifying such themes; but it is not here that he\r\nfound his work as laureate. He achieved greater success in the poems\r\nwhich he wrote to honour the exploits of our army and navy, in the past\r\nor the present. In his ballad of 'The Revenge', in his Balaclava poems,\r\nin the 'Siege of Lucknow', he struck a heroic note which found a ready\r\necho in the hearts of soldiers and sailors and those who love the\r\nservices. Above all, in the great ode on the death of the Duke of\r\nWellington he has stirred all the chords of national feeling as no other\r\nlaureate before him, and has enriched our literature with a jewel which\r\nis beyond price.\r\n\r\nThe Arthurian epic failed to achieve its national aim, and the\r\nhistorical dramas, though inspired by great principles which have helped\r\nto shape our history, never touched those large circles to which as\r\nlaureate he should appeal. Some might judge that his function was best\r\nfulfilled in the lyrics to be found scattered throughout his work which\r\npraise the slow, ordered progress of English liberties. Passages from\r\n_Maud_ or _In Memoriam_ will occur to many readers, still more the three\r\nlyrics generally printed together at the end of the 1842 poems,\r\nbeginning with the well-known tines, 'Of old sat Freedom on the\r\nheights', 'Love thou thy land', and 'You ask me why though ill at ease'.\r\nHere we listen to the voice of English Liberalism uttered in very\r\ndifferent tones from those of Byron and Shelley, expressing the mind of\r\none who recoiled from French Revolutions and had little sympathy with\r\ntheir aims of universal equality. In this he represented very truly that\r\nVictorian movement which was guided by Cobden and Mill, by Peel and\r\nGladstone, which conferred such practical benefits upon the England of\r\ntheir day; but it is hardly the temper that we expect of an ardent poet,\r\nat any rate in the days of his youth. The burning passion of Carlyle,\r\nRuskin, or William Morris, however tempered by other feelings, called\r\nforth a heartier response in the breast of the toiling multitudes.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the claim of Tennyson to popular sovereignty will, in the\r\nend, rest chiefly on the pleasure which he gave to many thousands of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, a pleasure to be renewed and found again in English\r\nscenes, and in thoughts which coloured grey lives and warmed cold\r\nhearts, which shed the ray of faith on those who could accept no creeds\r\nand who yet yearned for some hope of an after-life to cheer their\r\ndeclining days. That he gave this pleasure is certain--to men and women\r\nof all classes from Samuel Bamford,[29] the Durham weaver, who saved his\r\npence to buy the precious volumes of the 'thirties, to Queen Victoria on\r\nher throne, who in the reading of _In Memoriam_ found one of her chief\r\nconsolations in the hour of widowhood.\r\n\r\n[Note 29: See _Memoir_, by Hallam, Lord Tennyson, vol. i, p. 283\r\n(Macmillan).]\r\n\r\nIt was given to Tennyson to live a long life, and to know more joy than\r\nsorrow--to be gladdened by the homage of two hemispheres, to lament the\r\nloss of his old friends who went before him (Spedding in 1881,\r\nFitzGerald in 1883, Robert Browning in 1889), to write his most famous\r\nlyric 'Crossing the Bar' at the age of 80, and to be soothed and\r\nstrengthened to the end by the presence of his wife. For some weeks in\r\nthe autumn of 1892 he lay in growing weakness at Aldworth taking\r\nfarewell of the sights and sounds that he had loved so long. To him now\r\nit had come to hear with dying ears 'the earliest pipe of half-awakened\r\nbirds' and to see with dying eyes 'the casement slowly grow a glimmering\r\nsquare'. Early on October 5 he had an access of energy, and called to\r\nhave the blinds drawn up--'I want', he said, 'to see the sky and the\r\nlight'. The next day he died, and a week later a country wagon bore the\r\ncoffin to Haslemere. Thence it passed to Westminster, where his dust was\r\nto be laid beside that of Browning, among the great men who had gone\r\nbefore. In what mood he faced death we can learn from his own words:\r\n\r\n  Spirit, nearing yon dark portal at the limit of thy human state,\r\n  Fear not thou the hidden purpose of that Power which alone is great,\r\n  Nor the myriad world, His shadow, nor the silent Opener of the Gate![30]\r\n\r\n[Note 30: 'God and the Universe,' from _Death of Oenone_, &c.\r\nMacmillan, (1892.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES KINGSLEY\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by W.

The lover of the open-air life, the\r\nsearcher after knowledge, the fighter that he was, he would have been in\r\nhis element, foremost in the fray, most eager in the quest. But it was\r\ngiven to him to live in quieter times, to graft on the old Norse stock\r\nthe graces of modern culture and the virtues of a Christian; and in a\r\npeaceful parish of rural England he found full scope for his gifts.\r\nThere he taught his own and succeeding generations how full and\r\nbeneficent the life of a parish priest can be. Our villages and towns\r\nproduced many notable types of rector in the nineteenth century, Keble,\r\nHawker, Hook, Robertson, Dolling, and scores of others; but none touched\r\nlife at more points, none became so truly national a figure as Charles\r\nKingsley in his Eversley home.\r\n\r\nHis father was of an old squire family; like his son he was a clergyman,\r\na naturalist, and a sportsman. His mother, a Miss Lucas, came from\r\nBarbados; and while she wrote poetry with feeling and skill, she had\r\nalso a practical gift of management. His father's calling involved\r\nseveral changes of residence. Those which had most influence on his son\r\nwere his removal in 1824 to Barnack, on the edge of the fens, still\r\nuntamed and full of wild life, and in 1830 to Clovelly in North Devon.\r\nMore than thirty years later, when asked to fill up the usual questions\r\nin a lady's album, he wrote that his favourite scenery was 'wide flats\r\nand open sea'. He was precocious as a child and perpetrated poems and\r\nsermons at the age of four; but very early he developed a habit of\r\nobservation and a healthy interest in things outside himself. Such a\r\nnature could not be indifferent to the beauty of Clovelly, to the coming\r\nand going of its fishermen, and to the romance and danger of their\r\nlives. The steep village-street nestling among the woods, the little\r\nharbour sheltered by the sandstone cliffs, the wide view over the blue\r\nwater, won his lifelong affection.\r\n\r\nHis parents talked of sending him to Eton or Rugby, but in the end they\r\ndecided to put him with Derwent Coleridge, the poet's son, at the\r\nGrammar School of Helston. Here he had the scenery which he loved, and\r\nmasters who developed his strong bent towards natural science; and here\r\nhe laid the foundations of his knowledge of botany, which remained all\r\nhis life his favourite recreation. He was an eager reader, but not a\r\nclose student of books; fond of outdoor life, but not skilled in\r\nathletic games; capable of much effort and much endurance, but rather\r\nirregular in his spurts of energy. A more methodical training might have\r\nsaved him some mistakes, but it might also have taken the edge off that\r\nfresh enthusiasm which made intercourse with him at all times seem like\r\na breath of moorland air. Here he developed an independence of mind and\r\na fearlessness of opinion which is rarely to be found in the atmosphere\r\nof a big public school.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen, when his father was appointed to St. Luke's,\r\nChelsea, he left Helston and spent two years attending lectures at\r\nKing's College, London, and preparing for Cambridge. These were by no\r\nmeans among his happier years. He disliked London and he rebelled\r\nagainst the dullness of life in a vicarage overrun with district\r\nvisitors and mothers' meetings. His father, a strong evangelical,\r\nobjected to various forms of public amusement, and Charles, though loyal\r\nand affectionate to his parents, fretted to find no outlet for his\r\nenergies. He made a few friends and devoured many books, but his chief\r\ndelight was to get away from town to old west-country haunts. Nor was\r\nhis life at Cambridge entirely happy. His excitability was great: his\r\nself-control was not yet developed. Rowing did not exhaust his physical\r\nenergy, which broke out from time to time in midnight fishing raids and\r\nwalks from Cambridge to London. He wasted so much of his time that he\r\nnearly imperilled his chance of taking a good degree, and might perhaps\r\ncount himself lucky when, thanks to a heroic effort at the eleventh\r\nhour, his excellent abilities won him a first class in classics. At\r\nthis time he was terribly shaken by religious doubts. But in one of his\r\nvacations in 1839 he met Fanny Grenfell, his future wife, and soon he\r\nwas on such a footing that he could open to her his inmost thoughts. It\r\nwas she who helped him in his wavering decision to take Holy Orders;\r\nand, when he went down in 1842, he set himself to read seriously and\r\nthoroughly for Ordination. Early in 1844 he was admitted to deacon's\r\norders at Farnham.\r\n\r\nHis first office marked out his path through life. With a short interval\r\nbetween his holding the curacy and the rectory of Eversley,[31] he had\r\nhis home for thirty-three years at this Hampshire village so intimately\r\nconnected with his name. Eversley lies on the borders of Berkshire and\r\nHampshire, in the diocese of Winchester, near the famous house of\r\nBramshill, on the edge of the sandy fir-covered waste which stretches\r\nacross Surrey. To understand the charm of its rough commons and\r\nself-sown woods one must read Kingsley's _Prose Idylls_, especially the\r\nsketch called 'My Winter Garden'. There he served for a year as curate,\r\nliving in bachelor quarters on the green, learning to love the place and\r\nits people: there, when Sir John Cope offered him the living in 1844, he\r\nreturned a married man to live in the Rectory House beside the church,\r\nwhich may still be seen little altered to-day. A breakdown from\r\noverwork, an illness of his wife's, a higher appointment in the Church,\r\nmight be the cause of his passing a few weeks or even months away; but\r\nyear in, year out, he gave of his very best to Eversley for thirty-three\r\nyears, and to it he returned from his journeys with all the more ardour\r\nto resume his work among his own people. The church was dilapidated, the\r\nRectory was badly drained, the parish had been neglected by an absentee\r\nrector. For long periods together Kingsley was too poor to afford a\r\ncurate: when he had one, the luxury was paid for by extra labour in\r\ntaking private pupils. He had disappointments and anxieties, but his\r\ncourage never faltered. He concentrated his energies on steady progress\r\nin things material and moral, and whatever his hand found to do, he did\r\nit with his might.\r\n\r\n[Note 31: For a few weeks in 1844 he was curate of Pimperne in\r\nDorset.]\r\n\r\nThe church and its services called for instant attention. The Holy\r\nCommunion had been celebrated only three times a year; the other\r\nservices were few and irregular; on Sundays the church was empty and the\r\nalehouse was full. The building was badly kept, the churchyard let out\r\nfor grazing, the whole place destitute of reverence. What the service\r\ncame to be under the new Rector we can read on the testimony of many\r\nvisitors. The intensity of his devotion at all times, the inspiration\r\nwhich the great festivals of the Church particularly roused in him,\r\nchanged all this rapidly. He did all he could to draw his parishioners\r\nto church; but he had no rigid Puritanical views about the Sabbath. A\r\nStaff-College officer, who frequently visited him on Sundays, tells us\r\nof 'the genial, happy, unreserved intercourse of those Sunday afternoons\r\nspent at the Rectory, and how the villagers were free to play their\r\ncricket--\"Paason he do'ant objec'--not 'e--as loik as not, 'e'll come\r\nand look on\".' All his life he supported the movement for opening\r\nmuseums to the public on Sundays, and this at a time when few of the\r\nclergy were bold enough to speak on his side. The Church was not his\r\nonly organ for teaching. He started schools and informal classes. In\r\nwinter he would sometimes give up his leisure to such work every evening\r\nof the week. The Rectory, for all its books and bottles, its\r\nfishing-rods and curious specimens, was not a mere refuge for his own\r\nwork and his own hobbies, but a centre of light and warmth where all his\r\nparishioners might come and find a welcome. He was one of the first to\r\nstart 'Penny Readings' in his parish, to lighten the monotony of winter\r\nevenings with music, poetry, stories, and lectures; and though his\r\nparish was so wide and scattered, he tried to rally support for a\r\nvillage reading-room, and kept it alive for some years.\r\n\r\nHis afternoons were regularly given to parish visiting, except when\r\nthere were other definite calls upon his time. He soon came to know\r\nevery man, woman, and child in his parish. His sympathies were so wide\r\nthat he could make himself at home with every one, with none more so\r\nthan the gipsies and poachers, who shared his intimate knowledge of the\r\nneighbouring heaths and of the practices, lawful and unlawful, by which\r\nthey could be made to supply food. He would listen to their stories,\r\nsympathize with their troubles and speak frankly in return. There was no\r\ncondescension. One of his pupils speaks of 'the simple, delicate, deep\r\nrespect for the poor', which could be seen in his manner and his talk\r\namong the cottagers. He could be severe enough when severity was needed,\r\nas when he compelled a cruel farmer to kill 'a miserable horse which was\r\nrotting alive in front of his house'; and he could deal no less\r\ndrastically with hypocrisy. When a professional beggar fell on his knees\r\nat the Rectory gate and pretended to pray, he was at once ejected by the\r\nRector with every mark of indignation and contumely. But the weak and\r\nsuffering always made a special appeal to him. Though it was easy to vex\r\nand exasperate him, he could always put away his own troubles in\r\npresence of his own children or of any who needed his help. He had that\r\nintense power of sympathy which enabled him to understand and reach the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nFrom a letter to his greatest friend, Tom Hughes, written in 1851, we\r\nget a glimpse of a day in his life--'a sorter kinder sample day'. He was\r\nup at five to see a dying man and stayed with him till eight. He then\r\nwent out for air and exercise, fished all the morning and killed eight\r\nfish. He went back to his invalid at three. Later he spent three hours\r\nattending a meeting convoked by his Archdeacon about Sunday schools, and\r\nat 10.30 he was back in his study writing to his friends.\r\n\r\nBut though he himself calls this a 'sample day', it does no justice to\r\none form of his activities. Most days in the year he would put away all\r\nthought of fishing, shut himself up in his study morning and evening,\r\nand devote himself to reading and writing. Great care was taken over his\r\nweekly sermons. Monday was, if possible, given to rest; but from Tuesday\r\ntill Friday evening they took up the chief share of his thoughts. And\r\nthen there were the books that he wrote, novels, pamphlets, history\r\nlectures, scientific essays, on which he largely depended to support his\r\nwife and family. Besides this he kept up an extensive correspondence\r\nwith friends and acquaintances. Many wrote to consult him about\r\npolitical and religious questions; from many he was himself trying to\r\ndraw information on the phenomena of the science which he was trying to\r\nstudy at the time. Among the latter were Geikie, Lyell, Wallace, and\r\nDarwin himself, giants among scientific men, to whom he wrote with\r\ngenuine humility, even when his name was a household word throughout\r\nEngland. His books can sometimes be associated with visits to definite\r\nplaces which supplied him with material. It is not difficult to connect\r\n_Westward Ho!_ with his winter at Bideford in 1854, and _Two Years Ago_\r\nwith his Pen-y-gwryd fishing in 1856. Memories of _Hereward the Wake_ go\r\nback to his early childhood in the Fens, of _Alton Locke_ to his\r\nundergraduate days at Cambridge. But he had not the time for the\r\nlaborious search after 'local colour' with which we are familiar to-day.\r\nThe bulk of the work was done in his study at Eversley, executed\r\nrapidly, some of it too rapidly; but the subjects were those of which\r\nhis mind was full, and the thoughts must have been pursued in many a\r\nquiet hour on the heathery commons or beside the streams of his own\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAbout his books, his own judgement agreed with that of his friends.\r\n'What you say about my \"Ergon\" being poetry is quite true. I could not\r\nwrite _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ and I can write poetry:... there is no denying\r\nit: I do feel a different being when I get into metre: I feel like an\r\notter in the water instead of an otter ashore.' The value of his novels\r\nis in their spirit rather than in their artistic form or truth; but it\r\nis foolish to disparage their worth, since they have exercised so marked\r\nan influence on the characters and lives of so many Englishmen,\r\nespecially our soldiers and sailors, inspiring them to higher courage\r\nand more unselfish virtue. Perhaps the best example of his prose is the\r\n_Prose Idylls_, sketches of fen-land, trout streams, and moors, which\r\ncombine his gifts so happily, his observation of natural objects, and\r\nthe poetic imagination with which he transfuses these objects and brings\r\nthem near to the heart of man. There were very few men who could draw\r\nsuch joy from familiar English landscapes, and could communicate it to\r\nothers. The cult of sport, of science, and of beauty has here become one\r\nand has found its true high priest. In poetry his more ambitious efforts\r\nwere _The Saint's Tragedy_, a drama in blank verse on the story of St.\r\nElizabeth of Hungary, and _Andromeda_, a revival of the old Greek legend\r\nin the old hexameter measure. But what are most sure to live are his\r\nlyrics, 'Airlie Beacon', 'The Three Fishers', 'The Sands of Dee', with\r\ntheir simplicity and true note of song.\r\n\r\nThe combination of this poetic gift with a strong interest in science\r\nand a wide knowledge of it is most unusual; but there can be no\r\nmistaking the genuine feeling which Charles Kingsley had for the latter.\r\nIt took one very practical form in his zeal for sanitation. In 1854 when\r\nthe public, so irrational in its moments of excitement, was calling for\r\na national fast-day on account of the spread of cholera, he heartily\r\nsupported Lord Palmerston, who refused to grant it. He held it impious\r\nand wrong to attribute to a special visitation from God what was due to\r\nthe blindness, laziness, and selfishness of our governing classes. His\r\narticle in _Fraser's Magazine_ entitled 'Who causes pestilence?' roused\r\nmuch criticism: it said things that comfortable people did not like to\r\nhear, and said them frankly; it was far in advance of the public opinion\r\nof that time, but its truth no one would dispute to-day. And what his\r\npen did for the nation, his example did for the parish. He drained\r\nunwholesome pools in his own garden, and he persuaded his neighbours to\r\ndo the same. He taught them daily lessons about the value of fresh air\r\nand clean water: no details were too dull and wearisome in the cause. To\r\nmany people his novels, like those of Dickens and Charles Reade, are\r\nspoilt by the advocacy of social reforms. The novel with a purpose was\r\ncharacteristic of the early Victorian Age, and both in _Alton Locke_ and\r\nin _Two Years Ago_ he makes little disguise of the zeal with which he\r\npreaches sanitary reform. Of the more attractive sciences, which he\r\npursued with equal intensity, there is little room to speak. Botany was\r\nhis first love and it remained first to the end. Zoology at times ran it\r\nclose, and his letters from seaside places are full of the names of\r\nmarine creatures which he stored in tanks and examined with his\r\nmicroscope. A dull day on the coast was inconceivable to him. Geology,\r\ntoo, thrilled him with its wonders, and was the subject of many letters.\r\n\r\nSide by side with his hobby of natural history went his love of sport:\r\nit was impossible for him to separate the one from the other. Fishing\r\nwas his chief delight; he pursued it with equal keenness in the chalk\r\nstreams of Hampshire, in the salmon rivers of Ireland, in the desolate\r\ntarns on the Welsh mountains. In the visitors' book of the inn at\r\nPen-y-gwryd, Tom Hughes, Tom Taylor, and he left alternate quatrains of\r\ndoggerel to celebrate their stay, written _currente calamo_, as the\r\nspirit prompted them. This is Charles Kingsley's first quatrain:\r\n\r\n    I came to Pen-y-gwryd in frantic hopes of slaying\r\n    Grilse, salmon, three-pound red-fleshed trout\r\n          and what else there's no saying:\r\n    But bitter cold and lashing rain and black nor'-eastern skies, sir,\r\n    Drove me from fish to botany, a sadder man and wiser.\r\n\r\nEach had his disappointment through the weather, which each expressed in\r\nverse; but it took more than bad weather to damp the spirits of three\r\nsuch ardent open-air enthusiasts. Hunting was another favourite sport,\r\nthough he rarely indulged himself in this luxury, and only when he could\r\ndo so without much expense. But whenever a friend gave him a mount,\r\nKingsley was ready to follow the Berkshire hounds, and with his\r\nknowledge of the country he was able to hold his own with the best.\r\n\r\nLet us try to imagine him then as he walked about the lanes and commons\r\nof Eversley in middle life, a spare upright figure, above the middle\r\nheight, with alert step, informal but not slovenly in dress, with no\r\nwhite tie or special mark of his profession. His head was one to attract\r\nnotice anywhere with the grand hawk-like nose, firm mouth, and flashing\r\neye. The deep lines furrowed between the brows gave his face an almost\r\nstern expression which his cheery conversation soon belied. He might be\r\ncarrying a fishing-rod or a bottle of medicine for a sick parishioner,\r\nor sometimes both: his faithful Dandie Dinmont would be in attendance\r\nand perhaps one of his children walking at his side. His walk would be\r\nswift and eager, with his eye wandering restlessly around to observe all\r\nthat he passed: 'it seemed as if no bird or beast or insect, scarcely a\r\ncloud in the sky, passed by him unnoticed, unwelcomed.' So too with\r\nhumanity--in breadth of sympathy he resembled 'the Shirra', who became\r\nknown to every wayfarer between Teviot and Tweed. Gipsy boy, farm-hand,\r\nold grandmother, each would be sure of a greeting and a few words of\r\ntalk when they met the Rector on his rounds. In society he might at\r\ntimes be too impetuous or insistent, when questions were stirred in\r\nwhich he was deeply interested. Tennyson tells us how he 'walked hard up\r\nand down the study for hours, smoking furiously and affirming that\r\ntobacco was the only thing that kept his nerves quiet'. Green compares\r\nhim to a restless animal, and Stopford Brooke speaks of his\r\nquick-rushing walk, his keen face like a sword, and his body thinned out\r\nto a lath, and complains that he 'often screams when he ought to speak'.\r\nBut this excitability was soothed by the country, and in his own parish\r\nhe was at his best. He would never have been so beloved by his\r\nparishioners, if they had not found him willing to listen as well as to\r\nadvise and to instruct.\r\n\r\nHis first venture into public life met with less general favour. The\r\nyear 1848 saw many upheavals in Europe. On the Continent thrones\r\ntottered and fell, republics started up for a moment and faded away. In\r\nEngland it was the year of the Chartist riots, and political and social\r\nproblems gave plenty of matter for thought. Monster meetings were held\r\nin London, which were not free from disorder. The wealthier classes and\r\nthe Government were alarmed, troops were brought up to London and the\r\nDuke of Wellington put in command. Events seemed to point to outbreaks\r\nof violence and the starting of a class-war. Frederick Denison Maurice,\r\nwhom above all men living Kingsley revered, was the leader of a group of\r\nmen who were greatly stirred by the movement. They saw that more than\r\npolitical reform and political charters were needed; and, while full of\r\nsympathy for the working classes, they were not minded to say smooth\r\nthings and prophesy Utopias in which they had no belief. Filled with the\r\ndesire to help his fellow-men, indignant at abuses which he had seen\r\nwith his own eyes, Kingsley came at once to their side. He went to\r\nLondon to see for himself, attended meetings, wrote pamphlets, and\r\nseemed to be promoting agitation. The tone in which he wrote can best be\r\nseen by a few words from the pamphlet addressed to the 'Workmen of\r\nEngland', which was posted up in London. 'The Charter is not bad, if the\r\nmen who use it are not bad. But will the Charter make you free? Will it\r\nfree you from slavery to ten-pound bribes? Slavery to gin and beer?\r\nSlavery to every spouter who flatters your self-conceit and stirs up\r\nbitterness and headlong rage in you? That I guess is real slavery, to be\r\na slave to one's own stomach, one's pocket, one's own temper.' This is\r\nhardly the tone of the agitator as known to us to-day. With his friends\r\nKingsley brought out a periodical, _Politics for the People_, in which\r\nhe wrote in the same tone. 'My only quarrel with the Charter is that it\r\ndoes not go far enough in reform.... I think you have fallen into the\r\nsame mistake as the rich of whom you complain, I mean the mistake of\r\nfancying that legislative reform is social reform, or that men's hearts\r\ncan be changed by Act of Parliament.' He did not limit himself to\r\ndenouncing such errors. He encouraged the working man to educate himself\r\nand to find rational pleasures in life, contributing papers on the\r\nNational Gallery and bringing out the human interest of the pictures.\r\n'Parson Lot', the _nom de guerre_ which Kingsley adopted, became widely\r\nknown for warm-hearted exhortations, for practical and sagacious\r\ncounsels.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he published _Alton Locke_, describing the life of a\r\nyoung tailor whose mind and whose fortunes are profoundly influenced by\r\nthe Chartist movement. From a literary point of view it is far from\r\nbeing his best work; and the critics agreed to belittle it at the time\r\nand to pass it over with apology at his death. But it received a warm\r\nwelcome from others. While it roused the imagination of many young men\r\nand set them thinking, the veteran Carlyle could speak of 'the snatches\r\nof excellent poetical description, occasional sunbursts of noble\r\ninsight, everywhere a certain wild intensity which holds the reader fast\r\nas by a spell'.\r\n\r\nShould any one ask why a rector of a country parish mixed himself up in\r\nLondon agitation, many answers could be given. His help was sought by\r\nMaurice, who worked among the London poor. Many of the questions at\r\nissue affected also the agricultural labourer. Only one who was giving\r\nhis life to serve the poor could effectively expose the mistakes of\r\ntheir champions. The upper classes, squires and merchants and\r\npoliticians, had shut their eyes and missed their chances. So when the\r\nship is on fire, no one blames the chaplain or the ship's doctor for\r\nlending a hand with the buckets.[32]\r\n\r\n[Note 32: See Preface by T. Hughes prefixed to later editions of\r\n_Alton Locke_.]\r\n\r\nThat his efforts in London met with success can be seen from many\r\nsources besides the popularity of _Alton Locke_. He wrote a pamphlet\r\nentitled 'Cheap Clothes and Nasty', denouncing the sweaters' shops and\r\nsupporting the co-operative movement, which was beginning to arise out\r\nof the ashes of Chartism. Of this pamphlet a friend told him that he saw\r\nthree copies on the table in the Guards' Club, and that he heard that\r\ncaptains in the Guards were going to the co-operative shop in Castle\r\nStreet and buying coats there. A success of a different kind and one\r\nmore valued by Kingsley himself was the conversion of Thomas Cooper, the\r\npopular writer in Socialist magazines, who preached atheistical\r\ndoctrines weekly to many thousand working men. Kingsley found him to be\r\nsincerely honest, spent infinite time in writing him friendly letters,\r\ndiscussing their differences of opinion, and some years later had the\r\njoy of inducing him to become an active preacher of the Gospel. But most\r\nof the well-to-do people, including the clergy, were prejudiced against\r\nKingsley by his Radical views. On one occasion he had to face a painful\r\nscene in a London church, when the vicar who had invited him to preach\r\nrose after the sermon and formally protested against the views to which\r\nhis congregation had been listening. Bishop Blomfield at first sided\r\nwith the vicar; but in the end he did full justice to the sincerity and\r\ncharity of Kingsley's views and sanctioned his continuing to preach in\r\nthe Diocese.\r\n\r\nIt was his literary successes which helped most to break down the\r\nprejudice existing against him in society. _Hypatia_, published in 1853,\r\nhad a mixed reception; but _Westward Ho!_ appearing two years later, was\r\nuniversally popular. His eloquence in the pulpit was becoming known to a\r\nwider circle, largely owing to officers who came over from Aldershot and\r\nSandhurst to hear him; and early in 1859 he was asked to preach before\r\nthe Queen and Prince Consort. His appointment as chaplain to the Queen\r\nfollowed before the year was out; and this made a great difference in\r\nhis position and prospects. What he valued equally was the hearty\r\nfriendship which he formed with the Prince Consort. They had the same\r\ntastes, the same interests, the same serious outlook on life. A year\r\nlater came a still higher distinction when Kingsley was appointed\r\nProfessor of Modern History at Cambridge. His history lectures, it is\r\ngenerally agreed, are not of permanent value as a contribution to the\r\nknowledge of the subject. With his parish work and other interests he\r\nhad no time for profound study. But his eloquence and descriptive powers\r\nwere such as to attract a large class of students, and many can still\r\nread with pleasure his lectures on _The Roman and the Teuton_, in which\r\nhe was fired by the moral lessons involved in the decay of the Roman\r\nempire and the coming of the vigorous young northern races. Apart from\r\nhis lectures he had made his mark in Cambridge by the friendly relations\r\nwhich he established with many of the undergraduates and the personal\r\ninfluence which he exercised. But he knew better than any one else his\r\nshortcomings as an historian, the preparation of his lectures gave him\r\ngreat anxiety and labour, and in 1869 he resigned the office.\r\n\r\nThe next honour which fell to him was a canonry at Chester, and in 1873,\r\nless than two years before his death, he exchanged it for a stall at\r\nWestminster. These historic cities with their old buildings and\r\nassociations attracted him very strongly: preaching in the Abbey was\r\neven dangerously exciting to a man of his temperament. But while he gave\r\nhis services generously during his months of office, as at Chester in\r\nfounding a Natural History Society, he never deserted his old work and\r\nhis old parish. Eversley continued to be his home, and during the\r\ngreater part of each year to engross his thoughts.\r\n\r\nLiterature, science, and sport were, as we have seen, the three\r\ninterests which absorbed his leisure hours. A fourth, partaking in some\r\nmeasure of all three, was travel, a hobby which the strenuous pursuit of\r\nduty rarely permitted him to indulge. Ill-health or a complete breakdown\r\nsometimes sent him away perforce, and it is to this that he chiefly owed\r\nhis knowledge of other climes. He has left us some fascinating pictures\r\nof the south of France, the rocks of Biarritz, the terrace at Pau, the\r\nblue waters of the Mediterranean, and the golden arches of the Pont du\r\nGard; but the voyages that thrilled him most were those that he took to\r\nAmerica, when he sailed the Spanish main in the track of Drake and\r\nRaleigh and Richard Grenville. The first journey in 1870 was to the West\r\nIndies; the second and longer one took him to New York and Quebec, and\r\nacross the continent to the Yosemite and San Francisco. This was in\r\n1874, the last year of his life, and he was received everywhere with the\r\nutmost respect and goodwill. His name was now famous on both sides of\r\nthe Atlantic, and the voice of opposition was stilled. The public had\r\nchanged its attitude to him, but he himself was unchanged. He had the\r\nsame readiness to gather up new knowledge, and to get into friendly\r\ntouch with every kind of man, the same reluctance to talk about himself.\r\nOnly the yearning towards the unseen was growing stronger. The poet\r\nWhittier, who met him at Boston, found him unwilling to talk about his\r\nown books or even about the new cities which he was visiting, but\r\nlonging for counsel from his brother poet on the high themes of a future\r\nlife and the final destiny of the human race.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in California he was taken ill with pleurisy; and when he\r\ncame back to England he had so serious a relapse in the autumn that he\r\ncould hardly perform his duties at Westminster. He had never wished for\r\nlong life, his strength was exhausted, the ardent soul had worn out its\r\nsheath. A dangerous illness of his wife's, threatening to leave him\r\nsolitary, hastened the end. For her sake he fought a while against the\r\npneumonia which set in, but the effort was in vain, and on January 23,\r\nin his own room at Eversley, he met his death contented and serene.\r\nTwenty years before he had said, 'God forgive me if I am wrong, but I\r\nlook forward to it with an intense and reverent curiosity'.\r\n\r\nThese words of his sum up some of his most marked characteristics. Of\r\nhis 'curiosity' there is no need to say more: all his life he was\r\npursuing eager researches into rocks, flowers, animals, and his\r\nfellow-men. 'Intensity' has been picked out by many of his friends as\r\nthe word which, more than any other, expresses the peculiar quality of\r\nhis nature. This does not mean a weak excitability. His letters to J. S.\r\nMill on the women-suffrage movement show that this hysterical element,\r\nwhich was often to be found in the women supporting it, was what most he\r\nfeared. He himself defines it well--'my blessed habit of intensity. I go\r\nat what I am about as if there was nothing else in the world for the\r\ntime being.' This quality, which many great men put into their work,\r\nKingsley put both into his work and into his play-time. Critics will say\r\nthat he paid for it: it is easy to quote the familiar line: 'Neque\r\nsemper arcum tendit Apollo.' But Horace is not the poet to whom Charles\r\nKingsley would go for counsel: he would only say that he got full value\r\nin both, and that he never regretted the bargain.\r\n\r\nBut it would be no less true to say that 'Reverence' is the key-note of\r\nhis character. This fact was impressed on all who saw him take the\r\nservices in his parish church, and it was an exaltation of reverence\r\nwhich uplifted his congregation and stamped itself on their memories. It\r\nis seen, too, in his political views. The Radical Parson, the upholder\r\nof Chartism, was in many ways a strong Tory. He had a great belief in\r\nthe land-owning classes, and an admiration for what remained of the\r\nFeudal System. He believed that the old relation between squire and\r\nvillagers, if each did his duty, worked far better than the modern\r\npretence of Equality and Independence. Like Disraeli, like Ruskin, and\r\nlike many other men of high imagination, he distrusted the Manchester\r\nSchool and the policy that in the labour market each class should be\r\nleft to fend for itself. Radical as he was, he defended the House of\r\nLords and the hereditary system. So, too, in Church questions, though he\r\nwas an anti-Tractarian, he had a great reverence for the Athanasian\r\nCreed and in general was a High Churchman. He had none of the fads which\r\nwe associate with the Radical party. Total abstinence he condemned as a\r\nrigid rule, though there was no man more severe in his attitude to\r\ndrunkenness. He believed that God's gifts were for man's enjoyment, and\r\nhe set his face against asceticism. He trained his own body to vigorous\r\nmanhood and he had remarkable self-control; and he wished to help each\r\nman to do this for himself and not to be driven to it by what he\r\nconsidered a false system. Logically it may be easy to find\r\ncontradictions in the views which he expressed at different times; but\r\nhis life shows an essential unity in aim and practice.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion to label Charles Kingsley and his teaching with\r\nthe nickname of 'Muscular Christianity', a name which he detested and\r\ndisclaimed. It implied that he and his school were of the full-blooded\r\nrobust order of men, who had no sympathy for weakness, and no message\r\nfor those who could not follow the same strenuous course as themselves.\r\nAs a fact Kingsley had his full share of bodily illnesses and suffered\r\nat all times from a highly-wrought nervous organization; when pain to\r\nothers was involved, he was as tender and sympathetic as a woman. He was\r\na born fighter, too reckless in attack, as we see in his famous dispute\r\nwith Cardinal Newman about the honesty of the Tractarians. But he was\r\nnot bitter or resentful. He owned himself that in this case he had met a\r\nbetter logician than himself: later he expressed his admiration for\r\nNewman's poem, 'The Dream of Gerontius', and in his letters he praises\r\nthe tone in which the Tractarians write--'a solemn and gentle\r\nearnestness which is most beautiful and which I wish I may ever attain'.\r\nThe point which Matthew Arnold singles out in estimating his character\r\nis the width of his sympathies. 'I think', he says, 'he was the most\r\ngenerous man I have ever known, the most forward to praise what he\r\nthought good, the most willing to admire, the most incapable of being\r\nmade ill-natured or even indifferent by having to support ill-natured\r\nattacks himself. Among men of letters I know nothing so rare as this.'\r\nTo the gibe about 'Muscular Christianity' Kingsley had his own answer.\r\nHe said that with his tastes and gifts he had a special power of\r\nappealing to the wild rough natures which were more at home in the\r\ncountry than the town, who were too self-forgetful, and too heedless of\r\nthe need for culture and for making use of their opportunities. Jacob,\r\nthe man of intellect, had many spiritual guides, and the poor outcast,\r\nEsau, was too often overlooked. As he said, 'The one idea of my life was\r\nto tell Esau that he has a birthright as well as Jacob'. When he was\r\nlaid to his rest in Eversley churchyard, there were many mourners who\r\nrepresented the cultured classes of the day; but what gave its special\r\ncharacter to the occasion was the presence of keepers and poachers, of\r\ngipsies, country rustics, and huntsmen, the Esaus of the Hampshire\r\nvillage, which was the fit resting-place for one who above all was the\r\nideal of a parish priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE FREDERICK WATTS\r\n\r\n1817-1904\r\n\r\n1817.

Reynolds and Gainsborough had died in the\r\nlast years of the eighteenth century, Romney and Hoppner in the first\r\ndecade of the nineteenth; Lawrence, the last of the Georgian\r\nportrait-painters, did not live beyond 1830. Of the landscapists Crome\r\ndied in 1821 and Constable in 1837. Turner, the one survivor of the\r\nGiants, had done three-quarters of his work before 1837 and can hardly\r\nbe reckoned as a Victorian worthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE FREDERICK WATTS\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by himself in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Victoria many thousands of trivial anecdotic\r\npictures were bought and sold, were reproduced in Art Annuals and\r\nChristmas Numbers and won the favour of rich amateurs and provincial\r\naldermen--so much so that Victorian art has been a favourite target for\r\nthe shafts of critics formed in the school of Whistler and the later\r\nImpressionists. But however just some of their strictures may be, it is\r\nfoolish to condemn an age wholesale or to shut our eyes to the great\r\nachievements of those artists who, rising above the general level,\r\ndignified the calling of the painter just when the painters were most\r\nrare. These men formed no single movement progressing in a uniform\r\ndirection. The study of pure landscape is best seen in the water-colour\r\ndraughtsmen, Cotman, Cox, and de Wint; of landscape as a setting for the\r\nlife of the people, in Fred Walker and George Mason. Among\r\nfigure-painters the 'Pre-Raphaelites', Rossetti, Holman Hunt, and\r\nMillais, with their forerunner Madox Brown, are the first to win\r\nattention by their earnestness, their romantic imagination, and their\r\nintense feeling for beauty: in these qualities Burne-Jones carried on\r\ntheir work and retained the allegiance of a cultured few to the very end\r\nof the century. Two solitary figures are more difficult to class, Alfred\r\nStevens and Watts. Each learnt fruitful lessons from prolonged study of\r\nthe great art of the past; yet each preserves a marked originality in\r\nhis work. More than any other artists of their age they realized the\r\nunity of art and the dependence of one branch upon another. Painting\r\nshould go hand in hand with sculpture, and both minister to\r\narchitecture. So the world might hope once more to see public buildings\r\nnobly planned and no less nobly decorated, as in the past it saw the\r\ncompletion of the Parthenon and the churches of mediaeval Italy. It was\r\nunfortunate that they received so little encouragement from the public,\r\nand that their example had so narrow an influence. St. Paul's can show\r\nits Wellington monument, Lincoln's Inn its fresco; but year after year\r\nsubject-pictures continued to be painted on an ambitious scale, which\r\nafter a few months' exhibition on the walls of Burlington House passed\r\nto their tomb in provincial museums, or reappeared as ghosts in the\r\nsale-room only to fetch a derisory price and to illustrate the fickle\r\nvagaries in the public taste.\r\n\r\nIn the early life of George Frederick Watts, who was born in a quiet\r\nstreet in West Marylebone, there are few incidents to narrate, there is\r\nlittle brightness to enliven the tale. His father, a maker of musical\r\ninstruments, was poor; his mother died early; his home-life was\r\novershadowed by his own ill-health and the uncertain moods of other\r\nmembers of the family. His education was casual and consisted mostly of\r\nreading books under the guidance of his father, who had little solid\r\nlearning, but refined tastes and an inventive disposition. In his\r\nSundays at home, where the Sabbatarian rule limited his reading, he\r\nbecame familiar with the stories of the Old Testament; he discovered for\r\nhimself the Waverley Novels and Pope's translation of the _Iliad_; and\r\nhe began from early years to use his pencil with the eager and\r\npersistent enthusiasm which marks the artist born.\r\n\r\nFor a rich artistic nature it was a starved life, but he made the most\r\nof such chances as came in his way. He was barely ten years old when he\r\nfound his way to the studio of a sculptor named William Behnes, a man\r\nof Hanoverian extraction, an indifferent sculptor but possessed of a\r\nreal talent for drawing; and from his more intellectual brother, Charles\r\nBehnes, he learnt to widen his interest in literature. In this halting\r\nand irregular process of education he received help, some years later,\r\nfrom another friend of foreign birth, Nicholas Wanostrocht, a Belgian,\r\nwho under the assumed name of 'Felix' became a leading authority on the\r\ngame of cricket. Wanostrocht was a cultivated man of very wide tastes,\r\nand it was largely through his encouragement that Watts gave to the\r\nstudy of the French and Italian languages, and to music, what little\r\ntime he could spare from his professional work. London was to render him\r\ngreater services than this. Thanks to his visits to the British Museum,\r\nhe had, while still in his teens, come under a mightier spell. Though\r\nfew Englishmen had yet learnt to value their treasures, the Elgin\r\nMarbles had been resting there for twenty years. But now, two years\r\nbefore Queen Victoria's accession, there might be seen, standing rapt in\r\nadmiration before the works of Phidias, a boy of slender figure with\r\nhigh forehead, delicately moulded features, and disordered hair, one\r\nwho, as we can see from the earliest portrait which Mrs. Watts has\r\npreserved in her biography, had something of the unearthly beauty of the\r\nyoung Shelley. He was physically frail, marked off from ordinary men by\r\na grace that won its way quickly to the hearts of all who were\r\nsusceptible to spiritual charm. Untaught though he was, he had the eye\r\nto see for himself the grandeur of these relics of Greece, and\r\nthroughout his life they remained one of the guiding influences in his\r\ndevelopment, one of the standards which he set up before himself, though\r\nall too conscious that he could not hope to reach that height. We see\r\ntheir influence in his treatment of drapery, of horses, of the human\r\nfigure, in his idealization of types, in the flowing lines of his\r\ncompositions, and in the grouping of his masses. Compared to the hours\r\nwhich he spent in the British Museum, the lessons in the Royal Academy\r\nschools seem unimportant. He attended classes there for some months in\r\n1835, but the teaching was poor and its results disappointing. William\r\nHilton, R.A., who then occupied the post of Keeper, gave him some kind\r\nwords of encouragement, but in general he came and went unnoticed, and\r\nhe soon returned to his solitary self-training in his own studio. If we\r\nknow little of his teaching in art, we know still less of his personal\r\nlife during the time when he was laying the foundations of his success\r\nby study and self-discipline. Early rising was an art which he acquired\r\nearly, and maintained throughout life; long after he felt the spur of\r\nnecessity, even after the age of 80, he could rise at four when there\r\nwas work to be done; and, living as he did on the simplest diet, he\r\noften achieved his best results at an hour when other men were still\r\nfinishing their slumbers. His shyness and sensitiveness, combined with\r\nprecarious health and weak physique, would seem to equip him but poorly\r\nin the struggle for life; but his steady persistence, his high\r\nconception of duty, his faith in his art, joined to that power which he\r\nhad of winning friends among the noblest men and women of his day, were\r\nto carry him triumphantly through to the end.\r\n\r\nThe career of Watts as a public man began in 1843 when he had reached\r\nthe age of 26. The British Government, not often guilty of fostering art\r\nor literature, may claim at least the credit for having drawn him out of\r\nhis seclusion at the very moment when his genius was ripening to bear\r\nfruit. In 1834 the Palace of Westminster, so long the home of the Houses\r\nof Parliament, had been burnt to the ground. The present buildings were\r\nbegun by Sir Charles Barry in 1840, and, with a view to decorating them\r\nwith wall-paintings, the Board of Works wisely offered prizes for\r\ncartoons, hoping thereby to attract the best talent of the country. In\r\nJune 1843 they had to judge between 140 designs by various competitors,\r\nand to award prizes varying in value from £300 to £100. Of the three\r\nfirst prizes one fell to Watts, hitherto unknown beyond the narrow\r\ncircle of his friends, for a design displaying 'Caractacus led in\r\ntriumph through the streets of Rome'. This cartoon, however, was not\r\nemployed for its original purpose: it fell into the hands of an\r\nenterprising, if inartistic, dealer, who cut it up and sold such\r\nfragments as he judged to be of value in the state of the picture market\r\nat the time. What was far more important was the encouragement given to\r\nthe artist by such a success at a critical time of his life, and the\r\nopportunity which the money furnished him to travel abroad and enrich\r\nhis experiences before his style was formed. He had long wished to visit\r\nItaly; and, after spending a few weeks in France, he made his leisurely\r\nway (at a pace incredible to us to-day) to Florence and its picture\r\ngalleries. On the steamer between Marseilles and Leghorn he was\r\nfortunate in making friends with a Colonel Ellice and his wife, and a\r\nfew weeks later they introduced him to Lord Holland, the British\r\nMinister at Florence.\r\n\r\nThe story goes that Watts went to be the guest of Lord and Lady Holland\r\nfor four days and remained there for four years--a story which is a\r\ntribute to the discernment of the latter and not a satire upon Watts,\r\nwho was the last man in the world to take advantage of hospitality or to\r\nthrust himself into other people's houses. No doubt it is not to be\r\ntaken too literally, but at least it is so far true that he very quickly\r\nbecame intimate with his host and hostess and found a home where he\r\ncould pursue his art under ideal conditions. The value and the danger of\r\npatronage have been often discussed. Democracy may provide a discipline\r\nfor artists and men of letters which is often salutary in testing the\r\nsincerity of their devotion to art and literature; but, in such a stern\r\nschool, men of genius may easily founder and miss their way.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, Watts found just the haven which was needed for a\r\nnature like his. So far he had known but little appreciation, and had\r\nlived with few who were his peers. Now he was cheered by the favour of\r\nmen and women who had known the best and whose favour was well worth the\r\nwinning. But he kept his independence of spirit. He lived in a palace,\r\nbut his diet was as sparing as that of a hermit. He feasted his eyes on\r\nthe great works of the Renaissance, but he preserved his originality,\r\nand continued to work, with fervour and enhanced enthusiasm, on the\r\nlines which he had already marked out for himself. He did not copy with\r\nthe hand, but he drank in new lessons with the eyes and dreamed new\r\ndreams with the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Hollands had two houses, one in the centre of the city, the other,\r\nthe Villa Medicea di Careggi, lying on the edge of the hills some two or\r\nthree miles to the north. This latter had been a favourite residence of\r\nthe first Cosimo; here Lorenzo had died, turning his face to the wall,\r\nunshriven by Savonarola; and here Watts decorated an open _loggia_ in\r\nfresco, to bear witness to its latest connexion with the patronage of\r\nArt. Between the two houses he passed laborious but tranquil days,\r\nstudying, planning, training his hand to mastery, but enjoying in his\r\nleisure all that such a home could give him of varied entertainment.\r\nMusic and dancing, literature and good company, all had their charms for\r\nhim, though none of them could beguile him into neglecting his work.\r\nFortune had tried him with her frowns and with her smiles; under\r\ntemptations of both sorts he remained but more faithful to his calling.\r\n\r\nHis health gave cause for anxiety from time to time, but he delighted in\r\nthe sunshine and the genial climate of the South, and in general he was\r\nwell enough to enjoy what Florence could give him of beautiful form and\r\ncolour, and even to travel farther afield. One year he pushed as far as\r\nNaples, stopping on the way for a hurried glance at Rome. On this\r\nmemorable day the Sistine chapel and its paintings were kept to the\r\nlast; and Watts, high though his expectations were, was overwhelmed at\r\nwhat he saw. 'Michelangelo', he said, 'stands for Italy, as Shakespeare\r\ndoes for England.' So the four years went by till in 1847 this halcyon\r\nperiod came to an end. The Royal Commission of Fine Arts was offering\r\nprizes for fresco-painting, and Watts felt that he must put his growing\r\npowers to the test and utilize what he had learnt. This time he chose\r\nfor his subject 'Alfred inciting the English to resist the Danes by\r\nsea'. He was busy at work in the early months of 1847 making many\r\nsketches in pencil for the figures, and by April he was on his way home,\r\nbringing with him the 'Alfred' almost finished and five other canvases\r\nin various stages of completion. The picture was placed in Westminster\r\nHall for competition in June, and soon after he was announced to be the\r\nwinner of one of the three £500 prizes. When the Commissioners decided\r\nto purchase his picture for the nation, he refused to take more than\r\n£200 for it, though he might easily have obtained a far higher price.\r\nThis is one of the earliest instances in which he displayed that signal\r\ngenerosity which marked his whole career.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three years his life was rather desultory. He was hoping\r\nto return to Italy and did not find it easy to settle down in London. He\r\nchanged his studio two or three times. He planned various works, but\r\nfelt chilled at the absence of any clear encouragement from new patrons\r\nor from the general public. His success in 1847 had not been followed\r\nby any commissions for the sort of work he loved: interest in the\r\ndecoration of public buildings was still spasmodic and too rare.\r\n\r\nHe made the acquaintance of Mr. Ruskin; but, friendly though they were\r\nin their personal relations, they did not see eye to eye in artistic\r\nmatters. Ruskin seemed to lay too much emphasis on points of secondary\r\nimportance, and to fail in judging the work of Michelangelo and the\r\ngreatest masters. So Watts thought, and many years later, in\r\nconversation with Jowett, declared, chary though he was of criticizing\r\nhis friends. To-day there is little doubt whose judgement was the truer,\r\neven had Ruskin not weakened his position by so often contradicting\r\nhimself. Besides Ruskin, Watts was beginning to make other friends, and\r\nwas a member of the Cosmopolitan Club, which counted among its members\r\nSir Robert Morier, Sir Henry Layard, FitzGerald, Palgrave, and Spedding.\r\nThe large painting of the 'Story from Boccaccio', which now hangs in the\r\nWatts room of the Tate Gallery, hung for many years on the walls of this\r\nclub and was presented to the nation in 1902. How frequently Watts\r\nattended the club or other social gatherings at this time we do not\r\nknow. His name figures little in the biographies and memoirs of\r\nLondoners, and he himself would not have wished the record of his daily\r\nlife to be preserved. His modesty in all personal matters is\r\nuncontested, and even if his subsequent offer of his pictures to the\r\nnation smacks somewhat of presumption, his motive was something other\r\nthan conceit. His portraits were an historical record of the worthiest\r\nmen of his own time: his allegories were of value, so he felt, not for\r\ntheir technical accomplishments, but for the high moral lessons which\r\nthey tried to convey. The artist himself was at ease only in retirement\r\nand privacy. Yet complete isolation was not good for him. Ill-health\r\nstill dogged his steps, and the dejection which came over him in the\r\nyears 1849 and 1850 is to be seen in the gloomiest pictures which he\r\never painted. Their titles and subjects alike recall the more tragic\r\npoems of Thomas Hood. But the eclipse was not to last for long, and in\r\n1850 Watts owed his recovery to a happy chance encounter with friends\r\nwho were to give him a new haven of refuge and gladden his life for\r\nthirty years to come.\r\n\r\nA high Indian official, James Pattle, had been the father of five\r\ndaughters who were famous for their beauty, and from their tastes and\r\ncharacter were particularly fitted to be the friends of artists and\r\npoets. If Lady Somers was the most beautiful of the sisters and Mrs.\r\nCameron the most artistic, their elder sister Mrs. Prinsep proved to be\r\nWatts's surest friend. Her husband, Thoby Prinsep, was a member of the\r\nIndia Council in Whitehall, a large-hearted man, full of knowledge and\r\nfull of kindliness. Mrs. Prinsep herself was mistress of the domestic\r\narts in no common degree, from skilful cookery to the holding of a\r\nliterary _salon_. She and her husband realized what friendship could do\r\nfor a nature like that of Watts, and they provided him with an ideal\r\nhome, where he was nursed back to health, relieved of care, and cheered\r\nby constant sympathy and affection. It was Watts who discovered this\r\nhome for them in a quiet corner of London, that has not yet lost all its\r\ncharm. Behind Holland House and adjoining its park was a smaller\r\nproperty with a rambling old-fashioned house, built in the days when\r\nLondon was still far away. At Little Holland House the Prinseps lived\r\nfor a quarter of a century. Here the sisters came and went freely with\r\ntheir children who were growing up around them. Here were gatherings of\r\ntheir friends, among whom Tennyson, Thackeray, Rossetti, and Burne-Jones\r\nmight be met from time to time; and here Watts remained a constant\r\ninmate, giving regular hours to his work, enjoying their society in his\r\nleisure, a special favourite with the children, who admitted him to\r\ntheir confidence and called him by pet names. There was no lionizing, no\r\nstriving after brilliance; all work that was genuine and of high\r\nintention received due honour, and Watts could hope here to carry to\r\nfruition the noble visions which he had seen since the days of his\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nThese visions had little to do with the exhibitions of Burlington House,\r\nthe winning of titles, or the acquisition of worldly wealth. Watts\r\ncherished the old Greek conception of willing service to the community.\r\nAnd he was alive to the special needs of an age when men were struggling\r\nfor gain, and when 'progress' was measured by material riches. To him,\r\nif to few others, it seemed tragic that, in the wonderful development of\r\nindustrial Britain, art, which had spoken so eloquently to citizens of\r\nPericlean Athens and to Florence in the Medicean age, should remain\r\nwithout expression or sign of life. For a moment our Government had\r\nseemed to hear the call, and the stimulus of the Westminster\r\ncompetitions had been of value; but the interest died away all too\r\nquickly, and the attention of the general public was never fully roused.\r\nIf the latter could be won, Watts was only too willing to give the time\r\nand the knowledge which he had acquired. The building of the great\r\nrailway stations in London seemed to offer a chance, and Watts\r\napproached the directors of the North Western Company with a humble\r\npetition. All that he asked for was wall space and the payment of his\r\nexpenses in material. Had his request been granted, Euston might have\r\nenjoyed pre-eminence among railway stations, and passengers for the\r\nnorth might have passed through, or waited in, a National Gallery of\r\ntheir own. But the Railway Director's mind is slow to move; inventions\r\nleave him cold, and imagination is not to be weighed in the scale\r\nagainst dividends and quick returns. The Company declined the offer on\r\nthe ground of expense, while their architect is said to have been\r\nseriously alarmed at the idea of any one tampering with his building.\r\n\r\nAnother proposal met with a heartier response. The men of law proved\r\nmore generous than the men of commerce. The new Hall at Lincoln's Inn\r\nwas being built by Mr. Philip Hardwick, in the Tudor style. Benchers and\r\narchitect alike cordially welcomed Watts's offer to decorate a blank\r\nwall with fresco. The work could only be carried on during the legal\r\nvacations, and it proved a long business owing to the difficulties of\r\nthe process and to the interruptions caused by the artist's ill-health.\r\nWatts planned it in 1852, began work in 1853, and did not put the\r\nfinishing touch till 1859. The subject was a group of famous lawgivers,\r\nin which the chief figures were Moses, Mahomet, Justinian, Charlemagne,\r\nand Alfred, and it stands to-day as the chief witness to his powers as a\r\ndesigner on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nBefore this he had already dedicated to national service his gift of\r\nportrait-painting. The head of Lord John Russell, painted in 1851, is\r\none of the earliest portraits known to have been painted with this\r\nintention, though it is impossible to fix with accuracy the date when\r\nsuch a scheme took shape. In 1899, with the same patriotic intention, he\r\nwas at work on a painting of Cecil Rhodes. In this half-century of\r\nactivity he might have made large sums of money, if he had responded to\r\nthe urgent demands of those men and women who were willing to pay high\r\nprices for the privilege of sitting to him; but few of them attained\r\ntheir object. His earlier achievements were limited to a few families\r\nfrom whom he had received help and encouragement when he was unknown.\r\nFirst among these to be remembered are the various generations of that\r\nfamily whose name is still preserved at South Kensington in the Ionides\r\ncollection of pictures. Next came the Hollands, of whom he painted many\r\nportraits at Florence; and a third circle, naturally enough, was that\r\nof the Prinseps. In general he was most unwilling to undertake, as a\r\nmere matter of business, commissions from individuals unknown to him. He\r\nfound portrait-painting most exhausting in its demands upon him. He\r\nthrew his whole soul into the work, straining to see and to reproduce\r\nall that was most noble in his sitters. His nervous temperament made him\r\nanxious at starting, while his high standard of excellence made him\r\noften dissatisfied with what he had accomplished. Even when he was\r\npainting Tennyson, a personal friend, he was miserable at the thought of\r\nthe responsibility which he had undertaken; and in 1879 he gave up a\r\ncommission to paint Gladstone, feeling that he was not realizing his\r\naim. So far as mere money was concerned, he would have preferred to\r\nleave this branch of his profession, the most lucrative of all, perhaps\r\nthe most suited to his gifts, severely on one side, and to confine\r\nhimself to the allegorical subjects which he felt to be independent of\r\nexternal claims.\r\n\r\nIn the years after 1850, when he was first living at Little Holland\r\nHouse, Watts formed some of the friendships with brother artists which\r\nadded so much pleasure to his life. Foremost among these friends was\r\nFrederic Leighton, the most famous President whom the Royal Academy has\r\nknown since the days of Reynolds, a man of many accomplishments,\r\nlinguist, orator, and organizer, as well as sculptor and painter, the\r\nvery variety of whose gifts have perhaps prevented him from obtaining\r\nproper recognition for the things which he did really well. The worldly\r\nsuccess which he won brought him under the fire of criticism as no other\r\nartist of the time; but, apart from his merits as a draughtsman and a\r\nsculptor he was a man of singularly generous temper, a staunch friend\r\nand a champion of good causes. These qualities, and his sincere\r\nadmiration for all noble work, endeared him to Watts; and, at one time,\r\nLeighton paid daily visits to his studio to exchange views and to see\r\nhis friend's work in progress.\r\n\r\nFor a while Rossetti frequented the circle, but this wayward spirit\r\ndrifted into other paths, and the chief service which he did to Watts\r\nwas to introduce to him Edward Burne-Jones, most refined of artists and\r\nmost lovable of men. The latter's work commanded Watts's highest\r\nadmiration, and his friendship was valued to the end. To many lovers of\r\npainting these two remain the embodiment of all that is purest and\r\nloftiest in Victorian art; and though their treatment of classic\r\nsubjects and of allegory were so different their pictures were often\r\nhung side by side in exhibitions and their names were coupled together\r\nin the current talk of the time. Burne-Jones was markedly Celtic in his\r\nlove of beautiful pattern, in the ghostly refinement of his figures, in\r\nthe elaborate fancifulness of his imagery. Watts had more of the\r\nfull-blooded Englishman in his nature, and his art was simpler, grander,\r\nmore universal. If we may compare them with the great men of the\r\nRenaissance, Burne-Jones recalled the grace of Botticelli, Watts the\r\nrichness and power of Veronese or of Titian.\r\n\r\nThose who went to Little Holland House and saw the circle of the\r\nPrinseps adorned by these artists, and by such writers as Tennyson,\r\nHenry Taylor,[33] and Thackeray, had a singular impression of harmony\r\nbetween the men and their surroundings; and if they had been asked who\r\nbest expressed the spirit of these gatherings, they would probably have\r\npointed to the 'Signor', as Watts came to be called among his intimate\r\nfriends--to the slight figure with the small delicately-shaped head, who\r\nseemed to recall the atmosphere of Florence in the Middle Ages, when art\r\nwas at once a craft and a religion. But few who saw the grace and\r\nold-fashioned courtesy with which he moved among young and old would\r\nhave guessed what fire and persistency were in him, that he would\r\noutlive all his generation, and be still wielding a vigorous brush in\r\nthe early years of the century to come.\r\n\r\n[Note 33: Sir Henry Taylor, author of _Philip van Artevelde_ and\r\nother poems, and a high official of the Colonial Office.]\r\n\r\nOne interlude in this busy yet tranquil life came in 1856 when he was\r\nasked to accompany Sir Charles Newton's party to the coast of Asia\r\nMinor. Newton was to explore the ruins of Halicarnassus on behalf of the\r\nBritish Government, and a man-of-war was placed at his disposal. The\r\nopportunity of seeing Grecian lands in this leisurely fashion was too\r\ngood to be missed, and Watts spent eight happy months on board. He\r\nshowed his power of adapting himself to a new situation, made friends\r\nwith the sailors, and sang 'Tom Bowling' at their Christmas concert.\r\nIncidentally he visited Constantinople, as it was necessary to get a\r\n'firman' from the Porte, was commended to the famous ambassador Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe and painted two portraits of him, one of which is\r\nin the National Portrait Gallery to-day. He also enjoyed a cruise\r\nthrough the Greek Islands, where the scenery with its rich colour and\r\nbold pure outlines was specially calculated to charm him. He painted few\r\nlandscapes in his long career, but both in Italy and in Greece it was\r\nthe distant views of mountain peaks that led him to give expression to\r\nhis delight in the beauty of Nature.\r\n\r\nA different kind of distraction was obtained after his return by\r\noccasional visits to Esher, where he was the guest of Mrs. Sanderson,\r\nsister of Mr. Prinsep, and where he spent many a happy day riding to\r\nhounds. For games he had no training, and little inclination, though he\r\nloved in his old age to watch and encourage the village cricket in\r\nSurrey; but riding gave him great pleasure. His love for the horse may\r\nin part be due to this pastime, in part to his early study of the\r\nParthenon frieze with its famous procession of horsemen. Certainly this\r\nanimal plays a notable part in his work. Two great equestrian statues\r\noccupied him for many years. 'Hugh Lupus', the ancestor of the\r\nGrosvenors, was cast in bronze in 1884 and set up at Eaton Hall in the\r\nDuke of Westminster's park. 'Physical Energy' was the name given to a\r\nsimilar figure conceived on broader and more ideal lines. At this Watts\r\ncontinued to work till the year of his death, though he parted with the\r\nfirst version in response to Lord Grey's appeal when it was wanted to\r\nadorn the monument to Cecil Rhodes. Its original destination was the\r\ntomb in the Matoppo hills; but it was proved impracticable to convey\r\nsuch a colossal work, without injury, over the rough country surrounding\r\nthem; and it was set up at Cape Town. The statue has become better known\r\nto the English public since a second version has been set up in\r\nKensington Gardens. The rider, bestriding a powerful horse, has flung\r\nhimself back and is gazing eagerly into the distance, shading with\r\nuplifted hand his eyes against the fierce sunlight which dazzles them.\r\nThe allegory is not hard to interpret, though the tame landscape of a\r\nLondon park frames it less fitly than a wide stretch of wild and\r\nsolitary veld.\r\n\r\nHorses of many different kinds figure in his pictures. In one, whose\r\nsubject is taken from the Apocalypse, we see the war-horse, his neck\r\n'clothed with thunder'; in another his head is bowed, the lines\r\nharmonizing with the mood of his master, Sir Galahad. 'The Midday Rest',\r\nunheroic in theme but grand in treatment, shows us two massive dray\r\nhorses, which were lent to him as models by Messrs. Barclay and Perkins,\r\nwhile 'A patient life of unrewarded toil' renders sympathetically the\r\nweakness of the veteran discharged after years of service, waiting\r\npatiently for the end. One instance of a more imaginative kind shows us\r\n'Neptune's Horses' as the painter dimly discerned them, with arched\r\nnecks and flowing manes, rising and leaping in the crest of the wave.\r\n\r\nHis portraits of great men generally took the form of half-lengths with\r\nthe simplest backgrounds. His subjects were of all kinds--Tennyson and\r\nBrowning, Rossetti and Burne-Jones, Gladstone, Mill, Motley, Joachim,\r\nThiers, and Anthony Panizzi.[34] His object was a national one, and the\r\nforeigners admitted to the company were usually closely connected with\r\nEngland. Sometimes the pose of the body and the hands helps the\r\nconception, as in Lord Lytton and Cardinal Manning; more often Watts\r\ntrusts to the simple mass of the head or to the character revealed by\r\nthe features in repose. No finer examples for contrast can be given than\r\nthe portraits of the two friends, Burne-Jones and William Morris,\r\npainted in 1870. In the former we see the spirit of the dreamer, in the\r\nlatter the splendid vitality and force of the craftsman, who was\r\nimpetuous in action as he was rich in invention. The room at the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery where this collection is hung speaks\r\neloquently to us of the Victorian Age and the varied genius of its\r\ngreatest men; and in some cases we have the additional interest of being\r\nable to compare portraits of the same men painted by Watts and by other\r\nartists. Well known is the contrast in the case of Carlyle. Millais has\r\npainted a picturesque old man whose talk might be racy and his temper\r\nuncertain; but the soul of the seer, tormented by conflicts and yet\r\nclinging to an inner faith, is revealed only by the hands of Watts.\r\nAgain Millais gives us the noble features, the extravagant 'hure'[35] of\r\nthe Tennyson whom his contemporaries saw, alive, glowing with force;\r\nWatts has exalted this conception to a higher level and has portrayed\r\nthe thinker whom the world will honour many centuries hence. Some will\r\nperhaps prefer the more objective treatment; and it is certain that\r\nWatts's ambition led him into difficult paths. Striving to represent the\r\nsoul of his sitter, he was conscious at times that he failed--that he\r\ncould not see or realize what he was searching for. More than once he\r\nabandoned a commission when he felt this uncertainty in himself. But\r\nwhen the accord between artist and sitter was perfect, he achieved a\r\ntriumph of idealization, combined with a firm grasp on reality, such as\r\nfew artists since Giorgione and the young Titian have been able to\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n[Note 34: Sir Anthony Panizzi, an Italian political refugee, the\r\nmost famous of librarians. He served the British Museum from 1831 to\r\n1866.]\r\n\r\n[Note 35: '\"Hure: tête hérissée et en désordre\"; se dit d'un homme\r\nqui a les cheveux mal peignés, d'un animal, &c.'--Littré.]\r\n\r\nApart from portraits there was a rich variety in the subjects which the\r\npainter handled, some drawn from Bible stories, some from Greek legends\r\nor mediaeval tales, some for which we can find no source save in his own\r\nimagination. He dealt with the myths in a way natural to a man who owed\r\nmore to Greek art and to his own musings than to the close study of\r\nGreek literature. His pictures of the infancy of Jupiter, of the\r\ndeserted Ariadne, of the tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice, have no\r\nelaborate realism in detail. The Royal Academy walls showed, in those\r\ndays, plenty of marble halls, theatres, temples, and classic groves,\r\nreproduced with soulless pedantry. Watts gave us heroic figures, with\r\nstrong masses and flowing lines, simply grouped and charged with\r\nemotion--the yearning love of Diana for Endymion, the patient\r\nresignation of Ariadne, the passionate regret of Orpheus, the cruel\r\nbestiality of the Minotaur. Some will find a deeper interest, a grander\r\nstyle, in the designs which he made for the story of our first parents\r\nin the Book of Genesis. Remorse has rarely been expressed so powerfully\r\nas in the averted figure of Eve after the Fall, or of Cain bowed under\r\nthe curse, shut out from contact with all creation. In one of his\r\nmasterpieces Watts drew his motive from the Gospel story. The picture\r\nentitled 'For he had great possessions' shows us the young ruler who has\r\ncome to Christ and has failed in the supreme moment. His back, his bowed\r\nneck and averted head, with the gesture of indecision in his right hand,\r\ntell their tale with consummate eloquence.\r\n\r\nIn his more famous allegories the same is true; by simple means an\r\nimpression of great power is conveyed. The popularity of 'Love and\r\nDeath' and its companion picture shows how little the allegory needs\r\nexplanation. These themes were first handled between 1860 and 1870; but\r\nthe pictures roused such widespread admiration that the painter made\r\nseveral replicas of them. Versions are now to be found in the Dominions\r\nand in New York, as well as in London and Manchester. Photographs have\r\nextended their renown and they are so familiar to-day that there is no\r\nneed to describe them. Another masterpiece dealing with the subject of\r\nDeath is the 'Sic transit', where the shrouded figure of the dead\r\nwarrior is impressive in its solemnity and stillness. 'Dawn' and 'Hope'\r\nshow what different notes Watts could strike in his treatment of the\r\nfemale form. At the other extreme is 'Mammon', the sordid power which\r\npreys on life and crushes his victims with the weight of his relentless\r\nhand. The power of conscience is shown in a more mystic figure called\r\n'The Dweller in the Innermost'. Judgement figures in more than one\r\nnotable design, the most familiar being that which now hangs in St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral with the title of 'Time, Death, and Judgement'. Its\r\nposition there shows how little we can draw the line between the\r\ndifferent classes of subjects as they were handled by Watts. A courtier\r\nlike Rubens could, after painting with gusto a rout of Satyrs, put on a\r\ncloak of decorum to suit the pageantry of a court, or even simulate\r\nfervour to portray the ecstasy of a saint. He is clearly acting a part,\r\nbut in Watts the character of the man is always seen. Whether his\r\nsubjects are drawn from the Bible or from pagan myths, they are all\r\ntreated in the same temper of reverence and purity.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid the question of didactic art in writing of\r\nthese pictures, though such a wide question, debated for half a century,\r\ncan receive no adequate treatment here. We must frankly allow that Watts\r\nwas 'preaching sermons in paint', nor would he have repudiated the\r\ncharge, however loud to-day are the protests of those who preach the\r\ndoctrine of 'art for art's sake'. But the latter, while stating many\r\nprinciples of which the British public need to be reminded, seem to go\r\nbeyond their rights. It is, of course, permissible for students of art\r\nto object to technical points of handling--Watts himself was among the\r\nfirst to deplore his own failures due to want of executive ability; it\r\nis open to them to debate the part which morality may have in art, and\r\nto express their preference for those artists who handle all subjects\r\nimpartially and conceive all to be worthy of treatment, if truth of\r\ndrawing or lighting be achieved. But when they make Watts's ethical\r\nintention the reason for depreciating him as an artist they are on more\r\nuncertain ground. There is no final authority in these questions. Ruskin\r\nwas too dogmatic in the middle years of his life and only provoked a\r\nmore violent reaction. Twenty years later the admirers of Whistler and\r\nManet were equally intolerant, and assumed doctrines which may hold the\r\nfield to-day but are certain to be questioned to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWatts was most reluctant to enter into controversy and had no ambition\r\nto found a school; in fact so far was he from imposing his views on\r\nothers, that he scarcely ever took pupils, and was content to urge young\r\nartists to follow their own line and to be sincere. But he could at\r\ntimes be drawn into putting some of his views on paper, and in 1893 he\r\nwrote down a statement of the relative importance which he attached to\r\nthe qualities which make a painter. Among these Imagination stands\r\nfirst, Intellectual idea next to it. After this follow Dignity of form,\r\nHarmony of lines, and Colour. Finally, in the sixth place comes Realism,\r\nthe idol of so many of the end of the century, both in literature and\r\nart.\r\n\r\nSome years earlier, in meeting criticism, Watts had said, 'I admit my\r\nwant of dexterity with the brush, in some cases a very serious defect,'\r\nbut at the same time he refused to accept the authority of those 'who\r\ndeny that art should have any intellectual intention'. In general, he\r\npleaded that art has a very wide range over subject and treatment; but\r\nhe did not set himself up as a reformer in art, nor inflict dogmas on\r\nthe public gratuitously. He found that some of his more abstract themes\r\nneeded handling in shadowy and suggestive fashion: if this gave the\r\nimpression of fumbling, or displayed some weakness in technique, even so\r\nperhaps the conception reaches us in a way that could not be attained by\r\ndexterity of brushwork. As he himself said, 'there were things that\r\ncould only be done in art at the sacrifice of some other things'; but\r\nthe points which Watts was ready to sacrifice are what the realists\r\nconceive to be indispensable, and his aims were not as theirs. But his\r\nlife was very little troubled by controversy; and he would not have\r\nwished his own work to be a subject for it.\r\n\r\nExternal circumstances also had little power to alter the even tenor of\r\nhis way. Late in life, at the age of 69, he married Miss Fraser Tytler,\r\na friend of some fifteen years' standing, who was herself an artist, and\r\nwho shared all his tastes. After the marriage he and his wife spent a\r\nlong winter in the East, sailing up the Nile in leisurely fashion,\r\nenjoying the monuments of ancient Egypt and the colours of the desert.\r\nIt was a time of great happiness, and was followed by seventeen years\r\nof a serene old age, divided between his London house in Melbury Road\r\nand his new home in Surrey. Staying with friends in Surrey, Watts had\r\nmade acquaintance with the beautiful country lying south of the Hog's\r\nBack; and in 1889 he chose a site at Compton, where he decided to build\r\na house. To this he gave the name of Limnerslease. Thanks to the\r\ngenerosity of Mrs. Watts, who has built a gallery and hung some of his\r\nchoicest pictures there, Compton has become one of the three shrines to\r\nwhich lovers of his work resort.[36]\r\n\r\n[Note 36: His allegorical subjects are in the Tate Gallery; his\r\nportraits in the National Portrait Gallery.]\r\n\r\nBut for many years he met with little recognition from the world at\r\nlarge. It was only at the age of 50 that he received official honours\r\nfrom the Royal Academy, though the success of his cartoons had marked\r\nhim out among his contemporaries twenty-five years earlier. About 1865\r\nhis pictures won the enthusiastic admiration of Mr. Charles Rickards,\r\nwho continued to be the most constant of his patrons, and gave to his\r\nadmiration the most practical form. Not only did he purchase from year\r\nto year such pictures as Watts was willing to sell, but twenty years\r\nlater he organized an exhibition of Watts's work at Manchester, which\r\ndid much to spread his fame in the North. In London Watts came to his\r\nown more fully when the Grosvenor Gallery was opened in 1877. Here the\r\nDirectors were at pains to attract the best painters of the day and to\r\nhang their pictures in such a way that their artistic qualities had full\r\neffect. No one gained more from this than Watts and Burne-Jones; and to\r\na select but growing circle of admirers the interest of the annual\r\nexhibitions began and ended with the work of these two kindred spirits.\r\nThe Directors also arranged in 1881 for a special exhibition devoted to\r\nthe works of Watts alone, when, thanks to the generosity of lenders, 200\r\nof his pictures did justice to his sixty years of unwearied effort.\r\nThis winter established his fame, and England now recognized him as one\r\nof her greatest sons. But when his friends tried to organize a dinner to\r\nbe held at the Gallery in his honour, he got wind of the plot, and with\r\nhis usual fastidious reserve begged to be spared such an ordeal. The\r\n_élite_ of London society, men famous in politics, literature, and other\r\ndepartments of public life, were only too anxious to honour him; but he\r\ncould not endure to be the centre of public attention. To him art was\r\neverything, the artist nothing. Throughout his life he attended few\r\nbanquets, mounted fewer platforms, and only wished to be left to enjoy\r\nhis work, his leisure, and the society of his intimate friends.\r\n\r\nHis interest in the progress of his age was profound, though it did not\r\noften take shape in visible form. He believed that the world might be\r\nbetter, and was not minded to acquiesce in the established order of\r\nthings. He sympathized with the Salvation Army; he was a strong\r\nsupporter of women's education; he was ardent for redressing the balance\r\nof riches and poverty, and for recognizing the heroism of those who,\r\nlabouring under such grim disadvantages, yet played a heroic part in\r\nlife. The latter he showed in practical form. In 1887 he had wished to\r\ncelebrate the Queen's Jubilee by erecting a shrine in which to preserve\r\nthe records of acts of self-sacrifice performed by the humblest members\r\nof the community. The scheme failed at the time to win support; but in\r\n1899, largely through his help, a memorial building arose in the\r\nchurchyard of St. Botolph, near Aldersgate, better known as the\r\n'Postmen's Park'.\r\n\r\nIn private life his kindliness and courtesy won the hearts of all who\r\ncame near him, young and old, rich and poor. He was tolerant towards\r\nthose who differed from him in opinion: he steadily believed the best of\r\nother men in passing judgement on them. No mean thought, no malicious\r\nword, no petty quarrel marred the purity of his life. He had lost his\r\nbest friends: Leighton in 1896, Burne-Jones three years later; but he\r\nenjoyed the devotion of his wife and the tranquillity of his home. Twice\r\nhe refused the offer of a Baronetcy. The only honour which he accepted\r\nwas the Order of Merit, which carried no title in society and was\r\nreserved for intellectual eminence and public service. At the age of 80\r\nhe presented to Eton College his picture of Sir Galahad, a fit emblem of\r\nhis own lifelong quest. His last days of active work were spent on the\r\nsecond version of the great statue of 'Physical Energy', which had\r\noccupied him so long, and in which he ever found something new to\r\nexpress as he dreamed of the days to come and the future conquests of\r\nmankind. In 1904 his strength gradually failed him, and on July 1 he\r\ndied in his Surrey home. Like his great exemplar Titian, whom he\r\nresembled in outward appearance and in much of the quality of his\r\npainting, he outlived his own generation and was yet learning, as one of\r\nthe young, when death took him in the 88th year of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN COLERIDGE PATTESON\r\n\r\n1827-71\r\n\r\n1827.

From this it was saved in 1840 by the\r\nforesight and energy of Gibbon Wakefield, who forced the hand of our\r\nreluctant Government; and its steady progress was secured by the\r\nsagacity of Sir George Grey, one of our greatest empire-builders in\r\nAustralia, South Africa, and New Zealand. Thanks to them and to others,\r\nthere has arisen in the Southern Pacific a state which, more than any\r\nother, seems to resemble the mother country with its sea-girt islands,\r\nits temperate climate, its mountains and its plains. A population almost\r\nentirely British, living in these conditions, might be expected to\r\nrepeat the history of their ancestors. In politics and social questions\r\nits sons show the same independence of spirit and even greater\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN COLERIDGE PATTESON\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by William Richmond]\r\n\r\nThe names of two other men deserve recognition here for the part they\r\nplayed in the history of these islands. In 1814, before they became a\r\nBritish possession, Samuel Marsden came from Australia to carry the\r\nGospel to their inhabitants, and formed settlements in the Northern\r\ndistricts, in days when the lives of settlers were in constant peril\r\nfrom the Maoris. But nothing could daunt his courage; and whenever they\r\ncame into personal contact with him, these childlike savages felt his\r\npower and responded to his influence, and he was able to lay a good\r\nfoundation. In 1841 the English Church sent out George Augustus Selwyn\r\nas first Missionary Bishop of New Zealand, giving him a wide province\r\nand no less wide discretion. He was the pioneer who, from his base in\r\nNew Zealand, was to spread Christian and British influences even farther\r\nafield in the vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nSelwyn was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, and these\r\nfamous foundations have never sent forth a man better fitted to render\r\nservices to his country. In a small sphere, as curate of Windsor, he had\r\nalready, by his energy, patience, and practical sagacity, achieved\r\nremarkable results; and it was providential that, in the strength of\r\nearly manhood, he was selected for a responsible post which afforded\r\nscope for the exercise of his powers. In the old country he might have\r\nbeen hampered by routine and tradition; in a new land he could mark out\r\nhis own path. The constitution of the New Zealand Church became a model\r\nfor other dioceses and other lands, and his wisdom has stood the test of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of man he was can best be shown by quoting a story from his\r\nbiography.[37] When the Maori War broke out he joined the troops as\r\nchaplain and shared their perils in the field. Against the enterprising\r\nnative fighters these were not slight, especially as the British troops\r\nwere few and badly led. He was travelling without escort over routes\r\ninfested by Maoris, refusing to have any special care taken of his own\r\nperson, and his chief security lay in rapid motion. Yet twice he\r\ndismounted on the way, at peril of his life, once under an impulse of\r\nhumanity, once from sheer public spirit. The first time it was to pull\r\ninto the shade a drunken soldier asleep on duty and in danger of\r\nsunstroke; the second to fill up the ruts in a sandy road, where it\r\nseemed possible that the transport wagons which were following might be\r\nupset. Many other incidents could be quoted which show his\r\nunconventional ways and his habitual disregard for his own comfort,\r\ndignity, or safety. In New Zealand he found plenty of people to\r\nappreciate these qualities in a bishop.\r\n\r\n[Note 37: _Life and Episcopate of G. A. Selwyn_, by H. W. Tucker, 2\r\nvols. (Wells Gardner, 1879).]\r\n\r\nThough Selwyn was the master and perhaps the greater man, yet a peculiar\r\nfame has attached to his disciple John Coleridge Patteson, owing to the\r\nsweetness of his disposition, the singleness of his aim, and the\r\nconsummation of his work by a martyr's death. Born in London in 1827, he\r\nwas more truly a son of Devon, to which he was attached by many links.\r\nHis mother's brother, Justice Coleridge, and many other relatives, lived\r\nclose round the old town of Ottery St. Mary; and his father, an able\r\nlawyer who was raised to the Bench in 1830, bought an estate at Feniton\r\nand came to live in the same district before the boy was fifteen years\r\nold. It was at Ottery, where the name of Coleridge was so familiar,\r\nthat the earliest school-days of 'Coley' Patteson were passed; but\r\nbefore he was eleven years old he was sent to the boarding-house of\r\nanother Coleridge, his uncle, who was a master at Eton. Here he spent\r\nseven happy years working in rather desultory fashion, so that he had\r\nhis share of success and failure. His chief distinctions were won at\r\ncricket, where he rose to be captain of the XI; but with all whose good\r\nopinion was worth having he won favour by his cheerful, frank,\r\nindependent spirit. If he was idle at one time, at another he could\r\ndevelop plenty of energy; if he was one of the most popular boys in the\r\nschool, he was not afraid to risk his popularity by protesting strongly\r\nagainst moral laxity or abuses which others tolerated. It is well to\r\nremember this, which is attested by his school-fellows, when reading his\r\nletters, in which at times he blames himself for caring too much for the\r\ngood opinion of others.\r\n\r\nHis interest in the distant seas where he was to win fame was first\r\naroused in 1841. Bishop Selwyn was a friend of his family, and coming to\r\nsay good-bye to the Pattesons before sailing for New Zealand, he said,\r\nhalf sportively, to the boy's mother, 'Will you give me \"Coley\"?' This\r\nidea was not pursued at the time; but the name of Selwyn was kept before\r\nhim in his school-days, as the Bishop had left many friends at Eton and\r\nWindsor, and Edward Coleridge employed his nephew to copy out Selwyn's\r\nletters from his diocese in order to enlist the sympathy of a wider\r\naudience. But this connexion dropped out of sight for many years and\r\nseems to have had little influence on Patteson's life at Oxford, where\r\nhe spent four years at Balliol. He went up in 1845 as a commoner, and\r\nthis fact caused him some disquietude. He felt that he ought to have won\r\na scholarship, and, conscious of his failure, he took to more steady\r\nreading. He was also practising self-discipline, giving up his cricket\r\nto secure more hours for study. He did not scorn the game. He was as\r\nfond as ever of Eton, and of his school memories. But his life was\r\nshaping in another direction, and the new interests, deepening in\r\nstrength, inevitably crowded out the old.\r\n\r\nAfter taking his degree he made a tour of the great cities of Italy and\r\nwrote enthusiastically of the famous pictures in her galleries. He also\r\npaid more than one visit to Germany, and when he had gained a fair\r\nknowledge of the German language, he went on to the more difficult task\r\nof learning Hebrew and Arabic. This pursuit was due partly to his\r\ngrowing interest in Biblical study, partly to the delight he took in his\r\nown linguistic powers. He had an ear of great delicacy; he caught up\r\nsounds as by instinct; and his retentive memory fixed the impression.\r\nLater he applied the reasoning of the philologist, classified and\r\ntabulated his results, and thus was able, when drawn into fields\r\nunexplored by science, to do original work and to produce results of\r\ngreat value to other students. But he was not the man to make a display\r\nof his power; in fact he apologizes, when writing to his father from\r\nDresden, for making a secret of his pursuit, regarding it rather as a\r\nmatter of self-indulgence which needed excuse. Bishop Selwyn could have\r\ntold him that he need have no such fears, and that in developing his\r\nlinguistic gifts he was going exactly the right way to fit himself for\r\nservice in Melanesia.\r\n\r\nPatteson's appointment to a fellowship at Merton College, which involved\r\nresidence in Oxford for a year, brought no great change into his life.\r\nRather he used what leisure he had for strengthening his knowledge of\r\nthe subjects which seemed to him to matter, especially the\r\ninterpretation of the Bible. He returned to Greek and Latin, which he\r\nhad neglected at school, and found a new interest in them. History and\r\ngeography filled up what time he could spare from his chief studies.\r\nResuming his cricket for a while, he mixed in the life of the\r\nundergraduates and made friends among them. At College meetings, for all\r\nhis innate conservatism, he found himself on the side of the reformers\r\nin questions affecting the University; but he had not time to make his\r\ninfluence felt. At the end of the year he was ordained and took a curacy\r\nat Alphington, a hamlet between Feniton and Ottery. His mother had died\r\nin 1842, and his object was to be near his father, who was growing\r\ninfirm and found his chief pleasure in 'Coley's' presence and talk. His\r\ninterest in foreign missions was alive again, but at this time his first\r\nduty seemed to be to his family; and in a parish endeared to him by old\r\nassociations he quickly won the affection of his flock. He was happy in\r\nthe work and his parishioners hoped to keep him for many years; but this\r\nwas not to be. In 1854 Bishop Selwyn and his wife were in England\r\npleading for support for their Church, and their visit to Feniton\r\nbrought matters to a crisis. Patteson was thrilled at the idea of seeing\r\nhis hero again, and he at once seized the opportunity for serving under\r\nhim. There was no need for the Bishop to urge him; rather he had to\r\nassure himself that he could fairly accept the offer. To the young man\r\nthere was no thought of sacrifice; that fell to the father's lot, and he\r\nbore it nobly. His first words to the Bishop were, 'I can't let him go';\r\nbut a moment later he repented and cried, 'God forbid that I should stop\r\nhim'; and at parting he faced the consequences unflinchingly. 'Mind!' he\r\nsaid, 'I give him wholly, not with any thought of seeing him again.'\r\n\r\nIn the following March, the young curate, leaving his home and his\r\nparish where he was almost idolized, where he was never to be seen\r\nagain, set his face towards the South Seas. Once the offer had been made\r\nand accepted, he felt no more excitement. It was not the spiritual\r\nexaltation of a moment, but a deliberate applying of the lessons which\r\nhe had been learning year by year. He had put his hand to the plough and\r\nwould not look back.\r\n\r\nThe first things which he set himself to learn, on board ship, were the\r\nMaori language and the art of navigation. The first he studied with a\r\nnative teacher, the second he learnt from the Bishop, and he proved an\r\napt pupil in both. In a few months he became qualified to act as master\r\nof the Mission ship, and the speaking of a new language was to him only\r\na matter of weeks. His earliest letters show how quickly he came to\r\nunderstand the natives. He was ready to meet any and every demand made\r\nupon him, and to fulfil duties as different from one another as those of\r\nteacher, skipper, and storekeeper. His head-quarters, during his early\r\nmonths in New Zealand, were either on board ship or else at St. John's\r\nCollege, five miles from Auckland. But, before he had completed a year,\r\nhe was called to accompany the Bishop on his tour to the Islands and to\r\nmake acquaintance with the scene of his future labours.\r\n\r\nBishop Selwyn had wisely limited his mission to those islands which the\r\nGospel had not reached. The counsels of St. Paul and his own sagacity\r\nwarned him against exposing his Church to the danger of jealous rivalry.\r\nSo long as Christ was preached in an island or group of islands, he was\r\ncontent; he would leave them to the ministry of those who were first in\r\nthe field. Many of the Polynesian groups had been visited by French and\r\nEnglish missionaries and stations had been established in Samoa, Tahiti,\r\nand elsewhere; but north of New Zealand there was a large tract of the\r\nPacific, including the New Hebrides and the Solomon Islands, where the\r\nnatives had never heard the Gospel message. These groups were known\r\ncollectively as Melanesia, a name hardly justified by facts,[38] as the\r\ninhabitants were by no means uniform in colour. If the Solomon\r\nIslanders had almost black skins, those who lived in the Banks Islands,\r\nwhich Patteson came to know so well, were of a warm brown hue such as\r\nmay be seen in India or even in the south of Europe. Writing in the very\r\nlast month of his life, Patteson tells his sisters how the colour of the\r\npeople in Mota 'is just what Titian and the Venetian painters delighted\r\nin, the colour of their own weather-beaten boatmen'.\r\n\r\n[Note 38: Melanesia, from Greek [Greek: melas]=black, [Greek:\r\nnêsos]=island.]\r\n\r\nSelwyn had visited these islands intermittently since 1849, and had\r\nthought out a plan for spreading Christianity among them. With only a\r\nsmall staff of helpers and many other demands on his time, he could not\r\nhope to get into direct contact with a large population, so widely\r\nscattered. His work must be done through natives selected by himself,\r\nand these must be trained while they were young and open to impressions,\r\nwhile their character was still in the making. So every year he brought\r\nback with him from his cruise a certain number of Melanesian boys to\r\nspend the warmer months of the New Zealand year under the charge of the\r\nmissionaries, and restored them to their homes at the beginning of the\r\nnext cruise. At Auckland, with its soldiers, sailors, and merchants, the\r\nboys became familiar with other sides of European life beyond the walls\r\nof the Mission School; and their interest was stimulated by a close view\r\nof the strength to be drawn from European civilization. By this system\r\nSelwyn hoped that they on their return would spread among the islanders\r\na certain knowledge of European ways, and that their relatives, seeing\r\nhow the boys had been kindly treated, would feel confidence in the\r\nmissionaries and would give them a hearing. This policy commended itself\r\nto Patteson by its practical efficacy; and though he modified it in\r\ndetails, he remained all his life a convinced adherent of the principle.\r\nSlow progress through a few pupils, selected when young, and carefully\r\ntaught, was worth more than mere numbers, though too often in\r\nMissionary reports success is gauged by figures and statistics.\r\n\r\nThese cruises furnished the adventurous part of the life. Readers of\r\nStevenson and Conrad can picture to themselves to-day the colour, the\r\nmystery, and the magic of the South Seas. Patteson, with his reserved\r\nnature and his dread of seeming to throw a false glamour over his\r\npractical duties, wrote but sparingly of such sights; but he was by no\r\nmeans insensitive to natural beauty and his letters give glimpses of\r\ncoral reefs and lagoons, of palms and coco-nut trees, of creepers 100\r\nfeet long trailing over lofty crags to the clear water below.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed being on board ship, with his books at hand and some leisure\r\nto read them, with the Bishop at his side to counsel him, and generally\r\nsome of his pupils to need his help. They had many delightful days when\r\nthey received friendly greeting on the islands and found that they were\r\nmaking real progress among the natives. But the elements of discomfort,\r\ndisappointment, and danger were rarely absent for long. For a large part\r\nof each voyage they had some forty or fifty Melanesian boys on board, on\r\ntheir way to school or returning to their homes. The schooner built for\r\nthe purpose was as airy and convenient as it could be made; yet there\r\nwas little space for privacy. The natives were constitutionally weak;\r\nand when illness broke out, no trained nurses were at hand and Patteson\r\nwould give up his own quarters to the sick and spend hours at their\r\nbedsides. Sometimes they found, on revisiting an island, that their old\r\nscholars had fallen away and that they had to begin again from the\r\nstart. Sometimes they had to abstain from landing at all, because the\r\nbehaviour of the natives was menacing, or because news had reached the\r\nMission of some recent quarrel which had roused bitter feeling. The\r\ntraditions of the Melanesians inclined them to go on the war-path only\r\ntoo readily, and both Selwyn and Patteson had an instinctive perception\r\nof the native temperament and its danger.\r\n\r\nHowever lightly Patteson might treat these perils in his letters home,\r\nthere was never complete security. To reassure his sisters he tells them\r\nof 81 landings and only two arrows fired at them in one cruise; and yet\r\none poisoned arrow might be the cause of death accompanied by\r\nindescribable agony. Even when a landing had been effected and friendly\r\ntrading and talk had given confidence to the visitors, it might be that\r\nan arrow was discharged at them by some irresponsible native as they\r\nmade for their boats.\r\n\r\nThese voyages needed unconventional qualities in the missioner; few of\r\nthe subscribers in quiet English parishes had an idea how the Melanesian\r\nislanders made their first acquaintance with their Bishop. When the boat\r\ncame near the shore, the Bishop, arrayed in some of his oldest clothes,\r\nwould jump into the sea and swim to land, sometimes being roughly\r\nhandled by the breakers which guarded the coral bank. It was desirable\r\nnot to expose their precious boat to the cupidity of the natives or to\r\nthe risk of it being dashed to pieces in the surf, so the Bishop risked\r\nhis own person instead. He would then with all possible coolness walk\r\ninto a gathering of savages, catch up any familiar words which seemed to\r\noccur in the new dialect, or, failing any linguistic help, try to convey\r\nhis peaceful intentions by gesture or facial expression. When an island\r\nhad been visited before, there was less reason to be on guard; but\r\nsometimes the Bishop had to break to relatives the sad news that one of\r\nthe boys committed to his care had fallen a victim to the more rigorous\r\nclimate of New Zealand or to one of the diseases to which these tribes\r\nwere so liable. Then it was only the personal ascendancy won by previous\r\nvisits that could secure him against a violent impulse to revenge.\r\n\r\nAll practical measures were tried to establish friendly relations with\r\nthe islanders; and when people at home might fancy the Bishop preaching\r\nimpressively to a decorous circle of listeners, he was really engaged in\r\nlively talk and barter, receiving yams and other articles of food in\r\nreturn for the produce of Birmingham and Sheffield, axe-heads which he\r\npresented to the old, and fish-hooks with which he won the favour of the\r\nyoung. But such brief visits as could be made at a score of islands in a\r\nbusy tour did not carry matters far, and the memory of a visit would be\r\ngrowing dim before another chance came of renewing intercourse with the\r\nsame tribe. Selwyn felt it was most desirable that he should have\r\nsufficient staff to leave a missionary here and there to spend unbroken\r\nwinter months in a single station, where he could reach more of the\r\npeople and exercise a more continuous influence upon them. Patteson's\r\nfirst experience of this was in 1858, when he spent three months at Lifu\r\nin the Loyalty Islands, a group which was later to be annexed by the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nA sojourn which was to bear more permanent fruit was that which he made\r\nat Mota in 1860. This was one of the Banks Islands lying north of the\r\nNew Hebrides, in 14° South Latitude. The inhabitants of this group\r\nshowed unusual capacity for learning from the missionaries, and\r\nsufficient stability of character to promise lasting success for the\r\nwork carried on among them. Mota, owing to the line of cliffs which\r\nformed its coast, was a difficult place for landing; so it escaped the\r\nvisits of white traders who could not emulate the swimming feats of\r\nSelwyn and Patteson, and was free from many of the troubles which such\r\nvisitors brought with them. Once the island was reached, it proved to be\r\none of the most attractive, with rich soil, plenty of water, and a\r\nkindly docile population. Here, on a site duly purchased for the\r\nmission, under the shade of a gigantic banyan tree, on a slope where\r\nbread-fruit and coco-nuts (and, later, pine-apples and other\r\nimportations) flourished, the first habitation was built, with a boarded\r\nfloor, walls of bamboo canes, and a roof of coco-nut leaves woven\r\ntogether after the native fashion so as to be waterproof. Here, in the\r\nnext ten years, Patteson was to spend many happy weeks, taking school,\r\nreading and writing when the curiosity of the natives left him any\r\npeace, but in general patiently conversing with all and sundry who came\r\nup, with the twofold object of gathering knowledge of their dialect and\r\nmaking friends with individuals. While he showed instinctive tact in\r\nknowing how far it was wise to go in opposing the native way of life, he\r\nwas willing to face risks whenever real progress could be made. After he\r\nhad been some days in Mota a special initiation in a degrading rite was\r\nheld outside the village. Patteson exercised all his influence to\r\nprevent one of his converts from being drawn in; and when an old man\r\ncame up and terrorized his pupils by planting a symbolic tree outside\r\nthe Mission hut, Patteson argued with him at length and persuaded him to\r\nwithdraw his threatening symbol. But apart from idolatry, from\r\ninternecine warfare, and from such horrors as cannibalism, prevalent in\r\nmany islands, he was studious not to attack old traditions. He wanted a\r\ngood Melanesian standard of conduct, not a feeble imitation of European\r\nculture. He was prepared to build upon the foundation which time had\r\nalready prepared and not to invert the order of nature.\r\n\r\nIn writing home of his life in the island Patteson regularly depreciates\r\nhis own hardships, saying how unworthy he feels himself to be ranked\r\nwith the pioneers in African work. But the discomforts must often have\r\nbeen considerable to a man naturally fastidious and brought up as he had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nFood was most monotonous. Meat was out of the question except where the\r\nmissioners themselves imported live stock and kept a farm of their own;\r\nvariety of fruit depended also on their own exertions. The staple diet\r\nwas the yam, a tuber reaching at times in good soil a weight far in\r\nexcess of the potato. This was supplied readily by the natives in return\r\nfor European goods, and could be cooked in different ways; but after\r\nmany weeks' sojourn it was apt to pall. Also the climate was relaxing,\r\nand apt sooner or later to tell injuriously on Europeans working there.\r\nDirt, disease, and danger can be faced cheerfully when a man is in good\r\nhealth himself; but a solitary European suffering from ill-health in\r\nsuch conditions is indeed put to an heroic test. Perhaps the greatest\r\ndiscomfort of all was the perpetual living in public. The natives became\r\nso fond of Patteson that they flocked round him at all times. His\r\nreading was interrupted by a stream of questions; when writing he would\r\nfind boys standing close to his elbow, following his every movement with\r\nattention. The mere writing of letters seems to have been a relief to\r\nhim, though they could not be answered for so long. His journal, into\r\nwhich he poured freely all his hopes and fears, all his daily anxieties\r\nover the Mission, was destined for his family. But he had other\r\ncorrespondents to whom he wrote more or less regularly, especially at\r\nEton and Winchester. At Eton his uncle was one of his most ardent\r\nsupporters and much of the money which supported the Mission funds came\r\nto Patteson through the Eton Association. Near Winchester was living his\r\ncousin Charlotte Yonge, the well-known authoress, who afterwards wrote\r\nhis Life, and through her he established friendly communications with\r\nKeble at Hursley and Bishop Moberly, then Head Master of Winchester\r\nCollege. To them he could write sympathetically of Church questions at\r\nhome, in which he maintained his interest.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months also, spent near Auckland, Patteson suffered\r\nfrom the want of privacy. At Kohimarana, a small bay facing the entrance\r\nto the harbour, to which the school was moved in 1859, he had a tiny\r\nroom of his own, ten feet square; but the door stood open all day long\r\nin fine weather, and he was seldom alone. And when there was sickness\r\namong the boys, his own bedroom was sure to be given up to an invalid.\r\nBut these demands upon his time and comfort he never grudged, while he\r\ntalks with vexation, and even with asperity, of the people from the town\r\nwho came out to pay calls and to satisfy their curiosity with a sight of\r\nhis school. His real friends were few and were partners in his work. The\r\ntwo chief among them were unquestionably Bishop Selwyn, too rarely seen\r\nowing to the many claims upon him, and Sir Richard Martin, who had been\r\nChief Justice of the Colony. The latter shared Patteson's taste for\r\nphilology, and had a wide knowledge of Melanesian dialects.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of 1860, when Patteson had been five years at work, he\r\nbecame aware that the question of his consecration could not be long\r\ndelayed. New Zealand was taxing the Primate's strength and he wished to\r\nconstitute Melanesia a separate diocese. He believed that in Patteson,\r\nwith his single-minded zeal and special gifts, he had found the ideal\r\nman for the post, and in February 1861 the consecration took place. The\r\nthree bishops who laid hands upon him were, like the Bishop-elect,\r\nEtonians;[39] and thus Eton has played a very special part in founding\r\nthe Melanesian Church. What Patteson thought and felt on this solemn\r\noccasion may be seen from the letters which he wrote to his father. The\r\nold judge, still living with his daughters at Feniton, had been stricken\r\nwith a fatal disease, and in the last months of his life he rejoiced to\r\nknow that his son was counted worthy of his high calling. He died in\r\nJune 1861 and the news reached his son when cruising at sea a few months\r\nlater. They had kept up a close correspondence all these years, which he\r\nnow continued with his sisters; nothing shows better his simple\r\naffectionate nature. They are filled mostly with details of his mission\r\nlife. It was this of which his sisters wanted to hear, and it was this\r\nwhich filled almost entirely his thoughts: though he loved his family\r\nand his home, he had put aside all idea of a voyage to England as\r\nincompatible with the call to work. To the Mission he gave his time, his\r\nstrength, his money. Eton supplied him with regular subscriptions,\r\nAustralia responded to appeals which he made in person and which\r\nfurnished the only occasions of his leaving the diocese; but, without\r\nhis devotion of the income coming from his Merton fellowship and from\r\nhis family inheritance, it would have been impossible for him to carry\r\non the work in the islands.\r\n\r\n[Note 39: Bishop Selwyn (Primate), Bishop Abraham of Wellington, and\r\nBishop Hobhouse of Nelson.]\r\n\r\nIn his letters written just about the time of his consecration there are\r\nabundant references to the qualities which he desired to see in\r\nEnglishmen who should offer to serve with him. He did not want young men\r\ncarried away by violent excitement for the moment, eager to make what\r\nthey called the sacrifice of their lives. The conventional phrases about\r\n'sacrifices' he disliked as much as he did the sensational appeals to\r\nwhich the public had been habituated in missionary meetings. He asked\r\nfor men of common sense, men who would take trouble over learning\r\nlanguages, men cheerful and healthy in their outlook, 'gentlemen' who\r\ncould rise above distinctions of class and colour and treat Melanesians\r\nas they treated their own friends. Above all, he wanted men who would\r\nwhole-heartedly accept the system devised by Selwyn, and approved by\r\nhimself. He could not have the harmony of the Mission upset by people\r\nwho were eager to originate methods before they had served their\r\napprenticeship. If he could not get the right recruits from England, he\r\nsays more than once, he would rather depend on the materials existing\r\non the spot: young men from New Zealand would adapt themselves better to\r\nthe life and he himself would try to remedy any defects in their\r\neducation. Ultimately he hoped that by careful education and training he\r\nwould draw his most efficient help from his converts in the islands, and\r\nto train them he spared no pains through the remaining ten years of his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nHis way of life was not greatly altered by his consecration. He\r\ncontinued to divide his year between New Zealand and his ocean cruise.\r\nHe had no body of clergy to space out over his vast diocese or to meet\r\nthe urgent demands of the islands. In 1863 he received two valuable\r\nrecruits--one the Rev. R. Codrington, a Fellow of Wadham College,\r\nOxford, who shared the Bishop's literary tastes and proved a valued\r\ncounsellor; the other a naval man, Lieut. Tilly, who volunteered to take\r\ncharge of the new schooner called the _Southern Cross_, just sent out to\r\nhim from England. Till then his staff consisted of three men in holy\r\norders and two younger men who were to be ordained later. One of these,\r\nJoseph Atkin, a native of Auckland, proved himself of unique value to\r\nthe Mission before he was called to share his leader's death. But the\r\nBishop still took upon himself the most dangerous work, the landing at\r\nvillages where the English were unknown or where the goodwill of the\r\nnatives seemed to be doubtful. This he accepted as a matter of course,\r\nremarking casually in his letters that the others are not good enough\r\nswimmers to take his place. But caution was necessary long after the\r\ntime when friendship had begun. In the interval between visits anything\r\nmight have happened to render the natives suspicious or revengeful; and\r\nit is evident that, month after month, the Bishop carried his life in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nThe secret of his power can be found in his letters, which are quite\r\nfree from heroics. His religion was based on faith, simple and sincere;\r\nand he never hesitated to put it into practice. From the Bible, and\r\nespecially from the New Testament, he learned the central lessons, the\r\nlove of God and the love of man. Nothing was allowed to come between him\r\nand his duty; and to it he devoted the faculties which he had trained.\r\nHis instinct often stood him in good stead, bidding him to practise\r\ncaution and to keep at a distance from treacherous snares; but there\r\nwere times when he felt that, to advance his work, he must show absolute\r\nconfidence in the natives whatever he suspected, and move freely among\r\nthem. In such cases he seemed to rise superior to all nervousness or\r\nfear. At one time he would find his path back to the boat cut off by\r\nnatives who did not themselves know whether they intended violence or\r\nnot. At another he would sit quietly alone in a circle of gigantic\r\nTikopians, some of whom, as he writes, were clutching at his 'little\r\nweak arms and shoulders'. 'Yet it is not', he continued, 'a sense of\r\nfear, but simply of powerlessness.' No amount of experience could render\r\nhim safe when he was perpetually trying to open new fields for mission\r\nwork and when his converts themselves were so liable to unaccountable\r\nwaves of feeling.\r\n\r\nThis was proved by his terrible experience at Santa Cruz. He had visited\r\nthese islands (which lie north of the New Hebrides) successfully in\r\n1862, landing at seven places and seeing over a thousand natives, and he\r\nhad no reason to expect a different reception when he revisited it in\r\n1864. But on this occasion, after he had swum to land three times and\r\nwalked freely to and fro among the people, a crowd came down to the\r\nwater and began shooting at those in the boat from fifteen yards away,\r\nwhile others attacked in canoes. Before the boat could be pulled out of\r\nreach, three of its occupants were hit with poisoned arrows, and a few\r\ndays later two of them showed signs of tetanus, which was almost\r\ninvariably the result of such wounds. They were young natives of\r\nNorfolk Island, for whom the Bishop had conceived a special affection,\r\nand their deaths, which were painful to witness, were a very bitter\r\ngrief to him. The reason for the attack remained unknown. The traditions\r\nof Melanesia in the matter of blood-feuds were like those of most savage\r\nnations; and under the spur of fear or revenge the islanders were\r\ncapable of directing their anger blindly against their truest friends.\r\n\r\nThe most notable development in the first year of Patteson's episcopate\r\nwas the forming of a solid centre of work in the Banks Islands. Every\r\nyear, while the Mission ship was cruising, some member of the Mission,\r\noften the Bishop himself, would be working steadily in Mota for a\r\nsuccession of months. For visitors there was not much to see. At the\r\nbeginning, hours were given up to desultory talking with the natives,\r\nbut perseverance was rewarded. Those who came to talk would return to\r\ntake lessons, and some impression was gradually made even on the older\r\nmen attached to their idolatrous rites. Many years after Patteson's\r\ndeath it was still the most civilized of the islands with a population\r\nalmost entirely Christian.\r\n\r\nA greater change was effected in 1867 when the Bishop boldly cut adrift\r\nfrom New Zealand and made his base for summer work at Norfolk Island,\r\nlying 800 miles north-east of Sydney.[40] The advantages which it\r\npossessed over Auckland were two. Firstly, it was so many hundred miles\r\nnearer the centre of the Mission work; secondly, it had a climate much\r\nmore akin to that of the Melanesian islands and it would be possible to\r\nkeep pupils here for a longer spell without running such risks to their\r\nhealth. Another point, which to many would seem a drawback, but to\r\nPatteson was an additional advantage, was the absence of all\r\ndistraction. At Auckland the clergy implored him to preach, society\r\nimportuned him to take part in its gatherings; and if he would not come\r\nto the town, they pursued him to his retreat. He was always busy and\r\ngrudged the loss of his time. A contemporary tells us that he worked\r\nfrom 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. and later; and besides his philological\r\ninterests, he needed time for his own study of the Bible. In the former\r\nhe was a pioneer and had to mark out his own path; in the latter he\r\nwelcomed the guidance of the best scholars whenever he could procure\r\ntheir books. He spoke with delight of his first acquaintance with\r\nLightfoot's edition of St. Paul's Epistles; he wrote home for such new\r\nbooks as would be useful to him, and he read Hebrew daily whenever he\r\ncould find time. Into this part of his life he put more conscientious\r\neffort the older he grew, and was always trying to learn. It may have\r\nseemed to many a dull routine to be followed year after year by a man\r\nwho might have filled high place and moved in brilliant society at home;\r\nbut from his letters it is clear that he was satisfied with his life and\r\nthat no thought of regret assailed him.\r\n\r\n[Note 40: This island had lately been colonized by settlers from\r\nPitcairn Island, descended from the mutineers of the _Bounty_, marooned\r\nin 1789.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1868 brought a severe loss when Bishop Selwyn was called home\r\nto take charge of the Diocese of Lichfield. It was he who had drawn\r\nPatteson to the South Seas: his presence had been an abiding strength to\r\nthe younger man, however rare their meetings; and Patteson felt his\r\ndeparture as he had felt nothing since his father's death. But he went\r\non unfalteringly with his work, ever ready to look hopefully into the\r\nfuture. At the moment he was intensely interested in the ordination of\r\nhis first native clergyman, George Sarawia, who had now been a pupil for\r\nnine years and had shown sufficient progress in knowledge and strength\r\nof character to justify the step. Eager though he was to enrol helpers\r\nfor the work, Patteson was scrupulously careful to ensure the fitness of\r\nhis clergy, and to lay hands hastily on no man. In little matters also\r\nhe was careful and methodical. His scholars in Norfolk Island were\r\nexpected to be punctual, his helpers to be content with the simple life\r\nwhich contented him. All were to give their work freely; between black\r\nand white there was to be equality; no service was to be considered\r\ndegrading. He did not wish to hurry his converts into outward observance\r\nof European ways. More important than the wearing of clothes was the\r\ntrue respect for the sanctity of marriage; far above the question of\r\nSunday observance was the teaching of the love of God.\r\n\r\nForeign missions have come in for plenty of criticism. It is sometimes\r\nsaid that our missionaries have occasioned strife leading to\r\nintervention and annexation by the British Government, and have exposed\r\nus abroad to the charge of covetousness and hypocrisy. But there are few\r\ninstances in which this charge can be maintained, least of all in\r\nAustralasian waters. A more serious charge, often made in India, is that\r\nmissioners destroy the sanctions of morality by undermining the\r\ntraditional beliefs of the natives, and that the convert is neither a\r\ngood Asiatic nor a passable European. This depends on the methods\r\nemployed. It may be true in some cases. Patteson fully realized the\r\ndanger, as we can see from his words, and built carefully on the\r\nfoundation of native character. He took away no stone till he could\r\nreplace it by better material. He was never content merely to destroy.\r\n\r\nAnother set of critics are roused by the extravagance of some missionary\r\nmeetings and societies: their taste is offended or (we are bound to\r\nadmit) their sense of humour roused. It was time for Dickens to wield\r\nthis weapon when he heard Chadbands pouring forth their oily platitudes\r\nand saw Mrs. Jellybys neglecting their own children to clothe the\r\noffspring of 'Borrioboola Gha'. Such folly caught the critic's eye when\r\nthe steady benevolence of others, unnoticed, was effecting work which\r\nhad a good influence equally at home and abroad. Against the fanciful\r\npicture of Mrs. Jellyby let us put the life-story of Charlotte Yonge,\r\nwho, while discharging every duty to her family and her village, in a\r\nway which won their lasting affection, was able to put aside large sums\r\nfrom the earnings of her pen to supply the needs of the Melanesian\r\nMission.\r\n\r\nLet us remember, too, that much of the bitterest criticism has come from\r\nthose who have a direct interest in suppressing missions, who have made\r\nlarge profits in remote places by procedure which will not bear the\r\nlight of day. Patteson would have been content to justify his work by\r\nhis Master's bidding as quoted in the Gospel. His friends would have\r\nbeen content to claim that the actual working of the Mission should be\r\nexamined. If outside testimony to the value of his work is wanted, one\r\ngood instance will refute a large amount of idle calumny. Sir George\r\nGrey, no sentimentalist but the most practical ruler of New Zealand,\r\ngave his own money to get three native boys, chosen by himself, educated\r\nat Patteson's school, and was fully satisfied with the result.\r\n\r\nBut this simple regular life was soon to be perturbed by new\r\ncomplications, which rose from the European settlers in Fiji. As their\r\nplantations increased, the need for labour became urgent and the\r\nMelanesian islands were drawn upon to supply it. In many ways Patteson\r\nfelt that it was good for the Melanesians to be trained to agricultural\r\nwork; but the trouble was that they were being deceived over the\r\nconditions of the undertaking. Open kidnapping and the revival of\r\nanything like a slave trade could hardly be practised under the British\r\nflag at this time; nor indeed did the Fiji settlers, in most cases, wish\r\nto do anything unfair or brutal. It was to be a matter of contracts,\r\nvoluntarily signed by the workmen; but the Melanesian was not educated\r\nup to the point where he could appreciate what a contract meant. When\r\nthey did begin to understand, many were unwilling to sign for a period\r\nlong enough to be useful; many more grew quickly tired of the work,\r\nchanged their mind and broke their engagements. As the trade grew, some\r\nislands were entirely depopulated, and it became necessary to visit\r\nothers, where the natives refused to engage themselves. The trade was in\r\njeopardy; but the captains of merchant vessels, who found it very\r\nlucrative, were determined that the supply of hands should not run\r\nshort. So when they met with no volunteers, they used to cajole the\r\nislanders on board ship under pretence of trade and then kidnap them;\r\nwhen this procedure led to affrays, they were not slow to shoot. The\r\nconfidence of the native in European justice was shaken, and the work of\r\nyears was undone. Security on both sides was gone, and the missionary,\r\nwho had been sure of a welcome for ten years, might find himself in face\r\nof a population burning with the desire to revenge themselves on the\r\nfirst white man who came within their reach.\r\n\r\nPatteson did all that he could, in co-operation with the local\r\nofficials, to regulate the trade. There was no case for a crusade\r\nagainst the Fiji planters, who were doing good work in a humane way and\r\nwere ignorant of the misdeeds practised in Melanesia. The best method\r\nwas to forbid unauthorized vessels to pursue the trade and to put the\r\nauthorized vessels under supervision; but, to effect this in an outlying\r\npart of the vast British Empire, it was necessary to educate opinion and\r\nto work through Whitehall. This he set himself to do; but meanwhile he\r\nwas so distressed to find the islanders slipping out of his reach, that\r\nin the last months of his life he was planning a campaign in Fiji, where\r\nhe intended to visit several of the plantations in turn and to carry to\r\nthe expatriated workers the Gospel which he had hoped to preach to them\r\nin their homes.\r\n\r\nBut before he could redress this wrong he was himself destined to fall\r\na victim to the spirit of hostility evoked. His best work was already\r\ndone when in 1870 he had a prolonged illness, and was forced to spend\r\nsome months at Auckland for convalescence. In the judgement of his\r\nfriends his exertions had aged him considerably, and the climate had\r\ncontributed to break down his strength. Though he was back at work again\r\nbefore the end of the summer he was far more subject to weariness. His\r\nmanner became peaceful and dreamy, and his companions found that it was\r\ndifficult to rouse him in the ordinary interchange of talk. His thoughts\r\nrecurred more often to the past; he would write of Devonshire and its\r\ncharms in spring, read over familiar passages in Wordsworth, or fall\r\ninto quiet meditation, yet he would not unbuckle his armour or think of\r\nleaving the Mission in order to take a holiday in England.\r\n\r\nIn April 1871, when the time came for him to leave Norfolk Island for\r\nhis annual cruise, his energy revived. He spent seven weeks at Mota,\r\nleaving it towards the end of August to sail for the Santa Cruz group.\r\nOn September 20, as he came in sight of the coral reef of Nukapu, he was\r\nspeaking to his scholars of the death of St. Stephen. Next morning he\r\nhad the boat lowered and put off for shore accompanied by Mr. Atkin and\r\nthree natives. He knew that feeling had lately become embittered in this\r\ndistrict over the Labour trade, but the thought of danger did not shake\r\nhis resolution. To show his confidence and disarm suspicion he entered\r\none of the canoes, alone with the islanders, landed on the beach and\r\ndisappeared among the crowd. Half an hour later, for no apparent reason,\r\nan attack was started by men in canoes on the boat lying close off the\r\nshore; and before the rowers could pull out of range, Joseph Atkin and\r\ntwo of the natives had been wounded by poisoned arrows which, some days\r\nlater, set up tetanus with fatal effect. They reached the ship; but\r\nafter a few hours, when their wounds had been treated, Mr. Atkin\r\ninsisted on taking the boat in again to learn the Bishop's fate. This\r\ntime no attack was made upon them; but a canoe was towed out part of the\r\nway and then left to drift towards the boat. In it was the dead body of\r\nthe Bishop tied up in a native mat. How he died no one ever knew, but\r\nhis face was calm and no anguish seems to have troubled him in the hour\r\nof death. 'The placid smile was still on the face: there was a palm leaf\r\nfastened over the breast, and, when the mat was opened, there were five\r\nwounds, no more. The strange mysterious beauty, as it may be called, of\r\nthe circumstances almost make one feel as if this were the legend of a\r\nmartyr of the Primitive Church.'[41]\r\n\r\nMiss Yonge, from whom these lines are quoted, goes on to show that the\r\nfive wounds, of which the first probably proved fatal, while the other\r\nfour were deliberately inflicted afterwards, were to be explained by\r\nnative custom. In the long leaflets of the palm five knots had been\r\ntied. Five men in Fiji were known to have been stolen from this island,\r\nand there can be little doubt that the relatives were exacting, in\r\nnative fashion, their vengeance from the first European victim who fell\r\ninto their power. The Bishop would have been the first to make allowance\r\nfor their superstitious error and to lay the blame in the right quarter.\r\nHis surviving comrades knew this, and in reporting the tragedy they sent\r\na special petition that the Colonial Office would not order a\r\nbombardment of the island. Unfortunately, when a ship was sent on a\r\nmission of inquiry, the natives themselves began hostilities and\r\nbloodshed ensued. But at last the Bishop had by his death secured what\r\nhe was labouring in his life to effect. The Imperial Parliament was\r\nstirred to examine the Labour trade in the Pacific and regulations were\r\nenforced which put an end to the abuse.\r\n\r\n[Note 41: _Life of John Coleridge Patteson_, by Charlotte Yonge, 2\r\nvols. (Macmillan, 1874).]\r\n\r\n'Quae caret ora cruore nostro?' The Roman poet puts this question in his\r\nhorror at the wide extension of the civil wars which stained with Roman\r\nblood all the seas known to the world of his day.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has its martyrs in a nobler warfare yet more widely\r\nspread. Not all have fallen by the weapons of war. Nature has claimed\r\nmany victims through disease or the rigour of unknown climes. The death\r\nof some is a mystery to this day. India, the Soudan, South and West\r\nAfrica, the Arctic and Antarctic regions, speak eloquently to the men of\r\nour race of the spirit which carried them so far afield in the\r\nnineteenth century. Thanks to its first bishop, the Church of Melanesia\r\nshares their fame, opening its history with a glorious chapter enriched\r\nby heroism, self-sacrifice, and martyrdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ROBERT MORIER\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by William Richmond]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ROBERT D.

Funeral at Batchworth.\r\n\r\nROBERT MORIER\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIST\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplomacy as a profession is a product of modern history. As Europe\r\nemerged from the Middle Ages, the dividing walls between State and State\r\nwere broken down, and Governments found it necessary to have trained\r\nagents resident at foreign courts to conduct the questions of growing\r\nimportance which arose between them. Churchmen were at first best\r\nqualified to undertake such duties, and Nicholas Wotton, Dean of\r\nCanterbury, who enjoyed the confidence of four Tudor sovereigns, came to\r\nbe as much at home in France or in the Netherlands as he was in his own\r\nDeanery. It was his great nephew Sir Henry (who began his days as a\r\nscholar at Winchester, and ended them as Provost at Eton) who did his\r\nprofession a notable disservice by indulging his humour at Augsburg when\r\nacting as envoy for James I, defining the diplomatist as 'one who was\r\nsent to lie abroad for his country'.[42] Since then many a politician\r\nand writer has let fly his shafts at diplomacy, and fervent democrats\r\nhave come to regard diplomats as veritable children of the devil. But\r\nthis prejudice is chiefly due to ignorance, and can easily be cured by a\r\npatient study of history. In the nineteenth century, in particular,\r\nEnglish diplomacy can point to a noble roll of ambassadors, who worked\r\nfor European peace as well as for the triumph of liberal causes, and\r\nnone has a higher claim to such praise than Sir Robert Morier, the\r\nsubject of this sketch.\r\n\r\n[Note 42: The Latin form in which this epigram was originally\r\ncouched--_mentiendi causa_--does away with all ambiguity.]\r\n\r\nThe traditions of his family marked out his path in life. We can trace\r\ntheir origin to connexions in the Consular service at Smyrna, where\r\nIsaac Morier met and married Clara van Lennep in the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century. Swiss grandfather and Dutch grandmother became\r\nnaturalized subjects of the British Crown and brought up four sons to\r\nwin distinction in its service. Of these the third, David, married a\r\ndaughter of Robert Burnet Jones--a descendant of the famous Bishop\r\nBurnet, and himself a servant of the Crown--and held important\r\ndiplomatic appointments for over thirty years at Paris and Berne. So it\r\nwas that his only son Robert David Burnet Morier was born in France,\r\nspent much of his childhood in Switzerland, and acquired early in life\r\na remarkable facility in speaking foreign languages. To his schooling\r\nin England he seems to have owed little of positive value. His father\r\nand uncles had been sent to Harrow; but perhaps it was as well that the\r\nson did not, in this, follow in his father's footsteps. However much he\r\nneglected his studies with two easy-going tutors, he preserved his\r\nfreshness and originality and ran no danger of being drilled into a\r\ntype. If he had as a boy undue self-confidence, no one was better fitted\r\nto correct it than his mother, a woman of wide sympathies and strong\r\nintellectual force. The letters which passed between them display, on\r\nhis part, mature powers of expression at an early age, and show the\r\ngenerous, affectionate nature of both; and till her death in 1855 she\r\nremained his chief confidante and counsellor. In trying to matriculate\r\nat Balliol College he met with a momentary check, due to the casual\r\nnature of his education; but, after retrieving this, he rapidly made\r\ngood his deficiency in Greek and Latin, and ended by taking a creditable\r\ndegree. His time at Oxford, apart from reading, was well spent. He made\r\nspecial friends with two of the younger dons: Temple, afterwards\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and Jowett, the future Master of Balliol. The\r\nformer was carried by rugged force and sheer ability to the highest\r\nposition in the Church; the latter won a peculiar place, in Oxford and\r\nin the world outside, by his gifts of judging character and stimulating\r\nintellectual interest. Morier became his favourite pupil and lifelong\r\nfriend. F. T. Palgrave, the friend of both, tells us how 'Morier went up\r\nto Balliol a lax and imperfectly educated fellow; but Jowett, seeing his\r\ngreat natural capacity, took him in the Long Vacation of 1848 and\r\npractically \"converted\" him to the doctrine of work. This was the\r\nturning-point in Morier's life.' Together the two friends spent many a\r\nholiday in Germany, Scotland, and elsewhere, and must have presented a\r\nstrange contrast to one another: Jowett, small, frail, quiet and\r\nprecise in manner, Morier big in every way, exuberant and full of\r\nvitality. It was with Jowett and Stanley (afterwards Dean of\r\nWestminster) that Morier went to Paris in 1848, eager to study the\r\nRevolutionary spirit in its most lively manifestations. Stanley\r\ndescribes him as 'a Balliol undergraduate of gigantic size, who speaks\r\nFrench better than English, is to wear a blouse, and to go about\r\ndisguised to the clubs'.\r\n\r\nHe took his degree in November 1849, and a month later he was visiting\r\nDresden and Berlin, making German friends and initiating himself in\r\nGerman politics and German ways of thought. Though his British\r\npatriotism was fervid and sustained, he was capable of understanding men\r\nof other nations and recognizing their merits; and in knowledge of\r\nGermany he acquired a position among Englishmen of his day rivalled only\r\nby Odo Russell, afterwards Ambassador at Berlin. Morier's father had for\r\nmany years represented Great Britain in Switzerland and could guide him\r\nboth by precept and by example. Free intercourse with the most liberal\r\nminds in Oxford had developed the lessons which he had learnt at home.\r\nBut his own energy and application effected more than anything. He was\r\nnot satisfied till he had mastered a problem; and books, places, and\r\npeople were laid under contribution unsparingly. He started on his tour\r\ncarrying letters of introduction to some of the famous men in Germany,\r\nincluding the great traveller and scientist, Alexander von Humboldt. Of\r\na younger generation was the philologist Max Müller, who was a frequent\r\ncompanion of Morier in Berlin, and gave up his time to nursing him back\r\nto health when he was taken ill with quinsy. He found friends in all\r\nprofessions, but chiefly among politicians. A typical instance is von\r\nRoggenbach, who rose to be Premier of Baden in the years 1861 to 1865,\r\nwhen the destinies of Germany were in the melting-pot. Baden was in\r\nsome ways the leading state in South Germany at that time, combining\r\nliberal ideals with a fervent advocacy of national union, and the views\r\nof Roggenbach on political questions attracted Morier's warmest\r\nsympathy. Another state in which Morier felt genuinely at home was the\r\nDuchy of Coburg, from which Prince Albert had come to wed our own Queen\r\nVictoria. The Prince's brother, the reigning Duke, treated Morier as a\r\npersonal friend; and here, too, he found Baron Stockmar, a Nestor among\r\nGerman Liberals, who had spent his political life in trying to promote\r\ngoodwill between England and Germany. He received Morier into his family\r\ncircle and adopted him as the heir to his policy. This intimacy led to\r\nfurther results; and, thanks in part to Morier's subsequent friendship\r\nwith the Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia, generous ideals and a\r\nliberal spirit were to be found surviving in a few places even after\r\n1870, though Bismarck had poisoned the minds of a whole generation by\r\nthe material successes which he achieved.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the doors of the Foreign Office were closed to Morier. The\r\nSecretary of State, Lord Palmerston, had treated his father unfairly, as\r\nhe thought, some years before, and Morier would ask no favours of him.\r\nHe continued his education, keeping in close touch with Jowett and\r\nTemple, and, when he saw a chance of studying politics at first hand, he\r\neagerly availed himself of it. The troubles of Schleswig-Holstein, too\r\nintricate to be explained briefly, had been brewing for some time. In\r\n1850, the dispute, to which Prussia, Denmark, and the German Diet were\r\nall parties, came to a head. The Duchies were overrun by Prussian\r\ntroops, while the Danish Navy held the sea. Morier rushed off to see for\r\nhimself what was happening, and spent some interesting days at Kiel,\r\ntalking to those who could instruct him, and forming his own judgement.\r\nThis was adverse to the wisdom of the Copenhagen Radicals, who were\r\ntrying to assert by force their supremacy over a German population. In\r\nthe circumstances, as Prussia gave way to the wishes of other powers, no\r\nsatisfactory decision could be reached; but ten years later the issue\r\nwas in the ruthless hands of Bismarck, and was settled by 'blood and\r\niron'.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Morier accepted a clerkship in the Education Office at £120 a\r\nyear. The work was not to his taste, but at least it was public service,\r\nand he saw no hope of employment in the Foreign Office. He found some\r\ndistractions in London society. He kept up relations with his old\r\nfriends, and he took a leading part in establishing the Cosmopolitan\r\nClub, which later met in Watts's studio, but began its existence in\r\nMorier's own rooms. He enjoyed greatly a meeting with Tennyson and\r\nBrowning, and wrote with enthusiasm of the former to his father, as 'one\r\nwho gave men an insight into the real Hero-world, as one from whom he\r\ncould catch reflected something of the Divine'. But Morier's spirits\r\nwere mercurial, and between moments of elation he was apt to fall into\r\nfits of melancholy, when he could find no outlet for his energies.\r\nWaiting for his true profession tried him sorely, and he was even\r\nresigning himself to the prospect of a visit to Australia as a\r\nprofessional journalist, when fortune at last smiled upon him.\r\nPalmerston retired from the Foreign Office, and when Clarendon succeeded\r\nhim, Morier's name was placed on the list of candidates for an\r\nattachéship. At Easter 1853 he started for another visit to the\r\nContinent, full of hope and more than ever determined to qualify himself\r\nfor the profession which he loved.\r\n\r\nHe was rewarded for his zeal a few weeks later, when he paid a visit to\r\nVienna, won the favour of the Ambassador, Lord Westmorland, and was\r\ncommended to the Foreign Office. At the age of twenty-seven he was\r\nappointed to serve Her Majesty as unpaid attaché, having already\r\nacquired a knowledge of European politics which many men of sixty would\r\nhave envied. In figure he was tall, with a tendency already manifested\r\nto put on flesh, good-looking, genial and sympathetic in manner, a _bon\r\nvivant_, passionately fond of dancing and society, an excellent talker\r\nor listener as the occasion demanded. His intelligence was quick, his\r\npowers of handling details and of grasping broad principles were alike\r\nremarkable. He wrote with ease, clearness, and precision; he knew what\r\nhard work meant and revelled in it. Unfortunately he was subject already\r\nto rheumatic gout, which was to make him acquainted with many\r\nwatering-places, and was to handicap him gravely in later life. But at\r\npresent nothing could check his ardour in his profession, and during his\r\nfive years at Vienna he took every chance of studying foreign lands and\r\nof making acquaintance with the chief figures in the diplomatic world.\r\nHe enjoyed talks with Baron Jellaçiç, who had saved the monarchy in\r\n1848, and with Prince Metternich, whose political career ended in that\r\nyear of revolutions and who was now only a figure in society. After the\r\nCrimean War Morier obtained permission to make a tour through South-east\r\nHungary and to study for himself the mixture of Slavonic, Magyar, and\r\nTeutonic races inhabiting that district. He followed this up by another\r\ntour of three months, which carried him from Agram southwards into\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, having prepared for it by working ten to twelve\r\nhours a day for some weeks at the language of the southern Slavs.\r\nIncidentally he enjoyed some hunting expeditions with Turkish pashas,\r\nand obtained some insight into the weakness of the British consular\r\nsystem. All his life he believed strongly in the value of such tours to\r\nobtain first-hand information; and thirty years later, as Ambassador, he\r\nencouraged his secretaries to familiarize themselves with the outlying\r\ndistricts of the Russian empire.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, at the age of thirty-two, Morier passed from Vienna to Berlin.\r\nIt was the year in which the Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of\r\nQueen Victoria, married the Crown Prince of Prussia.[43] Her father, the\r\nPrince Consort, was very anxious that Morier should be at hand to advise\r\nthe young couple, and the appointment to Berlin was his work. Then it\r\nwas that Morier became involved in the struggle between Bismarck and the\r\nLiberal influences in Germany, which had no stronger rallying-point than\r\nthe Coburg Court. This conflict only showed itself later, and at first\r\nthe young English attaché must have seemed a sufficiently unimportant\r\nperson; but before 1862 Bismarck, coming home to Berlin from the St.\r\nPetersburg Embassy, and discerning the nature of Morier's character, had\r\ndeclared that it was desirable to remove such an influence from the path\r\nof his party, who were determined to bring Liberal Germany under the\r\nyoke of a Prussia which had no sympathy for democratic ideals.\r\n\r\n[Note 43: The ill-fated Emperor Frederick III, who died of cancer in\r\n1888.]\r\n\r\nFor the moment the ship of State was hanging in the wind; light currents\r\nof air were perceptible; sails were filling in one parliamentary boat or\r\nanother; but the chief movement was to be seen not in parliamentary\r\ncircles but in the excellent civil service, which preserved that honesty\r\nand efficiency which it had acquired in the days of Stein. There were\r\nmarked tendencies towards Liberalism and towards unification in\r\ndifferent parts of Germany; and, if the Liberal party could have\r\nproduced one man of firmness and decision, these forces might have\r\ntriumphed over the reactionary Prussian clique. In this conflict Morier\r\nwas bound to be a passionate sympathiser with the parties which included\r\nso many of his personal friends and which advocated principles so dear\r\nto his heart. With the triumph of his friends, too, were associated the\r\nprospects of a good understanding between England and Germany, for which\r\nMorier himself was labouring; and he was accused of having meddled\r\nindiscreetly with local politics. When King William broke with the\r\nLiberals over the Army Bill, caution was doubly necessary. Bismarck\r\nbecame Minister in 1862, and, great man though he was, he was capable of\r\nany pettiness when he had once declared war on an opponent. From that\r\ntime the policy of working for an Anglo-Prussian _entente_ was a losing\r\ngame, not only because Bismarck detested the parliamentarism which he\r\nassociated with England, but also because, on our side too, extremists\r\nwere stirring up ill-feeling. In his letters Morier makes frequent\r\nreference to the 'John Bullishness' of _The Times_. When this journal,\r\nto which European importance attached during the editorship of Delane,\r\nwas not openly flouting Prussia, it was displaying reckless ignorance of\r\na people who were making the most solid contributions to learning and\r\nraising themselves by steady industry from the losses due to centuries\r\nof Continental warfare.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time he paid visits to friends at Dresden, at Baden, and\r\nelsewhere. One year he was sent to Naples on a special mission, another\r\nyear he was summoned to attend on Queen Victoria, who was visiting\r\nCoburg. In 1859 he is lamenting the monotony of existence at Berlin,\r\nwhich he calls 'a Dutch mud canal of a life, without even the tulip beds\r\non the banks'. But when later in that year Lord John Russell, who knew\r\nand appreciated his talents, became Foreign Secretary and called on him\r\nfor frequent reports on important subjects, Morier found solace in work.\r\nHe was only too willing to put his wide knowledge of the country in\r\nwhich he was serving at the disposal of his superiors at home. He wrote\r\nwith equal ability on political, agrarian, and financial subjects. That\r\nhe could take into account the personal factor is shown by the long\r\nletter which he wrote in 1861 to Sir Henry Layard, then Political\r\nUnder-Secretary of State.[44] It contained a masterly analysis of the\r\ncharacter and upbringing of King William, showing how his intellectual\r\nnarrowness had hampered Liberal Governments, while his professional\r\ntraining in the army had made him a most efficient instrument in\r\npromoting the aims of Junker politicians and ministers of war.\r\n\r\n[Note 44: _Memoirs of Sir Robert Morier_, 1826-76, by his daughter,\r\nLady Rosslyn Wemyss, vol. i, p. 303 (Edward Arnold, 1911).]\r\n\r\nOn Schleswig-Holstein, above all, Morier exerted himself to convey a\r\nright view of the question to those who guided opinion in London,\r\nwhether newspaper editors or responsible ministers. He appealed to the\r\nsame principle which had won support for the Lombards against Austria.\r\nThe inhabitants of the disputed Duchies were for the most part Germans,\r\nand the Danish Government had done violence to their national sentiment.\r\nIf England could have extended its sympathy to its northern kinsmen in\r\ntime, the question might have been settled peacefully before 1862, and\r\nBismarck could never have availed himself of such a lever to overthrow\r\nhis Liberal opponents. As it was, Prussia ignored the Danish sympathies\r\ndisplayed abroad, especially in the English press, went her own way and\r\ninvaded the Duchies, dragging in her train Austria, her confederate and\r\nher dupe. Palmerston, who controlled our foreign policy at the time,\r\nwaited till the last moment, blustered, found himself impotent to move\r\nwithout French support, and left Denmark smarting with a sense of\r\nbetrayal which lasted till 1914. By such bungling Morier knew that we\r\nwere incurring enmity on both sides and lowering our reputation for\r\ncourage as well as for statesmanship.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 he was chosen as one of the Special Commissioners to negotiate a\r\ntreaty of commerce between Great Britain and Austria. He had always\r\nbeen a Free-trader, and he was convinced that such economic agreements\r\ncould do much to improve the world and to strengthen the bonds of peace.\r\nSo he was ready and willing to do hard work in this sphere, and finding\r\na congenial colleague in Sir Louis Mallet, one of the best economists of\r\nthe day, he spent some months at Vienna in fruitful activity and won the\r\ngood opinion of all associated with him. For his services he received\r\nthe C.B. and high commendation from London.\r\n\r\nThis same year brought promotion in rank, though for long it was\r\nuncertain where he would go. In August he accepted the offer of First\r\nSecretary to the Legation in Japan, most reluctantly, because he saw his\r\npeculiar knowledge of Germany would be wasted there. Ten days later this\r\noffer was changed for a similar position at the Court of Greece, which\r\nwas equally uncongenial; but at the end of the year the Foreign Office\r\ndecided that he would be most useful in the field which he had chosen\r\nfor himself, and after a few months at Frankfort he was sent in the year\r\n1866 as chargé d'affaires to the Grand Ducal Court of Hesse-Darmstadt.\r\n\r\nFrom these posts he was destined to be a spectator of the two great\r\nconflicts by which Bismarck established the union of North Germany and\r\nits primacy in Europe. Morier detested the means by which this end was\r\nachieved, but he had consistently maintained that this union ought to\r\nbe, and could only be, achieved by Prussia, and he remained true to his\r\nbeliefs. It is a great tribute to his intellectual force that he was\r\nable to control his personal sympathies and antipathies, and to judge\r\npassing events with reference to the past and the future. He had liked\r\nthe statesmen whom he had met at Vienna, and he recognized their good\r\nfaith in the difficult negotiations of 1865. But for the good of Europe,\r\nhe thought the Austrian Government should now look eastwards. It could\r\nnot do double work at Vienna and at Frankfort. The impotence of the\r\nFrankfort Diet could be cured only by the North Germans, and the\r\naspirations of good patriots, from Baden to the Baltic, had been for\r\nlong directed towards Prussia. But it was no easy task to make people in\r\nEngland realize the justice of this view or the certainty that Prussia\r\nwas strong enough to carry through the work. Led by _The Times_, the\r\nBritish Press had grown accustomed to use a contemptuous tone towards\r\nPrussia; and when in the decisive hour this could no longer be\r\nmaintained, and British sentiment, as is its nature, declared for\r\nAustria as the beaten side, this sentiment was attributed at Berlin to\r\nthe basest envy. Relations between the two peoples steadily grew worse\r\nduring these years, despite the efforts of Morier and other friends of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe Franco-German war brought even greater bitterness between Prussia\r\nand Great Britain. The neutrality, which the latter power observed, was\r\nmisunderstood in both camps; and the position of a British diplomat\r\nabroad became really unpleasant. Morier in particular, as a marked man,\r\nknew that he was subject to spying and misrepresentation, but this did\r\nnot deter him from doing his duty and more than his duty. He took\r\nmeasures to safeguard those dependent on him, in case Hesse came into\r\nthe theatre of war. He organized medical aid for the wounded on both\r\nsides. He took a journey in September into Alsace and Lorraine to\r\nascertain the feeling of the inhabitants, that he might give the best\r\npossible advice to his Government if the cession of these districts\r\nbecame a European question. He came to the conclusion that Alsace was\r\nnot a homogeneous unit--that language, religion, and sentiment varied in\r\ndifferent districts, and that it was desirable to work for a compromise.\r\nBut Bismarck was determined in 1870, as in 1866, that the settlement\r\nshould remain in his own hands and that no European congress should\r\nspoil his plans. Morier found that he was being talked of at Berlin as\r\n'the enemy of Prussia', and atrocious calumnies were circulated. One of\r\nthese was revived some years later when Bismarck wished to discredit\r\nhim, and Bismarckian journals accused him of having betrayed to Marshal\r\nBazaine military secrets which he discovered in Hesse. Morier obtained\r\nfrom the Marshal a letter which clearly refuted the charge, and he gave\r\nit the widest publicity. The plot recoiled on its author, and Morier was\r\nspoken of in France as 'le grand ambassadeur qui a roulé Bismarck'. Yet\r\nall the while, with his wife a strong partisan of France, with six\r\ncousins fighting in the French Army, with his friends in England only\r\ntoo ready to quarrel with him for his supposed pro-German sentiments, he\r\nwas appealing for fair judgement, for reason, for a wise policy which\r\nshould soften the bitterness of the settlement between victors and\r\nvanquished. Facts must be recognized, he pleaded, and the French claim\r\nfor peculiar consideration and their traditional _amour propre_ must not\r\nbe allowed to prolong the miseries of war. At the same time Morier did\r\nnot close his eyes to the danger arising from the overwhelming victories\r\nof the German armies. No one saw more clearly the deterioration which\r\nwas taking place in German character, or depicted it in more trenchant\r\nterms. But it was his business to work for the future and not to let\r\nsentiment bring fresh disasters upon Europe.\r\n\r\nApart from this critical period, life at Darmstadt bored him\r\nconsiderably. His presence there was valued highly by Queen Victoria,\r\none of whose daughters had married the Grand Duke; but Morier felt\r\nhimself to be in a backwater, far from the main stream of European\r\npolitics, and society there was dull. So he welcomed in 1871 his\r\ntransference first to Stuttgart, and a few months later to Munich, the\r\ncapital of the second state in the new Empire and a great centre of\r\nliterary culture. Here lived Dr. Döllinger, historian and divine, a man\r\nsuspected at Rome for his liberal Catholicism even before his definite\r\nseverance from the Roman Church, but honoured everywhere else for the\r\nwidth and depth of his knowledge. With him Morier enjoyed many\r\nconversations on Church councils and other subjects which interested\r\nthem both; and in 1874, lured by the prospect of such society, Gladstone\r\npaid him a visit of ten days. Morier did not admire Gladstone's conduct\r\nof foreign policy, but he was open-minded enough to recognize his great\r\ngifts and to enjoy his company, and he writes home with enthusiasm about\r\nhis conversational powers. A still more welcome visitor in 1873 was\r\nJowett, his old Oxford friend, who never lost his place in Morier's\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nAmong these delights he retained his vigilance in political matters, and\r\nthere was often need for it, since the German Government was now\r\ndeveloping that habit of 'rattling its sword', and threatening its\r\nneighbours with war, which disquieted Europe for another forty years.\r\nThe worst crisis came in 1875, when Morier heard on good authority that\r\nthe military clique at Berlin were gaining ground, and seemed likely to\r\npersuade the Emperor William to force on a second war, expressly to\r\nprevent France recovering its strength. In general the credit for\r\nchecking this sinister move is given to the Tsar; but English influences\r\nplayed a large part in the matter. Morier managed to catch the Crown\r\nPrince on his way south to Italy and had a long talk with him in the\r\nrailway train. The Crown Prince was known to be a true lover of peace,\r\nbut capable of being hoodwinked by Bismarck; once convinced that the\r\ndanger was real (and he trusted Morier as he trusted no German in his\r\nentourage), he returned to Berlin and threw all his weight into the\r\nscale of peace. Queen Victoria also wrote from London; and, in face of a\r\npossible coalition against them, the Germans decided that it was wisest\r\nto abstain from all aggression.\r\n\r\nA new period opened in his life when he left German courts, never to\r\nreturn officially, and became the responsible head of Her Majesty's\r\nLegation at the Portuguese Court. His five years spent at Lisbon cannot\r\nbe counted as one of his most fruitful periods, despite 'the large\r\nsettlement of African affairs', which Lord Granville tells us that\r\nMorier had suggested to his predecessors in Whitehall. For the big\r\nschemes which he planned he could get no continuous backing at home,\r\neither in political or commercial circles. For the petty routine England\r\nhardly needed a man of such outstanding ability. Of necessity his work\r\nconsisted often in tedious investigation of claims advanced by\r\nindividual Englishmen, whether they were suffering from money losses or\r\nfrom summary procedure at the hands of the Portuguese police. Of the\r\ndiplomatic questions which arose many proved to be shadowy and unreal.\r\nSomething could be done, even in remote Portugal, to improve\r\nAnglo-Russian relations by a minister who had friends in so many\r\nEuropean capitals. The politics of Pio Nono and the Papal Curia often\r\nfind an echo in his correspondence. Here, too, as elsewhere, the\r\nintrigues of Germany had to be watched, though Morier was sensible\r\nenough to discriminate between the deliberate policy of Bismarck and the\r\nmanoeuvres of those whom he 'allowed to do what they liked and say what\r\nthey liked--or rather to do what they thought _he_ would like done, and\r\nsay what they thought _he_ would like said--and then suddenly sent them\r\nabout their business to ponder in poverty and disgrace on the mutability\r\nof human affairs'. In a passage like this Morier's letters show that he\r\ncould distinguish between a lion and his jackals, between 'policy' and\r\n'intrigue'.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for Germany and German suggestions, Portuguese\r\npoliticians would perhaps have been free from the fears which loomed\r\ndarkest on their horizon--the fears of an 'Iberian policy' which Spain\r\nwas supposed to be pursuing. In reality the leading men at Madrid knew\r\nthat they had little to gain by letting loose the superior Spanish army\r\nagainst Portugal and trying to form the whole peninsula into a single\r\nstate. Morier, at any rate, made it clear that England would throw the\r\nwhole weight of her power against such treatment of her oldest ally. But\r\nalarmist politicians were perpetually harping on this string, and\r\nMorier, in a letter written in 1876, compares them to 'children telling\r\nghost-stories to one another who have got frightened at the sound of\r\ntheir own voices, and mistake the rattling of a mouse behind the\r\nwainscot for the tramping of legions on the march'.\r\n\r\nTo Morier it seemed that the important part of his work concerned South\r\nAfrica, in which, at the time, Portugal and Great Britain were the\r\nEuropean powers most interested. It was in 1877 that Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone annexed the Transvaal, and many people, in Europe and Africa,\r\nwere talking as if this must lead to the expropriation of the Portuguese\r\nat Delagoa Bay. Morier himself was as far as possible from the\r\nimperialism which would ride rough-shod over a weaker neighbour. In\r\nfact, he pleaded strongly for British approval of the pride which\r\nPortugal felt in her traditions and of her desire to cling to what she\r\nhad preserved from the past. Once break this down, he said, and we\r\nshould see Portuguese dominions put up for auction, and England might\r\nnot always prove to be the highest bidder. Friendly co-operation, joint\r\ndevelopment of railways, and commercial treaties commended themselves\r\nbetter to his judgement, and he was prepared to spend a large part even\r\nof his holidays in England in working out the details of such treaties.\r\nHe studied the people among whom he was, and did his best to lead them\r\ngently towards reforms, whether of the slave-trade or other abuses, on\r\nlines which could win their sympathy. He appealed to his own Foreign\r\nOffice to abstain from too many lectures, and to make the most of cases\r\nin which the Portuguese showed promise of better things. 'This diet of\r\ncold gruel', he says in 1878, 'must be occasionally supplemented by a\r\ncup of generous wine, or all intimacy must die out.' Again in 1880, he\r\nasks for a K.C.M.G. to be awarded to a Governor-General of Mozambique,\r\nwho had done his best to observe English wishes in checking the\r\nslave-trade. 'Perpetual admonition', he says, 'and no sugar plums is bad\r\npolicy'--a maxim too often neglected when our philanthropy outruns our\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nWhen Morier was promoted in 1881 to Madrid, he used the same tact and\r\ngeniality to lighten the burden of his task. No seasoned diplomatist\r\ntook the politics of Madrid too seriously. Though the political stage\r\nwas bigger, it was often filled by actors as petty and grasping as those\r\nof Lisbon. The distribution to their own friends of the 'loaves and\r\nfishes' was, as Morier says, the one steady aim of all aspirants to\r\npower; and measures of reform, much needed in education, in commerce, in\r\nlaw, were doomed to sterility by the factiousness of the men who should\r\nhave carried them out. In the absence of principles Morier had to study\r\nthe strife of parties, and his correspondence gives us lively pictures\r\nof the eloquent Castelar, the champion of a visionary Republic, the\r\nharsh, domineering Romero y Robledo, at once the mainstay and the terror\r\nof his Conservative colleagues, and the cold, egotistic Liberal leader\r\nSagasta, whose shrewdness in the manipulation of votes had always to be\r\nreckoned with. The constitution given in 1876 had entirely failed to\r\nestablish Parliament on a democratic basis. For this the bureaucracy was\r\nresponsible. The Home Office abused its powers shamelessly, and by the\r\nvotes of its functionaries, and of those who hoped to receive its\r\nfavours, it could always secure a big majority for the Government of\r\nthe moment. For the three years which Morier spent at Madrid, he\r\nrecounts surprising instances of the reversal of electoral verdicts\r\nwithin a short space of time.\r\n\r\nThe King was popular and deserved to be so, for his personal qualities\r\nof courage, intelligence, and public spirit; but his position was never\r\nsecure. There was a bad tradition by which at intervals the army\r\nasserted its power and upset the constitution. Some intriguing general\r\nissued a _pronunciamiento_, the troops revolted, and the Central\r\nGovernment at Madrid, having no effective force and no moral ascendancy,\r\ngave way. Parliament had little stability. Cabinets rose and vanished\r\nagain; the same eloquent but empty speeches were made, and the same\r\nabuses remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nBut before now a spark from Spain had set the Continent ablaze. The past\r\nhad bequeathed some questions which, awkwardly handled, might cause\r\nexplosions elsewhere, and it was well to know the character of those who\r\nhad the key to the powder magazine. More than once Morier was approached\r\non the delicate question of the admission of Spain to the council of the\r\nGreat Powers. In Egypt, where so many foreign interests were involved,\r\nand where Great Britain suffered, in the 'eighties, from so many\r\ndiplomatic intrigues, Spain might easily find an opening for her\r\nambitions. She might advance the plea that the Suez Canal was the direct\r\nroute to her colonies in the Philippines. Germany, for ulterior ends,\r\nwas encouraging Spanish pretensions; but, to the British, Spain with its\r\nilliberal spirit scarcely seemed likely to prove a helpful\r\nfellow-worker. Morier had to try to convince Spanish ministers that\r\nGreat Britain was their truer friend while refusing them what they asked\r\nfor; and in such interviews he had to know his men and to touch the\r\nright chord in appealing to their prejudices or their patriotism. The\r\nEnglish tenure of Gibraltar was also a perpetual offence to Spanish\r\npride. Irresponsible journalists loved to expatiate on it when they had\r\nno more spicy subject to handle. On this, as on all questions affecting\r\nprestige only, Morier was tactful and patient. When they should come\r\nwithin the range of practical politics, he could take a different tone.\r\nBut he knew that more serious dangers were arising in Morocco, where the\r\nweakness of the Sultan's rule was tempting European powers to intervene,\r\nand he laboured to maintain peace and goodwill not only between his own\r\ncountry and Spain, but also between Spain and France. The common\r\naccusation that the English are not 'good Europeans' was pre-eminently\r\nuntrue in his case. He realized that the interests of all were bound up\r\ntogether, and used his influence, which soon became considerable, to\r\nremove all occasions of bitterness in the European family, being fully\r\naware that at Berlin there was another active intelligence working by\r\nhidden channels to keep open every festering sore.\r\n\r\nMorier was fertile in expedients when ministers consulted him, as we see\r\nnotably on the occasion of King Alfonso's tour in 1883. Before the King\r\nstarted, the newspapers had been writing of it as a 'visit to Berlin',\r\nthough it was intended to be a compliment to the heads of various\r\nstates. To allay the sensitiveness of the French, Morier suggested to\r\nthe Foreign Secretary that the King should make a point of visiting\r\nFrance first; but, owing to the ineptitude of President Grévy, this\r\nsuggestion was rendered impracticable. When the King did visit Paris,\r\nafter a sojourn at Berlin, where he received the usual compliment of\r\nbeing made titular colonel of a Prussian regiment, a terrible scene\r\nensued by which Morier's sagacity was justified. The King was greeted\r\nwith cries of 'à bas le Colonel d'Uhlans', and was hissed as he passed\r\nalong the streets; only his personal tact and restraint saved the two\r\nGovernments from an undignified squabble. He was able to give a lesson\r\nin deportment to his hosts and also to satisfy the resentful pride of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen. The whole episode shows how individuals can\r\ncontrol events when the masses can only become excited; kings and\r\ndiplomats may still be the best mechanics to handle the complicated\r\nmachinery on which peace or war depends. Alfonso XII died in November\r\n1885, soon after Morier's departure for another post, but not before he\r\nhad testified to the high esteem in which our Minister had been held in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nFrom Madrid he might have passed to Berlin. The British Government had\r\nonly one man fit to replace Lord Ampthill (Lord Odo Russell), who died\r\nin 1884. Inquiries were made in Berlin whether it was possible to employ\r\nMorier's great knowledge at the centre of European gravity, but Bismarck\r\nmade it quite clear that such an appointment would be displeasing to his\r\nsovereign. It was believed by a friend and admirer of both men that, if\r\nBismarck and Morier could have come to know one another, mutual respect\r\nand liking would have followed; but magnanimity towards an old enemy, or\r\none whom he had ever believed to be such, was not a Bismarckian trait,\r\nand it is more probable that all Morier's efforts would have been\r\nthwarted by misrepresentation and malignity.\r\n\r\nInstead he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he took up his duties as\r\nAmbassador in November 1885. Here he had to deal with bigger problems.\r\nThe affray at Penjdeh, when the Russians attacked an Afgh[=a]n outpost\r\nand forcibly occupied the ground, had, after convulsing Europe, been\r\nsettled by Mr. Gladstone's Government. Feeling did not subside for some\r\nyears, but for the moment Asiatic questions were not so serious as the\r\nconflict of interests in the Balkan peninsula. The principality of\r\nBulgaria created by the Congress of Berlin was the focus of the 'Eastern\r\nquestion'--that is, the question whether Russia, Austria, or a united\r\nEurope led by the Western powers, was to preside over the dissolution of\r\nTurkey. Bulgaria certainly owed its existence to Russian bayonets; in\r\nher cause Russian lives had been freely given; and this formed a real\r\nbond between the two nations, more lasting than the effect of Mr.\r\nGladstone's speeches, to which English sentimentalists attached such\r\nimportance. But the Bulgarians have often shown an obstinate tendency to\r\ngo their own way, and their politicians were loath to be kept in Russian\r\nleading-strings. Their last act, in 1885, had been to annex the Turkish\r\nprovince of Eastern Roumelia without asking the consent of the Tsar. At\r\nthe moment they could safely flout the Sultan of Turkey, their nominal\r\nsuzerain; but diplomatists doubted whether they could, with equal\r\nsafety, ignore the Treaty of Berlin and the wishes of their Russian\r\nprotector. The path was full of pitfalls. The Austrian Government was on\r\nthe watch to embarrass its great Slavonic rival; English statesmen were\r\ntoo anxious to humour Liberal sentiment as expressed at popular\r\nmeetings; Russian agents on the spot committed indiscretions; Russian\r\nopinion at home suspected that Bulgaria was receiving encouragement\r\nelsewhere, and the air was full of rumours of war.\r\n\r\nAcross this unquiet stage may be seen to pass, in the lively letters\r\nwhich Morier sent home, the figures of potential and actual princes of\r\nBulgaria, of whom only two deserve mention to-day. The first, Alexander\r\nof Battenberg, member of a family which enjoyed Queen Victoria's special\r\nfavour, had been put forward at the Berlin Congress, and justified his\r\nchoice in 1885 by repelling the Serbian Army and winning a victory at\r\nSlivnitza. He had won the attachment of his subjects but had incurred\r\nthe hatred of the Tsar, and the tone of his speeches in 1886 offended\r\nRussian sentiment. Two years after Slivnitza, in face of intrigues and\r\nviolence, he abandoned the contest and abdicated. The second is\r\nFerdinand of Coburg, whose tortuous career, begun in 1887, only ended\r\nwith the collapse of the Central Powers in 1918. He was put forward by\r\nAustria and supported by Stambuloff, the dictatorial chief of the\r\nBulgarian ministry. For years the Russian Government refused to\r\nrecognize him, and it was not till 1896 that he came to heel, at the\r\nbidding of Prince Lobanoff, and made public submission to the Tsar. But,\r\nfirst and last, he was only an astute adventurer of no little vanity and\r\nof colossal egotism, and such sympathies as he had for others beside\r\nhimself went to Austria-Hungary, where he owned landed property, and had\r\nserved in the army. He was also displeasing to orthodox Russia as a\r\nRoman Catholic, and in Morier's letters we see clearly the mistrust and\r\ncontempt which Russians felt for him.\r\n\r\nWith an autocrat like Alexander III, secretive and obstinate, these\r\npersonal questions became very serious. Ambitious generals might\r\nanticipate his wishes, Russian regiments might be on the march before\r\nthe Ministers knew anything, and Europe might awake to find itself over\r\nthe edge of the precipice.\r\n\r\nMorier's own attitude can best be judged from the letters which he\r\nexchanged with Sir William White, our able ambassador to the Porte, who\r\nwas frankly anti-Russian in his views. At first he put his trust in\r\nstrict observance of the Treaty of Berlin, and wished that Prince\r\nAlexander would consent to restore the _status quo ante_ (i.e. before\r\nthe change in Eastern Roumelia); but although a stout upholder of\r\ntreaties, he admitted as a second basis for settlement 'les voeux des\r\npopulations', on which the modern practice of plebiscites is founded.\r\nThe peasants of Eastern Roumelia were clearly glad to transfer their\r\nallegiance from the Sultan to the Prince. Also the successes achieved by\r\nPrince Alexander in so soon welding together Bulgaria and Eastern\r\nRoumelia had to be recognized as altering the situation. In fact,\r\nMorier's position was nearer to that of 1919 than to the old traditions\r\nin vogue a century earlier, and would commend itself to most English\r\nLiberals. But, as an ambassador paid to watch over British interests, he\r\nwas guided by expediency rather than by sentiment. These interests, he\r\nwas convinced, were more vitally affected in Central Asia than in the\r\nBalkans. He believed that, if British statesmen would recognize Russia's\r\npeculiar position in Bulgaria, the advance of Russian outposts towards\r\nIndia might be stayed, and the two great powers might work together all\r\nalong the line. But, to effect this, national jealousies must be allayed\r\nand an understanding established. Morier had to interpret at St.\r\nPetersburg speeches of English politicians, which often sounded more\r\noffensive there than in London: he also had to watch and report to\r\nLondon the unofficial doings and sayings of the aggressive Pan-Slavist\r\nparty, who might at any moment undermine the Ministry.\r\n\r\nForeign policy was in the hands of de Giers, an enlightened, pacific\r\nminister, who lacked, however, the courage to face his master's\r\nprejudices and had little authority over many of his own subordinates.\r\nDe Nelidoff, at Constantinople, dared even to make himself the centre of\r\ndiplomatic intrigue directed against the policy of his chief. Still less\r\nwas de Giers able to control the strong Pan-Slavist influences which\r\nruled in the Church, the Home Office, and the Press. Morier gives\r\ninteresting portraits of Pobedonóstsev, the bigoted procurator of the\r\nHoly Synod, of Tolstoy the reactionary Minister of the Interior, of\r\nKatkoff the truculent editor of the _Moscow Gazette_. These were the\r\nmost notable of the men who flouted the authority, thwarted the work,\r\nand undermined the position of the Tsar's nominal adviser, and often\r\nthey carried the day in determining the attitude of the Tsar himself.\r\nYet Morier was bound by his own honesty and by the traditions of\r\nBritish diplomacy to do business with de Giers alone, to receive the\r\nassurances of one who was being betrayed by his own ambassadors, to make\r\nhis protests to one who could not effectively remedy the grievances. His\r\ndifficulty was increased by de Giers's manner--'when getting on to\r\nslippery ground he has a remarkable power of speaking only half\r\nintelligibly and swallowing a large proportion of his words'. Morier was\r\noften conscious that he was building on sand; but in quiet weather it\r\nwas possible to stem the flood for a while even with dikes of sand.\r\nPerhaps a little later the tide of Balkan troubles might be setting in\r\nanother direction and the danger might be past. In Russia, where so much\r\nwas incalculable, it was wise to make the most of such help as presented\r\nitself. Meanwhile the Russian Ambassador in London, Baron de Staäl,\r\nco-operated as loyally with Lord Salisbury as Morier with de Giers; and\r\nthanks to their diplomatic skill, rough places were smoothed away and\r\nbases of agreement were found. In the course of 1887, the smouldering\r\nfires of Anglo-Russian antagonism died down, and Russia adopted a\r\nwaiting attitude in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nBut this happy result was not attained till after Asiatic problems had\r\ngiven rise to serious alarms. The worst moment was in July 1886, when\r\nthe Tsar suddenly proclaimed, contrary to the Treaty of Berlin, that the\r\nport of Batum was closed to foreign trade. His point of view was\r\ncharacteristic. His father had, autocratically, expressed in 1878 his\r\nintention to open the port; this had been done, and it had proved in\r\npractice a failure; as a purely administrative act, he (Alexander III)\r\nnow declared the port closed, _et tout était dit_. But naturally foreign\r\nmerchants resented the injury to their trade, and insisted on the\r\nsanctity of treaties. The Berlin Government, as usual, left to Great\r\nBritain all the odium incurred in making a protest, and the other\r\nContinental powers were equally silent. Morier asserted the British\r\ncase so strongly that he roused even de Giers to vehemence; but when he\r\nsaw that protests would avail nothing, he advised his Government to cut\r\nthe loss and to avoid further bitterness. He reminded them that Russia\r\nhad given way in Bulgaria, where the British point of view had\r\nprevailed, and that they must not expect her to submit to a second\r\ndiplomatic defeat. Besides, a quarrel between Russia and Great Britain\r\nwould only benefit a third party, ready enough to avail himself of it.\r\nHarmony was preserved, but the risk of a breach had been very great, and\r\nfeeling was not improved by Russian activity at Sebastopol, where the\r\nPan-Slavists were acclaiming the new birth of the Black Sea fleet. The\r\ndeath of Katkoff in 1887, and of Tolstoy in 1889, with the advent of\r\nmore Liberal ministers, strengthened de Giers's hands; and during his\r\nlater years, though he often needed great vigilance and tact, Morier was\r\nnot troubled by any crisis so severe.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Cross of the Bath, which he received in 1887, was a fitting\r\nreward for the services he had rendered to England and to Europe in this\r\nanxious time. He never lost heart or despaired of a peaceful solution.\r\n\r\nAt bottom, as he often repeats, Russia was not ready for big\r\nadventures--was, in fact, still suffering from lassitude after the war\r\nof 1878, 'like an electric eel which, having in one great shock given\r\noff all its electricity, burrows in the mud to refill its battery,\r\ndesiring nothing less than to come again too soon into contact with\r\norganic tissue'.\r\n\r\nApart from _la haute politique_ and the conflicts between governments,\r\nMorier's own compatriots were giving him plenty to do. A few instances\r\nwill illustrate the variety of the applications which reached the\r\nEmbassy. Captain Beaufort requests a special permit to visit Kars and\r\nits famous fortifications. Mr. Littledale asks for a Russian guide to\r\nhelp him in an ascent of Mount Ararat. Father Perry, S.J. (the Jesuits\r\nwere specially obnoxious to the Holy Synod), wishes to observe a solar\r\neclipse only visible in Russia. Another traveller, Mr. Fairman, is\r\nsummarily arrested near Rovno where the Tsar's visit is making the\r\npolice unduly brisk for the moment. Morier procures him a prompt\r\napology; but, not content with this, the Englishman now thinks himself\r\nentitled to a personal audience with the Tsar and the gift of some\r\ndecoration to compensate him, which suggestion draws a curt reply from\r\nthe much-vexed ambassador. But he was always ready to help a genuine\r\nexplorer, whether it was Mr. de Windt in Trans-Caucasia or Captain\r\nWiggins in the Kara Sea. To the latter, in his efforts to establish\r\ntrade between Great Britain and Siberia by the Yenisei river, Morier\r\nlent most valuable aid, and he is proud to report the concessions which\r\nhe won for our merchants in a new field of commerce.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he found occasion to cultivate friendships with Russians and\r\nforeign diplomats of all kinds. Of the more important he sends home\r\ninteresting sketches to his superiors in Whitehall, Vischnegradsky, the\r\n'wizard of finance', who raised the value of the rouble 30 per cent.,\r\nbecame one of his intimate friends. When that ambiguous figure, Witte,\r\nhis rival and successor, tried to discredit him, Morier vindicated with\r\nwarmth the honesty and patriotism of his friend. Baron Jomini of the\r\nForeign Office was of a different kind, witty, volatile, audaciously\r\noutspoken, more like a character in Thackeray's novels. Pobedonóstsev,\r\nthe Procurator of the Holy Synod, remained 'somewhat of an enigma'--as\r\nwe can easily believe when we hear that this bigoted Churchman, the\r\nterror of the Jews, had been a friend of Dean Stanley, and was still\r\nfond of English literature and English theology.\r\n\r\nStill more amusing are the stories which he tells of foreign visitors of\r\nhigh station--of the Duke of Orleans playing truant without the\r\nknowledge of his parents and being snubbed by his Grand Ducal\r\nrelatives; of Dal[=i]p Singh touring the provinces with a disreputable\r\nentourage and trying to make trouble for the British at Moscow; of the\r\nPrince of Montenegro and his beautiful daughters, whom Morier heartily\r\nadmires--'tall and massive, strong-limbed and comely, the true type of\r\nthe mothers of heroes in the Homeric sense'.\r\n\r\nWith the Court his relations were excellent. His intimacy with members\r\nof our own royal family helped him, and his geniality and\r\nunconventional, natural manner won favour with the Romanoffs, who\r\nretained in their high station a great deal of simplicity. More than\r\nonce Morier seized an opportunity for an act of special courtesy to the\r\nTsar; and Alexander appreciated this from a man whose character was too\r\nwell known for him to be suspected of obsequiousness.\r\n\r\nBut the life in St. Petersburg was not all pleasure, even when\r\ndiplomatic waters were quiet. The work was hard, the climate was very\r\nexacting with its extremes of temperature, and epidemics were rife. In\r\nNovember 1889 he reports the appearance of 'Siberian Catarrh, more\r\nusually described under the general name of Influenza', which was\r\nworking havoc in girls' schools and guardsmen's barracks, and had laid\r\nlow simultaneously Emperor, Empress, and half the imperial family.\r\nMorier himself became increasingly liable to attacks of ill-health, and\r\nfound difficulty in discharging his duties regularly. It required a keen\r\nsense of duty for him to stay at his post; and when in December 1891 he\r\nwas appointed to the Embassy at Rome, he was very willing to go. But\r\npublic interest stood in the way. He had made for himself an exceptional\r\nplace at St. Petersburg. No one could be found to replace him\r\nadequately, and the Tsar expressed a desire that his departure should be\r\npostponed. He consented to stay on, and the next two years of work in\r\nthat climate, together with the death in 1891 of his only son, broke\r\nhis spirit and his strength. Too late he went in search of health, first\r\nto the Crimea and then to Switzerland. Death came to him as the winter\r\nof 1893 was approaching, when he was at Montreux on the Lake of Geneva,\r\nclose to the home of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe impression which he made on his friends and colleagues is clear and\r\nconsistent, and the ignorance of the general public about men of his\r\nprofession justifies a few quotations. Sir Louis Mallet brackets him\r\nwith Sir James Hudson[45] and Lord Cromer as 'the most admirable trio of\r\npublic servants he had known'. Sir William White speaks of him and Odo\r\nRussell as 'two giants of the diplomatic service'. Lord Acton, who knew\r\nEurope as well as any Foreign Minister, and weighed his words, refers to\r\nhim in 1884 as 'our only strong diplomatist', and again 'as a strong\r\nman, resolute, ready, well-informed and with some amount of real\r\nresource'. More than one Foreign Secretary has borne testimony to the\r\nvalue of Morier's dispatches; and Sir Charles Dilke, who, without\r\nholding the portfolio himself, often shaped our foreign policy and was\r\nan expert in European questions, is still more emphatic about his\r\nintellectual powers, though he thinks that Morier's imperious temper\r\nmade him 'impossible in a small place'. Sir Horace Rumbold,[46] in his\r\n_Recollections_, has many references to him, especially as he was in\r\nearlier years. He speaks of Morier's 'prodigious fund of spirits that\r\nmade him the most entertaining, but not always the safest, of\r\ncompanions'; 'of his imperious, not over-tolerant disposition'; 'of the\r\ncurious compound that he was of the thoughtless, thriftless Bohemian and\r\nthe cool, calculating man of the world'; of his 'exceptionally powerful\r\nbrain and unflagging industry'. Elsewhere he recalls Morier's journeys\r\namong the Southern Slavs, in which he opened up a new field of\r\nknowledge, and adds, 'since then he has made himself a thorough master\r\nof German politics, and is, I believe, one of the few men whom Prince\r\nBismarck fears and correspondingly detests'.\r\n\r\n[Note 45: Sir James Hudson, G.C.B., British minister at Turin during\r\nthe years of Cavour's great ministry; died 1885.]\r\n\r\n[Note 46: Sir Horace Rumbold, G.C.B., Ambassador at Vienna\r\n1896-1900; died 1913.]\r\n\r\nJowett's testimony may perhaps be discounted as that of an intimate\r\nfriend; yet he was no flatterer, and as he often criticized Morier\r\nseverely, it is of interest to read his deliberate verdict, given in\r\n1873, that 'if he devoted his whole mind to it, he could prevent a war\r\nin Europe'. Four years earlier Jowett had been told by a diplomatist\r\nwhom he respected, 'Morier is the first man in our profession'.\r\n\r\nBy those who still remember him, Morier is described as a diplomatist of\r\n'the old school'. His noble presence, his courtly manner, and the\r\ndignity which he observed on all ceremonial occasions, would have\r\nqualified him to adorn the court of Maria Theresa or Louis Quatorze.\r\nThis dignity he could put off when the need for it was past. Among his\r\nfriends his manner was vivacious, his talk racy, his criticism free. He\r\nwas of the old school, too, in being self-confident and independent, and\r\nin believing that he would do his best work if there were no telegraph\r\nto bring frequent instructions from Whitehall. But he had not the\r\nnatural urbanity of Odo Russell, nor the invariable discretion of Lord\r\nLyons. He had hard work to discipline his imperious temper, and by no\r\nmeans always succeeded in masking his own feelings. Perhaps too high a\r\nvalue has been set on impenetrable reserve by those who have modelled\r\nthemselves on Talleyrand. By their very candour and openness some\r\nBritish diplomatists have gained an advantage over rivals who confound\r\ntimidity with reserve, and have won a peculiar position of trust at\r\nforeign courts. In dealing with de Giers, Morier at any rate found no\r\nneed to mumble or swallow his words. He was sure of himself and of his\r\nhonourable intentions. On one occasion, after reading to that minister\r\nthe exact words of the dispatch which he was sending to London, he\r\nstated his policy to him categorically. 'I always went', he said, 'upon\r\nthe principle, whenever it could be done, of clearing the ground of all\r\npossible misunderstandings at the earliest date.' Probably we shall\r\nnever see the end of 'secret diplomacy', whether under Tory, Liberal, or\r\nLabour governments; but this is not the tone of one who loves secrecy\r\nfor its own sake.\r\n\r\nIn many ways Morier combined the qualities of the old and the new\r\nschools. Though personally a favourite with kings and queens, he was\r\nfully alive to the changes in the Europe of the nineteenth century,\r\nwhere, along with courts and cabinets, other more unruly forces were at\r\nwork. His visit to Paris in 1848 showed his early interest in popular\r\nmovements, and he maintained a catholic width of view in later life. He\r\nknew men of all sorts and kept himself acquainted with unofficial\r\ncurrents of opinion. He could talk freely to journalists or to\r\nmerchants, could put them at their ease and get the information which he\r\nwanted. His comprehensiveness was remarkable. The strife of politicians\r\nin the foreground did not blur the distant landscape. In Russia, behind\r\nBalkan intrigues and Black Sea troubles he could see the cloud of danger\r\noverhanging the Pamirs. In Spain or Portugal he was watching and\r\nforecasting the possibilities of the white races in Africa. So his\r\ndispatches, varied and vivacious as they were, proved of the greatest\r\nvalue to Foreign Secretaries at home, and furnish excellent reading\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn these dispatches a few Gallicisms occur; and in writing to an old\r\nfriend like Sir William White he uses a free mixture of French and\r\nEnglish with other ingredients for seasoning. But in general the\r\nliterary style is admirable. He has a rare command of language, a most\r\ninventive use of metaphor, a felicitous touch in sketching a character\r\nor an incident. Towards those working under him he was exacting, setting\r\nup a high standard of industry, but he was generous in his praise and\r\nvery ready to take up the cudgels for them when they needed support. In\r\ncommending one of them, he selects for special praise 'his old-fashioned\r\nconscientiousness about public work and his subordination of private\r\ncomfort'. He inherited this tradition from his own family and his\r\nfaithfulness to it cost him his life.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we feel in reading these letters and memoranda that here is a\r\nman whose aim is truth rather than effect--not thinking of commending a\r\nprogramme to thousands of half-informed readers or hearers, in order to\r\nwin their votes, but giving counsel to his peers, Odo Russell or Sir\r\nWilliam White, Lord Granville or Lord Salisbury, on events and\r\ntendencies which affect the grave issues of peace and war and the lives\r\nof thousands of his fellow-countrymen. This generation has learnt how\r\nunsafe it is to treat these in a parliamentary atmosphere where men\r\nforce themselves to believe what they wish and close their eyes to what\r\nis uncomfortable. While human nature remains the same, democracy cannot\r\nafford to deprive itself of such counsel or to belittle such a\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH LISTER\r\n\r\n1827-1912\r\n\r\n\r\n1827.

Dies at Walmer, February 10.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH LISTER\r\n\r\nSURGEON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the north transept of Westminster Abbey, almost lost\r\namong the colossal statues of our prime ministers, our judges, and our\r\nsoldiers, will be found a small group of memorials preserving the\r\nillustrious names of Darwin, Lister, Stokes, Adams, and Watt, and\r\nreminding us of the great place which Science has taken in the progress\r\nof the last century. Watt, thanks partly to his successors, may be said\r\nto have changed the face of this earth more than any other inhabitant of\r\nour isles; but he is of the eighteenth century, and between those who\r\ndeveloped his inventions it is not easy to choose a single\r\nrepresentative of the age. Stokes and Adams command the admiration of\r\nall students of mathematics who can appreciate their genius, but their\r\nwork makes little appeal to the average man. In Darwin's case no one\r\nwould dispute his claim to represent worthily the scientists of the age,\r\nand his life is a noble object for study, single-hearted as he was in\r\nhis devotion to truth, persistent as were his efforts in the face of\r\nprolonged ill-health. No better instance could be found to show that the\r\nhighest intellectual genius may be found united with the most endearing\r\nqualities of character. Kindly and genial in his home, warmly attached\r\nto his friends, devoid of all jealousy of his fellow scientists, he\r\nlived to see his name honoured throughout the civilized world; and many\r\nwho are incapable of appreciating his originality of mind can find an\r\ninspiring example in the record of his life. There is no need to make\r\ncomparisons either of fame, of mental power, or of character; but the\r\nchoice of Lister may be justified by the fact that his science, the\r\nscience of Health and Disease, is one of absorbing interest to all men,\r\nand that with his career is bound up the history of a movement fraught\r\nwith grave issues of life and death from which few families have been\r\nexempt.\r\n\r\nAbout these issues bitter controversies have raged; but it is to the\r\nlesser men that the bitterness is due. By his family traditions, as well\r\nas by his natural disposition, Lister was a man of peace; and though he\r\nleft the Society of Friends at the time of his marriage, he retained a\r\nrespect for their views which accorded well with his own nature. When\r\nhe had to speak or write on behalf of what he believed to be the truth,\r\nit was from no motive of self-assertion or combativeness. He had the\r\ncalm contemplative mind of the student, whereas Bright, the Quaker\r\ntribune, the champion of Repeal, had all the fervour of the man of\r\naction. Lister's family had been Quakers since the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century; and at this time too they moved from Yorkshire to\r\nLondon, where his grandfather and father were engaged in business as\r\nwine merchants. But Joseph Jackson Lister, who married in 1818, and\r\nbecame in 1827 the father of the famous surgeon, was much more than a\r\nmerchant. He had taught himself the science of optics, had made\r\nimprovements in the microscope, and had won his way within the sacred\r\nportals of the Royal Society. Letters have been preserved which show us\r\nhow keen his interest in science always remained, and with what full\r\nappreciation he entered into the researches which his son was making as\r\nprofessor at Glasgow in the middle of the century. A father like this\r\nwas not likely to grudge money on the boy's education; but for the\r\nFriends many avenues to knowledge were still closed, including the\r\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge. He had to be content to go\r\nsuccessively to Quaker schools at Hitchin and Tottenham, and from the\r\nlatter to proceed, at the age of seventeen, to University College,\r\nLondon, which was non-sectarian. There the teaching was good, the\r\natmosphere favourable to industry, and Lister was not conscious of\r\nhardship in missing the delights of youth that fell to his more\r\nfortunate contemporaries.\r\n\r\nHis father lived in a comfortable house at Upton, some six miles east of\r\nLondon Bridge, in a district now completely swamped by the growth of the\r\nvast borough of West Ham. He kept up close relations with other Quaker\r\nfamilies living in the neighbourhood, especially the Gurneys of\r\nPlashets. In their circle the most striking figure was Elizabeth Fry,\r\nwho from 1813 to her death in 1843 devoted herself unsparingly to the\r\ncause of prison reform. From his home the father continued to exercise a\r\nstrong influence over his son, who was industrious and serious beyond\r\nhis years.\r\n\r\nFrom his father Lister learned as a boy to delight in the use of the\r\nmicroscope. He learned also to use his own power of observation, and to\r\nmake hand and eye work together to minister to his studies. The power of\r\ndrawing, which the future surgeon thus early developed, stood him in\r\ngood stead later in life; and it is interesting to contrast his\r\nenjoyment of it with the laments made by his great contemporary Darwin,\r\nwho felt keenly what he lost through his inability to use a pencil and\r\nto preserve the record of what he saw in nature or in the laboratory.\r\nLister's school-days were over when he was seventeen years old and there\r\nis nothing remarkable to tell of them; but his period at University\r\nCollege was unusually prolonged. He was a student there for seven years\r\nand continued an eighth year, after he had taken his degree, as Acting\r\nHouse Surgeon. In 1848, half-way through his time, a physical breakdown\r\nwas brought on by overwork, just as he was finishing his general\r\nstudies; but a long holiday enabled him to recover his strength, and\r\nbefore the end of the year he had begun the course of medical studies\r\nwhich was to be his life-work.\r\n\r\nAt school his record had been good but not brilliant, nor did he come\r\nquickly to the front in London. His mind was not of the sort which can\r\nbe forced to produce untimely fruit in the hot-house of examinations.\r\nBut his education was both extensive and thorough; it formed an\r\nexcellent general training for the mind and a good basis for the special\r\nstudies in which he was later to distinguish himself. He had been at\r\nUniversity College for two years before he gained his first medal; but\r\nby 1850 he had made his name as the best man of his year, capable of\r\nupholding the credit of his College against any rival in the\r\nmetropolis. Among his fellow students the best known in later years was\r\nSir Henry Thompson, whose portrait by Millais hangs in our National\r\nGallery. Among his professors one stands out pre-eminent, alike for his\r\ncharacter and for his influence on Lister's life. This was William\r\nSharpey, Professor of Physiology, an original man with a keen eye for\r\noriginality in others. In days when most English professors were content\r\nwith a narrow empirical training, he had trudged with his knapsack over\r\nhalf Europe in quest of knowledge, had studied in France, Switzerland,\r\nItaly, and Austria, and had made himself acquainted at first hand with\r\nthe best that was taught in their schools. He was a first-rate lecturer,\r\nclear and simple, and took much pains to get to know his pupils. When\r\nLister had held for a short time the post of Acting House Surgeon at\r\nUniversity College Hospital, and needed to make definite plans for his\r\ncareer, it was Sharpey who advised him to go north for a while and\r\nattend some classes in Edinburgh before deciding on his course. Thus it\r\nwas Sharpey who introduced him to Scotland and to Syme.\r\n\r\nBefore we speak of the latter, a few words must be given to the year\r\n1851, when Lister completed his studentship and became for a time an\r\nactive member of the hospital staff. This year was important as\r\nintroducing him to the practice of his art under the direction of\r\nErichsen, an Anglo-Dane and one of the foremost surgeons in London. It\r\nalso led to a change in his way of living, to his being thrown into\r\ncloser relations with men of his own age, and to his taking a more\r\nlively part in social gatherings. What we hear of the essays that he\r\nwrote at school, what we can read of his early letters, all harmonizes\r\nwith our conception of a Quaker upbringing. There is a staid primness\r\nabout him, which contrasts strangely with the pictures of medical\r\nstudents presented to us in the pages of Dickens. Capable though he was\r\nof enjoying a holiday, or of expanding among congenial associates,\r\nLister was not quick to make friends. He was apt to keep too much to\r\nhimself; and he seems to have inspired respect and even a certain awe\r\namong men of his own age. In his youth men noticed the same grave mien,\r\nsteadfast eyes, and lofty intellectual forehead which are conspicuous in\r\nhis later portraits. He was steady in conduct, serious in manner,\r\nprecise in his way of expressing himself; and while these qualities\r\nhelped him in the mental application which was so necessary if he was to\r\nprofit by his student days, he needed a little shaking up in order to\r\nadapt himself to the ways of other men in the sphere of active life.\r\nThis was given him by the constant activities of the hospital, and by\r\nthe demands which the various societies made upon him; but he did not\r\nallow them to interfere with his own researches, for which he could find\r\ntime when others were overwhelmed by the routine of their daily tasks.\r\n\r\nHis first bit of original research is of special interest because it\r\nconnects him with his father's work. He made special observations with\r\nthe microscope of the muscular tissue of the iris of the eye,\r\nillustrated his paper by delicate drawings of his own, and published it\r\nin the leading microscopical journal. This and a subsequent paper on the\r\nphenomena of 'Goose-skin' attracted some attention among physiologists\r\nat home and abroad, and brought him into friendly relations with a\r\nGerman professor of world-wide reputation. They also gave great\r\nsatisfaction to his father and to his favourite teacher Sharpey.\r\n\r\nBut Lister's development henceforth was to take place on Scottish\r\nground, and his visit to Edinburgh in 1853 shaped the whole course of\r\nhis career. James Syme, under whose influence he thus came, was the most\r\noriginal and brilliant surgeon then living in the British Isles, perhaps\r\nin all Europe. His merits as a lecturer were somewhat overshadowed by\r\nhis extraordinary skill as an operator; but he was a remarkable man in\r\nall ways, and the fact that Lister was admitted, first to his\r\nlecture-room and operating theatre, and then to his home, was without\r\ndoubt the happiest accident in his life.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Edinburgh with its large enthusiastic classes in the\r\nhospitals, its cultivated and intellectual society outside, supplied\r\njust what was wanted to foster the genius of a young man on the\r\nthreshold of his career. In London, centres of culture were too widely\r\ndiffused, indifference and apathy too prevalent, conservatism in\r\nprinciples and methods too strongly entrenched. In his new home in the\r\nnorth Lister could watch the boldest operator in his own profession, and\r\ncould daily meet men scarcely less distinguished in other sciences, and\r\nas a visitor to Syme's house he was from time to time thrown among able\r\nmen following widely different lines in life. Above all, here he met one\r\nwho was peculiarly qualified to be his helper; and three years later, at\r\nthe age of twenty-nine, he was married to Agnes Syme, the daughter of\r\nhis chief, to whom he had been attracted, as can be seen from the\r\nletters which passed between Edinburgh and Upton, soon after his arrival\r\nin the north. Before this event, he had already made his mark as\r\nResident House Surgeon, as assistant operator to Syme, and also as an\r\nindependent lecturer under the liberal system which gave an opening to\r\nall who could establish by merit a claim to be heard. He had also begun\r\nthose researches into the early stages of inflammation which, ten years\r\nlater, were to bear such wonderful fruit. It was a full and busy life,\r\nand the distraction of courtship must have made it impossible for him at\r\ntimes to meet all demands; but after 1856 his mind was set at rest and\r\nhis strength doubled by the sympathy which his wife showed in his work,\r\nand by the help which she was able to render him in writing to his\r\ndictation.\r\n\r\nFor their honeymoon they took a long journey on the Continent in the\r\nsummer of 1856; but half, even of this rare holiday, was given to\r\nscience, and, after some weeks' enjoyment of the beauties of Italy,\r\nhusband and wife made the tour of German universities, as he was\r\ndesirous to see something, if possible, of the leading surgeons and the\r\nnewest methods. Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Munich, Frankfort, Heidelberg,\r\nand Stuttgart were all included in the tour. They were well received,\r\nand at Vienna the most eminent professor of Pathology in the University\r\ngave more than three hours of his time to showing his museum to Lister,\r\nand also invited the young couple to dine at his house. Though he had\r\nnot yet made a name for himself, Lister's earnestness and intelligence\r\nalways made a favourable impression; and as he had taken pains with\r\nforeign languages in his youth, he was able, now and later in life, to\r\naddress French and German friends, and even public meetings, in their\r\nnative tongue. He came back to find work waiting for him which would tax\r\nhis energies to the full. In October 1856 he was elected Assistant\r\nSurgeon to the Infirmary, and now, in addition to lecturing, he had to\r\nconduct public operations himself, whereas he had hitherto only acted as\r\nSyme's assistant. This was at first a severe trial for his nerves. That\r\nit affected him differently from most experienced surgeons is shown by\r\nthe fact that he used always, all his life, to perspire freely when\r\nstarting to operate; but he learnt to overcome this nervousness by\r\nconcentrating his attention on his work. He was not a man who had\r\nreligious phrases on his lips; but in letters to his family, quoted by\r\nSir Rickman Godlee, he gives us the secret of his confidence and his\r\npower. 'Yesterday', he says in a letter written to his father on\r\nFebruary 26, 'I made my début at the hospital in operating before the\r\nstudents. I felt very nervous before beginning; but when I had got\r\nfairly to work, this feeling went off entirely, and I performed both\r\noperations with entire comfort.' A week later, in a letter to his\r\nsister, he returns to the subject. 'The theatre was again well filled;\r\nand though I again felt a good deal before the operation, yet I lost all\r\nconsciousness of the presence of the spectators during its performance,\r\nand did it exactly as if no one had been looking on. Just before the\r\noperation began I recollected that there was only one Spectator whom it\r\nwas important to consider, one present alike in the operating theatre\r\nand in the private room; and this consideration gave me increased\r\nfirmness.' Interest in the work for its own sake, forgetfulness of\r\nhimself, these were to be the key-notes of his life-work.\r\n\r\nAs yet, to a superficial observer, there were not many signs of a\r\nbrilliant career ahead of him. His private practice was small and did\r\nnot grow extensively for many years. The attendance at his earlier\r\ncourse of lectures was discouragingly meagre. This would have been more\r\ndiscouraging still, had not his dressers, from personal affection for\r\nhim, made a point of attending regularly to swell the number of the\r\nclass. Indeed, in view of the exacting demands made on him by the\r\nhospital, Lister might have been content to follow the ordinary routine\r\nof his profession. With his wife at his side and friends close at hand,\r\nhe had every chance of living a useful and happy life. But he still\r\nfound time to conduct experiments and to think for himself. His\r\nresearches were continued along the line which he had opened up in 1855,\r\nand in 1858 he appeared before an Edinburgh Surgical Society to read a\r\npaper on Spontaneous Gangrene.\r\n\r\nThis gave Mrs. Lister an opportunity to show her value. All his life\r\nLister was prone to unpunctuality and to being late with preparations\r\nfor his addresses, not because he was indifferent to the convenience of\r\nothers or careless about the quality of his teaching, but because he\r\nbecame so engrossed in the work of the moment that he could not tear\r\nhimself away from it so long as any improvement seemed possible. This\r\nsame quality made him slow over his hospital rounds and often over\r\noperations, with the result that his own meal-times were most irregular\r\nand his assistants often had trouble to stay the pangs of hunger. This\r\nhandicapped him in private practice and in some measure as a lecturer.\r\nHe gave plenty of thought to his subjects, but rarely began to put\r\nthoughts in writing sufficiently in advance of his engagement. When he\r\nwas in time with his written matter the credit was chiefly due to his\r\nwife. On the occasion of this paper she wrote for seven hours one day\r\nand eight hours the next, and her heroic industry saved the situation.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1859 Lister decided to be a candidate for the\r\nSurgical Professorship at Glasgow, which appointment was in the gift of\r\nthe Crown; and in spite of some intrigues to secure the patronage for a\r\nlocal man, the post was offered by the Home Secretary, Sir George Lewis,\r\nto the young Edinburgh surgeon. Syme's opinion and influence no doubt\r\ncounted for much. Lister's appointment dated from January 1860, but it\r\nwas not till a year and a half later that his position in Glasgow was\r\nassured by his being elected Surgeon to the Royal Infirmary. Before this\r\nhe could preach his principles in the lecture-room, but he had little\r\ninfluence on the practice of his students and colleagues. Thanks to the\r\nreputation which he brought from Edinburgh, his first lecture drew a\r\nfull room, and his class grew year by year till it reached the\r\nunprecedented figure of 182, and each year the enthusiasm seemed to\r\nrise. But in the hospital he had an uphill task, as any one will know\r\nwho has studied the history of these institutions in the first half of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\nTo-day the modern hospital is an object of general admiration, with its\r\nhigh standard of cleanliness and efficiency; and few of us would have\r\nany hesitation if a doctor advised us to go into hospital for an\r\noperation. Seventy or a hundred years ago the case was very different;\r\nand when we read the statistics of the early nineteenth century,\r\ngathered by the surgeons who had known its horrors, it is hard to\r\nbelieve that we are not back among the worst abuses of the Middle Ages.\r\nSuch terrible scourges as pyaemia and hospital gangrene were rife in all\r\nof them. In the chief hospital of Paris, which for centuries claimed\r\npre-eminence for its medical faculty, the latter disease raged for 200\r\nyears without intermission: 25 per cent. of those entering its doors\r\nwere found to have died, and the mortality after certain operations was\r\nmore than double this figure. Erichsen, who published in 1874 the\r\nstatistics of deaths after operations, quoted 25 per cent. in London as\r\nsatisfactory, and referred to the 60 per cent. of Paris as not\r\nsurprising. In military practice the number of deaths might reach the\r\nappalling figure of 80 or 90 per cent. What was so tragic about this\r\nsituation was that it was precisely hospitals, built to be the safeguard\r\nof the community, which were the most dangerous places in the case of\r\nwounds and amputations. In 1869 Sir James Simpson, the famous discoverer\r\nof chloroform, collected statistics of amputations. He took over 2,000\r\ncases treated in hospitals, and the same number treated outside. In the\r\nformer 855 patients (nearly 43 per cent.) died, as it seemed, from the\r\neffects of the operation; in the latter only 266 cases (over 13 per\r\ncent.) ended fatally. He went so far as to condemn altogether the system\r\nof big hospitals; and under his influence a movement began for breaking\r\nthem up and substituting a system of small huts, which, whether tending\r\nto security or not, was in other ways inconvenient and very expensive.\r\nAbout the same time certain other reforms, obvious as they seem to us\r\nsince the days of Florence Nightingale, were tried in various places,\r\ntending to more careful organization and to greater cleanliness; but\r\ntill the cause of the mischief could be discovered, only varying results\r\ncould be obtained, and no real victory could be won. Hence a radical\r\npolicy like Simpson's met with considerable support. In days when many\r\nsurgeons submitted despairingly to what they regarded as inevitable, it\r\nwas an advantage to have any one boldly advocating a big measure; and\r\nSimpson had sufficient prestige in Edinburgh and outside to carry many\r\nalong with him. But before 1869 another line of attack had been\r\ninitiated from Glasgow, and Lister was already applying principles which\r\nwere to win the battle with more certainty of permanent success.\r\n\r\nGlasgow was no more free from these troubles than other great towns; in\r\nfact it suffered more than most of them. With its rapid industrial\r\ndevelopment it had already in 1860 a population of 390,000. Its streets\r\nwere narrow, its houses often insanitary. In the haste to make money its\r\ncitizens had little time to think of air and open spaces. The science of\r\ntown-planning was unborn. Its hospital, far from having any special\r\nadvantage of position, was exposed to peculiar dangers. It lay on the\r\nedge of the old cathedral graveyard, where the victims of cholera had\r\nreceived promiscuous pit-burial only ten years before. The uppermost\r\ntier of a multitude of coffins reached to within a few inches of the\r\nsurface. These horrors have long been swept away; but, when Lister took\r\ncharge of his wards in the Infirmary, they were infected by the\r\npoisonous air generated so close at hand, and in consequence they\r\npresented a gruesome appearance. The patients came from streets which\r\noften were foul with dirt, smoke, and disease, and were admitted to\r\ngloomy airless wards, where pyaemia or gangrene were firmly established.\r\nIn such an environment certain death seemed to await them.\r\n\r\nThough his heart must have sunk within him, Lister set himself bravely\r\nto the task of fighting these grim adversaries. For two years, indeed,\r\nhe was chiefly occupied with routine work and practical improvements;\r\nbut he continued his speculations, and in 1861 an article on amputations\r\nwhich he contributed to the _System of Surgery_, a large work in four\r\nvolumes published in London, showed that he had not lost his power of\r\nsurveying questions broadly and examining them with a fresh and original\r\ninsight. He was not in danger of letting his mind be swamped with\r\ndetails, but could put them in their place and subordinate them to\r\nprinciples; and his article is chiefly directed to a philosophical\r\nsurvey which would enable his readers to go through the same process of\r\neducation which he had followed out for himself. Sir Hector Cameron, the\r\nmost constant of his Glasgow disciples, once illustrated this\r\nphilosophic spirit from a passage in Cicero contrasting the many\r\nscientists who 'render themselves familiar with the strange' (not\r\nrealizing that it is strange or needs explanation) with the few who\r\n'render themselves strange to the familiar'--who stand away from the\r\nphenomena to which every one has become too accustomed and examine them\r\nafresh for themselves. In Lister he recognized the peculiar gift which\r\nenabled him to rise superior to his subject, and to interpret what was\r\nto his colleagues a sealed book. In these days, among the too familiar\r\nscourges of the hospital, his work was perpetually putting questions to\r\nhim; to a man whose mind was open the answer might come at any moment\r\nand from any quarter.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, already, far from his own circle and for a long while out of\r\nhis ken, there was working in France the most remarkable scientist of\r\nthe century, Louis Pasteur, who more than once put his scientific\r\nability at the disposal of a stricken industry, and in his quiet\r\nlaboratory revived the industrial life of a teeming population. A\r\nmanufacturer who was confronted with difficulties in making\r\nbeetroot-alcohol and was threatened with financial ruin, appealed for\r\nhis help in 1856; and Pasteur spent years on the study of fermentation,\r\nmaking countless experiments to test the action of the air in the\r\nprocesses of putrefaction, and coming to the conclusion that the oxygen\r\nof the air was not responsible for them, as was widely believed. He went\r\nfurther and reached a positive result. He satisfied himself that\r\nputrefaction was set up by tiny living organisms carried in the dust of\r\nthe air, and that the process was due to what we now familiarly term\r\n'germs' or 'microbes'. The existence of these infinitesimal creatures\r\nwas known already to scientists, but their importance was not grasped\r\ntill Pasteur, in the years 1862 to 1864, expounded the results of his\r\nlong course of studies. He himself was no expert in medicine, but his\r\ndiscovery was to bear wonderful fruit when it was properly applied to\r\nthe science of health and disease. Lister's study of open wounds, his\r\nobservation of the harm done to the tissues in them when vitality was\r\nimpaired, and of the value of protective scabs when they formed, enabled\r\nhim to see the way and to point it out to others. When in 1865 he first\r\nread the papers which Pasteur had been publishing, he found the\r\nprinciple for which he had so long been searching. With what excitement\r\nhe read them, with what suddenness of conviction he accepted the\r\nmessage, we do not know; he has left no record of his feelings at the\r\ntime: but it was the most important moment in his career, and the rest\r\nof his life was spent in applying these principles to his professional\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWith his mind thus fortified by the knowledge of the true source of the\r\nmischief, realizing that he had to assist in a battle between the deadly\r\ngerms carried in the air and the living tissues trying to defend\r\nthemselves, Lister returned afresh to the study of methods. He knew that\r\nhe had to reckon with germs in the wound itself, if the skin was broken,\r\nwith germs on the hands and instruments of the operator, and with germs\r\non the dust in the air. He must find some defensive power which was able\r\nto kill the germs, at least in the first two instances, without\r\nexercising an irritating effect on the tissues and weakening their\r\nvitality. The relative importance of these various factors in the\r\nproblem only time and experience could tell him. Carbolic acid had been\r\ndiscovered in 1834 and had already been tried by surgeons with varying\r\nresults. At Carlisle it had been used by the town authorities to cope\r\nwith the foul odour of sewage, and Lister visited the town to study its\r\noperation. In its cruder form carbolic proved only too liable to\r\nirritate a wound and was difficult to dissolve in water. Lister tried\r\nsolutions of different strengths, and finally arrived at a form of\r\ncarbolic acid which proved to be soluble in oil and to have the\r\n'antiseptic' force which he desired--that is, to check the process of\r\nsepsis or putrefaction inside the wound. He also set himself to devise\r\nsome 'protective' which would enable Nature to do her healing work\r\nwithout further interference from without. Animals have the power to\r\nform quickly a natural scab over a wound, which is impermeable and at\r\nthe same time elastic. The human skin, after a slight wound, in a pure\r\natmosphere, may heal quickly; but a serious wound may continue open for\r\na long time, discharging 'pus' at intervals, while decomposition is\r\nslowly lowering the vitality of the patient. Lister made numerous\r\nexperiments with layers of chalk and carbolic oil, with a combination of\r\nshellac and gutta-percha, with everything of which he could think, to\r\nimitate the work of nature. His inexhaustible patience stood him in good\r\nstead in all these practical details. Rivals might speak contemptuously\r\nof the 'carbolic treatment' and the 'putty method' as if he were the\r\nvender of a new quack medicine; but at the back of these details was a\r\nscientific principle, firmly grasped by one man, while all others were\r\ngroping in the dark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LISTER\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by Messrs. Barraud]\r\n\r\nDuring 1866 and 1867 we see from his letters how he set himself to apply\r\nthe new principle first to cases of compound fracture and then to\r\nabscesses, how closely and anxiously he watched the progress of his\r\npatients, and how slow he was to claim a victory before his confidence\r\nwas assured. In July 1867, when he was just forty years old, he felt it\r\nto be his duty to communicate what he had learnt and to put his\r\nexperience at the disposal of his fellow workers. He wrote then to _The\r\nLancet_ describing in detail eleven cases of compound fracture under his\r\ncare, in which one patient had died, one had lost a limb, and the other\r\nnine had been successfully cured. This ratio of success to failure was\r\nfar in advance of the average practice of the time; but, for all that,\r\nit is not surprising that he met with the common fate which rewards\r\npioneers in new fields of study. It is true that other reforms were\r\nhelping to reduce the number of fatal cases. Florence Nightingale had\r\nled the way, and much had been learnt about hospital management. It was\r\npossible to maintain that good results had been achieved by other\r\nmethods, and that Lister's proofs were in no way decisive. But there was\r\nno need for critics to misapprehend the nature of his claims or to\r\nintroduce the personal element and accuse him of plagiarism. Sir James\r\nSimpson revived the memory of a Frenchman, Lemaire, who had used\r\ncarbolic acid and written about it in 1860, and refused to give Lister\r\nany credit for his discoveries. As a fact Lister had never heard of\r\nLemaire or his work; and, besides, the Frenchman had never known the\r\nprinciples on which Lister based his work, nor did he succeed in\r\nconverting others to his practice. How little the personal question need\r\nbe raised between men of the highest character is shown by the relations\r\nof Darwin and Wallace, who arrived independently and almost\r\nsimultaneously at their theory of the origin of species, Wallace put his\r\nnotes, the fruit of many years of work, at the disposal of Darwin; and\r\nboth continued to labour at the establishment of truth, each giving\r\ngenerous recognition to the other's part in the work.\r\n\r\nUnmoved then by this and other attacks, Lister continued his experiments\r\nand spent the greatest pains, for years in succession, in improving the\r\ndetails of his treatment. It would take too long to narrate his\r\nstruggles with carbolized silk and catgut in the search for the perfect\r\nligature, which should be absorbed by the living tissues without setting\r\nup putrefaction in the wound; or his countless experiments to find a\r\ndressing which should be antiseptic without bringing any irritating\r\nsubstance near the vital spot. These latter finally resulted in the\r\nchoice of the cyanide gauze, which with its delicate shade of heliotrope\r\nis now a familiar object in hospital and surgery. But one story is of\r\nspecial interest because it shows us clearly how Lister, while clinging\r\nto a principle, was ready to modify the details of treatment by the\r\nlessons which experience taught him. It was on the advice of others that\r\nhe first introduced a carbolic spray in order to purify the air in the\r\nneighbourhood of an operation. At first he used a small spray worked by\r\nhand, but this was, for practical reasons, changed into a foot-spray and\r\nafterwards into one worked by steam. One objection to this was that the\r\nsteam-engine was a cumbrous bit of apparatus to carry about with him to\r\noperations; and Lister all his life loved simplicity in his methods.\r\nAnother was that the carbolic solution, falling on the hands of the\r\noperator, might chill them and impair his skill in handling his\r\ninstruments. Lister himself suffered less in this way than most other\r\nsurgeons; with some men it was a grave handicap. The spectators at a\r\ndemonstration found it inconvenient, and in one instance at least we\r\nknow that the patient was upset by the carbolic vapour reaching her\r\neyes. This was no less a person than Queen Victoria, upon whom Lister\r\nwas called to operate at Balmoral in 1870. About the use of this\r\napparatus, which was an easy mark for ridicule, Lister had doubts for\r\nsome time; but it was not the ridicule which killed it, but his growing\r\nconviction that it did not afford the security which was claimed for it.\r\nHe was hesitating in 1881; in 1887 he abandoned the use of the spray\r\nentirely; in 1890 he expressed publicly at Berlin his regret for having\r\nadvocated what had proved to be a needless complication and even a\r\nsource of trouble in conducting operations. In adopting it he had for\r\nonce been ready to listen to the advice of others without his usual\r\nprecaution of first-hand experiments; in abandoning it he showed his\r\ncontempt for merely outward consistency in practice and his willingness\r\nto admit his own mistakes.\r\n\r\nIt was at Glasgow that Lister made his initial discoveries and conducted\r\nhis first operations under the new system. It was in the Glasgow\r\nInfirmary that he worked cures which roused the astonishment of his\r\nstudents, however incredulous the older generation might be. He had\r\nformed a school and was happy in the loyal service and in the enthusiasm\r\nof those who worked under him, and he had no desire to leave such a\r\nfruitful field of work. But when in 1869 his father-in-law, owing to\r\nill-health, resigned his professorship, and a number of Edinburgh\r\nstudents addressed an appeal to Lister to become a candidate for the\r\npost, he was strongly drawn towards the city where he had married and\r\nspent such happy years. No doubt too he and his wife wished to be near\r\nSyme, who lived for fourteen months after his stroke, and to cheer his\r\ndeclining days. Lister was elected in August 1869 and moved to Edinburgh\r\ntwo months later. For a while he took a furnished house, but early in\r\n1870 he made his home in Charlotte Square, from which he had easy access\r\nto the gardens between Princes Street and the Castle, 'a grand place'\r\nfor his daily meditations, as he had it all to himself before breakfast.\r\nAltogether, Edinburgh was a pleasant change to him, and refreshing; and\r\nthe one man who was likely to stir controversy, Sir James Simpson, died\r\nsix months after Lister's arrival. Among his fellow professors were men\r\neminent in many lines, perhaps the most striking figures being old Sir\r\nRobert Christison of the medical faculty, Geikie the geologist, and\r\nBlackie the classical scholar. The hospital was still run on\r\nold-fashioned lines; but the staff were devoted to their work, from the\r\nhead nurse, Mrs. Porter, a great 'character' whose portrait has been\r\nsketched in verse by Henley,[47] to the youngest student; and they were\r\nready to co-operate heartily with the new chief. The hours of work\r\nsuited Lister better than those at Glasgow, where he had begun with an\r\nearly morning visit to the Infirmary and had to find time for a daily\r\nlecture. Here he limited himself to two lectures a week, visited the\r\nhospital at midday, and was able to devote a large amount of time to\r\nbacteriological study, which was his chief interest at this time.\r\n\r\n[Note 47: W. E. Henley, poet and critic, 1849-1903. His poems, 'In\r\nHospital' include also a very beautiful sonnet on 'The Chief'--Lister\r\nhimself, which almost calls up his portrait to one who has once seen it:\r\n'His brow spreads large and placid.... Soft lines of tranquil\r\nthought.... His face at once benign and proud and shy.... His wise rare\r\nsmile.']\r\n\r\nHe stayed in Edinburgh eight years, and it was during his time here that\r\nhe saw the interest of all Europe in surgical questions quickened by the\r\nFranco-German war, and had to realize how incomplete as yet was his\r\nvictory over the forces of destruction. Some enterprising British and\r\nAmerican doctors, who volunteered for field-service, came to him for\r\nadvice, and he wrote a series of short instructions for their guidance;\r\nbut he soon learnt how difficult it was to carry out his methods in the\r\nfield, where appliances were inadequate and where wounds often got a\r\nlong start before treatment could be applied. The French statistics,\r\ncompiled after the war, are appalling to read: 90 out of 100 amputations\r\nproved fatal, and the total number of deaths in hospital worked out at\r\nover 10,000. The Germans were in advance of the French in the\r\ncleanliness of their methods, and some of their doctors were already\r\nbeginning to accept the antiseptic theory; but it was not till 1872 that\r\nthis principle can be said to have won the day. The hospitals on both\r\nsides were left with a ghastly heritage of pyaemia and other diseases,\r\nraging almost unchecked in their wards; but, in the two years after the\r\nwar, two of the most famous professors in German Universities[48] had by\r\nantiseptic methods obtained such striking results among their patients\r\nthat the superiority of the treatment was evident; and both of them\r\ngenerously gave full credit to Lister as their teacher. When he made a\r\nlong tour on the Continent in 1875, finishing up with visits to the\r\nchief medical schools in Germany, these men were foremost in greeting\r\nhim, and he enjoyed a conspicuous triumph also at Leipzig. Sir Rickman\r\nGodlee, commenting on the indifference of his countrymen, says that\r\nLister's teaching was by them 'accepted as a novelty, when it came back\r\nto England, refurbished from Germany'. But this was not till after he\r\nhad left Edinburgh, to carry the torch of learning to the south.\r\n\r\n[Note 48: Professor Volkmann of Halle and Professor von Nussbaum of\r\nMunich.]\r\n\r\nIn Edinburgh his colleagues, with all their opportunities for learning\r\nat first hand, seemed strangely indifferent to Lister's presence in\r\ntheir midst, even when foreigners began to make pilgrimages to the\r\ncentral shrine of antiseptics. The real encouragement which he got came,\r\nas before, from his pupils, who thronged his lecture-room to the number\r\nof three or four hundred, with sustained enthusiasm. In some ways it is\r\ndifficult to account for the popularity of his lectures. He made no\r\nelaborate preparations, but was content to devote a quiet half-hour to\r\nthinking out the subject in his arm-chair. After this he needed no\r\nnotes, having his ideas and the development of his thought so firmly in\r\nhis grasp that he could follow it out clearly and could hold the\r\nattention of his audience. His voice, though musical, was not of great\r\npower. He was often impeded by a slight stammer, especially at the end\r\nof a session. He was not naturally an eloquent man, and attempted no\r\nflights of rhetoric. But it seems impossible to deny the possession of\r\nspecial ability to a man who consistently drew such large audiences\r\nthroughout a long career; and if it was the matter rather than the\r\nmanner which wove the spell, surely that is just the kind of good\r\nspeaking which Scotsmen and Englishmen have always preferred.\r\n\r\nAnd so it needed an even greater effort than at Glasgow for Lister to\r\nstrike his tent and adventure himself on new ground. It is true that\r\nLondon was his early home; London could give him wider fame and enable\r\nhim to make a larger income by private practice; yet it is very doubtful\r\nwhether these motives combined could have induced him to migrate again,\r\nnow that he had reached the age of fifty. But he was a man with a\r\nmission. Some of his few converts in London held that only his presence\r\nthere could shake the prevailing apathy, and he himself felt that he\r\nmust make the effort in the interests of science.\r\n\r\nThe professorial chair to which he was invited in 1877 was at King's\r\nCollege, which was relatively a small institution; its hospital was not\r\nup to the Edinburgh standard; the classes which attended his lectures\r\nwere small. Owing to an unfortunate incident he was handicapped at the\r\nstart. When receiving a parting address from 700 of his Edinburgh\r\nstudents he made an informal speech in the course of which he compared\r\nthe conditions of surgical teaching then prevailing at Edinburgh and\r\nLondon, in terms which were not flattering to the southern metropolis.\r\nSome comparison was natural in the circumstances; Lister was not\r\nspeaking for publication and had no idea that a reporter was present.\r\nBut his remarks appeared in print, with the result that might be\r\nexpected. The sting of the criticism lay in its truth, and many London\r\nsurgeons were only too ready to resent anything which might be said by\r\nthe new professor. When he had been living some time in London, Lister\r\nsucceeded in allaying the ill feeling which resulted; but at first, even\r\nin his own hospital, he was met by coldness and opposition in his\r\nattempt to introduce new methods. In fact, had he not laid down definite\r\nconditions in accepting the post, he could never have made his way; but\r\nhe had stipulated for bringing with him some of the men whom he had\r\ntrained, and he was accompanied by four Edinburgh surgeons, the foremost\r\nof whom were John Stewart, a Canadian, and Watson Cheyne, the famous\r\noperator of the next generation. Even so he found his orders set at\r\nnaught and his work hampered by a temper which he had never known\r\nelsewhere. In some cases the sisters entrenched themselves behind the\r\nSecretary's rules and refused to comply, not only with the requests of\r\nthe new staff, but even with the dictates of common sense and humanity.\r\nAnother trouble arose over the system of London examinations which\r\ntempted the students to reproduce faithfully the views of others and\r\ndiscouraged men from giving time to independent research. Lister's\r\nmethod of lecturing was designed to foster the spirit of inquiry, and he\r\nwould not deign to fill his lecture-room by any species of 'cramming'.\r\nNever did his patience, his hopefulness, and his interest in the cause\r\nhave to submit to greater trials; but the day of victory was at hand.\r\n\r\nThe most visible sign of it was at the International Medical Congress\r\nheld at Amsterdam in 1879 and attended by representatives of the great\r\nEuropean nations. One sitting was devoted to the antiseptic system; and\r\nLister, after delivering an address, received an ovation so marked that\r\nnone of his fellow-countrymen could fail to see the esteem in which he\r\nwas held abroad. Even in London many of his rivals had by now been\r\nconverted. The most distinguished of them, Sir James Paget, openly\r\nexpressed remorse for his reluctance to accept the antiseptic principle\r\nearlier, and compared his own record of failures with the successes\r\nattained by his colleague at St. Bartholomew's Thomas Smith, the one\r\neminent London surgeon who had given Listerism a thorough trial. Other\r\ntriumphs followed, such as the visits in 1889 to Oxford and Cambridge to\r\nreceive Honorary Degrees, the offer of a baronetcy in 1883, and the\r\nconferring on him in 1885 of the Prussian 'Ordre pour le merite'.[49]\r\nBut a chronicle of such external matters is wearisome in itself; and\r\nbefore the climax was reached, the current of opinion was, by a strange\r\nturn of fortune, already setting in another direction.\r\n\r\n[Note 49: Restricted to thirty German and thirty foreign members.]\r\n\r\nThis was due to the introduction of the so-called aseptic theory so\r\nwidely prevalent to-day, of which the chief prophet in 1885 was\r\nProfessor von Bergmann of Berlin. Into the relative merits of systems,\r\non which the learned disagree, it is absurd for laymen to enter; nor is\r\nit necessary to make such comparisons in order to appreciate the example\r\nof Lister's life. The new school believe that they have gained by the\r\nabandonment of carbolic and other antiseptics which may irritate a wound\r\nand by trusting to the agency of heat for killing all germs. But Lister\r\nhimself took enormous pains to keep his antiseptic as remote as possible\r\nfrom the tissues to whose vitality he trusted, and went half-way to meet\r\nthe aseptic doctrine. If he retained a belief in the need for carbolic\r\nand distrusted the elaborate ritual of the modern hospital, with its\r\nboiling of everybody and everything connected with an operation, it was\r\nnot either from blindness or from pettiness of mind. As in the case of\r\nabandoning the spray, it was his love of simplicity which influenced\r\nhim. If the detailed precautions of the complete aseptic system are\r\nfound practicable and beneficial in a hospital, they are difficult to\r\nrealize for a country surgeon who has to work in a humbler way, and\r\nLister wished his procedure to be within reach of every practitioner who\r\nneeded it.\r\n\r\nOne more point must be considered before pronouncing Listerism to be\r\nsuperseded. In time of war there are occasions when necessity dictates\r\nthe treatment to be followed. Wounded men, picked up on the field of\r\nbattle some hours after they were hit, are not fit subjects for a method\r\nthat needs a clear field of operation. It is then too late for aseptic\r\nprecautions, as the wound may already be teeming with bacteria. Only the\r\nprompt use of carbolic can stay the ravages of putrefaction; and\r\nLister's method, so often disparaged, must have saved the lives of\r\nthousands during the late War.\r\n\r\nIn any case there is much common ground between the two schools: each\r\ncan learn from the other, and those professors of asepticism who have\r\nacknowledged their debt to Lister have been wiser than those who have\r\nmade contention their aim. This was never the spirit in which he\r\napproached scientific problems.\r\n\r\nAn earlier controversy, in which his name was involved, was that which\r\nraged round the practice of vivisection. Here Lister had practically the\r\nwhole of his profession behind him when he boldly supported the claims\r\nof science to have benefited humanity by the experiments conducted on\r\nanimals and to have done so with a minimum of suffering to the latter.\r\nAnd it was well that science had a champion whose reputation for\r\ngentleness and moderation was so well established. Queen Victoria\r\nherself showed a lively interest in this fiercely-debated question; and\r\nin 1871, when Lister was appealed to by Sir Henry Ponsonby, her private\r\nsecretary, to satisfy her doubts on the subject, he wrote an admirable\r\nreply, calm in tone and lucid in statement, in which he showed how\r\nunfounded were the charges brought against his profession.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 his professional career was drawing to a close. In that year he\r\nreceived the heartiest recognition that France could give to his work,\r\nwhen he went there officially to represent the Royal Society at the\r\nPasteur celebration. A great gathering of scientists and others,\r\npresided over by President Carnot, came together at the Sorbonne to\r\nhonour Pasteur's seventieth birthday. It was a dramatic scene such as\r\nour neighbours love, when the two illustrious fellow workers embraced\r\none another in public, and the audience rose to the occasion. To be\r\nacclaimed with Pasteur was to Lister a crowning honour; but a year later\r\nfortune dealt him a blow from which he never recovered. His wife, his\r\nconstant companion and helper, was taken ill suddenly at Rapallo on the\r\nItalian Riviera, and died in a few days; and Lister's life was sadly\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nHe was still considerably before the public for another decade. He did\r\nmuch useful work for the Royal Society, of which he became Foreign\r\nSecretary in 1893 and President from 1895 to 1900. He visited Canada and\r\nSouth Africa, received the freedom of Edinburgh in 1898 and of London in\r\n1907, and in 1897 he received the special honour of a peerage, the only\r\none yet conferred on a medical man. He took an active interest in the\r\ndiscoveries of Koch and Metchnikoff, preserving to an advanced age the\r\ncapacity for accepting new ideas. He was largely instrumental in\r\nfounding the Institute of Preventive Medicine now established at Chelsea\r\nand called by his name. But his work as a surgeon was complete before\r\ndeath separated him from his truest helper. In 1903 his strength began\r\nto fail, and for the last nine years of his life, at London or at\r\nWalmer, he was shut off from general society and lived the life of an\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM MORRIS\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by G. F. Watts in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nIn 1912 he passed away by almost imperceptible degrees, in his home\r\nby the sea, and by his own request was buried in the quiet cemetery of\r\nWest Hampstead where his wife lay. A public service was held in\r\nWestminster Abbey, and a portrait medallion there preserves the memory\r\nof his features. The patient toil, the even temper, the noble purpose\r\nwhich inspired his life, had achieved their goal--he was a national hero\r\nas truly as any statesman or soldier of his generation; and if,\r\naccording to his nature he wished his body to lie in a humble grave, he\r\ndeserved full well to have his name preserved and honoured in our most\r\nsacred national shrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MORRIS\r\n\r\n1834-96\r\n\r\n\r\n1834.

As Carlyle says: 'Priceless Shakespeare\r\nwas the free gift of nature, given altogether silently, received\r\naltogether silently.' Of his childhood history has almost nothing to\r\nrelate, and what is true of Shakespeare is true in large measure of\r\nBurns, of Shelley, of Keats. Even in an age when records are more\r\ncommon, we can only discern a little and can explain less of the silent\r\ninfluences at work that begin to make the man. There are few things more\r\nsurprising than that, in an age given up chiefly to industrial\r\ndevelopment, two prosperous middle-class homes should have given birth\r\nto John Ruskin and William Morris, so alien in temper to all that\r\ntraditionally springs from such a soil. In the case of Morris there is\r\nnothing known of his ancestry to explain his rich and various gifts.\r\nFrom a child he seemed to have found some spring within himself which\r\ndrew him instinctively to all that was beautiful in nature, in art, in\r\nbooks. His earliest companions were the Waverley Novels, which he began\r\nat the age of four and finished at seven; his earliest haunt was Epping\r\nForest, where he roamed and dreamed through many of the years of his\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nHis father, who was in business in the City of London, as partner in a\r\nbill-broking firm, lived at different times at Walthamstow and at\r\nWoodford; and the hills of the forest, in some places covered with thick\r\ngrowth of hornbeam or of beech, in others affording a wide view over the\r\nlevels of the lower Thames, impressed themselves so strongly on the\r\nboy's memory and imagination that this scenery often recurred in the\r\nsetting of tales which he wrote in middle life.\r\n\r\nThere was no need of external aid to develop these tastes; and Morris\r\nwas fortunate in going to a school which did no violence to them by\r\nforcing him into other less congenial pursuits. Marlborough College, at\r\nthe time when he went there in 1848, had only been open a few years. The\r\ngames were not organized but left to voluntary effort; and during his\r\nthree or four years at school Morris never took part in cricket or\r\nfootball. In the latter game, at any rate, he should have proved a\r\nnotable performer on unorthodox lines, impetuous, forcible, and burly\r\nas he was. But he found no reason to regret the absence of games, or to\r\nfeel that time hung heavy on his hands. The country satisfied his wants,\r\nthe Druidic stones at Avebury, the green water-meadows of the Kennet,\r\nthe deep glades of Savernake Forest. So strong was the spell of nature,\r\nthat he hardly felt the need for companionship; and, as chance had not\r\nyet thrown him into close relations with any friend of similar tastes,\r\nhe lived much alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a different matter at Oxford, to which he proceeded in January\r\n1853. Among those who matriculated at Exeter College that year was a\r\nfreshman from Birmingham named Edward Burne Jones; and within a few days\r\nMorris had begun a friendship with him which lasted for his whole life\r\nand was the source of his greatest happiness. For more than forty years\r\ntheir names were associated, and so they will remain for generations to\r\ncome in Exeter College Chapel, where may be seen the great tapestry of\r\nthe Nativity designed by one and executed by the other. Burne-Jones had\r\nnot yet found his vocation as a painter; he came to Oxford like Morris\r\nwith the wish to take Holy Orders. He was of Welsh family with a Celtic\r\nfervour for learning, and a Celtic instinct for what was beautiful, and\r\nat King Edward's School he had made friends with several men who came up\r\nto Pembroke College about the same time. Their friendship was extended\r\nto his new acquaintance from Marlborough. Here Morris found himself in\r\nthe midst of a small circle who shared his enthusiasm for literature and\r\nart, and among whom he quickly learned to express those ideas which had\r\nbeen stirring his heart in his solitary youth. Through the knowledge\r\ngained by close observation and a retentive memory, through his\r\nimpetuosity and swift decision, Morris soon became a leader among them.\r\nCarlyle and Ruskin, Keats and Tennyson, were at this time the most\r\npotent influences among them; and when Morris was not arguing and\r\ndeclaiming in the circle at Pembroke, he was sitting alone with\r\nBurne-Jones at Exeter reading aloud to him for hours together French\r\nromances and other mediaeval tales. Young men of to-day, with a wealth\r\nof books on their shelves and of pictures on their walls, with popular\r\nreproductions bringing daily to their doors things old and new, can\r\nlittle realize the thrill of excitement with which these men discovered\r\nand enjoyed a single new poem of Tennyson or an early drawing by Millais\r\nor Rossetti. How they were quickened by ever fresh delight in the beauty\r\nand strangeness of such things, how they responded to the magic of\r\nromance and dreamed of a day when they should themselves help in the\r\ncreation of such work, how they started a magazine of their own and\r\nessayed short flights in prose or verse, can best be read in the volumes\r\nwhich Lady Burne-Jones[50] has dedicated to the memory of her husband.\r\nThis period is of capital importance in the life of William Morris, and\r\nthe year 1855 especially was fraught with momentous decisions.\r\n\r\n[Note 50: _Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones_, by G. B.-J., 2 vols.\r\n(Macmillan, 1904).]\r\n\r\nLike Burne-Jones he had gone up to Oxford intending to take Holy Orders\r\nin the Church of England; but the last three years had taught him that\r\nhis interest lay elsewhere. The spirit of faith, of reverence, of love\r\nfor his fellow men still attracted him to Christianity; but he could not\r\nsubscribe to a body of doctrine or accept the authority of a single\r\nChurch. His ideal shifted gradually. At one time he hoped to found a\r\nbrotherhood which was to combine art with religion and to train\r\ncraftsmen for the service of the Church; but he was more fitted to work\r\nin the world than in the cloister, and the social aspect of this\r\nfoundation prevailed over the religious. Nor was it mere self-culture to\r\nwhich he aspired. The arts as he understood them were one field, and a\r\nwide field, for enlarging the powers of men and increasing their\r\nhappiness, for continuing all that was most precious in the heritage of\r\nthe past and passing on the torch to the future; in this field there was\r\nwork for many labourers and all might be serving the common good.\r\n\r\nHis own favourite study was the thirteenth century, when princes and\r\nmerchants, monks and friars, poets and craftsmen had combined to exalt\r\nthe Church and to beautify Western Europe; and he wished to recreate the\r\nnineteenth century in its spirit. And so while Burne-Jones discovered\r\nhis true gift in the narrower field of painting, Morris began his\r\napprenticeship in the master craft of architecture, and passed from one\r\nart to another till he had covered nearly the whole field of endeavour\r\nwith ever-growing knowledge of principle and restless activity of hand\r\nand eye. His father had died in 1847; and when Morris came of age he\r\ninherited a fortune of about £900 a year and was his own master. Before\r\nthe end of 1855 he imparted to his mother his decision about taking\r\nOrders. The Rubicon was crossed; but on which road he was to reach his\r\ngoal was not settled for many years. Twice he had to retrace his steps\r\nfrom a false start and begin a fresh career. The year 1856 saw him still\r\nworking at Oxford, in the office of Street, the architect. Two more\r\nyears (1857-8) saw him labouring at easel pictures under the influence\r\nof Rossetti, though he also published his first volume of poetry at this\r\ntime. The year 1859 found him married, and for the time absorbed in the\r\nmaking of a home, but still feeling his way towards the choice of a\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was in some ways the most original man of his\r\ngeneration; certainly he was the only individual whose influence was\r\never capable of dominating Morris and drawing him to a course of action\r\nwhich he would not have chosen for himself. Rossetti's tragic collapse\r\nafter his wife's death, and the pictures which he painted in his later\r\nlife, have obscured the true portrait of this virile and attractive\r\ncharacter. Burne-Jones fell completely under his spell, and he tells us\r\nhow for many years his chief anxiety, over each successive work of art\r\nthat he finished, was 'what Gabriel would have thought of it'. So\r\ndecisive was his judgement, so dominating his personality.\r\n\r\nMorris's period of hesitation ended in 1861, when the first firm of\r\ndecorators was started among the friends. Of the old Oxford set it\r\nincluded Burne-Jones and Faulkner; new elements were introduced by\r\nPhilip Webb the architect and Madox Brown the painter. The leadership in\r\nideas might still perhaps belong to Rossetti; but in execution William\r\nMorris proved himself at once the captain. The actual work which he\r\ncontributed in the first year was more than equal to that produced by\r\nhis six partners, and future years told the same tale.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of his married life Morris lived in Kent, at Upton,\r\nsome twelve miles from Charing Cross, in a house built for him by his\r\nfriend Webb. The house was of red brick, simple but unconventional in\r\ncharacter, built to be the home of one who detested stucco and all other\r\nshams, and wished things to seem what they were. Its decoration was to\r\nbe the work of its owner and his friends.\r\n\r\nHere we see Morris in the strength of early manhood and in all the\r\nexuberance of his rich vigorous nature, surrounded by friends for whom\r\nhe kept open house, in high contentment with life, eager to respond to\r\nall the claims upon his energy. Here came artists and poets, in the\r\npleasant summer days, jesting, dreaming, discussing, indulging in bouts\r\nof single-stick or game of bowls in the garden, walking through the\r\ncountry-side, quoting poets old and new, and scheming to cover the walls\r\nand cupboards of the rooms with the legends of mediaeval romance.\r\nVisitors of the conventional aesthetic type would have many a surprise\r\nand many a shock. The jests often took the form of practical jokes, of\r\nwhich Morris, from his explosive temper, was chosen to be the butt, but\r\nwhich in the end he always shared and enjoyed. Rossetti, Burne-Jones,\r\nand Faulkner would conspire to lay booby traps on the doors for him,\r\nwould insult him with lively caricatures, and with relentless humour\r\nwould send him to 'Coventry' for the duration of a dinner. Or he would\r\nhave a sudden tempestuous outbreak in which chairs would collapse and\r\ndoor panels be kicked in and violent expletives would resound through\r\nthe hall. In all, Morris was the central figure, impatient, boisterous,\r\nwith his thick-set figure, unkempt hair, and untidy clothing, but with\r\nthe keenest appreciation and sympathy for any manifestation of beauty in\r\nliterature or in art. But this idyll was short-lived. Ill-health in the\r\nBurne-Jones family was followed by an illness which befell Morris\r\nhimself; and the demand of the growing business and the need for the\r\nmaster to be nearer at hand forced him to leave Upton. The Red House was\r\nsold in 1865; and first Bloomsbury and later Hammersmith furnished him\r\nwith a home more conveniently placed.\r\n\r\nThe period of his return to London coincided with the most fruitful\r\nperiod of his poetic work. Already at Oxford he had written some pieces\r\nof verse which had found favour with his friends. He soon found that his\r\ntaste and his talent was for narrative poetry; and in 1856 he made\r\nacquaintance with his two supreme favourites, Chaucer and Malory. It is\r\nto them that he owes most in all that he produced in poetry or in prose,\r\nand notably in the _Earthly Paradise_, which he published between 1868\r\nand 1870. This consists of a collection of stories drawn chiefly from\r\nGreek sources, but supposed to be told by a band of wanderers in the\r\nfourteenth century. Thus the classic legends are seen through a veil of\r\nmediaeval romance. He had no wish to step back, in the spirit of a\r\nmodern scholar, across the ages of ignorance or mist, and to pick up\r\nthe classic stones clear-cut and cold as the Greeks left them. To him\r\nthe legends had a continuous history up to the Renaissance; as they were\r\nretold by Romans, Italians, or Provençals, they were as a plant growing\r\nin our gardens, still putting out fresh shoots, not an embalmed corpse\r\nsuch as later scholars have taught us to exhume and to study in the\r\nchill atmosphere of our libraries and museums. This mediaevalism of his\r\nwas much misunderstood, both in literature and in art; people would talk\r\nto him as if he were imitating the windows or tapestries of the Middle\r\nAges, whereas what he wanted was to recapture the technical secrets\r\nwhich the true craftsmen had known and then to use these methods in a\r\nlive spirit to carry on the work to fresh developments in the future.\r\n\r\nIf the French tales of the fourteenth century were an inspiration to him\r\nin his earliest poems, a second influence no less potent was that of the\r\nIcelandic Sagas. He began to study them in 1869, and a little later,\r\nwith the aid of Professor Magnusson, he was translating some of them\r\ninto English. He made two journeys to Iceland, and was deeply moved by\r\nthe wild grandeur of the scenes in which these heroic tales were set.\r\nFor many successive days he rode across grim solitary wastes with more\r\nenthusiasm than he could give to the wonted pilgrimages to Florence and\r\nVenice. When he was once under the spell, only the geysers with their\r\nsuggestion of modern text-books and _Mangnall's Questions_[51] could\r\nbore him; all else was magical and entrancing. This enthusiasm bore\r\nfruit in _Sigurd the Volsung_, the most powerful of his epic poems,\r\nwritten in an old English metre, which Morris, with true feeling for\r\ncraftsmanship, revived and adapted to his theme. His poetry in general,\r\nless rich than that of Tennyson, less intense than that of Rossetti,\r\nhad certain qualities of its own, and owed its popularity chiefly to his\r\ngift for telling a story swiftly, naturally and easily, and in such a\r\nway as to carry his reader along with him.\r\n\r\n[Note 51: Letter quoted in _Life of Morris_, by J. W. Mackail, vol.\r\ni, p. 257 (Longmans, Green & Co., 1911).]\r\n\r\nHis fame was growing in London, which was ready enough in the nineteenth\r\ncentury to make the most of its poets. In Society, if he had allowed it\r\nto entertain him, he would have been a picturesque figure, though hardly\r\nsuch as was expected by admirers of his poetry and his art. To some his\r\ndress suggested only the prosperous British workman; to one who knew him\r\nlater he seemed like 'the purser of a Dutch brig' in his blue tweed\r\nsailor-cut suit. This was his Socialist colleague Mr. Hyndman, who\r\ndescribes 'his imposing forehead and clear grey eyes with the powerful\r\nnose and slightly florid cheeks', and tells us how, when he was talking,\r\n'every hair of his head and his rough shaggy beard appeared to enter\r\ninto the subject as a living part of himself.' Elsewhere he speaks of\r\nMorris's 'quick, sharp manner, his impulsive gestures, his hearty\r\nlaughter and vehement anger'. At times Morris could be bluff beyond\r\nmeasure. Stopford Brooke, who afterwards became one of his friends,\r\nrecounts his first meeting with Morris in 1867. 'He didn't care for\r\nparsons, and he glared at me when I said something about good manners.\r\nLeaning over the table with his eyes set and his fist clenched he\r\nshouted at me, \"I am a boor and the son of a boor\".' So ready as he was\r\nto challenge anything which smacked of conventionality or pretension, he\r\nwas not quite a safe poet to lionize or to ask into mixed company.\r\n\r\nBut it was less in literature than in art that he influenced his\r\ngeneration, and we must return to the history of the firm. From small\r\nbeginnings it had established itself in the favourable esteem of the\r\nfew, and, thanks to exhibitions, its fame was spreading. Though as many\r\nas twelve branches are mentioned in a single copy of its prospectus,\r\nthere was generally one department which for the moment occupied most of\r\nthe creative energy of the chief.\r\n\r\nPainted glass is named first on the prospectus, and was one of the\r\nearlier successes of the firm. As it was employed for churches more\r\noften than for private houses, it is familiar to many who do not know\r\nMorris's work in their homes; but it is hardly the most characteristic\r\nof his activities. For one thing, the material, the 'pot glass', was\r\npurchased, not made on the premises. Morris's skill lay in selecting the\r\nbest colours available rather than in creating them himself. For\r\nanother, he knew that his own education in figure-drawing was\r\nincomplete, and he left this to other artists. Most of the figures were\r\ndesigned by Burne-Jones, and some of the best-known examples of his\r\nwindows are at St. Philip's, Birmingham, near the artist's birthplace,\r\nand at St. Margaret's, Rottingdean, where he died.[52] But no cartoon,\r\nby Burne-Jones or any one else, was executed till Morris had supervised\r\nthe colour scheme; and he often designed backgrounds of foliage or\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n[Note 52: Other easily accessible examples are in Christ Church\r\nCathedral, Oxford, and Jesus College Chapel, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nTo those people of limited means who cannot afford tapestries and\r\nembroidery (which follow painted glass on the firm's list), yet who wish\r\nto beautify their homes, interest centres in the chintzes and\r\nwall-papers. These show the distinctive gifts by which Morris most\r\nwidely influenced the Victorian traditions. It is not easy to explain\r\nwhy one design stirs our curiosity and quickens our delight, while\r\nanother has the opposite effect. Critics can prate about natural and\r\nconventional art without helping us to understand; but a passage from\r\nMr. Clutton-Brock seems worth quoting as simply and clearly phrased.[53]\r\n'Morris would start', he says, 'with a pattern in his mind and from the\r\nfirst saw everything as a factor in that pattern. But in these early\r\nwall-papers he showed a power of pattern-making that has never been\r\nequalled in modern times. For though everything is subject to the\r\npattern, yet the pattern itself expresses a keen delight in the objects\r\nof which it is composed. So they are like the poems in which the words\r\nkeep a precise and homely sense and yet in their combination make a\r\nmusic expressive of their sense.' Beginning with the design of the\r\nrose-trellis in 1862, Morris laid under contribution many of the most\r\nfamiliar flowers and trees. The daisy, the honeysuckle, the willow\r\nbranch, are but a few of the best known: each bears the stamp of his\r\ninventive fancy and his cunning hand: each flower claims recognition for\r\nitself, and reveals new charms in its appointed setting. Of these papers\r\nwe hear that Morris himself designed between seventy and eighty, and\r\nwhen we add chintzes, tapestry, and other articles we may well be\r\nastonished at the fertility of his brain.\r\n\r\n[Note 53: _William Morris_, by A. Clutton-Brock (Williams and\r\nNorgate, 1914).]\r\n\r\nEven so, much must have depended on his workmen as the firm's operations\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nMr. Mackail tells us of the faith which Morris had in the artistic\r\npowers of the average Englishman, if rightly trained. He was ready to\r\ntake and train the boy whom he found nearest to hand, and he often\r\nachieved surprising results. His own belief was that a good tradition\r\nonce established in the workshops, by which the workman was allowed to\r\ndevelop his intelligence, would of itself produce good work: others\r\nbelieved that the successes would have been impossible without the\r\nunique gifts of the master, one of which was that he could intuitively\r\nselect the right man for each job.\r\n\r\nThe material as well as the workers needed this selective power. The\r\nfactories of the day had accustomed the public to second-rate material\r\nand second-rate colour, and Morris was determined to set a higher\r\nstandard. In 1875 he was absorbed in the production of vegetable dyes,\r\nwhich he insisted on having pure and rich in tone. Though madder and\r\nweld might supply the reds and yellows which he needed, blue was more\r\ntroublesome. For a time he accepted prussian blue, but he knew that\r\nindigo was the right material, and to indigo he gave days of\r\nconcentrated work, preparing and watching the vats, dipping the wool\r\nwith his own hands (which often bore the stain of work for longer than\r\nhe wished), superintending the minutest detail and refusing to be\r\ncontent with anything short of the best. But these two qualities of\r\nindustry and of aiming at a high standard would not have carried him so\r\nfar if he had not added exceptional gifts of nature. With him hand and\r\neye worked together as in few craftsmen of any age; and thus he could\r\ncarry his experiments to a successful end, choosing his material, mixing\r\nhis colours, and timing his work with exact felicity. And when he had\r\nfound the right way he had the rare skill to communicate his knowledge\r\nto others and thus to train them for the work.\r\n\r\nQueen Square, Bloomsbury, was the first scene of his labours; but as the\r\nfirm prospered and the demands for their work grew, Morris found the\r\npremises too small. At one time he had hopes of finding a suitable spot\r\nnear the old cloth-working towns at the foot of the Cotswolds, where\r\npure air and clear water were to be found; but the conditions of trade\r\nmade it necessary for him to be nearer to London. In 1881 he bought an\r\nold silk-weaving mill at Merton near Wimbledon, on the banks of the\r\nWandle, and this is still the centre of the work.\r\n\r\nTo study special industries, or to execute a special commission, he was\r\noften obliged to make long journeys to the north of England or\r\nelsewhere; but the routine of his life consisted in daily travelling\r\nbetween his house at Hammersmith and the mills at Merton, which was\r\nmore tiresome than it is to-day owing to the absence of direct connexion\r\nbetween these districts. But his energy overbore these obstacles; and,\r\nexcept when illness prevented him, he remained punctual in his\r\nattendance to business and in close touch with all his workers. Towards\r\nthem Morris was habitually generous. The weaker men were kept on and\r\npaid by time, long after they had ceased to produce remunerative work,\r\nwhile the more capable were in course of time admitted as profit-sharers\r\ninto the business. Every man who worked under him had to be prepared for\r\noccasional outbursts of impatient temper, when Morris spoke, we are\r\ntold, rather as a good workman scornful of bad work, than as an employer\r\nfinding fault with his men; but in the long run all were sure to receive\r\nfair and friendly treatment.\r\n\r\nSuch was William Morris at his Merton works, a master craftsman worthy\r\nof the best traditions of the Middle Ages, fit to hold his place with\r\nthe masons of Chartres, the weavers of Bruges, and the wood-carvers of\r\nNuremberg. As a manager of a modern industrial firm competing with\r\nothers for profit he was less successful. The purchasing of the best\r\nmaterial, the succession of costly experiments, the 'scrapping' of all\r\nimperfect work, meant a heavy drain on the capital. Also the society had\r\nbeen hurriedly formed without proper safeguards for fairly recompensing\r\nthe various members according to their work; and when in 1875 it was\r\nfound necessary to reconstitute it, that Morris might legally hold the\r\nposition which he had from the outset won by his exertions, this could\r\nnot be effected without loss, nor without a certain friction between the\r\npartners. So, however prosperous the business might seem to be through\r\nits monopoly of certain wares, it was difficult even for a skilful\r\nfinancier to make on each year a profit which was in any way\r\nproportionate to the fame of the work produced. But in 1865 Morris was\r\nfortunate in finding a friend ready to undertake the keeping of the\r\nbooks, who sympathized with his aims and whose gifts supplemented his\r\nown; and, for the rest, he had read and digested the work of Ruskin, and\r\nhad learnt from him that the function of the true merchant was to\r\nproduce goods of the best quality, and only secondarily to produce a\r\nprofitable balance-sheet.\r\n\r\nHow it was that from being the head of an industrial business Morris\r\ncame to be an ardent advocate of Socialism is the central problem of his\r\nlife. The root of the matter lay in his love of art and of the Middle\r\nAges. He had studied the centuries productive of the best art known to\r\nhim, and he believed that he understood the conditions under which it\r\nwas produced. The one essential was that the workers found pleasure in\r\ntheir work. They were not benumbed by that Division of Labour which set\r\nthe artisan laboriously repeating the same mechanical task; they worked\r\nat the bidding of no master jealously measuring time, material, and\r\nprice against his competitors; they passed on from one generation to\r\nanother the tradition of work well done for its own sake. He knew there\r\nwas another side to the picture, and that in many ways the freedom of\r\nthe mediaeval craftsman had been curtailed. He did not ask history to\r\nrun backwards, but he felt that the nineteenth century was advancing on\r\nthe wrong line of progress. To him there seemed to be three types of\r\nsocial framework. The feudal or Tory type was past and obsolete; for the\r\nricher classes of to-day had neither the power nor the will to renew it.\r\nThe Whig or Manchester ideal held the field, the rich employer regarding\r\nhis workmen as so many hands capable of producing so much work and so\r\nmuch profit, and believing that free bargaining between free men must\r\nyield the best economic results for all classes, and that beyond\r\neconomic and political liberty the State had no more to give, and a man\r\nmust be left to himself. Against this doctrine emphatic protests had\r\nbeen uttered in widely differing forms by Carlyle and Disraeli, by\r\nRuskin and Dickens; but it was slow to die.\r\n\r\nThe third ideal was that of the Socialist; and to Morris this meant that\r\nthe State should appropriate the means of production and should so\r\narrange that every worker was assured of the means of livelihood and of\r\nsufficient leisure to enjoy the fruits of what he had made. He who could\r\nlive so simply himself thought more of the unjust distribution of\r\nhappiness than of wealth, as may be seen in his _News from Nowhere_,\r\nwhere he gives a Utopian picture of England as it was to be after the\r\nestablishment of Socialism. Here rather than in polemical speeches or\r\npamphlets can we find the true reflection of his attitude and the way in\r\nwhich he thought about reform.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for him to embark on such a crusade. In his early\r\nmanhood, except for his volunteering in the war scare of 1859, he had\r\ntaken no part in public life. The first cause which led to his appearing\r\nat meetings was wrath at the ill-considered restoration of old\r\nbuildings. In 1877, when a society was formed for their protection,\r\nMorris was one of the leaders, and took his stand by Ruskin, who had\r\nalready stated the principles to be observed. They believed that the\r\npresentation of nineteenth-century masonry in the guise of mediaeval\r\nwork was a fraud on the public, that it obscured the true lessons of the\r\npast, and that, under the pretence of reviving the original design, it\r\nmarred the development which had naturally gone forward through the\r\ncenturies. It was from his respect for work and the workman that Morris\r\ndenounced this pedantry, from his love of stones rightly hewn and laid,\r\nof carving which the artist had executed unconsciously in the spirit of\r\nhis time, and which was now being replaced by lifeless imitation to the\r\norder of a bookish antiquary. Against this he was ready to protest at\r\nall times, and references to meetings of 'Antiscrape', as he calls the\r\nsociety, are frequent in his letters. He also was rigid in declining all\r\norders to the firm where his own decorations might seem to disturb the\r\nrelics of the past.\r\n\r\nHis next step was still more difficult. The plunge of a famous poet and\r\nartist into agitation, of a capitalist and employer into Socialism,\r\nprovoked much wonder and many indignant protests. His severer critics\r\nseized on any pamphlet of his in which they could detect logical\r\nfallacies and scornfully asked whether this was fit work for the author\r\nof the _Earthly Paradise_. Many liberal-minded people indeed regretted\r\nthe diversion of his activities, but the question whether he was wasting\r\nthem is one that needs consideration; and to judge him fairly we must\r\nlook at the problem from his side and postulate that Socialism (whether\r\nhe interpreted its theories aright or not) did pursue practical ideals.\r\nIf Aeschylus was more proud of fighting at Marathon than of writing\r\ntragedies--if Socrates claimed respect as much for his firmness as a\r\njuryman as for his philosophic method--surely Morris might believe that\r\nhis duty to his countrymen called him to leave his study and his\r\nworkshop to take an active part in public affairs. He might be more\r\nprone to error than those who had trained themselves to political life,\r\nbut he faced the problems honestly and sacrificed his comfort for the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nCriticism took a still more personal turn in the hands of those who\r\npointed out that Morris himself occupied the position of a capitalist\r\nemployer, and who asked him to live up to his creed by divesting himself\r\nof his property and taking his place in the ranks of the proletariat.\r\nThis argument is dealt with by Mr. Mackail,[54] who describes the steps\r\nwhich Morris took to admit his foremen to sharing the profits of the\r\nbusiness, and defends him against the charge of inconsistency. Morris\r\nmay not have thought out the question in all its aspects, but much of\r\nthe criticism passed upon him was even more illogical and depended on\r\nfar too narrow and illiterate a use of the word Socialism. He knew as\r\nwell as his critics that no new millennium could be introduced by merely\r\ntaking the wealth of the rich and dividing it into equal portions among\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\n[Note 54: _Life of Morris_, by J. W. Mackail, vol. ii, pp. 133-9.]\r\n\r\nHowever reluctant Morris might be to leave his own work for public\r\nagitation, he plunged into the Socialist campaign with characteristic\r\nenergy. For two or three years he was constantly devoting his Sundays to\r\nopen-air speech-making, his evenings to thinly-attended meetings in\r\nstuffy rooms in all the poorer parts of London; and, at the call of\r\ncomrades, he often travelled into the provinces, and even as far as\r\nScotland, to lend a hand. And he spent time and money prodigally in\r\nsupporting journals which were to spread the special doctrines of his\r\nform of Socialism. Nor was it only the indifference and the hostility of\r\nthose outside which he had to meet; quarrels within the party were\r\nfrequent and bitter, though Morris himself, despite his impetuous\r\ntemper, showed a wonderful spirit of brotherliness and conciliation. For\r\ntwo years his work lay with the Socialist Democratic Federation, till\r\ndifferences of opinion with Mr. Hyndman drove him to resign; in 1885 he\r\nfounded the Socialist League, and for this he toiled, writing, speaking,\r\nand attending committees, till 1889, when the control was captured by a\r\nknot of anarchists, in spite of all his efforts. After this he ceased to\r\nbe a 'militant'; but in no way did he abandon his principles or despair\r\nof the ultimate triumph of the cause. The result of his efforts must\r\nremain unknown. If the numbers of his audiences were often\r\ninsignificant, and the visible outcome discouraging to a degree, yet in\r\nestimating the value of personal example no outward test can satisfy us.\r\nHe gave of his best with the same thoroughness as in all his crafts, and\r\nno man can do more. But, looking at the matter from a regard to his\r\nspecial gifts and to his personal happiness, we may be glad that his\r\nactive connexion with Socialism ceased in 1889, and that he was granted\r\nseven years of peace before the end.\r\n\r\nThese were the years that saw the birth and growth of the 'Kelmscott'\r\nprinting press, so called after his country house. Of illuminated\r\nmanuscripts[55] he had always been fond, but it was only in 1888 that\r\nhis attention was turned to details of typography. The mere study of old\r\nand new founts did not satisfy him for long; the creative impulse\r\ndemanded that he should design types of his own and produce his own\r\nbooks. As in the other arts, his lifelong friend Burne-Jones was called\r\nin to supply figure drawings for the illustrated books which Morris was\r\nhimself to adorn with decorative borders and initials. Of his many\r\nschemes, not all came to fruition; but after four years of planning, and\r\na year and a half given to the actual process of printing, his\r\nmasterpiece, the Kelmscott edition of Chaucer, was completed, and a copy\r\nwas in his hands a few months before his death.\r\n\r\n[Note 55: Mr. Hyndman (_Story of an Adventurous Life_, p. 355)\r\ndescribes a visit to the Bodleian Library at Oxford with Morris, and how\r\n'quickly, carefully, and surely' he dated the illuminated manuscripts.]\r\n\r\nThe last seven years of his life were spent partly at Hammersmith and\r\npartly at Kelmscott, the old manor house, lying on the banks of the\r\nUpper Thames, which he had tenanted since 1878. He had never been a\r\ngreat traveller, dearly though he loved the north of France with its\r\nGothic cathedrals and 'the river bottoms with the endless poplar forests\r\nand the green green meadows'. His tastes were very individual. Iceland\r\nmade stronger appeals to him than Greece or Rome; and even at Florence\r\nand Venice he was longing to return to England and its homely familiar\r\nscenes. Scotland with its bare hills, 'raw-boned' as he called it, never\r\ngave him much pleasure; for he liked to see the earth clothed by nature\r\nand by the hand of man. By the Upper Thames, at the foot of the\r\nCotswolds, the buildings of the past were still generally untouched; and\r\nbeyond the orchards and gardens, with their old-world look, lay\r\nstretches of meadows, diversified by woods and low hills, haunted with\r\nthe song of birds; and he could believe himself still to be in the\r\nEngland of Chaucer and Shakespeare. There he would always welcome the\r\nfriends whom he loved and who loved him; but to the world at large he\r\nwas a recluse. His abrupt manner, his Johnsonian utterances, would have\r\nmade him a disconcerting element in Victorian tea-parties. When provoked\r\nby foolish utterances, he was, no less than Johnson, downright in\r\ncontradiction. There was nothing that he disliked so much as being\r\nlionized; and there was much to annoy him when he stepped outside his\r\nown home and circle. His last public speech was made on the abuses of\r\npublic advertisement; and in the last year of his life we hear him\r\ngrowling in Ruskinian fashion that he was ever 'born with a sense of\r\nromance and beauty in this accursed age'.\r\n\r\nHis life had been a strenuous and exhausting one, but he enjoyed it to\r\nthe last. As he said to Hyndman ten days before the end, 'It has been a\r\njolly good world to me when all is said, and I don't wish to leave it\r\nyet awhile'. At least his latter years had been years of peace. He had\r\nbeen freed from the stress of conflict; he had found again the joys of\r\nyouth, and could recapture the old music.\r\n\r\n    The days have slain the days, and the seasons have gone by\r\n    And brought me the summer again; and here on the grass I lie\r\n    As erst I lay and was glad, ere I meddled with right and wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter an illness in 1891 he never had quite the same physical vigour,\r\nthough he continued to employ himself fully for some years in a way\r\nwhich would tax the energy of many robust men. In 1895 the vital energy\r\nwas failing, and he was content to relax his labours. In August 1896 he\r\nwas suffering from congestion of the lungs, and in October he died\r\npeacefully at Hammersmith, attended by the loving care of his wife and\r\nhis oldest friends. The funeral at Kelmscott was remarkable for\r\nsimplicity and beauty, the coffin being borne along the country road in\r\na farm wagon strewn with leaves; and he lies in the quiet churchyard\r\namid the meadows and orchards which he loved so well.\r\n\r\nAmong the prophets and poets who took up their parable against the\r\nworship of material wealth and comfort, he will always have a foremost\r\nplace. The thunder of Carlyle, the fiery eloquence of Ruskin, the\r\ndelicate irony of Matthew Arnold, will find a responsive echo in the\r\nheart of one reader or another; will expose the false standards of life\r\nset up in a materialistic age and educate them in the pursuit of what is\r\ntrue, what is beautiful, and what is reasonable. But to men who work\r\nwith their hands there must always be something specially inspiring in\r\nthe life and example of one who was a handicraftsman and so much beside.\r\nAnd Morris was not content to denounce and to despair. He enjoyed what\r\nwas good in the past and the present, and he preached in a hopeful\r\nspirit a gospel of yet better things for the future. He was an artist in\r\nliving. Amid all the diversity of his work there was an essential unity\r\nin his life. The men with whom he worked were the friends whom he\r\nwelcomed in his leisure; the crafts by which he made his wealth were the\r\npastimes over which he talked and thought in his home; his dreams for\r\nthe future were framed in the setting of the mediaeval romances which he\r\nloved from his earliest days. Though he lived often in an atmosphere of\r\nconflict, and often knew failure, he has left us an example which may\r\nhelp to fill the emptiness and to kindle the lukewarmness of many an\r\nunquiet heart, and may reconcile the discords that mar the lives of too\r\nmany of his countrymen in this age of transition and of doubt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN RICHARD GREEN\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Frederick Sandys]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RICHARD GREEN\r\n\r\n1837-83\r\n\r\n1837.

Death, March 7.\r\n\r\nJOHN RICHARD GREEN\r\n\r\nHISTORIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century did some things with a splendour and a\r\ncompleteness which is the despair of later, more restlessly striving\r\ngenerations. Barren though it was of poetry and high imagination, it\r\ngave birth to our most famous works in political economy, in biography,\r\nand in history; and it has set up for us classic models of imperishable\r\nfame. But the wisdom of Adam Smith, the shrewd observation of Boswell,\r\nthe learning of Gibbon, did not readily find their way into the\r\nmarket-place. Outside of the libraries and the booksellers' rows in\r\nLondon and Edinburgh they were in slight demand. Even when the volumes\r\nof Gibbon, Hume, and Robertson had been added to the library shelves,\r\nwhere Clarendon and Burnet reigned before them, too often they only\r\npassed to a state of dignified retirement and slumber. No hand disturbed\r\nthem save that of the conscientious housemaid who dusted them in due\r\nseason. They were part of the furnishings indispensable to the elegance\r\nof a 'gentleman's seat'; and in many cases the guests, unless a Gibbon\r\nwere among them, remained ignorant whether the labels on their backs\r\ntold a truthful tale, or whether they disguised an ingenious box or\r\nbackgammon board, or formed a mere covering to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe fault was with the public more than with the authors. Those who\r\nventured on the quest would find noble eloquence in Clarendon, lively\r\nnarrative in Burnet, critical analysis in Hume; but the indolence of the\r\nUniversities and the ignorance of the general public unfitted them for\r\nthe effort required to value a knowledge of history or to take steps to\r\nacquire it. It is true that the majestic style of Clarendon was puzzling\r\nto a generation accustomed to prose of the fashion inaugurated by Dryden\r\nand Addison; and that Hume and other historians, with all their\r\nprecision and clearness, were wanting in fervour and imagination. But\r\nthe record of English history was so glorious, so full of interest for\r\nthe patriot and for the politician, that it should have spoken for\r\nitself, and the apathy of the educated classes was not creditable to\r\nthem. Even so Ezekiel found the Israelites of his day, forgetful of\r\ntheir past history and its lessons, sunk in torpor and indifference. He\r\nlooked upon the wreckage of his nation, settled in the Babylonian plain;\r\nin his fervent imagination he saw but a valley of dry bones, and called\r\naloud to the four winds that breath should come into them and they\r\nshould live.\r\n\r\nIn our islands the prophets who wielded the most potent spell came from\r\nbeyond the Border. Walter Scott exercised the wider influence, Carlyle\r\nkindled the intenser flame. As artists they followed very different\r\nmethods. Scott, like a painter, wielding a vigorous brush full charged\r\nwith human sympathies, set before us a broad canvas in lively colours\r\nfilled with a warm diffused light. Carlyle worked more in the manner of\r\nan etcher, the mordant acid eating deep into the plate. From the depth\r\nof his shadows would stand out single figures or groups, in striking\r\ncontrast, riveting the attention and impressing themselves on the\r\nmemory. Scott drew thousands of readers to sympathize with the men and\r\nwomen of an earlier day, and to feel the romance that attaches to lost\r\ncauses in Church and State. Carlyle set scores of students striving to\r\nrecreate the great men of the past and by their standards to reject the\r\nshibboleths of the present. However different were the methods of the\r\nenchanters, the dry bones had come to life. Mediaeval abbot and\r\ncrusader, cavalier and covenanter, Elizabeth and Cromwell, spoke once\r\nmore with a living voice to ears which were opened to hear.\r\n\r\nNor did the English Universities fail to send forth men who could meet\r\nthe demands of a generation which was waking up to a healthier political\r\nlife. The individual who achieved most in popularizing English history\r\nwas Macaulay, who began to write his famous Essays in 1825, the year\r\nafter he won his fellowship at Trinity, though the world had to wait\r\nanother twenty-five years for his History of the English Revolution.\r\nSince then Cambridge historians like Acton, or Maitland, have equalled\r\nor excelled him in learning, though none has won such brilliant success.\r\nBut it was the Oxford School which did most, in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, to clear up the dark places of our national record\r\nand to present a complete picture of the life of the English people.\r\nFreeman delved long among the chronicles of Normans and Saxons; Stubbs\r\nno less laboriously excavated the charters of the Plantagenets; Froude\r\nhewed his path through the State papers of the Tudors; while Gardiner\r\npatiently unravelled the tangled skein of Stuart misgovernment. John\r\nRichard Green, one of the youngest of the school, took a wider subject,\r\nthe continuous history of the English people. He was fortunate in\r\nwriting at a time when the public was prepared to find the subject\r\ninteresting, but he himself did wonders in promoting this interest, and\r\nsince then his work has been a lamp to light teachers on the way.\r\n\r\nIn a twofold way Green may claim to be a child of Oxford. Not only was\r\nhe a member of the University, but he was a native of the town, being\r\nborn in the centre of that ancient city in the year of Queen Victoria's\r\naccession. His family had been engaged in trade there for two\r\ngenerations without making more than a competence; and even before his\r\nfather died in 1852 they were verging on poverty. Of his parents, who\r\nwere kind and affectionate, but not gifted with special talents, there\r\nis little to be told; the boy was inclined, in after life, to attribute\r\nany literary taste that he may have inherited to his mother. From his\r\nearliest days reading was his passion, and he was rarely to be seen\r\nwithout a book. Old church architecture and the sound of church bells\r\nalso kindled his childish enthusiasms, and he would hoard his pence to\r\npurchase the joy of being admitted into a locked-up church. So he was\r\nfortunate in being sent at the age of eight to Magdalen College School,\r\nwhere he had daily access to the old buildings of the College and the\r\nbeautiful walks which had been trodden by the feet of Addison a century\r\nand a half before. An amusing contrast could be drawn between the\r\ndecorous scholar of the seventeenth century, handsome, grave of mien,\r\ncalmly pacing the gravel walk, while he tasted the delights of classic\r\nliterature, and little 'Johnny Green', a mere shrimp of a boy with\r\nbright eyes and restless ways, darting here and there, eagerly searching\r\nfor anything new or exciting which he might find, whether in the bushes\r\nor in the pages of some romance which he was carrying.\r\n\r\nBut, for all his lively curiosity, Green seems to have got little out of\r\nhis lessons at school. The classic languages formed the staple of his\r\neducation, and he never had that power of verbal memory which could\r\nenable him to retain the rules of the Greek grammar or to handle the\r\nLatin language with the accuracy of a scholar. He soon gave up trying to\r\ndo so. Instead of aspiring to the mastery of accidence and syntax, he\r\naimed rather at securing immunity from the rod. At Magdalen School it\r\nwas still actively in use; but there were certain rules about the number\r\nof offences which must be committed in a given time to call for its\r\napplication. Green was clever enough to notice this, and to shape his\r\ncourse accordingly; and thus his lessons became, from a sporting point\r\nof view, an unqualified success.\r\n\r\nBut his real progress in learning was due to his use of the old library\r\nin his leisure hours. Here he made acquaintance with Marco Polo and\r\nother books of travel; here he read works on history of various kinds,\r\nand became prematurely learned in the heresies of the early Church. The\r\nviews which he developed, and perhaps stated too crudely, did not win\r\napproval. He was snubbed by examiners for his interest in heresiarchs,\r\nand gravely reproved by Canon Mozley[56] for justifying the execution of\r\nCharles I. The latter subject had been set for a prize essay; and the\r\nCanon was fair-minded enough to give the award to the boy whose views he\r\ndisliked, but whose merit he recognized. Partial and imperfect though\r\nthis education was, the years spent under the shadow of Magdalen must\r\nhave had a deep influence on Green; but he tells us little of his\r\nimpressions, and was only half conscious of them at the time. The\r\nincident which perhaps struck him most was his receiving a prize from\r\nthe hands of the aged Dr. Routh, President of the College, who had seen\r\nDr. Johnson in his youth, and lived to be a centenarian and the pride of\r\nOxford in early Victorian days.\r\n\r\n[Note 56: Rev. J. B. Mozley, 1813-78. Canon of Worcester and Regius\r\nProfessor of Divinity at Oxford: a Tractarian; author of essays on\r\nStrafford, Laud, &c.]\r\n\r\nGreen's school life ended in 1852, the year in which his father died. He\r\nwas already at the top of the school; and to win a scholarship at the\r\nUniversity was now doubly important for him. This he achieved at Jesus\r\nCollege, Oxford, in December 1854, after eighteen months spent with a\r\nprivate tutor; and, as he was too young to go into residence at once, he\r\ncontinued for another year to read by himself. Though he gave closer\r\nattention to his classics he did not drop his general reading; and it\r\nwas a landmark in his career when at the age of sixteen he made\r\nacquaintance with Gibbon.\r\n\r\nHis life as an undergraduate was not very happy and was even less\r\nsuccessful than his days at school, though the fault did not lie with\r\nhim. Shy and sensitive as he was, he had a sociable disposition and was\r\nnaturally fitted to make friends. But he had come from a solitary life\r\nat a tutor's to a college where the men were clannish, most of them\r\nWelshmen, and few of them disposed to look outside their own circle for\r\nfriends. Had Green been as fortunate as William Morris, his life at\r\nOxford might have been different; but there was no Welshman at Jesus of\r\nthe calibre of Burne-Jones; and Green lived in almost complete isolation\r\ntill the arrival of Boyd Dawkins in 1857. The latter, who became in\r\nafter years a well-known professor of anthropology, was Green's first\r\nreal friend, and the letters which he wrote to him show how necessary it\r\nwas for Green to have one with whom he could share his interests and\r\nexchange views freely. Dawkins had the scientific, Green the literary,\r\nnature and gifts; but they had plenty of common ground and were always\r\nready to explore the records of the past, whether they were to be found\r\nin barrows, in buildings, or in books. If Dawkins was the first friend,\r\nthe first teacher who influenced him was Arthur Stanley, then Canon of\r\nChrist Church and Professor of Ecclesiastical History. An accident led\r\nGreen into his lecture-room one day; but he was so much delighted with\r\nthe spirit of Stanley's teaching, and the life which he imparted to\r\nhistory, that he became a constant member of the class. And when Stanley\r\nmade overtures of friendship, Green welcomed them warmly.\r\n\r\nA new influence had come into his life. Not only was his industry, which\r\nhad been feeble and irregular, stimulated at last to real effort; but\r\nhis attitude to religious questions and to the position of the English\r\nChurch was at this time sensibly modified. He had come up to the\r\nUniversity a High Churchman; like many others at the time of the Oxford\r\nMovement, he had been led half-way towards Roman Catholicism, stirred by\r\nthe historical claims and the mystic spell of Rome. But from now\r\nonwards, under the guidance of Stanley and Maurice, he adopted the views\r\nof what is called the 'Broad Church Party', which suited his moral\r\nfervour and the liberal character of his social and political opinions.\r\n\r\nDespite, however, the stimulus given to him (perhaps too late) by\r\nDawkins and Stanley, Green won no distinctions at the University, and\r\nfew men of his day could have guessed that he would ever win distinction\r\nelsewhere. He took a dislike to the system of history-teaching then in\r\nvogue, which consisted in demanding of all candidates for the schools a\r\nknowledge of selected fragments of certain authors, giving them no\r\nchoice or scope in the handling of wider subjects. He refused to enter\r\nfor a class in the one subject in which he could shine, and managed to\r\nscrape through his examination by combining a variety of uncongenial\r\nsubjects. This was perverse, and he himself recognized it to be so\r\nafterwards. All the while there was latent in him the talent, and the\r\nambition, which might have enabled him to surpass all his\r\ncontemporaries. His one literary achievement of the time was unknown to\r\nthe men of his college, but it is of singular interest in view of what\r\nhe came to achieve later. He was asked by the editor of the _Oxford\r\nChronicle_, an old-established local paper, to write two articles on the\r\nhistory of the city of Oxford. To most undergraduates the town seemed a\r\nmere parasite of the University; to Green it was an elder sister. Many\r\nyears later he complained in one of his letters that the city had been\r\nstifled by the University, which in its turn had suffered similar\r\ntreatment from the Church. To this task, accordingly, he brought a ready\r\nenthusiasm and a full mind; and his articles are alive with the essence\r\nof what, since the days of his childhood, he had observed, learnt, and\r\nimagined, in the town of his birth. We see the same spirit in a letter\r\nwhich he wrote to Dawkins in 1860, telling him how he had given up a day\r\nto following the Mayor of Oxford when he observed the time-honoured\r\ncustom of beating the bounds of the city. He describes with gusto how he\r\ntrudged along roads, clambered over hedges, and even waded through\r\nmarshes in order to perform the rite with scrupulous thoroughness. But\r\nit was years before he could find an audience who would appreciate his\r\npower of handling such a subject, and his University career must, on his\r\nown evidence, be written down a failure.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over he was confronted with the need for choosing a\r\nprofession. It had strained the resources of his family to give him a\r\ngood education, and now he must fend for himself. To a man of his nature\r\nand upbringing the choice was not wide. His age and his limited means\r\nput the Services out of the question; nor was he fitted to embark in\r\ntrade. Medicine would revolt his sensibility, law would chill his\r\nimagination, and journalism did not yet exist as a profession for men of\r\nhis stamp. In the teaching profession, for which he had such rare gifts,\r\nhe would start handicapped by his low degree. In any case, he had for\r\nsome time cherished the idea of taking Holy Orders. The ministry of the\r\nChurch would give him a congenial field of work and, so he hoped, some\r\nleisure to continue his favourite studies. Perhaps he had not the same\r\nstrong conviction of a 'call' as many men of his day in the High Church\r\nor Evangelical parties; but he was, at the time, strongly drawn by the\r\nexample and teaching of Stanley and Maurice, and he soon showed that it\r\nwas not merely for negative reasons or from half-hearted zeal that he\r\nhad made the choice. When urged by Stanley to seek a curacy in West\r\nLondon, he deliberately chose the East End of the town because the need\r\nthere was greater and the training in self-sacrifice was sterner; and\r\nthere is no doubt that the popular sympathies, which the reading of\r\nhistory had already implanted in him, were nourished and strengthened by\r\nnine years of work among the poor. The exertion of parish work taxed his\r\nphysical resources, and he was often incapacitated for short periods by\r\nthe lavish way in which he spent himself. Indeed, but for this constant\r\ndrain upon his strength, he might have lived a longer life and left more\r\nwork behind him.\r\n\r\nOf the parishes which he served, the last and the most interesting was\r\nSt. Philip's, Stepney, to which he went from Hoxton in 1864. It was a\r\nparish of 16,000 souls, lying between Whitechapel and Poplar, not far\r\nfrom the London Docks. Dreary though the district seems to us\r\nto-day--and at times Green was fully conscious of this--he could\r\nre-people it in imagination with the men of the past, and find pleasure\r\nin the noble views on the river and the crowded shipping that passed so\r\nnear its streets. But above all he found a source of interest in the\r\nliving individuals whom he met in his daily round and who needed his\r\nhelp; and though he achieved signal success in the pulpit by his power\r\nof extempore preaching, he himself cared more for the effect of his\r\nvisiting and other social work. Sermons might make an impression for the\r\nmoment; personal sympathy, shown in the moment when it was needed, might\r\nchange the whole current of a life.\r\n\r\nFor children his affection was unfailing; and for the humours of older\r\npeople he had a wide tolerance and charity. His letters abound with\r\nreferences to this side of his work. He tells us of his 'polished' pork\r\nbutcher and his learned parish clerk, and boasts how he won the regard\r\nof the clerk's Welsh wife by correctly pronouncing the magic name of\r\nMachynlleth. He gave a great deal of time to his parishioners, to\r\nconsulting his churchwardens, to starting choirs, to managing classes\r\nand parish expeditions. He could find time to attend a morning police\r\ncourt when one of his boys got into difficulties, or to hold a midnight\r\nservice for the outcasts of the pavement.\r\n\r\nWhen cholera broke out in Stepney in 1866, Green visited the sick and\r\ndying in rooms that others did not dare to enter, and was not afraid to\r\nhelp actively in burying those who had died of the disease. At holiday\r\ngatherings he was the life and soul of the body, 'shocking two prim\r\nmaiden teachers by starting kiss-in-the-ring', and surprising his most\r\nvigorous helpers by his energy and decision. On such occasions he\r\nexhausted himself in the task of leadership, and he was no less generous\r\nin giving financial help to every parish institution that was in need.\r\n\r\nWhat hours he could snatch from these tasks he would spend in the\r\nReading Room of the British Museum; but these were all too few. His\r\nposition, within a few miles of the treasure houses of London, and of\r\nfriends who might have shared his studies, must have been tantalizing\r\nto a degree. To parish claims also was sacrificed many a chance of a\r\nprecious holiday. We have one letter in which he regretfully abandons\r\nthe project of a tour with Freeman in his beloved Anjou because he finds\r\nthat the only dates open to his companion clash with the festival of the\r\npatron saint of his church. In another he resists the appeal of Dawkins\r\nto visit him in Somerset on similar grounds. His friend may become\r\nabusive, but Green assures him emphatically that it cannot be helped. 'I\r\nam not a pig,' he writes; 'I am a missionary curate.... I could not come\r\nto you, because I was hastily summoned to the cure of 5,000\r\ncostermongers and dock labourers.' We are far from the easy standard of\r\nwork too often accepted by 'incumbents' in the opening years of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nEarly in his clerical career he had begun to form plans for writing on\r\nhistorical subjects, most of which had to be abandoned for one reason or\r\nanother. At one time he was planning with Dawkins a history of Somerset,\r\nwhich would have been a forerunner of the County Histories of the\r\ntwentieth century. Dawkins was to do the geology and anthropology; Green\r\nwould contribute the archaeology and history. In many ways they were\r\nwell equipped for the task; but the materials had not been sifted and\r\nthe demands on their time would have been excessive, even if they\r\nabstained from all other work. Another scheme was for a series of Lives\r\nof the Archbishops of Canterbury. Green was much attracted by the\r\nsubject. Already he had made a special study of Dunstan and other great\r\nholders of the See; and he believed that the series would illustrate,\r\nbetter than the lives of kings, the growth of certain principles in\r\nEnglish history. But with other archbishops he found himself out of\r\nsympathy; and in the end he was not sorry to abandon the idea, when he\r\nfound that Dean Hook was already engaged upon it.\r\n\r\nA project still nearer to his heart, which he cherished till near the\r\nend of his life, was to write a history of our Angevin kings. For this\r\nhe collected a vast quantity of materials, and it was a task for which\r\nhe was peculiarly fitted. It would be difficult to say whether Fulc\r\nNerra, the founder of the dynasty, or Black Angers, the home of the\r\nrace, was more vividly present to him. Grim piles of masonry, stark\r\nforce of character, alike compelled his admiration and he could make\r\nthem live again in print. As it proved, his life was too short to\r\nrealize this ambition and he has only left fragments of what he had to\r\ntell, though we are fortunate in having other books on parts of the\r\nsubject from his wife and from Miss Norgate, which owed their origin to\r\nhis inspiration.\r\n\r\nDuring his time as a London clergyman Green used to pay occasional\r\nvisits to Dawkins in Somerset; and in 1862, when he went to read a paper\r\non Dunstan to a society at Taunton, he renewed acquaintance with his old\r\nschoolfellow, E. A. Freeman, a notable figure in the county as squire,\r\npolitician, and antiquarian, and already becoming known outside it as a\r\nhistorian. The following year, as Freeman's guest, he met Professor\r\nStubbs; and about this time he also made friends with James Bryce, 'the\r\nHoly Roman', as he calls him in later letters.[57] The friendship of\r\nthese three men was treasured by Green throughout his life, and it gave\r\nrise to much interesting correspondence on historical subjects. They\r\nwere the central group of the Oxford School; they reverenced the same\r\nideals and were in general sympathy with one another. But this sympathy\r\nnever descended to mere mutual admiration, as with some literary\r\ncoteries. Between Freeman and Green in particular there was kept up a\r\nrunning fire of friendly but outspoken criticism, which would have\r\nstrained the tie between men less generous and less devoted to\r\nhistorical truth. Freeman was the more arbitrary and dogmatic, Green\r\nthe more sensitive and discriminating. Green bows to Freeman's superior\r\nknowledge of Norman times, acknowledges him his master, and apologizes\r\nfor hasty criticisms when they give offence; but he boldly rebukes his\r\nfriend for his indifference to the popular movements in Italian cities\r\nand for his pedantry about Italian names.\r\n\r\n[Note 57: The first edition of Bryce's _Holy Roman Empire_ was\r\npublished in 1862.]\r\n\r\nAnd he treads on even more delicate ground when he taxes him with\r\nindulging too frequently in polemics, urging him to 'come out of the\r\narena' and to cease girding at Froude and Kingsley, whose writings\r\nFreeman loved to abuse. Freeman, on the other hand, grumbles at Green\r\nfor going outside the province of history to write on more frivolous\r\nsubjects, and scolds him for introducing fanciful ideas into his\r\nnarrative of events. The classic instance of this was when Green, after\r\ndescribing the capture by the French of the famous Château Gaillard in\r\nNormandy, had the audacity to say, 'from its broken walls we see not\r\nmerely the pleasant vale of Seine, but also the sedgy flats of our own\r\nRunnymede'. Thereby he meant his readers to learn that John would never\r\nhave granted the Great Charter to the Barons, had he not already\r\nweakened the royal authority by the loss of Coeur-de-Lion's great\r\nfortress beyond the sea, and that to a historian the germs of English\r\nfreedom, won beside the Thames, were to be seen in the wreckage of\r\nNorman power above the Seine. But Freeman was too matter of fact to\r\nallow such flights of fancy; and a lively correspondence passed between\r\nthe two friends, each maintaining his own view of what might or might\r\nnot be permitted to the votaries of Clio.\r\n\r\nBut before this episode Green had been introduced by Freeman to John\r\nDouglas Cook, founder and editor of the _Saturday Review_, and had begun\r\nto contribute to its columns. Naturally it was on historical subjects\r\nthat his pen was most active; but apart from the serious 'leading\r\narticles', the _Saturday_ found place for what the staff called\r\n'Middles', light essays written after the manner of Addison or Steele on\r\nmatters of every-day life. Here Green was often at his best. Freeman\r\ngrowled, in his dictatorial fashion, when he found his friend turning\r\naway from the strait path of historical research to describe the humours\r\nof his parish, the foibles of district visitors and deaconesses, the\r\ncharms of the school-girl before she expands her wings in the\r\ndrawing-room--above all (and this last was quoted by the author as his\r\nbest literary achievement) the joys of 'Children by the sea'. But any\r\none who turns over the pages of the volume called _Stray Studies from\r\nEngland and Italy_, where some of these articles are reprinted, will\r\nprobably agree with the verdict of the author on their merits. The\r\nsubjects are drawn from all ages and all countries. Historical scenes\r\nare peopled with the figures of the past, treated in the magical style\r\nwhich Green made his own. Dante is seen against the background of\r\nmediaeval Florence; Tintoret represents the life of Venice at its\r\nrichest, most glorious time. The old buildings of Lambeth make a noble\r\nsetting for the portraits of archbishops, the gentle Warham, the hapless\r\nCranmer, the tyrannical Laud. Many of these studies are given to the\r\npleasant border-land between history and geography, and to the\r\nimpressions of travel gathered in England or abroad. In one sketch he\r\nputs into a single sentence all the features of an old English town\r\nwhich his quick eye could note, and from which he could 'work out the\r\nhistory of the men who lived and died there. In quiet quaintly-named\r\nstreets, in the town mead and the market-place, in the lord's mill\r\nbeside the stream, in the ruffed and furred brasses of its burghers in\r\nthe church, lies the real life of England and Englishmen, the life of\r\ntheir home and their trade, their ceaseless, sober struggle with\r\noppression, their steady, unwearied battle for self-government.'\r\n\r\nIn another he follows the funeral procession of his Angevin hero Henry\r\nII from the stately buildings of Chinon 'by the broad bright Vienne\r\ncoming down in great gleaming curves, under the grey escarpments of rock\r\npierced here and there with the peculiar cellars or cave-dwellings of\r\nthe country', to his last resting-place in the vaults of Fontevraud.\r\nStanding beside the monuments on their tombs he notes the striking\r\ncontrast of type and character which Henry offers to his son Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion. 'Nothing', he says, 'could be less ideal than the narrow\r\nbrow, the large prosaic eyes, the coarse full cheeks, the sensual dogged\r\njaw, that combine somehow into a face far higher than its separate\r\ndetails, and which is marked by a certain sense of power and command. No\r\ncountenance could be in stronger contrast with his son's, and yet in\r\nboth there is the same look of repulsive isolation from men. Richard's\r\nis a face of cultivation and refinement, but there is a strange severity\r\nin the small delicate mouth and in the compact brow of the lion-hearted,\r\nwhich realizes the verdict of his day. To an historical student one\r\nglance at these faces, as they lie here beneath the vault raised by\r\ntheir ancestor, the fifth Count Fulc, tells more than pages of history.'\r\nOur reviews and magazines may abound to-day in such vivid pen-pictures\r\nof places and men; but it was Green and others of his day who watered\r\nthe dry roots of archaeology and restored it to life.\r\n\r\nBut from his earliest days as a student Green had looked beyond the\r\nfigures of kings, ministers, and prelates, who had so long filled the\r\nstage in the volumes of our historians. However clearly they stood out\r\nin their greatness and in their faults, they were not, and could not be,\r\nthe nation. And when he came to write on a larger scale, the title which\r\nhe chose for his book showed that he was aiming at new ideals.\r\n\r\nThe _Short History of the English People_ is the book by which Green's\r\nfame will stand or fall, and it occupied him for the best years of his\r\nlife. The true heroes of it are the labourer and the artisan, the friar,\r\nthe printer, and the industrial mechanic--'not many mighty, not many\r\nnoble'. The true growth of the English nation is seen broad-based on the\r\nlife of the commonalty, and we can study it better in the rude verse of\r\nLongland, or the parables of Bunyan, than in the formal records of\r\nbattles and dynastic schemes.\r\n\r\nThe periods into which the book is divided are chosen on other grounds\r\nthan those of the old handbooks, where the accession of a new king or a\r\nnew dynasty is made a landmark; and a different proportion is observed\r\nin the space given to events or to prominent men. The Wars of the Roses\r\nare viewed as less important than the Peasants' Revolt; the scholars of\r\nthe New Learning leave scant space for Lambert Simnels and Perkin\r\nWarbecks. Henry Pelham, one of the last prime ministers to owe his\r\nposition to the king's favour, receives four lines, while forty are\r\ngiven to John Howard, a pioneer in the new path of philanthropy. Besides\r\nsocial subjects, literature receives generous measure, but even here no\r\nrigid system is observed. Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare take a\r\nprominent place in their epochs; Byron, Wordsworth, and Tennyson are\r\nignored. This is not because Green had no interest in them or\r\nundervalued their influence. Far from it. But, as the history of the\r\nnation became more complex, he found it impossible, within the limits\r\nprescribed by a _Short_ History, to do justice to everything. He\r\nbelieved that the industrialism, which grew up in the Georgian era,\r\nexercised a wider influence in changing the character of the people than\r\nthe literature of that period; and so he turned his attention to Watt\r\nand Brindley, and deliberately omitted the poets and painters of that\r\nday. With his wide sympathies he must have found this rigorous\r\ncompression the hardest of his tasks, and only in part could he\r\ncompensate it later. He never lived long enough to treat, as he wished\r\nto do, in the fullness of his knowledge, the later periods of English\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn writing this book Green had many discouragements to contend against,\r\napart from his continual ill-health. Even his friends spoke doubtfully\r\nof its method and style, with the exception of his publisher, George\r\nMacmillan, and of Stopford Brooke, whose own writings breathe the same\r\nspirit as Green's, and who did equally good work in spreading a real\r\nlove of history and literature among the classes who were beginning to\r\nread. It was true that Green's book failed to conform to the usual type\r\nof manual; it was not orderly in arrangement, it was often allusive in\r\nstyle, it seemed to select what it pleased and to leave out what\r\nstudents were accustomed to learn. But Green's faith in its power to\r\nreach the audience to whom he appealed was justified by the enthusiasm\r\nwith which the general public received it. This success was largely due\r\nto the literary style and artistic handling of the subject. Green claims\r\nhimself that on most literary questions he is French in his point of\r\nview. 'It seems to me', he says, 'that on all points of literary art we\r\nhave to sit at the feet of French Gamaliels'; and in his best work he\r\nhas more in common with Michelet than with our own classic historians.\r\nBut while Michelet had many large volumes in which to expand his\r\ntreatment of picturesque episodes, Green was painfully limited by space.\r\n\r\nWhat he can give us of clear and lively portraiture in a few lines is\r\nseen in his presentation of the gallant men who laid the foundation of\r\nour Empire overseas. By a few lines of narrative, and a happy quotation\r\nfrom their own words, Green brings out the heroism of their sacrifice or\r\ntheir success, the faith which inspired Humphry Gilbert to meet his\r\ndeath at sea, the patience which enabled John Smith to achieve the\r\ntillage of Virginian soil.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these masterly vignettes are full-length portraits of\r\ngreat rulers such as Alfred, Elizabeth, and Cromwell, and vivid\r\ndescriptions of religious leaders such as Cranmer, Laud, and Wesley.\r\nStrong though Green's own views on Church and State were, we do not feel\r\nthat he is deserting the province of the historian to lecture us on\r\nreligion or politics. The book is real narrative written in a fair\r\nspirit, the author rendering justice to the good points of men like\r\nLaud, whom he detested, and aiming above all at conveying clearly to his\r\nreaders the picture of what he believed to have happened in the past. As\r\na narrative it was not without faults. The reviewers at once seized on\r\nmany small mistakes, into which Green had fallen through the uncertainty\r\nof his memory for names and words. To these Green cheerfully confessed,\r\nand was thankful that they proved to be so slight. But when other\r\ncritics accused him of superficiality they were in error. On this point\r\nwe have the verdict of Bishop Stubbs, the most learned and conscientious\r\nhistorian of the day. 'All Green's work', he says, 'was real and\r\noriginal work. Few people beside those who knew him well could see,\r\nunder the charming ease and vivacity of his style, the deep research and\r\nsustained industry of the laborious student. But it was so; there was no\r\ndepartment of our national records that he had not studied, and, I think\r\nI may say, mastered. Hence, I think, the unity of his dramatic scenes\r\nand the cogency of his historical arguments.'\r\n\r\nGreen himself was as severe a critic of the book as any one. Writing in\r\n1877 to his future wife, he says, 'I see the indelible mark of the\r\nessayist, the \"want of long breath\", as the French say, the jerkiness,\r\nthe slurring over of the uninteresting parts, above all, the want of\r\ngrasp of the subject as a whole'. On the advice of some of his best\r\nfriends, confirmed by his own judgement, in 1874 he gave up contributing\r\nto the _Saturday Review_, in order to free his style from the character\r\nimparted to it by writing detached weekly articles. The composing of\r\nthese articles had been a pleasure; the writing of English history was\r\nto be his life-work, and no divided allegiance was conceivable to him.\r\nBut we may indeed be thankful that he resisted the views of other\r\nfriends who wished to drive him into copying German models. This class\r\nGreen called 'Pragmatic Historians';[58] and, while acknowledging their\r\nsolid contributions to history, he maintains his conviction that there\r\nis another method and another school worthy of imitation, and that he\r\nmust 'hold to what he thinks true and work it out as he can'.\r\n\r\nGreen was a rapid reader and a rapid writer. In a letter to Freeman,\r\nwritten when he was wintering in Florence in 1872, he admits covering\r\nthe period from the Peasant Revolt to the end of the New Learning\r\n(1381-1520) in ten days. But he was writing from notes which represented\r\nyears of previous study. In another letter, written in 1876, he\r\nconfesses a tendency to 'wild hitting', and perhaps he was too rapid at\r\ntimes in drawing his inferences. 'With me', he says, 'the impulse to try\r\nto connect things, to find the \"why\" of things, is irresistible; and\r\neven if I overdo my political guesses, you or some German will punch my\r\nhead and put things rightly and intelligibly again.' It is this power of\r\nconnecting events and explaining how one movement leads to another which\r\nmakes the stimulating quality of Green's work; and to a nation like the\r\nEnglish, too little apt to indulge in general ideas, this quality may be\r\nof more value than the German erudition which tends to overburden the\r\nintelligence with too great a load of 'facts'. And, after all the\r\nlabours of Carlyle and Froude, of Stubbs and Freeman, and all the\r\ndelving into records and chronicles, who shall say what _are_ facts, and\r\nwhat is inference, legitimate or illegitimate, from them?\r\n\r\n[Note 58: Pragmatic: 'treating facts of history with reference to\r\ntheir practical lessons.' _Concise Oxford Dictionary._]\r\n\r\nWhatever were the shortcomings of the book, which Green in his letters\r\nto Freeman called by the affectionate names of 'Shorts' and 'Little\r\nBook', it inaugurated a new method, and won a hearing among readers who\r\nhad hitherto professed no taste for history; and, financially, it proved\r\nso far a success that Green was relieved from the necessity of\r\ncontinuing work that was uncongenial. He had already given up his parish\r\nin 1869. Ill-health and the advice of his doctor were the deciding\r\nfactors; but there is no doubt that Green was also finding it difficult\r\nto subscribe to all the doctrines of the Church. He took up the same\r\nliberal comprehensive attitude to Church questions as he did to\r\npolitics, and opposed any attempt to stifle honest inquiry or to punish\r\nhonest doubt. He was much disturbed by some of the attempts made at this\r\ntime by the more extreme parties in the Church to enforce uniformity.\r\nAlso he felt that the Church was not exercising its proper influence on\r\nthe nation, owing to the prejudice or apathy of the clergy in meeting\r\nthe social movements of the day. If he had found more support, inside\r\nthe diocese, for his social and educational work, the breach might have\r\nbeen healed, or at any rate postponed, in the hope of his health\r\nmending.\r\n\r\nRelieved of parish work, he found plentiful occupation in revising his\r\nold books and in planning new; he showed wonderful zest for travelling\r\nabroad, and, by choosing carefully the places for his winter sojourn, he\r\nfought heroically to combat increasing ill-health and to achieve his\r\nliterary ambitions. Thus it was that he made intimate acquaintance with\r\nSan Remo, Mentone, and Capri; and one winter he went as far as Luxor in\r\nthe hope that the Egyptian climate might help him; but in vain. Under\r\nthe guidance of his friend Stopford Brooke he visited for shorter\r\nperiods Venice, Florence, and other Italian towns. He was catholic in\r\nhis sympathies but not over-conscientious in sight-seeing. When Brooke\r\nleft him at Florence, Green was openly glad to relapse into vagrant\r\npilgrimage, to put aside his guide-book and to omit the daily visit to\r\nthe Uffizi Gallery. But, on the other hand, he reproached Freeman for\r\nconfining his interests entirely to architecture and emperors while\r\nignoring pictures and sculpture, mediaeval guilds, and the relics of old\r\ncivic life. It was at Troyes that Bryce observed him 'darting hither and\r\nthither through the streets like a dog following a scent'--and to such\r\npurpose that after a few hours of research he could write a brilliant\r\npaper sketching the history of the town as illustrated in its\r\nmonuments--but in Italy, as in France, he had a wonderful gift for\r\ndiscovering all that was most worth knowing about a town, which other\r\nmen passed by and ignored.\r\n\r\nCapri, which he first visited at Christmas 1872, was the most successful\r\nof his winter haunts. The climate, the beauty of the scenery, the\r\nsimplicity of the life, all suited him admirably. On this occasion he\r\nstayed four months in the island, and he has sung its praises in one of\r\nthe 'Stray Studies'. Within a small compass there is a wonderful variety\r\nof scene. Green delights in it all, 'in the boldly scarped cliffs, in\r\nthe dense scrub of myrtle and arbutus, in the blue strips of sea that\r\nseem to have been cunningly let in among the rocks, in the olive yards\r\ncreeping thriftily up the hill sides, in the remains of Roman sculptures\r\nand mosaics, in the homesteads of grey stone and low domes and Oriental\r\nroofs'. And he found it an ideal place for literary work, restful and\r\nremote, 'where one can live unscourged by Kingsley's \"wind of God\".'\r\n'The island', he writes, 'is a paradise of silence for those to whom\r\nsilence is a delight. One wanders about in the vineyards without a sound\r\nsave the call of the vinedressers: one lies on the cliff and hears, a\r\nthousand feet below, the dreary wash of the sea. There is hardly the cry\r\nof a bird to break the spell; even the girls who meet one with a smile\r\non the hillside smile quietly and gravely in the Southern fashion as\r\nthey pass by.' No greater contrast could be found to the conditions\r\nunder which he began his books; and it is not surprising that in this\r\nhaven of peace, with no parish business to break in upon his study, he\r\nworked more rapidly and confidently--when his health allowed.\r\n\r\nFrom such retreats he would return refreshed in body and mind to\r\ncontinue studying and writing in London and to sketch out new plans for\r\nthe future. One that bore rich fruit was that of a series of Primers,\r\ndealing shortly with great subjects and commending them to the general\r\nreader by attractive literary style. They were produced by Macmillan,\r\nGreen acting as editor; and notable volumes were contributed by\r\nGladstone on Homer, by Creighton on Rome, and by Stopford Brooke on\r\nEnglish Literature. Here, again, Green was a pioneer in a path where he\r\nhas had many followers since; and he would have been the first to edit\r\nan English Historical Review if more support had been forthcoming from\r\nthe public. But for financial reasons he was obliged to abandon the\r\nscheme, and it did not see the light of day till Creighton launched it\r\nin 1886.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 he married and found in his wife just the helper that he needed.\r\nShe too had the historical imagination, the love of research, and the\r\npower of writing. Husband and wife produced in co-operation a small\r\ngeography of the British Isles, well planned, clear, and pleasant to\r\nread. But, apart from this, she was content, during the too brief period\r\nof their married life, to subordinate her activities to helping her\r\nhusband, and her aid was invaluable at the time when he was writing his\r\nlater books. There is no doubt that his marriage prolonged his life. The\r\ncare which his wife took of him, whether in their home in foggy London,\r\nor in primitive lodgings in beautiful Capri, helped him over his worst\r\ndays; and the new value which he now set on life and its happiness gave\r\nhim redoubled force of will. There were others who helped him in these\r\ndays of perpetual struggle with ill-health. His doctors, Sir Andrew\r\nClark and Sir Lauder Brunton, rendered him the devotion of personal\r\nfriends. The historians gathered round him in Kensington Square, the\r\nhome of his later years, and cheered him with good talk. Those who were\r\nlucky enough to be admitted might hear him at his best, discussing\r\nhistorical questions in a circle which included Sir Henry Maine and\r\nBishop Stubbs, as well as Lecky, Freeman, and Bryce. He had many other\r\ninterests. Such a man could not be indifferent to contemporary politics.\r\nHis heroes--and he was an ardent worshipper of heroes--were Gladstone\r\nand Garibaldi, and, like many Liberals of the day, he was violent in his\r\nopposition to Beaconsfield's policy in Eastern Europe. Hatred of\r\nNapoleonic tyranny killed for a while his sympathy with France, and in\r\n1870 he sympathized with the German cause--at least till the rape of the\r\ntwo provinces and the sorrows of disillusioned France revived his old\r\nfeeling for the French nation. Over everything he felt keenly and\r\nexpressed himself warmly. As Tennyson said to him at the close of a\r\nvisit to Aldworth, 'You're a jolly, vivid man; you're as vivid as\r\nlightning'.\r\n\r\nParticularly dear to him was the close sympathy of Stopford Brooke and\r\nthat of Humphry Ward, to whose father he had been curate in 1860 and who\r\nhad himself for years learnt to cherish the friendship of Green and to\r\nseek his counsel. Mrs. Ward has told us how she (then Miss Arnold)\r\nbrought her earliest literary efforts to Green, how kindly was his\r\nencouragement but how formidable was the standard of excellence which he\r\nset up. She has also pictured for us 'the thin wasted form seated in the\r\ncorner of the sofa... the eloquent lips... the life flashing from his\r\neyes beneath the very shadow of death'. His latter years, lived\r\nperpetually under this grim shadow, were yet full of cheerfulness and\r\nof hope. However the body might fail, the active brain was planning and\r\nthe high courage was bracing him to further effort. Between 1877 and\r\n1880 he published in four volumes a _History of the English People_,\r\nwhich follows the same plan and covers much the same ground as the\r\n_Short History_. He was able to revise his views on points where recent\r\nstudy threw fresh light and to include subjects which had been crowded\r\nout for want of space. But the book failed to attract readers to the\r\nsame extent as the _Short History_. The freshness and buoyancy of the\r\nearlier sketch could not be recaptured after so long an interval. In the\r\nlast year of his life he began again on the early history of England,\r\nworking at a pace which would have been astonishing even in a man of\r\nrobust health, and he completed in the short period of eleven months the\r\nbrilliant volume called _The Making of England_. He had thought out the\r\nsubject during many a day and night of pain and had the plan clear in\r\nhis head; but he was indefatigable in revising his work, and would make\r\nas many as eight or ten drafts of a chapter before it satisfied his\r\njudgement. His last autumn and winter were occupied with the succeeding\r\nvolume, _The Conquest of England_, and he left it sufficiently complete\r\nfor his wife to edit and publish a few months after his death.\r\n\r\nThe end came at Mentone early in 1883. Two years of life had been won,\r\nas his doctor said, by sheer force of will; but the frail body could no\r\nlonger obey the soul, and nature could bear no more.\r\n\r\nIf in the twentieth century history is losing its hold on the thought\r\nand feeling of the rising generation, Green is the last man whom we can\r\nblame. He gave all his faculties unsparingly to his task--patience,\r\nenthusiasm, single-hearted love of truth; and he encouraged others to do\r\nthe same. No man was more free from the pontifical airs of those\r\nhistorians who proclaimed history as an academic science to be confined\r\nwithin the chilly walls of libraries and colleges. We may apply to his\r\nwork what Mr. G. M. Trevelyan has said of the English historians from\r\nClarendon down to recent times; it was 'the means of spreading far and\r\nwide, throughout all the reading classes, a love and knowledge of\r\nhistory, an elevated and critical patriotism, and certain qualities of\r\nmind and heart'.[59] Against the danger which he mentions in his next\r\nsentence, that we are now being drilled into submission to German\r\nmodels, Mr. Trevelyan is himself one of our surest protectors.\r\n\r\n[Note 59: _Clio and other Essays_, by G.

In\r\nthe eighteenth century they had held land in North London. Cecil's\r\nfather was vicar of Bishop's Stortford, a quiet country town in\r\nHertfordshire on the Essex border; he was a man of mark, wealthy,\r\nliberal, and unconventional, with the rare gift of preaching ten-minute\r\nsermons which were well worth hearing. Of his eldest sons, Herbert went\r\nto Winchester, Frank to Eton; Cecil, the fifth son, born on July 5,\r\n1853, was kept at home. He had part of his education at the local\r\nGrammar School, but perhaps the better part at the Vicarage from his\r\nfather himself. The shrewd Vicar soon saw that his fifth son was not\r\nfitted for the ordinary routine of professional life at home, and at the\r\nage of seventeen he was sent out to visit his brother Herbert, who had\r\nemigrated to Natal. Cecil said good-bye to his native land for the first\r\ntime in 1870, and thus early elected to be a citizen of the Greater\r\nBritain beyond the seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CECIL RHODES\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by G. F. Watts in the National Portrait Gallery]\r\n\r\nThe brothers had certain points of resemblance, being both original and\r\nadventurous; but they had marked differences. The elder was a wanderer\r\npure and simple, a lover of sport and of novelty. He could follow a new\r\ntrack with all the ardour of a pioneer; he could not sit down and\r\ndevelop the wealth which he had opened up. The management of the Natal\r\ncotton farm soon fell into the hands of Cecil, now eighteen years old,\r\nwho noted every detail, and studied his crops, his workmen, and his\r\nmarkets, while Herbert was absent in quest of game and adventure. It was\r\nthis spirit which led Herbert westward in 1871, among the earliest of\r\nthe immigrants into the diamond fields: before the end of the year Cecil\r\nfollowed and soon took over and developed his brother's claim. It was no\r\ncase of Esau and Jacob; the brothers had great affection for one another\r\nand fitted in together without jealousy. Each lived his own life and\r\nfollowed his own bent. As Kimberley was the first field in which Cecil\r\nshowed his abilities, it is worth while to try to picture the scene. It\r\nremained a centre of interest to him for thirty years, the scene of many\r\ntroubles and of many triumphs.\r\n\r\n'The New Rush', as Kimberley was called in 1872, was a chaos of tents\r\nand rubbish heaps seen through a haze of dust--a heterogeneous\r\ncollection of tents, wagons, native kraals and debris heaps, each set\r\ndown with cheerful irresponsibility and indifference to order. The\r\nfunnel of blue clay so productive of diamonds had been found on a bit of\r\nthe bare Griqualand Veld, marked out by no geographical advantages, with\r\nno charm of woodland or river scenery. Here in the years to come the\r\ngreat pits, familiar in modern photographs, were to grow deeper and\r\ndeeper, as the partitions fell in between the small claims, or as the\r\nmore enterprising miners bought up their neighbours' plots. Here the\r\ndebris heaps were to grow higher and higher, as more hundreds of Kaffirs\r\nwere brought in to dig, or new machinery arrived, as the buckets plied\r\nmore rapidly on the network of ropes overhead. In the early 'seventies\r\nthere were few signs of these marvels to be seen by the outward\r\neye--everything was in the rough--but they were no doubt already\r\nexisting in the brain of 'a tall fair boy, blue eyed and with somewhat\r\naquiline features, wearing flannels of the school playing-field,\r\nsomewhat shrunken with strenuous rather than effectual washings, that\r\nstill left the colour of the red veld dust'.\r\n\r\nHere Cecil Rhodes lived for the greater part of ten years, finding time\r\namid his work for dreams: living, in general, aloof from the men with\r\nwhom he did his daily business, but laying here and there the\r\nfoundations of a friendship which was to bear fruit hereafter. Rudd,[60]\r\nof the Matabeleland concessions, came out in 1873; Beit,[61] the partner\r\nin diamond fields and gold fields, the co-founder of the Chartered\r\nCompany, in 1875; and in 1878 there came out from Edinburgh one whose\r\nname was to be linked still more closely with that of Rhodes. Leander\r\nStarr Jameson, a skilful doctor, a cheerful companion, gifted with a\r\ngreat capacity for self-devotion, and with unshakeable firmness of will,\r\nwas now twenty-five years old. Rhodes and he soon drew closely together\r\nand for years they were living under one roof. While his casual and\r\nrather overbearing manners repelled many of his acquaintances, Rhodes\r\nhad a genius for friendship with the few; and it was such men as these\r\nwho shared his work, his pastimes, and his thoughts, and reconciled him\r\nto spending many years in the unattractive surroundings of the mines.\r\n\r\n[Note 60: C. D. Rudd (1844-96), educated at Harrow and Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Note 61: Alfred Beit, born at Hamburg, 1853; died in London, 1906.]\r\n\r\nBut his life at this time had other phases. Not the least wonderful\r\nchapter in it was the series of visits which he paid to Oxford between\r\n1873 and 1881. The atmosphere of a mining camp does not seem likely to\r\ndraw a man towards academic studies and a University life. But Rhodes,\r\nwho had a great power of absorbing himself in work, had also the power\r\nof projecting himself beyond the interests of the moment. Seven times he\r\nfound opportunity to tear himself away from the busy work of mining and\r\nto keep terms at Oxford; and they made a lasting impression upon him. It\r\nwas not the love of book-learning, still less the love of games, which\r\ndrew him there. To many he may have seemed to be spending his time\r\nunprofitably. He indulged in some rowing and polo, he was master of the\r\ndrag-hounds, he worried his neighbours by nocturnal practising of the\r\nhorn. The examinations in the schools, and the more popular athletic\r\ncontests, knew little of him. But his sojourn in Oxford was a tribute\r\npaid by the higher side of his mind to education and to the value of\r\nhigh thinking as compared with material progress; and no one who knew\r\nhim well in later life could doubt that the traditions of Oxford had\r\ndeeply influenced his mind. On these things he was by nature reticent,\r\nand was often misjudged.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1878 and 1888 must be placed the struggle between him\r\nand his rivals for predominance in Kimberley. It had begun with small\r\nenterprises, the purchasing of adjoining claims, the undertaking of\r\ndrainage work, the introduction of better machinery. It attracted more\r\nattention in 1880 with the founding of the first De Beers Company, named\r\nafter a Boer who had owned the land on which the mine lay. It culminated\r\nin 1887 in the battle with Barnato,[62] his most dangerous competitor,\r\nwhen by dexterous purchasing of shares in his rival's company Rhodes\r\nforced him into a final scheme of amalgamation. In 1888 was founded the\r\ngreat corporation of De Beers Consolidated mines. The masterful will of\r\nRhodes dictated the terms of the Trust deed, giving very extensive power\r\nto the Directorate for the using of their funds. He was already laying\r\nhis foundations, though few could then have guessed what imperial work\r\nwas to be done with the money thus obtained. The process of amalgamation\r\nwas not popular in Kimberley. It resulted in closing down many of the\r\nless profitable claims and in reducing the amount of labour employed.\r\nBut it brought in better machinery and it saved expenses of management.\r\nAbove all, it curtailed the output of diamonds and so kept up the market\r\nprice in Europe and elsewhere. Many people refused to believe that\r\nRhodes could have outmanoeuvred a man of exceptional financial ability\r\nwithout using dishonourable means. But there is no doubt that it was\r\nmasterful character which won the day, that strength of will which\r\ndecides the issue at the critical moment. Many others have been\r\nprejudiced against him merely from the fact that he spent so much time\r\nand energy in the pursuit of 'filthy lucre'. We must remember that\r\nRhodes himself said: 'What's the earthly use of having ideas if you\r\nhaven't the money to carry them out?' We must also remember that all\r\nwitnesses of his life agree that the ideas were always foremost, the\r\nmoney a mere instrument to realize them. The story was told to Edmund\r\nGarrett by one of Rhodes's old Kimberley associates 'how one day in\r\nthose scheming years, deep in the sordid details of amalgamation, Rhodes\r\n(\"always a bit of a crank\") suddenly put his hand over a great piece of\r\nNo Man's Africa on the map and said, \"Look here: all that British--that\r\nis my dream\".'[63]\r\n\r\n[Note 62: Barney Barnato, born in Houndsditch, 1852; died at sea,\r\n1897.]\r\n\r\n[Note 63: Perhaps the best character sketch of Rhodes is that\r\nprinted as an appendix to Sir E. T. Cook's _Life of Edmund Garrett_\r\n(Edward Arnold, 1909). Garrett's career as journalist and politician in\r\nSouth Africa was terminated by illness in 1899.]\r\n\r\nBut long before this struggle was over, Rhodes had embarked on new\r\ncourses which were to carry him still farther. His dreams of political\r\nwork began to take shape when Griqualand was created a British province\r\nin 1880. Two electoral divisions were formed, Kimberley and Barkly West;\r\nand it was for the latter that Rhodes first took his seat in the Cape\r\nParliament in 1880, a seat which he retained till his death. The Prime\r\nMinister was Sir Gordon Sprigg, a politician with experience but few\r\nideas, more skilled in retaining office than in formulating a policy.\r\nRhodes was at first reticent about his own projects, and spent his time\r\nquietly studying commercial questions, examining the problem of the\r\nnative races and making friends among the Boers. If these friendships\r\nwere obscured later by political quarrels, there is no reason to suspect\r\ntheir genuineness. His sympathy with the Dutch farmers had begun in\r\n1872, when he made a long, lonely trek through the Northern Transvaal,\r\nand it lasted through life. He was interested in farming, he liked\r\nnatural men, and was at home in unconventional surroundings. One of the\r\nclosest observers of his character said that to see the true Rhodes you\r\nmust see him on the veld. So long as the supremacy of the British flag\r\nwas assured, there was nothing that he so ardently desired as friendly\r\nrelations between British and Dutch, a real union of the races, a South\r\nAfrican nation. It was for this that he worked so long with Jan Hofmeyr,\r\nleader of the Cape Dutch, and earned so many unfair suspicions from the\r\nshort-sighted politicians of Cape Town.\r\n\r\nHofmeyr was a curious man. He had a great understanding of the Dutch\r\ncharacter and a great power of influencing men; but this was not done by\r\nparliamentary eloquence. By one satirist he was called 'the captain who\r\nnever appeared on the bridge'; by another he was nicknamed 'the Mole',\r\nbecause his activity could only be conjectured from the tracks which he\r\nleft behind him. A third name current in Cape Town, 'the Blind Man,' was\r\nan ironical tribute to his exceptional astuteness in politics. His organ\r\nwas 'the Afrikander Bond', a society formed partly for agricultural,\r\npartly for political purposes, a creature which like a chameleon has\r\noften changed its colour, sometimes working peacefully beside British\r\npoliticians, at other times openly conducting an anti-British agitation.\r\nHe certainly had no enthusiasm for the British flag, but he probably\r\nrealized the freedom which the Colony enjoyed under it, and was clear of\r\nall disloyalty to the Crown. The policy dearest to the farmers of the\r\nAfrikander Bond was the protective system for their agricultural\r\nproduce. If Rhodes would support this, he might induce the Dutch to give\r\nhim a free hand in his plans for expansion towards the North; and this\r\nwas needed, because the problem of the North was becoming urgent, and\r\nSprigg and his party were blind to its importance.\r\n\r\nA glance at the nineteenth-century map will show that the territories of\r\nthe Dutch Republic, lying on the less barren side of the continent,\r\ntended to block the extension of Cape Colony and Natal towards the\r\nnorth, the more so as the Boers from time to time sent out fresh swarms\r\nwestward and encroached on native territory in Bechuanaland. The Germans\r\ndid not annex Namaqualand till 1885, but already their interest in this\r\ndistrict was becoming evident to close observers. Rhodes's most\r\ncherished dream had been the development of the high-lying healthy\r\ninland regions to the north by the British race under the British flag.\r\nBut in those days, when Whitehall was asleep and officials in Cape Town\r\nwere indifferent, Rhodes saw that his best chance was to convert the\r\nDutch in the Colony. He hoped to make them realize that, if they\r\nsupported him, the development of the interior might bring trade through\r\nCape Town, which otherwise would go eastward through Portuguese\r\nchannels. The building of railways, the settlement of new lands in which\r\nDutch and English would share alike, were practical questions which\r\nmight interest them, and Rhodes was quite genuine in his desire to see\r\nboth races going forward together. 'Equal rights for every civilized man\r\nsouth of the Zambezi' was his motto, and to this he steadfastly clung.\r\n\r\nTo describe all the means by which Rhodes worked towards this end would\r\nbe impossible. He worked hard at Kimberley to furnish the sinews of war;\r\nhe used his personal influence and power of persuasion at Cape Town to\r\nwin support from Hofmeyr and others; and he was ready to go to the\r\nfrontier at any moment when there was work to be done. His first\r\ncommission of this sort had been in Basutoland in 1882, when he helped\r\nthe famous General Gordon to pacify native discontent; but the following\r\nyear saw him at work on another frontier more directly affecting his\r\nprogramme. The Boers had again been raiding westwards and had started\r\ntwo new republics, called Goshen and Stellaland, on the route from\r\nKimberley to the north. Rhodes travelled to the scene of action,\r\ninterviewed Mankoroane, the Bechuana chief, and Van Niekerk, the head of\r\nthe new settlement, and by sheer personal magnetism persuaded them both\r\nto accept British control. When the Cape Parliament refused the\r\nresponsibility, he referred to the Colonial Office in London, and by the\r\nhelp of Sir Hercules Robinson, the High Commissioner, he carried his\r\npoint. When the new Governor, who was appointed by the Colonial Office,\r\nquarrelled with the Boers, it was Rhodes who made up the quarrel, and\r\nwhen in 1885 the Transvaal Dutch interfered and provoked our home\r\nGovernment into sending out an overpowering force under Sir Charles\r\nWarren, it was Rhodes once more who acted as the reconciler, and\r\neffected a settlement between Dutch and British. When the indignant\r\nDelarey,[64] provoked by English blundering, said ominously that 'blood\r\nmust flow', Rhodes replied, 'No, give me my breakfast, and then we can\r\ntalk about blood'. He stayed with Delarey a week, came to terms on the\r\npoints at issue, and even became godfather to Delarey's grandchild. He\r\nwas never the man to resort to force when persuasion could be employed,\r\nand he usually won his end by his own means.\r\n\r\n[Note 64: General Jacobus Delarey, one of the most successful\r\ncommanders in the Great Boer War of 1899-1902.]\r\n\r\nWhile his great work in 1883-5 was on the northern frontier he was\r\ngrowing to be a familiar figure among politicians at Cape Town. We have\r\nan impression of him as he appeared on his entrance into politics. 'He\r\nwas tall, broad-shouldered, with face and figure of somewhat loose\r\nformation. His hair was auburn, carelessly flung over his forehead, his\r\neyes of bluish grey, dreamy but kindly. But the mouth--aye, that was the\r\nunruly member of his face--with deep lines following the curve of the\r\nmoustache, it had a determined, masterful, and sometimes scornful\r\nexpression.... His style of speaking was straight and to the point. He\r\nwas not a hard hitter in debate--rather a persuader, reasoning and\r\npleading in a conversational way as one more anxious to convince an\r\nopponent than to expose his weakness. He used little gesture: what there\r\nwas, was most expressive, his hands held behind him, or thrust out,\r\nsometimes passed over his brow.'[65] Such success as he had in\r\nParliament he owed less to art than to nature, less to oratorical gifts\r\nthan to force of character; but this brought him rapidly to the front.\r\nAs early as 1884 he was in the Ministry, and despite his long absences\r\nover his northern work he was judged to be the only man who could become\r\nPrime Minister in the parliamentary crisis of 1890. There was, by that\r\nyear, little question that he was the most influential man in South\r\nAfrica. He had a large holding in the Transvaal goldfields, discovered\r\nin 1886; he was head of the great De Beers Corporation of Kimberley; and\r\nhe was chairman of the newly-created Chartered Company. To many it\r\nseemed impossible that one man could combine these great financial\r\ninterests with the position of First Minister of the Colony; but at\r\nleast it was clear that the interests of the companies were subordinated\r\nto national aims, that the money which he obtained from mines was spent\r\non imperial ends, and that his political position was never used for the\r\npromoting of financial objects.\r\n\r\n[Note 65: _Cecil Rhodes: a Monograph and a Reminiscence_, by Sir\r\nThomas Fuller (Longmans & Co., 1910)]\r\n\r\nBut it is time to return to the development of the north, the greatest\r\nof his schemes and the one dearest to his heart. The year 1885 had\r\nsecured Bechuanaland to the river Molopo as British territory, while a\r\nlarge stretch farther north was under a British protectorate. One danger\r\nhad been avoided. The neck of the bottle was not corked up: a way to the\r\ninterior was now open. The next factor to reckon with was the Matabele\r\nnation and its chief, Lobengula. They were a Bantu tribe, fond of\r\nfighting and hunting, an offshoot of the Zulus who fought us in 1881.\r\nThey had a very large country surrounding the Matoppo hills, and\r\nLobengula ruled the various districts through 'indunas' or chiefs, who\r\nhad 'impis' or armies of fighting men at their disposal. To the\r\nnorth-east of them lay the weaker tribe of the Mashona, who paid tribute\r\nto Lobengula and whose country was a common hunting-ground for the\r\nMatabele braves. Over the latter, so long as he did not check too much\r\ntheir love of fighting, Lobengula exercised a fairly effective control.\r\nHe himself was a remarkable man, strong in body and mind. Sir Lewis\r\nMichell describes him as he appeared to English visitors: 'A somewhat\r\ngrotesque costume of four yards of blue calico over his shoulders and a\r\nstring of tigers' tails round his waist could not make his imposing\r\nfigure ridiculous. In early days he was an athlete and a fine shot; and\r\nthough, as years went on, his voracious appetite rendered him\r\nconspicuously obese, he was every inch a ruler.... Visitors were much\r\nstruck by his capacity for government: very little went on in his wide\r\ndominions of which he was not instantly and accurately informed.' He was\r\nan arbitrary ruler, but not cruel to Europeans, of whom a few, like the\r\nfamous hunter Selous, visited his capital from time to time. He clearly\r\nheld the keys to the north, and it was with him that Rhodes had now to\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nThe first step was the mission sent out by Rhodes and Beit early in\r\n1888, headed by their old associate Rudd. He and his two fellow-envoys\r\nstayed some months with Lobengula watching for favourable moments and\r\ntrying to win his favour. They shifted their quarters when the king did\r\nso, touring from village to village, plied the king and his indunas with\r\noffers and arguments, and finally in October they obtained his signature\r\nto a treaty giving full and unqualified rights to the envoys for working\r\nminerals in his country. In return they covenanted to give him money,\r\nrifles, ammunition, and an armed steamboat.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to get the support of the British authorities in\r\nLondon for that political extension which was dearer to Rhodes than the\r\nrichest mines and the biggest dividends. In this he was greatly helped\r\nby his consistent supporter, Sir Hercules Robinson, who held office in\r\nAfrica for many years, studied men and matters at first hand, and had a\r\njuster estimate of Rhodes and his value to the Empire than the officials\r\nin Whitehall. The method of proceeding was by chartered company, the old\r\nElizabethan method, which still has its value to-day, as it relieves the\r\nhome Government of the expense of developing new countries, yet reserves\r\nto it the right to control policy and to enter into the harvest. The\r\nCompany was to build railways and telegraphs, encourage colonization and\r\nspread trade; the Government was to escape from the diplomatic\r\ndifficulties which might arise with neighbours if it were acting under\r\nits own name.\r\n\r\nThe third step was to make a way into the country and to start actual\r\nwork. Lobengula's consent was given conditionally: the first expedition\r\nwas to avoid his capital, Bulawayo, and to go by the south-east to\r\nMashonaland. The chief knew how difficult it might prove to hold in his\r\nimpis when, instead of a solitary Selous, some hundreds of Europeans\r\nbegan to cross their hunting-grounds. And so it proved. Lobengula had to\r\npretend later that he had not consented to their passage, and the\r\nexpedition had to slip through the dangerous zone before they could be\r\nrecalled authoritatively. By May 1890 a column of nearly one thousand\r\nmen was ready to start from Khama's country; and in June their equipment\r\nwas approved by a British officer. On September 11, after a march of\r\nfour hundred miles through trackless country (some of it unknown even to\r\nSelous, their guide), the British flag was hoisted on the site of the\r\nmodern town of Salisbury. It is a chapter of history well worth reading\r\nin detail, but Rhodes himself could not be there: the heroes of the\r\nmarch were Jameson and Selous. The other half of Rhodesia, Matabeleland,\r\nwas not added till a few years later; but British enterprise had now\r\nfound the way and overcome the worst difficulties. 'Occupation Day' is\r\nstill kept as the chief festival of the Colony.\r\n\r\nFurther extension was inevitable. The Matabele impis would not forgo\r\ntheir old habit of raiding amongst the Mashonas. Jameson's complaints\r\nreceived only partial satisfaction from Lobengula. He himself did not\r\nwant war, but he failed to control his men, and in September 1893 the\r\nChartered Company was driven to fight. They had on the spot about nine\r\nhundred men and some machine-guns. Against these the Matabele with all\r\ntheir bravery could effect little. In two engagements they threw away\r\ntheir lives with reckless gallantry, and then they broke and fled.\r\nLobengula himself was never heard of again. His rearguard cut up a small\r\nparty of British who were too impetuous in pursuit, but by the end of\r\nthe year the country was at peace. In 1894 Matabeleland was added to the\r\nterritory of the Chartered Company, in 1895 the term 'Rhodesia' came\r\ninto use for postal purposes, and in 1897 it was officially adopted for\r\nadministrative purposes.\r\n\r\nThe jealousy of the Portuguese, who claimed the 'Hinterland' behind\r\ntheir East African colony, though they had never occupied it, caused a\r\ngood deal of ill feeling, and very nearly led to hostilities both in\r\nAfrica and Europe. The Boers formed schemes for raiding the new lands\r\nbefore they could be effectively occupied, and had to be headed off. The\r\nMatabele impis continued for months in a state of excitement; and their\r\nforays made it far too dangerous for Rhodes or for others to go up there\r\nfor some time. But Rhodes himself said that he had less trouble with\r\nnatives, with Dutch, and with Portuguese, than he had with compatriots\r\nof his own, who claimed to have received concessions from native chiefs\r\nand intrigued against him in London. But here his peculiar gifts came\r\nout, his patience, his persuasive power, his readiness to pour out money\r\nlike water for a worthy end. Some he beat, others he bought; and in all\r\ncases he maintained his position against his rivals. Robinson, Rudd,\r\nJameson, Selous, had all done their parts well, and Rhodes gave them\r\nfull credit and generous praise; but the mind and the will that planned\r\nand carried out the whole movement, and added a province to the British\r\nEmpire, was unquestionably his own.\r\n\r\nRhodes was Prime Minister of Cape Colony from 1890 to 1895; and during\r\nthis time he was obliged to be more often at Cape Town. It was in 1891\r\nthat he first leased the property lying on the eastern slopes of Table\r\nMountain where he built 'Groote Schuur', the famous house which he\r\nbequeathed to the service of the State. Here he gradually acquired 1,500\r\nacres of land, laying them out with a sure eye to the beauty of the\r\nsurroundings, and to the pleasure of his fellow-citizens. Here he lived\r\nfrom time to time, and received all kinds of men with boundless\r\nhospitality. No one can fully understand him who does not read the\r\nvarying impressions of the friends and guests who sat with him on the\r\n'stoep', under the trees in his garden, or high up on the mountain side,\r\nwhere he had his favourite nooks. The visitors saw what they had eyes to\r\nsee. One would note his foibles, his blunt manner, his slovenly dress,\r\nhis want of skill at billiards, his fondness for special dishes or\r\ndrinks. Another would be impressed by his library with its teak\r\npanelling, by the books which he read and the questions which he asked,\r\nby his love for Gibbon and Plutarch, by his interest in Marcus Aurelius\r\nand other writers on high themes. Others again tell us of his relations\r\nto his fellow-men, how recklessly generous he was to young and old, to\r\nBritish and Dutch, and how his generosity was abused: how his\r\nacquaintances preyed upon him; how, for all that, he kept his true\r\nfriendships few in number and he held them sacred. In fact, loyalty to\r\nfriends meant more to Rhodes than loyalty to principles. His temper was\r\nimpatient, especially in the last years of physical pain; he often tried\r\nto take short cuts to his ends, believing that his ends were worthy and\r\nknowing that life was short. He made many mistakes, but he retrieved\r\nthem nobly. He was in some ways rough-hewn and unpolished, but he was a\r\ngreat man.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to put in a short compass the many important questions\r\nwith which he dealt. His policy towards the natives was moderate and\r\nwise. He wished to educate them and then to trust them; to restrict the\r\nsale of liquor among them and to open to them the nobler lessons of\r\ncivilization; to give them the vote when they were educated enough to\r\nuse it well, but not before; to apply to them too his motto of 'Equal\r\nrights for every civilized man south of the Zambezi'. His policy towards\r\nthe Dutch was to establish identity of interest between the two nations\r\nand so to secure friendly relations with them; to draw them into\r\nco-operation in agriculture, in railways, in colonization, in export\r\ntrade, in imperial politics. He did his best to win over the Orange Free\r\nState by a policy of common railways, and even to break down the sullen\r\nopposition of the Transvaal. But the latter proved impossible. President\r\nKruger leant more and more upon Dutch counsellors from Holland; he\r\nlooked more and more to Delagoa Bay and turned his back upon Cape Town:\r\nand the antagonism became more acute. In 1895 Mr. Chamberlain initiated\r\na new era at the Colonial Office. He was actively awake to British\r\ninterests in all parts of the globe; and President Kruger, who had tried\r\nto check trade with Cape Town by stopping the Cape railway at his\r\nfrontier, and then by closing the 'Drifts' or fords over the Vaal, was\r\ncompelled to give way and to keep to the agreements made with the\r\nSuzerain State.\r\n\r\nA still more serious question was the treatment of the 'Uitlanders' or\r\nalien European settlers in the Transvaal. Though the Boer rulers took an\r\nincreasingly large share of their earnings, they restricted more and\r\nmore the grant of the franchise. In taxation, in commerce, in education,\r\nthere was no prospect between the Vaal and the Limpopo of 'Equal rights\r\nfor all civilized men' or anything like it. In June 1894 the High\r\nCommissioner frankly told Kruger that the Uitlanders had 'very real and\r\nsubstantial grievances'; in 1895 they were no less substantial, and\r\nagitation was rife in Johannesburg. On December 28, Jameson at the head\r\nof an armed column left Pitsani on the borders and rode into the\r\nTransvaal to support a rising against the Boer Government. The\r\nUitlanders were not expecting him; no rising took place, and Jameson's\r\nsmall column was surrounded some miles west of Johannesburg,\r\noutnumbered, and forced to surrender. The Jameson Raid, for which Rhodes\r\nwas generally held responsible, attracted all eyes in Europe as in\r\nAfrica. How President Kruger used his advantage against the Uitlanders,\r\namong whom Col. Frank Rhodes was a leader, can be read in many books:\r\nhere we need only relate how the event affected the Premier of Cape\r\nColony. He resigned office at once and put himself at the disposal of\r\nthe Government. Despite his past record he was judged by the Dutch,\r\nalike in the Cape and in the Transvaal, to have been the author of the\r\nRaid, and all chance of his doing further service in reconciling the two\r\nraces was at an end. The beginning of 1895 saw him at the height of his\r\nambition. The end of it saw his power shattered beyond repair.\r\n\r\nHis behaviour in this crisis enables us to know the real man. For a few\r\ndays he kept aloof, unapproachable, overcome by the ruin of his work. He\r\nmade no attempt to conciliate opinion: in moments of bitterness he\r\nscoffed at the 'unctuous rectitude' of certain politicians who were\r\nimproving the occasion. But he spoke frankly to those who had the right\r\nto question him. He went to London in February and saw Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nthe Colonial Secretary, and his Directors. He admitted that he was at\r\nfault. Believing that Kruger would always yield to a show of force, he\r\nhad been responsible for putting troops near the border to exercise\r\nmoral pressure. But neither then nor at any time had he given Jameson\r\norders to invade the Transvaal, or to precipitate an armed conflict,\r\nwhich he believed to be unnecessary. Such was his consistent statement,\r\nand he was ready to face, when the time should come, the Parliamentary\r\ncommittees appointed by the British and South African Houses to report\r\non the Raid. Meanwhile he put all brooding away and looked round for\r\nsome practical work. Fortunately he found it in the most congenial\r\nsphere. His colony of Rhodesia, to which he had gone straight from\r\nLondon, was threatened with disaster from a great native outbreak. The\r\ncauses were various. Rinderpest had spoiled one of the chief native\r\nindustries, and superstition had invented foolish reasons for it; also\r\nthe rumours, which were spreading about the Raid, made the natives\r\nbelieve that the British power was shaken. The Mashonas, as well as the\r\nMatabele, took part in the revolt which began early in April 1896. To\r\nmeet it the colonists mustered their full strength, while General\r\nCarrington was sent out from home with some regular troops. Several\r\nengagements in difficult country followed: the enemies' forces were\r\nquickly broken up, and by the end of July the time for negotiation was\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBut the chiefs of the Matabele had retired into their fortresses in the\r\nMatoppo hills and could not be reached. To send small columns to track\r\nthem down might mean needless loss of life: to keep the forces in the\r\nfield right through the winter was ruinous to the Company's finances.\r\nRhodes offered his own services as negotiator, and they were accepted.\r\nThe man who could carry his point with Jewish financiers and Dutch\r\npoliticians might hope to achieve his ends with the simpler native\r\nchiefs. But it was a sore trial of patience. He moved his own tent two\r\nmiles away from the British troops to the foot of the hills, sent native\r\nmessengers to the chiefs, and waited. During this time he was not idle:\r\nhe put in a lot of riding and of miscellaneous reading: his mind was\r\nactively employed in planning roads and dams for irrigation, in scheming\r\nfor the future greatness of the country. It was six weeks before a chief\r\nresponded. Gradually they began to drop in and to hold informal meetings\r\nround the tent, putting questions, replying to Rhodes's jokes, relapsing\r\ninto fits of silence, oblivious as all savages are of the value of time.\r\nHe would spend hours day after day in this apparently futile way;\r\naccustoming them to his presence, coaxing them into the right humour. At\r\nlast he persuaded them to meet him in a formal 'indaba', which must have\r\nbeen a dramatic scene. Alone he stood facing them, boldly reproaching\r\nthem with their bad faith and cruel acts. They stated their grievances:\r\nsome were admitted: satisfaction was promised. In the end peace was\r\nproclaimed and the delighted natives greeted him uproariously with the\r\ntitle of Lamula 'm Kunzi (Separator of the Fighting Bulls). The\r\ndiscussions were not over till the end of October, and it was a month\r\nlater ere Rhodes was able to leave the country and face the Committee in\r\nLondon--a very different gathering in very different surroundings. His\r\nwork during these two months was perhaps the greatest of his life; and\r\nthat he should have been able to concentrate all his powers upon it so\r\nsoon after the shattering blow of the Raid is a great tribute to his\r\nessential manliness and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe two Committees, sitting in London and Cape Town, agreed to censure,\r\nthough in modified terms, Rhodes's conduct over the Raid; but he still\r\nretained the respect of the bulk of his countrymen, and on his return\r\nthe citizens of Cape Town gave him an enthusiastic welcome. They and he\r\nwere looking ahead as well as behind: they felt that his services were\r\nstill needed for the establishing of a United South Africa under the\r\nBritish flag. But in this respect his work was done. The Cape Dutch were\r\nmore and more influenced by their sentiment for the Transvaal, and\r\nracial feeling ran high. Rhodes severed himself from all his old Dutch\r\ncolleagues and became more of a party leader. Meanwhile Kruger watched\r\nthe breach, assured himself of Dutch support, made no concessions to the\r\nUitlanders, repelled all overtures from Mr. Chamberlain, and steered\r\nstraight for war. Rhodes, despite his knowledge of the Dutch, made the\r\nmistake of believing up to the last moment that Kruger would give way\r\nand not fight; but, when the war broke out in 1899, he went up to\r\nKimberley to take his share of the work and the danger. The siege lasted\r\nabout four months, and Rhodes, though he failed to work harmoniously\r\nwith the military commandant, rendered many services to the town, thanks\r\nto his wealth, influence, and knowledge of the place. When the town was\r\nrelieved in February 1900, he went to Rhodesia and spent many months\r\nthere. Though he was urged by his followers to return to politics, Cape\r\nTown saw little of him; when he was not in the north, he was mostly at\r\nhis seaside cottage at Muizenberg, half-way between the capital and the\r\nCape of Good Hope. The heart complaint, from which he had suffered\r\nintermittently all his life, had rapidly grown worse; his last year was\r\none of great suffering, and in March 1902 he breathed his last at\r\nMuizenberg with Jameson and a few of his dearest friends around him. He\r\nwas buried in the place which he had himself chosen amid the Matoppo\r\nhills. On a bare hill-top seven gigantic boulders keep guard round the\r\nsimple tombstone on which his name is engraved. After the English\r\nservice was over, the natives celebrated in their own fashion the\r\npassing of the great chief who had already been enshrined in their\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAt Kimberley, at Cape Town, in the Matoppos, his work was done before\r\nthe nineteenth century was finished, and he had earned his rest. The\r\ncomplete union of the European races for which he laboured in Parliament\r\nis yet to come. The vast wealth which he won in Kimberley is fulfilling\r\na noble purpose. By his will he founded scholarships at Oxford for\r\nscholars from the Dominions and Colonies, from the United States and\r\nfrom Germany--his faith in the Anglo-Saxon race being extended to our\r\nTeutonic kinsmen. He regarded a common education and common ideals as\r\nthe surest cement of Empire. But above all else his name will be\r\npreserved among his countrymen by the provinces which he added to the\r\nBritish dominions. Kimberley and Cape Town have their monuments, their\r\nmemories of his many successes and his few failures: the Matoppos have\r\nhis grave. To us the peace and solitude of the hills where he lies may\r\nseem to contrast strangely with the stirring activity of his life. But\r\nsolitude will not reign there always, if Rhodes's ideal is fulfilled. It\r\nwas here that he had stood with a friend, looking towards the vast\r\nhorizon northwards, and, in an often-quoted sentence, expressed his\r\ndream for the future: 'Homes, more homes, that's what I work for!' So\r\nlong as our race produces such bold dreamers, such strenuous workers,\r\nits future, in Africa and elsewhere, need occasion no doubts or fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAberdeen, 4th Earl of, 32, 51\r\n\r\nActon, Lord, 5, 272, 325\r\n\r\nAdams, Professor J.
