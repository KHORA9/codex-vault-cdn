The paragraph headings\r\nshould be thoroughly fixed in mind and close attention should be given\r\nto the words in heavy type and Italics that occur in the body of a\r\nparagraph; together they form a convenient outline for the lesson. The\r\nquestions at the end of each lesson are to be used to test the pupils’\r\nmastery of the lesson material; all available works of reference should\r\nbe consulted for fuller information than the limited space of one book\r\nwill admit of, each member of the class preparing one or more abstracts\r\nto be read before the class. The review outlines and suggestions are\r\nto be used in the same way, special attention being given to written\r\nanswers such as would be required in an examination.\r\n\r\nWith a view of furnishing the reader a considerable amount of material\r\non the _growth_ of music as an art, biographical sketches have\r\nbeen made short, especially since so many excellent works of that\r\ndescription are available at a small price. Emphasis has been laid on\r\nthe work of the men who developed music, on the influences which shaped\r\ntheir careers and the permanent value of their contributions to music.\r\nA clear knowledge of how music reached its present state is not to be\r\nhad by studying books, biographical and critical; the _works_ of the\r\ncomposers must be examined, played and sung, compared, analyzed as to\r\nmethods of construction (Form) and expression (Melody, Harmony and\r\nRhythm), so that the student may appreciate the change from simple,\r\nelementary processes to the free, polyphonic style found in the complex\r\nmodern piano and orchestral scores. Reference is made to representative\r\ncompositions by classical and modern composers, which are part of the\r\naverage teaching repertoire. The works of the earlier composers are\r\nnot, however, readily accessible, although good examples of the style\r\nof the 16th and 17th centuries are in the cheap editions of Peters,\r\nLitolff, Augener, Breitkopf and Härtel, and Ricordi.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this book provides for two lessons a week for thirty weeks.\r\nThis will occupy a school year and allow time for quizzes, reviews and\r\nexaminations. If more time is available, the work may be divided into\r\nfour, five or six terms and stress laid on the study of representative\r\ncompositions, the preparation of short papers on the suggested topics,\r\nadding, as a feature to interest friends and music lovers generally,\r\npublic programs including music.\r\n\r\nMusical clubs will find in this book material for several years’\r\nprograms, special attention having been given to the lessons on modern\r\ncomposers and their music, the suggestions as to class-work applying\r\nwith equal force to the study classes of clubs. The individual reader\r\nshould follow out the suggested historical and biographical parallels\r\nwhich help so strongly to fix in the mind the periods in which\r\ncomposers lived.\r\n\r\nLessons III to VI were prepared by Dr. H. A. Clarke, of the University\r\nof Pennsylvania; Lessons VIII to XIV by Mr. Arthur L. Judson, of\r\nDenison University; Lessons XV and XVI by Mr. Preston Ware Orem, Mus.\r\nBac., of Philadelphia; Lessons XVII to XIX, XXI to XXIII, XXXVII to\r\nXL by Mr. Frederic S.

If we consider it\r\nfrom the material side, it is one of magnitude; we need but think of\r\nthe money invested in buildings, opera houses, schools, concert halls,\r\npublishing plants, factories, the sums spent on musical instruments,\r\ninstruction, concerts, opera, etc., to recognize the commercial\r\nside. When we think of the great army of persons whose livelihood is\r\nconditioned upon musical work, upon the great audiences that support\r\nmusical enterprises, we recognize the magnitude of music in a social\r\nsense, and that it offers a large field for study. These conditions,\r\ninteresting as they are, represent only phases of musical work, not\r\nMusic itself, and serve to show the place which Music occupies in the\r\nlife of today. Our investigation is, then, a consideration of the\r\norigin and development of Music, and the means by which it took shape.\r\n\r\n=The Place of Intellect in Music=.—When we think of Music we have\r\nin mind an organization of musical sounds into something definite,\r\nsomething by design, not by chance, the product of the working of\r\nthe human mind with musical sounds and their effects upon the human\r\nsensibilities. So long as man accepted the various phenomena of musical\r\nsounds as isolated facts, there could be no art. But when he began\r\nto use them to minister to his pleasure and to study them and their\r\neffects, he began to form an art of music. The story of music is the\r\nrecord of a series of attempts on the part of man to make artistic\r\nuse of the material which the ear accepts as capable of affording\r\npleasure and as useful in expressing the innermost feelings. The\r\nraw material of music consists of the sounds considered musical, the\r\nhuman voice, various musical instruments and the use of this material\r\nin such ways as to affect the human sensibilities; that is, to make\r\nan impression upon the hearer which shall coincide with that of the\r\noriginal maker of the music who gives to his feelings expression in\r\nmusic. We find in music, as in other branches, that man tries to reduce\r\nphenomena to order and to definite form. The mass of musical material\r\nis vague, incoherent, disorganized. Man seeks to devise ways to use it\r\nintelligibly, and to promote esthetic pleasure. If musical sounds are\r\nto be combined simultaneously or successively, this combination should\r\nbe in accordance with design, not haphazard, just as the builder of the\r\nhouse or the temple puts together his material according to a regular\r\nplan. Those who have been leaders in the Art of Music have labored in\r\ntwo ways: to _extend_ the limits of expression in music, and to find\r\nthe means to _contain_ that expression. At one period stress is laid\r\non making music expressive, at another on the medium for conveying\r\nexpression to others, the latter being comprehended in the term Form.\r\nIn connection with this statement, the student will do well to remember\r\nthat every period of great intellectual activity, social or political,\r\nreacted upon music and the other arts; to illustrate, we need but refer\r\nto the formal, even artificial character of the music of the period\r\npreceding the French Revolution and the freedom and vigor imparted by\r\nthe spirit of Romanticism which followed in the wake of that great\r\npolitical movement, a difference strikingly illustrated in the music of\r\nHaydn and Beethoven, Clementi and Schumann. There is also a constant\r\naction and reaction of the various racial streams of power such as\r\nthe Aryan on the Semitic, East upon the West, Latin upon the Teuton,\r\nFolk-music upon the Scholastic.\r\n\r\n=The Principles in Music=.—The leading principles in music are: Rhythm,\r\nMelody, Harmony, Color or Tone Quality, and in the execution of works\r\nof music, Dynamic Contrast, an essential factor in Expression. For\r\nages after the birth of Music, Rhythm and Melody were the only real\r\nelements, Rhythm being first recognized. The potency of Rhythm, strong\r\nand irresistible in the early days of the race and with primitive man,\r\nis still acknowledged. Music that lacks a clearly-defined rhythm does\r\nnot move the masses. Witness martial music, the dance airs and the\r\n“popular song.” All primitive languages were characterized by concise,\r\nfigurative and picturesque qualities; they easily changed from the\r\nordinary into the lofty and the impassioned. Intonation and changing\r\ninflection had much to do with meaning, as is the case with the Chinese\r\nlanguage of today. Historians ascribe the origin of Melody to this\r\nprinciple of vocal expression. For years prior to the Christian Era,\r\nand long after, Rhythm and Melody were the only accepted elements of\r\nMusic, and the art remained in a low grade of development. It was not\r\nuntil Harmony appeared, clear and unmistakable, that Music was able to\r\nclaim a position equal to that accorded to the sister-arts, Poetry,\r\nPainting, Sculpture and Architecture. These principles, Rhythm, Melody\r\nand Harmony, became, when couched in the forms of expression adopted by\r\nthe great masters, what we call Modern Music, and the story is one of\r\na development from extreme simplicity to the complexity illustrated in\r\nmodern orchestral scores.\r\n\r\n=Means of Expression=.—One more phase must be mentioned here, the means\r\nused to present to others the thoughts or feelings of the composer,\r\nthat is, the human voice and its artistic use, instruments of various\r\nkinds, their primitive forms and gradual development, their use singly\r\nand in combination with other instruments. This phase is peculiarly\r\nassociated with modern music; for it was not until the art had freed\r\nitself from the fetters imposed by vocal music, that absolute music,\r\navailing itself of perfected instruments, came into its own. From that\r\ntime development was unprecedentedly rapid.\r\n\r\n=What is to be Brought Forward=.—The history of Music is, then, a\r\nrecital of facts bearing upon the development of modern music and\r\nwe shall lay stress on such facts as show a permanent impress and a\r\nsolid contribution to progress in one or more of the lines marked out:\r\nForm, Expression, Melody, Rhythm, Harmony and Instrumental Color. In\r\nthe study of a composer, the facts essential to the history of music\r\nare critical rather than biographical; not a life chronicle so much\r\nas a clear statement of what he specially contributed to forward the\r\nart. To gain an educational value, the facts of the history of music\r\nare to be studied so as to glean from them their significance, and an\r\nunderstanding of the causes and conditions which made them possible;\r\nthen we go on to discern the consequences to which they in turn gave\r\nrise. No man works for himself and out of himself. He builds upon what\r\nothers have done, and he builds for others. The student should discern\r\nthe lesson in the past, and receive guidance for the future.\r\n\r\n=What We Learn from Archæology=.—The history of an art such as Music\r\nmust give the historical data in connection with the development of\r\nart and artists, free of all questionable and false features, and\r\ngive as trustworthy, as accurate a picture of the various stages as\r\npossible. If we go backward in our research we reach a point at which\r\nordinary records fail. If we make an inquiry into the beginnings of\r\nmusic we must have recourse to the findings and interpretations of\r\nArchæology. The results are by no means satisfactory. In all the\r\ndigging in the ruins of the once great cities of Egypt, and Western\r\nAsia, and of Greece and Etruria as well, with perhaps one exception,\r\nno music has been brought to light, and but a few instruments, and\r\nthese can scarcely be considered perfect. However, the pictorial\r\nrepresentations on tombs, monuments, temples and houses give valuable\r\naid, enabling scholars to reconstruct the story of music among the\r\nolder civilizations. We must not forget, however, that conjecture\r\nplays a more or less prominent part in all the translations of the\r\nold hieroglyphic and cuneiform writings. We have no direct knowledge\r\nof the scales used or how the instruments were played together, what\r\nwas the nature of the science and system in use. What we have is mere\r\ninference from the nature of the instruments and the representations\r\nof musicians playing their instruments, together with fragments from\r\ncontemporary or later writings.\r\n\r\n=What We Learn from Ethnology=.—Another source open to students of the\r\nbeginnings of music is the material gathered by Ethnology. Those who\r\nplace stress on this means of research lay down the proposition that\r\nthe primitive people of the world of today occupy a mental and social\r\nstage similar to that of the primitive races from which the civilized\r\nfolk of today have sprung. Therefore, they study the music, the rude\r\nchants, the dances, the instruments, etc., of various primitive tribes,\r\nand then by comparison try to indicate the various stages through which\r\nmusic came to have the art germ, from which the great product we know\r\nhas developed.\r\n\r\n=Some Theories=.—We can give in this lesson only a few of the theories\r\noffered by those who have discussed the matter of the origin of music:\r\nThe Dance, Poetry and Music form a group which cannot readily be\r\nseparated; they are not independent of each other, but most intimately\r\nconnected. This view fails to take account of the fact that Music\r\nwhich is, externally, so closely connected with the Dance and with\r\nPoetry, is, in its essence, absolutely distinct. Schopenhauer, the\r\nphilosopher from whom Richard Wagner drew inspiration, holds this view\r\nvery strongly. He says: “Music is quite independent of the visible\r\nworld, is absolutely ignorant of it, and could exist in a certain way\r\nif there were no world; which cannot be said of the other arts.” The\r\nother arts are essentially imitative and representative; they are\r\nbased upon Nature. Some writers, the Frenchman Dubos and the English\r\nphilosopher Herbert Spencer among them, claim that Music does represent\r\nNature. They say that as the painter imitates the forms and colors\r\nhe sees in nature, so the musician follows the various modulations\r\nof the voice, finding there the basic conceptions of Rhythm, Melody\r\nand Color. Singing, which Spencer considers the original music, is\r\nthe emphasizing and intensifying of the properties of speech. Gurney\r\nsays, _per contra_, that “Music creates audible forms, successions\r\nand combinations of tones which have no prototype in Nature and\r\ndo not exist outside of Music.” Those who believe that Music is a\r\nseparate entity therefore seek to trace it to a completely independent\r\nbeginning.[1] Darwin offered another theory as to the way in which man\r\narrived at Music. His idea is that the faculty of producing musical\r\ntones and rhythm was first acquired by our animal ancestors as a\r\nmeans of attracting the opposite sex, the faculty being developed and\r\nimproved by the process of selection.\r\n\r\n=The Conception of Fixed Scales=.—The question is sometimes raised:\r\nHow did man reach the conception of fixed scales? Here again opinions\r\ndiffer. Some consider that the extreme notes were fixed by the average\r\ncompass of the human voice in impassioned speech, the interval being\r\nvariously divided. Others claim that along with the vocal phase\r\nof music there was an instrumental side, and that the mechanical\r\nconditions in connection with instruments had bearing in the matter\r\nof organizing sounds into a scale; the rude, primitive trumpet of\r\nwood or bark, still found among forest tribes in South America and\r\nAfrica, gives a series of harmonic notes. Whistles or flutes made\r\nin prehistoric times with a series of several tones, examples of\r\ncombinations of little pipes, such as those known by the name of “Pan’s\r\nPipes,” also bear on this question. Yet the facts are few and we are\r\ncompelled to satisfy ourselves with mere conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nTylor.—Anthropology.\r\n\r\nRowbotham.—History of Music.\r\n\r\nSmith.—The World’s Earliest Music.\r\n\r\nGrosse.—The Beginnings of Art.\r\n\r\nRaymond.—The Genesis of Art.\r\n\r\nHelmholtz.—The Sensations of Tone.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music.\r\n\r\nBosanquet.—History of Aesthetic.\r\n\r\nKnight.—Philosophy of the Beautiful, Part II, Chap.

If the reference books\r\nsuggested are available, additional reading should be done. A good\r\nplan is for the teacher to assign one or two paragraphs to a pupil and\r\nhave the latter bring in such other information of interest as can be\r\nsecured. Some questions may be grouped and pupils directed to prepare\r\na short essay to be read before the class. In regard to dates, the\r\nsuggestion is that pupils take turns, lesson by lesson, in presenting\r\na plan by which to memorize them. When the period is one that can be\r\nrelated to some well-known event in general history, as the life of\r\nCharlemagne, the Norman Conquest of England, the Crusades, the Wars of\r\nthe Roses, discovery of America, invention of printing, etc., it is\r\nwell to do so; or make a well-known musician a contemporary of some\r\nartist, statesman, king, scientist, man of letters, etc. The teacher\r\nshould be prepared in this manner for each lesson. Events before the\r\nChristian Era may be related to some event or character in Biblical\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON I.\r\n\r\n              MUSIC OF THE CHINESE, JAPANESE AND HINDOOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sources of Our Knowledge=.—When we study the music of the early period\r\nof the human race, we find no records such as we are storing today in\r\nour libraries. We must depend upon the discoveries of archæologists in\r\nthe buried cities of early civilizations. Of contemporaneous books,\r\nproperly speaking, tablets of music explaining the construction and\r\nmethods of playing the musical instruments then in use we have few;\r\nif they exist they are in dead languages to which scholars are but\r\nslowly finding the key. It is true that some instruments have been\r\nfound, but we can have no certainty that they are in perfect condition.\r\nThe principal sources of the information we possess have been the\r\npaintings, decorations and sculptures on monuments and on the walls\r\nof buildings and tombs that have been unearthed. Early languages\r\nwere largely pictorial, and records kept in this manner furnish us\r\nrepresentations of the religious, martial, and social life of the early\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n=Countries with a Musical Past=.—The lands that offer the greatest\r\nfield for the study of the music of the past are Chaldea or Babylonia\r\nand Egypt. Some of the old Greek cities, as well as cities in the\r\nwestern part of Asia Minor and Palestine, have been the subject of\r\nexplorations. Still another country abounding in interest to the\r\nstudent of the music of the past is China, living, yet dead! What a\r\ncontrast to Chaldea and Egypt! The civilization of the latter is dead;\r\nChina, the older, is still living. These races had a common home, yet\r\nthe former, having developed a high civilization and fulfilled its\r\nmission, disappeared from the face of the earth, while China, having\r\nalso reached a high state of culture, has remained stagnant, all\r\nenergies toward a higher level being arrested.\r\n\r\n=The Common Home of the Race=.—Scientists place the cradle of the\r\nhuman race in the high plateau of Asia, extending from Persia eastward\r\nthrough Thibet and including part of Manchuria. The yellow race,\r\naccording to some ethnologists, is the more akin to the primitive\r\nrace; the other two, the white and the black, being derived from it\r\nby emigration, change of climate and mode of living. Van Aalst, the\r\nleading writer on Chinese Music, says that “the first invaders of China\r\nwere a band of immigrants fighting their way among the aborigines and\r\nsupposed to have come from the country south of the Caspian Sea.” It is\r\noutside the province of this work to detail the arguments that serve\r\nto show the connection of the Chinese with the other races mentioned.\r\nBerosus, the old Babylonian historian, writes: “There was originally\r\nin the land of Babylon a multitude of men of foreign race who had\r\nsettled in Chaldea.” These men are known in history by the name of\r\nAkkads or Akkadians, “from the northern mountains,” Sumerians, from the\r\n“southern mountains”; that is, the highland ranges lying to the north\r\nand east of the Euphrates Valley. There were two main types among these\r\ntribes: a yellow, black-haired people, and a red type. The records\r\nshow that migrations from this central home came about by reason of\r\nfamines, plagues or floods. When did the black-haired, yellow people\r\nswarm off? When did the “red” people, from which Egyptian tradition\r\nclaimed ancestry, go away? Probably the Chinese were the first to leave\r\nthe central home, taking with them the elements of a considerable\r\ncivilization, which also formed the basis of the later Chaldean,\r\nBabylonian, Assyrian and Egyptian cultures, and through various\r\nchannels, of the Etrurian and Greek.\r\n\r\n=High Place of Music Among the Chinese=.—The science of music had\r\na high place in Chinese philosophy; the sages alone comprehend the\r\ncanons, and the mandarins in music are considered superior to those\r\nin mathematics. Some most interesting dates are given, showing how\r\nearly the Chinese had developed a science of music. We are told that\r\nin 2277 B. C., there were twenty-two writers on the dance and music,\r\ntwenty-three on ancient music, twenty-four on playing the _Kin_ and the\r\n_Che_, and twenty-five on construction of scales. These facts imply\r\nmany years of previous development before the time when works treating\r\nof the science of music would be prepared. Confucius, the chief Chinese\r\nphilosopher, wrote about ancient music in 551 B. C. Unfortunately,\r\nancient records and books were almost entirely destroyed, 246 B. C.,\r\nby order of the Emperor then on the throne; he excepted from this\r\ndestruction only works on medicine, agriculture and divination. A\r\ncomparison of recorded dates shows that the Chinese were writing\r\nlearned works on the science of music when the Pharaohs were building\r\nthe pyramids.\r\n\r\n=Sonorous Bodies=.—The Chinese have always shown a fondness for\r\ninstituting likenesses between things in heaven and earth, and things\r\nintellectual and material. According to their theory, there are eight\r\nsound-giving bodies: Stone, Metal, Silk, Bamboo, Wood, Skin, Gourd and\r\nClay.\r\n\r\n=The Sheng=.—One of the most important musical instruments in use among\r\nthe Chinese, one that is indispensable to their temple ritual, is the\r\nSheng. This instrument is the representative of the =gourd= principle;\r\noriginally the bowl was formed from a portion of a gourd or a calabash,\r\nthe top being covered by a circular piece of wood with holes around the\r\nmargin in which the pipes, seventeen in number, are fixed; in the side\r\nof the gourd is placed a mouthpiece or tube covered with ivory, through\r\nwhich the player _draws_ his breath. Each pipe is fitted with a small\r\nfree reed of copper. A small hole is made in each pipe just above the\r\nbowl, which prevents a pipe from speaking when the air is drawn in by\r\nthe player, unless the hole is closed by a finger. The instrument is\r\nplaced to the mouth with the pipes slanting toward the right shoulder.\r\nThe notes sounded by the pipes of the _Sheng_ as they are arranged are:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\ngiving the following scale or series of sounds:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nfour of the seventeen pipes are mutes, placed there doubtless for\r\npurposes of symmetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KIN. SE OR CHE. SHENG.]\r\n\r\n=The Kin=.—The principle of the sound of =silk= is exemplified in the\r\nKin or Ch’in, the strings, “made of twisted silk, being stretched\r\nover a wooden frame.” This instrument was the favorite of Confucius,\r\nthe great law-giver, and in _his_ time was of _great antiquity_. The\r\nnumber of strings was five, to agree with the five elements; the upper\r\npart was rounded, to represent the heavens; the bottom was flat, to\r\nrepresent the ground. The number of strings was later increased to\r\nseven, which is the favored form, tuned to G, A, C, D, E, G, A, a\r\npentatonic scale.\r\n\r\n=The Se=.—Another stringed instrument is the _Sê_, (also written\r\n_Che_), which had originally fifty strings. As now used, it has only\r\ntwenty-five strings. Four kinds are in use, differing in size and in\r\nnumber of strings; it is customary that they should give the sound of\r\ntwo notes simultaneously, generally octaves. Some of these, used by the\r\nmost skilful performers, have only thirteen or fourteen strings. The\r\nstrings are plucked by two small ivory picks.\r\n\r\n=Flutes=.—The sound of =bamboo= is exemplified in certain instruments\r\nof the flute family. The bamboo plant is used by the Chinese in very\r\nmany ways; it is natural that they should use it for making musical\r\ninstruments. There are two types of pipes or flutes: those blown at\r\nthe end, as a whistle, and those blown across a hole near one end,\r\nas is our modern flute; the Chinese flutes are of the latter class.\r\nThey varied in size and in the number of holes, from three to six, the\r\nlittle finger of each hand not being used. A popular flute, called the\r\n_Ti-Tzu_, has, in addition to the six finger holes, one for blowing\r\nand one covered with a thin membrane, to vary the sound. Another kind,\r\nvery ancient, and much in use, according to Chinese writers during the\r\nperiod 2205-1122 B. C., may be called, shortly, the _Tche_. It has six\r\nfinger holes, three near each end, and is pierced with another hole\r\nat the middle, across which the player blows. The scale is said to\r\nconsist of six semitones, beginning with F, fifth line treble clef. The\r\npeculiar construction of this flute presents some acoustical problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TCHE.]\r\n\r\n=Other sonorous bodies= are, =metal= from which the Chinese make gongs,\r\nbells and trumpets—they seem to have known the principle of the slide,\r\nas in the trombone, but never developed it; =stone=, certain varieties,\r\nin the shape of the letter L, pierced with a hole at the angle,\r\nsuspended in a frame and struck by a hammer; =skin=, from which drums\r\nwere made; =clay=, from which instruments were made in shape resembling\r\nthe ocarina, familiar to us.\r\n\r\n=Chinese Scales=.—The vocal and the instrumental music have different\r\nscales, the former _diatonic_—with two notes of the seven omitted,\r\nforming a _pentatonic_ (five-tone scale), the letters of which, since\r\nF is a favorite tonic, may be represented by F, G, A, C, D. The\r\ninstrumental scales are _chromatic_ in character. When the voice is\r\naccompanied by instruments, the vocal scale is used. Singing is in\r\nunison, modified by fourths, occasionally. The singing tone is a sort\r\nof nasal sing-song, the favorite method a nasal falsetto, the mouth\r\nbeing nearly closed.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThis represents the concluding strophes of the Hymn to Confucius. The\r\ntime is very slow; each measure represents a line of four syllables;\r\nbetween the lines one of the instruments gives a sort of interlude.\r\n\r\nSo much space has been taken with Chinese music because the\r\nconservatism of that race has preserved instruments and music that date\r\nback to the early history of our race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOTO.]\r\n\r\n=Japanese Music=.—In the Japanese system we find a _pentatonic_ scale\r\nand a _semitonal_ division of the octave. Japanese music does not\r\nproceed in semitones, the chromatic scale being demanded by the custom\r\nof transposing a melody from one starting point to another, not more\r\nthan fourteen sounds for a melody. A favorite Japanese instrument is of\r\nthe clarinet type; it is called the _Hichi-riki_; in length it varies\r\nfrom a little less than nine inches to a little more. The scale as set\r\nforth by the Institute of Tokio is from G, second line, treble staff to\r\nthe A above, F, fifth line, being sharped. This instrument is played\r\nby _drawing_ in the breath. The Japanese have an instrument called\r\nthe _Sho_, similar to the Chinese _Sheng_. The national instrument\r\nis the _Koto_, which has thirteen strings, tuned thus: the first,\r\nmiddle C sharp, the second, F sharp a fifth lower; subsequent strings\r\nascend in order, G sharp, A, C sharp, D, F sharp, G sharp, A, C sharp,\r\nD, F sharp, G sharp; between the fourth and fifth sounds is a third,\r\nwhich interval, in practice, was filled by pressing the string behind\r\nthe bridge, thus increasing the tension; each string can be raised\r\na semitone or even a tone by increasing the pressure. By this means\r\nadditional notes can be secured, giving a scale identical with the\r\nGreek Dorian or ecclesiastical Aeolian. Much of the popular Japanese\r\nmusic is written without the extra notes, and the series of tones can\r\nbe characterized as a pentatonic scale based on the natural minor. Thus:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=The Hindoos=.—Among the Asiatic races that still retain national,\r\nalthough not a separate political existence, and have a musical system\r\npeculiar to themselves, the Hindoos are prominent. The Hindoos belong\r\nto the Aryan race, (from which we also sprang), and had their home\r\noriginally in Central Asia, probably north of the Hindoo Koosh range.\r\nWhen they swarmed off from the old home they made their way down\r\nthrough the mountains along the river valleys to the great fertile\r\nplains of India, and conquering the aboriginal races, developed the\r\nsystem of caste, which has had so great an influence on their religion,\r\nliterature, science and art. The old Hindoo literature shows clearly\r\nthe high regard in which the art of song was held. Celebrated minstrels\r\nwere maintained in the royal courts whose duty it was to chant songs\r\nin praise of their patrons. Music, or song, was just as indispensable\r\nin the religious ceremonies. One of the holy books makes the statement\r\nthat “Indra rejects the offering made without music.” In time the\r\nsinger became a member of the priestly caste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINA. RAVANASTRON.]\r\n\r\n=The Vina=.—From antiquity to the present time among the Hindoos pure\r\ninstrumental music held almost equal place with song or accompanied\r\nvocal music. The Hindoo instruments belong to the percussion types,\r\ntrumpets and trombones, nose flute, and especially to the stringed\r\nclass. It is noteworthy that the simpler kinds, in which each string\r\ngives but one tone, do not exist, whereas there are many varieties of\r\nthose which have fingerboards. The oldest and most important is the\r\nVina, which consists of a wooden pipe about four feet long attached to\r\ntwo gourds or resonators. The seven metal strings are stretched over\r\nnineteen bridges or frets, becoming gradually higher, and touch only\r\nthe last and highest one. The other eighteen serve to fix the pitch of\r\nthe tone desired, as in our guitar or mandolin, the strings being set\r\nin vibration by being plucked with a metal thimble or ring like that\r\nused by zither players. Another Hindoo instrument, considered by some\r\nas the prototype of stringed instruments played with a bow, is the\r\nRavanastron.\r\n\r\n=Hindoo Musical Philosophy=.—Hindoo myths ascribe a divine origin to\r\nmusic. A close connection was established between the scale and their\r\nreligious ideas. Each single tone was under the protection of a nymph,\r\nand the first syllables of the names of these nymphs, according to\r\nClement, the French historian, were given to the tones, thus: Sa, Ri,\r\nGa, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni, seven in all, differing in that respect from the\r\n_pentatonic_ form _usually_ found among the early races. In their\r\nendeavor to satisfy the melody of speech, the inflections of the voice\r\nin speaking, the Hindoos divided the interval of the octave into\r\nsmall parts, and transposed the scale freely up and down; so it is\r\neasily conceivable that their complete system recognized 960 scales,\r\ntheir sacred writings speaking of 16,000. In practice they contented\r\nthemselves with 36, some writers say 72. The following is given as the\r\nscale:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of Hindoo music is the melody and rhythm, the\r\nlatter being very complicated. Of harmony in our sense of the word\r\nthere is no sign. In accompanying the voice the Hindoos used only the\r\npure fifth, which they considered a perfect consonance, the fourth, an\r\nimperfect consonance, and the octave.\r\n\r\n=High Esteem of Music Among the Hindoos=.—Music had a high place among\r\nthe Hindoos, all festivities made use of it, and the private and social\r\nlife demanded it. It was used freely in the Hindoo drama, the latter\r\ncalling for the dance, spoken and sung dialogue and instrumental\r\nmusic and songs. The main reason why Hindoo music did not develop in\r\nthe past centuries doubtless lies in the fact that, as in Egypt, the\r\nruling power was vested in the priesthood, which controlled all the\r\narts and sciences. Music was so interwoven with their religious rites\r\nand observances, and so hedged around with irrevocable and sacred\r\nlaws that the slightest alteration was considered a sacrilege. In\r\nclosing this section it may be added that investigators refer the\r\ngipsies, particularly those of Hungary, who are noted for their musical\r\ntemperament, to Hindoo origin, probably the pariah caste. Their music,\r\nwith its wild, free rhythm and elaborate melodic embellishment, has a\r\nmarked resemblance to the music of the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nSmith.—The World’s Earliest Music.\r\n\r\nAnderson.—The Story of Extinct Civilizations.\r\n\r\nRice.—What is Music?\r\n\r\nPiggott.—Music and Musical Instruments of Japan.\r\n\r\nDay.—Musical Instruments of the Deccan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat is the source of our information as to the beginnings of music?\r\n\r\nWhat countries are being explored by archæologists?\r\n\r\nWhere was the cradle of the human race?\r\n\r\nWhich branch was probably the first to “swarm off”?\r\n\r\nHow ancient are some Chinese records concerning music?\r\n\r\nWhat are the sound-giving bodies according to Chinese theories?\r\n\r\nGive an example of each kind.\r\n\r\nDescribe the _Sheng_, _Kin_, _Che_ and _Tche_.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of scale is used in Chinese vocal music?\r\n\r\nWhat is the Japanese national instrument?\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of instruments did the Hindoos have?

Nations rise into prominence and fall again; cities are\r\nbuilt to be torn down by conquerors; even the face of the earth has\r\nchanged since the days when the scions of the Aryan race began to leave\r\ntheir home in Central Asia. Arms of the sea have shrunk to rivers,\r\nrivers to shallow streams, the desert sands have encroached on the once\r\nfertile valleys, and choked the springs and brooks of the meadows.\r\nGeologists tell us that the great valleys were made by the alluvial\r\ndeposit washed down from the hills and mountains by the streams. The\r\nChinese followed the course of the great rivers that made toward the\r\neastern seas, the Hindoos toward the southern ocean, and still another\r\n“swarm” followed the great rivers Euphrates and Tigris, which came\r\nfrom the mountains of Western Asia. The great valley lying between the\r\ndesert and the mountains, a scene of waste and ruin as far back as\r\nthe time of ancient Greece and Rome, was once a most important centre\r\nof population and wealth, the home for centuries of races that had\r\nreached a high degree of culture in the arts and sciences, and the\r\nseat of what may be considered the oldest of extinct civilizations.\r\nThe valley was wonderfully fertile, was brought to a high degree of\r\ncultivation and supported an enormous population. As an instance of\r\nthe physical changes that have taken place in this region, it may be\r\nmentioned that about 4000 B. C., the Tigris and the Euphrates entered\r\nthe sea by different mouths, instead of joining as now and in the days\r\nof Abraham, the patriarch, who came from this region, and the town\r\nidentified by modern scholars as “Ur of the Chaldees,” which is now 150\r\nmiles up the Euphrates, was an important seaport.\r\n\r\n=The Chaldeans=.—When the Aryans came down into this valley they\r\nfound already established there a people whose records are now being\r\nunearthed, called Akkads, belonging to the Mongolian family, who had\r\nreached a high degree of cultivation in art and science. The records\r\nfound show that music was an important branch of study; at a very early\r\ndate the harp, pipe and cymbals are mentioned, and we infer that the\r\npeople were fond of singing, since many sacred hymns have been recorded\r\nin tablets. This race, joined to others, founded the Chaldean kingdom,\r\nthe capital being Babylon. In the 12th century B. C., a king of\r\nAssyria, in the northern part of the Tigris valley, conquered Babylon\r\nand thus gained the ascendancy.\r\n\r\n=The Practice of Music Among the Babylonians=.—In the great ruins now\r\nbeing excavated, tablets of clay have been found which give a vivid\r\nidea of the social and religious esteem in which music was held by the\r\nBabylonians. One of these tablets, said to date back more than three\r\nthousand years B. C., contains a representation of musicians. One\r\nstrikes with a hammer upon a metal plate, another carries a reed pipe,\r\na third plays upon a harp of eleven strings, while two others beat\r\ntime or give the accent by clapping their hands. Especially rich in\r\nsculpture is the palace of Sennacherib. One of the relief decorations\r\nshows a festival procession in honor of the returning conqueror.\r\nIn front walk five men, three with harps, a fourth with a kind of\r\nlyre, whose strings were struck with a plectrum; the fifth bears a\r\ndouble flute. Two of the harpers and the lyre player dance. Then\r\nfollow six women, of whom four carry harps, one blows a double flute,\r\nwhile the last beats a sort of drum. Following the instrumentalists\r\ncome six women and six children singing, who indicate the rhythm by\r\nclapping their hands. From the fact that in these sculptures a few\r\nsoldiers indicate an army, we infer that the Babylonians made use\r\nof large bodies of players and singers in their great ceremonies.\r\nThese tablets indicate that the Babylonians made much use of trumpets\r\nto give signals to the armies and when great masses of the people\r\nwere gathered together. That musicians were highly esteemed we judge\r\nfrom the fact that on one occasion Sennacherib spared the lives of\r\nmusicians among his captives, all others being put to death. Since the\r\nChaldeans, especially, were famous as astronomers and mathematicians,\r\nit is thought that they, like the Egyptian sages, had knowledge of the\r\nmathematical relations of the various intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSYRIAN HARP (SAMBUCA). SANTIR.]\r\n\r\n=Chaldean Instruments=.—Two instruments seem to be especially\r\nnoticeable: the Symphonia and Sambuca. The former was carried to\r\nPalestine by the Hebrews, at the end of their captivity, and, according\r\nto their accounts, seems to have been a sort of bagpipe, an instrument\r\nparticularly suited to a pastoral people like the early Chaldeans.\r\nAs to the Sambuca we have no authentic knowledge; it seems, however,\r\nto have been an instrument of the zither type, held horizontally and\r\nplayed with a plectrum.[2] A stringed instrument, struck with a hammer,\r\ncalled the Santir is credited to the Assyrians.\r\n\r\n=Egyptian Music=.—When the great Alexandrian Library of 495,000 works\r\nof Persian, Chaldean, Hebrew, Egyptian, Greek and Roman literature\r\nwas partly destroyed during Julius Cæsar’s battles with the native\r\nEgyptians, in 47 B. C., and finally, A. D. 391, by Christian fanatics,\r\nhistory suffered an irreparable loss. Treasures of learning in all\r\nbranches, the records of early civilizations perished, never to be\r\nreplaced. Today we are dependent upon the discoveries of explorers in\r\nthe ruins of the great Egyptian cities, temples, tombs and pyramids.\r\nThe Egyptians believed that articles of necessity to the living being\r\nwere necessary to the individual in a future existence. If certain\r\nthings could not, in reality, be placed in the tomb, a pictorial\r\nrepresentation would have almost equal value in the invisible world.\r\nIn Egyptian tombs pipes or “flutes” have been found, and in one\r\ninstance, in the tomb of a musician, the bronze cymbals he played\r\nwhen alive. In the various tombs and ruins that have been examined by\r\nexplorers, pictorial representations of practically every phase of\r\nEgyptian life have been found. The sources for our knowledge, almost\r\nwholly inferential, are, then, the various pictorial and sculptured\r\nrepresentations of the Egyptian musical instruments and the manner in\r\nwhich they were used, and a few fragments of their sacred books, which\r\nwere forty-two in number, two being devoted to music, although but one\r\nfragment has been found. It must be noted, further, that the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, although nominally a monarchy, limited, not absolute, was\r\nin reality theocratic. The priestly caste had final power, and the\r\nrules and regulations drawn up by them prescribed the minutest detail\r\nof life, crushing all possibility of independent thought and freedom of\r\naction, a condition fatal to high artistic development.\r\n\r\n=Place of Music in Egyptian Life=.—To show the place of music in\r\nEgyptian life, the following from Ambros’ history will serve admirably:\r\n“From these decorations [on the walls of tombs] we perceive that the\r\nEgyptians made great use of music. We find harps of many sizes and\r\nshapes, small and easily portable, to others beyond the height of\r\na man, crude and of the utmost simplicity, to others elaborate and\r\nextremely rich in decoration. We note an almost endless variety of\r\n=lyres=, =guitars= and =mandolins= [that is, similar in type to the\r\ninstruments we know by these names], single and double flutes, played\r\nby hands of numerous musicians, together with male and female singers.\r\nMusic was used to accompany the dance, the funeral cortège,[3] the\r\nbanquet and other social functions. Inscriptions show that there were\r\nmusicians of high social position at the court.”\r\n\r\n=Egyptian Instruments=.—The records show a development of music from\r\na crude simplicity in early days to a brilliant and complex system\r\nalongside of the changes in other arts and the sciences, some of the\r\ndiscoveries going as far back as 1625 B. C. We give illustrations of\r\nseveral forms of the Egyptian =harps=. The number of strings varied\r\nfrom three or four to twenty-one. Mr. J. F. Rowbotham, the English\r\nhistorian of music, says that “taking B below the bass staff as the\r\nlowest note of the Egyptian scale, (since it likely followed the\r\nAssyrian in this respect) the compass of the great harp would extend\r\nto E, first line, treble staff. The small harps of various sizes had\r\na compass from D, third line, bass staff, to D or E above the treble\r\nstaff. Another series of stringed instruments, known under the general\r\nname, lyres, had the same compass as the small harps; the lutes had\r\na low G, (bass) string, and the highest note was C or D on the\r\ntreble staff; various forms of the flutes had about the same compass;\r\npipes, [which may be represented by the flageolet of today] had a\r\ncompass of about one octave upward from E, fourth space, treble clef.\r\nOther instruments were of the percussion character, =tambourines=,\r\n=drums=, =cymbals=, etc. Although the Egyptians used their instruments\r\nin combination, there is reason to believe their practice was the\r\nalternation of groups, only occasionally using all simultaneously, to\r\nsecure fulness and power of tone.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORIZONTAL HARP. SMALL HARP. GREAT HARP.]\r\n\r\n=Philosophy and Practice of Egyptian Music=.—The consensus of opinion\r\nis that Egyptian music was melodic in character, the instruments\r\nor voices playing or singing in different octaves, rejecting other\r\nintervals. As the Greeks seem to have drawn from the Egyptians much\r\nof their practice in music, it is reasonable to suppose that they\r\nwould have used harmony if the Egyptians had been accustomed to make\r\nuse of it. As to the Egyptian theory of music we have no information.\r\nSince, however, Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher, was a student of\r\nthe Egyptian school for priests, we infer that his teachings were\r\nfounded on the science he acquired there; hence it is probable that the\r\nEgyptians were familiar with a seven-fold division of the octave and\r\nthe mathematical relations of the fourth and fifth, as well as other\r\nintervals of the scale. Of the old Egyptian hymns we have no remains\r\nunless it be, as some assert, that fragments still exist among the\r\nCoptic Christians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSVERSE FLUTE. DOUBLE FLUTE.]\r\n\r\n=The Hebrews=.—What a wonderful history is that of the Hebrews! It\r\nhas seen nation after nation rise to power and go down. It has been\r\nenslaved, seemingly beyond all possibility of recovering a national\r\nexistence, yet regained place. Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Rome, held\r\nthe Hebrews, yet the latter are still with us, as a distinct race,\r\nwhile their conquerors have but pages of history. A glance at the\r\nhistory of the race will show that they touched the sources of early\r\ncivilization. Abraham was a resident, according to the Bible story, of\r\nUr in the land of the Chaldees, where a considerable civilization had\r\nbeen attained. From here he went to Canaan, thence to Egypt, and back\r\nagain to the country east of the Red Sea. When his descendants went to\r\nEgypt they must have carried with them Syrian music and instruments,\r\ndoubtless preserving a trace of Chaldean influence. It was during the\r\nfour centuries’ sojourn in Egypt that the Hebrews, though for a time\r\nenslaved, gained the proportions of a nation. As their duties placed\r\nthem in close relations to their masters, they gained considerable of\r\nthe Egyptian science, literature, customs, etc. At that time, musicians\r\nwere slaves, and tradition says that Miriam, the sister of Moses, was a\r\nslave dancing-girl and singer. We know that Moses was instructed in the\r\nlearning of the Egyptian priesthood, and in that capacity officiated\r\nin some of the functions of the temple services. Such facts as these\r\ngo far to justify the idea that the Hebrews gained their fundamental\r\nnotions of music and musical instruments during their long sojourn in\r\nEgypt. Some writers claim that the songs of the Hebrews were adapted to\r\nEgyptian chants. The pastoral life led by the descendants of Abraham,\r\nthe period of slavery which the Hebrews suffered in Egypt, and the\r\nsubsequent migratory life in the wilderness were not adapted to develop\r\na people’s song. The life in Palestine for many years was a strenuous\r\none; and then came another period of slavery among the Assyrians, by\r\nwhich the Hebrew ideas were again modified.\r\n\r\n=A Religious People=.—The Hebrews were an intensely religious people,\r\nthe code delivered to them by Moses fixing the status of music up to\r\nthe time of the pleasure-loving Solomon. Their music, in distinction\r\nfrom that of the nations around them, was not sensuous but a true\r\n_musica sacra_, in this respect more a matter of religion than of art.\r\nDuring the reign of David, the Levites were organized as the singers\r\nfor the Temple services. Music and poetry were the chief subjects of\r\ninstruction. David himself composed many of the tunes to which his\r\nPsalms were sung.\r\n\r\n=Hebrew Poetry and Its Relation to Their Music=.—The key to the music\r\nof the Hebrews is their poetry. They grew to numbers under the most\r\nadverse circumstances, and developed a temperament indifferent to\r\nenvironment and elevated to high spiritual aspiration, making them an\r\nintensely religious people, whose life was little softened by artistic\r\npractice. The effect of the injunction against the making of “graven\r\nimages,” as given them in the code of Moses, was to cut them off from\r\nthe exercise of the esthetic faculty in sculpture or painting; their\r\nunsettled mode of life prevented outlet in architecture. So they poured\r\nout the whole strength of their passionate, powerful natures in poetry\r\nand song. The most striking characteristic of the Hebrew poetry is the\r\nparallelism of the phrases, each sentence or complete thought being\r\nmade up of two similar or contrasted thoughts, and the accompanying\r\nmusic must have had the same character. The following from the Psalms\r\nshows this feature:\r\n\r\n    “Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive\r\n             to the voice of my supplication.”\r\n    “I will not give sleep to my eyes,\r\n             or slumber to mine eyelids.”\r\n\r\nWhen the great choirs of men singers were organized for the Temple\r\nservices, this parallelism brought about the division into two bodies,\r\nwho sang alternately, a practice in use today in certain churches with\r\nritualistic services, and known as antiphonal singing.\r\n\r\n=Hebrew Music=.—It is unfortunate that we have no reason to believe\r\nthat the hymns in use in the Jewish synagogues today are sung to the\r\ntunes of thousands of years ago, even if modified. In the various\r\ncountries of Europe, Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, the airs are\r\nquite different, suggesting that tradition has failed to deliver\r\nanything that can traced to the days of the poet-king of Israel. Some\r\nauthorities find in the Gregorian chants traces of Hebrew melodies\r\nwhich came down from the early Christians of Jewish birth and\r\ntraining. Clement of Alexandria says that their songs were earnest and\r\ndignified; there must have been some special character in them as\r\nshown by the command of the Babylonians, “Sing us the songs of Zion.”\r\nThe principal relation that the Hebrews have to the history of music\r\narises from the enduring impress the works of the Psalmist and other\r\nportions of the Scriptures have made upon the music of the Christian\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n=Hebrew Instruments=.—The Hebrews borrowed their instruments from other\r\nnations, principally from the Egyptians, the one most favored being a\r\nform of the =harp=, small enough to be portable, used to give effect to\r\nthe chanting of the prophets. “To prophesy meant to sing,” and it is\r\nquite likely that Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other inspired poets uttered\r\ntheir thoughts in verse and song, both being extemporized.\r\n\r\nThe student should bear in mind that the various musical instruments\r\nmentioned in the Bible must be understood as types. The harp of David\r\nwas not the same as our harp, the organ was not like our great church\r\ninstruments, viols, sackbuts, cornets, pipes, psalteries, etc., are\r\nnames given by the translators to the Hebrew terms used in the Bible.\r\nThey used words with which they were familiar, and which they thought\r\ncorresponded in type to the instruments used by the Hebrews.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nRowbotham.—History of Music.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nEngel.—Musical Instruments.\r\n\r\nSmith.—The World’s Earliest Music.\r\n\r\nAnderson.—The Story of Extinct Civilizations.\r\n\r\nMaspéro.—Ancient Egypt and Assyria.\r\n\r\nDickinson.—Music in the History of the Western Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat great river valley was the home of the Chaldeans?\r\n\r\nWhat do we know of music among the Akkads?\r\n\r\nWhat evidence have we to show that the Assyrians held music in high\r\nesteem?\r\n\r\nWhat instruments did they use?\r\n\r\nHow do we learn of the ideas of the Egyptians in regard to music?\r\n\r\nWho controlled the knowledge of music and other sciences and arts?

An ancient city, Athens, as history\r\nteaches us. The record is that it was founded by Cecrops, who brought\r\na colony from Egypt, in 1556 B. C., a period when Egypt was a centre\r\nof power, wealth, education and science. Therefore we infer that these\r\ncolonists brought with them to Greece the ordinary, popular music and\r\ninstruments to which they had become accustomed in their home. But\r\nthere was an older Greece; for late discoveries show that there were\r\nfive cities, each built upon the ruins of an older city, the first\r\none going back to 2500 B. C. These earlier inhabitants, themselves an\r\noffshoot of the great Aryan race, were absorbed by the colonists.\r\n\r\n=Music and Myth in Greece=.—The beginnings of music in Greece are\r\nmingled with myths: Pan, Apollo, Mercury, Athene and others appear as\r\nthe patrons and exemplars of the musical art. Aside from the names of\r\nthe mythical gods and goddesses, there are names of human beings that\r\nstand out with clearness. These early musicians were singers or bards\r\nwho chanted the songs composed in honor of chiefs and tribal heroes.\r\nSuch were Hyagnis, 1506 B. C., Marsyas, his son, and Olympus the elder,\r\nOrpheus, Musæus (1426 B. C.), chief of the Eleusinian mysteries, Linus,\r\nAmphion, Thaletes, whose songs were favorites of Pythagoras; the\r\ngreatest of these bards was the blind Homer, to whom the date 900 B.\r\nC. is assigned. “By the Greeks, music as an art was considered an aid\r\nin regulating by rule the inflections of the voice, to mark the places\r\nof emphasis, and to define the pauses in the recitation of their epic\r\npoetry; and the rhythm of their songs followed strictly laws that had\r\nbeen laid down; innovation was reprehended, and even prohibited.”[4]\r\n\r\n=Early Greek Musicians and Writers=.—The earliest musician’s name\r\nmet with in the annals of music is that of =Terpander= (676 B. C),\r\nwho is said to have increased the number of strings on the lyre from\r\nfour to seven. Next in order was =Pythagoras= (585-505 B. C.), who\r\nadded an eighth string to the lyre. He was called the discoverer of\r\nthe Tetrachord, which is still known by this name, the inventor or\r\ndiscoverer of the Octave Scale, also the discoverer of the ratios of\r\nthe consonances; but there is no doubt that he learned all these things\r\nduring his sojourn in Egypt. He is also credited with the invention of\r\nthe Canon or Monochord with movable bridges, a contrivance still in use\r\nfor investigating the ratios of intervals. Unfortunately none of the\r\nwritings—if any ever existed—of Pythagoras have come down to us. Our\r\nknowledge of his theories is second-hand, gathered from the writings\r\nof his disciples. Pythagoras seems to have studied sound more in the\r\nmanner of the acoustician than of the musician; hence his followers,\r\nor rather those who called themselves by his name, were more concerned\r\nwith the ratios of sounds than with their musical effects.\r\n\r\nAmong the great philosophers who treated on music, =Aristotle= (384 B.\r\nC.) holds an important place. We find his theories expressed in one\r\nof his works called “Problems.” A pupil of his—=Aristoxenus= (350-320\r\nB. C.), has left the most valuable treatise on music, of any of the\r\nancients, the oldest musical work known at the present time; it is,\r\nunfortunately, not complete. Aristoxenus was a practical, in addition\r\nto being a theoretical musician; he thought that the ear was the final\r\ncourt of appeal in matters musical. Hence the musical world was divided\r\ninto two factions: the Pythagoreans, who held that music was purely\r\na matter for arithmetical investigation, and the Aristoxenians, who\r\nclaimed that the chief end of music was to be listened to. This dispute\r\nlasted for many centuries. =Boethius=, the Roman philosopher, in his\r\nwritings takes sides with the Pythagoreans and pours contempt on the\r\nmere musician. The successors of the Pythagoreans are even yet not\r\nextinct, as every now and again some wiseacre turns up with a scheme\r\nto secure just intonation, at the price of losing all that music has\r\ngained under our present system. =Plato= (430 B. C.), the greatest\r\nof philosophers, has much to say about music; but these sayings are\r\nlargely incomprehensible to modern understandings. =Euclid= (323 B.\r\nC.), the great mathematician, treated largely of music.[5] =Aristides\r\nQuintilianus= was another author of great weight. =Plutarch=, in\r\nhis _Symposia_, has one devoted to music, but unfortunately the\r\nmeaning of these authors is often so obscure that it cannot now be\r\ndiscovered. Alexandria, in Egypt, came into prominence in music when\r\nthe great library was founded there by Alexander the Great, in 332\r\nB. C. =Eratosthenes= (276-196 B. C.), the librarian, figures in the\r\nmathematics of music. When we reach the Christian Era, we meet with two\r\nmore writers, =Didymus= (A. D. 60), who introduced the “minor”[6] tone\r\ninto the scale, and =Claudius Ptolemy= (A. D. 130).\r\n\r\n=The Music of Ancient Greece the Foundation of Modern European\r\nMusic=.—Although the history of European music properly begins with the\r\nmusic of Ancient Greece, we are still very ignorant of the subject,\r\nowing to the fact that there is not in existence a note of music\r\nanterior to the Christian Era. But lately, in the ancient treasure\r\nhouse at Delphi, a hymn was found inscribed in marble on the inner\r\nwall. Mr. J. P. Mahaffy, an authority in matters pertaining to Greek\r\nliterature, says: “The time is given by the metre, a long syllable\r\nand three short, variously placed, or two long and a short between\r\nthem, in every case 5-8 in a measure.... As regards the accompaniment\r\nor harmonizing of the air, there is none extant. [As to the melody]\r\nalthough there is rhythm and even a recurrence of phrases to mark the\r\nclose of the period, nothing worthy of being called melody in any\r\nmodern sense is to be found.” The inscription dates from the third\r\ncentury before Christ, is a hymn to Apollo and the Muses, and consists\r\nof phrases equal to eighty measures in our modern reckoning. The blank\r\nspaces in the measure were filled in by an instrument, probably the\r\ncithara. Our knowledge is confined to the treatises of mathematicians\r\nand musicians, previously mentioned, and these works are often so\r\nobscure that there is much uncertainty as to their meaning. Besides,\r\nthese writings are scattered over a period of about 800 years; that\r\nis, from 585 B. C., the date of Pythagoras, to 130 A. D., the date\r\nof Claudius Ptolemy. Numberless changes took place in the art in\r\nthe course of this long period; hence the attempt to elucidate a\r\nhomogeneous system by comparing these writings is about as hopeless\r\nas would be the attempt to deduce the modern system of music from the\r\ncollocation of the works of Guido and Hucbald of the 10th century with\r\nthose of Richter and Prout in the 19th.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Music HYMN TO APOLLO AND THE MUSES.]\r\n\r\nWe owe much to the labors of these bygone writers; in fact, the\r\nGreek system of music is the foundation upon which the modern system\r\nis the superstructure. No attempt will be made here to settle the\r\nmany disputed points that have puzzled the learned for ten or more\r\ncenturies, but a clear and concise account of all that is necessary\r\nto an understanding of the place of this system in the historical\r\ndevelopment of music will be given.\r\n\r\n=Formation of the Greek Scale=.—The Greek Scale was founded on a\r\ntetrachord or succession of four sounds, arranged as follows:\r\n\r\n             E (half tone) F (whole tone) G (whole tone) A\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that these letters written on the bass staff,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nrepresent the exact pitch, as near as may be, of this tetrachord. In\r\nearly times the lyre was tuned to these four sounds, and was called\r\nthe _Tetrachordon_; that is, four strings. This gracefully shaped\r\ninstrument has remained to this day the symbol of music. This limited\r\nscale was extended by adding another tetrachord, which began with the\r\nlast note of the first tetrachord, thus:\r\n\r\n         A—B♭ C D\r\n  E—F G A\r\n\r\nmaking a scale of seven sounds, called the scale of _Conjunct_ or\r\n_Joined Tetrachords_; also from its seven strings, the Heptachord\r\nscale. The next step was to take in the limit of the octave. The first\r\nway adopted was to raise the highest string a whole tone, thus making\r\nit the octave of the lowest; the sixth string was also raised a whole\r\ntone to make it a whole tone below the seventh. The result was a scale\r\nof seven sounds with one degree omitted, thus:\r\n\r\n         A—B♭ (C) D E\r\n  E—F G A\r\n\r\nThe next form was:\r\n\r\n  E—F G A B (C) D E\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in this scale the second tetrachord begins a\r\nwhole tone above the first, instead of beginning with the final of the\r\nfirst. It is therefore called the scale of _Disjunct_ or _Separated\r\nTetrachords_. The missing sound (C) is here added and the octave scale\r\nis complete. When the lyre had seven strings, the middle string, that\r\nis, the fourth, counting from either end, was called _Mese_, which\r\nmeans “middle”; but this word soon gained a secondary meaning which, in\r\ntime, became the most important, viz.: _Keynote_.\r\n\r\n=The Lesser Perfect System=.—There was in use at the same time a scale\r\ncalled the _Lesser Perfect System_, which was made from the conjunct\r\nseven-note scale by adding another conjunct tetrachord below, thus:\r\n\r\n                    A—B♭ C D\r\n             E—F G A\r\n  (A) B—C D E\r\n\r\nThen A was added below the first tetrachord to make an octave with the\r\nnote _Mese_. This A was the lowest sound admitted in the Greek System.\r\nIt was the Romans who gave to this series of sounds the first seven\r\nletters of the alphabet, which they still retain. This octave (A to A)\r\nis also the origin of our natural minor scale. This Lesser System was\r\nthe scale used in the Temple rites. It continued to be used for this\r\npurpose long after the system about to be described was invented.\r\n\r\n=The Greater Perfect System=.—This was made from the disjunct octave by\r\nadding a conjunct tetrachord below and one above, thus:\r\n\r\n                             E—F G A\r\n             E—F G A B—C D E\r\n  (A) B—C D E\r\n\r\nThe A below was also added, thus making a scale two octaves in extent.\r\nIn later times the disjunct tetrachord, B—C—D—E, was added at the top.\r\nThis E was the highest note admitted in the Greek System; consequently,\r\ntheir music never exceeded the limits of two octaves and a fifth, and\r\nthe sounds included in these systems were as follows:\r\n\r\n[Music: Greater Perfect System without B♭\r\n\r\nAdded Note Lesser Perfect System without B♮]\r\n\r\nPeculiar interest attaches to this series of sounds, because in the\r\nMiddle Ages they were supposed to be the _only_ sounds admitted by the\r\nGreeks. This accounts for the fact that B was the first note that it\r\nwas considered right to use in two forms.\r\n\r\n=The Greek Scales=.—The Greeks did not by any means confine themselves\r\nto these sounds, but changed the pitch of the starting note just as\r\nwe do with our scales; in other words, both of these systems might\r\nbe transposed. Therefore they not only had all the sounds at command\r\nthat we have, but as their scales were (theoretically, at least)\r\ntuned acoustically true, they had a great many more. But their scales\r\nwere all diatonic (the scales they called Chromatic and Enharmonic\r\nwill be explained later), they were all like our natural minor. When\r\nthey said “Dorian Scale” they meant just what we mean when we say\r\nscale of D minor; Phrygian Scale meant E minor; Lydian Scale, F-sharp\r\nminor; Mixo-Lydian, G minor. In addition to these four scales there\r\nwere three that began a fourth below, one a fourth below the Dorian,\r\ncalled the Hypo-Dorian, A minor; a fourth below the Phrygian, called\r\nthe Hypo-Phrygian, B minor; and a fourth below the Lydian, called\r\nHypo-Lydian, C-sharp minor; these were the standard scales of Greek\r\nmusic. These names, Dorian, etc., were retained in the Ecclesiastical\r\nSystem, but the mistake was made of supposing that the Greeks used\r\nonly the fixed sounds given by the untransposed Greater System. Hence\r\nthe Church Dorian has B natural, not B-flat; the Church Phrygian,\r\nF natural, not F sharp; and the Church Lydian begins on F natural,\r\ninstead of on F sharp. Hence, no two church scales are alike in the\r\npositions of the halftones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nName some of the myths connected with music among the Greeks.

The Greeks spoke of the Dorian Octave,\r\nthe Phrygian Octave, and so on; and the word Octave, used in this way,\r\nhas been thought to be synonymous with Scale, which is doubtful, for\r\nthe following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe standard instrument of the Greeks was the octave lyre. The lowest\r\nand highest strings were tuned respectively A, fifth line bass staff,\r\nand A, second space, treble.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\nDorian Octave. Signature B♭ Phrygian Octave. Signature F♯\r\n\r\nLydian Octave. Signature F, C and G sharps. Mizo-Lydian Octave.\r\nSignature B and E flats.\r\n\r\nHypo-Dorian Octave. Hypo-Phrygian Octave. Signature F and C sharps.\r\n\r\nHypo-Lydian Octave. Signature F, C, G & D sharps.]\r\n\r\nThese were fixed sounds, but the tuning of the remaining six strings\r\n_might be changed_ at will; therefore, a series of sounds belonging\r\nto any one of these scales could be made; and it will be seen, on\r\nexamining the following table, that all the seven scales may be\r\nrepresented _without changing the extreme notes_, A to A. Suppose we\r\nmake the B flat. Now B-flat is the characteristic note of the Dorian\r\nScale, in our term, its signature. Therefore this octave would be\r\ncalled the Dorian Octave, _not_ Dorian Scale. We speak of a scale as\r\nbeginning and ending on its _keynote_; if it does not, we call it a\r\nscale passage in such and such a key.\r\n\r\nThe notes marked + are the keynotes (_Mese_). It will be seen at\r\nonce that the positions of the halftones differ in _each_ of these\r\noctaves. One cannot help feeling a slight suspicion that some confusion\r\nbetween scale and octave had a great deal to do with the growth of the\r\nEcclesiastical Scales.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest of the ancient writers on music, =Claudius Ptolemy=\r\n(about 130 A. D.), proposed that all these octaves should be transposed\r\na _fourth lower_; this made the Dorian Octave E to E (all naturals).\r\nOne result of this change is that many authorities at the present\r\ntime call this the Dorian Scale, whereas it is evident that it is\r\nsimply the Dorian Octave, as given above, transposed a _fourth lower_.\r\nOther scales were added from time to time, called _Hyper_-Dorian,\r\n_Hyper_-Phrygian, etc., a _fourth above_ the standard scales; but it is\r\nvery uncertain whether they were in practical use; they were probably\r\npurely matters of theory.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics Attributed to the Different Greek Scales=.—The\r\nGreeks attributed many fanciful characteristics to the various modes\r\nor scales, much as some modern musicians, Berlioz, for example, do\r\nto the different keys. But all seem to have agreed as to the Dorian.\r\nThis was considered the true Greek mode, and was called severe,\r\nfirm and manly, suitable for martial songs. The Lydian mode was\r\nesteemed to be effeminate, suited to love songs, possibly because\r\nthe Lydian Octave corresponds with the scale of A major, and a major\r\nscale was not relished by the Greeks, any more than it was by the\r\nearly ecclesiastical musicians. A more probable explanation of this\r\nattribution of different characters to the different scales is, that it\r\nwas customary to use certain modes for songs on certain subjects, and\r\nthe character of the poetry was transferred to the music.\r\n\r\n=The Greek Chromatic Scale= differed altogether from what _we_ call a\r\nchromatic scale. It was made by _lowering_ the pitch of the _fourth_\r\nand _seventh_ strings above the _keynote_ a halftone. Supposing the\r\noctave lyre to be tuned to the Hypo-Dorian Mode or Scale, it would\r\nbegin and end on the Keynote (_Mese_), thus:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nNow, by lowering D and G we get the following scale:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThis is the scale that was called Chromatic. It is said to have been at\r\none time the most popular of all the scales, a statement we can easily\r\ncredit, since it contains in itself the two world-wide five-note or\r\n_Pentatonic_ Scales, commonly known as the Scotch or Irish Scales, the\r\nmost widely distributed of all scales in Europe, Asia and America.\r\n\r\n[Music: Major pentatonic scale Minor pentatonic scale]\r\n\r\n=The Greek Enharmonic Scale=.—The scale called Enharmonic was made\r\nthus: The fourth and seventh strings were lowered a whole tone; that\r\nis, to the pitch of the second and sixth, the second and sixth were\r\nlowered a _quartertone_, thus:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nC-flat is supposed to be halfway between B and C; F-flat halfway\r\nbetween E and F. Our modern system does not provide for the notation of\r\nquartertones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYRE. CITHARA. LYDIAN MAGADIS.]\r\n\r\n=Greek Instruments=.—The standard instrument of the Greeks was the\r\n=Lyre=. It bore many names, as Lyre, Tetrachordon, Chelys, Phorminx,\r\nCithara, etc. There may have been slight _differences_ in the _size\r\nand the number of the strings_, but great uncertainty prevails on this\r\npoint. Under the name of =Flute= (_Aulos_) they seem to have included\r\nboth _Flutes_ proper and instruments of the _hautboy_ or _clarinet_\r\nfamily. These instruments bore a bewildering number of names, the exact\r\nmeaning of which is lost. Judging from the pictorial representations\r\nthat remain, the Greek instruments were inferior both in variety and\r\nextent to those of the Egyptians. They seem to have made little use\r\nof the Harp, of which instrument the Egyptians had a great variety.\r\nThe Greeks seem to have used instruments chiefly, if not solely, to\r\naccompany the voice; and they appear never to have combined large\r\nnumbers of instruments for any purpose. Even in their tragedies, which\r\nwere performed in immense theatres open to the sky, the Chorus was\r\nlimited to fifteen men, accompanied by two flutes. When accompanying\r\nthe voice with the lyre they may have occasionally struck the fourth,\r\nfifth or octave of the vocal melody; but, in general, they played the\r\nvoice part. Their most highly developed instrument was a variety of\r\nlyre, the strings of which passed over a bridge placed one-third of the\r\nstrings’ length from the lower end of the lyre, thus causing the lower\r\npart of the string to sound the octave of the upper part. The shorter\r\npart of the string was played with a plectrum in the right hand, the\r\nlonger part by the fingers of the left hand. This instrument was called\r\n=Magadis=—from _Magas_, a bridge. The term _Magadize_ was eventually\r\nused to signify playing or singing in octaves, and was _synonymous_\r\nwith _Antiphony_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE FLUTE. JOINED FLUTE. PHORBEIA.]\r\n\r\n=Greek Musical Notation=.—Our knowledge of Greek musical notation is\r\nvery defective, being derived from only four or five specimens of\r\nancient music, and a few small fragments. They appear to have used a\r\n_separate notation for each mode_, and these four hymns are apparently\r\nall in the same mode, but authorities differ as to the mode. They\r\nused the letters of their alphabet, both capital and small, written\r\nin various positions, sometimes upright, sometimes lying on one side.\r\nThe notation for the lyre differed from that used for the voice. The\r\nletters representing the _vocal_ part were written _above the words_,\r\nthose representing the _instrumental_ part, _below_ the _words_. These\r\n_letters represented_ the _pitch_ of the sounds, but _not_ their\r\n_duration_. The duration was regulated by the _meter_ of the poetry.\r\nInstead of a portion of one of these hymns, the first three lines of\r\nour National Hymn are given as a sample of this notation:\r\n\r\n   R  R   Φ   Γ   R   Φ    σ     σ     Ρ σ  Φ  R  Φ  R    Γ R\r\n  My country ’tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing.\r\n\r\nThese letters have been interpreted as indicating the following sounds,\r\nthe transposed Hypo-Lydian Scale in its old form; that is, the Lesser\r\nPerfect System with G sharp as its keynote.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=Greek View of Harmony=.—The question has been much debated as to\r\nwhether or not the Greeks practiced harmony. It seems hardly possible\r\nwith such a defective notation; but the best argument against it\r\nis, that there is not a word in any of the extant treatises as\r\nto combinations and successions of these combinations, and it is\r\nimpossible that any art of harmony should have existed unless some\r\nrules for its employment should have been evolved.\r\n\r\n=Greek Terms in Music=.—The modern terminology of music is largely\r\nindebted to the Greek system, although many of the words have entirely\r\nchanged their significance. The word Music itself, to the Greek, meant\r\nthe whole circle of the sciences, especially Astronomy and Mathematics.\r\nMelody meant the rising and falling of the voice in either speaking or\r\nsinging. Harmonia meant rather what we call Melody than our Harmony.\r\nThis latter, namely, the sounding together of different sounds, was\r\ncalled Symphony. Antiphony originally meant singing in octaves, that\r\nis, men with women or boys. Chromatic and Enharmonic have already been\r\nexplained. Diapason, now applied chiefly to organ stops, originally\r\nmeant the octave; that is, “through all.” Diatonic has nearly retained\r\nits original meaning. Tone, Semitone and Tetrachord have retained their\r\nmeaning, with the exception that in the modern tetrachord the halftone\r\nis at the other end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nMonro.—The Modes of Ancient Greek Music.\r\n\r\nRowbotham.—History of Music.\r\n\r\nOxford History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Greek use of the term Octave; “Dorian Octave,” for example?\r\n\r\nWhat change did Claudius Ptolemy suggest?

Any series of five notes on the black keys of the piano will\r\nmake a pentatonic scale, major character. The language of music was\r\ndetermined by scholars, hence the use of so many terms with Greek and\r\nLatin roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON V.\r\n\r\n                         ECCLESIASTICAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rome the New Centre=.—The Power that rules in the affairs of men\r\nseems to have made provision for the elevation of the whole race by\r\ndiffusing at intervals of centuries, the treasures of art, science and\r\nthought accumulated by a nation of unusual power and energy. Egypt\r\ndominated the northern part of Africa, the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nand the western slopes of Asia Minor, and in course of time yielded\r\nto the advance of the Greeks, but leaving behind, as a legacy, much\r\nthat has had enduring value. What had once been centred in one nation,\r\nunder the control of one caste, the priests, was spread through much\r\nof the known world. Greece, in turn, shaped the destinies of expanding\r\ncivilization. In the Greek social life free art played a great part;\r\nwherever the Greeks went as merchants and colonists, they carried with\r\nthem the principles of Greek art, including music. Greek musicians were\r\naccounted stars of the first magnitude in Egypt, in the Greek colonies\r\nof Italy, and later in Rome, which, after the fall of Greece as a\r\npolitical factor, became the political, social and artistic centre of\r\nthe world; through her conquests and subsequent colonizing diffusing\r\nthroughout a larger world than Egypt and Greece knew, an increased\r\nwealth of thought and action which greatly influenced later generations.\r\n\r\n=Rome Dependent Upon Greece=.—The Romans did not show a native instinct\r\nfor art. Their national qualities were essentially warlike, and were\r\ndeveloped by years of struggle for existence. A people whose organized\r\nlife was political and martial, and for so long found expression first\r\nin defence, later in conquest, would not develop a true art life. As\r\nthey grew stronger they built up their collections by pillage and by\r\npurchase; they were taught music, oratory, architecture, sculpture\r\nby Greeks who sought the capital of the world. Roman nobles imitated\r\nGreek customs, learned the Greek language and literature, cultivated\r\nmusic according to Greek methods, used Greek instruments, such as the\r\ncithara, lyre and flute, sang Greek songs and formed companies of\r\nsingers and players to furnish entertainment at their feasts and at the\r\npublic spectacles. The Roman drama was modified by Greek principles,\r\nand Greek actors replaced Roman artists; the pantomime was borrowed\r\nfrom Egypt. Music was a favorite distraction in the high ranks of\r\nRoman society, and men known to history were skilful players or\r\nsingers—Sylla, Flaccus, Calpurnius Piso, Titus, Caligula, Hadrian, and,\r\nbest known of all, Nero.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN HORN. SYRINX.]\r\n\r\n=Growth of Christianity=.—While the Roman Empire, in its turn, had\r\nserved the purpose of the Ruling Power in the affairs of men, in secret\r\na new force was gaining strength, one that was soon to drive pagan\r\narts and pleasures from open cultivation. In the Catacombs, in remote\r\nsections of the great city, pursued, hunted like beasts, martyrized,\r\nthe Christians clung to their faith with its simple rites of worship,\r\nin which the singing of songs was a marked feature. Whence these songs\r\ncame is by no means certain, the prevailing opinion being that they\r\nwere of Greek origin, modified by Hebrew influence.[7] In the course\r\nof years songs were introduced in the Christian service with no other\r\nwarrant than that of tradition. During the years of persecution no\r\nsystematic cultivation of music was possible. Later, when Constantine\r\naccepted the Cross, 325 A. D., and Christianity had triumphed over\r\nPaganism, the abuses became such that the ecclesiastical authorities\r\nset themselves to the task of reform and of establishing a system of\r\nsong for the use of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Music: Tonus Peregrinus as a chant]\r\n\r\n=Origin of the Church Scales=.—It is absolutely unknown when or by whom\r\nthe system of scales, known as the Church Scales, was invented. The\r\nlatest writer on the Greek System was =Claudius Ptolemy= (about 130 A.\r\nD.). In 330, =Pope Sylvester= established a school for training church\r\nsingers, but we have no information as to the system he employed. The\r\nname of =Ambrose=, Bishop of Milan (333-397), has for centuries been\r\nassociated with what are called the _Authentic_ Scales, but there is no\r\nvalid evidence whatever that he had anything to do with their adoption.\r\nThe name of =Pope Gregory= (540-604) has also been associated with\r\nanother set of scales called _Plagal_, with as little authority as in\r\nthe previous case. There does not appear to have existed any system\r\nof notation in the time of Ambrose or Gregory. The Greek notation by\r\nletters was forgotten, and the very insufficient system of notation by\r\nNeumes had not been invented. The only writer of any authority after\r\nPtolemy was Boethius, and he did more to confuse the subject of music\r\nthan to explain it.\r\n\r\n=Foundation of the Church Scales=.—But if we know nothing of the\r\ninventor of the Church Scales, or of the way in which they grew into\r\ntheir final form, we are, nevertheless, perfectly well informed of\r\nthe fully-developed system which, it must be remarked, grew out of a\r\nmisunderstanding of the Greek Scales. The Church Scales were founded\r\non the Greater Perfect System of the Greeks, with this restriction,\r\nnamely, that it was _not transposable_; whereas, we have seen that the\r\nvarious Greek modes were transpositions of either the Lesser or Greater\r\nSystems.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThis is the series of sounds from which the Church Scales were made.\r\nNone of them might be _altered_ by sharp or flat, _except_ the _B_ in\r\nthe second octave (and this was a later addition which was probably\r\nowing to a remembrance of the Lesser Perfect System in which the B was\r\nflat.) The Greek names were retained for the Church Scales, but as not\r\none of the notes was inflected, it follows that the _halftones_ occur\r\nin _different_ places in every scale. The scales to which these names\r\nwere given were called Authentic, those with the prefix _Hypo_ were\r\ncalled Plagal. In the table on the next page, the Greek and Church\r\nScales, also the Greek _octaves_ are given side by side.\r\n\r\n=Confusion Between the Systems=.—We may gather from this table how\r\nthe confusion between Dorian and Phrygian has arisen. The Phrygian\r\nOctave is identical with the Church Dorian, and the Dorian Octave with\r\nthe Church Phrygian. A proof that the Church Scales originated in\r\nthe way indicated may be found in the fact that the Church and Greek\r\nHypo-Dorian Scales are identical, this being the only Greek Scale\r\nwithout a sharp or flat. The Church Hypo-Lydian was also called the\r\nIonian Scale; its arrangement of tones and semitones is the _same_ as\r\nthat of the _modern major scale_. It was not considered appropriate for\r\nchurch music, being looked upon as soft, effeminate and lascivious, by\r\nboth Greeks and mediæval churchmen.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n  GREEK OCTAVES          CHURCH SCALES    GREEK SCALES\r\n\r\n  At the pitch as transposed by Ptolemy\r\n\r\n  Phrygian Octave        Dorian           Dorian\r\n\r\n  Dorian Octave          Phrygian         Phrygian\r\n\r\n  Hypo-Lydian Octave     Lydian           Lydian\r\n\r\n  Hypo-Phrygian Octave   Mixo-Lydian      Mixo-Lydian\r\n\r\n  Hypo-Dorian Octave     Hypo-Dorian      Hypo-Dorian\r\n\r\n  Mixo-Lydian Octave     Hypo-Phrygian    Hypo-Phrygian\r\n\r\n  Lydian Octave          Hypo-Lydian      Hypo-Lydian\r\n\r\n  Phrygian Octave        Hypo-Mixo-Lydian]\r\n\r\n=Eight Modes in Use=.—The Church Scales were numbered from one to\r\neight; the Authentic Scales were given the odd, and the Plagal Scales\r\nthe even numbers, thus:\r\n\r\n  1. Dorian             2. Hypo-Dorian\r\n                  related scales.\r\n  3. Phrygian           4. Hypo-Phrygian\r\n                  related scales.\r\n  5. Lydian             6. Hypo-Lydian\r\n                  related scales.\r\n  7. Mixo-Lydian        8. Hypo-Mixo-Lydian\r\n                  related scales.\r\n\r\nA melody in an Authentic Scale had to end on its Keynote, but a melody\r\nin a Plagal Scale ended on the Keynote of its _related_ Authentic\r\nScale. Observe that the Dorian and Hypo-Mixo-Lydian Scales are\r\nidentical; but while the former had to end on the Keynote, D, the\r\nlatter ended on G, which is the fourth of its scale, and Keynote of its\r\n_related_ Authentic Scale.\r\n\r\nTraces of these Authentic and Plagal Scales may be found in many old\r\nfolk-songs. Thus, the melody of the “Last Rose of Summer” begins on the\r\nKeynote, rises in the course of the melody to the octave, but ends by\r\nfalling to the Keynote; it is therefore Authentic. On the other hand,\r\nthe melody of “Robin Adair” begins on the fourth _below_ the Keynote,\r\nrises to its octave, but ends on the fourth _above_ its initial note\r\nand is Plagal; thus:\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n                 Range                      Range\r\n\r\n         Initial        Final       Initial        Final\r\n\r\n           LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.        ROBIN ADAIR.]\r\n\r\nThe term _Hyper_ (above) was sometimes applied to the Authentic Scales.\r\nIn the Greek System the _Hyper_ Scales were the same distance _above_\r\nthe standard scales that the _Hypo_ Scales were _below_. Although\r\ntwelve modes were theoretically admitted in church music, it was for\r\nthe most part confined to the eight modes given above.\r\n\r\n=The Dominant=.—In addition to the keynote there was another note\r\nin every scale of almost equal importance, called the _Dominant_.\r\nThis name has been retained in the modern system, but with a total\r\n_change_ of meaning. In the Church Scales it meant the _Reciting\r\nNote_, that is, the note on which the principal part of the words was\r\nchanted. In all the _Authentic_ Scales but the Phrygian, the _fifth_\r\nof the scale is the _Dominant_; in the _Phrygian_ the _sixth_ is the\r\n_Dominant_, because the B was a changeable note, that is, might be\r\nnatural or flat. The _Dominants_ of the _Plagal_ Scales are a _third\r\nbelow_ the Dominants of the related Authentic Scales, except in the\r\nHypo-Mixo-Lydian, in which the Dominant is a second below that of its\r\nrelated Authentic Scale. Therefore the _Dominant_ is the _sixth_ of all\r\nthe _Hypo_ Scales, but the _Hypo-Phrygian_ and _Hypo-Mixo-Lydian_, in\r\nwhich it is the _seventh_.\r\n\r\n=Hucbald’s Scale=.—Two attempts were made in the 10th century to\r\nconstruct new scales, first by =Hucbald=, who founded his series of\r\nsounds on a tetrachord, in which the halftone was between the second\r\nand third, thus: A B C D. His object seems to have been to obtain a\r\nseries in which a succession of perfect fourths and fifths might be\r\nsecured, for which purpose he made use of the following series of\r\nsounds:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIn the first tetrachord B was flat, in the third natural; in the\r\nfourth, F was sharp. As to the use made of this scale, little or\r\nnothing is known.\r\n\r\n=Guido’s Scale=.—The other attempt, usually attributed to _Guido_, a\r\ncontemporary of Hucbald, resulted in the _Hexachord_ Scale (six-note\r\nscale). This scale was formed by adding a whole tone above and below\r\nthe Hucbald tetrachord, thus: G, A, B, C, D, E. To complete the series\r\nof Hexachord Scales, another sound was added, namely: the G below\r\nthe A on which the Greek scales and their derivatives, the Church\r\nscales, began. The first seven letters of the Roman alphabet were\r\nused to name the sounds already in use, hence to indicate this sound\r\nthe Greek letter, Gamma, was adopted. At the same time the syllables\r\n_ut_—_re_—_mi_—_fa_—_sol_—_la_ were used to name the sounds of every\r\nhexachord (precisely as the movable Do is used now); hence this lowest\r\nsound was called _Gamma-ut_, corrupted into Gamut. The sounds in the\r\nseries were indicated by placing after the letter the syllables that\r\nindicated its position in all the hexachords in which it was found,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n  G A B—C D E\r\n         C D E—F G A\r\n\r\n1. _Gamma—ut_. 2. _A—re_. 3. _B—mi_. 4. _C—Fa—ut_, because C is _fa_\r\nin the first, and _ut_ in the second hexachord. Consequently, to a\r\nmediæval musician, _C—fa—ut_ meant what we would call C, second space\r\nbass clef.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives all the Hexachord Scales with the names of\r\nthe sounds. It is of interest because this system of nomenclature\r\npersisted long after the one which gave rise to it was obsolete.\r\n\r\n         {  E                                        la\r\n         {  D                                  la    sol\r\n  Super  {  C                                  sol   fa\r\n  Acute  {  B♮                                       mi\r\n         {  B♭                                fa\r\n         {  A                            la    mi    re\r\n\r\n         {  G                            sol   re    ut\r\n         {  F                            fa    ut\r\n         {  E                      la    mi\r\n  Acute  {  D                la    sol   re\r\n  Octave {  C                sol   fa    ut\r\n         {  B♮                     mi\r\n         {  B♭              fa\r\n         {  A          la    mi    re\r\n\r\n         {  G          sol   re    ut\r\n         {  F          fa    ut\r\n         {  E    la    mi\r\n  Grave  {  D    sol   re\r\n  Octave {  C    fa    ut\r\n         {  B    mi\r\n         {  A    re\r\n         {  Γ    ut\r\n\r\nThe Hexachords in which the B was flat were called Soft (_Mollis_);\r\nthose in which B was natural, Hard (_Dura_); the term _mollis_ has been\r\nretained in the French word _Bemol_, a flat, and in the German name for\r\na minor key, _Moll_. The word _dura_ (hard) is also retained in the\r\nGerman as a name for the major key _Dur_. When the letters were used\r\nas a means of notation, the sound B-flat was indicated by the old form\r\nof the letter b, which has been retained as the sign for a flat. This\r\nwas called B _rotundum_ (round B); when B natural was wanted, a stroke\r\nwas put on the right side of the ♭, called B _quadratum_ (squared B),\r\nthe sign to this day for a natural.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCE.\r\n\r\nOxford History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat city became the centre of life after Athens and Greece fell?\r\n\r\nWhat new influence was shaping in the Roman Empire?\r\n\r\nWhen did music receive official attention and reform?\r\n\r\nWhat names are associated with the early history of Church Music?\r\n\r\nOn which Greek system were the Church Scales founded?\r\n\r\nWhat difference exists between the Greek and the Church Scales as to\r\nthe positions of the halftones?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Authentic and Plagal?\r\n\r\nWhat were the rules in regard to a melody in the Authentic forms?

These two methods indicated the _pitch_ sufficiently,\r\nbut _not_ the _duration_ of the sounds.\r\n\r\n=Neumes=.—The next attempt was somewhat of a retrogression instead\r\nof an improvement. Signs called _Neumes_ were placed over the words.\r\nThese signs consisted of points, lines, accents, hooks, curves, angles\r\nand a number of other characters placed more or less exactly over the\r\nsyllables to which they were intended to be sung, in such manner as to\r\nshow, relatively, by the distance above the text, how much the voice\r\nwas to rise or fall. They did _not_ indicate _absolute pitch_ or\r\n_duration_. The number of characters in use, according to manuscripts\r\nstill preserved, varied from seven to forty. In later forms they appear\r\nin the notation used for the old Plain Song melodies (Gregorian) which\r\nwere recalled into general use by Pope Pius X, in 1904.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\n                                Neumes.\r\n\r\n                                Lettres.\r\n\r\n          fh  f  gd  fff  efgfd  d g g  hg  hi  h  kk  hg  ef\r\n\r\n                     Notation du treizième siècle.\r\n\r\n                           Notation moderne.\r\n\r\n                                Neumes.\r\n\r\n                                Lettres.\r\n\r\n     gfg  ef  hi  g  g  fd  f  de  de  c  d  gh  efg  f  d  c  dd.\r\n\r\n                     Notation du treizième siècle.\r\n\r\n                           Notation moderne.]\r\n\r\n=Parallel Lines=.—Another plan was to use a variable number of _lines_,\r\nwriting the syllables in the spaces, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis clumsy contrivance indicated _relative_ pitch well enough, but\r\n_not_ the _key_—or the duration. The next step was to use lines—which\r\nvaried in number—upon or between which the Neumes, which gradually\r\nchanged to square notes, were written. The pitch was indicated by using\r\na _red_ line for F, and a _yellow_ or _green_ line for C. A further\r\nimprovement was, to put the letters F or C and later G on one of the\r\nlines at the beginning; the modern clefs are simply modifications of\r\nthese letters.\r\n\r\n=Characters to Indicate Duration=.—The honor of suggesting characters\r\nto indicate _duration_ is usually attributed to =Franco of Cologne=, an\r\necclesiastic who lived in the latter part of the 12th century; but as\r\nin the case of Gregory and Guido, we must believe that his name simply\r\nstands as representative of a period. A system is rarely the work of\r\none man, rather a development from the labor of many. Franco’s treatise\r\non the subject marked an epoch. Up to the end of the 13th century\r\nthe notes in use were the Longa, Brevis, and Semibrevis, as well as\r\nthe Duplex Longa, or Maxima. The smaller values, the Minima, and the\r\nSemiminima first occur about 1300. About the middle of the 15th century\r\nwhite notes were introduced in place of certain of the black, the\r\nlatter color being reserved only for the smaller note values. The signs\r\nunderwent some change at this time. Maxima, Longa, Brevis, Semibrevis\r\n(our whole note), Minima (half note), Semiminima (quarter), Fusa\r\n(eighth), Semifusa (sixteenth).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longa Brevis Semibrevis Duplex Longa or Maxima Minima\r\nSemiminima]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Maxima Longa Brevis Semibrevis Minima Semiminima Fusa\r\nSemifusa]\r\n\r\n=The Beginnings of Harmony=.—Our information as to the beginning of\r\nHarmony is very vague and uncertain. As early as the Saxon times\r\nin England some rude kind of part singing, without written rules\r\napparently, seems to have existed. The first intimations we have of\r\nany scientific attempts are _Faburden_ or _Falsoborden_ and Diaphony\r\nor Organum. Faburden consisted of singing a melody while another voice\r\nsang a _drone_ accompaniment below it; thus:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nDiaphony or Organum consisted of a succession of _fourths_ or _fifths_\r\nand _octaves_, thus:\r\n\r\n  [Music:  Two Parts     Three Parts]\r\n\r\nIt has been denied by some authorities that such a barbarous manner\r\nof singing ever existed; but two considerations have been lost sight\r\nof, in making this denial: First, the fourth, fifth and octave were\r\nesteemed the _only consonances_. Secondly, the undisputed fact that as\r\nlate as the time of Chaucer, if not later, what was called “discanting\r\nquatible” or “quinable” existed; this discanting was done as follows:\r\nThe performer while singing a melody accompanied himself on the lute,\r\nplaying the _same melody a fourth or fifth above_. It can hardly be\r\ndoubted that a style of performance that was esteemed in the 15th, was\r\nperfectly satisfactory to the ears of the 10th century.\r\n\r\n=Discant=.—Another early attempt at harmonic effect was the singing of\r\nan _extemporaneous_ part or parts with the melody, called Discanting.\r\nIn course of time the Discant or Organum gradually crystallized\r\ninto rules, and other intervals were accepted. Strangely enough,\r\ndissonances seem to have been admitted with great freedom, and thirds\r\nand especially sixths, were avoided. The only dissonance that was _not_\r\nallowed was the _minor second_.\r\n\r\n=The New Organum=.—In the 11th century, a method of combining sounds,\r\ncalled the New Organum, was developed. This kind of Organum admitted\r\nthirds and sixths. The following example will sufficiently illustrate\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=Measured Music=.—The next step in advance, and one that proved very\r\nimportant and far-reaching in its results on the development of\r\nmusic, was the invention of a notation that indicated, although not\r\nvery conveniently, the _relative duration_ of sounds. Thus it became\r\npossible to express two or more parts in a permanent form. The plan of\r\nthis first attempt at a notation by means of which relative duration of\r\nnotes might be expressed was very complicated. Music written with these\r\nsigns was called Measured Music (_Cantus Mensurabilis_).\r\n\r\n=The Record of Early Harmony=.—There are references to the manner of\r\nusing voices in combination in the writings of several men associated\r\nwith the Christian Church in its early days. =Censorinus=, who lived\r\nin the 3d century, makes mention of a practice of using a melody in\r\noctaves accompanied by the fifth to the lower note of the octave, which\r\nis also the fourth to the upper. =Cassiodorus=, in the 6th century,\r\nmentions various ways of accompanying the chant with consecutive\r\nfourths and fifths. In a work called “Sentences About Music,” written\r\nby =Bishop Isidore of Seville=, who lived in the 7th century, we read\r\nthat “harmony is a modulation of the voice, the concordance of many\r\nsounds and their agreement.” In the 9th century we meet with the\r\nnames of several writers: =Remi d’Auxerre= who defines harmony as\r\n“a consonance of voices, and their union in one group”; =Jean Scot\r\nErigene= who recognized that the succession of chords composed of\r\noctaves, fifths and fourths is a rational one; =Odo= or =Otger=, a\r\nchurchman of the south of France, whose work was the first to mark\r\nan epoch in the development of the art of music. Also another monk,\r\nthe Fleming =Hucbald=, who lived in the 10th century. They defined\r\nconsonance and dissonance, and appear to have been the first to give\r\nrules for the construction of Diaphony. Hucbald says in his “_Musica\r\nEnchiriadis_”: “Certain dissimilar sounds sung together make an\r\nagreeable effect, and this mingling of voices is sweet to the ear.”\r\n\r\nTheir immediate successor, =Guido=, has been credited, unjustly, with\r\nbeing the inventor of nearly every improvement in the art up to his\r\ntime. The old organum closed with his. The earliest writer who treats\r\nof the new organum is =John Cotton=, in the 11th century. He was the\r\nfirst to promulgate the rule that contrary motion is always to be\r\npreferred to similar or oblique. He says: “At least two singers are\r\nrequired in diaphony formed from different sounds. While one voice\r\nsings a melody, the other surrounds it with different tones, and at the\r\nend of the phrases the two voices unite at the unison or octave.” The\r\nfullest development of the new organum was attained in the works of\r\n=Guy de Chalis=, about the close of the 12th century. He gives examples\r\nin which we find intervals of the eleventh and twelfth, a demonstration\r\nof the existence of a system differing from the Gregorian, which does\r\nnot exceed the octave. In the same epoch, =Denis Lewts=, of Liége, a\r\nCarthusian monk, gives rules to fix the use of accidental signs, a flat\r\nto lower B, a sharp to raise F. He speaks of these as if they had been\r\nin use for a long time, and indicated that the idea was to avoid the\r\noccurrence of the diminished fifth or the _augmented fourth_, known\r\nin harmony as the _tritone_. This process is called _Musica Ficta_,\r\nand formed a part of the instruction of singers. The examples cited\r\nby Lewts conform to this theory, and show that although in the songs,\r\nmotets and other compositions of the period the sharps and flats are\r\nnot found, it is because musicians knew the principles and made the\r\napplication for themselves. Instruction in those days was chiefly oral,\r\na method which placed a premium on a retentive memory. By the time that\r\nthe 13th century was reached, musical forms and melodies were widely\r\nspread, and as we look back to the 9th century it is possible to note\r\nthe gradual development. Harmony always existed, in a limited sense;\r\nbut it did not take on a scientific development until the Middle Ages.\r\nIt is to the musicians of this latter period, from the 13th to the\r\n15th centuries, that we must give the honor of having taken the germ\r\nof a science of harmony and of having brought it forward to mature\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCE.\r\n\r\nWilliams.—The Story of Notation.\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nExplain the earliest system of notation used for the Church scales.\r\nWhat was the next improvement?\r\n\r\nState the defects.\r\n\r\nWhat was the system of Notation by Neumes?

Before going farther on this\r\nline we will look into the record of music among the races of Northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n=Music of the Gauls=.—Roman writers give us some account of the\r\ncharacter of the music of the Gauls, which differed much from the\r\nGreco-Latin songs. Roman historians make mention of the songs of the\r\nGallic bards, who were poets and musicians as well, composing both\r\nreligious hymns and songs in honor of their heroes. According to\r\nDiodorus of Sicily, the Gauls practiced the musical art long before\r\nthe Christian Era, having regular schools for the instruction of the\r\nyounger bards. The instrument used in accompanying their songs was a\r\nsort of lyre, judging from representations on some gold medals made in\r\nthe time of Julius Cæsar. Charlemagne ordered a collection of the early\r\nGallic songs to be made, but the work has not survived.\r\n\r\n=The Celtic Bards=.—The Breton bards made use of an instrument the\r\nname of which is variously spelled Crouth, Crowd, Chrotta, Crwth,\r\nplayed with a bow, with an opening in the upper part through which\r\nthe performer placed the left hand in order to press the strings, the\r\nnumber of which varied from three to six. The crouth of the Welsh\r\nbards differed in some respects from those that were made use of by\r\nthe Breton bards. With them, however, a form of the harp became the\r\nnational instrument. The early history of Celtic music in Wales in\r\nparticular, is mingled with myth. We have only the names of bards,\r\nFingal, Fergus and Ossian, no authentic music. What is of importance to\r\nus is the secular organization of the bards. One class included poets,\r\nhistorians and those skilled in the science of heraldry; another class\r\ncomprehended musical bards, harp players bearing the title of doctors\r\nof music, players of the six stringed crouth and singers, who must have\r\nbeen skilled men, since nine years’ study was exacted of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRETON CROUTH. LYRE (9TH CENT).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRISH HARP. ENGLISH HARP.]\r\n\r\n=Ireland=.—The traditionary bard of Ireland is Fergus, whose songs\r\nwere of war and heroes. When St. Patrick introduced Christianity\r\ninto Ireland in the 5th century, learning and skill in the arts of\r\npoetry and music grew to be cultivated as extensively as in more\r\nfavored lands. In the 10th century, the famous musician was the King\r\nO’Brien Boru, whose harp is still shown in the Dublin Museum. This has\r\ntwenty-eight strings, and the sounding board, in which there are four\r\nholes, is very large at the base. After Ireland was conquered by the\r\nEnglish its culture declined, owing to continuous wars and internal\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\n=Scotland=.—The music of the Scotch, like the other Celtic races just\r\nmentioned, is characteristic. Their harp was similar in form to the\r\nIrish; their favorite instrument was the bagpipe. King James I is\r\ncredited with having done much to stimulate an interest in music among\r\nhis subjects. Having been a captive in England for a period of eighteen\r\nyears, he had acquired great skill in music, which was the solace\r\nof his weary hours. According to a contemporary historian, the king\r\nplayed a great many of the instruments in use in his day: the bagpipe,\r\npsaltery, organ, harp, lute, flute and dulcimer. The music of Scotland\r\nmakes great use of the pentatonic scales, and it is likely that the\r\noriginal form of many of the old Scottish folk-melodies was pentatonic.\r\nA characteristic feature of Scottish music is the so-called “Scotch\r\nsnap,” illustrated in the short notes in the familiar air “Comin’ Thro’\r\nthe Rye,” and in the following dance tune:\r\n\r\n[Music: STRATHSPEY]\r\n\r\nAn instrument of so marked characteristics as those displayed by the\r\nbagpipe will naturally develop a characteristic style of music. The\r\npipers gave extraordinary study to the mastery of their instrument and\r\nnoted players acquired wonderful skill.[8]\r\n\r\n=England=.—Until the time of the conquest of England by William of\r\nNormandy (1066), music among the Anglo-Saxons was practiced by the\r\nscalds or bards, minstrels (also called gleemen), and the monks in\r\nthe monasteries. Poetry and music were much encouraged by some of the\r\nkings and Alfred the Great (849-901) was widely famed for his skill in\r\nplaying the harp and as a singer. In the manuscripts belonging to these\r\nearly days in England we read of such instruments as the psaltery, the\r\nrota, little harps of eleven strings, viols, called fiddles, citharas,\r\ncornets, trumpets, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCANDINAVIAN LUDR.]\r\n\r\n=Scandinavia=.—The Runic style of writing,—which has numerous analogies\r\nto the neumes,—used by the northern people, presents many difficulties\r\nin the matter of translation, so that we have little chance to form\r\nan opinion as to the early music of the Scandinavian races. They have\r\ntheir national poems, a presentation of their myths in the Edda, and\r\nthe deeds of their great heroes in the Sagas, songs which inspired\r\nboth poets and musicians, an office most generally found united in one\r\nperson, called a scald, (equivalent to the Saxon bard). The sagas were\r\nsung or chanted by the scalds to the accompaniment of a small harp. In\r\n1639 and again in 1734, in the duchy of Schleswig, horns of pure gold\r\nwere found which had been used in the worship of Odin, covered with\r\nRunic inscriptions, which have not yet been satisfactorily deciphered.\r\nOther instruments belonging to this period that have been discovered\r\nand preserved in museums are bronze horns somewhat curious in shape,\r\ncalled lüdr. These instruments have been tested by experienced horn\r\nplayers and give forth a fine, resonant tone. Up to the present nothing\r\nhas been discovered to indicate that the northern races had a system\r\nof musical notation; melodies were undoubtedly transmitted by oral\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n=Finland=.—The people of Finland are intensely musical and have many\r\nbeautiful folk-songs. Their national epic is called the “Kalevala,” and\r\ngives the history of the hero, Wainœmonien, god of music, who by the\r\nexercise of his art, became the master of the universe, analogous to\r\nthe Greek myth of Orpheus. The Finnish bards used an instrument called\r\nKantèle or Harpu, a sort of psaltery with five strings forming the\r\nfirst five notes of the minor scale, G fourth space, bass staff, to D\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n=Progress in Southern Europe=.—As may be gathered from the hasty survey\r\nof music among the nations in the west and north of Europe, they did\r\nnot contribute to its growth during the centuries under consideration.\r\nIt was in the south of Europe that the forces were forming, and not in\r\nthe Church as heretofore, but outside, among the people. We cannot say\r\nwho composed the songs of the people, so different in character from\r\nthe songs of the Church; they seemed to spring up spontaneously and\r\nwere passed from one to another orally. The _music of the Church lacked\r\nmeasure_ or rhythm, as we may say, while the _music of the people_,\r\nclosely associated with dancing, was _rhythmic_. In fact, the scholarly\r\nmusicians of that period condemned the music of the people because\r\nof its marked rhythmic character. On account of the crudeness of the\r\nearly instruments, often the lack of them and of competent players,\r\nthe people were accustomed to sing to their dancing, a custom still\r\nfollowed in certain places. The next step was an easy one, that of\r\nmaking new verses to familiar airs. Another factor in spreading music\r\namong the people appears in the _traveling minstrels_. Without a fixed\r\nresidence, owing allegiance to no lord, by law, in many cases, out of\r\nthe pale of society, these free sons of art, who began to come into\r\nprominence in the 11th century, roved from place to place, resting for\r\nthe night in castle, monastery, inn or wayside camp. In return for the\r\nhospitality freely given, they sang the songs they learned from each\r\nother and in the various lands they visited. Their accomplishments in\r\nthe music line were varied. One, Robert le Mains, said: “I can play\r\nthe lute, the violin, the pipe, the bagpipe, the syrinx, the harp, the\r\ngigue, the gittern, the symphony, the psaltery, the organistrum, the\r\nregals, the tabor and the rote. I can sing a song well and make tales\r\nand fables.”\r\n\r\n=Trouvères=.—Another influence was also at work, one that was greatly\r\nto affect music, raising it from the level of common entertainment to\r\nan art patronized by the highest social circles. The Crusades left a\r\npermanent influence upon the people of Europe and upon the institution\r\nof Chivalry, the knightly singers (trouvères) vying with each other\r\nin verse and song, as well as in arms. Education took a higher place\r\nand schools became more numerous (12th and 13th centuries), and music\r\nwas given recognition; this was the case not only in schools connected\r\nwith monasteries, but also in the newly established universities, such\r\nas that at Paris. Secular music also had schools, so to speak, for,\r\nduring Lent, when all gay songs were forbidden, the trouvères and\r\nminstrels would stop at some convenient point and teach their songs to\r\nall who would learn; hither the great lords would send the minstrels\r\nin their pay to renew their repertoires and learn the songs that were\r\nmost favored by the polite world. It was not possible that much advance\r\ncould be made in musical education, from a scientific side, for there\r\nwas _no_ general _system_ of _convenient notation_. Airs were taught by\r\nplaying them over, the singer with the ready ear having the advantage.\r\nStill the efforts and studies made in the monasteries and schools were\r\nnot fruitless, although the systems evolved were very complicated,\r\nmaking the reading of music a difficult matter.\r\n\r\n=The Music of the Period=.—It is a fortunate thing for the investigator\r\nof the history of music that, at the present time, a number of\r\ncollections of the airs of the 12th and 13th centuries are still in\r\nexistence; for example, in the National Library, Paris, which possesses\r\na number of magnificent manuscripts, containing songs noted down by\r\nthe French trouvères; also in the Library of the Medical School of\r\nMontpelier there is a collection of nearly four hundred songs, secular\r\nand religious, for two, three or four voices. The _melodic ideas_ of\r\nthis period, as indicated by these manuscripts, were _vague_ and the\r\n_rhythms uncertain_. Yet this music, barbarous as it appears to us,\r\nwas not the product of chance, as we may think; it had its rules, just\r\nlike the music of today, the art of composing being called Discant,\r\nreferred to in Lesson VI. Sometimes these singers of the 12th and 13th\r\ncenturies tried to invent original airs, very frequently they would\r\ntake several familiar airs, two, three or four and combine them in\r\nwhat seems to us a crude way, yet in a manner that was pleasing to the\r\nhearers of their time. The style of the songs in use varied greatly, in\r\nspite of the poverty of musical resources. In general, a song for one\r\nvoice was used only in setting the _Chansons des Gestes_, _Romances_,\r\n_Pastourelles_, _Serventois_, _Lais_ and _Jeux Partis_. The discant\r\nstyle was used in _Motets_, _Rondeaux_, _Conduits_; according as these\r\nlatter compositions were for two, three, four or five voices, they were\r\ncalled _duplum_, _triplum_, _quadruplum_, and _quintuplum_.\r\n\r\n=Troubadours=.—The cradle of the French troubadours was in Provence,\r\nthe south of France. They usually belonged to the nobility, and,\r\ninstead of performing their own pieces, had them performed by the\r\n_jongleurs_, only occasionally consenting to sing for some company\r\nof high-born nobles and ladies. We mention a few of those who were\r\ncounted among the troubadours: Richard the Lion-Hearted, of England,\r\nCount William of Poitiers, Rambout, Count of Orange, Pierre d’Auvergne,\r\nPierre Ramon de Toulouse, Pierre Vidal, Pons de Capdueil, poet,\r\nsinger and violinist, Aimeric de Pequilain, Blagobres, a virtuoso on\r\nall instruments, Blondel de Nesle, the Chatelain de Coucy, Thibault,\r\nKing of Navarre. Clement, the French historian, gives a list of 28\r\ntrouvères of the 13th century, less prominent socially than those\r\nalready mentioned. The most celebrated of them and the most important\r\nfrom the historian’s standpoint is =Adam de La Hale= or =Halle=, born\r\n1240. He wrote many pieces, of which we have thirty-three songs, some\r\nrondeaux, six motets, some _Jeux Partis_, among the latter being a work\r\nwhich is regarded as a sort of comic opera, sometimes called the “first\r\nopera”: “Robin and Marion”; it consists of dialogue and airs.\r\n\r\n[Music: AIR FROM ROBIN AND MARION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSTRUMENTS OF THE MINNESINGERS.]\r\n\r\n=Minnesingers=.—While the trouvères and troubadours were singing\r\nin Provence and in France, an analogous association was forming in\r\nGermany, to which the name Minnesingers (_Minne_, old German, “love”)\r\nwas given. A list of names belonging to the 13th century includes\r\n162 men, among whom are several occupying thrones. Names that have\r\ninterest for us are Klingsor, Wolfram von Eschenbach (author of a poem\r\non “Parcival”), Gottfried of Strassburg (author of a poem “Tristan and\r\nIsolde”), =Walter von der Vogelweide=, the =Chevalier Tannhaeuser= and\r\nHeinrich Meissen, called Frauenlob. Richard Wagner has introduced some\r\nof these men in his operas. The versification of the Minnesingers has\r\nbeen much admired by critics; it was filled with art as well as beauty.\r\nTheir love themes differed from those of the Provençal singers in that\r\nwhile the poetry of the latter declared love as a gallant sentiment,\r\nthe Germans gave it a loftier tone by mingling it with the Madonna\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n=Folk-Song=.—While the German nobles were employing themselves in the\r\nservice of art, the people were not idle. They had their tunes and\r\ntheir verses. The _Locheimer Liederbuch_ (1452), contains a number of\r\nsongs, some of which are undoubtedly very old; they are melodious,\r\nvaried in rhythm and full of naïve simplicity. Some of them are\r\narranged in the popular _three-voice_ style, and show correct part\r\nleading, the inclination being _toward our major and minor modes_\r\ninstead of the Church Modes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANS SACHS.]\r\n\r\n=Mastersingers=.—The most noted musical organization among the people\r\nwas that of the Mastersingers (celebrated in Richard Wagner’s opera);\r\nNuremberg, Mayence, Strassburg and Frankfort were their centres. The\r\nmembers were organized into a Guild, just as was the case in trade\r\naffairs; they had a charter from the Emperor Charles IV. Their poetry\r\nand music were not elevated, for the members of the Guild were not of\r\na standing and an education to give them real skill in the fine arts.\r\nThe records of the Mastersingers show that the members were principally\r\ntradesmen, such as farriers, armorers, locksmiths, tailors, cobblers;\r\nyet there were some members who could lay claims to culture and higher\r\nstanding, as engravers, physicians and a few gentlemen of leisure.\r\nThe most conspicuous of them all was =Hans Sachs=, the cobbler-poet\r\nof Nuremberg. Their works were marked by _monotonous melody_, (for\r\nthe pitch is but little varied) and a heavy, clumsy rhythm. To make\r\nup for the lack of real artistic idea they were _pedantic_ to an\r\nextreme; composition was hedged about by a multitude of rules, to\r\nwhich composers must give exact obedience. These rules were given in a\r\ncode called Tablatura. They held contests in which the members vied in\r\nproducing works exemplifying the principles of the organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat country in Europe was inhabited by the Gauls?\r\n\r\nWhere did the Celts live?\r\n\r\nWhat countries did the Scandinavians inhabit?\r\n\r\nGive an account of their music.\r\n\r\nDescribe the work of minstrels, jongleurs, trouvères, troubadours.\r\n\r\nWhere did the Minnesingers live?\r\n\r\nTell about the Mastersingers.\r\n\r\nGive the names of minstrels or other singers famous in history.\r\n\r\nWhat was the condition of the artisan classes and guilds in the larger\r\nGerman cities at this time?\r\n\r\nIf possible, get the stories of the operas, “Tannhäuser” and the\r\n“Mastersingers of Nuremberg” and read them privately or in the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SUGGESTIONS FOR A REVIEW OF PREVIOUS LESSONS.\r\n\r\nGive an idea of the process by which music becomes an art and what the\r\nprinciples of music are.\r\n\r\nWhat sciences are drawn upon, and how, in the study of the beginnings\r\nof music?\r\n\r\nWhat countries offer interest to the student of musical beginnings?

The period we now take\r\nup was concerned most deeply, in its earlier stages, as we shall see,\r\nwith finding adequate and logical principles of construction by which a\r\nmusical composition of more or less length could be made from a simple\r\nmusical idea and in which more than one voice could be used.\r\n\r\nThis period should be studied with the greatest thoroughness, and all\r\npossible examples of music of the composers representative of the\r\nperiod should be examined that one may gather a clear idea of the\r\nbeginnings of composition and the development that shows from one\r\ngeneration to the next. These first gropings after the principles\r\nare matters of extreme interest to the musician when he compares the\r\nresults in the music of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n=The Polyphonic and Monophonic Styles=.—Students frequently express\r\nsurprise that the complicated polyphonic or contrapuntal system,\r\nwhich began to take shape in the 11th century, should appear first,\r\nhistorically. The pupil in composition begins his studies with the\r\nharmonic or monophonic style and is afterwards inducted into the\r\npolyphonic style. Why did the musical art develop along polyphonic\r\nand not on the simpler lines? It is intended that this lesson and\r\nthose that follow shall show some of the influences that caused the\r\nline of development to move in a polyphonic and not in a monophonic\r\ndirection. One thought is important to note. The elements of the\r\nsimple, monophonic style _were present_ in the music of the early\r\ncenturies, in the _people’s song_, principally; since, however, it was\r\nthe Church that determined the direction of artistic composition, the\r\nsimple, natural principles of melody-making _yielded precedence to_ a\r\nmore highly organized, _intellectual process_. Before taking up the\r\nconsideration of these matters it is well to get an understanding of\r\nthe terms Monophony and Polyphony.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of giving harmonic support to a melody: by\r\nadding an accompaniment of chords, in simple or elaborated form, or\r\nby dividing the notes of the chords among three or more voices, which\r\nnotes are sung or played simultaneously with the melody (an example\r\nis furnished by any simple air with accompaniment or a hymn-tune in\r\nfour parts, in which the “air” or melody is in the soprano); this is\r\nMonophony, (_monos_—Greek for “one,” _phone_—“sound”); a second method\r\nis to add to the given melody other melodies, each independent in its\r\nmovement up and down and in the duration of its successive sounds so\r\nfar as concerns the movement and duration of the sounds in the given\r\nmelody. This is Polyphony (_polus_, Greek for “many”).\r\n\r\n=Relation of Polyphonic to Modern Music=.—The exact relation of the\r\nPolyphonic Era to modern music has rarely been correctly estimated.\r\nWriters on this phase of the development of music are apt to lose\r\nthemselves in wonder on noting the scientific growth of the art, and\r\nto express their great surprise that so peculiar an evolution should\r\noccur. This view of the question is totally inadequate. In order truly\r\nto estimate the value and influence of the period, it is necessary to\r\ninquire into the properties of the materials of musical construction\r\nwhich were developed, and the value of those materials as a foundation\r\nfor the modern structure of music, apparently so different from the\r\nearly forms, but yet so intimately related to these forms.\r\n\r\nPolyphonic music presents to the student so complex a form as to\r\nrequire the aid of material imagery in order to help the mind to a\r\nproper conception of it. Perhaps no more misleading idea has been\r\nadvanced than that which makes use of the Gothic cathedral as an\r\nillustration of polyphonic form. It is true that in its multiplicity\r\nand yet inter-relation of details the cathedral expresses one of the\r\ndominant ideas of polyphonic music; but here the likeness fails. A\r\nnicer perception of the subject may be gained by comparing _polyphonic\r\nmusic_ to the _foundation of a Gothic cathedral_, strong and massive\r\nin construction, of utmost need to the permanence of the building,\r\nbut entirely lost sight of in a general view of the whole structure;\r\nthe importance of the comparison being the likeness of the complex\r\nand highly-developed superstructure to monophonic or modern music,\r\nseemingly so independent of what lies beneath, but in reality,\r\ndependent upon, and intimately connected with the established basis.\r\nOnly in this way can we apprehend the real value of the polyphonic\r\nfoundation to our superstructure of modern music; but for that\r\nfoundation our modern music must have remained in its infancy for\r\ncenturies to come. No freedom of artistic expression can be gained\r\nuntil absolute command of the material to be used has been obtained,\r\nand the principles thoroughly assimilated by the artist.\r\n\r\n=Polyphony and Monophony Contrasted=.—In the concrete, _polyphonic_\r\nmusic may be represented by a series of lines representing _separate_\r\nand distinct _melodies_; though a principal melody is always used,\r\nit is not supported by chords of harmonic structure but by other\r\nmelodies, or transpositions of the same melody, so used as to contrast\r\nwith and support each other. Polyphonic music was essentially\r\nmelodic, and, as has been very aptly stated, is to be thought of\r\nhorizontally. Monophonic music might best be represented by one\r\nhorizontal line supported at intervals by short, perpendicular lines.\r\nIn this case the horizontal line represents the only distinct melody,\r\nand the perpendicular lines the subordinate or harmonic support or\r\naccompaniment. The following example illustrates the process of using\r\nthe same melody to furnish the principal idea and also the accompanying\r\nsupport, the latter being at the same time simply a transposition of\r\nthe original melody.\r\n\r\n[Music: Lento 1st Voice 2d Voice 3d Voice]\r\n\r\nPolyphonic Style. Bach Fugue. Subject (or melody) enters in measure\r\none; again, transposed to the fourth below in measure three, and one\r\noctave below in measure ten. Enough is cited to show the horizontal\r\nstructure of polyphonic music.\r\n\r\nTo present the idea more clearly and for the sake of contrast, a melody\r\nwith accompaniment is shown in the next illustration, giving a single\r\nmelody with the subordinate chord accompaniment, the chords in whole\r\nnotes indicating the harmonic structure or basis.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nBeethoven, Op. 24, Monophonic Style.

The period\r\npreceding the year 1000 A. D. was truly a _period_ of _fundamental\r\nresearch_ into the underlying principles of melodic and harmonic\r\nstructure; but so crude and hesitating was the use of what was found\r\nthat it is certain that polyphonic material was entirely misused\r\nuntil the birth of “measured music” dispelled this darkness by the\r\nenlightening influence of Proportion and Form. So many forms of musical\r\ngrowth, such as came in later years, were impossible without the\r\nmensural proportion, that is, music written so as to indicate duration,\r\nthat this initial period gathered but a chaotic mass of musical\r\nmaterial which was left undigested and unassimilated until the epoch of\r\nthe Paris school.\r\n\r\n=Beginning of Polyphony in Greek Magadizing=.—The music of the Middle\r\nAges has great interest for the historian and the student. It stands\r\nbetween our music and the music of the ancients; it drove its roots\r\ndeep into the ancient time and extended its branches far into the\r\ncontemporaneous epoch. It is the struggle between the two elements,\r\nthe changes foreshadowed and apparent that give such interest to the\r\nhistory of music in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nPolyphonic music was long in growing. To understand clearly, one must\r\nexamine it from its very _beginning_ in Greek _magadizing_, referred to\r\nin Lesson V. Music for many centuries was, in all its most important\r\nphases, entirely vocal. The ancients, probably because of the crude\r\nforms of their instruments, valued the human voice as the most suitable\r\nmeans of expressing the feelings through music, thus causing the\r\npeculiar phenomenon of the extremely late development of dissonances.\r\nWhile instruments can easily perform even the harshest of the\r\ndissonances, it is almost impossible for untrained voices to sing other\r\nthan the more simple consonances. For this reason, the dependence on\r\nthe voice as practically the only medium for the expression of musical\r\nideas forced the cultivators of music to use the simple consonances of\r\nthe octave, fourth and fifth. In its earliest stages music was entirely\r\nmelodic and was limited to the use of one distinct melody, so that,\r\nno matter how many were singing, but _one melody_ was employed. Soon\r\narose the problem of accommodating the voices of boys and men to the\r\nsame melody. It was manifestly impossible to have men and boys sing\r\nin unison, because of the difference in the compass of their voices;\r\nso the Greeks hit upon the plan of causing them to _sing in octaves_,\r\na plan which science sanctioned, for had not Pythagoras proven that\r\nthe octave, after the unison, was the most perfect consonance? This\r\nthe Greeks called Magadizing. Why the Greeks, knowing as they did the\r\nother consonances, did not magadize in the fourth and fifth cannot\r\nbe explained; the only argument that can be advanced is, that their\r\nmelodies were so limited in range that the voice of any man, whether\r\ntenor or bass, could without difficulty reach the highest or lowest\r\ntones of a melody in unison. While magadizing among the Greeks cannot\r\nbe counted as a great advance toward the realm of polyphony and\r\nharmony, yet it was the first important step in the evolution, and as\r\nsuch, is important. So far, the voices singing _simultaneously_, though\r\nat a different pitch, and moving together in _similar_ time values,\r\nfollowed monophonic methods.\r\n\r\n=Organum the Next Step=.—Further development did not take place until\r\nthe destruction of Greek civilization had occurred and a sufficient\r\nlapse of time had allowed the Christian Church to establish itself:\r\nin a religious sense, in the hearts of the people, and in a permanent\r\nsense, by building churches and monasteries. In these monasteries we\r\nfind the next great advance in magadizing, though now under the name\r\nof Diaphony or Organum. The musical learning of the time was painfully\r\ninadequate for the uses to which it was put. There remained in\r\nexistence only a few of the Greek scientific scales, and those woefully\r\ndistorted in form; no simple notation or musical literature; and in all\r\nprobability, only a tradition in regard to the melodic construction\r\nand magadizing. Perhaps this was just as well, however, for the problem\r\nconfronting these monks differed greatly from that solved by the\r\nGreeks. In the monasteries _only men’s voices were used_, and these\r\nwithout special regard to the compass. The problem was this: Given a\r\nmelody to sing, using men’s voices of every range, from high tenor to\r\nlow bass, without using independent parts. The difficulties were two in\r\nnumber: they had no conception of independent parts, and their melodies\r\nwere of greater range than those of the Greeks, thus forbidding the\r\npractice of singing entirely in the octave or unison. The solution was\r\nreached in the following way, as indicated in the preceding lesson: If\r\nthe octave, unison, fourth and fifth were consonances, why not _sing\r\nin the fourth and fifth_ as well as in the unison and octave? They\r\nhad as yet no idea of singing two distinct melodies at the same time,\r\nbut thought only of singing the same melody in the most consonant or\r\nagreeable manner. The result was music which sounded like the following\r\nexample; while it was crude and harsh, it gave every monk opportunity\r\nto sing simultaneously the same melody, no matter what the range of his\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the ninth century, as we learned in Lesson VI,\r\nat the time of =Otger= or =Odo=, an abbot of Provence, in France,\r\norganizing had so developed as to be written for as many as four parts,\r\nusing, however, only the perfect consonances, as the next example will\r\nshow. In reality there are but two parts, as the two lower voices\r\ndouble the upper.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=Secular Organum=.—The most remarkable advance is shown in a form\r\ncalled Secular Organum, probably because of some relation to the\r\nFolk-song and the common people. This form showed the use not only\r\nof perfect consonances but of the imperfect consonance of the third;\r\nand, wonderful to relate, of a second, though only in a passing sense.\r\nThat such a discord should be used is a remarkable commentary on the\r\ninherent sense of harmony which seemed to exist naturally, even at that\r\nearly day. This form may have had its germ in the drone bass supplied\r\nby the bagpipe, which figured in the music of the people.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nExample of Secular Organum showing use of third and second.\r\n\r\n=The Workers=.—Two men, as was shown in the preceding lesson, were\r\ninstrumental in remarkably furthering this growth of music. =Hucbald=,\r\nof St. Amand, in Flanders, was born in 840 A. D. and died in 930. He\r\nwas a friend of Otger of Provence, and it is through the latter that\r\nsome of Hucbald’s work is preserved. Hucbald probably never wrote in\r\norganum of more than two parts, though mention is made of an organum\r\ncredited to him and having in addition to the two voices, a third\r\nsinging a pedal-point, or a bass on one single tone. His principal work\r\nis a manuscript on organum, a work of great reference value. =Guido\r\nof Arezzo=, born 990, died 1050, is of even more importance. Unlike\r\nHucbald and Otger, he seems to have been more than a secluded monk,\r\nfor he visited Rome and was a well-known figure in the church. He was\r\na most active teacher, and while his chief work was in developing\r\nnotation, he nevertheless contributed important material in the form of\r\norganum, writing in as many as four parts, though in respect to the use\r\nof the less perfect consonances he was very little freer than Hucbald.\r\n\r\nA short example, extracted from an 11th century three-part composition,\r\nis given here as a specimen of the combinations and successions\r\nthat were tolerated by the ears of the Middle Ages, and to show the\r\ntendency toward greater freedom in the direction of the motion of the\r\nparts, pointing toward those principles which later formed the science\r\nof Counterpoint.\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\nTENOR (sounds lower octave)\r\n\r\nTENOR (sounds lower octave)\r\n\r\nBASS]\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting points may be seen in this barbarous composition:\r\nFirst, the imitation by the second tenor of the phrase given by the\r\nfirst tenor. This is evidently intentional, as this phrase occurs three\r\ntimes in the course of the composition and is imitated in the same\r\nway every time. This same phrase occurs near the end of the bass part\r\n(which is the theme or _Cantus_) and it _may_ have been chosen for\r\nthis very reason for use in the Discant parts. Secondly, the initial\r\nand final chords, viz.: root, fifth and octave—are familiar to all\r\nstudents of Strict Counterpoint. Writers as late as Cherubini call this\r\ncombination the best for beginning and ending Three Part Counterpoint.\r\n\r\n=Development Determined by the Church=.—The Church and its beliefs\r\nwere responsible for this singular yet not illogical development.\r\nConsidering the peculiar monastic conditions, the evolution could not\r\nbe expected to occur along lines which it would have taken had it been\r\ndeveloped among the people and under the influence of the Folk-song.\r\nThe learning of these monks was largely in church lore, and this, with\r\na desire for a peculiar church music, led to the _discarding_ of the\r\nnatural and vivacious _melodies_ and _rhythms_ of the _people_, for the\r\nscientific and ascetic music and discipline of monastic religion. The\r\none great advantage of this period to modern music was the constant\r\nassociation with the principal intervals of the scale; an association\r\nwhich may be partially responsible for our modern Tonic and Dominant\r\nharmonies. On the whole, this period represents the marking out of the\r\nlines of musical development for the eight centuries following, though\r\nthe men responsible for this beginning could hardly have known or\r\nappreciated the impetus which was to be given polyphonic music by the\r\ninvention of their simple devices to accommodate voices of different\r\ncompass and to secure concerted singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nOxford History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Harmony, Schools\r\nof Composition, and Organum.\r\n\r\nHope.—Mediæval Music.\r\n\r\nWilliams.—Music of the Ancient Greeks.

Music, owing to its lack of\r\nthe concrete and the inability of men literally to place their hands\r\nupon its material, had lagged behind, so that in 1100 we find only a\r\nsmall amount of material, and that in a most chaotic condition. This\r\nmaterial was, however, sufficient to produce definite musical forms\r\nif united into a homogeneous whole; such a state, however, could\r\nbe produced only as the result of some great influence which would\r\ngalvanize the component parts into action. Fortunately, there was\r\njust such an influence, one which had passed through an evolution\r\nsimilar to that needed in music, though because of its more concrete\r\nform and its necessity to man, this evolution had occurred at a\r\nproportionately earlier date. This influence was an art form, a phase\r\nof architecture known as the Gothic. Gothic architecture was a form\r\nbuilt up by the unifying of the principal styles of architecture into\r\none uniform whole, and composed of a _multiplicity_ of _details_, but\r\nof such evident _relation to each other_ as to make a distinct art\r\nform. This form was first used in Paris about the year 1000 A. D.\r\nMusic was, approximately, in the same condition as Architecture before\r\nthe birth of the Gothic principle, and needed a stimulus, a comrade\r\nart undergoing much the same evolution, to start it on its path of\r\npolyphonic development. In the year 1100 musical chaos became united\r\ninto one uniform art by means of Measured Music or Proportion, thus\r\nallowing the systematizing of the mass of then existing material,\r\nand the construction of definite art forms. Since Architecture had\r\nundergone just such a change one century before, it is more than\r\nprobable that the effect of this change was the starting of a similar\r\none in Music, though the result was not to show until one hundred years\r\nafter its occurrence in the kindred art.\r\n\r\n=Paris the Centre of Europe=.—It was natural that these two great\r\nchanges should take place in Paris, at that time the centre of wealth\r\nand learning for all Europe. Paris, in addition to its many other\r\nadvantages, had long possessed a great university which had produced\r\nmany scholars and theologians. The influence of the Church in all art\r\nwas then paramount, for all art was employed in the service of the\r\nChurch; Architecture gave to the Church its Gothic cathedrals; Painting\r\nand Frescoing its marvelous interior decorations; while Music made\r\npossible the richer forms of the service or liturgy. In that sense the\r\nChurch, in its centre of theological study, would undoubtedly react on\r\nthe practice of music and produce more beautiful forms for the service.\r\nIn this period it is worthy of note that all the _famous musicians_,\r\nas before, were _monks_, or men employed in the Church, and the reason\r\nfor this condition is plain: there was no art of music outside of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n=Measured Music=.—Just as the use of many voices produced singing\r\nin parts, so did it produce Measured Music. To make it possible to\r\nuse more than two parts at the same time it was necessary to have\r\nsome definite agreement as to the value of the notes, in order to\r\nhave certain uniform times for beginning, ending and performing the\r\ndifferent portions of a composition agreeably; and so Measured Music\r\nwas born. It may be said here that the different metrical divisions\r\nwere not shown by means of bar lines as we now use them, but by\r\ndifferent groupings of the notes, the time value of each depending on\r\nits relative position to the others. Perhaps of all forms produced by\r\nthis system, the _Organum Purum_ was the earliest and most peculiar.\r\nIt consisted of a _Cantus Firmus_ set to words, and metrical in form;\r\na second voice freely extemporized a higher part, evidently the only\r\nrule being that the two finish together. At a late date, strict Discant\r\nsometimes alternated with the old Organum, making it much less free in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n=The Important Forms=.—In reality, the important forms produced were\r\nentirely in strict metrical divisions. Of these, the most important\r\nwere the so-called strict Organum, the Conductus, the Roundel and the\r\nMotet. Of the strict Organum very little is known, excepting that it\r\nwas a strictly metrical form, differing, in that sense only, from\r\nthe Organum Purum; it had also words for all parts and not only for\r\nthe Cantus Firmus, as had the older forms. The Conductus, from the\r\nLatin _conducere_, to conduct, was important, and was a secular form\r\nhaving as its basis a popular melody or a newly invented one, secular\r\nwords and much freer intervals than church compositions. Each part\r\nwas expected to be melodious; and it varied from two to four in the\r\nnumber of voices used. It was sung during a march, a funeral cortège or\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nConductus for three voices showing that each part is a distinct melody.\r\nOxford History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n=The Roundel=, from an historical view-point, was the most important\r\nform, for in it much use was made of Imitation. It can best be\r\nexplained in the words of Walter Odington, a theorist of the time:\r\n“Let a melody, with or without a text, in one of the regular modes\r\nof rhythm, and as beautiful as possible, be devised, and let each\r\nvoice sing this in turn. And at the same time let other melodies be\r\ndevised to accompany it in the second and (if there be three voices)\r\nin the third voice; let them proceed in consonances, and so that when\r\none voice ascends another descends, and let the third not follow too\r\nclosely the movement of either of the others, except perhaps for the\r\nsake of greater beauty. And let all of these melodies be sung by each\r\nvoice in turn.” While the use of Imitation is important in that it\r\nrecognizes the _repetition_ of a set phrase as an _aid_ to _Unity_, its\r\nimportance is detracted from, at least at this period, because it was\r\nnot used in any of the other forms then in vogue.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nRoundel for three voices showing Imitation. There are six distinct\r\nmelodic phrases, and by numbering these wherever they appear, the\r\nImitation can readily be observed.\r\n\r\n=Imitation a Means of Securing Unity=.—An art form must submit to\r\nthe laws of the human mind, which demand that a work of art shall\r\nshow three principles: Unity, Variety or Contrast and Proportion or\r\nSymmetry. The problem set before the old composers was to produce\r\nmusical works which should exhibit obedience to the canons of art\r\nas determined in the sister arts which had already reached great\r\nperfection. Unity in a musical work means that it is a development of\r\none central thought, in elaborate works, of several leading ideas. The\r\ngerm of a musical composition is in the Theme. The composer’s problem\r\nis to elaborate a piece of some length from this Theme, in that way to\r\nsecure Unity of idea. If he were limited to writing in one part, he\r\nwould be compelled to _repeat_ the Theme a number of times, either on\r\nthe _same_ or on a _different_ degree. When he must write for three\r\nor more voices the problem becomes more complicated. Let us imagine\r\na composer of the 12th-century at his work. He has a theme to use,\r\nlike the one in the example at the end of the preceding paragraph,\r\nwhich he is to use in three parts. From the composers of the preceding\r\ncenturies he received the principle of _transposing_ the theme a fourth\r\nor fifth or octave higher or lower, thus singing the same melody\r\n_simultaneously_ at different pitches; but this he rejects as crude; he\r\nhas passed that stage and wishes to use a newer, more advanced method.\r\nObviously his recourse will be to let each of the other two voices sing\r\nthe opening theme _successively_ at the same pitch. To stop with this\r\nchange would result only in three successive repetitions of the opening\r\ntheme; so he makes the second and third voices sing the phrases used by\r\nthe first voice after the first theme has been given, which serve as\r\nan accompaniment to the second and third entries of the first theme;\r\nthus all the voices sing the various phrases, at different times and\r\nin different successions, as shown by the numbering of the phrases.\r\nIn later times the principal phrases were sung _successively and\r\ntransposed_ at the same time. This principle of Imitation is the very\r\nfoundation of the later complicated polyphonic system.\r\n\r\n=The Motet=.—In the form of the Motet we note many peculiarities. Each\r\nvoice had different words, though the Tenor or foundation of the\r\ncomposition used but _one_ single word throughout; also, the Tenor\r\nwas composed of a certain metrical and melodic figure closely adhered\r\nto and built up out of some popular song. The words and the form were\r\nsacred in that they were used in worship.\r\n\r\n=The Men of the Time=.—There are many men who wrote in these forms\r\nbut it is only necessary to examine those of importance. =Franco of\r\nCologne= (1150-1220), (dates disputed), an organist, was probably\r\nthe pioneer in the adoption of Measured Music. He first advocated\r\nthe use of triple meter and classified the dissonances of major and\r\nminor thirds and sixths. He used his influence _against_ the use of\r\n_consecutive fourths_ and _fifths_, and _for_ the use of _contrary\r\nmotion_. The result is in many ways shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=Leonin= (about 1140) and =Perotin= (his pupil) were organists at\r\nNotre Dame in Paris. The former was noteworthy in the reform of\r\nnotation, while the latter is known principally for his use of crude\r\nImitation, and a tendency not to use consecutive fourths and fifths,\r\nthough he never entirely succeeded in eradicating them. =Franco of\r\nParis= (1150———), often confused with his namesake of Cologne, was\r\na theoretician, improved notation, and wrote a treatise on Mensural\r\nMusic. =Jean de Garlande= (1170-125—) not only wrote a very valuable\r\ntreatise on Mensural Music, but was also a composer of note; his\r\nwritings contained specimens of Double Counterpoint, though probably\r\nused without the intention of producing them. =Jerome de Moravie=\r\n(1260) wrote a scholarly treatise on Discant, and such was his ability\r\nthat he illustrated it with his own compositions, making it one of the\r\nmost valuable reference works in existence. It is worthy of mention\r\nthat all of these men were churchmen in the sense that their work was\r\nall done in, or with the approval of, the Church, and was therefore\r\ninfluenced by the peculiar beliefs and customs then obtaining in that\r\ninstitution. This point must ever be kept in mind, for any prolonged\r\ncontact with Folk-music must have changed the entire development of the\r\nart; therefore we must regard the Church as the dominant influence of\r\nearly music.\r\n\r\n=Summary=.—The work of this period can hardly be over-estimated.\r\nFirst we see the influence of the Gothic in architecture, producing\r\na corresponding unity in music; a unity which was concomitant with\r\nMeasured or Mensural Music. We next see the attempt to combine metrical\r\nwith unmetrical forms in the Organum Purum, and the final result in\r\nthe strict form of Organum. Then we note the freedom shown in the\r\nConductus, Roundel and Motet, as well as freedom in the use of more\r\npleasing intervals, with the tendency to eradicate consecutive fourths\r\nand fifths; the use of contrary motion instead of parallel, and the\r\nconsequent melodic freedom of the voices, and finally the use of\r\nImitation, though perhaps unintentionally, except in the Roundel. This\r\nperiod then marks the acquisition not only of new intervals, new forms,\r\nnew styles of melodic writing, imitation, measured music and simple\r\ncounterpoint of note against note, but also forms the foundation for a\r\nrapid development by bequeathing to the Gallo-Belgic School a wealth of\r\nmaterial, bound up with rules and only half-suspected as to its value,\r\nit is true, but broad and firm enough to sustain a mighty structure of\r\ntrue Polyphonic Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

Paris for a\r\ntime satisfactorily filled these conditions, and then gave place to\r\na school, stronger and better equipped: that of the Netherlands.\r\nThere were several reasons for this change in the centre of musical\r\nactivity. So long as Paris was dominant in wealth and civilization,\r\nand so long as she maintained her supremacy in the intellectual fields\r\nof the Church and university, so long did she retain the centre of\r\nculture; but when her wealth became such as to produce degeneracy\r\nin the taste for pure art, and love of show rather than real worth\r\nbecame predominant, then her native pupils began to lose their\r\nintellectual strength, and the pupils from foreign countries began\r\nto furnish the real culture. The establishment of the Papal See at\r\nAvignon in the south of France doubtless contributed to the supremacy\r\nof France in music and the liberal arts. When the See was restored\r\nto Rome, in 1377, Paris and her school of music were relegated to\r\nthe background. From this period on it was but a matter of time for\r\nthese pupils to carry the centre of musical culture from Paris to\r\na place possessing a foundation for musical growth, and a greater\r\nnumber of strong minded scholars, and where political conditions were\r\nfavorable. The Netherlands surpassed Paris in all of these important\r\nparticulars, though not at the time when the Paris School ceased to be\r\nof importance. There was a school of transition which filled the space\r\nleft between the important work of Paris and the supremacy of the\r\nNetherlands; that school was the Gallo-Belgic, located northeast from\r\nParis on the borderline between France and Belgium, Tournay being the\r\ncentre. The school at Paris was occupied in acquiring material for use;\r\nthe school of the Netherlands developed polyphonic music emotionally;\r\nthe step from acquisition to arrangement of material was necessary\r\nbefore emotional development could occur, and that was the work of the\r\nGallo-Belgic School. This school was located in the country of Hucbald\r\nand Odo, who had built up there, a little while before, a system of\r\nmusic which was the foundation of the polyphonic style, and which had\r\nprepared the people for a culture of greater value and importance.\r\nThus we see that musical development followed the line of greatest\r\npreparation, and utilized the preparatory work furnished by these two\r\nmen. And finally, it was a direct step toward the Netherlands which\r\nwere even then beginning the struggle in which they were victorious,\r\nfor supremacy in commerce, art, and music.\r\n\r\n=Contribution of the Paris School=.—When the Paris school ceased to\r\nbe of utmost importance to the world of music it had bequeathed to\r\nthe later schools Measured Music, and its forms of Organum, Motet,\r\nConductus and Roundel, and the use of certain not unpleasing intervals,\r\nthough occasional consecutive fourths, fifths, and octaves appeared.\r\nIt was, then, the business of the Gallo-Belgic school to refine these\r\nintervals, develop measured music, and so improve and develop these\r\nold primary forms, eliminating some and evolving others, as to give\r\nthe school of the Netherlands, one century later, forms pleasing in\r\nintervals and of sufficient unity and design to afford opportunity for\r\nthe infusion of the emotional. In the matter of intervals much was done\r\nto develop and use the old ones, excepting the consecutive fourths and\r\nfifths which were abolished never to appear again, and many new, or\r\npreviously unused intervals, were made use of. In the matter of forms,\r\nwe hear no more of the crude Organum and Conductus, but a little about\r\nthe Motet, and nothing at all in regard to the Roundel, as such. It\r\nis, however, due entirely to this last form that polyphonic music\r\ndeveloped; though we hear no more of the Roundel, we do hear much in\r\nregard to the Canon, and the Canon was but a highly developed species\r\nof the Roundel.\r\n\r\n=Imitation and the Canon=.—The use of Imitation, as we have seen,\r\ngradually became more and more important. The old monks, in the very\r\nbeginning, imitated melody in the fourth and fifth; at the time of\r\nthe Paris school these melodies were combined with new ones making\r\nImitation with more than one melody, though the melody underwent no\r\nreal organic development. Now we see in the inception of the Canon a\r\ndevelopment of real Imitation of only one melody, but given _Variety_\r\nby use of the devices of Inversion, Augmentation, Diminution, etc. And\r\nnot only did this occur in the Canon, but we find it also in the other\r\nforms, in a freer style, adding materially to the _Unity_. Imitation is\r\nthe foundation principle of polyphonic music, and this principle was\r\npresent in the crude efforts of the old monks, in the more intelligent\r\nefforts of the Paris school, and now for the first time, receives, in\r\nthe Gallo-Belgic school, a partial recognition of its real value, and a\r\ncommensurate use.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nNaumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page 315, extract from a chanson by\r\nDufay. Figure 1 shows the principal melody, figure 2 shows the same\r\nat the fifth below. The entire chanson is quoted in Naumann with the\r\nvarious imitations fairly well marked; the student should refer to it.\r\n\r\n=The Value of Imitation=.—We must understand, however, that mere\r\nImitation is in itself not a remarkable phenomenon. We imitate, more\r\nor less unconsciously, in all arts, and even in our daily habits;\r\nbut this would be of no lasting importance did we not take that\r\nimitation as a foundation for future development, as did the composers\r\nof this school. And in these polyphonic schools the imitation was\r\nunintentional, as a definite aid to the structure of a musical idea,\r\nuntil it was seen that the _imitation_ must be _confined_ to _one\r\ndefinite idea_ or melody. It was then that the original treatment of\r\nmelodic development began, and the various devices for developing\r\na melody, without changing its organic structure, inaugurated.\r\nThis marked the beginning of a school of musical art, a school of\r\ndefinite, and not chance evolution; or in other words, arrangement and\r\ndevelopment of the earlier acquired ideas.\r\n\r\n=A Technical Principle=.—A little consideration will show how the\r\nprinciple of Imitation was developed. The first step was to imitate a\r\nmelody at a lower or higher pitch and sing the two or more versions\r\n_simultaneously_; the next step was to bring in the second and other\r\nimitating voices _successively_, at the same or different pitch; thus\r\nmaking the imitation more prominent. So long as composers confined\r\ntheir efforts to using fixed melodies, they could not go far. When\r\nthey began to adapt well-known melodies and later to invent their\r\nown it became possible to make a lengthy work, this leading to a\r\ncomposition in which each of the accompanying voices imitated the\r\nfirst; sometimes only two voices used imitation, the other having a\r\nsomewhat free part. A next step was to _vary_ the _imitation_, by\r\nchanging the motion of the imitating part; if the melody moved up,\r\nthe imitating part moved downward and _vice versa_; sometimes the\r\nmovement was reversed, the imitation beginning with the last note of\r\nthe phrase and proceeding to the first; sometimes it was made in notes\r\nof smaller value (diminution), sometimes in larger (augmentation).\r\nThese and other devices were experimented with and worked out by the\r\nGallo-Belgic composers. One readily sees that this is _intellectual_\r\nwork, that it puts a premium on cleverness and lays expression aside.\r\nYet the technic of an art must first be acquired and the composers\r\nof this period were doing this in working out a system of technic in\r\ncomposition with Imitation as the foundation.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIllustration from Naumann, “History of Music,” page 321, Vol. I,\r\nshowing at 1 and 2 the principal melody and its imitation, and at 3,\r\nimitation and inversion. The student should examine the entire example\r\nin Naumann.\r\n\r\n=The Work of the Gallo-Belgic School=.—We note that many of the new\r\nideas came into being at this time, all of them, however, tending\r\ntoward the arranging of material or the preparing of it for the\r\nemotional style. The Canon, and the principle of Imitation, developed\r\na set of strict rules which tended to produce more adequate command\r\nof material and assisted in shaping the Fugue; though we, in our\r\nown day, regard these rules as positively detrimental to the real\r\nexpression of emotion, yet they were necessary adjuncts to the real\r\ncommand of _technic_. With Imitation came Counterpoint of a more\r\nhighly developed form; an inevitable step toward the fugal style of\r\nthe later polyphonic periods. And lastly came a use of _Folk-music\r\nmelodies_ and the _Leading Tone_, important because they foreshadow the\r\nabandonment of the old Church Modes, and the _adoption of the Natural\r\nScale_. This marks the important point in the Gallo-Belgic school;\r\nfor with the introduction of the Natural Scale there came increasing\r\ntendency for emotional expression, which could never have occurred had\r\nthe Church Modes retained their former position in music. The idea\r\nof this preparation of material for emotional development cannot be\r\nemphasized too strongly. Upon the Gallo-Belgic school rested the burden\r\nof preparing this material for the later schools, so that these could\r\ndemonstrate to the world that while polyphonic music could not be\r\nsurpassed as a means of expressing certain impersonal, almost religious\r\nemotions, it could not express to the fullest, the intimate, personal,\r\nemotional ideas of the romantic composers.\r\n\r\n=The Men=.—The men of this period are more important than any that have\r\nyet been mentioned, and for that reason require more detailed study.\r\n=H. de Zeelandia= (13—-1370), a native of Flanders, was a teacher and\r\ncomposer, and author of a theoretical treatise with musical examples,\r\n“De Musica”; with him the use of consecutive fourths, fifths and\r\noctaves almost disappears, though it remained for a later composer to\r\nabolish these entirely. =Guillaume Dufay= (1355-1435) was the one to\r\nwhom this reform must be finally accredited. He used in place of the\r\nold church form of Cantus Firmus, the popular melodies of the people\r\nwith their tendency toward the Natural Scale and the use of the Leading\r\nTone and its decisive tonality; it may be said that these melodies\r\nwere not used in their entirety, or even in their original form, the\r\nrhythm and meter oftentimes being altered so that the airs were hardly\r\nrecognizable, though the essential parts were there. It is Dufay who\r\nis responsible for the first intelligent use of Imitation as a basis\r\nfor the Canon. =Gilles (Ægidius) Binchois= (1400-1465) was a noted\r\ncomposer and, with Dufay, a joint founder of the Gallo-Belgic school.\r\nHe is said to have been a soldier before he entered the Church, and\r\nmust have been of a light-hearted disposition, as he was called “the\r\nfather of joyousness.” He was the teacher of Okeghem, Firmin Caron and\r\nof Busnois. =Antoine de Busnois= (1440-1481) was the last famous master\r\nof this school before it was merged into the school of the Netherlands.\r\nIn his works one can note a further progress in smoothness of style\r\nand examples of well managed imitation. The character of the latter\r\nis so scholarly and so clearly not a matter of improvisation that we\r\nmust consider him a man given to study and reflection, just the kind of\r\ncharacter to give scientific study to the principle of Imitation.\r\n\r\n=The Importance of this School=.—This school occupied only a short\r\nperiod of time (1360-1460), as compared to some of the other schools;\r\nbut in that time much was done. The material taken from the Paris\r\nschool was great and capable of being developed, though it was\r\nencumbered by unusual intervals and a prejudice against the more\r\neuphonious ones, and by a number of obsolete forms; so obsolete, in\r\nfact, that with perhaps one exception, the Motet, none lasted until\r\nthe time of Bach. But the use of Imitation and Measured Music was\r\nsufficient for the men of the Gallo-Belgic school, and with this\r\nas a foundation, and the constantly-increasing tendency to use the\r\nFolk-music and the Natural Scale, they succeeded in so arranging their\r\nmaterial that the men of the Netherlands had but to infuse emotion to\r\nmake it produce great music. Dufay and his contemporaries had done this\r\nmuch: to create organically well-ordered tone combinations agreeable\r\nboth in melodic and harmonic relations. Both artists and public found\r\npleasure in the many transitions, the free use of suspensions, the\r\naltered tones and chords borrowed from other scales, in the ensemble\r\nof these methods which did not give rise in reality to chord-relations\r\nas we understand them, yet suggested something of the kind, and\r\nparticularly were they pleased with the use of the variety-giving\r\nchanging notes. Because the Gallo-Belgic school did not invent new\r\nforms, or develop old forms to a high degree of perfection, is no\r\nreason why it should not be given a high rank among polyphonic schools,\r\nfor the process of refining and transition is often more difficult than\r\nthat of inventing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

In\r\n1346, Edward III of England won the battle of Crécy; the struggle was\r\ncontinued for the next hundred years at intervals, when the appearance\r\nof Joan of Arc (1412-1431) assisted the French. Monasteries were left\r\nunmolested, hence the monks near the Belgian border were able to work\r\nin comparative peace and quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON XI.\r\n\r\n                          THE ENGLISH SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The English Polyphonic School= is at once the least important and\r\nthe most peculiar of all the schools of the Polyphonic Period. It is\r\nusually ignored by the writers on early music, not because there was\r\nno musical culture, but because there was not continuous and original\r\ndevelopment. English writers on this phase of musical development are\r\ntoo apt, through a pardonable pride of nationality, to exaggerate the\r\nvalue of British music, and in consulting such authorities, one should\r\nbe careful to examine thoroughly all proofs of a dominant national\r\nschool and discard such statements as are not perfectly authenticated.\r\nIt is hardly the Englishman’s fault that he has had no definite culture\r\nwhich he may call genuinely English, for native composers have had more\r\nencouragement in England than usually falls to the lot of a creative\r\nmusician. Indeed, England has always been a patron of the best in\r\nmusic, native or foreign, and no one nation has, as a whole, been more\r\ngenerous in appreciation; her treatment of Beethoven on his death-bed\r\nis a notable example of disinterested generosity. But in real,\r\noriginal, creative art England has had no great past; and especially is\r\nthis true of the Polyphonic Period.\r\n\r\n=A Warlike People=.—This is almost entirely due to her geographical\r\nposition; there are many other reasons but they are almost all\r\ndependent on this one, and so must be treated in a subordinate sense.\r\nIn her early days, England’s position served as a protection and\r\nkept intact her wealth of native Folk-music; but with the advent of\r\nthe Romans and the spread of the knowledge of her natural wealth,\r\ncame invasion after invasion. Since the first invasion, England has\r\nnever been at peace; she has either been busily engaged in repelling\r\nthe enemy from her own shores, or aiding in a conquest of some less\r\nfortunate foe. These wars and conquests not only served to cultivate\r\na militant and restless spirit, but also produced a race of fighters\r\nfrom natural inclination. Look at the warlike Angles and Saxons,\r\nnote the mixture of Romans, Normans, Dutch and Huguenots, all at\r\nthe zenith of their fighting powers, and then cease to wonder that\r\nEngland’s greatness has been in the power to fight, to govern, to make\r\nconquests, rather than to cultivate art. England, when she reached the\r\nstage of conquering rather than defending, began to give, more than\r\nto acquire, and never reached the acquisitive stage until the present\r\ntime with Elgar and the lesser lights of the new school, unless we\r\nexcept Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the realm of literature.\r\nEngland’s cathedrals are but the results of European cathedral building\r\nand the unity of Government and Church; had the Church and State always\r\nbeen separate, it is safe to say that England would have waited much\r\nlonger for her cathedrals.\r\n\r\n=The Kindred Arts=.—Literature was the only exception; and it is not\r\nnecessary to seek for a further reason than the fact that Literature,\r\nas an art, always developed before Music. Art, in painting, was in\r\nthe early days borrowed from other countries, and not until modern\r\ntimes did England acquire a national school of Painting; a noteworthy\r\nfact, for like Literature, such an art almost always precedes a\r\nnational culture of Music. But these examples of the evolution of the\r\nkindred arts of Literature and Painting are encouraging rather than\r\ndiscouraging, for, having attained a high standard in these, England\r\nmay now hope to develop a national culture of Music. In Music much\r\nthe same conditions obtained as in Literature and Painting. With the\r\nexception of one or two isolated composers, and these trained in\r\nforeign schools, England always borrowed her music; note for example,\r\nHandel, Buononcini, Mendelssohn, to quote just a few noteworthy foreign\r\ncomposers. Each race as it conquered England brought its own music. St.\r\nAugustine sang a Gregorian chant as he entered Canterbury; the Normans\r\nand the Dutch had their own music; and Italian and German music long\r\nheld the boards in England. Thus little time was spent in developing a\r\nnative music, because the frequent wars and political troubles directed\r\nthe strength into other channels than those of art; the proximity of\r\na higher culture in Europe, and the tendencies of England’s foreign\r\nrulers, enabled them to import and subsist on foreign music when they\r\nshould have been developing a native style. And finally, the isolation\r\nof England in the early days, later became an actual help to the\r\nacquirement of an alien style, because of the absolute necessity for\r\nstudents to live abroad to acquire musical learning.\r\n\r\n=Native Musical Life=.—There was a certain amount of native musical\r\nlife, but this did not tend to produce music along the conventional\r\nlines. Of Folk-music there was much, and the development, as a general\r\nrule, was aided rather than retarded by the conquests, though the\r\ncombination of Folk-music of different nationalities does not usually\r\ntend to aid its unified evolution. The only real example of noteworthy\r\nwriting, in the early polyphonic school, is the canon “Sumer is icumen\r\nin,” dated 1228, and attributed to an early English writer. There\r\nis no proof excepting the fact that the manuscript is in English,\r\nthat the canon is of English origin; neither is there proof to the\r\ncontrary. Single instances, however, do not prove the existence of an\r\noriginal school; and especially is this the case when that school, in\r\nits writings, far surpasses any other school of that period of which\r\nwe know. In spite of the fact of the English text, and that this\r\ncanon may be but one of many surviving the destruction of the English\r\nmonasteries, impartial historians believe most strongly that the canon\r\nis of French origin, reset to English words and carried to England by a\r\nstudent of the Paris school. The Paris school was at its height at this\r\ntime, and was the only school of such writing in the world; and while\r\nwe have no other example of that school equal to this canon, yet it\r\nis easier to believe it to be French than English, for England had no\r\nsuch school at all. She had musicians (like Odington), but they were\r\nall pupils of the Paris school; and even had this work been produced in\r\nEngland, it would be safer to credit it to the Paris school, for the\r\nman who wrote it would, almost of necessity, have studied there. The\r\nonly other way of accounting for it is to presume the date to be too\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to say that while this canon _may_ owe its origin to the\r\nprinciples of the Gallo-Belgic school, it stands alone as an article\r\nof historical interest to the musician. Nowhere on the Continent has a\r\nwork of equal importance of so early a date been brought to view. Mr.\r\nWm. Chappell, the English antiquarian, brought to light several other\r\nproductions of early English composers, including a hymn in English,\r\nscored for two voices, and another in Latin, for three voices. The\r\nmanuscript has been definitely attributed to the middle of the 13th\r\ncentury. There can be little doubt that when so many monasteries,\r\nwith their treasures of learning, were suppressed and their inmates\r\nscattered, in the time of Henry VIII, owing to the national change from\r\nthe Romish faith, many valuable manuscripts that would today have the\r\nutmost interest to the musical historian were destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Music: OLD ENGLISH CANON “SUMER IS ICUMEN IN.”]\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nWhether this is purely English or not matters little, for it is a fine\r\nspecimen and exemplifies Walter Odington’s rule for the construction of\r\na Roundel, cited in a former lesson. This is more than a mere roundel,\r\nhaving not only a little Inversion and much Imitation, managed in a\r\nmost ingenious manner, but also the whole canon is founded on a ground\r\nbass in two parts, themselves in canonic form. This bass consists\r\nof the regulation metrical form as seen at A and the following two\r\nmeasures, has one measure forming a connecting passage, thus bringing\r\nin the portion marked B which is the same as A only a fifth higher;\r\nthe whole forms a remarkable evidence of an early conception of the\r\nrelation of the Tonic and Dominant, hardly to be believed. This\r\nmetrical form is introduced, slightly changed and inverted, in the\r\nupper voices at A and B. The first voice states in all five melodies\r\nand the other voices follow at intervals of 4, 8, and 12 measures; in\r\nending voice number two omits part of theme V, voice number three all\r\nof it and voice number four all of V and the imitation of the metrical\r\nbass.\r\n\r\nOutside this one example, England produced little but moderately\r\ngood polyphonic music in the form of motets and madrigals, and in\r\nthe time of Gibbons and Purcell, sonatas and operas. There were also\r\nanthems, the old plain chant and much Folk-music, but nothing that\r\ncan be considered as important. The Folk-music is all that can claim\r\noriginality, and that ranks favorably with the best examples of other\r\nnations and is, indeed, in advance of that of other nations considered\r\nmore musical.\r\n\r\n=The Men of the Time=.—While English music was not, at this period,\r\nvery important, there were many composers whose names at least\r\nshould be familiar. After the passing of the bards and minstrels,\r\nthe monks controlled the composing of music until the dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries, when it passed into the hands of the schoolmen of\r\nCambridge and Oxford, where it remains today, though there are, at\r\npresent, signs of an important awakening, presaging the passing of\r\nmusical power from the hands of the conservative doctors of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge, to the present generation of younger and more talented\r\nwriters. =Walter Odington= (1180-1250) was a pupil of the Paris school\r\nand a theorist of note, writing on the Mensural System as exploited in\r\nthe French school. =Robert DeHandlo= (1326) was another theoretician\r\nwho wrote on the same subject. =John Dunstable= (1400-1458) was\r\ncontemporaneous with the men of the Gallo-Belgic school and did the\r\nsame for English music in reforming it as the latter did for the\r\nforeign school. In recent years examples of his writings have been\r\nunearthed in the cathedral libraries of Trent and Bologna, as well\r\nas elsewhere, making it clear that in his lifetime he was regarded\r\nas one of the foremost composers of Europe. The theorist, Tinctoris,\r\nof the Netherlands school, considered in the next lesson, speaks of\r\nthe “source and origin of the new art [Counterpoint] being among the\r\nEnglish, the foremost of whom is John Dunstable.” A contemporary\r\nwho was also well-known in Italy was John Hothby, who wrote several\r\ntreatises on music. There were other musicians of prominence prior to\r\nthe Reformation under Henry VIII, but we know little about them save\r\ntheir names. =John Merbecke= (1515-1585) adapted the Gregorian chant\r\nto the English prayer book, which was published in 1550. =Christopher\r\nTye= (1515-1580) was a teacher and wrote much church music; so also was\r\n=Thomas Tallis= (1515-1585), one of the most learned composers of his\r\ntime, who set the choral portions in the service to music. He is noted\r\nfor a celebrated canon in forty parts and for a hymn-tune, known as\r\n“Tallis” or “Evening Hymn,” which contains a canon between the soprano\r\nand tenor parts. =William Byrd= (1538-1623) was another noted composer\r\nof this school, being also famous as a writer of instrumental music.\r\nQueen Elizabeth granted to Tallis and Byrd the exclusive right to print\r\nmusic and to rule music paper. =Orlando Gibbons= (1583-1625) wrote\r\nmotets and madrigals and is known as a writer of both polyphonic and\r\nmonophonic music. =Henry Purcell= (1658-1695) was the greatest composer\r\nof the English Polyphonic school, writing operas in the English and\r\nItalian style, songs, sonatas, motets and anthems. He seems to have\r\nbeen in many respects a very able writer and musician, but died too\r\nyoung to make any decided impression on his times.\r\n\r\n=Summary=.—From this it will be seen that while England had a musical\r\npeople composed of a mixture of the most musical peoples of Europe, yet\r\nbecause of geographical position, political disturbances, religious\r\ntroubles and wars, she was never able to produce a great and commanding\r\nschool. She did not lack force, but it was directed into other, and\r\nfor the time being, more important channels. Almost everything of\r\nan artistic nature was borrowed, or was a transplanted culture; and\r\nwhile the art of music never lacked men to cultivate it, yet these men\r\nwere not of the calibre of the men employed in the other works of the\r\nnation, so that so far as the Polyphonic period is concerned, England\r\nis not important, and but for such men as Dunstable and Purcell and\r\nthe canon “Sumer Is Icumen In,” England might be completely ignored in\r\nrespect to her influence on polyphonic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nCrowest.—The Story of British Music.

Possessing the natural outlet to a\r\ngreat part of Europe, it was reasonable that the Netherlands should\r\nplay an important part in the Hanseatic League, and that her fleets\r\nshould trade on every sea and her coffers be enriched by barter in\r\nthe produce of every clime. It was a golden age for the Lowlands,\r\nfrom 1350 to 1625, for their trade made them one of the wealthiest\r\nand most important nations in the world. Their situation between\r\nthe trading countries of the South and the North made them, as it\r\nwere, the commercial exchange of Europe. The consequent wealth could\r\nnot lie dormant, therefore much of it was used in building notable\r\narchitectural structures, encouraging Painting, and developing the then\r\ninfant art of Music. It is unnecessary to mention the famous structures\r\nwhich were the result of this period, and it is but necessary to name\r\nHubert Van Eyck, Rubens, Van Dyck, to understand the prominence given\r\nto the art of Painting by the acquisition of this enormous wealth. And\r\nit is largely due to this commercial activity that the school of the\r\nNetherlands attained such an undying fame.\r\n\r\nOne other influence, and that dependent on commercial activity,\r\nproduced great results. Art is not sectional, it is universal;\r\nand great art works are produced not by local influences but by\r\nassociation, or contact, with the world. For this reason, the\r\nintercourse with the entire world generated by the great commercial\r\nactivity of the times produced the first great world School of Music.\r\nIntercourse developed emotion and produced broader and less localized\r\nview-points of life: it brought into close association the art life of\r\ndifferent nations and infused a unity of emotion wherever it occurred.\r\nIn short, Music, by being brought into contact with the ideas of the\r\nworld instead of a local association, took on a universal form and\r\nfeeling never before felt and never to be relinquished. For this\r\nreason, Music unconsciously advanced from Paris to the Netherlands,\r\ntoward the greater sphere of influence, stopping for only a short\r\nperiod with the Gallo-Belgic school, where it was prepared technically\r\nfor its new growth as a world form.\r\n\r\n=The Gallo-Belgic and the Netherlands Schools Compared=.—The\r\nGallo-Belgic school, in the control of churchmen, was isolated from\r\nany influence tending to develop a broad emotional scheme. And it is\r\ndoubtful whether it could have caused any change in musical evolution,\r\nfor the technical forms were not ready. And so the Gallo-Belgic school,\r\nin its retirement from the great world activities, confined itself to\r\nattaining the power to manipulate notes, for the sake of mere technical\r\neffects, leaving emotional development entirely out of consideration.\r\nWith such a school, while its work was important, no real art feeling\r\ncould be gained; and so the school of the Netherlands marks the\r\ndeparture into a new romantic school governed, to a great extent, by\r\nthe emotional. The Netherlands, because of their more comprehensive\r\nview of the musical activities of the past and their constant\r\nintercourse, commercially and artistically, with all nations, acquired\r\na more human sense of the beauty of music, and ceased to manipulate\r\nmusical material for technical ends, producing instead of cold,\r\nlifeless forms, music pulsing with vigor, life and emotion. With this\r\nprimary change of view-point came a direct growth of form, the Canon\r\nbeing perfected and immediately giving birth to the Fugue; the Madrigal\r\nand Canzona and many other lesser forms sprang into being, all capable\r\nof emotional development, and almost immediately producing great\r\nresults. For the first time music was free from consecutive fourths,\r\nfifths and octaves because composers created from the standpoint of\r\nemotional beauty and not that of technical utility. The result was a\r\nmusical technic capable of development, and refined beyond need of\r\nfurther reformation.\r\n\r\n=The Organ and its Influence=.—The organ was the third great\r\nreformative power in this epoch. All music was vocal and no other\r\nconception could be had, for effective instruments and instrumental\r\nmusic were not yet in existence. The organ, because its tones were\r\nsuited to accompanying the human voice and because its tone color was\r\nclosely identical with that of the voice, was readily adapted to the\r\nvocal forms then in use. This gave a greater resource, for what was\r\noften technically impossible with the human voice became easy with\r\nthe organ. The mechanical improvement of this instrument immediately\r\ngave greater freedom and range of technic, and it proved so well\r\nsuited to polyphonic development that it aided the evolution more than\r\nany other one agency. The use of the organ must not be accounted as\r\nthe beginning of instrumental music, for the organ used only adapted\r\nvoice-forms, such as the Canon, Fugue, Madrigal, etc.; for this reason\r\nit is to be doubted if it aided in emotional development except by\r\nmaking technical resources much less restricted. In this sense, then,\r\nthe technic of this school was freed from most of its former rules, and\r\nMusic, previously cramped by narrow vocal restrictions, passed into the\r\ncomparative freedom of the polyphonic style of the organ.\r\n\r\n=The Men of this School= are hardly to be separated from the men of the\r\nGallo-Belgic school. The work passes from one school to the next with\r\nlittle or no perceptible pause, and the first men of the later school\r\nare pupils or disciples of the last men of the Gallo-Belgic period.\r\nAnother noteworthy fact is, that so great was the musical growth,\r\nof this school and the skill and learning of its followers that the\r\ncomposers of the Netherlands expatriated themselves and settled in all\r\nparts of Europe, founding famous schools in Paris, Madrid, Naples,\r\nVenice, Munich and Rome; the celebrated _Italian school_ is really an\r\n_offshoot_ of that of the _Netherlands_. It is this overflow which\r\nmarks this school as the greatest of the early polyphonic schools\r\nand shows why and how it acquired its emotional supremacy. =Jean de\r\nOkeghem= (1430-1512), pupil of Binchois, was the first prominent\r\nworker. It is difficult to class him as a composer of the Belgian or\r\nNetherlands school, for he has the earmarks of both. He lived during\r\nthe supremacy of the Netherlands, but worked with the material of the\r\nBelgians. He developed the Canon to its highest technical point and\r\ntook the first step toward the originating of the Fugue. To him is due\r\nthe credit of introducing the use of retrograde, inverted, diminished\r\nand augmented imitation in the Canon. Much of his work was done in\r\nFrance. The tendency of his teaching was toward artificiality, as he\r\ndelighted in puzzle canons and other exhibitions of ingenuity.\r\n\r\n=Antonius Brumel= (1460-1520), a pupil of Okeghem, is noteworthy\r\nbecause of a foreshadowing of the use of chords in real harmonic\r\nprogressions.\r\n\r\n[Music: 8ve lower]\r\n\r\nPart of a motet by Brumel, Naumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page\r\n333, used to illustrate the idea of the harmonic feeling of some of\r\nthe polyphonic writers. The rest of the composition is strictly in the\r\npolyphonic style.\r\n\r\n=Jakob Hobrecht= (1430-1506) was the first real Dutch composer, and is\r\nnoted, in his use of technical forms, for their emotional beauty rather\r\nthan mechanical excellence.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nPart of a composition by Hobrecht, cited by Naumann, “History of\r\nMusic,” Vol. I, page 331. Excerpt shows how strictly even this fragment\r\nis written and yet how musical it is. At 1 is shown a figure in the\r\nbass repeated in imitation a step higher at 2. At A is shown a melody\r\nimitated at B in augmentation and with altered rhythm. The student\r\nshould refer to Naumann.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a remarkable work for that period, and shows that even\r\nthen composers were beginning to observe the emotional power of chord\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n=Johann Tinctor= (1446-1511), a disciple of Okeghem, worked in Rome\r\nand Naples, and will be considered with the Italian school. =Josquin\r\nde Pres= (1450-1521), also a disciple of Okeghem, worked in Rome and\r\nParis, and must also be considered as one of the Italian school. It\r\nmay be here mentioned that he was one of the first to use music as a\r\nvehicle for expressing human emotions rather than technical power. He\r\nsummed up in himself all the harmonic science of the 15th century. He\r\nwas renowned through all Europe as a composer, and if his music seems\r\nto us somewhat dry and pedantic there is abundant testimony to the deep\r\nimpression it made upon his contemporaries, which is a test of its\r\npower to excite and to express emotion. Compared with the works of his\r\npredecessors and even the majority of his contemporaries, Josquin’s\r\nwritings show freedom from the bonds of the old scholasticism, greater\r\nsimplicity and esthetic beauty. Among those of his works that have come\r\nto us is a _Miserere_ for five voices, and an _Ave Maria_ that cannot\r\nbe considered other than lovely music. =Nicholas Gombert= (1495-1570),\r\na pupil of Josquin de Pres, had a natural, tuneful and flowing style\r\nsimilar to that afterwards shown by Palestrina. His work was done in\r\nMadrid, and to him Spain and Portugal owe all they have of the ancient\r\npolyphonic music. =Jacob Arkadelt= (1492-1570) and =Claude Goudimel=\r\n(1510-1572) worked in Rome, =Adrian Willaert= (1480-1562) and =Cyprian\r\nde Rore= (1516-1565) in Venice, and will be considered with the Italian\r\nschool. =Orlando di Lasso= (1520-1594) worked some in Italy, but mostly\r\nin Munich, where his influence was great. His style was broad, flowing\r\nand especially emotional, and as a writer of the Netherlands school his\r\nname stands as one of the very highest. =J. P. Sweelinck= (1562-1621)\r\nis the last, and while of the Netherlands, studied in Venice, but did\r\nhis work at home. He was a great organist and the last great master\r\nof the school, and had the honor of being the link between it and the\r\nGerman school, serving as an example for Sebastian Bach. His works have\r\nrecently been published in Germany. Of all these men it may be said\r\nthat they developed music steadily toward the goal of emotional freedom.\r\n\r\n=Summary=.—The great work of this school was to make _technic\r\nsubservient to thought_. In all preceding schools, the material and\r\nthe forms were so new and the methods of handling them so crude,\r\nthat technic always dominated thought. And it was naturally so, for\r\nexpression cannot come until the power to master the material has been\r\nattained; it was by this power that the Netherlands developed emotional\r\nmusic. But the student invariably objects and says he does not see any\r\nemotion in the polyphonic music of this period! The student must place\r\nhimself in the position of these old masters, supported by the church\r\nand constantly imbibing the religious atmosphere of the institution\r\nthey served, until they unconsciously expressed, in their music, the\r\ngrandeur and power of their religion rather than the intimate personal\r\nfeeling of modern musicians; and then the student will understand\r\nwhat is meant by polyphonic emotion. We must always remember that\r\n_polyphonic emotion is not monophonic emotion_, and that its tremendous\r\ntechnic and complexity of device were but the means of expressing\r\nits peculiar form of emotion, which to understand, one must study\r\ndiligently, and then approach with a reverent feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article on Schools of\r\nComposition, relating to the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nSmith.—Music; How it Came to be What it Is.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapters IV and V.\r\n\r\nLanghans.—History of Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhy did the Netherlands become the musical centre?\r\n\r\nHow did geographical situation favor the Netherlands in the struggle\r\nfor commercial supremacy?\r\n\r\nWhat circumstances gave their art a general rather than sectional\r\ncharacter?\r\n\r\nCompare the Gallo-Belgic and the Netherlands schools.\r\n\r\nHow did the Organ aid in development?\r\n\r\nWho are the most famous members of this school of composition?\r\n\r\nWhat are the special characteristics of each?\r\n\r\nWhat is a _Miserere_?\r\n\r\nWhat is an _Ave Maria_?\r\n\r\nWhat was the Hanseatic League?\r\n\r\nWhat was the contribution of the Netherlands school?\r\n\r\nConsult a general history for the events which made the Netherlands so\r\nimportant at this time.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a historical epoch to accompany the period of the\r\nNetherlands school and its successor, the Italian school, the central\r\nfigure that will be most familiar is Christopher Columbus, whose life\r\nand work covered the early period, the close of the old polyphonic\r\nschool dating with Palestrina’s death in 1594, 100 years after the\r\ndiscovery of America. This hundred years represents the flowering time\r\nof polyphony as an art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XIII.\r\n\r\n                          THE ITALIAN SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Italy the New Centre=.—Music developed in the Netherlands because of\r\ncommercial supremacy and the consequent world association. We shall now\r\nsee it pass to Italy, but because of a very different reason. From the\r\nearliest Christian days Italy was the centre of religious influence;\r\nit is only necessary to examine history to observe the ramifications\r\nof that power in England, France, Germany, the Netherlands and other\r\ncountries. This influence, often more political than religious in\r\ncharacter, gave to the Italian Church (then the Italian State), a\r\npredominance of authority, which was a great power in religious and\r\nsecular thought. This influence spread to music for various reasons. We\r\nmust remember that the school at Paris was controlled by the Church,\r\nthat the Gallo-Belgic school owed its foundation to the same cause,\r\nand that the men of all three schools were employed as organists by\r\nthe Church. It is true that in Italy the Church had not the broadening\r\ninfluence of commercial intercourse, but was more than compensated for\r\nthat lack by what we may call artistic intercourse. The Church was\r\nthe one stable institution in these times of war in which painters\r\ncould find a refuge for their works, and from which patronage flowed\r\nin a steady stream to the ever-needy artists. Thus was caused and\r\nmaintained the artistic atmosphere necessary to the cultivation of\r\nMusic. As an art, the Church was the only support of artistic music.\r\nWhen Music originated it needed an institution to protect and foster it\r\nand safeguard its growth, and this it found in the Church; it repaid\r\nthis protection by evolving a style eminently suited to the needs of\r\nthe Church, but absolutely useless for the expression of secular and\r\nnatural emotion. To this patronage of its peculiar art is due the\r\nimportation into Italy of the best in music wherever found, to aid in\r\nthese services. And so we find singers from the Netherlands engaged\r\nfor the Church in Italy. This, and the fame of Italy as the home of\r\nsuperior singers, undoubtedly led the majority of those numerous\r\nNetherlandish masters to seek their homes abroad, and preferably in\r\nItaly. The fact that all music was vocal in style and that the Church\r\nwas the only institution capable of supporting such a style, cannot be\r\ntoo strongly stated; for upon that depended not only the evolution of\r\nMusic, but also the very life of the Polyphonic emotional style.\r\n\r\n=Emotion in Polyphony=.—This style is worthy of examination. As\r\na preface we must remember that we have to deal with the Church\r\nand _human voices only_, for instruments had not been perfected\r\nsufficiently for church use, excepting the organ, and that we must\r\nconsider a voice because of its peculiar tonal qualities and the\r\nadaptation of vocal forms and styles to its use. This vocal style\r\nhad developed gradually, through a long course of reforms, until it\r\nreached its perfection in the later polyphonic schools, and expressed\r\nthe peculiar emotion suited for the services. _Lack_ of _rhythm_\r\nwas a pointed _characteristic_; for, in the first place, it had\r\nbeen discarded as profane, and in the next place, a long course of\r\ntreatment in the management of voices to avoid anything like concerted\r\nand accentuated dissonances had produced a peculiar flowing movement\r\nwhich, however smooth it might be, certainly possessed no rhythmic\r\nforce. Then, too, the old scale forms caused anything written in\r\ntheir idioms to sound grave, severe and dignified, if not harsh. The\r\ntransition to the modern major and minor in the Monophonic school of\r\n1600 and the immediate cultivation of music by the people may be taken\r\nas an example of the musical qualities of the two modes. All of these\r\ncauses tended to produce a suitable form of music and an emotional\r\nexpression peculiarly suited to the Roman services. In this style\r\nthere was little storm and stress, little of the personal appeal to\r\nGod; on the other hand, it was grave, severe and immovable, or in a\r\nbetter sense, impersonal in its expression. Music of the polyphonic\r\nperiod, even until the time of Sebastian Bach, in whose works it is\r\nwell exemplified, does not show us the appeal to God from the heart of\r\nthe active Christian worker, but rather the appeal to a vast impersonal\r\nand majestic God far removed from the needs and supplications of the\r\nmere individual. It was this kind of emotion that developed in the\r\nItalian Polyphonic schools. The human and more expressive emotion of\r\nthe schools of the Netherlands was transmitted, in the schools of the\r\nItalian, into the high, contemplative moods of religious expression;\r\nand it was well that it should be so, for polyphonic music could\r\nnever have expressed the emotion of a Beethoven; and it was not only\r\nbest that it should express its own peculiar style of emotion, but\r\ninevitable that it should do so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORLANDO DI LASSO.]\r\n\r\n=Schools Outside Italy=.—The overflow from the Netherlands concentrated\r\nits efforts on certain points or school centres. In Italy, these were\r\nNaples, Venice and Rome. There were others throughout Europe, such\r\nas Madrid, Paris and Munich, which we must consider first because of\r\ntheir relation to Italy. =Nicholas Gombert= (1495-1570) influenced the\r\npolyphonic development in Madrid, but so isolated was the work that\r\nnothing great resulted. =Okeghem= (1430-1512) worked longer in Paris\r\nthan other masters, though several lived there for short intervals,\r\nsuch as Arkadelt and Goudimel. =Orlando di Lasso= (1520-1594) did\r\nalmost all his work in Munich and established the most important school\r\noutside of Italy. He was a most prolific writer and can be compared\r\nin ability and style to Palestrina. His style was broad and bold and\r\ncontained much of that serious and earnest character now attributed to\r\nhis Teutonic associations. He wrote in all known forms and was well\r\nnigh universal in his knowledge of form, technic and expression. His\r\nfacility in the art of writing was very great and was fully equalled by\r\nhis love for work. Although his work has somewhat less perfection than\r\nthat of his great contemporary, Palestrina, it has astonishing power\r\nof expression. It shows the force of his genius that he was able to\r\nmake his works in the strict contrapuntal forms full of real feeling.\r\nHe was a man of interesting personal character. The most famous of his\r\nworks is his setting of seven “Penitential Psalms,” containing a number\r\nof most curious effects for unaccompanied voices, with much that is\r\nsingularly characteristic and beautiful, and showing well the character\r\nof his genius.\r\n\r\nWe give part of a composition by di Lasso showing his broad style and\r\nthe increasing use of what sounds suspiciously like our modern chord\r\nprogressions. The lack of rhythmic effect and the holding over of notes\r\npast the accented beat is shown in this exercise. The whole example,\r\nwith words, may be found in Naumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page\r\n387.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=The Italian School=.—But it is with the Italian schools that we are\r\nmost concerned. The school at Naples had as its principal master\r\n=Johannes Tinctoris= (1446-1511) a Fleming by birth, a doctor of laws\r\nand a mathematician, one of those peculiar combinations seldom noticed\r\nafter the Paris school, and almost sure to mark the theoretician.\r\nHis work was principally theoretical and his treatises are of great\r\nvalue. =Adrian Willaert= (1480-1562), born at Bruges, was a pupil of\r\nJean Mouton, at Paris. After visiting Rome and Ferrara, he settled in\r\nVenice and, as organist of St. Mark’s, founded an important school.\r\nHe introduced the use of large double choruses which caused him to\r\nwrite harmonically rather than polyphonically. This influence caused\r\nhim to relegate the imitative polyphonic part writing to smaller forms\r\n(motets, etc.) and to write plain chord progressions in his larger\r\nworks; and before long he began to observe and to use the relationship\r\nbetween the Tonic and the Dominant. This tendency and the invention\r\nof the Madrigal furnished the basis for a new instrumental school at\r\na later date. His best-known pupil, =Cipriano di Rore= (1516-1565),\r\nwas short-lived, and worked in both Venice and Parma. He made some\r\ninvestigation into the use of chromatics, thus showing the growing\r\ntendency to abandon the Church modes for the natural scales. Following\r\nthese Dutch masters came the two Gabrieli’s, who were native Italians.\r\n=Andrea Gabrieli= (1510-1586) was a great organist and wrote in the\r\nstyle of Willaert, his famous master. =Giovanni Gabrieli= (1557-1613)\r\nwas a pupil of his uncle Andrea, and carried the latter’s methods\r\nfurther toward perfection. He also wrote for instruments in conjunction\r\nwith voices, abandoning to a certain extent the _a capella_ style, and\r\nopening that epoch of instrumental music foreshadowed by Willaert in\r\nhis madrigals. Rome was the centre of church government, of church art\r\nand also of church music, and as such, had the largest and greatest of\r\nItalian music schools. =Jacob Arkadelt= (1492-1570), a Netherlander,\r\nlived nineteen years in Rome and did most of his work there; he wrote\r\nboth secular and sacred compositions in the strict polyphonic style,\r\nand in that of Willaert. =Claude Goudimel= (1510-1572), though a\r\nprominent master in Paris, worked much in Rome and was the teacher of\r\nPalestrina. He set to music in four parts metrical versions of the\r\nPsalms, published in 1565. In him is to be observed that clearness of\r\nexpression and beauty of melodic flow with which Palestrina attained\r\nsuch a high point of expression.\r\n\r\n=Palestrina=.—It remained for his pupil =Palestrina=, (Giovanni\r\nPierlugi Sante, 1514-1594) an Italian, to reach the highest point of\r\nemotional expression and technical freedom; we must, however, rank\r\nOrlando di Lasso with him. He carried to the highest fruition the\r\nteachings of the Netherlands, tempered by the romantic and melodic\r\ntendency of the Italian nature. His writings were so free technically\r\nthat they have been called simple in form; this they are, but the\r\nsimplicity is the simplicity of genius. His style is melodic, and has\r\na clearness never attained by any writer before his time, and yet his\r\nmusic is written in the most severe forms. He founded a school of\r\nmusic in Rome which, however, never produced any great masters, for\r\nit was the time when the reformation of Opera began and carried the\r\ndevelopment of music into other channels.\r\n\r\n[Music: SOP. ALTO TENOR BASS]\r\n\r\nThe end of a composition by Palestrina, showing the melody in the upper\r\nvoice instead of the tenor, as was usually the case in polyphonic\r\ncompositions, and the use of our modern Minor mode. This composition,\r\nat least this last part of it taken alone, might be by a modern writer,\r\nso familiar do its progressions sound; indeed, the melody of the first\r\ntwo measures is strikingly similar to a progression used by Beethoven\r\nin one of his string quartets. The entire example with words may be\r\nseen in Naumann, History of Music, Vol. I, page 510.\r\n\r\n=Summary=.—The Polyphonic Era has many important characteristics and\r\nresults which make it worth while to sum it up. Its development is\r\nlargely the history of the _development of vocal music_ to its highest\r\npoint, and the consequent failure of it to provide accurate expression\r\nfor human needs. It marks the development of scales, intervals, forms,\r\ninstruments and emotion. In scales we find the trend to be always\r\ntoward the natural; in intervals, toward freedom, using only the ear as\r\na criterion; in instruments we note the development of the organ, but\r\nthe lack of others which would have changed music entirely; in emotion,\r\nwe note the evolution from crudeness to the highest and most polished\r\nforms of impersonal expression. The lack of the Polyphonic school\r\nwas not in the intrinsic value of the music, nor in any lack of the\r\ndesire to express emotion; the failure to provide a suitable means of\r\nmusical expression was due to the idea of church relation to God rather\r\nthan to the personal individualistic relations established by Luther.\r\n_After the Reformation_ music takes up this new idea and immediately\r\na _secular music_, vocal and instrumental, begins to _develop_,\r\nculminating in an emotional school of a totally different and truer\r\nstyle than the Polyphonic. Polyphonic music expressed the old monkish\r\nideas of religion perfectly, but monophonic music expresses the emotion\r\nof the people, a universal emotion. Polyphonic music must always be\r\nappreciated for its value, but it must be examined for its fundamental\r\nprinciples and reasons for being, before it can be understood. Then we\r\nmay know its value as a foundation for our modern music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article on Schools of\r\nComposition, section relating to Italy.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nLanghans.—History of Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhy did the centre of music shift to Italy?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of emotion is present in the polyphonic style of music?\r\n\r\nWhat composers were prominent outside of Italy?\r\n\r\nName the prominent composers of the Italian school.\r\n\r\nSum up the Polyphonic Era.\r\n\r\nConsult a history of art and give an account of the great painters,\r\nsculptors, architects and their greatest works during the century\r\npreceding the development of the Italian school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XIV.\r\n\r\n              PALESTRINA AND HIS INFLUENCE ON THE MUSIC OF\r\n                   THE ITALIAN SCHOOL. THE MADRIGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALESTRINA.]\r\n\r\n=A Church Composer=.—But one master of the Italian Polyphonic schools\r\nis worthy of lengthy notice, more because of his influence on the\r\nmusic of the Church than his contribution to the new instrumental\r\nschool then only in its infancy. Palestrina, while acquainted with\r\nGalilei, the reformer of Opera, and Neri, the originator of Oratorio,\r\nand with many of the men identified with the new style of vocal and\r\ninstrumental music, gave his entire life to the composing of Church\r\nmusic, though in his poverty-stricken condition musical work under\r\nwealthy patronage must have often appealed to him. At any rate, the\r\nfarthest he ever strayed from the Church was in the composing of many\r\nmadrigals, in which he excelled; it is almost certain that in these\r\nhe unintentionally influenced the development of instrumental music.\r\nFor the present, however, a consideration of his life and influence on\r\nChurch music is more important. But for him, Church music would have\r\nlacked for at least a century that simple and individual note so often\r\nstruck by himself and Bach. Palestrina, by the enormous number of his\r\nmasses and by the fertility of his invention, placed the music of the\r\nLatin Church on so high a plane that no composers, at least until the\r\ntime of Bach, even approached him, much less equalled him.\r\n\r\n=Giovanni Pierluigi Sante=, known as Palestrina, after his birthplace,\r\nwas born in 1514 at Palestrina, a small town southeast of Rome. His\r\nparents were peasants and the boy received but the ordinary education\r\nof his class. While very young he seems to have become a choir-boy at\r\nRome, though it is recorded that his voice was anything but pleasing.\r\nUpon this supposition rests the statement that he was, for a short\r\ntime, a pupil of Arkadelt; this is unimportant because eventually\r\n(1540) he became a pupil of Goudimel, whose influence far overshadowed\r\nthat of any former teacher. In 1548 he married and four sons were the\r\nresult of the union, three, however, dying at an early age and the\r\nfourth proving, in after-life, a worthless fellow. In 1551 he succeeded\r\nArkadelt as choir-master of St. Peter’s; later the dedication of three\r\nmasses to Pope Julian III won him a position as singer in the Papal\r\nChoir. Owing to the jealousy of the other singers he finally lost his\r\nposition, but received an appointment at the Church of _Santa Maria\r\nMaggiore_ where he stayed for ten years. Naumann says that in 1565 he\r\nreceived the appointment of master of the Sistine Chapel, but never\r\noccupied the position because of the opposition among the choir. Grove,\r\nhowever, says that in 1565 he was made composer to the Pontifical\r\nChoir and did not become master until 1585, holding the position from\r\nthat time on. In 1571 he was again connected with St. Peter’s; this\r\nalso marks his acquaintance with Neri, for whom he wrote some music,\r\nand the founding of a music school, though it cannot have amounted\r\nto much since most authorities give no particulars in regard to it.\r\nIndeed, it is certain that he cannot have had much influence in that\r\nline, for his pupils, outside of his own family, did not amount to more\r\nthan a scant half-dozen. In 1576 he was given the task of revising the\r\nGradual and Antiphonary of the Latin Church but, with the assistance\r\nof a pupil, finished only a little more than one-half of the work. He\r\ndied in 1594 and was buried in the Vatican. His life is marked by the\r\nusual jealousies and quarrels of musicians, though Palestrina himself\r\nseems to have been nobleminded and more than reasonably free from all\r\nsuch faults. He was in poor circumstances during his life, and his only\r\nliving son was a bitter disappointment. Altogether, as we examine his\r\nlife we are impressed by many things; first, his apparent failure from\r\na worldly point of view; secondly, the enormous amount of composing\r\nwhich he did; and, finally, his devotion to the Church and her music,\r\nand because of it, his glorious success as a musician, and his undying\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n=Reform of Church Music=.—The year marking the climax of his life was\r\n1565. The Council of Trent, by a unanimous vote, decided to prohibit\r\nthe use of music in the Church unless some means could be devised to\r\nmake it more devotional and suited to its purpose. Naumann says that\r\nit was the desire of the Council of Trent to simplify the music so\r\nthat the people might take part in the services; but Grove claims that\r\nit was because of the use of secular music in the composition of the\r\nmasses. It seems that it was customary, for part of the singers at\r\nleast, to sing in services not only the _melodies of_ the _popular\r\nsongs_, but _also_ the _words_, thus producing confusion and defeating\r\nthe very purpose of the music. In all probability, both of these\r\nreasons had something to do with the edict. It is plain that the\r\nfundamental principle at stake was the lack of the personal devotional\r\nnote (which caused this action by the Council of Trent), and it was the\r\nsupplying of this want that made Palestrina the saviour of music in\r\nthe Church. A committee of Cardinals was appointed to see if proper\r\nmusic for the service could be found. They commissioned Palestrina to\r\nwrite a mass and submit it for trial. When the trial came, at the home\r\nof Cardinal Vitellozzi, Palestrina submitted three masses, the last of\r\nwhich was the best; this he afterwards called the “Missa Papæ Marcelli.”\r\n\r\n=Palestrina’s Style=.—In these masses Palestrina had succeeded so\r\nwell in subordinating technic to expression, and in eliminating all\r\nextraneous matter, that he was hailed as the greatest musician of\r\nthe Church, and honors were showered upon him. From this it would be\r\nsupposed that Palestrina had shown an entire change in style, yet this\r\nwas not the case. Goudimel, his master, shows traces of the so-called\r\nPalestrina style, and Palestrina himself was gradually growing into\r\nthat simplicity which marked the music of his later days. This\r\nsimplicity was not only simplicity of emotion but also simplicity of\r\ntechnic; only a man with a most consummate skill could have written\r\nsuch great music with such little use of showy technic. Palestrina\r\nwrote in all of the polyphonic forms, complex and simple, but he\r\nreached his highest point in his most simple works; and those works\r\nwere written for his Church.\r\n\r\n=Secular Art Song=.—The secular life of the 15th and 16th centuries, as\r\nwell as the Church, had an art music, which, like the other music of\r\nthe period was _vocal_, not solos with accompaniments, but _choral_,\r\nconsisting of three or more parts; this we may call a species of vocal\r\nchamber music. We can trace the development of this form of musical\r\ncomposition to an application of the principle of Discant to secular\r\nor Folk-melodies. The minstrels, as mentioned in a previous lesson,\r\nwere accustomed to improvise accompanying parts to a familiar song—a\r\nfavorite custom was that of adding two parts—for the entertainment\r\nof their hearers. This process was not a haphazard one, but followed\r\nfixed rules. The absence of a simple system of notation, however,\r\nprevented the accumulation of musical records. And when minstrelsy\r\nceased to exist as a calling, only the memory of the crude attempts of\r\nthe minstrels remained. But the principle was not lost. Fortunately\r\nfor the good of the art, the trained musicians of the Church took it\r\nup, and, calling to their aid the resources of their art as used in the\r\nmusic of the Church, applied them all to secular melodies, the songs of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n=The Predecessors of the Madrigal=.—Several of the forms of secular\r\nmusic found in Italy, the Frottole (song of the mass or crowd), and the\r\nVilanelle (village or peasant songs), were used in a crude way by the\r\nmusicians of the people as airs to which to add accompanying parts.\r\nBoth Germans and English made similar use of their folk melodies. But\r\nsince the text was usually of a humorous, or a witty character, the\r\naccompanying melodies or “_counterpoints_” were simple in style. The\r\nwork of the trained composers along this line resulted in the Madrigal,\r\nwhich shows a union of the musical spirit of the people with the finest\r\npoetic art; the melodies had the style of the popular music, but they\r\nwere used with technical skill.\r\n\r\n=The Madrigal=.—The text of the madrigal was erotic in character,\r\nrepresenting the emotions of a heart filled with noble, often hopeless\r\nlove. The Italian poets Tasso and Petrarch were masters in this style\r\nof writing. The name Madrigal was first applied to this kind of\r\nlyric, and afterward became identified with the music itself. There\r\nis disagreement as to the origin of the name, the common explanation\r\nbeing that it comes from the word _mandra_, a sheepfold, _mandriale_,\r\nshepherd, in allusion to the frequent pastoral character of the text.\r\nThe Madrigal undoubtedly owes its origin to the composers of the\r\nFlemish school. The musicians of the Netherlands, in the middle of the\r\n15th century, had a polyphonic song, elaborate in construction, in the\r\nold Church modes, modeled doubtless on the plan of the Motet, but using\r\nthe melody of some popular song as a _Cantus Firmus_. When the centre\r\nof musical power was transferred to Italy, the madrigal principle came\r\ninto new hands, those of the composers of the Venetian school, who gave\r\nit the character which made it so popular.\r\n\r\n=The Italian School=.—The first great composer in this style was Adrian\r\nWillaert. After him came Arkadelt, who published several books of\r\nmadrigals. The most famous composer of madrigals was =Luca Marenzio=\r\n(1560-1599), called by his contemporaries “the sweetest swan of Italy,”\r\nwhose works attained extraordinary vogue. They are extremely melodious.\r\nA composer who made considerable use of the chromatic element was\r\n=Gesualdo=, Prince of Venusia (1560-1614). Other Italian composers of\r\nmadrigals are Festa, Palestrina, Anerio, Waelrant, Orlando di Lasso,\r\nCipriano di Rore, Vecchi and Gastoldi, the latter being credited with\r\nthe introduction of the “Fa, la.”\r\n\r\n=The English School=.—The Madrigal never displaced the Folk-song in\r\nGermany or the _Chanson_ in France, but it found a home in England, in\r\nwhich country a number of composers were developed whose best work is\r\nconsidered to be superior to that of their Italian predecessors. The\r\nperiod of fifty years, beginning with 1588, when the first collection\r\nof madrigals was published in London, is called the Madrigalian Era.\r\nThe composers of prominence are: William Byrd, Thomas Morley, Thomas\r\nWeelkes, John Dowland, John Wilbye, Orlando Gibbons and Richard\r\nEdwardes. So great was the interest in this class of music that it was\r\nconsidered a necessary part of the education of a gentleman that he\r\nshould be able to sing, when requested, a part in a madrigal, as we\r\nlearn from a work or music study published by Thomas Morley in 1597.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the Madrigal=.—The best means of securing an\r\nunderstanding of the Madrigal style is to study good examples, and,\r\nif possible, to hear them sung by a good choral organization. They\r\nare written in three, four, five and six parts, the five part being\r\nthe one most favored. The principle of construction is _polyphonic_,\r\nimitation being freely used, cross accents being frequent on account of\r\nthe syncopated style, each part being conceived as melody, not as the\r\nresult of the movement of successive chords.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Madrigal=.—The great number of madrigals written\r\nby so many composers may be taken as an indication of the growth of\r\nmusical sensibility. The creative side developed. The composer was\r\nno longer contented with taking a melody or some theme ready made,\r\nand elaborating it or accompanying it; he _invented_ his own themes,\r\nthus opening the way to the idea that each text should have a theme to\r\nsuit its special character, a principle which rules in modern music.\r\nSince the themes thus took on greater significance, it became important\r\nthat accompanying parts should not obscure them by over-elaboration;\r\nhence the counterpoint used became clearer and simpler, and therefore\r\nmore artistic. Another fact of great significance is that frequently\r\nthe madrigals were played by viols, instead of being sung by voices.\r\nComposers marked the pieces as “Apt for viols or voices.” It was also\r\ncustomary to sing one part and play the others on instruments, the\r\ndesign being to cause the melody to stand out more clearly; this aided\r\nin developing a feeling for the solo with instrumental accompaniment, a\r\nfact of great significance in preparing the way for the opera.\r\n\r\n=Petrucci=.—Music owes a great debt to =Ottaviano Petrucci=, who is\r\ncredited with devising a method for printing music from movable type.\r\nHe was born in 1466, died in 1523 or shortly after that date. Before he\r\nbegan his great work all music was written out by hand, a fact which\r\nnecessarily interfered with its circulation; the works of the great\r\nwriters were jealously guarded and students had small chance to profit\r\nby the work of experienced composers. Petrucci and his successors\r\nchanged this. In 1501, he printed a collection of ninety-six pieces in\r\nthree and four parts by Isaac, Josquin, Hobrecht, Okeghem and others;\r\nin 1504, a collection of eighty-three motets for four, five and six\r\nvoices. By the time the composers of the Venetian Madrigal school\r\nappeared on the scene, printing processes had been improved and spread\r\nmore widely; thus their works could be circulated freely and made\r\npopular. We who know the tremendous power of the printing press can\r\nappreciate the new force in the development of music inaugurated by\r\nPetrucci in the early part of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Palestrina and\r\nthe Madrigal.\r\n\r\nDickinson.—Music in the History of the Western Church.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapter V.\r\n\r\nBarrett.—English Glee and Madrigal Writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho was the most important of the earlier composers for the Church?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of his life.\r\n\r\nWhat did he do for the music of the Church?\r\n\r\nWhat peculiarities marked his style?\r\n\r\nGive a brief résumé of the Council of Trent.

Novello & Co. publish in cheap octavo form many of\r\nthe finest madrigals by the Italian and English composers. The members\r\nof the class should sing or follow the playing of each part of at least\r\none madrigal and note its essentially melodic character. This class of\r\ncompositions will also give an idea of the character of the old Church\r\nmotet and the methods used in the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON XV.\r\n\r\n                          MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Classification of Instruments=.—The means for the production of\r\nmusical sound are few in number, and of such universality and antiquity\r\nthat we cannot say when, how, or by whom they were invented. Modern\r\nskill has not added one new means, but has simply improved the\r\ncontrivances by which musical sound is produced. We can, however, trace\r\nthe evolution and growth of the various instruments with considerable\r\naccuracy, and to this end it is of the utmost importance to have a\r\nclear understanding of the principles upon which musical instruments\r\nare constructed, in order to avoid bewilderment among the endless\r\nvariety that have been and are yet made. All instruments may be divided\r\ninto three general classes: Percussion Instruments, Wind Instruments,\r\nStringed Instruments.\r\n\r\n=The Percussion Instruments= are the instruments of rhythm. In this\r\nclass are included all instruments used for this purpose. It is\r\nuniversally admitted that rhythm is the very basis of music, without\r\nwhich it is vague and meaningless. Possibly the physical fact that lies\r\nbehind rhythm is the tendency of all repeated muscular action to become\r\nregular; witness the blows of the hammer on the anvil, or the carpenter\r\ndriving in a nail. The psychologic reason is that when the will has set\r\na certain muscular action in motion, it leaves the carrying out of the\r\ncommand to some subordinate function, so _long as it is continuous_;\r\nbut if the continuity is to be interrupted, the will must again exert\r\nitself; hence, drumbeating and rattle shaking must of necessity be\r\nrhythmic. Nearly all savages have dances of various kinds. Varieties\r\nof drum rhythms arise from the almost universal custom of accompanying\r\ndances with drums and rattles.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of Percussion Instruments=.—Percussion instruments are\r\nalmost endless in variety. The most primitive example is that of a\r\nhollow log beaten with a war-club by some prehistoric savage. The next\r\nstep leads to the hollow gourd or other hollow body, across the open\r\nend of which is stretched the dried membrane of some wild animal.\r\nFrom these descend all the long line of drums of all sorts, ending\r\nwith the modern orchestral kettle-drums (tympani) which, by means\r\nof a mechanism for changing the tension of their parchment heads,\r\nmay be tuned in various keys. Percussion instruments of metal are of\r\nvery ancient origin. In this category are included cymbals of various\r\nsizes and shapes, gongs of all sorts, and later, bells and triangles.\r\nComparatively few of the percussion instruments emit sounds of any\r\ndefinite pitch. They were and are to a great extent noise-producing,\r\nused for the purpose of marking rhythms.\r\n\r\n=Wind Instruments: Vibrating Column of Air in a Tube=.—The next step\r\nin advance of noise-producing instruments is the discovery of means\r\nfor the production of musical sound, which differs from noise in the\r\npossession of _definite pitch_. This leads to a consideration of the\r\nwind instruments that produce sound by means of a vibrating column of\r\nair enclosed in a tube. This is an important class and has several\r\nsubdivisions, as will be seen. The simplest form of the wind instrument\r\nis the plain tube, producing a single sound when blown across the top.\r\nA series of such tubes fastened together side by side constitutes the\r\n_Syrinx_ or Pan’s pipe, an instrument known over all the world from\r\nthe remotest ages. This is thought to be the instrument mentioned in\r\nGenesis with the Hebrew name _Ugab_—translated _organ_, in the verse:\r\n“Jubal was the father of all such as handle the harp or the organ.” It\r\nis generally believed by scholars that the =Pandean Pipe= or =Syrinx=\r\nis the oldest of musical instruments; but long before a sufficient\r\nadvance had been made to bind together several reeds giving different\r\nsounds, the discovery was made that sound might be produced in this\r\nway. Some prehistoric man found it out, perhaps by blowing across the\r\ntop of a hollow bone. A whistle of this kind, of prehistoric make,\r\nbored from one of the bones of a reindeer’s foot, was found in a bone\r\ncave in France. It may have been used as a signal, and we may imagine\r\nthat it may have guided a troop of palæolithic hunters in the chase of\r\nthe mammoth or rhinoceros, when these animals still roamed over the\r\nplains of Europe.\r\n\r\n=A Tube Pierced with Holes=.—The next advance was the discovery that\r\none tube could be made to give several sounds by piercing holes in\r\nit. The effect of piercing is equivalent to shortening the tube; thus\r\nthe =Flute= came into existence. There are three forms of the flute;\r\nthe simplest is the old Japanese flute, blown at the end and pierced\r\nwith a few holes. Next, the endless variety of flutes blown at a hole\r\nin the side, hence called the cross flute, or _Flauto Traverso_, in\r\nGerman, _Querflöte_. A perfect series of these flutes may be made.\r\nFrom the piece of bamboo with three or four holes, up to the exquisite\r\nworkmanship and musical possibilities of the orchestral Boehm flute,\r\nall these flutes are identical in principle. The third kind of flute\r\nis blown at the end and is furnished with a diaphragm, which directs\r\nthe air in a thin stream against the edge of the opening. Flutes of\r\nthis kind were once used under the names of =flageolet= and =recorder=.\r\nTheir chief interest lies in the fact that they have served as the\r\nmodel for the flue pipes of the organ, from the ponderous thirty-two\r\nfoot Diapason to the half-inch extreme of the Mixture.\r\n\r\n=The Tube with a Reed=.—The next subdivision is: The tube in\r\nconjunction with a tongue or slip of cane, called a reed. Reed\r\ninstruments are further divided into _single_ and _double reed_\r\ninstruments. The double reed instrument is of great antiquity and\r\nwidely known. This is the instrument generally meant by the term\r\n“flute” in the ancient Greek authors. It is known in China and\r\nThibet, and in its modern form as =Hautboy= (oboe), =English Horn=\r\nor =Bassoon=, is an important member of the modern orchestra. The\r\nbeating or single reed is so-called because it is made a little\r\nlarger than the orifice over which it is fixed, and therefore beats\r\nagainst this orifice at every vibration, closing it and causing the\r\nair to be emitted in puffs. This form of reed instrument is also\r\nwidely distributed. By the Greeks it was called the Berecynthian\r\npipe; in modern Egypt _Arghool_, in early England the Shawm, which\r\nis a corruption of an older French name—_Chalumeau_. Under the name\r\n=Clarinet= it is another important member of the orchestra. The beating\r\nreed also furnishes the model after which the reed stops of the organ\r\nare constructed.\r\n\r\n=The Tube with the Lips of the Player=.—The last subdivision is the\r\ntube in conjunction with the lip of the performer, the lips assuming\r\nthe rôle of the reed. Countless varieties of =trumpets= have been\r\nused from time immemorial, made at first from that natural tube that\r\nhas given them their generic name, the “horn” of the ox or goat or\r\nantelope. The forms of the horn are endless, but from the conch shell\r\nof the Japanese or the ram’s horn _Shofar_ of the Hebrews to the\r\nperfectly tuned and mechanically perfect instruments of our bands and\r\norchestras the series is complete, and the acoustic principle in all\r\nrespects identical.\r\n\r\n=Stringed Instruments Played by Plucking=.—The stringed instruments\r\nare those which depend for their sound upon the vibration of stretched\r\nstrings. This class of instruments is of very ancient origin. As in\r\nthe case of the wind instruments, the discovery of the principle of\r\nthe vibration of a stretched string was probably accidental. The\r\ntwanging of a bow-string suggests a possible clue, or the membranes of\r\nanimals used for any purpose in which tension is required. Earliest\r\namong stringed instruments are the various forms of =Harp= or =Lyre=,\r\nin which each string gives a single sound, and is put in motion by\r\nbeing _plucked_ by the finger or _struck_ by a rod or flat strip of\r\nwood, ivory, etc., called a _plectrum_. In the next class are included\r\nthose instruments that are furnished with a neck or fingerboard,\r\nwith or without frets. In this class the strings are comparatively\r\nfew in number, as many sounds may be obtained from each string by\r\naltering its length by the pressure of the fingers on the neck. These\r\ninstruments are also played either with the fingers or the plectrum; to\r\nthis class belong the =Guitar=, =Lute=, =Mandolin=, etc.\r\n\r\n=The Lute Family=.—For many years, until displaced by instruments of\r\nthe violin family, the =Lute= occupied the foremost position among\r\ninstruments. It was a favorite instrument in the East, whence it\r\nreached Spain and lower Italy. During the 14th century, it spread\r\nover all Europe, retaining its popularity from the 15th to the 17th\r\ncenturies. In shape it was similar to the mandolin of the present\r\nday. It had, however, a far greater number of strings. Five pairs of\r\nthese and a single melody string lay over the keyboard, while the bass\r\nstrings (finally five in number and used only as open strings) lay\r\nat the side. More elaborate forms of the lute, owing to improvements\r\nin the arrangement of the bass strings, were the =Theorbo= and the\r\n=Archilute=. For the various forms of the lute the ordinary measured\r\nnotation was not used, but _special letters_ or figures were given to\r\nindicate, not the pitch of the sound, but the _proper fret_ on the\r\nfingerboard of the instrument to be used by the player. This method of\r\nnotation was called =Tablature=; it differed somewhat in the various\r\ncountries. Until displaced by the violin, the lute was in use as an\r\norchestral instrument. In addition, transcriptions of all sorts of\r\nvocal and instrumental pieces were made for the lute, for home use,\r\nmuch in the same manner as they are at the present day made for the\r\npianoforte.\r\n\r\n=Stringed Instruments Played with a Bow=.—The next and most important\r\nclass resembles the last in being furnished with a neck or fingerboard,\r\nbut with strings put in vibration by a bow, the familiar Violin family.\r\nA German writer on the stringed instruments played with a bow gives\r\nthe following as the successive steps in the evolution of the violin:\r\nRebec, Tromba Marina, Hurdy Gurdy, Fidel (Fidula), Chrotta, Viole, and\r\nViolin. The early history of instruments is shrouded in darkness, which\r\nexisted up to the 16th century. Before that time, although writers on\r\nmusic made reference to the instruments in use, they did not give\r\ndetailed descriptions. Virdung, who published a work in 1511; Agricola,\r\nin 1528; and Gerle, in 1546, were among the first writers. Yet much\r\nconfusion has arisen from the fact that these writers used different\r\nterms for the same instruments, a difficulty that confronts the student\r\nof musical history who consults German, French, or Italian works.\r\n\r\n1. The Rebec was of Oriental origin and consisted of a wooden frame,\r\nwhich formed the side walls, the top and the bottom being spanned with\r\nskin, like a drum. The instrument had only two strings, and was used\r\nin accompanying singing. Later the number of strings was increased to\r\nthree. In the 8th or 9th century an instrument called the _Lyra_ (Lyre)\r\nwas in use. Its shape shows a change toward the pear-shaped body and\r\nnarrow neck of the lute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REBEC. LYRE (ACCORDING TO GERBERT). BASS VIOL.]\r\n\r\n2. The Tromba Marina (Eng., literally, “Marine Trumpet”), which the\r\nGermans call _Trumscheit_, had a long, sonorous body, over which a\r\nstrong string, like that of the ’cello D, was stretched. This string,\r\nwhen sounded with the bow, gave forth a harsh, somewhat nasal tone,\r\nsimilar to that of the 8-foot wooden organ reed-pipe. But the proper\r\nway to play it was by lightly touching the string with the finger,\r\nas in making harmonics on the violin. This gave a series of tones,\r\naccording to the pitch of the open string, the same as the so-called\r\novertones. If the string were tuned to low C, the sounds were middle C,\r\nthen in succession E, G, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. This instrument was a\r\nfavorite with choirs of nuns to accompany their singing. Another name\r\ngiven to this instrument from its single string is Monochord.\r\n\r\n3. The Hurdy Gurdy, also called Vielle, Radleier (“wheel lyre”),\r\nBettlerleier (“mendicants’ lyre”), Organistrum and Chiffonie, was\r\na great favorite in the period from the 10th to the 12th century.\r\nThis peculiar instrument consisted of a resonant body, over which\r\nfour strings were stretched. It has analogies to bowed and keyed\r\ninstruments. Its shape was somewhat like that of the lute or the viola\r\nd’amore or guitar. Two of the strings were tuned in unison, were\r\nstopped by an arrangement of keys, directed by the player’s left hand\r\nshortening the string, thus making it possible to play melodies of a\r\nlimited compass. The other two strings were usually tuned as Tonic and\r\nDominant, thus giving a drone like the bagpipe. The strings are set\r\nin vibration by a wooden wheel, which, being well rosined, has the\r\nfunction of a violin bow; this wheel is turned by a handle at the tail\r\nend of the instrument, the player using his right hand for the purpose.\r\n\r\n4. The Chrotta (Welsh Crwth—“crooth”) is one of the oldest of string\r\ninstruments played with a bow. The original home was possibly India,\r\nbut in its European use it was limited to England, and especially to\r\nWales. It was a favorite instrument of the Welsh bards. The oldest form\r\nhad three strings. In its later form it was mounted with six strings,\r\nfour stretched over the fingerboard and played with the bow, and two\r\nlying at the side of the fingerboard, and pinched with the thumb of the\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\n5. Fidula (Fidel, Fiddle), equivalent to “viol,” is the comprehensive\r\nterm for the string instruments of the 8th to the 14th century. Its\r\nresonant body was arched and pear-shaped. The French flattened it more\r\nand called it Gigue, the Italians Giga, the Germans Geige, the latter\r\nterm still being used. Two varieties were in use—the small and the\r\nlarge. The former had three strings tuned in fifths, the latter four to\r\nsix, usually tuned in fourths and one third. The “large” species was\r\nmade in four sizes for Discant (soprano), Alto, Tenor, and Bass. The\r\n“large” instrument had no bridge such as the violin of today has, and\r\nin its rounded form was difficult to play. Later it was cut out at the\r\nsides, thus approaching the shape of our violin.\r\n\r\n6. The Viol, which first appears in the 15th century, had a resonant\r\nbody which came almost to a point back of the neck, and the upper\r\npart of the body of the instrument was smaller than the lower; the\r\nfingerboard had frets like our guitar; the edges were higher, the _f_\r\nholes were sickle-shaped, the top was flat, and the number of strings\r\nwas six. Viols were divided into two groups—those held with the arm\r\n(like our violin), those played between the knees (like our ’cello).\r\nThey were named the soprano or discant viol (violetta), the alto and\r\ntenor viols, and the bass viol (gamba). The contra-bass or double bass\r\nhas the viol form in certain respects.\r\n\r\nFrom the viol family comes our violin through a diminution and\r\nbeautifying of the form, through lessening the number of strings and\r\ndoing away with the frets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nLavignac.—Music and Musicians.

They can be secured at slight expense by addressing the\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XVI.\r\n\r\n               THE ORGAN, ORGAN PLAYING AND ORGAN MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the book of Genesis it is written: “Jubal, he was the father of all\r\nsuch as handle the harp and organ.” It is not to be understood that the\r\nword organ in this passage meant an instrument anything like that heard\r\nin our churches at the present day. In fact, as St. Augustine tells us,\r\nthere was a time when all musical instruments were called organs.\r\n\r\n=The Germ of the Organ=.—The invention of the organ is veiled in\r\ndeepest darkness. Its development from its earliest forms to its\r\npresent state has occupied a period of almost two thousand years.\r\nDoubtless, the first idea of a wind instrument was suggested by the\r\nbreeze blowing across the open ends of broken reeds, the discovery\r\nnaturally following that reeds of different lengths gave forth sounds\r\nof varying pitch. In course of time, reeds or pipes, differing in\r\nlength, began to be joined together, conveniently arranged so as to\r\nproduce a succession of musical sounds, the players blowing them with\r\nthe mouth. These instruments were called =Pan’s Pipes=, the =Syrinx= of\r\nthe ancient Greeks.\r\n\r\n=The First Stage of Development=.—As the number of pipes was increased,\r\nthe moving of the head back and forth in order to blow them became\r\ndifficult. The pipes were then placed in a sort of box or wind chest,\r\na tube being added through which the player could blow, the pipes not\r\nintended to sound being closed by the fingers. Furthermore, as the\r\npipes were increased in number and in size, it became necessary to\r\nemploy various mechanical accessories to furnish adequate wind supply,\r\nand to open and close the pipes at will, the breath and fingers of the\r\nplayer proving insufficient. A device was invented in the form of a\r\nslide, rule or tongue of wood, which was placed beneath the aperture\r\nof the pipe, and perforated so as to shut off or admit wind to the pipe\r\nas it was drawn back or forth. The earliest form of bellows might be\r\nsuggested by the leathern bag of the bagpipe. In this the wind pressure\r\nwas unsteady and the tone necessarily disconnected.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PAN’S PIPES (SYRINX).  EARLY FORM OF THE ORGAN.]\r\n\r\n=The Hydraulic Organ=.—The first attempts to secure regular or steady\r\nwind pressure were made by Ctesibus, who lived at Alexandria, about 180\r\nB. C. To him is ascribed the invention of the so-called “=Hydraulic\r\nOrgan=.” This term seems somewhat of a misnomer, since the water was\r\nused merely to give the necessary pressure to the bellows, and to\r\nregulate the wind supply. This method was never developed, since the\r\ndevice did not seem applicable to instruments of any considerable size.\r\nThe trend was rather toward a wind supply from a bellows operated on\r\nthe same principle as that of the blacksmith’s. In the Hydraulic Organ\r\nthe water was thus applied: An inverted air receiver, into which the\r\nwind was forced by a bellows, was immersed in a tank of water, the\r\npressure of the water around and above the receiver forcing the air\r\nthrough an aperture at the top into the pipes, the pressure being\r\nregulated by the volume of water in the tank. The hydraulic organ\r\ncontinued more or less in use up to the early part of the 14th century.\r\n\r\n=The Earliest Organs=.—The organ developed little as to size or\r\nmechanical improvements during the first ten centuries of the Christian\r\nEra, and it is difficult to trace the progressive stages in point of\r\ntime, place or mechanical invention. The first organ known to the\r\npeople of Western Europe was a present from the Byzantine emperor,\r\nConstantine, to Pepin the Short, Major-Domo of the Frankish Kingdom, in\r\n742. It had brass pipes and the “keys” were struck by hands and feet.\r\nEastern organs also came into France in the time of Charlemagne, son\r\nof Pepin. The first organ used in Germany was made in 812, modelled\r\nafter the one just mentioned. In 880, the Pope ordered an organ and\r\nan organ builder from Germany, which seems to indicate that the art\r\nhad found support there at an early date. Although not considered\r\nabsolutely indispensable, the organ from that time on seems to have\r\nbeen generally adopted for use in churches. Its many imperfections gave\r\nground for criticism, yet today it is considered, _par excellence_, the\r\necclesiastical instrument.\r\n\r\n=Increase in the Size of Organs=.—The organ builders of these early\r\ndays were mostly monks, Pope Sylvester II (1003) being eminent,\r\nunder the name of Gerbert, prior to his election to the papacy. They\r\nbuilt small organs called “=Portative=,” and large organs called\r\n“=Positive=.” The old hydraulic organ, owing to its excessive weight,\r\nwas called “Positive” to distinguish it from the “Portative” or\r\nportable organ, and these terms have been perpetuated to the present\r\ntime. An organ built for the Cathedral at Winchester, England, had ten\r\nkeys, four hundred pipes and twenty-six bellows, which were operated\r\nby seventy men, “in the sweat of their brows.” Since forty pipes were\r\nattached to a single key, it may be readily understood why its tone was\r\ncompared to thunder. The keys were very large, having a deep fall, and\r\nrequired the whole force of the hand to press down a single one.\r\n\r\n=Mechanical Improvements=.—The pipes in the early organs were made\r\nof copper, lead, tin, silver, glass, ivory and various woods, but\r\nexperiments finally showed =tin= or =wood= to be best suited for the\r\npurpose. The earliest organs had about twelve pipes, and the larger\r\ninstruments three octaves, but without the chromatic intervals. The\r\npipes were arranged according to the sequence of tones in the old\r\nChurch modes, the _octave containing_ but _three semitones_: between\r\nE-F, A-B flat and B-C. The chromatic tones were added gradually, the\r\nbreadth of the keys being correspondingly reduced as the increased\r\nnumber of keys occupied the same space as before. Heretofore, the\r\n_wind_ had usually been _forced from_ the _bellows_ by the _weight_ of\r\nmen standing upon them, but in the 10th century use began to be made of\r\na =lever=, the bellows presumably being weighted.\r\n\r\n=The Keyboard is Adopted=.—In the 11th century, the keyboard appeared,\r\nsupplanting the levers and slides, previously in use. The first organ\r\ncontaining this marked improvement was made for the Cathedral at\r\nMagdeburg, Germany. It had sixteen keys. In 1350, a monk at Thorn built\r\nan organ with twenty-two keys, and in 1361 an organ was built for the\r\nCathedral at Halberstadt with fourteen diatonic and eight chromatic\r\ntones in a compass extending from B, second line, bass staff, to A,\r\nsecond space, treble. This organ had three keyboards, now termed\r\nmanuals.\r\n\r\n=The Pedals=.—The invention of pedals is variously ascribed to Albert\r\nVan Os (about 1120), to Van Valbeke, of Brabant, and to a German named\r\n=Bernhard= (1470), an organist of Venice. The latter probably improved,\r\nbut did not invent the pedals. The pedals at first did not exceed the\r\ncompass of an octave, and were used only for sustaining prolonged\r\ntones. They were _fastened_ to the broad _manual keys_ by stout cords,\r\nthus enabling the performer to draw down the desired key with the foot.\r\nAbout the year 1418 the pedals began to be attached to _independent\r\npedal-pipes_, thus imparting to the organ a certain dignity and\r\nsonority, still a chief characteristic of the instrument. After 1475,\r\nall important organs were built with pedal keyboard.\r\n\r\n=The Introduction of Stops=.—Up to the 14th century, the different\r\nregisters (set of pipes with uniform tone quality) could not be sounded\r\nseparately, that is to say: _all_ the _pipes_ belonging to any one key\r\n_sounded_ when that key was depressed. At the close of the 14th century\r\nit was found possible to add =valves= to the pipes in such a manner\r\nas to cause the wind to pass through or be cut off from any series of\r\npipes at will. The opening and closing was managed through a spring.\r\nThe next improvement was to introduce a =slide= to open or close the\r\npassage of wind into the pipes. With these improvements it became\r\npossible for builders to set themselves to the improvement of the\r\nvarious “stops” or registers.\r\n\r\n=Improvements in Stops=.—In the 15th century, pipes of sixteen and\r\nthirty-two feet in length began to be used, necessitating a greatly\r\n_enlarged bellows_. Pipes were _closed_ at the _top_, thereby lowering\r\nthe pitch an octave. They were given _smaller diameters_, producing a\r\nsofter tone quality. The _shapes_ of the pipes were _varied_, giving\r\nadditional variety in tone quality.\r\n\r\nThus began the broad classifications of “=Open=” and “=Stopped=” pipes\r\nin all their varieties. The “=Reeds=” (pipes containing a vibrator\r\nor tongue to set the column of air in motion) were familiar to the\r\nearliest performers, but were not introduced into the organ until as\r\nlate as the 14th century. Further improvements were made in the bellows\r\nat the beginning of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n=St. Mary’s, Lübeck=.—In 1561, a three-manual organ was in use in St.\r\nMary’s, Lübeck, Germany. To this organ all the important improvements\r\nwere successively added at various intervals until it had, at the\r\nbeginning of the 18th century, in the three manuals, respectively,\r\nthirteen, fourteen and fifteen stops, and in the pedal, fifteen stops.\r\nIt was to hear the famous Buxtehude play upon this organ that Sebastian\r\nBach walked fifty miles in 1705.\r\n\r\n=Design of Improvements=.—Great improvements have been made in organ\r\nbuilding since the time of Bach, all designed to give the player\r\ngreater resources, and increased facility in the handling and control\r\nof the resources, which in the present day are simply enormous.\r\n\r\n=The Organ in the American Colonies=.—Although the first organs heard\r\nin America were probably introduced by the Spaniards, of these there\r\nare no authentic records. According to reliable historic data, the\r\nfamous old “Brattle” organ was “the first organ that ever pealed to the\r\nglory of God in this country.” It was imported from London, in 1713,\r\nby Mr. Thomas Brattle, who bequeathed it to the Brattle Street Church,\r\nBoston, directing that the parish “procure a sober person that can play\r\nskilfully thereon with a loud noise.” This organ became the property of\r\nKing’s Chapel, Boston, and was used until 1756.\r\n\r\n=No Art in Early Organ Playing=.—The organs of the early Christian\r\nperiod were of such a character that playing, in the sense in which we\r\nnow understand the word, was out of the question. For some time the\r\nspan of the hand possible to players did not exceed the distance of a\r\nfifth. If an octave was to be struck, a second player was necessary.\r\nOnly with the narrowing of the keys did artistic playing become\r\npossible. In fact, organ playing has invariably reflected the style and\r\ndevelopment of contemporary musical art.\r\n\r\n=Early Organists=.—The credit of being “father of organists” is given\r\nto =Francesco Landino=, of Florence (1325-1390), and after him to\r\n=Bernhard=, mentioned as the inventor of the organ pedals. The oldest\r\norgan compositions are some works by =Konrad Paumann= (1410-1473),\r\nwho was born blind, yet, like many others since, became a thoroughly\r\ntrained musician in spite of his affliction. He also played other\r\ninstruments and was a fine contrapuntist. Another of the early\r\norganists is =Benedictus Ducis= (or Hertoghs), born at Bruges, about\r\n1480. He was a pupil of Josquin des Pres. From Ducis, representing the\r\nsecond Flemish school, as founded by Okeghem, there is a chain almost\r\nof master and pupil, between the early masters of organ playing and\r\npolyphonic writing and Bach, who in these arts became the master of\r\nall. Paumann’s pieces show the style of composing for the instrument\r\nthat was considered appropriate. They are essentially transcribed,\r\nbut elaborated, vocal works. The compositions of the next organists\r\nof fame, Willaert, of Venice (1490-1562), and Cyprian di Rore\r\n(1516-1565), pupil of the former, have distinct names. _Ricercari_,\r\n_Intonationi_, _Contrapunti_, _Toccati_, _Praeambula_, and _Canzoni_,\r\nbut the character remains the same, vocal pieces, elaborated and\r\nfreely embellished with runs and other passage work. Later the term\r\n_Ricercari_ came to mean a sort of fantasia in fugal form, often on\r\na popular air; _Toccata_ became a free fantasia with brilliantly\r\nfigurated passages, and a _Praeambulo_ a prelude to a larger piece.\r\nOther famous organists of this period were =Bernhard Schmidt= (1520-?),\r\nGerman; =Claudio Merulo= (1532-1604), organist at Venice, and his\r\nsuccessors, the two =Gabrieli’s=.\r\n\r\n=Frescobaldi and His Successors=.—The greatest of all the organists\r\nof the earlier days, to whom the title of “Father of true organ\r\nplaying” has been given, was =Girolamo Frescobaldi=, born in 1583 at\r\nFerrara, in Italy, educated in Flanders, and from 1608 to his death\r\nin 1644 organist at St. Peter’s, Rome. His fame was so great that the\r\nspacious cathedral was often filled when he gave an organ recital. His\r\ncompositions, many of which have been preserved, have a very decided\r\ncontrapuntal character, whence some have called him the inventor of the\r\norgan fugue. Two prominent German organists, whose compositions were\r\nstudied by Bach, were =Caspar Kerl= (1627-1693), and =Jacob Froberger=\r\n(———1667), both of whom lived in Vienna. The most eminent organist\r\nof the 17th century was =Johann Peter Sweelinck= (1562-1621), pupil\r\nof Zarlino, the famous Italian theorist, and of Andreas Gabrieli,\r\norganist of Venice. Sweelinck occupied the position of organist at the\r\nCathedral in Amsterdam, and gave much attention to the development of\r\nthe fugal style of composition. His compositions are of the highest\r\nimportance historically, since they exhibit the first known examples\r\nof the independent use of the pedals in a real fugal part. He was the\r\nmost eminent organist of his time (being called the organist maker),\r\nand was the teacher of the following noted players: =Jacob Praetorius=\r\n(died at Hamburg in 1651); =Heinrich Scheidemann= (1596-1663), also\r\nlocated at Hamburg; =Jan Adams Reinken= (1623-1722), from 1663 organist\r\nand successor to Scheidemann at the Catherine Church, Hamburg (Bach\r\ncame to Hamburg several times to hear Reinken play and to learn his\r\nstyle); =Samuel Scheidt= (1587-1654), organist at Halle. Some of their\r\ncompositions are accessible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHANN PETER SWEELINCK.]\r\n\r\nOther famous organists of this period were =Johann Pachelbel=\r\n(1653-1706), located at Nuremberg (Bach studied his works as a lad);\r\n=Dietrich Buxtehude= (1637-1707), organist at Lübeck for thirty-nine\r\nyears. One of the most important names of this period of development is\r\nthat of =Johann Joseph Fux= (1660-1741). His “_Gradus ad Parnassum_,”\r\npublished in 1725, a treatise on counterpoint based on the practice of\r\nthe great masters, played an important part in the training of Haydn,\r\nMozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\n=English Organists=.—In the history of English organ playing, the\r\nfirst great name to engage our attention is that of =Thomas Tallys=,\r\nborn about 1520. He is called the “Father of English church music.” He\r\nserved under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth,\r\nas organist of the Chapel Royal. English organists of distinction\r\ncontemporary with and succeeding Tallys were =John Merbecke=, =Richard\r\nFarrant=, =William Byrd=, =John Bull=, =Thomas Morley=, =Orlando\r\nGibbons= (a contemporary of Frescobaldi), =Matthew Lock=, =John Blow=\r\nand =Henry Purcell=. The last mentioned, born in 1658, became organist\r\nof Westminster Abbey in 1680. The name of Purcell is one of the\r\nstrongest in the history of English music. It was his ambition to found\r\na distinctive school of English composition. Although not successful in\r\nthis, he made a lasting impression on English church music and produced\r\nmany charming secular works. It is on record that he stood high in the\r\nestimation of his European contemporaries.\r\n\r\n=Culmination in Bach and Handel=.—The Polyphonic Period culminated in\r\nBach and Handel, both born in 1685. These two, who never met, and who\r\nworked upon dissimilar lines, were the most famous organists of their\r\nday, in addition to their greatness in composition.\r\n\r\n=The Organ and Polyphonic Music=.—Bach must be regarded as the source\r\nof modern organ composition and playing. In him polyphonic composition\r\nattained its highest perfection and the organ stands as the centre of\r\nthe Polyphonic school. The development of the Opera and its influence\r\ntowards a freer style in vocal and instrumental composition and the\r\ntendency of instrumental music to develop along harmonic lines had the\r\neffect of relegating polyphonic music to the Church with the organ\r\nas its chief vehicle. It is only of comparatively recent years that\r\nthe organ has become a concert instrument. Bach’s treatment of the\r\ninstrument serves as a model for the composers of all time and the\r\nstudy of his works is indispensable to the development of technical\r\ncommand of the organ and the cultivation of the true organ style.\r\nHandel’s permanent contribution to organ literature consists of sets\r\nof =Concertos=. These concertos, a number of which are still played\r\nand admired, excited the enthusiasm of Sir John Hawkins, who gives a\r\nglowing account of them in his history. =Bach= was appointed Cantor\r\nat the _St. Thomas Schule_, Leipzig, in 1723, and it was here that\r\nmuch of his greatest work was accomplished. In addition to his duties\r\nat the school, he directed the music in the Churches of St. Thomas\r\nand St. Nicholas. As to the relative superiority of Bach and Handel\r\nas organists, contemporary opinion seems to have differed widely.\r\nEach undoubtedly had a style of his own as shown in his published\r\ncompositions. Each excelled in improvisation.\r\n\r\n=The Chorale in Protestant Organ Music=.—In addition to his\r\nincomparable preludes and fugues, toccatas, fantasias and pieces in\r\nthe larger forms, Bach made the polyphonic treatment of the =chorale=\r\nan art peculiarly his own. In fact, the German style of organ playing\r\nmay be said to have developed from the chorale and from the music of\r\nthe Reformation. This furnished a fresher and very different source\r\nof inspiration from the Gregorian chant which had been handled so\r\neffectively by Frescobaldi and his Italian successors.\r\n\r\n=Marchand=.—One of the most renowned of early French organists was\r\n=Louis Marchand= (1671-1732). In 1717, while living under banishment\r\nin Dresden, he was to have entered into a trial of skill with Bach,\r\nbut lost courage and departed on the morning of the appointed day. A\r\ncertain triviality has at times characterized the French school of\r\norgan music, undoubtedly a reflection of the prevailing style and taste\r\nin other branches of musical composition. Of later years, however, a\r\nmore serious and exalted style has developed.\r\n\r\n=The German School=.—To return to the German organists. A name familiar\r\nto all students of the organ is that of Rinck. =Johann C. H. Rinck=\r\n(1770-1846) was a pupil of Kittel, who in turn was a pupil of J. S.\r\nBach. Rinck’s reputation is based largely on his “Practical Organ\r\nSchool,” a work still in use. Another name of importance is that of\r\n=Johann Gottlob Schneider= (1789-1864). He has had the reputation of\r\nbeing one of the greatest German organists since the time of Bach. Of\r\nthe great composers since Bach, =Mendelssohn= stands conspicuous as\r\nan organist and composer of organ music. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven,\r\nalthough occasionally using the organ in their scores, did not compose\r\nfor the instrument. Mendelssohn developed a decided fondness for the\r\norgan, which he played admirably. His six sonatas and three preludes\r\nand fugues are masterpieces. Among the representative German organists\r\nand composers should be mentioned: =Adolph Hesse= (1809-1863), author\r\nof the “Practical Organist” and a prolific composer; =Karl August\r\nHaupt= (1810-1891), a celebrated teacher, numbering among his many\r\npupils from all countries such prominent American organists as Eugene\r\nThayer, Clarence Eddy and J. K. Paine; =Carl Ludwig Thiele= (1816-1848)\r\ncomposer of some of the most difficult known works for the organ;\r\n=Gustav Merkel= (1827-1885), a prolific composer, whose sonatas\r\nare numbered among the standard works for the instrument; =J. G.\r\nRheinberger= (1837-1901), one of the finest organists and best teachers\r\nof his time and a composer of great ability, whose twenty sonatas form\r\na permanent addition to the best organ literature. A number of American\r\norganists were among his pupils.\r\n\r\n=The French School=.—Prominent among organists of the French school in\r\nthe 19th century may be mentioned: =L. J. A. Lefébure-Wély= (1817-1869)\r\nand =Antoine Eduard Batiste= (1820-1876). The works of both these\r\norganists are still widely played and have won much popularity. Wely\r\nhas been called the “Auber of the organ.” His works display fertility\r\nof melodic invention and a piquancy of harmonic treatment, but are\r\nentirely lacking in the polyphonic element. Much the same may be said\r\nof Batiste, who was a fine player and teacher, and who equalled Wely\r\nin tunefulness but not in musicianship. =Nicholas Jacques Lemmens=\r\n(1823-81), a great player (especially of Bach) and author of the\r\ncelebrated “Ecole d’Orgue” may be said to have laid the foundation of\r\nthe modern French school. Conspicuous among his successors have been:\r\n=Camille Saint-Saëns= (1835-——), a most versatile musician and a noted\r\norganist; =Théodore Dubois= (1837-——), =Théodore Salome= (1834-——)\r\nand =Felix Alexandre Guilmant= (1837-——). Guilmant, one of the most\r\nnoted organists and composers of the present day, was a favorite pupil\r\nof Lemmens. He has been one of the most prolific composers since the\r\ntime of Bach, is a master of all the resources of the modern organ,\r\nand has a fertility of invention and a fluent command of contrapuntal\r\nresources. Another eminent French organist is =C. M. Widor= (1845-——),\r\nalso a composer of distinction. A powerful influence was exerted on\r\nmodern organ music, as well as general composition, by the eminent\r\norganist and composer, =César Franck=, who was, for a number of years,\r\nin charge of the organ class at the Paris _Conservatoire_.\r\n\r\n=The Italian School=.—Among recent Italian organists =Filippo Capocci=\r\n(1840-——) and =Enrico Bossi= (1861-——) are worthy of mention. Both are\r\nsplendid organists and prolific composers. They are leaders in the\r\nrevival of good organ playing in Italy, where a determined effort is\r\nbeing made to restore the art to its former supremacy.\r\n\r\n=The English School=.—England has furnished a long line of 19th century\r\norganists of ability, prominent among whom are: =Sir John Goss=\r\n(1800-1880), =Henry Smart= (1813-1879), =E. J. Hopkins= (1818-1901),\r\n=S. S. Wesley= (1810-1876), =Dr. Wm. Spark= (1825-1897). Foremost among\r\nEnglish organists stands the name of =Wm. T. Best= (1826-1897). He was\r\none of the most famous concert organists of his time, but is best known\r\nto organ students by his “Arrangements from the Scores of the Great\r\nMasters,” in which he demonstrated that the organ is in itself capable\r\nof reproducing certain orchestral effects without transcending its\r\nproper functions or descending to trickery. “The Organ,” by =Sir John\r\nStainer= (1840-1901), is one of the most widely used elementary works\r\nfor instruction in organ playing. Dr. Stainer was the successor of Sir\r\nJohn Goss, at St. Paul’s, London, and was appointed Professor of Music\r\nat Oxford University in 1889. =Frederic Archer= (1838-1901) has been\r\nconsidered one of the greatest of organ players. After a successful\r\ncareer in England, he came to America in 1880. He did much towards\r\npopularizing and elevating the art of organ playing in this country.\r\nProminent among contemporary English organists stands =Edwin H. Lemare=\r\n(1865-——), who succeeded Frederic Archer as organist of Carnegie\r\nHall, Pittsburg, in 1902. He is a skilful virtuoso, a composer of\r\noriginality, and a leading representative of the modern English school.\r\n\r\n=Modern Organ Music=.—Organ playing and composition have kept pace\r\nwith the mechanical and artistic evolution of the instrument, and the\r\nlines between the various schools are becoming less closely drawn.\r\nThe tendency of builders to imitate orchestral tone and effects\r\nhas had influence on composers and players alike. This tendency is\r\nless noticeable in the works of the German school, where a modified\r\npolyphony still flourishes, based on the principle of the classic\r\ntreatment of the chorale and growing out of the music of the Lutheran\r\nChurch. The organ compositions of the modern French school are\r\ncharacterized by grace, refinement and originality, coupled with a\r\ncertain dignity and elegance. They combine free harmonic treatment and\r\nmodern polyphony, together with certain ornate characteristics, growing\r\nout of the elaborate ceremonial music of the Latin Church, and bringing\r\ninto play all the resources of tone color and expressive treatment\r\nof the modern instrument. Much the same may be said of the modern\r\nEnglish school, which nevertheless still shows traces of the early\r\nEnglish style, based on the dignity and purity of cathedral use and\r\ntradition. The orchestral tendency, both in composition for the organ\r\nand in the transcription of orchestral works for the instrument, shows\r\nitself more or less in all schools, and the organ, in addition to its\r\nposition in the church, is becoming more and more a concert instrument.\r\nThe compositions of the American organists reflect, in a measure, the\r\ncharacteristics of the schools in which they have been trained, and in\r\nparticular show traces of the styles of the masters with whom they have\r\nchiefly studied.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

It was a result of what is known as the\r\nRenaissance, so-called because its most prominent manifestation in\r\nItaly was a revival of the learning of the ancients. This phase of\r\nthe movement was initiated by =Petrarch= (1304-1370), who devoted\r\nhis life to the study of the classical past of Italy. The Latin\r\nclassics had never been entirely lost, but those of the Greeks had\r\nbecome practically extinct during the dark ages which followed the\r\nconquest of the Roman Empire by the barbarians of the North, in the 5th\r\ncentury. The arts had been kept alive only through the fostering care\r\nof the Church, and all had taken on a conventionally ecclesiastical\r\ncharacter. Education had declined; it was practically confined to\r\nchurchmen—even kings and rulers could barely sign their names, while\r\nthe people at large were sunk in gross ignorance. The revival of Latin\r\nliterature through the influence of Petrarch led to an interest in the\r\nGreek classics which soon became the engrossing study of the learned.\r\nDiligent search was made for lost and forgotten manuscripts; academies\r\nof learning were founded; lectures were given on Greek philosophy.\r\nIn the enthusiasm thus created it was even thought that not only the\r\narts and literature of the ancient world might be restored, but its\r\ngovernmental, social and political structure as well.\r\n\r\n=Scope of the Renaissance=.—The Renaissance, however, was not merely\r\nliterary in nature. It was in reality the awakening of man from the\r\nspiritual and intellectual slumber which had bound him for nearly a\r\nthousand years. Long before it was defined it had been perceptible in\r\nmany ways. First, materially, in a spirit of exploration, of adventure\r\nand enterprise. Traders and travelers startled Europe with glowing\r\naccounts of the far East; missionaries took long and dangerous voyages\r\nin the hope of converting its heathen inhabitants. An eager desire for\r\nincreased commercial facilities with these favored countries by means\r\nof a westward passage brought about the discovery of America, with\r\nwhich modern history may be said to have opened.\r\n\r\nWith this extension of the world’s boundaries, the mind of man began\r\nto expand as well. As he looked forward with eager anticipation to the\r\nfuture, he studied the past with an eye newly alive to the treasures of\r\nits buried culture. Instead of his former acquiescence in being one of\r\na dull, inert mass, serving without question those in authority over\r\nhim, he began to feel and to assert his own individuality, to resist\r\nthe crushing weight of feudalism which had hitherto oppressed him.\r\nFreedom of intellect, of conscience, of science, of art, was in the air.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this transition from medievalism toward modern liberty\r\nof thought and action varied with different nationalities. In northern\r\nnations it took the direction of rebellion against prevailing religious\r\nand political conditions, for example, in Germany and England. Italy,\r\nhowever, remained steadfast in religion and government; the revolt was\r\nagainst traditions in matters of art and literature. Roman law and\r\nGreek philosophy were exhumed; the classics were zealously studied for\r\nstandards of taste and culture.\r\n\r\n=Music of the Ancients=.—Notwithstanding this research, no trace\r\nwas found of the music actually in use among the ancients. From the\r\nevanescent nature of the art and the total lack of examples, the\r\nelaborate descriptions of its complicated system of scales and modes\r\ngiven by Greek philosophers failed to yield a trustworthy clue to its\r\nreal character.\r\n\r\nIt was known, however, that the _drama_, owing to the enormous\r\nproportions of the amphitheatre in which it was performed, was\r\n_musically declaimed_, and that the voices of the actors and chorus\r\nwere sustained by lyres and flutes. Thus, in the Greek tragedy we find\r\nthe principal features of the modern opera—scenery, dramatic action,\r\nsolo and choral singing, the orchestra. It was also known that in the\r\nmusic of the Greeks the _word_ was the _governing principle_; that\r\nthere was no independent instrumental music—nor was there elsewhere\r\nfor many centuries afterward. The tone was regarded only as a means of\r\nheightening the effect of the poetry; the succession of long and short\r\nsyllables dictated both rhythm and melody. Of harmony in the modern\r\nsense of the term, there was none; instruments and voices alike were in\r\nunison.\r\n\r\n=Music Chiefly Choral=.—In the 16th century, Florence was the centre\r\nof the enthusiasm for Greek culture. She and her sister-cities in the\r\nnorth of Italy were the arbiters in matters of taste, of learning and\r\nerudition. There, toward the end of the century, a small group of\r\nscholars and musicians, known as the _Camerata_ (Chamber), meeting at\r\nthe house of Count Bardi, discussed the possibility of reproducing\r\nthe musical declamation of Greek tragedy. The time was ripe for such\r\nan experiment. The polyphonic school had reached its climax in the\r\nintricate works of =di Lasso= (1520-1594) and =Palestrina= (1514-1594).\r\nThough admirably suited to the Church, the contrapuntal style of these\r\ngreat composers was manifestly unfit for dramatic purposes; it could\r\nvoice the aspirations of a body of worshipers swayed by a common\r\nbelief, but could not express individual feeling. No voice was more\r\nimportant than another, all progressed according to canonic law, their\r\ncomplex intertwining practically destroying the essentially secular\r\nelements of accent and rhythm. It was, in short, the embodiment in\r\nmusic of the medievalism which had so long controlled Church and State.\r\n\r\nThus far the spirit of emancipation which had produced such great\r\nresults in the other arts and in politics elsewhere had touched\r\nmusic but lightly. Attempts had been made to break the restraints\r\nof contrapuntalism, but there was a total ignorance as to what\r\nsteps would prove most effective in reaching that end, and nothing\r\ndefinite had been accomplished. Aside from the Folk-song, which was\r\nignored by musicians save only as it served as Cantus Firmus for their\r\ncounterpoint, there was no music for the solo voice; it was conceived\r\nsolely from a choral standpoint.\r\n\r\n=The Recitative=.—Their dissatisfaction with the school of music then\r\nin vogue and the impossibility of adapting it to their purpose led\r\nto various experiments by this band of enthusiasts to discover the\r\nprinciples upon which the Greeks had founded the musical declamation\r\nemployed in their tragedies. They argued that it must have followed\r\nas closely as possible the _inflections of the voice_ in speaking;\r\ntherefore they made this their study. Thus originated the Recitative,\r\nthe distinguishing feature of the lyric drama, which, though using the\r\ndefinite pitches of the musical scale, reproduces in its progressions\r\nand cadences the characteristic but intensified effect of an oratorical\r\ndelivery of the text. It was the exact contrary of the music of the\r\nage in which the word counted for almost nothing, the art of combining\r\nindependent voices and of playing them off one against the other for\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n=The Cantata=.—The first result of their efforts was the Cantata\r\n(from _cantare_, to sing), meaning a composition for the voice in\r\ncontradistinction to the Sonata (from _sonare_, to sound), which\r\nwas applied to one for instruments. The Cantata had but little in\r\ncommon with what is now understood by the term. It was a recitation\r\non musical intervals for a single voice accompanied by but one\r\ninstrument. Anything like a formal melody was carefully avoided, and\r\nthe accompaniment, generally played on the lute, was of the most\r\nunpretending character. The first of these cantatas was composed by\r\n=Vincenzo Galilei=, the father of the celebrated astronomer, on the\r\ntragic fate of Count Ugolino, as related by Dante in the _Inferno_.\r\nThis, therefore, was the _first art-song_ ever composed. Unfortunately,\r\nit has been lost; but contemporary accounts tell of the profound\r\nimpression it created. Other cantatas were written and sung by =Giulio\r\nCaccini= (1550-1618), a skilled and an admirable lutist as well, and\r\nall awakened the utmost enthusiasm among the little company.\r\n\r\nThese works were known as _Nuove Musiche_ (new music) and such as have\r\nsurvived are, in general, painfully thin and crude to modern ears. When\r\ncompared with the rich polyphony of the prevailing Church style they\r\nseem at the first blush to indicate retrogression. Progress, however,\r\nseldom advances in a direct line; it generally moves by spirals which\r\nat times apparently retreat only to mount the higher at the succeeding\r\ncurve. These dull recitatives bore the _germ of emancipation_ from the\r\nscholastic laws which had heretofore prevented music from expressing\r\nindividual emotion; they typify the spirit of the Renaissance and are\r\nthe foundation of the art as we now know it.\r\n\r\n=The First Opera=.—Another of the number, =Jacopo Peri= (1561-1633),\r\nalso a musician, took the next step by composing music of the same\r\nstyle to a drama, the _Dafne_ (Daphne) of the poet Rinuccini, who was\r\nthe life and soul of this attempt to revive the lost declamation of the\r\nGreeks. This was performed privately in 1595 at the Corsi Palace, and\r\nproduced so strong an impression that it was repeated a number of times\r\nat the Carnival seasons of the succeeding years. In 1600, Peri was\r\ninvited to compose a similar work for the marriage festivities of Henry\r\nIV of France and Maria di Medici. This was _Euridice_, also written by\r\nRinuccini, which bears the distinction of being the _first opera_ to\r\nreceive public performance, and thus introducing the new art-form to\r\nthe world at large. The score of _Dafne_ has been lost, but that of\r\n_Euridice_ still exists.\r\n\r\nIt was then known as a music drama (_melo dramma_ or _dramma per la\r\nmusica_); the term opera (abbreviation for _opera in musica_, that is,\r\nmusical work) did not come into use until the middle of the century.\r\nThe orchestra, which was played behind the scenes, consisted of a\r\nharpsichord, two lutes and a bass-viol. In addition, three lutes played\r\na short _ritornello_ (interlude) in one scene. With this exception,\r\nthe instruments were used merely to support the voice; the tonality\r\nwas almost exclusively minor, and the harmony of the simplest. It is\r\nthought that Peri sang the part of Orpheus and that Francesca Caccini,\r\ndaughter of the composer and one of the most gifted singers of the day,\r\nsang Euridice.\r\n\r\n[Music: Radoppia e fiamm’e lumi al memorabil giorno, Febo ch’il carro\r\nd’or rivolgi intorno.\r\n\r\nPART OF AN AIR BY CACCINI.]\r\n\r\nCaccini claimed the new style as his invention, and it is certain that\r\nparts of _Euridice_ were composed by him, though Peri’s name alone\r\nappears on the title page of the published work. Emulating the success\r\nof his colleague, the former soon set the same drama to music.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the Early Opera=.—The two settings are so similar\r\nthat one might almost be taken for the other. Both display the same\r\ncharacteristics. Of dramatic feeling or characterization as understood\r\nat the present day there is no sign; development of musical thought,\r\nnone whatever; a dreary waste of recitatives is but slightly relieved\r\nby the occasional flourishes (_giri e gruppi_, that is, runs and turns)\r\nallowed the singers by the taste of the times. The choruses, however,\r\nwhich are introduced freely, serve to vary the monotony somewhat. They\r\nexhibit a singular mingling of the old and new styles, natural under\r\nthe circumstances. The voices sing either in a recitative-like unison,\r\nor begin in fugato, and later move in simple harmonic progression.\r\nTheir distaste for the contrapuntal style led these reformers to\r\nreject it so far as they could. Its appearance at all is due to the\r\nfact that no other mode of writing for a number of voices had as yet\r\nbeen devised—a strictly harmonic treatment had not been thought of.\r\nSince, then, they were at a loss as to the management of choral masses,\r\nthey were obliged to have recourse in part to old methods.\r\n\r\nAnother name associated with the Florentine school deserving mention is\r\nthat of =Marco da Gagliano=, a priest who soon took the lead in the new\r\nmovement. His first opera was _Dafne_ (1607), composed to Rinuccini’s\r\ndrama which had already served Peri; it was a common practice in those\r\ndays for composers to use the same text. As a scholar and musician,\r\nGagliano was superior to his predecessors. He shows a greater warmth\r\nof feeling and a tendency toward melody which they considered as a\r\nlowering of their ideals.\r\n\r\n=The Florentine School=.—One particular characteristic of the\r\nFlorentine school was a sedulous _avoidance_ of anything like _extended\r\nmelody_ or definite form. To the composers of this school, music was\r\nnot an end in itself; it was subordinate to the distinct, _impassioned\r\ndeclamation_ of the poet’s verses. They held that any independent\r\ndevelopment of musical thought was a weakness; that it tended to\r\ndistract the attention of the hearer from the drama, and to interfere\r\nwith its logical continuity. The predominant influence was that of\r\nthe scholar, not of the musician. This was to be expected from the\r\ncharacter of the little coterie interested in the new art-form. The\r\nmajority were wealthy amateurs, zealous students of the classics and\r\naflame with the desire for the actual revival of the Greek tragedy.\r\nPeri and Caccini were the only musicians and they were strongly averse\r\nto the contrapuntal music of the day. Its persistently ecclesiastical\r\neffect debarred it from expressing the personal feeling which was\r\nthe object of their research. In the effort to escape its ban, they\r\nunwittingly emancipated their art from the control of the Church, and\r\nmade it accessible to mankind in general. This, therefore, is the great\r\nservice of the Florentine reformers: the establishment of a purely\r\nsecular school of music susceptible of indefinite development.\r\n\r\nMaking allowance for the vast difference in means due to the practical\r\ncreation of independent instrumental music since the 17th century,\r\ntheir practice was precisely the same as that of the modern composer\r\nwho writes a music drama and uses the same term to define his work.\r\nWhen _Dafne_ and _Euridice_ first saw the light, however, there was\r\nneither knowledge nor experience to point the way; it was found only\r\nafter a slow and laborious process of experimentation, involving the\r\nacceptance of much that was rejected after having served its turn.\r\nThough Peri and Caccini with their confrères did not succeed in the end\r\nthey had in view, they accomplished far more by originating the Opera,\r\nthe point of departure for the whole modern art of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nSymonds.—The Renaissance in Italy.\r\n\r\nApthorp.—Opera Past and Present.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE OPERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The First Oratorio=.—The novelty of the new style, which was called\r\nthe _stilo rappresentativo_ (representative style), the vigor and\r\nfreedom it gave to an impressive delivery of the text, aroused\r\nuniversal attention. Among the composers who essayed it was =Emilio\r\ndel Cavaliere= (1550-1599). By applying it to a sacred subject, he\r\noriginated the Oratorio. Roman by birth, he had passed part of his life\r\nin Florence, and though not a member of the _Camerata_, was familiar\r\nwith its aims and practice.\r\n\r\nThe germ both of the Opera and Oratorio is to be found in the Miracle\r\nPlays or so-called Mysteries of the Middle Ages. These were dramatic\r\nrepresentations of _Bible scenes_ or _religious allegories_ by means\r\nof which a populace unable to read was taught the great truths of\r\nsacred history. Cavaliere’s oratorio, _La Rappresentazione di Anima e\r\ndi Corpo_ (The Representation of Soul and Body), was given in 1600 in\r\nRome, at the Oratory of the Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella—hence\r\nits name.\r\n\r\n[Music: PASSAGE FROM CAVALIERE’S ORATORIO.]\r\n\r\n=Its Characteristics=.—Save for the _nature_ of the _subject_, there\r\nwas no apparent difference between it and an opera. The allegorical\r\ncharacters taking part appeared in costume and in action. The score\r\neven gives directions by which it may be concluded with a dance if\r\nso desired. By this, however, dignified and stately movements are\r\nunderstood, in nowise resembling the rapid dance of modern times. The\r\ncomposer in his instructions for performance, which are unusually full\r\nand complete, lays great stress upon an expressive delivery of the\r\ntext, and the swelling and diminishing of the tones by the singers.\r\nIn vigor and characterization it far surpasses Peri’s and Caccini’s\r\noperas. Cavaliere’s death, which occurred ten months before the\r\nproduction of his work, and the great popularity of the Opera, put a\r\nstop to the immediate development of the Oratorio; that was reserved\r\nfor Carissimi a generation later.\r\n\r\n=Monteverde=.—The task of taking the opera from the experimental\r\nstage and of placing it on the artistic foundation which it now\r\noccupies was accomplished by =Claudio Monteverde= (1568-1643), a man\r\nof extraordinary genius and originality. A harmonist of surpassing\r\nforce and boldness, he had always rebelled against the restraints\r\nof the contrapuntal school, though, unlike Peri and Caccini, he\r\nwas skilled in its intricacies. He was viol player in the band of\r\nthe Duke of Mantua, and had composed masses and madrigals, many of\r\nwhich were severely criticised by the pedants of the day. He joined\r\ndefinite issue with them in his _freedom of treating dissonances_,\r\nthe distinguishing feature of modern harmony. Heretofore, sevenths,\r\nninths, augmented fourths and the like had never been heard without\r\npreparation. Monteverde, however, introduced them without regard to\r\nthis restriction, little heeding the anathemas heaped upon his head by\r\nthose who considered his infractions of established rules unpardonable.\r\nHis ardent, restless temperament, seeking novel modes of expression,\r\noften led to wild and extravagant combinations which even today appear\r\nharsh and forced. At that time they must have seemed wilful attempts\r\nat outraging the ear and the sense of harmonic propriety. These\r\ninnovations, however, are the cornerstone of modern harmony; of this as\r\nwell as of the opera, Monteverde is the real founder. What are defects\r\nin his church music are excellences in his operas. The discords which\r\ndisturb the serenity of a religious atmosphere are admirably fitted to\r\nproduce dramatic effects and powerful climaxes. Monteverde belonged\r\nto the stage as his great contemporary, Palestrina, belonged to the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n=Position of Music in the 17th Century=.—The interest which the\r\nsuccess of the Florentine composers would have for a man thus gifted\r\ncan be readily imagined. Yet he was obliged to wait a number of years\r\nfor an opportunity to emulate their achievements. Music then was the\r\nespecial pastime of the great; it was part of the state with which they\r\nsurrounded themselves. Almost all titled and wealthy families had their\r\nown bands of musicians and choirs of singers. These assisted in their\r\nprivate chapels and lent additional eclat to seasons of festivity.\r\nConcerts and operas were given only at court or in the palaces of\r\nnoblemen; public halls for any kind of musical occasion were unknown.\r\nA musician or composer could make his way only by attaching himself\r\nto a noble house or by securing a patron in court circles. _Dafne_\r\nand _Euridice_ were made possible through the interest and protection\r\nof Count Bardi and Count Corsi. The opera was also attended with\r\ngreat expense. The taste of the times demanded an enormous outlay for\r\nmounting—costumes, scenery, decorations; only the extremely wealthy\r\ncould afford it, and they reserved it for occasions of especial\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[Music: ARIADNE’S LAMENT.]\r\n\r\n=Monteverde’s First Opera=.—In 1607, the marriage of Margaret of Savoy\r\nto Francesco Gonzaga, son of the Duke of Mantua, opened the way for\r\nMonteverde’s first opera, _Arianna_ (Ariadne), which was received with\r\nthe utmost enthusiasm. Unfortunately, but a fragment of it remains,\r\nAriadne’s lament after her desertion by Theseus, the most celebrated\r\nopera air ever written. In its unprepared discords of the harshest\r\nnature, in the poignant expression of grief and despair so at variance\r\nwith the placid art of the day, this shows how, by a single stroke,\r\nMonteverde cut loose from all the traditions of the past. In its less\r\nthan a score of measures it also anticipates principles of artistic\r\nstructure which were not formulated for nearly a century later and\r\nwhich hold good to the present day. It is said that it brought tears to\r\nevery eye.\r\n\r\n[Music: RITORNELLO BY MONTEVERDE.]\r\n\r\n=His Second Opera=.—The following year he produced his second opera,\r\n_Orfeo_ (Orpheus), so called to distinguish it from Peri’s _Euridice_\r\non the same subject. Though most of Monteverde’s works have been\r\nlost, the score of _Orfeo_ has been preserved. It shows a surprising\r\nadvance over the simplicity of the Florentine operas. First of all,\r\nin the great _expansion of the orchestra_. This numbers thirty-seven\r\ninstruments which throughout are _combined in groups_ and as a whole\r\nwith an art prefiguring certain effects of orchestration supposed to\r\nbe purely modern. Like harmony, instrumentation dates from Monteverde.\r\nInstead of the customary vocal prologue, it begins with a _Toccata_\r\n(instrumental prelude). The composer’s keen dramatic instinct is\r\nshown by the masterly way in which he avoids the monotony of his\r\npredecessors; the recitatives are varied by the introduction of\r\n_ritornelli_, and each act ends with a chorus and a stately passage for\r\nthe orchestra. Five years later, the most famous composer of the day,\r\nhe left Mantua for Venice, where until his death he was director of\r\nmusic at St. Mark’s.\r\n\r\n=Monteverde’s Characteristics=.—Monteverde’s greatest service to\r\nthe opera lay in enlarging the sphere of the orchestra, and in the\r\ninitiation of a thoroughly instrumental style adapted to the character\r\nof each instrument. He increased the number of players and released\r\nthe orchestra from the subordinate position of being a mere support\r\nfor the voice by employing it to heighten the dramatic situation. He\r\noriginated many previously unknown effects, among them the _pizzicato_\r\nand the _tremolo_ of the violins in precisely the same form as used at\r\npresent. The latter so astounded the players that at first they refused\r\nto attempt it, saying that it was impossible. He endowed the Recitative\r\nwith far greater freedom and depth of expression; under his hand it\r\nlost much of the dryness of the Florentine school. His manner of\r\n_writing_ for the voice was _declamatory_ rather than melodious; what\r\ntraces of definite melody occur in his works are generally confined\r\nto the instruments, in which he curiously anticipates the practice of\r\nlatter-day dramatic composers.\r\n\r\n=Popularization of the Opera=.—Until 1637 the opera was restricted to\r\nroyalty and the nobility. In that year the first public opera house was\r\nopened in Venice, and such was the popularity of the new amusement that\r\nbefore the end of the century there were no fewer than eleven in that\r\ncity alone, then with a population of about 140,000. It spread through\r\nItaly with almost like rapidity, bearing in its wake an unparalleled\r\ndevelopment of the art of song.\r\n\r\n=Change of Character=.—With its introduction to the people, it was\r\nmanifestly impossible for the opera to retain its original character.\r\nSo long as it was confined to the cultivated, the classical ideals of\r\nits founders met with intelligent appreciation, but when confronted\r\nwith audiences drawn from the masses desirous only of being amused,\r\na change was inevitable. Mythological and classical subjects were\r\ngradually discarded in favor of those involving intrigue and disguise;\r\ncomic personages were introduced to enliven the scene. As the dramatic\r\naction was thus brought nearer the comprehension of the unlearned,\r\nso the music departed from the oratorical standards of the early\r\nschool, and showed a frank _tendency toward melody_ and _regularity of\r\nform_. What was lost in elevation of theme, however, was made up by\r\nthe human interest imparted to the play and the consequent endeavor\r\nof the composer to express, by his music, the varying vicissitudes of\r\nlife. Thus it gained in warmth of feeling and flexibility in means of\r\nexpression, while the evolution of rhythmic melody and definite musical\r\nstructure laid the foundation of the art as we now have it.\r\n\r\n=The Venetian School=.—Venice naturally became the centre of an\r\nimportant development of the opera. Of the numerous composers forming\r\nthe Venetian school, =Francesco Cavalli= (1600-1676) and =Marco Cesti=\r\n(1620-1669) are second only in importance to Monteverde. The first was\r\nMonteverde’s pupil, and had much of his broad dramatic style modified\r\nby the influences of which we have just spoken. Cesti came to Venice\r\nfrom Rome, where he had been the pupil of Carissimi, and brought with\r\nhim the smoothness and melodic flow of his master, albeit lacking in\r\nessential power. Other names of a later date are =Giovanni Legrenzi=\r\n(1625-1690), especially noted for spirit and vivacity, and =Antonio\r\nLotti= (1667-1740), his pupil, known by one or two charming airs which\r\nstill survive.\r\n\r\n=Carissimi and the Oratorio=.—=Giovanni Carissimi= (1604-1674), though\r\nhe never wrote for the stage, was the strongest musical influence of\r\nhis day. He was an ardent admirer of the new school, and adapted it in\r\nthe form of oratorios and cantatas to the Church. In such works the\r\nnecessity for form as regards definite tonality, distinct rhythm and\r\nmelodic sequence is naturally much greater than in the Opera where\r\nmusic is used to illustrate the dramatic situation, and is furthermore\r\nelucidated by the action of the play. When the ear alone is obliged to\r\npass judgment there must be evidence of design in these particulars,\r\nelse the effect is confused and bewildering. Carissimi’s musical\r\ninstinct grasped this truth. His oratorios and cantatas show a logical\r\narrangement of choruses and ensembles, recitatives and arias combined\r\nwith a unity of effect and a clearness of characterization heretofore\r\nunknown. The choruses in particular are strongly rhythmic and far more\r\ndramatic than those which were commonly heard on the stage.\r\n\r\n[Music: FROM “JEPHTHA” BY CARISSIMI.]\r\n\r\n=Secularization of Church Music=.—This introduction of the new style\r\ninto the Church marked the passing of the old school and strongly\r\naffected methods of dramatic composition. The public had never been\r\nin sympathy with the austere standards of the Florentine school and\r\nwelcomed the appearance of _intelligible melody_ and the _spirited\r\nrhythms_ to which Carissimi gave the first direct impulse. Not only\r\nthis; he fixed the form that the music of the Church was to bear for\r\na century to come. This secularization of church music had its good\r\nand bad sides; good by reason of the greater freedom and variety\r\nof expression thus gained; bad because of the bold and mechanical\r\nimitation of Carissimi’s purely formal details by his successors, which\r\nin the end led to a tiresome monotony of style.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the Venetian School=.—Thus was taken the first\r\nstep toward the complete reversal of the conditions under which the\r\nearly Opera had arisen. Instead of the music’s being subordinate to\r\nthe drama, the drama was soon to serve merely as an excuse for the\r\nmusic; the opera was destined to sink to the level of a concert sung\r\nin costume; the dramatic action reduced to a minimum. The Venetian\r\nschool marks the turning-point in this direction. The high ideals\r\nof Monteverde and his predecessors were gradually thrust into the\r\nbackground; the singer began to assume precedence over the actor; truth\r\nof _expression yielded_ to the fascinations of _time_ and _tune_,\r\nwhich even the musically uncultivated could enjoy without bothering\r\ntheir heads as to real dramatic fitness. Closely connected with these\r\ntendencies was the establishment of a school of singing which, if we\r\nmay believe contemporary accounts, surpassed in technical facility and\r\nbrilliancy any vocal art heard either before or since that time. The\r\nresult was that singers finally regarded the opera only as a field for\r\nthe display of their dazzling accomplishments and in this they were\r\nwillingly supported by a public eager to be entertained and amused.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nApthorp.—The Opera, Past and Present.\r\n\r\nElson.—The History of Opera.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article on Opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho wrote the first oratorio?

Political disturbances had hindered\r\nthe spread of the Opera in southern Italy, particularly in Naples,\r\nbut at the end of the 17th century it assumed the position formerly\r\noccupied by Florence and Venice. Before this, however, a strong\r\ninfluence had been exerted by certain composers in Rome, of whom\r\nCarissimi was first in importance. Had it not been for the disapproval\r\nof the Church, a definite Roman school might have arisen. Such a school\r\nwould doubtless have been advantageous to the artistic growth of the\r\nOpera, since the public taste at Rome in matters of art was more\r\nserious in nature than at Naples. In 1697, public performances of opera\r\nwere forbidden by the ecclesiastical authorities, and thus the seat\r\nof further development was transferred to Naples through the removal\r\nthither from Rome of =Alessandro Scarlatti= (1659-1725), the founder of\r\nthe Neapolitan school. As a lad, he had been a pupil of Carissimi and\r\nalso probably of Legrenzi, whose influence is clearly seen in his early\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n=Alessandro Scarlatti=.—Scarlatti invested his operas with a melodic\r\ncharm and a symmetrical form which thus far had appeared only\r\nsporadically. Fascinated by the freedom of the new style, the early\r\ncomposers had neglected the severe study which had been indispensable\r\nto mastery in the Contrapuntal School, and had in the main relied on\r\nnatural gifts. Following the ideal of Peri and his associates, their\r\noperas were largely a succession of recitatives which in the end grew\r\nmonotonous and wearisome; of form, of structure, of purely musical\r\neffect they bore but slight traces. Scarlatti saw that the time had\r\ncome for a change in style—one that should combine the musical interest\r\nof the old with the dramatic spirit of the new. The foremost musician\r\nof his time, he perceived the weakness of the exclusively declamatory\r\nopera—its lack of variety and want of appeal to the public in general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALESSANDRO SCARLATTI.]\r\n\r\n=His Characteristics=.—He was not a reformer. He lacked the strong and\r\nrugged dramatic fibre of his predecessor, Monteverde. Scholarship;\r\nan inexhaustible fund of melody, pure, polished, refined; a gift of\r\ncharacterization—general, not particular, and always subordinate to a\r\nkeen sense of beauty—are his distinguishing characteristics. He fell\r\nin with the taste of the day and devoted his gifts to the production\r\nof works which should satisfy the musician and please the public. The\r\nsolidity of his early schooling had made him a master of counterpoint,\r\nand this he applied in the construction of logically worked-out\r\naccompaniments, fuller, richer and more expressive than had been\r\nattempted by his less learned contemporaries. In nobility of conception\r\nand skill in solving contrapuntal problems he often shows that he is\r\nnot unworthy the name of the “Italian Bach,” as he is sometimes called.\r\nLike Bach, also, he was one of the most prolific composers of all\r\ntimes. He left one hundred and fifteen operas, sixty-six of which are\r\nstill extant, more than two hundred masses, besides many miscellaneous\r\nworks for church and concert, both vocal and instrumental.\r\n\r\n=His Services to the Opera=.—To the simple recitative (recitativo\r\nsecco), invented by Peri, he added the important form known as the\r\n_recitativo stromentato_ (accompanied recitative). This was not\r\nstrictly original with Scarlatti, since it had been introduced by\r\nPurcell in his _Dido and Eneas_ ten years before the Italian had\r\nfirst used it in his opera _Rosaura_ (1690). There is no probability,\r\nhowever, that Scarlatti was acquainted with the Englishman’s works; it\r\nis a not uncommon matter for two minds to arrive independently at the\r\nsame result. In the accompanied recitative, the voice, instead of being\r\nsupported by detached (_secco_) chords on the harpsichord, sometimes\r\nwith the addition of a single stringed instrument, as in the simple\r\nrecitative, was accompanied by the entire orchestra, which had grown to\r\nproportions undreamed-of in Peri’s day. Vastly developed by the growth\r\nof orchestral resources, it is the distinguishing feature of the modern\r\nmusic drama. As a rule, however, it was but little used in Scarlatti’s\r\noperas or in those of his contemporaries. Interest in the drama, as\r\nsuch, was fast sinking to a negligible quantity; audiences assembled to\r\nhear their favorite singers, not to follow the course of a more or less\r\ninvolved dramatic action. The simple recitative was, therefore, more\r\nfrequently employed in order to hurry through the necessary details of\r\nthe play and reach the moment when the singer could delight by his art\r\nin the aria.\r\n\r\n[Music: AIR FROM SCARLATTI’S OPERA “TURNO ARICINO”.]\r\n\r\n=The Aria=.—Scarlatti was not the inventor of the aria or air for\r\nthe single voice in the meaning of the term as applied to a certain\r\nfixed form. Other composers had used it before him in its essential\r\nprinciples, but he was the _first_ to _formulate_ it into a persistent\r\n_type_, which it retained for nearly a century, despite its undramatic\r\ncharacter. The Scarlatti aria consisted of three parts: two contrasting\r\nsections, concluding with a Da Capo or repetition of the first,\r\nexpressed by the formula A B A. The principle of Repetition as an\r\nelement of form is now a commonplace, but at the time it was a novelty,\r\nand the emphasis given to it by the aria fascinated the public and\r\nmade it the principal feature of the opera. More than anything else,\r\nit led to its degeneration. Singers found in the aria a means of\r\ndisplaying their technical skill; it became the canvas on which they\r\nembroidered the most astonishing _tours de force_. The art of acting\r\nalmost disappeared from the operatic stage; the poise of body and voice\r\nrequired for such vocal efforts banished all but a few conventional\r\ngestures.\r\n\r\n=The Overture=.—Scarlatti’s powers were by no means confined to writing\r\nfor the voice; the instrumental portions of his works give evidence\r\nof equal mastery, though the popular taste for singing allowed him\r\nbut little scope for extension in this direction. His overtures in\r\nparticular show a great advance over the simple preludes of the early\r\nItalian operas. He perfected what is known as the Italian Overture in\r\ncontradistinction to the earlier form invented by Lully, and called\r\nthe French Overture. It consisted of three movements, the first and\r\nlast quick, the middle movement slow. In its arrangement, this was the\r\ndirect precursor of the modern symphony. At first the two terms were\r\ninterchangeable; an overture when played before an opera was called\r\na _Sinfonia_, and curiously enough, when played independently as a\r\nconcert number it was frequently called an overture. Some of the early\r\nsymphonies were even printed with one title outside and the other\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n=The Typical Italian Opera=.—Thus at the beginning of the 18th century\r\nwe find the Opera on an overwhelmingly musical basis instead of\r\nthe oratorical foundation which it had in its inception. Scarlatti\r\nfixed its form for a century. He left it consisting principally of\r\nrecitatives and arias, each opera containing from fifty to sixty of\r\nthe latter. Aside from these there was but little formal music—only an\r\noccasional march or dance besides the overture. The simple recitative\r\nwas used for ordinary dialogue; hence it was peculiarly applicable\r\nto the _Opera Buffa_ (comic opera). The accompanied recitative was\r\nreserved for situations of dramatic importance, and the aria served\r\nto express individual emotion. The chorus was employed but sparingly,\r\ngenerally appearing only at the end of the act to give greater eclat to\r\nthe finale. The dance, which in the early Opera had played a part of\r\nsome importance, was finally banished entirely from the scene, though\r\nnot from the stage. It was given between the acts as an intermezzo\r\n(interlude), and thus developed into the formal ballet. Spectacular\r\nfeatures, too, assumed great prominence.\r\n\r\n=The Intermezzo=.—The Intermezzo has a close connection with the opera.\r\nIt arose from the custom of introducing something _between the acts_ of\r\na play or opera to entertain the audience during the necessary period\r\nof waiting. At first, songs or madrigals were sung, then by degrees\r\nthe entertainment took on a dramatic form, until at last a drama was\r\ngiven totally independent of the principal play. Singularly enough,\r\nthe acts of the two plays were performed alternately, neither having\r\nany connection with the other. The Intermezzo was always of a gayer,\r\nlighter character; thus when the incongruity of the practice became\r\napparent, it naturally evolved into the _Opera Buffa_. This was brought\r\nabout by the success of the most celebrated comic opera ever written,\r\n_La Serva Padrona_ (The Maid as Mistress), by =Giovanni Pergolesi=\r\n(1710-1736). This was originally produced (1734) as an Intermezzo\r\nbetween the acts of another play, and afterward made a triumphant\r\nprogress through all the opera houses in Europe as an independent work.\r\n\r\n=The Opera Buffa=.—Though for the sake of contrast, comic characters\r\nhad been introduced into the opera during the early Venetian period,\r\nthe _Opera Buffa_ did not reach its full development until the\r\nfollowing century. Owing to the absence of certain conventions which\r\nhad grown around the _Opera Seria_ (serious opera) it became a more\r\ncharacteristic mode of expression than the latter. Its melodies were\r\nfresher, its dramatic action was less restrained and truer to life,\r\nwhile it performed a valuable service by doing away with the strange\r\nmingling of comic and serious styles which had previously disfigured\r\nmany otherwise impressive works. To it we owe the concerted Finale\r\nwhich is such a feature of modern grand opera. It is attributed\r\nto =Niccolo Logroscino= (1700-1763), who instead of the customary\r\nconclusion of an act by a simple duet, trio, or quartet, brought all\r\nthe _Dramatis Personæ_ on the stage to take part in a characteristic\r\nensemble. Greatly developed by later composers, such finales were for a\r\nlong time confined to _Opera Buffa_, until Paisiello finally introduced\r\nthem into serious opera.\r\n\r\n=Prominent Composers of the Neapolitan School=.—It is hardly possible\r\nto mention more than a few of the numerous composers belonging to the\r\nNeapolitan school. Besides Pergolesi, the most important works of\r\nthis school were composed by =Niccolo Porpora= (1685-1767), =Niccolo\r\nJommelli= (1714-1774), =Niccolo Piccini= (1728-1800), =Giovanni\r\nPaisiello= (1741-1816) and =Domenico Cimarosa= (1749-1801). Most of\r\nthese were equally at home in the _Opera Seria_ and the _Opera Buffa_,\r\nbut their works in the latter style have proved the more enduring.\r\n\r\nPorpora is more noteworthy for the singers he formed than for his\r\nforty-six operas, all of which have sunk into oblivion. He was the\r\ngreatest of the many masters of singing who through their pupils\r\nmade the Opera of the 18th century the field of display for the most\r\nremarkable singers the world has ever heard. Jommelli was one of the\r\nmost gifted composers of his day. He spent fifteen years in Germany\r\nas capellmeister to the Duke of Wurtemburg, but the influence of this\r\nlong residence in a country where musical ideals were of a more austere\r\ntype than in Italy, though it added dignity and solidity to his art,\r\nwas fatal to his popularity when he returned to his native land; his\r\ncountrymen found his operas heavy in style and deficient in melody.\r\nPiccini was the composer of the most popular _Opera Buffa_ of the\r\ncentury, _Cecchina_, but is now remembered principally by the bitter\r\nfeud which arose in Paris in 1787 between his admirers and those of\r\nGluck. Paisiello’s most celebrated work was _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_\r\n(The Barber of Seville), which held the stage for thirty years until\r\nthe success of Rossini’s masterpiece on the same subject forced it into\r\nretirement. Cimarosa’s _Il Matrimonio Segreto_ (The Secret Marriage)\r\nwas an equal favorite; one of its numbers, the trio for women’s voices,\r\n_Ti Faccio un Inchino_ (I make thee a reverence), sometimes appears on\r\nmodern programs.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Neapolitan School=.—Notwithstanding the formalism\r\nof the Neapolitan school, which led to a regrettable neglect of the\r\ndramatic signification of the Opera by an over-emphasis of its musical\r\nelement, it was of no small importance in the development of music in\r\ngeneral. By fixing the principles of form and melody at a time when\r\nboth were vague and undetermined, Scarlatti laid the foundation of the\r\ngreat classical period, beginning with Haydn and Mozart and ending with\r\nBeethoven. This was his contribution to absolute music, which cannot\r\nexist without form, though its influence was disastrous to purity of\r\nform in the branch of the art which he particularly cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nDent.—Alessandro Scarlatti: His Life and Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhich Italian city now became the centre of operatic development?\r\n\r\nWho was the founder of this new school?\r\n\r\nTell about his style and training.\r\n\r\nWhat did he contribute to the development of the Opera?\r\n\r\nDescribe the Aria.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Overture.\r\n\r\nDescribe a typical Italian Opera.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Intermezzo.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Opera Buffa.\r\n\r\nWho were the prominent composers of the Neapolitan school?\r\n\r\nWhat was the influence of this school?\r\n\r\nThe period of Scarlatti’s work extends approximately from the English\r\nRevolution of 1688, which drove James II from the throne, to the end of\r\nthe reign of George I. In American Colonial history this period is one\r\nof gathering strength in the various provinces on the Atlantic Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON XX.\r\n\r\n                          SINGING AND SINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Methods of Singing=.—As has been noted by the reader, music,\r\nup to this time, developed principally along vocal lines. We have\r\nno details as to the character of the training of singers among the\r\nChaldeans, Egyptians and Greeks except such as indicate that their idea\r\nof singing was a sort of musical declamation. Such seems also to have\r\nbeen the idea of the nations in the north of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Welsh bards were required to undergo a very\r\nthorough and exacting course of study, but the practical side of\r\nsinging and the rules laid down for the training of the young minstrels\r\nis not a part of our knowledge. The songs of the early Church, sung by\r\nmasses of worshipers, were of necessity simple in every way, requiring\r\nno art. It was not until the use of Discant became popular, and the\r\nPolyphonic school began to use florid writing that we can infer that\r\nthere must have been some methods of training vocalists for artistic\r\nwork. Although we have little or no details as to the course of\r\ntraining which the early singers received, we are justified in assuming\r\nthat they must have possessed skill in execution of no mean order. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that practically all the composers of the early\r\nPolyphonic school were singers, able to execute their own works. Hence,\r\nstudies in singing must have gone hand in hand with composition. The\r\nvoice parts of the masses, motets and madrigals of the composers of the\r\n13th to the 16th centuries have absolute independence of progression,\r\nsyncopations, embellishments, etc., to such an extent that it taxes\r\nthe musicianship of the chorus singer of the present day to sing them;\r\nthey are not only exacting in intonation, rhythm and other musical\r\nmatters but also in mechanical points, such as flexibility and freedom\r\nof voice and thorough breath control.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Opera on Singing=.—When the Opera was established,\r\nafter the declamatory style offered by the first composers had proven\r\nunsuccessful in holding the public, the florid style of the old\r\ndiscanters was revived and modified, which, as the Opera developed,\r\ngave a great impetus to a systematic and thorough study of singing.\r\nThe new style of melody introduced by the opera composers of the 17th\r\ncentury demanded purity of voice, wide range, flexibility, expressive\r\nshading and a marvelous breath control, as well as great physical\r\nendurance. Singers were expected to execute the most intricate\r\npassages, abounding in diatonic and chromatic scales, arpeggios, turns,\r\ngruppettos, trills, etc., of the most elaborate nature, passages such\r\nas are considered purely instrumental today. =Alessandro Scarlatti=,\r\nthe composer, and himself a singer, is credited with having had much\r\nto do with the great development in the art of singing. He trained a\r\nnumber of singers and pupils, and thus founded the “old Italian” school\r\nof singing. It was natural that the art side of singing should thus\r\ndevelop in Italy for several reasons, notably, because Italy had a\r\ngreat number of highly-trained composers, the character of the language\r\nis such as to lend itself to the requirements of artistic singing,\r\nbroad full vowels, soft consonants, absence of final consonants, etc.,\r\nand the enthusiastic, essentially lyric temperament of the race.\r\n\r\n=The Training of a 17th Century Singer=.—We are given an idea of the\r\ncourse of training which singers of the 17th century were obliged to\r\nobserve in a work _Historia Musica_, published by G. A. A. Buontempi,\r\nin 1695. This contains an account of the regulations of a school for\r\nsingers in Rome, directed by Virgilio Mazzocchi, in which Buontempi was\r\na pupil: The pupils were obliged to devote one hour each day to the\r\nsinging of difficult passages with the idea of acquiring experience;\r\none hour to the practice of the trill, one to passages in agility, one\r\nto literary studies, one to vocalises and to various other technical\r\nexercises under the direction of a teacher and before a mirror to\r\nacquire the certainty that the singer did not make a faulty movement of\r\nthe face, the forehead, the eyes or the mouth. This was the morning’s\r\nwork. In the afternoon, a half-hour was given to theory study, the same\r\namount to writing counterpoint on plain-song melodies, then to learning\r\nand applying the rules of composition (writing on an erasable sheet);\r\nthen followed a half-hour of study of a literary nature, and the rest\r\nof the day was given to practice on the clavichord, to the composition\r\nof a psalm, motet, canzonetta, or any other kind of piece according to\r\nthe pupil’s choice. Such were the common exercises of those days when\r\nthe pupils were kept on duty at the school. On other days, they would\r\ngo outside the Angelica Gate to sing against the famous echo that was\r\nfound there, listening to the response in order to criticise their\r\nwork. Other duties were to sing in nearly all the musical solemnities\r\nof the various churches, to study attentively the style of the great\r\nsingers of the day, to make a report of their observations to their\r\nmaster, who, the better to impress the result of their studies upon the\r\nminds of his pupils, added remarks and advice as he deemed necessary.\r\nUnder such discipline it is not astonishing that the Italian singers\r\nattained a high degree of excellence, and became not only distinguished\r\nsingers but skilful composers as well. That the reader may gather an\r\nidea of the character of passages executed by these singers an example\r\nis given on the previous page.\r\n\r\n[Music: AIR for BASS\r\n\r\nFROM A “MISERERE” BY DENTICE, END OF 16TH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\n=Growth of the Florid Style=.—As the art of singing developed, the\r\nsingers increased their capricious embellishments. With the idea of\r\nsecuring brilliancy as well as the hope of winning success for their\r\nworks, composers yielded to the exactions of singers and the depraved\r\ntaste of the dilettanti. This explains the seemingly endless vocalizing\r\nand those passages of pure agility which crowd the scores of the best\r\nItalian masters of the 17th and 18th centuries. Before giving some\r\naccount of the famous singers of the old Italian school it will be\r\ninteresting to have a few notes upon a work on vocal music which bears\r\nupon the matter of execution.\r\n\r\n=A Work on Singing=.—In 1725, =Pier Francesco Tosi=, a renowned singer\r\n(born about 1650, died 1730), published a work, translated into\r\nEnglish, and published in 1742 under the title “Observations on the\r\nFlorid Song, or Sentiments of the Ancient and Modern Singers,” which\r\ncontains some interesting and valuable statements for the student of\r\nthe history of the art of singing. The most minute principles are set\r\nforth with much grace and spirit, in all cases showing enthusiasm on\r\nthe part of the author for his art and a high sense of the dignity of\r\nthe profession of singing. When the discussion is in regard to certain\r\nkinds of passages in which the singer was accustomed to improvise\r\nornaments, Tosi demands the union of five qualities: intelligence,\r\ninvention, meter (rhythm), mechanism (technic) and taste; and in\r\naddition, other qualities which he calls “secondary and auxiliary\r\ngraces”: the appoggiatura, the trill, the portamento di voce, phrasing.\r\nThis work by Tosi and one by Marcello entitled _Le Theatre à la Mode_\r\nthrow much light on the execution of the vocal music of the 18th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n=Seventeenth Century Singers=.—=Baldassare Ferri= (1610-1680) was\r\none of the most renowned of the male sopranos of the old school. His\r\nvoice had the greatest agility and facility, perfect intonation,\r\na brilliant shake or trill and his breath supply seemed to be\r\ninexhaustible. In regard to his intonation, it is said that he was\r\nable to ascend and descend in one breath a two-octave scale with\r\na continuous trill without accompaniment with such perfection of\r\nintonation that when he finished he had not varied a shade from the\r\npitch of his starting-note. He was in high favor in the courts of\r\nPoland, Germany, Sweden and England. A medal was struck in his honor.\r\n=Antonio Bernacchi= (1690-1756) was a pupil of =Pistocchi= (1659-1720),\r\nthe most celebrated teacher in Italy at this time, whose principles\r\nare represented in Tosi’s book. He commenced his career early and\r\nappeared in opera in Italy, later in England and Germany. After some\r\nyears of experience with the public taste he altered his style, making\r\ngreat use of the florid style, a veritable embroidery of roulades, an\r\ninnovation that was so successful as to be immediately followed by\r\nother singers in spite of the protests of the older school of singers.\r\nIt is related that when Pistocchi heard his former pupil, he said:\r\n“Ah! woe is me! I taught thee to sing and now thou wilt play!” He sang\r\nin Handel’s opera company in London, 1729-30. He then returned to\r\nItaly to take up the career of a teacher and brought out a number of\r\nfine singers. =Francesco Bernardi Senesino= (1680-1750) was a great\r\nfavorite in England, where he sang in Handel’s operas. His voice was\r\nexceptionally fine in quality, clear, penetrating and flexible, his\r\ntechnic remarkable; his style was marked by purity, simplicity and\r\nexpressiveness, and his delivery of recitative was famous over all\r\nEurope. The name of Niccolo Porpora was mentioned in connection with\r\nthe opera as a celebrated singing master as well as composer. No\r\nsingers before or since have sung like his pupils, notably Caffarelli\r\nand Farinelli.\r\n\r\n=Gaetano Majorano Caffarelli= (1703-1783)—the reader will note that\r\nmany of the old school of musicians lived to a ripe old age—was the son\r\nof a Neapolitan peasant, who tried to repress the boy’s evident musical\r\ninclinations. Cafaro, director of the Chapel Royal, at Naples, chanced\r\nto hear him sing and succeeded in getting charge of him and gave him\r\nhis elementary instruction, which was followed by instruction from\r\nPorpora, who was then living in Naples. Porpora was a most exacting\r\nteacher, requiring implicit obedience and unceasing practice. The story\r\nis told that Porpora kept Caffarelli for five or six years to the\r\nunvaried study of a single page of exercises despite the pupil’s most\r\nstrenuous objections. At the end of the time, when Caffarelli declared\r\nhe would submit no longer, the old teacher said: “Go, my son. I have\r\nnothing more to teach you. You are the greatest singer in Europe.”\r\nWhen he first appeared in opera he sang female parts, for which his\r\nbeautiful face was well-suited. Some years later he took men’s parts.\r\nHe gained great popularity in the leading cities of Europe and amassed\r\nan enormous fortune. He excelled in slow and pathetic airs, yet he was\r\nmost admirable in the bravura style, and his technic in the trill and\r\nchromatic scales was unapproached by any other singer of his time. He\r\nwas fond of introducing chromatic passages in quick movements.\r\n\r\n=Farinelli= (1705-1782), whose real name was Carlo Broschi, was a\r\npupil of Porpora. He made his first public appearance in Rome when\r\nhe was seventeen years old. It was on this occasion that he sang the\r\nfamous aria with trumpet obligato, written by his master, a piece which\r\nbecame so associated with him as to be demanded at all his concerts.\r\nIn this piece, trumpet and voice vie with each other in holding and\r\nswelling a note of extraordinary length and volume; when the trumpeter\r\nhad exhausted his breath Farinelli kept on with increased power and\r\nended with a great vocal display. This aria called for wonderful\r\nvocal technic owing to the novelty and difficulty of the trills and\r\nvariations introduced. In 1727, he engaged in a musical duel with\r\nBernacchi, previously referred to, in which he was conquered. As a\r\nresult of this he placed himself under Bernacchi’s instruction, and\r\nthus perfected his wonderful talent. In 1731, at the suggestion of the\r\nEmperor Charles VI, he modified his style and devoted study to the\r\nmastery of pathos and simplicity. During his public career he won the\r\ngreatest possible success in the European capitals and passed the last\r\nyears of his life in wealth. Mancini, a fellow-pupil of Farinelli and\r\nlater a famous singing master, says of Farinelli’s voice: “It was so\r\nperfect, so powerful, so sonorous and so rich in its extent, both in\r\nthe high and the low parts of the register, that its equal has never\r\nbeen heard in our time.... The art of taking and keeping the breath\r\nso softly and easily that no one could perceive it began and ended\r\nwith him. The qualities in which he excelled were the evenness of his\r\nvoice, the art of swelling its sound, the portamento, the union of the\r\nregisters, a surprising agility, a graceful and pathetic style and a\r\nshake as admirable as it was rare.”\r\n\r\nA few other singers of this class may be mentioned: Giacchino Conti,\r\ncalled =Gizziello= (1714-1761), =Giovanni Carestini= (1705-1758?)\r\na contralto, =Giuseppe Boschi=, the most celebrated basso of the\r\n18th century, one of Handel’s singers, and =Girolamo Crescentini=\r\n(1766-1846). So much space has been given to these singers because\r\ntheir work laid the principles for vocal training that have ever since\r\nbeen the foundation upon which the great masters and singers of later\r\ntimes have built their art; to these principles has been given the name\r\nof the old Italian School of Singing.\r\n\r\n=Ill-effect of Virtuosity=.—The student who goes fully into the subject\r\nof the relation of singers to the opera will find that the great\r\ndevelopment of virtuosity among singers exerted an ill-effect and\r\ncalled forth a very pronounced reform in which Gluck was the leader.\r\nSingers were capable of such great vocal display, and the public showed\r\nso much enthusiasm for the brilliant feats of vocalism, and so great\r\nwas the rivalry between singers and their partisans that composers vied\r\nwith each other in their efforts to introduce the most difficult and\r\nflorid passages possible. The text of an aria had no real value and\r\nbecame merely a vehicle upon which to place the dazzling vocalization\r\nof the singer. Dramatic truth was ruthlessly sacrificed. A singer,\r\nsupposed to be in the very throes of death, would give a virtuosic\r\ndisplay that would tax the lung power of a man in the most perfect\r\nphysical condition. Gluck’s reform consisted in requiring that the\r\narias should express the emotions suited to the situation, thus calling\r\nfor expressive singing, not mere vocal display. The history of the\r\nopera and singing since then shows periods of change toward one idea or\r\nthe other until the principles of Richard Wagner as to dramatic truth\r\nwere generally accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on the singers\r\nmentioned in this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat circumstances show that the church singers of the 13th to 16th\r\ncenturies must have had considerable skill in singing?\r\n\r\nWhat was the influence of the opera on singing?\r\n\r\nWhat was the course of training required of young singers in the 17th\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\nWhat important work on singing dates from the early part of the 18th\r\ncentury?

Princes and kings, eager to hear the new style of\r\nmusic, held out golden inducements to Italian composers and singers to\r\ncome to their courts; it was generally thought that none but an Italian\r\ncould compose an opera or sing an aria. The consequence was that in\r\nalmost all countries during the 18th century the prevailing musical\r\ninfluence was Italian; native composers and singers were obliged to\r\nstudy Italian models if they wished to attain to popular favor. In\r\nFrance, however, this influence was only sufficient to _modify_ without\r\nobscuring the features of an essentially national school. Independence\r\nin matters of art has always been a marked characteristic of the\r\nFrench; they have led rather than followed. The most distinguished\r\nnames in the history of French opera have been those of foreign birth,\r\nbut whatever their nationalities, all give evidence of the effect\r\nexerted upon them by the definite form, the clearness of dramatic\r\nintention demanded by the canons of French taste.\r\n\r\n=Origin of French Opera=.—As the Italian opera was derived from the\r\nclassical tragedy, so the _French opera_ had its _origin_ in the\r\n_Ballet_, the favorite form of amusement in France. The French Ballet\r\nof the 17th century was by no means confined to the dance; it was a\r\nheterogeneous mingling of dances and dialogues, songs and choruses,\r\ncorresponding to the English Masque. Like the early operas in Italy,\r\ntheir spectacular features were on a large and expensive scale, which\r\nconfined them to occasions of especial festivity at court or among\r\nthe nobility. The taste for dancing had much to do with the direction\r\ntaken by the opera in France; it is still characteristic of the French\r\nschool, as is shown by the prominent place given to the ballet in the\r\nGrand Opera.\r\n\r\n=Lully=.—The founder of the French school, =Jean Baptiste Lully=\r\n(1633-1687), was Italian by birth, but at the age of thirteen he was\r\ntaken from his native city, Florence, to France, as a page in the\r\nservice of the Chevalier de Guise. His musical gifts soon won him a\r\nplace in the royal band and finally the post of court composer. He\r\nfirst wrote ballets in which the King (Louis XIV) himself danced, and\r\nlater turned his attention to the opera.\r\n\r\n=Italian Opera in France=.—Italian opera had already been heard in\r\nFrance. Through Cardinal Mazarin, an opera company from Venice had\r\nvisited Paris in 1645, and two years later Peri’s _Euridice_ had been\r\ngiven also by a Venetian troupe; but these and later performances had\r\naroused no attempts at imitation by French composers. They contented\r\nthemselves with writing ballets which were performed as intermezzos\r\nbetween the acts of Italian operas in order to bring them nearer the\r\nFrench standards of taste. The superior vocal ability of the Italians\r\nwas acknowledged, but the lack of rhythmic form in their music made\r\nan unfavorable impression. The king was passionately fond of dancing;\r\nhe and his courtiers frequently took part in the ballets produced at\r\ncourt, hence the interest lay in the drama as illustrated by the dance\r\nrather than by song.\r\n\r\n=Beginning of French Opera=.—The first French opera to receive public\r\nperformance was _Pomone_ (Pomona), in 1671, by =Robert Cambert=\r\n(1628-1677), who had previously written several others which had been\r\nperformed only in private. It awakened much more interest than the\r\nItalian operas which thus far had been heard in Paris, and incited\r\nLully to the composition of his first opera, _Les Fêtes de l’Amour\r\net Bacchus_ (The Feasts of Love and Bacchus), which was produced the\r\nfollowing year. From that time until his death he composed fifteen\r\noperas, which determined the form of French opera for practically a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of Lully’s Operas=.—Lully’s operas, like those of the\r\nFlorentine school, were on the whole _declamatory_ in style, and like\r\nthem their subjects were generally taken from classical mythology.\r\nThey are destitute of the sustained melody which appeared somewhat\r\nlater in the Neapolitan school; but the recitatives are so skilfully\r\nvaried in rhythm and show such intimate knowledge of the genius of the\r\nFrench language that in dramatic effect they are far superior to those\r\nof the earlier school. To the overture, the ballet, the chorus, he\r\nassigned music of a different type, rhythmic and formal in nature, thus\r\nrelieving the monotony of an exclusively declamatory style. A master\r\nof stagecraft, his operas abounded in cunningly-devised spectacles and\r\noriginal scenic effects which excited wonder and held the attention. In\r\nshort, so far as the means of the times allowed, we find in the Lully\r\noperas the well-considered balance between the musical and dramatic\r\nelements still characteristic of the French school.\r\n\r\n=The French Overture=.—One of Lully’s greatest services was the\r\nelaboration of the Overture into a larger and more dignified form.\r\nThe Italians had never paid much attention to the overture. At first\r\nit appeared only as a _brief instrumental prelude_, sometimes but a\r\nfew measures in length. The introduction to Monteverde’s _Orfeo_, for\r\nexample, consists of only nine measures which the composer directs\r\nto be played over three times to serve as overture. Later it was\r\nsomewhat _extended_ in length and provided with some regularity of\r\ndesign, but the Overture as a fixed form dates from Lully. It began\r\nwith an impressive slow movement, followed by an Allegro in fugue\r\nstyle. Sometimes this was all; but it generally concluded with another\r\nslow movement, often one of the stately, dignified dance tunes of the\r\nday, and often merely a repetition of the Introduction. This form was\r\nknown as the French Overture, and was soon adopted by composers of all\r\nnationalities. About the middle of the 18th century it was supplanted\r\nby the Italian Overture, perfected by Scarlatti, and described in\r\nLesson XIX.\r\n\r\n=The Prologue=.—The overture was commonly followed by a Prologue.\r\nThis had nothing to do with the action of the drama; it introduced\r\nmythological and allegorical characters who danced and sang, often\r\npaying the most fulsome adulation to the king, who was compared to the\r\nmost celebrated heroes of mythology and antiquity. After the prologue,\r\neither the overture was repeated, or another and a shorter one was\r\nplayed. This pseudo-classical type of opera naturally flourished in the\r\nartificial atmosphere of the court on which it was dependent for favor.\r\nIt lasted until the time of Gluck, when the influences which led to the\r\ngreat uprising of the people in the latter part of the 18th century\r\nswept it away with other traditions and conventions.\r\n\r\n=Rameau=.—Until we come to =Jean Philippe Rameau= (1683-1764), none of\r\nLully’s successors succeeded in definitely extending the limits he had\r\nfixed. Rameau had won the name of the first theoretician of the day,\r\nand was a man of fifty when his first opera, _Hippolyte et Aricie_, was\r\nproduced. Even he made no essential change in the scheme established by\r\nLully beyond greatly enlarging the sphere of the orchestra, originating\r\nnovel rhythms and bolder harmonies. This was, however, a long step\r\nin advance, since it saved the opera from sinking to the level of a\r\ndull, mechanical imitation of Lully’s methods, into which contemporary\r\ncomposers had fallen.\r\n\r\n=The English School=.—Italian music, in the form of the Madrigal, had\r\nbeen popular in England since the time of its introduction in 1598,\r\nby =Thomas Morley= (1557-1604). Native composers immediately took it\r\ninto favor, a favor it has never lost; madrigals are still composed and\r\nsung in England, though elsewhere the form has been dead for nearly\r\ntwo centuries. The declamatory opera of the early Italian school,\r\nhowever, never took root. It was, as we have seen, primarily a drama in\r\nwhich music played a secondary part, and as such it was far too crude\r\nand lacking in human interest to appeal to a public accustomed to the\r\nplays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and whose taste in music,\r\nmoreover, was rather for melody than for recitative. Then, during the\r\nProtectorate, the Puritanical spirit which led to the destruction of\r\nchurch organs and for a time forbade all theatrical performances proved\r\nan insuperable obstacle to any development of dramatic music.\r\n\r\n=The First English Operas=.—In 1656, Sir William Davenant, the\r\nplaywright and theatrical manager, evaded this prohibition by\r\nintroducing music into his plays and calling them operas. Much of\r\nthis music, which was in the form of incidental songs, choruses and\r\ninstrumental interludes, was written by =Henry Lawes= (1595-1662) and\r\n=Matthew Lock= (——d. 1677). The latter is well known for his music to\r\n“Macbeth,” which up to within a few years was not infrequently heard\r\nin performances of the tragedy. These so-called operas had little or\r\nno effect on the development of a native school. They are principally\r\nnoteworthy in being the first English operas and the first theatrical\r\nperformances in England in which women appeared on the stage.\r\nPreviously the parts of women had been played by boys.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the French School=.—At the Restoration in 1660, Charles\r\nII found the prevailing style of music in England but little to his\r\ntaste. Fond of the gay measures and lively dances of the French opera,\r\nin 1664 he sent =Pelham Humfrey= (1647-1674), the most talented of\r\nthe boys forming the choir in the Chapel Royal, to Paris to study\r\nwith Lully. Three years later he returned, and became the teacher of\r\nEngland’s greatest composer.\r\n\r\n=Henry Purcell=.—This was =Henry Purcell= (1658-1695), one of a family\r\nof musicians of whom he stands first. As a child he is said to have\r\ncomposed anthems while a chorister in the Chapel Royal, and at the\r\nage of twenty-two he composed his first opera, _Dido and Eneas_, a\r\nmost remarkable work for a youth of his years. It is the only one of\r\nhis dramatic works in which there is _no spoken dialogue_, its place\r\nbeing supplied by recitative, and therefore, strictly speaking, it\r\nwas his only opera. He can never have seen an opera of this type;\r\nhis acquaintance with the new style must have been largely based on\r\nwhat Humfrey had told him of such performances in Paris, though it is\r\npossible that he had the opportunity of studying Lully’s scores. In its\r\nunion of dramatic feeling and characterization with depth of musical\r\nresource, _Dido and Eneas_ was far in advance of anything that had\r\nyet appeared in France or Italy. Though it shows the influence of the\r\nFrench school, the sturdy English character which distinguishes all of\r\nPurcell’s music is plainly apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY PURCELL.]\r\n\r\n=Purcell’s Dramatic Works=.—It was followed by a large number of works\r\nfor the stage, but these were in the main merely incidental music for\r\ndramas; among them Shakespeare’s “Tempest,” “Midsummer Night’s Dream”\r\n(known as The Fairy Queen), Dryden’s “King Arthur,” the last being the\r\nmost important and extended in form. Unfortunately, many of them have\r\nbeen lost; but enough remain to show that in Purcell’s early death\r\nEngland lost the most original musical genius she ever possessed. He\r\nfounded a distinctly national school which, for the lack of a successor\r\nof equal gifts, was destined to succumb to foreign influences.\r\n\r\n=Their Characteristics=.—His melodies bear the freshness and\r\nspontaneity of the English Folk-song at a period when music was\r\ngenerally cultivated, before civil wars and religious bigotry had\r\ncrushed the art spirit which, during the 16th century, had made the\r\nEnglish people the leaders in musical progress. His recitatives show\r\na vigor and an intuitive perception of dramatic effect unsurpassed by\r\nany of his contemporaries on the Continent. He was an accomplished\r\ncontrapuntist and applied his knowledge of counterpoint with admirable\r\nresults to sacred music, yet never allowed it to become obtrusive in\r\nhis dramatic works. In these clear, expressive melody and vigorous\r\ndeclamation were the distinguishing features; his learning served only\r\nto secure a natural flow of the one and an appropriate setting for the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n=The Masque=.—The precursor of the English opera was the Masque. Like\r\nthe French Ballet, this was a dramatic entertainment consisting of\r\ndialogues, dances, songs, and choruses. The subject was allegorical or\r\nmythical in nature and the mounting of the most elaborate description.\r\nThe leading poets and dramatists of the day wrote many masques. The\r\nmost famous was Milton’s “Masque of Comus,” the music by Lawes, which\r\nwas performed at Ludlow Castle in 1634. The music in these masques\r\nwas at first designed merely to give variety to what was in the main\r\na pleasure to the eye, but Purcell relieved it of this subordinate\r\ncharacter by investing it with a weight and authority which made it an\r\nintegral factor in the dramatic expression.\r\n\r\n=Typical English Opera=.—He thus fixed the form of the _English opera_\r\nas a _play with songs, choruses, ensembles_, etc., connected by _spoken\r\ndialogue_ instead of recitatives. The music, therefore, instead of\r\ncarrying on the action, is confined to the more quiet situations of\r\nthe drama, such as are naturally adapted to lyrical expression. The\r\ninflexibility of this form has doubtless had much to do with the\r\nlack of development in the English School of Opera compared with the\r\nremarkable growth of other schools which have abandoned the union of\r\nthe spoken with the sung word in the serious opera.\r\n\r\n=The Ballad Opera=.—The only characteristic creation of the English\r\nschool is the Ballad Opera. This had its origin in “The Beggar’s\r\nOpera,” produced in 1728. Slight in texture, it was simply a play\r\nwith songs set to the most popular ballad tunes of the day. Its\r\nextraordinary success in the face of the financial failure of Italian\r\nopera left no doubt as to the real taste of the English people, and\r\nwas decisive as to the direction taken by later composers, such as\r\n=Sir Henry Bishop= (1786-1855), =Michael Balfe= (1808-1870), =Arthur\r\nSullivan= (1842-1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nDavy.—History of English Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat circumstances attended the spread of the Italian Opera?\r\n\r\nWhich European country was the next to take up Opera?\r\n\r\nWho was the founder of this new school?\r\n\r\nWhat efforts had been made prior to his appearance?\r\n\r\nDescribe Lully’s opera form.\r\n\r\nDescribe the French Overture.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Prologue.\r\n\r\nWho was Lully’s successor?\r\n\r\nWhat prevented the spread of the principles of the early Italian Opera\r\nin England?\r\n\r\nGive names of men connected with the early history of Opera in England.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Purcell and his works.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Masque?\r\n\r\nDescribe the typical English Opera.

HANDEL AND GLUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Opera in Germany=.—The introduction of the opera into Germany dates\r\nfrom 1627. In that year a German translation of Rinuccini’s _Dafne_,\r\nwhich, it will be remembered, was the text of Peri’s first opera, was\r\nset to music by =Heinrich Schuetz= (1585-1672) and performed on the\r\noccasion of the wedding of the Landgraf of Hesse. Schütz, who also\r\ncomposed the first German oratorio, _Die Auferstehung Christi_ (The\r\nResurrection of Christ), had been sent by the Landgraf to study in\r\nItaly in 1609, only two years after the production of Monteverde’s\r\n_Orfeo_. The score of his _Dafne_ has been lost, but it was doubtless\r\nin accordance with the principles of the Florentine school. The Thirty\r\nYears’ War and its lamentable consequences prevented any immediate\r\ndevelopment of the new form. Occasional productions of Italian\r\nopera were given in several German cities, but it was not until the\r\nestablishment of the Hamburg opera late in the century that the new\r\nmusical movement gained a permanent footing in Germany. Even then its\r\npopularization proceeded but slowly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEINRICH SCHUETZ.]\r\n\r\n=German Composers Barred=.—It is true that not long after the beginning\r\nof the 18th century, great interest was manifested in Italian opera\r\nat a number of courts, Berlin and Dresden in particular, but this had\r\n_no influence_ in the formation of a _national school_. Its effect\r\nindeed was the exact contrary. Singers and composers were brought from\r\nItaly; among the cultivated classes opera in German was considered a\r\nbarbarism, so that native musicians met with little or no encouragement\r\nin this field. They were obliged to write their operas to an Italian\r\ntext if they wished a hearing for them; the Church alone was freely\r\nopen to German composers. The Church, too, was the only place where\r\nthe people could hear music; public concerts were unknown and, save at\r\nHamburg, the opera could be heard only by invitation to those who had\r\nentrée to court circles. This led to the remarkable activity in the\r\nproduction of sacred music which is such a feature of that period. This\r\nalso, as shown by the early history of the Hamburg opera, was more in\r\nconsonance with German character than the light, ephemeral operas which\r\nruled the Italian stage.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the Early German Opera=.—The Hamburg opera house\r\nwas opened in 1678 with a Biblical _Singspiel_ (literally song-play) of\r\nan allegorical nature, _Adam und Eva; oder der erschaffene, gefallene\r\nund wieder aufgerichtete Mensch_ (Adam and Eve; or the Created, Fallen\r\nand Redeemed Man) by =Johann Theile= (1646-1724) a noted organist of\r\nthe day and a pupil of Schütz. This was the first performance of a\r\nGerman opera on a public stage. The _Singspiel_ corresponds to the\r\nEnglish ballad opera in being a series of songs, ensembles, etc.,\r\nmainly of a simple nature, connected by spoken dialogue. The curious\r\ntaste of the time is shown by the choice of subject; the work itself\r\nwas a survival of the Miracle Plays and Mysteries of the Middle Ages.\r\nIt begins with the creation of the earth, which is formed out of chaos\r\nby characters representing the four elements; the Almighty descends by\r\nmeans of a flying machine and calls man into being; Lucifer succeeds\r\nin his temptation of Eve to the great joy of demons who sing an\r\nexulting chorus, etc. As the Italians took the subjects for their early\r\noperas from classical mythology, so the _Germans took_ theirs from\r\n_Bible history_. _Adam and Eve_ was followed by a series of similar\r\n_Singspiele_: _Michal and David_, _The Maccabean Mother_, _Esther_,\r\n_Cain and Abel_, and many others.\r\n\r\n=Change of Character=.—In time, however, these gave way to operas in\r\nthe Italian style. The chief agent in this change was =Reinhard Keiser=\r\n(1674-1739) who, as composer and manager, brought the Hamburg opera\r\nto its highest point. Associated with him was =Johannes Mattheson=\r\n(1681-1764), a man of many and varied gifts as singer, composer,\r\nconductor, scholar and diplomat, now chiefly remembered by his close\r\nrelations with =George Frederic Handel= (1685-1759). The latter at the\r\nage of eighteen came from his native city, Halle, to Hamburg, then\r\nthe musical centre of Germany, to continue his studies. Mattheson\r\nrecognized the youth’s genius and opened the way for the performance of\r\nhis first opera, _Almira_.\r\n\r\n=Handel and the Hamburg Opera=.—This, with _Nero_, was given in 1705\r\nwith such success that Keiser, jealous of the young composer, set them\r\nboth to music himself and banished his rival’s works from the stage.\r\nHandel thereupon withdrew and the year following went to Italy, where\r\nhe spent several years. His connection with the Hamburg opera was too\r\nslight for him to have exercised any influence upon it; then, too, he\r\nhad not yet reached artistic independence himself, and it is doubtful\r\nwhether he would have made any change in the direction it was taking\r\ntoward conventionalized Italian opera. At that time the Hamburg opera\r\nwas rapidly losing its national character; the style mainly cultivated\r\nwas that of the Neapolitan school; a tasteless mingling of languages\r\nwas even allowed in one and the same opera—the recitatives were often\r\nsung in German and the arias in Italian. This decadence continued, with\r\na consequent loss of popular favor, until in 1738 opera in German was\r\ngiven up entirely, and Italian opera reigned triumphant in Germany.\r\n\r\n=The Conventionalized Italian Opera=.—Handel, on his return from Italy,\r\nfinally found his way to England, where he made his home for the rest\r\nof his life. The series of operas he produced there form the _climax of\r\nthe type originated by Scarlatti_, which by this time flourished on all\r\nstages to the exclusion of all others, save in France, where the ideals\r\nof Lully and his school still prevailed. Its chief aim was to afford\r\nsingers an opportunity to display their accomplishments. To this end\r\nthe composer directed his attention principally to the production of\r\narias which should correspond to this demand. Exquisitely beautiful as\r\nthese often were, their preponderance completely obscured the dramatic\r\nsignificance of the opera, and led the singers to entertain grossly\r\nexaggerated ideas of their importance. They dictated to composers,\r\nrefused to sing what in their opinion failed to suit their voices, and\r\nin many ways kept the opera from rising above the low artistic level\r\nto which it had fallen. To please them, a highly artificial scheme of\r\narrangement was adopted to which the drama was totally subservient.\r\nOnly six characters were allowed, three men and three women; the arias\r\nwere strictly classified according to style and assigned to the singers\r\nin a certain fixed order; no ensemble beyond a duet was permitted, and\r\nthe chorus sang only in the closing finale. No matter what the dramatic\r\nexigencies might be, adherence to these formulæ was rigidly exacted.\r\n\r\n=Handel’s Operas=.—Though Handel infused a vigor of spirit and a\r\nwealth of characteristic melody into this form of opera, he made no\r\ndefinite attempt to escape its restrictions. Many of his most beautiful\r\ncreations are buried in operas which are dead beyond possibility of\r\nresurrection on account of his acquiescence in the sentiment of his\r\ntimes. That this is not due to lack of innate power is shown by his\r\noratorios.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTOPH WILLIBALD GLUCK.]\r\n\r\n=Gluck and His Reform of the Opera=.—This so-called concert opera\r\nreigned with almost undisputed sway until the influence of =Christoph\r\nWillibald Gluck= (1714-1787) wrought a momentous change. Persuaded of\r\nthe low estate to which the opera had been reduced, Gluck stood for a\r\nreturn to first principles; he advocated a ruthless sacrifice of the\r\nconventionalities which through the vanity of singers and the love of\r\nsensation on the part of the public had grown up around the opera and\r\nthe placing of it upon its original foundation of the drama. He was a\r\nman of mature years when in 1762 he put his theories into practice by\r\nthe production of _Orfeo_ in Vienna. He had composed many operas in the\r\nprevailing Italian style, but his judgment, formed by extensive study\r\nand travel, convinced him of the essential weakness of that school: its\r\nconcentration upon the purely musical element. This he saw made of the\r\nopera a puppet-show for the display of vocal art which, great as it was\r\nfrom a technical point of view, was mechanical and meretricious in\r\ncharacter. He was not alone in his condemnation; critics and thinkers\r\nsuch as Addison and Steele in England, Diderot in France, Marcello and\r\nAlgarotti in Italy had employed the varied resources of wit, satire and\r\nreason to expose the follies and inconsistencies of the opera. From the\r\nnature of the case, however, they could work no change; most of them\r\nwere literary men who could criticise but not create.\r\n\r\n=Gluck’s Travels and their Influence=.—Gluck had traveled much. There\r\nwas hardly an art-centre in Europe from Copenhagen to Naples which\r\nhe had not visited for the purpose of bringing out his works. In\r\nEngland, he had heard Handel’s oratorios, which profoundly impressed\r\nhim; in Paris, he had made acquaintance with Rameau’s operas. Both\r\nof these masters exercised a strong influence over his change of\r\nstyle; the former by his powerful handling of the chorus which had\r\nbeen practically banished from the Italian stage, the latter by his\r\nconsistent adherence to dramatic truth of expression. He was in\r\naddition a zealous student of art and literature in all their phases;\r\nhe brought to his problem not only the ear of the musician but the\r\nintellect of the scholar.\r\n\r\n“=Orfeo=.”—In _Orfeo_, Gluck took the same stand which Peri had\r\ntaken in his opera on the same myth a century and a half before: the\r\n_illustration of the drama through music_ which should give it a\r\npoignancy of expression denied to the spoken word. The later composer\r\nhad the immense advantage of musical resources undreamed-of at the\r\ntime of the Florentine opera, but both stand upon the same artistic\r\nplatform. It was a daring task that Gluck had attempted. Orpheus,\r\nrobbed by death of Euridice, seeks to regain her by forcing entrance\r\nto the place of departed spirits. On his descent to the nether world\r\nhe is confronted by a band of demons who bar his way, but finally\r\nmelted to tears by the pathos of his song, they allow him to pass. The\r\ncomposer must make this appeal adequate to the effect; anything less\r\nwould result in an anti-climax totally disastrous to dramatic illusion.\r\nGluck passed this test triumphantly. Even today this scene remains one\r\nof the most powerful known to the operatic stage. _Orfeo_, in its\r\nstrength and simplicity, was so opposed to the taste of the day that\r\nits victory was by no means unquestioned, but it soon won universal\r\nrecognition and with its successor, _Alceste_ (1767), is the oldest\r\nopera heard at the present day.\r\n\r\n=Gluck in Paris=.—_Alceste_ was followed by _Paride ed Elena_ (Paris\r\nand Helen), but the severity of the new style aroused such a storm of\r\nhostile criticism that the discouraged composer turned to Paris with\r\nhis _Iphigenie en Aulide_ (Iphigenia in Aulis) to a French text after\r\nRacine’s tragedy. Marie Antoinette, then the wife of the Dauphin, had\r\nbeen his pupil in Vienna, and through her influence the opera was\r\nproduced, though not without arousing one of the most bitter wars in\r\nmusical annals. Twelve years before, Italian _Opera Buffa_ had gained\r\na footing in Paris. Its lightness, melodic grace, and witty dramatic\r\nsituations captivated many who immediately attacked the prevailing type\r\nof French opera, of which Rameau was the head, as heavy and unmusical.\r\nThis opinion was strenuously combated by others who upheld native\r\nart. Thus there were two strongly-opposed parties, one defending the\r\nItalian, the other the French school of opera. After Rameau’s death,\r\nthe Italian party was in the ascendency, but on Gluck’s arrival with a\r\nFrench opera he was taken as the representative of the national school.\r\nPiccini, the most popular Italian composer of the day, was pitted\r\nagainst him, but it needed only the production of Gluck’s _Iphigenie en\r\nTauride_ (Iphigenia in Tauris) to crush his rival’s claims. This was\r\nhis last great work. He retired to Vienna, which was his home until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Gluck=.—The influence exerted by Gluck was far-reaching\r\nand permanent. The reform he initiated did not create a school—it did\r\nfar more; it _profoundly affected all schools_. With no immediate\r\nfollowers among the composers of his time he stood alone, as he\r\nstands today, one of the most commanding figures in musical history.\r\nHis _Orfeo_ marks the beginning of a new era by rescuing a great\r\nand important form of art from a decadence which had robbed it of\r\nlegitimate power and effect. The opera more than any other form of\r\nmusic is dependent upon popular favor for existence. It is therefore\r\npeculiarly susceptible to influences which tend to lower artistic\r\nstandards. Gluck, however, made it impossible that it should ever again\r\nsink to the level of the mass of crudities and puerilities from which\r\nhe lifted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCE.\r\n\r\nOxford History of Music, Vol. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nGive an account of the introduction of opera into Germany.\r\n\r\nWhy did German composers develop slowly?\r\n\r\nDescribe the early German opera forms.\r\n\r\nWho was the chief agent in a change?\r\n\r\nGive an account of Handel’s work in connection with German opera.\r\n\r\nWhat had been the influence of singers?\r\n\r\nWhat were the influences to cause Gluck to set about opera reform?\r\n\r\nGive an account of “Orfeo.”\r\n\r\nWhy did Gluck go to Paris and what success did he have there?\r\n\r\nWhat was the influence of Gluck upon the future of the opera?\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the Thirty Years’ War in Germany interfered with\r\nthe development of the Opera. Frederick the Great’s grandfather and\r\nfather laid the foundations of the Prussian kingdom. In France, Gluck’s\r\nworks carry us up to the period of social and political agitation\r\npreceding the French Revolution. In England, the House of Hanover is\r\nbecoming more firmly established on the throne; in America, the period\r\nis that of the struggles between the French and English colonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LESSON XXIII.\r\n\r\n                           MOZART TO ROSSINI.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Opera after Gluck=.—After Gluck the first great name is that of\r\n=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart= (1756-1791). Haydn had indeed written a\r\nnumber of operas, but they were, in the main, light in character and\r\nexercised no influence whatever on the development of the form. At the\r\nage of twelve, Mozart had composed two operas, but the first to receive\r\npublic performance was _Mitridate, Re di Ponto_ (Mithridates, King of\r\nPontus), which was produced at Milan two years later under his own\r\ndirection. This was followed by others, but these early works do not\r\ncall for any extended mention. Though they abound in melody and show a\r\nmaturity remarkable in so young a composer, they were frankly written\r\nto please the taste of the time and do not in any essentials depart\r\nfrom the accepted Italian style then in favor, as fixed by Scarlatti\r\nand his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n=Gluck and Mozart Compared=.—It was not until _Idomeneo, Re di Creta_\r\n(Idomeneus, King of Crete) was brought out during the Carnival season\r\nof 1781, that he demonstrated fully the gifts which made him the first\r\ndramatic composer of his time. In this he shows a great advance over\r\nthe conventional opera of the period and an approach to the ideals of\r\nGluck, though neither in _Idomeneo_ nor in any of his later operas did\r\nhe attempt to embody these ideals in the uncompromising form chosen by\r\nthe older master. Though contemporaries, no two composers could well\r\nbe more unlike in character, temperament and methods than Gluck and\r\nMozart. The one, a man of years, ripened through travel and study,\r\nconditioned his music according to the requirements of the drama; the\r\nother, a youth of no great intellectual endowments aside from his art,\r\nbut aflame with the fire of genius, felt the drama in terms of music.\r\nThus they approached the task from opposite sides. Not that Gluck was\r\nwithout feeling or Mozart without intellect; it was simply a case of\r\nthe dramatist and the musician solving the problem each in his own\r\nway. At the same time it was impossible that Gluck’s theories should\r\nbe entirely without influence on Mozart. Even a genius must learn from\r\nhis environment, and Gluck’s position, though sharply disputed by the\r\nItalian school to which Mozart belonged, could not be ignored by the\r\nyounger man. Then, too, Mozart had been in Paris during the height\r\nof the Gluck-Piccini controversy, and it is known that he had made a\r\nclose study of _Alceste_, to which Gluck, in the form of a dedication\r\nto the Grand Duke of Tuscany, had given a preface containing a clear\r\nexposition of his principles of dramatic composition. It is hard to\r\nsay, however, what direction Mozart’s dramatic course might have taken\r\nhad his life not been cut so pitilessly short and if his outward\r\ncircumstances had been less constrained. He was obliged to adapt\r\nhimself to Italian influences which at that time were all powerful.\r\n\r\n=The Singspiel=.—As already mentioned, the first attempts at German\r\nopera took the form of the _Singspiel_, but it gradually died out\r\nduring the invasion of Italian opera in Germany. Its revival and\r\ndevelopment to a higher standard was due to =Johann Adam Hiller=\r\n(1728-1804), who received his first impulse through an English ballad\r\nopera of a farcical nature, “The Devil to Pay.” This was translated\r\ninto German and given (1743) at Berlin with the original English\r\nmelodies taken from popular ballads. Hiller set this translation to\r\nmusic and followed it with many others which soon acquired great vogue;\r\none or two, for example, _Der Dorfbarbier_ (The Village Barber),\r\nare still heard in Germany. Hiller, though one of the most learned\r\nmusicians of the day, the founder of the celebrated Gewandhaus Concerts\r\nin Leipzig and editor of the first musical periodical ever published,\r\nadopted a simple, natural Folk-style in these operettas, as they were\r\nalso called. Goethe was particularly interested in this revival of a\r\nnational form of opera; it stimulated him to the writing of the ballads\r\nwhich in turn acted so powerfully in developing the German song under\r\nthe hands of Loewe, Schubert, Schumann and others.\r\n\r\n=Mozart’s First German Opera=.—Emperor Joseph II, wishing to establish\r\nthe _Singspiel_ in Vienna, commissioned Mozart to write a German opera\r\nof a similar style. This resulted in _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_\r\n(The Elopement from the Seraglio), and the composer’s hopes of founding\r\na national school of opera were high. Unfortunately, he was doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Though _Die Entführung_ was received with enthusiasm,\r\npopular favor was averse to opera in any other tongue than Italian; the\r\nGerman theatre was open only a few years and with the exception of _Die\r\nZauberflöte_, his future operas were composed to Italian texts.\r\n\r\n=His Later Operas=.—_Le Nozze di Figaro_ (The Marriage of Figaro—1786),\r\n_Don Giovanni_ (Don Juan—1788), _Die Zauberflöte_ (The Magic\r\nFlute—1791) rank as Mozart’s greatest operas. Considered as music\r\nalone, the last reaches a height which gives an idea of what he might\r\nhave done in nationalizing the opera if he had been spared a score of\r\nyears longer; but its confused, irrational plot stands in the way of\r\nits popularization. The same objection holds good of _Così fan Tutte_\r\n(Women are All Alike—1790), which contains some of his most exquisite\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of Mozart’s Operas=.—Mozart’s _conception_ of the\r\nopera is that of the _musician_, _not_ of the _dramatist_. This\r\nis plain from the indifferent texts he willingly accepted, yet so\r\nuniversal was his genius that he fused the two elements into a complete\r\nand consistent whole. Such a union of clearly-cut characterization and\r\nmusical beauty is unknown in the opera. He made his _characters eternal\r\ntypes_ by means of music so apposite to their individuality that it\r\nseems in each case to spring from inward necessity, yet which as music\r\nhas never been surpassed for intrinsic grace and charm. Italian melody\r\nin its best estate on a foundation of German depth and solidity is\r\nits distinguishing characteristic. This characterization is confined,\r\nhowever, to details and personages; of the development of the drama\r\nas a whole he apparently had but little idea. This, however, was not\r\ncalled for by the taste of the times; the opera was not considered from\r\na dramatic standpoint, save by Gluck and the composers of the French\r\nschool; the libretto furnished a series of situations suitable for\r\nmusical illustration, not a consistent and logical dramatic action.\r\n\r\n=Their Significance to German Art=.—Mozart marks the highest point\r\nreached by the opera of the 18th century; he also _marks the passing\r\nof Italian supremacy in Germany_. The Germans were already masters\r\nof the other great forms, the Oratorio and the Symphony; Gluck and\r\nMozart captured the Opera also for Germany, though it was not for\r\nseveral decades after Mozart’s death that German opera rose from its\r\ndiscredited position at the close of the century.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven’s Fidelio=.—A mighty impulse was given to the development of\r\na national school by the production of _Fidelio_ (1805), Beethoven’s\r\nonly opera. His two great predecessors had been obliged for the most\r\npart to write their operas to French and Italian texts. =Beethoven=\r\n(1770-1827), however, showed his independence and sturdy national\r\ncharacter by choosing a subject totally alien to the frivolous\r\nintrigues which at that time ruled the Viennese stage—a story of\r\nheroic, wifely devotion—and composed it to German words and in the\r\nGerman style; that is, with dialogue instead of recitative. Essentially\r\nsymphonic in character, _Fidelio_ shows the same disregard of vocal\r\nlimitations which characterizes the Ninth Symphony and the Mass in D.\r\nDifficult for the singers, it was still more difficult for the public.\r\nIn subject and treatment it was above their heads; they turned it the\r\ncold shoulder and it soon disappeared from the boards. An appreciation\r\nof its greatness was reserved for a later day.\r\n\r\n=Italian Composers in France and Germany=.—The popularity of Italian\r\nopera outside of Italy led to the expatriation of many Italian\r\ncomposers who exercised a powerful influence in France and Germany.\r\nAmong these =Antonio Salieri= (1750-1825) deserves mention for his\r\ncareer in Vienna, where he was the successful rival of Mozart in court\r\nfavor and later the teacher of Beethoven. More important was =Luigi\r\nCherubini= (1760-1842), who found his way to Paris just before the\r\nRevolution. A master of the severe contrapuntal school, which was then\r\npassing away, Beethoven considered him the first composer of the day\r\nfor the stage and studied his works zealously. Cherubini was present\r\nat the first performance of _Fidelio_, which shows strong traces of\r\nthe influence exerted upon Beethoven by _Les Deux Journées_ (The Two\r\nDays, known in Germany and England as The Water Carrier), Cherubini’s\r\ngreatest opera. The two were on intimate terms during the stay of the\r\nlatter in Vienna for the purpose of bringing out several of his operas.\r\nThere was much in common between them; the Italian had the solidity,\r\ndignity and nobility of treatment generally associated with the German\r\ncharacter. Beethoven’s choice of a subject for his opera was doubtless\r\ninfluenced by _Les Deux Journées_; the themes of both are much the\r\nsame, involving devotion and self-sacrifice of the highest order.\r\n\r\n=Spontini and Rossini=.—Another Italian composer who went first to\r\nFrance and afterward to Germany was =Gasparo Spontini= (1774-1851),\r\nwho with _La Vestale_ (The Vestal) enlarged the sphere of the opera\r\nin Paris. Spectacular and pompous in character, sonorous and powerful\r\nin instrumentation, it pointed directly to the type of grand opera\r\noriginated by Meyerbeer nearly a generation later. In 1820, he was\r\nsummoned to Berlin, where he remained as court composer and conductor\r\nfor twenty-two years, a period coincident with the most significant\r\ndevelopment of the German school of opera. Spontini was the last\r\nof the many Italians who had for a century and a half borne almost\r\nuninterrupted sway in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant and gifted of all these wandering sons of Italy was\r\n=Gioacchino Rossini= (1792-1868). As rich in melody as Mozart, though\r\nof a less refined type, he owed more to nature than to study. His\r\nfirst successful opera, _Tancredi_ (1813), set all Italy agog with the\r\nfreshness and vivacity of its airs, and it was not long before he was\r\nthe most popular composer in Europe. Gifted with prodigious facility—in\r\none period of eight years he wrote twenty operas—his operas ruled all\r\nstages and fixed the standard by which all others were judged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIOACCHINO ROSSINI.]\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of Rossini’s Operas=.—They are, on the whole, a\r\n_reversion_ to the conventionalized opera of Handel’s time in being\r\nwritten for the singer to exhibit his art and not to express the\r\nsignificance of the drama; this notwithstanding their undoubted charm,\r\nthe many piquant and original touches in rhythm and harmony, the\r\noccasional suggestive instrumentation. An intensely _florid style_ is\r\nused not only in the _buffa_ school where it can readily be justified,\r\nbut in operas of a tragic nature where it is manifestly out of place.\r\nIn _Semiramide_, for instance, a story of battle, murder and sudden\r\ndeath is told in the same rippling rhythms and highly ornamented\r\nmelodies that illustrate the intrigues of his _Barbiere di Siviglia_\r\n(Barber of Seville), where they are eminently appropriate.\r\n\r\n=His Change of Style=.—This is true, however, only of his works\r\ncomposed for the Italian stage. His _Guillaume Tell_ (William Tell),\r\nproduced in 1829, five years after his arrival in Paris, showed the\r\ninfluence of his new environment by an almost startling change of\r\nstyle. Elevated and dramatic in treatment, shorn of redundant ornament\r\nas befits the character of the subject—taken from Schiller’s play of\r\nthe same name—it remains his greatest achievement; at least in serious\r\nopera. It was also his last work for the stage. It is not known by what\r\nstrange caprice he practically closed his career as composer at the age\r\nof thirty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCE.\r\n\r\nOxford History of Music, Vol. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nName the most prominent successor of Gluck in opera.\r\n\r\nCompare the two.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Singspiel.\r\n\r\nName some of Mozart’s operas.\r\n\r\nMention their characteristics and influence.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Beethoven’s work in Opera.\r\n\r\nTell about Salieri, Cherubini, Spontini, Rossini.\r\n\r\nGive the characteristics of Rossini’s operas.\r\n\r\nWhat change in his style is evident in “William Tell”?\r\n\r\nWe now approach the period preceding the American and the French\r\nRevolutions which so greatly affected the masses of Europe, an\r\ninfluence extended by the wars of Napoleon. Music shows traces of the\r\npowerful forces at work, losing the former artificiality and becoming\r\nmore and more, in the hands of Beethoven, an expression of dramatic and\r\npersonal feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XXIV.\r\n\r\n                             THE ORATORIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oratorio in Italy after Carissimi=.—After the beginning made by\r\nCarissimi, the next work of importance in Oratorio is that of\r\n=Alessandro Scarlatti=, who established the Aria form as explained in\r\nthe study of the Opera. The composers of the Italian school of the\r\nlast part of the 17th and the early part of the 18th century used\r\npractically the same methods in Opera and Oratorio, the difference\r\nbeing mainly in the character of the text, and in the earnestness or\r\nreligious feeling of the composer. Scarlatti is also signalized by\r\nhis improvements in the Recitative, which resulted in several forms\r\nmade use of by his successors, _Recitativo Secco_ and Accompanied\r\nRecitative. He wrote ten oratorios. Contemporaries whose work should\r\nbe mentioned are =Antonio Caldara= (1678-1763) and =Leonardo Leo=\r\n(1694-1746), a pupil of Scarlatti, who wrote nearly a hundred works for\r\nthe church, the chief one being the oratorio, _Santa Elena al Calvario_\r\nand a _Miserere_ for a double choir. He was strong in his writing for\r\nchorus, making splendid use of the fugal style. Another contemporary of\r\nthe first rank was =Alessandro Stradella= (1645-1681), whose oratorio,\r\n_San Giovanni Battista_ (St. John the Baptist) is a most beautiful\r\nwork. It contains a free treatment of the accompanying instruments,\r\nthe arias are clear and well-designed, the chorus writing for five\r\nparts is effective as well as ingenious, and the work as a whole shows\r\nconsiderable power of dramatic expression, forming a sort of transition\r\nbetween Scarlatti and Handel. Stradella is said to have been a pupil of\r\nCarissimi.\r\n\r\n=Oratorio in Germany=.—In Oratorio as in Opera, the style spread to\r\nother countries, there, in the case of the Oratorio, ultimately to\r\nfind a more congenial home; for the Oratorio, in Italy after the time\r\nof Stradella, seemed to lose hold on composers and public. The latter\r\ndid not grasp the fact that the Oratorio had within it one element,\r\nthe chorus, to give to it a definite individuality. They submitted to\r\nthe public’s preference for solo singing and made up their oratorios\r\nlargely of conventional arias—thus inviting comparison with the Opera,\r\nand reserved their writing in choral form for their works for the\r\nChurch service, such as psalms, magnificats, masses and motets. In\r\nGermany, the attitude of the people toward religious music, doubtless\r\nowing to the Reformation as well as to the serious nature of the\r\npeople, was much more favorable than in Italy. This temperament is\r\nshown by the fact that when German composers cast about for themes\r\nfor their oratorios they seemed to choose the story of the Passion.\r\nThe oldest example of the German Oratorio is “The Resurrection of\r\nChrist,” written by =Heinrich Schuetz= (1585-1672), a pupil of Giovanni\r\nGabrieli, which was produced at Dresden in 1623. The narrative portions\r\nwere committed almost entirely to the chorus. We mention also a setting\r\nof the Passion, by =Johann Sebastiani=, published in 1672, which\r\ncontains interspersed chorales, sung as arias by one voice with violin\r\naccompaniment, and by =Reinhard Keiser= (1674-1739).\r\n\r\n=Use of the Chorale=.—A step in advance was taken when German composers\r\nbegan to use the chorale of the German Protestant Church as the\r\nsubject for contrapuntal elaboration, a tendency shown in the work\r\nof Sebastiani referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Chorale\r\nhad absorbed into itself the spirit of the Volkslied, and its use\r\nsupplied the medium for the public to enter fully into the spirit of\r\nthe oratorio. Two composers who developed the “Passion Music” idea to\r\nits height, =Karl Heinrich Graun= (1701-1759) and =Johann Sebastian\r\nBach=, made the Chorale an integral part of their works. The greatest\r\nwork in oratorio form written by Graun was called _Der Tod Jesu_ (The\r\nDeath of Jesus), which was first produced in the Cathedral at Berlin in\r\n1755. This work consists of recitatives, airs and choruses, the fugal\r\ntreatment of the latter being admirable in point of clearness of design\r\nand breadth of form. Graun used in this oratorio six chorales. _Der Tod\r\nJesu_, owing to a bequest, is still given in Berlin.\r\n\r\n=Bach=.—The greatest of all the settings of the Passion are those by\r\n=Johann Sebastian Bach= (1685-1750). The first work in this style by\r\nBach was the one according to “St. John,” in 1723, first performed on\r\nGood Friday, 1724, at Leipzig. This work, fine as it is, must yield to\r\nthe second setting, according to “St. Matthew,” first produced on Good\r\nFriday, 1729, afterward revised and given again in 1740. A few notes\r\non the “Passion according to St. Matthew” will serve for both works.\r\nThe characters introduced are Jesus, Judas, Peter, Pilate, the Apostles\r\nand the People. Certain reflections on the narrative are interpreted\r\nby a chorus. The text which furnishes the narrative is assigned to\r\nthe principal tenor. Fifteen chorales of the Lutheran Church are\r\nintroduced, and in the singing of these the general congregation\r\nwas expected to join. The choruses contain powerful and dramatic\r\nvocal effects, and though not strictly fugal are intricate in their\r\npart-writing. A double chorus is used, each chorus having a separate\r\norchestra and organ accompaniment. The performance of this work (St.\r\nMatthew Passion) was restricted to Leipzig in the 18th century, and was\r\ndiscontinued altogether in the 19th until Mendelssohn revived it in\r\n1829. It is given very frequently at the present day during the Lenten\r\nseason, in part or in full. The “Christmas Oratorio” (1734) is really\r\na series of cantatas for each of the first days of the Christmas week,\r\nand contains no new ideas so far as form is concerned.\r\n\r\n=Stabat Mater=.—In connection with the “Passion” reference should\r\nbe made to the Latin hymn, “Stabat Mater,” which has been made the\r\nsubject of treatment in oratorio form, by =Palestrina=, =Giovanni\r\nBattista Pergolesi= (1710-1736) for soprano and contralto accompanied\r\nby strings and organ, =Emanuele d’Astorga= (1681-1736) for four\r\nvoices with instrumental accompaniment, the more modern work, in\r\nlarge form, by =Gioacchino Rossini= (1792-1868), most beautiful as\r\nmusic if partaking too much, as critics say, of the sensuous, and the\r\nmagnificent setting of =Antonin Dvořák= (1841-1904). This work has been\r\nplaced, by musicians and the public, in the category of the world’s\r\nmasterpieces of choral writing.\r\n\r\n=George Friedrich Handel= (1685-1759).—We now come to Bach’s\r\ncontemporary, the greatest name in the history of the Oratorio, to\r\nthe composer who brought to his work a musical learning equal to that\r\nof Bach, German earnestness and mastery of contrapuntal science,\r\ntempered by knowledge of and experience in Italian vocal methods,\r\nproducing simple, clear melody supported by rich, firm harmonies, a\r\ncomplete mastery of the orchestra of the day, a clear understanding\r\nof the value of the chorus in working out dramatic effects; and this\r\ncombination was offered a congenial field for labor in England, one\r\nof the great Protestant countries of Europe, with a deep reverence\r\nfor religion and for the narratives of the Bible and the truths and\r\nlessons they enforce. This latter point is strikingly present in the\r\ntexts of Handel’s oratorios; the symbolic meaning of the narrative is\r\nclearly indicated and made the central thought of the work, producing\r\na remarkable effect of Unity. As a writer has said: “Handel preaches\r\nthrough the voices of his chorus.” The orchestra for which Handel\r\nwrote was smaller than the full orchestra to which we are accustomed\r\ntoday. The proportion of string players to the whole number of players\r\nwas smaller, but on the other side, more than two oboes and bassoons\r\nwere used; flutes were most frequently used as solo instruments or to\r\ndouble the part of the oboes; the clarinet Handel never used, doubtless\r\nbecause of its imperfections, which were not remedied until later;\r\nthe brass instruments used were trumpets with kettle drums for their\r\nnatural bass, horns and the three trombones, alto, tenor and bass;\r\nother instruments of a soft-voiced quality, like the harp, viola da\r\ngamba, were occasionally used for obligato accompaniments. The organ\r\nwas always used, the part being written according to the figured bass\r\nsystem, and the harpsichord was used by the conductor. The reader who\r\nis able to analyze one of Handel’s oratorio scores will be surprised to\r\nnote the superb effects he makes with comparatively small resources.\r\nCompared with the polyphonic writing of his predecessors and his great\r\ncontemporary, Bach, his fugues seem light and simple, but that very\r\nthing gives them their admirable clearness and purity; compared with\r\nlater works, his diatonic progressions and harmonies based on common\r\nchords seem colorless, especially so in contrast with the kaleidoscopic\r\nchromatic figures and strongly dissonant harmonies of the newer school;\r\nyet in this point is the strength of Handel’s works with the public;\r\nsimplicity is valued more highly than complexity, naturalness rather\r\nthan the indications of science.\r\n\r\nHandel wrote seventeen works that can be classed as oratorios. The\r\nfirst of these was “Esther,” in 1720, revised and brought out anew\r\nin 1732. In 1733 “Deborah,” perhaps best-known for a powerful double\r\nchorus, was offered to the public; “Athaliah” in the same year. In\r\n1739 came “Saul” and “Israel in Egypt,” the former best-known today\r\nfor its famous “Dead March,” the latter for the music descriptive of\r\nthe plagues. In 1741, he wrote his greatest oratorio “The Messiah,”\r\nwhich was first performed publicly, April 13, 1742, in Dublin. In this\r\nwe find a certain reflective character which recalls the Passion music\r\nof the German school. The only other oratorio which is still given in\r\nanything like entirety is “Judas Maccabæus” (1747); other works from\r\nwhich certain portions are still in use are “Samson” (1743), “Solomon”\r\n(1749), “Theodora” (1750), a work which Handel considered his best, and\r\n“Jephtha” (1752). Great as was Handel’s fame in England, the character\r\nof his works and the forms he used made little or no impression upon\r\nGerman and Italian composers. =Johann Adolph Hasse= (1699-1783),\r\n=Niccolo Porpora= (1686-1767), =Antonio Sacchini= (1734-1786),\r\n=Giovanni Paisiello= (1741-1816), =Niccolo Jommelli= (1714-1774)\r\nand =Pietro Guglielmi= (1727-1804) wrote in the Italian style, and\r\ntheir works are, properly speaking, concert oratorios, scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from the opera save by the text.\r\n\r\n=Franz Joseph Haydn=.—The next name of importance is that of Haydn\r\n(1732-1809), who wrote “The Creation” and “The Seasons” toward the\r\nend of a long life, after his work as a composer had given him a\r\ncommand of musical resources excelled only by Beethoven, who did not\r\nequal him in skill in writing effectively and suitably for voices. It\r\nwas in 1798 that “The Creation” was first given in Vienna. The score\r\nabounds in effective writing for the solo voices, in the florid style\r\nand in the conventional aria form, and in brilliant choruses which,\r\nhowever, cannot compare in dignity and breadth with those of Handel.\r\nThe orchestral accompaniments are much more elaborate than those used\r\nby Handel, as can naturally be expected from a composer who had given\r\nhis greatest efforts to the development of instrumental music. “The\r\nSeasons” was first performed in Vienna in 1801. It proved as successful\r\nas “The Creation.” Haydn’s simple, genial nature is apparent in this\r\nbeautiful work, really too light to bear the name of oratorio, which\r\nhas such close association with works of a deep, religious character.\r\n\r\n=Mozart and Beethoven=.—As the orchestra developed under the masters\r\nof tone and dramatic effects, Mozart, Gluck and Beethoven, so the\r\nworks in oratorio form took on a different texture. In the earlier\r\nperiods, the accompaniments were subordinate, the interest was centred\r\nin the voices. But as composers realized the possibilities of the\r\nconstantly-improving orchestra and the opportunities for effective\r\ncombinations of voices and instruments, the tendency became more and\r\nmore marked to elaborate the instrumental parts and to create an\r\nensemble more complicated and gorgeous, based upon the orchestra and\r\nits tone-color scheme rather than on pure vocal effects. =Mozart’s=\r\n“Requiem” (1791), written just before the composer’s death, brings\r\ninto use the most powerful dramatic resources of orchestra and voices\r\nto portray the spirit of the “mass for the dead.” In oratorio, as\r\nin opera, =Beethoven= wrote but one work, “The Mount of Olives”\r\n(1803). The style is florid and operatic, somewhat in the style of\r\nthe Italian composers; the resources of the orchestra are drawn upon\r\nmore extensively than marked the methods of Haydn. The chorus is\r\nfreely used, the “Hallelujah” being the strongest movement. The choral\r\nmovements in the Ninth Symphony suggest what Beethoven might have done\r\nhad he set himself to writing an oratorio in greater submission to the\r\ncapacity of the human voice.\r\n\r\n=Spohr=.—From now on, oratorio composition is associated with the\r\nmasters of instrumental music, the orchestra is drawn upon for\r\nits richest and most powerful resources to work out the emotional\r\nand dramatic qualities of the texts; it is now no longer a mere\r\naccompanying instrument; it is in the highest degree essential to\r\nthe effects designed by the composer. =Ludwig Spohr= (1784-1859), a\r\ngreat violinist, wrote his first oratorio, “_Das Jüngste Gericht_”\r\n(The Last Judgment), when he was but twenty-eight years old. A later\r\nwork produced in 1826, goes by the English name “The Last Judgment,”\r\nalthough that is not the literal translation of the German title _Die\r\nLetzten Dinge_. In this work we find the romantic idea clearly in\r\nevidence. The composer’s style had been developed and individualized\r\nby his long experience as player and conductor; he was a master of the\r\nresources of instrumentation, conversant both as composer and conductor\r\nwith the limitations of voices—he wrote a number of operas—so that\r\nhe was prepared for the creation of a work which has a character of\r\nits own. A striking feature of this oratorio is the frequent use of\r\nchromatic progressions, which is indeed a characteristic of Spohr’s\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n=Mendelssohn=.—The next great composer in Oratorio was a German; like\r\nhim also his works had their greatest reception in England, =Felix\r\nMendelssohn Bartholdy= (1809-1847). His first work, “St. Paul,” was\r\ngiven at Düsseldorf in 1836. His greatest oratorio, one that ranks with\r\nHandel’s “Messiah” in public favor, is “Elijah,” which was written for\r\nthe Birmingham, England, Festival. It was first produced in 1846. As\r\na diligent and enthusiastic student of Bach, it seems natural that\r\nMendelssohn should have adopted the great master’s methods. In style\r\n“St. Paul” and “Elijah” show leanings toward Bach and the German\r\noratorio rather than toward Handel. Mendelssohn, who produced Bach’s\r\n“Passion according to St. Matthew” in Berlin, in 1827, was thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the plan of the German oratorio, a mingling of narrative,\r\ndramatic and meditative or reflective elements, and especially the\r\nChorale to represent the Church, the chorus being, properly speaking,\r\na part of the _dramatis personæ_, representing masses of people who\r\nshare in the action, while the congregation represents the reflective\r\nelement. He uses a fugal style quite freely in his choruses, but a\r\nstrict fugue, in the style of Handel, is rare, as the composer’s\r\nfeeling for emotional effects demands a freer style; the accompaniments\r\nare elaborate, partaking of the dramatic element and drawing upon\r\nthe fullest resources of the orchestra. Mendelssohn had started the\r\ncomposition of another oratorio, “Christus,” on the lines of the\r\n“Passion” music of Bach, but died before the work was completed. His\r\n“Hymn of Praise” (1840), a large choral work that is occasionally sung,\r\nwell represents Mendelssohn’s skill in combining vocal and orchestral\r\neffect. Riemann calls it a symphony-cantata, Parry says it “combines\r\nthe qualities of a symphony and of an oratorio.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Oratorio and on\r\ncomposers named in this lesson.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapters VII and XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nGive the names of the Italian composers who followed Carissimi in the\r\nOratorio.\r\n\r\nWhat contributed to make Germany a congenial field for Oratorio?\r\n\r\nWho are the early composers of the “Passion” music?\r\n\r\nGive an account of Bach’s work in Oratorio.\r\n\r\nGive the names of the leading composers of the “Stabat Mater.”\r\n\r\nDescribe Handel’s orchestra.\r\n\r\nMention Handel’s most important works in Oratorio form.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Haydn’s work in Oratorio.\r\n\r\nWhat works did Mozart and Beethoven write in Oratorio form?\r\n\r\nDescribe Spohr’s work in Oratorio.\r\n\r\nWhere did Mendelssohn’s work become most popular?

Indeed, such experiments are still constantly in progress; so\r\nthat the pianoforte of the future may conceivably realize possibilities\r\nas far ahead of the present piano as that is ahead of its predecessors.\r\nThe first attempts at piano manufacture, however, had little in common\r\nwith our modern pianos, save the principle of the combination of the\r\nkeyboard with strings; since in construction and resulting tone few\r\npoints of similarity exist.\r\n\r\n=Clavier a Substitute for the Organ=.—We are probably indebted to the\r\nextensive use of the organ for the earliest combinations of keys and\r\nstrings. As the demand arose for a more conveniently-keyed instrument\r\nthan the large church organs, for practice or private houses, small\r\nportable organs were invented; yet even these did not satisfy the want\r\nentirely, owing to the _difficulties in their wind supply_, which\r\nrequired an assistant as blower. Thus the organ keyboard came to be\r\napplied, as early as the 11th century, to already existing stringed\r\ninstruments which were adapted to the purpose.\r\n\r\n=Two Classes=.—There were two classes of these, each made on the\r\nprinciple of the zither: namely, by stretching strings over a flat\r\nsurface or box, generally across bridges, this box serving as a\r\nresonator, to reinforce the weak tone of the strings. One such\r\ninstrument, in which the strings were _struck by_ little wooden\r\n_hammers_, was called the Dulcimer; another, in which the strings were\r\nsounded by _plucking_ with the fingers or by a quill, was called the\r\nPsaltery; and from these two were developed the earliest instruments\r\nof the piano class, called by the general name of “Claviers,” from\r\n_Clavis_, a key. The dulcimer type resulted in the =Clavichord=; the\r\npsaltery type in the =Harpsichord=, and, although many other names were\r\ngiven to varieties of these instruments, all may be placed in one of\r\nthe two classes of which they are the chief representatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYMBALUM OR DULCIMER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PSALTERY.\r\n\r\nThis instrument also came in square and other forms; strings varied\r\nfrom 6 to 38.]\r\n\r\n=Principle of the Clavichord=.—The first of the Clavichord instruments\r\nhad the name of Monochord, or one-stringed instrument—a name of great\r\nantiquity, first given by the Grecian Pythagoras to an instrument of\r\none string used by him in determining the relations of tones. Similar\r\nexperiments were made in the Middle Ages, in which the various tones\r\nresulting from the vibrations of parts of a string were studied by\r\nmeans of movable bridges; facility was gained by increasing the number\r\nof strings to four or five, tuned in unison. Next, _keys_ were applied\r\nto these in place of the bridges, which keys _struck the strings at\r\nvarious_ definite _points_ by means of upright pins or _tangents_, as\r\nthey were called, producing varying pitches, according to the length\r\nof the part of the string allowed to sound, the remaining segment\r\nbeing silenced by a piece of cloth. Thus several tangents struck the\r\nsame string at different points, producing different degrees of pitch.\r\nAt first, when only the scales corresponding to the white keys were\r\nemployed, four or five strings sufficed to sound the necessary tones,\r\nnot over twenty-two in number. Later, however, when chromatic notes\r\nwere adopted, the number of strings and keys was increased, so that,\r\nby the beginning of the 16th century, the keyboard had a range of\r\nthree or four full octaves. From this time on, this instrument, now\r\ngenerally known as the Clavichord, won a popularity which extended\r\nto the beginning of the 19th century, when the Pianoforte gradually\r\ndisplaced it. A familiar instrument in England and Germany, it was\r\nespecially cultivated by musicians of note in the latter country, even\r\nthe renowned Bach preferring it to all other forms of its class.\r\n\r\n=The Clavichord=.—In shape, the Clavichord was an oblong box, the\r\nstrings of brass extending lengthwise. The fact that one string\r\nserved for several keys made it impossible to sound certain intervals\r\ntogether; yet the device of giving a separate string to each key seems\r\nnot to have come in till about the year 1725, and even then not to have\r\nbeen generally adopted. Without legs, the Clavichord was supported\r\non a table when in use. Its tone was exceedingly weak and tremulous,\r\naudible only within the distance of a few feet; yet the fact that\r\nthis tone could be given different degrees of intensity, and could be\r\nvaried to some extent even while sounding, by a peculiar pressure on\r\nthe keys (_bebung_), imbued its tone with a sympathetic quality which\r\nhelps to account for the tenacity with which musicians clung to it,\r\nnotwithstanding all its imperfections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLAVICHORD.]\r\n\r\n=Principle of the Harpsichord=.—Instruments of the Harpsichord class\r\nwere especially numerous in Italy, France and England. They differed\r\nfrom the Clavichord chiefly in the method of setting the string in\r\nvibration. This was done by _plucking_ the string with a quill set\r\nin a jack at the end of the key, the action so arranged that, after\r\nthe key was released, the jack fell back to its place, while a damper\r\ncame against the string, preventing its further vibration. Since\r\nthese strings could not be used as bridges, like the tangents of the\r\nClavichord, it was necessary from the first that each key should\r\nhave a separate string. Moreover, as these strings were thus made of\r\nvarying lengths and thicknesses, the Harpsichords were more often made\r\nin a triangular shape, or one like our modern grand pianos, than in\r\nthe rectangular Clavichord shape. The chief defect, and the one which\r\nmakers tried in vain to remedy, lay in the fact that the _plucking_\r\nof the strings, while producing greater brilliancy, _admitted_ of _no\r\nvariation_ in its degrees of _loudness_ or _softness_.\r\n\r\n=Virginal and Spinet=.—Several small instruments of this kind preceded\r\nits full development, differing mainly in shape and choice of\r\nmaterials. In England these received the name of Virginal; in France,\r\nthat of Spinet. Both of these were introduced into polite society,\r\nchiefly as small house instruments of limited compass, varied sizes,\r\nand frequently with elaborate decoration. The difference between them\r\nwas principally one of shape, the Virginal taking the oblong form\r\nof the Clavichord, while the Spinet was more often triangular. They\r\nappeared both with and without supports; and in some cases the strings\r\nwere placed in a vertical position, as in our upright pianofortes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIRGINAL OR SPINET.]\r\n\r\n=The Harpsichord=.—The Harpsichord proper was simply a larger form\r\nof the Spinet and Virginal, and was made in the form of the grand\r\npianoforte. On account of its added brilliancy of tone, it was\r\nadmirably adapted for use in the orchestra, in which it became the\r\nconductor’s instrument in connection with the opera. In Italy, the\r\nterms Clavicembalo and Gravicembalo were given to it, while in Germany\r\nit was called Flügel, or wing, from its wing-shaped cover. As it\r\nbecame popular as a concert instrument, many inventions were added to\r\nincrease the brilliancy and variety of its tone: an extra keyboard was\r\nplaced above the first, as in the organ, and three or four strings were\r\ngiven each note, which could be used to reinforce the single-string\r\ntone, by means of the second keyboard. Moreover, various kinds of\r\nquills were invented, giving different tone qualities; and such\r\neffects were controlled by stops or pedals. These experiments were\r\nespecially numerous in the 18th century, in which the rapid growth of\r\nmusical resources demanded constantly more tonal possibilities. Large\r\nmanufacturers, such as the Ruckers family of Antwerp, and Tabel in\r\nEngland, vied with each other in producing novel devices, such as the\r\nimitation of other instruments, the tuning of an extra string for each\r\nnote an octave above its normal pitch, and the addition of a keyboard\r\nconnected with an organ. Attempts to produce a sustained tone resulted\r\nin the Piano-Violin, in which a revolving rosined wheel was pressed by\r\nthe key against the string, to continue the tone; but all such were\r\nabandoned finally as unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO-MANUAL HARPSICHORD.]\r\n\r\n=Invention of the Pianoforte=.—To this exceptional activity in keyed\r\ninstruments, and the final failure to produce a singing tone capable of\r\nvariation in the Harpsichord, we owe the invention of the Pianoforte.\r\nIn 1711, =Bartolomeo Cristofori=, a noted harpsichord maker of\r\nTuscany, exhibited several “forte-pianos” in which the action was so\r\nconstructed that the keys, when depressed, threw little _leather-headed\r\nhammers_, affixed to a bar above them, _against the strings_, thus\r\nmaking it possible to modulate the strength of tone by the degree of\r\nforce with which the keys were struck. When the key was released,\r\na _damper_ came against the string from beneath, _stopping further\r\nvibration_.\r\n\r\n=Early Makers=.—Although this invention did not at first attract\r\nwidespread attention, it undoubtedly formed the basis of the others\r\nwhich quickly followed it, and really asserted the principle afterwards\r\nadopted for the piano action. In 1716, =Marius=, a French manufacturer,\r\nsubmitted four models for piano actions, which, however, were never\r\ndeveloped. Also, =Schroeter=, a German, constructed two models of\r\npiano actions, in 1717, in one of which the hammers struck on top of\r\nthe strings; but neither of these was put to practical use. Finally,\r\n=Gottfried Silbermann=, of Saxony, distinguished as an organ and\r\nharpsichord maker, made two pianofortes, the action of which was\r\nevidently based on that of Cristofori, and which he exhibited to J.\r\nS. Bach. While praising them in many respects, Bach criticised them\r\nas too weak in the upper notes, and too hard to play. Silbermann\r\nwas exceedingly painstaking as a workman, having the reputation of\r\nbreaking to pieces with an axe even a finished product which showed\r\nany imperfection. He therefore set to work to remedy these defects,\r\nand, in 1737, produced several pianofortes which won Bach’s unqualified\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n=Superiority of the Piano=.—The Pianoforte was now placed upon a firm\r\nbasis; and although many years elapsed before its resources were\r\ndeveloped sufficiently to cause its universal adoption by musicians,\r\nthe final victory over its predecessors was complete. And this victory\r\nwas natural, since the Pianoforte was found capable of combining the\r\nbest qualities of the Clavichord and the Harpsichord, with the addition\r\nof a tone capacity infinitely superior to either.\r\n\r\n=Improvements=.—The story of succeeding piano manufacture and the\r\nmanifold inventions and improvements relative to it is one of infinite\r\ndetails. Among these we notice that while Silbermann pianos were in\r\n“grand” form, =Frederici= of Gera (died 1779) constructed them in\r\noblong or “square” shape; that the pianos of Spaeth (died 1796) and\r\nof =J. Andreas Stein= (died 1792), whose pianos were adopted for use\r\nby Mozart, showed considerable advancement. The Stein family became\r\nallied with =Andreas Streicher=, an inventive genius, and founded a\r\nmanufactory in Vienna which has maintained a high standard to the\r\npresent time. The action invented by them, known as the Viennese\r\naction, differs from that of Cristofori in having the hammers annexed\r\nto the keys themselves, instead of on a bar above them; thus giving\r\na light touch and tone. In England, the principle of the Cristofori\r\naction was developed by the renowned house of =Broadwood=, their action\r\nbecoming known as the English action; while in France, =Sebastian\r\nErhard=, or =Erard=, a Strasburg inventor, founded the Erard action,\r\nwhich has a double hammer movement, allowing the hammers to fall\r\neither entirely, or only partially into place after the key is struck,\r\nat the will of the performer. The “cottage” action, introduced by\r\n=William Southwell=, about 1800, was the beginning of the “upright”\r\nform, which has now entirely superseded that of the square piano.\r\nThus, by continued experiments, the piano has gained in compass,\r\nbrilliancy, sustaining power and strength of construction, to meet the\r\nconstantly-increasing demands placed upon it, until the modern piano\r\nseems to possess unlimited resources, and until the unending supply of\r\ninstruments of all grades from hundreds of factories is sufficient to\r\nplace one of these “household orchestras” within the reach of rich and\r\npoor alike.\r\n\r\n=Equal Temperament=.—An early difficulty in the case of keyed\r\ninstruments was the matter of tuning, caused by the fact that it was\r\nfound scientifically impossible to tune all the intervals of the scale\r\nat the same time to the true pitch; that is, the pitch demanded by\r\nthe natural overtones of the fundamental note of the scale. At the\r\noutset, for instance, it was found that if the fifths were tuned true,\r\nthe octaves would be a trifle sharp; and, conversely, if the octaves\r\nwere true, the fifths would be a trifle flat. In the case of stringed\r\ninstruments, where the tone was made by the performer, it could be\r\nso modified as not to conflict seriously; but with keyed instruments\r\nthis was impossible. Thus, many systems of tuning or “temperaments”\r\nwere tried, such as having two keys for two notes nearly in unison,\r\nlike F-sharp and G-flat, most of these resulting in the possibility of\r\nplaying in a few nearly related keys, to the exclusion of the others.\r\nFinally, through the influence of =J. S. Bach= (1685-1750) and the\r\nFrenchman =Rameau= (1683-1764), the simple expedient was definitely\r\nadopted of tuning the octaves true, and dividing each octave into\r\ntwelve equal parts, thus uniting such notes as F-sharp and G-flat in\r\none tone slightly out of tune with either, but not enough seriously to\r\noffend the ear. This, called “_equal temperament_,” was a great gain to\r\nmusic, since it not only removed a radical defect in keyed instruments,\r\nbut also opened the door to that free interchange of keys which has\r\ndone so much toward enriching the coloring and scope of succeeding\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on the Clavichord,\r\nVirginal, Spinet, Harpsichord, Pianoforte.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of the Pianoforte.\r\n\r\nBrinsmead.—History of the Pianoforte.\r\n\r\nRimbault.—The Pianoforte: Its Origin, Progress and Construction.\r\n\r\nSpillane.—History of the American Pianoforte.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat principle did the first attempts at piano-making recognize?\r\n\r\nTo what circumstance are we indebted for the attempt to make an\r\ninstrument of the Clavier type?\r\n\r\nWhat are the two classes of stringed instruments with keyboard as known\r\nin the 11th century?\r\n\r\nState the steps in the development of the Clavichord principle.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Clavichord.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Harpsichord principle.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Virginal and Spinet.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Harpsichord.\r\n\r\nWho was the inventor of the Pianoforte?

As these early instruments were at first merely substitutes\r\nfor the organ, which in turn was used simply to reduplicate voice\r\nparts, the music first played on them was in no wise different from the\r\nvocal and organ music of the day. When, moreover, music written for\r\nthe organ had some features distinct from purely vocal music, it was\r\nfrequently inscribed to be _played on the organ or clavier_, without\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Renaissance=.—As most of the patterns of musical\r\nform have proceeded from Italy, so it was there, in Venice, that\r\ninstrumental music seems to have emerged from its union with vocal\r\nmusic, and to have assumed the elements of a style of its own. This\r\nwas directly the result of the general awakening of thought after the\r\nDark Ages, known as the Renaissance, which, leading to independent\r\ninvestigation in the domains of science and art, brought in the\r\nonce unheard-of inventions and the discovery of new worlds, and in\r\nthe other a freedom of treatment fitted to express the new ideas\r\nsurging throughout the civilized world. Thus, in the first part of\r\nthe 16th century, while Raphael and Michael Angelo were voicing\r\nthese thoughts in their immortal creations, in Venice, a school of\r\nmusicians was turning its attention toward instrumental music, and\r\nstriving to produce in music a richness of color, just as the great\r\nVenetian painters, like Titian and Giorgione, were producing similar\r\neffects upon canvas. Teachers and students were congregating there,\r\nenthusiastic over the new ideas in music; and the focal point of all\r\nthis activity was the Church of St. Mark’s, whose magnificent double\r\norgan furnished an incentive to genius.\r\n\r\n=The First Sonata=.—Among these musicians were a number of apostles\r\nof the Netherlands school, of whom =Adrian Willaert= (1480-1562) was\r\nespecially honored and beloved. He and his successors, as organists at\r\nSt. Mark’s, wrote compositions for organ or clavier, which they taught\r\nto young ladies in the convents. Such compositions were made the more\r\npossible by the fact that into the old Church Modes, formed by using\r\nonly the tones represented by the white keys of our piano, “chromatic”\r\nor _colored_ tones came to be inserted; so that, in the course of the\r\n16th century, the modern scales, with their characteristic keynotes,\r\nor tonalities, came to vie with the old modes, and ultimately nearly\r\nto displace them, thus giving a chance for a variety and grouping of\r\nharmonies necessary in the elaboration of instrumental music. The name\r\nSonata, or “sound” piece, was at first given indiscriminately to such\r\ninstrumental works, in distinction from the Cantata, or vocal work.\r\n\r\n=Willaert and His Pupils=.—Willaert was especially successful as a\r\nteacher, and thus left a number of accomplished pupils to carry on\r\nhis labors. Of these, =Girolamo Parabosco= (1593-1609) was noted\r\nfor his free fantasias, and his improvisations of sonatas on the\r\nharpsichord; while =Claudio Merulo= of Correggio (1533-1604) wrote a\r\nnumber of toccatas, in which the old church chorale style was relieved\r\nby contrasting passages consisting of brilliant runs. The Toccata,\r\nor _touch_ piece, had, as its characteristics, such _quick running\r\npassages_, probably first suggested by the light tone and action of\r\nthe Clavier. While these runs had at first very little relevancy to\r\none another, they were much delighted in by these early pioneers, who\r\nsported with them as a child plays with a new toy.\r\n\r\n=The Gabrieli’s=.—Two other organists of St. Mark’s, =Andreas\r\nGabrieli= (1510-1586), and his nephew and pupil, =Giovanni Gabrieli=\r\n(1557-1613), added to the resources of instrumental music. The first of\r\nthese, a pupil of Willaert, himself became a famous teacher; and both\r\ncontributed many canzone and sonatas to organ and clavier literature.\r\nIn all these the subjects were distinct, and, in the canzone\r\nespecially, the many quick passages and changing rhythms were used in a\r\nmanner that contributed to unity.\r\n\r\n=The Harpsichord in Opera=.—A new factor now appeared in Florence,\r\ndestined greatly to further the cause of clavier music: namely,\r\nthe Opera. Taking the position of the conductor’s instrument, the\r\nharpsichord became the most useful member of the orchestra, and was\r\nemployed constantly to fill in vague harmonies, and to strike chords as\r\na support to the musical declamation of the singers. Such chords were\r\nnot generally written out, but were suggested by their bass note, over\r\nwhich figures were written to show their positions. To this shorthand\r\nsystem the name of Thorough-bass was given. In this way the value of\r\nchord combinations came to be recognized, and the relationships of such\r\nchords studied entirely apart from the voice writing; so the idea of a\r\nsingle melody, supported by occasional chords, was transplanted from\r\nthe Opera, and the modern harmonic style of music came into being.\r\n\r\n=Dance Tunes=.—But, in this new style, the old basis for Unity in\r\nthe composition, furnished by the imitation of one part by another,\r\nhad to be abandoned, since only one melodic part existed at a time;\r\nhence a new _basis_ had to be found in the manner in which _harmonies\r\nsucceeded_ each other. In determining such chord relationships,\r\ncomposers were obliged to look elsewhere than to the old Church music;\r\nand so turned their attention to the forms of Dance Tunes which\r\nhad already been in use for a long time among the people in their\r\nFolk-songs, and in the performances of the wandering minstrels. Most\r\nof these dance tunes were formed in a very simple _two-part_ design\r\nof harmony, consisting in a transition from the initial key to a\r\ncontrasting key, for the first part, and a return from the contrasting\r\nkey to the first key, in the second part.\r\n\r\n=Origin of the Suite=.—A book of such dances, based, however, on the\r\nclumsy church modes, was published in 1551. Later, however, such dances\r\ncame to be written in the new harmonic style; and by putting together a\r\nset of dances all in the same key but differing in rhythm and mode of\r\nexpression, a larger form of composition was devised, combining Variety\r\nwith Unity. To this form the name of Suite was given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIROLAMO FRESCOBALDI.]\r\n\r\n=Frescobaldi=.—Another element tending to give Unity to the composition\r\nwas developed when composers learned to work out a _single subject_,\r\nor melodic phrase representing a definite musical idea, by introducing\r\nit a number of times in the course of the composition, sometimes with\r\nslight variation, but always recognizable and used in such a way as to\r\nbind the various parts the more closely together by their similarity of\r\nconception. Several organists at Rome wrote music which possessed such\r\nunity of idea. One of these was =Girolamo Frescobaldi= (1583-1644), a\r\nman who was a close student of the best Italian music of his time, and\r\nwho had, moreover, been brought into contact with Netherlands ideas\r\nthrough travel in Belgium. On his first appearance as organist of St.\r\nPeter’s in Rome, in 1615, so great fame had preceded him that over\r\n30,000 people are said to have attended the performance. His skill on\r\nthe clavier was no less than that on the organ; and for both of these\r\ninstruments he wrote Ricercari, Canzone and Capricci, which showed\r\nconsiderable unity of subject, together with fluency in the treatment\r\nof chromatic progressions, and a wealth of invention, which displayed\r\nitself in novel themes and unusual harmonies; his compositions are well\r\nworth study.\r\n\r\n=Pasquini=.—In the second half of the 17th century, =Bernardo Pasquini=\r\n(1637-1710), a pupil of the opera composer Cesti, carried on the work\r\nat Rome. In his toccati he shows great freedom in departing from the\r\nstrict vocal style, and his clavier works have features, like the\r\nsustained trill, which distinguish them decidedly from organ works.\r\n\r\n=Method of Playing the Clavier=.—The method of playing the clavier used\r\nby these old masters was peculiar. In a work on the subject published\r\nby Di Ruta, about the year 1600, the rules given include holding the\r\nfingers out _flat_ on the keys, and scarcely using the thumb at all,\r\nallowing it to hang below the level of the keyboard. The scales were\r\nplayed each with _two_ fingers, according to fixed rules; so that\r\nsmoothness combined with rapidity seems to have been made impossible.\r\n\r\n=The Sonata and Overture=.—Starting with the harmonic form of the old\r\ndance tunes, composers now began to elaborate this to a form capable\r\nof expressing more serious ideas, by giving more definiteness to the\r\nmusical subject treated, and by introducing material derived from\r\nthe old vocal forms. =Corelli=, the violinist (1653-1713), and the\r\nviolinists of his school, restricted the name Sonata to combinations\r\nof such movements, in distinction from the lighter forms of the Suite;\r\nand the celebrated opera composer, =Alessandro Scarlatti= (1659-1725),\r\napplied similar methods to the composition of his operatic overtures,\r\nwriting them in three parts: first, a moderately fast movement, which\r\nwas followed by a slow movement, the whole closing with a movement in\r\nquick tempo.\r\n\r\n=Domenico Scarlatti=.—Clavier music lagged somewhat behind violin\r\nmusic, owing to the greater perfection of the violin as an instrument,\r\nand also to the popularity of the lute, which was much affected in\r\nfashionable circles. Finally, however, a man appeared who possessed\r\nthe genius to develop the peculiar resources of the harpsichord to a\r\nremarkable extent. This was =Domenico Scarlatti=, the son and pupil of\r\nAlessandro Scarlatti. The latter was himself a skilful clavier player\r\nand composer; but his son attained a proficiency so far eclipsing that\r\nof any of his predecessors as to place him entirely without the pale of\r\ncomparison with any of them. Domenico Scarlatti, who was born at Naples\r\nin 1683, two years before Handel and Bach, first attracted attention\r\nwhen about twenty-one years old, as an opera composer; but achieved\r\nhis greatest successes as a virtuoso on the harpsichord, winning a\r\nworld-wide reputation for his wonderful playing, which was a revelation\r\nof what could be done with this hitherto undeveloped instrument. In one\r\nof Handel’s Italian journeys a contest of skill was instituted between\r\nthese two musical giants; and the result was a drawn battle so far as\r\nthe harpsichord was concerned, although Handel triumphed at the organ.\r\nScarlatti traveled about somewhat, spending most of his later life in\r\nthe position of court music master at Madrid. He finally returned to\r\nhis birthplace, where he died in 1757.\r\n\r\n=Scarlatti’s Use of Form=.—In the matter of form, Scarlatti developed\r\nstill further the work of his predecessors, applying to the harpsichord\r\nthe principles asserted by Corelli and his school. His Sonatas were\r\nwritten in _one movement_ only, and have very _definite subjects_,\r\nwhich are carried out along recognized lines. His Capriccii—short\r\npieces written in a rhythmic and delicately staccato style—are some of\r\nhis best works, and undoubtedly paved the way for the Scherzi, written\r\nby Beethoven and Mendelssohn. His compositions are short, but concise\r\nand definite.\r\n\r\n=Scarlatti’s Style of Playing=.—But his chief addition to musical\r\nmaterial lies in the new style of playing which he invented. Novel\r\neffects, like crossing the hands, long leaps, broken chords in contrary\r\nmotion, rapidly repeated notes, and runs in thirds and sixths—effects\r\nwhich were in many cases far ahead of his time, since they were not\r\nused by succeeding composers until a much later period—were employed\r\nby him with the utmost fluency, so that he has been aptly called the\r\nfather of modern pianoforte technic.\r\n\r\n[Music: EXAMPLES OF SCARLATTI’S STYLE.]\r\n\r\n=Durante=.—The Neapolitan school boasted several other worthy clavier\r\ncomposers, who contributed in various ways to the composition of the\r\nSonata. One of these was =Francesco Durante= (1684-1755), who wrote\r\nsonatas in two movements of different character but in the same key.\r\nThe first, called a Studio, was written as a free fugue with running\r\npassages; the second, or Divertimento, was more animated and less\r\nscholastic. =Domenico Alberti= (1707-1740) composed sonatas similar in\r\ngeneral form, but of less artistic worth, consisting as they did simply\r\nof a single-voiced melody, supported by an harmonic accompaniment\r\nhaving no independence of style. Much of this was in the form of broken\r\nchords, a mannerism which was afterwards used to excess, and became\r\ndubbed the “Alberti bass.” This accompaniment form doubtless suited\r\nthe clavichord and harpsichord, but is not so well adapted to the more\r\nsonorous modern piano. It is still used by composers for very simple\r\naccompaniments.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n=Pier Domenico Paradies= (1710-1792) deserves special mention as the\r\nwriter of elegant and well-balanced clavier music. He first won success\r\nas a composer of operas, which were given in Italy, and afterwards in\r\nLondon, where he finally settled as clavier teacher. His sonatas have\r\ntwo movements, like Durante’s, and contain brilliant allegros, besides\r\nattractive melodies. His two-part rapid contrapuntal work is excellent,\r\nboth for musical merit and for technical study.\r\n\r\n=Summary=.—We have seen, then, that in the 16th century, in Italy,\r\ninstrumental music began to break from its union with vocal music; that\r\nthe Opera brought the harpsichord especially into notice in the 17th\r\ncentury, on account of its availability for accompaniments, and that\r\nfinally, in the 18th century, the Neapolitan composers developed for\r\nit a style which took advantage of its peculiar resources, and applied\r\nthem to the enrichment of the harmonic forms which were coming into\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Pianoforte Playing.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nJ.

The many Folk-songs\r\nwhich have come down from a very early period bear witness to the\r\nEnglish love of conviviality. Dance tunes, sometimes based on these\r\nFolk-songs, were played on the instruments of the minstrels, which,\r\nas early as 1484, included the clavichord; and the fact that such\r\ninstruments were cultivated by people of higher rank is shown by the\r\nrecord that James IV of Scotland and his queen purchased clavichords\r\nto play upon, in 1503, while the queen of Henry VII of England bought\r\na clavichord for her private use in 1502. The virginal is spoken of\r\nin the reign of Henry VII; Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547), who was an\r\naccomplished musician, played upon both these instruments, and also\r\nwrote music for them.\r\n\r\n=To Queen Elizabeth’s Time=.—Edward VI (r. 1547-1553) had three duly\r\nappointed virginal players among his court musicians; and after\r\nElizabeth (r. 1558-1603) ascended the throne, the virginal increased\r\nin popularity; indeed, its name was formerly thought to have been\r\nderived from her as the virgin queen; although the fact that the\r\ninstrument was spoken of as the virginal before her reign makes its\r\nderivation from its popularity among young ladies the more probable.\r\nQueen Elizabeth, as well as her sister Mary, received instruction in\r\nvirginal playing during her early youth, and became an accomplished\r\nperformer; and instances are shown of the former’s great pride in this\r\naccomplishment. In the course of her illustrious reign, when all\r\nthe arts flourished to a remarkable degree, and when great wits and\r\nlitterateurs vied with each other in the genius of their productions,\r\nthe art of music received its share of attention also. The fact that\r\nmusical degrees were early given at the great universities, Oxford and\r\nCambridge, tended to raise the standard of musical knowledge, and to\r\nproduce a number of composers who were especially gifted in the more\r\nserious Church forms of writing. Many such, connected with the Royal\r\nChapel and the court, wrote excellent anthems and secular part-songs;\r\nand now, attracted by the popularity of the instrument, they began to\r\ngive a more worthy setting to the folk and dance tunes played on the\r\nclavier.\r\n\r\n=Dance Tunes=.—A clavier composition is extant, dated 1555, by =William\r\nBlitheman=, an English church composer, consisting of a chorale-like\r\nmelody in whole notes, accompanied first by a flowing eighth-note\r\nfigure, and next by triplet quarter notes, with a third voice added\r\nlater. Such a serious style prefigured the variations upon dance tunes,\r\nwhich were especially cultivated by =William Byrd= (1538-1623). In such\r\nvariations the melody was first harmonized in simple fashion, and was\r\nafterwards played several times in the same part, with slight changes,\r\nwhile the accompanying parts were varied in rhythm and style, becoming\r\ngenerally quicker in tempo. To modern ears the result is monotonous,\r\nas the same key and time signature is maintained throughout; but the\r\nvariety in presentation must have been grateful after the simplicity of\r\nthe dance tunes.\r\n\r\n=The Virginal Book=.—Other popular forms were the Fancie, in which\r\nseveral melodic subjects were imitated in the various voices; and\r\nthe Pavane, a dance in common time, whose theme was repeated in the\r\nfollowing Galliarde, a dance in triple time. These and other forms\r\nare used in a curious collection of clavier pieces now preserved\r\nat Cambridge, and known as Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book. This\r\ncollection, consisting of four hundred and eighteen manuscript pages,\r\nwritten on a six-lined staff, contains seventy compositions by Byrd,\r\nbesides others by most of the composers of the Elizabethan era, like\r\nTallis, Dr. Bull, Giles, Farnaby and many others.\r\n\r\n=Leading Elizabethan Composers=.—Byrd was a pupil of =Thomas Tallis=\r\n(d. 1585), the renowned church composer, and together they were made\r\norganists of Queen Elizabeth’s Chapel, in 1575, receiving also the sole\r\nright to print music. Another musician who deserves special mention\r\nis =Dr. John Bull= (1563-1628), who won world-wide fame as organist\r\nand clavier player, finally becoming organist at Antwerp Cathedral,\r\nwhich post he held until his death. His clavier compositions show great\r\ntechnical fluency. =Orlando Gibbons= (1583-1625), a Doctor of Music at\r\nOxford, and organist at Westminster Abbey, wrote excellently in the\r\nprevailing style. Shakespeare testifies to the popularity of clavier\r\nplaying at this time in one of his sonnets, where he speaks of the keys\r\nas\r\n\r\n    “O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait.”\r\n\r\nAlthough these early English composers wrote with musical solidity,\r\ntheir compositions can scarcely be said to have added much to the\r\ndevelopment of the instrumental style, or to clavier technic; and,\r\nin fact, they amounted to little more than a side issue in music,\r\nwithdrawn from the general advancement, and valuable chiefly as\r\ncuriosities. The melodies were apt to be wearisome, through monotonous\r\nrepetitions, the rhythms to lack variety, and the modulations to appear\r\nchiefly in the form of unsuccessful attempts.\r\n\r\n=The Parthenia=.—During the first half of the 17th century the virginal\r\nretained its popularity, although political turmoils prevented much\r\npositive advancement in music. The “Parthenia,” a volume containing the\r\nfirst printed collection of virginal music, appeared in 1611, composed\r\nof twenty-one pieces by Byrd, Bull and Gibbons; and a similar volume\r\nfollowed, with compositions for virginal and bass viol, by Robert Hole.\r\n\r\n=Purcell=.—In the reign of Charles II (1660-1685) music again came\r\nto the fore, and was ably promoted by =Henry Purcell=, who was born\r\nin the year when Cromwell died, 1658, and died in 1695. Purcell is a\r\nshining figure in English musical history, through his ability as an\r\nopera composer, in which capacity he produced bright and pithy works,\r\nthoroughly English in spirit, and healthy in tone. He published a\r\nvolume of twelve clavier sonatas in 1683, with parts also for two\r\nviolins and a bass viol, founded on the model of the Italian violin\r\nsonatas, each having an Adagio, a Canzona, a slow movement and an Air.\r\nLater he published other sonatas, besides suites and separate pieces\r\nfor the clavier. Upon the advent of Handel, however, the English\r\ncomposers became, for the most part, mere imitators of his style, which\r\nhad so caught the national ear as to well-nigh eclipse all other kinds\r\nof music. The early English school, therefore, can be said to have had\r\nits last exponent in the person of Purcell.\r\n\r\n=Rise of the French School=.—In France a school of clavier compositions\r\ndeveloped during the brilliant reign of Louis XIV (1643-1715), which\r\ndid much toward imparting elegance and polish, besides characteristic\r\nrhythms and technical figures, to clavier music. The head of this\r\nschool and the personal teacher of many succeeding clavier composers\r\nand players was =Andre Champion de Chambonnières= (d. 1670), who\r\nbecame court clavier player to the king. He is said to have been\r\nmaster of a full tone on the harpsichord attained by none other than\r\nhimself; he also published two books of clavier compositions, written\r\nin the pure harmonic style, and showing the tendency toward brilliant\r\nembellishments which became a characteristic of his successors. Of\r\nhis pupils, =Jean Henry d’Anglebert= (d. 1691), was clavier player at\r\ncourt, and published in 1689 a book containing clavier arrangements\r\nof airs and dances from the operas of Lully, with rules for their\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n=The Couperin Family=.—Two, at least, of the famous musical family of\r\nCouperin also came under the instruction of Champion. These were =Louis\r\nCouperin= (1630-1665), and =François Couperin= (1631-1701), who, with\r\ntheir brother =Charles Couperin= (1638-1669), and his son =François\r\nCouperin=, called “le Grand” (1668-1733), were all at various times\r\norganists of the church of St. Gervais, at Paris. The Couperins may be\r\nconsidered as classic composers for the clavier, as their style, though\r\nhaving an harmonic basis, was mostly in the line of instrumental voice\r\nwriting. The first-named published three suites of dances for clavier;\r\nand the second was eminently popular as a teacher.\r\n\r\n=François Couperin=.—François Couperin, “le Grand,” deserves special\r\nattention, and has been called the _first great composer_ distinctively\r\n_for the clavier_. He was a pupil of the organist Thomelin, and rose\r\nquickly to so commanding a position as player of the organ and clavier\r\nthat, in 1701, he was appointed court clavier player and organist\r\nat the Royal Chapel. He was very accurate as a composer; and in the\r\nfour books of clavier pieces which he published successively, he gave\r\nminute directions for interpreting the wealth of ornamentation with\r\nwhich his melodies are surrounded. Most of these pieces are _written\r\nin two voices_, with the upper melody most prominent; and they reflect\r\nthe artificial show and glitter of the French court in their endless\r\n_turns_ and _embellishments_. Yet for this very reason they have\r\namplified the resources of clavier compositions, preparing the way for\r\ncomposers like Scarlatti, Bach and Handel. Many of them show the French\r\ntaste toward attaching definite meaning to music, by their fanciful\r\ntitles, like “La tendre Nanette,” “La Flatteuse”—a custom followed by\r\nothers of this school. Couperin wrote also a treatise on clavier touch,\r\nand was _one of the first to make use of the thumb in playing_.\r\n\r\n=Louis Marchand= (1669-1732) was a brilliant though dissipated figure\r\nin clavier playing. Becoming organist at the court of Versailles, he\r\nlost the post through his reckless habits, and, going to Dresden, he\r\nwas somewhat subdued in his conceit by the evident superiority of Bach.\r\nOn his return to Paris, he became exceedingly popular as a teacher,\r\nalthough his extravagant style of living brought him finally to\r\npoverty. His pupil, =Louis Claude Daquin= (1694-1772), received through\r\nhim an appointment as organist at the church of St. Paul, in preference\r\nto Rameau, of whose superiority Marchand became jealous. Daquin\r\npublished a number of rather superficial clavier pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN-PHILLIPPE RAMEAU.]\r\n\r\n=Jean-Phillippe Rameau=, the last and greatest light of this school,\r\nhas even greater fame as an opera composer. He was born at Dijon in\r\n1683, and displayed so great musical talent when a mere child that,\r\nalthough his parents had intended him for another profession, he was\r\nfinally sent to Italy to study music. After spending some time there,\r\nhe joined the orchestra of an opera troupe, traveling about France and\r\ngaining an insight into dramatic composition. Upon going to Paris he\r\nstudied with Marchand, who recognized and feared his talent, and who\r\nfinally was the means of his leaving Paris. Later, however, he obtained\r\nan organ position outside of Paris, and soon attracted attention\r\nnot only by his playing, but also by the publication, in 1726, of a\r\ntreatise on Harmony. In this he _reduced_ the study of _chords_ to\r\na _scientific foundation_, and won his title of the name of creator\r\nof the modern science of Harmony. Returning to Paris, he now secured\r\nan organ position there, and set to work upon the series of dramatic\r\nproductions which made him the foremost opera composer of his day,\r\nsuperior even to the popular Lully. In 1737, he published another\r\ntheoretical work, in which the principles of Equal Temperament, which\r\nJ. S. Bach had adopted fifteen years before, were so clearly stated as\r\nto make their establishment permanent for future composers. Rameau’s\r\ntheories were the subject of much controversy in his day; but many\r\ndistinguished contemporaries, like Rousseau and Voltaire, were his warm\r\npartisans. He died in 1764.\r\n\r\n=Rameau’s Clavier Works=.—His numerous _clavier compositions_ show\r\ngreat advance in freedom of expression, and are written mostly in\r\n_three parts_, with an occasional succession of full chords. Many of\r\nthese have _descriptive titles_, such as “La Poule,” in which the\r\ncackling of a hen is cleverly imitated. Others are in the form of dance\r\nsuites. The order of Prelude, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue was\r\nmade the basis of these suites as well as those of Couperin, although\r\nthis order admitted of considerable variation; and no other principle\r\nof Unity appears in them, with the exception of a _common key_.\r\n\r\n=End of the Early French School=.—The growing importance of the German\r\nschool now came to be felt in France so strongly that the French school\r\ncame to lose its individuality. We therefore turn our attention to the\r\nimportant developments in instrumental music which were effected in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Pianoforte Playing.\r\n\r\nRimbault.—The Pianoforte.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.\r\n\r\nHenderson.—Preludes and Studies.\r\n\r\nNaylor.—An Elizabethan Virginal Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUSICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann’s History, pages 314-329.\r\n\r\nRimbault.—“The Pianoforte,” pages 237, 240, 245, 248, 253, 262-283, 316.\r\n\r\nLitolff Ed., No. 397, 2nd vol. of “Music by Old Masters.”\r\n\r\nAugener Ed., Nos. 8300, 8299.\r\n\r\nBreitkopf Ed., as for Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nTell about early English instrumental music.\r\n\r\nTell about music in Queen Elizabeth’s time.\r\n\r\nDescribe the Variation form used by Byrd.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Virginal Book?\r\n\r\nWhat was the style of the Elizabethan composers?\r\n\r\nWhat was the “Parthenia”?\r\n\r\nGive an account of Purcell and his work.\r\n\r\nWho was the founder of the French school?\r\n\r\nWhat family figures prominently in the French school?\r\n\r\nWho was the greatest member of this family?

So it happened, in the history\r\nof instrumental music, that they were the ones to invent and give to\r\nother nations the vehicle of expression, while it remained for their\r\npupils, notably, in this case, the composers of Germany, to fill these\r\nforms out with the expression of real and deep feeling. The German\r\ntendency toward serious and philosophical thought found the intricacies\r\nof polyphonic music, or the simultaneous flow of independent melodies,\r\nadmirably adapted to their need of expression; and when this style\r\nof voice writing was applied to instrumental compositions, German\r\nmusicians found a branch of art in which they were admirably qualified\r\nto excel. So, from being mere pupils of the Italians, they advanced\r\nto the production of works of much more distinguished character and\r\ndeeper, richer content than was possible to mere beauty of form and\r\nmelody.\r\n\r\n=Hasler=.—In the second half of the 16th century, the clavier was\r\npopular in Germany, disputing the place of the lute as a social\r\ninstrument, although organ and clavier compositions were identical, as\r\nin Italy. There is a record of the publication of two books of pieces\r\nfor organ and “instrument”—by which is meant the clavier—in 1575-77,\r\nin which there were dance tunes with accompanying chords. =Hans Leo\r\nHasler= (1564-1612), a pupil of A. Gabrieli, and fellow-student with\r\nG. Gabrieli, was especially prominent as organ and clavier player and\r\ncomposer during this epoch, publishing a number of such dances written\r\nfor the organ or the clavier.\r\n\r\n=Froberger=.—The devastating Thirty Years’ War (1618-48) put an end to\r\nartistic ambition during its progress. However, art quickly recovered\r\nat its close, and a number of worthy musicians appeared. An interesting\r\nfigure among them, and a man who has been called the first German\r\nclavier virtuoso, was =Johann Jacob Froberger= (1605-1667). Showing\r\ngreat promise as a boy, he was brought to the notice of the Austrian\r\nKaiser, Ferdinand III, who sent him to Rome, where he studied with\r\nFrescobaldi for three years. After this we hear of him as a successful\r\nperformer at Paris, and, on his return to Vienna, as court organist,\r\nin which position he won widespread fame. A remarkable story is told\r\nof a perilous journey to England, where he arrived penniless, and\r\nof his subsequent recognition and his cordial reception by Charles\r\nII, who was delighted with his improvisation upon the harpsichord.\r\nAfterwards returning to Vienna, he resigned his post there, through\r\nsome disagreement, and lived afterwards in retirement. In a number of\r\nCaprices, Toccatas and the like, written in the contrapuntal style,\r\nhe definitely adopted the five-lined staff, and introduced many\r\nembellishments, after the French fashion. He possessed much charming\r\nmelodic invention, and, in his Toccatas employed a treatment of his\r\nsubject in definite sections, which afterwards appeared in the fugue\r\nform. Froberger anticipates the _program style_ of music, as he is said\r\nto have improvised descriptions of events, like that of the Count von\r\nThurn’s crossing of the Rhine, which he depicted in twenty-six pieces.\r\n\r\n=Johann Kaspar Kerl= (1625-90), also sent by Ferdinand III to\r\nRome, studied there with Carissimi, the oratorio writer, becoming\r\naccomplished as an extemporizer. He occupied a number of organ\r\npositions in Vienna and Munich, also teaching the clavier, and wrote\r\ncompositions which show a tendency toward the modern scale systems.\r\n=Johann Pachelbel= (1653-1706), celebrated as organ and clavier\r\nplayer, wrote pleasing works for the clavier, in which he tried to\r\nfollow out the characteristics of the instrument. Many of these were\r\nin the form of variations. =Georg Muffat= (d. 1704) showed in his\r\ncompositions a tendency toward French ornamentation, and his son\r\n=Gottlieb= (1683-1770), a pupil of the contrapuntist J. J. Fux, was\r\norganist to the Kaiser Charles VI, in Vienna, and clavier teacher to\r\nthe Imperial family. His clavier compositions were in the form of\r\nVersettes and Toccatas.\r\n\r\n=Eighteenth Century Clavier Composers=.—The Thirty Years’ War\r\nexercised a demoralizing influence upon music trades, and many\r\nexcellent musicians were unable to have their compositions published\r\nin consequence. The result is, that comparatively few specimens of the\r\nworks of the composers mentioned have come down to us in available\r\nform. Approaching the 18th century, we now come to a group of composers\r\nwho represent the most brilliant epoch of early clavier work. Their\r\nproductions, while retaining the dignity and complexity of the\r\ncontrapuntal school, yet use its material with a freedom of modulation\r\nand of dissonant chords sufficient to express genuine emotional ideas\r\nthrough their medium.\r\n\r\n=Reinken and Buxtehude=.—The Hamburg organist =Johann Adam Reinken=\r\n(1623-1722), a native of Holland, wrote a number of clavier\r\ncompositions, publishing in 1704, pieces for two violins and\r\nharpsichord. =Dietrich Buxtehude= (1637-1707), organist at St. Mary’s\r\nChurch, Lübeck, from 1668, excelled in free style of writing for\r\nclavier. The latter gave a series of Sunday evening concerts at his\r\nchurch which gained renown through all the surrounding country; and J.\r\nS. Bach himself is said to have walked to these concerts, a distance of\r\nfifty miles.\r\n\r\n=Instrumental Polyphonic Forms=.—These men have been mentioned largely\r\nbecause their work made possible the results which Bach afterwards\r\nattained from an elaboration of what they had already accomplished. It\r\nwas among such eminent German organists that the instrumental Fugue,\r\nthe highest instrumental type of polyphonic music, took definite\r\nshape, consisting of an Exposition, in which the Subject, Answer and\r\nCountersubject were announced by the various voices; and a subsequent\r\nDevelopment, in which, according to certain laws more or less strict,\r\nthe material presented was carried through a variety of phases and\r\nbrought finally to a triumphant close. Of other forms, like the Toccata\r\nand Canzona, the tendency came to be toward more freedom of treatment\r\non the one hand, and an increasing definiteness and consistency on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n=Handel’s Early Life=.—A composer must now be mentioned whose work\r\nlay chiefly in other fields than the clavier, but who nevertheless\r\ndrew much of his inspiration from the strings of the harpsichord. This\r\nwas =George Frederick Handel= (1685-1759), who was born at Halle, and\r\nwhose musical genius asserted itself so strenuously that, although\r\nhis father was strongly opposed, he learned the harpsichord as a mere\r\nchild, and became so proficient a performer that the reigning Duke\r\nof Saxe-Weissenfels, hearing him play, insisted on his receiving a\r\nthorough musical education. So he was placed under Zachau, a competent\r\norganist and musician, at his native place, with whom he studied\r\ndiligently. After his father’s death he went to Hamburg, entering the\r\norchestra of the Opera house and rising to the post of harpsichordist.\r\nLaunching out as an opera composer, he began to acquire a reputation,\r\nand in 1706 went to Italy, meeting many distinguished musicians there,\r\namong them Domenico Scarlatti, with whom he had a contest as to ability\r\nas clavichordist and organist, and winning fresh laurels.\r\n\r\n=Handel in England=.—In 1707, he became music director to the Elector\r\nof Hanover, but quickly left the post for England, where, with the\r\nexception of short intervals, he passed the remainder of his life,\r\nbecoming a naturalized English subject. It was no wonder that he was\r\nso warmly attached to his adopted country, since he became the popular\r\nidol, even winning over the king, George I, formerly Elector of\r\nHanover, who, on his accession to the throne, was at first angry with\r\nHandel for his desertion of the post in his service at Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE FRIEDRICH HANDEL.]\r\n\r\n=Handel’s Operas and Oratorios=.—Handel was of an irascible\r\ndisposition, and, living in the artificial atmosphere of London,\r\namong wits and satirists like Dr. Johnson, Addison and Pope, he was\r\nconstantly embroiled with the cabals of his rivals, and the fickleness\r\nof the public. He produced a great number of operas, most of them\r\nsuccessful; but as theatrical manager he met with severe losses, and\r\nfinally gave up opera writing in despair, and turned to the composition\r\nof oratorios. The result was that in this form he has left his most\r\nenduring and elevated compositions; for while his operas were sometimes\r\nwritten down to the popular taste for empty Italian melody, the lofty\r\nthemes of his oratorios inspired him to his grandest and most sincere\r\nstyle, which, moreover, was rendered the more dramatic and intelligible\r\nby his knowledge of the requirements of his audiences.\r\n\r\n=Handel’s Clavier Works=.—Handel was an expert performer on the\r\nharpsichord, for which he wrote two sets of Suites, besides a number of\r\nsingle pieces. The Suites, of which the first set is by far the better,\r\nare written mostly in the _dance forms_, but with the interpolation\r\nof more serious forms, such as Airs, Variations and Fugues. The\r\n_contrapuntal style_ is here most _prominent_, although _with harmonic\r\nbasis_, and with a laxity in the strictness of the voice writing,\r\ncaused by the occasional use of extra notes to complete chords. Some of\r\nthe variations are worked up to effective climaxes, and have running\r\npassages and broken chords, in which the resources of the clavier are\r\ncleverly drawn upon.\r\n\r\n=Handel’s Last Years=.—Handel became blind in 1752, but continued to\r\ntake part in the performances of his works till the year of his death.\r\nCholeric as was his temperament, the known generosity of his nature and\r\nhis devotion to the ideals of his art made him the idol of the English\r\npeople. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n=Mattheson=.—A close associate of Handel, when he was in the Hamburg\r\norchestra, was =Johann Mattheson= (1681-1764), famed for his literary\r\nwritings on musical subjects no less than for his musical ability. He\r\nwrote suites, a sonata and fugues in two parts, for clavier, which were\r\nof excellent workmanship.\r\n\r\n=Bach’s Early Life=.—But all other names in the domain of polyphonic\r\ninstrumental music pale before that of =Johann Sebastian Bach=, the\r\nculmination of the school of voice writing, and the musician who put\r\nthe stamp of greatness on all former styles, while at the same time\r\nacting as guide to future fields of composition. Born at Eisenach in\r\n1685, as a scion of a family the members of which had been musical\r\nleaders for generations, he seems to have embodied in himself the\r\nsum of the genius of his forefathers. The story of his life is a\r\nprosaic one, as he filled it with unflagging industry, carrying out\r\nhis unswerving ideals of his art, caring little for mere popularity,\r\nand rearing a large family of sons and daughters, some of whom proved\r\nworthy to continue his work. As a boy, he lost both parents at the\r\nage of ten, and was taught clavier playing by his elder brother,\r\nJohann Christian, who took him in charge. He seized with avidity every\r\nopportunity to study his beloved music, copying hundreds of pages of\r\nmanuscript, listening to every musical performance possible, drinking\r\nin and assimilating the ideas thus gained, to reproduce them later on,\r\nstamped with his genius.\r\n\r\n=Later Life=.—At his brother’s death he went to Lüneburg as choir\r\nboy, where he became acquainted with Reinken’s work. At eighteen he\r\nwas violinist in the court band at Weimar, shortly afterward becoming\r\norganist at a church at Arnstadt. His next position was as court\r\norganist at Weimar, in 1708, where many of his most important organ\r\ncompositions were written. This post he left in 1717 for that of court\r\nchapel-master at Anhalt-Köthen, where he remained six years, after\r\nwhich he went to Leipzig, as Cantor of the Thomasschule, staying there\r\ntill his death, in 1750.\r\n\r\n=Incidents of Bach’s Career=.—Bach’s life was not altogether a happy\r\none, as he was much annoyed at the persecutions of his rivals; and,\r\nlike Handel, he was afflicted with blindness in his last years. Never\r\nconsidering the element of mere popularity in his work, his greatness\r\nwas little appreciated in his lifetime; and it was fifty years after\r\nhis death before it began to receive recognition. A pleasant incident\r\nof his declining years was his cordial reception by Frederick the Great\r\nat his court, in 1747, where Bach’s son was in favor as harpsichord\r\nplayer, and where Bach was shown a number of excellent new Silbermann\r\npianofortes. It is a curious circumstance that he and Handel, although\r\nborn in the same year, were destined never to meet.\r\n\r\n=The Well-Tempered Clavichord=.—It has been stated that Bach adopted\r\nthe principle of Equal Temperament for clavier tuning. In support\r\nof this he wrote twenty-four preludes and fugues, one in each major\r\nand minor key, requiring, therefore, equal temperament for their\r\nperformance; and later added a second similar volume. The whole\r\nforty-eight make up the monumental work called the “Well-Tempered\r\nClavichord”; and this work, written originally for the clavichord,\r\nhas remained the bulwark of piano playing to the present day. Its\r\nfugues, written with consummate mastery of the technic of instrumental\r\npolyphony, are not only models of skill in voice writing, but also are\r\nmade the vehicles of genuine moods and emotions; while each preceding\r\nprelude gives the keynote of expression to its following fugue,\r\nalthough written in a much freer style, frequently closely allied with\r\nthe works of the purely harmonic school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH.]\r\n\r\n=Bach’s Other Clavier Works=.—Bach wrote also sonatas and concertos,\r\nthe latter for one, two or three claviers, sometimes with string\r\naccompaniment. These works, although comprising several movements, _do\r\nnot_ otherwise _coincide_ with the _harmonic sonata form_, since their\r\nstyle is more polyphonic, and since they are occupied mainly with the\r\n_development_ of a _single_ subject. His suites, of which he wrote two\r\nsets, called respectively English and French, are no less important,\r\nsince in them the dance forms are invested with a seriousness and an\r\nartistic finish hitherto unattained. Of other clavier works, his famous\r\n“Chromatic Fantasie” has a wealth of harmonic combinations, fiery runs\r\nand arpeggios, and dramatic recitative which give it a worthy place in\r\nthe Romantic school developed much later, and of whose style it was\r\nthe forerunner. His “Inventions,” studies written originally for his\r\nchildren, in two or three parts, are an excellent introduction to the\r\nstudy of his larger works.\r\n\r\n=Reforms in Fingering=.—Another gift of Bach’s to coming generations\r\nwas his _thorough revision of clavier playing_. Raising the hand above\r\nthe keys from its former flat position, he _brought the thumb into\r\nuse_, and by inventing the scale fingering, afterwards universally\r\nadopted, he opened the way to the style of brilliant and smoothly\r\nrunning passages which was afterwards so highly developed. Thus Bach,\r\nwhile putting the final touch to the old forms, gave an impetus to the\r\nharmonic style, which was then in its infancy, and of which we shall\r\nnow trace the course.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. I.

Finally, just as the Fugue came to be adopted\r\nas the highest form of the old school, so the Sonata was chosen as\r\nthe most dignified exponent of the new art. But, while the old school\r\narrived at a high state of perfection at the hands of Handel and Bach,\r\nthe necessity for inventing and experimenting with the possibilities of\r\nthe new forms made the first attempts in this direction seem childish\r\nand crude beside Bach’s work; so that it was several generations\r\nafter him before the harmonic style was brought to the stage at which\r\nit could be made to express ideas of equal magnitude, and do it\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n=Development of the Sonata=.—The original plan associated with the\r\nSonata was that of combining several movements in such a way as\r\nto appeal, in the completed product, to all kinds of _emotion_,\r\n_intellectual_, _spiritual_ and _physical_. In the hands of its\r\nfounders, the Italian violinists, the exposition of this thought had\r\nbeen mainly contrapuntal. We have seen how Domenico Scarlatti arrived\r\nat a style in which a single part, supported by an accompaniment, was\r\napplied to the clavier, in a manner which brought out its striking\r\ncharacteristics; and we have now to trace the progress of this style in\r\nGermany, up to the point where the various contributions of different\r\ncomposers could be united into a systematic and fixed form, sufficient\r\nfor the free expression of the highest musical inspiration, and adapted\r\nto all the varied demands of instrumental music.\r\n\r\n=Essential Elements of a Sonata=.—Certain points seem to have been\r\ngenerally agreed upon as necessary components of the Sonata. The\r\nfirst was its _union_ of _several movements_, from two up to five, or\r\noccasionally even more. The second was that the _first movement_ should\r\ndisplay the most _ingenuity_ and _elaboration_. This movement thus\r\ncame to receive the most attention, and showed a process of evolution\r\nfrom the simple dance form consisting of a modulation from a principal\r\nkey to a contrasting key and back again, to a _highly organised_ and\r\nconventional _art-form_—a form, moreover, of such a capacity that it\r\ncould be used as the mould for the principal movement of a wide range\r\nof compositions, from a short pianoforte sonata to a grand symphony.\r\n\r\n=Changes in the Old Dance Form=.—In this evolution, the first half\r\nof the dance form was made to consist of a Subject, either thematic\r\nor melodic, clearly defining the key, and then a modulating passage,\r\ngenerally freer in its runs and arpeggios, leading up to the point of\r\ncontrast; and the first section was then repeated. The greatest changes\r\ntook place in the second half. At first, this consisted in the repeat\r\nof the Principal Theme in the contrasting key, and a return to the\r\nfirst key through modulations similar to those in the first section;\r\nlater, however, since this design gave little opportunity for a display\r\nof the composer’s originality, the enunciation of the Subject in the\r\ncontrasting key was followed by a free passage, which gave ample scope\r\nto the composer’s fancy; after which the subject again appeared in the\r\nprincipal key, with a concluding passage in the same key.\r\n\r\n=Establishment of the Cyclic Form=.—The form as a whole was now\r\npractically divided into three sections, and a better balance was\r\ngiven to this division by the omission of the second appearance of the\r\nSubject in the contrasting key, and the substitution of other material,\r\neither relevant or contrasting. The movement now assumed a cyclic\r\nform—a statement, leading to a point of contrast, a free fantasia,\r\nand finally the statement, leading to a close. This was practically\r\nthe course of development of what has been named the Sonata Form, up\r\nto the time of Haydn. We are now prepared to consider the especial\r\ncontributions of composers to this form.\r\n\r\n=First Printed Clavier Sonata=.—The first printed clavier sonata seems\r\nto have been published by =Johann Kuhnau= (1660?-1722). This was in the\r\nkey of B-flat, and was the last of several pieces in the same volume.\r\nIn the preface, the author gives a semi-apology for its introduction,\r\nsaying that he sees no reason why sonatas should not be written for the\r\nclavier as well as for any other instrument. This sonata begins with\r\nan Allegro, followed by a fugal movement; and in the following Adagio\r\nmovement, the tendency to put the slow movement into a contrasting key\r\nis illustrated, as this is in D-flat major. After another Allegro,\r\nthere is a _Da Capo_ to the first part.\r\n\r\n=Other Sonatas by Kuhnau=.—It was difficult for the early sonata\r\nwriters to break away entirely from the old polyphonic style; and when\r\na part appeared in the nature of a Free Fantasia, they generally had\r\nrecourse to fugal work, having _no precedent_ in _harmonic music_ to\r\nfall back upon. Thus, in his seven sonatas published in 1696, entitled\r\n“Fresh Fruits for the Clavier,” which show more individuality in\r\nmelodic invention, Kuhnau uses the fugal style whenever the harmonic\r\nforms fail him. These sonatas show a prevalence of ornaments, which,\r\nhe says, are “sugar to sweeten the fruits.” A remarkable collection of\r\nclavier pieces are his six Bible sonatas, in which the form is entirely\r\noutside of the development traced above, since the various movements of\r\neach sonata simply follow the lines of a Bible story, like that of the\r\n“Combat between David and Goliath,” which they illustrate. As samples\r\nof program music, they proceed in the steps of Pachelbel, and others on\r\nrecord. Kuhnau studied law, and was from 1682 organist at St. Thomas’\r\nChurch, at Leipzig, where he preceded J. S. Bach.\r\n\r\n=Frederick the Great’s Influence=.—A great impetus was given to German\r\nclavier music by the interest with which, like all other forms of\r\ninstrumental music, it was viewed by Frederick the Great of Prussia\r\n(r. 1740-86). This warlike but thoroughly Teutonic monarch gathered\r\nat his court a brilliant coterie of instrumentalists, delighting to\r\nperform with them on his favorite instrument, the flute. Although this\r\nmusical inspiration was disturbed by the wars in which he engaged, and\r\nespecially by the Seven Years’ War (1756-63), the growth of clavier\r\nmusic was nevertheless steady.\r\n\r\n=Musical Journals=.—A number of musical journals which appeared from\r\n1760 on, contributed also to this enthusiasm, in giving clavier\r\ncomposers a medium for bringing their works before the public, and also\r\nin giving them the chance to profit by one another’s experiments. Many\r\nwriters thus came to the fore, who aided materially in the elaboration\r\nof harmonic music material.\r\n\r\n=Other Early Composers=.—Of these, =Gottfried Heinrich Stoelzel=\r\n(1690-1749), chapel-master at Saxe-Gotha, wrote an “enharmonic” clavier\r\nsonata in three parts, a Largo in C minor, in 4/4 time; a short\r\nfugue; and a 3/8 movement, in harmonic form, in which experiments in\r\nmodulation were tried. His successor at Saxe-Gotha was =Georg Benda=\r\n(1721-95), who published a number of clavier pieces and sonatas,\r\nbesides two concertos for clavier and string quartet, all of which\r\nshow a desire for genuine expression in the harmonic form. The first\r\nfour-hand sonatas seem to have been published by =Charles Heinrich\r\nMüller=, of Halberstadt, in 1783, and another appeared in 1784, by\r\n=Ernst Wilhelm Wolf= (1735-92), court chapel-master in Saxe-Weimar,\r\nthe writer of numerous other clavier sonatas and concertos showing\r\ngreat purity and originality of style. At the court of Frederick the\r\nGreat, at Berlin, =Christoph Nichelmann= (1717-62), a pupil of Bach,\r\nand =Carl Fasch= (1736-1800) were successively second harpsichordists.\r\nBoth wrote sonatas, those of the former in two movements, while those\r\nof the latter had generally three, of a brilliant and attractive\r\nstyle. =Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg= (1718-95), the distinguished Berlin\r\ntheoretician, was more successful in contrapuntal work than in his\r\nsonatas, written in freer style.\r\n\r\n=Georg Christoph Wagenseil= (1715-77), pupil of J. J. Fux, court music\r\nteacher and celebrated clavier virtuoso, wrote sonatas for clavier and\r\nviolin and a number for clavier alone.\r\n\r\n=Wilhelm Friedemann Bach=.—Perhaps the most striking developments,\r\nhowever, were at the hands of the sons of J. S. Bach, who were all,\r\nhaving come under his direct instruction, of refined musical judgment,\r\nwhile some of them possessed marks of his genius. Of these, =Wilhelm\r\nFriedemann Bach= (1710-84), the eldest, called the Bach of Halle,\r\nfrom his long residence there, studied at the University of Leipzig,\r\ndistinguishing himself in mathematics; was organist at Dresden and\r\nHalle successively, and finally came to Frederick the Great’s court,\r\nat Berlin, through the influence of his brother Carl. Although he\r\npossessed great gifts as a player and composer, his dissipated habits\r\nbrought him to disgrace, and he died in poverty. He wrote many clavier\r\ncompositions, showing a bold use of harmonies, and including sonatas\r\nwhich have decidedly instrumental themes and development. A large\r\nnumber of his father’s manuscripts known to have been in his possession\r\nhave been irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\n=Johann Christian Bach=, the London Bach, youngest of J. S. Bach’s\r\nsons, was born at Leipzig in 1735, and died at London in 1782. He\r\nstudied with his brother, Carl, after his father’s death, and,\r\nafterwards going to Italy, became organist at the Milan Cathedral.\r\nGaining great favor in this capacity, he was appointed concert-director\r\nat London in 1759, and there he became a popular favorite, producing\r\nseveral operas and receiving the appointment of music master to the\r\nroyal family. His Italian experiences influenced his sonata writing,\r\nas his _subjects_ are in the style of the popular, though somewhat\r\ntrivial _Italian melody_. Yet he introduced some striking improvements,\r\nnotably that of employing a _second contrasting subject_, instead of a\r\nmere modulating or closing passage, at the end of the first and third\r\nsections of the sonata form. His graceful and melodious works were\r\nfashionable in London society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. P. E. BACH.]\r\n\r\n=C. P. E. Bach=.—The third and greatest of Bach’s sons was =Carl\r\nPhilip Emanuel Bach=, the Berlin Bach. Inheriting his father’s love of\r\ngenuine and forceful expression, he had no less lofty ideals of his\r\nart, though recognizing his inferiority in talent. Also, perceiving\r\nthat the harmonic school was in the line of progression, he devoted\r\nhimself to it, thus producing purely _harmonic works_, which were only\r\nlimited by the lack of resources thus far discovered. He was born\r\nat Weimar, in 1714, and, though a student of law and philosophy at\r\nLeipzig, he finally decided to give rein to his natural bent toward\r\nthe musical profession. Conducting and composing for a musical society\r\nat Frankfort, he was appointed first clavier player at the court of\r\nFrederick the Great, at Berlin, where he stayed from 1740 to 1767, in\r\nhigh favor on account of his sterling musicianship, and enjoying the\r\nsociety of many distinguished musicians of the day. In 1767, he became\r\nmusical director of the principal church in Hamburg, where he remained\r\ntill his death, in 1788. A vigorous worker throughout his life, he left\r\na large number of compositions, including two hundred and ten clavier\r\npieces and fifty-two concertos for clavier and orchestra, besides much\r\nchamber music, eighteen symphonies, oratorios and cantatas.\r\n\r\n=C. P. E. Bach’s Sonatas=.—His most enduring and important work was in\r\nconnection with the pianoforte sonata, since under his hands it began\r\nto assume _definite shape_. In the six sets of sonatas published,\r\nthe number of movements is generally fixed at three, of which the\r\nthird is frequently in the harmonic form of the Rondo, which consists\r\nin the recurrence of a principal theme, with modulatory episodes\r\nbetween its appearances. Hence the order of movements, which, in the\r\nearlier writers, took all sorts of forms from fugue to dance form,\r\nbecomes Allegro, Adagio, Rondo. Bach’s _themes_ are also made very\r\ncharacteristic, founded upon some easily-recognized _instrumental\r\nfigure_. In the _development_ portion of the sonata form he does not\r\nresort to the polyphonic style, but _uses phrases or sections from\r\nthe first part in new combinations and keys_. Sometimes, also, the\r\ndirection is given in the repeat of the first section, to introduce\r\nvariations of the text at will.\r\n\r\n=His Theoretical Works=.—Bach published at Berlin, in 1753, an essay on\r\n“The True Method of Playing the Clavier,” in which he gives a definite\r\nexposition of his father’s reforms in playing, treating the position of\r\nthe hand, embellishments and artistic rendering, which he says should\r\ntouch the hearts of the hearers. A second part, published in 1762,\r\ndiscusses the science of accompaniment and improvisation.\r\n\r\n=Adoption of the Piano=.—The clavichord, notwithstanding its feeble\r\ntone, remained his favorite instrument on account of its powers of\r\nexpression, in which he delighted. His brother, Johann Christian, was\r\none of the first definitely to adopt the new pianoforte. J. G. Müthel\r\npublished in 1771 what were probably the first compositions mentioning\r\nthe pianoforte for their performance, a duet for two pianofortes or\r\nharpsichords; after the time of C. P. E. Bach, clavier compositions\r\nwere written in general distinctively for the pianoforte and not for\r\nthe clavier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Pianoforte Playing.\r\n\r\nShedlock.—The Pianoforte Sonata.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article “Sonata.”\r\n\r\nParry’s “Evolution of the Art of Music,” Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nHenderson.—How Music Developed, Chapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUSICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann, pages 338, 340, 342-355.\r\n\r\nRimbault.—“The Pianoforte,” pages 357-368.\r\n\r\nEdition Litollf, Augener, Breitkopf, as for Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nWorks of C.

P. E. Bach write?\r\n\r\nA comparison of the dates from Kuhnau’s published work in Sonatas to\r\nthat of C. P. E. Bach, the immediate predecessor and model for Haydn,\r\nshows that the form took definite shape in the course of about fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ JOSEPH HAYDN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XXX.\r\n\r\n                          FRANZ JOSEPH HAYDN.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Three Great Sonata Writers=.—In the year of C. P. E. Bach’s death,\r\n1788, three men had already entered the arena as champions of that\r\nSonata Form to which he contributed so much. Haydn was then fifty-six,\r\nMozart thirty-two and Beethoven eighteen years of age. All three added\r\nto the glory of Vienna by making it their dwelling-place in their later\r\nyears; and the three formed a triumvirate which not only gave to the\r\nSonata a permanent and complete form, but also brought this form into\r\nabsolute subservience to the expression of every variety of emotional\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n=Haydn’s Childhood=.—Franz Joseph Haydn, a native of Rohrau, in lower\r\nAustria, was born on March 31, 1732, the second of a family of twelve\r\nchildren. His father, an humble wheelwright, was accustomed to bring\r\nhis family together in the evenings and holidays, as was the German\r\ncustom, to unite in song; and the true ear and feeling for rhythm of\r\nlittle “Sepperl,” as Joseph was called, was quickly noticeable. So a\r\ncousin of his father, who was a schoolmaster at Hainburg, was allowed\r\nto take the boy home with him, placing him in the school choir, and\r\ndirecting his studies, which included singing, and the playing of the\r\nviolin and other instruments.\r\n\r\n=St. Stephen’s Choir, Vienna=.—George Reutter, precentor of St.\r\nStephen’s Cathedral, at Vienna, paid a visit to the school and was\r\nattracted by the child’s “sweet, weak voice,” as he expressed it, and\r\noffered him a position in his choir. As this was considered a rare\r\nopportunity, he was allowed to go, and at the age of eight we find him\r\ninstalled in the choir school at Vienna, attending the daily service\r\nand choir practice, besides the regular school studies. But Reutter\r\nseems to have lost his personal interest in the lad, neglecting him\r\nin various ways, doing nothing with his work in musical theory, and\r\nfinally dropping all his tuition. Haydn was fond of mischief; and when\r\nhis voice began to break and his brother Michael became soloist in his\r\nplace, his cruel master took the pretext of some trifling prank to turn\r\nhim adrift, penniless, into the street.\r\n\r\n=Hardships in Vienna=.—At the age of seventeen, therefore, he wandered\r\nthe streets all of one rainy November night, with no friend to whom\r\nto turn. Finally, in the morning, he met an acquaintance formerly at\r\nthe school, Spangler, a tenor singer, himself nearly as poor as Haydn.\r\nNevertheless, he took the outcast home to his garret, where he was\r\neking out an existence with his family; and thus temporarily provided\r\nfor, Haydn set about finding work to do. Small jobs, like playing in\r\nbands, or at weddings and baptisms, and singing in choirs, he eagerly\r\nsought; his spare moments he occupied in writing music for serenades\r\nor garden-parties. While undergoing these hardships, however, he was\r\nbecoming familiar with the music dear to the people’s heart, and also\r\nwith the varied effects of instrumental combinations.\r\n\r\n=Studies and New Friends=.—In 1750, he rented a garret in a house\r\nin Vienna, and, having secured a dilapidated spinet, set himself\r\ndiligently to work to study all available musical compositions, notably\r\nthose of the new sonata order, and especially the sonatas of C. P.\r\nE. Bach. Theoretical works, also, like the “Gradus ad Parnassum” of\r\nJ. J. Fux, and Mattheson’s work on conducting, were eagerly devoured\r\nby the youthful enthusiast. By a piece of good fortune, Metastasio,\r\nthe popular opera librettist, roomed in the same house, and learning\r\nof the talent hidden away in the garret, sought Haydn out, gave him\r\nItalian lessons, and ultimately started him on the road to success\r\nby recommending him as clavier teacher to a Spanish lady, to whose\r\ndaughter he gave lessons.\r\n\r\n=Connection with Porpora=.—Her singing master was the renowned opera\r\ncomposer, Porpora, who recognized Haydn’s talent as accompanist, and\r\nproceeded to make him useful to himself, giving him instruction in\r\ncomposition in return for his services, which were frequently of even a\r\nmenial nature. Accompanying Porpora on his journeys, he met musicians\r\nlike Wagenseil and Gluck; and at the age of twenty had written many\r\ncompositions, including a mass in F, an opera and many works of the\r\nsonata order, founded on the style of C. P. E. Bach.\r\n\r\n=Better Times=.—Better times now opened before Haydn. Gaining\r\ninfluential friends, he won, through them, the post of music director\r\nand composer to Count Morzin, a position which he held only a short\r\ntime, since the Count gave up his musical establishment soon. But he\r\nwas immediately engaged by the wealthy and cultivated Prince Paul\r\nEsterhazy, who had been charmed at hearing a symphony of Haydn’s, as\r\nassistant director of music at his estate at Eisenstadt. The same year\r\nHaydn made an unhappy marriage with the daughter of Keller, a wigmaker,\r\nwhich he had cause to regret for the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\n=Orchestras in Germany=.—To understand Haydn’s work with the Esterhazy\r\nfamily, it will be necessary to review the state of music in Germany\r\nat this time. When the orchestral overtures of the Italian operas had\r\nbecome used as concert pieces, a great stimulus was given to this kind\r\nof music. Concertos, string quartets, trios, and, most important of\r\nall, symphonies, came to be written in great numbers; and throughout\r\nGermany a mania for orchestral music arose. Wealthy families vied with\r\neach other in the size and prestige of their musical establishments,\r\nwhich included instrumentalists and vocalists; and the smaller gentry\r\neven pressed their domestic servants into the service, inducing them\r\nto study instruments, and to perform string quartets and the like on\r\noccasions. Inasmuch as a great part of the music written for these was\r\nnot published, and exchange of music in manuscript between different\r\nestablishments was attended with some difficulty, it was necessary that\r\nthe music director should have the ability to write his own music, as\r\nwell as to direct it.\r\n\r\n=Haydn’s Work at Esterhazy=.—A rare opportunity therefore opened to\r\nHaydn, with his exceptional gifts as a composer, when he was placed\r\nat the head of an establishment like that of the Esterhazys’, which\r\nwas perhaps the most brilliant and competent in Europe. He remained\r\nin active service with this family for thirty-three years, during\r\nwhich Prince Nicolas Esterhazy succeeded his brother Paul, upon the\r\ndeath of the latter, in 1762. Nicolas, called the “Great,” on account\r\nof his love of magnificence and his lavish style of living, built a\r\nsumptuous summer palace near Süttor, in Bohemia; and here he spent most\r\nof his time, with his troup of retainers, entertaining royalty, in a\r\nstyle comparable with that of Versailles. Werner, his head director,\r\nwho had never appreciated Haydn’s gifts on account of his old-school\r\nprinciples, died in 1766, and Haydn, who had made a firm friend of\r\nPrince Nicolas, was given his place. The orchestra and singers were\r\nnow entirely under his command; the former was increased from the\r\noriginal number of sixteen to thirty, all capable performers; so that\r\nhis life was spent in a round of rehearsals, dramatic performances and\r\nconcerts for the numerous entertainments constantly in progress. Two\r\nwell-equipped theatres, one for operas and dramas, and the other for\r\nmarionette plays, gave him an opportunity for adequate performances;\r\nhe thus had an exceptional chance to study the effects in his numerous\r\nquartets, trios, symphonies and operas, at first hand.\r\n\r\n=Journeys to Vienna=.—On several occasions, Prince Nicolas took his\r\nentire troupe of musicians to Vienna, where Haydn conducted the\r\nperformances, meeting also the distinguished musicians of the day. It\r\nwas on one of these journeys, in 1785, that he met Mozart, whose genius\r\nhe was quick to appreciate, and who, from being his pupil, finally gave\r\nto Haydn the added inspiration of his own brilliant thoughts. Haydn’s\r\nreputation had now spread abroad, and his compositions were eagerly\r\nlooked for throughout the musical world.\r\n\r\n=Haydn in London=.—On Prince Nicolas’ death, in 1790, Prince Anton, his\r\nbrother, succeeded, who, however, dismissed the orchestra, providing\r\nfor Haydn by a liberal pension. Haydn’s time was now his own; and he\r\ndecided to settle in Vienna; but an English impresario and publisher\r\nnamed Salomon now offered him such exceptional inducements to come to\r\nLondon that he accepted the offer. He was received with great honor,\r\nbeing granted the degree of Doctor of Music from Oxford University.\r\nHe also conducted twelve grand symphonies, especially written for\r\nthis visit, which were, moreover, some of his finest productions. On\r\na second visit, in 1794-5, he excited even greater enthusiasm; and he\r\nreturned to Vienna supplied with money sufficient to insure an old age\r\nfree from pecuniary want. Some of his latest works were the Austrian\r\nNational Hymn, and his oratorios of “The Creation” and “The Seasons,”\r\nwhich immediately attained a popularity that has even yet hardly\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\n=Honors=.—Haydn, in his old age, was showered with honors both at home\r\nand abroad; a culminating point was reached when, on his seventy-sixth\r\nbirthday, at a performance of “The Creation,” his friends, including\r\nmany representatives of royalty, united to do him honor. His genial,\r\nchild-like disposition won him the sobriquet of “Papa Haydn”; and\r\nthis brightness and simplicity of thought he so transmitted to his\r\ncompositions that they carry his atmosphere of sunshine wherever they\r\nare performed. He died in Vienna, soon after its capture by the French,\r\nin the Napoleonic wars, May 31, 1809.\r\n\r\n=Importance of His Work=.—Haydn has been called the father of the\r\nSymphony and the String Quartet. In neither case is this strictly\r\ntrue, since he had predecessors in both fields; but his work was\r\nnone the less important, since he collected the scattered threads of\r\ntheir attempts, and wound them into a concise and definite art form,\r\nstamped with the hallmarks of his own genius. The seal of artistic\r\ncompleteness which he placed on the form of the Sonata was his greatest\r\nachievement; and, written in this form, his symphonies and quartets\r\nwere simply an enlargement of his clavier works, the symphonies having\r\nan added Minuet movement between the second and last movements of the\r\nclavier form of sonata, thus extending the piece to larger proportions.\r\n\r\n=Sonata-Form as Fixed by Haydn=.—In these clavier sonatas, Haydn fixed\r\nthe form which had been the subject of so many experiments, once and\r\nfor all. The number of movements with him is almost invariably three,\r\nof which the first, at least, is in the sonata-form. This consists\r\nof a first section, the =Exposition=, in which the first subject, a\r\ndistinct melody having the Teutonic individuality, is stated, defining\r\nthe principal key; and a second subject, more lengthy and diverse in\r\ncharacter, brings on a close in the contrasting key. In the second\r\nsection, or =Development=, phrases or motives from the first section\r\nare cleverly intertwined in modulating keys, with running scales or\r\narpeggios as connecting links. These, however, lead naturally into the\r\nfirst subject, in its original key, which opens the third section, or\r\n=Reprise=. This section is practically like the first, save that the\r\nsecond subject and the close are transferred into the principal key, in\r\nwhich the movement ends.\r\n\r\n=The Second Movement=.—The second, or slow movement, is cast sometimes\r\nin the same form, abbreviated, and sometimes in a simpler form. The\r\nlack of sustaining power in Haydn’s pianoforte, and his attempt to\r\natone for this by trills and ornaments, make this less successful\r\nthan the other movements; a result which is also caused by the fact\r\nthat intensity and depth of emotion had not yet been developed in the\r\nharmonic school of music. In key, this movement was contrasted with the\r\nfirst, sometimes quite sharply, as in one of the sonatas in E-flat, in\r\nwhich the slow movement is in E major.\r\n\r\n=Third Movement=.—The lively third movement is frequently in the\r\nlighter form of the Rondo, or it may be a set of Variations, or a\r\nMinuet. This movement, though sprightly, is apt to be somewhat thin in\r\nits harmonies, and trivial in development. Nevertheless, these last two\r\nmovements show an expansion of the forms of the older writers, and a\r\ndefiniteness of character which insured their future development.\r\n\r\n=Definiteness and Unity=.—This element of absolute definiteness is the\r\nmost striking feature of Haydn’s work—definiteness none the less in\r\nthe general form than in each individual component. Each part of each\r\nsection ends with a cadence, giving it absolute finality, and making\r\nthe whole a combination of small entities, which, though distinct, are\r\nyet relevant and nicely balanced.\r\n\r\n=Humor and Freshness=.—Another quality which he introduced was\r\nthat of humor, which is prominent not only in the general tone of\r\ngeniality, but in little unexpected twists of harmony, melody or\r\nrhythm, which give an irresistibly comic effect. Especially is this\r\ntrue in his symphonies, where the various tone colors are used for such\r\nresults. Especial mention should also be made of his Masses, in which\r\ntunefulness of melody and sprightly rhythms combine to give an enduring\r\npopularity. Altogether, Haydn’s work is redolent of the spring of\r\nmusical activity, where the novelty of each harmonic effect is employed\r\nwith an outburst of joy, and where one travels, as it were, through a\r\nsunny garden, filled with the flowers of musical thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nShedlock.—The Pianoforte Sonata.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. II, chapter on Haydn.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Pianoforte Playing.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article “Haydn.”\r\n\r\nVarious lives of Haydn.\r\n\r\nHaydn appears as one of the characters in George Sand’s musical novel\r\n“Consuelo.”\r\n\r\nFor musical illustrations, see especially Haydn’s pianoforte sonatas,\r\nin Edition Peters, No. 713, a, b, c and d, or in other cheap editions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho are the three great sonata writers?\r\n\r\nTell about Haydn’s childhood.\r\n\r\nTell about Haydn’s life in Vienna.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Haydn as a student.\r\n\r\nWhat great singing master did he meet?\r\n\r\nWhat patrons did Haydn gain?

The knowledge which others spent years in\r\nacquiring seemed his by birthright; and thus, although the years of his\r\nlife were few, the period of his artistic activity was proportionately\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n=Mozart’s Early Musical Training=.—Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born at\r\nSalzburg, January 27, 1756. His father, himself of some reputation as\r\na composer and as the author of the first German violin method, was\r\nquick to perceive the child’s sensitiveness toward music; and began\r\ninstruction in clavier playing when Wolfgang was but four years old,\r\nteaching also his daughter, Maria Anna, five years older. Wolfgang was\r\nan exceedingly delicate and receptive child; and at the age of six he\r\nhad not only acquired remarkable proficiency on the instrument, but had\r\ncomposed a number of little pieces, and a clavier sonata.\r\n\r\n=First Concert Tours=.—Realizing the remarkable talent of his children,\r\nMozart, the father, in 1762, ventured on a concert trip with them to\r\nMunich, and later to Vienna, where their playing became the sensation\r\nof the hour, and where they were received by the Emperor, Franz Josef\r\nI, at his palace. Having been presented with a small violin, Mozart\r\nacquired facility in its technic with extraordinary quickness, as also\r\nwas the case when he attempted the use of organ pedals. The brilliant\r\nFrench court was then the Mecca of artists; and in 1763, the children\r\nwere taken to Paris, where their successes were redoubled, and where\r\nthey gave two brilliant concerts, after having played before the\r\nroyal family at Versailles. At Paris, moreover, the opus 1 and opus 2\r\nof the little Mozart were published, each comprising two sonatas for\r\nharpsichord, with accompaniment of violin or flute.\r\n\r\n=England=.—Proceeding now to England, the children won fresh laurels,\r\nremaining there fifteen months; during which time Wolfgang excited the\r\nadmiration of the king, George III, by his sight-reading of works by\r\nHandel, Bach and others. He also wrote other sonatas, and his first\r\nsymphonies. Returning to Salzburg, after a three years’ absence, Mozart\r\napplied himself to serious study, composing his first oratorio and\r\nopera, which latter was not performed in public, and also appearing as\r\nconductor at a concert in which his “Solemn Mass” was performed.\r\n\r\n=Honors in Italy=.—Renewed triumphs awaited him in Italy, where\r\nhis father took him in 1769, and where his genius was immediately\r\nrecognized in the leading cities. At Rome he was honored by the Order\r\nof the Golden Spur, conferred by the Pope; and in Bologna was admitted\r\nto membership in the exclusive Philharmonic Academy, passing with ease\r\nan examination which would have appalled many mature musicians; in\r\nMilan his opera “Mitridate” was received enthusiastically, and given\r\ntwenty consecutive performances, under his own direction.\r\n\r\n=Journey to Paris=.—Returning to Salzburg, Mozart took up the post\r\npreviously given him of music director to the Archbishop; but his\r\nemolument, at first wholly wanting, was insignificant, and the\r\nArchbishop, having little appreciation of his abilities, proved a\r\nthankless taskmaster. During this time he made several journeys\r\nto Milan, producing new dramatic works there; and in 1777, as his\r\nSalzburg position had become intolerable, he resolved to give it up,\r\nand to repair to Paris. Starting on this journey with his mother, he\r\nstopped at Munich, and then at Augsburg, where he became interested\r\nin the Stein pianofortes, henceforth adopting them for his concert\r\nwork. At Mannheim he heard the famous orchestra, of which Stamitz\r\nwas the founder, whose command of instrumental brilliancy and color\r\nmade so powerful an impression upon him that he transmitted it to his\r\nsucceeding orchestral compositions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART.]\r\n\r\n=“Idomeneo” and “Il Seraglio.”=—At Paris, he found society divided\r\ninto two warring operatic factions, led by Gluck and Piccini, and\r\naverse to anything else in music. Saddened also by the death of his\r\nmother, he returned to Salzburg, and resumed his former post with the\r\nArchbishop. Receiving an order to write an opera for the Carnival at\r\nMunich, he produced his “Idomeneo” there in 1781. Shortly after, he was\r\ncompelled, through ill-treatment, to break finally with the Archbishop,\r\nand he resolved to settle in Vienna. In the same year, 1782, in which\r\nhe produced there his opera, “Entführung aus dem Serail,” composed by\r\ncommand of the Emperor, he married Constance Weber.\r\n\r\n=Financial Troubles=.—His life from this time was a constant struggle\r\nagainst poverty; for notwithstanding his wonderful genius, he received\r\nonly scant recognition from his patron, the Emperor, although loyal\r\nto him to the end. His existence was eked out chiefly by the sale of\r\nhis compositions, which publishers purchased at a low price, by giving\r\nlessons and by playing at concerts; while the jealousy of rivals\r\nfurnished a constant source of annoyance.\r\n\r\n=“Figaro,” “Don Giovanni” and Symphonies=.—His comic opera, “The\r\nMarriage of Figaro,” produced in Vienna in 1786, came near failing\r\nthrough these enemies, but was an unqualified success in Prague, where,\r\nin the following year, his masterpiece, “Don Giovanni,” was produced.\r\nOn a concert tour in 1786 he was offered an excellent post in the\r\nservice of King Frederic Wilhelm II, of Prussia, which he refused,\r\nthrough loyalty to his Emperor—a devotion which received no reward save\r\nan order to write another opera. In the same year, 1789, his three most\r\nimportant symphonies were completed—the “Jupiter,” in C, and those in G\r\nminor and E-flat major.\r\n\r\n=Other Operas=—=Death=.—His succeeding operas were “Così fan Tutte,”\r\nperformed at Vienna in 1790; “The Clemency of Titus,” given at Prague\r\nin 1791, for the coronation festivities of King Leopold II of Bohemia,\r\nand “The Magic Flute,” produced at Vienna in 1791, which, through its\r\nGerman subject and style, was a signal success, especially in his own\r\ncountry. Discouragements and hard work now told upon him; and in the\r\nmidst of his labors upon a grand Requiem, he was stricken down, and\r\ndied December 5, 1791.\r\n\r\n=Relations with Haydn=.—No one admired Mozart’s genius more than Haydn;\r\nand a proof of the latter’s freedom from the petty jealousies of lesser\r\nmen is found in the fact that, while he was at first Mozart’s teacher,\r\nhe was afterward glad to adopt many of the innovations which were\r\nthe result of Mozart’s genius. The labors of the two men admirably\r\nsupplemented each other; for Mozart assimilated and blended what Haydn\r\nhad definitely stated, adorning the rugged outlines with the graceful\r\ndraperies which his skill as a performer and his artistic nature\r\ndictated.\r\n\r\n=Italian Influences=.—Thus, while Mozart adopted the form of the\r\nSonata practically as enunciated by Haydn, he was able to impart new\r\nelements to it, drawn from his own experience and individuality. His\r\nItalian journeys, for instance, had brought him into close touch with\r\nthe highly-adorned Italian opera style, then everywhere popular; and\r\nthis he introduced into his instrumental _themes_, making them at once\r\n_singing_ and _graceful_ in tone. In the Sonata Form, he made the\r\n_second theme_ more definite, _contrasting_ it with the _first_, and\r\nfrequently casting it in the form of an Italian style of melody, in\r\ndistinction from a more terse and thematic principal subject.\r\n\r\n=Mozart as Piano Virtuoso=.—As a virtuoso, Mozart immensely developed\r\nthe resources of the piano. After the Bachs, J. S. and his son C.\r\nP. E., had established a rational scale fingering, and it was found\r\npossible to introduce passages at once quickly running and smooth\r\nupon the clavier, such scale passages became very frequent in the\r\ncompositions of the time, and they were, moreover, well adapted to the\r\nlight Viennese action found in the Stein pianos, which Mozart used.\r\nHence we find _scale-runs_ as the _cornerstone of his virtuosity_,\r\nconstantly employed in florid and transitional passages.\r\n\r\n=Classic Finish=.—But Mozart’s compositions were not simply an advance\r\nin brilliancy, since his slow movements and themes are full of much\r\ngenuine sentiment, and give opportunity for that expressive song-style\r\nwhich he emphasized so strongly. Moreover, his feeling for artistic\r\nfinish caused him, by rounding off every detail, to avoid abruptness,\r\nreplacing them by little delicate turns of musical expression and\r\ngraceful embellishments, which give an atmosphere of _classic repose_\r\nand finish to the whole.\r\n\r\n=Variations=.—Embellishments of this kind are introduced invariably\r\nwith such naturalness and fitness as to make them seem perfectly\r\nadapted to the subject in hand, and growing unconsciously out of it.\r\nSo Mozart throws a network of _embroidery about his themes_ at their\r\nrecurrence which shows their beauties to ever greater advantage. The\r\nability to do this makes him a specially felicitous composer in the\r\nVariation form, in which some of his most attractive movements and\r\nsalon pieces are written.\r\n\r\n=Piano with Other Instruments=.—His sense of fitness is shown also in\r\nthe vivid _contrasts_ which occur, especially in his Fantasias, in\r\nwhich brilliant passages are relieved by bits of exquisite melody,\r\nin artistic proportion. All these qualities are manifested in his\r\npianoforte concertos, which, while replete with flights of virtuosity,\r\nyet always subordinate, cause him to bring this into equal prominence\r\nwith the piano, so that the one ably seconds the other in the attempt\r\nto produce a well-rounded and thoroughly genuine musical effect. The\r\nsame qualities are exhibited in his sonatas for violin and piano, and\r\nin his piano trios.\r\n\r\n=Especial Characteristics=.—Mozart considered three elements necessary\r\nfor the true interpretation of piano music, namely, an _expressive\r\nlegato touch_, _moderation_ in the rate of _speed_ of performance, and\r\n_strictness_ in adhering to the _time_ adopted. With an unfeeling touch\r\nor a breakneck velocity he had no patience, and so had no sympathy with\r\nmany noted pianists of his day, and notably Clementi. It has been said\r\nthat Mozart, almost from his infancy, thought in music as others do in\r\nwords; and this thought in music was regulated by a sense of artistic\r\ncombination and proportion which permeated all his works. As samples of\r\nvirtuosity his piano works have long been surpassed by the astonishing\r\ndevelopments since his time, and particularly by the added resources\r\nof the instrument itself; but as samples of pure and unaffected music\r\ntheir worth can never be diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nShedlock.—The Pianoforte Sonata.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. II, Chapter XXX.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Pianoforte Playing.\r\n\r\nJahn.—Life of Mozart.\r\n\r\nArticles in Grove’s Dictionary on subjects treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUSICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nWorks of Mozart, especially the Sonatas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Mozart’s childhood.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Mozart’s first concert tour.\r\n\r\nTell about the first trip to Italy.\r\n\r\nWhat drawbacks did he suffer from his connection with the Archbishop of\r\nSalzburg?\r\n\r\nWhere did he come into contact with the piano?

Rousseau (d. 1778), that “music is the art\r\nof combining sounds in a manner agreeable to the ear,” gave a fitting\r\ncharacterization; for while a tinge of melancholy is occasionally\r\nperceptible, and there are passages of some dramatic intensity,\r\nnevertheless such elements are introduced mainly to give a pleasing\r\ncontrast from the even flow of polished and idealized sound.\r\n\r\n=Their Gift to Beethoven=.—In other words, neither Haydn nor Mozart\r\never sacrifices his sense of artistic finish to the expression of\r\nthe heights and depths of human emotion. Putting the seal of genius\r\nupon instrumental forms, they transmitted these forms to another more\r\ncolossal mind, which should make use of them, to be sure, but should\r\nabsolutely subordinate them to the expression of the burning thoughts\r\nand passions of a great individuality; a mind which, like that of\r\nShakespeare, was able to look fearlessly upon universal truths, and to\r\nbring these to the light, in this instance through the medium of tone.\r\nWhile their predecessors, by unwearying attempts, made possible this\r\ndetermination of a capable art form, so Haydn and Mozart, in their\r\nturn, paved the way for the fuller expression which Beethoven gave to\r\nmusic, and which would otherwise not have been possible, since the\r\nvehicle for his thoughts would have been wanting. Thus the opportunity\r\nhad arrived for broadening the definition which Rousseau gave, and\r\nannouncing the fact that music is the art of the expression of every\r\nemotion, whether pleasurable or painful, through the medium of highly\r\norganized sound.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven’s Early Life=.—Ludwig van Beethoven, the last and\r\ngreatest of this triumvirate of sonata writers, was a native of\r\nBonn-on-the-Rhine, where he was born December 16, 1770. His parents\r\nwere lowly people, his father a tenor singer in the Elector of\r\nCologne’s chapel, and his mother a cook; and, moreover, Beethoven’s\r\nearly life was an unhappy one, through his father’s irascible\r\ndisposition and tendency toward dissipation. Beethoven, of an acutely\r\nsensitive nature, inherited his father’s quick temper and annoyances\r\nat trifles, so that all through his troubled life he was constantly in\r\na state of irritation against something or someone. Like Mozart, he\r\nshowed early and unmistakable signs of a musical susceptibility; unlike\r\nhim, however, the unfolding of his genius was ultimately slow, since he\r\nattained to his greatest powers much later in life than his phenomenal\r\npredecessor. His early instruction was begun with his father; but soon\r\nhe was placed in the care of several local musicians: Pfeiffer, music\r\ndirector and oboist; Van der Eeden, the court organist; and especially\r\nthe successor to the latter, Neefe (1748-1798), a man of reputation as\r\norganist and composer for the pianoforte. As a result, Beethoven played\r\nthe violin well at eight, and at twelve had mastered the works of\r\nHandel and the “Well-Tempered Clavichord” of J. S. Bach. This intimate\r\nstudy of the best works of the old polyphonic school was of great\r\nadvantage later in solidifying his gifts as a musician.\r\n\r\n=First Compositions=.—In 1782, were published his first attempts at\r\ncomposition—a set of variations, and three sonatas; and these, together\r\nwith his remarkable extempore playing, began to attract the attention\r\nof persons of influence. He was appointed organist at Bonn, and at\r\nsixteen was sent by the Elector Max Franz, brother of the Emperor\r\nJoseph II, to Vienna, where he received praise from Mozart, who\r\npredicted a brilliant future for him.\r\n\r\n=The Breuning Family=.—In 1787, his mother died; and this loss,\r\ntogether with his father’s intemperate habits, made his home extremely\r\nunpleasant. Fortunately for Beethoven, however, the enthusiasm for\r\nmusic which was rife in Germany at this time among people of culture\r\nand position was the cause of attracting to his side many true\r\nfriends, who, appreciating his sterling qualities, were able to pardon\r\nhis rough exterior and manners. Thus he was received as teacher and\r\nfriend into the home of the cultivated von Breuning family, under\r\nwhose refining influence he came into touch with the masterpieces of\r\nEnglish and German literature. Here he first met his staunch friend,\r\nCount Waldstein; and here he had leisure for long walks amid the rural\r\nretreats which he heartily loved, and for meditation upon those musical\r\nideas which he was accustomed to jot down in rough sketches, and which\r\nshould later be translated into his immortal creations.\r\n\r\n=In Vienna=.—Haydn, passing through Bonn, warmly praised a cantata of\r\nBeethoven’s; and the Elector, moved by such marks of approbation, sent\r\nhim again to Vienna, in 1792, for serious study. Here he was instructed\r\nby Haydn till the latter’s departure for England, in 1794, when he\r\nwent to Albrechtsberger, the celebrated contrapuntist, and others; but\r\nthese exponents of an earlier school looked somewhat askance at the\r\nbold innovations which Beethoven introduced into recognized principles,\r\nand failed to understand the irrepressible genius which prompted them.\r\nNothing daunted, he launched zealously into composition, supported\r\nby a growing circle of admirers to which the Elector’s patronage had\r\nintroduced him; and soon became a favorite at the private soirées of\r\nthe nobility, where, on account of his eccentric manners, he was known\r\nas an “original,” but where his wonderful extemporizing was received\r\nwith ecstasy.\r\n\r\n=Successes as a Pianist=.—Beethoven’s first public performance in\r\nVienna occurred in 1795, when he performed his pianoforte concerto in\r\nC major at a concert. During a journey soon after, he played before\r\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm II, at Berlin, who distinguished him with marks\r\nof favor, and to whom Beethoven dedicated two sonatas written for\r\npianoforte with ’cello. Here also he met the conductor, =Friedrich\r\nHimmel= (1765-1814), a pianist and composer of high rank. We hear next\r\nof his trial of pianistic skill with Steibelt, a popular virtuoso,\r\nin which Beethoven won an overwhelming victory. With Wölfl, another\r\ndistinguished rival, his relations were those of mutual esteem, and\r\nthe two masters delighted to extemporize dashing capriccios on two\r\npianofortes.\r\n\r\n=First Period=.—The thirteen years, from 1790 to 1803, are usually\r\nconsidered to embrace his first period of activity as a composer,\r\ncomprising his works to opus 50. His opus 1, three trios for piano,\r\nviolin and ’cello, appeared in 1795, and soon after three piano\r\nsonatas, opus 2, dedicated to Haydn, were published. Among the other\r\nnoteworthy works of this period were his first two symphonies, in C\r\nand D, three piano concertos, the piano sonatas including opus 27, the\r\nKreutzer sonata for piano and violin, and his famous Septet for strings\r\nand wind instruments. In general, these compositions _follow_ closely\r\nthe lines laid down by _Haydn_ and _Mozart_, although there is, notably\r\nin the piano sonatas, a gradual tendency toward freedom of expression,\r\nand the assertion of individuality.\r\n\r\nTroubles now began to gather about him. About 1800 his hearing became\r\ndefective, and the malady grew steadily from bad to worse, so that\r\nby 1816 he was obliged to use an ear-trumpet, and by 1822 he was\r\nstone-deaf. To add to his discomforts, his brothers Karl and Johann\r\ntreated him shamefully, and a son of the former, to whom he was left\r\nguardian at the father’s death, and upon whom he lavished a father’s\r\ncare, turned out a scapegrace, repaying his affection with the basest\r\ningratitude. Weighed down by these misfortunes, Beethoven became\r\nirritable and morbid, distrusting his most faithful friends, and\r\nconstantly imagining plots against himself. His utter ignorance of\r\nworldly matters, too, brought him into financial troubles, and involved\r\nhis domestic affairs in a state of continual confusion.\r\n\r\n=Second Period=.—Yet, as if to prove man’s ability to rise superior to\r\nevery affliction, during this very time he was writing compositions\r\nwhich, for joyous freshness and spiritual elevation, have been\r\nscarcely, if ever, equalled. During his second period, extending to\r\n1815, and including his compositions to about opus 90, he adopted a\r\n_freedom of expression_ entirely untrammelled by formal limitations,\r\nenlarging and vivifying the Sonata Form, and varying it to suit his\r\nchanging moods. The joy of living, with its intensity of passion\r\nand depths of emotion, is reflected in these works, which assert a\r\ncharacter strong in its struggle against adverse fate, confidently\r\nlooking toward the goal of ultimate good.\r\n\r\n=Compositions of this Period=.—His most popular symphonies were written\r\nduring this period, which embraces those from the third to the eighth,\r\ninclusive. The “Eroica,” number three, was originally written in\r\nhomage to Napoleon, whom Beethoven honored as the guide of the French\r\nnation toward that assertion of independence and individuality which\r\nhe dearly loved; but when the news arrived that Napoleon was declared\r\nDictator, in 1804, he tore up the dedicatory page in a fit of anger.\r\nAnother of his greatest compositions was his opera of “Fidelio,” upon\r\nwhich Beethoven spent an amazing amount of time and pains, whose\r\noverture he rewrote twice. Produced in Vienna, in 1805, soon after the\r\noccupation of the city by the French, it was received coldly; and only\r\nafter several revisions did it score a success at all in keeping with\r\nits grand and inspiring conception. Several orchestral overtures; his\r\nviolin concerto; an oratorio; a mass in C; some of his best chamber\r\nmusic, including the celebrated Rasumovsky string quartets; and his\r\npiano concertos in G and E-flat, were other fruits of about this time.\r\nOf fourteen piano sonatas, we find several which have continued in\r\nunbroken popularity, notably the two in opus 27, the “Pastorale,” opus\r\n28, the “Waldstein,” opus 53, and the “Appassionata.”\r\n\r\n=Latter Years of His Life=.—The latter part of Beethoven’s life, after\r\n1815, was spent in Vienna, in a state of despondency from his troubles\r\nwhich his general recognition as the foremost musician of his day could\r\nscarcely alleviate. His many friends placed him, by their efforts, in\r\ncomfortable pecuniary circumstances; yet he constantly imagined himself\r\nstruggling with poverty. Sensitive to his affliction, he made himself\r\nexceedingly inaccessible, and passed his days in unceasing labor upon\r\nthose works which eclipsed, in profundity and individuality, all of\r\nhis former compositions, and which were an index to the conflicting\r\nstruggles in his mind. Stone-deaf, he yet revelled in a spiritual world\r\nof tone, hearing his greatest compositions only in the realms of his\r\nimagination. An attack of pneumonia in 1826 left effects which proved\r\nlasting, and which caused his death on March 26, 1827. In his last\r\nillness he was surrounded by his circle of unfailing friends, among\r\nwhom the modest Schubert was admitted; and a proof of his hold upon his\r\ncountrymen is shown in the fact that 20,000 persons are said to have\r\nattended his funeral.\r\n\r\n=Last Great Works=.—The greatest fruit of these later years was his\r\nlast symphony, the Ninth, or “Choral,” in which, for the first time,\r\nhe introduced voices as an aid to the instrumental climax. The free\r\nvent which he gave to his radical tendencies in this symphony, its\r\nunheard-of boldness of harmonic progressions, and its defiance of all\r\nconventional rules, aroused a storm of protest from his critics which\r\nwas only lulled after succeeding generations had placed the stamp\r\nof unmistakable approval upon the work, and had recognized it as a\r\nmonument of genius. Near to this in importance stands his “Solemn Mass”\r\nin D, a work imbued with all the religious fervor of his declining\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n=Sonatas of Third Period=.—Other notable achievements, in the line\r\nof chamber music, mark this period; and the last five piano sonatas,\r\nextending from opus 101 to opus 111, exhibit the same undaunted\r\nfreedom that is found in the Ninth symphony. Enormous in their demands\r\nupon the pianist, they are food for none but virtuosi; but analyzed,\r\nthey show a _compendium of_ all known _musical resources_, from the\r\nchoral fugue to the most daring flights of harmonic expression.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven’s Dual Personality=.—Beethoven furnishes an example of a\r\npersonality whose dual nature is remarkably apparent. Often unkempt,\r\nand rude in his outward bearing, he seemed at times absolutely\r\noblivious to his surroundings and to chafe at his bodily limitations;\r\nyet his apparent rudeness toward his friends was as often humbly atoned\r\nfor by his confession of his haste in judging them. His independence\r\nof spirit could brook no submission to authority other than his own\r\nconscience; and that conscience prompted him to stand firm in support\r\nof the genuine, the pure and the ideal; firm, thus, in its abhorrence\r\nof artificiality and deceit. In his ignorance of worldly wiles he was\r\non a par with a little child; finding his true sphere when buried in\r\nthe lofty problems of his art, giving to the world the fruits of his\r\ninnermost spirit, which were ever animated by nobility and truth of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven Stood Alone=.—Detesting the fetters of teaching work, he\r\nleft few pupils. Among these =Ferdinand Ries= (1784-1838) enjoyed an\r\nintimate association with him, and afterwards became prominent as piano\r\nvirtuoso and composer. With the great men of his day he affiliated but\r\nlittle. Goethe (1749-1832) he met but once, on one of his journeys;\r\nbut the meeting had no further results. Like other great minds, his\r\noriginal ideas had to make their way amid a shower of abuse from more\r\nconventional contemporaries, who lauded as his equal or superior others\r\nwhose works have long since passed into oblivion; but, fortunate in\r\nfinding staunch defenders, he made steady progress against his enemies,\r\nuntil his position in the music world became unique and unassailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat did Haydn and Mozart give to Beethoven?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Beethoven’s early life.\r\n\r\nWhat works did he particularly study?\r\n\r\nWhat were his first compositions?\r\n\r\nWhat intimate friends did he make in early life?\r\n\r\nWhat city did he select as his home?\r\n\r\nWhat years embrace his first period?\r\n\r\nWhat are the leading works of this period?\r\n\r\nWhat affliction developed in 1800?\r\n\r\nWhat years compose the second period?\r\n\r\nWhat changes came into his style?\r\n\r\nName the leading works of the second period.\r\n\r\nTell about Beethoven’s later life, from 1815 on.\r\n\r\nWhat are the leading works of this last period?\r\n\r\nDescribe the personality of Beethoven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LESSON XXXIII.\r\n\r\n                       BEETHOVEN AND THE SONATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bach and Beethoven Contrasted=.—We now consider the exact nature\r\nof the work which Beethoven did, in distinction from that of Haydn\r\nand Mozart. It has been said that Bach gave the Old Testament in\r\nmusic, while Beethoven gave the New; that is, that Bach consummated\r\nthe old polyphonic school, while Beethoven did an equal work for\r\nthe new harmonic school. Yet this is only a half truth; for Bach,\r\nbesides perfecting former styles, gave glimpses of modern chromatic\r\nmodulation and free expression; while Beethoven, a student of the old\r\nmasters, employed polyphonic forms as well as harmonic, making all\r\nwork together to translate his thought, and so moulding them into a\r\nmeans of portraying every emotion as to open the door forever to the\r\nuntrammelled presentment of thought, through the medium of music.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven’s Gradual Development=.—But Beethoven did not arrive at\r\nthis result in an instant. It is true that, even in his early works, a\r\ndistinction of style is shown which removes them from a mere imitation,\r\nbut, as has been shown, he _began_ practically at the point _where\r\nHaydn and Mozart left off_, with compositions which can hardly be\r\nplaced on a higher level than theirs; and, in the course of a life full\r\nof strenuous experiences, he gradually _unfolded the resources_ which\r\nhe had received from his predecessors, until he made them adequate to\r\ngive vent to the mighty ideas which welled from his soul. Thus we find\r\nin his works a period in which _form is rigidly observed_; and we pass\r\nthence through an era of expansion, during which _form becomes more\r\nelastic_, through the added requirements placed upon it, until the\r\nthought and emotion become so paramount that the _formal lines_ have\r\nentirely _disappeared_, and are only to be traced by careful analysis.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven and the Orchestra=.—As the great exponent of instrumental\r\nmusic, Beethoven found the orchestra his best and fullest vehicle of\r\nexpression. So his massive mind, grasping with ease the effects of\r\nmanifold combinations of instruments, was able to mould his thoughts\r\ninto terms of tone color in which each instrument should be employed to\r\nbring out the exact shade of feeling required. So the orchestra becomes\r\nwith him a great individual instrument, responding to the slightest\r\nchange of mood.\r\n\r\n=Use of the Piano=.—But as a preparation for such orchestral work,\r\nBeethoven realized the value of the pianoforte. Attaining a marvelous\r\ndegree of virtuosity in the use of the keyboard at an early age, he\r\nlater found this of the greatest advantage in working out his ideas,\r\nand, further, in actually trying their effects upon auditors. Thus\r\nwe find in his first pianoforte sonatas effects which appeared much\r\nlater in the greater elaboration of his symphonies; thus also is shown\r\nthe necessary imperfection of any division of his works into distinct\r\nperiods, since his pianoforte style was so greatly in advance of his\r\norchestral.\r\n\r\n=Improvement in the Piano=.—In this connection, it is important to note\r\nthat Beethoven’s resources were greatly increased by the improvements\r\nwhich had been made in piano manufacture. The demand for instruments,\r\ncreated by the growing popularity of the pianoforte, stimulated\r\nmanufacturers to redoubled energy in perfecting them; and, conversely,\r\nthe added resources thus developed were an instigation to composers to\r\ntest their abilities in the invention of new effects. Thus Beethoven\r\nwas placed in command of a piano of much greater power than Mozart’s;\r\nand the work of technicians, like Clementi, for whom he had great\r\nrespect, was already hinting at new and marvelous possibilities.\r\n\r\n=Added Sonority and Sustaining Power=.—This strength of construction\r\nresulted in greater sonority. Hence we find full chord progressions\r\nand rich floods of tone in Beethoven’s works, in place of the dainty\r\nharmonic accompaniment of former writers. Moreover, the increase in\r\nsustaining force, enhanced by the use of the pedal, made possible a\r\nsustained legato tone for singing passages, which had formerly to be\r\nmerely hinted at through shakes and other embellishments. A consequent\r\ntone variety made it possible to emphasize a single voice in this way,\r\nwhile the accompanying harmonies could be kept well in the background.\r\nAgain, this range of tone proved an incentive for long crescendos, from\r\nthe softest suspicion of sound to an overwhelming tonal climax.\r\n\r\n=Increased Compass=.—The added range which the keyboard developed also\r\nenhanced such effects, by the chance for brilliancy in the treble,\r\nand for profundity in the bass; moreover, Beethoven was quick to make\r\nuse of the variety of effects caused by _playing in the different\r\nregisters_; sometimes suggesting in this way the contrast in the\r\norchestra between different groups of instruments, such as the strings\r\nand woodwind.\r\n\r\n=Structure of Beethoven’s Sonatas=.—With such resources at his command,\r\nBeethoven was able to give a fuller scope to the Sonata than was\r\nformerly possible, filling out each movement, and perfecting it for the\r\nexpression of an integral part of the general idea, and finally placing\r\nit in its proper relationship to the whole. The Sonata Form, as settled\r\nby Haydn, was made the point of departure, serving almost invariably\r\nas the basis of the first movement, and frequently, in shortened form,\r\nfor the second, generally slow, movement. For the third movement,\r\nBeethoven at first employed the Minuet, following the custom in the\r\nsymphonies of Haydn and Mozart; but later this was generally omitted in\r\nthe pianoforte sonatas, while in the symphonies its time was quickened\r\ninto that of the dainty, sparkling Scherzo. For the finale, the Rondo\r\nform was most frequent; though, in order to give a fuller compass to\r\nthe thought, a combination of the Rondo and Sonata forms was invented\r\nby Beethoven, and used even in his first sonatas. The Rondo form also\r\nappeared occasionally in the slow movement. Add that other forms,\r\nnotably that of the Variation, sometimes supplanted one or the other of\r\nthese, and we have the structure generally followed by Beethoven.\r\n\r\n=Unity of Conception=.—All these movements were associated in an\r\norganic unity of conception which made one grow out of another with\r\nperfect naturalness. Sometimes, indeed, as in opus 27, a continuity of\r\nperformance was indicated; always, however, the feeling of dependence\r\nof one movement upon another is present; so that the criticism made\r\nupon Haydn’s symphonies, that a movement of one could be interchanged\r\nwith a similar movement of any other without perceptible difference,\r\ncould never be made with regard to Beethoven’s works.\r\n\r\n=Key Relationship=.—In key relationship, Beethoven struck out from\r\nstereotyped paths, frequently using _contrasting keys related to the\r\nthird of the initial chord_; thus a movement or passage in C major\r\nmight be followed by any key related to E, the third of the chord of\r\nC, such as E or A major or minor. The original key was most widely\r\ndeparted from in the slow movement, where the beauty of contrast was\r\nexceptionally noticeable.\r\n\r\n=Number of Movements=.—The number of movements which he adopted was\r\nat first four, but this afterwards varied considerably, two or three\r\nmovements prevailing; while in the fantasie-sonatas, and especially in\r\nthe last five sonatas, an indefinite number of movements, some of them\r\nvery short, appeared. He explained this discrepancy on the ground that\r\nhe adapted the number of movements to his thought; and when he felt\r\nthat he had given complete expression to this, the sonata was brought\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\n=Development of First Movement Form=.—Of Beethoven’s first movements,\r\nit may be said that no one has ever spoken with the perfect freedom\r\nand naturalness which he displays. Each part of the movement he\r\nstrengthened and developed; the first section announced two themes,\r\ncontrasting, but still closely identified; sometimes with a slow\r\nintroduction to usher them in; the Development was given a contrapuntal\r\ntreatment, solidified by rich harmonies; the third section was varied\r\nby rhythmic or tonal devices, tending to broaden its effect; and,\r\nfinally, the Coda was sometimes developed to the length of a fourth\r\nsection, in which reminiscences of material used previously were worked\r\nup to a fitting climax.\r\n\r\n=Devices for Giving Unity=.—But the most evident characteristic which\r\nBeethoven put into this form was that of _Unity_, or _Continuity of\r\nidea_. This he accomplished by several means. Of these, the first was\r\nby separating the most striking parts of his subjects into short,\r\ndefinite phrases or motives, and by introducing these in every variety\r\nof manner throughout the movement, sometimes in a sequence on different\r\ndegrees of the scale, sometimes by imitation in different voices, again\r\nby varying the length of the component notes, and finally by dropping\r\noff portions, while the portions remaining keep the idea still before\r\nthe auditor. Or, some casual phrase, in an unimportant section, will\r\nstrike his fancy and he will develop it with a wealth of imagery\r\nastonishing in its inventiveness.[10]\r\n\r\n=Continuity of Various Parts=.—This constant presentment of a thematic\r\nidea also serves to bind passages closely together which, in the\r\nsonatas of Haydn and Mozart, were separated by definite pauses. Indeed,\r\nBeethoven sedulously _avoids a complete cadence_, seeking, by leading\r\nthe listener eagerly on from one connecting phrase to another, to\r\nretain the interest and make it mount up higher and higher, as the\r\neffects grow in intensity. So phrases are made to overlap one another,\r\nwith their boundaries practically eliminated. It has been said that\r\nBeethoven tore down the fences which Haydn and Mozart had erected\r\nbetween the various parts of the Sonata Form; and this is proven by the\r\nfact that, in the Beethoven sonatas, authorities frequently differ as\r\nto where one part ends and another begins, so close and continuous is\r\nthe bond between them.\r\n\r\n=Dramatic Effects in Climaxes=.—This close connection is made a\r\nready element toward the dramatic expression which finds vent in the\r\nclimaxes, made from culminating tonal effects, where the thematic\r\nphrase mounts up step by step, higher and higher, growing breathless by\r\nshortened rhythm, until the hearer is brought to the summit of dramatic\r\nintensity; and here thunderous arpeggios, mingled together by the use\r\nof the pedal, hold him spellbound with their sonorous waves of sound.\r\nThe supreme passion which Beethoven does not wholly conceal even in\r\nhis quieter moods appears frequently in strange, agitated rhythms and\r\nstartling accents thrown upon unexpected notes or in unexpected places.\r\nHe also used many more marks of expression than his predecessors.\r\n\r\n=Freedom in Modulations=.—The boldness of his modulations has already\r\nbeen mentioned; and these appear with the most freedom in the\r\ndevelopment sections, where tonalities pile upon one another, until the\r\nauditor is apparently inextricably involved in a maze of harmonies;\r\nfrom which, naturally as the awakening from a dream, he finds himself\r\ntransported back to the original key, in which the first theme is\r\ntaking its course. Beethoven’s sense of proportion, however, sees to it\r\nthat this intricacy of keys is well prepared by the definite tonality\r\nof his original subjects, and by the final complete restatement of the\r\noriginal key. His harmonies frequently shocked his contemporaries by\r\ntheir violations of conventional rules; but they have long since been\r\njustified by succeeding musicians, who have departed from them to much\r\nbolder flights.\r\n\r\n=Program Music=.—It has been said that Beethoven furnishes examples\r\nof the program style—that is, the depicting of definite ideas through\r\nmusic. We have already found a tendency of this sort among the early\r\nFrench clavier composers—Rameau, the Couperins and others of their\r\nschool; also in some of the German writers, like Pachelbel and Kuhnau.\r\nViewed in relation to these early composers, Beethoven’s work seems to\r\nhave little in common, since his nearest approach to program music was\r\nin attaching to some of his works certain moods, inspired by events or\r\nscenes. Thus he gives the name “Pathétique” to the sonata, opus 13,\r\n“Appassionata” to opus 57, “Les Adieux” to opus 81; while we have the\r\n“Pastoral” symphony, depicting the mood inspired by country scenes,\r\nand the “Eroica,” showing the mood arising from the contemplation of a\r\nhero’s career.\r\n\r\n=Pianoforte Concertos=.—The same characteristics which are noted in his\r\npianoforte sonatas appeared, developed still further, in his larger\r\nworks, such as his symphonies and piano concertos. The latter, five in\r\nnumber, display the resources of the virtuosity of Beethoven’s day, and\r\nyet keep this always subordinated to the inspired musical sentiment,\r\nwith which the orchestra nobly accords. The last two of these,\r\nbelonging to the maturity of his genius, amply display the powers of\r\ngenuine expression.\r\n\r\n=Variations=.—Of numerous other piano compositions, the sets of\r\nVariations are prominent. He was fond of taking some short and simply\r\nconstructed musical thought, sometimes from some song or opera, and\r\ntreating it in every variety of manner that his fertile genius could\r\nsuggest. Such compositions, while generally playful in mood, have the\r\nfinish which Beethoven never failed to give to his work.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven’s Accuracy in Writing=.—It is this seriousness toward his\r\nart which most fully accentuates the real underlying drift of his\r\nnature. In the midst of his untidy ménage, when confusion of material\r\ngoods reigned about him, Beethoven nevertheless treated each work\r\nwhich flowed from his pen with the most careful and critical revision,\r\nnever allowing it to go out until he had absolutely fixed each note in\r\nits proper place. Where his art was involved, his usually irritable\r\nnature acquired a fund of patience; so that sometimes whole scores were\r\nrewritten, until he arrived at accurate expression; and, when that\r\npoint was reached, his fiat was irrevocable. It is thus a satisfaction\r\nto note that he has not left us the erratic wanderings of an eccentric\r\nmind; but the completed and matured product of a genius, speaking with\r\nauthority and precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Pianoforte Playing.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nShedlock.—The Pianoforte Sonata, Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nNaumann.—History of Music, Vol. II, Chapter XXXII.\r\n\r\nSchindler.—Life of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nOther lives of Beethoven, especially that in Grove’s Dictionary.\r\n\r\nFor musical illustrations, consult the works of Beethoven, especially\r\nthe Pianoforte sonatas, published complete in all the cheap editions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nContrast Bach and Beethoven.\r\n\r\nCharacterize Beethoven’s three periods.\r\n\r\nWhat was the greatest means of expression in Beethoven?\r\n\r\nWhat was the value of his work for the piano in relation to the\r\norchestra?\r\n\r\nWhat was the effect of the improvements in the piano of Beethoven’s\r\ntime over that of Mozart?\r\n\r\nGive a statement of the Sonata as constructed by Beethoven.\r\n\r\nWhat changes did he introduce: Key relationship?

The\r\nmembers of this family were large and cumbersome, troublesome to handle\r\nand not particularly graceful or pleasing to the eye; the position in\r\nwhich the player was forced to hold them was difficult to maintain\r\nand not conducive to a rapid, facile technic. Now, the direction of a\r\nperfected art is always toward simplicity; the various members of the\r\nviol family were to yield place to a new instrument, a modification of\r\nthe original type, and one that possessed some striking and valuable\r\nadvantages over the viol. Another element that aided in the change\r\nfrom the viol was the efforts of composers to produce a distinctive\r\ninstrumental music, a style which demanded an instrument with a higher\r\nrange than the viols, corresponding to the highest female voice. Still\r\nanother element to be considered was the stir in intellectual, social,\r\npolitical and commercial life which was evident everywhere, the product\r\nof the Renaissance. Music was influenced by this spirit; composers were\r\nseeking new forms in which to express their thoughts and were calling\r\nfor new and better media for presenting them to others. As composers\r\ngained in breadth and power of conception, instruments were improved\r\neven beyond their demands; the increase in resources stimulated, in\r\nturn, the composers. At this period music was on the threshold of a\r\nsplendid activity in instrumental lines, the reign of the old choral\r\nmusic and the contrapuntal composer was being challenged, and the way\r\nprepared for Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\n=Beginning of the Violin=.—With regard to the violin, as in other\r\nbeginnings, there is disagreement; the strongest claims are set\r\nforth for France and Italy, with German historians by no means lax\r\nin attributing the first instruments to one of their own countrymen.\r\nWe give the following facts which seem to divide the honors: In the\r\nscores of Italian works of the 16th century, a part may be found for\r\nwhat is called the _piccolo violino alla francese_ (little French\r\nviol), a fact which would argue that an instrument of this kind,\r\nperhaps most commonly used in France, had been known for some time.\r\nThe oldest known instrument of the violin type is one which bears the\r\ndate 1449, and is signed Jean Kerlin, a Breton luthier (lute maker,\r\na term applied also to violin makers), whose name is also given as\r\nKerlino, living in Brescia, Italy, in the middle of the 15th century.\r\nAbout the same time there lived in Bologna, Padua and Venice, members\r\nof a celebrated lute-making family, named Duiffoprugcar, Italian\r\nequivalent for the German name, Tieffenbrucker, for the family came\r\nfrom the Italian Tyrol. The most celebrated member of this family was\r\nGasparo Duiffoprugcar (Casper Tieffenbrucker), who was born about 1469,\r\nlived in Bologna until 1515, when he went to Paris. Later he removed\r\nto Lyons, where he spent the rest of his life. Six instruments having\r\nviolin characteristics (high, not sloping shoulders, deeper curves in\r\nthe waist and better-defined _f_ holes) are attributed to him, bearing\r\ndates of 1510, 1511, 1515 and 1517.\r\n\r\n=Early Italian Makers=.—The next name is that of Gasparo di Salo,\r\nfounder of the Brescian school of violin-making, who was born at a\r\nlittle village called Salo, on Lake Garda; hence his name. His model\r\nvaried, sometimes it was high, at other times flat; as his instruments\r\nproduced a full, sonorous tone, the model was revived in later years\r\nby Joseph Guarnerius. His tenors and double-basses are considered his\r\nfinest work, his violins being a trifle small. The favorite double\r\nbass of Dragonetti, the famous contrabassist, was by di Salo; Ole\r\nBull frequently played on a di Salo violin in his concerts. The\r\ngreatest successor of di Salo was his pupil, =Giovanni Paolo Maggini=\r\n(1590-1640), whose violins are highly prized. They are characterized by\r\na brown varnish and a double purfling.\r\n\r\n=The Cremona School=.—With the public the name Cremona is indissolubly\r\nconnected with violin-making. In the 16th century this city was a\r\nfamous art centre, rivaling Bologna in music and painting. The first\r\ngreat maker and founder of the Cremona school was Andrea (Andrew)\r\nAmati, born about 1520 and died 1577 or 1580.[11] He used mostly a\r\nsmall pattern, top and back high, the varnish amber in color. A number\r\nof his instruments furnished for the Chapel Royal of Charles IX were\r\nknown to have been in Versailles prior to the French Revolution. The\r\nAmati style was continued by Andrea’s two sons, Antonio (Anthony) and\r\nHieronymus (Geronimo or Jerome) Amati. The former is said to have lived\r\n1550-1638, the latter 1551-1635. They worked conjointly, although the\r\nlatter made some experiments with a larger model than the usual Amati.\r\n\r\n=Nicolo Amati=.—The greatest of the Amati family and the one whose\r\ninstruments are still highly prized was =Nicolo (Nicolaus) Amati=\r\n(1596-1684), the son of Geronimo. He forms one of the great triumvirate\r\nof violin-making, Amati, Guarnerius and Stradivarius. At first he\r\nfollowed the small form adopted by his father and his uncle, although\r\nhe improved on the workmanship. But about 1625, no doubt as the result\r\nof an experiment, he began to use a slightly larger pattern which is\r\nknown to connoisseurs as the “Grand Amati.” These instruments represent\r\nhis best work and command a high price. The Amati tone is sweet, mellow\r\nyet somewhat delicate, although remarkable in purity; the instruments\r\nare unsuited to orchestral work, although admirable in chamber music,\r\nparticularly of the old style. The varnish is yellowish or amber\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\n=Joseph Guarnerius=.—In our study of the piano we noted how the small,\r\nweak tone of the clavichord and harpsichord gave way before the fuller\r\ntoned, sonorous pianoforte, which, with its greater possibilities,\r\ncame into use at a time when composers were seeking for means to give\r\nincreased breadth and power to the reproduction of their music. It\r\nwould have been unfortunate for instrumental music if the small though\r\nsweet tone of the Amati violin had been accepted as the ideal. We could\r\nnot have had the surging tumult of Beethoven’s “Eroica” symphony, the\r\ngreat dramatic pictures of Wagner with the Amati to lay on the colors.\r\nMore tone, more sonorousness, more virile singing was needed. One of\r\nthe men to place in the hands of executants the instrument to work\r\nout the conceptions of the great composers was =Giuseppe Guarneri=\r\nor, as he is generally called, Joseph Guarnerius del Gesu. He was\r\nborn at Cremona, 1683, and belonged to a family of lute and violin\r\nmakers. He has been credited with having been a pupil of Stradivari,\r\nyet his instruments show no trace of that maker’s influence. He seems\r\nto have been impressed with the tone-producing qualities of the di\r\nSalo violins, for his best instruments have something of their bold,\r\nvigorous style. He was an experimenter, ever seeking, it would seem,\r\nfor the means of producing big, sonorous tone, and changed his model\r\nfrequently, for which reason his instruments vary much in value.\r\nHis work was not so highly favored by connoisseurs until Paganini\r\nshowed the value of a Guarnerius from the standpoint of tone. His\r\nbest instruments are now greatly admired and, because so few in good\r\ncondition are known, command a high price. The date of Guarnerius’\r\ndeath is not known. Others of the Guarnerius family who lived and\r\nworked at Cremona were Andreas Guarnerius, uncle to Giuseppe, his son\r\nalso called Joseph and known as “_filius Andreæ_” (Son of Andreas) to\r\ndistinguish him from his cousin, Joseph del Gesu, another son Peter,\r\n“of Cremona,” and a son of Joseph _filius Andreæ_, known as Peter of\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\n=Antonius Stradivarius=.—The greatest of violin-makers who united in\r\nhis instruments the brilliant and powerful tone of di Salo and the\r\nBrescian school and the purity and finish of the Amati was =Antonius\r\nStradivarius= (Antonio Stradivari is the Italian form), born in 1644,\r\none year after the death of Monteverde, and died in 1737, five years\r\nafter the birth of Haydn, a period of nearly a century in which a\r\nmost significant development took place in music. He was apprenticed\r\nto Nicolo Amati, and the instruments of his early years are faithful\r\ncopies of that master’s work; but as he grew in years and experience\r\nhe improved on the Amati model, every change tending to produce a more\r\npowerful and resonant tone. The differences that strike the eye most\r\nstrongly are the larger proportions, the flatter arch of the top, and\r\nthe shape of the sound holes. In his earlier instruments he used a\r\nyellowish varnish; after 1684, one of a reddish tint. Stradivarius\r\nalso fixed the form and adjustment of the bridge. He left two sons,\r\nFrancesco and Omoboni, who finished some of their father’s instruments\r\nafter his death. They both died five or six years later. Pupils of\r\nStradivarius who made excellent instruments were =Carlo Bergonzi=\r\n(1712-1750), =Lorenzo Guadagnini= (1695-1740) and his son =Johannes\r\nBaptista Guadagnini= (1750-1785) and =Alessandro Gagliano=.\r\n\r\n=Other Makers=.—Germany’s contribution to violin-making dates from\r\n=Jakob Stainer=, of Absam in Tyrol (1621-1683). Tradition has it that\r\nhe learned his art at Cremona; if so, his work shows no influence of\r\nthe Amati; his model is different, somewhat broader and shorter, the\r\narch of the belly is greater, and the sound holes are set differently;\r\nthe varnish varies from a brown to an amber color; the tone is sweet\r\nand quick to respond, but lacks intensity. A follower of Stainer was\r\n=Ægidius Klotz= (1653-1743), many of whose instruments were sold as\r\nof Stainer’s make. France contributed no makers of great renown. The\r\nnames of importance are =Nicholas Lupot= (1758-1824), a follower\r\nof Stradivarius, and =J. B. Vuillaume= (1799-1875). In England the\r\nmost distinguished names are =Richard Duke= and =Benjamin Banks=\r\n(1727-1795).\r\n\r\n=The Violin Bow=.—A few words must be said in regard to the bow, the\r\nmeans for producing tone from the violin strings. In its earliest\r\nform it was simply a bow with a stretched string. Hair came into use,\r\nto replace the string, about the 13th century, and the bow lost its\r\noriginal shape, becoming straight for nearly its entire length, curving\r\ndownward at the point. Corelli used a bow of this shape. Tartini’s\r\nbow had the same shape, but was made longer. At the end of the 18th\r\ncentury, =François Tourte= (1747-1835), a Paris bow-maker, lengthened\r\nthe bow still more, and bent it slightly inward, giving it the form\r\nfamiliar to us today. Viotti was the first great player to use this\r\nstyle of bow, and is credited with a share in perfecting it. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that upon Tourte’s improvements to the bow rests\r\nthe whole fabric of modern violin-playing, with its wonderful variety\r\nof execution and consequent nuances in expression.\r\n\r\n=The Viola and the Violoncello=.—Two other instruments of the violin\r\ntype are in use, the Viola, the _tenor_ violin, and the Violoncello,\r\nthe _bass_ violin; both these instruments shared in the development of\r\nthe violin, and were made by the great makers, Amati, Guarnerius and\r\nStradivarius. The Contra-bass, the bass-viol, as it is often called,\r\nwhile it is used to furnish the bass to the string orchestra, is a\r\nmember of the viol family, having the special characteristics, sloping\r\nshoulders and flat back. Instruments were made on the violin pattern,\r\nbut given up as less satisfactory than the viol type.\r\n\r\nThe impetus given to instrumental composition by the perfecting of\r\nthe instruments of the string group stimulated makers to work for\r\nimprovement in those belonging to the family of wind instruments,\r\nflutes, oboes, clarinets, horns, harps, etc., thus offering the means\r\nto reproduce for hearers the great conceptions of the tone-masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article on the violin.\r\n\r\nStoeving.—Story of the Violin.\r\n\r\nHart.—The Violin.

This was the more\r\ncertain because the composers who wrote for the instrument were also\r\nplayers, in almost every instance the virtuosi of their times. During\r\nthe polyphonic period, composers were singers or organists; during the\r\nperiod when the violin dominated instrumental composition, composers\r\nin that form were usually violinists. In the next period, when the\r\npianoforte was coming to the front, the representative composers were\r\nclavier composers. And since then with but few exceptions the great\r\ncomposers have also been pianists.\r\n\r\n=Earliest Violin Compositions=.—In the music of the viol period no\r\ndemands were made upon the instrumental player except that he should\r\ndouble the voice part, which was simple, viewed from the standpoint of\r\nmodern violin playing. Even later when music was written for quartets\r\nof viols the parts were vocal in character and did not exceed voices\r\nin range. The earliest known solo composition was published in 1620,\r\nby Marini. It demands but little from the executant. The next work\r\nof importance was in 1627, when Carlo Farina, an Italian living at\r\nDresden, published a collection of pieces which show quite an advance\r\ntechnically, including variety of bowing, double stopping and chords.\r\nThe names applied to violin compositions were: _Sonate_, _Canzone_\r\nand _Sinfonia_, the principle of the first named being an alternation\r\nof slow and quick movements. About 1650 the term Sonata comes into\r\ngeneral use, and a further distinction is made between _Sonata da\r\nChiesa_ (church sonata) and _Sonata da Camera_ (chamber sonata), the\r\nformer consisting of three or four movements varying in tempo, the\r\nlatter being really a suite of dances, with slow and quick movements\r\nin alternation. The Church, always ready to make use of the fine arts,\r\nsoon discovered the capabilities of the violin and its music, and\r\nadopted it as one of its musical forces, not merely for assisting in\r\naccompaniments but for independent performances. As a result of this\r\npatronage, the violin sonata, the only form of serious composition for\r\nthe instrument, took on the severer character of the church sonata,\r\ngiving an impulse toward the establishment of sonata form.\r\n\r\n=Composers of the 17th Century=.—Among those who prepared the way for\r\nthe great ones to follow was =Giovanni Battista Vitali= (1644-1692),\r\nwho shows in his chamber sonatas the tendency to adopt the form of\r\nthe church sonata. His name is best known in violin literature by a\r\nChaconne with variations, which makes no inconsiderable demands on the\r\ntechnic of a player, and must have marked him out as a conspicuous\r\nplayer in his own time. This is a worthy forerunner of Bach’s great\r\nwork in a similar form. In Germany the significant name is =Heinrich\r\nBiber= (1644-1704), who had a highly developed technic for that period,\r\nfor his works carry the player up to the sixth position and introduce\r\ndifficult double stopping and arpeggios. The next name to be noticed\r\nis =Giuseppe Torelli= (1660-1708), who lived many years in Bologna as\r\nleader of a church orchestra. He is credited with having been the first\r\nto apply the principles of construction as shown in the church sonata\r\nto concerted music, which later developed into the Concerto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCANGELO CORELLI.]\r\n\r\n=Corelli=.—In any great movement one man seems to sum up the best\r\nof the work of his predecessors. The name associated with putting\r\nviolin music and playing on a firm foundation is that of =Arcangelo\r\nCorelli= (1653-1713), eminent both as composer and player. He was\r\na contemporary of Guarnerius and Stradivarius, who brought the\r\ninstrument to perfection. Of Corelli’s early life little is known. He\r\ntraveled in France and was also in Munich for some years. In 1681 he\r\nreturned to Italy, making his home at Rome. As a teacher, he acquired\r\ngreat fame and pupils came to him from all parts of Europe. The most\r\neminent violinists who were under his instruction were Geminiani,\r\nLocatelli, Somis, Baptiste, and Castrucci. Corelli did not invent new\r\nforms of composition or of technic—in the latter respect he did not\r\nequal certain of his contemporaries—he was a reformer rather than\r\nan innovator. He had, however, a keen sense for effects that were\r\nspecially suited to the instrument, and his conservatism put the art\r\nof playing the violin on a solid basis upon which others were able to\r\nadd newer and more difficult technic. His works included forty-eight\r\nthree-part sonatas for various combinations, twelve two-part sonatas\r\nfor violin and cembalo, nine for two violins and cembalo, and six\r\nconcertos for two violins and ’cello with a quartet accompaniment.\r\nThe violin being so preëminently a singing, a melody instrument, it\r\nis singular that Corelli and his contemporaries did not grasp the\r\nprinciple of using clearly defined melodic themes. This fact shows that\r\nthe influence of the church sonata and its rejection of a formal tune\r\nas unsuited to serious art was still strong. Therefore, while Corelli’s\r\nworks do not show themes such as are characteristic of the next period\r\nof the sonata, his construction is logical and his handling of his\r\nform-material is concise and clear. The student of Form in music will\r\nfind the germs of sonata-form in Corelli’s works.\r\n\r\n=Corelli’s Pupils=.—Among Corelli’s pupils must be mentioned =Francesco\r\nGeminiani= (1680-1762), who spent part of his life in England. He\r\npublished the first work of a pedagogic character, a “Method for Violin\r\nPlaying,” in London, in 1740. He also recommended holding the violin on\r\nthe left side instead of on the right, as was customary in his time.\r\n=Pietro Locatelli= (1693-1764) greatly influenced the development\r\nof violin technic. =Giovanni Battista Somis= (1676-1763) lived at\r\nTurin, was the teacher of Pugnani, the instructor of Viotti. =Antonio\r\nVivaldi= (1675-1743) devoted himself to virtuosity and influenced the\r\nConcerto from this point. He was fertile and ingenious in making new\r\ncombinations and devising new effects. J. S. Bach arranged his works,\r\nsixteen for the clavier, four for the organ, and one as a concerto for\r\nfour claviers and a quartet of stringed instruments. Still another name\r\nis to be mentioned, that of =Francesco Maria Veracini= (1685-1750),\r\nwho greatly influenced Tartini by his playing. He was a player full of\r\ntemperament, which made his playing powerfully expressive. His sonatas\r\nare bold in harmonic and melodic treatment, and well constructed. Their\r\ntechnical difficulty is considerable. (His lifetime coincides with\r\nBach.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIUSEPPE TARTINI.]\r\n\r\n=Giuseppe Tartini= (1692-1770) is one of the commanding figures of\r\nmusical history. He was intended for the profession of law by his\r\nparents but, fortunately for music, did not fall in with the plan.\r\nA hasty marriage with the niece of an archbishop brought him into\r\ntrouble, and he fled to a monastery, where he spent two years, devoting\r\nthe greater part of his time to musical studies. At the end of this\r\ntime he was allowed to rejoin his wife, and went to Venice, where he\r\nlearned to know Veracini, with whom he studied to correct the faults\r\nhe had acquired through pursuing his studies undirected. Again he went\r\ninto retirement and gave himself up to the study of violin technic.\r\nAmong other things he made some improvements in the bow, increasing\r\nthe range of effects. His contemporaries ascribe to him “a fine\r\ntone, unlimited command of fingerboard and bow, perfect intonation\r\nin double stops, a most brilliant trill and double trill as well,\r\nwhich he could execute equally well with all fingers.” His celebrated\r\ncomposition “_Il Trillo del Diavolo_” (“The Devil’s Trill”) shows his\r\nskill in embellishments. A technical work “_Arte dell’ Arco_” (“The\r\nArt of Bowing”) gives a clear idea of his method in that branch of\r\nthe violinist’s art. In his compositions he shows advance on Corelli\r\nand Vivaldi, for his melody is broader, his phrases more developed\r\nand clearer, his harmonies richer and better contrasted, with many\r\npassages of a strongly emotional character. He wrote a great number\r\nof pieces, sonatas and concertos. In addition to his work as player\r\nand composer, Tartini devoted himself to teaching. His school at Padua\r\nwas the Mecca of violinists from all Europe. In those days there were\r\nno instruction books; Tartini’s pupils looked to him for everything,\r\nand his character as a teacher can be learned in a letter addressed by\r\nhim to a pupil.[12] Tartini’s contribution to music also includes work\r\nof a theoretical character. He discovered the so-called combinational\r\nsound, by which is meant the sounding of a third sound when two tones\r\nare sounded together.[13] He published a treatise on the subject.\r\nTwo pupils of Tartini’s who deserve mention are =Pietro Nardini=\r\n(1722-1793) and =Gaetano Pugnani= (1726-1803), who was also a pupil of\r\nSomis, thus uniting in himself the teachings of the two great masters,\r\nTartini and Corelli, which he transmitted to later generations through\r\nhis great pupil, Viotti.\r\n\r\nWith Tartini the violin sonata of the old type lost its place, being\r\nsucceeded by the sonata for the piano which was being developed by\r\ncomposers, giving rise to a form that was later to be the basis of\r\na new sonata for violin and piano in which each instrument filled\r\nan equal place. In the earlier days the tone of the clavichord and\r\nharpsichord, weak and thin, was not suited save for accompanying the\r\nfull-toned brilliantly effective violin; but after Tartini’s time\r\nthe instrument gained in power and sonorousness and formed a worthy\r\nhelpmeet for the violin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIOVANNI BATTISTA VIOTTI.]\r\n\r\n=Violin playing in France= was largely influenced by Italian players.\r\nLully, the opera composer, was a violinist, but the Italian school\r\nhad not developed when, as a lad, he left his native country. The\r\nCorelli principles were carried to France by =Leclair= (1687-1764), who\r\nreceived his training from Somis, a pupil of Corelli. His treatment of\r\nthe bow showed the lightness and agility that later became distinctive\r\nof the French school. =Pierre Gaviniés= (1726-1800) lent strength to\r\nthe establishment of an independent French school of playing. He is\r\nbest known today by a set of difficult studies. =Giovanni Battista\r\nViotti= (1753-1824), an Italian by birth, greatly influenced violin\r\nplaying in his day. As a lad of seventeen he traveled through Europe\r\nwith Pugnani, his teacher, winning great success. Later he located in\r\nParis, teaching and composing, giving regularly private performances at\r\nwhich he brought out his concertos. His themes have a marked singing\r\ncharacter, and all his writing is eminently suited to the instrument.\r\nIn his concertos he used the elaborated sonata-form as developed by\r\nHaydn, Mozart and Beethoven, and in his accompaniments draws fully\r\non the resources of the orchestra. His works include a fine set of\r\nduets for two violins. His most eminent pupils were =Pierre Rode=\r\n(1774-1830) and =Pierre Marie François de Sales Baillot= (1771-1842)\r\nwho with =Rodolphe Kreutzer= (1766-1831) were teachers in the Paris\r\nConservatoire, for which they prepared the famous “Méthode de Violin.”\r\nRode and Kreutzer are famous in violin literature for their studies\r\nfor advanced players. Beethoven dedicated his great sonata for piano\r\nand violin, Op. 47, to Kreutzer, for which reason it is known by\r\nthe latter’s name. In connection with the educational writers just\r\nmentioned, =Federigo Fiorillo=, born 1753, in Germany, of Italian\r\nparents, is to be noted. His thirty-six etudes or caprices rank with\r\nthe works of Rode and Kreutzer. =Antonio Lolli= (1730-1802) was a\r\nvirtuoso and nothing else. His execution was marvelous, and he was, in\r\nmany respects, a forerunner of Paganini.\r\n\r\n=Violin playing in Germany= had its source and inspiration in the\r\nconcert tours made in that country by the great Italian virtuosi,\r\na number of whom lived for periods of some length at the courts of\r\nBerlin, Dresden, Mannheim and other capitals, where they trained\r\npupils for the various ducal orchestras. The orchestra at Mannheim was\r\nthe most famous for its work and sent out a number of fine players\r\nand musicians. Space does not permit the mention of these men. The\r\nfirst great name in the violin world of Germany is =Ludwig Spohr=\r\n(1784-1859), who was also one of the great composers of his time, his\r\nactivity leading him into the domain of the oratorio and opera as well\r\nas orchestra and instrumental music. (His principal teacher was =Franz\r\nEck= (1774-1804), who belonged to the Mannheim school.) Later he had\r\nopportunity to hear Rode, by whose playing he was much impressed. He\r\nspent some years in concertizing, and in 1822 located at Cassel as the\r\ndirector of the orchestra there. Here he taught many noted pupils,\r\nthe best known being Ferdinand David. While Spohr was a great player\r\nand a great teacher, he influenced modern violin playing more by his\r\ncompositions. Some of his concertos still figure in the violinist’s\r\nrepertoire and his duos and concertantes for two violins and for\r\nviolin and viola are unsurpassed by any compositions in that style.\r\nIn 1831, he published his “Violin School,” which was a standard work\r\nfor many years. The direct successor of Spohr was =Ferdinand David=\r\n(1810-1873), a great player and a great teacher who was associated with\r\nMendelssohn in the founding of the famous Leipzig Conservatorium. From\r\nthis institution David’s pupils went over all Europe into positions of\r\nresponsibility and reputation. His greatest pupil was =August Wilhelmj=\r\n(b. 1845). After David’s death supremacy in the field of violin playing\r\ngradually fell away from Leipzig and centred in Berlin around Joseph\r\nJoachim, the Nestor of the present-day[14] violin world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUDWIG SPOHR.]\r\n\r\n=The Vienna School=.—The southern Germans had certain characteristics\r\nwherein they differed from their northern kin; they were in closer\r\ntouch with Italy and were also influenced by their Hungarian\r\nneighbors. In Beethoven’s time considerable attention was given by\r\nViennese violinists to chamber-music. Four names are prominent: =Karl\r\nDittersdorf= (1739-1799), =Anton Wranitzky= (1756-1808), =Joseph\r\nMayseder= (1789-1863) and =Joseph Bœhm= (1795-1876), the latter\r\nbeing the teacher of a number of famous violinists, =Hellmesberger=,\r\n=Dont=, =Remenyi=, =Ernst= and =Joseph Joachim= (b. 1831), the latter,\r\nrepresenting the solid, classical style of his teacher, joined to a\r\nmastery of the technic of his instrument that enabled him to win and\r\nmaintain the highest rank as virtuoso, quartet player and composer\r\nfor his instrument. Up to the time of his death, August 15, 1907, he\r\nwas director of the Royal High School of Music in Berlin. He was the\r\nteacher of hundreds of players, including many celebrated artists of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH JOACHIM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NICOLO PAGANINI.]\r\n\r\n=Paganini=.—The most unique, most startling figure in music belongs\r\nto the violin, a law unto himself in his playing, one for whom the\r\nviolin seemed to have been perfected long years before by Guarnerius\r\nand Stradivarius and one who seemed to have been made for the violin,\r\nthe hero of fictions innumerable, to whom was attributed in his day\r\nall manner of occult power. This mysterious king of the violin was\r\n=Nicolo Paganini=, born in Genoa, February 18, 1782, died May 27,\r\n1840. Never strong in body, in his early youth he gave himself up to\r\ndissipation to such an extent that he undermined his constitution, and\r\npassed through the world as a spectre rather than as a man. Paganini\r\nwas self-developed, he belonged to no school and he founded none, yet\r\nso great was his command of the technic of the violin and the bow, that\r\nno other player so profoundly influenced contemporaries and successors\r\non the matter of virtuosity. He taught but one pupil, =Camille Sivori=\r\n(1815-1894). Paganini greatly influenced the younger French violinists\r\nof his day, among whom may be mentioned =Alard= and =Dancla=. After\r\nthese men come =Charles de Bériot= (1802-1870), who represents the\r\nBelgian School, his pupil =Henri Vieuxtemps= (1820-1881) and third\r\ngeneration in the line of pupilage, =Eugen Ysaye= (b. 1858). Others who\r\nbelong to the Belgian School are =Massart= (teacher of =Wieniawski=,\r\n=Kreisler= and others), =Léonard= (teacher of =César Thomson=,\r\n=Marsick=, =Musin=, =Marteau=, etc.). At the present time the centre\r\nof interest in the violin world has shifted to Prague, where =Ottokar\r\nŠevčík= has sent out young violinists of the Slav race who display the\r\nmost astonishing technical mastery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Violin Playing,\r\nSonata, Concerto, and players mentioned in this lesson.\r\n\r\nStoeving.—Story of the Violin.\r\n\r\nEhrlich.—Celebrated Violinists.\r\n\r\nHart.—The Violin and its Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat was the form of early violin music?\r\n\r\nWhat difference was there in sonatas?\r\n\r\nWhat were Corelli’s contributions to music?\r\n\r\nWhat were Tartini’s contributions to music?\r\n\r\nTrace the connection between the French and Italian schools.\r\n\r\nTrace the connection between the German and the Italian schools.\r\n\r\nTrace the connection between the Vienna and the Italian schools.\r\n\r\nWhat composers contributed most largely to the educational side of\r\nviolin music?\r\n\r\nPrepare a short sketch of Paganini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LESSON XXXVI.\r\n\r\n                   THE ORCHESTRA AND ABSOLUTE MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Orchestra as a Means of Expression=.—The most perfect means for\r\nexpression in music is presented by the orchestra, which, in its\r\ncomplete form as shown today, is the result of a long development in\r\nmany directions. To give us this magnificent mass-instrument required a\r\nsifting of the various instruments and the choice of those that offered\r\nthe best possibilities, a perfecting of these instruments, a shaping of\r\nsystems of playing them, of technic that should draw out all possible\r\neffects, and an understanding, on the part of composers, of the nature\r\nand demands of absolute music and how best to shape their conceptions\r\nin accordance with these demands. The orchestra and its music,\r\ntherefore, represents the extreme height of man’s work in music, for\r\neven when choral forces are joined to the orchestra, the instrumental\r\nidea dominates, as, for example, in the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven, in\r\nwhich the chorus is simply a _vocal band_ added to the other groups.\r\nThe orchestra is a great means for musical expression because it\r\noffers to the composer the maximum of resources. In modern days, when\r\nthe esthetic principle of Unity in Variety receives the most elastic\r\ninterpretation due to the demand for the greatest possible contrasts\r\nin tone-color, power and in nuances, all, however, intended to exhibit\r\nand illumine the themes invented by the composer in their various\r\ntransformations, in these days the orchestra is truly the most complete\r\nart-means known.\r\n\r\n=Groups in the Orchestra=.—The orchestra is composed of groups\r\nof instruments allied by similarity of construction. The usual\r\nclassification is into three main groups, =strings=, (bowed\r\ninstruments), =wind= and =percussion= instruments. In the former are\r\nincluded the violins, viola, violoncello and double or contra-bass;\r\n=wind= instruments subordinate into =wood wind= and =brass=, the\r\nformer include instruments of the flute, oboe, bassoon and clarinet\r\nfamilies, the latter horns, trumpets, trombones, tuba or other bass\r\ninstruments; the =percussion= includes kettle drums, other drums,\r\ntriangles, cymbals, etc.; the =harp=, while a stringed instrument, is\r\nnot included in that class. These instruments offer a great variety\r\nof effects, singly and in many possible combinations, in the peculiar\r\neffects possible by variety in playing, which in bowed instruments\r\nis considerable, and particularly by contrast with each other. While\r\nthe orchestra today is in a highly developed condition, composers are\r\nseeking to extend the limits of their art by the use of more elaborate\r\nand subtle forms; so that we cannot in any wise predict the course and\r\nlimits of absolute music with the almost unlimited resources at its\r\ndisposal in the modern orchestra.\r\n\r\n=Purpose in Combination=.—When we consider the orchestra as a\r\ncombination of instruments we must bear in mind that this combination\r\nis the result of a definite purpose to produce music independent\r\nof restrictions such as were shown to have existed in the days of\r\nthe domination of the Church. The composers of the early polyphonic\r\nperiod and up to the 17th century bent their efforts to the\r\ncomposition of choral music which was sung for many years without\r\ninstrumental support. When later the organ, and still later, viols\r\nand other instruments were drafted into the service of church music,\r\nthe accompaniments were not independent of the voice, but merely\r\ndoubled the various parts. Composers thought in _terms of voices_\r\nand their limitations, _not in_ the greater range and endurance of\r\n_instruments_. Then, too, the instruments were crude and their tone\r\nlacked distinctiveness as well as the comparative sweetness and purity\r\nof the vocal music of that day. Combinations of instruments existed in\r\nthe Middle Ages, but not according to a system, and were due to the\r\nexecutants who assembled them rather than to the demand for them in the\r\nworks of composers. It was in the attempts at light dramatic music that\r\npreceded the establishment of the opera that instruments were grouped\r\ntogether, showing a great weakness, from our point of view, in stringed\r\ninstruments played with the bow, and a corresponding preponderance of\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Opera=.—The first composers of opera and oratorio\r\ngave instrumental support to the singers, although it was very meager.\r\nYet the opera gave the help of that great principle of invention,\r\nnecessity, and composers began to experiment with various combinations\r\nof instruments to secure a more adequate accompaniment for the voice as\r\nwell as to heighten the effects demanded by the drama. =Monteverde=, an\r\nindependent thinker and innovator, marked out lines in which efforts\r\nshould be made by successors. He studied the _characteristic effects\r\nof_ the various _groups_ and made use of them as he felt them. His\r\norchestra for “Orfeo” (1608) was made up of two harpsichords, ten tenor\r\nviols, two bass viols, two “little French violins,” one double harp,\r\ntwo organs of wood, one regal, two viole de gamba, two large guitars,\r\ntwo cornets, two trombones, three trumpets with mutes, one octave\r\nflute, one clarion. The most significant item is found in the “little\r\nFrench violins,” which presages the appearance of the instrument\r\nwhich was, a century later, to be recognized as the backbone of the\r\norchestra. Among the distinctive instrumental effects which Monteverde\r\nintroduced was the =tremolo= for bowed string instruments as well\r\nas the =pizzicato=. In looking over the instruments of Monteverde’s\r\norchestra we will note but _one_ wood wind, the flute. This shows that\r\ncomposers, doubtless through the military use of brass and drums, had\r\naccepted the latter as means for special effects. Instruments of the\r\n_wood wind_ type were still too _crude_ to be admitted. =Alessandro\r\nScarlatti=, who did so much for the opera from the side of form and\r\ncontent, also contributed to the development of orchestral music. He\r\nevidently perceived the importance of having a nucleus around which\r\nto build his harmonies, a group of instruments which should furnish a\r\nfirm support and which could blend the various tone qualities. With the\r\nintuition of genius he selected the =string tone= for this purpose, and\r\nin this he was greatly aided by the fact that the Amati family, and\r\ntheir successors, Guarnerius and Stradivarius, had already perfected\r\nthe violin, although the great players were yet to come. Scarlatti\r\nwrote in four parts for the string instruments, the treble part to the\r\nfirst violin, the alto to the second, the tenor part to the viola,\r\nwhich previously had often played in unison with the double bass, while\r\nthe bass part was taken by ’cellos and basses. He also added =oboes=\r\nand =bassoons= to the strings and brass. Lully in France used an\r\norchestra similar to that adopted by Scarlatti. The =kettle-drums= now\r\ncome into use. The works of Corelli and his violinist successors, which\r\nshowed the possibility of writing for strings, undoubtedly influenced\r\norchestral writing.\r\n\r\n=Bach and Handel=.—We now come to the period of Bach and Handel, each\r\ndistinct in methods, the latter the more immediately influential in the\r\ndevelopment of the orchestra, the former’s principles of writing in\r\nthe =polyphonic style= not being taken up until after years by Wagner\r\nand more recently by the extreme modern composers with their free\r\npolyphony. In a Bach score each instrument had an independent part to\r\nsing, and was treated from a musical standpoint, whereas the tendency\r\nof other composers was to seek figures and passages which should be\r\ncharacteristic of the instrument, the standpoint of effect. This\r\nparticularly applies to the wind instruments. =Handel’s= idea seemed\r\nto be the building up of great =mass effects=, his style partook of\r\nthe =harmonic= rather than the polyphonic. He used all the important\r\ninstruments found in the modern orchestra except the _clarinet_,\r\nalthough the proportion of the wind instruments to the strings is\r\ngreater, due to the relatively inferior power of these instruments in\r\nHandel’s time.\r\n\r\n=Haydn and Mozart=.—From Handel we pass to the first of his three great\r\nsuccessors, =Haydn=, who has been called the “father of the symphony,”\r\nwho determined, in fact, the course of orchestral development. And\r\nwe should not overlook the fact before-mentioned, namely, that the\r\nprofessional violinists, most of whom were also directors of orchestras\r\nin the pay of great princes, were testing the capacities and resources\r\nof the instruments used. In the period which Haydn represents, the\r\n_proportions of the instruments_ in the orchestra were definitely\r\n_fixed_ and the size of the string band became relatively greater,\r\nthe _’cello_ coming in to greater prominence in its use as a _melody\r\ninstrument_. Haydn’s last symphony, written in 1795, calls for two\r\nflutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two kettle drums, and\r\nthe usual string band. This was the combination which Haydn selected\r\nas the most useful and effective, as the result of his experience as\r\na conductor for many years. It was to =Mozart= that the introduction\r\nof the =clarinet= into the orchestra is due, for Haydn did not employ\r\nthis instrument in his earlier works. The clarinet began to take an\r\neffective form about the end of the 17th century, yet it was not until\r\nthe 19th century that it received the improvements that now make it one\r\nof the most useful instruments in the orchestra, with a wonderfully\r\nfacile technic and correct intonation. The greatest of these changes\r\nwas the application, to the clarinet, of the system of keys and\r\nfingering invented by =Theobald Boehm= (1794-1881) for the flute. In\r\naddition to showing the value of the clarinet as an instrument, Mozart\r\npointed the way to some uses of the =trombone=. His E-flat Symphony\r\nis scored for one flute, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two\r\ntrumpets, tympani and strings; in the score of the “Jupiter” symphony,\r\nthe clarinet does not appear.\r\n\r\n=Beethoven= established the orchestra as “the composer’s instrument.”\r\nHe added but little to the instruments used but he took the resources\r\nestablished by his predecessors and demonstrated what could be done\r\nwith them. Every group of instruments was used with more detail and\r\nto produce characteristic effects both separately and in combination.\r\nIn his first and second symphonies he uses the same orchestra:\r\ntwo flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two\r\ntrumpets, tympani and strings; in the “Eroica,” a third horn part is\r\nadded; the fourth has the same orchestra as the first two, except\r\nthat one flute is dropped; the fifth calls for piccolo, two flutes,\r\ntwo oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contra-bassoon, two horns,\r\ntwo trumpets, three trombones, tympani and strings; in the sixth\r\nhe uses the same orchestra as in the fifth, except that he drops\r\nthe contra-bassoon and one trombone; in the seventh and eighth the\r\norchestra is the same as in his first and second symphonies. In the\r\nninth (Choral Symphony) he calls for a larger orchestra: piccolo, two\r\nflutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contra-bassoon, four\r\nhorns, two trumpets, three trombones, tympani, triangle, cymbals, bass\r\ndrum and strings. It will be noted that Beethoven does _not use the\r\nharp_. It was not until 1820, seven years before Beethoven’s death,\r\nthat Erard invented the double-action harp, an effective and a playable\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n=Berlioz, Wagner and Richard Strauss=.—The composer who first made\r\nan exhaustive study of orchestral instruments, their distinctive\r\nqualities, separately and in combinations, was =Berlioz=, who gave\r\nto the world his knowledge in his “Treatise on Instrumentation,”\r\npublished in 1844. Berlioz gave to every one of his works a more or\r\nless distinctive quality by varying the composition of his orchestra\r\ninstead of using the conventional combinations. He made frequent use\r\nof the harp, bass clarinet, English horn, bass tuba, besides other\r\nless frequently used instruments. He very much enlarged the scope of\r\norchestral music by the new effects he devised. =Richard Wagner=, in\r\nhis great music dramas, makes use of many new means of dramatic musical\r\neffects, introducing new instruments, enlarging the various families,\r\ndividing the strings into eight parts, increasing the number of brass\r\ninstruments, giving to his scores a richness of power and a sonorous\r\nquality unknown before his time. =Richard Strauss= is, today, the\r\ngreatest master of the technic of orchestral writing. His tone-poems\r\nmake greater demands on the resources of the instruments and contain\r\neffects beyond those of Wagner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HECTOR BERLIOZ.]\r\n\r\n=Hector Berlioz= (1803-1869) was the son of a French physician, who\r\ndesigned him for his own profession. But the lad’s bent for music was\r\nso strong that when sent to Paris to prepare for a medical degree, he\r\nspent most of his time in going to the opera and in studying the scores\r\nof the masters. Much against the will of his parents, he determined to\r\ngive up medicine and entered the _Conservatoire_. His early musical\r\ntraining had been far from thorough and his career was at first not\r\nsuccessful. This added to his father’s displeasure, and he finally\r\nwithdrew all support from his son, who, rather than abandon his art,\r\nstruggled with the most crushing poverty until a violent illness\r\nbrought on by privation reconciled his parents to his choice of a\r\nprofession. After several unsuccessful attempts, he gained the great\r\nRoman Prize, which entitled him to a period of study in Italy and\r\nGermany at the cost of the State, but throughout his life he battled at\r\nhome with adverse and discouraging conditions, artistic and domestic.\r\nUntil after his death his works never received the recognition gladly\r\npaid them in foreign countries, where he made frequent tours for\r\nthe purpose of producing them. His demand for exceptional means of\r\nperformance, based upon their large scope and previously unheard-of\r\neffects, was ridiculed in France, where they were also considered\r\ndissonant and bombastic; he encountered jealousy and intrigue at every\r\nturn and bore them, too, in no patient spirit.\r\n\r\n=His Important Works=.—As a winner of the Roman Prize, however, he\r\nhad a claim on the State. Thus his great “Te Deum,” written for three\r\nchoruses, soli, and orchestra, was one of several commissions from\r\nthe Government and was composed for the opening of the Exposition of\r\n1855. Another similar colossal work is his “Requiem,” with its four\r\nsmall orchestras of brass stationed at the corners of the principal\r\norchestra. These cross and re-cross with thrilling effect, simulating\r\nthe blowing of the last trump. His most popular and widely-known work,\r\n“The Damnation of Faust,” a dramatic cantata now frequently heard in\r\nthis country and in Europe, failed to awaken the slightest interest\r\nat its first performance in 1846 and involved the composer heavily in\r\ndebt. His enthusiasm for Shakespeare led to the composition of what\r\nsome consider his most important work, “Romeo and Juliet,” a symphony\r\nfor orchestra, solo voices and chorus. Berlioz’ genius was essentially\r\ninstrumental and symphonic in character; hence, though he composed a\r\nnumber of operas, none was successful. Indeed, the failure of “Les\r\nTroyens” (The Trojans), the subject of which was taken from the “Æneid”\r\nand which he intended to be his masterpiece, was his death-blow.\r\n\r\n=His Genius as an Orchestral Composer=.—Berlioz was the founder of\r\nthe modern school of orchestration, as well as the pioneer in the art\r\nof expressing a definite program in terms of absolute music. Like\r\nhis great contemporary, Wagner, he was no executant; he played but\r\nlittle and, curiously enough, only such insignificant instruments as\r\nthe flute, flageolet, and guitar. The orchestra was his instrument\r\nand no one has ever had a more unerring instinct for its capabilities\r\neither as a whole or in its component parts. In the origination of\r\nweird, unearthly effects he had been anticipated by Weber, whom he\r\ngreatly admired; but he went beyond him in devising bold and daring\r\ncombinations, which he justified by the end in view, though it\r\ncannot be said that a refined taste always finds this end in itself\r\njustifiable. For example, in the last movement of his “Fantastic\r\nSymphony,” he pictures an execution by the guillotine. A company\r\nof witches and demons dance around the headless body and perform a\r\nburlesque requiem—the whole supposed to be a nightmare suffered by\r\nan artist under the influence of opium. Color rather than outline,\r\nthrilling and novel effects of sonority, rhythmical variety and\r\nanimation, intensity of expression and dramatic climax are the\r\nprincipal characteristics of Berlioz’ music. Yet delicacy and charm are\r\nby no means lacking in his works. Irregular in proportion and unequal\r\nin inspiration as they frequently are, they undoubtedly entitle him\r\nto the distinction of being the greatest composer that France has yet\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n=The Music of the Orchestra= includes Symphonies, Overtures, Symphonic\r\nPoems, Tone-Poems and Suites and the Concerto for a solo instrument\r\nwith orchestral support. The symphony is an elaborated sonata, and the\r\nfirst movement is usually constructed on the principles recognized\r\nunder the term Sonata-form; the same principles are used in the\r\nOverture, which consists of but a single movement. Liszt, in his\r\nefforts in the program music style, devised the Symphonic Poem, which\r\naims to present a series of emotional pictures in the Symphonic style,\r\nbut with the various movements continuous. He advocated deriving _all_\r\nthemes from a _common source_, transforming them rhythmically as needed\r\nto work out his conception. His successors in this style of music still\r\nuse the thematic methods devised by the writers in the true symphonic\r\nstyle, but are free in their methods of construction and elaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on the Orchestra and\r\nthe various instruments used, the Sonata, Symphony, Overture, Suite,\r\netc., and Sonata-Form.\r\n\r\nHenderson.—The Orchestra and Orchestral Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhy is the orchestra the greatest means for musical expression?\r\n\r\nClassify the instruments used in the orchestra.\r\n\r\nWhat difference is there in the combination of instruments in the\r\nmodern orchestra and in the first attempts?\r\n\r\nHow did the opera influence the development of the orchestra and\r\norchestral music?\r\n\r\nContrast Bach and Handel.

WEBER, SPOHR, MARSCHNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Romantic Movement=.—The revolutionary spirit which arose in Europe\r\ntoward the end of the 18th century had its counterpart in a similar\r\nintellectual and artistic reaction, commonly known as the Romantic\r\nMovement. In Literature, this movement was led by France; in Music, by\r\nGermany. Briefly described, it consisted in casting aside the classical\r\ntraditions which the Renaissance had imposed upon art in general and\r\nin a substitution of themes and a treatment more in consonance with\r\nthe atmosphere of freedom which had inspired such momentous social and\r\npolitical changes.\r\n\r\n=Its Effect on Music=.—The musician also felt the influence of the\r\ngeneral unrest. In seeking new modes of expression, he rose to a\r\nconsciousness of independence both as man and artist; he refused longer\r\nto occupy the position of an upper servant which had been decreed him\r\nby court and nobility. Mozart marked the passing of the old order of\r\nthings by his indignant rejection of the humiliating conditions of\r\nservice under the haughty Archbishop of Salzburg, only remembered\r\nby later generations through his connection with the musician he\r\ntreated so contemptuously. Heretofore music had been the privileged\r\nentertainment of the great and wealthy. Like other privileges, it was\r\nto pass into the possession of the people, hitherto shut out from its\r\nenjoyment save in the Church. It was to draw inspiration from a rich\r\nstore of Folk-lore and poetry heretofore disregarded by the scholar\r\nand the musician, but soon to be recognized as a national heritage of\r\nhigh import; it was to create new forms instead of being dependent on\r\ntime-worn formulæ which were repressing growth and development.\r\n\r\n=The Romantic Opera=.—The Romantic Movement had the effect of finally\r\nbanishing from the stage the characters of classical mythology, the\r\nheroes and personages of antiquity who had been thought alone worthy\r\nof representation by the poets and savants who had thus far prepared\r\nthe texts for operas. In the romantic opera their places were taken\r\nby figures of legend or chivalry, elves and spirits of earth or air;\r\nthe action paid no regard to the unities of time and place; it was\r\nbrisk and animated and the supernatural played an important part in\r\nit. The music, instead of being governed by the restraints of definite\r\nforms, adapted itself to the varying exigencies of the drama; the\r\nsharp division between the recitative and the aria was softened by\r\nthe introduction of the Scena, a peculiarly effective mingling of the\r\nfeatures of both; the overture became an integral part of the whole\r\nby the use of themes associated with leading dramatic situations.\r\nThe orchestra not only supplied an harmonic and a rhythmically\r\ninteresting accompaniment but its power of independent expression was\r\nenormously enlarged; it became, so to speak, one of the _Dramatis\r\nPersonæ_ and vied with the singers in indicating psychological and\r\ndramatic crises. This was largely due to the development of a new\r\nphase of instrumentation, perhaps the most striking detail of the\r\nRomantic school—that of novel and original combinations of instruments\r\nto produce varying and expressive shades of tone color. Heretofore\r\nthe orchestra had been considered in the main in its more obvious\r\ndivisions; sonority and beauty of tone had been the chief aim of the\r\nclassical composers. =Carl Maria von Weber= (1786-1826) was the first\r\nto utilize the individual timbres of orchestral instruments to secure\r\neffects of a weird, unearthly character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL MARIA VON WEBER.]\r\n\r\n=Weber and the Romantic Opera=.—In his _Der Freischütz_ (The\r\nFreeshooter) we first find the union of all these characteristics.\r\nHence Weber is rightfully considered the founder of the romantic opera;\r\nbut it would be a mistake to assume that he was the originator of all\r\nits features. These had been long in the air. In Haydn, the works of\r\nMozart and Beethoven, in the ballads of Loewe, the songs of Schubert,\r\nunmistakable romantic traits can often be found, but they are embodied\r\nin established forms. Weber, however, brought together the qualities\r\nnow associated with the term romantic in music, and in applying them to\r\nthe drama freed them from the restrictions of a fixed musical structure.\r\n\r\n=Influence of “Der Freischütz.”=—The effect of _Der Freischütz_ on\r\nits production in Berlin in 1821 was instantaneous. The story of the\r\nhunter’s recourse to unholy arts in order to win success in the chase,\r\nof his rescue from Satanic power and the final triumph of good over\r\nevil; the music, fresh, vivid, essentially national in color, appealed\r\nto the people to whom the legend was well known. It meant the birth\r\nof German opera, German alike in drama and music; it gave the final\r\nblow to the supremacy of foreign influences in Germany. This success\r\nat first, however, was confined almost entirely to the people. Critics\r\nand musicians generally could not reconcile themselves to its mingling\r\nof styles; the supernatural element seemed to them exaggerated, the\r\nintroduction of the Folk-song wanting in dignity. Only the greatest\r\nof them all, Beethoven, deaf and cynical as he was, realized the\r\nsignification of _Der Freischütz_ as the beginning of a new era for\r\nGerman art. He said to Rochlitz: “Weber should now write operas—one\r\nafter the other without hesitation.”\r\n\r\n=Euryanthe=.—Weber’s next opera was _Euryanthe_, produced in 1823 in\r\nVienna. In this he was hampered by a text of more than doubtful merit\r\nand lacking the national element which had been so strong a factor in\r\n_Der Freischütz_. The story is laid in the medieval chivalric epoch and\r\nstrongly resembles Shakespeare’s _Cymbeline_. He also ventured upon\r\nan innovation which was not in favor with the German public: he set\r\nit to music throughout, the place of the dialogue customary in German\r\nopera being taken by accompanied recitative. _Euryanthe_ and Spohr’s\r\n_Jessonda_, which appeared several months before the former, were the\r\nfirst German operas in this style since Schütz’s _Dafne_. This and\r\nits confused plot kept _Euryanthe_ from the popular success achieved\r\nby _Der Freischütz_, yet it contains some of Weber’s most thrilling\r\ninspirations, and is the direct prototype of the modern music drama.\r\n\r\n=Oberon=.—In _Oberon_ (1826), composed for London to an English text,\r\nWeber returned to his former manner, though somewhat against his\r\nwill. He found the English opera much the same as in Purcell’s time,\r\npractically a play with music as an incidental feature rather than as\r\nan integral part of the drama. He intended casting _Oberon_ into a\r\nlarger mould, reducing the dialogue and adding to the music, but this\r\nwas prevented by his premature death in London two months after its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n=Recitative and Dialogue=.—The chilling effect of alternating speech\r\nand song has already been spoken of in connection with the English\r\nopera. At that time, both English and German taste was against the\r\nuse of recitative in the narrative parts of an opera. The _recitativo\r\nsecco_, which it will be remembered is a recitative supported only\r\nby chords on the harpsichord or piano, sometimes accompanied with a\r\nsingle stringed instrument, has never met with favor outside of Italy,\r\nwhere its intonations nearly approach the half-singing inflections of\r\nItalian speech. The exclusive use of accompanied recitative—that is,\r\nthe recitative accompanied by the full orchestra, however, delays the\r\naction and moreover appears weighty and overwrought unless applied to\r\nsubjects of an elevated or heroic character. In Germany and England the\r\ndesire to understand clearly the dramatic movement led to the retention\r\nof dialogue in all operas. In France a distinction was made between\r\noperas with dialogue and operas with recitative only. The first is\r\ncalled Opéra Comique, originally an offshoot from the Italian _Opera\r\nBuffa_, in which the _recitativo secco_ was replaced by dialogue. Later\r\nthe term assumed a technical meaning by which it was applied to all\r\noperas containing spoken dialogue whether their subjects were comic or\r\ntragic, in contradistinction to what is known as Grand Opéra, in which\r\nthe accompanied recitative is used exclusively.\r\n\r\n=The Melodrama=.—The so-called melodrama is a compromise between the\r\ndialogue and the recitative. In this the performer recites in the\r\nspeaking voice while the orchestra supplies an accompaniment which\r\nseeks to intensify the dramatic situation. This device originated in\r\nGermany and has found the most favor from German composers. It was\r\nfirst employed by =Georg Benda= (1721-1795) in a recitation, _Ariadne\r\nin Naxos_ (1744), which created much interest. Two of the most striking\r\ninstances of the melodrama are to be found in the grave-digging scene\r\nin _Fidelio_ and in the incantation scene in _Der Freischütz_. But\r\nhowever effective its occasional use may be, the ear suffers from the\r\ninevitable dissonance between the fixed pitches of the musical scale\r\nand the natural inflections of the speaking voice. This is now so\r\ngenerally recognized that it has been practically ignored by modern\r\ncomposers in their works for the stage.\r\n\r\n=Spohr and the Romantic Opera=.—=Ludwig Spohr= (1784-1859), Germany’s\r\ngreatest violinist and a composer of eminence in many fields, wrote\r\na number of operas. Of these, _Faust_ and _Jessonda_ stand first\r\nin showing a vein of genuine romanticism, albeit they lack the\r\nFolk-element which brought Weber’s music so close to the hearts\r\nof the people. Full of beauty as they undoubtedly are, like all\r\nof Spohr’s music they are weakened by the constant recurrence of\r\ncertain mannerisms, such as chromatic progressions of a persistent\r\ntype, enharmonic modulations, the over-frequent use of diminished\r\nintervals. Spohr exercised a strong influence in favor of the new\r\ndirection on account of his high position as the most esteemed composer\r\nand performer of the day. His significance in the romantic movement\r\nconsists in his being, as it were, an intermediary between the late\r\nclassical period represented by Beethoven and the modern music drama.\r\nHe knew Beethoven in Vienna, and in his latter days, when director of\r\nthe opera in Cassel, did his utmost to introduce Wagner’s early operas\r\nto the German public.\r\n\r\n=Marschner, Weber’s Successor=.—Weber’s legitimate successor in the\r\nromantic opera was =Heinrich Marschner= (1795-1861). He had been\r\nassociated with Weber as assistant conductor at the opera in Dresden,\r\nand a strong friendship existed between them. Weber’s influence,\r\nhowever, was wide and far-reaching; it extended beyond the opera.\r\nMarschner’s sphere was practically confined to the stage, which he\r\nenriched with a series of strongly characterized works mainly of a\r\ngloomy, uncanny nature. He shows but little of the genial art with\r\nwhich Weber avails himself of the supernatural merely as a background\r\nfor the doing and striving of his characters, and thus never\r\ncompromises the human interest they have for us. Marschner makes it the\r\nsalient characteristic of his strongest works. In these his principal\r\n_Dramatis Personæ_ are demons and evil spirits who tempt and torment\r\nthe innocent and loving. His first romantic opera was _Der Vampyr_\r\n(1825) composed to a text prepared from Byron’s poem, “Lord Ruthven,”\r\nwhich is founded upon a Scotch legend. Notwithstanding the repulsive\r\nnature of the subject, its powerful treatment brought it immediate\r\nsuccess in Germany and a little later in England. It was followed by\r\n_Der Templar und die Jüdin_ (The Templar and the Jewess), a version\r\nof Scott’s “Ivanhoe.” This, however, met with less success than _Der\r\nVampyr_ or its successor, _Hans Heiling_, Marschner’s masterpiece.\r\n\r\n=The Spieloper=.—The Romantic school had a strong influence in the\r\ndevelopment of a form known as the _Spieloper_ (literally play-opera),\r\nwhich occupies a place between the works we have been considering and\r\nthe _Singspiel_. As thoroughly German as the latter, it shows more\r\nfinish and greater elaboration of musical effect. Though essentially\r\nromantic in the freedom of its scope and choice of means, its real\r\nsphere is neither the heroic nor the mystic; it concerns itself rather\r\nwith the lighter aspects of life, those which require no exalted powers\r\nof imagination or wide culture to appreciate—humor, good cheer, the\r\nmerriment and mirth of the people in holiday mood. =Albert Lortzing=\r\n(1803-1851) is accepted as the creator of this type, of which his most\r\npopular opera, _Zar und Zimmermann_ (Czar and the Carpenter), is the\r\nbest known example.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Romantic Opera=.—The value of the application of\r\nall the resources of music to the unfettered delineation of feeling\r\nand emotion in all their phases inaugurated by the romantic opera\r\ncan hardly be over-estimated. From the opera it has won its way into\r\nabsolute music, creating new and original forms. The change it has\r\nwrought in the progress and development of the art in general is only\r\nsecond to the revolution occasioned by the birth of the opera itself,\r\nthree centuries ago. The impulse of the romantic movement in music\r\nis far from being exhausted at the present day. On the contrary, it\r\nseems to have gathered strength and if it has reached its culmination,\r\nas some would have us believe, the signs are not yet apparent to an\r\nunprejudiced observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Romantic Movement?

Not that this is the\r\nonly difference. The Grand Opéra is naturally adapted to subjects of\r\na large or heroic scope; the Opéra Comique, like the _Spieloper_ in\r\nGermany, to lighter episodes of a romantic or humorous nature. As will\r\nbe seen, however, it not infrequently happens that the latter form is\r\nadopted for serious subjects, owing to the fact that it is generally\r\neasier for a composer to find acceptance at the Opéra Comique than\r\nat the Grand Opéra. The youthful composer or the one who has not yet\r\nacquired a name for himself is expected to win his spurs in the former\r\nbefore attempting to enter the latter. Hence, even if his work is\r\nsomber or tragic in character he often finds it advisable to cast it\r\ninto the lighter form for the sake of having it produced.\r\n\r\n=The Opéra Comique=.—The Opéra Comique had its origin in the\r\nintroduction of the Opéra Buffa in Paris by an Italian company about\r\nthe middle of the 18th century, which led to the Gluck-Piccini\r\ncontroversy. Pergolesi’s _La Serva Padrona_ in particular awakened\r\ngreat admiration and brought about the creation of a similar type of\r\nFrench opera. It was at first hardly more than an elaboration of the\r\nalready existing vaudeville, or play with songs. =François Philidor=\r\n(1726-1795) and =Andre Grétry= (1741-1813) were its founders. Grace\r\nand simplicity, scrupulous adaptation of the music to the clearness\r\nof diction always demanded by French taste were its distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n=Its Development=.—=Étienne Méhul= (1763-1817), a pupil of Gluck,\r\ngave it a larger musical development and a greater depth of dramatic\r\nfeeling. His _Joseph_ (1807), founded on Biblical history, is a classic\r\nof this school. Its dignity, its severe and noble style won less\r\ncordial recognition in France than in Germany; a generation later it\r\nwas to exercise a decisive influence on the future creator of the music\r\ndrama. It was through a performance of _Joseph_ that Richard Wagner,\r\nthen director of the opera in Riga, first felt inspired to battle\r\nagainst the empty conventionalities of the operatic stage. Méhul’s\r\nenlargement of the Opéra Comique was carried on by Cherubini, who\r\nthrough the ill-will of Napoleon found the doors of the Académie de\r\nMusique, the technical title of the Grand Opéra, closed against him.\r\nEven his greatest tragic opera, _Medée_ (Medea), was produced (1797) as\r\nan opéra comique without recitative and ballet, the latter being also\r\nreserved exclusively for Grand Opéra. Thus it often happened that there\r\nwas little, in many cases no intrinsic difference between the music of\r\nthe two schools.\r\n\r\n=The Typical Opéra Comique=.—There was, on the other hand, a\r\ndevelopment of a type more closely corresponding to the original scheme\r\nof the Opéra Comique. Strongly influenced by the romantic tendencies\r\nof the day, its romanticism by no means resembles that of the German\r\nschool as represented by Weber and his followers. This, in its appeal\r\nto the deeper emotions by the idealization of nature and recourse\r\nto the supernatural, is thoroughly alien to the Gallic temperament,\r\nand had no appreciable effect on French composers. Gaiety and humor,\r\nfreshness of invention, lightness of touch, elegance and finish\r\ncharacterize the true Opéra Comique. Its pathos never sinks below\r\na certain sentiment which is skilfully used rather for the sake of\r\ncontrast than from any persistent attempt at awakening the more somber\r\nfeelings. The singer and the actor both meet with consideration; the\r\nformer by sparkling melodies, expressive and grateful to sing, not\r\nover-burdened with the technical difficulties in which the Italian\r\nschool abounds; the latter by a drama furnishing piquant situations,\r\nseasoned with wit and interesting in itself as a play.\r\n\r\n=Boieldieu, its Founder=.—As Méhul gave the impulse to the graver,\r\nmore dignified style, so =François Boieldieu= (1775-1834) laid the\r\nfoundation of the typical Opéra Comique, the most original and\r\nessentially national French operatic form. His _Jean de Paris_ (John of\r\nParis) and _La Dame Blanche_ (The White Lady) placed him at the head of\r\nthis school. The latter in particular, based on a curious combination\r\nof situations taken from two of Scott’s novels, “The Monastery” and\r\n“Guy Mannering,” has been sung the world over and still remains an\r\nunsurpassed example of the Opéra Comique in its best estate.\r\n\r\n=Auber=.—The most prolific composer in this style was =Daniel Auber=\r\n(1782-1871). Though he began as an amateur and after years spent\r\nin other pursuits, he outlived all his early contemporaries and\r\nbecame its most widely known representative. With one exception,\r\nto be noticed later, his works reveal the salient characteristics\r\nof the school—freshness and melodic charm, finesse of rhythm and\r\ninstrumentation, delicacy and refinement rather than power and depth.\r\nHis most popular opera, _Fra Diavolo_ (1830), has been sung on all\r\nstages and in almost all languages. Others less known but equally\r\nmeritorious are _Le Maçon_ (The Mason and the Locksmith), _Le Domino\r\nNoir_ (The Black Domino) and _Les Diamants de la Couronne_ (The Crown\r\nDiamonds.)\r\n\r\n=Hérold and Adam=.—=Louis Hérold= (1791-1833), as a pupil of Méhul,\r\ninclines to a more serious style. His _Zampa_ contains strongly\r\nromantic features which made it more successful in Germany than the\r\nmelodious _Le Pré aux Clercs_ (The Clerks’ Meadow—a noted duelling\r\nground in Paris during the 17th century), though in France this vies\r\nwith _La Dame Blanche_ in the distinction of being the most popular\r\nOpéra Comique in the repertory. Though less significant than any of the\r\nforegoing, =Adolphe Adam= (1803-1856), the composer of _Le Postillon\r\nde Longjumeau_ (The Postilion of Longjumeau), deserves mention for\r\nthe grace and fluency of his melodies, albeit they show a decline in\r\ncharacter and style which prefigures the decadent school of the _Opéra\r\nBouffe_ (burlesque opera).\r\n\r\n=Opéra Bouffe=.—The attentive observer can hardly fail to perceive that\r\nthe opera as appealing to the people at large more than any other form\r\nof music is peculiarly susceptible to social and political influences.\r\nThe Opéra Bouffe being a degenerate offshoot from the Opéra Comique,\r\nit is no mere accident that the period of its most extended popularity\r\ncoincided with the extravagance and folly of the Second Empire. As a\r\ndistinct type it is due to =Jacques Offenbach= (1819-1880), a German\r\nby birth, who took advantage of the taste of the time by turning his\r\nattention to the parody of the classical and mythological subjects\r\nwhich had furnished material for the early operas. Frivolous and\r\nmocking in text, sprightly and vivacious in melody and rhythm, his\r\noperettas possess undoubted piquancy and an effervescent style which\r\nfor a time intoxicated the public. Their vogue was happily broken by a\r\nseries of light operas of much more worth. Of these, _Les Cloches de\r\nCorneville_, known to Americans as “The Chimes of Normandy,” by =Robert\r\nPlanquette= (1840-1903) is the best example.\r\n\r\n=The Influence of the Opéra Comique=.—The Opéra Comique, as founded\r\nby Boieldieu and continued by Auber and Hérold, bears a distinctively\r\nnational character to a much greater degree than the more cosmopolitan\r\nGrand Opéra. Unlike this, its development was entirely due to native\r\ncomposers who gave it the thoroughly Gallic impress of spirit,\r\nvivacity, and truth to nature which carried it triumphantly through\r\nall the theatres of Europe. Thus it served to counteract in part\r\nthe reactionary tendency of Italian opera. In Paris, as elsewhere,\r\nduring the first quarter of the 19th century Italian influences\r\nwere very powerful; Rossini’s works and those of his imitators\r\nhad the undesirable effect of reviving in a modernized form the\r\nconventionalized opera of the 18th century, the chief object of which\r\nwas the display of the singer. The Opéra Comique, though limited to\r\nthe lighter phases of the drama, performed a service of no small value\r\nin upholding a standard of legitimate musical expression at a time when\r\nthe allurements of florid song were obscuring the dramatic ideals which\r\nGluck had established at the cost of so much labor and effort.\r\n\r\n=Grand Opéra=.—About the same time, important changes were impending\r\nin Grand Opéra, though these were more in the nature of a development\r\nfrom the type founded by Lully and afterward enlarged by Rameau,\r\nGluck and Spontini than a revolution such as Weber and his followers\r\nhad effected in Germany. They were, however, the outcome of the same\r\nromantic influences modified by the characteristic French adherence to\r\nestablished form. A grand opera according to tradition must have five\r\nacts, consisting of arias, ensembles, choruses, etc., connected by\r\nrecitatives, with a ballet in one or two of the middle acts, generally\r\nthe second and fourth.\r\n\r\n=Its Change of Style=.—Auber’s _La Muette de Portici_ (The Dumb Girl of\r\nPortici—known also as Masaniello), produced at the Académie de Musique\r\nin 1828, formed the point of departure for the new style. Though it\r\nheld to the traditional form of Grand Opéra, it was in spirit, theme\r\nand treatment a startling change from the ordinarily genial works of\r\nthis composer, characterized as it was by a force and fire, a vigor and\r\ndecision which he had never shown before and was never to show again.\r\nIt marks the beginning of the modern historical opera, the complete\r\nabandonment of classical and ancient history as the only appropriate\r\nmaterial for Grand Opéra. The people were brought upon the stage not as\r\nslaves or as meekly acquiescing in the will of those in authority, but\r\nas insurrectionists demanding rights of which they had been defrauded.\r\nThe story of the Neapolitan fisherman leading his comrades into\r\nrebellion against their tyrannical rulers had a powerful effect in the\r\nagitated state of political affairs which culminated in the revolutions\r\nof 1830. It is significant that a performance of _La Muette de Portici_\r\nimmediately preceded the riots in Brussels, which in that year resulted\r\nin the expulsion of the Dutch from Belgium. Rossini’s _William Tell_,\r\nwhich followed in 1829, manifested precisely the same tendencies,\r\nmusically as well as dramatically. Both were destined to be cast into\r\nthe shade by the works of a third composer who gave the French grand\r\nopera a style which practically dictated conditions on all stages for\r\nhalf a century and is still not without influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIACOMO MEYERBEER.]\r\n\r\n=Meyerbeer=.—This composer was =Giacomo Meyerbeer= (1791-1864), German\r\nby birth and early education, Italian by training in more mature years,\r\nand finally French by adoption. A juvenile pianist of great promise,\r\nhe studied with Clementi; he went through a severe course of fugue and\r\ncounterpoint with Zelter, the teacher of Mendelssohn; in composition\r\nhe was a fellow-student with Weber under the famous Abbé Vogler. In\r\nVienna he knew Beethoven and was advised by Salieri to study in Italy,\r\nwhere he wrote a number of Italian operas after the style of Rossini.\r\nIn 1826, he went to Paris, the Mecca of all opera composers, with the\r\ndesign of making himself familiar with the conditions of Grand Opéra.\r\n\r\n=His First Grand Opera=.—The result of his studies was _Robert le\r\nDiable_ (Robert the Devil) produced in 1831. This created a veritable\r\nsensation. Nothing of so comprehensive a style had been seen or heard\r\nbefore. Meyerbeer’s cosmopolitan education, his receptive rather than\r\noriginal mind, enabled him to combine the outward characteristics at\r\nleast of the three schools—French, German, Italian—as no one had ever\r\nattempted. The story of the arch-enemy of mankind seeking to ensnare a\r\nson by an earthly mother into sharing his lost condition, the struggle\r\nbetween the powers of good and evil for the mastery of the tempted\r\nsoul gave full scope to such an amalgamation of styles. The ballet\r\nand spectacular effects of Lully, the supernaturalism of Weber, the\r\nroulades of Rossini were all brought together with an art that dazzled\r\nand intoxicated an admiring public.\r\n\r\n=His Other Grand Operas=.—Five years later _Robert_ was followed\r\nby _Les Huguenots_ (The Huguenots), which achieved a still greater\r\nsuccess, and is the one opera of Meyerbeer which continues to hold\r\nits own against the encroachments of time. In one or two episodes of\r\n_Le Prophète_ (The Prophet), which was produced in 1849, the composer\r\nreached the highest level of his creative activity, notwithstanding the\r\nmanifest artificiality of his scheme. His last work, _L’Africaine_ (The\r\nAfrican), was brought out the year after his death and like the others\r\nowed its success to a skilful mingling of all the elements, musical,\r\nspectacular, and dramatic, which go to make up this type of opera. His\r\n_L’Étoile du Nord_ (Star of the North) and _Le Pardon de Ploërmel_\r\n(better known as Dinorah) were composed for the Opéra Comique.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Meyerbeer=.—Meyerbeer so held the public in his grip\r\nthat other composers of Grand Opéra gained but slight attention\r\nduring his lifetime. Only =Jacques Halévy= (1799-1862) was able to\r\nmeet him on equal terms in this field with _La Juive_ (The Jewess),\r\nin which he shows the earnest spirit of his master Cherubini. Though\r\nMeyerbeer’s watchword was success at any cost and his aim to assure\r\nit by the accumulation of cunningly devised sensations rather than\r\nthrough the innate power of his music, his works had a powerful and,\r\non the whole, a beneficial influence on the course of modern dramatic\r\nmusic. They placed living, palpitating beings on the stage instead\r\nof the cold abstractions of mythology and antiquity; the singer was\r\nforced to impersonate as well as to sing. His insistence on all means\r\nof expression—vocal, instrumental, and scenic—though often exaggerated\r\nand fatal to purity of style, led to an extension of technical ability\r\nin all these directions, and prepared the way for a master of greater\r\npower and higher aims. It must not be overlooked that Richard Wagner\r\nfrankly modeled his _Rienzi_ (1842) after _Les Huguenots_, and that\r\nMeyerbeer in _Le Prophète_ shows plainly the influence of this work by\r\nhis German contemporary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat two styles are found in French opera?\r\n\r\nTell about the origin of Opéra Comique.\r\n\r\nTell about the development of Opéra Comique.\r\n\r\nDescribe the typical opéra comique.\r\n\r\nMention the prominent composers in this form and their work.\r\n\r\nDescribe Opéra Bouffe.\r\n\r\nWhat composers were prominent in this form?\r\n\r\nWhat was the influence of the Opéra Comique?\r\n\r\nWhat was the established form of Grand Opéra?\r\n\r\nWho contributed to a change of style?

The highly ornamented style which he brought into\r\nvogue was modified in the works of several composers who also gave\r\nmore consideration to truth of expression. With these, melody still\r\nreigned supreme, but it was shorn of the excessive ornamentation which\r\noverloaded Rossini’s music; in character and rhythm it was also more\r\ngenerally in accord with sentiment and situation. The florid element\r\nwas by no means suppressed; it had been an integral factor in Italian\r\nmusic for two centuries and was too strongly entrenched in public favor\r\nto be banished so completely as it had been in the German romantic\r\nopera, but it was kept in subordination and in the main not allowed to\r\ndictate the melodic idea. This was a step in advance for the Italian\r\nschool of that period, which through the fluent warblings of Rossini\r\nand his imitators, had approached dangerously near the Scarlatti-Handel\r\ntype of the previous century.\r\n\r\n=Donizetti=.—This reaction in the direction of greater simplicity\r\nand sincerity was led by =Gaetano Donizetti= (1797-1848). At first a\r\nfollower of Rossini, he only attained success after the latter had\r\nceased composing and he himself had acquired a style of his own.\r\nDonizetti was not without innate force, but his great melodic facility\r\nled him to rely upon melody rather than upon musical development\r\nor dramatic characterization. Hence his tragic operas, though\r\noften admirable in detail, lack the sustained strength demanded by\r\ntheir subjects. Of these, _Lucia_ (founded upon Scott’s “Bride of\r\nLammermoor”) achieved the greatest popularity, while in _La Favorita_\r\n(composed for the Grand Opéra) he shows more dramatic power than in any\r\nof his more than three-score operas. In many of his lighter works he\r\nis particularly happy; for example, in _Don Pasquale_, which compares\r\nfavorably with Rossini’s _Il Barbiere_, and in _L’Elisire d’Amore_\r\n(The Elixir of Love). _La Fille du Régiment_ (The Daughter of the\r\nRegiment—written for the Opéra Comique) has made the tour of the world.\r\n\r\n=Bellini=.—His younger contemporary, =Vincenzo Bellini= (1801-1835),\r\non the contrary, displays no capacity for humor nor is he much better\r\nfitted to cope with the somber or the heroic. Essentially a lyrical\r\ntemperament, neither broad nor deep but endowed with exquisite\r\nsensibility within certain limits, his sphere is the emotional, the\r\ntender and the elegiac. For this reason his charming opera, _La\r\nSonnambula_ (The Somnambulist), on account of its idyllic subject, is a\r\nmore representative work than _Norma_ or _I Puritani_ (The Puritans),\r\nthough both enjoyed high popularity until within recent years. Much of\r\nBellini’s vogue was due to the admirable singing of a number of Italian\r\nartists who were identified with his works—Pasta, Grisi, sopranos;\r\nMario, tenor; Tamburini, baritone; Lablache, basso, not to forget\r\nJenny Lind, who was at her best in his operas. With their passing and\r\nthe establishment of the modern school of dramatic composition, in\r\nwhich the voice is only one of many factors instead of being the chief\r\nelement of expression, they have gradually dropped from the repertory.\r\n\r\n=Verdi=.—A far more significant personality than either Donizetti\r\nor Bellini is =Giuseppe Verdi= (1813-1901). Not merely a melodist\r\nbut a dramatist as well, his long life gave him the opportunity of\r\nprofiting by the many influences which brought about the mighty musical\r\ndevelopment of the last hundred years. The fact that he did so without\r\ncompromising his artistic or national individuality shows the inherent\r\ngenius which gives to him the distinction of being the great Italian\r\ncomposer of the century. Strong and sturdy from the first, his early\r\nworks, if somewhat coarse in fiber, seemed doubly powerful in contrast\r\nwith those of his contemporaries, which were distinguished by sweetness\r\nand melody rather than by depth or vigor. From _Ernani_ to _Rigoletto_,\r\nfrom the much sung _Trovatore_ to _Don Carlos_, to mention only a few\r\nof his thirty operas, Verdi shows a steady growth in largeness of\r\nstyle and command of means which culminated in _Aïda_, written for the\r\nKhedive of Egypt to celebrate the opening of the Suez canal in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIUSEPPE VERDI.]\r\n\r\n=Aïda=.—_Aïda_ is the full fruition of the Romantic movement beyond the\r\nAlps, manifested, however, in a style and manner thoroughly Italian.\r\nUnmistakably influenced by the uncompromising stand taken in Germany\r\nby Wagner, Verdi here shows the definite adoption of a new standard,\r\nyet by methods which make no decided break with what he had hitherto\r\naccomplished. In form, _Aïda_ is closely allied to the Meyerbeer type\r\nof Grand Opéra through its succession of dramatic and spectacular\r\nfeatures, but these develop naturally in the course of the action\r\nand are combined with a sincerity and unity of effect lacking in the\r\nmore artificial creations of the German composer. The florid style\r\nis strictly avoided; without the continuous flow of the music drama,\r\nthe different movements, recitatives, arias, ensembles, etc., are yet\r\nmore closely connected and are sustained by a richer, more fluent\r\norchestration than he had hitherto given to his operas, the local color\r\ncalled for by the Egyptian theme receiving adequate consideration.\r\n\r\n=Significance of Aïda=.—_Aïda_ marks the beginning of the new Italian\r\nschool, one more in sympathy with the original conception of the opera\r\nas a drama, while retaining the characteristic Italian grace and\r\ncharm of vocal treatment. This school was still further enlarged and\r\ndeveloped by Verdi, but this extension belongs to a later period and\r\nwill be considered in its logical connection.\r\n\r\n=Wagner and the Music Drama=.—It is to =Richard Wagner= (1813-1883)\r\nthat we owe the renaissance in modern form of the primitive ideal of\r\nthe opera as embodied in the works of Peri and Caccini. Simple and\r\nformless as these now appear, they contain the germ of all that he\r\nhas accomplished, apart from the question of means, even to the very\r\nname of music drama. This he revived because, in his opinion, the term\r\nopera had acquired a preponderantly musical signification which made it\r\ninappropriate for his later works in view of their dramatic character.\r\nAn exception to the general rule of precocity among musicians, it was\r\nnot until his sixteenth year that he resolved to devote himself to\r\nmusic. Like Weber, whom as a child he saw frequently and regarded with\r\nthe utmost reverence, his early associations were with the theatre and\r\nthe drama, a fact of no small significance in the careers of both. _Der\r\nFreischütz_ was his favorite opera, a liking which bore abundant fruit\r\nin later years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAGNER IN 1853.]\r\n\r\n=His Early Operas=.—The future master of the music drama, however,\r\nbegan by composing operas—operas, moreover, in which he shows\r\noriginality in one feature only—that of writing their texts himself,\r\nand this remained his invariable practice. In other respects they gave\r\nno hint of the startling individuality he was to unfold so unexpectedly\r\nin his _Flying Dutchman_. His first opera was _Die Feen_ (The Fairies).\r\nIt was based on a fairy tale of but slight worth, and the music was\r\nstrongly reminiscent of Weber and Marschner. As the work of a youth\r\nof twenty, without reputation or influence, it is hardly surprising\r\nthat he found no manager willing to produce it. He was somewhat more\r\nfortunate with his second opera, _Das Liebesverbot_ (The Love Veto), an\r\nadaptation of Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure.” This was performed\r\nonce, in 1836, at Magdeburg, where he was director of the opera, and\r\nhad thus come under the influence of the French and Italian composers\r\nthen popular in Germany. The music is such a palpable imitation of\r\nAdam, Auber, Donizetti, and Bellini that it has never been given since.\r\n_Die Feen_ was never produced during his lifetime, but a few years\r\nafter his death received a number of representations in Munich.\r\n\r\n=His Sojourn in Paris=.—In 1839, he determined to go to Paris. Many\r\nforeign composers had succeeded in entering the Grand Opéra, among\r\nthem Meyerbeer, then in the full flush of the renown he had gained\r\nwith _Les Huguenots_. What one German had done, another might attempt.\r\nAccordingly, with the utmost faith in his star and amid manifold\r\ndiscouragements, Wagner made his way to the French capital, where he\r\nhoped through the influence of Meyerbeer to secure the acceptance of\r\nhis _Rienzi_ at the Grand Opéra. He had prepared it from Bulwer’s\r\nnovel of the same name with the express intention of utilizing it as a\r\nframework for the large spectacular style demanded by the Académie de\r\nMusique. His sojourn in Paris brought him nothing but disappointment.\r\nNeither _Rienzi_ nor _Der Fliegende Holländer_ (The Flying Dutchman),\r\nwhich he wrote during his stay of two and a half years, was successful\r\nin winning a hearing, while he lived the greater part of the time in\r\nthe most painfully straitened circumstances.\r\n\r\n=Rienzi=.—Before long, he realized the hopelessness of his endeavor\r\nand sent _Rienzi_ to Dresden, where it was accepted and after a long\r\ndelay performed in 1842. The result was a triumphant success and led\r\nto the speedy production of _The Flying Dutchman_. This, however, by\r\nno means made a similar impression. _Rienzi_ was an opera of the type\r\nmade familiar by Meyerbeer, in which effect was secured by the heaping\r\ntogether of every device known to stagecraft. The ballet, the march of\r\nthe Messengers of Peace, the final catastrophe of the burning of Rome,\r\nhad as much to do with its enthusiastic reception as the music, which\r\nwas noisy, showy and brilliant, as befitted a work of such calibre.\r\n\r\n=The Flying Dutchman. Change of Style=.—_The Flying Dutchman_, however,\r\nshowed Wagner in an entirely different light. With it, instead of\r\nreceiving his inspiration from without, as had been the case with\r\nthe preceding operas, it came from within. On his way to Paris he\r\nhad made a stormy voyage of several weeks from a port on the Baltic\r\nto London. He was familiar with the myth of the Flying Dutchman, and\r\nfound that the sailors on board his ship believed it implicitly. This\r\nin connection with Heine’s version of the legend, which represents the\r\nunhappy mariner as doomed to perpetual wandering on stormy seas until\r\nhe finds a woman faithful unto death, made a strong impression on him,\r\nand while in Paris he wrote the poem and composed the music within\r\nseven weeks after finishing _Rienzi_. A more sudden metamorphosis of\r\nstyle is unknown in the history of music. The earlier work was an opera\r\npure and simple, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, characterized\r\nby pomp, brilliancy, sonority. Its successor was conceived as a\r\ndrama in which music served to emphasize the action and to intensify\r\nthe emotional situations; instead of being master, it was servant;\r\nexternal effects were disregarded save only as they were in harmony\r\nwith this conception. Not that the composer entirely achieved this\r\nideal; _The Flying Dutchman_ displays not a few lapses into operatic\r\nconventionalities, but as a whole it was a startling and radical change\r\nwhich puzzled and displeased the public. They had looked for something\r\nin the style of _Rienzi_ and could make nothing of a work so contrary\r\nto the popular idea of what an opera should be. Accordingly, after a\r\nfew performances, it was dropped from the repertory.\r\n\r\n=Tannhäuser=.—Nothing daunted by the lack of favor shown his change of\r\nstyle, Wagner carried it to a still greater extent in his next opera,\r\n_Tannhäuser_ (1845), founded on a medieval legend. The dramatic motive\r\nof this is much the same as that of _The Flying Dutchman_, one of which\r\nWagner was particularly fond—the power of love to redeem and save from\r\nthe consequences of sin and error. _Tannhäuser_ brought about his head\r\nthe full storm of hostile criticism which with _The Flying Dutchman_\r\nhad only begun to lower. He was reproached for its difficulty, for\r\nits lack of pleasing melodies, for the audacious harmonies which many\r\ncritics considered inexcusable dissonances. Singers objected to the\r\nbroad declamation it required; they complained that it would eventually\r\nruin their voices.\r\n\r\n=Lohengrin=.—This almost general dissatisfaction, however, led to no\r\nconcessions by the composer in his next opera, _Lohengrin_, which\r\nmarked a further advance in the unpopular direction taken by its\r\npredecessors, but it interfered with its performance. Though he was\r\nconductor of the Opéra at Dresden, he could not secure permission to\r\nproduce it. Baffled and discouraged in his artistic schemes, a radical\r\nin politics, he joined the insurrectionists during the revolution of\r\n1849. The failure of the rebellion necessitated a hasty flight from\r\nGermany. He took refuge in Switzerland and remained in exile until a\r\nproclamation of amnesty in 1861 allowed him to return. In the meantime\r\nhe had sent the score of _Lohengrin_ to Liszt, then conductor of the\r\nopera at Weimar, and there it was brought out in 1850.\r\n\r\n_Lohengrin_ proved the turning-point in his fortunes. The romance of\r\nthe subject, its dramatic treatment and undeniable beauty gradually\r\nreconciled the public to the novelty of its style. Before Wagner was\r\nrelieved from his sentence of banishment it had become one of the most\r\npopular operas in Germany—he once ruefully remarked that he would soon\r\nbe the only German who had not heard it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho led in the changes in Italian Opera after Rossini?\r\n\r\nGive an account of Donizetti and his work.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Bellini and his work.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Verdi and his earlier works.\r\n\r\nWhat is the significance of Aïda in the history of Opera?\r\n\r\nTell about the changes that Wagner was to make.\r\n\r\nGive an account of his early operas.\r\n\r\nWhy did he go to Paris?\r\n\r\nDescribe Rienzi, The Flying Dutchman, Tannhäuser, Lohengrin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON XL.\r\n\r\n             RICHARD WAGNER’S MUSIC DRAMAS. OTHER SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wagner’s Theory of the Music Drama=.—_Lohengrin_, like _The Flying\r\nDutchman_, was transitional in character and led into Wagner’s third\r\nmanner. It was his last opera; all his later works were known as music\r\ndramas. In these he pursued unhesitatingly the logical conclusions of\r\nthe theories which he expounded at great length in his controversial\r\nwritings, though he was far from being always consistent with himself.\r\nThus he reasoned that since in the spoken drama but one speaker is\r\nheard at a time, the same practice should prevail in the music drama,\r\nwhich would naturally do away with all concerted music, choruses,\r\netc. This rule he observed in _The Ring of the Nibelungen_, but he\r\nwisely abandoned it in his later works. In _Die Meistersinger_ he also\r\nfailed to follow his theory that mythical and legendary subjects were\r\nthe only suitable material for the music drama. Briefly stated, his\r\nultimate conclusion was as follows: that the art-work of the future,\r\nas he called it, should consist of a synthesis of all the arts. Music,\r\npoetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, he asserted, had exhausted\r\nall that was possible to them as separate arts; a higher plane could\r\nbe reached hereafter only by a combination which should gain unity by\r\nsubordination to a single principle. This principle he found in poetry.\r\nBeethoven, he argued, had felt the insufficiency of music alone to\r\nexpress his deepest inspiration, and for that reason had incorporated\r\nin his last and greatest symphony a choral movement to the words of\r\nSchiller’s “Ode to Joy.” In the music drama, therefore, the scene\r\npainter replaces the artist and the architect, the actor by plastic\r\nposes the sculptor, while the musician must allow his music no form\r\nbut that dictated by the poet in his verses. He ascribed the thrilling\r\neffect of the Greek drama to such a union of the arts and this it was\r\nhis aim to revive through his own works.\r\n\r\n=The Leading Motive=.—The part assigned by the Greek dramatists to the\r\nchorus who expounded and commented on the events of the play was in\r\nhis scheme transferred to the orchestra. This he did by means of the\r\n_Leitmotiv_ (leading motive). A leitmotiv is a characteristic theme or\r\nharmonic progression associated with each of the _Dramatis Personæ_ and\r\nwhich appears with such modification of mode, rhythm, or any of its\r\ncomponent parts as the dramatic situation demands. It is not confined\r\nto personages alone; in _The Ring of the Nibelung_, for instance,\r\nthe stolen gold, the ring formed from it, the sword which plays such\r\nan important part in _Die Walküre_ and in _Siegfried_ all have their\r\ncorresponding motives. It is through these motives that Wagner is\r\nable to give his orchestra an all but articulate speech and to weld\r\nthe music drama into an organic whole. By their transformation and\r\ndevelopment he succeeds in indicating psychological states and changes\r\nas well as material conditions and objects. Reminiscent themes of a\r\nsomewhat similar nature had been used as far back as Mozart and had\r\nbeen employed more freely by composers of the Romantic school, notably\r\nby Weber in _Der Freischütz_ and _Euryanthe_, but they were undeveloped\r\nand elementary in character. Berlioz in his _Fantastic Symphony_ was\r\nthe first to conceive a typical theme and to alter it in logical\r\naccordance with the progression of his program, but he did not adopt\r\nthe practice in his operas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILHELM RICHARD WAGNER.]\r\n\r\n=The Unending Melody=.—Beginning with _Lohengrin_, Wagner abandoned\r\nfixed forms and substituted what he called unending melody, a\r\npractically continuous flow of tone divided alike between voices and\r\ninstruments. For the most part he assigned the singer a declamation\r\nas far removed from the set aria on the one hand as it was from dry\r\nrecitative of the early Italian opera on the other. Yet like the latter\r\nit was conditioned by principles of speech. Like the early composers,\r\nalso, his subjects with but two exceptions were mythical or legendary.\r\nThis, because the supernatural and the unreal correspond more closely\r\nwith the ideal element introduced by the use of song for speech than\r\nmaterial drawn from everyday experience or from the exact chronicles of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n=The Ring of the Nibelung=.—In the old Teutonic folk-epic, the\r\n_Nibelungen Lied_ (Lay of the Nibelung), Wagner found the inspiration\r\nfor his next and most extended work. This is the great tetralogy, _Der\r\nRing des Nibelung_ (The Ring of the Nibelung), composed of four dramas\r\ndesigned for continuous representation: _Das Rheingold_ (The Rhine\r\nGold), _Die Walküre_ (The Valkyrie), _Siegfried_, _Die Götterdämmerung_\r\n(The Twilight of the Gods). It was begun and partially finished during\r\nhis stay in Switzerland, but his discouragement over what he felt to be\r\nthe hopeless task of ever securing its performance led him to abandon\r\nit and to set to work on another drama which he decided should be\r\nlighter in character and less difficult to execute, in order the more\r\nreadily to find acceptance.\r\n\r\n=Tristan and Isolde=.—The result of this resolution was _Tristan und\r\nIsolde_, but far from being a return to his earlier style, as he had\r\nplanned, it was and probably still is the most intricate operatic\r\nscore in existence. It was accepted by the Opera in Vienna, but after\r\nfifty-seven rehearsals the singers declared themselves unable to\r\nlearn it and it was given up as impossible of execution. Three years\r\nafter his return to Germany an unlooked-for change took place in his\r\nfortunes. The young king of Bavaria, Ludwig II, who had just ascended\r\nthe throne, had been an ardent admirer of Wagner since as a boy of\r\nfifteen he had heard _Lohengrin_. Hardly had he taken his seat before\r\nhe summoned the discouraged composer to Munich and assured him support\r\nand protection. _Tristan und Isolde_ was soon brought out (1865), and\r\nWagner busied himself with the composition of _Die Meistersinger von\r\nNürnberg_ (The Master Singers of Nuremberg), produced in 1868.\r\n\r\n=Die Meistersinger=.—This is his only comic work, full of hitherto\r\nunsuspected humor and geniality. The story of the young poet\r\nendeavoring to gain admission to the jealously-guarded ranks of the\r\nmaster singers who, notwithstanding the beauty of his song, reject\r\nhim because he has violated their hide-bound rules has a distinctly\r\nautobiographic value. Wagner had endured too much from similar pedants\r\nto be lenient with the picture he drew of their prototypes in medieval\r\nNuremberg. As strikingly diatonic in style as _Tristan und Isolde_\r\nis chromatic, these two works are the strongest illustrations of his\r\nversatility.\r\n\r\n=Bayreuth and the Festival Theatre=.—Wagner had long cherished the\r\nplan of a festival theatre for the performance of his _Ring of the\r\nNibelung_. Jealousy of his favor with the king led to various intrigues\r\nwhich prevented the building of such a theatre in Munich. The quiet\r\ntown of Bayreuth, therefore, as being a central point, was chosen, and\r\nthere in 1876 the _Festspielhaus_ was opened with the first complete\r\nperformance of the Tetralogy. It made a profound impression, but the\r\nexpense of the undertaking was so great that it resulted in a heavy\r\nloss and the theatre was closed for a number of years. In 1882,\r\nhowever, it reopened with _Parsifal_ and since then its triumphant\r\ncareer has been part of musical history.\r\n\r\n=Parsifal=.—Until 1903, when it was given in this country, _Parsifal_\r\nwas heard only in Bayreuth. Its semi-sacred character, its mingling\r\nof religious mysticism and sorcery, its unrivaled stage effects, its\r\noverwhelming power of climax, the consummate art of its thematic\r\nconstruction have made it the most discussed of Wagner’s works. What\r\nplace it may eventually hold in respect to the others can be decided\r\nonly by time. As it is, it stands alone; a second _Parsifal_ is hardly\r\nconceivable.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Wagner=.—Unlike Weber, Wagner did not create a school—he\r\nbelonged to the school which Weber founded. Like Gluck, his influence\r\npermeated all schools but to a much greater extent; none has succeeded\r\nin escaping it. Thus far in Germany it has been felt more in the\r\ndevelopment of program music, the symphonic poem, etc., than in the\r\nmusic drama itself. Many have attempted to follow directly in his\r\nsteps, among them =August Bungert= (1846———) with a cycle of music\r\ndramas, _Die Homerische Welt_ (The World of Homer), founded upon\r\nthe Iliad and the Odyssey, and =Richard Strauss= (1864———) with his\r\n_Guntram_, _Feuersnoth_ (Fire Famine) and _Salome_, but none has yet\r\nshown the power to bend the bow of Achilles. =Engelbert Humperdinck=\r\n(1854———) is the only one of Wagner’s successors to develop a new phase\r\nof the music drama. This he did by applying it to the fairy tale in his\r\n_Hänsel und Gretel_ (1893), which soon found its way to all stages, the\r\nfirst German opera to have such a success since the death of Wagner.\r\n\r\n=Wagner in France=.—In France, Wagner acted at first not so much\r\ndirectly as indirectly, and more in his connection with the Romantic\r\nschool of Weber than through his individual style as revealed in the\r\nmusic drama. The characteristic conservatism of the French school was\r\nshown in holding to forms which had been fixed for generations, but\r\nlittle by little these were filled with the new romantic spirit. This\r\ncomes to the fore in =Charles Gounod= (1818-1893), whose _Faust_ (1859)\r\nhas exercised a strong and lasting influence on the lyric drama in\r\nFrance. Though set forms are not abandoned, they are closely joined by\r\na melodious declamation which approaches the song-speech of Wagner; the\r\norchestration, too, is unmistakably romantic in treatment. =Georges\r\nBizet= (1838-1875) in _Carmen_ (1875), an opéra comique notwithstanding\r\nits tragic denouement, produced a work of great individuality, which\r\nshows even more plainly the influence of modern romanticism. Had the\r\ncomposer’s career not been cut short by his untimely death, it is\r\npossible that the French school would have maintained a more commanding\r\nposition. For Paris no longer holds her former preëminence as operatic\r\ncentre; she has been distanced by Bayreuth. Of late years the works\r\nthat have had the most pronounced success in the French capital have\r\nbeen Wagner’s music dramas. A little more than a generation ago, in\r\nthe palmy days of Auber and Meyerbeer, a success at the Grand Opéra\r\nor the Opéra Comique had an international import and meant a speedy\r\ntransference to foreign stages. Now the interest is largely local;\r\nbut few of the modern French operas are heard outside of France. The\r\ninfluence of Wagner is evident in a new French school, consisting in\r\nthe main of young composers whose works manifest strongly transitional\r\nfeatures. At present this school is in its storm and stress period; it\r\nis yet too early to forecast its ultimate effect.\r\n\r\n=Wagner in Italy=.—Italy proved more responsive to Wagner’s influence\r\nthan France. The performance of _Lohengrin_ (1868), in Bologna, created\r\nmuch enthusiasm among the young musicians of northern Italy, but it was\r\nthe septuagenarian Verdi who inaugurated the era of the music drama\r\nby his _Otello_ (1887) and _Falstaff_ (1893). Strictly speaking, he\r\nhad been anticipated by =Arrigo Boïto= (1842———), who, thrown under\r\nWagner’s influence in Germany, had followed his example in being the\r\npoet and composer alike of _Mefistofele_ (1868), a version of the Faust\r\nlegend. But this was Boïto’s only opera, and though he gave the initial\r\nimpulse to the movement, it was Verdi who carried it to a triumphant\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n=Verdi’s Latest Style=.—_Aïda_ had been a grand opera with strong\r\nmusico-dramatic tendencies. In _Otello_ and _Falstaff_, Verdi made\r\na definite entrance into the music drama. The latter in particular,\r\nfounded on Shakespeare’s “Merry Wives of Windsor,” is an astonishing\r\n_tour de force_ for a man of four-score years. Full of the sparkle\r\nand freshness of youth, yet in every measure revealing the ripeness\r\nof matured genius, it is one of an immortal trio of lyric comedies of\r\nwhich the others are Mozart’s _Figaro_ and Wagner’s _Meistersinger_.\r\nThe set and traditional forms of the opera here disappear entirely; the\r\nmusic is conditioned by the text and its dramatic requirements; the\r\norchestra supports the voices in a full, melodious, and comprehensive\r\nflow, but never overpowers them. Hardly anything can be detached from\r\nits context without losing significance and interest; and this, by the\r\nway, is one of the most distinctive peculiarities of the music drama\r\nand more than anything else points the radical difference between it\r\nand the opera. Yet though this change of manner is undoubtedly due to\r\nWagner, Verdi is in no sense an imitator. The style remains his own and\r\nis essentially Italian in character—that is, it is based upon vocal\r\nrather than instrumental capabilities.\r\n\r\n=The New Italian School=.—The latest development of the music drama in\r\nItaly has been in the direction of so-called naturalism. This consists\r\nin the choice of brutal phases of life for illustration, told in\r\nshort, concise forms which concentrate and hasten the dramatic action.\r\nA greater contrast to the inordinately long and heroic operas of\r\nMeyerbeer and Wagner can hardly be imagined; it is more than probable,\r\nindeed, that the reaction against the excessive length of the music\r\ndrama led to the great and sudden vogue of this school. The first\r\nimpulse to naturalism was given by =Pietro Mascagni= (1863———) in his\r\ntwo-act opera, _Cavalleria Rusticana_ (Rustic Chivalry), in 1890.\r\nThis is a tale of love, jealousy, and revenge told in music admirably\r\nadapted to the vivid, crude representation of elemental passions.\r\nTwo years later followed _I Pagliacci_ (The Clowns) by =Ruggiero\r\nLeoncavallo= (1858———), a work of precisely the same character. Though\r\nmany others have essayed the same style, these two thus far remain\r\nthe most representative of their class. Their popularity has been\r\napproached only by =Giacomo Puccini= (1858———) in _La Bohême_ (The\r\nBohemians), produced in 1896. Four years later his _Tosca_ appeared and\r\ndid much to strengthen the impression given by its predecessor—that in\r\nPuccini Italy possesses her most promising dramatic composer.\r\n\r\n=Schools Compared=.—Thus at the beginning of the 20th century we find\r\nthe principles of the music drama as enunciated by Wagner influencing\r\nall the three great schools of dramatic composition. It is worthy of\r\nnote, however, that these schools, though thus approaching in artistic\r\nideals, still retain the characteristics which distinguished them\r\nfrom the very beginning: the Italian, melody and beauty of tone; the\r\nFrench, clearness of form and logical dramatic development; the German,\r\nelevation of subject and harmonic richness.\r\n\r\n=Younger Schools=.—Younger schools having a strongly national character\r\nexist in Russia and Bohemia, but as yet they possess only local\r\nsignification and have produced no practical effect outside of their\r\nrespective countries. =Michael Glinka= (1803-1857) with his patriotic\r\nopera, _Life for the Czar_, founded the Russian opera in 1836. The\r\nBohemian opera is of more recent origin and is associated principally\r\nwith the names of =Friedrich Smetana= (1824-1884) and =Antonin Dvořák=\r\n(1841-1904).\r\n\r\n=Resumé=.—From its dual nature, the opera is necessarily a compromise.\r\nComposed of two elements, the musical and the dramatic, it is\r\npeculiarly susceptible to disintegration; its history is a record of\r\nalmost continuous veering from one to the other of these two phases.\r\nWe have seen how the immense proportions of the ancient amphitheatres\r\nled to the musical declamation on which the opera is founded, from\r\nthe fact that the tones of the singing voice are far more reaching\r\nthan those of the voice in speaking. The Florentine experimenters, in\r\nseeking to restore this declamation, soon discovered the capabilities\r\nfor emotional expression latent in the varying timbres and vastly\r\nextended range of the former. As for its musical possibilities, these\r\nwere entirely beyond their ken. The steps taken in that direction they\r\nregarded with disfavor as indicating a deviation from the oratorical\r\nstandards which were their sole aim. After Carissimi and Scarlatti had\r\ndeveloped the elements of symmetrical form and melody, music emerged\r\nfrom this dependent condition and dictated to the drama, which sank\r\nto an almost negligible factor. The reaction led by Gluck served to\r\nrestore the balance for a time, but through Rossini and his followers\r\nthe pendulum again swung in the other direction. The Romantic movement\r\nthen brought the drama again to the fore; the spirit of the age was\r\nbehind it and all schools felt its influence, though each manifested it\r\nin characteristic fashion.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Opera on Music in General=.—These alternations have\r\nhad a powerful effect on the development of music in general, an\r\neffect both technical and expressive in nature. From the harpsichord\r\nand the few viols used at first merely to support the voice and to\r\ngive it pitch, the orchestra expanded into a large body of instruments\r\ncapable in itself of dramatic utterance. From the tiny ritornello of\r\neight measures played by three flutes in Peri’s _Euridice_, there has\r\ngrown an independent instrumental art of vast significance. The opera\r\nalso created a school of singing which though often unworthily used\r\nfor purposes of purely personal display is the basis of the vocal art\r\nof today. In short, it is not too much to say that the little band of\r\nscholars and musicians who met three centuries ago with the aim of\r\nreviving a lost art practically originated a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nFinck.—Wagner and His Works.\r\n\r\nModern Composers and Their Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Wagner’s theory of the Music Drama.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the term Leading Motive?

The landmarks, so to speak, of this\r\nperiod are Clementi, Cramer, Hummel, Czerny, Moscheles and Field.\r\n\r\n=Muzio Clementi= (1752-1832) was born at Rome. His father was quick\r\nto perceive his son’s gift for music, and strove to develop it by the\r\nbest teaching available. While he was still a lad, an Englishman,\r\nBedford or Beckford, took young Clementi with him to England where\r\nhe lived with his benefactor until 1770, perfecting himself in piano\r\nplaying and composition. At his first appearances in London he created\r\na furore, and from 1777-1780 he conducted at the piano in the Italian\r\nopera there. In 1781, he began his travels as a virtuoso. At Vienna he\r\nmade the acquaintance of Josef Haydn, and also had a sort of musical\r\ncombat with Mozart. Each read at sight, played his own compositions and\r\nimprovised. Opinion was divided as to the outcome. Clementi displayed\r\nmore virtuosity, while Mozart charmed by his singing-tone, finished\r\nphrasing and expressive style. For the following twenty years, Clementi\r\nlived in London. He became interested in a piano manufactory and when\r\nthe firm failed, he established another, which is still carried on.\r\nIn 1802, Clementi went on a concert-tour with two favorite pupils, J.\r\nB. Cramer and John Field. They visited Paris, Vienna and even St.\r\nPetersburg, arousing great enthusiasm everywhere. In 1810, he settled\r\nin London permanently, devoting himself to composition and business. In\r\n1817, he published his _Gradus ad Parnassum_, a series of one hundred\r\nstudies treating every branch of technic and every problem of piano\r\nplaying then known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUZIO CLEMENTI.]\r\n\r\n=Clementi as Composer and Pianist=.—In addition to his early works,\r\nClementi composed symphonies, more than one hundred sonatas for piano,\r\npreludes, toccatas, canons and other piano music and finally the\r\n_Gradus_. As Clementi was a true Italian by temperament, and German in\r\nhis education, the sonatas show the influence of Domenico Scarlatti, as\r\nwell as of Haydn and Mozart. They are technically in advance of their\r\nday, though inclined to dryness musically. However, Beethoven admired\r\nthem, and is said to have preferred them to those of Mozart. Clementi’s\r\nmonumental work, the studies, treats every difficulty and style of\r\npiano playing so very comprehensively that it is still indispensable\r\nto the student. In his youth Clementi was a bravura-player, pure and\r\nsimple. “Strong in runs of thirds, but without a pennyworth of feeling”\r\nwas Mozart’s verdict. But later, when Clementi had become acquainted\r\nwith the larger tone of the English pianos, he cultivated expressive\r\nplaying. At his best, his brilliancy and facility were dazzling, and he\r\ninvariably carried all before him. Considering the fundamental value of\r\nhis studies, and his preëminent abilities as a pianist, it is just to\r\ngive him the title of “The Father of Piano Playing.”\r\n\r\n=Johann Baptist Cramer= (1771-1858) was born at Mannheim, Germany. When\r\nhe was but a year old his father moved to London. As a boy he studied\r\nthe violin and the piano, as well as the theory of music, but soon\r\nshowed the greater aptitude for the piano. Later he became a pupil of\r\nClementi. Handel, Bach, Scarlatti, Haydn and Mozart were the objects\r\nof his attention, thus establishing a taste for the classics. In 1788,\r\nCramer began a series of tours on the Continent, living at London in\r\nthe intervals. In 1828, he founded the music publishing firm of J.\r\nB. Cramer & Co. He lived in Paris from 1832 to 1845, but returned to\r\nLondon, where he remained until his death.\r\n\r\n=Cramer as Composer and Pianist=.—Of Cramer’s numerous compositions,\r\nsuch as seven concertos and one hundred and five sonatas for the\r\npiano, besides variations, rondos, fantasias, etc., a quartet and\r\nquintet, little is worth survival. His representative work is a series\r\nof seventy-six studies, Op. 50, to which he afterwards added. These\r\nstudies long enjoyed a reputation second only to those of Clementi.\r\nThey do not aim primarily at virtuosity, but towards the cultivation\r\nof musical style; at the same time they exhibit novelty of technical\r\ninvention, and demand a decided proficiency. Thus they tend to\r\nsupplement the studies of Clementi which are chiefly concerned with\r\ntechnic. As a performer, Cramer was greatly admired for his perfect\r\nlegato, distinctness of phrasing and quiet singing tone. Beethoven\r\nis said to have preferred him to all other pianists of his time.\r\nWhile Cramer does not present a technical advance over Clementi, he\r\nundoubtedly did much for the cultivation of the more strictly musical\r\nqualities and thus stands for a definite progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. B. CRAMER. J. N. HUMMEL.]\r\n\r\n=Johann Nepomuk Hummel= (1778-1837) was born at Presburg, Hungary.\r\nHis father, who had been instructor in music at a military school in\r\nWartburg, moved to Vienna in 1786 to become director at the theatre of\r\nSchikaneder, (the author of the libretto of Mozart’s opera “The Magic\r\nFlute”). Mozart soon took so deep an interest in young Hummel that he\r\ntook him to live with him and taught him for two years. From 1788 to\r\n1795, Hummel traveled as a virtuoso. On returning to Vienna he studied\r\ncomposition with Albrechtsberger, and received advice from Salieri and\r\nHaydn. From 1804 to 1811 he was music-director under Prince Esterhazy,\r\nHaydn’s patron. In 1816, he became conductor at Stuttgart, and in\r\n1819 he occupied a similar position at Weimar. From here he went to\r\nRussia, where he made a successful concert-tour, playing at Warsaw,\r\nwhere the youthful Chopin heard him. From 1825 to 1833 he traveled on\r\nconcert-tours, returning to Weimar, where he passed the remainder of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n=Hummel as Composer and Pianist=.—Hummel’s compositions include\r\noperas, ballets, masses and other church music, a quintet, trios,\r\nrondos, studies and other music for the piano, but he is best known\r\nfor the piano concertos in A-flat, A minor and B minor, the sonatas\r\nin F-sharp minor and D major, the Septet, Op. 74, and a voluminous\r\ninstruction-book for the piano, chiefly remarkable for its pedantry\r\nand absence of practicality. As a pupil of Mozart, he followed his\r\nteacher’s form and style, without exhibiting marked creative genius.\r\nHis technic is noticeable chiefly for its superficial glitter of\r\nbrilliant passages, which constitute a certain development in\r\nthemselves. His compositions were in great vogue at one time, and he\r\nwas once even regarded as the equal of Beethoven. As a pianist, Hummel\r\nwas unusual. His style was distinguished by precision, clearness, and\r\ncommand of brilliant effect. His influence as a concert pianist was\r\nvery great, and in this direction his extension of the province of the\r\nvirtuoso is considerable. He undoubtedly affected Chopin’s piano style\r\nfor a time and for this reason alone should claim our attention.\r\n\r\n=Carl Czerny= (1791-1857) was born at Vienna. His father, an excellent\r\nmusician, taught his son piano playing at an early age. Beethoven\r\nbecame interested in him, and gave him lessons. He also learned much\r\nfrom Hummel and Clementi. Czerny soon became in great demand as a\r\nteacher. He made concert-tours to Leipzig, Paris, London and Lombardy.\r\nFor the most part he lived quietly in Vienna, teaching and composing.\r\nIn 1850, his health gave way from overwork. His most celebrated pupils\r\nwere Franz Liszt and Theodore Leschetizky.\r\n\r\n=Czerny’s Compositions=.—Czerny was an indefatigable and over-fluent\r\ncomposer who weakened his powers by over-productivity. Hence, of more\r\nthan a thousand works, his masses, requiems, symphonies, overtures,\r\nchamber-music, etc., are obsolete, but his educational works are\r\ndestined to live. Of many valuable sets of studies, the most used are\r\nthose for Velocity, Op. 299, and Finger Training, Op. 740. Musically,\r\nthey are of slight importance, but they are invaluable to this day\r\nin acquiring facility. Czerny had an immense knowledge of the higher\r\nmechanism of piano playing, and a keen perception of practical methods.\r\nHis fame as a pianist was overshadowed by his ceaseless work as teacher\r\nand composer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL CZERNY.]\r\n\r\n=Ignaz Moscheles= (1794-1870), described as “the foremost pianist after\r\nHummel and before Chopin,” was born at Prague. He studied the piano\r\nwith Dionys Weber, director of the Prague Conservatory, and at fourteen\r\nplayed a concerto of his own in public. After the death of his father,\r\nhe went to Vienna to make his way as a teacher, and to continue his\r\nstudies in composition. He soon became in great demand as a pianist and\r\nteacher, and for ten years lived the life of a traveling virtuoso. In\r\n1824, he gave lessons to Mendelssohn, then a boy of fifteen, at Berlin.\r\nSoon after his marriage at Hamburg, in 1826, he went to London, where\r\nhe remained with some interruptions for nearly twenty years of activity\r\nas pianist, teacher and conductor. In 1845, he took the post of teacher\r\nof the piano at the Leipzig Conservatory, founded by Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IGNAZ MOSCHELES.]\r\n\r\n=Moscheles as Composer and Pianist=.—As a composer, Moscheles was\r\ndivided between his classical training and his unmistakably romantic\r\ninstincts. Hence, a long list of variations, fantasias, rondos, written\r\nto please publishers, in accordance with the fashion of the time,\r\nhave not survived, but his best works, the concerto in G minor, the\r\n“Pathetic” concerto, the sonata, Op. 49, his duet for two pianos,\r\n“Hommage á Handel” and especially the studies, Op. 70 and 95, combine\r\na respect for classic form with the growing Romantic movement. The\r\nstudies may be regarded as the legitimate successors to those of\r\nCramer, and paved the way for the more romantic etudes of Chopin.\r\nMoscheles was a solidly trained pianist of great brilliancy. He had\r\nmany characteristics of the classical school; he used the pedals\r\nsparingly, he played octaves with a stiff wrist, his phrasing was\r\nprecise and his accents were sharply marked; but in the brilliant style\r\nhe had no rivals. He was famous for his improvisations; his cadenzas to\r\nconcertos and his extempore treatments of well-known themes were marked\r\nby spontaneity, brilliance and exquisite feeling.\r\n\r\n=John Field= (1782-1837), one of the last connecting links between the\r\nClassical and Romantic schools, was born at Dublin. Early in life,\r\nhe was taken to London and apprenticed to Clementi, who gave him\r\nlessons, and employed him to show off his pianos. In 1802, he went on\r\na concert-tour with Clementi to Paris, Germany and Russia. Field lived\r\nfor many years as pianist and teacher at St. Petersburg and Moscow.\r\nAfter returning to England, he made a long tour through Belgium,\r\nSwitzerland, and finally, Italy, where his health gave way. Shortly\r\nafter he returned to Moscow, where he died.\r\n\r\n=Field as Composer and Pianist=.—Field’s compositions in classical\r\nforms include seven concertos, four sonatas, rondos, variations, etc.\r\nThey are forgotten now, although Chopin had a partiality for his\r\nconcerto in A-flat and gave it to his pupils; but his lyric pieces for\r\npiano, entitled nocturnes, are still played. They are the forerunners\r\nof the type so extended and developed by Chopin. He is thus one of the\r\nfirst of the romanticists in spite of his classical training. In 1802,\r\nField astonished the Parisians by his masterly playing of Bach and\r\nHandel, but his individuality later took a more romantic turn. His tone\r\nwas tender and melancholy, and his phrases gently expressive. Shortly\r\nbefore his death, though broken in health, he created a stir in Vienna\r\nby his interpretations of his own nocturnes. In some respects his\r\nplaying was akin to Chopin’s highly individual style.\r\n\r\n=To sum up=, it will be seen that Clementi was the originator of a\r\nsystem of technic that has served as the foundation of modern piano\r\nplaying; Cramer was the conserver of classic style and purity of\r\nstandard; Hummel, as a brilliant pianist, had a decided influence on\r\nthe piano playing of his time, but as a composer attempted to pass\r\nsuperficial brilliance for the true coin of musical substance; Czerny,\r\none of the greatest educators in the history of piano playing, has had\r\nan immense influence through his invaluable educational works, and as\r\nthe teacher of Franz Liszt, the epitome of modern piano playing, and\r\nalso of Theodore Leschetizky, possibly the foremost teacher of the\r\npresent day; Moscheles, the classic pianist, gave decided impetus to\r\nthe cause of romanticism by his best compositions; Field, though the\r\npupil of Clementi, prepared the way through his own individuality for\r\nthe greatest piano composer of the Romantic period, Chopin, and thus\r\nbecame an important factor in the transition from the Classic to the\r\nRomantic period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Pianoforte\r\nPlaying and players mentioned in this lesson.\r\n\r\nWeitzmann.—History of Piano Playing.\r\n\r\nBie.—The Piano.\r\n\r\nFillmore.—Pianoforte Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat composers form the transition from the Classic to the Romantic\r\nschool?\r\n\r\nGive a summary of this transition period.\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Clementi.\r\n\r\nWhat was Clementi’s greatest work?\r\n\r\nWhat were his contributions to piano playing?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Cramer.\r\n\r\nWhat work is most representative of Cramer as a composer?\r\n\r\nMention his contributions to piano playing.\r\n\r\nGive an account of Hummel’s life.\r\n\r\nWhat classic pianist was a pupil of Mozart?\r\n\r\nWhat was his influence on piano playing?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Czerny’s career.\r\n\r\nWho were Czerny’s most famous pupils?\r\n\r\nWhat influence did he exert on piano playing?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Moscheles’ life.\r\n\r\nWhat composer was the intimate friend of Moscheles?\r\n\r\nWhat is the value of his educational works?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Field’s career and his influence on piano playing.\r\n\r\nWhat form did Field originate?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ PETER SCHUBERT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XLII.\r\n\r\n                         FRANZ PETER SCHUBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Romantic school involves a greater freedom in form, a\r\nfuller play of poetry and imagination, a general artistic evolution and\r\nindependence in comparison with the formality of the Classic period.\r\nThe struggle to establish these principles was long and obstinate, but\r\nthe outcome was as inevitable as the victory won by Beethoven’s sonata\r\nand symphonic forms over the more primitive types of Haydn and Mozart.\r\nThe first departures from the classic attitude were made by Schubert,\r\nwhose influence has been permanent in the development of romanticism.\r\n\r\n=Schubert’s Early Life= (1797-1816).—Franz Peter Schubert was born in\r\na suburb of Vienna, January 31, 1797. At an early age he had lessons\r\non the violin from his father, who was a school teacher, and on the\r\npiano, from his elder brother. He so quickly outstripped both teachers\r\nthat he was sent to Michael Holzer, choir-master of the parish, who\r\ntaught him piano, organ, violin, singing and theory. In later years,\r\nHolzer disclaimed the value of his instruction, saying: “If I ever\r\nwished to teach him anything new, I found he had already mastered\r\nit.” After singing in the parish choir, he passed an examination for\r\nadmission to the Imperial _Convict_ or school for the Royal choristers.\r\nThe training included general education as well as music; there was\r\nalso an orchestra among the boys in which Schubert played the violin\r\nand sometimes conducted. There were privations connected with life at\r\nthe _Convict_, the practice rooms were insufferably cold, and the food\r\ninsufficient. In 1810, Schubert began to compose, dating his pieces\r\ncarefully, and the only check to his inspiration was the lack of\r\nmusic-paper, which he was too poor to buy. A generous friend made up\r\nthe deficiency. In 1813, he left the _Convict_, although his general\r\neducation was by no means complete, since he had neglected his studies\r\non account of his increasing passion for composition. After leaving\r\nthe _Convict_, Schubert taught elementary classes at his father’s\r\nschool, but the drudgery became insupportable. An ardent friend and\r\nadmirer, Franz von Schober, realizing that Schubert’s creative powers\r\nwere greatly hampered by the conditions of his life, gave him a home.\r\nAlready he had composed some of his most famous songs, including “The\r\nErl-King.”\r\n\r\n=Later Years= (1816-1828).—From 1816 on, Schubert appears to have\r\nlived in Schober’s apartments, except for two years shared with the\r\npoet Mayerhofer, and a period spent with a friend, Schwind. It is\r\na mystery how Schubert managed to live, for he taught little, and\r\nhis few publications could have brought him at best only small sums\r\nat irregular intervals. He had already failed to secure a position\r\nin a Government school of music, but in 1818 he passed the summer\r\nas music teacher to the household of Count Johann Esterhazy, in\r\nZelescz, Hungary. The record of his life hereafter is one of incessant\r\ncomposition, with few interruptions or facts of interest. In 1823, he\r\nshowed Weber his eighth work for the stage: “Alfonso and Estrella.” The\r\nonly advice he received was that “first operas, like first puppies,\r\nshould be drowned.” The summer of 1824 was spent again with the\r\nEsterhazys and many characteristic compositions, such as the quartet in\r\nA minor, the “Hungarian Divertissement,” the piano sonata in B-flat,\r\netc., date from this time. In 1826, Schubert failed to obtain either\r\nof two positions, which would have placed him above need, the second\r\nbecause, like Beethoven, he refused to alter a trial aria to suit the\r\nvoice of a capricious singer. Schubert was taken to see Beethoven\r\nduring his last illness, in 1827. In 1828, he went to live with his\r\nbrother Ferdinand in a new and damp house. His health, which had\r\nbeen troublesome before, now gave way, and he died of typhoid fever,\r\nNovember 28, 1828, in his thirty-second year.\r\n\r\n=Personal Traits and Habits of Work=.—Schubert was short of stature,\r\nthickset and rather heavy in features. His face in repose was rather\r\ndevoid of expression, but when interested in anything, his eyes glowed\r\nwith enthusiasm and his whole appearance changed. His disposition was\r\neven and good-tempered, he was simple and trusting by nature, and\r\ncould rarely be induced to put himself forward. Although receiving\r\nmany favors from friends, his generosity often led him to give to\r\nothers when he could ill spare it. He began composing early in the\r\nmorning and worked uninterruptedly for several hours; he walked much\r\nin the afternoon or paid visits to friends, spending his evenings with\r\ncongenial spirits at various taverns. Composing was the mainspring of\r\nhis existence, and he often wrote down his ideas while in the midst\r\nof conversation with others. Thus he wrote his immortal “Serenade” on\r\nthe back of a bill-of-fare at a tavern; a piece for four-hands while\r\nwaiting at a hospital for a friend, “and dinner missed in consequence”;\r\na movement of a string quartet was begun about midnight and finished in\r\nthe early morning. Although he set many poems by Goethe, Schiller and\r\nHeine, his inspiration was quite as effectively aroused by second-rate\r\npoems of his friends Mayerhofer, von Schober, or the artless poems of\r\nMüller. Schubert was shy and reserved in what might be called “good\r\nsociety”; he preferred the company of congenial friends in an humbler\r\nsocial station. He seems to have cared little for literature, and his\r\nlove of poetry was limited to its availability as texts for songs.\r\nIn early life he played the violin and the viola in a family string\r\nquartet. Schubert was no virtuoso on the piano, but he played exquisite\r\naccompaniments, and he read well at sight in spite of defective\r\neyesight. His performance was marked by earnestness and attention to\r\nthe inner sentiment of the music rather than by the superficial polish\r\nof the mere pianist. It was said that no one could forget the effect\r\nof Schubert’s songs as performed by himself and his friend Vogl; the\r\ntwo seemed absolutely united, the ideal condition for the rendering of\r\nvocal works.\r\n\r\n=Schubert’s Compositions=.—Schubert completed more than eleven hundred\r\npieces in about eighteen years. Such fertility is unique in the history\r\nof composition, and is scarcely equalled even by Mozart, whose activity\r\nextended over nearly thirty years. Schubert’s powers of spontaneous\r\ninvention have never been approached; he composed generally without\r\nmaking sketches; he seldom revised, for his ideas came faster than he\r\ncould write them down. It is impossible to enumerate all Schubert’s\r\nworks, but the following comprise the most important: Nine symphonies,\r\neleven works for the stage, six masses, over seventy part-songs,\r\nchoruses, etc., for various combinations, twenty-four sonatas for\r\npiano, fantasies, overtures, variations, marches and dances for piano\r\nduet, impromptus, moments musicals, fantasies, variations and over\r\ntwo hundred dances for piano solo, two trios for piano and strings,\r\na quintet for strings and piano, a string quintet and several string\r\ntrios, twenty-four string quartets, besides about six hundred songs\r\nwith piano accompaniment and occasionally with obligatos for other\r\ninstruments. It is obvious that such fertility is not consistent\r\nwith evenness of quality; we must pick and choose to find the real\r\nSchubert. However, the symphonies in C and B minor (“Unfinished”),\r\nthe string quartets in D minor and G major, several sonatas for\r\npiano, the impromptus, moments musicals, the fantasy in C for piano,\r\nthe Hungarian Divertissement, several marches and other compositions\r\nfor four hands, many charming two-hand waltzes, and, finally, such\r\nsong-cycles as the “Miller-Songs,” the “Winter Journey,” those called\r\n“Swan-Songs” by the publishers, as well as about thirty separate songs\r\n“The Erl-King,” “The Wanderer,” “To Sylvia,” “The Omnipotent,” “The\r\nYoung Nun,” the “Serenade,” “Hark! Hark! the Lark,” “Sei mir Gegrüsst,”\r\n“Du bist die Ruh,” “Ave Maria,” “Litany,” and others, are the works\r\nof Schubert which will live. Schubert at his best entrances us by his\r\nwonderful flow of melody, his spontaneity, his symmetrical form, which,\r\nhowever, is sometimes diffuse. His chief qualities lie in the simple\r\nexpressiveness of his music, a direct appeal to sincerity of emotion,\r\nand to the sense of the poetic. He began by imitating the form and\r\nstyle of Mozart and Beethoven; but from his eighteenth year onward\r\nhe developed an individuality entirely apart. Despite the virtues\r\nof his instrumental music, his great achievement was the creation\r\nof the German song, in which department he stands unrivalled in the\r\ninexhaustibility of his melody, the variety of mood which they display,\r\nthe subtlety and harmonic beauty of his accompaniments, as well as art\r\nin creating vocal effects.\r\n\r\n=Schubert’s Influence on Music=.—In abundance of resource, poetic\r\nfeeling and true imagination, Schubert has brought new forces into\r\nmusic. His influence on romantic composers was widespread and deep.\r\nSchumann was a thorough admirer of Schubert. Schumann’s songs could\r\nhardly have come into existence but for those of Schubert, and\r\nthe latter’s short pieces for piano were undoubtedly as potent an\r\ninspiration for his piano works. Brahms, too, had a real reverence\r\nfor Schubert, that is plainly exhibited in his works. Despite the\r\ndifferences of their artistic individuality, there are traces of\r\nSchubert in the former’s songs as well as in some of his short piano\r\npieces. Liszt’s partiality to Schubert was untiring in its zeal. He\r\nplayed his piano music, transcribed the “Hungarian Divertissement,”\r\narranged some of the marches for two hands and for orchestra; he made\r\na version of the fantasy in C for piano and orchestra, which is still\r\npopular; and, finally (perhaps his greatest service to Schubert) he\r\ntranscribed no less than fifty-seven of his songs for piano. In this\r\nform he created an interest in Schubert where the original versions\r\nwere unknown, and did much to spread their renown. In spite of all\r\nshortcomings, Schubert’s genius was so remarkable, and his immediate\r\neffect upon the Romantic movement so apparent and his legacy to the\r\nmusical world so imperishable that it is difficult not to agree with\r\nSir George Grove when he wrote: “There has never been one like him and\r\nthere never will be another.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove.—Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article on Schubert.\r\n\r\nFrost.—Life of Schubert.\r\n\r\nVon Hellborn.—Life of Franz Schubert.\r\n\r\nDvořák.—Franz Schubert.

MENDELSSOHN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchubert’s operas had no appreciable effect on the Romantic composers,\r\nfor the simple reason that they were never heard on account of the\r\nabsurdities of their librettos and the weakness of their stage\r\nsituations. At about the same period, a slightly older composer was\r\nbeginning a series of works destined to place German Opera on a firm\r\nbasis, to exercise a decided influence on Wagner, besides contributing\r\nnot a little to the development of piano technic.\r\n\r\n=Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber= was born at Eutin, December 18,\r\n1786. His father, a restless man of many talents, was a theatrical\r\nmanager during Weber’s early years, when constant traveling was the\r\nrule, and music lessons the exception. His irregular early instruction\r\nunder several teachers, of whom Michael Haydn was the most eminent, was\r\nsupplemented by two years of solid study under the gifted and eccentric\r\nAbbé Vogler. From 1804 to 1806, Weber was music-director at the Breslau\r\ntheatre, and soon made a name for himself as composer and pianist as\r\nwell as conductor. After this he remained under the protection of the\r\nDuke of Wurtemburg, earning a living by giving lessons, and acting as\r\nsecretary to the Duke’s brother. During this period he composed an\r\nopera “Silvana,” overtures, a cantata, piano music, etc. Three years\r\nof wandering, chiefly on concert tours, ensued after his banishment\r\nfrom Wurtemburg on account of unjustly suspected complicity in an\r\nintrigue for a position at court. To these years belong a comic opera,\r\n“Abu Hassan,” the piano concertos in C and E-flat, three concertos for\r\nclarinet, the piano sonata in C, etc. In 1814 and 1815, he composed\r\nthe choruses, “Lyre and Sword,” and a cantata, “Battle and Victory,”\r\nboth the outcome of political events, and widely popular from their\r\npatriotic character. In 1816, he became music-director of the German\r\nopera at Dresden. He revived interest in German opera, stimulated\r\npublic support and in the following years began the composition of\r\n“Der Freischütz,” an opera thoroughly German in its character and the\r\nkeystone of Weber’s fame. It was not finished until 1820, for in the\r\nmeantime he wrote much of his best piano music, songs and incidental\r\nmusic for a gipsy play “Preciosa.” Just after the completion of his\r\npopular Concert-piece for piano and orchestra, “Der Freischütz” was\r\ngiven for the first time at Berlin, June 18, 1821, and the result was\r\none of the greatest triumphs ever bestowed on a German composer. It\r\nwas soon given in all the principal theatres in Germany, including\r\nDresden, and also in Vienna. In 1823, Weber’s most ambitious opera,\r\n“Euryanthe,” was given in Vienna and proved almost a failure. Weber’s\r\nhealth, which had not been satisfactory for some years, showed signs\r\nof being undermined. “Euryanthe” was performed with greater success\r\nduring 1824 and 1825, at Dresden, Leipzig and Berlin, where Weber was\r\nalmost too ill to conduct. In spite of his ill-health he agreed to\r\nwrite an opera for the Covent Garden Theatre, in London, beginning the\r\nmusic to “Oberon” early in 1825 and finishing the last number in the\r\nspring of 1826. The performances were more than satisfactory, and Weber\r\nwas received everywhere with enthusiasm. His strength was now entirely\r\novertaxed, and he hoped to return to his family, but he died suddenly\r\nfrom consumption, on June 4, 1826.\r\n\r\n=Weber’s personality= was pleasing; of excellent birth, his experience\r\nof the world through his positions as opera-director and his frequent\r\nconcert-tours, made him an agreeable companion and a favorite in\r\nsociety. He was cultivated, well read in philosophy and science; he\r\npossessed considerable literary and critical ability. In consequence\r\nof his intellectual and social gifts, he was a new type of musician,\r\nwho did much to improve the social status of the composer. He was a\r\nremarkable pianist, with an immense command of technic, original in\r\nstyle and eloquent in expression; also a forceful conductor.\r\n\r\n=Weber the Composer=.—Weber is, first of all, the composer of the\r\nthree operas, “Der Freischütz,” “Euryanthe” and “Oberon,” which are\r\ndiscussed in Lesson XXXVII. The overtures to his operas are his best\r\norchestral works; his symphonies and chamber-music are unimportant.\r\nHowever, his three concertos for clarinet and orchestra are classics\r\nin the literature of that instrument. Weber’s songs are interesting\r\nfor the sidelight they throw on the development of the Folk-song\r\ntendency, but in this line he was entirely overshadowed by Schubert\r\nand Schumann. However, Weber’s piano music is exceedingly important.\r\nThe concertos for piano are seldom heard, but the “Concert-piece” is\r\nstill amply worth study. The piano sonatas (especially those in C and\r\nA-flat) show great technical inventiveness, melodic charm and original\r\neffects, but they are less happy in point of form. Next to the sonatas\r\nin interest comes the delightful Op. 65, “Invitation to the Dance,” so\r\nwell-known in Berlioz’ orchestral version. In addition are the “Momento\r\nCapriccioso,” Op. 12, the Rondo in E-flat, Op. 62, the “Polacca\r\nBrillante,” Op. 72, the Polonaise, Op. 21. Weber did much to develop\r\nthe technic of the left hand; his piano compositions are thoroughly\r\npianistic and rank high in the music of the Romantic period.\r\n\r\n=Weber’s Influence=.—Weber’s position in the evolution of the Romantic\r\nschool is extremely important. In Opera his exploration of the\r\nimaginative field in so many directions not only opened a new vein\r\nin dramatic music, but its influence was felt in every branch of\r\ncomposition. Thus several of Schumann’s choral works, Mendelssohn’s\r\n“Midsummer Night’s Dream” music, the “Walpurgis Night” cantata, the\r\nconcert overtures, and pieces for piano and orchestra are direct\r\nmusical descendants of Weber. Mendelssohn’s Concerto in G minor, the\r\n“Serenade” and “Allegro Giojoso,” his scherzos and “Songs Without\r\nWords” are the direct outcome of Weber’s example. In general, the\r\ntechnical style of Weber’s piano music was thoroughly absorbed by both\r\nMendelssohn and, to some extent, Liszt, who edited Weber’s sonatas\r\nand solo pieces with tempting additions; he transcribed for piano\r\nthe overtures “Jubilee,” “Freischütz” and “Oberon,” and arranged the\r\n“Polacca Brillante,” Op. 72, for piano and orchestra. Liszt was very\r\nfond of Weber’s music, his piano style was sympathetic to him, his\r\ninterpretation of the Concert-piece, Op. 79, never failed to produce\r\nan overwhelming effect. Finally, Weber’s influence on Wagner must\r\nbe mentioned. Wagner greatly admired Weber’s dramatic insight, his\r\npicturesqueness, and especially the poetry and novel color of his\r\norchestral style.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MENDELSSOHN.\r\n\r\nThe influence which Mendelssohn exercised during two-thirds of the\r\n19th century among the more conservative German musicians and in\r\nEngland was nothing short of extraordinary. He undoubtedly gave great\r\nimpetus to the study of the classic masters, especially Bach, and his\r\nromantic tendencies were so balanced and controlled as to gain a speedy\r\nrecognition for his music. Today, Mendelssohn the classicist is less\r\nadmired, and his music will live chiefly for its romantic qualities.\r\n\r\n=Mendelssohn’s Life=.—Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy[15] was\r\nborn at Hamburg, February 3, 1809. His father, a prosperous banker,\r\nmoved to Berlin in 1811. His first lessons in music were given him by\r\nhis mother, but he soon began to study the piano with Ludwig Berger, a\r\npupil of Clementi, and composition with Zelter. In 1820, he began to\r\ncompose systematically. In 1821, he made the acquaintance of Weber,\r\nand his enthusiasm for the romantic composer lasted all his life. In\r\n1824, he formed a life-long friendship with Moscheles, who gave him\r\npiano lessons. Already he was remarkable for his improvisations and\r\nfor playing from scores. In 1825, a trip to Paris brought him into\r\ncontact with the celebrated musicians there. In this year he composed\r\nhis octet for strings, in which his individuality first asserted itself\r\nstrongly. In the following summer he wrote the overture to “A Midsummer\r\nNight’s Dream,” a precocious evidence of originality. In 1827, he made\r\nthe first draft of his overture “A Calm Sea and a Prosperous Voyage,”\r\na further step into the realm of imagination. In 1829, he organized\r\nthe first performance of Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion” music since\r\nthe composer’s death. In this year a visit to England, where some of\r\nhis compositions were performed, was followed by a trip to Scotland,\r\nthe Hebrides and Wales, of which his impressions are recorded in the\r\n“Hebrides” overture, the “Scotch” symphony and other works of later\r\nyears. He traveled much during the following years. In 1833, after\r\nanother visit to England, where his recently composed “Italian”\r\nsymphony was played, he conducted a musical festival at Düsseldorf, the\r\nfirst of many similar engagements. During the next few years he was\r\nconstantly employed in conducting, playing and composing, especially\r\nhis oratorio “St. Paul.” In 1837, he married Miss Cécile Jeanrenaud.\r\nFrom this time dates his second piano concerto in D minor, in which are\r\nto be seen traces of Thalberg’s piano style. During the next few years\r\nMendelssohn lived at Leipzig. In 1843, he established a conservatory\r\nat Leipzig, long the most celebrated in Europe. Schumann, and later\r\nMoscheles, were among the teachers as well as Mendelssohn himself. In\r\n1846, Mendelssohn’s oratorio “Elijah” was given a triumphant first\r\nperformance at Birmingham under the composer’s direction. In 1847,\r\nhe made his tenth visit to England for performances of “Elijah,” of\r\nhis completed “Midsummer Night’s Dream” music (composed in 1845), the\r\n“Scotch” symphony and other works. The death of his sister, Fanny,\r\nfollowing soon after those of his parents, was so great a shock to\r\nhim that he went to Switzerland for a rest. He returned improved in\r\nhealth, but could not consider commissions for new works from England,\r\nFrankfort and Cologne. He was considering a trip to Vienna to hear\r\nJenny Lind sing in “Elijah” when he was taken suddenly ill and died,\r\nNovember 4, 1847.\r\n\r\n=Personal Traits=.—Mendelssohn is described as having an unusually\r\nanimated, winning personality. He was immensely fond of society, which\r\nhe could enjoy without detriment to his work. His letters describe\r\nin detail his innumerable professional engagements, his round of\r\nsocial festivities and his journeys with equal fidelity. Mendelssohn\r\nwas fond of out-of-door life, walking, riding and swimming; he also\r\ngreatly enjoyed dancing. One of his favorite relaxations was to sketch\r\nfrom nature or paint in water-colors. Mendelssohn was a remarkable\r\npianist, of an unaffected type, not a virtuoso, yet his interpretations\r\nwere full of vigor, charm and a thoroughly musical spirit. His\r\nimprovisations were remarkable for their spontaneous invention,\r\nbrilliance and science displayed, and his cadenzas to Beethoven’s 4th\r\nconcerto and Mozart’s, in D minor, were striking examples of his skill.\r\nMendelssohn was also a remarkable organist, if English testimony is\r\nto be credited. At all events, he did much to further the knowledge\r\nof Bach’s organ works. Mendelssohn’s incessant activity undoubtedly\r\nhastened his death; the amount that he compressed into his short life\r\nwas incredible.\r\n\r\n=Compositions=.—The works most representative of Mendelssohn are the\r\n“Scotch” and “Italian” symphonies, the overtures “A Calm Sea and a\r\nProsperous Voyage,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “The Hebrides,”\r\n“Melusina,” “Ruy Blas”; the concertos and two smaller pieces for piano\r\nand orchestra; the concerto for violin; the octet for strings; two\r\nquintets and seven quartets; three quartets for piano and strings; two\r\ntrios; two sonatas for piano and ’cello; for the piano, six preludes\r\nand fugues; three sonatas; the “Serious Variations”; six books of\r\n“Songs Without Words”; many smaller pieces, including the “Capriccio,”\r\nOp. 8; the “Rondo Capriccioso,” Op. 14; the Caprices, Op. 33; the\r\nScherzo à Capriccio and others; sonatas, preludes and fugues for organ;\r\nthe oratorios “St. Paul,” and “Elijah”; music to “A Midsummer Night’s\r\nDream,” to the dramas “Athalie,” “Antigone” and “Œdipus”; the cantata\r\n“Walpurgis Night.” He also wrote a great deal of church music, psalms,\r\nhymns, motets, and cantatas for various occasions, including the\r\n“Lobgesang,” a symphony-cantata; many part-songs, duets and songs for\r\nsingle voice with piano accompaniment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FELIX MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY.]\r\n\r\n=Mendelssohn’s Tendencies=.—Although he wrote almost exclusively in the\r\nconventional forms, Mendelssohn cannot be regarded as a continuator\r\nof the classics. In form, thematic development, counterpoint,\r\npart-writing, etc., he imitated the letter of classic example closely,\r\nbut could not attain the inner spirit. To some extent he followed Bach,\r\nHandel, Mozart and Beethoven, but the chief source of his individuality\r\nis the romanticism of Weber. His piano style is adapted from that of\r\nWeber with some extensions of his own. Showered with praise as he was\r\nduring his lifetime, as the possessor of all the classic virtues, we\r\nnow admire him chiefly for his romanticism, timid and fastidious though\r\nit appears by comparison with the genuine innovations of Berlioz,\r\nLiszt and Wagner. In the light of the sturdy qualities of Brahms, his\r\nclassicism seems superficial. His style was too polished to admit\r\nof real vigor. Nevertheless, Mendelssohn of the two symphonies, the\r\n“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Melusina” and “Hebrides” overture, the\r\nviolin concerto, the piano concerto in G minor, the sonata for piano\r\nand ’cello in D, the scherzo of the octet, the “Serious Variations,”\r\nthe Scherzo à Capriccio and some half a dozen of the “Songs Without\r\nWords” shows us a delicate and charming individuality with the\r\nrefinement and decided perceptions of the poet, who regarded the\r\nworld with the eyes of a romanticist recording many impressions of\r\npicturesqueness and grace, if seldom of strength.\r\n\r\n=Mendelssohn’s Influence as an Artist=.—For a time, Mendelssohn’s\r\ninfluence was unbounded. His symphonies and overtures were considered\r\nworthy successors to those of Beethoven; his chamber-music was equally\r\nvalued; his oratorios were regarded as on a level with those of\r\nHandel; his piano music, especially the “Songs Without Words,” were in\r\nuniversal vogue. His orchestral style contained many novel features,\r\nit is true, but his chamber-music was not written in the genuine\r\nmanner and is far inferior to that of the later master, Brahms. His\r\noratorios contain some notable choruses and airs, but on the whole are\r\nonly faint imitations of the real oratorio style. Still they sufficed\r\nto form the foundation of an English school of composition in this\r\nform. His piano music contains much that is trivial, but at its best\r\nundoubtedly did something to prepare the way for the deeper romanticism\r\nof Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. His songs also have far less variety of\r\nmood and lyric inspiration than those of Schubert and Schumann, but\r\nthey too acted as prophets of the more vital creations to follow.\r\n\r\nThat this reverence for Mendelssohn was no mere infatuation of the\r\nmoment but a sober respect can best be judged from the diversity in\r\nnationality and temperament of those who came under his influence:\r\nGade, the Norwegian; Sterndale Bennett, the English composer and\r\npianist; Hiller and Reinecke among the Germans, and Rubinstein from\r\nRussia. These names constitute but a small proportion of Mendelssohn’s\r\ndisciples, his personality dominated musical England in every branch\r\nof composition for many years; and English composers are only just\r\nbeginning to throw off the yoke of adherence to the traditional\r\noratorio form as exhibited in “St. Paul” and “Elijah.” Schumann admired\r\nMendelssohn without reserve and without a suggestion of jealousy,\r\nalthough the tide of popular favor neglected him for his more easily\r\nunderstood contemporary. Today, criticism has swung possibly too far in\r\nthe opposite direction, and Mendelssohn suffers from depreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove’s and Riemann’s Dictionaries.—Articles on Weber and Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nBenedict.—Carl Maria von Weber.\r\n\r\nRockstro.—Life of Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nLampadius.—Life of Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nReinecke.—Mendelssohn (Century Library of Music), Mendelssohn’s Letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nMention the significant events in Weber’s life.\r\n\r\nDescribe Weber the man.\r\n\r\nSketch the work of Weber as a composer.\r\n\r\nShow the influence of Weber upon music.\r\n\r\nName some of Weber’s best-known piano works.\r\n\r\nWhat composers were greatly influenced by Weber?\r\n\r\nGive an account of Mendelssohn’s boyhood, manhood.\r\n\r\nWhat educational work in music did Mendelssohn originate?\r\n\r\nIn what lines of musical work did Mendelssohn excel?\r\n\r\nName representative compositions of Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nWhat composers did Mendelssohn follow?\r\n\r\nWhat influence did Mendelssohn exert on music?\r\n\r\nFor students who wish to study Weber’s characteristics, the Momento\r\nCapriccioso, Op. 12, the “Invitation to the Dance,” Op. 65, the\r\npiano sonatas in C and A-flat are the most representative, while the\r\novertures to “Der Freischütz,” “Euryanthe” and “Oberon” show his style\r\nas a dramatic composer.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions may aid the student in his study of\r\nMendelssohn’s works: The “Italian” and “Scotch” symphonies, the\r\n“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Hebrides” and “Melusina” overtures, the\r\nNocturne and Scherzo from the “Midsummer Night’s Dream” music, the\r\nviolin concerto, the concerto in G minor and the Capriccio Brillante\r\nfor piano and orchestra, the pieces for piano, Op. 7, Nos. 3 and 7, the\r\nRondo Capriccioso, Op. 14, the Caprice, Op. 16, No. 2, the Prelude and\r\nFugue, Op. 35, No. 1, the Serious Variations, Op. 54, the Scherzo à\r\nCapriccio without opus number, and the following “Songs Without Words,”\r\nOp. 19, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6; Op. 38, Nos. 2, 3, 5; Op. 62, Nos. 3, 6; Op.\r\n67, No. 4, and Op. 102, No. 3. Liszt has made an exceedingly effective\r\ntranscription of Mendelssohn’s song “On the Wings of Song,” which is a\r\npopular concert number today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON XLIV.\r\n\r\n                            ROBERT SCHUMANN.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Romantic Movement before Schumann=.—Schubert gave a decided\r\nimpetus to the Romantic movement through his spontaneous melody and\r\ndeep fund of imagination. He infused poetry into the classic forms, his\r\npiano works in the small forms showed the way to future achievement in\r\nthese lines, but especially he founded German song, which had scarcely\r\nbeen hinted at by Mozart and Beethoven. Although Weber extended the\r\nprovince of piano technic, and exhibited further possibilities of\r\nromantic feeling in combination with the rondo and sonata forms, his\r\nchief work was the realization of German opera, elsewhere described.\r\nBut still another German was destined to contribute richly to\r\nromantic piano literature, to prove no mean successor to Schubert\r\nin the province of song, and to add further proofs of his genius in\r\nchamber-music, choral works and the symphony.\r\n\r\n=Schumann’s Early life=.—Robert Alexander Schumann was born at\r\nZwickau, in Saxony, June 8, 1810. His father was a bookseller with\r\nsome attainments as an author. Schumann’s gift for music asserted\r\nitself early. He had piano lessons from a local organist at the age of\r\nsix, and began to compose soon after. A taste for improvisation also\r\ndeveloped. For several years his literary interests were as pronounced\r\nas those for music. He read assiduously, and was especially devoted to\r\npoetry. His general education was continued at the Zwickau Academy,\r\nwhere he studied until 1828. In 1827, he came under the joint influence\r\nof the writings of Jean Paul (Richter) the poet and novelist, and of\r\nSchubert’s music, both of which played an important part in his mental\r\nand artistic growth. In 1828, he entered the University of Leipzig\r\nwith the intention of studying law. He kept up his music, however, and\r\nnot only became enthusiastic over the clavier works of Bach, but took\r\npiano lessons of Friedrich Wieck, a celebrated teacher in Leipzig. In\r\n1829, Schumann went to Heidelberg. Here he continued his law studies\r\nin a desultory fashion, but worked with the greatest persistence at\r\npiano playing. In 1830, he resolved to study law with more seriousness,\r\nbut it was intensely repugnant to him, and after some reflection,\r\nhe determined, with Wieck’s advice, to adopt music as a profession.\r\nAccordingly, he returned to Leipzig to study the piano with Wieck,\r\nbut having the misfortune to injure a finger in his zeal for speedy\r\nperfection, he was obliged to forego the career of a virtuoso, perhaps\r\nto the great gain of music.\r\n\r\n=Schumann’s Professional Career=.—He now devoted his attention to\r\nthorough study of composition with Heinrich Dorn. In 1834, Schumann\r\nfounded the “New Journal of Music” in the interests of a higher\r\ncritical standard, and the furtherance of worthy compositions. During\r\nten years of editorship, Schumann found abundant outlet for his\r\nliterary interests, and his paper exerted a considerable force on\r\npublic opinion. Two of his greatest piano works, the Carnival, Op. 9,\r\nand the Symphonic Studies, Op. 13, belong to the year 1834. During\r\nthe years 1836 and 1837, he had some intimacy with Mendelssohn. From\r\n1836-39 date most of Schumann’s important works for the piano. In 1840,\r\nSchumann married Wieck’s daughter, Clara, the celebrated pianist,\r\nafter several years’ struggle to gain her father’s consent. Schumann’s\r\nmarriage was the turning-point in his artistic career, and his wife’s\r\nsympathy was a great stimulus to his creative activity. In the year\r\nfollowing his marriage, Schumann turned to song-composing, producing\r\nmore than one hundred songs in this period. In 1841, he gave himself up\r\nwholly to orchestral composition, writing his symphony in B-flat, the\r\nfirst draft of his D minor symphony, a third work, afterwards published\r\nas Overture, Scherzo and Finale, as well as the first movement of his\r\npiano concerto. In 1842, he confined himself almost exclusively to\r\nchamber-music, composing three string quartets, the masterly quintet,\r\nOp. 44, the quartet, Op. 47, for piano and strings, and a trio. To\r\n1845 belong the “Variations” for two pianos, and a large choral work,\r\n“Paradise and the Peri.” In 1844, Schumann began the music to Goethe’s\r\n“Faust,” but ill-health interrupted him for more than a year. However,\r\nin 1845 he completed the piano concerto, wrote several works for pedal\r\npiano, and in 1846 finished his second symphony. In 1847, he began his\r\nopera “Genoveva,” which was not given until 1850. Late in 1850 he went\r\nto Düsseldorf to take a position as director. While here he composed\r\nhis third symphony. In the following years he wrote several overtures,\r\nworks for solo instruments and orchestra, the overture and incidental\r\nmusic to Byron’s “Manfred,” “The Pilgrimage of the Rose” and many\r\nother choral works, including a Mass and a Requiem. Early in 1854,\r\nsymptoms of a mental disorder, which had been increasing of late years,\r\nculminated in an attempt at suicide. He passed the remaining years of\r\nhis life in an asylum near Bonn, where he died July 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT SCHUMANN.]\r\n\r\n=Schumann’s Personality=.—By reason of his two-fold activity as critic\r\nand composer, Schumann was a new force in music. Highly cultivated in\r\nliterature, philosophy and poetry, he possessed a keen and discerning\r\ncritical taste, and a literary style that was picturesque and eloquent.\r\nSchumann was shy and reserved by nature, he talked little but observed\r\nand reflected abundantly. He was never fond of society, and as years\r\nwent by he lived more and more like a hermit, absorbed in composition\r\nand family life. For ten years, however, he was in touch with the\r\npublic by reason of his editorship of the “New Journal,” and by his\r\nchampionship therein of all that was good and progressive in the music\r\nof the day, did much for the encouragement of true art. His articles\r\non Schubert, Mendelssohn, Gade, Chopin, Berlioz, Liszt, Brahms and\r\nothers formed a new epoch in musical criticism, and helped the cause\r\nof Romanticism immeasurably. No estimate of Schumann’s character is\r\ncomplete without taking into account these distinct tendencies as\r\ncritic and composer. His collected writings give a graphic illustration\r\nof his views on music, and form a supplement to his personality as\r\nexpressed in his music.\r\n\r\n=Schumann’s Compositions=.—Schumann’s most representative works include\r\nfour symphonies and the “Overture, Scherzo and Finale,” the overtures\r\n“Genoveva” and “Manfred”; three string quartets, a piano quintet,\r\na piano quartet, three piano trios and two sonatas for piano and\r\nviolin; the music to “Faust” and “Manfred”; “Paradise and the Peri,”\r\n“The Pilgrimage of the Rose” and other works for solos, chorus and\r\norchestra; more than two hundred songs; the piano concerto and two\r\nsmaller works for piano and orchestra, besides a monumental series\r\nof works for piano alone. In addition there are duets, part-songs,\r\nchoruses, pieces for piano duet, a concert piece for four horns and\r\norchestra, a concerto for ’cello and orchestra, a fantasy for violin\r\nand orchestra, besides short pieces for oboe, viola, clarinet and\r\n’cello with piano accompaniment, the opera “Genoveva,” the overtures\r\n“The Bride of Messina,” “Julius Cæsar” and “Herman and Dorothea,” the\r\nMass, Op. 147, and the Requiem, Op. 148.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Schumann wrote much in the sonata or symphonic\r\nform, yet his command of it was far from complete. In this respect and\r\nin instrumentation, Schumann was inferior to his romantic contemporary,\r\nMendelssohn. On the other hand, he was far more original and his music\r\nhas a much greater depth of sentiment, a higher sense of beauty and\r\na noble human breadth that forms one of the highest points in the\r\ndevelopment of romanticism. What he lacked in technical attainment,\r\nhe more than made up in beauty of themes, vigor and spontaneity of\r\ntreatment, and thorough-going romanticism in moods. It is difficult to\r\nsay which is his best symphony, they all have merits of their own; of\r\nthe overtures, that to “Genoveva” (almost the only surviving portion of\r\nthe opera) and “Manfred” are examples of Schumann’s ardent romanticism\r\nat its best. The string-quartets are not always in quartet style and\r\ntheir structure is sometimes open to criticism, but they are individual\r\nand contain much that is beautiful. The piano-quartet is a genial work\r\nof great spontaneity that took Europe by storm. It was immediately\r\nhailed as the greatest work since Beethoven, although its position\r\nmight now be assailed by the piano quintets by Brahms and César Franck.\r\nThe piano quartet, as well as the quintet, is a pioneer in this form\r\nof chamber-music, but has not the same flow of melody as the former.\r\nThe trios and sonatas for violin and piano, although not on a level\r\nwith the other chamber-music, have nevertheless striking qualities to\r\ncommend them. Schumann’s choral music is decidedly unequal, but the\r\n“Paradise and the Peri,” and portions of the “Faust” and “Manfred”\r\nmusic display the same breadth of human emotion so characteristic of\r\nhis best music. In the field of song, Schumann is a worthy successor\r\nto Schubert. Schumann’s songs have not the inexhaustible melody of\r\nSchubert’s, but they are richer harmonically, the accompaniments more\r\nindividual, and the character of the poems more subtly brought out.\r\n\r\n=Schumann’s Contribution to the Short Piece=.—Perhaps Schumann’s most\r\nconspicuous service to music lies in his development of the short\r\npiece. In this direction he has cultivated a branch of expression,\r\nwith an originality, a freedom and a richness that have no parallel\r\nin the Romantic movement except in Chopin. Mendelssohn undoubtedly\r\ndid something for the short piece, but his “Songs Without Words” are\r\nlimited to a few types, while Schumann made the short form serve every\r\nvariety of expression. He undoubtedly owed much to the examples of\r\nSchubert with his waltzes and other dances, the impromptus and moments\r\nmusicals, but in richness of resource and spontaneity of expression\r\nhe went much beyond the older master. His piano style is highly\r\ndistinctive; it does not offer much that is new in finger technic, but\r\nin polyphonic treatment of melodies, in striking rhythms and harmonic\r\neffects and in original use of the pedal it is remarkable. Both in the\r\nsets of small pieces, such as the “Papillons,” Op. 2, the “Davidsbund\r\nDances,” Op. 6, the “Carnival,” Op. 9, or the Flower pieces, Op. 19,\r\nand in the Novellettes, Op. 21, the Fantasie pieces, Op. 12, the\r\nSymphonic Studies, Op. 15, the Toccata, Op. 7, and the great Fantasy,\r\nOp. 17, Schumann displays a wealth of imaginative poetry that makes him\r\none of the greatest romanticists in piano music. His piano works from\r\nOp. 2 to Op. 28 are matchless, although the sonatas, Op. 11 and 22,\r\nsuffer from lack of coherence. The variations for two pianos, Op. 46,\r\nand the concerto, Op. 54, are models of their type. The “Album for the\r\nYoung,” Op. 68, the “Forest Scenes,” Op. 82, the “Varied Leaves,” Op.\r\n99, and the “Album Leaves,” Op. 124, are all admirable, and contain a\r\ngreat variety of short pieces, many of which were composed early in his\r\ncareer. Schumann’s songs and piano pieces are the best examples of his\r\ncontribution to romanticism.\r\n\r\nSchubert and Jean Paul Richter (the romantic novelist and poet)\r\nwere the earliest influences in Schumann’s studies, nevertheless he\r\nadmired Beethoven greatly, and shut himself up with his quartets as\r\na preparation for his own chamber-music. As a student in Leipzig, he\r\nwas devoted to Bach’s clavier works, and later in life he renewed\r\nhis enthusiasm for Bach while writing the works for pedal piano and\r\nthe piano fugues. Fugal form and romantic sentiment do not go well\r\ntogether, however, and Schumann’s compositions in this form are not his\r\ngreatest. Schumann’s influence is strongest upon composers of songs\r\nand short piano pieces. It would be difficult to name even the most\r\nrepresentative, but the most signal example is Brahms, whose songs and\r\npiano pieces could hardly exist but for Schumann. In many of the modern\r\nRussian composers we find distinct traces of Schumann, as well as\r\namong the Frenchmen Gabriel Fauré and Vincent d’Indy, the German Adolf\r\nJensen, the Italian Sgambati, and many others.\r\n\r\n=Compositions Suggested for Study=.—The symphonies, overtures, the\r\nchamber-music and the larger choral works are all characteristic\r\nof Schumann at his best, but for more detailed study of his piano\r\nmusic and songs the following are suggested.

Chopin’s romanticism,\r\nsomewhat affected at first by both Hummel and Field, is one of the most\r\nindividual developments of the entire period.\r\n\r\n=Chopin’s Early life=.—Frederic Chopin was born at Zelazowa-Wola, near\r\nWarsaw, in Poland, on March 1, 1809. His father, who had served in\r\nvarious positions as a teacher, finally established a boarding-school\r\nin Warsaw. Chopin showed great sensitiveness towards music at an\r\nearly age. His first lessons on the piano were given him by a Polish\r\nteacher of some celebrity, Adalbert Zwyny. He soon became famous as a\r\npianist, and from the age of nine, played constantly at the houses of\r\nthe nobility, and was eagerly received by them. In 1824, he entered\r\nthe Warsaw Lyceum in order to pursue his general studies. About the\r\nsame time he began lessons in composition with Elsner, who had a high\r\nreputation as a teacher. He had already composed pieces for the piano\r\non his own account, and continued with such success that as early as\r\n1825 his Op. 1, a Rondo, was published. In 1827, he left the Lyceum,\r\nand gave thereafter all his time to playing and composing. Soon after,\r\nhe made great strides in composition, and many of his studies and\r\nsmaller pieces, as well as his two concertos, belong to this period,\r\nor were begun then. Early in 1829, Hummel played in Warsaw, and the\r\ninfluence of his piano style is evident in the works of Chopin for some\r\ntime to come. Later in this year, Chopin went to Vienna, where he gave\r\ntwo concerts, winning instant recognition both as pianist and composer.\r\nAfter his return to Warsaw he continued to compose much.\r\n\r\n=Chopin’s Manhood=.—A second visit to Vienna occurred toward the end\r\nof 1830. He gave concerts, came into contact with many musicians, and\r\neven found time to compose; but being dissatisfied with conditions in\r\nVienna, determined to go to Paris. Early in 1831, after giving concerts\r\non the way, he arrived at Paris, which was henceforth to be his home.\r\nHere he was soon thrown with many of the leading musicians, his playing\r\ncaused an immediate sensation, and as at Warsaw, he was welcomed in\r\nthe most exclusive society. In 1832, he began to acquire fame as a\r\npiano teacher, especially of pupils from the aristocracy. From 1833 to\r\n1835, his compositions began to appear, and gained him much approval\r\nas a composer. In 1835, he went to Leipzig, where he saw Wieck and\r\nhis daughter, afterwards Clara Schumann, Mendelssohn and Schumann. In\r\n1837, he met Madame George Sand, the famous writer, whose influence on\r\nhis life was so great. During this year the first sinister symptoms\r\nof ill-health made their appearance. With the idea of benefiting his\r\nhealth, Chopin passed the winter of 1838-39 on the island of Majorca,\r\nwith Madame Sand and her two children. The climate had a bad effect\r\nupon him; he could compose but little, and the condition of his lungs\r\nobliged a return to France. He was so ill as to be obliged to spend\r\nseveral months at Marseilles, recuperating. After a summer at Nohant,\r\nMme. Sand’s country home, he was again at Paris in the fall of 1839.\r\nFrom 1840 to 1848, he lived in Paris, with occasional visits to Nohant\r\nin the summer, teaching as much as his health would allow, passing much\r\ntime in the most aristocratic society. He seldom played in public,\r\nand would only play for pupils, or when persuaded by devoted friends\r\nto display his extraordinary gifts as a pianist. During these years,\r\nhowever, his health grew more and more precarious.\r\n\r\n=The Last Years of Chopin=.—In 1847, the intimacy of Chopin and Madame\r\nSand came to an end, for various causes, but largely because of a\r\ncharacter caricatured from Chopin in one of Madame Sand’s novels, and\r\nbecause she was tired of taking care of him. Ill as he was, he went\r\nto England, after a farewell concert in Paris, arriving in the spring\r\nof 1848. He gave two concerts in London with some success, besides\r\nplaying at friends’ houses. He went to Scotland at the instance of a\r\npupil, Miss Stirling, gave concerts at Edinburgh and Glasgow, besides\r\none in the interval at Manchester. During this entire tour he suffered\r\ngreatly from ill-health and exhaustion, and after one more appearance\r\nin London, he returned to Paris, exceedingly ill, in January, 1849. He\r\nwas not able to teach and was obliged to depend upon the generosity\r\nof friends; among them his pupil, Miss Stirling. After several months\r\nof hopeless struggle to regain his health, he died of consumption on\r\nOctober 17, 1849, surrounded by devoted friends.\r\n\r\n=Chopin’s Personality=.—Chopin was extremely refined and delicate by\r\nnature. He was fastidious about the color and fit of his clothes,\r\nthe furnishing and arrangement of his rooms, and other details of\r\neveryday life. He was always extremely fond of society and moved\r\nin the highest circles. As a rule, he was averse to seeing much of\r\nmusicians, in spite of his friendship with Liszt, Hiller, Berlioz and\r\nSchumann. As a young man he was fond of dancing, acting and practical\r\njokes; though sensitive, he was well and strong, and able to endure\r\nrough stage-journeys. He was a capital mimic all his life, and a witty\r\ncompanion who pleased by his gentle irony or sarcasm. He was extremely\r\nreserved in spite of his sociability, his intimate friends (either\r\nPolish or favorite pupils) even quarrelled as to which knew him best.\r\nHe was genuinely confidential only in his music. Chopin was exceedingly\r\npatriotic; he was always ready to appear in concert in behalf of Polish\r\nrefugees, he corresponded untiringly with his Polish friends, and gave\r\nmany proofs of his devotion to Poland, which he never forgot in spite\r\nof years of absence.\r\n\r\n=Chopin as Pianist=.—Chopin was a pianist of extraordinary distinction,\r\nin spite of the preëminence of Liszt. His technic, founded in the\r\nschool of Clementi and Cramer, with great attention to Bach, was\r\ninfluenced to some extent by Hummel and Field, but later became highly\r\noriginal, and expressive of great individuality. Although he possessed\r\ngreat brilliancy, the most prominent trait in his playing was its\r\nall-pervading and inexhaustible fund of poetry. It had nothing harsh,\r\nunmelodious or ungraceful. His sense of rhythm was unusually piquant,\r\nand one of its features was the skilful use of _tempo rubato_, a slight\r\nvariance from strict time without disturbing it fundamentally. In later\r\nlife, Chopin became disinclined to appear in public, his performances\r\nwere limited to the drawing-rooms of aristocratic friends, where he\r\nwould play or improvise for hours. He was never a robust pianist at his\r\nstrongest, and the transparent delicacy of his playing during his last\r\nyears was almost incredible.\r\n\r\n=Chopin’s Compositions=.—Chopin’s music constitutes the true revelation\r\nof himself. His life, not full of action, was, however, rich in emotion\r\nand sentiment of great variety and subtlety. Its mainsprings were his\r\npatriotic love of Poland and everything connected with it, and the\r\npoetic impressionability of his temperament, which were all transferred\r\nto his music. Although Chopin composed a number of works in which he\r\nuses the orchestra, some chamber-music, and a set of Polish songs, he\r\nwas first and last a composer for the piano. In addition to the works\r\nreferred to, he wrote three sonatas, four ballades, four scherzos,\r\nten polonaises, fourteen waltzes, twenty-eight studies, fifty-five\r\nmazurkas, twenty-five preludes, seventeen nocturnes, three impromptus\r\nand a fantasie-impromptu, three rondos, besides a superb fantasy, a\r\nconcert allegro, a barcarolle, a berceuse, a tarantelle, a bolero, a\r\nrondo for two pianos, and a few trifles.\r\n\r\nOf his two concertos, the second published (although the first\r\ncomposed) is the finer. It is riper and more poetic, the slow movement\r\nreaches a high point of lyric style, and the treatment of form\r\nthroughout the concerto is less awkward. Chopin is not at home in the\r\nsonata form, the concertos are interesting in spite of, rather than\r\non account of, their treatment of form. The piano sonatas, Op. 35 and\r\n58, have faults of structure, and occasional incoherence, but they are\r\nso full of poetry, romantic melody and dramatic mood that one almost\r\noverlooks their technical shortcomings.\r\n\r\n=Chopin Most Successful in Free Forms=.—The most representative works\r\nof Chopin are those in which he adopts no conventional form, but\r\nfollows his own instinct entirely. Thus, in his ballades, scherzos,\r\nand especially in the fantasy, Op. 49, one finds freedom of invention\r\nand variety of treatment combined with logical development and real\r\ncoherence. The ballads are dramatic poems in which sentiment and\r\nvirtuosity are happily united. The scherzos are original conceptions\r\nquite distinct from the accepted type; they have bold outlines, variety\r\nof mood and demand virtuosity in their performance. The fantasy\r\nis instructive in its logical structure, there is no sign of the\r\nconstraint of the sonatas, and its contents are both dramatic on a\r\nlarge scale and lyric by contrast. The impromptus are shorter pieces\r\nof a lyric nature, although the element of virtuosity is not lacking.\r\nThe nocturnes are lyric pieces of simple form but intimate style.\r\nTheir general plan was at first copied from Field, but the imitator\r\nwent so far ahead of his model as almost to eclipse it. Some of them\r\nportray idyllic moods, others are sentimental or even dramatic in their\r\noutlines. The studies, Op. 10 and 25, epitomize in a remarkable way\r\nChopin’s technical innovations, and piano style. They are brilliant,\r\npoetic and highly dramatic by turns, and in their contents are the most\r\nmusical studies composed up to their time.\r\n\r\n=National Spirit in Chopin’s Music=.—Chopin, the patriot, was devoted\r\nto the dances and Folk-melodies of his own country. He was thoroughly\r\nnational as a composer; hence in some respects his mazurkas and\r\npolonaises are the most characteristic of his compositions. The\r\nmazurkas with their vital rhythms and novel harmonies, contain much\r\npoetry of mood and variety of expression within small limits. The\r\npolonaise, as treated by Chopin, was less a dance form, and more an\r\nindependent form with characteristic rhythms. The polonaises, Op. 44\r\nand 53, are virtually patriotic poems. The preludes are sketches of\r\nvarying size; some are genuine lyrics; some frankly technical in their\r\nobject; others have a distinct touch of the dramatic. Some of the\r\nwaltzes suggest the _salon_, but in others Chopin has individualized\r\nthe type until it has risen above its origin. Among the single\r\npieces, the Concert Allegro is large in dimensions, very interesting\r\ntechnically and musically. The Barcarolle, in nocturne-form on a larger\r\nscale, is almost heroic in its outlines, and a superb example of his\r\nmature style. Another piece equally deserving of distinction is the\r\nBerceuse, an ingenious series of variations on a persistent bass. The\r\nTarantelle and Bolero are merely fascinating salon pieces.\r\n\r\nOf the youthful works with orchestra, the variations on a theme from\r\nMozart’s “Don Juan” are more interesting from the novelty of their\r\npiano styles than as variations; the Fantasie on Polish themes attracts\r\nattention chiefly on account of its Folk-song character, while the\r\n“Krakowiak” rondo is remarkable for its spirited national-dance\r\nrhythms. The orchestral accompaniments to these pieces are not\r\nsignificant; in fact, Chopin’s use of the orchestra was his weakest\r\npoint. The Polish songs are unequal, and at best add little to his\r\nfame. Liszt, however, has transcribed six, of which two are frequently\r\nheard in concert, while Sgambati has arranged one.\r\n\r\n=Originality and Freshness of Invention=.—The most extraordinary trait\r\nof Chopin as a composer is that, in spite of the limitations imposed by\r\nrepeating the same form over and over again, he is almost inexhaustible\r\nin variety of expression. As the poet of lyric mood he accomplished\r\nalmost as much as Schumann for the development of the short piece,\r\nwhile in his longer pieces of dramatic mood and large contours he\r\nhas shown that the sonata-form is not the only structure by which to\r\nconvey heroic sentiment. His was the most subtle originality, the\r\nmost personal style which stamped itself indelibly on nearly every\r\ncomposition. He immeasurably broadened the technical treatment of the\r\npiano, not only as a virtuoso, but in the direction of variety of\r\nexpression, delicate accentuation and exquisite tone. Among romantic\r\ncomposers he has done more for the advancement of piano style than\r\nanyone except Liszt. In spite of the latter’s gigantic achievement,\r\nthe value of Chopin’s contribution is still unimpaired. From the point\r\nof view of expression, Chopin is more individual even than Schumann,\r\nbut the honors as the most important composer for the piano during\r\nthe Romantic period must be divided between them. Chopin’s influence\r\nhas been immense not only on the composers and pianists of France and\r\nGermany but also markedly among living composers in Russia. Chopin is\r\nthe preëminent poet of the piano.\r\n\r\n=Representative Compositions=.—The following list for the student\r\ncontains the works and pieces most thoroughly characteristic of his\r\ngenius: The sonatas, Op. 35 and 38; the scherzos, Op. 20, 31 and 39;\r\nthe ballades, Op. 23, 38, 47 and 52; the polonaises, Op. 22, 26, 40,\r\n44 and 53; the waltzes, Op. 18, Op. 34, Nos. 1 and 2; Op. 42, Op. 64,\r\nNos. 1, 2, and Op. 69, No. 1; the studies, Op. 10, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n5, 6, 7, 10 and 12; Op. 25, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12; the\r\nmazurkas, Op. 6, Nos. 1, 2; Op. 7, Nos. 1, 2, 3; Op. 17, Nos. 2, 3, 4;\r\nOp. 24, Nos. 1, 3, 4; Op. 30, Nos. 2, 4; Op. 33, Nos. 1, 3, 4; Op. 41,\r\nNos. 1, 2; Op. 56, No. 2; Op. 59, Nos. 2 and 3; Op. 63, No. 3; Op. 68,\r\nNo. 2; the nocturnes, Op. 9, Op. 15, Nos, 2, 3; Op. 27, Op. 37, Op. 48,\r\nNo. 1; Op. 55, Op. 62, No. 1; the preludes, Op. 28, Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6, 7,\r\n8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23 and 24; the prelude, Op. 45; the\r\nimpromptus, Op. 29, Op. 35, Op. 51, and the Fantasie-Impromptu, Op. 66;\r\nthe Fantasy, Op. 49; the Tarantelle, Op. 43; the Berceuse, Op. 57; the\r\nBarcarolle, Op. 60, and the Concert Allegro, Op. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove’s and Riemann’s Dictionaries.—Article on Chopin.\r\n\r\nFinck.—Chopin and Other Musical Essays.\r\n\r\nHadow.— Studies in Modern Music.

Notwithstanding their preëminence\r\nin these particulars, a master was destined to come who summed up the\r\nentire development of piano technic in his achievements, the greatest\r\nvirtuoso of the century, to whose influence all piano playing since has\r\nbeen obliged to acknowledge its indebtedness. In addition, his services\r\nin breaking away from symphonic tradition, in achieving propaganda for\r\nvarious composers of epoch-making works, including Wagner, in giving up\r\nhimself as teacher without remuneration, are equally significant.\r\n\r\n=Liszt’s Early Life=.—Franz Liszt was born October 22, 1811, at\r\nRaiding, Hungary. His mother was of Austrian birth; his father, a\r\nHungarian, occupying an official position on the estates of Prince\r\nEsterhazy, was devoted to music. Liszt was a somewhat delicate child\r\nof acute sensibilities, especially in the direction of music. At the\r\nage of six he received piano lessons from his father. The intensity\r\nof his interest in music and his phenomenal progress soon showed the\r\nuncommon extent of his gifts. At the age of nine, he gave his first\r\nconcert before an audience composed largely of Hungarian nobility. His\r\nperformance was so extraordinary that some of those present agreed to\r\ngive Liszt a pension for six years to insure his proper education.\r\nAccordingly, father and son went to Vienna, where the boy studied\r\nthe piano with Carl Czerny and composition with Salieri. Czerny put\r\nLiszt through so thorough a course of discipline that at eleven years\r\nof age Liszt was known for his playing from scores, and reading the\r\nmost difficult compositions at sight. In 1823, he gave two successful\r\nconcerts; Beethoven was present at the second, and publicly kissed the\r\nboy in token of his approval. Liszt’s father now took him to Paris\r\nto study at the Conservatory, but the director, Cherubini, refused\r\nto allow him to enter because he was a foreigner. Liszt studied\r\ncomposition, however, with Paer and afterwards with Reicha. In the\r\nmeantime, letters of introduction from Liszt’s Hungarian patrons soon\r\nsufficed to make him known throughout the most aristocratic circles,\r\nwhere he created an absolute furore. A public concert produced the same\r\nresults on a larger scale. Later, Liszt made two visits to England; he\r\nwas received at the Court of George IV, played in private, and gave\r\nconcerts. On returning to Paris, he completed an opera, which was\r\nperformed in Paris. This opera and other compositions of this period\r\nhave entirely disappeared. Tours through France and a third visit to\r\nEngland followed. In 1827, Liszt’s father died, and his mother came\r\nto Paris to live; he supported her by giving lessons, and was soon in\r\ngreat demand as a teacher. An unfortunate love-affair caused him to\r\nconsider entering the church. He lost interest in music, fell ill,\r\nand was supposed to be dead. Liszt gradually recovered, however.\r\nHe now underwent a remarkable series of formative influences; he\r\nread widely, formed the acquaintance of many celebrated personages,\r\nincluding Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Victor Hugo and George Sand, became\r\ninterested in the principles of St. Simonians, a somewhat socialistic\r\nsect, dallied with free-thinking and revolutionary tendencies, formed\r\na friendship with the Abbé Lamennais, and became intimate with Berlioz\r\nand Chopin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ LISZT.]\r\n\r\n=Period of Preparation=.—Of far deeper result was the appearance of\r\nPaganini in Paris during 1831. Liszt bent all his energies towards\r\ndevising a transcendent piano technic to reproduce Paganini’s caprices\r\non the piano. It was at this time that he laid the foundations of his\r\ngigantic achievements in piano technic, not merely in the interest of\r\nvirtuosity, but for extending the limits of expression. He was also\r\nmuch affected by Chopin’s poetic individuality. In 1834, Liszt entered\r\ninto an intimacy with the Comtesse d’Agoult, which lasted for several\r\nyears. Three children were born of this union, of whom two survived.\r\nOne daughter married M. Ollivier, a French statesman, the other became\r\nsuccessively Mme. von Bülow and Mme. Wagner. During this period Liszt\r\ncomposed much for piano, made many transcriptions, and began his\r\nliterary activity on musical subjects. He gave concerts, chiefly for\r\ncharity. In 1837, he made a trip to Paris to contest the supremacy of\r\nthe piano with Thalberg. Among his compositions of this period may be\r\nmentioned the etudes, the Rossini transcriptions, many arrangements of\r\nSchubert’s songs, the piano scores of several Beethoven symphonies,\r\nbesides opera-fantasies, original pieces for piano, etc.\r\n\r\n=Professional Activity=.—In 1838, Liszt created an extraordinary\r\nsensation by his concerts in Vienna, and from 1839 to 1847 lived\r\nthe life of a traveling virtuoso, giving an unparalleled series of\r\nrecitals throughout the length and breadth of Europe, which were a\r\nseries of triumphs such as no artist had ever before experienced. In\r\n1832, he was made court music-director at Weimar, his duties only\r\nrequiring his presence for three months in the year. In 1847, Liszt\r\nmet the Princess von Sayn-Wittgenstein, who exercised a remarkable\r\ninfluence over him. She persuaded him to give up his career as a\r\nvirtuoso, and turn to composition. From 1848 to 1861 Liszt passed the\r\nmost significant period of his life at Weimar. From his position as\r\nconductor he was of inestimable service to the cause of romantic music\r\nthrough his performance of operas and orchestral works by Wagner,\r\nBerlioz, Schumann, Raff, Cornelius and others. He was equally active\r\nwith his pen in deference to the new artistic principles. To this epoch\r\nbelong Liszt’s most important orchestral works, the concertos and other\r\ncompositions for piano and orchestra, many transcriptions and editions\r\nof the classics.\r\n\r\n=Later Life=.—In 1859, opposition to Liszt’s progressiveness became so\r\npronounced that he resigned. He did not leave Weimar, however, until\r\n1861. The rest of his life was somewhat irregularly divided between\r\nRome, Weimar and Budapest. During the first few years at Rome he\r\ncomposed chiefly church music and oratorios; in 1865, he took minor\r\norders in the Church of Rome. From 1869 on, persuaded by the Duke and\r\nDuchess of Saxe-Weimar, he passed portions of every year at Weimar in\r\na beautiful house especially furnished for him by the Duke. Pupils\r\nflocked to him, he held a sort of musical court, and was treated with\r\nthe respect due to royalty. His later years were full of activity,\r\nand generous sympathy to all that was worthy, and he was the constant\r\nobject of homage and affection. In 1886, Liszt became overtaxed by a\r\nseries of trips to hear his own works performed, including a reception\r\nin his honor at London. He also made exceptional effort to attend a\r\nperformance of “Tristan and Isolde” at Bayreuth. A cold was speedily\r\nfollowed by pneumonia, from which he died on July 31, 1886.\r\n\r\n=Liszt’s Personality and Character=.—Liszt’s character was remarkable\r\nfor its conspicuous virtues and almost equally prominent faults. His\r\nwas a large, noble nature, with deep humanitarian traits. His life was\r\none long service to his art, accompanied in his later years by devotion\r\nto the church. Though not highly educated, except in experience of men\r\nand the world, he had an extremely keen mind, omnivorous in its tastes,\r\nand his interests were wide and penetrating. Perhaps his salient\r\ncharacteristics were generosity and unselfishness. Often during his\r\ncareer as a virtuoso he gave freely of the proceeds of his concerts\r\nto charity. After the close of his concert-tours he taught for years\r\nwithout remuneration. His help to younger artists was incalculable\r\nin its extent. As conductor at Weimar his motto was to help living\r\ncomposers first, and by his energy he did valiant work in helping\r\nWagner’s cause. Largely endowed with wit, a fund of irony and charm of\r\nmanner, men and women alike almost literally fell at his feet, and it\r\nis all the more admirable that in spite of the homage so unsparingly\r\nlavished upon him, he did not swerve from his artistic purposes. The\r\nstrain of mysticism so marked in his youth, became later so pronounced\r\nthat he felt compelled to give it expression by entering the church.\r\n\r\n=Liszt as a Pianist=.—Liszt was the most phenomenal pianist in\r\nthe history of music. Other pianists have surpassed him in single\r\nqualities, but no one has united in so stupendous fashion as much\r\nas he. Beginning with a strictly classical education, Liszt evolved\r\na new technic which completely summed up the difficulties of piano\r\nplaying. In velocity, wide stretches, double-notes, octaves, and a\r\nwhole system in itself of interlocking passages, he all but attained\r\nthe impossible. He carried independence of fingers, especially in fugue\r\nplaying, to a pitch hitherto unequalled. His performance of brilliant\r\nmusic represented the last word in bravura; in the classics his\r\ninterpretation was, as Wagner says: “not reproduction, but production,”\r\nso vivid and glowing was it. His so-called “orchestral style” in its\r\nbold color and rich pedal effects was as distinct from the piano\r\nplaying before him as the modern orchestra was from that of Mozart\r\nand Haydn. As he assimilated everything in the field of piano playing\r\nbefore him, so has everything since him been forced to take his method\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\n=Liszt’s Compositions=.—Among Liszt’s chief compositions are the\r\n“Faust” and “Dante” symphonies, with choral epilogues; twelve symphonic\r\npoems, a form which he invented, and which is epoch-making in the\r\ndevelopment of music; many shorter orchestral works; two concertos,\r\nthe Hungarian fantasy, the “Dance of Death” for piano and orchestra,\r\nbesides several compositions for the same combination on themes of\r\nother composers; the oratorios “St. Elizabeth” and “Christus,” a\r\nSolemn Mass, the Hungarian Coronation Mass, several other masses,\r\ntwelve sacred hymns for chorus, five psalms, and many other pieces\r\nof church music, choruses for men’s voices, several compositions for\r\nsolos, chorus and orchestra for various festival occasions; fifty-five\r\nsongs for voice with piano accompaniment; three collections containing\r\ntwenty-five pieces for piano, entitled “Years of Pilgrimage,” a\r\ncollection of the piano pieces named “Poetic and Religious Harmonies,”\r\ntwelve “Etudes of Transcendent Technic,” three concert studies, a\r\nsonata, two ballades, two “Legends,” a concert solo, afterwards\r\narranged as a “Pathetic” concerto, a Valse Impromptu, two polonaises,\r\nsix Consolations, a Spanish Rhapsody, and nineteen Hungarian Rhapsodies\r\nare the best known of the piano music. There are five ballades for\r\ndeclamation with piano accompaniment. For organ, there is a fantasy and\r\nfugue on a choral from Meyerbeer’s “Prophet,” a fugue on B. A. C. H.,\r\nand variations on a theme from a Bach cantata.\r\n\r\n=Liszt’s Arrangements=.—Of almost equal importance with Liszt’s\r\noriginal compositions are his matchless transcriptions. Instead of a\r\ntrivial and literal process of transcribing, he penetrated the intimate\r\nspirit of the piece, and translated it into his own piano idiom, often\r\nadding considerably but always with supreme artistic effect. What is\r\nlost in fidelity of transfer is more than gained in added charm, new\r\nharmonic significance and a subtle enhancing of individuality. Liszt\r\nstarted the evolution of his epoch-making technic while experimenting\r\nwith his arrangement of Paganini’s caprices, and of Berlioz’ “Fantastic\r\nSymphony.” He made easy arrangements from operas of Rossini, Mercadante\r\nand Donizetti. Then he turned to setting Schubert’s matchless songs for\r\nthe piano, arranging in all fifty-seven; he continued by making piano\r\nscores of Beethoven’s symphonies, of Rossini’s overture to “William\r\nTell,” and to Weber’s overtures “Jubilee,” “Freischütz” and “Oberon.”\r\nHe also made many transcriptions from Wagner’s operas, including “The\r\nFlying Dutchman,” “Tannhäuser,” “Lohengrin,” “Die Meistersinger,”\r\n“Tristan and Isolde” and “Parsifal,” besides a fantasy on themes from\r\n“Rienzi,” and an arrangement of the “Walhalla” motive from “The Ring of\r\nthe Nibelungs.” Liszt’s arrangements of six preludes and fugues as well\r\nas the fantasy and fugue in G minor by Bach are not only remarkable for\r\nthe extent to which they reproduce organ-effect, but as pioneers in the\r\ntransfer of organ pieces to the piano, in which Liszt has been followed\r\nby Tausig, d’Albert and Busoni. In addition he transcribed fourteen\r\nsongs by Schumann, thirteen by Franz, eight by Mendelssohn, seven by\r\nBeethoven, six by Chopin and two by Weber, besides an arrangement from\r\nMendelssohn’s music to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and “piano scores”\r\nof the septets by Beethoven and Hummel. Liszt arranged Weber’s “Polacca\r\nBrillante,” Op. 72, and Schubert’s Fantasy, Op. 15, for piano and\r\norchestra. There are also many transcriptions of pieces by Palestrina,\r\nDi Lasso, Arcadelt, Mozart, Glinka, Dargomischky, Saint-Saëns, Verdi,\r\nRaff, Gounod, Rubinstein, Tchaikovsky, César Cui and others. Liszt\r\nscored the accompaniment of several Schubert songs for orchestra, he\r\nalso orchestrated several of the Schubert four-hand marches. He also\r\narranged many of his own songs, orchestral and choral works for piano\r\nand for organ. His transcriptions as a whole are monumental not only on\r\naccount of their artistic merit, but because they served an educational\r\npurpose in spreading the works of little known composers. In this way\r\nLiszt cultivated the public taste for Schubert’s songs, and brought\r\nWagner within the reach of the average concert-goer.\r\n\r\n=Liszt as Writer=.—As a critic, Liszt must stand as a pioneer although\r\nin a different direction from Schumann. Liszt’s early essay on the\r\nposition of the artist is extremely significant; his criticisms during\r\nthe Weimar period, especially his analyses of Wagner’s operas were\r\nof great value; his “Life of Chopin,” while untrustworthy in detail\r\nand somewhat overdrawn, is nevertheless graphic; “The Gipsies and\r\nTheir Music” is picturesque if not entirely accurate. Liszt’s letters\r\ncontain glimpses of his high qualities as well as vital presentations\r\nof his musical views. The correspondence between Wagner and Liszt gives\r\nconclusive evidence of the latter’s unselfishness in Wagner’s behalf.\r\n\r\n=Liszt’s Position and Influence as a Composer=.—Liszt’s rank as a\r\ncomposer was undoubtedly overshadowed by his fame as a pianist and\r\nteacher, and by his facility as an arranger. For many years neither\r\ncritics nor public would acknowledge his creative gifts. Whatever our\r\nopinion of the symphonies, the symphonic poems and the concertos,\r\nthere is no doubt that Liszt rendered an inestimable service to the\r\ndevelopment of music in breaking away from the sonata form, and in\r\ndemonstrating that form and substance can go hand-in-hand without\r\ndetriment to organic unity and coherence. His forms are novel, his\r\norchestration highly effective in spite of the achievements of Berlioz\r\nand Wagner in this direction. Liszt’s church music and his oratorios\r\nare worthy efforts towards a reform of ecclesiastic music. His songs\r\nare truly spontaneous lyrics, which are not appreciated at their true\r\nvalue. In spite of Liszt’s unquestioned attainments as a composer,\r\nthere is a suggestion of skilful assimilation in his individuality\r\nrather than of unique and unquestioned personality. Nevertheless his\r\ninfluence has been vast. In his old age he encouraged Borodin and\r\nGlazounoff, he conducted works by Rimsky-Korsakoff, he made his pupils\r\nplay Balakireff’s “Islamey.” In turn, the “new-Russian” school owes\r\nmuch to him. Tchaikovsky could hardly have written his symphonic poems\r\nwithout Liszt’s pioneer work to show the way. Saint-Saëns admits a\r\nsimilar influence. In fact, the entire development of the symphonic\r\npoem is directly due to Liszt; it is so considerable in extent that\r\nthe details cannot be examined here, but while both Wagner and Berlioz\r\ncontributed much to the growth of orchestral style and individuality\r\nof expression, the originality of the symphonic poem form belongs\r\nentirely to Liszt. Thus Liszt’s share in the evolution of ultra-modern\r\norchestral music, as well as in the development of piano playing, is\r\nvery important, and the greatest living composer, Richard Strauss,\r\nalthough also influenced by both Berlioz and Wagner, frankly avows\r\nhimself to be a disciple of Liszt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nGrove’s and Riemann’s Dictionaries.—Article on Liszt.\r\n\r\nNewman.—A Study of Liszt.

They require, however, a technic beyond the average player.\r\nThe same difficulty applies to his piano music, but the following\r\nmay serve as guides to Liszt’s style: The “Lake of Wallenstadt,” and\r\n“Eclogue,” Nos. 2 and 7, in the Swiss “Years of Pilgrimage”; the\r\n“Gondoliera” and “Tarantelle” from “Venice and Naples,” the “Valse\r\nImpromptu,” “Ave Maria,” “Waldesrauschen” and “Gnomenreigen,” the\r\npieces for Lebert and Stark’s Piano School, the Concert Studies in\r\nF minor and D-flat, the Love Dreams, the Consolations, Nos. 1, 2\r\nand 4; the Legends, the “Benediction of God in the Solitude” and\r\n“Love Song” from “Poetic and Religious Harmonies,” and the Fantasie\r\non “Rigoletto.” For the more advanced player may be suggested the\r\nEtudes, Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 12; the Mephisto Waltz, the Second\r\nBallad, “Au Bord d’une Source” from the Swiss “Years of Pilgrimage,”\r\nthe Second Polonaise, the “Funerailles” from “Poetic and Religious\r\nHarmonies,” the Sonata, the Hungarian Rhapsodies, Nos. 2, 4, 6, 10,\r\n11, 12, 15, and the Spanish Rhapsody; the two concertos in E-flat and\r\nA, the Hungarian Fantasy, and the concert piece “The Dance of Death,”\r\nthe Fantasy on “Don Juan.” Among the transcriptions, the Schubert\r\nsongs, “Hark! Hark! the Lark,” “Du bist die Ruh,” “Frühlingsglaube,”\r\n“The Wanderer,” “By the Sea,” “Meeresstille,” “Barcarolle,” “Trockne\r\nBlumen,” “Wohin,” “Ungeduld,” “Erl-King”; the Mendelssohn song, “On\r\nWings of Song”; the Schumann songs, “Dedication,” “To the Sunshine,”\r\nand “Spring Night”; the Weber “Slumber Song” may be suggested. Of the\r\nWagner arrangements, “The Evening Star”, from Tannhäuser, the “Spinning\r\nSong,” from “The Flying Dutchman,” and “Isolde’s Love Death,” are the\r\nmost characteristic. The Paganini Studies, Nos. 2, 3 and 5; the waltz\r\nfrom Gounod’s “Faust,” the Tarantelle after Auber, and the Overture\r\nto “Tannhäuser” are among the best. Of the songs, “Mignon’s Lied” and\r\n“Ueber allen Gipfeln,” “Comment disaient-ils,” “Angiolin dal biondo\r\ncrin,” “Es muss ein wunderbares sein,” “Die drei Zigeuner,” and “Der du\r\nvon dem Himmel bist” and “Die Lorelei” are the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LESSON XLVII.\r\n\r\n                 PIANISTS AND TEACHERS SINCE LISZT. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Introduction=.—The achievements of Liszt in developing piano\r\ntechnic, in enlarging the scope of piano playing through his masterly\r\ntranscriptions, in variety and intensity of interpretation, have\r\nbrought results that are enormous in extent and far-reaching in their\r\ndevelopments to the generations that have succeeded him. When Liszt\r\nwas in the height of his career as a virtuoso, few could master the\r\ndifficulties which his epoch-making works presented. Gradually the\r\nsecrets of his technic were revealed to the ambitious few; now they are\r\nalmost common property. The great concert pianists of today possess\r\na technic that would have been unique forty years ago. The repertory\r\nwhich all pianists worthy the name play from memory (a practice\r\nwhich Liszt initiated) is exceedingly extensive, while the endurance\r\nwhich they display and the facility with which they reproduce the\r\nmasterpieces of piano literature is stupendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PUPILS OF LISZT.\r\n\r\nLiszt was undoubtedly the greatest revealer of the secrets of piano\r\nplaying in the 19th century, and his pupils and those who have\r\nassimilated his teachings occupy a large part of the pianistic activity\r\nof today. Among the first of Liszt’s pupils to become famous were\r\nTausig and von Bülow. =Carl Tausig=, born in 1841, died in 1871, was\r\ntrained by his father, and later studied with Liszt, under whose\r\nguidance he achieved a phenomenal accuracy of technic, and a commanding\r\npower of interpretation. His short life was spent mainly in concert\r\ntours. He established a school of music in Berlin for advanced piano\r\nplaying. His untimely death cut short a brilliant career. His edition\r\nof Clementi’s _Gradus_ and a collection of finger exercises are\r\ninvaluable to teachers and to students. =Hans von Bülow=, born in 1830,\r\ndied 1894, was intended for the law, although he studied the piano\r\nas a boy under Friedrich Wieck. In 1850, he became so absorbed in\r\nWagner’s music that he abandoned all idea of the law. He studied the\r\npiano with Liszt at Weimar, and soon acquired a remarkable technic. He\r\nwas never a pianist of the virtuoso type; his strength lay in striving\r\nto reproduce the intention of the composer as faithfully as possible.\r\nHis interpretations of Beethoven were especially famous, although he\r\nwas progressive in his tastes. In 1876, he made a tour in the United\r\nStates, where he did much to advance the cause of new music. As early\r\nas 1865 he conducted performances of Wagner’s operas, and later his\r\nassociation with orchestras at Meiningen and of the Berlin Philharmonic\r\nSociety placed his reputation as a conductor in the front rank. He was\r\nextremely energetic in Wagner’s behalf and did much to bring his works\r\nto a public hearing. His editions of Cramer’s studies and Beethoven’s\r\nsonatas are of great value.\r\n\r\nAmong Liszt’s later pupils, one of the foremost is =Eugen D’Albert=,\r\nborn in 1864. He received his early training in England, but in 1881,\r\nas a prize scholar, he studied with Liszt at Weimar. After brilliant\r\nconcert tours through Europe, he came to America, in 1889, with\r\nSarasate, where his ability was at once recognized. He has since\r\nlargely renounced the career of virtuoso for that of composer, although\r\nhe made a visit to the United States in 1905, giving a number of\r\nrecitals.\r\n\r\n=Moritz Rosenthal=, possibly the most fully equipped virtuoso\r\ntechnically now before the public, was born in 1862. At first a\r\npupil of Mikuli, a disciple of Chopin, and later of Joseffy, he came\r\nultimately to Liszt, with whom he studied for ten years. After numerous\r\nEuropean tours he came to the United States in 1888, where he dazzled\r\nhis audiences by his unusual command of technic. He reappeared in\r\nAmerica in 1896-97, and has since made triumphal progress through\r\nEurope. As an interpreter he is less successful than as a virtuoso.\r\nHe is court pianist of Roumania. He has published a collection of\r\ntechnical exercises with Ludwig Schytté.\r\n\r\n=Bernhard Stavenhagen=, born in 1862, is another noted Liszt pupil.\r\nHe acted as Liszt’s secretary during his later years, and at the same\r\ntime received lessons. In 1890, he became court pianist at Weimar. In\r\n1894-95, he visited America. Since then he has acted as conductor at\r\nDresden and Munich.\r\n\r\n=Emil Sauer=, another phenomenal pupil of Liszt, was born in 1862.\r\nAt first a pupil of Nicholas Rubinstein, he studied with Liszt from\r\n1884 until the latter’s death. He possesses an extraordinary technic,\r\nand is almost unrivalled for the extreme brilliancy of his effects.\r\nHe has received many decorations from various courts of Europe. In\r\n1897-98, he visited the United States, where he made a sensation. Since\r\n1901, he has been at the head of the piano department in the Vienna\r\nConservatory, giving his attention to pupils in the artist department.\r\n\r\nAmong other talented pupils of Liszt may be mentioned Alfred\r\nReisenauer, Arthur Friedheim and Richard Burmeister, all of whom have\r\nbeen heard in this country. The foregoing account does not begin to\r\nenumerate all, merely the celebrated pupils of Liszt. Others will be\r\nreferred to in the course of this and the next lesson.\r\n\r\n=Belgian Pianists=.—In piano playing, the Brussels Conservatory\r\nis far below the level of the Paris Conservatory, although the\r\ndirector =Gevaërt= has a world-wide reputation for his text-book on\r\norchestration, and the symphony concerts at the conservatory, led\r\nby him, have a high place in orchestral standards. Nevertheless, in\r\nthe piano department two names deserve mention: Brassin and Dupont.\r\n=Louis Brassin= (1840-1884) studied at the Leipzig Conservatory under\r\nMoscheles, where he remained five years, winning numerous prizes. In\r\n1866, he became first piano teacher at the Stern Conservatory in\r\nBerlin. Later he joined the Brussels Conservatory, as professor of\r\npiano playing, where he taught from 1869-1878. In 1879, he accepted a\r\nposition at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he remained until\r\nhis death, in 1884. Brassin was not only known as a fine pianist\r\nand teacher, but also by his transcriptions from “The Ring of the\r\nNibelung.” He also composed piano pieces and even two operettas.\r\n=Auguste Dupont= (1828-1890) studied at the Liége Conservatory. After\r\nseveral years of wandering life, he became professor of piano at the\r\nBrussels Conservatory, a position which he held until his death, in\r\n1890. He is known also as a composer of graceful piano pieces, a\r\nconcerto and a concert-piece, in all of which the influence of Schumann\r\nis seen.\r\n\r\n=Johannes Brahms= (1833-1897), famed both as composer and pianist,\r\nwas the son of an orchestral musician in Hamburg, whose circumstances\r\nwere of the humblest. As a child he developed remarkable ability as a\r\npianist, but his first lessons in composition awakened an enthusiasm\r\nthat absorbed his entire being. He was comparatively unknown when at\r\nthe age of twenty Schumann brought him into public notice by hailing\r\nhim as the successor of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nUnlike most composers, Brahms was mature from the very beginning.\r\nHis early works bear no trace of the uncertainty and imitation\r\ngenerally associated with youth, and it was this remarkable maturity\r\nthat interested Schumann and gave point to his predictions for the\r\nfuture of the young musician. Unaffected by the pomp and glow of\r\nthe ultra-romantic tendency initiated by Berlioz and culminating at\r\npresent in the works of Richard Strauss, he remained true to the great\r\nclassical school which rests on Bach and Palestrina. Unlike the modern\r\nimpressionistic school, his art is based on essentially musical ideas\r\nand their contrapuntal treatment; it is architectural rather than\r\npictorial. In such a scheme, color is subordinate to thematic interest,\r\nhence his instrumentation often appears heavy and austere to those who\r\nlook for the brilliancy and tone painting of Liszt or Wagner. His music\r\nin general is founded on Bach and Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHANNES BRAHMS.]\r\n\r\nHis works for the piano are large and orchestral in style, and demand\r\na technic of their own, which was at first considered unsuited to the\r\nnature of the instrument. Von Bülow remarks that while in Bach we hear\r\nthe organ, in Beethoven the orchestra, in Brahms we hear both organ and\r\norchestra. Notwithstanding their dignity and nobility of conception,\r\nthey won their way but slowly to favor. Their newness of style and\r\ndifficulty of execution estranged both public and musicians. Though\r\nBrahms’ four symphonies have become reasonably familiar, his piano\r\nworks have not even yet achieved widespread popularity. They comprise\r\ntwo concertos, three sonatas, many variations, and a host of smaller\r\npieces—ballades, scherzos, intermezzos, capriccios, etc. Brahms never\r\nwrote for the stage but was active in all other departments of music.\r\nHis greatest choral work is the “German Requiem,” composed in memory\r\nof his mother, to texts selected by himself from the Scriptures and\r\nsung in German, instead of in Latin, hence its name. He drew no little\r\ninspiration from the Folk-song, which he uses not only in the form\r\nof harmonies and rhythms distinctly based on Folk melodies, but in\r\nliteral quotations serving as themes in several of his instrumental\r\ncompositions. This contact with the people through their songs gives\r\nparticular freshness and vigor to much of Brahms’ music, as well as a\r\nsturdy Teutonic character that stamps it as distinctively national in\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps too soon to deliver an authoritative judgment as to the\r\nultimate rank that Brahms will take among the great composers of the\r\npast. There is no doubt, however, that he is one of the commanding\r\nfigures of the last century and that he has enriched the world with\r\na mass of noble music, all of which deserves to be known for its\r\nelevation and consummate mastery of detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUSSIAN PIANISTS.\r\n\r\nOf a somewhat independent development from Liszt, although much\r\ninfluenced by his personality and his method, was =Anton Rubinstein=,\r\nborn in 1829, died in 1894. He studied the piano at Moscow with\r\nVilloing, who gave him so thorough a training that he had no other\r\nteacher. From 1840, after concerts in Paris, he had universal\r\nrecognition as a pianist. Further European tours increased his fame.\r\nHe lived successively in Berlin and Vienna, and later returned to St.\r\nPetersburg. In 1872-73, he made a remarkable tour through America,\r\narousing an enthusiasm only equalled in later years by Paderewski.\r\nAlthough he passed most of his life in constant activity as a composer,\r\nhe directed the Russian Symphony Concerts in St. Petersburg. As\r\nearly as 1862 he founded the St. Petersburg Conservatory, which has\r\nhad a prominent place in Russian music. He was a complete master\r\nof the piano, his technic was gigantic, although his vitality of\r\ninterpretation was so intense that details paled before it. His\r\nhistorical recitals covering the entire literature of the piano were\r\nhis most conspicuous achievements as a pianist. He may be regarded as\r\nsecond only to Liszt, and in some respects he even surpassed him. He\r\nwas disappointed at not being accorded high rank as a composer, as well\r\nas a pianist.\r\n\r\nHis brother, =Nicholas Rubinstein=, born in 1835, died in 1881,\r\nalthough not so distinguished a pianist, and a composer of slight\r\naccount, exerted almost as strong an influence on Russian music. A\r\npupil of Kullak, he founded the Russian Musical Society at Moscow, in\r\n1859, and in 1864 the Moscow Conservatory, which has been exceedingly\r\nactive in Russian musical affairs. He directed the Moscow Conservatory\r\nuntil his death; he was an intimate adviser of Tchaikovsky, while his\r\nworth as a teacher may be guessed from the prominence of his pupils,\r\nKarl Klindworth, Emil Sauer and Alexander Siloti, possibly the foremost\r\nRussian pianist today.\r\n\r\n=Mili Balakireff=, born in 1836, has been a considerable force in\r\nRussian music, besides being a capable pianist. After studying physics\r\nand mathematics at the University of Kazan, he turned to music. In\r\n1862, he founded a Free School of Music in St. Petersburg. Among\r\nhis associates were César Cui, Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakoff, Alexander\r\nBorodine and others. He has done much to aid the Neo-Russian school\r\nof composition. His piano music is effective and highly colored,\r\nespecially his fantasy on Georgian themes, “Islamey.”\r\n\r\n=Alexander Siloti=, undoubtedly the most widely-known of Russian\r\npianists, born at Charcow, 1863, was a pupil in piano playing of\r\nNicholas Rubinstein, at the Moscow Conservatory. From 1883-1886, he\r\nstudied with Liszt. His technic is enormous; while not intensely\r\nmagnetic, his intellectual grasp of music is remarkable. He made an\r\nAmerican tour in 1898, when he introduced much Russian piano music that\r\nwas new. Although Siloti has taught at the Moscow Conservatory, he has\r\nlived of late years at Leipzig and Paris.\r\n\r\nAmong other Russian pianists are =Vassili Sapellnikoff=, born 1868, a\r\npupil of Kessler, Louis Brassin, Sophie Menter; =Vassili Safonoff=, a\r\npupil of Leschetizky and Zaremba in St. Petersburg, since 1887 director\r\nof the Moscow Conservatory, and more lately a conductor; =Sergei\r\nRachmaninoff=, born 1873, a pupil of Siloti, not only a brilliant\r\npianist but also a composer of originality; =Alexander Scriabine=, born\r\n1872, a pupil of Safonoff, who has made successful European tours, and\r\nlike Rachmaninoff, has composed much for his instrument.\r\n\r\nTwo German pianists, Henselt and Klindworth, were so associated with\r\nRussian music as to warrant their mention here. =Adolph Henselt=, born\r\n1814, died 1889, at one time a pupil of Hummel, was for the most part\r\nself-taught. He passed most of his life in St. Petersburg, giving\r\nlessons and playing frequently in public. He also had an official\r\nposition as music inspector. As a pianist, Henselt was exceedingly\r\neminent, and may be ranked next to Rubinstein and von Bülow, although\r\nin later years nervousness prevented his playing in public. His etudes\r\nare distinct additions to the technical resources of the piano, his\r\narrangements of Cramer etudes with second piano accompaniment are\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\n=Karl Klindworth=, born 1830, was a pupil of Nicholas Rubinstein and\r\nlater, of Liszt. After living in London, he became professor of piano\r\nplaying at the Moscow Conservatory, from 1868-1884. Later he settled\r\nin Berlin, became conductor of the Philharmonic Society, and opened a\r\nconservatory with von Bülow, which was merged with that of Scharwenka\r\nin 1893. Klindworth’s edition of Chopin is in some respects the best.\r\nHe has also edited Beethoven’s sonatas, and he prepared the piano score\r\nof the entire “Ring of the Nibelung.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRENCH PIANISTS.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the famous French pianists, =Charles Henri Valentine\r\nAlkan=, born 1813, died 1888, must not be forgotten. A brilliant\r\npianist, he claims our attention chiefly on account of his etudes,\r\nintroducing novel and extremely difficult problems of technic.\r\nMusically his studies cannot be compared with those of Chopin or Liszt,\r\nbut they merit attention, particularly in the modern editions.\r\n\r\nAlthough =Camille Saint-Saëns= is known chiefly as a composer, he was,\r\nduring his early years, a remarkable pianist. His contributions to\r\npiano literature, five concertos, etudes and smaller pieces, are all\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nA group of Paris Conservatory professors constitute the most\r\ndistinguishing teaching talent in France today. Further than that,\r\nParis is one of the great centres of piano playing in Europe. Its\r\nteachers follow their own traditions, yet have assimilated from Liszt.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these is =Georges Mathias= (b. 1826), pupil of Chopin,\r\nKalkbrenner and the Paris Conservatory, who has been professor of piano\r\nplaying since 1862. =E. Delaborde=, a pupil of Alkan, Moscheles and\r\nLiszt, has taught at the Paris Conservatory since 1873. One of the most\r\nsuccessful teachers now living is =Louis Dièmer=, born 1843, a pupil\r\nof Marmontel. Winning the first piano prize at the age of thirteen,\r\nhe succeeded his former teacher in 1888. Dièmer has turned out many\r\nfirst prizes; he has an impeccable technic; he has done much to foster\r\ninterest in the harpsichord, the oboe d’amore and other obsolete\r\ninstruments. He has published valuable collections of old French\r\nharpsichord music, besides original works. A Conservatory teacher\r\nwell-known in America is =Raoul Pugno=, born 1852. A pupil of the\r\nParis Conservatory, he obtained first prizes in piano playing, organ\r\nand harmony. He came to America in 1897-98 with Ysaye and others, and\r\nagain in 1902. He has taught at the Paris Conservatory since 1897. He\r\nhas a superb technic, and is versatile as an interpreter. He has also\r\ncomposed much. A teacher of unusual insight into technic is =Isidor\r\nPhilipp=, born 1863, a pupil of Mathias, Saint-Saëns and others. He\r\npossesses a flawlessly accurate technic, and has appeared frequently\r\nin public, although he devotes the greater part of his energy to\r\nteaching. He has published many valuable sets of exercises, collections\r\nof difficult passages, some transcriptions and original pieces. He has\r\nbeen professor at the Conservatory since 1904.\r\n\r\n=Louis Breitner=, a pupil of the Milan Conservatory, Anton Rubinstein\r\nand Liszt, has lived for many years at Paris as pianist and teacher. He\r\nalso has visited America. Among the younger French pianists are =Leon\r\nDelafosse=, =Edouard Risler=, an eclectic pianist, a pupil of Dièmer,\r\nD’Albert and Stavenhagen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                REFERENCES FOR LESSONS XLVII AND XLVIII.\r\n\r\nFay.—Music Study in Germany.\r\n\r\nWalker.—My Musical Memories.\r\n\r\nLahee.—Pianists of the Past and Present.\r\n\r\nGrove’s Dictionary.—Article on Pianoforte Players.\r\n\r\nFinck.—Paderewski and His Art.\r\n\r\nLeschetizky.—Autobiography.\r\n\r\nMason.—Memories of a Musical Life.\r\n\r\nLenz.—The Great Virtuosos of our Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho were the earliest of Liszt’s pupils?\r\n\r\nName some later pupils of Liszt.\r\n\r\nWho are the leading exponents of the Belgian school?\r\n\r\nWhose principles did Brahms follow?\r\n\r\nWhat are the characteristics of his works?\r\n\r\nWhat was Anton Rubinstein’s chief characteristic as a pianist?\r\n\r\nWhom did Nicholas Rubinstein assist greatly?\r\n\r\nBy what piano piece is Balakireff best known?\r\n\r\nWhat Russian pianist has visited America?\r\n\r\nName two young Russian composer pianists.\r\n\r\nGive some account of Henselt.\r\n\r\nWho made the piano score of Wagner’s “Ring of the Nibelung”?\r\n\r\nName some successful teachers of the piano at the Paris Conservatory.\r\nWhich one has twice visited America?

II.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest living teachers in authority and breadth of\r\ninfluence is =Theodor Leschetizky=, born in 1831. A pupil of Czerny,\r\nhe began to teach at the age of fifteen, having played in public since\r\n1842. He became a teacher in the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where\r\nhe taught for many years. Soon after 1880 he settled in Vienna, where\r\nhe has lived ever since. Since the success of his pupil Paderewski,\r\nLeschetizky has been the most sought-after teacher in the world. He has\r\nbeen obliged to have assistants to prepare pupils for him. Students\r\nhave come to Vienna from all parts of the world. A brilliant pianist,\r\nhe has written piano music and even an opera, but his merit as a\r\nteacher is due to the foundation given him by Czerny, who acquired his\r\ntraditions from Beethoven, to the keenness of his ability to prescribe\r\nfor the individual needs of the pupil and the simplicity and directness\r\nof his “method.” His pupils have met with great success, although he\r\nhas not yet produced a second Paderewski.\r\n\r\n=Ignaz Paderewski=, probably the greatest pianist since Liszt, although\r\nlike him excelled in some respects by others, was born in 1859. A\r\npupil of the Warsaw Conservatory, he also studied at Berlin. He taught\r\npiano at the Warsaw Conservatory from 1878-83, and also at Strassburg.\r\nLater he went to Leschetizky for a thorough course of study. After his\r\ndébut at Vienna, in 1887, he conquered by degrees Paris and London.\r\nHis first visit to America was in 1891, when he carried all before\r\nhim. Since then he has visited the United States three times, he has\r\ntraveled over all Europe, and has visited Australia with overwhelming\r\nsuccess, financial and artistic. His most noticeable qualities are\r\na magnetic personality, a virtuoso technic, the color and piquant\r\nrhythm of his playing, and the poetry and deep human intensity of his\r\ninterpretations. He has written several sets of pieces for the piano,\r\na concerto, and a fantasy with orchestra, and an opera. His generous\r\ngift of the endowment of triennial prizes to American composers is an\r\nadmirable instance of his warm-heartedness.\r\n\r\n=Josef Slavinski=, born 1865, who studied with Stroeble, Anton\r\nRubinstein and finally Leschetizky, is a pianist of great ability who\r\ncame to the United States in 1873, and again in 1901. Other Leschetizky\r\npupils are =Ossip Gabrilowitsch=, born 1878, also a pupil of Anton\r\nRubinstein and the St. Petersburg Conservatory, who came to America in\r\n1900 and 1902; =Mark Hambourg=, born in 1879, who first studied with\r\nhis father, and after a tour of the United States in 1900, has had\r\nbrilliant successes in Europe and England; =Martinus Sieveking=, born\r\n1867, a pupil of Röntgen at Leipzig, who visited America in 1895 and\r\nagain in 1896-97 and afterwards went to Vienna. There are many other\r\nbrilliant pupils of Leschetizky, but the foregoing are some of the best\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nPaderewski has not taught, as a rule, since his great triumphs as a\r\nvirtuoso, but he has made exceptions. =Sigismond Stojowski=, born 1870,\r\nwas a pupil of the Paris Conservatory, where he won first prizes in\r\npiano playing and composition. Later he studied with Paderewski, and\r\nlived as pianist, teacher and composer in Paris. In 1905, he accepted\r\nthe position of head of the piano department at the Institute of\r\nMusical Art, New York City. =Antoinette Szumowska-Adamowska= was born\r\nin 1868. She studied at Warsaw, and later, for several years, with\r\nPaderewski. She has made successful appearances in Europe and America.\r\nLater she accepted a position at the New England Conservatory, in\r\nBoston, U. S. A.\r\n\r\nAnother pianist of great ability who has profited by Paderewski’s\r\nsuggestions is =Harold Bauer=, born in 1873. A student of the violin,\r\nas well as of the piano, he did not consider making a career as a piano\r\nvirtuoso until encouraged by Paderewski. In 1892, he studied with\r\nPaderewski, although he is largely self-taught, for his individuality\r\nand musical style show slight effects of Paderewski’s influence.\r\nBauer’s technic is superb, although he is not a virtuoso pure and\r\nsimple. His interpretations are healthy and vigorous, and especially\r\nfaithful to the composers’ intentions. His repertory is enormous. He\r\nhas made several extremely successful tours to the United States. He\r\nhas traveled also widely in Europe as well as to South America. Bauer\r\nis one of the most eminent of living artists.\r\n\r\nAmong Norwegians, =Edvard Grieg=, born 1843, is a remarkable\r\ninterpreter of his own individual works. =Christian Sinding= and\r\n=Wilhelm Stenhammar= also deserve mention.\r\n\r\nThe Italians have not produced many remarkable pianists, nevertheless,\r\nseveral are well known. Chief among them is =Giovanni Sgambati=, born\r\n1843, a pupil of Liszt. Sgambati has composed charming music for\r\nthe piano, as well as chamber-music, a concerto and symphony. He is\r\ndirector of the Academy of St. Cecilia, at Rome. =Giuseppe Buonamici=,\r\nborn 1846, a pupil of the Munich Conservatory and of von Bülow, has\r\ndone much to promote music in Florence. He has been connected with\r\nseveral musical societies in that city, and has been active as a\r\nteacher. His editions of Beethoven’s sonatas, of Bertini’s etudes, and\r\na treatise on scale playing are of great value to the student. The\r\nmost prominent Italian pianist, who has lived a cosmopolitan life, is\r\n=Feruccio Busoni=, born in 1866. Early in life he became a member, as\r\na pianist, of the Bologna Philharmonic Academy, after a severe test.\r\nIn 1888, he accepted a position at the Helsingfors Conservatory. In\r\n1890, he won the Rubinstein prize as composer and pianist. Subsequently\r\nhe taught the piano in the Moscow Conservatory, and later he was\r\nconnected with the New England Conservatory at Boston. Since then he\r\nhas lived in Europe as a pianist and conductor of ultra-modern music.\r\nBusoni has one of the most formidable technics of any pianist living.\r\nHe has edited Bach’s “Well-Tempered Clavichord,” with many helpful\r\ntechnical suggestions, also the smaller preludes and inventions; he has\r\nmade masterly transcriptions of Bach’s organ works for the piano, of a\r\nfantasy for organ by Liszt, the same composer’s “Mephisto Waltz,” etc.\r\nHe re-visited America in 1904.\r\n\r\n=Stephen Heller=, born 1814, died 1888, was much influenced by Chopin.\r\nHe was a talented pianist, who will be remembered chiefly by his\r\nstudies, and a few other pieces, which have decided educational value.\r\n\r\nAmong other living pianists who escape classification for one reason\r\nor another are =Moritz Moszkowski=, born 1854, a pupil of the Dresden,\r\nKullak and Stern Conservatories; while a successful pianist and\r\nteacher, he is known chiefly for his fluent and graceful piano music,\r\nalthough he has composed works in larger forms. =Franz Rummel=, born\r\n1853, died 1901, a pupil of Brassin and the Brussels Conservatory,\r\ntoured Europe and visited America several times; he taught at the\r\nStern Conservatory in Berlin; =Rafael Joseffy=, born 1853, went to\r\nthe Leipzig Conservatory, he then studied with Carl Tausig and later\r\nwith Liszt; of late years he has taught at the National Conservatory\r\nat New York. His concert appearances have invariably been successful,\r\nalthough he has devoted himself largely to teaching. A pianist of\r\nespecial distinction is =Vladimir de Pachmann=, born in 1848, a\r\npupil of the Vienna Conservatory; in spite of a brilliant début\r\nhe retired for many years’ study; on reappearing he gave concerts\r\nover all Europe, and has made several visits to America; his chief\r\ntriumphs have been as the inimitable interpreter of Chopin; =Leopold\r\nGodowsky=, born 1870, appeared as a prodigy at the age of nine; he\r\nstudied at the _Hochschule_ in Berlin, made European tours, and studied\r\nwith Saint-Saëns from 1887 to 1890; he taught at conservatories in\r\nPhiladelphia and Chicago; in 1902, he returned to Europe, where he has\r\ngiven concerts constantly with phenomenal success. A composer of piano\r\npieces, he has devised many extraordinary versions of Chopin’s studies.\r\n\r\nAmong English pianists, =Frederic Lamond=, a pupil of the Raff\r\nConservatory, of von Bülow and Liszt, and =Leonard Borwick=, a pupil of\r\nMme. Schumann, are the best known, although there are many pianists of\r\nrising reputation.\r\n\r\nTwo young pianists deserving of especial recognition are Ernst von\r\nDohnanyi and Josef Hofmann. =Dohnanyi=, born 1877, is a pupil of\r\nKessler and D’Albert. In 1898, he won a double success as pianist and\r\ncomposer with a piano concerto. In 1900, he made a brilliant tour in\r\nAmerica. Since then he has devoted himself largely to composition.\r\n=Josef Hofmann= was a pupil of his father, and later, of Anton\r\nRubinstein. He played the piano when six years old; in public at the\r\nage of nine. In the following year he gave fifty-two concerts in the\r\nUnited States. After retiring for study under Rubinstein, he reappeared\r\na mature artist. He has since visited America several times. Hofmann\r\nhas an unusual technic; his individuality is not striking, but he is an\r\nartist of conspicuous merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AMERICAN PIANISTS.\r\n\r\nThe rapid progress of music in America renders it impossible to do\r\njustice to piano playing in this country. However, the pioneer work of\r\n=William Mason=, a pupil of Moscheles, Dreyschock and Liszt, active\r\nas pianist and teacher, the author of “Touch and Technic” and other\r\ntechnical treatises; of B. J. Lang, a pupil of his father, F. C. Hill,\r\nSalter and Alfred Jaell, an active pianist, teacher, and conductor,\r\nof W. S. B. Mathews, Otto Dresel, Ernst Perabo, and others, was of\r\ngreat importance. Later =Carl Baermann=, a Liszt pupil, Carl Faelten,\r\n=William Sherwood=, also a Liszt pupil, Carl Stasny, Arthur Whiting,\r\nEdward MacDowell and many others have continued the work so ably begun.\r\n=Edward MacDowell= is easily the most noted American composer-pianist.\r\nHis technical equipment, personality, and interpretative gifts justly\r\nentitle him to this distinction. A pupil of Mme. Carreño, Marmontel\r\nand Carl Heymann, he has had thorough training. His pianistic career\r\nhas been limited by his efforts as a composer, and by his work as\r\nProfessor of Music at Columbia, which position he resigned in 1904, as\r\nwell as his activity as a teacher. His studies, concertos and smaller\r\npieces show great individuality of technical style, besides being\r\namong the most valuable contributions to piano literature since Liszt.\r\nMacDowell has appeared with leading orchestras in this country; he has\r\ngiven many recitals, including a tour of the United States in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WOMEN PIANISTS.\r\n\r\nOf the many distinguished women pianists since Liszt, the most eminent\r\nwas =Mme. Clara Schumann=, a pupil of her father, Friedrich Wieck. She\r\nplayed in public from the age of thirteen, winning instant recognition.\r\nHer marriage to Schumann diminished her public activity, but after\r\nhis death in 1856, she resumed her career. She taught at the Hoch\r\nConservatory at Frankfort, besides playing in public in Europe and\r\nEngland. Among other famous women pianists were Madame Clauss-Szavardy,\r\n=Mme. Arabella Goddard Davidson=, and Mme. Sophie Menter. =Mme.\r\nTeresa Carreño=, a pupil of L. M. Gottschalk and G. Mathias, has had\r\na remarkable career as concert-pianist. =Mme. Essipoff=, a pupil of\r\nWielhorski and Leschetizky, taught for many years at the St. Petersburg\r\nConservatory, after brilliant concert tours. Miss Fanny Davies, a\r\npupil of Reinecke and Mme. Schumann, Mme. Roger-Miclos and Mlle.\r\nClotilde Kleeberg, pupils of the Paris Conservatory, are all pianists\r\nof distinction. In this country Miss Adele aus der Ohe, a pupil of\r\nKullak and Liszt, =Mme. Bloomfield-Zeisler=, a pupil of von Wolfssohn\r\nand Leschetizky, and =Mme. Helen Hopekirk=, a pupil of the Leipzig\r\nConservatory and of Leschetizky, now a teacher at the New England\r\nConservatory, and =Mme. Szumowska-Adamowska=, before mentioned as a\r\npupil of Paderewski, are all pianists of great ability.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that while Liszt’s pupils have done\r\nmuch to carry on the traditions which he originated, much has also been\r\naccomplished for the advancement of pianistic art by Leschetizky and\r\nhis pupils, a remarkable group of teachers at the Paris Conservatory,\r\nand by such independent pianists as de Pachmann, Busoni, Siloti,\r\nGodowsky, Bauer and Hofmann, while many able conservatories and private\r\nteachers in America are enabling the American pianist to compete\r\nfavorably with Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho is the best-known piano teacher of today?\r\n\r\nName some of his famous pupils.

ORATORIO AFTER MENDELSSOHN.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Development of the Art-Song Idea=.—A most significant phase of musical\r\nactivity is that centred around the art-song for solo voice. In the\r\nperiod before the opera, choral singing was the principal medium for\r\nvocal music. With the Opera came a style of composition from which\r\nwas developed the principle of the Aria, the latter dominating both\r\nOpera and Oratorio for many years, as the form for an art-song for a\r\nsolo voice. In this form, as we have seen, the production of vocal\r\neffects, the making of attractive melody, and the opportunity for\r\nvirtuosic display were sought first of all. It was not until the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century, when Schubert’s peculiar genius asserted\r\nitself, that we meet what can be truly called the art-song, a form of\r\ncomposition without the artificiality of the operatic aria and with\r\nhigher musicianly and artistic qualities than those that mark the\r\npeople’s song. Several tendencies contributed to bring this about.\r\nGluck’s theories and practice led both composers and people to pay\r\ncloser attention to the text and to its delivery. The development of\r\ninstrumental music, particularly the principles of thematic treatment,\r\nled composers to the inventing of new melodic and rhythmic figures that\r\nshould serve as the basis of accompaniments of higher artistic quality\r\nthan those founded on some variation of the Alberti bass figure. Piano\r\ntechnic had greatly improved, and so had the instrument. And it may\r\nalso be said that the verse of this period was better suited for a\r\ndramatic musical setting than the formal, often stilted and artificial\r\nlyrics of earlier days, with their shepherds and shepherdesses and\r\nconstant reference to pastoral and classical life.\r\n\r\n=Italian, French and English Forms=.—A study of musical conditions\r\nin Italy, France, Germany and England shows a different style of the\r\nsolo song in each country, each having some distinctive feature that\r\nmaintains today, and one that may be said to characterize the song-idea\r\nof that people. The Italians were so taken with the opera and in the\r\ncourse of its development it so fully embodied the national love for\r\nsweet, graceful melody that a species of art-song apart from the opera\r\nhad little or no chance to shape itself. The French _Chanson_ has never\r\nyielded place to the methods which distinguish the modern art-song.\r\nThe French language has certain qualities which seem to call for a\r\ntreatment that centres the attention in the voice part rather than on\r\nthe song as a whole, according to the German idea. Yet French composers\r\nhave produced and still make most beautiful and charming songs which\r\nunmistakably embody the national characteristics, clearness, polish\r\nand an effective singing melody. The old English Ballads are pieces of\r\nnarrative verse; but the term has been used so freely and for almost\r\nevery kind of verse that it is not possible to give it a precise\r\ndefinition. Thomas Morley, in a work on music, which he published in\r\n1597, mentions “songs which, being sung to a dittie may likewise be\r\ndanced”; in 1636, in a book called “The Principles of Musicke,” the\r\nauthor, Butler, refers to “the infinite multitude of Ballads set to\r\nsundry pleasant and delightful tunes by cunning and witty composers,\r\nwith country dances fitted to them.” The principles of musical\r\nconstruction and the character of the text are such that we do not find\r\nin the English ballad the true germ of the art-song.\r\n\r\n=The German “Lied”=, a poem intended for singing, as it came from the\r\nhands of the great poets, such as Goethe and Heine, seems to have\r\nafforded to composers the inspiration to the making of a style of song\r\nthat should have the value of a musical setting in full consonance\r\nwith the character of the text. As instrumental music developed, the\r\n_Volkslied_, the people’s song, the natural medium for expression,\r\ngradually disappeared. Yet composers made use of it as a medium, such\r\nmasters as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Weber giving attention to it,\r\nalthough the demand for a simple, clear melody, due to the dominance\r\nof the Italian opera, and for an accompaniment that was always much\r\nsubordinated, prevented the art-song (_Kunstlied_) from taking a high\r\nplace. Since then the accompaniment has been given more and more\r\nprominence, less attention being paid to pure melody and more to the\r\nvalue of harmony and rhythm as the means for characteristic color and\r\nexpression. Melody, which is made up of a succession of phrases, cannot\r\nfurnish a sequence of sharp effects so readily as can well contrasted\r\nchords; hence the old idea of tune changed as harmony became better\r\nunderstood. The methods of song composers vary, and a classification\r\nis made by German writers: A song that has simple form and tune akin\r\nto that of the Folk-song is called “_Volksthümlich_”; one that has the\r\nsame tune to the different stanzas is called strophic; one that is\r\ncarefully worked out, the music illustrating every shade of meaning\r\nand emotion is called “_Durchcomponirt_”; a narrative song is called\r\na “Ballad” or “Ballade.” The great masters in song composition are\r\nSchubert, Schumann, Franz and Brahms.\r\n\r\n=Schubert as a Song Writer=.—A consideration of Schubert’s education\r\nand his general make-up shows clearly why he should seek outlet for\r\nself-expression in song rather than in the large instrumental forms. We\r\nfind that he was not systematically educated in musical science, like\r\nMozart, Beethoven or Weber, and that he was by nature very spontaneous\r\nand amenable to external influences. Such a composer is particularly\r\nopen to the effect of a poem and will turn to the small song form\r\nrather than to the elaborate instrumental forms. Many of Schubert’s\r\nsongs were written on the spur of the moment in response to an impulse\r\nfrom reading a chance bit of verse. The first reading of the poem\r\nusually gave the complete idea, both tune and accompaniment; whether it\r\nshould have the simple folk-song character, a more declamatory style,\r\nstrophic or the more elaborate form, depended upon the character of\r\nthe text. It is fortunate for music that he was brought into contact\r\nwith some of the finest lyrics in the field of poetry, such as called\r\nforth his highest powers in melody, harmony, rhythm, modulation,\r\ndeclamation and recitative, for he aimed to the very fullest extent\r\npossible to heighten the thought of the text by the emotional power of\r\nmusic. It is a phase of Schubert’s genius that some of his finest songs\r\nwere written before he had reached his majority.\r\n\r\n=Schumann and His Songs=.—Schumann brought to song writing a different\r\ntype of mind from that of Schubert, more poetic, more gloomy, more\r\nemotional, a fine literary training, a faculty for expression in word\r\nas well as in tone, a fund of new forms of expression in instrumental\r\nmusic, particularly the piano, so that we find in his songs certain\r\nelements that indicate development toward a more highly organized\r\nstructure. Schumann was highly intellectual, hence we find in his\r\nsongs a close union of voice and instrumental parts in working out the\r\nfundamental conception of the poet’s meaning; and so deeply does he\r\ncarry out this plan that the accompanist must enter most thoroughly\r\ninto the singer’s part, and _vice versa_, that the full effect be\r\nbrought out; as compared with the songs of Schubert and Mendelssohn we\r\ncan say that the latter are the “verses set to tunes, while Schumann’s\r\nsongs are poems in music.” The piano part of a Schumann song contains\r\nthe atmosphere of the poem, is an attempt to heighten the meaning by\r\nsuggesting thoughts and feelings which the words, spoken or sung,\r\ncannot express; sometimes it is an entirely independent composition,\r\nand carries out to a final close the thought left unfinished by the\r\nvoice, thus avoiding the conventional ending, by the singer, on the\r\ntonic chord. Schumann’s effort was to express his own reading of the\r\npoet’s lines by the musical means that seemed to him best suited to\r\nthe purpose. To this end he refused to allow himself to be bound by\r\nconventional treatment, either of voice or instrument.\r\n\r\n=Robert Franz= (1815-1892) combined in his songs the romanticism and\r\ngeneral methods of Schumann, with a polyphonic treatment inspired by\r\nhis deep study of Bach. He wrote to various styles of verse, hymns,\r\nlove-songs, lyrics of the field, the forest, the hunter, the soldier,\r\nand though his songs lack the tender, passionate, melodious quality\r\nof Schubert’s and the deep poetic feeling of Schumann’s, they are\r\nnevertheless models of perfect, even elaborate workmanship in which\r\nthe composer follows with great faithfulness the mood of the poet;\r\nSchumann, on the contrary, seems to project his own interpretation of\r\nthe poem into his music, while Schubert seems to grasp the emotion at\r\nits highest moment and the song pours out as the spontaneous expression\r\nof the singer.\r\n\r\n=Three Modern Writers=.—Of modern writers, those who contributed most\r\nto the development of the art-song are Wagner, Brahms and Richard\r\nStrauss, the first-named by his style and treatment of the voice and\r\nthe instrumental part rather than by his songs, which are few in\r\nnumber. =Brahms= wrote nearly two hundred songs, varying in character\r\nand quality, and using a highly-developed accompaniment, often\r\nintricate in its construction, complicated in rhythm and restless in\r\nharmonic support, employing all the resources which his mastery of\r\nchromatic harmony placed at his disposal. He frequently wrote in the\r\nstyle of the Folk-song, making use of its simple melodic quality,\r\nenriching it, however, by his great skill in elaboration in the\r\naccompaniment. Brahms’ songs are great favorites on concert programs.\r\n=Richard Strauss= (b. 1864) is the leading composer of today, and has\r\nused in his songs the principles that distinguish his large works.\r\nThese songs are very difficult, both for voice and accompaniment, and\r\nare full of tonal coloring, for Strauss has adapted to the miniature\r\nform of the song the means of harmonic and rhythmic effects which he\r\nuses so powerfully in his orchestral scores. When well sung and well\r\nplayed, the hearer cannot but be absorbed by the wealth of musical\r\neffects of the highest emotional and picturesque quality displayed in\r\nRichard Strauss’ songs. In a full study of songs and song writers, many\r\nmore names would be mentioned; those selected for consideration in this\r\nlesson represent those who have contributed most significantly to the\r\ndevelopment of the modern art-song.\r\n\r\n=Oratorio Composers after Mendelssohn=.—The later history of the\r\nOratorio requires some consideration at this point. After Mendelssohn,\r\nmany of the leading composers of Europe turned their attention to\r\nthis form of composition, influenced, in many instances, by the\r\nsplendid opportunities for production offered by the strong choral\r\norganizations and festival associations of Germany and England, as\r\nwell as by the great advances made in orchestral playing, which gave\r\nto composers resources far beyond those at the hand of Mendelssohn\r\nand his predecessors. We may mention, among the Germans, =Schumann=,\r\nwhose “Paradise and the Peri” was produced in 1843; =Liszt=, who was\r\nmuch attracted to sacred subjects, wrote two oratorios, “The Legend of\r\nSt. Elizabeth” and “Christus”; =Rubinstein=, who used his great skill\r\nin tone painting with orchestral masses in “Paradise Lost” and in his\r\nsacred opera “The Tower of Babel”; =Brahms=, whose “German Requiem” is\r\na standard work to be done well only by thoroughly disciplined vocal\r\nand instrumental forces; and =Dvořák=, who has shown great power in\r\nhis “Stabat Mater.” Among the French writers most prominent in this\r\nform of composition are =Berlioz=, whose “Requiem” is a colossal work\r\nin which he drew upon all the resources of the orchestra to heighten\r\nthe powerful, dramatic character of the text; =Gounod=, who wrote his\r\nremarkable works, “The Redemption” and “Mors et Vita” for English\r\nproduction; =Saint-Saëns=, whose “Noël,” a Christmas work, is oratorio\r\nin style and construction, although small in dimensions; and =César\r\nFranck=, the most modern of all, whose “Beatitudes” has been made the\r\nsubject of much discussion. English composers, following the lead\r\nof Handel and Mendelssohn, have given great attention to this form.\r\n=Bennett=, the friend of Mendelssohn, produced a beautiful work, “The\r\nWoman of Samaria”; =Costa=, an Italian by birth, spent a great part\r\nof his professional life in England; hence his oratorio, “Eli,” may\r\nbe classed with English works; =Sullivan= wrote two oratorios, “The\r\nProdigal Son” and “The Light of the World”; =Macfarren’s= “St. John\r\nthe Baptist” and =Mackenzie’s= “Rose of Sharon” can be classed among\r\noratorios. The most eminent in this form at the present day is =Elgar=,\r\n“The Dream of Gerontius” and “The Apostles.” Young Italy has lately\r\nshown interest in this form, the most noteworthy being the =Abbé\r\nPerosi=, who is under the patronage of the Pope. In the United States\r\nthe leading representatives are =J. K. Paine=, of Harvard University,\r\nwith the oratorio “St. Peter,” =Dudley Buck=, “Golden Legend,” and =H.\r\nW. Parker=, “Hora Novissima.”\r\n\r\n=The Cantata=.—More popular even than the Oratorio with choral\r\nsocieties is the Cantata, both sacred and secular, and the great\r\nincrease in strong choral organizations, particularly in England,\r\nGermany, France and the United States, has resulted in the production\r\nof a number of splendid works which show dramatic power and the\r\nhighest skill in handling voices and instruments. These works contain\r\nopportunities for the use of the finest quality of melody, variety of\r\nrhythm, solid harmonic or the more fluent polyphonic style, richness\r\nof harmonic coloring and every accessory in the way of tone painting\r\nby the orchestra, which such masters as Berlioz and Wagner pointed\r\nout. The important works are too many to be mentioned here; only the\r\ncomposers’ names can be given. In Germany, Brahms, Bruch, Dvořák, Gade,\r\nGoetz, Hiller, Hofmann, Rheinberger; in France, Berlioz and Massenet;\r\nin England, Bennett, Corder, Cowen, Macfarren, Mackenzie, Smart,\r\nSullivan, Coleridge-Taylor among the younger men; in the United States,\r\nBuck, Foote, Chadwick, Gilchrist, Paine, H. W. Parker, and Carl Busch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nFinck.—Songs and Song Writers.\r\n\r\nGrove’s and Riemann’s Dictionaries.—Articles on composers mentioned, on\r\nSong, Lied, Volkslied, Chanson, Oratorio and Cantata.\r\n\r\nParry.—Evolution of the Art of Music, Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\nUpton.—Standard Oratorios.

GUSTAV MAHLER.\r\n\r\nRICHARD STRAUSS. SIEGMUND HAUSEGGER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON L.\r\n\r\n                     THE SYMPHONIC POEM IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wagner’s Influence=.—The genius of Wagner produced and applied to\r\nOpera a far richer and more complicated orchestration than had existed\r\nbefore his day. Since then, in many periods and in many countries,\r\ncomposers have tried to adopt his style, and apply it to the symphonic\r\nas well as to the operatic stage. In the field of purely orchestral\r\nmusic, Liszt and Berlioz had already formulated a free style, and their\r\nsymphonic poems, departing from the set form of the symphony, have also\r\nserved as models for later composers. Almost the only recent exponent\r\nof the strict form was Johannes Brahms, for Anton Bruckner, working on\r\nsimilar lines, did not achieve great success with the public.\r\n\r\n=Richard Strauss=.—For many years it was thought that Wagner’s\r\norchestration would remain unrivalled in the field of music. But\r\nRichard Strauss (born at Munich, Germany, 1864) has made a further\r\nadvance in this respect, and handles the full modern orchestra with\r\nthe utmost skill. Son of a court horn-player, his musical genius\r\nshowed itself in his earliest years, and his studies with the court\r\ncapellmeister, F. W. Meyer, resulted in the publication of several\r\nworks. At first he followed Brahms and the stricter school, and his\r\nF-minor symphony is a worthy production in that form. A meeting with\r\nvon Bülow led to his appointment as assistant-conductor at Meiningen.\r\nTo show his ability, Strauss had to conduct, without rehearsal, his\r\nSerenade, Op. 7, for thirteen wind instruments; and the excellence of\r\nthis work brought him the desired position. It was at this time that\r\nhe met Alexander Ritter, a man of broad intellect and radical ideas.\r\nUnder the new influence, Strauss renounced his classical style, and\r\nbegan to compose the tone-pictures and symphonic poems that have made\r\nhis name so important. As he is the chief modern representative of the\r\nnew school, his works merit detailed examination.\r\n\r\n=His Early Symphonic Poems=.—After an Italian trip in 1886, Strauss\r\ngave his impressions of that country in the form of the symphonic\r\nfantasie “Aus Italien,” his first work in the free style of\r\nsubjective emotion-painting. It is in four movements, each a complete\r\ntone-picture. The first, “On the Campagna,” gives a vivid impression\r\nof spacious solitude, with a hint of the pageants and battles once\r\nwitnessed by this great Roman field. The second movement, “Amid Rome’s\r\nRuins,” aims also to give “fantastic pictures of vanished splendor,\r\nfeelings of sadness in the midst of the sunlit present.” The third\r\nmovement, “On the Shores of Sorrento,” resembles the symphonic scherzo,\r\nwhile the finale gives an animated picture of “Neapolitan Folk-Life,”\r\nintroducing the air of “Funiculi” and other popular Italian tunes.\r\n\r\nAfter four years of conducting at the Munich court theatre, Strauss\r\nsettled in Weimar, where he produced three more important works. The\r\nfirst of these, “Macbeth,” showed that he had abandoned the old form in\r\nfavor of the symphonic poem, in which the different movements are fused\r\ninto one large whole, free in form. The picture of Macbeth, ambitious\r\nand cruel in spite of his timidity, is ably developed, but the\r\nportrayal of Lady Macbeth brings a still stronger climax of magnificent\r\norchestral power.\r\n\r\n“Don Juan,” the second of the three, is founded on Lenau’s poem. The\r\nhero is not a ruffian adventurer, as in Da Ponte’s libretto, but is\r\ndepicted as an arch pessimist, hunting through the world for perfection\r\nin pleasure, but never finding it. There are restless and uncertain\r\nmelodies at the opening, to illustrate the hero’s unsatisfied longing.\r\nA knightly theme follows, typical of Don Juan himself. Then come\r\nvarious episodes, full of attractive enthusiasm, but always ending with\r\nthe same vague unrest. A wild carnival, followed by sudden silence and\r\nthe cutting theme of a trumpet, announce the hero’s end.\r\n\r\n“Tod und Verklärung” (Death and Transfiguration) is a work of great\r\npower and beauty. It depicts an exhausted sufferer, asleep in the quiet\r\nsick-room, dreaming of the beauty of his lost youth. Then follows a\r\nmore discordant episode, which may well picture a fierce contest with\r\nthe powers of disease, ending in defeated exhaustion. A third portion\r\nbrings renewed memories of the morning of life; passages of joyous\r\nenthusiasm and noble aspiration suggest the high hope of youth and the\r\nglorious achievement of manhood; but again comes the struggle with\r\nthe powers of Fate, ending in despair and death. The fourth part is\r\nan apotheosis, representing the triumph of man’s upward striving over\r\ndeath. This section contains some of the most impressive orchestral\r\nbeauties in the range of Strauss’ works.\r\n\r\n=Program Music=.—In the older symphonic form, it was not necessary\r\nfor the composer to suggest a title for his work. Many have done\r\nso—Beethoven in his “Pastoral Symphony,” Mendelssohn in the “Scotch,”\r\nfor example; but the exquisite beauty of Schubert, or the romantic\r\ncharm of Schumann will impress the hearer without the use of extraneous\r\nsuggestions. In the modern school of program music, founded by Liszt,\r\nthe composer gives the audience a more or less detailed account of the\r\nsubject that inspired him, and tries to paint in tones the events or\r\nmoods suggested by the title. Much, therefore, depends on the choice\r\nof the subject. If it is well-known, and gives definite suggestions of\r\ncertain moods which can find expression in the orchestra, then it may\r\nreceive legitimate treatment by being set to music. But if the subject\r\nis not one that lends itself to broad emotional treatment, or if the\r\ncomposer aims to picture definite events or objects, he is departing\r\nfrom the true function of his art. Music deals with expression of\r\nemotion, and should not attempt something that belongs rather to other\r\narts, such as Literature or Painting. Many persons think that Strauss\r\nhas gone too far in this direction, especially in his later works.\r\n\r\n=His Later Symphonic Poems=.—In “Till Eulenspiegel,” the hero is a\r\nmediæval rogue, whose adventures are found in an old German tale. He\r\nis a wandering mechanic, who does anything but tend to business. He is\r\nalways indulging in madcap pranks, in which he manages to escape from\r\nhis well-merited punishment. In the composition, Strauss has given\r\nfree rein to his fancy, and portrayed, with rare orchestral skill,\r\nthe fantastic jokes, the sly humor, and the rollicking disposition of\r\nthe graceless rogue. The work is in rondo form, with definite themes\r\nto typify the hero. These themes form the basis of the music, and are\r\nvaried and developed with infinite skill and remarkable orchestral\r\nirony.\r\n\r\n“Also Sprach Zarathustra” (Thus Spake Zarathustra) is based on\r\nNietzsche’s mystic philosophy. Zarathustra, or Zoroaster, alms to teach\r\nthe doctrine of the “Over-Man,” by which man is to become a sort of\r\ndemigod who rises above good and evil into realms of joy. A picture\r\nof the “Hinterweltlern,” or dwellers in the Rear-World of common\r\nhumanity, portrays their yearnings, their joys, and passions, while\r\ntheir sorrows find voice in a tender “Grave-Song.” Science and its\r\nfutility are represented by a fugue replete with chromatics. A passage\r\nentitled, “The Convalescent,” shows the defeat of the spirit of sorrow\r\nand evil, and the triumph of joy. Then follows the wild, chaotic, but\r\nstrangely-effective “Dance-Song,” the exultation of the “Over-Man.”\r\nYet his triumph is not lasting, for at the close, after a sudden\r\nstroke of the bell, comes the weird “Song of the Night-Wanderer,” and\r\nthe piece ends mystically in two different keys, as if representing\r\neternal doubt. Strange as this work may seem, its effect is one of\r\nvast sublimity, and Nietzsche’s wild philosophy is translated into\r\norchestral effects of remarkable grandeur.\r\n\r\nWith “Don Quixote” Strauss enters the more definite field of program\r\nmusic, and aims to picture events. It is cast in the variation form,\r\nbut is much more free in style than that title would imply. There is a\r\ntheme for the Don, clear at first, but becoming obscure and illogical,\r\nto show that he loses his sanity. He is represented by a solo ’cello,\r\nwhile his faithful squire Sancho, strange to say, appears mostly in\r\nviola passages. Each variation treats of one adventure. The windmills\r\nare attacked, with disastrous results. The flock of sheep are heard,\r\nbleating in full chorus until put to flight. The bands of pilgrims are\r\ndispersed as robbers. The blindfold ride through the air on the wooden\r\nhorse is made realistic by the use of the theatrical wind-machine.\r\nOther adventures follow, and at the end the knightly theme recurs in\r\na clarified form, to show Don Quixote’s return to reason and death.\r\nIt will readily be seen that this work is more experimental than the\r\nearlier ones.\r\n\r\n“Ein Heldenleben” represents the fight of Strauss with his adverse\r\ncritics. There are six well-marked sections. First comes the hero\r\nhimself, portrayed by definite themes that are woven into a strong\r\nclimax. Then his enemies are depicted, with remarkable irony, by a\r\nmedley of crackling, snarling figures for woodwind. The hero’s helpmate\r\nis represented by a solo violin, and in this section an instrumental\r\nlove-duet is introduced. Then follows a picture of the hero’s\r\nbattlefield, ending in a song of victory. The hero’s works of peace are\r\nthen described, and the meaning of the composition is made clear by the\r\nintroduction of themes from the earlier works of Strauss. The final\r\nsection shows the hero’s departure from an ungrateful world. This piece\r\nis grandly planned, but like other orchestral works of Strauss, its\r\nthemes are not melodic and lack musical charm.\r\n\r\nThe “Sinfonia Domestica” pictures a day in the composer’s family life.\r\nHere, again, the subject is one that the hearer cannot understand\r\nwithout an arbitrary explanation. Strauss has given no complete\r\nanalysis, but has deigned to explain that the three themes in the early\r\npart represent father, mother and child, that the picture begins in the\r\nafternoon and lasts until the next morning, and that the final fugue\r\nrepresents the education of the child. The unmelodic style of Strauss\r\nis little suited to such a subject, and the effect is such as to make\r\nthe work seem puzzling, at first, if not actually ridiculous.\r\n\r\n=His Other Works=.—Of the two early operas by Strauss, “Guntram”\r\nand “Feuersnoth,” neither has had real success; nor does his third\r\nproduction, “Salome,” seem important. Guntram is a fighter for love,\r\na member of a mystic fraternity. He rescues Freihild from the tyranny\r\nof Duke Robert, who loves her, and in the struggle he kills Robert.\r\nFreihild falls in love with him, but he must renounce her, as he knows\r\nthat he killed Robert out of rivalry in love, an unworthy motive.\r\n“Feuersnoth,” lighter in style, is based on the old legend of a\r\nscornful maiden, whose pride meets punishment. All fire in the town\r\ngoes out, and no light can be rekindled, save by a touch of her body;\r\nso that she finds herself exposed to the multitude. In this work, as in\r\n“Heldenleben,” Strauss has introduced veiled attacks on his critics.\r\nThe music to both operas shows the usual richness of coloring and\r\norchestral intricacy, but their themes lack the direct power of the\r\nguiding motives in Wagner’s works.\r\n\r\n=The Songs of Strauss= are many in number, and include some with\r\norchestral accompaniment. They show a modulatory style, combined with\r\na rare melodic beauty that seems strange in a composer who indulges in\r\nso much orchestral ugliness. Some of these songs, such as “Traum durch\r\ndie Dämmerung” or “Allerseelen,” are gems of purest water. The songs\r\nare often involved in style, but always possess unity and directness\r\nof effect. Their beauty shows that the discords in the composer’s\r\norchestral works are intentional, and not due to lack of melodic\r\ninvention. Yet it would seem as if his great mastery of instrumental\r\ncoloring could have been employed as effectively in scoring beautiful\r\nthemes, instead of the commonplace passages so often found in his\r\nlarger works.\r\n\r\n=Hausegger=.—Siegmund von Hausegger (Graz, Austria, 1872) is another\r\nmaster of the modern orchestra. His father was a musician of broad\r\nexperience and sound learning, so that it is not strange that his\r\nson’s gifts developed quickly. After his regular studies at the\r\ngymnasium and the university, Siegmund took up music in earnest, under\r\nhis father and Degener. His youthful works were now augmented by a\r\npiano quartet, a fantasia, the orchestral ballad “Odinsmeeresritt,”\r\nthe one-act drama “Helfried,” and the opera “Zinnober,” based on\r\na tale of Hofmann. These were followed by a number of songs and\r\nchoruses, but Hausegger’s real greatness was first revealed by the\r\n“Dyonisiac Fantasie,” a symphonic poem for full orchestra. This was\r\nfollowed by a still greater work, “Barbarossa,” while in 1904, at the\r\nFrankfort festival, came “Wieland der Schmied.” “Barbarossa” is in\r\nthree movements. The first shows the happiness of the people gradually\r\nfading into sorrow and pain, until the Barbarossa theme at last is\r\nheard; for tradition says that the great emperor is not dead, but\r\nsleeps in the mountain Kyffhäuser, waiting to arise when the need of\r\nhis people is too great to be borne. The second movement is a weird,\r\nghostly picture of the enchanted mountain and the sleeping emperor;\r\nwhile the last depicts his awakening, his coming forth at the head of\r\nhis knights, their victory, and the rejoicing of the people. Wieland\r\nis the wonderful smith whose swords cut off a head so cleanly that it\r\nremains in place. The first movement shows his vision of the beautiful\r\nmaid Schwanhilde, appearing from celestial regions; but when he would\r\nclaim her, she retreats, terrified. A second part shows his sorrow and\r\ndespair. In the third movement hope again triumphs, and he forges for\r\nhimself a pair of wings. In the last movement the united lovers leave\r\nthe dull world behind, and take their flight to regions of eternal\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n=Other Orchestral Composers=.—=Gustav Mahler= (Kalisht, Bohemia, 1860)\r\ngained his musical experience as a director in some of the lesser\r\ntheatres, and is largely self-taught. Besides two operas and a number\r\nof beautiful songs, he has composed five symphonies. He has tried to\r\nenlarge the symphonic form without departing from it. His symphonies\r\nall aim to express some definite thought, such as pessimism finding\r\nits cure in simple faith, love of nature leading to a high idea of\r\nPantheism, or doubt clearing in the joys of immortality. The movements\r\nare arranged in contrasting groups, and voices are introduced, at first\r\nsolo, and then often in a final chorus of triumph. Mahler’s works are\r\nplanned on a grand scale, but his music is often unclear and restless\r\nin effect. =Paul Felix Weingartner= (Zara, Dalmatia, 1863) is another\r\nmusician who served his apprenticeship in the smaller theatres, and\r\nbecame one of the world’s great conductors. He is known by his two\r\nsymphonic poems, “King Lear” and “The Elysian Fields,” as well as by\r\ntwo symphonies in strict form, and by several chamber works. His opera\r\n“Genesius” and his classical trilogy “Orestes” are other successful\r\nworks. =Jean Louis Nicodé= (Jerczik, Posen, 1853) is somewhat older\r\nthan the modern tone-poets, and if less important is still noteworthy\r\nas an exponent of the program tendency. His two greatest works are\r\nthe “Symphonic Variations,” Op. 27, and “Das Meer,” for male chorus,\r\nsoloists, orchestra, and organ. The latter is not a cantata, but rather\r\na great suite, in which vocal movements are balanced against orchestral\r\nnumbers. Among younger men, =Hugo Kaun= is familiar to Americans\r\nbecause of his long sojourn in Milwaukee. His symphonic poems based on\r\nLongfellow’s “Hiawatha” show much fluency and taste. Switzerland now\r\nhas its set of young composers, with =Hans Huber= as their leader in\r\nthe orchestral field.\r\n\r\n=The Present Situation=.—The rich harmonies and free modulations of\r\nWagner, combined with the setting aside of symphonic form by Liszt,\r\nhave caused the more recent composers of Germany to give up almost\r\nwholly the writing of symphonies. The free style of tone-picturing has\r\nbeen widely adopted, in consequence of the example of Strauss. He has\r\ngone so far that some of his works seem merely colossal experiments in\r\nthis direction, and it is not improbable that a revulsion from such\r\nextreme musical impressionism will take place some time in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    REFERENCES FOR LESSONS L TO LVI.\r\n\r\nBaker.—Biographical Dictionary of Musicians.\r\n\r\nElson.—Modern Composers of Europe.\r\n\r\nHale, Philip, Editor.—Famous Composers and Their Works, new series.\r\n\r\nHuneker, James.—Mezzotints in Modern Music.\r\n\r\nWeingartner, Paul Felix.—The Symphony Since Beethoven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat was the influence of Wagner’s style on symphonic music?\r\n\r\nWhat was the nature of Richard Strauss’ training and the direction of\r\nhis early compositions?\r\n\r\nDescribe his early symphonic poems.\r\n\r\nWhat is program music?\r\n\r\nDescribe Richard Strauss’ later symphonic poems.\r\n\r\nIn what other styles of composition has he written?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of Hausegger.\r\n\r\nGive an account of the work of Gustav Mahler.\r\n\r\nGive an account of the work of Felix Weingartner.\r\n\r\nGive an account of the work of other German writers of symphonic poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON LI.\r\n\r\n                       GERMAN OPERA SINCE WAGNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Goldmark=.—Among those opera composers who are not direct imitators\r\nof Wagner, Carl Goldmark (Keszthely, Hungary, 1830) is the most noted.\r\nSon of a cantor in a synagogue, he showed decided musical taste while\r\nstill a child, and at twelve played the violin in public. After a few\r\nconservatory lessons at Vienna, he was forced to make his own way, and\r\nlive on the small salary obtained in theatre orchestras. He taught\r\nhimself piano and singing, and was soon able to teach others also.\r\nHe trained himself by reading the scores of the great master-works.\r\nIn purely orchestral composition, his first success came with the\r\n“Sakuntala” overture, inspired by the story of the Oriental nymph of\r\nthat name, who is wooed, forgotten, and found again by the Indian king,\r\nDushianta. Later overtures are “Penthesilea,” “Spring,” “Prometheus\r\nBound,” and “Italy.” Goldmark wrote two symphonies, the first (“Rustic\r\nWedding”) resembling a suite of tone-pictures, while the second is in\r\nstricter form. He has also published a violin concerto, some chamber\r\nworks, and vocal pieces. His music is marked by richness of harmony and\r\nwarmth of instrumental coloring.\r\n\r\n=Goldmark’s Operas=.—His first opera was the “Queen of Sheba,” dealing\r\nwith the infatuation of Assad for that queen, at the court of King\r\nSolomon. Its scenes of splendid festivity and dramatic power, and\r\nits delightful music, won it an immense success, and Goldmark was\r\nnicknamed “Court Composer to the Queen of Sheba.” “Merlin,” his next\r\nwork, is based on that wizard’s love for Viviane, in the days of King\r\nArthur. It contains much noble music, but the libretto is weak and\r\nconfused. “Heimchen am Herd” is an example of the style of Folk-opera\r\nintroduced by Humperdinck. It is a setting of Dickens’ “Cricket on the\r\nHearth,” and its music shows a most delightful freshness and charm.\r\n“Die Kriegsgefangene” treats the story of Achilles and Briseis with\r\nmuch expressive power, while “Götz von Berlichingen” is a setting of\r\nGoethe’s novel of that title. “Der Fremdling” (The Stranger) is a\r\nmanuscript work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK.]\r\n\r\n=Humperdinck=.—Engelbert Humperdinck (Bonn, Germany, 1854) won a\r\nremarkable success with his Folk-opera “Hänsel and Gretel,” a work\r\nwhich has almost founded a new school in Germany. Humperdinck studied\r\narchitecture at first, but at Hiller’s advice took up music. “Hänsel\r\nand Gretel” is the story of two poor children who are left in the\r\nwoods by their stepmother. They find a gingerbread house, inhabited\r\nby a witch who wishes to eat them; but Gretel pushes her into her own\r\noven, and frees all the children previously under her spells. The\r\ngreatness of this work, like that of Weber’s operas, in their day,\r\nlies in its union of the popular Folk-song style with the richness of\r\nmodern orchestration. The music is fresh and tuneful, with an appealing\r\nsincerity that carries it directly to the heart. At a period when\r\nother composers seemed able to produce nothing but weak imitations\r\nof Wagner’s operas, this work won universal recognition. Humperdinck\r\nhas produced several other fairy operas, such as “Dornröschen,” “Die\r\nKönigskinder,” “Saint-Cyr,” and “Die Sieben Geislein,” but none of them\r\nhas gained any lasting success.\r\n\r\n=Kienzl=.—Another composer of originality is =Wilhelm Kienzl=\r\n(Waizen-Kirchen, Austria, 1857). He studied at Graz, Prague, Leipzig,\r\nand, finally, with Liszt, at Weimar. He, too, served as conductor in\r\nsmall theatres. His first opera, “Urvasi,” is based on an East Indian\r\nsubject. Its music is brilliant, but lacking in dramatic effect.\r\n“Heilmar der Narr” deals with the magic healing qualities of a seventh\r\nson, who forfeits his power if rewarded; he cures his sweetheart, but\r\nloses his gift because he wins her, whereupon she sacrifices herself\r\nto bring back his skill. Kienzl’s greatest work is “Der Evangelimann,”\r\ntreating of a true story of two brothers in a small Austrian hamlet.\r\nBoth love the same girl, Martha, but she prefers Mathias. Johannes,\r\nout of jealousy, sets fire to a house where the lovers are meeting,\r\nand denounces Mathias as the incendiary. Martha tries in vain to save\r\nhim, and he is imprisoned for twenty years. At the end of this term,\r\nJohannes, who has been prosperous and respected, is confronted on his\r\ndeath-bed by Mathias, who forgives him. This opera has been given\r\nin many countries, and translated into several languages. Its music\r\nshows much dramatic force, and goes far to redeem those scenes in the\r\nlibretto that are lacking in action. A fourth opera by Kienzl is the\r\ntragi-comedy “Don Quixote.”\r\n\r\n=Schillings=.—Among the composers who have modelled their works on\r\nthose of Wagner is Max Schillings (Düren, Germany, 1868). He studied\r\nlaw at first, like Schumann, but soon turned to music, and became one\r\nof Wagner’s active assistants at Bayreuth. His “Ingwelde” is one of\r\nthe many Viking operas that have followed in the lead of “Tristan and\r\nIsolde,” and aimed at effects of dramatic power. Ingwelde is forced by\r\na careless oath to follow Klause, enemy of her husband, Gest. Bran,\r\nKlause’s brother, loves her also, and kills Klause. She returns to\r\nGest, but Bran follows and kills him too, after which the pair die\r\ntogether. “Der Pfeifertag,” a later work, is evidently inspired by\r\n“Die Meistersinger.” It is a confused account of various adventures\r\non “Pipers’ Day,” a mediæval festival. The chief episodes are the\r\nreduction of an excessive toll paid by the pipers, the pretended death\r\nof one of that Guild, who thus obtains a eulogy from a rival, and the\r\nunion of two pairs of lovers. The music, though worthy, can hardly\r\nstand comparison with that of the great work upon which the opera was\r\nmodelled.\r\n\r\n=Cyrill Kistler= (Augsburg, Germany, 1848) was at one time thought\r\nto be Wagner’s real successor, but nearly all his works are now laid\r\naside. They show an evident striving after musical grandeur, but are\r\nnot wholly successful in attaining that effect. Kistler studied with\r\nLachner and others at Munich, but became a Wagner enthusiast in spite\r\nof their formal training. In his first opera, “Kunihild,” the heroine\r\nis wooed by one of three brothers, who is successful in the magic ride\r\nnecessary to win her. But there has been a feud between the houses,\r\nand another brother, to prevent the marriage, kills the bridegroom. A\r\ncomic opera, “Eulenspiegel,” preceded by ten years the symphonic poem\r\nof Strauss. “Baldurs Tod” is based on the beautiful Norse Saga of the\r\nSun-God. “Im Honigmond” is a smaller work, in romantic style. A more\r\nimportant production in the same vein is “Röslein im Hag,” which bids\r\nfair to be successful. “Der Vogt von Mühlstein” is a work of still more\r\nrecent date.\r\n\r\n=August Bungert= (Mühlheim, Germany, 1846) studied at Cologne and\r\nParis, taking up composition at Berlin under the renowned Fr. Kiel. He\r\nhas produced a light opera, “Die Studenten von Salamanca,” a “Tasso”\r\noverture, and the symphonic poem “Auf der Wartburg.” But his life-work\r\nhas been the composition of a Hexalogy, or set of six operas, on\r\nHomeric subjects. The first two, “Achilles” and “Klytemnestra,” are\r\nfrom the Iliad, while the Odyssey furnishes the material for “Kirke,”\r\n“Nausikaa,” “Odysseus Heimkehr,” and “Odysseus Tod.” The abiding beauty\r\nof the old Greek poems has been faithfully preserved in the librettos,\r\nand the music has reflected, to some degree, the noble dignity of these\r\nepics. The first three works of the Odyssey cycle have been given, and\r\nhave produced an excellent impression on the critics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIEGFRIED WAGNER.]\r\n\r\n=Siegfried Wagner= (Triebschen, Switzerland, 1869), son of the immortal\r\nRichard, has an undoubted right to carry on the family traditions.\r\nHe studied with Kniese and Humperdinck, and became a very energetic\r\nconductor. His first opera, “Der Bärenhäuter,” is the story of a\r\nmediæval soldier who sells himself to the devil, but is redeemed\r\nby finding a sweetheart who will remain true during three years of\r\nabsence. “Herzog Wildfang,” the next work, treats of a fiery duke who\r\nis made unpopular and supplanted by his crafty adviser, Mathias Blank.\r\nMathias is afterward caught in trying to win the beautiful Osterlind by\r\ntrickery, and his dishonesty in office is also exposed; whereupon the\r\nrightful duke comes to his own again, and Osterlind marries her real\r\nlover. “Der Kobold,” a third work, treats of the legend that the souls\r\nof murdered children wander about as kobolds until released by the\r\nsacrifice of the last of their race. “Bruder Lustig,” the fourth opera,\r\nis based on an Austrian subject.\r\n\r\n=D’Albert=.—In Eugen d’Albert (Glasgow, Scotland, 1864), we find a man\r\nof real musical gifts. He studied under such men as Stainer and Prout\r\nin England, but he claims that his true musical education began only\r\nin later days, under Richter and Liszt. He has won international fame\r\nas a pianist, and has shown real musicianship in his purely orchestral\r\nworks. These include two concertos for piano, one for violoncello,\r\nthe “Esther” and “Hyperion” overtures, and a worthy symphony; all\r\nshowing harmonic beauty and richness of color, without any inflation or\r\nexaggerated effects. His first opera, “The Ruby,” tells of a princess\r\nimprisoned in the form of that magic gem, but released by a poor young\r\nman who wins her. “Ghismonda” deals with the love of a princess for\r\na young man of low degree, but noble character. On being surprised\r\nwith the princess, he dies rather than reveal her love for him, but\r\nshe proclaims his chivalry to the world. “Gernot” is an elfin opera,\r\nwith much delicate music. “Die Abreise” shows the reconciliation of\r\na married couple who have begun to drift apart, and the departure\r\nof the over-amorous cavalier who tried to widen the breach for his\r\nown purposes. “Kain” is a weirdly effective one-act drama, of the\r\nrealistic school. “Der Improvisator” has for its libretto a rather weak\r\narrangement of Hugo’s “Angelo, Tyrant of Padua,” while “Tiefland” is\r\nfounded on a Spanish tale, in which true love triumphs over the schemes\r\nof a wicked Alcalde.\r\n\r\n=Hugo Wolf= (Vienna, Austria, 1860—Vienna, 1902) had a constant\r\nstruggle with poverty, and enjoyed but a short period of fame before\r\nyielding to insanity and death. His opera, “Der Corregidor,” is a\r\ndelightful work, in comic vein, and the humorous scenes on the stage\r\nare treated with remarkable animation and skill in the orchestra.\r\nThe Corregidor is a Spanish magistrate, who is too much smitten with\r\nFrasquita, the beautiful wife of the miller, Tio Lucas. The pair play\r\nhim many tricks, and the opera ends with his discomfiture before his\r\nown consort. Wolf’s fame is much increased by the rare power and beauty\r\nof his many songs. Especially worthy of note are the “Feuerreiter,”\r\n“Gebet,” “Gesang Weylas,” and the “_Italienisches Liederbuch_.” His\r\nsymphonic poem, “Penthesilea,” is another important work. His style is\r\nsometimes bizarre and involved, but his themes are always effective and\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n=Other Composers=.—=Max Bruch= (Cologne, Germany, 1838) studied under\r\nHiller, Reinecke, and Breuning. His chief opera, “Hermione,” is not\r\nimportant, but he has won lasting fame by the breadth and nobility\r\nof his epic cantatas, such as “Frithjof,” “Odysseus,” “Arminius,”\r\nand others. His concertos and serenade for violin are favorite works\r\nwith soloists. =Ludwig Thuille=, a friend of Strauss, is given high\r\npraise by musicians, and his new opera “Gugeline” has been well\r\nreceived. =Heinrich Zollner= has won a popular success by his setting\r\nof Hauptmann’s delicate play, “The Sunken Bell.” =Hans Pfitzner=\r\nhas produced an excellent work in his romantic forest-opera, “Die\r\nRose vom Liebesgarten.” =Leo Blech’s= “Alpenkönig und Menschenfeind”\r\nhas received numerous performances, while =E. Klose’s= fairy opera,\r\n“Ilsebill,” is a worthy example of its school.\r\n\r\n=Opera in Germany=.—Since Wagner’s time, there has been no striking\r\ndevelopment in German opera, and his works still remain by far the most\r\nimportant in that field. None can rival him in the power, variety, and\r\nexpressive qualities of his music. Strauss surpasses him in intricacy\r\nand novelty of instrumental effects, but Wagner himself first cleared\r\nthe path in which Strauss was to follow. The greatest successes of\r\nGoldmark are those of twenty and thirty years ago. Humperdinck’s\r\none chief work is frankly popular in style, and its attractiveness\r\ncannot fairly be compared with the grandeur of the music-dramas, even\r\nthough it should found a school of its own. Bungert’s works, though\r\nwell received, have not been given many performances, while many of\r\nthose who have tried to imitate Wagner have echoed merely his outward\r\nmannerisms, and not the inward greatness of his works. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that a world-genius like that of Wagner does not\r\nappear in every country or every century, and that his importance\r\nprevents his successors from gaining their full meed of appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nMaitland, J.

CÉSAR FRANCK.\r\n\r\nCAMILLE SAINT-SAËNS. JULES MASSENET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON LII.\r\n\r\n                     OLD AND NEW SCHOOLS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Saint-Saëns=.—The end of the 19th century in France has been marked\r\nby a decided contrast between the old and the new, Saint-Saëns and\r\nMassenet writing in the older style, while the pupils of Franck have\r\nstriven after novelty in effect. Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (Paris,\r\nFrance, 1835) witnessed the rise and fall of Meyerbeer, and the\r\ntriumphs of Gounod, and was himself famous before the influence of\r\nWagner reached France. His style is marked by great diversity, and\r\ndisplays equal skill in many different veins; but his music always\r\nshows the utmost facility of expression, a mastery of the technic of\r\ncomposing, and a remarkable ease and fluency. His has been a true\r\nmusical development, founded on rational lines. He was always a warm\r\nadmirer of Bach, Beethoven, and the Classical school, and while he\r\nappreciated Liszt, Wagner and other modern masters, he did not abandon\r\nthe old ideas of form and melody. His works show the most exquisite\r\nsymmetry of detail, like that of a finely-carved monument enriched by\r\ndelicate tracery.\r\n\r\n=His Works=.—Saint-Saëns studied at the _Conservatoire_, under Stamaty,\r\nHalévy, and Benoist. Though he failed in trying for the _Prix de Rome_,\r\nhe produced a worthy symphony when only sixteen. In opera, his first\r\nsuccess was the Biblical “Samson and Dalila,” a work of expressive\r\npower and vivid coloring. “Le Timbre d’Argent” and “La Princesse\r\nJaune” are of earlier date. “Le Deluge,” is an operatic cantata.\r\n“Etienne-Marcel” won some success in Paris, while “Henry VIII” is a\r\nskilful blending of old and new styles. “Proserpine” and “Ascanio”\r\nfollowed, while “Phryne” is a dainty example of opéra comique.\r\n“Parysatis,” “Déjanire,” and “Les Barbares” introduce grandiose effects\r\nfor open-air performances. “Helène” is a shorter work, again on a\r\nGrecian subject. The composer’s versatility and smoothness of style\r\nprevent him from obtaining the highest dramatic intensity, but his\r\nmusic is always excellent. In the orchestral field, he has produced\r\nfour later symphonies, five piano concertos (that in G minor being\r\nthe favorite), and two suites. His symphonic poems include “Le Rouet\r\nd’Omphale,” a delicious orchestral spinning-song; “Phaeton” and “La\r\nJeunesse d’Hercule,” also on mythical subjects; and the weird “Danse\r\nMacabre.” His violin concerto in B minor is a great favorite.\r\n\r\n=Massenet=.—Jules Emile Frederic Massenet (Montreaux, France, 1842) is\r\nanother _Conservatoire_ pupil. Rejected at first by Bazin, as lacking\r\ntalent, he worked steadily onward, and from a player in small cafés\r\nbecame one of the foremost figures in French music. His first great\r\ntriumph came with “Marie Madeleine” and “Eve,” which are not strictly\r\noratorios, but are more properly called sacred dramas. “La Vierge” and\r\n“La Terre Promise” are of later date. These works treat their subjects\r\nwith modern spirit and passion, instead of the more classic oratorio\r\nstyle. Massenet is hardly the equal of Saint-Saëns in orchestral\r\nwork, but his “Phedre” overture and his suites of tone-pictures are\r\nremarkably attractive. In opera, he won his spurs with “Le Roi de\r\nLahore,” a spectacular Oriental subject. “Herodiade” is a sacred work,\r\nwhile “Manon” is a graceful setting of Prevost’s novel of that name.\r\n“Le Cid” is not so strong a work, for Massenet’s style is sentimental\r\nand passionate rather than heroic. “Esclairmonde,” with a romantic and\r\nlegendary plot, displays remarkable beauty and richness of effect.\r\n“Werther,” based on Goethe’s novel, is another success. “Le Mage,” an\r\nOriental subject, and “Thais,” with an Egyptian plot, were comparative\r\nfailures. “La Navarraise,” with its love amid battles, is an echo of\r\nItalian realism. Massenet’s tender feeling and vivid emotion show at\r\ntheir best in his later works for the stage—“Le Portrait de Manon,” a\r\ndelightful love-idyl, “Cendrillon,” a fairy opera, “Griselidis,” an old\r\nlegend of wifely constancy, and “Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame.” The last\r\nis a touching story of a despised minstrel who wins favor with the Holy\r\nVirgin by his earnest desire to do something in her name, even if it be\r\nonly to amuse her with his juggling tricks.\r\n\r\n=French Opera=.—Among other French composers for the stage, Meyerbeer,\r\nGounod and Bizet belong to a previous generation. =Delibes= won some\r\nnotice with “Le Roi l’a Dit” and “Sylvia,” but his best work is\r\n“Lakmé,” another example of rich Oriental warmth and color. =Ambroise\r\nThomas= is known chiefly as the composer of “Mignon,” a remarkably\r\ngraceful setting of a libretto from Goethe’s “Wilhelm Meister.” “Le\r\nSonge d’un Nuit d’Été,” an earlier work, has also met with deserved\r\nsuccess, but “Hamlet” is a ridiculous perversion of Shakespeare, and\r\n“Françoise de Rimini” failed to attain real tragic grandeur. =Guiraud=\r\nis known by his comic opera “Piccolino”; =Poise= set many of Molière’s\r\nplays; =Lalo’s= only notable work is “Le Roi d’Ys”; =Godard’s= dainty\r\n“Vivandière” is frankly light in style; while =Salvayre’s= ambitious\r\n“Dame de Monsoreau” is not a great success. =Reyer’s= “Erostrate” and\r\n“La Statue” were praised in their day, but he is better known by two\r\nlater works—“Sigurd,” on the subject of “Die Götterdämmerung,” and\r\n“Salammbô,” a setting of Flaubert’s story of Carthage.\r\n\r\n=Franck and His Influence=.—The new French school is almost\r\nwholly due to the work of one man, César Auguste Franck (Liége,\r\nBelgium, 1822—Paris, 1890). He settled in Paris, and studied at the\r\n_Conservatoire_. Modest and retiring by nature, “le bon père Franck,”\r\nas he was called, divided his time between teaching, composing, and\r\nplaying the organ of the Ste. Clotilde Church. His simple faith and\r\nearnest work recall the spirit of the old mediæval artists, who devoted\r\ntheir lives and their music to the glory of the Lord. Franck’s works\r\nshow a mastery and power that his pupils are scarcely able to equal,\r\nand his compositions have fairly won the esteem that was denied to\r\nthem during the composer’s lifetime. Among them are the great D minor\r\nSymphony, the oratorios “Ruth,” “Rebecca,” and “The Redemption,” the\r\nopera “Hulda,” and the symphonic poems “Psyche” (with voices), “Les\r\nDjinns,” “Les Eolides,” and “Le Chasseur Maudit.” But Franck’s most\r\nnotable work is “Les Beatitudes,” an eight-part oratorio treating the\r\nSermon on the Mount. Franck’s style is radically different from that\r\nof Saint-Saëns or Massenet. It is harmonic rather than melodic, and\r\nextremely modulatory in effect. His progressions remind the hearer\r\nof Wagner; but they do not always possess the broad simplicity that\r\nunderlies Wagner’s most intricate passages. Franck’s pupils have often\r\nfallen into the error of imitating his weakest points, and have brought\r\nabout a style of harmonic vagueness that seems meaningless to many\r\nmodern critics.\r\n\r\n=D’Indy=.—Vincent d’Indy (Paris, France, 1852) is the greatest of\r\nFranck’s pupils, and the leader of the modern French school. As\r\nconductor, he has been an ardent champion of new and little-known\r\nworks. His own compositions include many forms, and have all\r\nattracted attention. His first great work to reach the public was\r\nthe “Piccolomini” overture, a part of his orchestral trilogy based\r\non Schiller’s “Wallenstein.” Two important vocal compositions are\r\n“La Chevauchée du Cid,” for baritone, chorus, and orchestra, and “Le\r\nChant de la Cloche,” a dramatic legend that won the prize given by the\r\ncity of Paris. In the orchestral field, “Antony and Cleopatra” is an\r\nearly work, as is also the “Jean Hunyadi” symphony. Of d’Indy’s two\r\nlater symphonies, the first, based on a mountain air, contains many\r\npassages of sweetness and purity, while the second is more involved and\r\nmodulatory in style. His earliest symphonic poem, “La Forêt Enchantée”\r\nis a delicate tone-picture based on a ballad of Uhland; “Saugefleurie”\r\nis founded on a story by de Bonnières; while “Istar” is inspired by\r\nparts of the old Assyrian epic “Idzubar.” D’Indy’s music is hardly\r\npopular in style, for its themes are not definitely melodic; but his\r\nskill in weaving them into an orchestral tissue is admired by all\r\nmusicians. In opera, “Les Burgraves” and the lighter “Attendez-Moi\r\nSous l’Orme” are youthful works, while “Fervaal” is a music-drama\r\n(_action musicale_) on a Druidic subject, and “L’Etranger” is symbolic\r\nin style. He has written some important works in musical literature and\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n=Charpentier=.—Gustave Charpentier (Dieuze, France, 1860) was a\r\n_Conservatoire_ pupil. The _Prix de Rome_ took him to Italy, and his\r\nlife there resulted in the pleasing orchestral suite “Impressions\r\nd’Italie.” This consists of five tone-pictures, entitled, “Serenade,”\r\n“At the Fountain,” “On Muleback,” “On the Summits,” and “Naples.”\r\nOn his return he lived among the working-people of Montmartre, and\r\ntheir life is reflected in his later works. “La Vie du Poète” is a\r\nsymphony-drama, giving episodes in the life of an unsuccessful genius.\r\nIn the beginning, all is aspiration and enthusiasm. Then doubt follows.\r\nAt first the poet is consoled by the serene beauty of the summer night,\r\nbut his fears gain the upper hand. Then comes a picture of impotent\r\nraging and vain anger against fate, after which the poet tries to blot\r\nout his sorrows in the cheap gayety of the city. “La Couronnement de la\r\nMuse” is a pantomime, written with the idea that a working girl in each\r\ntown or city should annually be chosen and crowned amid festivities.\r\nThe composer’s greatest work, however, is the opera “Louise.” This\r\ntells the story of a poor working girl, whose parents forbid her to\r\nmarry the somewhat wayward Julien. At the latter’s persuasion, she\r\nfinally flies with him. Her parents try to reclaim her, but again she\r\nis drawn away, and her father is left shaking his fist at the terrible\r\ncity that entices young girls from their homes. The music of “Louise”\r\nis full of power and realism, and even the street cries of Paris are\r\nechoed in its measures.\r\n\r\n=Bruneau=.—Operatic realism has found a more prolific, if less\r\nsuccessful, champion in Alfred Bruneau (Paris, France, 1857), another\r\n_Conservatoire_ pupil. He has confined himself to librettos drawn from\r\nthe novels of Zola. “Le Rêve,” an early work, is a psychological study\r\nof love, in the person of the dreamy Angelique, who dies from excess\r\nof happiness when her wedding is completed. “L’Attaque du Moulin” is\r\na spirited story of the Franco-Prussian war, set in a more melodic\r\nand popular style. “Messidor” is again symbolic in style, the theme\r\nbeing a contrast between greed for gold and the simple pleasure of\r\nhonest toil. “L’Ouragan” deals with the tempests of human passion and\r\njealousy, as well as the hurricanes of nature. “L’Enfant Roi,” and the\r\nmusic to “La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret,” are more recent works. Bruneau is\r\nsincere and earnest in his efforts at realism, but his music is often\r\nheavy and uninspired. He has produced works in other fields, among\r\nthem being a great “Requiem,” a “Heroic Overture,” and the symphonic\r\npoem “Penthesilée,” for voice and orchestra. His three books on French\r\ncomposers, and his many criticisms, have made him known in the domain\r\nof musical literature.\r\n\r\n=Debussy=.—The new school of French music finds its most radical\r\nexpression in the compositions of Achille Claude Debussy (Paris,\r\nFrance, 1862). A musician of great gifts, he chooses to imbue his\r\nmusic with a studied vagueness of effect, and wanders through a maze\r\nof changing keys and harmonies. Many persons find the result wholly\r\nincomprehensible at first, but on repeated hearing his works show\r\na weird, elusive beauty that is worshipped by his adherents as the\r\nacme of musical expression. He, too, was a _Conservatoire_ student,\r\nand won the _Prix de Rome_ with the cantata “L’Enfant Prodigue.”\r\nTwo lyric scenes, “La Demoiselle Élue,” and “Chimène,” first drew\r\nattention to the young artist. Then came the orchestral prelude to\r\nMallarmé’s “L’Après-Midi d’un Faune,” a delicately-woven rhapsody,\r\nwith much beauty and much weirdness in its harmonies. The Nocturnes,\r\nentitled, “Nuages” and “Fêtes,” are described by De Bréville as\r\npossessing the ethereal charm of a perfume that pervades the air,\r\nbut defies analysis. A string quartet is in stricter form, but the\r\n“Proses Lyriques,” on subjects of Beaudelaire, also the “Chansons de\r\nBilitis” and “Les Estampes” for piano, again show the free style.\r\nDebussy’s most ambitious work is “Pelleas et Mélisande,” an opera based\r\non Maeterlinck’s play of that name. The poet’s words offer the same\r\nshadowy suggestions that the composer gives in music, and the harmonic\r\neffects of vague mystery are entirely in place here.\r\n\r\n=Chausson=.—Ernest Chausson (Paris, France, 1855—Limay, 1899) proved\r\nhimself a composer of real greatness, and was still in the prime of\r\nlife when he met with a fatal bicycle accident, in 1899. Trained for\r\nlaw, he turned to music from choice, as Schumann did before him. A\r\npupil of Massenet and Franck, he combined the direct expression of the\r\nformer with the harmonic style of the latter, and produced works of\r\na most attractive orchestral coloring. Among his compositions are a\r\nworthy symphony, the beautiful symphonic poem “Viviane,” the orchestral\r\npictures “Solitude dans les Bois” and “Soir de Fête,” a “Poëme” for\r\nviolin and orchestra, some chamber-music, and many pleasing songs and\r\nchoruses. His one great opera was “Le Roi Arthus.” His works are full\r\nof tenderness and charm, yet not lacking in vigor and breadth; they\r\nhave the modern harmonic richness and orchestral color, and are growing\r\nsteadily in favor.\r\n\r\n=Other Composers=.—=Alexis Emanuel Chabrier=, wholly self-taught\r\nin music, produced the brilliant orchestral rhapsody “España,” an\r\nattractive “Suite Pastorale,” a lively “Marche Joyeuse,” and some\r\neffective cantatas. In opera, his “Le Roi Malgré Lui” is an excellent\r\nexample in lighter vein, but his greatest work is “Gwendoline,” on\r\na Viking subject. Of all the Frenchmen, he was the one best fitted\r\nto attempt the bold, virile style required by the libretto. The most\r\nprominent orchestral writer of the younger generation is =Paul Dukas=,\r\nwhose “Apprenti Sorcier” treats a humorous subject with rare skill.\r\n=Théodore Dubois=, for many years head of the _Conservatoire_, is best\r\nknown by his oratorios, such as “Paradise Lost,” and his “Frithjof”\r\noverture. =Gabriel Fauré=, the organist, who succeeded Dubois as\r\ndirector of the _Conservatoire_ in 1905, has produced a symphony,\r\ntwo string quartets, and a number of songs whose intricacy cannot\r\nobscure their exquisite grace. Other organist-composers are =Charles\r\nMarie Widor=, who wrote the opera “Maître Ambros” and the ballet\r\n“La Korrigane,” and =Alexandre Guilmant=, known by his great organ\r\nsymphony and sonatas. =Bourgault-Ducoudray= has written many cantatas,\r\nand made a valuable collection of Breton Folk-songs. =Pierné=,\r\n=Coquard=, =Erlanger= and =Hue= won their fame in opera, while\r\n=Duparc= gained notice with his symphonic poem “Lenore.” =Ropartz=\r\nand =de Bréville= rank with the best of Franck’s pupils, while among\r\nwomen-composers, =Augusta Holmés= won renown by her mastery of broad\r\norchestral effects, and =Cécile Chaminade= is known by her dainty songs\r\nand piano pieces.\r\n\r\n=The New French School=.—When Wagner showed the harmonic resources\r\nof the modern orchestra, he led the way for a host of imitators, who\r\nhave often done more harm than good. Such operas as “Fervaal” and\r\n“Gwendoline,” in large measure the result of “Tristan,” are proper\r\napplications of this style. But the idea of finding new harmonic\r\neffects has exerted its influence on orchestral writers also, and some\r\nmodern composers, especially in France, have devoted all their energy\r\nto this, and have apparently sacrificed all thoughts of musical beauty.\r\nThe French have even invented the term “cérébral,” which describes a\r\ncomposer who puts no emotion or feeling into his music, but works it\r\nout wholly from the brain. Thus many of the modern compositions must be\r\nregarded as great orchestral experiments, and the composer who combines\r\nthis instrumental technic with real feeling and directness of utterance\r\nis the one who will meet with the greatest success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nHervey, Arthur.—Masters of French Music.\r\n\r\nHervey, Arthur.—Music in the 19th Century: France.\r\n\r\nElson, A.—Modern Composers of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhich French composers represent the older style; which the new?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of the works of Saint-Saëns.\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of the works of Massenet.\r\n\r\nName other important opera composers in France.\r\n\r\nWho was the leader of the new French school?

This is what took place in Italy\r\nduring the 19th century, and the country that produced Palestrina and\r\nthe Scarlattis seemed for a time to understand nothing but the trivial\r\noperatic melodies of Rossini’s successors. In 1850, there were scarcely\r\nany concert halls in the country, and even the churches were content\r\nwith operatic airs set to sacred words. Soon after this, Pinelli tried\r\nto give an orchestral concert, with sixty musicians; and the box-office\r\nreceipts left only fourteen francs with which to pay them. Sgambati\r\nproduced a Beethoven symphony, but had to do it at his own expense.\r\nAs late as 1879, Saint-Saëns, who gave an organ recital at Milan,\r\nfound the organ scarcely fit for an artist to play upon. In opera,\r\nit was only the broad judgment of Verdi that was able to look beyond\r\nthe borders of his native land, and his “Aïda,” as well as Boïto’s\r\n“Mefistofele,” was the beginning of a new order of things.\r\n\r\n=Mascagni=.—In 1890, the publisher Sonzogno offered a prize for the\r\nbest one-act opera submitted to him, and this prize was awarded to\r\nPietro Mascagni (Leghorn, Italy, 1863), then an unimportant musical\r\nleader at Cerignola. Mascagni was the son of a baker, who wished him to\r\nstudy law, and locked him up because he practiced the piano in secret.\r\nThe boy was rescued by his uncle, and under the protection of Count\r\nFlorestan pursued his studies at the Milan Conservatory. The opera\r\nthat brought him such fame, which has since become world-wide, was\r\n“Cavalleria Rusticana,” or “Rustic Chivalry,” based on a tale by Verga.\r\nThe scene is a village square, before a church. The heroine, Santuzza,\r\nis forsaken by Turiddu, who carries on an intrigue with Lola, wife of\r\nthe carter Alfio. Santuzza, in despair, denounces him to Alfio, who\r\nchallenges and kills him. The music is hardly of the highest standard;\r\nbut it is popular and vigorous in style, and intensely powerful. The\r\nwork is scarcely comparable to the music-dramas, yet every number is\r\nanimated by the spirit of the words, and it is therefore dramatically\r\ntrue. Among the many favorite selections from its score are the\r\n“Siciliana” of Turiddu (sung as part of the overture, before the\r\ncurtain rises), the broad and noble “Regina Coeli,” Lola’s serenely\r\nconfident aria, “My King of Roses,” and the jolly “Brindisi,” or\r\ndrinking chorus, to say nothing of the saccharine “Intermezzo.” The\r\npower and vividness of “Rustic Chivalry” made it an epoch-making work;\r\nbut Mascagni’s later operas have not met with the same success. They\r\ninclude “L’Amico Fritz,” “William Ratcliff,” “Silvano,” “Iris,” “Le\r\nMaschere,” and the one-act “Amica.”\r\n\r\n=Leoncavallo=.—The success of “Rustic Chivalry” aroused Ruggiero\r\nLeoncavallo (Naples, Italy, 1858) to try his hand in the same school.\r\nHis early opera “Chatterton” was practically a failure, while his\r\nambitious “Medici” trilogy (“I Medici,” “Savonarola,” and “Cesare\r\nBorgia”) met with no better reception. In “I Pagliacci,” however, he\r\nproduced a work of the new school, that has taken its place beside\r\nMascagni’s opera as an example of the new realism. The “Pagliacci”\r\nare strolling players. Canio, the leader, is aroused to madness by\r\nlearning of the proposed elopement of his wife, Nedda, but she will not\r\nbetray her lover’s name. They enact for the villagers a mimic tragedy\r\nof love and jealousy, but Canio makes it real by actually stabbing the\r\nfaithless Nedda. Her lover then leaps from the audience to save her,\r\nonly to meet a similar death at Canio’s hands. The music to this play\r\nis of a higher standard than Mascagni’s, though less directly popular\r\nin style. “Trilby” and “Zaza” are later works of little importance,\r\nwhile “Roland of Berlin,” composed by order for a libretto by the\r\nEmperor of Germany, aroused only passing interest.\r\n\r\n=Puccini=.—When the great Verdi retired from active life as a composer,\r\nhe named as his probable successor, Giacomo Puccini (Lucca, Italy,\r\n1858). Descended from a musical family, Puccini could devote himself\r\nto his art without parental opposition, and he completed his studies\r\nunder Ponchielli, at the Milan Conservatory. His “Le Villi” was really\r\nthe origin of the modern one-act plays. “Edgar” resembles “Carmen”\r\nsomewhat, but has a weak libretto, and music that is not always\r\neffective. “Manon Lescaut” is rather a succession of detached scenes\r\nthan a single whole, but at times it displays a mastery of dramatic\r\ncontrast far beyond Massenet. “La Bohême” is a delightfully sympathetic\r\nsetting of Murger’s well-known novel, and its scenes of rollicking\r\ndefiance to poverty and hunger remind one of the composer’s early\r\nstruggles. The note of haunting sweetness that pervades the score marks\r\nPuccini as a man of rare musical gifts. In “Tosca,” the heroine of that\r\nname loves the artist, Mario, who aids a political refugee, at the risk\r\nof his own life. The governor, Scarpia, who captures him, loves Tosca\r\nalso, and tortures him to make her yield to his desires. To save Mario,\r\nshe consents, but stabs Scarpia at the last moment. But Scarpia’s\r\ntreachery survives him, for the pretended execution, which was to let\r\nMario escape, turns out to be real, and Tosca takes her own life in\r\ndespair. The music shows a ripe mastery of dramatic power. The climax\r\nof the first act, merging into the church service, and the tragic power\r\nof the second, well contrasted with the strains of a festival cantata\r\nthat float in through the window, are scenes that win unqualified\r\npraise from all critics. “Madame Butterfly,” on a Japanese subject,\r\nlacked the necessary delicacy, but the two preceding works have made\r\nPuccini the foremost man in Italian opera today.\r\n\r\n=The Realistic School=.—Many composers of the “Verismo” school adopt a\r\nrealism that deals only with the more brutal side of life, and their\r\nplots, though strong, are not always pleasing. =Giordano’s= “Andrea\r\nChenier” and “Fedora” show musical worth, but =Spinelli’s= “A Basso\r\nPorto,” =Coronaro’s= “Festa a Marina,” and =Tasca’s= “A Santa Lucia”\r\npicture some of the coarsest phases of existence. Yet this defect may\r\nbe condoned when we consider that the movement has infused new life and\r\npower into Italian music. Among those composers who have stood somewhat\r\naloof from the new school, =Franchetti= is the most noteworthy. His\r\noperas include “Cristoforo Colombo,” “Germania,” and the later “Figlia\r\ndi Jorio,” and he has written symphonies that place him among the best\r\nof the later Italian composers.\r\n\r\n=Perosi=.—The revival in sacred music has been brought about wholly\r\nby one man, Don Lorenzo Perosi (Tortona, Italy, 1872). He studied\r\nfaithfully, in spite of sickness—first at Milan, then under the\r\nlearned Fr. Haberl at Ratisbon. He became a conductor at Imola, and\r\nafterwards at Venice, where he led his forces with decided vigor.\r\nSoon after this, he began to compose the oratorios that have made\r\nhim so famous. His sacred trilogy, “The Passion of Christ,” included\r\nthe “Last Supper,” the “Sermon on the Mount,” and the “Death of the\r\nRedeemer.” It made a sensation that reverberated through all Italy,\r\nand caused his appointment in the following year as honorary master of\r\nthe Papal Choir. He has been untiring as a composer, producing no less\r\nthan fifteen masses and nearly a dozen oratorios. Among the latter are\r\n“The Transfiguration,” “The Annunciation,” “The Raising of Lazarus,”\r\n“The Birth of the Redeemer,” and the two-part “Moses.” He writes with\r\nenthusiasm, and sees the actual picture before him while he works. His\r\nmusic does not possess the calm dignity shown by Palestrina, but its\r\nsemi-popular style is well adapted to his hearers, and may lead the way\r\nto something better.\r\n\r\n=Sgambati=.—The leading position among Italy’s new symphonic composers\r\nbelongs to Giovanni Sgambati (Rome, Italy, 1843). Like many musicians,\r\nhe was at first destined for a lawyer’s career, but began his musical\r\nstudies in time to become known as a boy-prodigy. He settled in Rome,\r\nand soon grew famous as a pianist. He played Beethoven, Schumann and\r\nChopin, and did much to introduce their works into Italy. He planned\r\na trip to Germany, but when Liszt came to Rome he remained there to\r\nstudy under that great master. At this time his earlier compositions,\r\nmostly chamber works, brought him into notice in a new field. These\r\nquartets and quintets were followed by a festival overture, a piano\r\nconcerto, and three symphonies in succession. His compositions are\r\nsomewhat lacking in spontaneity, but they display great learning, and\r\nundeniable skill. His works show the influence of Liszt and Berlioz,\r\nmingled with the stricter style of the old Italian contrapuntal writers.\r\n\r\n=Other Orchestral Composers=.—With Sgambati, =Martucci= also deserves\r\nmention in the instrumental field. He became identified with the\r\nartistic life of Naples, where he fought a similar fight for the cause\r\nof good music. Among several others, =Del Valle de Paz= is noted\r\nfor his valuable educational work in Florence, no less than for his\r\ncompositions. =Busoni=, so well known as a pianist, has also tried his\r\nhand at orchestral writing in the most extreme modern vein. Eugenio di\r\nPirani is another composer who has identified himself with the German\r\ninstrumental school. The literary champion of the new order of things\r\nhas been Luigi Torchi, whose work in the magazines deserves the highest\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n=Bossi=.—The most prominent figure among the younger devotees of the\r\nGerman style is Marco Enrico Bossi (Salo, Italy, 1861). He studied\r\norgan at first, and for ten years held the post of organist in the Como\r\nCathedral. Four years of teaching at Naples were followed by similar\r\nwork in Venice, where he gained deserved prominence. His compositions\r\nshow great originality, and include many different forms. An early\r\noverture was given at the Crystal Palace, in London, which he visited\r\nduring a piano tour. The one-act opera “Paquita” was followed by\r\n“L’Angelo della Notte” and “Il Veggento,” also a large work for the\r\nMilan Exposition of 1905. He has composed many masses, and the oratorio\r\n“Christus.” A more recent triumph is “Paradise Lost,” with Milton’s\r\nwords—a work suggested by Mme. Rubinstein. His organ concerto won\r\na decided success at the Chicago Fair, and his symphonic poem, “Il\r\nCieco,” has been well received. He aims to blend the old polyphonic\r\nstyle with the rich instrumentation of modern Germany.\r\n\r\n=Buongiorno=.—Among the adherents of German standards, Buongiorno\r\n(Bonito, Italy, 1864) is one who has devoted himself to opera. Studying\r\nat the Naples Conservatory, he became leader of an operetta troupe,\r\nfor which he wrote many popular works. His first great opera was “Das\r\nMädchenherz” (Il Cuor delle Fanciulle), which treats with admirable\r\ndelicacy the love-story of Alba and Marino. She grows to be court\r\nsinger, and defeats an older rival, but ambition makes her careless of\r\nlove. Marino becomes a priest, and only when Alba is old and forsaken\r\ndoes his consolation show her what she has missed. The music displays\r\nmuch emotional beauty, and the “play within the play,” at the ducal\r\ncourt, allows the composer to imitate Bach, Handel, and other old\r\nmasters with exquisite humor. “Michelangelo and Rolla” is a one-act\r\nplay, again uniting a subject of real poetic worth with beautiful\r\nmusic. These two operas are far removed from the crudities of the\r\n“Verismo” school.\r\n\r\n=Wolf-Ferrari=.—A composer who may fitly follow German ideals is\r\nErmanno Wolf-Ferrari, son of a German father and an Italian mother.\r\nHis “Cenerentola” (Cinderella) has a rather tedious first act, but the\r\nsecond act shows all the appealing beauty and sympathetic feeling that\r\nmark the new romanticism. “Le Donne Curiose” is an excellent example of\r\nsparkling comedy, and has won much success in Germany. It treats of the\r\nmisadventures of some women, who try to investigate a mysterious club\r\nformed by their husbands. A work in a different vein is the composer’s\r\n“Vita Nuova,” a fresh and inspired setting of sonnets and other\r\nselections from Dante’s great work.\r\n\r\n=Music in Italy=.—It is difficult for one nation to adopt the musical\r\nexpression of another, but this is practically what Italy has done.\r\nVerdi first gave up the trivial melodies so dear to the Italian\r\npopulace, and adopted a worthier style. Like Boïto, he denied being\r\ninfluenced by Wagner, but his works show that he felt the force of\r\nthe German master’s orchestral power. The realistic school of opera\r\nhas brought into Italian music a vividness and power that are not\r\nsurpassed by any other nation, while a still later generation has\r\nstriven to cast off the crudities of this school and produce works of\r\nreal orchestral value. Italy has already done much, and the progress of\r\nthe last few decades seems to predict a bright future for her music.\r\n\r\n=Music in Spain=.—During the last half-century, Spain, too, has\r\ndeveloped some native composers. One of the best is =Isaac Albeniz=,\r\nwhose “Pepita Ximenes” is a delightful comedy of love and intrigue.\r\nHis Zarzuelas also have met with success. =Felipe Pedrell=, well known\r\nin European journalism, has written an ambitious trilogy on subjects\r\nillustrating the national motto, “Patria, Fides, Amor.” Larrocha,\r\nVives, De Lara, and Antonio Noguerra are also worthy of mention. The\r\nZarzuela is the peculiar Spanish form of light opera, resembling the\r\nItalian opera buffa, but possessing more brilliance and delicacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nStreatfeild, R.

GRANVILLE BANTOCK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON LIV.\r\n\r\n                      ENGLAND AND THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Music in England=.—In the Middle Ages, the much-used art of\r\nCounterpoint was developed by the people of England and the\r\nNetherlands. In the Elizabethan age, the music of England was scarcely\r\nless important than her literature. Under Charles II, she could boast\r\nof Henry Purcell, one of the few great names in music. But in the 19th\r\ncentury her musical glory had faded, and sentimental songs and popular\r\nballad-operas seemed all that she could produce. Her musical leaders\r\nwent bravely to work, importing such composers as Mendelssohn and\r\nWagner, and building up great music schools. There was, however, no\r\nhigh standard of taste in the country, so the task proceeded slowly.\r\nA race that is gifted with real love of music, and possesses worthy\r\nFolk-songs, can easily develop great composers; but England, like the\r\nUnited States, is too commercial for the best results. Dvořák once said\r\nof the English people: “They do not love music; they respect it.”\r\n\r\n=Stanford=.—For some years, a group of five men were the advance guard\r\nof England’s development. While none of them showed any remarkable\r\ninspiration, their work was learned and thorough, and prepared the way\r\nfor men of more originality. The foremost of them was Charles Villiers\r\nStanford (Dublin, Ireland, 1852). After studying under Reinecke and\r\nKiel, he became organist and conductor at Cambridge University. His\r\nworks include five symphonies (among them the “Irish”), two overtures,\r\nan “Irish Rhapsody,” a piano concerto, two oratorios, and several\r\ncantatas; but he is best known by his operas. Of these, “Shamus\r\nO’Brien” is most popular, because of its subject, while “Much Ado\r\nabout Nothing” shows much grace and elegance. “The Canterbury Pilgrims”\r\naims to picture old England, as the “Meistersinger” did old Germany.\r\nStanford’s work is always carefully planned, but not deeply inspired.\r\n\r\n=Parry=.—Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (Bournemouth, England, 1848)\r\nfills a similar position at Oxford University. He has composed four\r\nsymphonies, and two overtures, the “Tragic” and “Guillem de Cabestanh,”\r\nbut his most important work has been in the field of oratorio. His\r\nsacred works include “Judith,” “De Profundis,” “Job,” and “King\r\nSaul,” also a great Magnificat and Te Deum. These, too, show excess\r\nof erudition, and are somewhat academic in character; but in all\r\nhis choral work, Parry displays a breadth and power that deserve\r\nhigh praise. His incidental music to the “Frogs” and the “Birds” of\r\nAristophanes is also worthy of mention. His contributions to musical\r\nliterature are very important.\r\n\r\n=Other Musical Leaders=.—=Alexander Campbell Mackenzie= (Edinburgh,\r\nScotland, 1847) became teacher and conductor in his native city,\r\nafterwards joining the University forces. His “Colomba,” an early\r\nopera, displays much real dramatic worth; more, in fact, than his\r\nlater productions. Among his other works are two oratorios, “The Rose\r\nof Sharon” and “Bethlehem,” while his entr’actes for “Manfred” and\r\nhis powerful “Coriolanus” music also deserve notice. =Frederic Hymen\r\nCowen= (Kingston, Jamaica, 1852) studied with Reinecke, Moscheles, and\r\nKiel, and conducted in many cities, including Melbourne, Australia.\r\nHe has written two oratorios, “Ruth” and “The Deluge,” four operas,\r\nincluding “Pauline” and “Harold,” and several cantatas, of which “The\r\nSleeping Beauty” and “The Water Lily” are delightfully poetic. But\r\nhis six symphonies are his most valuable works, the “Scandinavian,”\r\n“Idyllic,” and “Welsh” ranking in the order named. =Arthur Goring\r\nThomas= (Eastbourne, England, 1850—London, 1892) devoted himself to\r\nthe lighter style of romantic music, in which his opera “Esmeralda”\r\nand his posthumous cantata “The Swan and the Skylark” met with the\r\nmost success. With these five should be classed =Sir J. Frederick\r\nBridge=, often called in jest “The Westminster Bridge” because of\r\nhis post as organist in Westminster Abbey. His works include many\r\ncantatas, oratorios, and lesser sacred pieces. His teaching has been\r\nmade delightful by his inimitable humor, which often appears in\r\nhis compositions also. Other men of this school are =Walter Cecil\r\nMacfarren=, =Sir Walter Parratt=, and =Charles Harford Lloyd=, while\r\nthe excellent work of =Sir Arthur Sullivan= in light opera must not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n=Elgar=.—In Edward William Elgar (Broadheath, England, 1857) we find\r\na man who is possessed of real originality, and takes rank with the\r\nworld’s great composers. This is all the more remarkable when we\r\nconsider that he is almost wholly self-taught. Son of an organist, he\r\nsoon grew familiar with the instrument, and gained further musical\r\nexperience by playing in a theatre orchestra at Worcester. Too poor to\r\ngo to Germany, he lived by teaching violin at first. He went through\r\nvarious books on harmony and orchestration, gaining much from Mozart’s\r\n“Thorough-Bass School,” and Parry’s articles in Grove’s dictionary.\r\nHe ruled a score for the same number of bars and instruments as in\r\nMozart’s G-minor symphony, and wrote a work in this form—an exercise\r\nwhich he considers of the utmost value. When he obtained a new\r\norchestral work, he would go into the fields to study it.\r\n\r\n=His Works=.—Elgar first won attention by his cantata “The Black\r\nKnight,” given at a Worcester festival. Its success caused him\r\nto continue with “The Light of Life” and “King Olaf,” the latter\r\ndisplaying much direct power and orchestral mastery. His “Variations,”\r\nwhich won a London triumph, possess great intrinsic worth; but each one\r\nis intended to portray some friend of the composer’s, and the work thus\r\nhas an added meaning for his acquaintances. “The Dream of Gerontius,”\r\na setting of Cardinal Newman’s sacred poem, met with remarkable favor.\r\nIt is not altogether unified in effect, but contains many passages of\r\ncompelling beauty and sublimity. It has been heard in many countries,\r\nand one German writer considers it the greatest sacred work of the\r\nlast century, except the “Requiem” of Brahms. “The Apostles,” a later\r\noratorio, is the first part of a proposed trilogy. It displays similar\r\nexcellence, but at times is too mystic and psychological in effect.\r\nOther works by Elgar are three overtures: the attractive “Froissart,”\r\nthe broadly-popular “Cockaigne” (typical of London), and the more\r\nrecent “In the South.” The music to “Diarmid and Grania” is also\r\nworth mention, while the five songs, entitled, “Sea Pictures,” show\r\nremarkable breadth and nobility.\r\n\r\n=Coleridge-Taylor=.—England boasts the first great negro composer in\r\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor (London, England, 1875). Son of an educated\r\nAfrican father and a white mother, he began violin lessons at six.\r\nAt a more mature age, he studied piano with Ashton and composition\r\nwith Stanford. His early works included a number of anthems, some\r\nchamber-music, and a symphony in A-minor. For his beloved violin he\r\nwrote the passionate “Southern Love-Songs” and “African Romances,”\r\nalso the “Hiawatha” sketches. In 1898, he became world-famous by his\r\ncantata “Hiawatha’s Wedding-Feast,” which he followed with “The Death\r\nof Minnehaha” and “Hiawatha’s Departure.” These display a strength and\r\nprofusion of passion that sway all hearers, and the glowing richness\r\nof the instrumentation forms an appropriate frame for Longfellow’s\r\npicture. Later vocal works are “The Atonement” and “The Blind Girl of\r\nCastel-Cuillé.” His other compositions include an orchestral ballade\r\nwith violin, an Idyll, a Solemn Prelude, the music to “Herod,” and four\r\nwaltzes. All show breadth of treatment, and effects of real beauty\r\nattained by simple means.\r\n\r\n=Bantock=.—Some younger composers have headed a movement for greater\r\noriginality, under the lead of Granville Bantock (London, England,\r\n1868). His one-act operas “Caedmar” and “The Pearl of Iran” show much\r\nwarmth of color, and his musical ideas are always worthy of the great\r\nliterary conceptions in which he delights. His two overtures, “Eugene\r\nAram” and “Saul,” the suite of “Russian Scenes,” and the more recent\r\nrhapsody, “The Time Spirit,” are the work of a truly musical nature.\r\nHis greatest effort, however, is a set of twenty-four symphonic poems,\r\nillustrating Southey’s “Curse of Kehama.”\r\n\r\n=Other Composers=.—In the new movement are William Wallace, Erskine\r\nAllon, Reginald Steggall, Stanley Hawley, and Arthur Hinton. Clarence\r\nLucas and Cyril Scott are two other young men of prominence.\r\n\r\n=Edward German= is a composer of remarkable gifts, for he attains\r\neffects of the utmost grace and musical beauty by the simplest diatonic\r\nthemes. His “Rival Poets” and “Merrie England” are worthy examples of\r\nlight opera, while the “English Fantasia,” the symphonic poem “Hamlet,”\r\nthe suite “The Seasons,” and the “Welsh Rhapsody” are all works of\r\npleasing freshness and originality. German has also made a name in the\r\nspecial field of incidental music, his settings including “Romeo and\r\nJuliet,” “As You Like It,” “Much Ado about Nothing,” “The Tempest,”\r\nand several other plays. In a period when many composers are losing\r\nthemselves in the intricacies of the modern orchestral style, the clear\r\nsimplicity of German’s compositions is an example of the utmost value.\r\n\r\n=The Belgian School: Benoit=.—The new school of Belgium, fostered by\r\nthe Brussels Conservatory, owes its origin chiefly to Peter Benoit\r\n(Harelbeke, Flanders, 1834—Antwerp, 1901), who broadened its influence\r\nby his teaching at the Flemish School of Music, in Antwerp. His early\r\nopera, “Het Dorp in t’ Gebergte” (The Village in the Mountains),\r\nshowed delightful local color. A second opera, a mass, a concerto, and\r\na choral symphony increased his fame, but he is identified chiefly\r\nwith the cantata. His great works in this field include “Oorlog”\r\n(War), “Lucifer,” “De Schelde,” “De Rhyn,” the Rubens cantata, and\r\n“Promethée.” They are modern in effect, and show breadth of conception\r\nand real inspiration, united with ripe technical mastery. They have\r\nbeen described as great decorative pictures in tone, suggesting vistas\r\nof grand palaces, armies in battle array, rich fields of grain, mystic\r\nvisions of the spirit world, or gorgeous triumphal marches.\r\n\r\n=Gilson=.—Paul Gilson (Brussels, Belgium, 1865) has written for\r\norchestra a Dramatic Overture, a Festival Overture, a Canadian and an\r\nIrish Fantasy, half a dozen suites, the “Bucolics” of Virgil, and other\r\nlesser works. But his best-known composition is the set of symphonic\r\nsketches entitled, “La Mer.” This illustrates a poem of Levis,\r\nfrequently read before the performance. The different movements depict\r\nsunrise at sea, and the many-colored splendors of dawn; the rollicking\r\nsongs and lively dances of the seaman; a love-duet and parting between\r\na sailor and his sweetheart; and a fatal tempest, in which the themes\r\nof the sailors’ choruses are introduced in mocking irony as the ship\r\ngoes down. Through it all runs a vein of poetic fancy, well suggesting\r\nthe beauty and mystery of the sea. The oratorio “Francesca da Rimini”\r\nis another strong work, the best of Gilson’s productions in that form.\r\n\r\n=Lekeu=.—Guillaume Lekeu (Verviers, Belgium, 1870-1894) was a composer\r\nwhose early death cut short a career of great promise. His chief\r\nstudies were pursued in Paris, where he came under the elevating\r\ninfluence of Franck. The subtle delicacy of his harmonic effects is a\r\nresult of this teaching, and Lekeu seems like a member of the French\r\nschool who strayed across the border by mistake. His early cantata\r\n“Andromède,” and his Fantasie on popular Angevin airs, gained him some\r\nnotice. His works include two Symphonic Studies, an attractive “Poeme”\r\nfor violin and orchestra, and an exquisite Adagio for violin, ’cello,\r\nand strings. His greatest vocal composition is the “Chant Lyrique,” for\r\nchorus and orchestra, but he has produced many songs of lofty melodic\r\nstyle. His music is marked by great originality and fertility of\r\ninvention, but tinged with a spirit of melancholy and gloom.\r\n\r\n=Other Composers=.—=Edgar Tinel= (Sinaai, Flanders, 1854) is another\r\npupil of the Brussels Conservatory, where he studied with Fétis. His\r\ngreat work is the three-part oratorio “Franciscus,” treating the story\r\nof St. Francis of Assisi. Other works are “Sainte Godelieve” and the\r\nmusic to “Polyeucte.”\r\n\r\n=Jan Blockx= (Antwerp, Belgium, 1851) is the most popular opera\r\ncomposer of his country. His greatest success is the “Herbergprinses”\r\n(Princess of the Inn), a work with a strong dramatic plot and music\r\nof remarkable freshness and vigor. “Thyl Uylenspiegel,” in Blockx’s\r\nopera of that name, is no longer the graceless rogue of the old German\r\nstory, but a popular hero who rescues Maestricht from the Spaniards.\r\nOther operas of this composer are “The Bride of the Sea,” and “Maître\r\nMartin,” an earlier work. Other composers prominent in the new movement\r\nare Keurvels, Wambach, Mortelmans, Vleeshouwer, and Mathieu. The first\r\nplace among the women is occupied by Juliette Folville, the young\r\nviolinist, who has written the opera “Attala,” a march, parts of a\r\nsymphony, and many smaller works.\r\n\r\n=Music in Holland=.—=Richard Hol= was for many years the Nestor of\r\nthe Dutch composers. His fame was assured by the patriotic hymn,\r\n“Comme je t’aime, O mon pays,” and his long career of activity was\r\nof great service to the cause of music in Holland. He was a prolific\r\ncomposer, and an excellent critic and journalist. =Julius Roentgen=,\r\nwho studied under Reinecke and Lachner, was better known as pianist\r\nthan as composer, but produced an excellent concerto, also “Das Gebet,”\r\nfor chorus and orchestra, and other works. The best of the younger\r\nmen are =Bernard Zweers= and =Alphonse Diepenbrock=, while others\r\ndeserving mention are Van t’Kruys, Gottfried Mann, Dirk Schaefer, and\r\nthe Brandt-Buys brothers. Among the women-composers, Catherine van\r\nRennes and Hendrika van Tussen-Broek have done excellently in small\r\nforms, while Cornelia van Oosterzee attempts ambitious orchestral work,\r\nand Cora Dopper has entered the field of opera. Amsterdam has become a\r\ngreat musical centre, and Holland, no less than Belgium, is reaping the\r\nresult of the widespread educational movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nMaitland, J.

Among these favored peoples the Folk-song,\r\nthe music that appeals directly to the popular heart, needs only the\r\ntouch of a gifted composer to fashion it into a great national school.\r\nIn the case of England and Belgium, we have seen that even the most\r\nthorough musical education cannot wholly atone for a lack of real\r\npublic taste in music. Scotland, possessing a wealth of beautiful\r\nFolk-songs, has not yet given birth to a composer who can employ its\r\nstyle in larger forms. But in Bohemia and the countries of Northern\r\nEurope, the Folk-music has not only been worthy in itself, but has been\r\nproperly developed and amplified by gifted composers.\r\n\r\n=Smetana=.—František Škroup (1801-1862) composed many popular Bohemian\r\n_Volkslieder_, and wrote the first national opera, but the real founder\r\nof the Bohemian school was Bedřich, or Frederick, Smetana (Leito\r\nmischl, Bohemia, 1824—Prague, 1884). Parental opposition could not\r\nprevent his studying music, and we find him at Prague, under Proksh,\r\nand, later on, taking lessons of Schumann. That master recommended a\r\ncourse with Mendelssohn, but as the pupil was too poor, he changed his\r\nadvice and suggested a study of Bach. Smetana became an ardent admirer\r\nof Liszt, at whose house his own career was decided. Hearing Herbeck\r\nremark, while there, that the Czechs were merely reproductive, he made\r\na solemn resolution to devote his life to the building up of a national\r\nschool of music in Bohemia.\r\n\r\n=His Works=.—While conductor at Gothenburg, Sweden, he produced three\r\nworthy symphonic poems: “Richard III,” “Wallenstein’s Camp,” and “Hakon\r\nJarl.” On his return, he wrote “The Brandenburgers in Bohemia,” the\r\nfirst of the eight operas that have made him so famous in his native\r\nland. This was Wagnerian in style, and at once the critics assailed him\r\nfiercely for trying to bring Bohemia under the musical domination of\r\nGermany. To show that he could write in a more popular vein, Smetana\r\nproduced a second opera, “Prodaná Nevĕsta,” (The Bartered Bride), which\r\nproved a marvel of musical grace and delicacy, and was enough in itself\r\nto establish the reputation of any composer. “Dalibor” is a dramatic\r\nwork in serious vein, while “Libuše” is based on a national subject.\r\n“The Two Widows” and “The Kiss” are light operas of marked success,\r\nthe latter being often cited as a perfect model for this style. “The\r\nSecret” is in the same vein, while “The Devil’s Wall” is again on a\r\nnational legend. Other notable works are the string quartet “Aus Meinem\r\nLeben,” and the “Carnival of Prague”; but Smetana’s greatest orchestral\r\nwork is the set of six symphonic poems entitled “Ma Vlast” (My\r\nFatherland). These depict “Vyšehrad,” a historic fortress; “Vltava,”\r\nthe river Moldau; “Sarka,” a mythical Amazon; “Bohemia’s Groves and\r\nMeadows,” “Tabor,” the Hussite camp; and “Blanik,” the magic mountain\r\nwhere the warriors sleep. Smetana’s music shows an inspiration and\r\ndepth of feeling that make him rank with the world’s great composers,\r\nand his struggles against poverty and disease form a story of the\r\nutmost pathos.\r\n\r\n=Dvořák=.—The greatest of Smetana’s pupils was =Antonin Dvořák=\r\n(Mühlhausen, Bohemia, 1841—Prague, 1904). Son of a butcher, he\r\npersuaded the village schoolmaster to give him lessons. He began\r\ncomposition at Zlonitz, and soon sent home a polka to surprise his\r\nfamily; and as he had written it without considering the transposing\r\ninstruments, thus causing three different keys to sound together,\r\nthe resulting discords certainly accomplished that purpose. After\r\nfurther study at Prague, he was able to gain a Government pension,\r\nand to interest such men as Hanslick and Brahms. He spent his time in\r\n“hard study, occasional composition, much revision, a great deal of\r\nthinking, and little eating.” Being asked what teacher helped him most,\r\nhe replied: “I studied with God, the birds, the trees, the rivers,\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTONIN DVOŘÁK. CHRISTIAN SINDING.\r\n\r\nEDVARD GRIEG. FRIEDRICH SMETANA.]\r\n\r\n=His Works=.—Dvořák’s many operas, including “Wanda,” “Dimitri,”\r\n“Armida,” and others, have been surpassed in importance by his\r\norchestral works. His “Stabat Mater” and the cantata “The Spectre’s\r\nBride” are important vocal compositions. His overtures include such\r\nwell-known examples as the “Husitzká,” “Mein Heim,” “Othello,” “In der\r\nNatur,” and the “Carneval.” Other instrumental works are the famous\r\n“Slavic Dances,” the Slavonic Rhapsodies, the “Scherzo Capriccioso,”\r\nthree Ballades, and a “Hero Song.” Before coming to New York, in 1892,\r\nhe had written four great symphonies; but the fifth, “Aus der Neuen\r\nWelt,” is of the greatest interest to Americans, since Dvořák here\r\nadopted the plantation style in his themes, to show what could be done\r\nin building up an American school of music. He was eminently successful\r\nin handling his material, and he produced a greater and more truly\r\nnational work than any resident composer has yet done. In general,\r\nDvořák’s style is more cosmopolitan than that of Smetana, and his\r\nfaculty of melodic invention makes his works attractive. He enriched\r\nthe symphony by two Bohemian dance-movements—the Dumka, and the Furiant.\r\n\r\n=Other Bohemians=.—=Zdĕnek Fibich=, though little known outside of\r\nhis own country, was another famous opera-composer. He devoted some\r\nefforts to melodrama also, “Hippodamia” being his chief work in this\r\nfield. He published two symphonies and several symphonic poems, the\r\nlatter showing the influence of Liszt. =Reznícĕk=, who has recently\r\nidentified himself with the musical life of Germany, has produced five\r\noperas, of which the sparkling comedy “Bonna Diana” and the later\r\n“Till Eulenspiegel” are the best. =Josef Suk=, son-in-law of Dvořák,\r\nhas composed some attractive instrumental music, while =Nápravník=,\r\nof an earlier generation, won operatic successes in St. Petersburg.\r\nHungary, too, has a national school of opera, founded by =Franz Erkel=.\r\nThis school is carried on by such men as Alexander Erkel, the Doppler\r\nbrothers, Mihalovitch, Zichy, and Hubay, while Dohnanyi is better known\r\nas pianist than as composer. Poland is represented by =Paderewski=,\r\nwhile =Soltys= has won renown in symphony, and =Stalkowsky= in opera.\r\n\r\n=Norwegian Music=.—Norway is preëminently a land of song. Its sombre\r\nfiords, dark forests, and smiling meadows have at all times inspired a\r\nschool of Folk-music whose plaintive sweetness exerts the utmost charm\r\non the musical auditor. In =Edvard Hagerup Grieg= (Bergen, 1843-1907)\r\nwe find a composer of wonderful melodic gifts and expressive power,\r\nwho has preserved admirably the flavor of the local Folk-songs and\r\ndances. Grieg owed much to the wise training of his mother, a woman of\r\nrare gifts. At Ole Bull’s advice, he took a course at Leipzig, after\r\nwhich he studied further with Gade, at Copenhagen. There he met Rikard\r\nNoordraak, who first aroused his enthusiasm for the songs and legends\r\nof his native land.\r\n\r\n=Grieg’s Works=.—Grieg’s genius was essentially lyric and melodic, but\r\nthis in no way detracts from the greatness of his orchestral works.\r\nThe “Autumn” overture is clear and beautiful, with the simplicity of\r\nstrength, not of weakness. The “Norwegian Dances” mark the beginning\r\nof the national style that is carried out in the melodrama “Bergliot,”\r\nthe two “Peer Gynt” suites, and “Sigurd Jorsalfer.” The piano concerto,\r\nsomewhat in the style of Schumann, is one of Grieg’s best works, and\r\nshows the utmost perfection of melodic and harmonic architecture. The\r\n“Elegiac Melodies,” the “Norwegian Themes,” and the “Holberg Suite,”\r\nall for strings, are further examples of his rich fulness of romantic\r\nutterance. His choral and chamber works show the same sympathetic\r\ntreatment, while his piano works and songs include some of the most\r\nexquisite gems in the entire musical repertoire. His works show endless\r\nmelodic invention, great power of expression, and a warmth of tender\r\nsentiment that seems never to lose its charm.\r\n\r\n=Christian Sinding= (Kongsberg, Norway, 1856) studied at Leipzig also,\r\nand won a royal scholarship that took him to Munich and Berlin. He\r\nbelongs to an artistic family, for one brother, Otto, is a painter, and\r\nanother, Stefan, a sculptor. Sinding’s music is melodic in character,\r\nand distinctively Norwegian in style, but less so than that of Grieg.\r\nHis orchestral works include an excellent symphony, brought out under\r\nWeingartner and later by Thomas; an attractive concerto for piano,\r\nand two for violin; a “Rondo Infinito”; and the interesting suite,\r\n“Episodes Chevaleresques.” His chamber-music, violin sonatas, piano\r\nsolos, and songs are made of the most attractive material.\r\n\r\n=Other Norwegians=.—=Johann Severin Svendsen=, though prominent\r\nin Danish music, is really Norwegian by birth. Son of a military\r\nbandmaster, he soon obtained a position similar to his father’s. But\r\nhe longed for higher things, and after a tour as violin virtuoso,\r\nhe studied at Leipzig, under Reinecke. He traveled much, meeting in\r\nParis an American woman whom he afterwards married in her own country.\r\nAfter some experience in Christiania, he became court conductor in\r\nCopenhagen, where he owns the baton used by von Weber and inscribed\r\nwith that composer’s name. His orchestral works include two symphonies,\r\nfour Norwegian Rhapsodies, the legend “Zorahayde,” and the “Carnival\r\nat Paris,” but they are too conventional to take foremost rank. A\r\nprominent composer among the younger Norwegians is =Ole Olsen=, of\r\nHammerfest, whose symphonic poem “Asgardsreien” is but one of his\r\nmany successes. =Gerhard Schjelderup= is one of the modern radicals,\r\nand shows all the complexity and dissonance of Strauss. =Agathe\r\nBacker-Grohndahl= is the leader of the Norwegian women-composers.\r\n\r\n=Music in Denmark=.—In Denmark, the fame of Gade obscured that of other\r\ncomposers, and such a man as J. P. E. Hartmann could gain scarcely more\r\nthan local reputation. The most important name in recent years is that\r\nof =August Enna=, who won a popular operatic triumph in 1892 with “Die\r\nHexe.” He was almost wholly self-taught, for poverty prevented him from\r\ntaking lessons, sometimes even from buying music paper. “Cleopatra”\r\nis a later work, while “The Little Match-Girl” was the beginning of a\r\nseries of fairy operas. Enna handles his orchestra with boldness and\r\nskill, and displays vocal fluency and thematic excellence. =Eduard\r\nLassen= gained more renown by his melodious songs than by his operas or\r\norchestral works. =Otto Malling= is known for his piano pieces, while\r\n=Victor Bendix= has attempted the symphonic poem. =Ludwig Schytté=, a\r\nfriend of Liszt, has made Berlin his home, and is identified with light\r\nopera as well as piano music.\r\n\r\n=Music in Sweden=.—The national opera of Sweden was brought into being\r\nby =Ivar Hallstrom=, soon after the middle of the 19th century. Since\r\nthen, a new school has arisen, showing the influence of Liszt, Wagner,\r\nSchumann, and at times, Berlioz, with the plaintive sweetness of the\r\nnative Folk-music pervading it all. =Anders Hallen=, the first of the\r\nnew romanticists, has written four operas (of which “Hexfallen” is\r\nthe best), several symphonic poems and Swedish Rhapsodies, a number\r\nof ambitious cantatas, and some beautiful Swedish and German songs.\r\nHe unites the charm of his native music with strength of passion and\r\nrichness of instrumentation. =Emil Sjögren= shows a harmonic feeling\r\nworthy of Grieg, but his boldness in modulation often produces bizarre\r\neffects. He excels in the smaller forms, such as his “Spanish Songs,”\r\n“Tannhäuser Lieder,” and several piano cycles. =Wilhelm Stenhammar=,\r\npupil of these two, shows much enthusiasm and spirit in his music,\r\nbut his operas are now laid aside. =Wilhelm Peterson-Berger= is the\r\nbest of the new opera-composers, his music-drama “Ran” being a recent\r\nsuccess. =Hugo Alfven= has attempted the symphony, with fair success.\r\n=Tor Aulin=, a famous violinist, has produced concertos and other works\r\nfor his instrument, while =Erik Akerberg= has devoted his energy to\r\nchoral works. =Elfrida Andree= is the most prominent of the Swedish\r\nwomen-composers.\r\n\r\n=Music in Finland=.—The national epic of Finland is the _Kalevala_,\r\na work of real poetic beauty. There is also a collection of shorter\r\nlyrics, called the _Kanteletar_. These have furnished inspiration for a\r\nlarge number of modern composers, of whom the most important is =Jean\r\nSibelius=. He studied with Becker in Berlin and Goldmark in Vienna.\r\nOn his return to Helsingfors, the capital, he became the leader of the\r\nnew Finnish school. His two symphonies are worthy if not absolutely\r\ngreat, but his symphonic poems, and the suite “King Christian IV,” show\r\nreal musical beauty. He has been active in the smaller forms also, and\r\nholds the Government pension for musical excellence. =Armas Jarnefelt=\r\nis another good orchestral composer, while =Ernest Mielck=, who died at\r\ntwenty-two, showed a lyric beauty not unworthy of Schubert. =Richard\r\nFaltin= is one of the older song-composers. =Martin Wegelius=, died\r\n1906, did valuable work as director of the Musical Institute, while\r\n=Robert Kajanus= became prominent as the founder and leader of the\r\nHelsingfors Philharmonic Orchestra. Both are excellent composers, the\r\nformer working chiefly in vocal forms, the latter in the orchestral\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho founded the Bohemian school of composers?\r\n\r\nWho was his greatest pupil?\r\n\r\nName the most important works of these two composers.\r\n\r\nWhat contribution did Dvořák make to the symphony?\r\n\r\nWho is the leading Norwegian composer?\r\n\r\nName some of his best-known works.\r\n\r\nCompare Grieg and Sinding.\r\n\r\nWhat composers of Danish birth have won appreciation?\r\n\r\nName the leading Swedish composers.\r\n\r\nWho is the most important Finnish composer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON LVI.\r\n\r\n                          THE RUSSIAN SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Folk-Music in Russia=.—The Slav nature differs greatly from that of\r\nthe races of Western Europe, and this difference appears also in the\r\nSlavonic music. For a proper understanding of the Russian Folk-songs,\r\nthe student should be familiar with the country and its history, its\r\nvast steppes, its lonely summers and dreary winters, and the patient\r\npoverty of its long-suffering peasants. It is rich in legendary lore,\r\nand the poetry of Pushkin and Gogol has wrought the wild beauty of\r\nthese tales into permanent form. The popular melodies trace their\r\norigin back to pagan times, and show infinite variety. There are\r\nepic chants, songs of weddings and funerals, and weirdly beautiful\r\ncradle-songs, Their delicate, capricious rhythm, and their strangeness\r\nof harmony and cadence, possess the utmost attraction. At times the\r\nsongs are strong and savage, at times tranquil and majestic, or brisk\r\nand graceful; but usually they are tinged with the profound melancholy\r\nof an oppressed race. The church music, too, with its old modes and\r\ndeep-voiced choirs, flourishes in unusual purity.\r\n\r\n=The Rise of Russian Music=.—In the middle of the 18th century, the\r\nImperial Court began to import foreign composers, and St. Petersburg\r\nwas enabled to hear and see such men as Paisiello, Cimarosa, and\r\nBoieldieu. Works in the native language soon followed, and the Venetian\r\nCavos became so identified with Russian music that he might almost have\r\npassed for a native. The first Russian composer, however, was =Glinka=,\r\nwhose “Life for the Czar” (1836) was received with profound enthusiasm\r\nby the entire nation. Other composers followed, the best of whom were\r\n=Dargomishky= and =Seroff=. The former died only recently, and his\r\nlater works show the Wagnerian influence. Instrumental music flourished\r\nalso. The rich melodic beauty of Rubinstein charmed all Europe, and\r\nonly the passionate power of Tchaikovsky placed it in the background.\r\nBut now even he, the greatest of the Russians, is not considered truly\r\nnational by his countrymen, who think him too German in style.\r\n\r\n=Balakireff=.—Of the five men who strove to make Russian music\r\ndistinctively national, =Mily Alexejevitch Balakireff= (Nijni-Novgorod,\r\nRussia, 1836) was not the greatest, but may justly be called the\r\nfounder of the movement. After his university studies, he came under\r\nthe influence of Alexander Oulibicheff, a retired diplomat who devoted\r\nhimself to music. The young man soon settled in St. Petersburg, where\r\nhe met Cui, and began with him the work of developing the new school.\r\nBalakireff has been active as pianist, teacher, and concert leader. The\r\nmusical principles adopted by him and his four associates called for\r\nthe use of Russian Folk-music in just the way that Dvořák employed the\r\nplantation style in his “New World” symphony. This idea is at least as\r\nold as the days of Weber, whose “Freischütz,” written in the popular\r\nvein, made such an overwhelming triumph in Germany. With the wealth\r\nof beautiful Folk-songs in Russia, it has been possible to produce an\r\nimmense amount of interesting music, with which the Western world is as\r\nyet by no means fully acquainted. Balakireff himself was not prolific\r\nas a composer, but his works, though few in number, show real value.\r\nThey include a symphony, three overtures (Russian, Czech, and Spanish),\r\nincidental music to “King Lear,” the symphonic poem “Russia,” and a\r\nsecond one, “Tamara,” based on the legend of a beautiful Caucasian\r\nprincess who entertained the passing cavalier for a night, while in the\r\nmorning the river Tarek bore away his corpse. Another Oriental subject\r\nis the difficult piano fantasie “Islamey.” His lesser works include\r\nmazurkas, some four-hand pieces, and a score of remarkable songs,\r\nmasterly in their perfection of detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTON ARENSKY. CÉSAR CUI.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER GLAZOUNOV. MILY BALAKIREFF.\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS RIMSKY-KORSAKOFF. SERGEI RACHMANINOFF.]\r\n\r\n=César Antonovitch Cui= (Vilna, Russia, 1835) has been the literary\r\nchampion of the new school. Son of a French soldier, Cui studied\r\nengineering, and became professor of fortification. In his writings we\r\nmay see that the new Russians seem unwilling to admit the greatness of\r\nWagner, but they have none the less adopted nearly all his dramatic\r\ntheories. Like him, they revolted against the inanities of the old\r\nItalian opera, which was merely a singing-concert. They admitted that\r\nafter Beethoven and Schumann, the symphony could say little of new\r\nimport, but reform was needed in opera; the plot should be worthy, and\r\nthe music not only good in itself, but appropriate to the sentiment.\r\nYet Russian opera has not followed Wagner, but has proceeded along\r\nits own lines; and Cui even writes: “I would like to preserve my\r\ncompatriots from the dangerous influence of Wagner’s decadence. Whoever\r\nloves his music, ceases to appreciate real music; whoever admires\r\nhis operas, holds Glinka as a writer of vaudevilles. The desire to\r\nfind something deep where nothing exists can have only dangerous\r\nconsequences.” These strictures are not unlike certain early German\r\ncriticisms of Wagner, now happily forgotten. Cui’s own operas include\r\n“The Prisoner of the Caucasus,” “William Ratcliff,” “Angelo,” “Le\r\nFilibustier,” and “The Saracen,” but none has won any real success. His\r\nmusic is good, but even his own countrymen admit that it lacks novelty\r\nor individuality. “Angelo” is the composer’s favorite. He, too, has\r\ndone much in the smaller forms.\r\n\r\n=Moussorgsky=.—The strangest figure in the group of five was, by\r\nall odds, =Modest Petrovitch Moussorgsky= (Karevo, Russia, 1839—St.\r\nPetersburg, 1881). Like Cui, he received a military training, and\r\nbecame an officer, but his restiveness soon caused his resignation, and\r\ntwo later attempts at Government work were again failures. His fondness\r\nfor drink, and his many excesses, soon marked him as a Bohemian whose\r\ndominating passions and savage independence could brook no restraint.\r\nThe same qualities are shown in his music. He was a poet by nature,\r\nexpressing in great thoughts the passion and misery of humanity, but\r\nnever taking the trouble to master the technic of his art. Thus his\r\ntwo operas, “Boris Godunoff” and “Chovanstchina,” did not meet with\r\nfavor until smoothed and polished by his more learned friends. The same\r\nis true of his “Night on Calvary” and “Intermezzo” for orchestra. His\r\n“Defeat of Sennacherib” is one of many “Hebraic Choruses,” while the\r\n“Tableaux d’une Exposition” are among the best of his piano pieces.\r\nHis songs include settings of Goethe and Heine, as well as the Russian\r\npoets.\r\n\r\n=Alexander Porphyrievitch Borodin= (St. Petersburg, Russia, 1834-1887)\r\ncould claim kinship with the old princes of Imeretia, the former\r\nCaucasian kingdom whose rulers boasted of their descent from King\r\nDavid. He studied medicine and surgery, and wrote several important\r\nworks on chemistry. He was active in the cause of higher education for\r\nwomen, and founded a medical school for them. In music he owed his\r\ndevelopment chiefly to Balakireff, though he composed at an early age,\r\nalmost by instinct. The success of his first symphony encouraged him\r\nto write two others, as well as an orchestral scherzo. His two string\r\nquartets are full of originality, and his choral and piano music shows\r\nthe same quality. He is best known in America by the “Steppenskizze,” a\r\ntone-picture of the vast Russian plains traversed by Oriental caravans.\r\nHis greatest work, however, is the opera “Prince Igor,” on an old\r\nRussian war-legend treated by Pushkin. Borodin is a master of sombre\r\neffects, and his dissonances are at times almost too striking; but\r\nthere is real musical worth, also, in his compositions.\r\n\r\n=Rimsky-Korsakoff=.—The best of the renowned group of five is decidedly\r\n=Nicolai Andreievitch Rimsky-Korsakoff= (Tikhvin, Russia, 1844). He,\r\ntoo, adopted a vocation other than music, graduating from a Government\r\nschool and afterwards attaining the rank of admiral. His chief\r\nmusical work has been in opera, and his dozen productions in this\r\nform are nearly all widely popular in his native land. “The Czar’s\r\nBetrothed” is the best known, but the “May Night,” “The Snow Maiden,”\r\nand “Sadko” are not far behind it in favor. “Mozart and Salieri” is\r\na one-act version of a poem by Pushkin, based on the suspicion that\r\nMozart was really poisoned by his Italian rival. In the orchestral\r\nfield, “Antar,” “Scheherezade,” and “Sadko” are three symphonic poems\r\nthat show remarkable mastery of expression. Other orchestral works\r\nare an overture on popular melodies, another on church themes, a\r\n“Serb Fantasie,” a “Spanish Caprice,” and a “Fairy Legend.” He has\r\nwritten a noble and dignified concerto, dedicated to Liszt, and the\r\nusual number of lesser works. He shows the greatest skill in handling\r\ninstrumental color, an art for which the Russians are noted. His\r\nmusic is descriptive, dramatic. His inspiration never flags, and his\r\ntreatment of the thematic material is always interesting and skilful.\r\nHis music may perhaps be criticised as lacking unity, but its breadth\r\nand originality are undoubted.\r\n\r\n=Glazounoff=.—Among men of a later generation, =Alexander\r\nConstantinovitch Glazounoff= (St. Petersburg, Russia, 1865) is the most\r\nprominent, and the only one who may dispute with Rimsky-Korsakoff,\r\nhis former teacher, the position of greatest of the living Russian\r\ncomposers. Son of a rich bookseller, he was able to devote all his\r\nenergies to music, and produced at eighteen a symphony that won\r\nthe congratulations of Liszt. Since then he has composed works as\r\nbeautiful as they are numerous. His early creations show a tendency to\r\nfantastic and imaginative subjects. The haunting beauty of the forest,\r\nthe inspiring charm of spring, the compelling magic of the sea, the\r\ngorgeousness of the Orient, the majesty of the historic Kremlin, all\r\nfind an echo in his great orchestral rhapsodies. His seven symphonies\r\nare marvels of harmonic richness and melodic beauty. His “Triumphal\r\nMarch” for the Chicago Exposition, and a “Coronation Cantata” for the\r\nCzar, were both written to order. His early overtures are based on\r\nsacred themes, but the “Carnival” and the “Ouverture Solennelle” are\r\nagain in the style of vivid coloring to which he has accustomed his\r\nhearers. His eighty or more published compositions include ballades,\r\nmarches, suites, mazurkas, and other numbers for orchestra, to say\r\nnothing of chamber works, songs, cantatas, and two piano sonatas.\r\nFor a time, he renounced his early style, and wrote serious works in\r\nclassical German vein, but he returned to it with a number of ballets,\r\nor pantomimes with real plot and full orchestral accompaniment.\r\n\r\n=Anton Stepanovitch Arensky= (Nijni-Novgorod, Russia, 1861-1906) is\r\nanother of a younger generation, and like Glazounoff, did not limit\r\nhimself to the style of Russian Folk-music, but aims to be more\r\ncosmopolitan. Educated at St. Petersburg, Arensky soon became known by\r\na symphony and a piano concerto, and was called to Moscow as professor\r\nof counterpoint. In that city he increased his reputation by a grand\r\nopera, “A Dream on the Volga.” “Raphael,” a one-act work, was followed\r\nby the ballet, “A Night in Egypt,” but Arensky’s greatest opera is “Nal\r\nand Damajanti,” on an East Indian subject. His other works include\r\na second symphony, a fantasie with piano, a violin concerto, and a\r\n“Memorial March.” He displays real strength of feeling, and he shows\r\nthe influence of Schumann and Tchaikovsky, especially in his piano\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n=Other Composers=.—=Taneieff=, one of those who held apart from the\r\nnational movement, has written a symphony, some string quartets, and\r\nnumerous choruses, but is best known by his “Oresteia,” an orchestral\r\ntrilogy based on the tragedies of Aeschylus. This is a work of dignity\r\nand power, but at times lacking in inspiration. =Rachmaninoff=, a\r\npupil of Arensky, is one of the younger men who won fame as a pianist\r\nand piano composer before attempting larger works. His more ambitious\r\ncompositions include two concertos, a symphony, a symphonic poem,\r\nand the cantata “Spring,” also two operas “The Bohemians” and “The\r\nAvaricious Knight.” Another piano composer is =Stcherbatcheff=, a\r\npupil of Liszt, who displays excessive boldness in his effects, though\r\nhis “Fairy Scenes” are charming in style, and his “Fantasies Etudes”\r\nshow the influence of Schumann. =Liadoff= is another composer of piano\r\nworks, such as the “Arabesques” and the “Birioulki.” =Scriabine= is\r\none of the more recent piano writers who has won his spurs in the\r\nsymphonic field also. =Pachulski=, too, has become known by his piano\r\ncompositions. =Wihtol= has done much valuable work in collecting the\r\nLett Folk-melodies. =Solovieff= has attempted opera, though not with\r\nany remarkable success. =Ippolitoff-Ivanoff=, active in the musical\r\nlife of Moscow, has produced operas, suites, and the set of lyric\r\nscenes, entitled “Asia.” =Michael Ivanoff= is another opera composer,\r\nwhose “Sabawa” has met with some favor. Among many others worthy of\r\nmention, =Sokoloff= has written chamber-works, =Alpheraki= is noted for\r\nhis songs, =Antipoff= and =Blumenfeld= have produced excellent piano\r\nmusic, while =Rebikoff=, known for the same reason, has won new laurels\r\nwith his so-called mimodrame, “Genius and Death.”\r\n\r\n=Tchaikovsky=.—Although the new Russian school does not recognize Peter\r\nIljitsch Tchaikovsky as an exponent of national musical ideas and\r\nalthough he represents a blending of Teutonic and Slavonic methods,\r\nyet his music partakes of the latter, rather than of the former\r\ntemperament, and he is therefore included among the Russian composers\r\nin this lesson. He was born May 7, 1840; at ten he went to St.\r\nPetersburg. He was intended for the legal profession and was appointed\r\nto a place in the Ministry of Justice when only nineteen years old.\r\nShortly after, he entered the harmony classes at the Conservatory,\r\nresigned his Government position, and entered the musical profession.\r\nIn 1866 he became professor of harmony at the Moscow Conservatory;\r\nin 1867, brought out his first symphony and his first opera. In 1877\r\nhe resigned his post at the Conservatory and gave himself up to\r\ncomposition. In 1891 he visited the United States. He died, October 12,\r\n1893, in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nHis compositions include eight operas, six symphonies, eight overtures\r\nand fantasias for orchestra, seven works for special occasions, eight\r\norchestral suites, three string quartets, a trio and sextet, three\r\nconcertos and two other pieces for piano and orchestra, three works for\r\nviolin and orchestra, and two for ’cello and orchestra, a large number\r\nof piano pieces and vocal works.\r\n\r\nAn English critic sums up Tchaikovsky’s orchestral works thus: _Good\r\npoints_, beauty of melody, brilliancy of workmanship, beauty of color;\r\n_weak points_, undue pursuit of the morbid, extravagance of idea,\r\nnoisiness of orchestration.\r\n\r\n=Conclusion=.—At the beginning of the 20th century, the chief\r\ncharacteristic of music seems to be a development of national\r\nschools. As already explained, in those countries that have worthy\r\nFolk-music, composers find the material ready for them to fashion.\r\nSuch has been the case in Norway, Sweden, and Bohemia, as well as in\r\nRussia. Countries that have not this advantage, such as England, the\r\nNetherlands, or America, atone for it in part by study and education;\r\nbut this seldom produces great musical geniuses. Italy, where the\r\ncommon people cared for nothing but the lighter style of tune, has\r\nhad to build anew, upon foreign foundations. France is making a brave\r\nstruggle after novelty, but seems to lack the needed inspiration;\r\nwhile Germany, for the moment, seems content with mastering the modern\r\norchestra. The Russian school is today the most spontaneous, the least\r\nartificial; and it cannot fail to grow in appreciation during the next\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nHabets.—Borodin and Liszt.\r\n\r\nNewmarch.—Life of Tchaikovsky.\r\n\r\nLee.—Tchaikovski, Music of the Masters Series.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhat is the character of the Slavonic Folk-music?\r\n\r\nWho was the first Russian composer of prominence?\r\n\r\nGive a sketch of the work of the composers, Balakireff, Moussorgsky,\r\nCui, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakoff and Glazounoff.\r\n\r\nWhat composition and by whom is it considered one of the most difficult\r\npieces written for the piano?\r\n\r\nWhat composer’s influence is shown in the works of Arensky?\r\n\r\nName other prominent Russian composers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n              THEODORE THOMAS.\r\n\r\n     LOWELL MASON.       STEPHEN C. FOSTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON LVII.\r\n\r\n                      MUSIC IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cavaliers and the Puritans=.—The English settlers who came to this\r\ncountry and located at Jamestown, and their successors, brought with\r\nthem from their home the songs they sang there—gay songs, cavalier\r\nsongs, love-ditties and the countryside tunes; but they left them\r\nat this, making no attempt to adapt them to their new surroundings.\r\nIndeed, it was as much a matter of fashion to be able to play or\r\nto sing some new ballad just brought from London as it was to have\r\nthe latest fashion in dress. The Cavaliers were not the people to\r\ngive a distinctive tone to music in their adopted home. The stern,\r\nsevere, religious atmosphere of the New England Colonies did more for\r\nthe beginnings of American music, although the first efforts were\r\nunpromising enough, since the Puritans discountenanced all music except\r\nthat of Psalm tunes, which were probably sung in unison, since at that\r\ntime there could be little question of singing in parts. Owing probably\r\nto a scarcity of hymn-books, it was customary to read the hymn line by\r\nline, and to sing in alternation with the reading, a custom observed in\r\nsome sections of the United States even in the latter part of the 19th\r\ncentury. It was inevitable that the more progressive among the clergy\r\nand the people should demand better singing of the Psalms; and from\r\nthis came the first singing schools, the beginning of musical education\r\nin the Colonies. A singing school is noted in Boston in 1717. As this\r\nmovement spread, choirs were organized, since those who had gained\r\nsome skill in singing and in reading from notes would naturally draw\r\ntogether, at first informally, later in regular organizations. This\r\noccurred as early as the middle of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n=Hymn-Tune Composers=.—The prominence given to the singing of Psalms\r\nand hymns is doubtless due to the fact that the first composers\r\ndeveloped in the Colonies confined their efforts to the production of\r\nhymn-tunes. The first to gain prominence was William Billings, born in\r\nBoston in 1746, died there, 1800. He was a tanner by trade and was,\r\nof course, self-taught. His efforts at harmonizing were rather crude,\r\nas is to be expected, since he had but few models in composition.\r\nHe introduced a somewhat florid style, although without training in\r\ncounterpoint. Yet the critic can see in the work of the early composers\r\nsuch as Billings, a rough vigor and a striving for a more distinctive\r\nmelodic and rhythmic character than is to be found in the tunes brought\r\nover from England, showing traces of the forces already at work to\r\ndifferentiate the American character from the English. Billings’ first\r\ncollection of tunes was published in 1770. Other composers of this\r\nperiod were Oliver Holden, who wrote the widely-sung “Coronation,”\r\nAndrew Law, Jacob Kimball, Daniel Read and Timothy Swan. The two other\r\nimportant cities, Philadelphia and New York, had some musical activity\r\nduring the Colonial period. In 1741, Benjamin Franklin published a\r\ncollection of hymns, performances were given of operas, and concerts\r\nfor charitable purposes were organized, yet nothing in the way of\r\nnative composition developed.\r\n\r\n=Early Musical Organizations=.—A musical atmosphere is essential to\r\nmusical development and progress, and a musical atmosphere comes only\r\nfrom organized effort in musical work. The first efforts in this\r\ndirection were vocal, following the same line of development as that\r\nwe observed in the history of music as a whole, namely: first, vocal\r\nand choral music; secondly, instrumental and particularly orchestral.\r\nThe earliest important society of this kind was the Stoughton (Mass.)\r\nMusical Society, which grew out of a singing class formed in that town,\r\nby Billings, in 1774. This organization still exists. The most famous\r\nand most significant body for musical development was the Handel and\r\nHaydn Society, still in existence, which was organized in Boston, in\r\n1815, with a chorus of nearly one hundred voices. Boston had at this\r\ntime some well-trained musicians, and others came there from Europe in\r\nlater years, making it the centre of American musical life for years.\r\n\r\n=Lowell Mason=.—In 1826, a young man from the South, but born in\r\nMassachusetts, came to Boston to begin a musical career, which formed\r\na link between the early singing school stage and the work of the\r\npresent day. This was Lowell Mason, who was born in 1792, but spent his\r\nyounger days in Savannah, Ga., where he studied music as an amateur.\r\nAs the fruit of his efforts in composition, he published a collection\r\nof church music which was endorsed by the Handel and Haydn Society,\r\nand proved very successful, encouraging him, some years later, to take\r\nup music as a profession. He was essentially a man of the people among\r\nwhom he lived and by nature an efficient teacher, to which he added\r\na skill and training that ensured him the respect of those who came\r\nunder his instruction. He traveled over New England and parts of New\r\nYork State, holding musical conventions, and teaching the principles of\r\nmusic to hundreds of singers and teachers from far and near. His work\r\nthus closely touched the people, and in a day when music was not taught\r\nin the public schools, contributed greatly to spread a love for and a\r\nknowledge of vocal music. He died August 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n=Musical Instruments=.—When instrumental music began to receive a share\r\nof public attention, a great step was taken toward development of music\r\nin the United States. In cities like Boston, New York, Philadelphia and\r\nsome Southern homes, instruments of the spinet and virginal type could\r\nbe found in the 17th and 18th centuries. The flute was a gentleman’s\r\ninstrument in those days, following the English custom. The violin\r\nalso received some attention. (Thomas Jefferson was very fond of\r\nthis instrument.) Naturally, the first instruments were brought from\r\nEngland, yet the record shows that John Harris, of Boston, who had\r\nlearned the trade in England, offered for sale spinets of his own\r\nmake, in 1769. Some church organs were built several years earlier. The\r\nharpsichord and piano followed in due course of time, as we can gather\r\nfrom advertisements and concert programs. There is controversy as to\r\nthe making of the first pianos in the United States. Both Philadelphia\r\nand Boston seem to have had makers in a small way before the beginning\r\nof the 19th century. The pioneer in this industry was Jonas Chickering,\r\nwho served his apprenticeship in Boston and started in business on his\r\nown account, in 1823. The growth of interest in music arising from\r\nthe organization of choral societies and the labors of Lowell Mason,\r\nand the musicians of foreign birth who came to this country created a\r\ndemand for music outside of that for the voice, organ and piano, for\r\nmany of these musicians had been players in orchestras in Europe.\r\n\r\n=Early Orchestras=.—The first permanent body of orchestral players,\r\nthe Philharmonic Society, was formed in Boston. The chief promoter\r\nwas a German, named Graupner, who came to the city named, in 1798. He\r\ngathered round him a few professionals and some amateurs, so that the\r\nnucleus of an orchestra existed before the Handel and Haydn Society was\r\nformed. Graupner also kept a music store and printed music. A large\r\norchestra was established in 1840, which remained active for nearly\r\na decade. New York had an organization of instrumentalists which was\r\nstarted about the same time as Graupner’s society in Boston, but its\r\nreal work in this line did not occur until 1842, when the Philharmonic\r\nSociety was founded, with a strength of from fifty to sixty players.\r\nThis society still exists. The strongest musical force in Philadelphia\r\nwas the Musical Fund Society, which came into existence in 1820, one\r\nobject of which was to spread musical knowledge in the city. It built\r\na hall, which still stands, and gave both vocal and instrumental\r\nconcerts. Beethoven’s first symphony was given there, as early as 1821.\r\n\r\n=Permanent Orchestral Organizations=.—The credit for raising the\r\nstandard of orchestral work and of spreading a popular appreciation\r\nof the classics in absolute music belongs to Theodore Thomas, born\r\nin Germany, in 1835, whose family came to this country in 1845. He\r\nbecame a proficient violinist while still a boy. His first efforts in\r\nthe line of the higher music were in the domain of chamber-music; in\r\nthese concerts he was associated with Dr. William Mason and others. In\r\n1864, he began his work in the orchestral field, in New York, visiting\r\nother cities with his men and spreading a knowledge of the works of the\r\nmasters. Mr. Thomas conducted a series of concerts in Philadelphia,\r\nbut finished his labors in Chicago, as the conductor of the Chicago\r\nOrchestra, which was established for him. He died in 1905. Following\r\nthe increased interest in orchestral music in New York City, due to\r\nthe work of Thomas, the Boston musical public called for a higher\r\nstandard and a more skilled set of players than the successors of\r\nthe old Philharmonic Orchestra, the Germania and the Harvard Musical\r\nAssociation, which had kept up the work in a creditable manner. The\r\noutgrowth of this sentiment was the establishment of the celebrated\r\nBoston Symphony Orchestra, which gave its first concerts in the fall of\r\n1881, under the direction of Mr. Georg Henschel. The financial needs\r\nof the organization were guaranteed by Mr. Henry L. Higginson. Mr.\r\nHenschel was succeeded, in 1884, by Wilhelm Gericke, who was followed\r\nfive years later by Arthur Nikisch; in 1893, Mr. Emil Paur was made\r\ndirector, to be succeeded in 1898 by Wilhelm Gericke, who is still\r\n(1905) at the head of the organization. The work of the orchestras\r\nmentioned stimulated music lovers in other cities and at the present\r\ntime, worthy rivals of the older bodies exist in Philadelphia, Mr.\r\nFritz Scheel, director, the New York Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Walter\r\nDamrosch, director, and the Pittsburgh Orchestra, under the direction\r\nof Mr. Emil Paur. Baltimore has a good orchestra in connection with\r\nthe Peabody Conservatory, Cincinnati has a permanent body with a\r\nguarantee fund, under the conductorship of Mr. Frank Van der Stucken.\r\nThe orchestras mentioned give concerts in other cities, so that their\r\nwork has more than a local significance. Other cities in which efforts\r\nare being made to develop orchestral music are New Haven, Buffalo,\r\nWashington, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, San Francisco,\r\nLos Angeles and Denver.\r\n\r\n=Other Organized Bodies=.—Other means for promoting musical progress\r\nin the United States were the societies in different parts of the\r\ncountry, which provided concerts, aided musical education, kept up\r\npublic interest, the great German singing societies, music festival\r\nassociations, lecture courses, etc. A prominent example of this kind\r\nwas the Musical Fund Society of Philadelphia which, among its other\r\nactivities, opened a music school that remained in existence for six\r\nyears. The Harvard Musical Association, an organization of alumni who\r\nlabored particularly for the advancement of music, formed the nucleus\r\nof a musical library and conducted orchestral concerts at its own\r\nexpense or guarantee. In later years Pittsburgh had an active society\r\nto promote musical appreciation and the example is being followed by\r\nother cities. The greatest growth in this line, that of the formation\r\nof music festival associations and the development of the idea, was\r\ndoubtless stimulated by the great festivals held in Boston in 1869\r\nand 1872. Of these, the most important is the one held in Cincinnati,\r\nfor a number of years under the direction of Theodore Thomas; after\r\nhis death, under Mr. Van der Stucken. It is impossible to give here a\r\nlist of such organizations; they are growing in numbers over all the\r\ncountry and form a hopeful sign of an increasing and healthy interest\r\nin music. In addition to the work of these societies must be mentioned\r\nthe series of chamber-music concerts given by quartet organizations in\r\nall the important cities, a kind of music which demands a higher class\r\nof musical culture than any other and which is, therefore, a good index\r\nof the musical appreciation of a community. The great public libraries\r\nhave collections of musical literature, as well as the printed works of\r\nthe great masters. Notable among these is the Brown Collection, in the\r\nBoston Public Library; the Newberry Library of Chicago has a very fine\r\ncollection of musical literature, including many rare works, and the\r\nnew public library in New York City will also have works of great value\r\nto musicians. The Crosby-Brown Collection of musical instruments in the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, is one of the most valuable\r\nin the world; another collection of note is that which belongs to the\r\nUniversity of Michigan.\r\n\r\n=Folk-Music=.—In a study of conditions connected with the development\r\nof music in the United States, we will not find the wealth of material\r\nin the direction of Folk-music that European countries possess. The\r\nAmerican people being a composite one cannot have a true Folk-music\r\nas yet. There are but two types of music that can be classed in this\r\ncategory, the music of the Indians and that of the negro in his\r\nplantation life. The characteristics of both have been used by American\r\ncomposers in large works (Edward Mac Dowell: “Indian Suite,” for the\r\norchestra; Frederic Burton, in a choral work), yet the Indian race\r\nforms no part of the dominant Caucasian people of the United States\r\nand can hardly have any claims to being considered American Folk-song.\r\nAmong the negroes of the South, during the time of slavery, a type of\r\nsong developed that possesses distinctive qualities, and is thoroughly\r\npervaded with the emotional quality which characterizes the Folk-song\r\nof the musical races of Europe. It is not the song of the African in\r\nhis native land, but the product of his new environment. Particularly\r\nis this the case with regard to the songs in which the religious\r\nelement is the leading one. Many of them have the spontaneous character\r\nof the old minstrel poets, the leader improvising the verses, the\r\nchorus joining in the refrain. Several composers have used material\r\nbased on negro musical idioms, notably Antonin Dvořák, in his “From\r\nthe New World” symphony and G. W. Chadwick, in the scherzo of one\r\nof his symphonies, but the most famous examples of the Folk-song\r\nof the plantation type are found in the works of Stephen C. Foster\r\n(1826-1864), the one most widely-known being “The Old Folks at Home”\r\nor “Suwanee River,” incomparable in its sweet melancholy and tender\r\npathos, yet of extreme simplicity in harmonic basis and diatonic\r\nprogressions.\r\n\r\n=The Opera=.—The development of the opera in the United States is a\r\nstory of change from the simple style of the English ballad opera to\r\nthe elaborate music dramas of Richard Wagner, in the North, with New\r\nYork City as the leading centre, while New Orleans, in the South,\r\nwith its large French population, furnishes a home for the French and\r\nItalian school of opera. The “Beggar’s Opera,” by Gay, which had won\r\nextraordinary popularity in England, was given in New York, in 1750,\r\nand as early as 1791 New Orleans had a company of French singers.\r\nPhiladelphia also had performances before the end of the 18th century.\r\nIt was not until after the wars with England, when the country was\r\ngrowing and becoming prosperous, that foreign managers and singers\r\nconsidered it an inviting field. The first company of real artistic\r\nworth was brought here in 1825, headed by Manuel Garcia, which included\r\nhis daughter, afterward Mme. Malibran. In 1832, the poet Da Ponte,\r\nlibrettist of Mozart’s opera “Don Giovanni,” who was a resident of New\r\nYork City, brought another strong company of singers to the United\r\nStates. From that time on, for a number of years, opera was furnished\r\nby visiting companies of foreign singers, who gave performances in\r\nthe leading cities of the country, New Orleans being the first to\r\nestablish a permanent opera season with a resident company. It was in\r\n1859 that Adelina Patti made her first appearance, in New York City. In\r\n1878, Mapleson, the impresario, commenced the “all star” system that\r\ndeveloped a taste for opera by giving the American public the chance to\r\nhear the best singers in the world, and set a standard which has made\r\nthe people dissatisfied with a company well-balanced but lacking in\r\ngreat singers. More real work is done to develop a community by hearing\r\na number of performances well done than one or two in a sensational\r\nstyle. In 1883, the Metropolitan Opera House, in New York City, was\r\nopened with a “star” company, managed by Henry E. Abbey. German opera\r\n(Wagner music dramas) gained a foothold in this country through the\r\nefforts of Dr. Leopold Damrosch, who directed the first artistic\r\nperformance of Wagner’s Tannhäuser, in 1884, in the Metropolitan Opera\r\nHouse; from this time, operas of the three great schools were given\r\nhere, Italian, French and German. The following year, Anton Seidl was\r\ncalled to the conductorship and his labors put the performances of\r\nWagner’s operas on a plane equal to any in the world; the company had\r\nseasons in the other leading American cities. After Seidl’s death, in\r\n1898, the performances continued along the same lines and with the\r\nsame high artistic quality, the greatest singers being engaged. In\r\n1903, on Christmas Eve, under the direction of Mr. H. Conried, the\r\nfirst American representation (and the first outside of Bayreuth) of\r\n“Parsifal” was given. In assigning credit for work of an educational\r\ncharacter in opera, mention must be made of certain traveling\r\ncompanies, such as the “Ideals” and “Bostonians” who gave highly\r\nartistic performances of the standard operas, and of the companies\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Henry W. Savage, who gave grand opera in\r\nEnglish during the first decade of the present century.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\nMathews.—Hundred Years of Music in America.\r\n\r\nElson.—American Music.\r\n\r\nElson.—Our National Music and its Sources.\r\n\r\nRitter.—Music in America.\r\n\r\nBrooks.—Olden Time Music.\r\n\r\nPerkins and Dwight.—Handel and Haydn Society of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nWho contributed the greater influence to American music, the Cavaliers\r\nor the Puritans?\r\n\r\nWhat was the influence of the latter?\r\n\r\nWho were the early hymn-tune composers?

Old hymn-tune collections should\r\nbe examined to find examples of the tunes used by our forefathers.\r\nMusic representative of the various periods will be found in the books\r\nmentioned or indicated in other sources; both vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic should be performed at the recitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LESSON LVIII.\r\n\r\n         AMERICAN COMPOSERS: WORKS IN LARGE INSTRUMENTAL FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Music Still Young=.—Musical composition in the United States\r\nis still too young in comparison with the work of European composers\r\nto have made marked impress on history. American composers owe their\r\ntraining largely to European teachers, the models upon which they\r\nhave based their work come from European art, and the principles\r\nof construction were developed by the European masters. Hence the\r\ndisposition to view American composition as still in a state of\r\npupilage. Yet the record shows a number of men who have done worthy\r\nwork, many of them winning far more than a local reputation, and not\r\na few enjoying international fame. And this work, especially such as\r\nis cast in the large forms, for orchestra, chamber-music or chorus\r\nwith orchestra, is the product of the years since the close of the\r\nCivil War, a very short period, indeed, when compared with the story\r\nof composition in most of the European countries. It speaks volumes\r\nfor the native capacity and sturdy industry of American composers that\r\nthey have, in less than a half-century, won a high place in the use\r\nof the materials of musical composition and that they have so readily\r\nassimilated the work and teachings of European masters.\r\n\r\n=Paine=.—The earliest composer in large instrumental forms was John\r\nK. Paine, born, Portland, Me., 1834, died 1906. In 1858, he went to\r\nGermany to study and gave particular attention to the organ. He quickly\r\ngained rank as the chief American organist, on his return to the\r\nUnited States, several years later. In 1862, he became connected with\r\nHarvard University as an instructor in music, a full professorship\r\nbeing created in 1875. His first important works were choral, with\r\norchestral accompaniment. His first symphony was brought out in 1876,\r\nhis second, called “Spring,” in 1880. Other large works for orchestra\r\nare a symphonic fantasy based on Shakespeare’s “Tempest,” a symphonic\r\npoem “An Island Fantasy,” the inspiration of which came from several\r\npaintings of marine scenes, and an overture to Shakespeare’s “As\r\nYou Like It.” Prof. Paine’s large choral works are: a Mass in D, an\r\noratorio “St. Peter,” music to “Œdipus Tyrannus,” “Phœbus, Arise,”\r\n“Nativity,” drawn from Milton, “Song of Promise,” hymns for the\r\nCentennial and Columbus Exhibitions, music to Aristophanes’ “Birds,”\r\nan opera “Azara,” besides organ compositions, chamber-music, songs and\r\npart-songs.\r\n\r\n=Gilchrist=.—A composer whose training was entirely American is William\r\nW. Gilchrist, born in Jersey City, in 1846, a resident of Philadelphia\r\nfor many years, where his professional activity has included important\r\nwork as teacher of singing, and chorus conducting. His musical\r\neducation was received mainly from Dr. H. A. Clarke, of the University\r\nof Pennsylvania. His compositions include a symphony, a suite for\r\norchestra and a great deal of chamber-music. He has written a number\r\nof works for chorus with orchestra, his most notable being a setting\r\nof the Forty-sixth Psalm, to which was awarded a $1000 prize, offered\r\nby the Cincinnati Festival Association. His other compositions include\r\nchoral works in smaller forms, with string or other accompaniment\r\nsuited to chamber-music, part-songs, church music, and a number of fine\r\nsongs. He is especially happy in writing for women’s voices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nW. W. GILCRIST. J. K. PAINE. HORATIO PARKER.\r\n\r\nARTHUR FOOTE. EDWARD MACDOWELL. MRS. H. H. A. BEACH.\r\n\r\nG. W. CHADWICK.]\r\n\r\n=Chadwick=.—A composer who has won appreciation in Europe is George\r\nW. Chadwick, born in Lowell, Mass., in 1854. His studies were carried\r\non in the New England Conservatory, at Boston, which institution he\r\nentered in 1872. Five years later he went to Leipzig to study, giving\r\nspecial attention to composition. In 1879, he went to Dresden to study\r\nwith Rheinberger. In 1880, he returned to the United States and settled\r\nin Boston. His professional activities included work as organist,\r\nconductor, and teacher at the New England Conservatory. In 1897, he was\r\ncalled to the directorship of the Conservatory. His compositions are\r\nwritten in all the various forms, his reputation as a composer of high\r\nrank being based upon his large orchestral works, which include three\r\nsymphonies, four overtures, chamber-music, a comic opera, a sacred\r\nopera, “Judith,” two cantatas, popular with choral societies, “Phœnix\r\nExpirans” and the “Lily Nymph,” a ballad for chorus and orchestra,\r\n“Lovely Rosabelle,” part-songs, church music, and a number of songs of\r\nhigh merit.\r\n\r\n=MacDowell=.—An American composer in thorough accord with the modern\r\nmusical tendencies in composition is Edward Alexander MacDowell, born\r\nin New York, in 1861. His most famous teacher was Mme. Teresa Carreño,\r\nthe celebrated pianist. He became a pupil of the Paris _Conservatoire_,\r\nin 1876, and after three years under French masters and influences,\r\nwent to Germany, where he studied under Ehlert, Heymann and Raff, the\r\nlatter giving him a thorough grounding in the technic of composition.\r\nHis musical education, therefore, included both French and German\r\nideas. He remained in Germany as pianist, composer and teacher until\r\n1888, when he returned to the United States and settled in Boston.\r\nIn 1896, he accepted the position of professor of music in Columbia\r\nUniversity, New York City, which he held until 1904, when he resigned\r\nto devote himself to composition exclusively. MacDowell was trained to\r\na thorough understanding of form, yet his works show that he regards\r\nonly the spirit of form, that he is its master and not its servant. He\r\nhas plenty of force, vigor and originality of melody and rhythm and is\r\nresourceful in his command of modern harmony. Critics of high authority\r\nhave unhesitatingly awarded him the highest rank among American-born\r\ncomposers. His compositions include works in the large forms, two\r\nconcertos, two suites, four poems for orchestra, four piano sonatas of\r\nstriking romantic content, a number of smaller works for the piano,\r\nstudies, songs and part-songs, principally for male voices.\r\n\r\n=Horatio Parker=.—It is significant of the advance in music over\r\nother sections of the United States that New England should have been\r\nthe birthplace of a number of composers of reputation. Besides Paine\r\nand Chadwick, two others have achieved eminence in the large forms:\r\nHoratio Parker and Arthur Foote. Mr. Parker was born near Boston,\r\nin 1863; his father was an architect, his mother a woman of fine\r\nliterary and musical culture. His first lessons in music, piano and\r\norgan, were received from his mother, and such was his interest that\r\nhe made attempts at composition. At sixteen, he was appointed to a\r\nposition as organist and was thus launched into musical life. He kept\r\nup his studies with Boston teachers, in composition with Chadwick, and\r\nafterwards with Rheinberger, in Germany, in which country he remained\r\nuntil 1885. His first appointment was director of music at Garden City\r\nCathedral Schools, Long Island, afterwards filling organ positions in\r\nNew York City, the most notable one being at the Church of the Holy\r\nTrinity. He also taught in the National Conservatory. In 1893, he went\r\nto Boston as organist and director of music at Trinity Church, and\r\nin 1894, to Yale University, as professor of music. In addition to\r\nthe work in composition and history of music, Mr. Parker conducts a\r\nseries of orchestral concerts given by an orchestra supported by the\r\nUniversity. Mr. Parker’s compositions in large form include a symphony,\r\nseveral overtures, a concerto for organ and orchestra, chamber-music,\r\ncantatas for chorus and orchestra, and in smaller forms, piano and\r\norgan pieces, songs and many part-songs. His cantata “Hora Novissima”\r\nis one of the best works in this style produced by an American\r\ncomposer, and has been given in England with success. The legend of\r\n“St. Christopher” furnished material for a work of a secular character\r\nthat has been taken up by some important choral organizations.\r\n\r\n=Arthur Foote= was born at Salem, Mass., in 1854. His musical education\r\nwas wholly acquired in Boston, his leading teachers having been\r\nStephen A. Emery and B. J. Lang. Mr. Foote is also a graduate of\r\nHarvard University. His home is in Boston, where his professional\r\nwork is that of an organist, and teacher of piano and composition.\r\nHis most important work in large form is a suite for orchestra, Op.\r\n36; in addition to this he has written successfully in the domain of\r\nchamber-music, works for string orchestra, a quartet, a quintet, a trio\r\nand a sonata for piano and violin; he has also written excellent works\r\nfor chorus with orchestra, “Wreck of the Hesperus,” piano and organ\r\npieces, a number of fine songs and part-songs. He is perhaps at his\r\nbest in writing for male voices, notable works being “The Skeleton in\r\nArmor” and “Farewell to Hiawatha.”\r\n\r\n=Hadley=.—A younger composer than those mentioned, whose work in the\r\nlarge forms has received commendation, is Henry K. Hadley, born at\r\nSomerville, Mass., in 1871. His father was a member of the musical\r\nprofession, and first taught his son, who later went to Boston to study\r\nwith Emery, Chadwick and Allen (violin). In 1894, he went to Vienna\r\nto study and wrote several works for orchestra while there. In 1896,\r\nhe returned to the United States and taught in St. Paul’s School, at\r\nGarden City. He has written several symphonies, suites, an overture,\r\na cantata and a number of songs; two comic operas are also among his\r\nworks. He has won the Paderewski Prize for composition.\r\n\r\n=Frank van der Stucken=, born in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1858, of\r\nBelgian descent, was educated abroad, mainly under Benoit, at Antwerp,\r\nand entered professional life in Europe, yet he is classed with\r\nAmerican composers, for he has spent a great part of his active musical\r\nlife in this country. It was in 1884, that he came to New York City as\r\nconductor of a large German singing society, at the same time giving\r\nmuch attention to conducting orchestral works, in which branch he had\r\nhad considerable experience in Europe. In 1895, he went to Cincinnati\r\nas conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of that city and two years\r\nlater, was dean of the College of Music, from the active management\r\nof which he retired in 1903. Although he has written a number of\r\norchestral pieces, his most important work, modern in form and scored\r\nfor the full modern orchestra is “William Ratcliffe,” a symphonic\r\nprologue, which has a very dramatic program. He has also written songs\r\nthat are in the extreme style of the most advanced composition.\r\n\r\n=Mrs. Beach=.—Few women have won any success in composition in the\r\nlarge musical forms. A most notable exception is Mrs. H. H. A. Beach\r\n(Amy Marcy Cheney), who was born at Henniker, N. H., in 1867. She\r\nshowed marked inclination for music while still a child and was given\r\nregular instruction when only six years old. Soon after this her\r\nparents moved to Boston and she continued her musical education there\r\nunder Ernst Perabo and Carl Baermann. Her studies in composition were\r\nlargely made without teachers, guided principally by the most thorough\r\nand extensive study of the scores of the masters. She was married in\r\n1885 to a prominent Boston physician. Mrs. Beach’s most important works\r\nare her “Gaelic” symphony, a mass for chorus with organ and small\r\norchestra, a sonata for violin and piano and a piano concerto. In\r\naddition to this she has written a number of piano pieces and songs.\r\n\r\n=Loeffler=.—An account of music in the United States would not be\r\ncomplete without reference to the work of Mr. Charles M. Loeffler, one\r\nof the most important figures in modern musical composition. Although\r\nhe was born in Europe (1861) and educated there, he has spent his\r\nadult life in this country, having been for many years a violinist in\r\nthe Boston Symphony Orchestra. His best-known work is the “Death of\r\nTintagiles,” founded upon Maeterlinck. Rollinat and Verlaine have also\r\nfurnished inspiration to him. A concerted work for violin and orchestra\r\nshows his skill both as composer and violinist. Of late years, Mr.\r\nLoeffler has turned his attention to song composition.\r\n\r\n=Other Composers=.—In a concise account of the work of American\r\ncomposers, short mention only can be given to a number of men who have\r\nworked earnestly in composition, a field in which appreciation seems to\r\nbe granted freely to the foreigner but grudgingly to the compatriot.\r\nConditions are not favorable to development along the lines of public\r\nperformance of works in large forms, orchestras are under the control\r\nof foreign conductors, most of the players are foreigners, and the\r\nconcert-going public gives but scant attention to works by an American.\r\nTherefore much credit is due to those who have worked quietly and\r\nwith but little hope of hearing their works, doing their best to\r\nproduce music in accord with the best canons of the art. Such men are\r\n=Frederick Grant Gleason=, born at Middletown, Conn., 1848 (died in\r\nChicago, 1903), studied at home and abroad; =Adolph M. Foerster=, born\r\nin Pittsburgh, Pa., 1854, who was educated in Germany, and is now a\r\nresident of his native city; =Ernest R. Kroeger=, born at St. Louis,\r\n1862, educated at home, and still a resident of the city of his birth;\r\n=Henry Schoenefeld=, born at Milwaukee, 1857, educated at home and\r\nabroad; =Henry Holden Huss=, born in Newark, N. J., in 1862, studied in\r\nNew York and at Munich, under Rheinberger, now a resident of New York\r\nCity; =Arthur B. Whiting=, born in Cambridge, Mass., 1861, educated\r\nin Boston and by Rheinberger, at Munich, a resident of Boston; =Louis\r\nA. Coerne=, professor of music at Smith College, who was educated in\r\nBoston and Munich (Rheinberger); and =Harry Rowe Shelley=, of New York\r\nCity, who was born at New Haven, Conn., 1858, studied there and in New\r\nYork (Buck and Dvořák). These composers have by no means confined their\r\nwork to compositions for orchestra, chamber-music, cantatas, etc., but\r\nhave also written useful piano and organ pieces, and in a number of\r\ncases, songs that have become extremely popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LESSON LIX.\r\n\r\n               AMERICAN COMPOSERS: VOCAL FORMS; PIANO AND\r\n                       ORGAN.—MUSICAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cantata Composers=.—A number of American composers have turned their\r\nattention to composition in opera and cantata forms. Some of the\r\ncomposers already mentioned have written works of this character. The\r\nfirst of American composers to work in the field of the cantata was\r\n=J. C. D. Parker=, born in Boston, in 1828, a graduate of Harvard, and\r\na teacher with many years of splendid work to his credit. His musical\r\neducation was received at Leipzig. In 1854, he located in Boston and\r\ntook up a varied career as organist, conductor, and teacher of piano\r\nand harmony, at the New England Conservatory. His large works include\r\na cantata, “Redemption Hymn,” a secular cantata, “The Blind King,”\r\nand two works in oratorio form “St. John” and “The Life of Man,” the\r\nlatter showing him at his strongest. =Dudley Buck=, organist, composer\r\nand teacher, is also one of the veterans of American music. He was\r\nborn at Hartford, Conn., in 1839, attended Trinity College several\r\nyears, began his musical instruction at sixteen years of age, went\r\nto Germany several years later, giving his attention principally to\r\nthe organ and composition. In 1862, he returned to the United States,\r\nworked professionally in Hartford, Chicago, and Boston; in 1874, he\r\nwent to New York, later to one of the leading churches of Brooklyn,\r\nwhich position he retained until 1905. His choral works in large form\r\nare “Don Munio,” “The Voyage of Columbus,” “The Golden Legend,” and the\r\n“Light of Asia,” his largest and most important work, which has been\r\ngiven in England. He has written many works for church use, much organ\r\nmusic, songs and concerted vocal music, especially for male voices.\r\n\r\n=Opera=.—In opera we note the work of =Paine= (“Azara”); =Chadwick=\r\n(“Judith,” a sacred opera); =Walter Damrosch=, composer and conductor,\r\nborn in Germany, in 1862, but a resident of the United States in\r\nchildhood, and hence identified with music in this country, who\r\nhas written a work of serious character to a libretto founded on\r\nHawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter”; =Reginald de Koven=, born at Middletown,\r\nConn., in 1859, with a list of several successful light operas to his\r\ncredit, as well as many songs which have had wide appreciation; =Edgar\r\nStillman Kelley=, born at Sparta, Wisconsin, in 1857, educated in\r\nChicago and Germany, a resident of San Francisco for a number of years,\r\nwhere he brought out several notable works of a popular character for\r\nthe stage as well as the orchestra, employing in the latter Chinese\r\nmusical idioms with success in a humorous direction. A composer whose\r\nwork in light opera has had much success is =Victor Herbert=, born in\r\nDublin, Ireland. His professional career has been largely spent in this\r\ncountry, his work as conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra\r\nbeing notable.\r\n\r\n=Song Composition=.—In the field of song composition, American\r\ncomposers have done very good work. The American seems to turn\r\nnaturally to song and few of the most prominent of the native composers\r\nhave neglected this field, as will have been noticed in previous\r\nparagraphs. Among those who have won high reputation in this line we\r\nnote =George L. Osgood=, of Boston, born in 1844, composer, singer and\r\nteacher; =Frank Lynes=, of Boston, born in 1858, who has also written\r\ngood concerted vocal music and piano pieces; =Clayton Johns=, born in\r\nDelaware, in 1857, but a resident of Boston during the greater part of\r\nhis professional career, with a long list of part-songs and some piano\r\npieces to his credit; and =Ethelbert Nevin=, born near Pittsburgh, in\r\n1862, educated in the United States and in Europe, whose songs have a\r\ntruly poetic character joined to music of a high order; a number of his\r\npiano pieces have also been most favorably received. He died in 1901.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWM. MASON. L. M. GOTTSCHALK. DUDLEY BUCK.\r\n\r\nH. M. DUNHAM. J. C. D. PARKER. B. J. LANG.\r\n\r\nWALLACE GOODRICH.]\r\n\r\n=Piano Composition=.—The dean of American teachers of the piano and\r\nof composers for that instrument is =William Mason=, born in Boston,\r\nin 1829, a son of Lowell Mason, who studied at home and abroad and\r\nspent two years with Liszt at Weimar. It was in 1854 that he came\r\nback to the United States and located in New York City. In addition\r\nto his works for the piano, some of which have been widely played,\r\nhe is the author of an important technical work, which stamps him as\r\nan educator of originality and strength. A composer who is generally\r\nclassed as American, although his ancestry, education and environment\r\nincline strongly to the French, is =Louis Moreau Gottschalk=, born\r\nin New Orleans, in 1829. He early showed marked inclination for\r\nmusic and was sent to Paris to study. His first reputation was won\r\nas pianist. He traveled over Europe, the United States and parts of\r\nSouth America, giving concerts, in which he gave the principal place\r\nto his own compositions. He died in Brazil, in 1869. In later years,\r\nAmerican composers for the piano have not done such distinctive work\r\nas the two writers just mentioned, yet the names of =Charles Dennee=\r\n(1863), =Wilson G. Smith= (1855), =James H. Rogers= (1857), and\r\n=William H. Sherwood= (1854), composer, pianist and teacher, whose\r\nwork in the educational field is most important; =Edward Baxter Perry=\r\n(1855), who has splendidly triumphed over the infirmity of blindness,\r\nand through his unique lecture recitals has been a strong factor in\r\nmusical progress in the United States; and several men of foreign\r\nbirth who have identified themselves with American musical education:\r\n=Rafael Joseffy=, in New York City, =Carl Baermann= and =Carl Faelten=\r\nin Boston, =Constantin von Sternberg= in Philadelphia, and =Emil\r\nLiebling= in Chicago. Two other names should be mentioned here, =Henry\r\nSchradieck=, of New York, whose influence as a violinist and teacher\r\nhas been great, and =F. L. Ritter=, who occupied the chair of music in\r\nVassar College, a pioneer in college musical work.\r\n\r\n=Organ Composition=.—Nearly all of the best-known American composers\r\nhave been organists, yet certain men have made that line of musical\r\nwork peculiarly their own. Such men are =B. J. Lang= (1837), of Boston,\r\norganist, conductor and teacher; =George E. Whiting= (1842), who in\r\naddition to his high rank as an organist and teacher, has written\r\nmost acceptably for his instrument, and also for the orchestra and in\r\nthe large choral forms; =George W. Warren= (1828), and =S. P. Warren=\r\n(1841), whose sphere of activity is identified with New York City;\r\n=E. M. Bowman= (1848), organist, conductor, pianist and teacher;\r\n=Samuel B. Whitney= (1842), organist, noted for his work in training\r\nboy choirs, also his musical compositions for the Episcopal Church\r\nservice; =Clarence Eddy= (1851), organ virtuoso with an international\r\nreputation; =Henry M. Dunham= (1853), who has written well for his\r\ninstrument and has had an active and useful career as a teacher.\r\nAmong the younger men of prominence as American organists who have\r\nput themselves abreast with modern progress, and have studied all\r\nschools, may be mentioned =Everett E. Truette=, =Wallace Goodrich=,\r\n=Wm. C. Carl=, =Gerrit Smith=, =Charles Galloway=, =J. Fred Wolle=,\r\nwho organized the Bach Festival at Bethlehem, Pa., =H. J. Stewart=, a\r\nrepresentative California organist.\r\n\r\n=Musical Criticism=.—When indicating the various agencies for the\r\nshaping of musical appreciation in the United States, special mention\r\nmust be made of a group of writers whose contributions to musical\r\nmagazines, to the daily press in the large music centres, as well as\r\ntheir work in permanent form have influenced the taste of the American\r\npublic to a degree not paralleled in any other country. These writers\r\nhave enjoyed unusual opportunities and have used them well. The leading\r\nnewspapers of the United States give much space to reports of musical\r\nevents and have called to their aid writers of keen insight into\r\nmusical matters, thorough equipment on the score of musical knowledge,\r\nand gifted with much skill in expression as well as mastery of literary\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n=The Older Critics=.—The first of these critics to claim our attention\r\nis =John S. Dwight=, born in Boston, in 1813, a graduate of Harvard,\r\nand a student of theology as well. Gifted with a sound taste in art\r\nmatters, his reviews of musical works, concerts, etc., were very useful\r\nand helpful and much appreciated by the best circles of the city, for\r\nhis associations were with the most famous literary and scientific\r\nmen of his day. In 1852, he established a musical paper, _Journal of\r\nMusic_, which lasted nearly thirty years. He died in 1893. Another of\r\nthe older writers is =George P. Upton=, born in Boston, in 1834, a\r\ngraduate of Brown University, who entered journalism at twenty-one,\r\nas a member of the staff of the Chicago _Journal_; after some years\r\nof service with that paper, he went to the _Tribune_, with which he\r\nhas ever since been associated. Mr. Upton’s critical work covers the\r\nperiod of the growth of Chicago, which has been phenomenal in art\r\nas well as in commercial directions, and has been a most valuable\r\nfactor in musical upbuilding. In recent years his pen was a great aid\r\nto Theodore Thomas in his efforts to establish the Chicago Symphony\r\nOrchestra. His works in permanent form are “Woman in Music,” a series\r\nof books descriptive of the principal oratorios, operas, cantatas,\r\nand symphonies, translations from the German of Nohl’s biographies of\r\nmusicians, and a “Life of Theodore Thomas.” Coincident with Mr. Upton’s\r\nwork in the West is that of =W. S. B. Mathews=, born in London, N.\r\nH., in 1837. He was educated in Boston; after some years of musical\r\nwork in the South, he located in Chicago, as organist, teacher, writer\r\non musical matters. His reviews on local musical affairs appeared\r\nin several of the leading dailies, he was a contributor to Dwight’s\r\n_Journal_, and to all the musical papers that have come into the\r\nfield since. Perhaps no contemporary writer on education in music has\r\ninfluenced, and so strongly, as many teachers and students of music\r\nas Mr. Mathews. He has written a “Popular History of Music,” “Hundred\r\nYears of Music in America,” “How to Understand Music,” “Primer of\r\nMusical Forms,” and several works on the great composers, with critical\r\nstudies of their works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nW. S. B. MATHEWS. G. P. UPTON. L. C. ELSON.\r\n\r\nH. E. KREHBIEL. PHILIP HALE. W. F. APTHORP.\r\n\r\nJAMES HUNEKER.]\r\n\r\n=Boston Writers=.—The three leading Boston writers of recent years are\r\nLouis C. Elson, Wm. F. Apthorp and Philip Hale. =Louis C. Elson= was\r\nborn in Boston, in 1848. He was educated for the musical profession,\r\nat home and at Leipzig. In 1880, he became connected with the New\r\nEngland Conservatory, and at the present time is head of the theory\r\ndepartment of that institution. His journalistic activity covers a\r\nperiod of about thirty years and his writings have appeared in Boston\r\nand New York papers, as well as in the leading musical journals. His\r\nworks in book form are ten in number, the most valuable to the student\r\nof history being a large volume on the “History of American Music.”\r\nThe other works are critical, technical, and biographical. =Wm. F.\r\nApthorp= was born in Boston, in 1848, graduated at Harvard, and began\r\nhis critical work in music in 1872, being connected with several Boston\r\npapers. Mr. Apthorp’s published works are few in number, “Musicians\r\nand Music Lovers” and “The Opera, Past and Present.” In addition to\r\nthis he supplied program material for the Boston Symphony Concerts for\r\na number of years, educational as well as descriptive and critical.\r\n=Philip Hale= was born at Norwich, Vt., in 1854, graduated from Yale\r\nand was admitted to the Bar in New York in 1880. His interest in music\r\nand musical work proved too strong for him and he went abroad to\r\nGermany and France to study. In 1889, he located in Boston and began\r\nwork as musical critic on the staff of several of the papers. For a\r\nnumber of years he was Boston correspondent for the _Musical Courier_\r\nof New York. Two other men whose work in musical literature has been\r\nsignificant are =Alexander W. Thayer=, born at Natick, Mass., in 1817,\r\nwho wrote the standard biography of Beethoven, and =Thomas Tapper=, of\r\nBoston, who has written a number of valuable educational works in music.\r\n\r\n=New York Critics=.—New York City has four men of the first rank\r\nas writers on music, not only for critical acumen and technical\r\nknowledge, but also for literary style. =Henry T. Finck= was born in\r\nMissouri, in 1854, graduated from Harvard University, and studied at\r\nGerman universities for three years. When he returned to the United\r\nStates he joined the editorial staff of the _Evening Post_ and the\r\n_Nation_, which places he still holds. His works in musical literature\r\nare “Wagner and His Works,” “Paderewski and His Art,” “Songs and Song\r\nWriters,” and “Chopin and Other Essays.” =Henry E. Krehbiel= was born\r\nat Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1854. His first newspaper experience was in\r\nCincinnati; later he went to New York to the _Tribune_, which place he\r\nstill holds. His contributions to musical literature are “Studies in\r\nthe Wagnerian Drama,” “How to Listen to Music,” and “Music and Manners\r\nin the Classical Period,” besides contributions to the leading musical\r\npapers and general magazines. =William J. Henderson= was born at\r\nNewark, N. J., in 1855, graduated from Princeton University, afterward\r\nentering journalism in New York City, being connected with the _Times_,\r\nand later with the _Sun_. His books are distinctly educational in tone:\r\n“The Story of Music,” “How Music Developed,” “What is Good Music,”\r\n“The Orchestra and Orchestral Music,” “Richard Wagner: His Life and\r\nDramas,” and “The Art of the Singer.” A writer on music who has made a\r\nfine reputation in literary and dramatic criticism as well is =James\r\nHuneker=, a native of Philadelphia, whose active work has been done\r\nin New York City. His books of interest to the musician are a “Life\r\nof Chopin,” “Mezzotints in Modern Music,” “Melomaniacs,” “Overtones,”\r\n“Iconoclasts” and “Visionaries.”\r\n\r\n=Other Writers= in this field whose work deserves mention are =Edward\r\nDickinson=, of Oberlin, O., with two works, “History of Music in the\r\nWestern Church” and “The Study of the History of Music”; =Philip\r\nGoepp=, of Philadelphia, “Symphonies and their Meanings”; =Daniel\r\nGregory Mason=, of Boston, “From Grieg to Brahms”; =Lawrence Gilman=,\r\nof New York, “Phases of Modern Music”; Professor =Hugh A. Clarke=, of\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania, “Music and the Comrade Arts,” “Highways\r\nand By-ways of Music,” and several excellent theoretical works; =O. B.\r\nBoise=, Peabody Conservatory of Baltimore, with a work of a historical\r\nand critical nature, “Music and Its Masters,” and some theoretical\r\nworks; =Rupert Hughes=, “Contemporary American Composers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LESSON LX.\r\n\r\n                           MUSICAL EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Musical Education=.—The training of students in music has been\r\nthe special care of the greatest men connected with the art, a subject\r\nclose to the heart of men of rank and of means, and the object of\r\nGovernmental and municipal subvention. In most of the countries and\r\nmany of the larger cities of Europe, Art is considered a legitimate\r\nobject for public aid and fostering, and music receives a fair share of\r\nfunds set aside for that purpose. In the period before the Christian\r\nEra, musical education was carried on to prepare singers and players\r\neither for the religious service, and in the hands of the priests,\r\nor for entertainment and by slaves. Pope Sylvester founded a school\r\nfor singers, at Rome, in the 4th century, and the Church all through\r\nits history has laid stress on means for training executants for its\r\nmusical services. Guido of Arezzo, credited with a number of reforms in\r\nthe teaching of vocal music, is said to have had a school for training\r\nsingers to read musical notation. Like him, many of his successors in\r\nprominence were in charge of classes of pupils, yet this method by no\r\nmeans accords with our ideas of systematic, logical education in music.\r\nIt was largely the personal power and eminence of the master that\r\nattracted and retained pupils.\r\n\r\n=Musical Education in Italy=.—The first examples of the founding of\r\nschools of music or conservatories take us to Italy. The noted theorist\r\nTinctor or Tinctoris started a school at =Naples=, in 1496, but this\r\ndid not last very long. In the early part of the 16th century, several\r\ninstitutions were founded by private contribution for the purpose of\r\naffording homes and instruction to orphaned children. Ecclesiastical\r\nmusic was at first the special object of these schools. The pupils\r\nsang in choirs, various religious offices, processions, etc. There were\r\nfour of these institutions: _Santa Maria di Loreto_, founded in 1535,\r\nwhich had on its roster such eminent musicians as Alessandro Scarlatti,\r\nDurante, Porpora, Sacchini and Guglielmi; _San Onofrio_, founded in\r\n1576, some famous pupils being Gizzi, Jommelli, Piccini and Paisiello;\r\n_De Poveri di Gesù Cristo_, established in 1589, numbering among its\r\npupils, Greco, Vinci, and Pergolesi; _Della Pietà de’ Turchini_,\r\nstarted in 1584, having among its pupils, Leo, Cafara, and Feo. In\r\n1797, the first two named were united, the third was changed into a\r\nseminary for priests in 1744, and in 1808, the last was closed, and\r\na school of music was established to take the place of the remaining\r\ninstitutions. This school, which received the title _Reale Collegio di\r\nMusica_, still exists.\r\n\r\n=Venice= rivaled Naples in devotion to music, and early took measures\r\nto give musical instruction to the wards of charitable institutions.\r\nThese schools were not named _Conservatorio_, as at Naples, but\r\n_Ospedale_ (hospital), since they were a part of the foundation\r\nfor institutions to receive the poor and infirm, their work as\r\nconservatories developing gradually. Such masters as Lotti, Galuppi,\r\nScarlatti, Cimarosa presided over the four schools best known. When the\r\nRepublic fell, these institutions collapsed in the financial crisis\r\nthat followed. The principal music school in Venice at the present time\r\nis the _Liceo Benedetto Marcello_, which is subsidized by the city. An\r\nItalian conservatory of ancient date is the one at =Palermo=, which was\r\nestablished in 1615. At the present time it is a State institution.\r\nThe Academy of St. Cecilia, at =Rome=, dates its original foundation\r\nto a society of musicians formed in 1566, a charter being granted by\r\nPope Gregory XIII, in 1584. The Academy possesses the largest and most\r\nimportant musical library in Italy. =Milan= had a school of music as\r\nearly as 1483. The celebrated theoretician, Gafurio, was the first\r\ngreat teacher. It was not permanent, however, and though there were\r\nschools for singers there from time to time, it was not until 1807 that\r\nthe municipality established a regular school of music. The first\r\nschool of music at =Bologna= was established in 1482, but it did not\r\nbecome permanent. In later years, musical affairs were in the hands of\r\nacademies for the promotion of arts and sciences. In 1864, a school was\r\nopened on modern lines. =Genoa= has a school which was founded in 1829;\r\nit is subsidized by the city. The school at =Florence= was opened in\r\n1862, and is richly endowed. A school was heavily endowed by Rossini\r\nand located at =Pesaro=, his birthplace.\r\n\r\n=The Paris Conservatoire=.—To France belongs the honor of following\r\nclosely in the footsteps of the Italian authorities. In 1784, a\r\nRoyal School of Singing was opened in =Paris=, under the direction\r\nof Gossec, the composer; in 1793 it was enlarged in scope and was\r\ncalled the National Institute of Music; in 1795 the name was changed\r\nto the _Conservatoire de Musique_, which it still bears. In 1800\r\nthe organization was further modified by Bonaparte. The institution\r\nreceives an annual subvention from the Government. This school is\r\njustly considered as one of the greatest in existence and has been the\r\ncentre of musical training for practically all the prominent French\r\nmusicians. A great incentive is the celebrated _Prix de Rome_ (Roman\r\nPrize), which enables the winner to spend three years in study in Italy\r\nand Germany. The library is one of the most important in France, and\r\ndates from the foundation of the school. The Museum, which has one of\r\nthe finest collections in Europe, was established in 1864. Affiliated\r\nschools have been established in the principal French cities, such as:\r\n=Marseilles=, =Toulouse=, =Nantes=, =Dijon=, =Lyons= and =Rouen=.\r\n\r\n=Musical Education in Germany=.—Among the German conservatories, that\r\nat =Prague= is the oldest. It was founded in 1811. Besides music, the\r\ncourse of study provides for instruction in general branches. The\r\nviolin department of this school is one of its strongest features.\r\nThe conservatory at =Vienna= was opened in 1817, under the direction\r\nof Salieri, as a vocal school; other branches were added and by 1821\r\nthe foundation was that of a true conservatory. The course of study\r\nis comprehensive and the school has graduated a number of eminent\r\nmusicians. It is under the patronage of the Society of the Friends of\r\nMusic. Probably the German conservatory best known to American readers\r\nis that founded at =Leipzig=, in 1843, by Mendelssohn, and of which he\r\nwas the first director. The fund used in starting the school was one of\r\n20,000 thalers bequeathed by a Government official “for the purposes of\r\nart and science.” Such masters as Schumann, Moscheles, Ferdinand David,\r\nPlaidy, Richter and Reinecke were members of the faculty at different\r\nperiods in the history of the school. This conservatory has had a\r\nlarger number of American pupils than any other German institution.\r\nThe oldest conservatory in =Berlin= was a private institution. The\r\nmost important school is the Royal High School for Music, which is a\r\nbranch of the Royal Academy of Arts, and is under the patronage of\r\nthe Prussian Government. This school has three sections, the one for\r\nchurch music was opened in 1822, for musical composition in 1833, that\r\nfor executive art in 1869. The violin school, under the direction of\r\nJoseph Joachim, attracts pupils from all parts of the world. =Cologne=\r\nhas a conservatory which is aided financially by the municipality.\r\nThis school was established in 1850, Ferdinand Hiller being the first\r\ndirector. The Royal Conservatory at =Dresden= was organized in 1856,\r\nand has paid considerable attention to its department for opera.\r\n=Munich= has a school which receives State aid. It was founded in 1867.\r\nRheinberger, who was teacher of composition here, drew a number of\r\nAmericans to the school. Other schools receiving State or municipal\r\nsubventions are those at =Wuerzburg=, =Weimar=, =Frankfort= and\r\n=Wiesbaden=.\r\n\r\n=Other European Music Schools=.—The other European countries have also\r\npromoted the organization of schools for teaching music. The strongest\r\nschools in Switzerland are those at =Zurich=, =Geneva=, =Basle= and\r\n=Berne=. In Belgium are several fine schools: at =Brussels=, founded\r\nin 1813, which is now a Government institution, at =Liége= (1827),\r\nat =Ghent= (1833), and at =Antwerp=, the latter founded in 1867,\r\nby the noted Belgian composer, Peter Benoit. These four schools\r\nreceive State aid. Holland has three conservatories in her three\r\nlarge cities, =Amsterdam=, =Rotterdam= and =The Hague=. Scandinavian\r\nmusical education is cared for by the conservatories at =Copenhagen=,\r\n=Christiania= and =Stockholm=, the last being under Government\r\npatronage. Spain has conservatories at =Madrid=, =Saragossa= and\r\n=Valencia=, and Portugal, one at =Lisbon=. Greece sustains a school at\r\n=Athens=.\r\n\r\n=St. Petersburg Conservatory=.—A conservatory of great importance is\r\nthat founded at =St. Petersburg= through the exertions of the famous\r\ncomposer, Anton Rubinstein. In 1859, he organized the Russian Musical\r\nSociety, the first object of which was to give amateurs an opportunity\r\nto practice orchestral playing. Changes in the policy of the Society\r\nwere gradually introduced, branches were founded in several other\r\ncities, among them Moscow, and serious efforts were inaugurated to\r\norganize a music school in the Capital. The first instruction was\r\ngiven gratuitously, money was raised in private circles and a floor\r\nwas rented in a private house in 1862 for the use of the school. The\r\nEmperor Alexander II gave to the school an annuity of 5000 rubles and\r\na building which was the property of the Crown. In 1866 the name was\r\nofficially designated as Conservatory, and from that time on several\r\nmembers of the Royal family became patrons of the school, socially as\r\nwell as financially. Rubinstein was the first director. The building\r\nat present occupied by the school was formerly the Grand Theatre and\r\nis very completely furnished for the purposes of the Conservatory,\r\nhaving two concert halls, museums, library, class rooms, chapel, etc.\r\nAmong the graduates of the institution are Tchaikovsky, Glazounoff,\r\nBalakireff, Arensky, Liadow, Gabrilowitsch, Sapellnikoff and Felix\r\nBlumenfeld.\r\n\r\n=Musical Education in England= is well cared for, principally by\r\nthe strong schools in London, of which there are four that call\r\nfor particular notice. =The Royal Academy of Music= is the oldest;\r\nit was founded in 1822. This institution has had royal patronage\r\nfrom the beginning. The British public has generously replied with\r\nsubscriptions to appeals made for funds at different periods in the\r\nhistory of the school, the Government grant being revoked on several\r\noccasions. At the present time the revenues are a Government grant,\r\nsubscriptions, donations, and students’ fees. Such eminent musicians\r\nas Dr. Crotch, Sterndale Bennett and Sir George Macfarren have filled\r\nthe position of principal of the school. Sir A. C. Mackensie is the\r\npresent head. A strong rival to the Royal Academy is the =Royal College\r\nof Music=, which is the outgrowth of the National Training School for\r\nMusic, founded by the Society of Arts in 1876, Sir Arthur Sullivan,\r\nfirst principal. It was in 1883 that the institution passed into the\r\nhands of the newly-organized Royal College of Music. The funds of the\r\ncollege come from fees, subscriptions and endowments. Sir George Grove\r\nwas director for a number of years and was succeeded by Sir C. H.\r\nHubert Parry, the eminent composer and theorist. =Trinity College= is\r\nthe outgrowth of the activity of a musical society formed to promote\r\nchurch music and singing. In 1881 it was incorporated under the name\r\nit now bears and the scope of its instruction extended. The =Guildhall\r\nSchool of Music= is under the patronage of the authorities of the City\r\nof London. This institution was founded in 1880, and has a very large\r\nattendance. The present director is Mr. W. H. Cummings. The leading\r\nEnglish universities, Cambridge, Oxford, London, Durham, and that at\r\nEdinburgh and Dublin have courses in the theory of music, leading to\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n=Musical Education in the United States: Boston=.—The United States\r\nhas no schools of music under Governmental or municipal direction, and\r\nnone which receive subventions, and but one, established in 1905, in\r\nNew York City, which is endowed. The spread of musical education has\r\nbeen due to the energies and in many cases the sacrifices of musicians\r\nand music lovers in the larger cities. In Lesson LVII reference was\r\nmade to societies in the three large American cities, Boston, New York\r\nand Philadelphia, to further musical education. The oldest true music\r\nschool in the United States is the =New England Conservatory of Music=,\r\nin Boston, founded by Dr. Tourjée, in 1867. A notable feature was\r\nthe dormitory for female students. Eminent instructors were engaged,\r\nboth foreigners and Americans, and the school quickly established\r\na reputation as the leading institution for musical education. Dr.\r\nTourjée was succeeded in the directorship by Mr. Carl Faelten, who\r\nresigned after several years of service and was followed in the office\r\nby Mr. George W. Chadwick, the present director, in 1897. In 1902 a\r\nnew building was erected largely through the benefactions of several\r\npublic-spirited citizens of Boston. Among the teachers who exerted a\r\nstrong influence on American pupils may be mentioned Stephen A. Emery,\r\nA. D. Turner, Lyman W. Wheeler, Carlyle Petersilea, Otto Bendix and\r\nGeorge E. Whiting. A school in Boston, with special strength in the\r\nviolin department, was the Boston Conservatory, founded by Julius\r\nEichberg.\r\n\r\n=The West=.—In 1878, several music-loving citizens of Cincinnati\r\nestablished the =Cincinnati College of Music=, with Theodore Thomas\r\nas the first director. After him came various members of the faculty,\r\nand in 1897, Mr. Frank Van der Stucken accepted the post of dean of\r\nthe faculty. In connection with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and\r\nthe Festival Association, the College of Music has been a powerful\r\nfactor in the musical life of the city. As an educational force it\r\nhas done much for music in the West and the Southwest, and its pupils\r\nhave carried into all sections of the tributary States sound musical\r\nprecepts. =Chicago= has, at the present day, several schools, organized\r\nand conducted by private enterprise, which are doing splendid work\r\nand have made the city the musical centre of the West. Musicians of\r\nthe highest rank have been brought to the United States by several of\r\nthese conservatories, to the benefit of musical art in Chicago and the\r\nWestern States.\r\n\r\n=Oberlin Conservatory of Music=, a department of Oberlin College,\r\nmay be taken as a type of the American idea of musical work in an\r\ninstitution of learning. The school has a strong faculty and a large\r\nnumber of pupils, whose work receives credit for graduation in the\r\ncollege courses; the students in music have all the privileges of those\r\nentered in the regular colleges. Oberlin has been a great factor for\r\nmusical progress in the Middle West.\r\n\r\n=The East=.—New York City has two schools that deserve mention: the\r\n=National Conservatory of Music=, founded by Mrs. Jeannette Thurber,\r\na school which has offered as teachers to the American pupils such\r\nmusicians as Rafael Joseffy and Antonin Dvořák; the =Institute of\r\nMusical Art=, opened in 1905, with Frank Damrosch as director, with\r\na faculty of high repute, both Europeans and Americans. This school\r\nstarted with an endowment of $500,000 given by Mr. James Loeb, a New\r\nYork banker. A school of music managed on conservative lines has\r\nexisted for a number of years in =Baltimore=, in connection with the\r\nPeabody Institute, which was endowed by the banker, George Peabody. At\r\nthe present time nearly every city of importance in the United States\r\ncontains one or more conservatories, managed on a strictly business\r\nbasis, and furnishing to the people of their communities thorough\r\ninstruction at reasonable cost.\r\n\r\n=In the Colleges=.—The important American institutions for higher\r\neducation, both for men and for women, have recognized the claim of\r\nmusic to a place in the curriculum, and have provision for instructions\r\nin the theory, history and esthetics of music, many also having\r\nfacilities for instructions in the practical side of music. =Harvard=,\r\n=Yale=, =Columbia=, =Pennsylvania=, =Michigan=, =California= and\r\n=Northwestern= Universities have established professorships of music,\r\nand have called eminent musicians to the posts. The work done in\r\nhundreds of schools of less reputation is a great factor in spreading\r\nmusical culture throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adam, 355\r\n  Aeolian, 30\r\n  Akkadians, 25, 36\r\n  Albeniz, 497\r\n  Alberti, 252\r\n  Alkan, 443\r\n  Amati (_Amáhtee_), 317\r\n  Ambrose, 63\r\n  American Indian Music, 531\r\n  American Music, 525\r\n  Anglebert d’, 258\r\n  Antiphony, 59\r\n  Apollo, Hymn to, 48, 49\r\n  Apthorp, 550\r\n  Archæology, 20\r\n  Archer, 168\r\n  Archilute, 151\r\n  Arensky, 521\r\n  Arghool, 150\r\n  Aria, 190\r\n  Aristotle, 47\r\n  Aristoxenus, 47\r\n  Arkadelt, 128, 136, 140, 143\r\n  Astorga, 229\r\n  Auber (_O-bare_), 355, 357\r\n  Authentic, 64, 66\r\n\r\n  Babylonian Music, 24, 36\r\n  Bach (_Bakh_), C.

The sacred harpist plays a prelude, then, standing before\r\na statue of the deceased, chants the dirge first sung long ago at the\r\nfuneral of the Pharaoh Antouf: ‘The world is but perpetual movement and\r\nchange.... Not all the lamentations in the world will restore happiness\r\nto the man who is in the sepulchre; make then a good-day and do not be\r\nidle in enjoying thyself.’”\r\n\r\n[4] Smith.\r\n\r\n[5] This treatise is now attributed to Cleonidas, writing about\r\n120 A. D.\r\n\r\n[6] By this is meant that all intervals of the major second, so-called,\r\nare not equally large and cannot be, if a correct division of fourths\r\nand fifths be desired. Didymus made the interval from C to D smaller\r\nthan the other seconds of the scale; Ptolemy put the “minor” tone\r\nbetween D and E, where it is now placed.\r\n\r\n[7] Some investigators claim that some of these melodies were part of\r\nthe Temple service at Jerusalem, making the specific statement that\r\nthe melody used in some liturgical services, and known as the _Tonus\r\nPeregrinus_, is based on a Temple chant.\r\n\r\n[8] A fine account of their methods is found in Robert Louis\r\nStevenson’s novel “Kidnapped.”\r\n\r\n[9] Mention of prominent American organists and teachers is made in\r\nLesson LIX.\r\n\r\n[10] See especially Op. 14, No. 2, first movement.\r\n\r\n[11] Grove’s Dictionary says 1611.\r\n\r\n[12] See Wasielewski: _Die Violine und Ihre Meister_.\r\n\r\n[13] This third sound will correspond to the difference of the\r\nvibration numbers of the other two.\r\n\r\n[14] 1907.\r\n\r\n[15] His mother’s name, Bartholdy, was added to distinguish this branch\r\nfrom other Mendelssohn families.\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n  Underscores \"_\" before and after a word or phrase indicate _italics_\r\n    in the original text.\r\n  Equal signs \"=\" before and after a word or phrase indicate =bold=\r\n    in the original text.\r\n  Small capitals have been converted to SOLID capitals.\r\n  Illustrations have been moved so they do not break up paragraphs.\r\n  Old or antiquated spellings have been preserved.\r\n  Typographical errors have been silently corrected but other variations\r\n    in spelling and punctuation remain unaltered.",
